The seven candidates face a difficult task in persuading FIFA's 209 members that they can reform the organisation. Keir Radnedge profiles the men in contention for FIFA's top job JEROME CHAMPAGNE I ■ French Age: 57 Years in game: 17 Current position: Consultant, including roles with the Palestine FA and the Kosovar Football Federation ■ Worked at FIFA for 11 years in senior roles including deputy general secretary before being forced out in January 2011. Tried to run last May but failed to obtain the necessary nominations. \"At a time when football is suffering along with our planet and society from the increasing level of inequalities, we have to assert the need to better control the globalisation of our sport. We must continue the efforts to improve the spectacle of elite football and, at the same time, reduce the inequalities for the benefit of everyone\" 10 WORLD SOCCER Building bridges..can FIFA dig itself out of a hole of its own making? GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE GIANNI INFANTINO n Swiss Age: 45 Years in game: 15 Status: UEFA general secretary (since 2009) ■ Joined UEFA in 2000 as a lawyer and secretary general of the International Centre for Sports Studies at the University of Neuchatel. Is one of UEFA's two delegates on the FIFA reform committee chaired by Francois Carrard. \"My manifesto will be based on the need for reform and also for a FIFA that genuinely serves the interests of all 209 national associations, big or small, and that puts football and football development at the top of its agenda\" MICHEL PLATINI 1 1 French Age: 60 Years in game: 43 Status: President of UEFA and vice-president of FIFA but currently under a 90-day provisional suspension from football by the FIFA ethics committee, pending the outcome of an investigation into his acceptance in 2011 of a \"disloyal payment\" from FIFA on Blotter's authority. Cannot campaign but may be allowed into the race if he clears his name before the election. ■ Enjoyed a stellar career as both player and then administrator. Starred for Nancy, Saint-Etienne and Juventus, and captained France to victory in Euro 84. Coached France between 1988 and 1992. From 1992 to 1998, he was co-president of the FIFA World Cup Organising Committee and vice-president of the French Football Federation from 2000. Worked as Blatter's \"football counsellor\" at FIFA from 1999 to 2002. Ousted Lennart Johansson to become UEFA president in 2007. \"/ am the only candidate with such a broad view of the game. I would push key dossiers such as the regulation of transfers and the problem of TPO.Just as in UEFA, I would ensure greater democratic participation among the organisation's leadership. In the FIFA executive committee I would welcome representatives of the players and the clubs. I welcome reform proposals to clarify the role of the executive committee and to separate politics from the operational area\" ■ Bahraini Age: 49 Years in game: 17 Current position: Asian Football Confederation president and FIFA vice-president. SHEIKH SALMAN BIN EBRAHIM AL KHALIFA ■ Former head of the Bahrain FA and member of the ruling royal family. Led the committee which recommended switching the 2022 World Cup to the winter. Has consistently denied allegations linking him to the torture of national-team players involved in protests in 2011. Supported by Olympic powerbroker Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah, a new fellow member of the FIFAExCo. Tm not looking to be an executive president. I think we have to bring the right people in, we have to bring the professionals to do the job. With the support I'm going to get we're going to turn it around very quickly. We have big examples of football organisations around the world - the Premier League, the Bundesliga, even UEFA who have a football side and a revenue side. This is what we want to bring to FIFA\" WORLD SOCCER 11 THE WORLD THIS MONTH MUSA BILITY ™ LiberidPi Age: 48 Years in game: Five Status: Businessman and president of the Liberian FA ■ A somewhat surprise contender, and one who was disappointed to be denied the endorsement of the African confederation's executive committee. Was banned by CAF for six months in 2013 for the improper handling of confidential documents. If we are to change football we have to make sure that those who have been running FIFA for the last 20-25 years have nothing to do with it. Africa is the largest voting bloc in FIFA and we must take the lead to bring football together\" Before the vote on February 26, candidates must pass \"integrity checks”. If a candidate receives two-thirds of the 209 votes in the first ballot they will be declared the winner. If there is no two-thirds majority, the candidate with the lowest vote is eliminated and another vote held until one candidate has a majority of more than 50 per cent. PRINCE All BIN AL HUSSEIN C Jordanian Age: 39 Years in game: 16 Status: President of Jordan Football Association and head of the Asian Football Development Project ■ Ousted South Korea's Chung Mong-joon as Asia's FIFA vice- president in 2011 with the support of Sepp Blatter, who he then antagonised when emerging as a reformist within the FIFA ExCo. Ousted last year by Sheikh Salman. Stood against Blatter in May, garnering 73 votes and denying him a first-round knockout victory before withdrawing. \"Last May I was the only person who dared to challenge Mr Blatter for the presidency. I ran because I believe that FIFA needs change - and I had the courage to fight for change when others were afraid. Football is hope. It is unity - and it is a powerful tool to make the world a better place. I do not believe that FIFA can give this sport back to the people of the world, without new leadership, untainted by the practices of the past\" TOKYO SEXWALE S South African Age: 62 Years in game: Seven Status: Businessman (mining millionaire) ■ For the past two years a consultant to FIFA's anti-discrimination taskforce, and chairman of the Palestine-lsrael monitoring commission since June. An anti-apartheid campaigner - who spent 13 years on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela - and former government minister. Was a member of the bid team and the organising committee for the 2010 World Cup. \"FIFA, the organisation of the beautiful game, is damaged. The brand is severely undermined. I am going into this campaign as a candidate of my country with the confidence bestowed in me to make sure that we win. But win or lose people will know there was an African who was here who shook things up\" THE FAILURES Missing out...(from ieft to right) David Nakhid, Chung Mong-joon, David Ginoia, Ramon Vega and Zico David Nakhid: Former Trinidad & Tobago international who submitted his five nominations but was then excluded by the electoral committee because the United States Virgin Islands had also nominated another contender. Chung Mong-joon: South Korean billionaire who spent 17 years as a FIFA vice-president until 2011. His potential candidacy was halted after he was banned from football for six years by the FIFA ethics committee after events concerning the 2018-2022 World Cup bid process. David Ginoia (France), Ramon Vega (Switzerland) and Zico (Brazil) expressed an interest in standing but failed to obtain the necessary nominations. 12 WORLD SOCCER GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE Keir RADNEDGE THE INSIDER Blatter-Platini rift grows amid the rancour Any thought that the provisional suspensions of Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, plus the deadline for presidential nominations, would calm troubled waters at FIFA proved mistaken. If anything, the seas grew ever more turbulent with both Blatter and Platini going public with self-justifying, self-delusional interviews. The simple reaction was to say, with Mercutio in Shakespeare's Romeo andJuliet \"A plague o’ both your houses!' But in this case the house - \"the mother house\" as Platini likes to call FIFA - is here to stay and the challenge is both how and through whom solutions can be found. Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah has commented that reform is more important than the identity of the next president, but this was being disingenuous. The two clearly go hand-in-hand. This also assumes there will be anybody left. Blatter and Platini were suspended provisionally for 90 days by the ethics committee over allegations of financial misconduct. In Blotter's case this involved the issues which have already submitted him to criminal investigation by the Office of the Swiss Attorney-General: the under-valued selling of Caribbean World Cup TV rights to Jack Warner (in his CONCACAF dictatorship days) and the authorising of a “disloyal payment\" of 2million Swiss Francs to Platini in 2011. Platini's suspension was due to his acceptance of the SFr2m. which he claimed was for work undertaken for FIFA between 1999 and 2002. Fle has yet to come up with a plausible explanation for the nine-year delay in demanding payment. Blatter had boasted for so long about the creation of the independent ethics committee; indeed, he had always made a point of using the word \"independent\". Fle had not expected it to be independent enough, of course, to suspend him - though one assumes he found consolation in seeing Platini dragged down with him. Simultaneously, ethics judge Flans-Joachim Eckert was being kept busy by other alleged miscreants as Warner was, justifiably if belatedly, banned from football; Chung Mong-joon was taken out of the presidential race by a six-year ban arising out of the 2018- 2022 bid inquiry; and there were 90-day provisional suspensions for FIFA secretary- general Jerome Vaicke (earlier \"relieved of his duties\" by Blatter over other financial issues) and Thailand's Worawi Makudi. Also under investigation are Franz Beckenbauer and Spain's long-serving federation president Angel Maria Villar Llona, as well as Ricardo Teixeira (Brazil), Amos Adamu (Nigeria) and Nicolas Leoz (Paraguay), plus two of the \"Zurich Seven\" in Jeffrey Webb (Cayman Islands) and Eugenio Figueredo (Uruguay). Webb is already back in the US and on bail after denying all charges in the FIFAgate investigation, and so too is ex- CBF president Jose Maria Marin, whose “negotiations\" with the FBI explain why his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero, is frightened to leave the unextraditable safety of Brazil. The five remaining members of the Zurich Seven have been cleared for extradition but are appealing to the Swiss Fligh Court. In the meantime, plans for the presidential election on February 26 continue, and so does the work of the reform committee under Swiss lawyer Francois Carrard. A limit of three four-year terms for the president (but not the ExCo) has found favour, plus an age limit of 74 and full transparency on pay. The ExCo will decide in early December on a package to set before the extraordinary congress. Seven contenders were accepted into the election process - though Platini only if he clears his name in time. No obvious favourite stood out. Prince Ali will presumably lack European support this time; Sheikh Salman will be hammered all the way by human rights groups; Jerome Champagne (by far the deepest thinker about the game and the challenges ahead) may be perceived as having been too close to Blatter for too long; Gianni Infantino is clearly a stand-in for his boss; Musa Bility has ruffled some regional feathers in Africa; which leaves Tokyo Sexwale as a possible compromise candidate somewhere down the line. Blatter, despite his suspension, will continue to pull strings and call in favours in between his paranoid rants about everyone being against him - the US, England, UEFA, the European Parliament, Michel Platini and even (horror of horrors!) his own ethics committee. Eckert & co were supposed to clean up the rest of the game, not him. Flere, at least then, was a glimmer of hope. iV5 Blatter, despite his suspension, will continue to pull strings WORLD SOCCER 13 THE WORLD THIS MONTH FROM THE EDITOR We have lots of great football stories this month. From the Euro 2016 qualifiers, there has been the high of Albania (page 34) and the low of Holland (page 82). We’ve witnessed Mexico’s defeat of the USA (pages 76 and 78), and we have a terrific interview with Barcelona’s man of the moment, Ivan Rakitic (page 50). But once again we find ourselves having to report on the ongoing meltdown at FIFA, where the increasingly delusional ramblings of Sepp Blatter (aged 79 and three-quarters) have provided yet another reason for us to welcome his departure in February. We have headlined our feature on the presidential contest (page lo) as “The impossible election” because whoever wins - and let’s be honest, none of the seven candidates truly convinces - the internal structures of FIFA have proved wholly resistant to change. The requirement that presidential candidates have at least two years’ involvement in football has ruled out any external candidates. Yet an outsider with no baggage is exactly what FIFA requires if there is to be any chance of serious change. It is a challenge for a monthly publication - whether paper or il to stay in touch with all the events at FIFA. But don’t forget our regular updates and analysis at worldsoccer.com.

To this backdrop, further murky details have crawled out from beneath the German football federation's stone about how it obtained 2006. Reputations sullied so far include Franz Beckenbauer, current German FA (DFB) president Wolfgang Niersbach, his predecessor Theo Zwanziger, long-serving former general secretary Florst R Schmidt, and Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the late former owner of World Cup sponsor Adidas. Unproven suspicions have long hung over activities of the German bid 14 WORLD SOCCER O O GLOBAL FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE “Without a doubt there was a slush fund linked to the German World Cup application... the way I see it, Niersbach is lying” Former German FA president Theo Zwanziger (right) attacks his successor, Wolfgang Niersbach I Under investigation...Blatter (left) and Beckenbauer f^^nnarchen ^ re ivahre Geschichte der WM 20 og der WM 2006 committee which Beckenbauer headed. These included Bayern Munich (where he was president) playing friendlies in countries to generate TV rights for FIFA ExCo voters. Then there was the flight for home of Oceania president Charlie Dempsey before the final round of voting. This subsequently tallied up 12-11 to Germany and Dempsey's lost vote meant Blatter could not use his casting ballot which would have been destined for South Africa. Now it has emerged that when the Germans launched their bid, Louis-Dreyfus loaned Beckenbauer's bid committee the equivalent of €6.7million as seed funding in a private rather than directly corporate capacity. A year before the finals he asked for his money back. A letter uncovered by news magazine Der Spiegel purports to show that FIFA was asked to repay the money via the cover of a “cultural programme'' to a Louis-Dreyfus bank account in Geneva. This promoted panic in the DFB. Niersbach revealed he had found out about a mystery payment last June but had omitted to tell the rest of the DFB board and had only now initiated an inquiry. Fie rejected Spiegel suggestions that the money had been used as a slush fund to buy votes. So did Beckenbauer. Flowever, both men said such a payment - of, conveniently, a similar amount - had been facilitated to FIFA to guarantee the provision of a €170m grant towards World Cup staging costs.

All I’m interested in is whether they are good or not” Milan coach Sinisa Mihajlovic hands a first-team debut to 16-year-old keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma o o Highlights from some of our regular on-line contributions from Brazil, Spain, Germany and Italy at worldsoccer.com SOUTH AMERICA So perhaps next year's Centenary Copa America will go ahead after all. The tournament to celebrate 100 years since the first Copa in 1916, and featuring the 10 South American nations plus six from CONCACAF, is scheduled to take place in the USA next June, but has run into an obvious problem. Rather than being just a FIFA scandal, all those arrests in a Swiss hotel at the end of May could also be described as a local affair: a tale of corruption involving TV rights in the Americas - the very terrain of the proposed tournament. Unravelling all the legal aspects has not been easy, but CONMEBOL has said it is ripping up its contract with Datisa, the TV company formed by a merger of all those firms whose name has come up in the connection with recent events. An executive committee has been formed to take care of next year's Copa, comprising two representatives each from CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, and one from US Soccer. Their task is to choose venues and sort out the organisational side within just over seven months. Tim Vickery GERMANY Overachieving small-town teams with limited playing resources often find it tough to combine the Europa League with domestic obligations, and that certainly seems to be the case for Augsburg, who in a few short months have gone from fifth-place last season to dysfunctional bottom of the Bundesliga pile this term. With fixtures coming thick and fast, Markus Weinzierl's side do not seem as fresh and resourceful as they were last year, and not as defensively switched- on or sharp going they have been worked out. Rather than allow Augsburg to play on the counter, opponents are letting them have the ball - and Weinzierl's side have lacked the guile to break sides down. “Die Fuggerstadtek’ may have to forget about Europe. Bundesliga survival is all that matters. Nick Bidwell forward. Essential ly. Not a priority...Augsburg celebrate scoring against AZ in the Europa League G>nfident..Mihajlovic says he can turn Milan around According to Giovanni Trapattoni, there are only two types of football coaches; those who have been sacked and those who will be sacked. Right now, Milan's Sinisa Mihajlovic might have good reason to reflect on Trapattoni's home-spun philosophy. After nine Serie A games, Milan languished in mid-table, much to the dismay of their hardcore fans. That, in itself, was enough to prompt media speculation that maybe the folk at Milanello have already lost faith in this season's new leader. A 2-1 win over Sassuolo, with goals from Carlos Bacca and Luiz Adriano, took the pressure off Mihajlovic for a while, but it will not have been lost on the Serb coach that, for the first time in three months, club owner Silvio Berlusconi turned up at the training ground to rally the troops. That same day, Mihajlovic opted to “get his retaliation in first'', claiming he was the man to get Milan season's back on track, before adding: \"If I don't succeed, you're going to need an exorcist around here''.

I am fully focused on finishing the season strong and helping the New York Cosmos win the NASL championship. In the coming months I will decide the next step in my career. \"Playing has been part of my life for so long. The decision to retire is not an easy one but I believe it's the right time!' ■ OBITUARIES Howard KENDALL (1946-2015) The former Everton manager, who guided the club to league titles in 1985 and 1987, has died at the age of 69. Kendall played more than 200 times for Everton, winning the title in 1970 as part of the famous “Floly Trinity\" along with Alan Ball and Colin Flarvey, and in his six years as manager, between 1981 and 1987, he won the FA Cup and the European Cup- winners Cup in addition to those league titles. Fie had two further spells with the club, along with stints at Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Athletic Bilbao, Notts County and Sheffield United. Kendall's former players were quick to pay tribute, with Gary Lineker, who signed for Everton after their title success in 1985, tweeting: “Saddened to hear that Floward Kendall has passed away. Brilliantly managed the best club side I ever played for at Everton. Great bloke\" Brian Glanville adds: The sad death of the splendid Floward Kendall takes me back to two back-to-back European fixtures in 1985. In Rotterdam for Everton's 3-1 victory over Rapid Vienna in the Cup- winners Cup Final, the only misdemeanour I saw was when an Everton fan walked out of the restaurant where I was lunching berating the bill. What a shocking contrast with the drunken violence of the Liverpool supporters in Brussels the following week at the European Cup Final versus Juventus. The FA did public penance with a five-year ban from Europe on all English clubs. Collective punishment, that ugly phenomenon. Liverpool deserved a ban. Everton, who had won the Championship (the real one) under the excellent Kendall, was among the many other clubs which didn't. Those five years of banishment did great harm to English football. Meanwhile, such splendid memories of Kendall, who was the youngest player ever in an FA Cup Final, for Preston in 1964, but was never capped. WORLD SOCCER 21 THE WORLD THIS MONTH Paul GARDNER 1mm THE WORLDWIDE VIEW why MLS plays in the summer... and other American oddities Off...New York Red Bulls' attempts to clear snow from the pitch for their 2012 play-off with DC United were in vain We’re at that time of the year when Major League Soccer's season climaxes and its critics enjoy themselves by picking it to pieces. Prominent among those are the Eurosnobs, a rather boring but quite loud subset of the larger “nerds and know-alls\" group. The Eurosnobs don’t like MLS because it doesn’t do things the way they are done in Europe. Northern-hemisphere teams play in the autumn and winter and everyone knows it. But MLS plays in the summer and the Eurosnobs are greatly put out as they see this as an affront to the natural order. Even though these people live in the USA - and most are American - they seem unaware of the unique problems soccer faces in their country. In the US, big-time professional sport - which means baseball, gridiron football, basketball and ice hockey - has the whole year sewn up. There is simply no time when soccer can be played without going up against a competing pro sport. No established football country faces such a situation. MLS has worked out - just as North American Soccer League did before - that summer is the best period for a soccer season, when their main challenger is baseball. Soccer can survive against baseball, the wisdom goes. But that’s not quite as neat as it sounds. MLS growth - it started in 1996 with 10 teams and now has 20 - means more games and a longer season. The current campaign began on March 6 and will not end until the MLS Cup Final on December 6. Playing the Final in December raises another problem: cold weather. Given the vast range of temperatures in this huge country, it should be possible to avoid playing the Final in northern cities. But in 2012 MLS abandoned its policy of playing the Final in a predetermined - and usually warm - city. Instead, it is now played at the home of one of the finalists. If that happens to be California’s Los Angeles Galaxy or Florida’s Orlando City, warm weather can be guaranteed. This year Galaxy were one of the favourites to reach the Final. But so too were the New York Red Bulls, while Toronto, New England Revolution and Montreal Impact were also candidates. All of those venues would be cold, possibly very cold, maybe even with snow. That’s another reason for playing in summer: the northern winter in the USA would make the frozen-hard pitches at up to nine of the northern MLS clubs simply unusable. And when you’re trying to introduce the great American public to the beauty and delight of soccer, frostbite and chilblains should not be part of the deal. Closed, centrally heated stadia could be an answer, and maybe one day MLS will lead the sport in that direction, but that’s not going to happen for quite a while. And there is something else that MLS does not do that annoys outsiders. With no promotion and relegation, the Eurosnobs have convinced themselves that the game will not take off in the USA until there is. But the system does not exist in other American pro sports and would simply not work in MLS. If an investor coughs up, say, $100million to buy a franchise, they do not expect to be told that, if the team does not do well in its first year, they will have to play in the second division against rinky-dink opponents. Such a scenario would mean waving goodbye to many potential investors. But MLS keeps the excitement alive with its play-off system. The top six teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences play within their divisions to come up with a sub-champion, and the two then meet in the MLS Cup Final. In place of a relegation battle there is the struggle to claim the fifth and sixth play-off berths - a mini-battle that this year went down to the final day of the season in both conferences. The system works well, though it does have what the Eurosnobs regard as a fatal flaw: the team leading on points at the end of the regular season, which would be declared the champions under European procedure, has to enter the play-offs. An attempt to honour the points winner is made by awarding them the Supporters’ Shield, but this is really a non-event. And in the 20 MLS championships so far played, the top-points teams have won the MLS Cup only six times. ‘ ' 'Tn the US, there is no time soccer can be played without going up against a competing pro sport” 22 WORLD SOCCER England’s world cup story on a bog roll.

Buy the perfect gift this Christmas. £5.99 crapgoods.com BRITAIN’S N0.2™ FREE SHIPPING IN THE UK THE WORLD THIS MONTH Jim HOLDEN AT THE HEART OF THE GAME From l6 to 24: expanding the Euros has revitalised the competition Upset...lceland salute their supporters after a shock qualifying victory away to Holland in Amsterdam Critics of the expansion of the European Championship into a 24-team tournament - and there have been many of us - argued that one of the problems of the new set-up was the certainty of qualification that it would deliver to all the major nations. It would be impossible to fail, so it was said, thus depriving the qualifying groups of the tension and intrigue that is vital to the enjoyment of sport. Well, the demise of Holland has proved the sceptics wrong. They finished a meagre fourth in Group A and could not save themselves in the safety net of the play-offs. Their implosion has been an astonishing fall from grace for a country that played in the World Cup Final of 2010 and reached the semi-finals in 2014. Internal trauma can sometimes affect the Dutch, and certainly they had self-inflicted wounds, but that doesn’t fully explain what has occurred here. Holland's downfall was also due, in part, to the remarkable progress made by Iceland. Despite a tiny population of just 320,000 their national side fashioned triumphs home and away against Robin Van Persie and his fellow orange superstars. Iceland have been deserving architects of their own rise to glory rather than merely fortunate recipients of Dutch decay. A decade of investment in high-level coaching and high- tech indoor pitches have helped develop a generation of exceptional talent that includes Gylfi Sigurdsson and Alfred Finnbogason. In the past, due to the extremes of climate, they could play football for barely five months in and around Reykjavik, and the best youngsters always went abroad early. Now, an enviable system makes them punch well above their weight. Equally crucial for the Icelanders has been the psychological change provided by the Euro 2016 system. Opening up the tournament provided an opportunity for realistic ambition rather than hopeless dreaming - especially when they had the good sense to employ experienced Swedish coach Lars Lagerback. This was always part of the rationale of UEFA - and Iceland are not the only small and traditionally disregarded country to reap the benefits. The same incentive has inspired a resurgence of both Wales and Northern Ireland, while Albania - under the watchful eye of Italian coach Gianni De Biasi, who was once of Torino and Udinese - have also qualified for their first major tournament De Biasi started his reign in 2011, convinced about the merits of a young group of talented players, and vindication came with a qualifying group victory against Portugal and triumph in a friendly against France. Eventually, they qualified automatically, courtesy of a goalless draw away to Denmark. For Wales, it will also be a first participation in a European Championship tournament, while their one and only World Cup finals appearance was in the sepia-tinted era of 1958. It can only be to the tournament's benefit to see the world's most expensive player, Gareth Bale, in action. He will go where legends such as Ryan Giggs, Mark Hughes and Ian Rush all failed. If UEFA had kept to the old 16-team format, Iceland, Albania and Wales would all have missed out on automatic qualification, with no guarantee against being eliminated in the play-offs. Under the previous format, the lid could have been kept on the upstart outsiders - as the Champions League does so ruthlessly and as some critics would have preferred. Instead, the progress of the minnows has been met mostly with delight and they will add a welcome new flavour to Euro 2016. Their success will also serve to inspire others who have never qualified, such as Finland and Georgia. The 24-team tournament in France next summer will have its issues, but one of them cannot be the accusation that the competition is cluttered up by no-hopers. Anyone who believes that Iceland, Albania or Wales will be pushovers could be in for a rude awakening - just like the nonplussed stars of Holland.

Certainly it would cost Chelsea a fortune if he went so soon after signing a £30million, four-year contract, but then even such sums as this scarcely perturb Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich who, of course, has sacked Mourinho before. Against West Ham United, Mourinho's “crime\" was not only that Chelsea lost, but they lost playing dire, destructive football. And then there was the umpteenth clash with a referee, this one going on down the tunnel at half-time and involving a reported volley of abuse, followed by Mourinho's banishment to the stands. Chelsea's sudden catastrophic decline this season has reminded one that even last season, when they so commandingly won the Premier League, there were signs of potential decay. Not least in the European Cup, the greatest prize of all. Mourinho’s various triumphs testify to his undoubted talents. But plots can be lost, judgements may fail r Lonely figure..Jose Mourinho (back row, right) watches from the back of the directors' box after being sent to the stands at Upton Park when they were eliminated at Stamford Bridge by a Paris Saint-Germain team controversially reduced to 10 men by the disputable expulsion of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Mourinho's various triumphs with Portuguese, Italian and Spanish clubs testify to his undoubted talents. But plots can be lost, judgement may fail. Look at Alf Ramsey, without whose guidance and inspiration England would never have won the 1966 World Cup. Yet by the early 1970s he had so clearly lost his way, the nadir coming in 1972 with the two-legged European Championship quarter-final against the Germans. In the first leg, at Wembley, England had no ball winner in midfield, enabling Gunter Netzer to run riot. In the return, Ramsey made no real effort to chase the two-goal deficit, choosing what might politely be termed a team of hard men. After a bleak goalless draw, Netzer declared: \"The whole England team has autographed my leg\" Mourinho has certainly not resorted to that kind of dour selection, but he seems unable now to inspire his players. Blue gloom...Andy Carroll gets West Ham's winner 26 WORLD SOCCER Stanley Rous...from FA Cup Final referee to FIFA president FIFA candidates sink without trace Rous set the standard As I've said often enough before, football on the international scene is ineptly incompetent at running its own affairs. This was exemplified by the fact that whatever the malfeasances of Sepp Blatter, his predecessor Joao Havelange remained in office from 1974 to 1998, effectively unopposed for all his massive greed and chicanery, retiring with an estimated $30million at the very least. It reminds one yet again of the words of the 18th-century political philosopher Edmund Burke: “For evil to triumph, it is enough for good men to do nothing\" Passivity deplorably ruled for all those years and Havelange flourished like the green bay tree. Alas, there was no FBI then to do what should have been done. Once Stanley Rous had been deviously and corruptly ousted in his FIFA presidency by Havelange, villainy ruled. Neither in FIFA's presidency, all too plainly, nor even at the Football Association, has there ever been a proper successor to Rous. I do not mean to edify him, but he was principled, honest and an excellent administrator who had the good of the game at heart. During his 28-year reign as secretary of the Football Association, which he became soon after refereeing the 1934 FA Cup Final, he himself re-wrote the laws of the game and, for better or worse, brought the British countries back into the ranks of FIFA. He was, and arguably all to the good, an autocratic figure and something of a snob. It was he who kept Walter Winterbottom in office as England's team manager for an astonishing and excessive 16 years, despite offering the role to Jesse Carver - a secret that I kept for many years. As FIFA thresh around to find a new president, putting temporarily in the chair none other than Issa Hayatou, who has a record as long as your arm, one potential candidate after another lurks on the horizon only to disappear. Sheikh Salman from Bahrain seemed to be talking a good game until he was impugned for supposed complicity in the maltreatment of civil protesters. Now a new candidate. South African Tokyo Sexwale, has emerged, who perhaps may be elected by default. He could hardly be worse than the previous two incumbents. UEFA's Gianni Infantino? Uninspiring. Meanwhile, we learn Franz Beckenbauer and the Spaniard Angel Maria Villar Fiona have been \"the subjects of proceedings\" with the others over the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Apparently, Beckenbauer and Fiona face no charges over their behaviour in the actual bidding process. This, though an exhaustive Sunday Times FIFA investigation published a witness statement - so far unchallenged - that Beckenbauer had been paid by the Under investigation... Russians, while his meetings with Qatari Franz Beckenbauer representatives have been duly chronicled. Rabbatts right, Chelsea wrong The lingering case of former Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro simply will not fade away. Now it has involved the estimable Heather Rabbatts, who well deserves a focal place in the FA's otherwise all male and, in the immortal words of its chairman Greg Dyke, otherwise “hideously white\" hierarchy. Where Ms Rabbatts was absolutely right was to question the casual and peremptory way in which an FA alleged investigation decided that Mourinho had no case to answer for allegedly abusing Dr Carneira. He was accused of yelling at the Gibraltarian the Portuguese words \"filha da puta\", meaning “daughter of a whore\". The FA inquiry trotted out an expert who declared that what he had said Speaking out... Heather Rabbatts has attacked the FA’S handling of the Carneiro case was Jilho da puta\", meaning son of a whore. Which in context made no sense whatsoever and was in any case contradicted by several Portuguese speakers who had heard the words. I need hardly remind you that in running on to the field to tend a prone Eden Hazard - very late in the game, but so what? - Dr Carneira, who had actually been called on by the referee, had no alternative but to comply. That Mourinho should so frequently whinge and whine about the way the FA have treated him and his behaviour, while being so controversially let off so serious a charge, seems ludicrous to a degree. And Dr Carneira wasn't even interviewed. Just as ludicrous is the perverse behaviour of two senior FA councillors, the elderly Ron Barston and Richard Tur, who have absurdly demanded an inquiry into Ms Rabbatts' impeccable behaviour, insisting she has breached FA rules. Which brings echoes of the Dickensian character Mr Bumble who opined memorably: “If the law supposes that, then the law is an ass\" Good to know that Dr Carneira is suing Chelsea for effectively forcing her out of a job she was doing conscientiously and well. Mourinho should never have been allowed to treat her so badly without sanction. # Read Brian Glanville^s weekly online column at worldsoccer.com WORLD SOCCER 27 LBVellsiGGGr www.lovellsoccer.co.uk t ' 1^7 Mercurial Including FREE ID Nike CR7 Mercurial Superfly FG - £249.99 Including FREE ID at Lovell Soccer Product code: 28496 CR7 Mercurial Lava Collection An unpredictable force of nature, exploding into action with no advance warning.

In 1973, Abrahamyan was in goal as Ararat won the Soviet league-and-cup double, and the following season they reached the European Cup quarter-finals. A 70,000 crowd saw them beat Bayern Munich 1-0, before the Germans edged through 2-1 on aggregate and went on to win the European Cup. Four decades on and independence from the Soviet Union has done little for football in Armenia. Abrahamyan is now Ararat's goal keeping coach but, after multiple changes of ownership and financial failures, the club is unrecognisable from the one he played for. The crowds have gone too. Abrahamyan is one of barely 100 people watching as Ararat fall behind to bottom-of-the-table Ulisses. American midfielder Bryan De la Fuente scores two fine second-half goals to rescue a win, but the match - like most in the Armenian Premier League - is a desultory affair. De la Fuente tries to talk up Armenian football. \"The crowds are small but they are loyal,\" he says without a flicker of irony. Previously, he played in MLS for the now defunct Chivas USA, but he admits his Close...Henrikh Mkhitaryan (left) in a 2014 World Cup qualifier second season in Armenia will be his last. After the game, a handful of young Armenian web journalists surround Ararat coach Varuzhan Sukiasyan for a quote as the tiny crowd quickly vanishes into the Yerevan night. After his side finished bottom of the table last season, Sukiasyan is under pressure to make improvements, but expectations are low at Ararat and in the wider Armenian domestic game. In the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, the national side came within a match of making the play-offs. But despite the success of Henrikh Mkhitaryan at Borussia Dortmund, they have since I struggled and coach Bernard Challandes left this summer. That brief international I success masked a domestic ' game at its lowest ebb. ; In the 2014-15 Champions League, Banants were humiliatingly knocked out in the first qualifying round by FC Santa Coloma of Andorra. No Andorran side had ever won a Champions League tie before. Armenian football is “The league itself is not competitive. The interest is not big” Hayk Karapetyan, Football Federation of Armenia nearly at rock bottom. In UEFA's 2016-17 access list, the Armenian Premier League is only ranked above Andorra, San Marino and Gibraltar - places where the club game is amateur or part-time at best and only three teams qualify for Europe. The implications for Armenian football of falling any lower are dire. At present, half of the eight APL clubs 30 WORLD SOCCER qualify for European competition, which offers the only real source of outside funding for club owners such as Bagrat Navoyan of Alashkert, as running an APL club costs up to €2million a season. A local travel agent, Navoyan took the brave if not foolhardy step of setting up a new club in 2012, with the club named after the village - in what is now Turkey - that his Armenian grandparents fled from to escape Turkish genocide a century ago. This season, Alashkert made their European debut, but after beating Scotland's St Johnstone they fell in the second qualifying round of the Europa League to Kazakhstan's Kairat. The €10,000 they earned may be small change for Europe's elite, but not in Armenia. Sitting in the Yerevan office of his company Bagratours, Navoyan leans back in his chair to show where Alashkert's funding comes from. “Here,\" he says, patting the wallet in his trouser pocket. He claims to have had offers from Belarus and Scotland of €100,000 for striker Mihran Manasyan, but he is holding out for more. If Manasyan does get sold, it will be something of a watershed. Some overseas players in Armenia can earn up to $5,000 a month but most locals average $1,000. Many are seeking an exit, but Armenians, with the exception of Mkhitaryan and a handful of others, are not in demand. This summer, a host of Armenian players went for trials in search of a professional contract overseas but not one of them succeeded. \"No one is trying to speak about the quality;' sighs veteran journalist Zaven Vardanyan, who has been covering Armenian football for decades and believes the game is at its lowest ebb. At least those players still have clubs at home. A few years ago, the APL shrank to just eight sides after four teams - Cement WORLD SOCCER 31 eyewitness Ararat Town, Kilikia Yerevan, Zenith Yerevan and Yerevan United - were suddenly closed down. Before this season kicked off, Mika and Ulisses both came close to folding. There is no market for players from such a low-grade league, nor any other source of income for club owners such as Navoyan. When second-place Alashkert host leaders Pyunik in Yerevan, Armenian Public Television belatedly agrees to screen the game. However, they stipulate that this will only happen if the kick-off is shifted back by an hour. And even then there is no fee for Navoyan. More than 300 people turn up to watch Pyunik ease home 4-1. Yet there is not even compensation of money from the gate for Alashkert who, like all APL clubs from Yerevan, do not charge for entry. ‘The league itself is not competitive. The interest is not big,\" admits Hayk Karapetyan, media officer at the Football Federation of Armenia (AFF). Only a madman would contemplate starting up a club in this financial environment but Navoyan, like many of the Armenians who are involved in domestic football, prefers to think of himself as a patriot. \"To improve Armenian football, I try to take my players from Armenia and I take just three players from overseas,\" he says proudly. The only rule on foreign players is that APL clubs must have an Armenian goalkeeper. National keeper Roman Berezovsky, who is the country's second-most capped player of all time, was 40 when he finally retired this summer and the rule was brought in by the AFF in an attempt to give game time to potential successors. With no limit on outfield players, clubs such as Mika and Ulisses use a swathe of overseas players from places as diverse as Scout...Khoren Kalayshan the USA, Brazil, Peru, Congo, Cameroon, Mali and Nigeria. Armenian football is a free-for-all with agents using the game as a last resort, but many of these agencies are not even based in Armenia. One of the biggest.

ROMAN BEREZOVSKY Armenia's second-most capped player retired this summer and is now goalkeeping coach with Dynamo Moscow. SARGIS HOVSEPYAN With 131 caps, he is the country's most capped player and was interim coach after Bernard Challandes left this summer. ■'n HENRIKH MKHITARYAN National team captain, the attacking midfielder was dogged with injury in 2014-15 but is finding his form this season. BAGRAT NAVOYAN Runs the Bagratours travel agency and funds Alashkert, who are challenging Pyunik's dominance of the local club scene. 32 WORLD SOCCER suffered the Turkish genocide, the suffocating blanket of communism, the 1988 Spitak earthquake and a war in 1992 with neighbouring Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh. Millions left in search of a better life, but three million people still live in Armenia, with two or even three times that number living abroad. Kalayshan is scouring the diaspora for players and has brought more than half a dozen youngsters to the attention of the AFF - including CSKA Moscow teenager Grigori Emeksuzyan, who was born in Sochi to Armenian emigres, and David Martirosyan of Czech side Teplice. Despite the financial absurdity of the Armenian club game, Kalayshan points to the transformation of Kazakh domestic football and argues for more investment. “There are only eight teams and they play each other four times; for the players, I don't think it is so interesting,\" he says. “The persons who are investing in Armenian football are heroes. They get the money from their business and put it into football. There is no income. To think of income is ridiculous. First you must invest. The Armenian Premier League needs 10 or 12 clubs\" Kalayshan is quick to praise not just the owners but also AFF president, Ruben Flayrapetyan. In power for more than a decade, Hayrapetyan controls Armenian football unchallenged due to his political connections. Tom Jones, an Englishman who was assistant to Armenia coach Ian Porterfield until the ex-Chelsea manager's death in 2007, remembers Hayrapetyan as a remote figure who did not deign to speak to underlings. “You couldn't just go and speak to him,\" says Jones. Hayrapetyan is widely believed to “The persons who are investing in Armenian football are heroes” Loyal...a supporter of Ararat Armenian agent Khoren Kalayshan control Pyunik, whose claim of third-party ownership on Mkhitaryan deterred the likes of Liverpool when the player sought to leave Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013.

With close connections to the government, he is unlikely to face a challenge in the next elections despite Armenian club football hitting rock bottom. W5 Armenia: 2015 PREMIER LEAGUE THE CLUBS ^ALASHKERT Only formed in 2012, they qualified for this season's Europa League. Owner Bagrat Navoyan recently bought the crumbling Nairi Stadium, which has been renamed the Alashkert Stadium. ^ARARAT YEREVAN The country's best-known outfit are the same in name only to the team that won the Soviet league-and-cup double in 1973. The current club is owned by expats Hratch Kaprielan and Vardan Srmakesh, who live in the USA and Switzerland respectively. Ararat play at the Republic Stadium but finished bottom of the league last season and continue to struggle. V^BANANTS The original club was formed in 1992 and after an ill-fated merger with Kotayk of Abovyan, Banants split in 2001 and moved to Yerevan. Now owned by billionaire industrialist Oleg Mkrtcyhan, who is Armenia's richest man and has held stakes in Ukrainian side Metalurh Donetsk and Kuban Krasnodar of Russia. GANDZASAR One of two clubs from the provinces, the Kapan-based side were founded in 2002 and are owned by copper magnate Maxim Hakubyan. They were second from bottom last term. MIKA Traditionally a heavy user of overseas talent, the club is part of Russian-based expat Michael Baghdasarov's Mika Corporation, whose interests include a chain of petrol stations. Winner of 13 titles, including 10 in a row up to 2011-12. Champions again in 2014-15 and on course to retain the title this season, they play at the Republic Stadium. Sanvel Hayrapetyan is nominal chairman to satisfy UEFA rules but his father Ruben, who is the president of the Football Federation of Armenia, controls the club. SHIRAK Founded in 1958 and based in Gyumri, the club is owned by politician Arman Sahakyan. They have won the Premier League four times, most recently in 2012-13, and finished third in 2014-15. ULISSES A heavy user of overseas players, the Yerevan-based club won the 2012-13 title but have no real fan base and came close to folding this summer. Owner Genrikh Kazanjian, who controls the Holiday Group, looks to be selling up. WORLD SOCCER 33 military parade of ballistic missiles, Serbia broke away and scored twice in injury time, leaving the crowd silent and the Albanian players bereft. Serbia’s players and officials celebrated as if they had won the whole tournament itself. “We approached the last minutes trying to keep my players focused,\" said Albania's captain, Lorik Cana, after the game. \"We knew we had the opportunity to qualify tonight. We wanted to reach qualification tonight, in our land, in front of our people\" All was not yet lost, however. There would be one last chance, against Armenia in Yerevan three days later. Few had given Albania much of a James Montague reports from Tirana I ALBANIA Qualification against all odds Albania may have lost to bitter rivals Serbia, but they still made it to Euro 2016 It certainly looked and felt as if the greatest opportunity in the national team's history had slipped through their fingers. The final whistle had just been blown at a drenched Elbasan Arena and Albania had been beaten 2-0 by Serbia in their penultimate Euro 2016 qualification game. Most of Albania's players were laying on their backs, distraught, as Serbia celebrated victory in what had become a match dominated by international politics and history as much as football. On paper, Serbia had nothing to play for. Yet the manner of their failure to qualify for France next summer was tinged with a sense of injustice. They had effectively been eliminated following the reverse fixture last year, when violence broke out after a drone was flown into the Partizan Stadium carrying a banner festooned with Albanian nationalist symbols. The match was abandoned, Albania were awarded the three points and Serbia docked a further three - after an unsuccessful trip to the Court of Arbitration for Sport - for failing to control their fans. But with a bad taste enduring from that match, added to an already combustible atmosphere - due to the rivalry between the two nations that came to the fore following the 1999 Kosovo War, which pitted the majority ethnic Albanian Kosovars against the Serbs - the match was always more than simply a dead rubber. In pure footballing terms, at least, Albania did have something to play for. The Balkan country had enjoyed a superb 2016 European Championship qualification campaign which had brought them to the verge of reaching their first-ever finals of a major tournament. All they needed, with results going their way, was victory against Serbia. Instead, in a match played under the kind of security reserved for dictatorships arranging a 34 WORLD SOCCER chance when the draw for Euro 2016 qualification was made. Despite the newly expanded format opening up new routes for smaller nations, Portugal, Denmark and Serbia appeared, on paper at least, too strong a triumvirate to break. A nation of just two million people, Albania had always produced talented players, at least from its diaspora. Following the region’s periodic wars, pockets of ethnic Albanians live across the Balkans - from Kosovo and Macedonia to Serbia and beyond, not to mention those that resettled in Switzerland, the USA, Italy and France. Over the past decades many ethnic Security...police search a fan outside the stadium before the Serbia game Albanians have chosen to represent their adopted homes. Take Switzerland’s national side for example. Xherdan Shaqiri was born in Kosovo and even wears an Albanian flag on his boots, yet he plays internationally for the Swiss. And he has been joined in that decision by Granit Xhaka, Blerim Dzemaili and Valon Behrami - all of whom consider themselves to be ethnic Albanians. But the current Albania team is a mix of diaspora players who, in many cases, chose to represent the country of their parents’ birth, mixed with some old hands. Granit’s Swiss-born brother Taulant Xhaka chose to represent Albania rather than WORLD SOCCER 35 eyewitness Switzerland. Close to half the current team were born or have roots in Kosovo, including Lazio goalkeeper Etrit Berisha, who was born there. And then there is skipper Cana, who was born in Kosovo but fled during the disintegration of Yugoslavia to become a refugee in Switzerland. An opening fixture away to Portugal was the toughest first step towards the Euro finals imaginable for Albania's Italian coach, Gianni De Biasi. But a stunning 1-0 victory thanks to a goal from Bekim Balaj, followed by two draws with Denmark and a victory at home to Armenia, gave the team the perfect platform for an unlikely shot at qualification. Yet it was the game in Belgrade that would define both Albania and Serbia's Flashpoint...a drone towing a flag bearing a pro-Albanian sentiment flies over the Partizan Stadium qualification campaigns. Tensions were already high in the Partizan Stadium during the match; flares were thrown onto the pitch, and chants of \"Kosovo is Serbia\" and \"Kill the Albanians\" could already be heard from the crowd when, in the 42nd minute, a drone entered the stadium. When Serbian defender Stefan Mitrovic tried to take the flag down, it sparked a confrontation on the pitch that ended with the drone. Cana described how all the Albanian players' bags were searched by Serbian authorities looking for the remote control. In the end, it wasn't the brother of the Albanian PM, nor one of the players who were responsible. It was a 33-year-old crane operator Ismail Morinaj, who had concocted the plan and was flying the drone from a nearby cathedral tower. \"When the drone and flag entered the stadium, there was 20 seconds of silence,\" Morinaj said in an interview shortly before the return match in Elbasan. Morinaj's role in Albania's Euro qualification can not be overlooked. He is considered something of a national hero now and, although he vehemently claims National hero...lsmall Morinaj (with scarf) at the qualifier against Denmark the Albania players fleeing to the tunnel under a hail of objects and fists as some of the crowd came onto the pitch. \"When we saw the fans on the pitch attacking us, this was something completely out of control,\" recalled Cana. \"I was really scared for my players, to be honest, because I could see that they were coming from everywhere. [Aleksandar] Kolarov and [Serbia captain Branislav] Ivanovic, they really tried to protect us. \"If they hadn't tried to do that then we would have been in a big mess\" At first, the brother of Albanian prime minister Edi Rama was blamed for flying “Too many people say the three points were because of me.

We drew in Denmark. \"I can say that what I did was to raise the patriotic feelings\" As the return match against Serbia approached, the authorities took no 36 WORLD SOCCER ALBANIA chances with the security and, shortly after our interview, Morinaj - who had admitted to carrying a gun for protection because of the sheer number of death threats he received from Serbian Facebook accounts - was arrested.

In the end, there was no trouble, even Heroes...prime minister Edi Rama greets the team on their return from Armenia though, as torrential rain fell, Serbia snatched a late, late victory. The supporters of Albania's national team - the \"Red and Black\", who had chanted for the release of Morinaj throughout the game - left quietly. The streets of Elbasan were empty within an hour. Cana looked on the bright side and said: “We still have a massive chance to win in Armenia and reach the qualification. Sometimes, the more difficult things are, the more beautiful things are\" In the end, the Armenia game was surprisingly straightforward. Albania ran out 3-0 winners and secured their place in France next summer. As hard as this campaign has been, qualification might be considerably harder in the future. It is likely that Kosovo, after a lengthy campaign, will be recognised by UEFA and FIFA early next year, with the Football Federation of Kosovo convinced that they will be admitted in time to join qualification for the 2018 World Cup. If that happens, it would likely cut off what has become an important supply line of talent for the Albanian national team. But no one was thinking about that after the Armenia game. As tens of thousands celebrated in Tirana, Paris and Zurich, Cana and his team-mates were invited to the Albanian Prime Minister’s residence in front of cheering crowds, greeted as returning heroes. Meanwhile, Ismail Morinaj, Albania's forgotten hero, remains in jail.

Once upon a time, Turkish football was considered an also-ran on the European stage. The national team, infamously, could not cope with away-game pressure and never qualified for the big tournaments, while club sides had history but little else. Now, however, over the past two decades, everything has changed. There are no easy games against Turkish teams any more, with Galatasaray and Fenerbahce boasting training grounds that are the envy of many of western Europe's bigger and more internationally successful clubs. These days, big-name players head for the Super Lig in expectation of far more than a last- contract pay day. Absent from the finals of the World Cup and European Championship since reaching the last four at Euro 2008, the national side will be strutting its stuff in Europa campalgn...Gokhan Tore of Besiktas France this summer, while the country's leading clubs strive to prove themselves in the Champions and Europa Leagues. All this comes against a highly complex political backdrop which has seen Turkey drawn ever more into international focus - which is perhaps inevitable for a country whose borders stretch from Bulgaria and Greece to the west, right across the continental divide to Georgia and Iran in the east, and then on Syria and Iraq to the south. Entangled are long-drawn-out negotiations about moving closer to * 38 WORLD SOCCER WORLD SOCCER 39 eyewitness \"the west\" through proposals for European Union membership, which are set against the internal tensions prompted by the increasingly authoritarian ambitions of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party. Rumbling in the background is unrest over corruption talk which has produced regular tidal flows in first one direction and then another, and left no sector of Turkish society untouched; not even football. The three biggest Turkish clubs continue to dominate domestically: recent league leaders Besiktas, defending champions Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, who are deemed the most popular and independent of the three. Abroad, Besiktas made a steady start in the Europa League, while Galatasaray revived hopes of Champions League progress with a 2-1 win at home to Benfica after conceding a 90-second opening goal. Fenerbahce made an initial muddle of their own Europa League campaign, but they also have serious issues with European competition and UEFA which continue to cast a long shadow of resentment over every game. In 2012, Fener president Aziz Yildirim, a multi-millionaire developer, was sentenced to jail and fined $560,000 for conspiracy and match-fixing during the 2010-2011 season. The match-fix case was a sensation, partly because it appeared to prove what rivals had regularly claimed, and partly because of its extent. A year earlier, police raids on homes and football club premises led to 61 arrests in connection with 19 matches in the top two divisions - with those 61 including officials from Fenerbahce and Besiktas. Accusations focused on 26 cases in the top two Turkish divisions as well as others in basketball. Fenerbahce links were alleged in 15 of the 19 top-flight cases, of which five concerned the grey area issue of so-called “third-party bonuses\". In August 2011, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) barred Fenerbahce from the Champions League and gave their place to their rivals, Trabzonspor. UEFA duly banned Fener from European competition for two years and Besiktas for one season. Fenerbahce went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and demanded Loyal...Galatasaray supporters get in the mood for the derby with Besiktas Either everything is perfect or it is terrible” Fenerbahce coach Vitor Pereira on Turkish passion for football Pressure...Fenerbahce fans demonstrate in support of president Aziz Yildrim €45million compensation from UEFA. But before the case could come before sport’s supreme court, UEFA flew to Istanbul for its annual congress. President Michel Platini suggested to Erdogan that the domestic stand-off was an embarrassment for European football and did the image of the Turkish game no favours at an increasingly delicate time, politically. Suddenly, Fenerbahce withdrew its CAS appeal amid reports that the TFF would cough up most of the €45m. Simultaneously, an internal TFF report effectively cleared the club of wrongdoing. Fenerbahce supporters claimed the case had been manipulated by political and commercial rivals of both Yildirim and the club itself, while Yildirim insisted the match-fixing case was a politically motivated plot hatched by followers of the influential United States-based Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen. Prosecutors countered that the case arose as a consequence of investigations prompted by the Bochum football corruption trial in Germany. On a wider sports scale, the scandal and confusion cast a fatal pall across Istanbul's bid to win hosting rights for the 2020 Olympic Games and/or the finals of that year’s European Championship. The Olympics would be awarded to Tokyo, while Platini devised his pan-continental Euro 2020 plan as a reaction to the lack of a trusted candidate. 40 WORLD SOCCER TURKEY Conflict with coach...Robin Van Persie After a year in prison, Yildirim was freed in 2012 pending a retrial. Meanwhile, the hated \"Special Court\" system under which he had been convicted was scrapped. In October 2015, he and his fellow defendants were cleared of all charges. Not that this is the end of the matter. Fenerbahce are still considering a lawsuit against UEFA and Platini for damages. Anger towards Platini was raised to fever pitch by the Swiss justice authorities' investigation of UEFA’s president for accepting the now-infamous “disloyal payment\" from FIFA authorised by Sepp Blatter on the basis of a verbal contract. The heat generated by football in Turkey has come as a shock to Fenerbahce's Portuguese coach Vitor Pereira. Coping with language problems on the training pitch was one problem, but greater than that was the passion-driven impatience. “I always thought that in Portugal we were very emotional,\" says Pereira. “But when I came to Turkey, I found that they are even more emotional and passionate about football than us. Either everything is perfect or it is terrible. “In Portugal we play our football with 50 per cent heart and 50 per cent head. But here, it's 80 per cent heart and only about 20 per cent tactical stuff. This means that sometimes in defence we lose our balance because, under pressure, the players forget all our tactical planning. Fenerbahce have made a huge investment in new players but it takes time to cook the food to get the taste I want. We have too many national-team breaks when all our players go away for a week. “I want us to play a passing game, dominating possession, but I haven't been able to build the team I want as quickly as I want - and we haven't been providing the results and level of performance the fans want. Time is short and we always need results. I came with a two-year project in my mind but here, for the fans, the project is only the next game\" That demand for instant success led to tension between Pereira and Robin Van Persie. The Dutchman arrived from Manchester United to a hero's welcome in the summer, but the fitness issues which dogged his last season at Old Trafford have THE BIG 3 GALATASARAY Founded: 1905 League champions 20 (record) Turkish Cup winners 16 (record) UEFA Cup winners 2000 UEFA Super Cup winners 2000 Stadium: Turk Telecom Arena (52,652) FENERBAHCE Founded: 1907 League champions 19 Turkish Cup winners 6 Stadium: Sukru Saracoglu (53,715) -H* BESIKTAS Founded: 1903 League champions 13 Turkish Cup winners 9 Stadium: Vodafone Arena (41,903) followed him to Turkey, with he and Pereira disagreeing over how and when he should be used, creating more negative headlines. “No one likes to be on the bench, especially when, even if you are 30 or 31 or 32 or 33, you still have your ambition,\" said Pereira. “So I prefer a player to be angry. Sometimes conflict between players and the coach is a problem but often it's a good sign. Football is competitive. You have to try to prove every day to the coach that you are the best player^’ Like Pereira at Fener, Flamza Flamzaoglu of Galatasaray and Besiktas' Senol Gunes will be judged by their results in the derby games and then - if they make it that far - where their clubs stand at the end of the season. Patience does not come into it, and Pereira's eyes were opened by his first few days in Istanbul after arriving from a double-winning success in Greece with Olympiakos. “The first week was incredible,\" said the 47-year-old. “I couldn't walk down the street. When the people here like a coach or a player it's amazing. Flere they have football in the blood. When they are born, when they are babes in arms, it's already there. It’s wonderful but it also creates problems because the passion is all about the next game. Then the next, then the next...\" And, for a coach, the next job. WS BESIKTAS 2km I FENERBAHCE WORLD SOCCER 41 Tom Kundert reports from Lisbon ■ PORTUGAL Jesus triumphs on return to Estadio da Luz Sporting coach humiliates his former club Benfica in Lisbon’s ‘eternal derby’ Sporting's magnificent trio of home-grown talents William Carvalho, Adrien Silva and Joao Mario. “If you'd have asked me before the game if we'd win 3-0 I'd have said no, but if you'd have asked me if we'd win I would have said yes,'' was one of Jesus's more modest comments in the post-match press conference. Never needing encouragement to blow his own trumpet and belittle his opponents, the 61-year-old did not fail to fire a trademark barb at his opposite A more categorical triumph was impossible to imagine. On October 25, Sporting made the short three-mile trip to neighbours Benfica and swept to victory in one of the most keenly anticipated Lisbon derbies in decades. The 3-0 winning margin was an accurate reflection of the difference between the two sides. It was Sporting's first Primeira Liga win at their rival's home since 2006 and their biggest margin of victory there since the 1947-48 season. For Benfica, the notion that history was being made in a negative sense only added to the sense of despair, and an increasing certainty on a rainy Sunday afternoon for the vast majority of the 65,000 crowd: the club's decision to let coach Jorge Jesus go, and above all to their bitter local rivals, was a blunder of catastrophic proportions. The lead-up to the game had inevitably centred on Jesus, the controversial and charismatic coach who had crossed the great divide after six success-strewn years at Benfica. It had also involved mudslinging The bad blood between the clubs is unlikely to be cleansed any time soon, but on the pitch there was only one winner. From the moment Teofilo Gutierrez pounced to give Sporting the lead in the 9th minute, the visiting side exuded total dominance. A brilliant Islam Slimani header and a Bryan Ruiz goal made it 3-0 after only 36 minutes. No further goals were added, yet the Lions' second-half performance was just as impressive, completely controlling proceedings against a listless Benfica unable to cope with the midfield stranglehold exercised by of the highest order. Sporting's irascible president Bruno de Carvalho had launched a tirade of daily attacks against Benfica in the media, accusing them of routinely attempting to bribe referees by offering them a generous array of gifts before matches. The Eagles responded by announcing they were suing Jorge Jesus for €14 million for starting work at Sporting while still under contract at Benfica, and for taking confidential software with him when switching from the Luz to the Alvalade. Derby success...Sporting boss Jorge Jesus 42 WORLD SOCCER number Rui Vitoria. “If I wanted I could make Rui Vitoria this small,\" said JJ, putting his thumb and index finger close together, “but I won’t out of respect\" It would have been difficult to utter a more disrespectful comment. But like compatriot Jose Mourinho, Jorge Jesus has earned the right, certainly in the domestic context, to get away with a gargantuan level of arrogance. “I am used to having great moments here [at the Luz]\" That is an irrefutable fact. In six years as Benfica coach Jesus did not lose a single Early strike...Teofilo Gutierrez scores Sporting's first goal one of his 92 Liga games played in his home stadium, and his side failed to score in only one of them. Jesus appears to have taken the magic with him to the club he represented in his playing days. The derby victory put Sporting two points clear of 2nd-placed Porto at the top of the table. Sporting president Carvalho firmly believes his new coach is another ‘special one! 'Jose Mourinho is a wonderful coach. Jorge is an amazing coach. Like Messi and Ronaldo, they are the greatest,\" he told BBC prior to the match. Jesus’s track record in what is known in Portugal as the eternal derby is beyond reproach. As Benfica coach, Jesus had won 10, drawn four and lost just one of 15 matches between the two sides. Since switching to the green half of the city, he has won two out of two. “The message I passed to my players is that beating Benfica has to become a normal occurrence,\" said Jesus. With him at the helm, there is surely every chance of that happening. WORLD SOCCER 43 Striking sensations John Holmesdale profiles Europe’s most in-form forwards Pierre-Emerick AUBAMEYANG BORUSSIA DORTMUND When the extremely self-confident Borussia Dortmund striker went public in the summer with his intention to score at least 20 goals in the Bundesliga this term, the reaction of many in Germany was that he was putting too much pressure on himself. But after scoring 13 in his first 10 starts, it's beginning to look as if he was being too cautious. No other Dortmund player has ever netted so many times at the start of a domestic season, and as proved by back-to-back hat-tricks against Augsburg in the Bundesliga and the Azerbaijanis of Qabala in the Europa League, he is not easily satisfied. Once pigeonholed as a rather lightweight speed merchant, albeit with an eye for goal, the Gabon international has developed a more rounded and effective game since quitting Ligue 1 Saint-Etienne in 2013 for Dortmund. Under the considerable influence of Jurgen Klopp, he added strength, awareness and consistency to his repertoire, while the deci"
