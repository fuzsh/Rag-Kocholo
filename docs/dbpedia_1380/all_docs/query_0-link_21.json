        "text": "World Cup stars In Transfer Window\n\nEvery player will be out to make an impact at the World Cup in Russia but several, whose club futures remain unclear, will be especially desperate to shine.\n\nWhether it is a contract wrangle or a potential transfer in the pipeline, these players are sure to want to catch the eye on the biggest stage...\n\nXherdan Shaqiri\n\nIn a world of media-trained footballers, Stoke and Switzerland forward Xherdan Shaqiri is a player not afraid to let the world know what he really thinks\n\n\"It is no secret that I will leave the club,\" the man who suffered relegation with the Potters told Swiss newspaper Aargauer Zeitung this week. \"I would love to stay in England, I think the league is perfect for me. It's the best league with the best players, but I do not want to exclude anything.\"\n\nSwitzerland won nine of their 10 qualifiers for Russia but though they were pipped to automatic qualification by Portugal, they negotiated their way past Northern Ireland in a play-off to book another summer at a major tournament.\n\nVladimir Petkovic's side will fancy their chances of reaching the last 16 with Serbia and Costa Rica in their group and leading light Shaqiri will be out to impress watching scouts. A repeat of the stunning bicycle-kick he scored against Poland at Euro 2016 would be just the job.\n\nMarouane Fellaini\n\nWhile Marouane Fellaini is unlikely to be a starter for Belgium, he is very much Plan B from the bench, with his aerial prowess offering a different option, as it has at Manchester United this season.\n\nArsenal have been heavily linked with a move for the 30-year-old, who is out of contract at the end of the month having failed so far to agree a new deal at Old Trafford.\n\nIt did appear that Fellaini was on his way to AC Milan, but Arsenal - whose manager Unai Emery is reportedly a fan - are now keen to pounce, according to reports in the British press.\n\n\"We know he is not going to renew with United, but it's difficult to say that we have closed the deal,\" AC Milan sporting director Massimiliano Mirabelli said two weeks ago.\n\nShould nothing be finalised soon, Fellaini's focus will be on excelling in Russia, where an impact against England in Belgium's final group game could go a long way to earning him another big summer move.\n\nToby Alderweireld\n\nOne Belgian who is almost certain of a starting berth, though, is Toby Alderweireld, despite falling out of favour at Tottenham as talks over a new deal have failed to result in an agreement.\n\nJose Mourinho has reportedly handed Manchester United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward a list of transfer targets that includes Alderweireld. The Belgium international has just over a year left on his current contract, which includes a one-year extension option, but he appears no closer to signing a new contract.\n\nToby Alderweireld has fallen out of favour as his contract saga has dragged on\n\nAlderweireld told Belgian newspaper De Zondag: \"I have another two years contract. Tottenham decides about my future. Of course I have my own idea. But that is not the case now.\"\n\nBelgium's back three of Vincent Kompany, Alderweireld and Alderweireld's Spurs team-mate Jan Vertonghen is very much a tried and trusted rearguard. Should Belgium go all the way, or close, with Alderweireld reminding the watching suitors of his prowess after playing a bit-part role for Spurs this past season, Mauricio Pochettino could expect some offers for the 29-year-old in the coming months.\n\nGoncalo Guedes\n\nIt seemed the permanent transfer of Goncalo Guedes from Paris Saint-Germain to Valencia was a done deal, but as talks have stalled, Premier League newcomers Wolves have been linked with a late swoop, according to reports in France.\n\nGoncalo Guedes's agent Jorge Mendes could have a say on his future\n\nGuedes is expected to be sold by PSG this summer due to their need to fulfil their Financial Fair Play obligations, and with Guedes a client of Jorge Mendes, who has strong connections at Wolves, Valencia, who have had Guedes impressing on loan this season, could miss out.\n\n\"We know that [Valencia owner] Peter Lim is trying to sign Goncalo but it depends on many factors,\" Guedes' father Rogerio Guedes told Tribuna Deportiva.\n\nGuedes is yet to score for Portugal, but could form a new-look forward line alongside AC Milan's Andre Silva and Cristiano Ronaldo for the European champions. Impressing in Russia will certainly go a long way to enhance this burgeoning forward's stock.\n\nAlisson\n\nIt's reported Liverpool's interest in Roma goalkeeper Alisson at the start of the year but transfer talk over a potential new No 1 at Anfield has gathered pace since Loris Karius' mistakes in the Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid.\n\nDespite having coveted the Brazilian for some time, it seems Liverpool have some competition for his signature.\n\n\"I understand he is very happy at Roma but there is interest not only from Liverpool but from Real Madrid too,\" South American football expert Tim Vickery told Sky Sports. \"The asking price could increase or decrease depending on what happens during the World Cup. He's an excellent goalkeeper.\"\n\nKeeping Manchester City stopper Ederson out of the side, Roma's Allison certainly has made the jersey his own with some fine displays for the Selecao. With Brazil so heavily fancied to go all the way in Russia, those unaware of Allison's athletic ability could well have their heads turned this summer.\n\nMateo Kovacic\n\nMateo Kovacic joined fellow countryman Luka Modric at Real Madrid in 2015 hoping to elevate his career to the next level but, like many others before him, has found himself on the periphery, unable to break into the first team on a regular basis. Now, the 24-year-old knows his playing time has to increase - and appears open to suitors.\n\n\"I believe I'll play more, whether in Real or somewhere else,\" he told reporters ahead of the tournament. \"Now is the time for me to play.\"\n\nMateo Kovacic will be keen to takes his chance in Russia\n\nKovacic made 36 appearances for Madrid in 2017-18, starting just 10 of his 21 La Liga games.\n\nWhile he is also not a guaranteed starter, the fact many see Croatia as dark horses could allow Kovacic the chance to showcase his talents. Several reports in the British media claim Jose Mourinho is a fan.\n\nKi Sung-yueng\n\nKi Sung-yeung is heading to the World Cup with South Korea but he will soon be looking for a new club employer.\n\nThe 29-year-old announced he would be leaving Swansea in the wake of their relegation to the Championship and will be out of contract at the Liberty Stadium come the end of the month.\n\nKi Sung-yueng announced he would be leaving Swansea after their relegation\n\nSky Sports reported in April that Everton were one of five Premier League clubs keen on signing him, along with Italian side AC Milan. Making an impression in Group F - against Germany, Mexico, Sweden - could reignite interest.\n\nEngland :West Ham signs Rayn Fredericks\n\nWest Ham have confirmed the signing of right-back Ryan Fredericks from Fulham.\n\nThe 25-year-old has signed a four-year contract to become new manager Manuel Pellegrini's first signing when his present terms with Fulham expire from July 1.\n\n\"It's amazing for this deal to finally happen,\" Fredericks told his new club's official website. \"I know we've been speaking about it for a while and trying to get things in place and finally, we've got it over the line. I'm just buzzing to be here.\n\n\"West Ham United is one of the biggest clubs in the Premier League. Everyone knows the history of West Ham and there's a lot of factors that brought me to the club.\n\n\"Obviously, it's an exciting time for West Ham. The club have just brought in a new manager in Manuel Pellegrini and everyone knows his CV and what he has done in England before and in other leagues as well. I'm sure I can learn a lot from him.\"\n\nFredericks missed just four of Fulham's 52 matches in all competitions last season as he helped them win promotion to the Premier League and was named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year.\n\nPellegrini feels Fredericks is still improving and is looking forward to working with him.\n\nThe Chilean said: \"I am very pleased to welcome Ryan to West Ham United as our first signing this summer. He joins having had a successful season with Fulham and is a player who will bring great qualities to our squad.\n\n\"He has good experience, with more than 150 senior appearances already but, at 25, he is still a young player with his best years ahead of him.\n\n\"Ryan has good character, is hungry to succeed, and has shown me that he has great desire to be a West Ham United player. I look forward to working with him.\"\n\nMarco Silva Assigned as Everton Manager.\n\nEverton have appointed former Watford boss Marco Silva as their new manager.\n\nThe Toffees have been without a manager since parting ways with Sam Allardyce, who was sacked by the club earlier this month after less than six months in charge at Goodison Park.\n\nI'm really proud to be the new Everton manager,\" said Silva, who will hold his first press conference on Monday. \"I'm excited and I'm really happy to take this big challenge for us as a club and for me as a manager.\n\n\"I want to express my thanks to Farhad [Moshiri], to the Chairman, to the Board of Directors and to Marcel [Brands] as well for the confidence in my work.\n\n\"I know the huge history of Everton as a club and what the fans expect. I'm sure with everybody working together I will be ready for this challenge.\"\n\nSilva was originally a candidate for the Everton job after Ronald Koeman was sacked in October. However the club were forced to back off after Watford accused them of tapping up their manager.\n\nfollowing spells at Hull City and Watford\n\nThe Hornets have since made an official complaint to the Premier League over the approach and a mediation meeting held between the two clubs in April failed to resolve the issue.\n\nThe Premier League may be forced to convene a commission to find a suitable conclusion to the row, which could end with Everton paying a suitable compensation figure to Watford.\n\nSilva becomes the second high-profile arrival at Goodison Park this month, following the recent appointment of new director of football Marcel Brands.\n\n\"Marco is a young coach but also an experienced coach and he's worked already at the top, while also gaining experience of the Premier League which is also an important factor,\" Brands added.\n\n\"One of the most important things is that he's a guy who wants to play attractive, attacking football and also wants to work in the structure we have at Everton.\n\n\"He's a guy who has proved already that he wants to work with young players, make them better and he has performed very well with the teams he's worked with. He will be a very good manager for Everton.\"\n\nEverton chairman Bill Kenwright believes Silva, Brands and Moshiri can collectively guide the club to silverware.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to welcome Marco Silva as our new manager,\" said Kenwright. \"As the posters outside Goodison have proclaimed for many years, DNA is important to Everton and Evertonians.\n\n\"It's what they instinctively search out. In Marco and Marcel we welcome a pair of sportsmen whose statements of intent have already shown that they embrace that special quality that Evertonians look for.\n\n\"And with Farhad's vigorous patronage we are looking forward to the three M's, Marco Marcel and Moshiri, help take the Blues back to their rightful position among football's elite.\"\n\nMessi :my only club is Barcelona in Europe\n\nLionel Messi says he is \"increasingly sure\" Barcelona will be the only club he ever represents in Europe.\n\nMessi is preparing for another World Cup bid with Argentina and says only a chance to play in his homeland for Newell's Old Boys really appeals to him when his club career begins to wind down.\n\nThe 30-year-old spent time with the Rosario-based club before moving to Barcelona as a teenager and coming through the club's 'C' and 'B' teams on his road to stardom.\n\nLionel Messi says he is \"increasingly sure\" Barcelona will be the only club he ever represents in Europe.\n\nMessi is preparing for another World Cup bid with Argentina and says only a chance to play in his homeland for Newell's Old Boys really appeals to him when his club career begins to wind down.\n\nThe 30-year-old spent time with the Rosario-based club before moving to Barcelona as a teenager and coming through the club's 'C' and 'B' teams on his road to stardom.\n\n\"I'm increasingly sure that in Europe, Barcelona will be my only club,\" Messi said in an interview with Argentine television station El Trece.\n\n\"I always said I wanted to play in Argentine football one day, I don't know if it will happen but I have it in my mind.\n\n\"It would be at Newell's, nowhere else. I would like to do that for at least six months, but you never know what will happen.\n\n\"My dream was to play for Newell's as a kid, going to the matches with my dad, my brothers, my friends... after that; circumstances in life took me elsewhere but I still have that in mind.\"\n\nMessi is also glad he decided to play for Argentina, rather than Spain, in his international career even though he would almost certainly be a World Cup and dual European Championship winner if he had chosen differently.\n\n\"The other day I was talking to a friend and he told me 'if you had chosen Spain, you'd be a World Cup winner already', but it wouldn't have been the same,\" he added.\n\n\"Obviously in no moment did I think about doing that. To win it with Argentina would be something unique.\n\n\"We have players to be able to dream. It's important to start off with a win to build confidence. We don't have an easy group.\"\n\nRichard Wood takes Rotterham to next level\n\nRichard Wood scored twice to steer Rotherham back into the Sky Bet Championship as they beat Shrewsbury 2-1 after extra-time at Wembley.\n\nThe Millers captain struck the winner in the 103rd minute to hand his side the victory in the League One play-off final, after his initial goal in the first half had been cancelled out by Alex Rodman.\n\nFor Rotherham, it's an immediate return to the second tier following their dismal relegation last season, while Shrewsbury have now lost all five of their games at Wembley, and also a second for Paul Hurst's side this season having been beaten by Lincoln in the Checkatrade Trophy final last month.\n\nRotherham had a glorious opportunity to take the lead from the penalty spot inside the opening 10 minutes when Omar Beckles hauled down Wood in the box following a corner. David Ball was the man who stepped up to take out, but his effort was beaten away by Manchester United loanee Dean Henderson.\n\nThe Millers found the opener after 33 minutes, however. Another corner was swung in from Joe Newell, and this time Wood got way from his marker Beckles to power a header past Henderson in the Shrewsbury goal\n\nShrewsbury improved dramatically after half-time and equalised after 58 minutes thanks to a fantastic free-kick routine right off the training ground. Shaun Whalley was stood over the ball on the edge of the area, but rather than shoot he played the ball into Mat Sadler, whose wonderful first-time flick found Rodman in the six-yard box to poke home, leaving Rotherham dumbstruck.\n\nRotherham continued to dominate a visibly tiring Shrews side and they had a glorious chance to steal the win with virtually the last kick of normal time. Ryan Williams, on as a substitute with his fresh legs, tricked down the right before unleashing a fierce drive that seemed destined for the top corner, but Henderson was there with another fine save to tip the ball wide.\n\nPlayer ratings\n\nRotherham: Rodak (7), Emmanuel (7), Ajayi (7), Wood (9), Mattock (7), Ball (5), Taylor (6), Vaulks (6), Newell (8), Towell (6), Smith (6)\n\nSubs: Forde (6), Williams (6), Lavery (5)\n\nShrewsbury: Henderson (9), Bolton (6), Nsiala (6), Sadler (6), Beckles (5), Whalley (6), B Morris (5), Godfrey (6), Rodman (7), Nolan (6), C Morris (6)\n\nSubs: Riley (6), John-Lewis (6), Payne (6)\n\nMan of the match: Richard Wood\n\nAnother set-piece did the damage again for Rotherham after 103 minutes as they restored their lead. Joe Newell's fine free-kick travelled all the way to Wood at the far post, who slid in to steer the ball off the post and in. It was a first-career double for him in 467 senior appearances.\n\nIt was a well-deserved win for Rotherham on the day, but Shrewsbury will be devastated having spent so much of the season in the race for automatic promotion. They've been without second-tier football since 1989 and that wait will go on for at least another year\n\nPost-match stats\n\nThis is the first time since 2006-07 that three relegated teams from one league have been promoted the next season in the Football League - Hartlepool, Swindon and Walsall were relegated from League One in 2005-06 and promoted from League Two in 2006-07.\n\nShrewsbury have played five matches at Wembley and lost all five (including the Football League Trophy final this season); the joint-most among teams to have lost 100% of their games there, along with Brentford (5/5).\n\nThis game was the first League One play-off final to go to extra-time since 2014, when today's winners Rotherham beat Leyton Orient 4-3 on penalties.\n\nThe Shrews won 87 points in the 2017-18 league campaign; the most by a third-tier side who failed to win promotion since Sheffield United in 2011/12 (90).\n\nRichard Wood's header was his seventh league goal of the season for Rotherham (inc. playoffs) - the only current Miller players to net more this term were Joe Newell and David Ball (eight each).\n\nMan of the match - Richard Wood\n\nPaul Warne: \"I'm blessed to work with my best friends. It's been a good day at the office, but I'll have more sleepless nights thinking about playing teams like Aston Villa and others like that.\n\n\"I thought the lads were excellent, fairly play to Hursty and Shrewsbury today, it was a right good game and we were toe-to-toe. I'm really proud of the lads and the backroom staff and everyone at the club. It was a horrendous 12 months last year for everyone so for all the fans that made the effort to come down today, it has been worth it.\"\n\nPaul Hurst: \"We had a good spell after we'd equalised but the game became a farce because of the heat and people were cramping for both teams. I'm not just saying it because we've lost, but you play 48 games and also cup games in a season. I know what the rules are but it wasn't a good ending to the game, you should get more subs.\n\n\"Maybe it adds to the drama for the neutral watching but you can't really play how'd you'd like. Congratulations to Warney, though, and everyone at Rotherham United for returning at the first attempt.\"\n\nMO Salah 'Confident 'to play world cup\n\nMohamed Salah says he is \"confident\" he will be fit for this summer’s World Cup with Egypt after suffering injury in Liverpool's Champions League final defeat\n\nThe 25-year-old was forced off with a suspected dislocated shoulder in the first half of Real Madrid's 3-1 victory in Kiev on Saturday night, with initial fears he may miss the tournament in Russia next month.\n\nSalah, who left the stadium with his arm in a sling, is now with the Egyptian national team and he appeared upbeat about his chances in a tweet less that 24 hours after the incident.\n\n\"It was a very tough night, but I'm a fighter,\" he said. \"Despite the odds, I'm confident that I'll be in Russia to make you all proud. Your love and support will give me the strength I need.\"\n\nSalah was in tears as he was forced off after half an hour, with the score at 0-0, following a challenge from Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp felt Salah's departure had an impact on the game, with a couple of crucial mistakes from Reds goalkeeper Loris Karius and a wonder goal from Real substitute Gareth Bale ensuring a 3-1 victory for the Spanish side.\n\nKlopp said: \"It's a really serious injury, which is even worse. And the shock of the boys was obvious,\" a beleaguered Klopp said at full-time.\n\n\"Of course it was a big moment in the game. I know if you say something like that after a game and you lost, it sounds like you are a bit of a bad loser.\n\n\"But, for me, it was a harsh challenge - the arm was there. It was like wrestling a bit. And then Mo was a little bit unlucky falling on his shoulder.\n\n\"I think he is in the hospital for an X-ray. It's either the collarbone or the shoulder itself. But it's really not good.\"\n\nNeymar not 100 percent fit\n\nNeymar admits he is \"not yet at 100 percent\" following surgery on his fractured right foot but has declared himself fit enough to play for Brazil at the World Cup.\n\nThe Brazil forward has not played since injuring himself playing for PSG in a league game against Marseille in February, but has been training for the past 10 days and took part in a national team preparation camp this week.\n\nNeymar said: \"I'm not yet at 100 per cent. That will come with time. I'm still a bit scared of going all out, but there are still several days before our start.\n\nIt's going to take a bit more time for this fear to go away, but I'm ready to play. Nothing can stop me from doing so\",\n\nSpeaking before boarding a flight to London, where the Brazil team will continue their World Cup preparations, he added:\n\n\"I feel good physically. My foot is fine. Of course I have to adjust to certain things. I'm feeling a bit of discomfort but it's not going to stop me from playing.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old also reflected on what was a frustrating 2014 World Cup experience on home soil, as a back injury ruled him out of Brazil's humiliating 7-1 loss to Germany in the semi-finals.\n\n\"It's a dream to play in another World Cup, a dream which I hope won't be interrupted again,\" he said.\n\nBrazil will play two warm-up matches before travelling to Russia, with a friendly against Croatia at Anfield on June 3 before a trip to Vienna to face Austria on June 10.\n\nThe five-time world champions play their opening World Cup match in Group E against Switzerland on June 17 in Rostov-on-Donand then face Costa Rica on June 22 in Saint Petersburg and Serbia in Moscow on June 27.\n\nEmery now Arsenal Head coach\n\nI'm very excited to be given the responsibility to start this important new chapter in Arsenal's history.\"\n\nThe 46-year-old Spaniard arrives at the club following a two-year spell at PSG. He led the club to a domestic treble this season, but his contract was not extended and was replaced by Thomas Tuchel.\n\nEmery told Arsenal's official website: \"I am thrilled to be joining one of the great clubs in the game.\n\nUnai Emery won 87 of his 113\n\nmatches in charge at PSG\n\n\"Arsenal is known and loved throughout the world for its style of play, its commitment to young players, the fantastic stadium, the way the club is run. I'm very excited to be given the responsibility to start this important new chapter in Arsenal's history.\n\n\"I have met Stan and Josh Kroenke and it's clear they have great ambitions for the club and are committed to bringing future success. I'm excited about what we can do together and I look forward to giving everyone who loves Arsenal some special moments and memories.\"\n\nFormer Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta was believed to be a front-runner for the job, but Sky Sports News understands he withdrew from the running due to concerns over the extent of the role he would have in the club's transfer policy.\n\nArsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis said the club conducted a \"rigorous\" recruitment process, with Emery emerging as the unanimous choice.\n\n\"Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career, has developed some of the best young talent in Europe and plays an exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly\", said Gazidis.\n\nEmery experienced considerable success in Europe during his time at Sevilla, winning three successive Europa Leagues between 2014 and 2016\n\n\"His hard-working and passionate approach and his sense of values on and off the pitch make him the ideal person to take us forward.\n\n\"We conducted a confidential, wide-ranging and rigorous search involving extensive background references, data and video analysis, and personal meetings with all the candidates we shortlisted.\n\n\"All were interested in the position and we were unanimous in our choice of Unai to drive the next chapter of our history.\n\nGazidis said every candidate they interviewed to replace Arsene Wenger was 'interested in the position'\n\nArsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke described Emery as a \"proven winner\", adding: \"Several things stood out during his interview and the entire process; his football knowledge, energy, determination and love of the game.\n\n\"His familiarity with our club and our players, the Premier League and the game in Europe were all very impressive.\n\n\"He shares our vision to move forward, to build on the platform created by Arsene Wenger and help this club enjoy greater success. He's a proven winner.\"\n\nEmery held talks with Arsenal executives in London on Monday, and his personal website appeared to confirm the news on Tuesday night when it posted a graphic with the caption: \"Proud to be part of the Arsenal family.\"\n\nArsene Wenger departed Arsenal at the end of this season following 22 years at the club.\n\nDespite his domestic success in France, Emery failed to progress beyond the last 16 in the Champions League with PSG, and oversaw their infamous second-round exit to Barcelona in the 2016/17 season.\n\nThey won the first leg 4-0 at home, but went on to lose the return leg 6-1 in the Nou Camp after conceding three late goals.\n\nHowever, Emery does have an outstanding record in the Europa League - a tournament Arsenal will be competing in next season. He won the competition three times in a row during his time at Sevilla.\n\nWorld Cup 2018:Kane says they can win in Russia\n\nNew England captain Harry Kane says the team can win the World Cup in Russia and \"anything else is not good enough\".\n\nStriker Kane, 24, was informed about being made skipper by manager Gareth Southgate a few weeks ago and it was officially confirmed on Tuesday.\n\nKane scored 41 goals in all competitions last season as Tottenham finished third in the Premier League.\n\n\"It's impossible not to dream about lifting the World Cup. It's the biggest competition in the world,\" said Kane.\n\n\"I believe we can win it - anyone can. I cannot sit here and say we are not going to win it because we could do.\n\n\"It is my mindset and I want to win at everything I do. The players in the team want to as well. It is worth fighting for. I am sure we have all had dreams of lifting it and it is an opportunity for us.\n\n\"We are not favourites but you look at this season, no-one would have thought Liverpool getting to the Champions League final. You look at Manchester United back in the Sir Alex Ferguson days, they had a young team and dominated the Premier League for years to come.\n\n\"Being young is not an excuse - it could be a good thing. I believe we can and that is what we want to try and do. Anything else is not good enough.\"\n\nEngland head to Russia on 12 June and face Tunisia in their opening game on 18 June, followed by matches against Panama and Belgium.\n\nKane first captained England in last summer's 2-2 World Cup qualifier in Scotland, where he scored a late equaliser, before going on to wear the armband on a further three occasions.\n\nSpurs team-mate Eric Dier and Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson have also skippered England recently.\n\nKane, who has scored 12 goals in 23 appearances for his country, was described as a \"meticulous professional\" by Southgate.\n\n\"It is a massive day and a very proud day,\" he said. \"It is a dream come true. I found out a few weeks ago when I met Gareth Southgate. We were talking for an hour and he said he wanted me to be the captain.\n\n\"I have had to keep it quiet for a while now but it is fantastic. I filled up with pride and went home and told my family.\n\n\"Not much changes, I am someone who wants to lead by example on and off the pitch. That is what I will try to do.\n\n\"There are some young players in the squad who look up to players like that. There are some older players who I can learn from too.\"\n\nSouthgate, who told the England squad during a meeting at St George's Park on Monday night, added:\n\n\"Harry has some outstanding personal qualities. One of the most important things for a captain is that they set the standard every day.\n\n\"He has belief and high standards and it is a great message for the team to have a captain who has shown that it is possible to be one of the best in the world over a consistent period of time and that has been his drive.\n\n\"My feeling is that over the last 18 months in the camps that he's been with us he has shown that he has got the desire to take that into a team environment and he recognises the importance of bringing others with him.\"\n\nEngland's key World Cup dates\n\n2 June v Nigeria (friendly at Wembley)\n\n7 June v Costa Rica (friendly at Elland Road)\n\n12 June Squad leaves for Russia\n\n18 June v Tunisia (opening group game)\n\n24 June v Panama (second group game)\n\n28 June v Belgium (final group"
