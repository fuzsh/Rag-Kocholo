        "text": "Brøndby v OB Odense, 2-0\n\n1-0 Josip Radosevic (Pen, 13' )\n\n2-0 Oscar Schwartau (32' )\n\nAttendance : 17,946\n\n2-0 to Brøndby at home vs. OB Odense, and 5 out of 6 stars for their performance to Cappis, who went all 90 minutes, newly signed Denmark International Daniel Wass and the only 16-yo striker Oscar Schwartau who scored the 2nd goal. OB Odense's Emmanuel Sabbi is still out with an injury, and has not been able to play so far this season.\n\nBrøndby 4-4-2\n\nThomas Mikkelsen 3\n\nDaniel Wass (out 70.) 5\n\nFrederik Alves (out 70.) 4\n\nSigurd Rosted 4\n\nChristian Cappis 5\n\nMathias Greve 4\n\nJosip Radosevic 4\n\nJoe Bell 3\n\nOscar Schwartau (out 89.) 5\n\nMathias Kvistgaarden (out 70.) 4\n\nMarko Divkovic (out 80.) 4\n\n---\n\nYousef Salech (in: 70.) 3\n\nSebastian Sebulonsen (in: 70.) 3\n\nKevin Tshiembe (in: 70.) 3\n\nAnis Ben Slimane (in: 80.) UB\n\nPeter Bjur (in: 89.) UB\n\nB.T.s dom: Alt gik galt for ham i Wass' comeback-kamp | BT Superligaen - www.bt.dk\n\nWell, the Croatian Radosevic is the team captain (in the absence of their long term injured CB Andreas Maxsø ) and has played 147 games (6 goals, 10 assists) as a defensive midfielder for Brøndby and has played in the past for Napoli, and in the Europa cups and Leagues of Croatia and Austria for Hajduk Split and Red Bull Salzburg, while Cappis is younger, obviously less experienced with 64 games (1 goal, 6 assists) for Brøndby and is considered to be a box-to-box and all-round player, even playing as a left back in this game vs. OB Odense where he did an excellent job, so Brøndby have been moving him around to play in different positions, either due to injuries and because of the lack depth and better options, which is also why he usually play all 90 minutes, no matter the position. So it has nothing to do with Brøndby thinking less of him, but actually believing in him being able to do a great job all over the pitch.\n\nWell, finally having team captain Maxsø back and playing from start in defense, apparently made their coach believe it would be a great idea to bench their vice- captain and replace him with an even more highly experienced Daniel Wass (who granted, has played 113 of his 225 Spanish league games in central midfield), but this has all seemed to backfire, at least at the start of the game, so perhaps this was one change too many, or just too soon.\n\nBrøndby lost to Midtjylland by 0-2, not surprisingly as such, because Midtjyllad have a vastly higher budget and a more experienced team. Brøndby have, for good reason, desperately been looking for a good striker in this transfer window, which is noticeable, but their main problem seem to me, that their coach have had a very hard time finding a real \"General\" in central midfield able to distribute the ball and lead the \"troops\" so to speak.\n\nOnly a few games ago he symptomatically had moved Cappis from CM to left back position, and in this game it was the experienced vice-captain Radosevic who was benched in favor of their vastly more highly experienced Denmark NT right back but newly signed Daniel Wass, hoping that he would show the needed leadership in midfield. Instead it was the very inexperienced New Zealand NT DM Joe Bell who for the most part was trying to distributing the ball, and not really doing a very good job of it, no doubt because it was not suppose to be his job in this match."
