        "text": "Ederson has confirmed he will stay at Manchester City for the upcoming season amid interest from Saudi Arabia, having held productive talks with boss Pep Guardiola.\n\nEderson has become a fan favourite at the Etihad Stadium since arriving from Benfica in 2017, winning six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, four EFL Cups and the Champions League.\n\nHowever, the Brazil shot-stopper has seen his future called into question throughout the off-season, with Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal both linked with a big-money move for him.\n\nEderson said last month he had yet to make a decision on his future, but that has changed after talks with Guardiola and others in the City hierarchy.\n\nThe 30-year-old has now committed his future to the club, telling ESPN Brazil after Saturday's Community Shield win over Manchester United: \"The decision has been made.\n\n\"I will stay at Manchester City this season. I spoke to Pep and it was crucial.\n\n\"I'm happy to stay, fully focused on winning more titles here. I also spoke to the board, the directors, my team-mates and I'm staying.\"\n\nEderson saved a spot-kick from Jadon Sancho as City beat United on penalties at Wembley on Saturday, with Jonny Evans sending his kick over the bar before Manuel Akanji won it for City.\n\nHe also stepped up to convert City's fifth kick when a miss would have handed United victory, leading Guardiola to describe him as the club's joint-best penalty taker alongside Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nEderson has kept 112 clean sheets in 250 Premier League appearances for City, placing him joint-seventh in the competition's all-time charts for shutouts, alongside Peter Schmeichel.\n\nPetr Cech (162), David de Gea (147), David Seaman (137), Pepe Reina (134), Hugo Lloris (127) and Tim Howard (116) are the only goalkeepers with more.\n\nJadon Sancho retains the faith of Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag despite his penalty miss in Saturday's Community Shield defeat to Manchester City.\n\nUnited were on course to win their third piece of silverware under Ten Hag when Alejandro Garnacho gave them an 82nd-minute lead at Wembley Stadium.\n\nHowever, Bernardo Silva's 89th-minute header took the game to penalties, and both Sancho and Jonny Evans failed to convert from the spot as City triumphed 7-6.\n\nSancho spent the second half of last season on loan at former club Borussia Dortmund after a public falling out with Ten Hag, who accused the winger of being a poor trainer in the aftermath of a defeat to Arsenal last September.\n\nTen Hag said he had drawn a line under the incident after Sancho rejoined the United squad for pre-season training last month, and Saturday's penalty – which was pushed onto the post by Ederson – will not impact his thinking.\n\n\"I had no doubts about him,\" Ten Hag said of Sancho after Saturday's game.\n\n\"He's a very good penalty taker and today he missed, but that's part of the game. I am sure in the future he will take penalties.\"\n\nUnited have now been Community Shield runners-up on 10 occasions, more than any other club.\n\nThe Red Devils last won the trophy under Jose Mourinho in 2016, beating then-Premier League champions Leicester City 2-1 with goals from Jesse Lingard and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\n\nEmma Hayes thanked her late father for helping her achieve her \"dream\" after coaching the United States to Olympic gold at Paris 2024.\n\nUSA defeated Brazil 1-0 in Saturday's final at the Parc des Princes through Mallory Swanson's goal just before the hour mark.\n\nHayes only took over as USWNT head coach in May, after leaving her role at Chelsea, and tasted success in her first tournament in charge.\n\nSpeaking to Discovery+ at full-time as the celebrations started, Hayes said: \"I'm very emotional. It's been a dream of mine.\n\n\"I have to thank my dad - he's the one who pushed me to this position, to be able to come and coach an unbelievable group of players.\"\n\nHayes' father, who she has long described as a cornerstone in her football career, passed away last year.\n\n\"I've got my dad's necklace on,\" Hayes said post-match. \"It's got an American eagle, and he was with me today and that helped.\n\n\"The crowd were tremendous. Brazil were tremendous. I'm just speechless. I'm in shock.\"\n\nThe United States have now won five Olympic golds in the women's final - four more than any other nation - with this their first since 2012.\n\nSwanson calmly converted to give USA the victory in the French capital on her landmark 100th senior appearance for her national side.\n\nThis latest triumph comes 10 games into Hayes' tenure and puts the poor showings at the 2020 Games and 2023 World Cup in the past.\n\n\"They have received me so well and taken on board everything I've asked,\" Hayes added. \"They're tremendous people, players and role models and I love them.\"\n\nBrazil have still yet to win an Olympic gold in the tournament, with this their third runners-up finish after also falling just short in 2004 and 2008."
