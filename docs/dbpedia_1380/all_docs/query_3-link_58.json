        "text": "Valencia CF welcomed near-neighbours Elche CF on Saturday the 30th of January at Mestalla at 6:30 pm kick-off time (CET) on matchday 21 of LaLiga Santander. A minute’s silence was held in memory of Alberto Arnal and Adrián Campos ahead of kick-off in a rainy and blustery evening at Mestalla.\n\nValencia were off to a positive start in the early goings of the match knocking the ball around and trying to play though the opposition in possession and pressing high up the pitch off it to win it back.\n\nThe first Valencia CF chance fell to Daniel Wass who came mighty close to opening the scoring after latching onto a Badía let-off at the back. Alas, the Dane had his effort blocked away by Diego González on the stretch as the goal was gaping.\n\nDaniel Wass made amends with a downward header which bounced in front of Edgar Badía and into the back of the net following an Inch-perfect Gonçalo Guedes cross after turning Josan to find Daniel Wass who headed Valencia CF in front halfway through the first half.\n\nTwo minutes later, Hugo Guillamón tried his luck on the acrobatic but his effort went wide of the target.\n\nFormer Valencia CF man, Antonio Barragan, brought down Manu Vallejo in the box and the referee pointed to the spot. Carlos Soler stepped up but had his spot-kick saved by Edgar Badía on 34 minutes.\n\nTwo minutes on, Jaume Doménech pulled off a magnificent save to a dangerous dipping Mojica volley to keep the scoreline at 1-0. Valencia CF, However, were the better side and tried to double their lead ahead of the break but the first half finished 1-0 for Valencia CF.\n\nValencia CF came out in the second half looking to double their advantage and Carlos Soler came mighty close following a mazy run into the box as he waltzed past players but his effort fizzed wide of the post.\n\nThe game opened up going into the hour mark in an end-to-end passage of play with both sides breaking into either box with ease. Carlos Soler could not quite capitalise on an Elche CF let-off at the back from point-blank range. The ball went agonisingly wide after a series of pinball scrambles.\n\nValencia CF were made to defend by the opposition who were enjoying much of the ball and brining menace with Valencia CF able to clear away the danger resolutely as they looked to play their way into the box.\n\nJavi Gracia withdrew Manu Vallejo for Kang In with little over 15 minutes left to go and two minutes later, Gonçalo Guedes got his shot away with a first-time effort which blazed over the crossbar.\n\nYunus Musah replaced Gonçalo Guedes as Kang In got his curling shot away but the effort spun well wide.\n\nValencia CF managed to hold out to take all three points in a morale-boosting yet hard-fought win against near-neighbours Elche CF.\n\nValencia CF will head up north visit Athletic Club on Saturday the 7th of February at 4:15 pm kick-off time at the Nuevo San Mamés in the Basque Country on Matchday 22 of LaLiga Santander."
