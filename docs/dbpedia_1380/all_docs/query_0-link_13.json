        "text": "Round 2, Leg 2 Results\n\n14 October 2015\n\nEthiopia vs Indonesia - at Addis Ababa Stadium, Addis Ababa\n\nIndonesia had lost 3-1 in the first leg, and Ethiopia could've made their 'mission improbable' even less likely in the second minute. Shimelis Bekele's long ball sent Fikru-Teferra Lemessa clean through on goal, but Lemessa could only knock the ball into Indonesian goalkeeper Kurnia Meiga's hands. Meiga would continue to thwart the Ethiopians' attacks as best he could. At the other end, the Garuda had just a single shot on target... and Stefano Lilipaly couldn't find a way past Ethiopia goalkeeper Deyas Adugna in the 69th minute. The Walias were strolling towards victory, which they secured with three minutes to go. Mario Bilate's through-ball was smartly drilled in by Adame Girma, who extinguished Indonesia's dreams for good.\n\nEthiopia - 1 (Adane Girma 87)\n\nIndonesia - 0\n\n[Ethiopia win 4-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Amin Askar (Ethiopia, M/AM R - Sanliurfaspor)\n\nMalawi vs Guadeloupe - at Kamuzu Stadium, Blantyre\n\nHaving won their last five games, Guadeloupe could be excused for feeling confident about their chances of making Round 3. They almost increased their 3-1 aggregate lead after 18 minutes, but Brice Jovial pulled his shot just wide after a promising one-two with Ludovic Sylvestre. Gr√©gory Gendrey was unlucky not to score in the 23rd minute, when his shot hit the post before being picked up by Malawi keeper Richard Chipuwa. More misses chipped away at Les Gwada Boys' confidence, and by the 55th minute, Chipuwa and his Malawian team-mates were feeling rather chipper. Roger Ng'ambi's corner was drilled in by Luka Milanzi, and the Flames just needed to score once more to take the lead on away goals. Ng'ambi duly delivered that goal three minutes later from another set-piece - a stunning direct free-kick that rocketed past Guadeloupe keeper Franck Grandel. Malawi then battled hard to retain their lead, with Chipuwa making late saves from the likes of Elliot Grandin and Gendrey. Guadeloupe had burnt themselves out after an excellent run to Round 2, and it was the Flames who burned on.\n\nMalawi - 2 (Luka Milanzi 55, Robert Ng'ambi 58)\n\nGuadeloupe - 0\n\n[3-3 on aggregate, Malawi win on away goals]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Robert Ng'ambi (Malawi, M/AM/DM C - Platinum Stars)\n\nSyria vs Burundi - at Abbassyeen Stadium, Damascus\n\nBuoyed by an impressive comeback in the first leg, Syria started the second match with real vigour. Sanharib Malki's strike in the seventh minute gave the Qasioun Eagles clear daylight for the first time. Though Mutaz Kailouni missed a chance to put Syria even further ahead on 16 minutes, it was clear that the hosts had confidence and Burundi didn't. Burundi keeper Janvier Ndikumana and his defenders were on constant alert in the first half. When play resumed after the interval, the Swallows flew towards the Syrian goal with renewed purpose. Alas, the likes of Saidi Ntibazonkiza and Selemani Ndikumana would be left disappointed in their attempts to save Burundi from elimination. When Omar Al-Soma struck for Syria in the 79th minute, it marked the end of the road for the men from east Africa.\n\nSyria - 2 (Sanharib Malki 7, Omar Al-Soma 79)\n\nBurundi - 0\n\n[syria win 5-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Rawez Lawan (Syria, AM RL/ST C - Dalkurd)\n\nBahrain vs Barbados - at Bahrain National Stadium, Riffa\n\nBarbados began this second leg a goal down, and Nick Blackman blazed over a shot that could've got them level in the fifth minute. On 24 minutes, a solid catch from Barbadian keeper Keasel Broome prevented Abdulla Omar from giving Bahrain an even bigger lead. Broome had earlier brushed away shots from the likes of Ringo and Jaycee John. The Bahraini 'Beatles' would soon get back in the penalty area and send the Bajan Tridents on the long and winding road to elimination. Ringo starred on 65 minutes with an excellent strike from a difficult angle. After Ringo's goal came one from John, as Jaycee John finished Abdulrahman Mubarak's cross in the final minute. If Bahrain had had Paul and George in their team, a hard day's night for Barbados might've got a whole lot tougher. As it was, a 2-0 win on the night - and a 4-1 victory on aggregate - was more than enough to keep Al-Ahmar on the magical mystery tour.\n\nBahrain - 2 (Ringo 65, Jaycee John 90)\n\nBarbados - 0\n\n[bahrain win 4-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Abdulla Omar (Bahrain, D/WB/M R - Al-Ettifaq)\n\nBotswana vs Tanzania - at National Stadium, Gaborone\n\nIf you wanted excitement, Gaborone was just the place to see it. There were 46 shots at goal in this all-African match - 25 were on target, and seven ended up in the back of the net. Thomas Ulimwengu opened the floodgates with a header for Tanzania on 24 minutes. He then volleyed in another goal two minutes later to halve the four-goal deficit that the Taifa Stars had carried over from the first leg. Botswana retaliated on 37 minutes, when Galabgwe Moyana's corner was headed home by Mogakolodi Ngele. Another brilliant header saw the scoring continue after 66 minutes, as Mbwana Samatta made it 3-1 Tanzania on the night. The next man on the scoresheet was Botswana winger Kekaetswe Moloi in the 78th minute. Both teams then shared the final two goals, with John Bocco's strike for the visitors quickly cancelled out by Ngele's second for the Zebras. Tanzania may have won this fierce battle 4-3, but thanks to an emphatic victory four days earlier, it was Botswana who won the war.\n\nBotswana - 3 (Mogakolodi Ngele 37,89, Kekaetswe Moloi 78)\n\nTanzania - 4 (Thomas Ulimwengu 24,26, Mbwana Samatta 66, John Bocco 88)\n\n[botswana win 7-4 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Jo√´l Mogorosi (Botswana, AM/M R - unattached)\n\nSt Lucia vs Thailand - at Mindoo Philip Park, Castries\n\nThailand took less than two minutes to unravel St Lucia's gameplan. Teerasil Dangda got behind the home defence to drive Titipan Puangchan's cross into the net and double the War Elephants' aggregate lead. Puangchan then had a number of pops at goal himself, but it was Dangda who scored Thailand's second goal on 40 minutes. The experienced striker finished Anthony Ampaipitakwong's free-kick, and it was all going wrong for the St Lucians. Teeratep Winothai made it 3-0 very early in the second half, with his goal virtually sealing the Caribbean side's fate. Thailand completed a first-class performance with a fourth goal - Dangda's third - on 76 minutes. Goalkeeper Iran Cassius and his St Lucia colleagues were out for the count.\n\nSt Lucia - 0\n\nThailand - 4 (Teerasil Dangda 2,40,76, Teeratep Winothai 46)\n\n[Thailand win 5-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Teerasil Dangda (Thailand, ST/AM C - Muangthong United)\n\nDominican Republic vs Myanmar - at Estadio Ol√≠mpico F√©lix S√°nchez, Santo Domingo\n\nMyanmar must've thought they were seeing double in the sixth minute, when Dominican Republic right-back Carlos Mart√≠nez's corner was headed inches over by Hansley Martinez. By the 23rd minute, the Dominicans had doubled their overall lead. Mart√≠nez (that's Carlos, not Hansley) crossed to Jonathan Fa√±a, who flicked in an impressive header. Myanmar wasted a fair few opportunities to get back in the game afterwards, and they would eventually rue those misses. With eight minutes left to play, the White Angels turned into fallen angels. Mariano's right-wing cross for the Dominican Republic was turned in by visiting defender Zaw Min Tun before it could reach Fana, and Los Quisqueyanos were through without breaking much sweat.\n\nDominican Republic - 2 (Jonathan Fa√±a 23, Zaw Min Tun og82)\n\nMyanmar - 0\n\n[Dominican Republic win 3-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mariano (Dominican Republic, ST C - Real Madrid)\n\nKuwait vs Guyana - at Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium, Ardhiyah\n\nThis was Guyana striker Cameron Jerome's 29th birthday, so what better way to mark it than with two goals in the first half-hour? After looping a header over Kuwaiti goalkeeper Nawaf Al-Khalidi in the 13th minute, Jerome pounced on a defensive mistake from Ghazy Al-Qhedy to score again in the 30th. Mashaal Mlabesh had struck for Kuwait in between those two Jerome goals, but as half-time neared, Al-Azraq found themselves trailing 4-3 on aggregate. Bader Al-Motawa did restore parity just before the break... and he would score an even more significant goal in the 61st minute. A sloppy back-pass from Guyana captain Chris Nurse, and a sluggish reaction from his team-mate JP Rodrigues, allowed Al-Motawa to go one-on-one with Ronson Williams and hit the target again! The Golden Jaguars were unable to bounce back from that calamity. Jerome's birthday party was ruined, with Kuwait playing the role of gatecrashers.\n\nKuwait - 3 (Mashaal Mlabesh 22, Bader Al-Motawa 45,61)\n\nGuyana - 2 (Cameron Jerome 13,30)\n\n[Kuwait win 5-4 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mashaal Mlabesh (Kuwait, AM CRL - Al-Jahra)\n\nNiger vs Hong Kong - at Stade du G√©n√©ral Seyni Kountch√©, Niamey\n\nHong Kong goalkeeper Yapp Hung Fai made not one but two fantastic saves in the 13th minute, with Mohamed Souma√Øla and Issiakou Koudiz√© both unlucky not to score for Niger. Ten minutes later, however, the M√©nas had something to bleat about. Issoufou Boubacar's through-ball was tucked into the net by Maazou, and Niger's Gazelles were more like the predators than the prey for once. On 35 minutes, their captain Souleymane Sakou skimmed the bar with a shot that would surely have finished off Hong Kong once and for all. The visitors would prove to be the architects of their own downfall, as centre-half H√©lio knocked a Kader Amdou cross over his own goal line in the 55th minute. Aside from a late Alexander Akande header that clipped Niger's crossbar, Hong Kong went out of the World Championship without much of a fight.\n\nNiger - 2 (Maazou 23, H√©lio og55)\n\nHong Kong - 0\n\n[Niger win 4-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Kader Amadou (Niger, D R - AS SONIDEP)\n\nSt Kitts & Nevis vs Central African Republic - at Warner Park, Basseterre\n\nIf you want to avoid being on the wrong end of a cup upset, it helps if you don't concede 29 fouls and give the underdogs all the initiative. St Kitts & Nevis didn't heed that advice, as some shocking tackling allowed the Central African Republic to dictate terms and roll all over them. The visitors would open the scoring after 17 minutes, though not without some assistance from the Sugar Boyz. Kittian teenager Evansroy Barns' tackle on David Manga diverted the ball towards Hilaire Momi, who showed his gratitude by rifling in a half-volley. CAR's attacking threat was affected when Momi picked up a knock early in the second half, but with St Kitts out of control, a late turnaround never looked likely. The Wild Beasts would win this second leg by a single goal to nil and book a Round 3 date with Benin.\n\nSt Kitts & Nevis - 0\n\nCentral African Republic - 1 (Hilaire Momi 17)\n\n[Central African Republic win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Foxi (Central African Republic, AM LCR/ST C - Gaziantep Belediyespor)\n\nMacedonia vs Georgia - at Philip II Arena, Skopje\n\nWhen Macedonia frontman Goran Pandev got behind the defence to run onto a long ball from Vlatko Grozdanoski in the fourth minute, things looked ominous for Georgia. Nukri Revishvili got them out of that sticky mess with a fingertip save, but Georgia would remain under the cosh for much of this match. A head injury to midfielder Murtaz Daushvili, who collided with Grozdanoski in the 25th minute, didn't help matters as far as the Crusaders were concerned. Macedonia grew from strength to strength, and when Stevica Ristic broke free from the defence to place Mario Djurovski's pass into the net on 54 minutes, they were 2-0 up on aggregate. Only after that did Georgia really begin to attack. Akaki Gogia and Levan Mchedlidze each had shots saved by Red Lynxes captain Tome Pacovski in the 75th minute. Mchedlidze did beat Pacovski with a header ten minutes later, but the Crusaders ran out of time to score again, and Macedonia advanced by the skin of their teeth.\n\nMacedonia - 1 (Stevica Ristic 54)\n\nGeorgia - 1 (Levan Mchedlidze 85)\n\n[Macedonia win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Aleksandar Trajkovski (Macedonia, AM L/ST C - Palermo)\n\nOman vs Kazakhstan - at Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex, Muscat\n\nKazakhstan goalkeeper Stas Pokatilov blocked a number of early shots from Hussain Ali Al-Hadri to prevent Oman from taking an early lead. Home goalie Badar Juma, meanwhile, proved that he was a worthy deputy for the injured Ali Al-Habsi by tipping Kazakh captain Dmitrii Shonko's cross behind in the 25th minute. Thanks to both shotstoppers, the first half would remain goalless and the aggregate score stayed level at 1-1. One team would really kick on in the second half, though - and that team was Oman. On 71 minutes, a fantastic interception by right-back Mohamed Reza started a counter-attack that ended with Imad Al-Hoseni tucking away a massive goal. Kazakhstan's attempts to level and force a shoot-out ended without success, and their elimination would be confirmed on 84 minutes. Fouzi Bashir scored from the rebound after Pokatilov had parried an Ali Al-Jabri strike, and the men from Oman were through.\n\nOman - 2 (Imad Al-Hoseni 71, Fouzi Bashir 84)\n\nKazakhstan - 0\n\n[Oman win 3-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Fouzi Bashir (Oman, M/AM C - Dhofar)\n\nBelize vs Cura√ßao - at FFB Stadium, Belmop√°n\n\nBoth teams were busy on the attacking front in the first half, though neither of them were able to score. The best effort arguably came from Cura√ßao midfielder Roly Bonevacia, whose header went behind after clipping the crossbar in the 25th minute. Belize striker Harrison R√≥chez posed a danger at the other end, forcing visiting goalie Raymond Homoet into a number of saves. When the deadlock was broken after 73 minutes, though, it was by Cura√ßao. Romero Regales slid onto Gillian Justiana's left-wing delivery to divert the ball over the line and strike fear into the home fans. It was now 2-2 on aggregate, but Belize would still win on the away goals rule unless Cura√ßao could score for a second time. To the relief of Jaguars fans, Cura√ßao were unable to get near their goal again. Belize survived a home loss to book their spot in the next phase.\n\nBelize - 0\n\nCura√ßao - 1 (Romero Regales 73)\n\n[2-2 on aggregate, Belize win on away goals]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Gillian Justiana (Cura√ßao, D/WB/M L - Helmond Sport)\n\nBelarus vs Vietnam - at Borisov-Arena, Borisov\n\nThe first half was not an enjoyable one for Vietnam centre-back Sam Ngoc Duc. Firstly, in the seventh minute, he fired over a half-volley that could've drawn the Golden Stars level. Then, in the 26th minute, his failure to intercept a Nikolay Signevich cross ultimately saw Mikhail Sivakov fire Belarus into a 2-0 lead. Gonzalo could've rectified the situation for Vietnam in the 39th minute, but he headed Johnny Nguyen's cross against the post before Belarus goalkeeper Sergey Veremko secured the ball. All three of those first-half moments would prove key. The second period would pass by without too much drama, a few Veremko saves aside, and that was just how Belarus liked it. Another single-goal win saw them advance to Round 3.\n\nBelarus - 1 (Mikhail Sivakov 26)\n\nVietnam - 0\n\n[belarus win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mikhail Sivakov (Belarus, D/DM/M C - Zorya Lugansk)\n\nSierra Leone vs Cambodia - at National Stadium, Freetown\n\nSierra Leone midfielder Medo scored the 10th goal of a thrilling tie after six minutes to make it 7-3 overall to his team. Cambodia goalkeeper Simon Tracol then produced a number of impressive saves to try and keep the scoreline level. When Khim Borey scored at the other end after 26 minutes, a few Angkor Warriors fans began to wonder if an epic comeback was on. In truth, it was never very likely. Although Sierra Leone had to replace their goalkeeper Patrick Bantamoi at half-time due to a knock, his replacement Christian Caulker wouldn't be beaten even once, let alone four times. The Leone Stars rubber-stamped their place in Round 3 on 84 minutes, when they made it 8-4 on aggregate. Tracol struggled to push away a shot from Mustapha Dumbuya, and Aris Limassol forward Mohamed Mustafa Bangura (not to be confused with former Celtic striker Mohamed Bangura) applied the coup de grace.\n\nSierra Leone - 2 (Medo 6, Mohamed Mustafa Bangura 84)\n\nCambodia - 1 (Khim Borey 26)\n\n[sierra Leone win 8-4 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mustapha Dumbuya (Sierra Leone, D RL/WB R - Partick Thistle)\n\nLithuania vs Chad - at LFF Stadionas, Vilnius\n\nKarl Max got Chad off to a blistering start with a first-minute free-kick that Lithuania goalkeeper Zydrunas Karcemarskas could only help into his own net. Chadian fans believed that a second-leg turnaround was on the cards... and then defender Kevin Nicaise received a red card in the 19th minute. His professional foul on Lukas Spalvis left Les Sao having to defend against a strong Lithuanian team with just 10 men. Although they coped well at first, they cracked three minutes from half-time, when veteran right-back Marius Stankevicius' cross was headed in by Fedor Tchernykh. Right-winger Saulius Mikoliunas then recaptured his first-leg form in the second half. A fantastic delivery for Spalvis was tucked in by the 21-year-old Aalborg frontman, and Chad could kiss goodnight to their chances. Deivydas Matulevicius compounded their misery with two more Lithuania goals in the final 12 minutes, the second coming about after yet another sublime assist by Mikoliunas. China would have to be very wary of him in November.\n\nLithuania - 4 (Fedor Tchernykh 42, Lukas Spalvis 61, Deivydas Matulevicius 78,90)\n\nChad - 1 (Karl Max 1)\n\n[Lithuania win 7-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Deivydas Matulevicius (Lithuania, ST C - AFC Botosani)\n\nChoosing The Host\n\nIn the middle of October, following the conclusion of Round 2 of the World Championship, FIFA's Executive Committee - headed by President Gio Bambini - met to discuss where the competition as a whole would finish.\n\nWith nine months to go until the World Championship's big climax, FIFA had to decide as swiftly as possible the host venue for both Semi Finals and the Final.\n\nThere had been intense speculation over recent months about which venue would get the nod. Some of the venues that had been suggested were more serious contenders than others.\n\nThe largest football stadium in the world in terms of capacity was the May Day Stadium in Pyongyang, which could hold 150,000 spectators. Mind you, fact that it was in North Korea was a fairly significant drawback. A 'tongue-in-cheek' petition on Change.org urging FIFA to host the World Championship in Pyongyang attracted thousands of signatures, although that unsurprisingly didn't convince FIFA's executives.\n\nThat aside, the largest stadia which could realistically stage the World Championship finale were Barcelona's Nou Camp (capacity 99,354) and Mexico City's Estadio Azteca (capacity 95,500). However, neither Spain nor Mexico were interested in taking on hosting duties.\n\nEver the opportunist, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke offered up Wembley as a possible venue in a gushing speech that one critic said was \"designed to butter Bambini up\". Although Wembley's reputation as a leading football was not under question, the fact that it had recently hosted a couple of UEFA Champions League Finals (in 2011 and 2013) would surely count against it.\n\nThe Khalifa International Stadium in Doha was also suggested by the Qatari FA's President, Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed Al-Thani. Although the ground was undergoing renovation work that had originally been put in place for the 2022 World Cup, Al-Thani insisted that the ground was ready to host any major final. After all, Qatar had used it as the host venue for their recent victory over French Guiana.\n\nAbu Dhabi's Zayed Sports City Stadium also made a bid to host the final stages. Although that stadium only had a capacity of less than 45,000, the United Arab Emirates were hopeful that their financial muscle would win the day.\n\nThe United States Soccer Federation were rather quieter in their support for an American venue hosting the finals. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, and the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, were both mooted.\n\nThe bookmakers' favourite, though, was the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, which would've staged the 2016 UEFA European Championship climax. The French Football Federation (FFF) were understandably very disappointed about the cancellation of that tournament, and many onlookers thought that FIFA would offer them the inaugural World Championship as compensation.\n\nFor once, the bookies were proven to be correct. On 19 October 2015, Gio Bambini gleefully announced that an agreement had made between FIFA and the FFF for the Stade de France to stage the Semi Finals and Final of the 2016 World Championship.\n\n\"The announcement that the first FIFA World Championship will conclude in Paris will see FIFA go back to its roots,\" Bambini beamed. \"It was at Rue Saint Honor√© 229 in Paris that FIFA was founded on 21 May 1904. The organisation's first President - Robert Gu√©rin - was a Frenchman.\n\n\"It seems very appropriate, then, that this new era of international football will begin where it all began for FIFA 111 years ago - in the wonderful, incredible city of Paris.\"\n\nIn fact, Bambini hadn't only decided where the 2016 World Championship would finish. In a bid to appease other federations who had lost out financially after the cancellation of World Cups and continental championships that they would've hosted, he offered them the Finals of subsequent World Championships.\n\nThe United States - would-be hosts of the 2016 Copa Am√©rica - would stage the finals in 2017. It wasn't yet clear exactly which venue would get the honour of hosting, but that wouldn't need to be sorted out for a fair while yet.\n\nThe 2018 finals were offered, unsurprisingly, to Russia. The Russian government, still disgruntled over the 2018 World Cup that wouldn't be, originally turned down FIFA's approach, though it would later backtrack and agree to host. The reasons for their sudden change of heart would become clear later on.\n\nA lot of people were surprised to learn that Qatar would stage the 2019 World Championship Final. For one thing, it would take place three-and-a-half years before Qatar would've held the World Cup. For another, it would be played in the summer, not the winter.\n\nBambini had been very worried about the impact that staging a winter World Cup in 2022 would've had on the European domestic football calendar in the 2022/2023 season. Cynics suggested that that was a big motivation behind his decision to scrap the World Cup and replace it with his new annual World Championship.\n\nBambini didn't want such disruption to occur on his watch, so he offered Qatar the 2019 World Championship on the proviso that it would be staged in the summer, in a stadium with sufficient air-conditioning. The Qataris would take some persuading before agreeing to this compromise.\n\nThe 2020 World Championship Final was scheduled to be held in Cameroon, and the 2021 Final in the United Arab Emirates. Both nations would have staged continental championships in 2019 but for Bambini's election as FIFA President.\n\nOn the same day that it announced where the World Championship finals would take place, FIFA decided to bury some bad news with a rather more concerning announcement. J√©r√¥me Valcke, the organisation's General Secretary, had been suspended with immediate effect.\n\nValcke was released from his duties \"until further notice\" following allegations that he resold 2014 World Cup tickets for over four times their face value. Speaking through his legal team, the Frenchman categorically refuted the allegations.\n\nValcke had already been under investigation over his involvement in a $10million bribe that helped South Africa to secure the hosting rights for the 2010 World Cup. American prosecutors had said that South Africa's World Cup Organising Committee transferred the money to bank accounts run by Jack Warner, who was the President of CONCACAF and a FIFA Vice-President at the time.\n\nMarkus Kattner, a German-born business consultant who had been serving as FIFA's Director of Finance since 2003, was instated as acting General Secretary by Bambini while Valcke served his suspension.\n\nThese latest corruption allegations suggested that the FIFA corruption scandal was still a long way from coming to a head. Valcke's suspension, though, was a sign that Bambini was serious in his determination to reform world football's governing body.\n\nRound 3, Leg 1 Results\n\n13 November 2015\n\nOman vs Burkina Faso - at Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex, Muscat\n\nMidfielder and captain Charles Kabore was at the heart of Burkina Faso's early attacks. Kabore had the Stallions' first shot on target in the 20th minute, when his effort was caught by Oman goalkeeper Badar Juma. The likes of Bertrand Traor√© and Bryan Dabo also tried their luck before the former broke through on 42 minutes. Alain Traor√©'s corner was nodded on by Bakary Kon√© to Bertrand Traor√©, whose header provided what would be the only goal of this game. Oman were badly hampered by an injury to veteran midfielder Fouzi Bashir in the 51st minute, and their subsequent attacks were largely disappointing. They were unable to open up a Burkinab√© defence marshaled superby by Kon√©, and so it was advantage Stallions after the first leg.\n\nOman - 0\n\nBurkina Faso - 1 (Bertrand Traor√© 42)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Bakary Kon√© (Burkina Faso, D C - Lyon)\n\nEthiopia vs Montenegro - at Addis Ababa Stadium, Addis Ababa\n\nEthiopa's defence did a good job of keeping Montenegro captain Mirko Vucinic and his strike partner Stevan Jovetic quiet in the first half. Vucinic was caught offside on a couple of occasions, while Adane Mentesenot did a fine job at sweeper for Ethiopia. Mentesenot was subbed at half-time as the Walias switched to a more attacking approach, only to see it backfire. When space opened up for Vucinic in the 53rd minute, Zarko Tomasevic provided the 32-year-old with a cross that he could easily put away. In the 65th minute, Jovetic had two successive efforts kept out by the post and then Ethiopia keeper Deyas Adugna as he tried to extend the Brave Falcons' lead. Just moments later, though, Marko Vesovic crossed the ball back into the hosts' area for Vucinic to head in his second goal. The former Juventus and Roma frontman's return to form had seen Montenegro take a massive step towards Round 4.\n\nEthiopia - 0\n\nMontenegro - 2 (Mirko Vucinic 53,65)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mirko Vucinic (Montenegro, ST C/AM LC - Al-Jazira [uAE])\n\nZimbabwe vs Togo - at Rufaro Stadium, Harare\n\nTogo's 37-year-old goalkeeper Kossi Agassa required treatment on a knock in the very first minute. That didn't help the Sparrow Hawks' nerves, and Zimbabwe right-back Hardlife Zvirekwi was about to make life very hard for them. Zvirekwi struck the bar from just outside the penalty area after 21 minutes, and his colleague Nyasha Mushekwi buried the rebound to give Zimbabwe a 1-0 lead. Mushekwi would miss a couple of chances to extend that advantage before Agassa denied Knowledge Musona a goal on the stroke of half-time. Zimbabwe's Warriors would grow stronger in the second half, despite Emmanuel Adebayor and midfielder Sapol Mani's best attempts to get Togo back in the match. The Sparrow Hawks would have their wings clipped again in the 81st minute. Togo defender Assimiou Tour√© could only nod Costa Nhamoinesu's cross as far as Khama Billiat, whose first-time strike sent Zimbabwe into the second leg with a two-goal cushion.\n\nZimbabwe - 2 (Nyasha Mushekwi 21, Khama Billiat 81)\n\nTogo - 0\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Hardlife Zvirekwi (Zimbabwe, D R - CAPS United)\n\nKuwait vs Faroe Islands - at Jaber Al-Hamad International Stadium, Ardhiyah\n\nKuwait had a major scare in the 10th minute, when S√∏lvi Vatnhamar's long ball sent Gilli R√≥lantsson clean through for the Faroe Islands. However, R√≥lantsson got his first touch all wrong, allowing defender Fahad Humood to get back and sweep up the threat. Seven minutes later, though, R√≥lantsson would get his name on the scoresheet. Faroes left-winger Kaj Leo √ç Bartalsstovu skilfully jumped over a slide-tackle from Amer Matooq before providing R√≥lantsson with a cross that the Aalborg right-winger headed home. The Faroes' widemen would link up brilliantly again in the 56th minute. Bartalsstovu provided R√≥lantsson with another excellent cross, which his colleague powered into the net for 2-0. Kuwait were unfortunate not to get a goal back when Mashaal Mlabesh's header on 75 minutes hit the goal frame. Bader Al-Motawa did find the target for Kuwait four minutes later, but Al-Azraq still trailed after the first leg.\n\nKuwait - 1 (Bader Al-Motawa 79)\n\nFaroe Islands - 2 (Gilli R√≥lantsson 17,56)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Gilli R√≥lantsson (Faroe Islands, D/M R - Aalborg)\n\nThe Gambia vs Bolivia - at Stade Brikama, Banjul\n\nThe Gambia started brightly, with Tijan Jaiteh's shot in the sixth minute forcing Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra to concede a corner. That corner would lead to a goal from Bubacarr Sanneh, who header from Mustapha Jarju's delivery got the better of Viscarra. Bolivia responded with a 21st-minute equaliser from Juan Carlos Arce, who drove in an excellent floated ball from Jaime Arrascaita. The rest of the first half was a very close affair, and the second would follow a similar pattern. The Gambia again made the most of a set-piece to return to the ascendancy after 57 minutes. Captain Hamza Barry provided the delivery into the box, and Mustapha Carayol knocked the ball out right for Demba Savage to finish at the far post. La Verde had to attack again, and Rodrigo Vargas would surely have restored parity for them in the 69th minute but for a superb fingertip save from Alagie Nyabally. As it transpired, Vargas would get his equaliser in the 89th minute. Arrascaita's diving header from Rudy Cardozo's left-wing cross left Vargas with a simple finish that left the hosts stunned - and quite disappointed.\n\nThe Gambia - 2 (Bubacarr Sanneh 6, Demba Savage 57)\n\nBolivia - 2 (Juan Carlos Arce 21, Rodrigo Vargas 89)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mustapha Jarju (The Gambia, M/ST/AM C - KSK Hasselt)\n\nBahrain vs Jordan - at Bahrain National Stadium, Riffa\n\nThough Jordan had the first couple of shots at goal, their goalkeeper Ahmed Abdel-Sattar had to make the first save when he caught Ismail Abdul-Lateef's header in the 19th minute. Bahrain would gradually grow stronger as the first half wore on, and in the 35th minute, only the crossbar denied right-back Abu Bakr Adam a spectacular long-range goal. Jaycee John also had a stroke of awful luck for the hosts on 64 minutes, when his fierce close-range strike from Rashed Al-Hooti's corner struck the near post. Al-Hooti certainly didn't have anything to hoot about six minutes later. A missed interception from Bahrain captain Sayed Mohamed Adnan, and then a missed tackle from right-back Al-Hooti, saw Jordan left-back Mohammed Al-Dmeiri's cross find its way to Angelos Hanti. The Greek-born striker duly broke the deadlock for Jordan, and after some late saves from Abdel-Sattar, Al-NashƒÅmƒÅ emerged from the first leg as narrow winners.\n\nBahrain - 0\n\nJordan - 1 (Angelos Hanti 70)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Abu Bakr Adam (Bahrain, D RC - Al-Orobah)\n\nMacedonia vs Haiti - at Philip II Arena, Skopje\n\nHaiti goalkeeper Johny Placide made a trio of saves to stop Macedonia from taking the lead within the first 45 minutes. After a frustrating first period for the likes of Agim Ibraimi, the second half worked out slightly better for Macedonia. Five minutes into the period, Goran Popov knocked the ball down the line for Goran Pandev, whose left-wing cross was finished by Aleksandar Trajkovski. Haiti could've fallen apart right there, but Placide kept his head in Les Grenadiers' goal. He made two more saves in the 66th and 79th minutes from Pandev and Trajkovski respectively to keep Macedonia stuck on a single goal. Haiti, meanwhile, remained stuck on nil, as although playmaker Jeff Louis did create a lot of chances, his strikers - particularly Jean-Eudes Maurice - were very profligate with them.\n\nMacedonia - 1 (Aleksandar Trajkovski 50)\n\nHaiti - 0\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Jeff Louis (Haiti, AM C/M RC - Caen)\n\nMalawi vs Armenia - at Kamuzu Stadium, Blantyre\n\nArmenia's star man was Borussia Dortmund forward Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who posed a real danger to Malawi in the early stages. In the 32nd minute, though, a less-heralded Armenian started to take the limelight. Artur Edigarian received the ball from Aghwan Papikyan just outside the Malawi 'D', and then whacked it into the net from 25 yards out! Although he was primarily a ball-winning defensive midfielder based in South Korea's second division, Edigarian suddenly transformed into a goal machine! Barely a quarter of a minute into the second half, he ran onto a Yura Movsisyan through-ball and scored for the second time! Armenia would go on to dominate the game, despite losing winger Aras Ozbiliz to an ankle injury in the 57th minute. As Malawi's stress levels rose along with their foul count, Havakakan remained calm and secured a comfortable 3-0 win on 83 minutes. Unsurprisingly, it was Edigarian who had the final say, with his shot going in off the crossbar after a superb set-up by Karlen Mkrtchyan.\n\nMalawi - 0\n\nArmenia - 3 (Artur Edigarian 32,46,83)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Artur Edigarian (Armenia, DM/M C - Gangwon)\n\nLuxembourg vs Uzbekistan - at Stade Josy Barthel, Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg's defenders were at sixes and sevens as a clever attacking move saw Uzbekistan take the lead after 14 minutes. Aleksandr Geynrix got his head to Vitaly Denisov's cross from the left flank, and Luxembourg goalkeeper Jonathan Joubert was easily beaten. His Uzbek counterpart Akbar To'raev would also have to pick the ball out of the net two minutes later, after Christopher Martins Pereira levelled for the Red Lions. The White Wolves were soon on the prowl again, and Geynrix restored Uzbekistan's advantage from a 21st-minute counter-attack. Geynrix was now seeking a hat-trick, and although he hit the side netting in the 42nd minute, he did secure the match ball midway through the second period. A second assist from right-back Islom To'htaho'jaev resulted in Geynrix's third goal on 66 minutes. Very shortly after that, Uzbekistan wrapped up the win with their fourth strike. Farxod Tojiev selflessly squared the ball to fellow sub Salim Mustafoev, who left Luxembourg 4-1 down after their home leg.\n\nLuxembourg - 1 (Christopher Martins Pereira 16)\n\nUzbekistan - 4 (Aleksandr Geynrix 14,21,66, Salim Mustafoev 67)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Aleksandr Geynrix (Uzbekistan, ST/AM C - Ordabasy Shymkent)\n\nNamibia vs South Africa - at Sam Nujoma Stadium, Windhoek\n\nAlthough these two were very close together geographically, South Africa were expected to win easily... and so it proved. Namibia were having to defend in numbers from very early on as Bafana Bafana upped the ante. Oupa Manyisa wasted a real opening from Marc van Heerden's free-kick in the 30th minute, while Lehlohonolo Majoro was denied a breakaway goal in the 33rd by a fine save from Maximilian Mbaeva. South Africa did at last go ahead on 41 minutes, although not without a huge slice of fortune. Andile Jali flicked another van Heerden free-kick towards goal, and Namibia midfielder Wycliff Kambonde's attempted clearance rebounded off his team-mate Michael Pienaar before deflecting into the net. That seemed quite harsh on the Brave Warriors, who put up a brave resistance, even when Jabulani Shongwe hit their woodwork on 52 minutes. Namibia would hold out until the 72nd minute, when a mistake from defender Da Costa Angula left Bongani Ndulula free to score for South Africa. Bafana Bafana were two goals to the good as they headed back home for the return leg.\n\nNamibia - 0\n\nSouth Africa - 2 (Michael Pienaar og41, Bongani Ndulula 72)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Jabulani Shongwe (South Africa, M CR - Bidvest Wits)\n\nNiger vs Bulgaria - at Stade du G√©n√©ral Seyni Kountch√©, Niamey\n\nNiger goalkeeper Loss√©ni Doumbia would have a lot to do in the first 20 minutes. Early saves from the likes of Mihail Aleksandrov and Georgi Milanov kept Bulgaria off the scoresheet, though only temporarily. Some Brazilian magic helped Bulgaria to open the scoring after 35 minutes, as attacking midfielder Marcelinho whacked a superb shot into the top corner. Four minutes later, the Lions took down the Gazelles again. Marcelinho also played his part in Bulgaria's second goal, which Andrey Galabinov scored after a sublime cross from Stanislav Manolev. Right-back Manolev's game ended early in the second half after he twisted his ankle, but the rest of Bulgaria's defence would hold firm. Goalkeeper Bozhidar Mitrev held onto all of Niger's four shots on targets, two of which came from Maazou in the dying moments.\n\nNiger - 0\n\nBulgaria - 2 (Marcelinho 35, Andrey Galabinov 39)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Marcelinho (Bulgaria, M/AM C - Ludogorets Razgrad)\n\nS√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe vs Honduras - at Est√°dio 12 de Julho, S√£o Tom√©\n\nS√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe were always likely to be up against it when they played Honduras. Los Catrachos put them under strain right from the word go, and Jona got the first goal after a sublime assist from Anthony Lozano in the 17th minute. Honduras' subsequent shots then showed indications of complacency, although they refocused their efforts in the second half. When Aykemms tripped Jona in the S√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe area on 51 minutes, Oscar Boniek Garc√≠a stepped up to slot in the penalty that put Honduras 2-0 ahead. The visitors continued to hammer in shots from anywhere they could. Winger Andy Najar having no fewer than 13 (THIRTEEN) attempts before he finally scored with his 14th effort on 78 minutes. S√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe were then shown a bit more mercy, although the West Africans would surely have to produce an incredible comeback if they were to go through to Round 4.\n\nS√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe - 0\n\nHonduras - 3 (Jona 17, Oscar Boniek Garc√≠a pen51, Andy Najar 78)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Jona (Honduras, ST C - Albacete)\n\nSierra Leone vs Jamaica - at National Stadium, Freetown\n\nBoth teams had reason to be concerned in the 8th minute, when Jamaica's Deshorn Brown and Sierra Leone's Michael Lahoud collided with each other in the host's penalty area. Both players suffered nasty gashes as a result, although they were able to play on. Indeed, Brown could've put Jamaica ahead in the 32nd minute with a shot that was well saved by Patrick Bantamoi. That was one of 12 saves Bantamoi would have to make in a match that the Reggae Boyz would dominate. Captain Wes Morgan and winger Jason Puncheon were each denied on multiple occasions, but not substitute Navion Boyd, who drove in what proved to be the only goal after 67 minutes. Although they hadn't won by quite as big a scoreline as some had predicted, Jamaica were still on course to reach the next round.\n\nSierra Leone - 0\n\nJamaica - 1 (Navion Boyd 67)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Michail Antonio (Jamaica, M/AM RL - West Ham United)\n\nDominican Republic vs Latvia - at Estadio Ol√≠mpico F√©lix S√°nchez, Santo Domingo\n\nIn the 19th minute, Latvia's defenders blocked a couple of quickfire shots from Dominican Republic duo Mariano and Carlos Mart√≠nez. Latvia then launched an incisive counter-attack, with Olegs Laizans sending them 1-0 up so soon after they almost went 1-0 down! A 26th-minute save from Andris Vanins stopped Mart√≠nez from getting a swift leveller for Los Quisqueyanos. Both sides then missed a good number of chances before Latvia took one of theirs in the 54th minute. It was not a great moment for Dominican Republic goalkeeper Rafael Diaz, who could only palm a tame effort from Aleksandrs Fertovs into the net. Latvia were now cruising to victory in a match that had otherwise been very, very close. A third Latvian goal in the 79th minute would've been really cruel on the hosts, but Diaz somehow managed to push Artjoms Rudnevs' volley against his bar and keep the Dominicans just about in the running.\n\nDominican Republic - 0\n\nLatvia - 2 (Olegs Laizans 19, Aleksandrs Fertovs 54)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Antons Kurakins (Latvia, D/WB L - Hamilton Academical)\n\nSt Vincent & The Grenadines vs United Arab Emirates - at Arnos Vale Ground, Arnos Vale\n\nAn end-to-end first half was typified by two great scoring chances in the sixth minute. Firstly, Ismael Salem Al-Hammadi's header for the UAE was impressively tipped behind by Dwayne Sandy. St Vincent & The Grenadines then cleared the resulting Omar Abdulrahman before launching a counter-attack. Kieran Agard looked almost certain to score when he latched onto Glenford Ashton's cross into the UAE box... but he somehow fired it wide! The first half would remain goalless, and Agard's miss would carry even greater significance in the second. Although Ali Mabkhout hit the post in the 62nd minute, he set up an easy finish for Abdulrahman moments later to give the Whites a narrow lead. After a few more late misses from Agard, the Vincentians' home leg ended in disappointment.\n\nSt Vincent & The Grenadines - 0\n\nUnited Arab Emirates - 1 (Omar Abdulrahman 62)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Ali Mabkhout (United Arab Emirates, ST/AM C - Al-Jazira [uAE])\n\nBelarus vs Angola - at Borisov-Arena, Borisov\n\nBelarus dealt the first blow in a fierce contest after 14 minutes. Mikhail Sivakov's long-distance strike was parried by Angola goalkeeper Nuno, and Anton Putilo pounced on the rebound. The host's joy would be cut short in the 27th minute. Centre-back Egor Filipenko's unconvincing interception from R√∫ben Gouveia's free-kick saw the ball drift towards Bruno Gaspar, who finished at the back post. The turnaround continued in the 36th minute, with Angola winger Geraldo dribbling past Belarus left-back Maxim Bordachev as he cut inside and made it 2-1 to the Sable Antelopes. Bordachev's evening went from bad to worse when he conceded the free-kick that led to Angola's third goal on 66 minutes. Djalma's delivery into the box was half-volleyed in by Mateus Galiano, and the first leg was surely done and dusted. That wasn't quite the case, as Sergey Kornilenko did drive in Belarus' second goal from a difficult angle with four minutes remaining. However, the substitute's strike would only serve as a consolation for the men in red, who would need a big win away from home to stay in the tournament.\n\nBelarus - 2 (Anton Putilo 14, Sergey Kornilenko 86)\n\nAngola - 3 (Bruno Gaspar 27, Geraldo 36, Mateus Galiano 66)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Geraldo (Angola, M RL/AM RLC - Primeiro de Agosto)\n\nRound 3, Leg 1 Results\n\n14 November 2015\n\nPalestine vs Cyprus - at Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium, Al-Ramm\n\nCyprus began their tournament with a bang, scoring after just seven minutes. Midfielder Vincent Laban searched out Andreas Makris on the left wing, and Makris cut inside before firing home. Two minutes later, Cypriot goalkeeper Antonis Giorgallidis made a superb fingertip save to keep out a fierce first-time drive from Hilal Musa. The Fedayeen had a few more opportunities to level before falling further behind in the 37th minute. Palestinian defender Javier Cohene did well to block Andreas Avraam's initial shot from out wide, but Avraam fired in the follow-up to put Cyprus 2-0 up. The Cypriots then withstood a few more Palestinian attempts in the second half before returning home with a clear advantage.\n\nPalestine - 0\n\nCyprus - 2 (Andreas Makris 7, Andreas Avraam 37)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Vincent Laban (Cyprus, M C - AEK Larnakas)\n\nKyrgyzstan vs Gabon - at Stadion im Dolena Omurzakova, Bishkek\n\nGabon's star player Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang first threatened Kyrgyzstan goalkeeper Kirill Priadkin with a promising attempt at goal in the eighth minute. Four minutes later, Kyrgyzstan's left-winger Edgar Bernhardt pulled up with a serious knee injury that ended his game. That could have seriously hampered the White Falcons, but the hosts recovered and eventually took the lead after 40 minutes. Right-winger Viktor Maier unlocked the Gabon defence with a superb cross that Ahletdin Israilov headed majestically into the net. That was only a temporary setback for Les Panth√®res, who roared back to life six minutes into the second half. Shortly after having a shot pushed behind by Priadkin, Aubameyang headed in the resultant L√©vy Madinda corner to level the scores. The Borussia Dortmund hotshot's leveller gave his team-mates a spring in their step, and by the 76th minute, it was Gabon who had the advantage. Kevin Mayi had a shot blocked by Priadkin, but Fr√©d√©ric Bulot got to the rebound and ensured that the African side would go into the second leg 2-1 up.\n\nKyrgyzstan - 1 (Ahletdin Israilov 40)\n\nGabon - 2 (Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 51, Fr√©d√©ric Bulot 76)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: L√©vy Madinda (Gabon, M/AM C - Gimnastic Tarragona)\n\nThailand vs Libya - at Rajamangala National Stadium, Bangkok\n\nTeerasil Dangda had a couple of early openings for Thailand, but it was Libya who made the first breakthrough after 10 minutes. A poor clearance by Thai defender Suttinum Phukhom saw Almoatasembellah Mohamed take the loose ball and square it to his Libyan colleague Ibrahim Al-Haasy, who drilled in the opener. The Mediterranean Knights' crusade continued with a second goal on 25 minutes. Wing-back Abdulaziz Belraysh cleared the defence to find Mohammad Zubya, who blasted the ball home. Impressively, Libya would score with their only two shots on target in the whole game. Thailand also had a couple of shots on target either side of that Zubya goal, but Dangda couldn't beat goalkeeper Muhammad Nashnoush with either of them. The second half was goalless and rather low-key, and so the War Elephants found themselves on the endangered species list, having lost 2-0 at home.\n\nThailand - 0\n\nLibya - 2 (Ibrahim Al-Haasy 10, Mohammad Zubya 25)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Abdulaziz Belraysh (Libya, D RC/WB R - Al-Ittihad [Libya])\n\nMalta vs Morocco - at Ta' Qali, Mdina\n\nMalta had to batten down the hatches in the first half as Morocco looked to gain the initiative early on. Morocco had a number of shots blocked, while a great chance from forward Abderrazak Hamedallah was saved by Falcons keeper Andrew Hogg in the 34th minute. Malta's defenders put their bodies on the line - figuratively and, in Steve Borg's case, literally. Centre-back Borg collided with Youssef El Arabi just before half-time and ended up breaking his arm. His injury elongated a one-sided first half by six minutes, and Morocco would go on to dominate the second period as well. Hogg made a number of brilliant saves to stave off the Atlas Lions, but his goal would finally be breached in the 76th minute. Hamedallah finished Achraf Lazaar's left-wing centre at the far post to give his team the advantage going into the second leg. However, Hamedallah would be forced to sit out the rematch, having sustaining a dead leg two minutes after scoring his winner.\n\nMalta - 0\n\nMorocco - 1 (Aberrazak Hamedallah 76)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Achraf Lazaar (Morocco, D/WB/M L - Palermo)\n\nLebanon vs Estonia - at Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Beirut\n\nWhen an Estonian counter-attack led to Sergei Zenjov being sent through on goal in the second minutes, Lebanon fans must've been fearing the worst. Much to their relief, though, Zenjov pulled the ball wide when he just had goalkeeper Daniel Zeaiter to beat. Lebanon also missed a trick in the 14th minute, when Abbas Atwi fired the ball straight into Blueshirts goalie Marko Meerits' hands. This would be a match full of missed opportunies, mostly at the Lebanese end. Estonia had 20 shots at goal in total, but a lack of accuracy from the likes of Zenjov and his strike partner Konstantin Vassiljev would prove very costly. The visitors' nadir came when a weak clearance from Lebanese defender Abdullah Taleb sent Joonas Tamm one-on-one with Zeaiter. Tamm's first chance was parried by the keeper, and the second drifted inches wide. Two minutes later, Hassan Maatouk showed the Blueshirts just how it was done with an impressive strike that earned Lebanon a surprise victory against the run of play!\n\nLebanon - 1 (Hassan Maatouk 77)\n\nEstonia - 0\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Hassan Maatouk (Lebanon, ST C - Al-Fujairah)\n\nKenya vs Uganda - at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani\n\nKenya were on top in the opening stages of this derby match, and it was not surprising to see Dennis Oliech give them the lead after 14 minutes. It did come as a surprise, though, that Uganda midfielder Isaka Cernak almost levelled in the 29th minute with a blistering 25-yarder shot that bounced just over off the crossbar. Victor Wanyama attempted a long-ranger of his own for Kenya in the 36th minute... and he succeeded in giving the Harambee Stars a 2-0 lead. Uganda striker Geofrey Massa halved that advantage with a half-volley just before half-time, but the Cranes would soon be put back in their place. Visiting goalie Denis Onyango's save from Wanyama in the 47th minute only led to an excellent rebound strike by Ayub Masika, and Kenya were firmly in the ascendancy from then on. Although Wanyama was denied his second and Kenya's fourth goal by the crossbar in the 62nd minute, it was hard to bet against the Harambee Stars making it through to Round 4.\n\nKenya - 3 (Dennis Oliech 14, Victor Wanyama 36, Ayub Masika 47)\n\nUganda - 1 (Geofrey Massa 44)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Ayub Masika (Kenya, AM/D/WB R - Lierse)\n\nLithuania vs China - at LFF Stadionas, Vilnius\n\nHaving breezed past Chad in the previous round, Lithuania showed after six minutes that they fancied themselves to conquer another opponent. Arvydas Novikovas gave them a very early lead after a curler from his compatriot Saulius Mikoliunas was tipped away by China goalkeeper Zeng Cheng. Mikoliunas later missed a number of chances to give Lithuania daylight, and he would regret those misses. On 26 minutes, China midfielder Huang Bowen's free-kick was flicked on by Cai Huikang, and Yang Shanping volleyed in the equaliser. The turnaround was completed in the 44th minute. Zhang Xizhe's half-volley from Yu Dabao's delivery was spilled by Lithuania goalie Zydrunas Karcemarskas, and Zhang then struck at the second time of asking. Both teams continued to attack in the second half, though the scores remained unchanged, meaning that the Dragons were 2-1 up before their home leg.\n\nLithuania - 1 (Arvydas Novikovas 6)\n\nChina - 2 (Yang Shanping 26, Zhang Xizhe 44)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Zhang Xizhe (China, AM C/M RLC - Beijing Guo'an)\n\nSyria vs Rwanda - at Abbassyeen Stadium, Damascus\n\nRwanda goalkeeper Jean-Claude Ndori was caught out in the fourth minute, when Omar Al-Soma's excellent header from Rawez Lawan's cross left him flapping helplessly. Ndori was rather more composed on 28 minutes, when he turned behind another header - from Mardik Mardikian. The Qasioun Eagles were looking fairly comfortable... but one cross from Kevin Monnet-Paquet just before half-time changed all that. The Saint-√âtienne winger's delivery was converted by Labama Kamana, whose equaliser gave Rwanda the impetus to score again four minutes into the second period. Honor√© Kabongo's close-range volley gave the Wasps a 2-1 lead... for less than three minutes. Nasouh Nakdali's header for Syria appeared to turn the game in another direction, but there would be another sting in the Wasps' up-and-down tale. On 57 minutes, Monnet-Paquet hoovered up a poor long ball from Mahmoud Al-Maowas and hoofed it ahead of Kabongo, who raced away and made it 3-2 to Rwanda. That would be the decisive goal in a thrilling match that had seen five.\n\nSyria - 2 (Omar Al-Soma 4, Nasouh Nakdali 52)\n\nRwanda - 3 (Labama Kamana 45, Honor√© Kabongo 49,57)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Kevin Monnet-Paquet (Rwanda, AM RL/ST C - Saint-√âtienne)\n\nGuinea-Bissau vs Sudan - at Est√°dio 24 de Setembro, Bissau\n\nSouth Sudan may have gone out at their first hurdle three months earlier, but big brothers Sudan were determined not to suffer the same fate. A sixth-minute howitzer from midfielder Elhag El Tahir sent Sudan on their way towards a good opening win in Guinea-Bissau. The hosts did provide a stern test, but a poor shot from Abel Camar√° in the 41st minute that was easily caught by Elmuez Mahgoub suggested that not all was well in the Djurtus camp. They would fall further behind on 56 minutes, when Elhag buried an incisive pass from namesake Mudather El Tahir into the net. To make matters worse for Guinea-Bissau, Wigan Athletic midfielder J√∫nior tore his calf muscle in the 75th minute when his team had already used all three substitutes. The Djurtus hobbled along and claimed a late consolation through Amido Bald√©, but Sudan were very much top dogs after the first leg.\n\nGuinea-Bissau - 1 (Amido Bald√© 89)\n\nSudan - 2 (Elhag El Tahir 6,56)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Elhag El Tahir (Sudan, M C - Al-Merreikh)\n\nCentral African Republic vs Benin - at Stade Barth√©lemy Boganda, Bangui\n\nI'm afraid that this match was one purely for the purists. Both teams conceded too many fouls in a stop-start affair to build up any real attacking momentum. Benin looked like the team most likely to score, as Jordan Ad√©oti and Rudy Gestede each had a couple of shots on target, but Central African Republic goalkeeper Geoffrey Lambet never looked rattled. The same could be said about his Squirrels counterpart Fabien Farnolle, who made one save from Habib Habibou in the fourth minute and did little else. Onlookers could only hope that the second leg would at least provide some drama and excitement.\n\nCentral African Republic - 0\n\nBenin - 0\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Nana Nafiou (Benin, D RC/WB R - Wydad Casablanca)\n\nCanada vs Finland - at BMO Field, Toronto\n\nFinland lost their captain Niklas Moisander to a sprained ankle when he clashed with Canada forward Oliver Occ√©an in the first minute. The Canucks' other frontman would soon pose an even greater threat to the Finns. After six minutes, Lucas Cavallini exchanged passes with Gershon Koffie and then slotted the ball past goalkeeper Luk√°s Hr√°deck√Ω. Canada remained comfortable for the rest of the first half, so Hans Backe and his Finnish team took a few more risks asfter the break. Joel Pohjanpalo had one header saved by Canada goalkeeper Milan Borjan in the 61st minute, and another in the 67th rattled the bar. On the later occasion, Riku Riski was on hand to bury the loose ball and draw Finland level. Riski and co continued to pressurise Borjan before they broke through again on 79 minutes. Pohjanpalo provided another assist as his cut-back was driven in by Kasper H√§m√§l√§inen. Disaster struck for Finland left-back Jere Uronen four minutes later, when he broke his leg in a challenge from Junior Hoilett, but his team-mates defended doggedly to see out the win.\n\nCanada - 1 (Lucas Cavallini 6)\n\nFinland - 2 (Riku Riski 67, Kasper H√§m√§l√§inen 79)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Joel Pohjanpalo (Finland, ST C - Fortuna D√ºsseldorf)\n\nQatar vs Saudi Arabia - at Khalifa International Stadium, Doha\n\nThis Middle Eastern derby was truly extraodinary, and it began with Abdoh Autef volleying Saudi Arabia in front after just 65 seconds. Qatar responded with a few encouraging attacks of their own, including a 10th-minute Sebasti√°n Soria header that sorely tested Saudi keeper Yaser Al-Mosailem. However, the Green Falcons survived those attacks - and a knock to Al-Mosailem - to remain in the lead. When Soria struck the post with barely two minutes left, Qatar's fans seemed like they were about to give up. Within moments, though, a late fightback was well and truly on! Saudi defender Abdulfattah Asiri's clearance from Hamid Ismaeil's cross only found Rodrigo Tabata, who fired Al-Annabi level! Normal time expired soon afterwards, and the two additional minutes were about to run out when Qatar won a corner. Ismaeil swung it in to defensive midfielder Luiz Ceara, who struck the bar. The ball was dipping back into play when Qatar defender Mohammed Kasola nodded it across the goal line to snatch an incredible 2-1 victory from the jaws of defeat!\n\nQatar - 2 (Rodrigo Tabata 88, Mohammed Kasola 90)\n\nSaudi Arabia - 1 (Abdoh Autef 2)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Hamid Ismaeil (Qatar, D/M/AM R - Al-Rayyan)\n\nBotswana vs El Salvador - at National Stadium, Gaborone\n\nBotswana had a defensive disaster in the fifth minute, when defender Musa Ohilwe chested a cross from El Salvador's Alexander Lar√≠n into his own net. Goalkeeper Kabelo Dambe looked furious, and although he made a strong save from Jonathan √Åguila in the 8th minute, his afternoon wouldn't get much better. In the 20th minute, Dembe conceded a second goal, this time to √Åguila. Things could've been even worse for Botswana, as Rodolfo Zelaya twice struck the post either side of that √Åguila goal. While Zelaya could consider himself unfortunate not to have scored two goals, √Åguila did score two goals, the second coming after 47 minutes. Los Cuscatlecos didn't have things all their own way, but with Botswana missing the target with a huge percentage of their shots, it sure felt like it. El Salvador went back home leading 3-0 and looking very comfortable.\n\nBotswana - 0\n\nEl Salvador - 3 (Musa Ohilwe og5, Jonathan √Åguila 20,47)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Alexander Lar√≠n (El Salvador, M L/AM LC - Tigres)\n\nBelize vs Iraq - at FFB Stadium, Belmop√°n\n\nIraq tried to justify their tag as favourites for this tie by making a strong start. Younis Mahmoud went within an inch of giving them the lead on 16 minutes, but his header bounced off the woodwork before being caught by Belize goalie Woodrow West. Ten minutes later, Belize sprung a real surprise by going ahead themselves. Elroy Kuylen's free-kick was perfectly waited for Ian Gaynair to head home and rattle the Iraqis. When Harrison R√≥chez half-volleyed in a second Belize goal on 47 minutes, the Lions of Mesopotamia seemed more like little kittens. Iraq could've received yet more punishment had R√≥chez not flicked a header wide on 54 minutes. Belize were soon quite happy to settle for a 2-0 win. Even over a decade after the tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein was toppled, such a poor result from Iraq could not be tolerated, and they would have to right those wrongs back on home soil.\n\nBelize - 2 (Ian Gaynair 26, Harrison R√≥chez 47)\n\nIraq - 0\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Elroy Kuylen (Belize, AM/M RL - Belmop√°n Bandits)\n\nAzerbaijan vs Zambia - at Olympic Stadium, Baku\n\nZambian hearts sank when midfielder and captain Nathan Sinkala went down with strained knee ligaments after barely a couple of minutes. The Bullets had lost a key man, and five minutes later, they were losing the game. Rahman Haciyev cut V√ºqar Nadirov's pass into the far corner for Azerbaijan, and all looked well for the Milli. Some reckless tacking suggested otherwise, though. Azerbaijan would concede an astonishing 28 fouls, the most significant of which came in the 76th minute. Emin Nouri pushed into Zambia forward Emmanuel Mayuka, whose strike partner Rainford Kalaba drilled in a bullet of a penalty for the Bullets. Kalaba later twisted his knee, ruling him out of the second leg, though not before he almost created a winner for Zambia in the 88th minute. His free-kick found Stoppila Sunzu, whose header from the edge of the area was stopped just in time by Milli goalie S√§l√§hat Aƒüayev.\n\nAzerbaijan - 1 (Rahman Haciyev 7)\n\nZambia - 1 (Rainford Kalaba pen77)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Davies Nkausu (Zambia, D RLC - Free State Stars)\n\nMadagascar vs Norway - at Stade Municipal de Mahamasina, Antananarivo\n\nNorway sprinted out of the traps with two goals in the opening four minutes. Tarik Elyounoussi got the first of them after 47 minutes, finishing off a Martin √òdegaard shot that had been parried by Madagascar keeper Pascal Honor√©. 16-year-old Real Madrid midfielder √òdegaard then enhanced his growing reputation with a superb assist for Veton Berisha just three minutes later. The Norwegians would be in control for most of the first half, although their nerves were jangling when Andria got Madagascar back in the game with a scrappy goal on 43 minutes. Barea then really put the cat amongst the pigeons in the 56th minute, as a second Andria goal put them on level terms. A lesser team may have crumbled after squandering a two-goal lead, but Norway responded by building another. Ole Kristian Seln√¶s broke Malagasy hearts with a powerful strike in the 76th minute. Elyounoussi then secured victory for the Norwegians two minutes later, converting a penalty after Tom H√∏gli had been upended by Madagascar midfielder Dada.\n\nMadagascar - 2 (Andria 43,56)\n\nNorway - 4 (Tarik Elyounoussi 1,pen78, Veton Berisha 4, Ole Kristian Seln√¶s 76)\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Ole Kristian Seln√¶s (Norway, DM/M/AM C - Saint-√âtienne)\n\nRound 3, Leg 2 Results\n\n17 November 2015\n\nBurkina Faso vs Oman - at Stade du 4 Ao√ªt, Ouagadougou\n\nHaving won the first leg in Oman, Burkina Faso wasted no time in strengthening their position at home. They took the lead after just three minutes, when skipper Charles Kabore knocked the ball forward for Issaka Ou√©draogo to finish easily. Another three minutes passed, and then Djakaridja Kon√© helped himself to a goal. Burkina Faso were 3-0 up on aggregate... and they would soon be 3-0 up on this night alone. Kabore again led by example with his second assist, which saw Kon√© bag his second goal. The dream was now all but over for Omar, who did well not to ship any more goals but couldn't score any themselves. Their best efforts came from substitutes Raed Ibrahim Saleh and Mohammed Al-Mashari in the second half, but Stallions keeper Germain Sanoue comfortably caught both of their shots.\n\nBurkina Faso - 3 (Issaka Ou√©draogo 3, Djakaridja Kon√© 6,18)\n\nOman - 0\n\n[Burkina Faso win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Djakaridja Kon√© (Burkina Faso, DM/M C - Sivasspor)\n\nMontenegro vs Ethiopia - at Pod Goricom, Podgorica\n\nStrikers Stevan Jovetic and Mirko Vucinic each flicked headers over the bar early on, but it was a less prolific goalscorer who got Montenegro off the mark after 18 minutes. Right-back Marko Vesovic's deep cross caught Ethiopia goalie Deyas Adugna completely by surprise as it drifted into the top corner of his goal! Montenegro had a few attempts to double their lead in a more conventional fashion before they did just that in the 43rd minute. Vucinic played the ball up to young right-winger Vladimir Rodic, who squirmed it between Adugna and his near post. Though Salahuddin Said retaliated with a goal for Ethiopia very soon afterwards, the Walias' fate was all but sealed. Montenegro were largely untroubled in the second half, and Adam Marusic scored right at the end to secure their Round 4 spot.\n\nMontenegro - 3 (Marko Vesovic 18, Vladimir Rodic 43, Adam Marusic 90)\n\nEthiopia - 1 (Salahuddin Said 44)\n\n[Montenegro win 5-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Salahuddin Said (Ethiopia, ST C - MC Alger)\n\nTogo vs Zimbabwe - at Stade de K√©gu√©, Lom√©\n\nFloyd Ayit√© broke the record for the World Championship's quickest goal when he put Togo in the lead after just 28 seconds. Another goal would've put the Sparrow Hawks level on aggregate with Zimbabwe... but the Warriors would soon pull clear again. Mthulis Maphosa got on the end of Khama Billiat's cross to power in a vital away goal for Zimbabwe after eight minutes. The visitors' subsequent shots all flew high and/or wide, and their qualification for Round 4 was put in doubt again on 33 minutes. An excellent strike into the top corner from Prince Segbefia sent Togo into the second half feeling optimistic. They needed two goals to progress, but a combination of poor shooting and a lack of discipline would bring about their downfall. The fatal blow came when midfielder Sapol Mani was sent off in the 88th minute after his trip on Tinashe Nengomasha led to a second yellow card.\n\nTogo - 2 (Floyd Ayit√© 1, Prince Segbefia 33)\n\nZimbabwe - 1 (Mthulis Maphosa 8)\n\n[Zimbabwe win 3-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Prince Segbefia (Togo, DM/M C - Elazigspor)\n\nFaroe Islands vs Kuwait - at T√≥rsv√∏llur, T√≥rshavn\n\nKuwait had to score twice in the Faroe Islands to avoid exiting the competition. Mashaal Mlabesh's shot in the 16th minute forced Faroes goalkeeper Gunnar Nielsen into a save, while Saif Al-Hashan went one better for Al-Azraq in the 18th minute. However, Kuwait's slender lead would not last. Gilli R√≥lantsson drove in his third goal of the tie after 27 minutes to give the Faroe Islands a little more breathing room. Kuwait now knew that one more goal for them would only be enough for a penalty shoot-out rather than an outright win. Bader Al-Motawa half-volleyed wide a fine chance to get that goal on 48 minutes, while Faisal Al-Harbi pulled a shot wide on 68. The Faroe Islands had lived dangerously at times, but they stood firm and took the draw that sent them through.\n\nFaroe Islands - 1 (Gilli R√≥lantsson 27)\n\nKuwait - 1 (Saif Al-Hashan 18)\n\n[Faroe Islands win 3-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Saif Al-Hashan (Kuwait, M/AM C - Al-Shabab [Saudi Arabia])\n\nBolivia vs The Gambia - at Hernando Siles, La Paz\n\nBetween the 18th and 21st minutes, Modou Barrow missed the target on three separate occasions for The Gambia. Barrow had also had an effort saved by Bolivia goalkeeper Romel Qui√±√≥nez earlier on, but he was not on top form. Alcides Pe√±a was in form, though, and he drove the ball home for Bolivia in the 34th minute after Gambian defender Bubacarr Sanneh failed to clear Martin Smedberg-Dalence's cross. More misses from Barrow in the second half indicated that the Gambia would have to look elsewhere for salvation. Their equaliser came in the 69th minute through an impressive solo effort from Mustapha Jarju... but one goal would not be enough. Mustapha Carayol was twice caught offside late on as the Gambia failed to score the extra goal they needed to prevent Bolivia from scraping through.\n\nBolivia - 1 (Alcides Pe√±a 34)\n\nThe Gambia - 1 (Mustapha Jarju 69)\n\n[3-3 on aggregate, Bolivia win on away goals]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mustapha Jarju (The Gambia, M/ST/AM C - KSK Hasselt)\n\nJordan vs Bahrain - at Amman International Stadium, Amman\n\nJordan won a corner in the 10th minute when Tha'er Bawab's volley was pushed behind by Oman goalkeeper Sayed Mohammed Sayed Jaffar. Abdallah Deeb then drifted in an excellent corner that Mohammad Rateb Al-Dawud nodded home to double Jordan's aggregate lead. Bahrain missed a chance to get a goal back on 24 minutes, when captain Sayed Mohammed Adnan blasted Abdulla Abdo's free-kick wide. Ringo and Rashed Al-Hooti would also come to rue their profligacy as Al-Ahmar fell short and limped out. Jordan could now look forward to playing in Round 4.\n\nJordan - 1 (Mohammad Rateb Al-Dawud 10)\n\nBahrain - 0\n\n[Jordan win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Suleiman Al-Salman (Jordan, D/WB R - Al-Faisaly [Jordan])\n\nHaiti vs Macedonia - at Stade Sylvio Cator, Port-au-Prince\n\nEarly chances from Kervens Belfort and Jeff Louis gave Haiti hope that they could overturn a first-leg deficit against Macedonia. That belief was justified, as Louis nodded them in front after 23 minutes. R√©ginal Goreux's flick-on into the six-yard box caught Macedonian goalie Tome Pacovski completely off his guard, leaving Louis with an open goal. That made it dead level on aggregate, and Macedonian nerves weren't helped when winger Agim Ibraimi sustained a dead leg later in the first half. In an act of desperation, Red Lynxes coach Igor Angelovski made all three of his substitutions at half-time... and one of them would come up trumps. Striker Krste Velkoski took the role of supersub, driving in Goran Pandev's pass in the 77th minute to deal Haiti a hammer blow and secure the visitors' place in Round 4.\n\nHaiti - 1 (Jeff Louis 23)\n\nMacedonia - 1 (Krste Velkoski 77)\n\n[Macedonia win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Daniel Georgievski (Macedonia, D RL/WB R - Melbourne Victory)\n\nArmenia vs Malawi - at Vazgen Sargsyan Hanrapetakan Stadium, Yerevan\n\nAlthough goalkeeper Richard Chipuwa stopped a couple of early shots from Armenia duo Hovhannes Hambardzumyan and Yura Movsisyan, resistance would prove futile for Malawi. The Armenian storm swept the visitors away when Movsisyan powered in Edgar Manucharyan's centre after 41 minutes. Armenia now led 4-0 on aggregate, and they could easily have sat back in the second half if they wanted to. The Havakakan continued to attack after the break, and although they failed to increase their lead, they still went through with consummate ease. They had seen off a mediocre Malawi team that had mustered just the one shot on target - from Atusaye Nyondo in the 63rd minute.\n\nArmenia - 1 (Yura Movsisyan 41)\n\nMalawi - 0\n\n[Armenia win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Edgar Manucharyan (Armenia, AM RL/ST C - Ural Yekaterinburg)\n\nUzbekistan vs Luxembourg - at Paxtakor, Tashkent\n\nWith Uzbekistan comfortably ahead on aggregate, the first half of this second leg was a rather tame one. It wasn't until a horrendous blunder from Uzbek defender Anzur Ismoilov gifted Maurice Deville a goal for Luxembourg just before half-time that things started to pick up. Luxembourg had to score at least twice more to complete the turnaround... but the Red Lions' hopes would be strangled at infancy. Aleksandr Geynrix - Uzbekistan's hat-trick hero from the original tie - continued his fine form by driving in a cross from Islom To'htaho'jaev on 50 minutes. The pair would link up for a second goal 12 minutes later. To'htaho'jaev again found Geynrix in a dangerous position, but the striker needed two bites at the cherry this time before he could beat Luxembourg keeper Jonathan Joubert. Though left-back Vitaly Denisov bruised his ribs late on, the White Wolves of Uzbekistan were safely into the next stage of the World Championship.\n\nUzbekistan - 2 (Aleksandr Geynrix 50,62)\n\nLuxembourg - 1 (Maurice Deville 45)\n\n[Uzbekistan win 6-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Islom To'htaho'jaev (Uzbekistan, D RC - Lokomotiv Tashkent)\n\nSouth Africa vs Namibia - at FNB Stadium, Soweto\n\nNamibia's hopes of overcoming a 2-0 deficit against their big neighbours suffered a couple of cruel blows in the first half. The first was Bongani Ndulula's header from Marc van Heerden's corner, which gave South Africa a three-goal aggregate lead after 16 minutes. The second came when Namibian left-back Brian Brendell broke his leg in a slide-tackle from Oupa Manyisa eight minutes later. Losing an important player to such a serious injury clearly had an effect on the Brave Warriors. Their collective psyche took another dent when striker Benson Shilongo clipped the post in the 43rd minute. Namibia had one more attempt from Jerome Louis just before half-time, which South Africa keeper Itumeleng Khune saved. The visitors then had to batten down the hatches in the second half, doing all they could to prevent Bafana Bafana from increasing their winning margin. The Brave Warriors did bravely go down fighting, even when an injury to attacking midfielder Heinrich Issacks forced them to play the final few minutes with just 10 men.\n\nSouth Africa - 1 (Bongani Ndulula 16)\n\nNamibia - 0\n\n[South Africa win 3-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Marc van Heerden (South Africa, D/WB L - AmaZulu)\n\nBulgaria vs Niger - at Vasil Levski, Sofia\n\nThree yellow cards in the first 15 minutes didn't derail Bulgaria's bid to get to Round 4. They had a host of scoring opportunities before Andrey Galabinov took one of them on the half-hour mark. The Lions now led 3-0 overall and didn't need to take any undue risks against a Niger side that was being thoroughly outclassed. The reckless tackling continued, though - from both ends. Bulgaria would finish off with six bookings and Niger three as a contest that appeared to be over turned instead into something of a dogfight. Bulgaria did start to play football again in second-half injury time, when Marcelinho's close-range finish hammered the last nail into Niger's coffin.\n\nBulgaria - 2 (Andrey Galabinov 30, Marcelinho 90)\n\nNiger - 0\n\n[Bulgaria win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Ivan Bandalovski (Bulgaria, D/WB R - Partizan Belgrade)\n\nHonduras vs S√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe - at Norte e Sur, Tegucigalpa\n\nEven the most optimistic S√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe supporters knew that their time was up when Anthony Lozano's second-minute header gave Honduras a whopping 4-0 lead on aggregate. Los Catrachos continued to assert their class on the tie, with Jona making it 5-0 exactly half an hour into the second leg. The pressure was very much off now for S√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe, so they could relax and start to reproduce the flowing attacking football that had taken them this far. Two goals from Harramiz in the first five minutes of the second half did at least level the tie, even if they didn't lead to a full-scale fightback. The Sele√ß√£o dos Falc√µes e Papagaios had finally gone out of the World Championship, but they definitely wouldn't be forgotten by those who'd followed their progress.\n\nHonduras - 2 (Anthony Lozano 2, Jona 30)\n\nS√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe - 2 (Harramiz 46,50)\n\n[Honduras win 5-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Harramiz (S√£o Tom√© & Pr√≠ncipe, AM R/ST C - Farense)\n\nJamaica vs Sierra Leone - at Independence Park, Kingston\n\nJamaica striker Navion Boyd scored the only goal of the first leg, and he could well have scored again seven minutes into the reverse fixture. However, he was denied by Patrick Bantamoi in the third minute, and then by the post four minutes later. Sierra Leone then had chances to level the tie, but Medo's long-range shot in the 27th minute was caught by Allien Whittaker, and Ibrahim Kallay volleyed wide from much closer to goal ten minutes later. The Leone Stars tried again on 54 minutes, with Mohamed Bangura's low drive being tipped behind by Whittaker. Ten minutes later, though, Jamaica winger Jason Puncheon provided the knockout blow. Puncheon's excellent free-kick was headed in by midfielder Giles Barnes, and the Reggae Boyz were jamming into Round 4.\n\nJamaica - 1 (Giles Barnes 64)\n\nSierra Leone - 0\n\n[Jamaica win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Jason Puncheon (Jamaica, M R/AM RC - Crystal Palace)\n\nLatvia vs Dominican Republic - at Skonto, Riga\n\nThe Dominican Republic were not used to playing in snowy conditions, so it wasn't surprising that Latvia thrived early on in freezing Riga. Vladimirs Kamess' cut-back was hammered home by Artjoms Rudnevs in the 9th minute, and things were looking very bright for the Sarkanbaltsarkanie. Rudnevs almost provided the assist for a second goal on 29 minutes, but Artis Lazdins fired the ball straight into the hands of Dominican goalkeeper Rafael Diaz. That Latvian miss gave Los Quisqueyanos time to settle down and get an equaliser through Jonathan Fana in the 44th minute. Latvia had another reason for concern when full-backs Vladislavs Gabovs and Antons Kurakins collided in the 53rd minute, with Gabovs coming off worse. A minute later, though, a trip on Rudnevs saw Rafael Flores given a second yellow card, leaving the Dominican Republic a man light for the remainder. That dismissal turned the game inexorably towards Latvia, and Kurakins' strike from Igors Tarasovs' corner in the 67th minute ensured that they would go through.\n\nLatvia - 2 (Artjoms Rudnevs 9, Antons Kurakins 67)\n\nDominican Republic - 1 (Jonathan Fana 44)\n\n[Latvia win 4-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Vladimirs Kamess (Latvia, AM/M R - FK Liepaja)\n\nUnited Arab Emirates vs St Vincent & The Grenadines - at Zayed Sports City Stadium, Abu Dhabi\n\nSt Vincent & The Grenadines had some awful luck in the first half-hour. Cornelius Stewart hit a stunning 25-yard shot against the bar in the 25th minute, and then struck the post three minutes later. Those near-misses prevented Vinny Heat from drawing level on aggregate. The visitors did have a reason to be optimistic when United Arab Emirates winger Omar Abdulrahman came up lame with a knee ligament injury on 39 minutes. Abdulrahman's enforced exit would, however, serve as a blessing in disguise for the UAE. He was replaced by Ismael Matar, who would be at the forefront of their attacking efforts in the second period. Matar registered eight shots at goal, five of which were on target - and the last of them would rubber-stamp the Whites' place in Round 4. On 89 minutes, Ismael Salam Al-Hammadi teed up Matar for a powerful finish that put Vinny Heat in the freezer.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates - 1 (Ismael Matar 89)\n\nSt Vincent & The Grenadines - 0\n\n[United Arab Emirates win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Ismael Matar (United Arab Emirates, AM/ST C - Al-Wahda [UAE])\n\nAngola vs Belarus - at Est√°dio 11 de Novembro, Luanda\n\nThe second leg was about as close as the first, and it started rather brightly for Belarus. After 31 minutes, Anton Putilo drove in the first of at least two goals that the Belarusians needed to stay in contention. In the second half, though, Angola charged forward in a bid to finish them off for good. On 47 minutes, Bruno Gaspar played a one-two with Geraldo before hitting a shot that Andrey Gorbunov plucked out of the air. A minute after that, Geraldo went for goal himself, and slammed a 20-yard stunner into the top corner. Sadly, Geraldo's game would soon come to an end after he twisted his ankle in a tackle from Belarus winger Timofey Kalachev. The Sable Antelopes didn't falter, though. As Belarus pushed forward themselves in a bid to turn the game in their favour, Angola decisively hit them on the break in the 83rd minute. Charlton Athletic forward Igor Vetokele latched onto a deep cross from Djalma, and his finish ensured that Angola would emerge victorious.\n\nAngola - 2 (Geraldo 48, Igor Vetokele 83)\n\nBelarus - 1 (Anton Putilo 31)\n\n[Angola win 5-3 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Djalma (Angola, AM/M RL - Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi)\n\nRound 3, Leg 2 Results\n\n18 November 2015\n\nCyprus vs Palestine - at GSP, Nicosia\n\nPalestine were under pressure from very early on. Andreas Makris wasted two real opportunities for Cyprus in the 3rd and 16th minutes, while Dimitris Christofi also had a handful of chances. Palestine not only held on, but they also troubled Cypriot keeper Antonis Giorgallidis with a couple of shots from Omar Jarun and Fahed Attal. However, things started to go badly wrong for the Fedayeen in the 61st minute. Left-back Maharan Abu-Rya was accused of holding back Christofi in the penalty area, and Vincent Laban stepped up a minute later to fire in the subsequent penalty for Cyprus. That gave the Cypriots a bit more breathing room with regards to reaching the next round. Meanwhile, Palestine slowly lost control, with three players getting booked in the final 20 minutes. The last of them was Abu-Rya, whose 89th-minute foul on Konstantinos Charalabidis was punished by the resulting free-kick. Palestine centre-back Javier Cohene could only head Charalabidis' delivery back to Christofi, whose powerful strike ensured that there would be no way back for the Fedayeen.\n\nCyprus - 2 (Vincent Laban pen62, Dimitris Christofi 89)\n\nPalestine - 0\n\n[Cyprus win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Dimitris Christofi (Cyprus, AM/M R - Omonoia Nicosia)\n\nGabon vs Kyrgyzstan - at Stade Omar Bongo, Libreville\n\nGabon started the second leg in lightning-quick fashion with a goal after four minutes. After running onto a weighted pass from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Guelor Kanga surged past Kyrgyzstan defender Faruh Abitov and drilled in Gabon's third goal of the tie. There would be plenty more to come from the Panthers, who used their pace to great effect again in the 27th minute. Right-back Andr√© Poko surged past White Falcons captain Viktor Maier and provided Aubameyang with a cross that the Borussia Dortmund ace headed into the far end of the net. Poko provided another excellent assist four minutes later, when his crossfield ball back to L√©vy Madinda was thundered home by the Spanish-based midfielder. Kyrgyzstan and their beleaguered defence were just unable to cope, and they were exposed for one final time in the 57th minute. Poko completed his hat-trick of assists with an excellent delivery to Kanga, who left Panthers fans purring. Kyrgyzstan's tournament had come to a sorry end.\n\nGabon - 4 (Guelor Kanga 4,57, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 27, L√©vy Madinda 31)\n\nKyrgyzstan - 0\n\n[Gabon win 6-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Guelor Kanga (Gabon, AM/M C - FK Rostov)\n\nLibya vs Thailand - at 11 June Stadium, Tripoli\n\nDespite losing their home leg 2-0, Thailand showed 10 minutes into the rematch that they couldn't be written off just yet. Kroekrit Thaweekan's cross found Teerasil Dangda, whose header found the back of the Libyan net. Dangda attempted to level the aggregate scores from distance in the 37th minute, but Libya goalkeeper Muhammad Nashnoush made light work of his shot. A couple more opportunities from Dangda went to waste before Thailand were hit on the counter-attack. Anthony Ampaipitakwong's cross was headed away by Libya right-back Abdulaziz Beyrash to left-back Ali Salama. Salama sprinted tirelessly from his penalty area to deep in the Thailand half, where he curled a stunning long-range shot past Thai goalkeeper Kawin Thammasatchanan! That was a spirit-shattering moment for the War Elephants, who were slain by the Mediterranean Knights of Libya.\n\nLibya - 1 (Ali Salama 52)\n\nThailand - 1 (Teerasil Dangda 10)\n\n[Libya win 3-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Ali Salama (Libya, D L - Al-Ahli Benghazi)\n\nMorocco vs Malta - at Stade du Prince Moulay Abdallah, Rabat\n\nMalta survived shot after shot after shot from Morocco in the first half. The home team missed a whole host of opportunities, so imagine their frustration when Malta scored with their first shot of the game after 47 minutes. To be fair, it was all Morocco's making, as left-back Achraf Lazaar tripped his counterpart Alex Muscat in the area to concede a penalty that Clayton Failla dispatched for the Falcons. As things stood, a penalty shoot-out was on the cards, but the hosts were determined not to let that happen. The Atlas Lions attacked with even more vigour, and they finally broke Malta's resistance after 73 minutes. Mehdi Carcela's shot rattled the crossbar, but Hakim Ziyech half-volleyed in the rebound to put Morocco back in front. Though they spurned chances to make the scoreline just that little bit more comfortable, a 1-1 draw was still enough to take the North Africans through, courtesy of their narrow first-leg win.\n\nMorocco - 1 (Hakim Ziyech 73)\n\nMalta - 1 (Clayton Failla pen47)\n\n[Morocco win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Achraf Lazaar (Morocco, D/WB/M L - Palermo)\n\nEstonia vs Lebanon - at Lillek√ºla Stadium, Tallinn\n\nLebanon's goal lived a charmed life in the early stages. Goalkeeper Daniel Zeaiter made three excellent saves in the opening eight minutes, though the crossbar had to come to his rescue when Estonia striker Hannes Anier's header beat him in the 15th. A few more Zeaiter saves followed before Estonia went into the half-time break wondering how they weren't leading. They stopped wondering in the 55th minute, when Konstantin Vassiljev did find the net with a shot from Tihhon Sisov's cross. The aggregate scoreline was now 1-1, and with Estonia unable to add to their solitary goal despite their best efforts, a penalty shoot-out would be required to decide who went through. The Blueshirts had had 11 shots on target compared to zero from the Cedars, and the difference in shooting accuracy would reflect on the shoot-out. Lebanon required four attempts before finally getting off the mark at 2-1 down, but Igor Subottin then converted Estonia's fifth penalty to make himself a hero in Tallinn.\n\nEstonia - 1 (Konstantin Vassiljev 55)\n\nLebanon - 0\n\n[1-1 on aggregate, Estonia win 3-1 on penalties]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Konstantin Vassiljev (Estonia, AM/M C - Jagiellonia Bialystok)\n\nUganda vs Kenya - at Mandela National Stadium, Kampala\n\nUganda's attempts to bridge a two-goal gap started promisingly, as captain Geofrey Massa was unlucky to head a shot against the bar on six minutes. By the 12th minute, though, that gap had widened to three goals. George Owino headed in Humphrey Mieno's corner to put Kenya within touching distance of the next phase. Four minutes later, Denis Iguma put the result back up in the air with a 30-yard screamer for Uganda. The Cranes' comeback continued when Massa broke through the Kenyan defence to put away Patrick Ochan's cross in the 39th minute. Alas, that was as far as Uganda would get. Dennis Oliech's strike three minutes into the second period put Kenya back on track, and the Harambee Stars never looked back. Further goals from Aboud Omar in the 82nd minute and Victor Wanyama shortly afterwards ensured that Kenya would overturn their seeded neighbours, although that outcome was not a major surprise.\n\nUganda - 2 (Denis Iguma 16, Geofrey Massa 39)\n\nKenya - 4 (George Owino 12, Dennis Oliech 48, Aboud Omar 82, Victor Wanyama 83)\n\n[Kenya win 7-3 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Victor Wanyama (Kenya, DM/M C - Southampton)\n\nChina vs Lithuania - at Shenzhen City Stadium, Shenzhen\n\nLithuania were cursing their luck in the 17th minute, when an apparent foul on their winger Saulius Mikoliunas by Zheng Zheng in the Chinese penalty area went unpunished. Two minutes later, though, it was their turn to benefit from a slice of fortune, as China winger Wu Lei struck the post, albeit from a tight angle. The game's next big moment came on 52 minutes, when Lithuania had a second penalty claim. This time, Chinese midfielder Cai Huikang was punished for a high challenge, and Lukas Spalvis duly drilled the ball home from 12 yards. Lithuania continued to build up precious momentum from there, and in the 78th minute, Deivydas Matulevicius' volley gave them the aggregate lead. The Dragons looked set to crash out on their own ground... until Wu Lei delighted the home fans with a headed goal three minutes from the end! That made it 3-3 on aggregate, and so the tie went to a penalty shoot-out that was decided in the seventh round. After home goalkeeper Zeng Cheng saved from Mikoliunas, right-back Wu Xi powered in the spot-kick that sent China through 6-5!\n\nChina - 1 (Wu Lei 87)\n\nLithuania - 2 (Lukas Spalvis pen52, Deivydas Matulevicius 78)\n\n[3-3 on aggregate, China win 6-5 on penalties]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Deivydas Matulevicius (Lithuania, ST C - AFC Botosani)\n\nRwanda vs Syria - at Stade Amahoro, Kigali\n\nRwanda's front three all had multiple chances to extend their aggregate lead against Syria in the opening 30 minutes. When the Wasps did at last manage to sting the Syrians on 35 minutes, though, the decisive blow came from a midfielder's foot. Jean-Baptiste Mugiraneza took the plaudits when he slipped the ball past visiting goalkeeper Mousab Balhous and gave his team a narrow half-time lead. With the Qasioun Eagles seldom looking like they could trouble their hosts, a single second-leg goal would be enough to send Rwanda through 4-2 on aggregate. The final margin could've been a bit more emphatic had Mwesigye Tibingana not hit the upright in the 73rd minute, or if Honor√© Kabongo had converted any of his 11 shots at goal.\n\nRwanda - 1 (Jean-Baptiste Mugiraneza 35)\n\nSyria - 0\n\n[Rwanda win 4-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Mwesigye Tibingana (Rwanda, M/AM C - Arm√©e Patriotique Rwandaise)\n\nSudan vs Guinea-Bissau - at Al-Merreikh Stadium, Omdurman\n\nSudan's single-goal lead looked far from secure in the early stages, as goalkeeper Elmuez Mahgoub was called upon on a number of occasions to dispel any early Guinea-Bissau attacks. The Falcons of Jediane had their feathers ruffled further in the 31st minute, when Abel Camar√° fired in Sami's right-wing cross for the visitors. Sudan still just about had the edge on away goals, but some excellent attacking moves from Guinea-Bissau late in the first half suggested that things would soon change. Sure enough, with 15 minutes left to play, the Djurtus completed the turnaround. Mahgoub was left flat-footed as Gerso slotted the ball past him and sent the visiting supporters into raptures. A solid defensive display from Guinea-Bissau in the closing stages would see them through, though not before Sudan left-back Boya compounded his team's misery by receiving a second yellow card in injury time.\n\nSudan - 0\n\nGuinea-Bissau - 2 (Abel Camar√° 31, Gerso 75)\n\n[Guinea-Bissau win 3-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Sami (Guinea-Bissau, AM RL - Akhisar Belediyespor)\n\nBenin vs Central African Republic - at Stade de l'Amiti√©, Cotonou\n\nBenin provided a lesson in how not to manage a home second leg after the first game had finished level. The Squirrels went behind after just 11 minutes, when Habib Habibou's strike from Eloge Enza-Yamissi's free-kick got the Central African Republic up and running. As the Wild Beasts took control, Benin's three-man frontline lost its way completely. Razak Omotoyossi, St√©phane Sessegnon and Rudy Gestede were all guilty of some awful misses before an even bigger mistake at the other end cost Benin even more. Defender Emmanuel Imorou held back Habibou in the area to concede a penalty after 68 minutes. David Manga's spot-kick was saved by Fabien Farnolle, but he made light work of the rebound for 2-0. When J√©sus Konnsimbal added a third goal on 74 minutes, CAR fans could metaphorically 'start the car' - they were safely through. Omotoyossi did score two goals for Benin, including one from the penalty spot, in the final five minutes, but they had come far too late to save the shoddy Squirrels.\n\nBenin - 2 (Razak Omotoyossi 86,pen88)\n\nCentral African Republic - 3 (Habib Habibou 11, David Manga 68, J√©sus Konnsimbal 74)\n\n[Central African Republic win 3-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Razak Omotoyossi (Benin, ST C - unattached)\n\nFinland vs Canada - at Helsingin Olympiastadion, Helsinki\n\nAfter a nervy opening half-hour, it was Finland who settled down first in the 33rd minute. Roman Eremenko fired in a superb corner delivery from Kari Arkivuo to double the flying Finns' aggregate lead. In the 53rd minute, though, a less positive contribution from left-back Arkivuo let Canada back into the match. His back-headed clearance from Cyle Larin's cross dipped towards Scott Arfield, whose volley clipped the underside of the crossbar and went in. Another goal from the Canucks would've raised the prospect of a shoot-out... but Kasper H√§m√§l√§inen removed that possibility in the 71st minute. The Legia Warsaw midfielder cracked a shot into the top corner of Milan Borjan's goal to freeze Canada out and send Finland through.\n\nFinland - 2 (Roman Eremenko 33, Kasper H√§m√§l√§inen 71)\n\nCanada - 1 (Scott Arfield 53)\n\n[Finland win 4-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Perparim Hetemaj (Finland, M LCR - Chievo Verona)\n\nSaudi Arabia vs Qatar - at King Fahd International Stadium, Riyadh\n\nConsidering the manner of their first-leg defeat, the Saudis' frame of mind can't have been too positive heading into the second leg. Yahya Al-Shehri did have a couple of opportunities to draw them level in the 24th and 28th minutes, but Qasem Burhan saved for Qatar on each occasion. The Green Falcons would feel even worse in the 45th minute. Goalkeeper Yaser Al-Mosailem's parry from Rodrigo Taba only opened the door for Hamid Ismaeil to drill in a rebound shot for Qatar. Despite that, Saudi Arabia showed real fighting spirit to cancel that goal out through Fahid Al-Muwallad in the 49th minute. They then huffed and puffed before Al-Muwallad scored again, thanks to a cheeky backheel from Mohammed Al-Nakhli, in the 82nd minute. The Saudis had done a 'Qatar' on Qatar, and with both legs finishing 2-1 to the hosts, the tie came down to penalties! Each side converted two of their first five kicks, and so the shoot-out went into sudden death. Awadh Khrees gave Saudi Arabia a 3-2 lead before Khalid Muftah stepped up for Qatar... and had his shot punched away by Al-Mosailem! The Green Falcons were through!\n\nSaudi Arabia - 2 (Fahid Al-Muwallad 49,82)\n\nQatar - 1 (Hamid Ismaeil 45)\n\n[3-3 on aggregate, Saudi Arabia win 3-2 on penalties]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Fahad Al-Muwallad (Saudi Arabia, ST C - Al-Ittihad [Saudi Arabia])\n\nEl Salvador vs Botswana - at Estadio Jorge M√°gico Gonz√°lez, San Salvador\n\nAn exciting first half saw plenty of goalmouth action, but no goals, though Jonathan √Åguila did hit the post for El Salvador on 23 minutes. As for the second half, that saw a fair bit of drama... and some goals to boot! It was Botswana who struck first after 53 minutes through Mogakolodi Ngele, but their fans wouldn't be celebrating for long. Three minutes later, √Åguila's header from Darwin Cer√©n's corner led to a difficult save from Botswana keeper Kabelo Dambe. Zebras defender Musa Ohilwe then scuffed his attempted clearance back to √Åguila, who struck at the second time of asking. El Salvador's three-goal lead from the first leg was back in full, and Los Cuscatlecos would soon look to improve on it. After Isidro Guti√©rrez hit the post in the 66th minute, Rodolfo Zelaya went one better in the 69th to effectively send El Salvador into the next round.\n\nEl Salvador - 2 (Jonathan √Åguila 56, Rodolfo Zelaya 69)\n\nBotswana - 1 (Mogakolodi Ngele 53)\n\n[El Salvador win 5-1 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Darwin Cer√©n (El Salvador, M/DM C - Orlando City)\n\nIraq vs Belize - at Basra International Stadium, Basra\n\nYounis Mahmoud hit the woodwork for Iraq early on in the first leg, and he would do so again here, with his 10th-minute header bouncing off the bar and going behind. Instead of wondering what they had to do to overturn a 2-0 deficit, Iraq took a more proactive approach and carried on with their positive attacking play. They would reap the rewards for their patience after 40 minutes, when Ali Adnan received a crossfield ball from Mahmoud and powered it home from out wide. Iraq erased their arrears completely five minutes later, as Ala'a Abdul-Zahrah Al-Azzawi slipped Samal Saeed's cross into the net. Belize could hardly believe that they'd squandered a solid lead... and there would be more pain to come. Another cross from Saeed in the 50th minute ricocheted off Belize captain Dalton Eiley's chest and into the net for Iraq's third goal. That goal mortally wounded the Jaguars, and it was the Lions of Mesopotamia who ruled the pride, at least where this tie was concerned.\n\nIraq - 3 (Ali Adnan 40, Ala'a Abdul-Zahrah Al-Azzawi 45, Dalton Eiley og50)\n\nBelize - 0\n\n[Iraq win 3-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Samal Saeed (Iraq, D RC - Al-Talaba)\n\nZambia vs Azerbaijan - at Independence Stadium, Lusaka\n\nThe ball was in Zambia's court after they drew away from home... but Azerbaijan retook the initiative after seven minutes. The hosts failed to clear their lines following a corner from Dimitrij Nazarov, allowing Rahid √Ñmirquliyev to give the Milli a slender lead. Zambia then missed a bunch of potential equalising chances, including when Emmanuel Mayuka's header went behind off the crossbar after 33 minutes. Their wastefulness was in stark contrast to Azerbaijan's clinicalness. The visitors countered to devastating effect in the 54th minute, when √Ñmirquliyev bagged his second goal. After being superbly set up by Vagif Cavadov, √Ñmirquliyev returned the favour to Cavadov by creating a goal for his compatriot on 66 minutes. Azerbaijan were three goals up now, and not even an 86th-minute injury to winger V√ºqar Nadirov could stop them from going through. Neither could an injury-time goal from Zambia striker Evans Kangwa, who benefited from a miscued pass by Azerbaijani defender Ufuk Badak, but only when the match had already been won and lost.\n\nZambia - 1 (Evans Kangwa 90)\n\nAzerbaijan - 3 (Rahid √Ñmirquliyev 7,54, Vagif Cavadov 66)\n\n[Azerbaijan win 4-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Rahid √Ñmirquliyev (Azerbaijan, DM/M C - Qarabag Agdam)\n\nNorway vs Madagascar - at Ullevaal Stadion, Oslo\n\nThe recent emergence of 16-year-old Martin √òdegaard as a star player for Norway proved the old adage that if you're good enough, you're old enough. √òdegaard's latest achievement of what was already a record-breaking career was to become the World Championship's youngest scorer after 24 minutes. As if Norway didn't need any more goals to book their place in the next round, they scored two more before the break. Firstly, Pal Andr√© Helland drove in Omar Elabdellaoui's byline cross to get his name on the scoresheet after 32 minutes. Eight minutes after that, Elabdellaoui delighted the hosts again by providing an excellent cross for captain Tarik Elyounoussi, who made it 7-2 on aggregate. Poor old Madagascar had been punched out, and after one solitary blocked shot from Claudio Ramiadamanana in the 64th minute, they were already on the canvas. Reality had hit home for Barea, whose tournament ended on an even darker note with midfielder Dada's dismissal for two yellow cards after 89 minutes.\n\nNorway - 3 (Martin √òdegaard 24, Pal Andr√© Helland 32, Tarik Elyounoussi 40)\n\nMadagascar - 0\n\n[Norway win 7-2 on aggregate]\n\nMAN OF THE MATCH: Omar Elabdellaoui (Norway, D/WB/M R - Olympiacos)\n\nParis Attacks & Latter Qualifiers Draw\n\nThe events of 13 November 2015 were truly horrifying for many people, not least in Paris. A series of coordinated terrorist attacks in and around the French capital left a wake of devastation that shocked the world.\n\nFirstly, between 9:20pm and 9:53pm Central European Time, a trio of suicide bombers detonated their vests near the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. The first explosion took place midway through the first half of a charity football match - involving legends of French and German football - that was taking place at the stadium. Among those in attendance were France's President, Fran√ßois Hollande, and Germany's Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nAlthough there were no casualties inside the stadium, four people died as a result of the blasts outside - the three suicide bombers, and one civilian.\n\nMeanwhile in northern Paris, between 9:25pm and 9:40pm, there were shootings at two caf√©s and one restaurant, as well as a bombing at another restaurant. 40 people were killed and and at least another 40 were injured.\n\nThe worst, though, was to come at the nearby Bataclan theatre. At approximately 9:40pm, three gunmen stormed into the theatre and opened fire on around 1,500 people who were attending a concert by the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nThe attacks lasted around 20 minutes, and then the perpetrators took 60-100 concertgoers hostage. Around two hours later, police stormed the theatre to rescue the hostages. Two of the attackers detonated their suicide vests, and the third was killed after his vest blew up under police gunfire.\n\n89 people perished in the Bataclan massacre. In total, 130 innocent victims and seven perpetrators lost their lives on that horrible night.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - known to many as ISIS, ISIL, or just Islamic State - claimed responsibilities for the attacks. All of the attackers were EU nationals who had fought for the jihadist militant group in Syria. The suspected instigator of the attacks - Belgian national Abdelhamid Abbaoud - was killed in a police raid in Saint-Denis five days later.\n\nParis had been on high alert since January 2015, following attacks at the headquarters of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and at a Jewish supermarket.\n\nAfter these latest attacks, serious doubts were raised as to whether Paris was safe enough to stage the World Championship climax the following summer. A week after the atrocities, prior to the draws for Rounds 4 and 5 of the World Championship at FIFA's headquarters, Gio Bambini made this statement:\n\n\"We at FIFA were obviously in complete shock at the terrorist attacks in France a week ago. On behalf of FIFA, I want to express the solidarity of the international football community towards the people of France, and especially the people of Paris. I also want to express my sincerest and deepest condolences to the families of the victims.\n\n\"I also want to say this. We will not allow the very small minority to disrupt the way of life of the majority. Terrorism will not "
