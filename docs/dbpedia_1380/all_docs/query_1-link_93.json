        "text": "Newcastle may yet shock us all today, and rather than just moving players out of the club, we may find we have a player coming in, and it’s not one for Peter Beardsley’s Development squad either.\n\nDaniel Wass – 25 year-old versatile player\n\nWe have been linked today with a deadline day move for Evian’s 25 year-old Danish International full-back Daniel Wass, who can also play on the wing and in either full-back position.\n\nAnd since Davide Santon has moved out on loan to Italy, it could it be that Newcastle have actually thought this one through and are bringing in a replacement for the Italian.\n\nThat would certainly shock Newcastle fans, but it could also be true.\n\nDaniel has 11 caps for Denmark and played for every one of the Danish Youth sides, and he moved to Evian in June, 2012 from Benfica, so it looks like he’s been watched by Graham Carr and his scouting team.\n\nWass has played 135 times for Evian after leaving Benfica, where he never played a first team game for the Portuguese giants.\n\nDaniel also has impressive 27 goals with 12 assist, so he is a productive player indeed.\n\nWass stands 5’11” tall and started his career at Brondy back in 2007, and he played 99 times for the Danish club with 10 goals and 7 assists – again a good return in goals and assists from the player.\n\nEvian paid around £2M for him from Benfica, so he likely will not cost too much more than that to move to Newcastle United.\n\nThat’s right up Newcastle’s street, since we like to sign players for low fees and sell them for high fees – very much like what you try to do with stocks and shares to make money.\n\nThis lad could be a very decent signing for Newcastle.\n\nComments welcome.\n\nYou can follow us on our three social media sites below:"
