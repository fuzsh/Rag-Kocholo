INSIDESTORIES MERKEL ARRIVES IN EGYPT FOR TALKS ON MIGRATION P4 His Majesty issues Royal Decree Asaad is Deputy PM for International Relations MUSCAT: His Majesty Sultan Qaboos on Thursday issued Royal Decree No 10/2017 appointing a Deputy Prime Minister for International Relations and Cooperation Affairs, and Personal Representative of His Majesty the Sultan. Article (1) appoints His Highness Sayyid Asaad bin Tareq al Said as Deputy Prime Minister for International Relations and Cooperation Affairs and Personal Representative of His Majesty the Sultan. Article (2) says that this decree shall be published in the Philippines to bring back death penalty MANILA: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s campaign to bring back the death penalty for drug-related crimes has cleared a major hurdle, with supporters backing it in Congress but critics denouncing the planned killings as “inhumane”. The death penalty bill, along with a proposed measure to punish children as young as nine as adult criminals, are key planks of Duterte’s controversial drug war that has already claimed more than 6,500 lives. A majority of politicians in the Lower House of Congress passed a second reading of the bill on Wednesday night, clearing one of the biggest obstacles in proponents’ plans to make the death penalty legal by May. A third and final reading still needs to be held next week, although with no more debates both sides agree passage is a formality. Then the Senate, which is similarly dominated by Duterte’s allies, would pass a counterpart bill. Opponents voiced anger the Philippines would bring back the death penalty, 11 years after it was revoked, highlighting among many concerns a corrupt justice system that would lead to innocent being executed. — AFP Official Gazette and enforced on its date of issue. — ONA THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE BATINAH EXPRESSWAY <strong>BARKA</strong>-<strong>RUSTAQ</strong> section opens Sunday ZAINAB AL NASSRI MUSCAT, MARCH 2 The first package of Batinah Expressway project linking Barka and Rustaq will be opened for traffic on March 5 by the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC). The 45 km stretch is part of the six packages of a new main road and an arterial south road connecting wilayats of Batinah, according to an official statement from the ministry. It will open by the end of 2017. The route stretches from the end of Muscat Expressway near Halban Intersection to Khatmat Milahah in Shinas with a total length of 272 km. It provides an alternative to the current Batinah road that links Oman with the neighbouring countries. It eases traffic congestion towards Muscat since it offers an alternative route for traffic originating from the current Batinah Dual carriageway, especially the Rustaq and Ibri-Rustaq road. The first package starts from the end of Muscat Expressway (Halban Intersection) in Barka to Khabat Al Qadan (45.5 km). It comprises five intersections, five flyovers, two wadi crossing bridges and an underpass. It also includes 235 box culverts and a provision for camel crossing. The second package, from Khabat Al Qadan to The Muscat International Book Fair is not just about books, authors and distributors, but also a platform for discussions and debates on matters of social and national importance. SEE PAGE 3 Wadi Al Hamili in Suwaiq (44.75 km), includes four intersections, a flyover, seven wadi crossing bridges and two underpasses. It also includes 165 box culverts and a rest area.

All these packages include four 3.75m-wide lanes on each side, a 12m wide traffic island, 3m external asphalt shoulder, 2m internal asphalt shoulders, 31 wadi crossing bridges and 23 intersections. The project also includes 25 wadi crossing bridges and box culverts of various sizes, trucks weighing stations, ambulance spots and parking for Royal Oman Police (ROP) vehicles. Le Pen loses immunity over tweets BRUSSELS: The European Parliament on Thursday lifted French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen’s immunity from prosecution over her tweeting of images of IS atrocities. The move paves the way for France to pursue a case against the far-right National Front leader, after prosecutors launched a probe in 2015 over the graphic pictures, which included the decapitated body of US journalist James Foley. “The result is clear, a big majority is in favour of the lifting of immunity,” acting parliament speaker Dimitrios Papadimoulis said. The ruling is effective immediately for Le Pen, a National Front MEP, European Parliament officials said. But the decision concerns only the tweets, and not a separate probe into allegations that Le Pen misused public funds when hiring a parliamentary aide, they said. — AFP MALAYSIA TO DEPORT N KOREAN ARRESTED IN KIM KILLING PELOSI CALLS ON SESSIONS TO QUIT AFTER RUSSIA CONTACTS WEATHER TODAY MUSCAT MAX: 28 0 C MIN: 20 0 C SALALAH MAX: 29 0 C MIN: 20 0 C SUNRISE 06.27 AM PRAYER TIMINGS FAJR: 05:12 DHUHR: 12:24 ASR: 15:45 MAGHRIB: 18:16 ISHA: 19:26 P5 P7 NIZWA MAX: 32 0 C MIN: 19 0 C STUNNING SHOW Spectators take pictures of planes performing in an airshow as part of the ‘Union Fortress Live Military Demonstration’, at the Abu Dhabi Corniche on Thursday. — AFP Suspend visa-free EU travel for US citizens: Lawmakers BRUSSELS: United States citizens should be denied visa-free access to the European Union before summer because Washington does not allow some EU nationals to enter there without visa, EU lawmakers said in a vote on Thursday. The European Parliament vote is set to put pressure on the European Commission, the EU’s executive, to enforce a one-year suspension as a titfor-tat measure for Washington’s denial of visa-free access to citizens of Poland, Croatia, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, all members of the 28-country bloc. A Commission official said contacts are ongoing with the US administration “to push for full visa reciprocity,” but fell short of saying that immediate action will be taken. The Parliament, by a show of hands, urged the Commission to adopt restrictive measures against US citizens TIT-FOR-TAT: RESTRICTIVE MEASURES COULD COME ‘WITHIN TWO MONTHS’ “within two months”. “The Commission will report on further progress before the end of June 2017,” the EU executive official said. EU rules say that a decision to end visa-free access should be taken within two years from a first notice to countries that do not grant free access to EU citizens. The first notification of the US lack of reciprocity was sent in April 2014. Parliament argues that as a result the Commission has been “legally obliged” to take measures. — Reuters"
