        "text": "Daniel Wass has two goals and four assists in the 2019/20 season to this point, and he has played more than 2,000 minutes, and it is this level of performance which has made it difficult for Valencia to recruit a wide player in the January market.\n\nThe idea had been to sign a player in that position a number of months ago, yet few could have foreseen Wass being so effective from the right-hand side this term.\n\nHe has proven himself to be the reliable and versatile player that every coach loves to work with, and has settled into life as a wing-back with relative ease.\n\nLos Che have thus been forced to rethink their transfer plans, and it's now likely they will settle on Wass being their first choice right-back and wait for Cristiano Piccini to recover from injury."
