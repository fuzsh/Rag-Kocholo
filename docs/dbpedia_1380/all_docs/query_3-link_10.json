        "text": "Daniel Wass has joined Atletico Madrid on a contract until 2023, giving Diego Simeone a replacement for Kieran Trippier after the Englishman joined Newcastle United.\n\nThe 32-year-old midfielder joins from Valencia and will be used primarily on the right of defence, providing depth beyond Sime Vrsaljko, and reducing the need to use Marcos Llorente in defence as an emergency.\n\nDanish international Wass has played much of this season in midfield at Estadio Mestalla, and Simeone has also been impressed by his displays there.\n\nThe coach has given the green light to the deal and approves of his versatility and experience in LaLiga Santander, meaning he won't need any time to adjust to the competition.\n\nAtletico's limited budget and wage cap mean that the club were unable to pursue a world-leading right-back in the winter transfer window.\n\nThe transfer has now been completed for a fee of 2.7 million euros plus add-ons following weeks of negotiations.\n\nThe big signing, in the summer\n\nWass, who was out of contract at Valencia in the summer, covers an immediate need for Atletico, who will look to bring in a long-term solution in the summer."
