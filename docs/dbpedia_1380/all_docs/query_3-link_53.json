However, it does not seem that Valencia has an interest in letting the Danish national team back change away. Wass has asked the club to be sold to Atletico Madrid and is pushing at the club.\n\nShould it end up with the trade not coming in, however, the Spanish champions from Madrid have chosen another Dane. According to the Spanish media AS, Atletico Madrid is interested in picking up Rasmus Nissen Kristensen and is investigating how to pick up the Dane.\n\nThe former FC Midtjylland full-back enjoys great success in the Austrian RB Salzburg, where he occasionally also wears the captain's armband. His achievements in Austria have attracted the attention of several clubs in Europe, and now also the Spanish champions.\n\nAtletico Madrid have just sold Englishman Kieran Trippier to newcomer Newcastle, and are therefore missing a right-back.\n\nNissen Kristensen has this season scored eight goals and seven assists in 28 matches for RB Salzburg in all tournaments. He has a contract with the Austrian champions club until 2025."
