        "text": "Everton are understood to be interested in bringing Danish midfielder Daniel Wass to the Premier League from La Liga club Celta Vigo.\n\nThe average Everton fan might not know a huge amount about Daniel Wass.\n\nThe Sun (June 3, page 60) reported that the Toffees are interested in signing the Celta Vigo midfielder, who could be available for as little as £5 million this summer.\n\nAnd Spanish publication Marca has since claimed that Wass’s agent is negotiating a move away from the Galician side, with Marcel Brands pressing ahead with plans to bring the Dane to Goodison Park.\n\nAnd should Everton win the race ahead of Valencia and Roma, the Toffees could quickly become one of the most dangerous sides in the Premier League from set-pieces.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson was Everton’s go-to free-kick taker last season but Wass is so impressive from a dead ball that the Icelandic play-maker could be at risk of losing his place at the front of the queue.\n\nThe former Evian ace is a wizard from free-kick situations, blessed with a Cristiano Ronaldo-like ability to smash through the back of the ball with fearsome pace and unpredictable movement. Wass’s style makes shots from range or whipped deliveries into the box a nightmare for defenders and goalkeepers to deal with.\n\nSo the likes of Cenk Tosun should be thrilled about the prospect of profiting from Wass’s trademark technique next season.\n\nWith Sigurdsson and Wass looming over a dead ball, Everton could strike fear into the heart of opposition back lines."
