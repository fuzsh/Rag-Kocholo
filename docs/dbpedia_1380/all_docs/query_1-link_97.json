        "text": "Real Madrid battled to a 2-0 home win against Valencia in La Liga thanks to an early own goal scored by Daniel Wass and a late Lucas Vazquez strike.\n\nIsco was back in the squad after being left out entirely for the Champions League win at Roma in midweek, but Santiago Solari again opted not to name the Spain playmaker in the XI.\n\nMarcos Llorente thrived in midfield in Isco's absence but Madrid needed an eighth-minute intervention from Wass to take the lead on Saturday.\n\nREAD: Solari shuts down Isco rift talk\n\nDani Carvajal crossed from close to the byline on the right wing and Wass sent an attempted clearing header flying past goalkeeper Neto, while Thibaut Courtois was in fine form at the other end.\n\nVazquez – who also scored in the 2-0 win over Roma – slotted in the decisive second for Madrid with seven minutes to go, the goal surviving a lengthy VAR review, to claim all three points.\n\nMadrid started well and took the lead in just the eighth minute, albeit in fortuitous circumstances.\n\nCarvajal won back possession deep in the Valencia half and delivered a chipped cross to the front post that Wass could only guide into the roof of his own net.\n\nREAD: 'Now is not the time to join Real Madrid'\n\nNeto made a brilliant save to deny Gareth Bale and a long-range Dani Parejo shot was easily dealt with by Courtois.\n\nValencia should have equalised in the 53rd minute, Santi Mina racing onto an excellent Parejo ball over the top of the Madrid defence but hitting his shot too high to trouble the Belgium goalkeeper.\n\nAnother Parejo ball caused chaos in the Madrid box but, arriving at the back post, defender Gabriel was stretching and sent his volleyed effort flying over the crossbar.\n\nMadrid almost extended its lead in the 72nd minute when substitute Marco Asensio was teed up by Llorente, Cristiano Piccini making a sensational block to stop the shot.\n\nAfter Courtois brilliantly denied Michy Batshuayi, Isco was introduced for the last 10 minutes, with Karim Benzema then teeing up Vazquez for the clinching goal to ensure Madrid moved up to fifth in the LaLiga table."
