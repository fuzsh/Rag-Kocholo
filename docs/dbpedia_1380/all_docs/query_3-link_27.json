        "text": "Atletico Madrid did not want to lose Kieran Trippier, but the lure of home and Newcastle United’s new financial status after their October takeover was enough to persuade him two and a half years with the current Spanish champions was enough.\n\nTrippier will not be easily replaced, especially not at mid-season. He settled quickly at Atletico, which not all new signings do, following his move from Tottenham in the summer of 2019 and provided a level of reliability and effectiveness in defence and attack that made him arguably one of the very most important players in last season’s title win.\n\nThe England full-back also has a tactical flexibility which was very useful to coach Diego Simeone, as it has been to Gareth Southgate at international level. Trippier most often played right wing-back in a 3-5-2, but was also used regularly on the right of a traditional back four.\n\nSo ideally, his replacement will also be comfortable in both these systems, which Atletico have continued to switch between, often within games. They have also made a point recently of targeting players comfortable in different positions — such as current key squad members Mario Hermoso, Yannick Carrasco and Marcos Llorente.\n\nAtletico play more football these days than earlier in Simeone’s decade as their coach, and Trippier was really important to their build-up play, working the ball into good positions down the right. He provided 11 assists in 86 games for Atletico in total — including a curling cross headed in by Alvaro Morata which sparked David Beckham comparisons 23 minutes into his debut against Getafe, and the whipped delivery right onto Luis Suarez’s forehead for the only goal in a key win over Alaves on last season’s title run-in.\n\nSimeone remains Simeone, though, so any defender at Atletico has to be strong in the tackle, and it would help if they were good in the air too. A player who could also play right-sided centre-back would be a very useful addition, given their lack of cover there at the moment.\n\nAll of this makes identifying who Atletico should move for now very difficult, and the challenge is represented by the array of names mentioned as potential targets in the local press. These include Chelsea’s Spain international Cesar Azpilicueta, Lille’s Zeki Celik, Valencia’s Daniel Wass and Wolves’ La Liga old boy Nelson Semedo — all players with very different skill sets and experiences.\n\nAs usual at Atletico, Simeone has a say in transfer deliberations, but only along with sporting director Andrea Berta and chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin.\n\nOne possibility is they take advantage of a cheaper market opportunity this month, before going for their preferred long-term replacement for the right side of the defence in the summer.\n\n“The club knows clearly what we need, what we want, what we are looking for,” Simeone said last week, keeping his cards close to his chest.\n\nNordi Mukiele\n\nAmong the players linked with Atletico in the speculation about Trippier replacements has been RB Leipzig’s versatile Mukiele — and the 24-year-old Frenchman ticks a lot of the boxes.\n\nMukiele has experience at right-back, right-side centre-back and right midfielder, having featured in various tactical shapes since joining Leipzig in the German Bundesliga from Ligue 1 side Montpellier in the summer of 2018 for €16 million.\n\nSmarterscout’s advanced metrics can also help understand Mukiele’s strengths and weaknesses and what he could bring for Atletico.\n\nTheir rating from zero to 99 looks at either how often a player carries out a certain action (such as shooting volume) compared with others at their position, or their effectiveness in a certain function (such as how well they progress the ball upfield). The numbers presented here are adjusted to a Premier League standard, which may differ slightly from La Liga.\n\nMukiele is a couple of inches taller than Trippier, at around 6ft 1in, which would also come in handy were he needed to play as one of either two or three centre-backs for Atletico.\n\nWhile playing right-back this season, his aerial duels rating of 99 looks very interesting, as do his scores for defending intensity (91) and ball recoveries and interceptions (98).\n\nIn other words, there is a less than 10 per cent chance that another right-back at this level will be more active than Mukiele in contesting headers, closing down opponents, or collecting loose balls and stray passes.\n\nMukiele’s impressive pace would be useful in getting forward on the overlap in attack, as well as covering at the back — where Atletico have been caught on the counter surprisingly often this season.\n\nWith Leipzig, he has even made regular runs into the box to have a pop himself, giving him an expected goals (xG) of at least 0.10 per 90 minutes each of the last three seasons — something which Simeone may or may not feel is a good idea.\n\nMukiele is not a bad crosser either, preferring lower deliveries — perhaps because of how Leipzig like to attack. He has just one assist in 23 games this season, more or less in his line with his expected assists (xA) of 0.06 per 90 minutes, but this may be improved if he played in a team focused more around deliveries from wide.\n\nSmarterscout gives high marks for Mukiele’s attacking contributions, with his ball progression, creation of chances and link-up play metrics all well above average when playing at wing-back (represented as right midfield in the data — arguably making it more impressive in his case, as he is being compared to players in more attacking roles).\n\nBall retention looks to be an issue (24 out of 99 at full-back and just 13/99 when at wing-back) — especially given Trippier was often heavily involved as Atletico brought the ball out from the back, often linking with midfielders Koke and Llorente.\n\nThere may be some other stylistic issues, as Leipzig are one of the Bundesliga’s most energetic pressing teams, while Atletico are lower mid-table in La Liga’s PPDA rankings.\n\nMukiele’s tendency to press high means he can win possession back often, but also leave space in behind him. He ranks highly for defensive intensity and ball-winning but not so well for preventing opponents from progressing the ball (defending impact). However, all the hard work Atletico do on the training pitch, especially on their defensive organisation, would likely help him to improve in these areas.\n\nSo Mukiele looks to have plenty of positive attributes which would be useful for Atletico — but would maybe need some time to adapt to the specificities of playing in a Simeone side.\n\nThe excellent tackling and heading numbers in the below chart should definitely make him of interest, though.\n\nAlso potentially very attractive to Atletico is the fact Mukiele, who earned his only senior cap to date as a second-half substitute in a World Cup qualifier against Finland last September, is currently in line to be out of contract at the end of next season. So although valued by Transfermarkt.com at €25 million, he could be available for a lower fee.\n\nLess promising for Atletico is that Arsenal and Tottenham are potential rivals for his signature.\n\nDaniel Munoz\n\nLooking through the potential options, given Atletico’s requirement and potential fee they might be prepared to pay, a perhaps left-field possibility came up.\n\nMunoz has experience playing both as a right-sided centre-back and on the right of a back four with Belgian club Genk, and has a number of the characteristics which Atletico should be looking for.\n\nAfter moving from the Colombian top flight in the summer of 2020 for €4.5 million, Munoz immediately became an ever-present for Genk, playing in all 40 of their Jupiler League games last season and starting all but three. The 25-year-old’s versatility was clear as he shared most of his minutes between right centre-back and right-back, while also filling in as a midfielder when required.\n\nThe current season has seen Munoz make the right-back role his own. Two goals and three assists in 18 domestic league games so far sounds pretty good for a defender, while he has also started half of Genk’s six Europa League group matches.\n\nA look at his numbers from 2020-21, as he settled in and was moved around the Genk team, shows Munoz as very strong defensively, especially in intensity, recovering the ball and disrupting opposition moves.\n\nAll this looks very useful for Atletico — and his relatively impressive link-up play and ball retention stats also suggest he should be a decent fit for their current style of play.\n\nEven more interesting, perhaps, is how his attacking numbers have improved this season, when he has been regularly playing right-back in a team struggling for consistency, losing eight of their 21 league games. His xG from shot creation (87 out of 99) and xG from ball progression (90/99) numbers stand out, while he also gets forward into the opposition box very often.\n\nThat attacking intention is also seen in Munoz’s maximum 99/99 ranking for dribbling, while his 83 for tackling also suggests a front-foot mentality.\n\nMore worrying for those championing his signing would be his well-below-average ranking for headers — especially as that is something Atletico, as a team generally, need to improve.\n\nHaving made his full international debut in June, Munoz now has 10 caps, and was first choice as Colombia made the semi-finals at last summer’s Copa America before losing to eventual champions Argentina on penalties.\n\nHis career is definitely on an upward trajectory, and he is unlikely to stay at Genk until the end of a contract that runs to June 2024.\n\nAtletico have previously shown an interest in Colombian right-backs at clubs in the Low Countries, signing Santiago Arias from Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in 2018, although that never really worked out — Arias is currently on a season-long loan at La Liga side Granada, and bringing him back to fill the gap created by Trippier’s departure does not seem to have been considered.\n\nArias struggled to provide the defensive elements Simeone requires, but countryman Munoz’s numbers suggest he might adapt better.\n\nDaniel Wass\n\nSomeone who should need less time to settle in at the Wanda Metropolitano would be Valencia’s Wass — who has played against Atletico 13 times during his time in Spain, including three years at Celta Vigo before joining his current club for €6 million in summer 2018.\n\nThe 41-cap Denmark international definitely has the tactical flexibility Simeone values. Mainly a midfielder earlier in his career, he played mostly at right-back last season, before moving back to the centre of the park in the current one.\n\nHowever, Wass’ smarterscout pizza chart for last season, when he was mostly used at right-back, does not show too many of the defensive attributes that might be required at Atletico. He was below average in most metrics, albeit through what was an under-par year all-round for Valencia, so maybe his defensive intensity would be higher with the hyperactive Simeone urging him on from the sidelines.\n\nWass’ versatility means he could also be used in defensive midfield by Atletico, and he would bring something different than this season’s most popular first-choice trio of Thomas Lemar, Koke and Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nHis attacking numbers are worthy of consideration, especially from midfield, during the current campaign. He moves the ball forward very quickly, while his XG from shot creation (60 out of 99) and xG from ball progression (42/99) are also useful, especially considering Pepe Bordalas’ Valencia in general have not been creating very many chances.\n\nThough just under six feet tall, Wass competes well in the air, which would be useful given Atletico’s surprising issues defending see pieces this season. His set-play headers ranking of 65 is decent, and his 91 for dribbling suggests he could also offer width if played at wing-back. Just five for tackling might be an issue for Simeone, however.\n\nAll in all, Wass does not really add up as the type of versatile defensive presence Atletico should be looking for to replace Trippier.\n\nHe also turns 33 in May, so is hardly a long-term option.\n\nBut Atletico’s transfer decision-makers have a history of moving in ways not always easy for outsiders to understand, and a big positive for Wass is his availability. His Valencia contract expires in June, he almost left the club last summer, and is understood to be very keen on joining Atletico this month.\n\nHis transfer fee is also unlikely to be high, possibly €2 million, while signing him would also have the benefit of Atletico weakening a potential rival in the race for European qualification next season.\n\nStranger things have happened…\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"
