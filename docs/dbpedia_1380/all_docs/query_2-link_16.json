        "text": "A Danish footballer Daniel Wass plays at the position of midfielder for Ãvian Thonon Gaillard FC. Besides he is the member of the Denmark national footballÂ team.\n\nThe playerâs career started at BrÃ¸ndby IF where he played as a defender. He made his club debut in the winter of 2007 in the match against FC Copenhagen. After that Daniel was promoted to the first team squad. In the 2009/10 season he was loaned to Norwegian club Fredrikstad FK; however because of the injury Wass had to miss the season and return to Denmark. In 2010/11 the midfielder participated in Danish Superliga thus making 32 appearances, scoring 6 goals and assisting in 4Â goals.\n\nAt the end of the season the player decided to extend a contract with his team. However against all expectations he joined Lisbon club SL Benfica on a free transfer. In that club Daniel was immediately given more playing time. He was loaned to French club Ãvian where the midfielder appeared more frequently at the position of rightÂ winger.\n\nIn the spring of 2011 Wass made his debut as Danish international in the match against the England national football team. In summer he participated in the European U-21 FootballÂ Championship."
