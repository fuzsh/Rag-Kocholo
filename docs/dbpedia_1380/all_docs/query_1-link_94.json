        "text": "Recommended bets\n\n[RECOMMENDED_BETS]\n\nReal Madrid are unbeaten in 12 La Liga Derbi Madrileños. In fact, Atlético Madrid have only won two of the last 16 Madrid derbies in all competitions, both coming in Europe, including the 2018 UEFA Super Cup in Tallinn. Three of the four derbies at the Wanda Metropolitano have ended all square, the other a 3-1 Real victory in 2019.\n\nBoth teams to score is 4/5.\n\nBoth teams to score and over 2.5 goals is 13/10.\n\nReal Madrid to win and over 2.5 goals is 5/1.\n\nAntoine Griezmann has scored eight goals against Real Madrid, only scoring more against four clubs. He is 6/1 to break the deadlock and 2/1 to add to this tally.\n\nKarim Benzema meanwhile has netted seven times against Atlético, four of which have come in La Liga away games. He is 5/1 to open the scoring and 13/8 to net in 90 minutes.\n\nMatch preview\n\nReal Madrid v Paris Saint Germain – UEFA Champions League MADRID, SPAIN – MARCH 9: Karim Benzema of Real Madrid celebrates 1-1 during the UEFA Champions League match between Real Madrid v Paris Saint Germain at the Bernabéu on March 9, 2022 in Madrid Spain (Photo by David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)\n\nBut, it could also still be Hala Madrid, champions of Europe too.\n\nOn Wednesday night, los Blancos pulled off one of the greatest Champions League comebacks ever, even by their own lofty standards.\n\nWith 90 minutes played for the second leg, Real Madrid were 5-3 down to Manchester City who boasted a >99% chance of qualifying.\n\nHowever, with Real’s first shot on target of the night, Rodrygo halved the aggregate deficit, tapping home Karim Benzema’s cross.\n\nThen, a mere 88 seconds later, Dani Carvajal’s cross was flicked on by Marco Asensio and headed home by Rodrygo, thereby, astonishingly, forcing extra time.\n\nThree minutes into the additional period, Real were awarded a penalty which, as calm as you like, Benzema slotted home.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti’s team managed to see out the victory thereafter, meaning it’ll be they who take on Liverpool in the Champions League Final in Paris.\n\nIt’s been quite the week for Real Madrid who were crowned La Liga champions last weekend, hammering Espanyol 4-0 at the Bernabéu.\n\nSo, can they cap off an eventful nine days with a victory in el Derbi Madrileño?\n\nAtlético Madrid meanwhile were La Liga champions themselves last season, at Real’s expense, but have put in a very underwhelming defence of their crown.\n\nSo much so that Diego Simeone’s side are far from guaranteed a Champions League place after losing 2-0 at San Mamés against Athletic Club last weekend.\n\nThis means los Colchoneros have failed to score in three of their last four matches, only beating Espanyol since 2 April.\n\nWith their final two matches of the campaign against Sevilla and Real Sociedad, Atleti, who are currently fourth, could easily still slip below that position.\n\nThis is always a fixture not to be missed, so who will claim capital city bragging rights at the Wanda Metropolitano?\n\nAtlético Madrid team news\n\nAtletico Madrid v Manchester United: Round Of Sixteen Leg One – UEFA Champions League MADRID, SPAIN – FEBRUARY 23: João Félix celebrates after scoring during the UEFA Champions League Round Of Sixteen Leg One match between Atletico Madrid and Manchester United at Wanda Metropolitano on February 23, 2022 in Madrid, Spain. (Photo by Berengui/DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\nThomas Lemar and João Félix are both injured while, after an anonymous display in Bilbao, Luis Suárez is very unlikely to start again.\n\nSo, Ángel Correa is likely to return to the XI as Antoine Griezmann’s striker partner.\n\nWith Šime Vrsaljko and Daniel Wass available, either could return with Marcos Llorente thereby returning to midfield.\n\nReal Madrid team news\n\nReal Madrid v Elche – La Liga Santander MADRID, SPAIN – JANUARY 23: Luka Modrić of Real Madrid celebrates goal 1-2 during the La Liga Santander match between Real Madrid v Elche at the Santiago Bernaubeu on January 23, 2022 in Madrid Spain (Photo by David S. Bustamante/Soccrates/Getty Images)\n\nWith the La Liga title in the bag, and a Champions League Final to come, it’ll be interesting to see how strong Carlo Ancelotti goes here.\n\nKarim Benzema and Vinícius Júnior have scored 61 goals between them this season which is 46% of Real’s total this season (excluding Copa del Rey).\n\nThey and Wednesday night’s hero Rodrygo could form the front three, if Ancelotti goes strong.\n\nNeither Gareth Bale nor Eden Hazard are very likely to feature.\n\nIn midfield, of course, Casemiro, Luka Modrić and Toni Kroos is the first-choice trio, but Federico Valverde or Eduardo Camavinga could get the nod.\n\nWith David Alaba a doubt, Nacho will continue as Éder Militão’s centre-back partner.\n\nGoalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made 154 appearance for Atlético and had his name engraved outside the Wanda Metropolitano when it opened.\n\nHowever, having subsequently joined Real Madrid, this has been vandalised and he should expect a hostile reception.\n\nLa Liga table:"
