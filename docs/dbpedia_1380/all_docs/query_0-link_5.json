MESSI INSPIRES ARGENTINA Both teams entered this contest needing inspiration, and Messi came closest to providing it in the opening 45 minutes, hitting a free-kick that Guillermo Ochoa punched awkwardly. Mexico’s most exciting moment of the match came from their own free-kick, although Emi Martinez impressively held onto Alexis Vega’s effort. La Albiceleste’s squad has the quality to provide moments of magic but it once again came down to Messi to lift the nation just after the hour mark. Showing off the depth of talent at Lionel Scaloni’s disposal, Enzo Fernandez came off the bench to add some comfort with another eye-catching finish from a Messi assist. MATTER OF FACT Lionel Messi became the first player to record an assist at five different men’s World Cups.

ARGENTINA AND POLAND THROUGH Needing a win to ensure their progression to the knockout stages, Argentina went on the offensive and Marcos Acuna came agonisingly close before Angel Di Maria almost scored directly from a corner. Their biggest chance came when Leo Messi was caught by Wojciech Szczesny, but the goalkeeper recovered by getting a strong right hand to Messi’s penalty. Poland still offered very little after the interval and Argentina scored within a minute of the restart, then again after the hour mark. Jakub Kiwior then escaped punishment for a terrible pass that played substitute Lautaro Martinez in – his miss ensuring both teams went through. MATTER OF FACT Poland reached the World Cup knockout stages for the first time since1986. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 7PM SAUDI ARABIA (0) 1 (S.

Alvarez GOALS 0-1 Cesar Montes’ flick from a corner finds Henry Martin, who taps in ahead of his marker. 0-2 Luis Chavez finds the top corner with a left-footed free-kick of outrageous quality. 1-2 Salem Al Dawsari plays a one-two with Hattan Bahebri and calmly finishes. MEXICO MAGIC TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE Mexico played at a blistering pace in pursuit of the convincing win they needed, but the Saudis’ combative response left El Tri frustrated in the first half. The picture changed in the second half, as two goals meant Mexico needed just one more to usurp Poland. However, Hirving Lozano and Uriel Antuna were denied by the offside flag, Henry Martin struck over from a promising position, and Mohammed Al Owais made sure he wasn’t beaten by another Luis Chavez free-kick. Eventually, Salem Al Dawsari brought Mexico’s hopes to a crushing end. MATTER OF FACT Mexico last failed to reach the knockouts in 1978.

The North Africans were in control during the first half and almost scored just before the break when Kasper Schmeichel made a fine save from Issam Jebali. Denmark improved withaswitch of formation to 4-3-3 that allowed more attacking thrust, yet created very few openings. Eriksen’s 20-yard shot was brilliantly tipped away by Aymen Dahmen, and from the subsequent corner substitute Andreas Cornelius somehow headed against a post from just a yard out. There was a VAR check for handball against Tunisian defender Yassine Meriah in added time, but Danish appeals for a penalty were correctly rejected. MATTER OF FACT Fifteen of the 24 shots in this match came in the aftermath of a corner kick, the most recorded in a World Cup game since1966. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 7PM FRANCE (2) 4 (Rabiot 27, Giroud 32, 71, Mbappe 68) AUSTRALIA (1) 1 (Goodwin 9) Al Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah Att: 40,875 Ref: Gomes (RSA) FRANCE Lloris; Pavard (Kounde 89), Konate, Upamecano, L.

AUSTRALIA Ryan; Atkinson (Degenek 85), Souttar, Rowles, Behich; Mooy; Leckie, Irvine (Baccus 85), McGree (Mabil 73), Goodwin (Kuol 73); Duke (Cummings 56). ∆ Duke, Irvine, Mooy GOALS 0-1 A brilliant switch of play allows Mathew Leckie to cross from the right and Craig Goodwin converts beyond Hugo Lloris at the far post. 1-1 Adrien Rabiot heads home smartly from a left-wing cross by substitute Theo Hernandez. 2-1 A clever flick from Mbappe puts Rabiot free and his pass is swept home by Giroud. 3-1 Ousmane Dembele curls in a cross from the right and Mbappe heads in off the post. 4-1 Mbappe skips past his marker and crosses from the left for Giroud to head home powerfully. MBAPPE SPARKLES FOR LES BLEUS Kylian Mbappe gave instant evidence of his excellence with a dazzling display to inspire France after the shock of conceding an early goal. He overwhelmed Australia, and there was also a joy in his play that can sometimes seem absent. Olivier Giroud showed he can be a more than capable alternative to Karim Benzema, who missed the tournament with a late injury. MATTER OF FACT Giroud’s double saw him equal Thierry Henry on 51 goals as France’s all-time record scorer. SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 10AM TUNISIA (0) 0 AUSTRALIA (1) 1 (Duke 23) Al Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah Att: 41,823 Ref: Siebert (Ger) TUNISIA Dahmen; Bronn (Kechrida 73), Meriah, Talbi; Drager (Sassi 46), Skhiri, Laidouni (Khazri 67), Abdi; Sliti, Msakni; Jebali (Khenissi 73). ∆ Laidouni, Abdi, Sassi AUSTRALIA Ryan; Karacic (Degenek 75), Souttar, Rowles, Behich; Leckie (Baccus 85), Irvine, Mooy, Goodwin (Mabil 85); McGree (Hrustic 64), Duke (Maclaren 64). GOALS 0-1 Mitchell Duke showed rare intelligence to score with a fabulous flicked header to guide home a deflected cross from Craig Goodwin. SOCCEROOS SCRAP VITAL VICTORY Australia knew that defeat would knock them out of the tournament, but repelled constant second-half pressure from Tunisia to scramble a joyfully celebrated win. Mitchell Duke’s clever first-half header gave Australia an advantage that was protected by a stubborn defence led by Harry Souttar. In front of a raucous contingent of support, the Tunisians could not match the verve they had displayed in their opening group match against Denmark and struggled to get their game going in the first half. But they came desperately close to an equaliser in the second period when Socceroos keeper Mathew Ryan denied Youssef Msakni and Wahbi Khazri, while Australia went close themselves when Mat Leckie agonisingly failed to reach Jamie Maclaren’s low cross. MATTER OF FACT This was the first time the Socceroos had ever led a World Cup match at half-time.

KYLIAN SHOWS KILLER INSTINCT France qualified for the knockout stages with a match to spare after victory in a tough, tight game. The speed, intelligence and goalscoring prowess of Kylian Mbappe was the difference. His pace tormented the Danish defence, and his second late goal was decisive. Denmark were much improved on their opening game and, after Andreas Christensen’s equaliser, they missed a big chance at 1-1 with sub Martin Braithwaite shaving the post with his shot. MATTER OF FACT Kylian Mbappe’s double meant he took his World Cup goals tally to seven by the age of 24,afigure that equals Pele’s record. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 3PM AUSTRALIA (0) 1 (Leckie 60) DENMARK (0) 0 Al Janoub Stadium, Al Wakrah Att: 41,232 Ref: Ghorbal (Alg) AUSTRALIA Ryan; Degenek, Souttar, Rowles, Behich; Leckie (Hrustic 89), Mooy, Irvine, Goodwin (Baccus 46); McGree (Wright 74), Duke (Maclaren 82). ∆ Behich, Degenek DENMARK Schmeichel; Kristensen (Bah 46), Andersen, Christensen, Maehle (Cornelius 70); Jensen (Damsgaard 59), Hojbjerg, Eriksen; Skov Olsen (Skov 69), Lindstrom; Braithwaite (Dolberg 59). ∆ Skov GOALS 1-0 A swift counter-attack from a corner by Australia allows Mathew Leckie freedom to run at the Danish defence and score with a precise, low shot past Kasper Schmeichel. ORGANISED AUSSIES PROGRESS Australia’s excellent organisation, unceasing energy and robust defence fashioned a victory that clinched second place in the group. After a bright opening spell from Denmark, there was little doubt the Aussies would finish with smiles on their faces and the win they needed to progress. The goal was cleverly worked, and then Graham Arnold’s side held firm with ease. Denmark had entered the tournament with high optimism, but here they were timid, nervous and complacent. Even when the referee awarded them a penalty it was overturned because Kasper Dolberg had been offside when fouled. MATTER OF FACT Australia moved into the knockout stages for only the second time in their history after doing so at the 2006 tournament in Germany. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 3PM TUNISIA (0) 1 (Khazri 58) FRANCE (0) 0 Education City Stadium, Al Rayyan Att: 43,627 Ref: Conger (Nzl) TUNISIA Dahmen; Meriah, Ghandri, Talbi; Kechrida, Skhiri, Laidouni, Maaloul; Ben Slimane (Abdi 83), Ben Romdhane (Chaaleli 74); Khazri (Jebali 59). ∆ Kechrida FRANCE Mandanda; Disasi, Varane (Saliba 63), Konate, Camavinga; Fofana (Griezmann 73), Tchouameni, Veretout (Rabiot 63); Coman (Mbappe 63), Kolo Muani, Guendouzi (Dembele 79). GOALS 1-0 Tunisia’s captain Wahbi Khazri makes space for himself on the edge of the box and fires home a low shot for an historic strike. TUNISIA GO OUT ON A HIGH France fielded a second-string side and paid the price as they lost to an inspired Tunisian team who once again showed their spirit and quality. The win could have been by a wider margin, with defender Nader Ghandri having his first-half volley ruled out for offside. Victory was not quite enough for the North Africans to reach the knockout stages, but they left a bold impression. After two excellent wins, this wasaconcern for France, suggesting a lack of reserve strength at the disposal of head coach Didier Deschamps. Even when Kyllian Mbappe and the big guns arrived off the bench they could not change the outcome. A late strike by Antoine Griezmann was ruled out by VAR. MATTER OF FACT This was a first defeat for France at a World Cup tournament since losing1-0 to Germany in the 2014 quarter-finals – ten games ago.

GOALS 1-0 Shuichi Gonda clumsily brings down David Raum, and Gundogan slots home the penalty. 1-1 Neuer pushes Minamino’s effort back into the red zone, and Ritsu Doan nets the rebound. 1-2 Takuma Asano wonderfully controls a high long ball, accelerates away from the defender and sensationally finishes from a tight angle. JAPANESE SUBS STUN GERMANS As pro-active and lively after the restart as they were tentative prior to the break, Japan came from behind to secure their first-ever win against Germany. The Nationalmannschaft were left stunned. For long spells, they were in control and had several chances to extend their lead. Japan boss Hajime Moriyasu has a reputation foraconservative approach, but he certainly was brave in his second-half personnel calls, with two of his substitutes, Ritsu Doan and Takuma Asano, netting in the final15 minutes to sensationally turn the match on its head. MATTER OF FACT Germany substitute Youssoufa Moukoko became his country’s youngest-ever World Cup player aged18 years and three days. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 4PM SPAIN (3) 7 (Olmo 11, Asensio 21, F.

LA ROJA RUN RIOT A brilliant Spanish XI had the ball on a string in this most one-sided of World Cup duels. From first to last, La Roja passed the hapless Ticos to death. Even if Costa Rica were abject – devoid of defensive discipline, ideas and conviction – this wasastunning statement of intent from Spain, whose movement, fluidity, speed of execution and cutting edge were of the highest order. Amidst the feast of attractive football served up, one highlight stood out - Gavi, just 18 years and110 days old, is now the youngest player to score at a World Cup since Pele in1958.

Yeltsin Tejeda finds Keysher Fuller, who lets fly with a left-footed curler aimed for the top corner. Shuichi Gonda seems to jump early and, though he gets a weak hand to it, he cannot prevent the shot reaching its destination. SMASH-AND-GRAB WIN FOR LOS TICOS Costa Rica spent virtually the whole game on the back foot before flooring the territorially dominant Japanese with a late sucker punch. Keen to make amends for their 7-0 thumping by Spain, they gaveamuch-improved defensive display against Japan. Talk about efficiency... Fuller’s goal was Costa Rica’s only shot on target in the entire match. Japan, fresh from their shock giantkilling of Germany, badly let themselves down, disjointed, short of final-third invention and woeful at attacking set-pieces. MATTER OF FACT This was Costa Rica’s first win at a World Cup in normal time since beating Italy in the group phase in 2014 –arun of eight games.

NUMBER NINES MAKE THEIR IMPACT Niclas Fullkrug, pigeon-holed as a journeyman striker, proved to be Germany’s saviour, coming off the bench to thump in the equaliser. Spain, who took the lead through another substitute, Alvaro Morata, were left to bemoan a lack of killer instinct, especially when Marco Asensio skied a great opportunity to make it 2-0. Full marks to the Germans for the character they showed, and the tone set by the mercurial teenage midfielder Jamal Musiala, whose quick feet, strength on the ball and elusive runs were a constant source of menace to the Spaniards. MATTER OF FACT Fullkrug, 29, who made his debut in a World Cup warm-up match, is the oldest outfield player to make his Germany bow for 20 years.

Had the ball crossed the by-line before Mitoma centred? Afteralengthy check, VAR deemed no. JAPAN REPEAT HISTORIC GIANTKILLING Eight days after coming from behind to beat Germany, Japan pulled off another remarkable rally to roar back and claim the scalp of muchfancied Spain. It looks as though Samurai Blue have settled on a highly-effective underdog gameplan: play timidly in the first half, lull the opposition into a false sense of security, freshen themselves up with clever substitutions, and then strike like a cobra to turn it all around. MATTER OF FACT Japan are only the third team in World Cup history (after Brazil in1938 and West Germany in1970) to be losing at half-time and mount a winning comeback twice at the same finals.

GOALS 0-1 Raum crosses to the near post, where Gnabry guides a header into the far corner. 1-1 Neuer parries a Kendall Waston header and Yeltsin Tejeda picks up the pieces from close in. 2-1 In a melee following a free-kick, Juan Pablo Vargas pokes it home via a ricochet off Neuer. 2-2 Costa Rica fail to clear their lines, and Fullkrug flicks the ball to Havertz who converts. 2-3 From the right flank, Gnabry flashes a cross to the far post where Havertz taps in. 2-4 Sane chests it down for Fullkrug to fire in. GERMANY CRASH OUT IN GROUPS AGAIN On a night of high drama and constant shifts of narrative, Germany went through the gamut of emotions: total superiority when bossing the first half, complacently allowing Costa Rica to turn the tables, then fighting back to grab the three points late on. All to no avail. Japan’s defeat of Spain inflicted consecutive World Cup groupstage eliminations on the Nationalmannschaft.

ENGAGING BUT GOALLESS AFFAIR In their first-ever competitive meeting, 2018 World Cup runners-up Croatia and the Atlas Lions of Morocco proved that goalless draws need not be dull, even if the outcome was never in doubt. Both sides lacked a cutting edge in the final third and excelled in obdurate and physical defending. Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou kept out Nikola Vlasic’s closerange attempt from Borna Sosa’s cross in the first half, while his Croatian counterpart Dominik Livakovic blocked Noussair Mazraoui’s header after the break. The intensity and pace of the match dropped in the second half but there were stillafew goalmouth scrambles, while the well-drilled Moroccans went close when right-back Achraf Hakimi stung the hands of Livakovic with the Croatia keeper punching away his speculative long-range free-kick. MATTER OF FACT Four Croatia players who played in the 2018 World Cup final defeat to France started this match – Marcelo Brozovic, Dejan Lovren, Ivan Perisic and captain Luka Modric.

DYNAMIC BUT PROFLIGATE CANADIANS Belgium had six players aged over 30 in their starting XI and the contrast with Canada was enormous, whose youngsters – as well as Richie Laryea’s high-tempo, helter-skelter running, quick transitions and pressing – had Belgium pinned back in their own half. But the Canadians failed to maintain that intensity after the break. Just three of Canada’s 22 attempts were on target. Their attack was too profligate to scare the world’s best goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who made a crucial save from Alphonso Davies’ weak first-half penalty. MATTER OF FACT Canada took their tally of World Cup games without scoring a goal to four, leaving China, Trinidad&Tobago and DR Congo (then known as Zaire in 1974) in their wake.

BELGIANS ON THE BRINK After riding their luck against Canada, Belgium produced an even more dire display, aided by an error from Thibaut Courtois. The usually reliable keeper was warned when he conceded straight from Ziyech’s wide free-kick – only to be saved by an offside VAR call–and Morocco repeated the trick in the second half. Walid Regragui made some inspired subs, with Sabiri and Aboukhlal integral in causing another World Cup upset. MATTER OF FACT This was Morocco’s first World Cup victory for 24 years. In1998, they defeated Scotland 3-0 but did not progress from the group stage.

CROATS OUTCLASS CANADA John Herdman’s team began on the front foot, but showed naivety as Croatia’s experience and cunning prevailed. A hard reality check for the Canadians, co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup. MATTER OF FACT Alphonso Davies’ header was Canada’s firstever World Cup goal. At the 1986 World Cup, Canada failed to score in a group containing France, Hungary and the Soviet Union.

MOROCCO REPEAT HEROICS OF1986 For only the second time, Morocco progressed to the knockout stages. They were improbable but deserved winners of Group F, and this win was the icing on the cake. In a close match, the North Africans were happy to sit back and soak up pressure after going ahead – and it almost cost them when Atiba Hutchinson’s second-half header hit the crossbar and came agonisingly close to crossing the goal-line on its way down. MATTER OF FACT In a repeat of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Morocco topped their group, while Canada lost all three of their group-stage games.

Their premature exit prompted Roberto Martinez to step down immediately in the aftermath of the defeat, six years after taking charge. Romelu Lukaku, clearly lacking match sharpness, was blamed for a series of misses in the second half, but at least he had shown determination and commitment, qualities lacking across the team amid rumours of fractures and bust-ups in the dressing room. In a largely forgettable game, Croatia had a penalty overturned by VAR due to an offside by the narrowest of margins in the first half, before a rearguard action from Zlatko Dalic’s side denied Belgium and Lukaku at the end. Centre-back Josko Gvardiol was in imperious form, making a match-saving interception to help seal his nation’s progress. MATTER OF FACT This is Belgium’s worst World Cup finish since1998, where they also departed in the group stage after lacklustre draws with Netherlands, South Korea and Mexico.

EMBOLO BREAKS CAMEROONIAN HEARTS Both sides had periods of control in the first half, but Cameroon had the more promising openings with each of their front three getting a sight of goal. Despite this, defences remained on top going into the break with Manuel Akanji heading Switzerland’s best chance wide before half-time. The Swiss re-emerged for the second half transformed and took just three minutes to go ahead. They weren’t able to extend their lead though, as Andre Onana and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa made vital interventions to keep their side in the game. Jean-Charles Castelletto added another superb block to deny Haris Seferovic late on, but Cameroon couldn’t carve out a leveller. MATTER OF FACT Breel Embolo didn’t celebrate his goal having been born in the Cameroonian capital, Yaounde.

RICHARLISON BRACE BEATS SERBIA Supporters in Lusail had to wait over an hour for their samba party, as Serbia disrupted the game’s rhythm by standing toe-to-toe with the Brazilians. There were flashes of brilliance from A Selecao, although Vanja Milinkovic-Savic beat Vinicius Junior to Thiago Silva’s defence-splitting pass, while a scintillating move ended in a tame Raphinha shot. Even when Nikola Milenkovic messed up his clearance, the big centre-back recovered to deny Vinicius Junior. In the second period, after Alex Sandro’s long-range effort smashed the post, Richarlison struck twice to put Brazil in a strong position, allowing Tite’s substitutes to come on and express themselves. MATTER OF FACT Brazil haven’t lost their opening game at the World Cup since doing so against Yugoslavia and Spain in1930 and 1934 respectively.

SIX-GOAL THRILLER ENDS ALL SQUARE Andre Onana’s omission from Cameroon’s squad was the big pre-match story and Aleksandar Mitrovic will be frustrated not to have beaten his replacement, Devis Epassy, more than once. After Serbia came from behind to lead, Vincent Aboubakar emerged from the bench to inspire Cameroon to a vital draw in a remarkable match. MATTER OF FACT Cameroon ended a run of eight consecutive defeats at World Cup finals with this result.

CASEMIRO SINKS SWITZERLAND The void left by Brazil’s injured talisman Neymar was evident during a slow first half in which even the stadium lights dimmed early. Tite’s men struggled to break down an organised Swiss side and while Raphinha tried to step up, the winger’s cross was met with a tame Vinicius Junior shot before Yann Sommer comfortably saved his ambitious effort. After the interval, Vinicius Junior thought he’d opened the scoring when he skipped past Nico Elvedi and slid his shot into the bottom corner, but Richarlison had been caught offside in the build-up. Just when it looked like Switzerland would hold out, Casemiro took charge to fire in the winner. MATTER OF FACT Having not scored in his first 34 Brazil games, this was Casemiro’s sixth goal in the following 33.

FIRST AFRICAN WIN VERSUS BRAZIL AT WC Brazil boss Tite made nine changes with Antony and Gabriel Martinelli the two who tried to make things happen. Cameroon showed determination in their defending, although that tipped over to desperation at times. Devis Epassy’s saves were unorthodox on occasions but kept Brazil out, while the Indomitable Lions showed a threat of their own through Bryan Mbeumo and Vincent Aboubakar’s efforts either side of half-time. After Epassy denied Martinelli and Eder Militao, Christopher Wooh got across to ensure Bruno Guimaraes didn’t get a clear shot on goal from Raphinha’s cut-back. All of that defending paid off as Aboubakar headed in a late winner, a moment more than worth the second yellow for his celebration as Cameroon held on. MATTER OF FACT Dani Alves became Brazil’s oldest-ever captain at a World Cup aged 39 years and 210 days. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 7PM SERBIA (2) 2 (A.

SWITZERLAND WIN FIERY CONTEST Both teams showed intent from the start and had each enjoyed the feeling of going ahead by the 35th minute. Switzerland took control with a goal either side of half-time, which left Serbia visibly frustrated and approaching boiling point on multiple occasions. Switzerland were resolute when required, managing to maintain their lead despite Christian Fassnacht wasting a late chance. MATTER OF FACT The Serbians haven’t made it out of the group stage in any of their last four World Cups.

Having helped repel the Asian outfit’s advances, Jose Maria Gimenez took a key role in moving Uruguay forward, playing sweeping passes that found Federico Valverde and Facundo Pellistri in dangerous positions. The teams had one big chance apiece before the break, but Hwang Ui-jo skied his effort before Diego Godin’s header struck the post. While the Taeguk Warriors offered little in attack for large periods after the break, they showed defensive discipline to limit Uruguay. There was a scare when Kim Min-jae’s slip allowed Darwin Nunez in behind, but Kim Seung-gyu held his pull-back. The best chances came late as Cho Gue-sung pulled his effort wide, Valverde’s thunderbolt hit the post, then Son Heung-min fired wide. MATTER OF FACT This was only Facundo Pellistri’s second competitive match against senior opposition this season, following Manchester United U21s’ 2-1 EFL Trophy win against Barrow.

PORTUGAL WIN AFTER LATE DRAMA This match came to life in the 65th minute when Ronaldo scored from the penalty spot. Ghana responded just eight minutes later but Otto Addo’s decision to take off the pair that had linked up for their goal was swiftly followed by two clinical Portuguese finishes. Sub Osman Bukari gave the Black Stars hope and Diogo Costa bizarrely almost cost his team the win when he didn’t spot Inaki Williams behind him, only for the striker to slip while stealing the ball.

KUDUS FIRES GHANA TO GLORY Having held strong to overcome South Korea’s early pressure, Ghana opened the scoring and used that as a springboard to stamp their authority in the first half, adding a second. After seeing one header saved, Cho Gue-sung then scored two in three minutes to level the game. Not to be denied, Ghana struck again and valiantly saw out the win as Salisu cleared Kim Jin-su’s attempt off the line and Lawrence Ati-Zigi made some eye-catching saves.

FERNANDES LEADS PORTUGAL THROUGH In a game between two sides with a pragmatic approach, Rodrigo Bentancur was the only player to break past the opposition back line in the first half. He drove through the middle before dancing past Ruben Dias and William Carvalho, eventually being halted by Diogo Costa’s save. Bruno Fernandes gave Portugal the advantage just nine minutes after the restart – with questions following about whether it was Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal – forcing Diego Alonso into substitutions that brought added attacking impetus for Uruguay. However, Maxi Gomez rattled the post, Luis Suarez hit the side netting and Giorgian de Arrascaeta’s dinked attempt was saved before Fernandes doubled Portugal’s lead with a harshly-awarded spot-kick.

HEROIC HWANG IS KOREA’S SAVIOUR South Korea had to win but got off to the worst possible start, conceding early on. The Taeguk Warriors responded well, continuing to push on even after Kim Jin-su saw his goal ruled out for offside. Their reward eventually came before the half-hour mark, and they never lost hope that a winner would arrive in the second half with their fans and players being brought to tears by Hwang Hee-chan’s stoppage-time winner.

URUGUAY AND GHANA DUMPED OUT After his handball in 2010, Luis Suarez further stoked Ghana’s desire for revenge by saying: “It wasn’t my fault because I didn’t miss the penalty”. However, in the worst case of history repeating itself, Andre Ayew failed to convert from the spot after Sergio Rochet caught Mohammed Kudus. Things got worse as Suarez was involved in both of Giorgian de Arrascaeta’s goals, but the game eventually ended in heartbreak for both teams. Suarez was left in tears, before La Celeste players surrounded the referee following the final whistle feeling they were wrongly denied a penalty.

Having gone through Heerenveen’s youth system but not made the first team, he was given a tough introduction to senior football at NAC Breda, serving four years as a back-up, before joining Italian side Foggia and suffering relegation down to Serie D. An injury-hit spell back home at second-tier Dordrecht culminated in him being without a club for six months, resulting in family doubts over his career and thoughts of working for the police. Eventually though he found his club in Go Ahead Eagles, before going full circle to re-join Heerenveen. At 28 years old, Noppert received his first Netherlands call-up with fewer than 50 career appearances to his name, making his debut in the World Cup opener, keeping two clean sheets and making a vital save to deny Christian Pulisic in the last 16. Azzedine OUNAHI MOROCCO During the 2020-21 campaign, Azzedine Ounahi was playing his football in the French third tier with Avranches after not being offered a professional contract by Strasbourg. His impressive displays saw him jump up to Ligue1 outfit Angers in 2021, with appearances at an Africa Cup of Nations and now the World Cup following. After helping to fire Morocco to the World Cup finals with two Andries NOPPERT NETHERLANDS goals against DR Congo in the play-offs, the midfielder thrived in Qatar, starting every game as the Atlas Lions made history as Africa’s greatest-ever World Cup side. Ounahi has caught the eye with his ability and composure on the ball, with Luis Enrique left in awe after Morocco beat Spain on penalties, asking: “Oh my God, where does this guy come from? [He] plays incredibly well.” 62 WORLD SOCCER 1 2\n\nSIX OF THE BEST Jude BELLINGHAM ENGLAND Goncalo RAMOS PORTUGAL Fernando Santos’ decision to leave out Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal’s most capped player and record goalscorer, against Switzerland was a massive one. Adding to that, Ramos was making his first start for A Selecao, having made two cameo substitute appearances in the group stage. But the decision was vindicated. The 21-year-old striker smashed in the opener, grabbed an instinctive second and completed his hat-trick by luring in Yann Sommer before dinking the ball past him. There was even time among all of that goalscoring to get an assist, sliding the ball through for Raphael Guerreiro. Morocco’s defence expertly kept Ramos and Portugal out, but that Switzerland match offered the nation a glimpse of their possible future in attack. It may seem strange to include a player with the world’s biggest clubs queuing up to sign him in a list of “breakout stars”, yet Bellingham’s displays demonstrated that he is playing with a level of maturity and control far beyond his years. Before this year’s UEFA Nations League campaign, his only competitive England starts came against Andorra and San Marino, yet the 19-year-old was let loose in Qatar. After scoring his first England goal in the opener verus Iran, he continued to put in impressive displays throughout the finals, playing a key role in two goals against Senegal before displaying his leadership potential in defeat to France. Unquestionably a future Three Lions captain. WORLD SOCCER 63 Despite Ghana’s World Cup coming to a heartbreaking end against Uruguay as they finished bottom of Group H, Kudus was one of the African talents that lit up the finals. Throughout Ghana’s three games, the attacking midfielder gave them hope with his bravery on the ball and ability to make things happen, leading the failed comeback versus Portugal by setting up Andre Ayew Mohammed KUDUS 3 GHANA Niclas FULLKRUG GERMANY While Germany endured a bitterly disappointing World Cup, Fullkrug can take positives from his time in Qatar. The striker was playing in the second tier last season but, having fired Werder Bremen to promotion and continued to score in the Bundesliga, the 29-year-old was rewarded with a call-up by Hansi Flick. A goal followed in a 1-0 4 5 6 to level the scores at1-1. Having already scored ten goals for Ajax this season, Kudus showed his clinical edge against South Korea, getting the slightest of glances on Jordan Ayew’s cross, then beating Kim Seung-gyu with a first-time finish inside the penalty box. Even during the defeat against Uruguay, his quick-thinking won the penalty that Andre Ayew failed to convert. pre-tournament win versus Oman, before Fullkrug’s sub appearances ensured Germany’s tournament was less humiliating than it could have been amid various questions about whether Flick had a true No.9 at his disposal. After lashing home the equaliser against Spain, he flicked the ball to set up Kai Havertz before grabbing another goal of his own in the futile victory against Costa Rica.\n\nJonathan Wilson reports Just by the stadium where the World Cup final was played, there runs a broad shopping street, the Lusail Boulevard, which claims to be the Champs Elysees of the Middle East. It’s an odd mix of high-end shops, a Sainsbury’s, and some pretty grimlooking American fast-food chains. It’s outside but air-conditioned, as so much of Qatar is. Over the past month it has been covered in World Cup branding; flags from the competing nations hung from the lampposts; the World Cup anthem dribbled out of speakers; huge adverts featuring the likes of Neymar and Lionel Messi. But what there was not was any football, or any fans. On the day Argentina played Mexico in Lusail, I headed up from Doha early, thinking I’d be able to watch Poland v Saudi Arabia somewhere nearby. But there was no big screen. There were no cafes or bars showing games. Most didn’t even have TVs. I headed to the mall modelled on the Place Vendome, in Paris. Nothing there either. Nor on the Lusail Corniche. There were places where you could pose for Instagram photos alongside the words “Qatar 2022”. But there was no football and so there were no fans. Having missed most of the first half, I eventually found a screen at the Arabian Nights fan park by the Katara Hotel, that huge gleaming monstrosity supposedly shaped like the claws of a crab. For 20 riyals it was possible to access a long, narrow strip with plenty of screens. There were chicken kebabs and fried potatoes. A hooded falcon sat on a plinth near the centre. Arriving late, all the seats were taken, so I found myself wedged between a candyfloss machine and a cage in which three goats tried to ignore the children seeking to provoke them. There was, at least, a sense of atmosphere, a local(ish) crowd noisily supporting Saudi Arabia, but this was clearly a deeply ersatz experience. This wasn’t where people in Doha habitually watched football. And that was the sense throughout. Football appeared to be an afterthought. There were the trappings of the World Cup, but it was as though nobody in authority quite knew what a World Cup was. This is not specifically a Qatari phenomenon. FIFA is a world of fakery. The move to stadium DJs and MCs whipping up the crowd was well underway long before we got to Doha, but it was here that it reached its full expression. Stadiums before kick-off became a sinkhole of inanity because, while FIFA and Qatar welcomed the fans, they were terrified about what they might do or say if their own songs and chants were permitted to be heard. Very little thought seemed to be given to crowds. This is not the fault of the thousands of volunteers who were good-humoured and helpful, or really of the Metro system, which in many ways was a triumph. But it didn’t reach Al Bayt, the stadium in the desert 30 miles north of Doha. So fans either had to travel by taxi or take shuttle buses along vast four-lane highways, negotiating a maze of car parks. Of course it’s never easy when there are 80,000 eyewitness QATAR ‘Nothing could be trusted. Nothing was real’ A report from inside Doha on life away from the pitch during the 2022 World Cup 64 WORLD SOCCER\n\nWORLD SOCCER RLD SOCCER 65 Lusail Boulevard...the “Champs Elysees of the Middle East”\n\neyewitness fans to clear from a stadium, as was the case at Lusail. The queuing system at the Metro there worked relatively well. But there was a problem heading to the stadium, which was that the majority of fans changing onto the red line north had to change at Msheireb, where they ran into supporters making their way to the fan park on the Corniche near Al Bidda. The day of Argentina’s quarter-final win over the Netherlands, several hours before kick-off, the station at Msheireb became so dangerously overcrowded that passengers getting to the bottom of the escalator were unable to get off. Perhaps the argument would be that Qatar has no experience of hosting such vast numbers of people, which is true; but that’s yet another reason why it should never have hosted the World Cup. Propaganda for the local organisers were everywhere. There was a spate of news stories explaining how this had been a great, family-friendly World Cup because there was no alcohol available. Which rather neglected the great, family-friendly World Cups of Russia, Brazil, South Africa, Germany, and Japan and South Korea. Alcohol is not the issue. Those stories rapidly vanished after clashes between Morocco fans and security before the quarter-final against Portugal, seemingly caused by the presence of fans without tickets. But how many fans were ever at games? Attendance figures rarely seemed to make sense. Afterafew days in which the attendance habitually outstripped the capacity of the stadium, FIFA hastily explained capacities had expanded because fewer media and corporate seats were needed than had initially been expected. But then there were claims of sell-outs when thousands of seats were clearly empty. Nothing could be trusted. Nothing was real. As Qatar lost the opening game against Ecuador with embarrassing ease, thousands of local supporters went home long before the final whistle. But one small section of the stadium remained full, with maroon-clad fans that carried on chanting for Qatar. Here, then, was the local football culture we had been promised. But no, it turned out they had, according to the New York Times, been shipped in from Lebanon to provide colour and atmosphere. The Aspire Academy set up its Football Dreams programme in 2007 and for seven years scouted more than 3.5 million boys aged 12 or 13 from developing nations (most with a handy ExCo member) offering 20 Aspire 66 WORLD SOCCER ABOVE: Empty seats…a bird’seye view of Qatar fans during their defeat to Ecuador Overcrowded… inside Msheireb Metro Station It was as though nobody in authority quite knew what a World Cup was\n\nscholarships a year, the highest-level football coaching in Qatar. But the programme was closed down in 2014 for reasons that have never really been explained. Aspire graduates formed the basis of the Qatar national side at this tournament, but where else would they train? What was all that investment for? The worst-ever performance by a host? As well as a fake Place Vendome there is a fake Venice, a fake Beverly Hills and a Winter Wonderland. Everything is fake. Which is perhaps what happens when you build a country in just a couple of decades. You copy elsewhere and the result is artificiality. You go too fast and your exploitation of the world’s poor becomes obvious. Almost all wealthy nations import workers from economically weaker countries to do the jobs nobody wants to do; what they don’t do is house them in giant labour camps on a pittance that is often paid late, if at all, having taken away their passports. Safety standards are drawn up and applied and, should an accident happen andaworker die, there is a full investigation. That, manifestly, has not been happening in Qatar. All the misinformation about safety on the building sites – the ludicrous claims of only three deaths on specific World Cup projects was suddenly upgraded to “between 400 and 500” by the tournament’s chief organiser, Hassan Al Thawadi, during an interview in November – was laid bare when a Filipino worker fell to his death from a ramp while walking alongside a forklift mending lights at the resort where the Saudi Arabia team had been based. “We’re having a successful World Cup and this is something you want to talk about right now?” said Nasser Al Khater, head of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee. “Death is a natural part of life, whether at work, whether in your sleep. A worker QATAR died, our condolences to his family, but it is strange that is something you want to focus on as your first question.” Nothing could have better expressed the callousness of the authorities, of Qatari society, for the lives of the migrant workers. Plenty of visitors spoke of the warmth of the welcome they had received, how pleasant everything seemed. Which is true. For the wealthy – and the majority of European visitors are comparatively wealthy – life in Qatar is good. There are plenty as well who come from Kenya or Nepal, Ghana or Bangladesh and find their standard of living significantly improved. But there are many thousands who do not. There is talk from the government of labour reforms, but no sense of accountability; everything is about image. The real story is the arrests made as the tournament entered its final week as part of an investigation into allegations of illegal lobbying in Europe. So what is it all for? Why bother with this vast Potemkin state? Why did Qatar want the World Cup? The answer perhaps lies in Lusail, in the – as yet – empty luxury villas and the smart apartment blocks. Qatar wants the mega rich to live here–and perhaps soulless clean malls full of luxury brands, populated by other rich people, is a draw. But it also wants middle-managers and professionals, computer technicians and data analysts, and it will draw them from countries unable to provide such a high standard of living. That is the nature of global capitalism, but it is also protection. If Qatar houses émigrés from all over the world, if it has a resonance far beyond its own shores, it is that much harder for either Saudi Arabia or Iran, the two great regional powers, to swallow it up. The World Cup has been justapart of that strategy. 7 Controversial…Nasser Al Khater Offending photo…this photo earned Samindra a security detention At the political blockbuster match, Iran v United States,Iwas detained for15 minutes after taking a photo of a girl crying because security confiscated her Persian flag,asymbol for anti-regime protesters. The atmosphere at the Al Thumama Stadium had been thick with tension and apprehension among the Iranian fans, split into anti and pro-regime camps. This game transcended the sport, at least from the Iranian perspective. It was not the geopolitical shock of the late ’90s when the pair met at the World Cup in France, but, again,aflashpoint for the nationwide protests back home prompted by the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police. Underlying close ties between the host nation and Iran, security was ramped up at Team Melli’s final group encounter to prevent any anti-regime protests. At Iran’s first match against England, supporters were asked to wear their Amini T-shirts inside out when entering the stadium; at the second match, against Wales, such T-shirts were confiscated; and for the United States match most supporters left them at home. The crackdown from security was complete. Even Palestinian flags and symbols, ubiquitous at the first World Cup in the region, were confiscated. Iranian fan Saba told Dhiman Sarkar, a colleague from the Hindustan Times, and myself that she was asked to show her bra at security to ensure she was not hiding “dissenting” messages. We went to security to see for ourselves and whenItook the photo, “the tournament police” demanded I delete it. I refused and was detained. “Big problem,”Iwas told, while outside Dhiman tried to reach FIFA’s venue media officer. After 15 minutes,asenior police officer repeated the demand to delete the photo. I obliged, was released, and later retained the photo in my deleted folder. That same evening, Danish TV reporter Rasmus Tantholdt said he had also been detained briefly, underlying that there is little to no press freedom in Qatar, ranked119th on the 2022 World Press Freedom Index.

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that, as Enzo Fernandez tiptoed into the penalty area during Argentina’s Group C clash with Mexico before curling a wicked effort into the top corner, his price tag crept up by a few digits. The 21-year-old midfielder was already on the radar of many of Europe’s biggest clubs after starring in Benfica’s dominant start to the 2022-23 season. Only two outfield players had played more minutes for the Lisbon giants than Fernandez when the league paused for the World Cup, with the unbeaten Benfica eight points clear of their nearest rivals. Despite catching the eye with his sensational strike against Mexico – and opening his Benfica account with a sweetly-struck volley from the edge of the area–goalscoring is more of a bonus feature to Fernandez’s game than an integral element. A clever, deep-lying midfielder, he is a tempo-setter, a regista with a superb passing range, averaging more than 90 passes per Portuguese league game prior to Qatar. No stranger to the uglier side of his role, he also wins his fair share of tackles – and concedes his fair share of fouls. Fernandez already has a long and growing list of admirers, yet the biggest obstacle to clubs hoping to sign him could beasimple matter of timing. Benfica only signed him from River Plate (forafee of €10 million) in June, and will be reluctant to let him go for anything less than a huge profit given how integral he has been to their season – and not just domestically. He only missed one game as the Eagles advanced to the last 16 of the Champions League as group winners and, with Club Brugge awaiting them in the next round, the opportunity to match last season’s journey to the quarter-finals is a real prospect. Benfica are, of course, not immune to the advances of bigger clubs – as they demonstrated last summer by cashing in on Darwin Nunez after just two years – but even they will surely be keen to hold on to their top prospect until the summer. Then again, this is also a club that knows when to cash their chips in, and Fernandez’s value may well be as high now as it will ever be.

Only three years ago, he was unable to get into the River Plate first team and was loaned out to Defensa y Justicia, where he played a starring role as Hernan Crespo’s unfancied side lifted the 2020 Copa Sudamericana, South America’s second-tier club competition. On his return to River, he starred in the Julian Alvarez-inspired side that won the 2021 Argentine league title. YOURI TIELEMANS (Leicester City) The Foxes are reportedly already lining up Lorient’s Enzo Le Fee as a potential replacement for Tielemans, who is out of contract in 2023 and not expected to agree a new deal. Potential suitors of the Belgium midfielder, including Arsenal, could avoid a summer free-for-all by bidding in January. (Rennes) Dubbed “the next Luka Modric”, not least for sharing the same initials, the Croatia international and former Dinamo Zagreb midfielder has turned heads with his performances for Rennes this season. His contract runs until 2026 so the French club are unwilling to budge from their €60m valuation. LOVRO MAJER (Roma) Interest at home (Juventus, Inter and Milan) and abroad (PSG and Tottenham) has forced Roma into entering contract negotiations with their young left-winger, who turns 21 in January and still has two years left on his contract. The capital club will be hoping he commits his future to them. NICOLA ZALEWSKI (Athletic Bilbao) According to reports, Barcelona have a verbal agreement for the experienced centre-back to join as a free agent next summer, but they may be willing to pay Athletic a nominal fee to secure the deal in January. Bayern Munich’s Benjamin Pavard is also a target at right-back. INIGO MARTINEZ RAFAEL LEAO (Milan) The Portugal winger caught the eye in last season’s title win and in this season’s Champions League, and Milan are keen to tie him down to a new contract. Yet doing so has not proven easy. If an agreement can’t be reached, Milan may need to cash in on him, with Leao’s current deal expiring in 2024.

(Borussia Dortmund) Barely18 years old and already a first-team regular at Dortmund and a member of Germany’s World Cup squad, striker Moukoko’s delay on signing a new deal at Borussia has caught the attention of every major club in Europe. Liverpool and Manchester United reportedly lead the race for his signature. (Internazionale) Brought in to replace Achraf Hakimi, the Netherlands’ attacking right wing-back has impressed since moving to Serie A in 2021 for €15m. Upon hearing about potential interest from Manchester United and other clubs, the Dutch defender said he was “flattered” but focused on Inter. (Lille) The Canada marksman moved to France from Gent three summers ago and was part of the Lille squad that beat PSG to the Ligue 1 title in 2020-21. He recently said he would be open to a move to either Spain or England, and his profile would have been boosted by playing in Qatar. (Villarreal) The Spain defender’s €55m release clause has put off clubs in the past, but it seems Villarreal may now consider a bid below that figure. Unai Emery is rumoured to want a reunion at Aston Villa, although the centreback’s previous desire to play European football make those links questionable. (Chelsea) Rafael van der Vaart suggested his former club Tottenham could win the Premier League by signing Ziyech. Only three players have joined Spurs from Chelsea in the Premier League era but, with the Blues pursuing Everton ace Anthony Gordon, the Moroccan could become available to Antonio Conte. (PSV) Top of both the goal and assists charts in the Eredivisie before shining in Qatar, Gakpo is already a star for both club and country. Advised against joining Manchester United in the summer by Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal, the 23-year-old attacker will be even more in demand in 2023. (Sporting) After scoring against his old club Tottenham in the Champions League, the winger admitted he would like to return to the Premier League one day. That return could come soon, and Spurs would have a big advantage on other rivals having included a 50 per cent sell-on clause when selling him. MAO HOSOYA CODY GAKPO PAU TORRES DENZEL DUMFRIES\n\n(Shakhtar Donetsk) Few teams have started a Champions League campaign in circumstances as difficult as Shakhtar did this season. With Ukrainian football paralysed by Russia’s invasion, they had only played three league matches in nine months when their campaign began against RB Leipzig. Their preparation came in the form of a series of friendlies as they toured Europe having been forced out of their Donbas home. Their squad had been decimated by departures, leaving them with a team of almost entirely academy-produced players. By the end of their stunning 4-1 victory in Leipzig, there was no doubt as to which member of Shakhtar’s new-look young squad was the rising star. Mudryk was involved in three of his side’s goals, assisting two after electric bursts down the left wing, either side of a crisp leftfooted finish past Peter Gulacsi. He went on to score two more goals as Shakhtar finished third in their group and advanced to the Europa League, where they will play Rennes in the play-offs in February. His domestic form has been equally impressive, with five goals and six assists in his first ten games in the Ukrainian Premier League, which is being played out behind closed doors. The exodus from Shakhtar since the start of the year – particularly of Brazilians David Neres, Fernando, Pedrinho, Alan Patrick and Tete – has been a blessing in disguise for Mudryk. Prior to this season, he had only started eight league matches for the club he joined at the age of16, but he had doubled that tally by the start of November. Alongside striker Danylo Sikan, another 21-year-old Ukrainian, he has been instrumental in leading the attack of a club that is used to relying on Brazilian imports. With the January window looming, Shakhtar find themselves in a unique position. They are in a battle with FIFA over the ruling that allowed players to leave Ukraine after the invasion –aruling that they say cost them €50m. Selling Mudryk would allow them to recoup some of the losses they have made, but they are also determined not to be shortchanged again. The winger is said to have a €60m price tag on his head. And he is not short of admirers. Reports say Premier League leaders Arsenal have made him their priority, while Newcastle United and Juventus have also been linked with a move. A traditional winger who operates down his favourite side rather than playing as an inverted right-winger, his pace and directness make him a serious counter-attacking threat – as he has demonstrated in Europe this season. MYKHAYLO MUDRYK WORLD SOCCER 73 The 21-year-old winger is said to have a €60m price tag on his head MOST WAN TED\n\n(Napoli) Having already nicknamed him “Kvaradona” in tribute to club legend Diego Maradona, it will give Napoli fans no end of anguish to see their new hero already linked with a move on, just a few months after he arrived at the club from Dinamo Batumi. They would also be entitled to ask why he would want to be anywhere but Naples right now, with Gli Azzurri flying high in Serie A and plotting a Champions League last-16 clash with Eintracht Frankfurt after topping a group featuring Liverpool and Ajax. Still, that will not stop clubs circling around the in-form and highly-talented Kvaratskhelia. If he were to leave in January, it would be to his fourth club in a year. In March, he walked out on Rubin Kazan following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, returning to Georgia to play for Batumi. Eight goals in just11 matches convinced Napoli to pay around €12m for him, and his impressive productivity has continued in Italy. Before the World Cup break, he had scored eight goals and assisted another eight in17 Champions League and SerieAmatches, while also averaging more completed dribbles than anyone else in Italy’s top flight. Yet the 21-year-old is not a player that is defined by stats. The top result when typing his name into YouTube is a video titled: “50 Players Humiliated By Khvicha Kvaratskhelia,” and it delivers on its promise. His low centre of gravity, excellent balance and exceptionally quick feet allow him to regularly make defenders look foolish, while his reliable end product gives them a dilemma: stand off and he’ll deliver a cross or a shot, get too tight and he’ll dance past them. Operating from the left of Napoli’s three-man attack, he has struck up a particularly effective partnership with centre-forward Victor Osimhen, setting up three of the Nigerian’s first eight Serie A goals. Between them, the duo have done an outstanding job of replacing Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne, the club’s top two record scorers, who departed in the summer. Given that, it is hard to imagine Napoli being willing to sell at any price. Yet some reports claim that a new deal for the Georgian will include a release clause of €65m. A healthy profit on their initial outlay, certainly, but probably not enough to put off the likes of Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain or Manchester City, who have all been linked with the winger. Or perhaps even Newcastle United, SERGEJ MILINKOVIC-SAVIC KHV ICHA KVARATSKHELIA (Juventus) Reports from Italy suggest Juventus are willing to sell McKennie in 2023, from as early as the January window, amid plenty of Premier League interest. I Bianconeri are looking towards Atletico Madrid midfielder Rodrigo De Paul as the American’s replacement. WESTON McKENNIE His low centre of gravity, balance and quick feet allow him to regularly make defenders look foolish (Lazio) The Serbia midfielder has enjoyed a sublime start to 2022-23, directly involved in11 goals in his first 12 games. Lazio president Claudio Lotito says: “He is now worth €120m, and every month the price goes up,” much to the frustration of Juventus, Arsenal and Manchester United. Football’s MOST WAN TED 74 WORLD SOCCER\n\nALBERTO MOLEIRO whose Saudi owners could boost their Champions League dreams by swooping for one of the outstanding young talents in Europe. Then again, Kvaradona is currently in place to write himself into the Napoli history books – and the affections of the club’s fans forever – if he can help steer them to a first title since1990, when Diego was still in situ. That would be hard to walk away from, no matter who makes him an offer this January. JESPER LINDSTROM (Eintracht Frankfurt) As many as seven European clubs are said to be competing for the Denmark international’s signature including Manchester City, Arsenal, Juventus, Milan, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. The winger was recently quoted to be “insanely happy” to read of reports liking him with the Gunners. (Philadelphia Union) The MLS Cup final, which Philadelphia Union lost to LAFC, was widely reported to be Wagner’s final game for the club, having impressed throughout the season with his attacking forays from left-back. One of his opponents in the final, Ecuador midfielder Jose Cifuentes, is also likely to be heading to Europe. KAI WAGNER JOAO FELIX BEN BRERETON DIAZ (Blackburn Rovers) While the Chile striker has insisted he will stay at Ewood Park until the end of the season, the decision might be out of his hands. His contract expires in the summer so the Rovers hierarchy risk losing him for free; although if he fires them to promotion, it will have been worth it. (Atletico Madrid) Following his sparkling performances in Qatar, where he was able to truly express himself without the shackles often imposed on him at club level, fans got a glimpse of the massive potential of Joao Felix. Arsenal are said to be leading the race for his signature as they step up their chase for a replacement for the injured Gabriel Jesus. (Las Palmas) Comparisons have already been drawn between Moleiro and Pedri, who also emerged from Las Palmas’ academy. Barcelona snapped up the Spain midfielder for just €5m in 2019, and nobody wants to miss out on another bargain: Real Madrid, Manchester City and Liverpool are among those interested.

His profile is much higher now, but at the start of this season there was still one doubt hanging over him. He had won two versions of the Copa Libertadores and one Brazilian Cup. But was he best suited to knockout competitions? Notoriously risk averse in the big matches, was he too cautious for a successful league campaign? He has now successfully silenced Sao Paulo-based club win their 11th national championship, extending their record as the league’s most successful team that doubt. Because the race for the 2022 Brazilian league title was not even close. In 2021,a“big three” had appeared to consolidate themselves at the top of the Brazilian game. Big-spending Atletico Mineiro had emerged to complete the domestic double, while Rio giants Flamengo are a mighty force. Neither had good league campaigns in 2022. After their golden year, Atletico fell back badly, perhaps distracted by their plans to open a new stadium in 2023. And Flamengo had a disastrous start when their Portuguese coach Paulo Sousa insisted on a back-three Palmeiras cruise to Brazilian league title system that did not suit the players. Dorival Junior came in and got the side right, but focused instead on the knockout competitions. Flamengo won the Libertadores and domestic cup, while often fielding reserve sides in league games. Does any of this devalue the triumph of Palmeiras? Not at all. They scored more goals than anyone else and conceded fewer. Beaten in the first round and in the last, they suffered just one defeat in the 36 matches in between – an extraordinary testimony to the team’s consistency in such a demanding competition. Abel Ferreira P Review\n\nWORLD SERVICE COACH OF THE YEAR Abel FERREIRA (Palmeiras) With the talent and intensity (and sometimes the antics) of a young Jose Mourinho. Some see him as a replacement for Tite after Qatar. But would his frequently cautious approach prove a good fit for the national team? PLAYER OF THE YEAR DUDU (Palmeiras) Stocky wide striker, experienced and intelligent, who scored seven goals in the campaign and helped set up plenty of others. A reserve in the 2011 Under-20 World Cupwinning team who briefly played in Ukraine for Dynamo Kyiv. NEWCOMER OF THE YEAR ENDRICK (Palmeiras) It is hard on Athletico Paranaense’s highly-promising Vitor Roque, but the award goes to someone who only played towards the end of the campaign and will join Real Madrid in 2024. The 16-year-old striker looks likeagenuine phenomenon. Newcomer of the Year…Endrick SEASON’S BEST WORLD SOCCER 79 is both a highly competent collective organiser ofateam, and a specialist at developing individual players. The transformation of Rony from a frustrating winger to the team’s cutting edge at centre-forward has been a wonder to behold. So superior was the campaign of Palmeiras, that they wrapped up the title weeks in advance, without ever having a serious challenger. Under former Brazil coach Mano Menezes, Internacional came second, but more interesting were third-placed Fluminense. Coach Fernando Diniz has long been seen as a promise, and this was by far the best year for his bold approach, where players are thrown forward in a bid to overload one flank. With plenty of options for a forward pass, the former great hope Paulo Henrique Ganso enjoyed the best year of his wayward career, while Argentine goal-poacher German Cano feasted on chances to finish as the league’s top scorer with 26 strikes. Corinthians finished fourth, improving during the campaign as playmaker Renato Augusto recovered his fitness and Portuguese coach Vitor Pereira found his feet. He stepped down at the end of a tricky year in which the highlight was the display in the final of the domestic cup, where they lost on penalties. Another coach stepping down is Luiz Felipe Scolari, who retired at the end of the year after safely steering Athletico Paranaense into sixth place and the group phase of the 2023 Copa Libertadores. Atletico Mineiro will have to go through the qualifying round, a considerable disappointment, while the same achievement for Fortaleza is a major triumph. One of the few first division teams from the north east, their campaign is a logistical nightmare, and their debut participation in the 2022 Libertadores added to the strain. They spent much of the first half of the season bottom of the table, until Argentine coach Juan Pablo Vojvoda worked his magic and they soared up the table. Of Brazil’s eight Libertadores representatives – Flamengo, Palmeiras, Internacional, Fluminense, Corinthians and Athletico Paranaense, plus Atletico Mineiro and Fortaleza in the qualifying rounds – seven took part in 2022. The fact that Fortaleza are among them is a minor miracle, but this is a statistic that points to an undeniable trend of distances opening up between wealthy clubs and the others. Sao Paulo, America Mineiro, Botafogo, Santos, Goias and Red Bull Bragantino will play in the Copa Sudamericana. One club who are extremely disappointed to have missed out on a Libertadores slot are Sao Paulo, since this was their stated objective. Botafogo will be happy to have survived in their first season back in the top flight, also their first under the new USA-based regime. They will go into 2023 feeling positive–a feeling that Santos cannot share. Pele’s old club is a miracle of its own. The population of Santos is under half a million, and it is barely credible that the club have been able to outperform giants from the metropolis. Youth development keeps them punching above their weight, but the storm clouds are gathering. Four relatively minor teams were relegated – Ceara, Atletico Goianiense, Avai and Juventude. They have been replaced by a quartet Top scorer… Fluminense striker German Cano struck 26 league goals Star man… Palmeiras striker Rony They scored more goals than anyone else and conceded fewer. Beaten in the first round and in the last, they suffered just one defeat in the 36 matches in between of traditional giants–Cruzeiro, Gremio, Bahia and Vasco da Gama. The battle to stay up next year looks set to be especially fierce. Managerial mastermind... Abel Ferreira\n\nHOW THE LEAGUE WAS WON CONTINENTAL QUALIFIERS COACH OF THE YEAR The16 clubs play two tournaments a year. The Apertura ends with play-offs, and in the final Bolivar beat The Strongest in the La Paz derby. The Strongest were ahead in the league-based Clausura, but political disturbances halted the action with six rounds to go. Two tournaments, the Apertura and Finalizacion, are played per year. In the first, Atletico Nacional beat Tolima 4-3 in the two-legged play-off final, with stoppage-time goals in both legs. In the second, Deportivo Pereira beat Medellin on penalties to win their first title. There are two separate championships in the year, both held on a league basis involving 12 teams. Libertad won the Apertura by a seven-point margin, while Olimpia claimed the Clausura by a single point. A complex, three-stage system boils down to a semi-final where the winners of the two main stages (Liverpool and Nacional) contest the right to meet the team with most points overall (Nacional). After extra-time Nacional won 4-1, rendering the final unnecessary. The16 teams play in a league format, and the destiny of the title was not in doubt after Santiago giants Colo-Colo took the lead after eight rounds and ended the 30 rounds with an 11-point lead. The16 teams play two league stages, and the winners meet in a two-legged final, where Aucas of Quito won their first-ever title with a 1-0 aggregate win over Barcelona of Guayaquil. The19 teams play two league campaigns, and the season concluded with a two-legged final between the stage winners, where Alianza Lima retained their title, coming from behind to beat Melgar 2-1 on aggregate. A league of 16 teams, with the top four going into a mini-league where the best two qualified for a one-off final. Worthy winners were Metropolitanos of Caracas, only founded in 2011, who beat Monagas on penalties after a1-1 draw.
