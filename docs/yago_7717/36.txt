Original Title: Die Hinrichtung

Also Known As: Naked Massacre

Directed by: Denis Héroux

Cat Out of the Bag Alert! This review contains spoilers for this film!

Synopsis: Loosely based on the Richard Speck murders, an unstable American Vietnam deserter named Cain Adams (Mathieu Carrière) terrorizes a home full of female nurses.

Featured Feline: Living with the women in the house is a cream-colored Persian cat.

The cat is included in many scenes with the nurses and has a regular spot on the windowsill in the kitchen.

This comes into play when Adams breaks into the house through the kitchen window.

He pulls the cat back and closes the window before picking up the animal.

Several times Adams picks up and cradles the cat after committing his horrific acts.

The cat is an unfortunate witness to the carnage.

Adams again picks up the cat and lays down on a bed, not knowing the one victim he missed is hiding beneath.

Later the cat is sitting in the window as police and reporters swarm the house.

Near the end of the film, an officer left to guard the home shares his milk with the cat.

Final Mewsings: About the only redeeming thing about this movie is that the cat survives.

Many thank to Mark Murton and Wahrhaftig for letting us know about the cat in this film.
