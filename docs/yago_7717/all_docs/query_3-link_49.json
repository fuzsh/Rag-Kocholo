        "text": "Today's book of poetry:\n\nHard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines. Jason Heroux. A Stuart Ross Book. Mansfield Press. Toronto, Ontario. 2016.\n\nToday's book of poetry might just as well say it and get it out of the way. Jason Heroux has become one of our favourite poets. It's not like we didn't warn you.\n\nBack in September of 2013 Today's book of poetry took a look at Jason Heroux's chapbook In Defense of the Attacked Center Pawn (Puddles of Sky Press, 2013) and thought it was brilliant stuff and ripe with promise. You can see that blog here:\n\nSince then we've read Emergency Hallelujah (Mansfield Press, 2008) and had it scheduled for a blog, the only reason you're not reading about that now is that Hard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines came through the door and we simply couldn't resist.\n\nHeroux's latest volume of poetry is a seriously strong statement of intent. Heroux has discovered a shady planet of surreal shadows where he writes from some dark corner to illuminate everything we know. And boy, oh boy!, does he hammer out some choice humour along the way.\n\nHard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines\n\nIt's easy to breathe if you're breathing\n\nbreathe all you want the air is too cold\n\nand weak to run away\n\nyour life is a gift with your name on it\n\na word there's no word for\n\nbreathe all you want it's easy to breathe\n\nif you're breathing\n\nthe air is an all-you-can-breathe buffet\n\nit's hard work cheering up sad machines\n\nhard work cleaning a number's cage\n\nour heartbeats are staggered staples\n\nholding us together\n\nbirds sing like kettles boiling song-water\n\nyour life is a gift with your name on it\n\nand your life is a word there's no word for\n\nbreath all you want breathe all you want\n\n...\n\nToday's book of poetry could be easily convinced that the poet Jason Heroux is channelling the spirit and voice of the great American novelist, short story writer and cultural guru Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Heroux has a similarly morbid comic stranglehold on reality.\n\nThe dilemma for Today's book of poetry is that when it came to picking actual poems for today's blog I was stumped. Hard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines is so ripe with lovely fruit that picking which little piece of wonder to share was beyond me so we resorted to the Odin resolution. Whenever we are blocked we write down the page numbers of every poem we wish to consider, post them on a wall and then have Odin throw darts. The poems we are using today were the first three he hit out of the dozens on offer.\n\nHeroux's epigraph at the beginning of Hard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines is from the French author and anarchist Pierre Antin-Grenier (1947-2014). Antin-Grenier was experimental and a loosely connected member of the \"extrême contemporain\" - a notion in continuous movement.\n\nIt's in the hollow of the\n\nordinary that the marvelous\n\nmost often makes its nest\n\n-- Pierre Autin-Grenier\n\nToday's book of poetry is convinced Heroux has lived up to the challenge; Hard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines rolls over the mundane and ordinary to punch out marvelous poetry from every unknowable landscape he encounters.\n\nYield\n\nOur yield is now, this moment\n\nis what will eventually\n\nbecome of us, our only harvest\n\nis the one we're gathering.\n\nWater is drawn by the one\n\nwith the well. Whoever has lungs\n\nwill breathe in and out. The one\n\nwith the horse will ride into town.\n\nEverything is nothing but horns\n\nhonking at death, and numbers\n\nattacking numbers, apricot\n\njam stuck on the table knife.\n\nEverything is nothing but almonds\n\ndivided by almonds, and grass blades\n\nsavouring our shadow's champagne,\n\na car without wheels crawling through mud.\n\nWhy does everyone seek refuge elsewhere?\n\nWhoever has the orange will peel the skin.\n\nWhoever has a thread will feed the needle.\n\nThe one with enough footsteps will walk to the store.\n\nOur only harvest is the one we're gathering, this moment\n\nis what will eventually become of us, our yield is now.\n\n...\n\nThe first part of Hard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines is made up of shorter, one or two page poems. Later on in the collection Heroux spreads out a little and writes some longer poems and poem sequences. This all works.\n\nOur morning read was a Heroux buffet. We read from Hard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines of course, but we also opened up Emergency Hallelujah and In Defense of the Attacked Center Pawn. Milo, our head tech, led the charge this morning which should leave him in a good mood. His new task is to now track down and procure the other thirteen titles Heroux has listed.\n\nToday's book of poetry is certain that in the years ahead having Jason Heroux on your shelf will help to prove your smarts.\n\nBlue Yodel of the Broken\n\nWhat more do I want how many\n\nmore feathers would make me happy\n\non a bird how much extra egg yolk\n\ndo I need in an eggshell.\n\nOur death chirps like a cricket\n\nin the quietest corner of the dollar.\n\nBees are kept where two bones meet\n\na body develops in the body\n\nwhere fruit trees are grown\n\nthe cows are kept\n\nin the same name as the place\n\nwhere the hay is kept.\n\nOur death jumps into us the way\n\nthe moon leaps into a lake to cool off\n\nswimming in the water that isn't there.\n\nWhat more of a handshake\n\ncan you hold in your hand\n\nhow much of this fork\n\ndo you need to eat dinner.\n\nThe blown-out candle\n\nis kept where the wish is kept.\n\nHow much more walnut meat\n\nin the walnut shell would it take\n\nto make us feel safe in the world.\n\nI believe in the barbecue cover\n\nthat covers the barbecue I believe\n\nin the same name as the place\n\nwhere the bird is kept\n\nthe cage is kept.\n\nHow much more\n\npiggy bank can\n\nthe piggy bank hold.\n\nWherever you are\n\nyou are a little rain\n\nthat never rained you are\n\na little hurt that never hurt anything.\n\nSometimes in the bank I touch\n\nsomeone else's money and wake up\n\n...\n\nIf you read Today's book of poetry more than once you'll realize I am praising a new book of poetry almost every other day. I fear it could all just begin to sound like rain. But the truth is that for every book of poetry Today's book of poetry posts there are three or four that don't make it. I DO like every book that makes it onto the blog. If the blog sometimes lacks a completely fresh veneer or the vocabulary to do these books justice it is entirely on Today's book of poetry.\n\nBooks like Jason Heroux's Hard Work Cheering Up Sad Machines are the reason this blog exists, I try to serve up gems every time out but this one is a highly polished jewel.\n\nJason Heroux\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJason Heroux is the author of three previous books of poetry—Memoirs of an Alias, Emergency Hallelujah, and Natural Capital, which was shortlisted for the 2013 ReLit award—and two novels. His work has been published widely in chapbook form and in journals, and has been translated into several languages. Jason lives in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nBLURBS"
