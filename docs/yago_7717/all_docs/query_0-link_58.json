One of the drawbacks of oHSV vectors is their limited replication and spread to neighboring cancer cells. Here, we report the outcome of a high-throughput chemical library screen to identify small-molecule compounds that augment the replication of oHSV G47Delta. Of the 2,640-screened bioactives, 6 compounds were identified and subsequently validated for enhanced G47Delta replication. Two of these compounds, dipyridamole and dilazep, interfered with nucleotide metabolism by potently and directly inhibiting the equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1). Replicative amplification promoted by dipyridamole and dilazep were dependent on HSV mutations in ICP6, the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Our results indicate that ENT1 antagonists augment oHSV replication in tumor cells by increasing cellular ribonucleoside activity.

A case of dipyridamole and paracetamol overdose is described in a previously healthy 58-year-old woman, which resulted in multi-organ failure requiring dialysis, inotropic support, ventilation and extensive surgical intervention for small bowel ischaemia. This case highlights the dangers of an unusually large overdose of a commonly prescribed drug, and reviews current knowledge of dipyridamole intoxication.\n\nFalse-negative dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging after caffeine infusion\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSmits, P.; Corstens, F.H.; Aengevaeren, W.R.\n\n1991-08-01\n\nThe vasodilator effect of intravenously administered dipyridamole may be caused by an increase in endogenous plasma adenosine levels. The authors evaluated the effect of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, on the diagnostic results of dipyridamole-201Tl myocardial imaging in eight patients with coronary artery disease. Caffeine infusion significantly attenuated the dipyridamole-induced fall in blood pressure and the accompanied increase in heart rate. The infusion of dipyridamole alone resulted in chest pain and ST-segment depressions on the electrocardiogram in four patients, whereas none of these problems occurred when the tests were repeated after caffeine. In six of eight patients, caffeine was responsiblemoreÂ Â» for false-negative dipyridamole-201Tl tests. Semiquantitive scores of the dipyridamole-induced 201Tl perfusion defects were decreased by caffeine from 9.0 {plus minus} 0.9 to 2.0 {plus minus} 1.1 points (p less than 0.05). Computerized analysis revealed a caffeine-mediated reduction in the percent reversibility of the images from 46% {plus minus} 16% to 6% {plus minus} 10% (p less than 0.05). They conclude that the use of caffeinated products prior to dipyridamole-201Tl testing may be responsible for false-negative findings.Â«Â less\n\nCaffeine reduces dipyridamole-induced myocardial ischemia\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSmits, P.; Aengevaeren, W.R.; Corstens, F.H.\n\n1989-10-01\n\nThe mechanism of action of coronary vasodilation after dipyridamole may be based on inhibition of cellular uptake of circulating endogenous adenosine. Since caffeine has been reported to be a competitive antagonist of adenosine we studied the effect of caffeine on the outcome of dipiridamole-{sup 201}Tl cardiac imaging in one patient. During caffeine abstinence dipyridamole induced myocardial ischemia with down-slope ST depressions on the ECG, and reversible perfusion defects on the scintigrams. When the test was repeated 1 wk later on similar conditions, but now shortly after infusion of caffeine (4 mg/kg), the ECG showed nodepressions, and the scintigrams only slightmoreÂ Â» signs of ischemia. We conclude that when caffeine abstinence is not sufficient, the widespread use of coffee and related products may be responsible for false-negative findings in dipyridamole-201Tl cardiac imaging.Â«Â less\n\nEffect of dipyridamole plus aspirin on hemodialysis graft patency.\n\nPubMed\n\nDixon, Bradley S; Beck, Gerald J; Vazquez, Miguel A; Greenberg, Arthur; Delmez, James A; Allon, Michael; Dember, Laura M; Himmelfarb, Jonathan; Gassman, Jennifer J; Greene, Tom; Radeva, Milena K; Davidson, Ingemar J; Ikizler, T Alp; Braden, Gregory L; Fenves, Andrew Z; Kaufman, James S; Cotton, James R; Martin, Kevin J; McNeil, James W; Rahman, Asif; Lawson, Jeffery H; Whiting, James F; Hu, Bo; Meyers, Catherine M; Kusek, John W; Feldman, Harold I\n\n2009-05-21\n\nArteriovenous graft stenosis leading to thrombosis is a major cause of complications in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Robert\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Dipyridamole was introduced decades ago as a treatment for angina, subsequently found to inhibit platelet aggregation. It is most commonly used, and approved for use in thromboembolism prevention, following surgery. Some of its recognized effects such as adenosine uptake inhibition, elevation of cAMP and cGMP levels, vasodilation, and tissue perfusion are important in various ocular disorders. For this reason, dipyridamole represents an interesting candidate as a therapeutic target for the treatment of eye disorders affecting different ocular structures. The aim of this article is to review the evidence and current understanding of the mechanisms by which dipyridamole exerts its effects on different ocular tissues, discuss the role of dipyridamole in clinical practice, and highlight areas of use and routes of administration.

Thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy was performed at rest and after 0.56 mg/kg intravenous dipyridamole during four minutes in 16 patients with sarcoidosis. The myocardial scan (45-degree and 70-degree left anterior oblique, and anterior views) was divided into 15 segments. Results were evaluated by the number of segmental defects and with a global perfusion score (from 0 to 60) by a semi-quantitative index depending on themoreÂ Â» size and severity of myocardial thallium-201 defects. Thirteen of the 16 patients showed partial or total reversion of their thallium-201 defects on redistribution scanning either at rest or after dipyridamole. The mean (+/- SD) number of myocardial perfusion defects that were present in all the patients decreased from 5.31 +/- 1.78 at rest to 3.25 +/- 2.52 after redistribution (p less than 0.001) and to 2.19 +/- 2.10 after dipyridamole (p less than 0.001). The mean global perfusion score increased from 53.2 +/- 3.0 at rest to 56.2 +/- 2.9 after redistribution (p less than 0.001) and to 57.2 +/- 2.7 after dipyridamole (p less than 0.001). A significant correlation (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001) was found between the increase of global perfusion score on redistribution and after dipyridamole. The reversibility of myocardial scan defects is a common finding in sarcoidosis. It makes unlikely the role of scar fibrosis or extensive confluent granulomas as a mechanism for such defects. The effect of dipyridamole suggests the presence of reversible disorders lying at the coronary microvascular level.Â«Â less\n\nComparison of exercise, dobutamine-atropine and dipyridamole-atropine stress echocardiography in detecting coronary artery disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNedeljkovic, Ivana; Ostojic, Miodrag; Beleslin, Branko; Djordjevic-Dikic, Ana; Stepanovic, Jelena; Nedeljkovic, Milan; Stojkovic, Sinisa; Stankovic, Goran; Saponjski, Jovica; Petrasinovic, Zorica; Giga, Vojislav; Mitrovic, Predrag\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBackground Dipyridamole and dobutamine stress echocardiography testing are most widely utilized, but their sensitivity remained suboptimal in comparison to routine exercise stress echocardiography. The aim of our study is to compare, head-to-head, exercise, dobutamine and dipyridamole stress echocardiography tests, performed with state-of-the-art protocols in a large scale prospective group of patients. Methods Dipyridamole-atropine (Dipatro: 0.84 mg/kg over 10 min i.v. dipyridamole with addition of up to 1 mg of atropine), dobutamine-atropine (Dobatro: up to 40 mcg/kg/min i.v. dobutamine with addition of up to 1 mg of atropine) and exercise (Ex, Bruce) were performed in 166 pts. Of them, 117 pts without resting wall motion abnormalities were enrolled in study (91 male; mean age 54 Â± 10 years; previous non-transmural myocardial infarction in 32 pts, angina pectoris in 69 pts and atypical chest pain in 16 pts). Tests were performed in random sequence, in 3 different days, within 5 day period under identical therapy. All patients underwent coronary angiography. Results Significant coronary artery disease (CAD; â¥50% diameter stenosis) was present in 69 pts (57 pts 1-vessel CAD, 12 multivessel CAD) and absent in 48 pts.

Additionally, their oral bioavailabilities may be affected by coadministration of acid-reducing agents that elevate gastric pH. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of a multicompartmental in vitro dissolution apparatus, Gastrointestinal Simulator (GIS), in predicting in vivo dissolution of certain oral medications. In vitro dissolution studies of fluconazole, a BCS class I, and dipyridamole, a BCS class II weak bases (class IIb), were performed in the GIS as well as United States Pharmacopeia (USP) apparatus II and compared with the results of clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. In both USP apparatus II and GIS, fluconazole completely dissolved within 60 min regardless of pH, reflecting no DDI between fluconazole and acid-reducing agents in a clinical study. On the other hand, seven-fold and 15-fold higher concentrations of dipyridamole than saturation solubility were observed in the intestinal compartments in GIS with gastric pH 2.0. Precipitation of dipyridamole was also observed in the GIS, and the percentage of dipyridamole in solution was 45.2 Â± 7.0%. In GIS with gastric pH 6.0, mimicking the coadministration of acid-reducing agents, the concentration of dipyridamole was equal to its saturation solubility, and the percentage of drug in solution was 9.3 Â± 2.7%. These results are consistent with the clinical DDI study of dipyridamole with famotidine, which significantly reduced the Cmax and area under the curve. An In situ mouse infusion study combined with GIS revealed that high concentration of dipyridamole in the GIS enhanced oral drug absorption, which confirmed the supersaturation of dipyridamole. In conclusion, GIS was shown to be a useful apparatus to predict in vivo dissolution for BCS class IIb drugs.\n\nDipyridamole for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke and other vascular events: a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized controlled trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeonardi-Bee, Jo; Bath, Philip M W; Bousser, Marie-Germaine; Davalos, Antoni; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Guiraud-Chaumeil, Bernard; Sivenius, Juhani; Yatsu, Frank; Dewey, Michael E\n\n2005-01-01\n\nResults from randomized controlled trials of dipyridamole, given with or without aspirin, for secondary prevention after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have given conflicting results. We performed a meta-analysis using individual patient data from relevant randomized controlled trials. Randomized controlled trials involving dipyridamole in patients with previous ischemic stroke or TIA were sought from searches of the Cochrane Library, other electronic databases, references lists, earlier reviews, and contact with the manufacturer of dipyridamole. Individual patient data were merged from 5 of 7 relevant trials involving 11 459 patients. Results were adjusted for age, gender, qualifying event, and history of previous hypertension. Recurrent stroke was reduced by dipyridamole as compared with control (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.00), and by combined aspirin and dipyridamole versus aspirin alone (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.93), dipyridamole alone (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90), or control (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.71). The point estimates obtained for the comparisons of aspirin and dipyridamole versus control (OR, 0.63; significant) or versus aspirin (OR, 0.88; nonsignificant) were similar if the data from the largest trial, ESPS II (which provided 57% of data), were excluded. Similar findings were observed for nonfatal stroke. The combination of aspirin and dipyridamole also significantly reduced the composite outcome of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and vascular death as compared with aspirin alone (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.97), dipyridamole alone (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.90), or control (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.75). Vascular death was not altered in any group. Dipyridamole, given alone or with aspirin, reduces stroke recurrence in patients with previous ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The combination of aspirin and dipyridamole also reduces the composite of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and\n\nExperience of low-dose aminophylline use to relieve minor adverse effects of dipyridamole in patients undergoing stress myocardial perfusion imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Li-Fan; Cheng, Cheng-Yi; Hou, Cheng-Han; Ku, Chih-Hung; Tseng, Neng-Chuan; Shen, Daniel H Y\n\n2014-06-01\n\nIntravenous administration of aminophylline is widely adopted to reverse dipyridamole-related adverse effects (AEs) during stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of lower-dose aminophylline to relieve minor AEs. 2,250 consecutive patients undergoing dipyridamole-stressed MPI were enrolled. Information concerning AE occurrence and dosages of aminophylline was collected to evaluate the efficacy of lower-dose aminophylline. A logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of dipyridamole-related AE occurrence. No severe AE was noted. Overall mild AE incidence was 37.0% (833/2,250 patients). Initial low-dose (25 mg) aminophylline relieved symptoms in 98.8% of patients with mild AEs (823/833 patients). An extra 25 mg aminophylline sufficed to reverse all such AEs. Mean body mass index (BMI) differed significantly between patients with and without any AE [25.6 vs 25.1 (P = .009)]. There was no significant difference between two subgroups in mean age, male gender prevalence, body height and weight, dipyridamole dose/BMI, or prevalence of significant perfusion defect(s) on MPI. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated BMI remained the independent predictor of dipyridamole-related AE occurrence (odds ratio 1.028, 95% confidence interval 1.007-1.049, P = .01). Low-dose (â¦50 mg, and usually 25 mg) aminophylline seems sufficient to relieve mild dipyridamole-related AEs during stress MPI.\n\nEffect of surfactants, gastric emptying, and dosage form on supersaturation of dipyridamole in an in vitro model simulating the stomach and duodenum.\n\nPubMed\n\nMitra, A; Fadda, H M\n\n2014-08-04\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of gastric emptying patterns, surfactants, and dosage form on the supersaturation of a poorly soluble weakly basic drug, dipyridamole, using an in vitro model mimicking the dynamic environment of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and, furthermore, to evaluate the usefulness of this model in establishing correlations to in vivo bioavailability for drugs with solubility/dissolution limited absorption. A simulated stomach duodenum model comprising four compartments was used to assess supersaturation and precipitation kinetics as a function of time. It integrates physiologically relevant fluid volumes, fluid transfer rates, and pH changes of the upper GI tract. Monoexponential gastric emptying patterns simulating the fasted state were compared to linear gastric emptying patterns simulating the fed state. The effect of different surfactants commonly used in oral preparations, specifically, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), poloxamer-188, and polysorbate-80, on dipyridamole supersaturation was investigated while maintaining surface tension of the simulated gastric fluids at physiological levels and without obtaining artificial micellar solubilization of the drug. The supersaturation behavior of different dose strengths of dipyridamole was explored. Significant levels of dipyridamole supersaturation were observed in the duodenal compartment under all the different in vivo relevant conditions explored. Dipyridamole supersaturation ratios of up to 11-fold have been observed, and supersaturation has been maintained for up to 120 min. Lower duodenal concentrations of dipyridamole were observed under linear gastric emptying patterns compared to mononexponential gastric emptying. The mean duodenal area under concentration-time curves (AUC60min) for the dipyridamole concentration profile in the duodenal compartment is significantly different for all the surfactants explored (P < 0.05).

Since inherent vulnerability of coronary circulation of microminipigs has not been characterized, we performed dipyridamole-stress test to both microminipigs and beagle dogs, and compared the results. Dipyridamole in doses of 0.056 and 0.56Â mg/kg were intravenously infused over 10Â min (nÂ =Â 4 for each animal). Dipyridamole decreased the systolic/diastolic blood pressures and double product in dogs as well as in microminipigs; but it did not significantly alter the heart rate or the global balance between the myocardial oxygen demand and supply in either animal. While organic coronary arterial stenosis was not detected in either animal, dogs have well-developed epicardial intracoronary networks unlike microminipigs. Like in humans, dipyridamole did not affect the ST segment of microminipigs, whereas it substantially depressed that in dogs. The results indicate the onset of subendocardial ischemia by dipyridamole in dogs may be partly associated with their well-developed native coronary collateral channels. Microminipigs would be more useful to evaluate the drugs which may affect the coronary circulation in the pre-clinical study than dogs. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.

We developed a nurse-administered protocol to screen and pretreat patients so they could be safely tested. We prospectively screened patients referred for intravenous dipyridamole thallium testing and retrospectively reviewed a comparison group of patients who had undergone intravenous dipyridamole testing before our bronchospasm protocol. We studied 492 consecutive patients referred for intravenous dipyridamole thallium testing, separating those with complete data (n = 451) into two groups: group A (n = 72), patients assessed to be at risk for intravenous dipyridamole-induced bronchospasm who received our bronchospasm treatment protocol; and group B (n = 379), patients assessed to be free of risk, who did not receive our bronchospasm protocol. Group C (n = 89) was a retrospective comparison group of patients who had undergone intravenous dipyridamole testing before initiation of the protocol. Patients were considered at risk for an adverse event if any of the following were present: peak flow < or =400 ml at the time of the test (spirometry by nurse) that increased to >400 ml after bronchodilator treatment, wheezing audible with stethoscope, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma or dyspnea on exertion at less than four blocks, or resting respiratory rate >18 breaths/min. The test was considered contraindicated if resting oxygen saturation was <85%, respiratory rate < or =36 breaths/min, or peak flow measured by peak flowmeter <400 ml after bronchodilator inhalant (albuterol or metaproterenol sulfate by spacer) at a dose of up to six puffs. One minute after injections of thallium-201, patients at risk were given 50 mg aminophylline by slow intravenous injection. We looked for major and minor adverse effects and divided them into three categories: (1) minor events (transient headache, abdominal discomfort, or nausea\n\nReduction of indium-111 platelet deposition on Dacron vascular grafts in humans by aspirin plus dipyridamole\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStratton, J.R.; Ritchie, J.L.\n\nAspirin plus dipyridamole reduces platelet accumulation on short-term Dacron vascular grafts in man. To determine whether drug inhibition of platelet deposition is sustained on older grafts, we studied 18 men aged 41 to 87 years who had Dacron aortic bifurcation grafts in place a mean of 43.4 months (range 9.8 to 121.0) before and during short-term therapy with aspirin (325 mg tid) plus dipyridamole (75 mg tid). During both the baseline and drug studies, indium-111 (/sup 111/In) platelet deposition was quantitated by two techniques, standard planar imaging performed at 24, 48, and 72 hr after injection of platelets and singlemoreÂ Â» photon emission computed tomographic imaging performed at 24 and 72 hr after injection. All analyses were performed in a blinded fashion. On both the planar and tomographic images, platelet accumulation on the graft was quantitated by a graft/blood ratio that compared activity in the graft to simultaneously collected whole blood /sup 111/In platelet activity. Aspirin plus dipyridamole reduced the tomographic graft/blood ratio at 24 hr (20.6 +/- 3.5 vs 17.3 +/- 2.5) (+/-SEM) and at 72 hr (29.0 +/- 4.8 vs 25.0 +/- 4.1) after injection of platelets (p = .02). Dacron vascular grafts. Similarly, the planar graft/blood ratio was reduced at 24 hr (2.7 +/- 0.5 vs 2.4 +/- 0.5), 48 hr (3.7 +/- 0.9 vs 3.1 +/- 0.7), and 72 hr (4.0 +/- 0.9 vs 3.6 +/- 0.8) (p = .04). We conclude that aspirin (325 mg tid) plus dipyridamole (75 mg tid) reduces platelet accumulation on long-term Dacron vascular grafts.Â«Â less\n\nAdditional diagnostic value of systolic dysfunction induced by dipyridamole stress cardiac magnetic resonance used in detecting coronary artery disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nHusser, Oliver; BodÃ­, Vicente; SanchÃ­s, Juan; Mainar, Luis; NÃºÃ±ez, Julio; LÃ³pez-Lereu, MarÃ­a P; Monmeneu, JosÃ© V; Ruiz, Vicente; Rumiz, Eva; Moratal, David; Chorro, Francisco J; LlÃ¡cer, Angel\n\n2009-04-01\n\nDipyridamole stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is used to detect coronary artery disease (CAD). However, few data are available on the diagnostic value of the systolic dysfunction induced by dipyridamole. This study investigated whether the induction of systolic dysfunction supplements the diagnostic information provided by perfusion imaging in the detection of CAD. Overall, 166 patients underwent dipyridamole CMR and quantitative coronary angiography, with CAD being defined as a stenosis > or =70%. Systolic dysfunction at rest, systolic dysfunction with dipyridamole, induced systolic dysfunction, and stress first-pass perfussion deficit (PD) and delayed enhancement were quantified. In the multivariate analysis, PD (hazard ratio [HR]=1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.91;P< .0001) and induced systolic dysfunction (OR=1.8; 95% CI, 1.18-2.28; P< .007) were independently associated with CAD and had a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 62% and 43% and 96%, respectively. Patients were categorized as having no ischemia (Group 1), PD but no induced systolic dysfunction (Group 2), or induced systolic dysfunction irrespective of PD (Group 3). In Group 3, the prevalence of CAD was higher than in Group 1 or 2 (96% vs. 22% and 79%, respectively; P=.001) and the risk of CAD was two-fold higher than in Group 2 (OR=2.34; 95% CI, 1.07-5.13; P=.034). Compared with Group 2, more hypoperfused segments were observed in Group 3 (6.2+/-2.6 vs. 7.4+/-3.4; P=.044), and more diseased vessels (1.4+/-1.0 vs. 1.8+/-0.9; P=.036). Adding induced systolic dysfunction to perfusion and clinical data improved the multivariate model's C-statistic for predicting CAD (0.81 vs. 0.87; P=.02). Combining induced systolic dysfunction with perfusion imaging increases the diagnostic accuracy of detecting CAD and enables patients with severe ischemia and a high probability of CAD to be identified.\n\nThe possible protective effects of dipyridamole on ischemic reperfusion injury of priapism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKaraguzel, Ersagun; Bayraktar, Cemil; Kutlu, Omer; Yulug, Esin; Mentese, Ahmet; Okatan, Ali Ertan; Colak, Fatih; Ozer, Serap; O.Kazaz, Ilke\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Purpose To investigate the protective effects against ischemia reperfusion injury of dipyridamole in a model of induced priapism in rats. Materials and Methods Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups, control, P/R, P/R+DMSO and P/R+D. 3ml blood specimens were collected from vena cava inferior in order to determine serum MDA, IMA, TAS, TOS and OSI values, and penile tissue was taken for histopathological examination in control group. Priapism was induced in P/R group. After 1h, priapism was concluded and 30 min reperfusion was performed. In P/R+DMSO group 1ml/kg DMSO was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before reperfusion, while in P/R+D group 10mg/kg dipyridamole was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before reperfusion. Blood and penis specimens were collected after the end of 30 min reperfusion period. Sinusoidal area (Âµm2), tears in tunica albuginea and injury parameters in sinusoidal endothelium of penis were investigated. Results Histopathological examination revealed no significant changes in term of sinusoidal area. A decrease in tears was observed in P/R+D group compared to P/R group (p<0.05). Endothelial injury decreased in P/R+D group compared to P/R group (p>0.05). There were no significant differences in MDA and IMA values between groups. A significant increase in TOS and OSI values was observed in P/R+D group compared to P/R group. A significant decrease in TAS levels was observed in P/R+D group compared to the P/R group. Conclusions The administration of dipyridamole before reperfusion in ischemic priapism model has a potential protective effect against histopathological injury of the penis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of the gastrointestinal simulator (GIS), a novel in vivo predictive dissolution (iPD) methodology, in predicting the in vivo behavior of the weakly basic drug dipyridamole when coupled with in silico analysis. The GIS is a multicompartmental dissolution apparatus, which represents physiological gastric emptying in the fasted state. Kinetic parameters for drug dissolution and precipitation were optimized by fitting a curve to the dissolved drug amount-time profiles in the United States Pharmacopeia apparatus II and GIS. Optimized parameters were incorporated into mathematical equations to describe the mass transport kinetics of dipyridamole in the GI tract. By using this in silico model, intraluminal drug concentration-time profile was simulated. The predicted profile of dipyridamole in the duodenal compartment adequately captured observed data. In addition, the plasma concentration-time profile was also predicted using pharmacokinetic parameters following intravenous administration. On the basis of the comparison with observed data, the in silico approach coupled with the GIS successfully predicted in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles. Although further investigations are still required to generalize, these results indicated that incorporating GIS data into mathematical equations improves the predictability of in vivo behavior of weakly basic drugs like dipyridamole.\n\nRelationship between regional myocardial blood flow and thallium-201 distribution in the presence of coronary artery stenosis and dipyridamole-induced vasodilation.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMays, A E; Cobb, F R\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThis study assesses the relationship between the distribution of thallium-201 and myocardial blood flow during coronary vasodilation induced by intravenous dipyridamole in canine models of partial and complete coronary artery stenosis. 10 dogs were chronically instrumented with catheters in the left atrium and aorta and with a balloon occluder and electromagnetic flow probe on the proximal left circumflex coronary artery. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured during control conditions with radioisotope-labeled microspheres, and the phasic reactive hyperemic response to a 20-s transient occlusion was then recorded. Dipyridamole was then infused intravenously until phasic coronary blood flow increased to match peak hyperemic values. The left circumflex coronary artery was either partially occluded to reduce phasic blood flow to control values (group 1) or it was completely occluded (group 2), and thallium-201 and a second microsphere label were injected. 5 min later, the animals were sacrificed, the left ventricle was sectioned into 1-2-g samples, and thallium-201 activity and regional myocardial blood flow were measured. Curvilinear regression analyses between thallium-201 localization and myocardial blood flow during dipyridamole infusion demonstrated a slightly better fit to a second- as compared with a first-order model, indicating a slight roll-off of thallium activity as myocardial blood flow increases. During the dipyridamole infusion, the increases in phasic blood flow, the distributions of regional myocardial blood flow, and the relationships between thallium-201 localization and regional blood flow were comparable to values previously observed in exercising dogs with similar occlusions. These data provide basic validation that supports the use of intravenous dipyridamole and thallium-201 as an alternative to exercise stress and thallium-201 for evaluating the effects of coronary occlusive lesions on the distribution of regional myocardial blood flow\n\nSynthesis of a new photoreactive derivative of dipyridamole and its use in the manufacture of artificial surfaces with low thrombogenicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nAldenhoff, Y B; Pijpers, A P; Koole, L H\n\n1997-01-01\n\nPhotoimmobilization of dipyridamole (Persantin) was accomplished through the use of a new synthetic conjugate molecule, 1. Persantin is a powerful inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation and is widely used as a vasodilator. Conjugate 1 consists of triply protected dipyridamole [three of the four hydroxyl groups carry a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) protective group) and the photoreactive 4-azidobenzoyl group. A short hydrophilic spacer chain, derived from triethylene glycol, separates the protected dipyridamole system and the photoreactive group. Compound 1 was immobilized on polyurethane sheets (Pellethane D-55) through irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light, and the protective groups were removed afterward. The resulting modified polyurethane surfaces were characterized by different physicochemical techniques: UV extinction, contact angle measurements (captive bubble technique), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The UV extinction measurements showed the presence of 13 +/- 1 nmol of immobilized dipyridamole/cm2. The contact angle measurements revealed that the modified surface was markedly more hydrophilic than the control (i.e. unmodified polyurethane). XPS measurements clearly established the presence of immobilized dipyridamole in the outermost layers of the modified surface. This was especially clear from the XPS spectra recorded at a low take-off angle (approximately 6 degrees). Furthermore, the XPS spectra showed that the TBDMS protective groups had been quantitatively removed during the deprotection/washing treatment. The in vitro blood compatibility of the modified surface was studied with the thrombin generation assay as developed in our group, as well as with scanning electron microscopy. The thrombin generation test produced a lag time of 1275 s for the modified surface, as opposed to 569 s for the control. Scanning electron microscopy showed that far fewer platelets adhere to the modified surface (approximately 7 x 10(3)/mm2) as\n\nIn vivo quantitation of platelet deposition on human peripheral arterial bypass grafts using indium-111-labeled platelets. Effect of dipyridamole and aspirin\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPumphrey, C.W.; Chesebro, J.H.; Dewanjee, M.K.\n\nIndium-111-labeled autologous platelets, injected 48 hours after operation, were used to evaluate the thrombogenicity of prosthetic material and the effect of platelet inhibitor therapy in vivo. Dacron double-velour (Microvel) aortofemoral artery bifurcation grafts were placed in 16 patients and unilateral polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal grafts were placed in 10 patients. Half the patients in each group received platelet inhibitors before operation (dipyridamole, 100 mg 4 times a day) and after operation (dipyridamole, 75 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid, 325 mg 3 times a day); the rest of the patients served as control subjects. Five-minute scintigrams of the graft region were taken with amoreÂ Â» gamma camera interfaced with a computer 48, 72, and 96 hours after injection of the labeled platelets. Platelet deposition was estimated from the radioactivities of the grafts and expressed as counts per 100 pixels per microcurie injected. Dipyridamole and aspirin therapy significantly reduced the number of platelets deposited on Dacron grafts and prevented platelet accumulation over 3 days. With the small amount of platelet deposition on polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal artery grafts even in control patients, platelet inhibitor therapy had no demonstrable effect on platelet deposition on these grafts. It is concluded that (1) platelet deposition on vascular grafts in vivo can be quantitated by noninvasive methods, and (2) dipyridamole and aspirin therapy reduced platelet deposition on Dacron aortofemoral artery grafts.Â«Â less\n\nStudy of controlled-release floating tablets of dipyridamole using the dry-coated method.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Kai; Wen, Haoyang; Yang, Feifei; Yu, Yibin; Gai, Xiumei; Wang, Haiying; Li, Pingfei; Pan, Weisan; Yang, Xinggang\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDipyridamole (DIP), having a short biological half-life, has a narrow absorption window and is primarily absorbed in the stomach. So, the purpose of this study was to prepare controlled-release floating (CRF) tablets of dipyridamole by the dry-coated method. The influence of agents with different viscosity, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and polyvinylpyrollidon K30 (PVP K30) in the core tablet and low-viscosity HPMC and PVP K30 in the coating layer on drug release, were investigated. Then, a study with a three-factor, three-level orthogonal experimental design was used to optimize the formulation of the CRF tablets. After data processing, the optimized formulation was found to be: 80âmg HPMC K4M in the core tablet, 80âmg HPMC E15 in core tablet and 40âmg PVP K30 in the coating layer. Moreover, an in vitro buoyancy study showed that the optimized formulation had an excellent floating ability and could immediately float without a lag time and this lasted more than 12âh. Furthermore, an in vivo gamma scintigraphic study showed that the gastric residence time of the CRF tablet was about 8âh.\n\nDecreased coronary vasodilatory capacity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy determined by split-dose thallium-dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKoga, Y.; Yamaguchi, R.; Ogata, M.\n\n1990-05-01\n\nSplit-dose thallium-dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy was performed in patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) who had angiographically normal coronary arteries. The dipyridamole-induced increases in thallium-201 uptake, calculated to evaluate coronary vasodilatory capacity, were significantly lower in 30 patients with HC than in 13 control subjects (177 +/- 58 vs 281 +/- 46%) and the reductions were observed in both the septal and lateral segments. The reductions of the septal segment in HC patients were significantly greater than those in 10 hypertensive patients with comparable degrees of septal hypertrophy. Of patients with HC, 16 had increases in thallium uptake well below themoreÂ Â» normal range. Compared with those having normal increases, these patients had significantly lower exercise duration (11 vs 15 minutes), with 33% having ST depression develop at a workload less than or equal to 80 watts. These data indicate that approximately one-half of patients with HC have impaired coronary vasodilatory capacity that could be an important pathophysiologic abnormality of HC resulting in the development of myocardial ischemia and the impairment of cardiac performance during exercise.Â«Â less\n\nBone Regeneration in Critical Bone Defects Using Three-Dimensionally Printed Î²-Tricalcium Phosphate/Hydroxyapatite Scaffolds Is Enhanced by Coating Scaffolds with Either Dipyridamole or BMP-2\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIshack, Stephanie; Mediero, Aranzazu; Wilder, Tuere; Ricci, John L.; Cronstein, Bruce N.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBone defects resulting from trauma or infection need timely and effective treatments to restore damaged bone. Using specialized three-dimensional (3-D) printing technology we have created custom 3-D scaffolds of hydroxyapatite (HA)/Beta-Tri-Calcium Phosphate (Î²-TCP) to promote bone repair. To further enhance bone regeneration we have coated the scaffolds with dipyridamole, an agent that increases local adenosine levels by blocking cellular uptake of adenosine. 15% HA:85% Î²-TCP scaffolds were designed using Robocad software, fabricated using a 3-D Robocasting system, and sintered at 1100Â°C for 4h. Scaffolds were coated with BMP-2 (200ng/ml), Dypiridamole 100ÂµM or saline and implanted in C57B6 and adenosine A2A receptor knockout (A2AKO) mice with 3mm cranial critical bone defects for 2-8 weeks. Dipyridamole release from scaffold was assayed spectrophotometrically. MicroCT and histological analysis were performed. micro-computed tomography (microCT) showed significant bone formation and remodeling in HA/Î²-TCP- dipyridamole and HA/Î²-TCP -BMP-2 scaffolds when compared to scaffolds immersed in vehicle at 2, 4 and 8 weeks (n=5 per group; pâ¤ 0.05, pâ¤ 0.05 and pâ¤ 0.01, respectively). Histological analysis showed increased bone formation and a trend toward increased remodeling in HA/Î²-TCP- dipyridamole and HA/Î²-TCP-BMP-2 scaffolds. coating scaffolds with dipyridamole did not enhance bone regeneration in A2AKO mice. In conclusion, scaffolds printed with HA/Î²-TCP promote bone regeneration in critical bone defects and coating these scaffolds with agents that stimulate A2A receptors and growth factors can further enhance bone regeneration. These coated scaffolds may be very useful for treating critical bone defects due to trauma, infection or other causes.

We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of intensive antiplatelet therapy (combined aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole) with that of guideline-based antiplatelet therapy. We did an international, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial in adult participants with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within 48 h of onset. Participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio using computer randomisation to receive loading doses and then 30 days of intensive antiplatelet therapy (combined aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily) or guideline-based therapy (comprising either clopidogrel alone or combined aspirin and dipyridamole). Randomisation was stratified by country and index event, and minimised with prognostic baseline factors, medication use, time to randomisation, stroke-related factors, and thrombolysis. The ordinal primary outcome was the combined incidence and severity of any recurrent stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic; assessed using the modified Rankin Scale) or TIA within 90 days, as assessed by central telephone follow-up with masking to treatment assignment, and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN47823388. 3096 participants (1556 in the intensive antiplatelet therapy group, 1540 in the guideline antiplatelet therapy group) were recruited from 106 hospitals in four countries between April 7, 2009, and March 18, 2016. The trial was stopped early on the recommendation of the data monitoring committee. The incidence and severity of recurrent stroke or TIA did not differ between intensive and guideline therapy (93 [6%] participants vs 105 [7%]; adjusted common odds ratio [cOR] 0Â·90, 95% CI 0Â·67-1Â·20, p=0Â·47).

Characterization of ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-insensitive Li+ transport. Effects of bicarbonate and dipyridamole.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuhm, J; Becker, B F\n\n1977-01-17\n\nIn studies on Li+ net-transport across the human red cell membrane following results were obtained: 1. In K+- and Na+-free choline chloride media, Li+ is transported into the erythrocytes against an electrochemical gradient. This Li+ uphill transport as well as Li+ downhill transport into the cells is inhibited by ouabain, ATP-depletion, and by external K+ and Na+. The effects of K+ and Na+ are relieved at high Li+ concentrations. 2. Ouabain-sensitive Li+ uptake, determined at 10 mM external Na+, does not obey simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and exhibits a maximum at about pH 7. 3. Ouabain-resistant Li+ downhill transport into erythrocytes increases with rising pH. It is comprised of a saturating component and a component linearly dependent on external Li+. The linear component is partly inhibited by dipyridamole and accelerated by bicarbonate. The bicarbonate effect can be completely blocked by dipyridamole, phlorizin and phenylbutazone. 4. Li+ release is not inhibited by ouabain, ATP-depletion and external K+. It increases with external Na+ concentration, tending to saturate at 150 mM Na+. Na+-independent Li+ release is stimulated by bicarbonate. It is concluded that ouabain-sensitive Li+ uptake is mediated at the K+-site(s) of the Na+-K+ pump. Li+, K+ and Na+ appear to compete for a common site (or sites). The stimulation of Li+ transfer by bicarbonate and the inhibition by dipyridamole suggest a participation of anionic species in ouabain-resistant Li+ transfer. The Na+-dependent Li+ release and the \"saturating component\" of Li+ uptake are ascribed to the Na+-dependent Li+ countertransport system.\n\nAspirin plus dipyridamole has the highest surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) values in terms of mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, and adverse event rate among 7 drug therapies in the treatment of cerebral infarction.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Jian-Jun; Liu, Xin\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe standardization for the clinical use of drug therapy for cerebral infarction (CI) has not yet determined in some aspects. In this paper, we discussed the efficacies of different drug therapies (aspirin, aspirin plus dipyridamole, aspirin plus clopidogrel, aspirin plus warfarin, cilostazol, warfarin, and ticlopidine) for CI. We searched databases of PubMed and Cochrane Library from the inception to April, 2017, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. The network meta-analysis integrated evidences of direct and indirect comparisons to assess odd ratios (OR) and surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) value. Thirteen eligible RCTs including 7 drug therapies were included into this network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis results showed that CI patients who received aspirin plus dipyridamole presented lower mortality when compared with those received aspirin plus clopidogrel (ORâ=â0.46, 95% CIâ=â0.18-0.99), indicating aspirin plus dipyridamole therapy had better efficacy for CI. As for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), stroke recurrence, and adverse event (AE) rate, there were no significant differences of efficacy among 7 drug therapies. Besides, SUCRA values demonstrated that in the 7 drug therapies, aspirin plus dipyridamole therapy was more effective than others (mortality: 80.67%; ICH: 76.6%; AE rate: 90.2%). Our findings revealed that aspirin plus dipyridamole therapy might be the optimum one for patients with CI, which could help to improve the survival of CI patients.\n\nAspirin and extended-release dipyridamole versus clopidogrel for recurrent stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nSacco, Ralph L; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Yusuf, Salim; Cotton, Daniel; Ounpuu, Stephanie; Lawton, William A; Palesch, Yuko; Martin, ReneÃ© H; Albers, Gregory W; Bath, Philip; Bornstein, Natan; Chan, Bernard P L; Chen, Sien-Tsong; Cunha, Luis; DahlÃ¶f, BjÃ¶rn; De Keyser, Jacques; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Estol, Conrado; Gorelick, Philip; Gu, Vivian; Hermansson, Karin; Hilbrich, Lutz; Kaste, Markku; Lu, Chuanzhen; Machnig, Thomas; Pais, Prem; Roberts, Robin; Skvortsova, Veronika; Teal, Philip; Toni, Danilo; Vandermaelen, Cam; Voigt, Thor; Weber, Michael; Yoon, Byung-Woo\n\n2008-09-18\n\nRecurrent stroke is a frequent, disabling event after ischemic stroke. This study compared the efficacy and safety of two antiplatelet regimens--aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (ASA-ERDP) versus clopidogrel. In this double-blind, 2-by-2 factorial trial, we randomly assigned patients to receive 25 mg of aspirin plus 200 mg of extended-release dipyridamole twice daily or to receive 75 mg of clopidogrel daily. The primary outcome was first recurrence of stroke. The secondary outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from vascular causes. Sequential statistical testing of noninferiority (margin of 1.075), followed by superiority testing, was planned. A total of 20,332 patients were followed for a mean of 2.5 years. Recurrent stroke occurred in 916 patients (9.0%) receiving ASA-ERDP and in 898 patients (8.8%) receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.11). The secondary outcome occurred in 1333 patients (13.1%) in each group (hazard ratio for ASA-ERDP, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.07). There were more major hemorrhagic events among ASA-ERDP recipients (419 [4.1%]) than among clopidogrel recipients (365 [3.6%]) (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.32), including intracranial hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.83). The net risk of recurrent stroke or major hemorrhagic event was similar in the two groups (1194 ASA-ERDP recipients [11.7%], vs. 1156 clopidogrel recipients [11.4%]; hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.11). The trial did not meet the predefined criteria for noninferiority but showed similar rates of recurrent stroke with ASA-ERDP and with clopidogrel. There is no evidence that either of the two treatments was superior to the other in the prevention of recurrent stroke.

The aim of this study was to develop potent antibody-based antiricin antidotes. Four strong ricin resistant hybridoma clones secreting antiricin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were developed. All four mAbs are bound to conformational epitopes of ricin toxin B (RTB) with high affinity (K D values from 2.55 to 36.27ânM). RTB not only triggers cellular uptake of ricin, but also facilitates transport of the ricin toxin A (RTA) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, where RTA exerts its toxic activity. The four mAbs were found to have potent ricin-neutralizing capacities and synergistic effects among them as determined by an in vitro neutralization assay. In vivo protection assay demonstrated that all four mAbs had strong efficacy against ricin challenges. D9 was found to be exceptionally effective. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of D9, at a dose of 5âÎ¼g, 6 weeks before or 6 hours after an i.p. challenge with 5 Ã LD50 of ricin was able to protect or rescue 100% of the mice, indicating that mAb D9 is an excellent candidate to be developed as a potent antidote against ricin poisoning for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.

The residual solvents acetone and isopropyl alcohol were used in the manufacturing process of the tartaric acid-based pellets of dipyridamole modified release capsules by considering the solubility of the dipyridamole and excipients in the different manufacturing stages. The method was developed and optimized by using fused silica DB-624 (30âmâÃâ0.32âmmâÃâ1.8âÂµm) column with the flame ionization detector. The method validation was carried out with regard to the guidelines for validation of analytical procedures Q2 demanded by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). All the validation characteristics were meeting the acceptance criteria. Hence, the developed and validated method can be applied for the intended routine analysis.

Cycles were repeated every 28 days for a total of 3. Median age was 56 years (range: 40-70). All patients had a performance status 0 to 1 and a weight loss < or = 10%. Squamous-cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 19 patients; adenocarcinoma in 16, and large-cell carcinoma in 6. A total of 37 patients were fully evaluable for response, whereas 39 were assessable for toxicity. No complete responses were observed: 5 patients (14%) achieved partial response; 23 patients (62%) showed no change, and progressive disease was observed in 9 (24%). The median time to treatment failure was 4 months, whereas median survival was 8 months. The average dose intensity received at the end of the third course of therapy was 46 mg/m2/week. There were no drug-related deaths. Toxicity was mild to moderate, with a high incidence of ototoxicity (54%) and emesis (67%). In conclusion, these results failed to demonstrate any significant advantage from a high-dose CP regimen modulated by DPD in patients with advanced NSCLC.\n\nAbietane-Type Diterpenoid Amides with Highly Potent and Selective Activity against Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma cruzi.\n\nPubMed\n\nPirttimaa, Minni; Nasereddin, Abedelmajeed; Kopelyanskiy, Dmitry; Kaiser, Marcel; Yli-Kauhaluoma, Jari; Oksman-Caldentey, Kirsi-Marja; Brun, Reto; Jaffe, Charles L; Moreira, VÃ¢nia M; Alakurtti, Sami\n\n2016-02-26\n\nDehydroabietylamine (1) was used as a starting material to synthesize a small library of dehydroabietyl amides by simple and facile methods, and their activities against two disease-causing trypanosomatids, namely, Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma cruzi, were assayed. The most potent compound, 10, an amide of dehydroabietylamine and acrylic acid, was found to be highly potent against these parasites, displaying an IC50 value of 0.37 Î¼M against L. donovani axenic amastigotes and an outstanding selectivity index of 63. Moreover, compound 10 fully inhibited the growth of intracellular amastigotes in Leishmania donovani-infected human macrophages with a low IC50 value of 0.06 Î¼M. This compound was also highly effective against T. cruzi amastigotes residing in L6 cells with an IC50 value of 0.6 Î¼M and high selectivity index of 58, being 3.5 times more potent than the reference compound benznidazole. The potent activity of this compound and its relatively low cytotoxicity make it attractive for further development in pursuit of better drugs for patients suffering from leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.\n\nDiscovery of a highly potent series of TLR7 agonists.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Peter; Pryde, David C; Tran, Thien-Duc; Adam, Fiona M; Bish, Gerwyn; Calo, Frederick; Ciaramella, Guiseppe; Dixon, Rachel; Duckworth, Jonathan; Fox, David N A; Hay, Duncan A; Hitchin, James; Horscroft, Nigel; Howard, Martin; Laxton, Carl; Parkinson, Tanya; Parsons, Gemma; Proctor, Katie; Smith, Mya C; Smith, Nicholas; Thomas, Amy\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe discovery of a series of highly potent and novel TLR7 agonist interferon inducers is described. Structure-activity relationships are presented, along with pharmacokinetic studies of a lead molecule from this series of N9-pyridylmethyl-8-oxo-3-deazapurine analogues. A rationale for the very high potency observed is offered. An investigation of the clearance mechanism of this class of compounds in rat was carried out, resulting in aldehyde oxidase mediated oxidation being identified as a key component of the high clearance observed. A possible solution to this problem is discussed. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In some industrial ecosystems, such as oil reservoirs, sulfate reducing microorganisms (SRM) produce hydrogen sulfide which is toxic, explosive, and corrosive. Despite the economic cost of sulfidogenesis, there has been minimal exploration of the chemical space of possible inhibitory compounds, and very little work has quantitatively assessed the selectivity of putative souring treatments. We have developed a high-throughput screening strategy to identify potent and selective inhibitors of SRM, quantitatively ranked the selectivity and potency of hundreds of compounds and identified previously unrecognized SRM selective inhibitors and synergistic interactions between inhibitors. Zinc pyrithione is the most potent inhibitor of sulfidogenesis that we identified, and is several orders of magnitude more potent than commonly used industrial biocides. Both zinc and copper pyrithione are also moderately selective against SRM. The high-throughput (HT) approach we present can be readily adapted to target SRM in diverse environments and similar strategies could be used to quantify the potency and selectivity of inhibitors of a variety of microbial metabolisms. Our findings and approach are relevant to efforts to engineer environmental ecosystems and also to understand the role of natural gradients in shaping microbial niche space.\n\nHighly potent fibrinolytic serine protease from Streptomyces.\n\nPubMed\n\nUesugi, Yoshiko; Usuki, Hirokazu; Iwabuchi, Masaki; Hatanaka, Tadashi\n\n2011-01-05\n\nWe introduce a highly potent fibrinolytic serine protease from Streptomyces omiyaensis (SOT), which belongs to the trypsin family. The fibrinolytic activity of SOT was examined using in vitro assays and was compared with those of known fibrinolytic enzymes such as plasmin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase, and nattokinase. Compared to other enzymes, SOT showed remarkably higher hydrolytic activity toward mimic peptides of fibrin and plasminogen. The fibrinolytic activity of SOT is about 18-fold higher than that of plasmin, and is comparable to that of t-PA by fibrin plate assays. Furthermore, SOT had some plasminogen activator-like activity. Results show that SOT and nattokinase have very different fibrinolytic and fibrinogenolytic modes, engendering significant synergetic effects of SOT and nattokinase on fibrinolysis. These results suggest that SOT presents important possibilities for application in the therapy of thrombosis. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses of the composite showed that the fibers contain an organoalkoxysilane `skeleton,' 0.18 molecules/nm2 surface amino groups, and highly dispersed and uniformly distributed silver nanoparticles (5 nm in size). Incorporation of organoalkoxysilanes is highly beneficial to the antimicrobial mat as (1) amino groups of APTMS are adhesive and biocidal to microorganisms, (2) polycondensation of APTMS and TEOS increases the membrane's surface area by forming silicon bonds that stabilize fibers and form a composite mat with membranous structure and high porosity, and (3) the organoalkoxysilanes are also instrumental to the synthesis of the very small-sized and highly dispersed silver metal particles in the fiber mat. Antimicrobial property of the composite was evaluated by disk diffusion, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), kinetic, and extended use assays on bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Brucella suis), a fungus (Aspergillus niger), and the Newcastle disease virus. The membrane shows quick and sustained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Only 0.3 mg of fibers is required to achieve MIC against all the test organisms. Bacteria are inhibited within 30 min of contact, and the fibers can be used repeatedly. The composite is silver efficient and environment friendly, and its membranous structure is suitable for many practical applications as in air filters, antimicrobial linen, coatings, bioadhesives, and biofilms.\n\nHighly potent non-peptidic inhibitors of the HCV NS3/NS4A serine protease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSperandio, David; Gangloff, Anthony R; Litvak, Joane; Goldsmith, Richard; Hataye, Jason M; Wang, Vivian R; Shelton, Emma J; Elrod, Kyle; Janc, James W; Clark, James M; Rice, Ken; Weinheimer, Steve; Yeung, Kap-Sun; Meanwell, Nicholas A; Hernandez, Dennis; Staab, Andrew J; Venables, Brian L; Spencer, Jeffrey R\n\n2002-11-04\n\nScreening of a diverse set of bisbenzimidazoles for inhibition of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) serine protease NS3/NS4A led to the identification of a potent Zn(2+)-dependent inhibitor (1). Optimization of this screening hit afforded a 10-fold more potent inhibitor (46) under Zn(2+) conditions (K(i)=27nM). This compound (46) binds also to NS3/NS4A in a Zn(2+) independent fashion (K(i)=1microM). The SAR of this class of compounds under Zn(2+) conditions is highly divergent compared to the SAR in the absence of Zn(2+), suggesting two distinct binding modes.\n\nPharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging with the potent and selective A(2A) adenosine receptor agonists ATL193 and ATL146e administered by either intravenous infusion or bolus injection.\n\nPubMed\n\nGlover, D K; Ruiz, M; Takehana, K; Petruzella, F D; Riou, L M; Rieger, J M; Macdonald, T L; Watson, D D; Linden, J; Beller, G A\n\n2001-09-04\n\nAdenosine (Ado) and dipyridamole are alternatives to exercise stress for myocardial perfusion imaging. Though generally safe, side effects frequently occur that cause patient discomfort and sometimes lead to premature termination of the study or require aminophylline administration. Recently, a new class of A(2A) Ado receptor agonists was synthesized. ATL193 and ATL146e are 2-propynylcyclohexyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido derivatives of Ado. The study goals were to evaluate the potency and selectivity of these new compounds on recombinant canine Ado receptors and to evaluate their hemodynamic properties in dogs to assess their usefulness as vasodilators for myocardial perfusion imaging. In assays of recombinant canine Ado receptors, ATL-193 and ATL-146e were highly selective for the A(2A) over the A(1) and A(3) receptors and were more potent than MRE-0470 and CGS-21680. In 16 anesthetized dogs, the agonists were administered by infusion (ATL-193; n=7 normal) or bolus injection (ATL-146e; n=9 critical left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis), and hemodynamic responses were compared with those of Ado. Both agonists produced dose-dependent coronary flow (CF) elevation without provoking the hypotension observed with Ado. After an ATL-146e bolus, the CF increase was sustained for several minutes, providing ample time for injection and myocardial uptake of (99m)Tc-sestamibi, and CF returned to baseline within 20 minutes. The CF increase was completely blocked by the selective A(2A) antagonist ZM241385 (3 microgram. kg(-1). min(-1)). ATL-193 and ATL-146e are highly potent and selective Ado A(2A) receptor agonists with excellent potential for use as vasodilators for myocardial perfusion imaging. An important advantage of ATL-146e is the ability to administer it by bolus injection.\n\nMulti-Layer Identification of Highly-Potent ABCA1 Up-Regulators Targeting LXRÎ² Using Multiple QSAR Modeling, Structural Similarity Analysis, and Molecular Docking.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Meimei; Yang, Fafu; Kang, Jie; Yang, Xuemei; Lai, Xinmei; Gao, Yuxing\n\n2016-11-29\n\nIn this study, in silico approaches, including multiple QSAR modeling, structural similarity analysis, and molecular docking, were applied to develop QSAR classification models as a fast screening tool for identifying highly-potent ABCA1 up-regulators targeting LXRÎ² based on a series of new flavonoids. Initially, four modeling approaches, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, radial basis function neural network, and classification and regression trees, were applied to construct different QSAR classification models. The statistics results indicated that these four kinds of QSAR models were powerful tools for screening highly potent ABCA1 up-regulators. Then, a consensus QSAR model was developed by combining the predictions from these four models. To discover new ABCA1 up-regulators at maximum accuracy, the compounds in the ZINC database that fulfilled the requirement of structural similarity of 0.7 compared to known potent ABCA1 up-regulator were subjected to the consensus QSAR model, which led to the discovery of 50 compounds. Finally, they were docked into the LXRÎ² binding site to understand their role in up-regulating ABCA1 expression. The excellent binding modes and docking scores of 10 hit compounds suggested they were highly-potent ABCA1 up-regulators targeting LXRÎ². Overall, this study provided an effective strategy to discover highly potent ABCA1 up-regulators.\n\nThe impact of supersaturation level for oral absorption of BCS class IIb drugs, dipyridamole and ketoconazole, using in vivo predictive dissolution system: Gastrointestinal Simulator (GIS).\n\nPubMed\n\nTsume, Yasuhiro; Matsui, Kazuki; Searls, Amanda L; Takeuchi, Susumu; Amidon, Gregory E; Sun, Duxin; Amidon, Gordon L\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe development of formulations and the assessment of oral drug absorption for Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class IIb drugs is often a difficult issue due to the potential for supersaturation and precipitation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The physiological environment in the GI tract largely influences in vivo drug dissolution rates of those drugs. Thus, those physiological factors should be incorporated into the in vitro system to better assess in vivo performance of BCS class IIb drugs. In order to predict oral bioperformance, an in vitro dissolution system with multiple compartments incorporating physiologically relevant factors would be expected to more accurately predict in vivo phenomena than a one-compartment dissolution system like USP Apparatus 2 because, for example, the pH change occurring in the human GI tract can be better replicated in a multi-compartmental platform. The Gastrointestinal Simulator (GIS) consists of three compartments, the gastric, duodenal and jejunal chambers, and is a practical in vitro dissolution apparatus to predict in vivo dissolution for oral dosage forms. This system can demonstrate supersaturation and precipitation and, therefore, has the potential to predict in vivo bioperformance of oral dosage forms where this phenomenon may occur. In this report, in vitro studies were performed with dipyridamole and ketoconazole to evaluate the precipitation rates and the relationship between the supersaturation levels and oral absorption of BCS class II weak base drugs. To evaluate the impact of observed supersaturation levels on oral absorption, a study utilizing the GIS in combination with mouse intestinal infusion was conducted. Supersaturation levels observed in the GIS enhanced dipyridamole and ketoconazole absorption in mouse, and a good correlation between their supersaturation levels and their concentration in plasma was observed. The GIS, therefore, appears to represent in vivo dissolution phenomena and\n\nMilk caseins as useful vehicle for delivery of dipyridamole drug.\n\nPubMed\n\nDezhampanah, Hamid; Esmaili, Masoomeh; Hasani, Leila\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe interaction of bovine milk Î±- and Î²-caseins as an efficient drug carrier system with Dipyridamole (DIP) was investigated using spectroscopy and molecular docking studies at different temperatures (20-37 Â°C). FTIR, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopy methods demonstrated that Î±- and Î²-caseins interact with DIP molecule mainly via hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions and change in secondary structure of Î±- and Î²-caseins. DIP showed a higher quenching efficiency and binding constant of Î±-casein than Î²-casein. There was only one binding site for DIP and it was located on the surface of the protein molecule. The thermodynamic parameters of calculation showed that the binding process occurs spontaneously and demonstrated that Î±- and Î²-caseins provide very good binding and entrapment to DIP via hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, and docking study showed that DIP binds to the Trp residues of Î±- and Î²-casein molecules with short distances. Docking study showed that DIP molecule made several hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with Î±- and Î²-caseins. The study of cell culture and micellar solubility of DIP demonstrated Î±- and Î²-caseins relatively the same helping in delivery of DIP. Milk Î±- and Î²-caseins are considered as a useful vehicle for the solublization and stabilization of DIP in aqueous solution at natural pH.\n\nThe pharmacological profile of CGP 28238, a novel highly potent anti-inflammatory compound.\n\nPubMed\n\nWiesenberg-Boettcher, I; Schweizer, A; Green, J R; Mueller, K; Maerki, F; Pfeilschifter, J\n\n1989-01-01\n\nCGP 28238 (6-(2,4-difluorophenoxy)-5-methylsulfonylamino-1-indanone ) exhibits very potent anti-inflammatory activity in rat adjuvant arthritis (ED40 = 0.05 mg/kg, p.o.) and pronounced analgesic and antipyretic activity in acute models in mice and rats (ED50 2-5 mg/kg, p.o.), but has clear advantages over reference NSAIDs with respect to gastro-intestinal tolerability. Threshold doses for gastro-intestinal ulcerogenicity in rats after single and repeated (10x) doses were found to be 30 mg/kg, p.o., and prostaglandin (PGE2) production in rat gastric and ileal mucosa was only marginally inhibited (ED50 greater than 30 mg/kg, p.o.). On the other hand, PGE2 production in rat inflammatory exudate and thromboxane synthesis in rat blood were inhibited with ED50 values of less than or equal to 2 mg/kg, p.o. Although CGP28238 does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in bovine seminal vesicle microsomal preparations (IC50 greater than 10(-3) mol/l), potent inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis was shown in various in vitro systems using human and animal cells with IC50 values of less than 10(-6) mol/l. IL-1-stimulated bone resorption and PGE2 production in murine calvarial cultures were inhibited with IC50 values of 3 x 10(-7) and 2 x 10(-8) mol/l, respectively. 5-Lipoxygenase (murine macrophages), phospholipase A2 (human PMN) and phospholipase C (human platelets) were not inhibited. CGP 28238 may represent a novel highly potent anti-inflammatory compound with improved gastro-intestinal safety.\n\nComparison of the myocardial blood flow response to regadenoson and dipyridamole: a quantitative analysis in patients referred for clinical 82Rb myocardial perfusion PET.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoudarzi, Behnaz; Fukushima, Kenji; Bravo, Paco; Merrill, Jennifer; Bengel, Frank M\n\n2011-10-01\n\nRegadenoson is a novel selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist, which is administered as an intravenous bolus at a fixed dose. It is currently not clear if the absolute flow increase in response to this fixed dose is a function of distribution volume in individual patients or if it is generally comparable to the previous standard agents dipyridamole or adenosine, which are dosed based on weight. We used quantitative analysis of clinical 82Rb PET/CT studies to obtain further insights. A total of 104 subjects with normal clinical rest/stress 82Rb perfusion PET/CT were included in a retrospective analysis. To rule out confounding factors, none had evidence of prior cardiac disease, ischaemia or infarction, cardiomyopathy, diabetes with insulin use, calcium score>400, renal disease or other significant systemic disease. A group of 52 patients stressed with regadenoson were compared with a group of 52 patients stressed with dipyridamole before regadenoson became available. The groups were matched for clinical characteristics, risk factors and baseline haemodynamics. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) were quantified using a previously validated retention model, after resampling of dynamic studies from list-mode 82Rb datasets. At rest, heart rate, blood pressure and MBF were comparable between the groups. Regadenoson resulted in a significantly higher heart rate (34Â±14 vs. 23Â±10 beats per minute increase from baseline; p<0.01) and rate-pressure product. Patients in the regadenoson group reported less severe symptoms and required less aminophylline. Stress MBF and MFR were not different between the groups (2.2Â±0.6 vs. 2.1Â±0.6 ml/min/g, p=0.39, and 2.9Â±0.8 vs. 2.8Â±0.7, p=0.31, respectively). In the regadenoson group, there was no correlation between stress flow or MFR and body weight or BMI. Despite its administration at a fixed dose, regadenoson results in an absolute increase in MBF which is comparable to that following dipyridamole\n\nTricyclic Compounds Containing Non-enolizable Cyano Enones. A Novel Class of Highly Potent Anti-inflammatory and Cytoprotective Agents=\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHonda, Tadashi; Yoshizawa, Hidenori; Sundararajan, Chitra; David, Emilie; Lajoie, Marc J.; Favaloro, Frank G.; Janosik, Tomasz; Su, Xiaobo; Honda, Yukiko; Roebuck, Bill D.; Gribble, Gordon W.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nForty-four novel tricycles containing non-enolizable cyano enones (TCEs) were designed and synthesized on the basis of a semisynthetic pentacyclic triterpenoid, bardoxolone methyl, which is currently being developed in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of severe chronic kidney disease in diabetic patients. Most of the TCEs having two different kinds of non-enolizable cyano enones in rings A and C are highly potent suppressors of induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase stimulated with interferon-Î³, and highly potent inducers of the cytoprotective enzymes heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1. Among these compounds, (Â±)-(4bS,8aR,10aS)-10a-ethynyl-4b,8,8-trimethyl-3,7-dioxo-3,4b,7,8,8a,9,10,10a-octahydrophenanthrene-2,6-dicarbonitrile ((Â±)-31) is the most potent in these bioassays in our pool of drug candidates including semisynthetic triterpenoids and synthetic tricycles. These facts strongly suggest that an essential factor for potency is not a triterpenoid skeleton, but the cyano enone functionality. Notably, TCE 31 reduces hepatic tumorigenesis induced with aflatoxin in rats. Further preclinical studies and detailed mechanism studies on 31 are in progress.

The aggregation behavior of the prepared block copolymers was investigated by dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements at 25 degrees C in aqueous solutions of different pH values. The hydrophobic drug dipyridamole was efficiently incorporated into the copolymer aggregates in aqueous solutions of pH 7.40. High partition coefficient values were determined by fluorescence spectroscopy.\n\nDiscovery of potent KIFC1 inhibitors using a method of integrated high-throughput synthesis and screening.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Bin; Lamb, Michelle L; Zhang, Tao; Hennessy, Edward J; Grewal, Gurmit; Sha, Li; Zambrowski, Mark; Block, Michael H; Dowling, James E; Su, Nancy; Wu, Jiaquan; Deegan, Tracy; Mikule, Keith; Wang, Wenxian; Kaspera, RÃ¼diger; Chuaqui, Claudio; Chen, Huawei\n\n2014-12-11\n\nKIFC1 (HSET), a member of the kinesin-14 family of motor proteins, plays an essential role in centrosomal bundling in cancer cells, but its function is not required for normal diploid cell division. To explore the potential of KIFC1 as a therapeutic target for human cancers, a series of potent KIFC1 inhibitors featuring a phenylalanine scaffold was developed from hits identified through high-throughput screening (HTS). Optimization of the initial hits combined both design-synthesis-test cycles and an integrated high-throughput synthesis and biochemical screening method. An important aspect of this integrated method was the utilization of DMSO stock solutions of compounds registered in the corporate compound collection as synthetic reactants. Using this method, over 1500 compounds selected for structural diversity were quickly assembled in assay-ready 384-well plates and were directly tested after the necessary dilutions. Our efforts led to the discovery of a potent KIFC1 inhibitor, AZ82, which demonstrated the desired centrosome declustering mode of action in cell studies.\n\nA Potent and Highly Efficacious Bcl-2/Bcl-xL Inhibitor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMcEachern, Donna; Yang, Chao-Yie; Meagher, Jennifer; Stuckey, Jeanne; Wang, Shaomeng\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOur previously reported Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, 4, effectively inhibited tumor growth but failed to achieve complete regression in vivo. We have now performed extensive modifications on its pyrrole core structure, which has culminated in the discovery of 32 (BM-1074). Compound 32 binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins with Ki values of < 1 nM and inhibits cancer cell growth with IC50 values of 1-2 nM in four small-cell lung cancer cell lines sensitive to potent and specific Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors. Compound 32 is capable of achieving rapid, complete and durable tumor regression in vivo at a well-tolerated dose-schedule. Compound 32 is the most potent and efficacious Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor reported to date.

Currently, the most promising therapy is based on neutralizing antibodies elicited by active vaccination or given passively. Here, detailed protocols are provided for the production of two ricin holotoxin-based vaccines: monomerized subunit-based vaccine, and a formaldehyde-based ricin toxoid vaccine. Both vaccines were found to be stable with no toxic activity reversion even after long-term storage while eliciting high anti-ricin antibody titers possessing a potent neutralizing activity. The use of these vaccines is highly suitable for both the production of sera that can be used in passive protection experiments and immunization aimed to isolate potent anti-ricin monoclonal antibodies.\n\nPharmacological profile of CS-3150, a novel, highly potent and selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.\n\nPubMed\n\nArai, Kiyoshi; Homma, Tsuyoshi; Morikawa, Yuka; Ubukata, Naoko; Tsuruoka, Hiyoyuki; Aoki, Kazumasa; Ishikawa, Hirokazu; Mizuno, Makoto; Sada, Toshio\n\n2015-08-15\n\nThe present study was designed to characterize the pharmacological profile of CS-3150, a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In the radioligand-binding assay, CS-3150 inhibited (3)H-aldosterone binding to mineralocorticoid receptor with an IC50 value of 9.4nM, and its potency was superior to that of spironolactone and eplerenone, whose IC50s were 36 and 713nM, respectively. CS-3150 also showed at least 1000-fold higher selectivity for mineralocorticoid receptor over other steroid hormone receptors, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor. In the reporter gene assay, CS-3150 inhibited aldosterone-induced transcriptional activation of human mineralocorticoid receptor with an IC50 value of 3.7nM, and its potency was superior to that of spironolactone and eplerenone, whose IC50s were 66 and 970nM, respectively. CS-3150 had no agonistic effect on mineralocorticoid receptor and did not show any antagonistic or agonistic effect on glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor even at the high concentration of 5Î¼M. In adrenalectomized rats, single oral administration of CS-3150 suppressed aldosterone-induced decrease in urinary Na(+)/K(+) ratio, an index of in vivo mineralocorticoid receptor activation, and this suppressive effect was more potent and longer-lasting than that of spironolactone and eplerenone. Chronic treatment with CS-3150 inhibited blood pressure elevation induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt-loading to rats, and this antihypertensive effect was more potent than that of spironolactone and eplerenone. These findings indicate that CS-3150 is a selective and highly potent mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with long-lasting oral activity. This agent could be useful for the treatment of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disorders. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Research suggests that aspects of creative performance might be improved when intoxicated with cannabis; however, the evidence is not conclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of cannabis on creativity. We examined the effects of administering a low (5.5 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) or high (22 mg THC) dose of vaporized cannabis vs. placebo on creativity tasks tapping into divergent (Alternate Uses Task) and convergent (Remote Associates Task) thinking, in a population of regular cannabis users. The study used a randomized, double-blind, between-groups design. Participants in the high-dose group (nâ=â18) displayed significantly worse performance on the divergent thinking task, compared to individuals in both the low-dose (nâ=â18) and placebo (nâ=â18) groups. The findings suggest that cannabis with low potency does not have any impact on creativity, while highly potent cannabis actually impairs divergent thinking.\n\nPotent D-peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 entry\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWelch, Brett D.; VanDemark, Andrew P.; Heroux, Annie; Hill, Christopher P.; Kay, Michael S.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nDuring HIV-1 entry, the highly conserved gp41 N-trimer pocket region becomes transiently exposed and vulnerable to inhibition. Using mirror-image phage display and structure-assisted design, we have discovered protease-resistant D-amino acid peptides (D-peptides) that bind the N-trimer pocket with high affinity and potently inhibit viral entry. We also report high-resolution crystal structures of two of these D-peptides in complex with a pocket mimic that suggest sources of their high potency. A trimeric version of one of these peptides is the most potent pocket-specific entry inhibitor yet reported by three orders of magnitude (IC50 = 250 pM). These results are the first demonstration that D-peptides can form specific and high-affinity interactions with natural protein targets and strengthen their promise as therapeutic agents. The D-peptides described here address limitations associated with current L-peptide entry inhibitors and are promising leads for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.

IAS derivatives are endowed with inhibitory activities against wt HIV-1 in the low nanomolar concentration range. Introduction of two methyl groups at positions 3 and 5 of the phenyl ring of the aryl sulfonyl moiety furnished IAS derivatives such as 5-chloro- or 5-bromo-3-[(3,5-dimethylphenyl)sulfonyl]indole-2-carboxyamide, which showed very potent and selective anti-HIV-1 activity against some mutants carrying NNRTI resistant mutations at positions 103 and 181 of the reverse transcriptase. IAS derivatives bearing 2-hydroxyethylcarboxyamide or 2-hydroxyethylcarboxyhydrazide groups at position 2 of the indole nucleus were more active than L-737,126 against the K103N-Y181C double mutant. A great improvement of antiviral activity against wt HIV-1 and resistant mutants was obtained by coupling 1-3 simple amino acids, such as glycine and alanine, in sequence, with the 3-[(3,5-dimethylphenyl)sulfonyl]-1H-indole-2-carbonyl moiety. The transformation of the chain terminus into amide or hydrazide, produced short peptides with high selectivity and potent activity against wt HIV-1, and the viral mutants Y181C, K103N-Y181C and EFV(R). IAS having two halogen atoms at the indole showed potent inhibitory activity against the Y181C and the EFV(R) resistant mutant strains. In particular, the introduction of a fluori"
