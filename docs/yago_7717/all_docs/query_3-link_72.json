        "text": "COURTESY\n\nNEWPORT — Daniel Paul Heroux, 61, passed away on May 12, 2019, at Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center, after a short and courageous battle with cancer. Dan was born on Jan. 18, 1958, in Nashua, to Paul Heroux and Cecile (Lemay) Riley. He grew up in Hudson and lived in the Newport area for more than 30 years. He served his country in the U.S. Army from 1975-1978. While in Germany, he spent his free time rebuilding a World War II tank. He was a kind, sweet and caring man who loved spending time with his grandkids and family, as well as playing cards with his mother. He enjoyed traveling, was a lucky gambler, and tinkered with anything he could find. Dan was great with his hands and could fix just about anything; if he couldn’t fix it, it was definitely broken. He worked as a heavy-duty truck technician for Carroll Concrete and S.G. Reed Truck Services.\n\nSurviving family include his daughter Alison Shepardson and husband Ray of Newport; grandchildren, Nickolaus and Morgan Shepardson; lifelong partner and best friend Susan Wells; his parents; sisters, Janet Dow and husband Lenny of Newport, Madeline Burns and husband Dennis of Hudson, and Denise Burns and husband Alan of Merrimack; and many friends and extended family.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Dan’s name may be made to the Scholarship Program at Newport Recreation, 65 Belknap Ave., Newport, NH 03773; or to Sullivan County Humane Society, P.O. Box 11, Claremont, NH 03743. A funeral Mass will be celebrated on Friday, May 17, 2019, at 11 a.m. at St. Patrick Catholic Church, 32 Beech St. in Newport, with celebration of life immediately following.
