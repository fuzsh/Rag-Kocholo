        "text": "Borderline Extreme Movies\n\nA PI is hired by a mysterious character to track down someone who disappeared. This person, he's told, is needed to 'settle a debt'. Strange murderous events seem to follow every lead and things get darker and more violent with each development until everything dives into the supernatural world and stays there. Voodoo craft and devilish work is at hand, leading man to murder, incest and other violent deeds. Very gritty, stylish and dark with a dark sweaty texture that you can feel, and bizarre atmospheric sequences that all make sense at the end. Brilliant.\n\nAn intelligent satire on writing screenplays, pitting inspired work against Hollywood cookie-cutter and commercial pressures. The uptight, tormented Barton is whisked away to Hollywood to write a pointless b-movie after his plays become a success, and he finds himself in a surreal hell that becomes more and more literal. Small touches such as heat, peeling wallpaper, pus and flames are turned into a full-blown surreal vision in a climactic ending, with a wonderfully enigmatic epilogue that teases with themes of beheaded muses, hell, the devil taking over, and living in a beautifully superficial but enslaving postcard world. One of the Coen Brothers' early masterpieces, and definitely their most bizarre movie.\n\nBeasts of the Southern Wild\n\nA truly magical movie that deserved its hype. This tells the tale of a strong-willed little girl and her strict father that live in a poor bayou community in the American South called the Bathtub. They live behind the levees and are in constant fear of flooding, but are very attached to their homes and lifestyle. Her father contracts an unknown disease, adding to the fears, but the people are well trained in the practice of toughing it out and ignoring bad news. The movie is not only seen through her eyes, but also through her mind, combining gritty realism with the unexplained mysterious world of adults, and several stories or warnings become fantastical, imaginary and surreal. When she misbehaves, her fears that she may have broken the world are seen as reality, and beasts of legend turn into symbolic monsters. A trip across the waters that may or may not be real, leads her to a floating whorehouse where a woman who may or may not be her mother seems to do magical things. And so on. I am usually not a fan of movies carried by children, but this one features a very striking and unforgettable lead, and the magic revolves around her.\n\nFrench madness in the form of a black comedy. Bernie is an 'orphan' who decides to leave his orphanage where he has worked all his life, and search for his parents. Trouble is, he is also a paranoid and violent-prone idiot several levels removed from reality. Amongst the things he discovers is that he was thrown into a garbage can as a baby through a garbage chute, but this is obviously the fault of 'them' and not his loving parents. His father turns out to be a psychotic sodomizer bum, and his mom has succeeded in building a respectable life, or has she? He also encounters a drug-addict, money-loving bitch whom he pays to be his girlfriend, and her sleazy wheelchair-ridden father. Sparks fly, madness and violence goes rampant, and the movie is full of one shocking, blackly comic and colorful surprise after another. A bit too full of wackos for my taste, but undeniably entertaining if you don't mind trashy over-the-top madness. Compared sometimes to Pulp Fiction for ambiguous reasons but this doesn't have that movie's sense of reality nor its inventive structure. This is more like a nasty cartoon. Some of Dupontel's subsequent comedies are similar but less nasty and insane.\n\nI suppose it's popular to compare anything slightly weird to Lynch nowadays, but the only movie Buddy Boy compares to is The Tenant. But whereas The Tenant was fatally flawed by Polanski's acting and unbelievable madness, this one is more subtle. A stuttering, shy and guilt-ridden Catholic man lives with his weird step-mother in a filthy apartment, peeping on his sexy, Vegan neighbour and then developing a relationship with her. He keeps watching and discovers his neighbour's dark secrets...or so it seems. Guilt and a fear of hypocrisies lead him to doubt his neighbour's Vegan and loving 'religions' until he, and we, can't tell what is real anymore. A flawed, well-crafted masterpiece with a pointless bizarre and twisted sub-plot involving his step-mother. It also boasts a very exquisitely intriguing ending.\n\nCalvaire (AKA The Ordeal)\n\nA flawed but fascinating entry in the backwoods horror genre from Belgium, mixing Straw Dogs and Deliverance with great camera-work. The original title also translates to Martyrdom as well as Ordeal which is much more interesting. A corny performer of love songs is hounded and desired by old women, but this is nothing compared to the fans of his romantic talents in the local backwoods village populated entirely by insane, inbred, desperate lonely men (and no women). This desperation soon leads to crucifixion, rape and other acts of violence (although the director cuts away from the shock and gore, sometimes too much in fact). The lead actor is somewhat weak and the idea of artists and romantics as martyrs for sad, lonely people isn't explored to complete satisfaction, but the last half hour makes up for this with several scenes of gripping madness, brilliant black comedy and atmosphere. Contains several demented scenes that rival Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its backwoods insanity.\n\nFrench dystopian sci-fi, where the sci-fi is all in the behaviour, resulting in surrealism. Although reminiscent of movies like THX 1138, Brazil and Zero Theorem with their themes of an individual desperately looking for humanity in a dehumanized world, the look of this movie is strictly contemporary, employing cold office-space and urbanism. In this alternate modern world, big brother is always on ubiquitous speakers instructing people on safety, encouraging them to procreate from a very early age, and suggesting they grow to love the game of croquet. The game, in this case, being a symbol for the larger theme of the movie of dehumanizing, alienating and sadistic social behaviour. Violence breaks out and crowds turn away politely, men die or kill themselves in the millions, and loyalty to authority masks cruelty, or, alternately, soulless masochism and suicidal tendencies. And it is up to the protagonist to separate these two types of citizens using absurdly cruel but simple tests at his office. Humans submit to these tests to prove their loyalty, and the tests are designed to identify the people that actively think, but either way they end up soulless. The movies explores this character, whose soul is being torn apart between his mother on one end who committed suicide in order to harden him into becoming socially 'normal', and his wife who saw humanity in him once a long time ago. A quiet movie with a deceptively simple story that grows on you.\n\nThis one is here purely for its incredibly effective and disturbing horror. Well written, well acted, superbly directed horror with tension and psychologically terrifying developments that just keep building slowly to a crescendo. You may be thinking that a horror movie about killer children has been done lots of times before, not always successfully, except that this one really hits you in the gut. It feeds off several fears: The chaos of misbehaving children doing dangerous things somehow gone very wrong thanks to an unknown disease, the terror of not being able to defend yourself properly when faced with a toddler, especially if you are the parent of this toddler, and the inability to believe that a toddler could be a culprit of senseless violence, leading to wild reactions and accusations between adults, and the inability to handle such a situation. The story is simple: Two sisters and their families meet in a remote location for some family fun, when a virus strikes. I can imagine the average young horror fan will not understand what all the fuss is about, especially since it isn't all that gory, but I can also imagine parents not being able to watch much of this. I see this as the toddler version of the intense Eden Lake, except that it is forced by necessity to use a virus to explain the behaviour and make it realistic. A masterwork in horror construction that feeds off basic human fears, with superb editing that knows exactly when to cut and splice to build up the horror that spirals rapidly out of control.\n\nA very effective study on schizophrenia posing as a serial killer movie. The mental state, fears and nerves of a man just released from an asylum is portrayed grippingly by both a great performance and minimalist, inventive cinematography and sound. As he travels to see his long lost daughter, sounds in his head make him a nervous wreck, mirrors set him off on an obsessive shaving spree that causes self-mutilation, and he becomes convinced that a radio transmitter is in his head and fingernail, leading to a stomach-churning mutilation scene. In a brilliant twist, an obsessive, pedantic and neurotic policeman thinks he is a killer and tracks him down.\n\nHenry Selick delivers another animated dark work of wonder, this time based on a Neil Gaiman story, except that, this time, it betrays its juvenile origins despite its dark almost-adult-oriented content. The animation is a wonderful blend of CGI and stop-motion, lending the computer effects some tactile texture. The story, feels juvenile and simplistic, spelling things out for the audience, but the visuals are outlandish and the imagination is the real star of the show. Coraline is a bratty young girl who finds herself stuck with parents that are no fun, in an old country house that hides dark secrets and features very eccentric stage and circus neighbours. A creepy doll that looks just like her, and some mice, take her into a surreal adventure that goes beyond the twilight zone, through an Alice in Wonderland tunnel into a land that tempts her with ideal alternative parents and endless fun. The only thing that seems bothersome is that the people there have buttons for eyes. But who cares when you have gardens that come to life, mechanical huge insects, a mouse circus, canons that fire cotton candy, and dotty neighbours performing for a dog audience. It's not a weird movie due to fantasy elements, but due to its underlying psychological surrealism. Probably too scary for young children, with a dark imagination that will entertain adults, but perfect for that age in the middle. However, for a much better version of this story, see MirrorMask.\n\nCure for Wellness, A\n\nGore Verbinski's horror ode to... well, everything. The story is about a young ruthless businessman sent on a mission to retrieve a wayward CEO 'taking the waters' in a Swiss wellness center, only to find that the spa is not what it seems. But the themes, tropes, and movies that this film references would take a page to summarize. In one sense, this is Shutter Island done right with its is-he-or-isn't-he-hallucinating psychological reality-twisting plot, only with a more palatable horror denouement. But there is also a lot of Argento (especially Suspiria) and Mario Bava here, as well as some German expressionism. Visually it's amazingly rich with dozens of striking rooms, sets, locations and machinery. There's incest, doctor-horror, dentist-horror, gothic horror, possible ghosts, creature horror, etc. Themes cover several kinds of madnesses both old and new, the old corrupt aristocracy, the modern soul-sucking life, innocence, psychological wellness vs cruelty, a female coming-of-age story, personal redemption, etc. And yet, with all this, the film still coheres as long as you are willing to accept that some elements are attributable to hallucinations and you go along with its own internal Argento-esque supernatural horror logic. I was enthralled by the sights and sounds and atmosphere despite the flaws, the piling on of ideas, and the excess. Though, in fact, all of this is somehow also a boon to the movie.\n\nA post-apocalyptic, futuristic dark comedy from France with an artistic sense strongly reminiscent of Gilliam's (Brazil). Food is rationed, the economy is back to the barter system and people resort to cannibalism while vegetarians are underground revolutionaries that live in the sewers. A circus clown finds a job in a building where various psychotic and neurotic men and women dwell, and where cannibalism is a rule-based system. Visually rich and superbly hilarious. A superb precursor to City of Lost Children by the Jeunet and Caro team.\n\nKevin Smith finally achieves his potential and directs this hilariously blasphemous and rude satire/comedy about Christianity, and various priests, sinners, devils and angels. It isn't as blasphemous as it is made out to be though as the characters discuss and ramble philosophically, wipe out sinners, challenge or support God (who happens to be a Canadian rock singer), and try to get laid. Along the way we are treated to the sight of a demon made of pure excrement. Joy.\n\nA surreal doppelgänger used to explore a character's psychology is nothing new, but this movie uses it in exceptional ways. The style of the movie will also remind you of several other films, giving the movie a further flawed feel of unoriginality, but it is very fascinating, well done and watchable despite all this. The look and feel creates a dilapidated steampunk world similar to Brazil except slightly more dark and depressing, combined with some fun cheesy injections of 60s retro-color on its TV shows and commercials. Simon James is a 'non-person' who is absurdly easy to forget. He has to sign in to work as a visitor every day because the guard can never recognize him, the system seems to have it in for him, with near-conscious elevators and computers malfunctioning in his presence, and people walk all over him in so many ways it becomes absurdly depressing and blackly humorous. He also pines for the depressed girl next door. When a new employee joins his company, nobody seems to notice that they are identical, since this new guy is everything he isn't: A confident ladies man. Their lives become intertwined in ways they don't expect when they start to take over each other's lives.\n\nBenson and Moorhead have gotten a reputation for intriguingly strange and different horror movies, but this one is their most strange as well as their by far their best, and it can be enjoyed on several levels. It also expands on ideas and characters from their previous (very unsatisfying) movie 'Resolution', but that one is not required viewing before this one. I normally don't like modern horror movies that just throw a bunch of random strange visuals at the screen without any kind of coherency, but this movie has its own internal logic, even if some plot elements remain unexplained and unexplainable. It is about two brothers that have escaped a strange cult-ish group as kids, and now find themselves drawn back to them. All is not as it seems, and at the same time, things get much stranger and infinitely challenging, a horror that threatens to control their lives as well as their deaths. They encounter events and a being that could be taken as a sci-fi metaphysical super-being, a scary horror creature with mind-boggling powers, a metaphor for humanity or for existential crisis and confrontation, or as symbolism for religion, or all of the above. I found this movie unclassifiable, not being truly horror nor fantasy nor sci-fi nor reality-bending strangeness, and yet it is all of the above all at once. The characters are very well written as well, some scenes are creepy and scary in a unique way, and others are fun mind-bending sci-fi. A very good, one-of-a-kind movie.\n\nOne of the most intense and thought-provoking movies ever made. A psychologist encounters a teenager who has created his own abnormal religion of horse-worship and unbridled passion. The jaded psychologist, acted powerfully by Richard Burton, already having doubts as to his work of 'normalizing' youths, reaches an intense state of self-doubt as he both respects, fears and psychologically manipulates the sick but vibrant youth who had a bloody eruption of passionate guilt that ended in violence. An unforgettable masterpiece.\n\nFar Side of the Moon, The\n\nA magical, quiet, subtle and rich movie. This is one of those movies where the experience surpasses any attempt at description. Phillippe is a sad man who seeks out the greatness in humanity through space travel. But he is constantly bogged down by his cynicism and perception of reality, and writes a thesis on how humankind's attempts at reaching the moon were driven by narcissism. This metaphor is combined with the far side of the moon as a hidden, disfigured facet, the movie drawing parallels with this man's turmoil and troubled relationship with his gay, superficial, twin brother. All this heaviness is perfectly balanced with the humor and subtle comedy emerging from his personality, one highlight being a video he prepares to instruct aliens on the lifestyle and foibles of mankind. Another special mention must go to the highly inventive segues and superimpositions of fantasy and imagination, many of them so smooth and beautifully done, they result in surreal moments, leading to the delightfully playful ending.\n\nFausto 5.0\n\nA provocative, modernized Spanish retelling of the Faustian story that goes where Hollywood would never dare to go. An uptight doctor who treats and researches terminal patients is barely alive himself until an ex-patient of his with the uncanny ability to grant wishes and be everywhere forces himself into his life. The doctor's evil, nihilistic side starts coming out and his wishes more perverse and immoral. The movie brilliantly leaves the supernatural aspects ambiguous so that you don't know if something magical and evil is truly going on, and uses an ugly but gripping urban set design to explore the psyche of a man who has buried himself in hospital plastic and professionalism, hiding from the ugly world outside and his ugliness inside. A challenging and bold movie that will leave Hollywood fans in the dust, and a great accompaniment to Angel Heart.\n\nA dense, beautifully shot, thought-provoking, violent attack on modern society and the apathetic, lost people populating it obsessed with materialistic minutiae and enslaved by consumerism. One schizophrenic man gets caught up with a radically new attitude that starts with the anarchical release of a fist fight, which grows to a fight club and then to a full fledged revolution. A fascinating, energetic film with an almost inconceivable twisted ending that pushes the whole exercise further into dementia and anarchy. A modern classic.\n\n5150 Elm's Way\n\nNow this is more like it: A psychological and disturbing horror movie about a psycho killer and a hostage that is believable and twisted in a human way, rather than just going for shock. Yannick, a film student, finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, and soon finds himself forced to become involved with a demented religious family, trying to confront or exploit their various issues in order to escape them. The father-killer is a three-dimensional character that reminded me of old-school horror characters like the Stepfather. But there is also a believable angry teenager, submissive dependent mother, and a near-psychotic damaged little girl. The father seems to have luck or providence on his side as nothing works out for Yannick, including all attempts at escape, and his need to prove the father's self-righteousness wrong, grow to the point of obsession and madness. This brings light surrealism in the form of hallucinations, reaching a climax of deeply disturbed explosive breakdowns and a twisted game of chess in the basement. Comparisons to Mum & Dad are way off, since this is about the character arcs, warped family dynamics, obsession and psychological horror. It's more like Frailty in that sense.\n\nPsychological reality-bending using delusions and fantasy to explore several characters. The four plot threads start in puzzling ways and slowly weave together for a single ending. One storyline takes place in a fantasy dystopian world where a single atheist, bent on revenge for the death of a little girl, evades a religious ministry and a city populated by absurd religions (one worships washing-machine instructions). The rest take place in our world, one involving a young man jilted at the altar who chases his childhood love, another (Eva Green) with serious problems with her parents who creates a suicidal student-art-project, and a religious man in search of his vet son. Many clues appear in parallel stories, sometimes in puzzling ways, only to work themselves out. Even a seemingly chance encounter at the end is tied with clues dropped at the beginning of the movie that somehow both compounds the fatalistic coincidence, as well as explains their attraction. The ending is not as satisfying as it should be and the tying together of clues in several stories is not as clever as it thinks it is, but the subtle way they emerge and the development is done in very intriguing ways, making for a mentally invigorating watch (you'll need to watch at least twice), and the ambition of the movie, as well as the visual look of the fantasy world are big pluses as well, making this a keeper. Comparisons: There's a bit of Del Toro in its psychological escape to dark fantasy, a bit of Gilliam in its meshing of reality with fantasy except fantasy doesn't exactly triumph here, and it is reminiscent of Stay in how clues come together except this one doesn't use dream-logic.\n\nImmortel (ad vitam)\n\nAnother dreamy, slightly weird, stylish French sci-fi movie by Enki Bilal, a comic-book artist. Take Fifth Element with the fake-looking CGI effects of Final Fantasy, mix with a healthy dose of Blade Runner and add a splash of Manga and Stargate. In the future, a corporation called Eugenics rules New York City, performing experiments on humans, raiding the lower levels of the city for rejects and guinea pigs. A pyramid has appeared floating on top of the city and the Egyptian God Horus is out searching for a hosting body and a female to mate with. He finds a subversive human amidst the genetically altered population and a strange alien female capable of bearing his progeny. There is a lot more to the plot and many elements aren't explained fully. The city of the future is unoriginal but well done, the CGI characters however are badly done. The real actors mixed in this CGI world aren't that interesting but the overall effect of the movie is somewhat mesmerizing. Flawed but good.\n\nIn the Company of Men\n\nAlthough this is not an extreme movie per se, it packs quite an emotional wallop, provoked a controversy, and features realistic human cruelty without pulling any punches. This is an intense, disturbing and intelligent masterpiece. The movie explores two male characters as they plot to manipulate a sweet deaf girl at the office into love before pulling out the rug from under her feet. A meeker man goes along with the schemes of an alpha jerk, only to get bitten by their cruelty in some ways even worse than their intended victim. This is also a look at the theme of dehumanization in cut-throat business and the various types of characters that are swept away by it. A powerful look at male-oriented emotional cruelty in the modern world. Neil LaBute followed this with the equally bleak and disturbing 'Your Friends and Neighbors', a very sharp and dark satire on selfish and broken human behaviour with awkward moments that rival Happiness, except without that movie's extremism. The final entry in a trilogy on the theme of modern social cruelty is 'The Shape of Things'. All three are superb.\n\nJack Be Nimble\n\nGripping and unforgettable cult Australian gothic horror movie. It's the dark story of a boy and his sister, abandoned by their distraught psychic mother and philandering father. Each are adopted separately by very different families, the boy abused terribly, and growing up intensely hateful and angry. The girl develops psychic abilities, but the boy harnesses his gift in angrier ways through a bizarre machine which he builds in order get revenge. Features an unforgettable silent set of four malignant sisters, a fascinating and unusual psychic romance, hypnosis-violence, intense performances by everyone involved (especially by Alexis Arquette who is given a lot to do), and the emotions and cruelty build to a crisis, leading to a strange finale indeed. A cult favorite.\n\nA Vietnam vet starts having bizarre and disturbing hallucinations which appear to be spilling over into his reality and day-to-day life. Is he insane? Dreaming? Suffering from trauma? Military drug testing? Either way, it's a dark supernatural trip and we're invited to experience it with him. A classic amongst reality-bending horror movies.\n\nStrictly speaking, this isn't a surreal movie. And yet it is, for what could be more surreal than the possible end of the world? This is one of those movies, like Cloverfield, that you are better off watching without knowing much about it in advance. It is also a cult movie in the sense that it polarizes audiences, and you will either hate it or love it. Be warned, however, that it is a feel-bad movie, and unforgettable. The first 15 minutes make you think it is a romantic comedy with quirky characters, then it veers into 'After Hours' territory (also a great movie) with an increasingly surreal reality. The odd people and events accumulate to the point where you feel you must be dreaming. L.A., with all its quirky citizens, goes chaotic under a pending, possible apocalypse which may or may not be real. It's all very 80s, but the Tangerine Dream soundtrack is superb. Just watch it.\n\nAn underrated sleeper of a surreal fantasy and coming-of-age story by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean. Although produced by the Jim Henson Company and often compared to Labyrinth and Alice in Wonderland, this is somewhat darker and uses masses of Dali-esque CGI imagery. A teenage girl in a circus has typical bratty and escapist issues and fights with her loving mother. When her mother is hospitalized, she is disturbed by her own immaturity and struggles with her subconscious in a movie-length dream-like world of her own creation where temperamental books fly back to the library when insulted, palace guards are strange creatures on stilt-legs, there is a good queen in a coma and an evil one who is turning everything into shadows, real faces are bland or disgusting and masks are popular, and pets are scary creatures with men's faces who like riddles and eating books. Very dense with metaphors and psychological layers, and the effects feel somewhat overdone at first but are magical once you get used to them. A quiet masterpiece that grows on you extremely well in your subconscious and imagination.\n\nFrench existential provocation and drama without a solution. This is not about time-lines, alternative realities, sci-fi, dreams, or madness. It is not even a puzzle for audiences used to a narrative to try to shoehorn into some kind of logical theory. It is French existential horror that simply enjoys raising mind-warping questions without caring whether there are answers. Here is my interpretation of the movie with minimal spoilers: A man shaves off his moustache on a whim after his wife raises the question of how her perception of him would change if he did. Thus, we realize, his world and actions, just like most of ours, are dependent on other people, little things they say or do, especially when it comes to seeing things through the eyes of the ones we love. So what follows is a complete breakdown of this stability. Did he ever really have a moustache? People he knows and trusts don't seem to think so, but strangers do. They can even look at the same photographs and see different things. He considers whether it is an elaborate joke, a conspiracy, etc. but it is simply a metaphysical breakdown of his perception of reality which is too dependent on other people. So he escapes. He goes to get lost, to keep moving, to be surrounded by strangers. And when his confidence and peace of mind returns in this world full of strangers, so does reality. But does he really have his identity and confidence now?\n\nIranian-American deeply atmospheric head-trip of a horror movie that surprises with its effectiveness. You know how many horror movies use hallucinations, brief waking nightmares, disorienting confusion, and supernatural apparitions that may be there one minute and gone the next? Well this one knows how to make use of these properly, and uses it for most of its running time, eschewing jump-scares, opting for subtler dark and confusing apparitions and strange happenings that mess with your mind, layering it with psychological secrets in the protagonists, and constantly building it up with great pacing, until the final superb 20 minutes that simply runs with it to a surreal finish line. In other words, although this is just a horror movie and not surrealism, this one takes these tropes further than most, and uses them amazingly well for a change. The plot is simple: A couple with a baby on the way home from a party with friends stay in a strange hotel where nothing is as it seems, and as the dark night continues endlessly, they fall further and further down the rabbit hole. Horror-movie fans will be sure they have figured it out for much of its running time, and the plot indeed isn't trying to be too original. But what it does aim for (and succeeds at it), is to unnerve its audience and explore the psychological black hole of guilty secrets between spouses using horror and thick atmosphere as its medium. And the final 20 minutes are what elevate the movie towards this goal with a chilling final scene that stays under your skin for a while. This is one that must be watched with a big screen and big sound and no interruptions, and you will be rewarded.\n\nOne I Love, The\n\nThis is one of those movies that are almost impossible to review or summarize without spoiling plot twists, twists that start almost at the beginning of the movie. Even comparisons to other movies would spoil something. I'll just say that it involves a married couple in marriage therapy that get sent to a special retreat to try to bring the marriage back to life. Except that it comes to life in very unexpected ways. This has a Twilight Zone-esque concept behind the film which it primarily uses to explore the characters. This is very good. But it also drops hints about possible rational mechanics behind these strange goings-on which at the very least involve some sci-fi, possibly fantasy. Except it plays both sides by adding partial explanations, rules and limitations, which is confusing at first, but actually good fun. But, as I said, the focus is on people, and the actors convey a lot with subtle nuances. It's not an amazing movie, but as a small movie, there is a lot of detail here that I greatly enjoyed.\n\nQuietly absurd, slightly surreal, and magically entrancing Slovakian movie. It's a road movie full of quirky characters, but unlike any road movie you've ever seen. The protagonist is a 16 year old headstrong, slightly wild, simple-minded girl discharged from her boarding school and on a quest to return to her mother. The absurd world and characters she encounters are full of quirk, of lurking but hidden dangers, and behaviour that is so strange, it becomes absurdly surreal or even fantastical. A man's job is to burn clothes but he doesn't know why, a chairman hides from his board meeting and gives her strange advice, so does the priest at a wedding that ties together a depressed young man and an older woman with bizarre rituals, then there is the charmingly insane old woman that wants to convert part of her house into a car park while the rest of her house floats in water when it rains, and so on. When she finally reaches her destination, her goal seems a lot smaller than she hoped. The truth is, the charm of this movie is magical and indescribable. It manages to convey sadness through light cheery innocence, to distill broken people through lovably quirky humanity, to hide dangers behind a flimsy curtain of optimistic cheery innocence, and to leave you with a feeling of both bittersweet resignation and warm hope for a broken world.\n\nDelightfully inventive German reality-bending movie that takes a simple concept and adds endless creative details to it. This goes way beyond Pleasantville, depicting a bunch of characters living within the land of film, and uses it as a metaphor for social outcasts, and social classes and biases. The allegory is simple, but the world-building is rich. In this world, everyone is judged by their place in the story-line: The Main Characters have the soundtrack revolve around them and frequently break out into drama, song and dance, the Supporting Characters are secondary and have limited lines, the Cut Characters are no longer living, and the Outtakes are unfilmable, flawed characters, their flaws including jumpy badly edited movements, distorted voices, miscast people in the wrong role, censored people with pixelated mouths, etc. In this world, generated sound effects are valued highly and traded in the black market. A young girl finds that her background character is not what she thought it would be, and finds herself re-appraising the Outtakes as her dramatic music literally falls apart, and she digs deep into Gilliam-esque dystopian layers. As mentioned, the delight in this movie is the constant stream of creative details.\n\nCreepy horror movie about strange things happening to the dead at the local cemetery. Famous for its deadly flying silver balls that drill into people's brains, a Tall Man who's amputated limbs have a life of their own and eventually turn into large insects, shrunken zombies, and other bizarre elements. A very imaginative b-movie that doesn't make much sense but achieved cult status thanks to its creativity and creepy atmosphere. A memorable cult classic.\n\nPhone Box, The (La Cabina)\n\nPossibly the most classic, highly-regarded and loved cult short horror movie ever made. It's only strange in a light Bunuelian absurd way, but the tension keeps building until the unforgettable ending that packs a wallop. An ordinary man becomes trapped in an ordinary phone booth with amused reactions from various passersby. The situation becomes more ridiculous as time passes by. To say any more would be to ruin the movie. Watch it.\n\nSuperb Spanish sci-fi-horror allegory that can only be watched as an allegory. Although it has horror elements of Cube, and Hunger from 2009 (both good movies), Cube was primarily about the sci-fi puzzle and survival, and Hunger was just survival horror. This one, however, is nothing less than a commentary about life, society and civilization. People are imprisoned in a multi-level strange prison, fed using a strict but (theoretically) very fair system where all of their required and high-quality food travels from the top level down to the lowest. Every 30 days people find themselves in a different level. Unfortunately, while the system works in theory, human behaviour within such a hierarchy ensures misery, abuse, murder and cannibalism. Some try to improve the system, others try to fight, most just make it worse. Every detail of this allegory can be understood clearly with a little thought, with an ending that is both dark and desperately hopeful which looks towards the next generation.\n\nAnother quiet, subtle and thought-provoking wonderful metaphysical film by Robert Lepage. This one would go well as a slightly darker but more subtle companion piece to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The movie is mostly metaphysical, philosophical and intellectually romantic with only one surreal dream sequence. A bizarre murder takes place where a man's brain is stolen. At the same time, we witness a man who seems to live in multiple worlds and is very aware of it, and in each one he encounters the same intriguing woman only in different roles. This movie asks many intriguing questions about the imagination and power of the mind: If you had the power to live in infinite worlds, wouldn't you be as omniscient as God? What would life be in a world of mind unconstrained by physicality? What would happen to emotional attachments in such a world? How does one find meaning and passion under such conditions? Etc.\n\nThis is a home-made, very cerebral sci-fi movie made amazingly right. The plot is about some engineer hobbyists that try to make money by building an unusual machine. So many ideas get thrown around, and the machine's goals keep changing so often, that even they can't figure out what they put together, and soon unusual things start to happen, until they figure out that they have invented a time loop. At first, they use it for simple financial gain, beautifully taking into account minor details such as the many ways they may affect their own timeline, two cellphones with the same card existing at the same time, and leaving a car ahead of time so they can drive back home. But as they use it repetitively, the recursive permutations involving the same people going through the same short timeline noticing different details every time and trying to fix little things that have gone wrong encountering their future selves trying to change things that haven't even happened and that may not even happen, all goes over their and our heads. The techno-babble and the various repercussions of time-loops are both thrown around at a brisk pace to provoke thought without caring whether the audience can catch up or understand, and eventually, like with the more existential 'I Love You' by Resnais, something else emerges and you just enjoy the movie's metaphysical provocations at a higher intellectual level. This is like the hardcore geek version of 'I Love You' with the low-budget and intelligent feel of Pi, it is metaphysically challenging and purposely confusing, and is only suitable for people that really, really love the technical, ethical and philosophical side of time-travel conundrums. This one dives into the limitless possibilities of time travel, and isn't afraid to drown in it.\n\nAlthough not as dense as Shane Carruth's movies, this is like Resnais's Je T'aime as directed by Carruth. It deals with repeating fragments of memories by a man who becomes obsessed with them, until something different emerges from the movie: An existential, thought-provoking, reality-bending experience. It's Synecdoche, New York done right without the self-loathing. This man suffers severe damage from a mysterious falling object after being there for unknown reasons with a mysterious suitcase. After a long recovery, his life without memories has become meaningless and disaffected and the remainder consists of only fragments of memories which he struggles to remember and piece together, these memories becoming his only link to life and meaning. A large financial settlement allows him to hire anyone and anything to reproduce the memories. But his obsession gradually shifts from trivial fragments to more violent events that awaken something inside him, and he goes to very extreme lengths to explore and reproduce those and get any kind of connection to life. Reality merges with staged reality, real lives become subservient to an obsession, and life becomes a quantum reality that creates itself.\n\nSave the Green Planet\n\nA cult movie from Korea that stylistically mixes genres in a highly entertaining, constantly surprising package. An unstable recluse and his brooding aerialist girlfriend kidnap a CEO whom they think is an alien from Andromeda and submit him to various tortures in the belief that they are saving the planet. A police duo provide some intelligent sleuthing to track down the kidnapper. Is he insane or does his convincing encyclopedic knowledge about aliens have a factual basis? The film mixes touching drama, wacky black comedy, bloody horror, cruel violence, thrilling tension, science-fiction, demented plot twists and props, and rich scenery and cinematography which is at times a tad reminiscent of Gilliam and Jeunet. For those of you that have had enough of the relentlessly grim Korean war and vengeance cinema but enjoy the style, this early entry may be just what the doctor ordered: Uniquely insane and balanced with a human as well as a blackly humorous angle.\n\nThe best rock'n'roll, heroic fantasy, kung-fu, post-apocalyptic, Hong-Kong style, sword-fighting, anti-communist, campy and stylish movie ever with a guitar-strumming, glasses-wearing, ass-kicking superhero. OK so it's the only one of its kind, but it's absolutely great entertainment. The heroes and villains are mythical and almost surreal, the scenery and costumes are inspired by Mad Max but have a style of their own, and the action, music and camp comedy are all superb. This movie defies any and all categories and is superbly entertaining to boot. Definitely a cult movie waiting to be discovered by a wider audience.\n\nPeckinpah's most controversial and brutally violent thriller about a peace-loving American mathematician who travels to the British countryside to relax only to find that the locals are nasty bullies. They set their eye on his wife who encourages and flirts with them to annoy her husband, they fight with him about a construction job they are too lazy to complete, and start a lynching party after a local retard whom they think is a perverted animal. It all escalates quickly, pushing the American over the edge into brutal violence and intense psychological emotions that he didn't know he had in him. Features an intense, semi-cooperative rape scene that obviously annoyed the feminists. A classic. The 2010 remake is competent but inferior thanks to the weaker location and casting, and this movie simply didn't need a remake in any case.\n\nTears for Sale\n\nA blend of Jeunet's magical modern fairy-tale look-and-feel with Kusturica's earthy, lusty but wacky energy. The setting is a pseudo-mythical land of Serbia during WWI after most of the men have been wiped out, and some villages consist of only women, lust, longing and magic. Two women, who work as professional mourners, and after having a disastrous appointment with the only (old) man left in the village, are cursed and sent off to find men to bring back to the village, while the rest drink spider-brandy and literally flirt with ghosts. They find a circus strong-man and a smooth-operator Charleston dancer, bring them back after a delirious marketplace chase, and promptly fall in love, complicating matters with the village. A visual feast and a nice blend of sadness, energy, ghosts, death, overflowing lust for life, and magic that loses its way only a bit in the second half.\n\nOne would never guess in a million years that this artsy sci-fi movie was made by the same man who brought us Star Wars. Its main focus is atmosphere, experimental visuals and the portrait of a futuristic dehumanized world rather than a complex plot, which simply tells the story of a man trying to escape a world where everything is mechanized, budget-driven, and efficiency-oriented, and passion is controlled with drugs. This world is occupied by strange, unsympathetic characters, driven by deeply confused but subdued neuroses, prisons are stretches of pure white without bars and walls, and people look for answers in robotic spiritual booths with canned answers. Not a popcorn sci-fi movie, and full of gripping atmosphere and enigmatic details.\n\nToys In The Attic\n\nThis one is recommended primarily for older kids, but adults will get a kick out of it as well. This is Jirí Barta's masterpiece, who made many shorts but whose only full-length movie before this was his dark animated take on 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin' decades ago. One possible description of this one is Toy Story, as made by Svankmajer. It is as if a bunch of kids (and one accompanying adult that added a couple of darker touches) went into a very very old, dilapidated, dirty attic, and found mountains of very dingy toys, heaps of junk, bric-a-brac and whatnot, and created a whole world out of anything they found, and turned it into a stop-motion animation that must have taken years to create. A piece of clay with a bottle-cap for a hat becomes one character, an old plastic tube with an eyeball attached becomes a spy-snake creature, a very dirty wooden doll becomes a heroic Don Quixote character, and so on. Real bugs interact with the toys, and even the cat dresses up to become an ominous character, but when people visit the attic, the world stops. This universe is split into two realms, the friendly community of random toys, complete with an elaborate train, and the world of evil run by a tin dictator on a safe, and his minions are the grimiest, rattiest creatures, some of which look like they were pieced together from a dust-bunny and doll-legs. A trip from one 'world' to another to save poor little Buttercup becomes a long trek full of dangers. Pillows become clouds in a magical, delightfully imaginative scene, and old clothes and black material turn into flash-floods. The creativity and animation are always astounding and delightful.\n\nTriplets of Belleville, The\n\nThe closest comparison I can think of for this unique French animation is Bill Plympton, but only in the sense that it exaggerates familiar details and stereotypes to the point of grotesqueries, and that it has a highly idiosyncratic style. And what a magically warped, and charmingly grotesque this movie is. The story involves a little French woman, a dog that hates trains, and her boy obsessed with cycling, whom she trains until his muscled legs become five times the size of his skeletal torso. He is kidnapped by a 'French mafia' while on the Tour de France and she follows him to Belleville, a grotesque version of America, where she enlists the aid of a very eccentric performing triplet of old ladies. This a world where legs are massaged with vacuum cleaners, dogs dream of riding trains and being barked at by humans, old ladies blow up frogs with grenades for food and play music on refrigerator shelves, ships tower over the water like skyscrapers, and waiters literally bend over backwards to serve. I also liked the use of Bach and other classical pieces in the soundtrack. Endlessly surprising, amusing and highly recommended.\n\nUninvited Guest, The\n\nOne of those movies where the last few minutes forces you to re-evaluate the whole movie in symbolic/surreal terms. A Spanish horror/thriller divided into two parts and a climax that warps your brain. The first part is a horror-thriller about a man who just split up with his girlfriend and who is sure that a strange man is lurking in his big house but he can't find him. This first part gets under your skin and is done very well. The second part becomes subtly bizarre as it reverses the roles, and is highly entertaining as well as unsettling. And then suddenly everything turns utterly bizarre into dream-logic, leaving you no alternative but to re-interpret the movie, especially when you realize that the same actress acts in two roles. This brilliant movie turns out to be about relationships and the fears of living with somebody and sharing your space and living habits with them, an artsy movie about living with someone with secrets, where a basement symbolizes the subconscious. A horror movie indeed.\n\nStone lightens up somewhat after his controversial Natural Born Killers and delivers a similarly deranged, stylistic but humorous look at the adventures of one man who takes a wrong turn. Full of over-the-top dark humor, this noir film follows the life of a man whose life just keeps getting worse and worse to the point of absurdity. He gets caught up with domestic, incestuous violence, greasy opportunist mechanics and many other strange adventures in an inbred, trashy town from hell. Twisted fun.\n\nWicker Man, The\n\nCult classic about a Christian policeman that comes to an island inhabited by Pagans in search of a missing girl, and finds a lot more than he expected. The atmosphere, music, characters, acting, story and setting are all extremely well done, and the movie has an extraordinary and indescribable effect, etching itself permanently in your brain with a powerful ending. It offers a fascinating and unsettling look into Pagan lifestyles of old, complete with long musical episodes where the folk dance and sing joyously while performing acts of alien and barbaric religion. And yet the comparisons to Christianity provoke thought. I usually don't like musical performances in movies, but the musical set-pieces here are unforgettable and add a lot to the movie, including a popular number by a naked Britt Ekland. Chilling, fascinating, erotic, unforgettable, classic cult material.\n\nYoung Man with High Potential, A\n\nThis is one of those movies that, although not visually extreme, make such good use of their dark content, they get under your skin and become deeply disturbing. It's only here due its ability to get under audiences' skin very effectively and it is well done. I see this one as a 'Crime and Punishment' for the computer geek or the modern lonely male. Although it obviously doesn't come anywhere close to the existential depth and unrelenting darkness of Dostoyevsky, there's a powerful theme in this movie that gives it a thought-provoking edge: The potential messed-up things that even a self-professed idealistic and smart man can do when he knows he can get away with it, especially when he is angry or emotionally distraught. That, and the mental consequences, as well as the way such things can easily spiral to dark places. A secondary theme is the way the internet and its many conveniences affect today's generation. The two protagonists of this movie are both likeable, sympathetic and realistic, even when horrible things are being done. Their only sins before the events happened are standard thoughtlessness on one end, and a lack of character on the other. The plot involves a smart but socially very awkward computer-science student that teams up with a sexy, friendly and warm girl looking for help with her paper. To say more would be to spoil the movie, but it suddenly turns from light and sweet drama, to dark and gruesome quite fast, in extremely realistic ways. There is nasty gore but it's not a gore movie, there is crime and depravity although not from a typically depraved person, and there is punishment although only if you pay close attention in the final scenes with the brilliantly insightful detective (Amanda Plummer). Although I am not sure I would come back to re-watch this one, it is underrated and recommended for at least a one-time watch.\n\nOf Some Interest\n\nMutants form a terrorist group and attack the beautiful, the rich and the aerobic instructors. Things get violent when they kidnap an aggressive mogul's daughter and run off to a planet populated by psychotic miners who haven't seen a woman in decades... Campy, violent, slightly twisted fun with an art department that went on to do Delicatessen. The crazy debut feature by Álex de la Iglesia who went on from this campy lunacy to make the superb (conventional horror) movie: The Day of the Beast.\n\nOne of Atom Egoyan's strangest, artsy entries in his oeuvre of unconventional films. The theme seems to be about empty people living through objects, rented emotions, fantasies, and other people's lives, the value of life classified, evaluated and adjusted by insurance adjusters or cinema censorship systems. Noah goes above and beyond the call of duty to help people after a fire has taken away all of their possessions, comforting them and even giving them sex when they need it, regardless of their sexual orientation, all the while evaluating their lives through their belongings, leading his customers and motel owners to put him on a pedestal as a kind of saint. His wife evaluates films by pressing buttons, then records the deviant pornography so that an immigrant can experience what she is going through. They live in a model home with fake books, opposite billboards depicting more fake homes. Finally, a rich woman with ridiculously complex sexual fantasies involving exhibitionism and her accommodating, insane husband, take over their house and lives under the pretext of making a movie, leading to a bizarre ending that kinda makes sense once you understand the language of this movie. As opposed to the rest of Egoyan's fans however, I didn't find this particularly deep or interesting.\n\nAn amusing oddity. Most attempts to make a so-bad-its-good movie on purpose fail, but this one knows what it wants and it gets the tone right. It's a pity they didn't develop the story enough to make it interesting beyond the initial amusement however. This one models itself after goofy 50s B&W horror movies, as well as Night of the Living Dead, and it gets the look and feel just right with a straight-faced layer of silly comedy, except it uses a modern punk soundtrack which somehow adds to the amusement. An evil corporation is concocting an evil plan to infect the water and the local teenagers with huge head-zits, which turn them into semi-zombies some of the time and makes them need to rub oily food or chocolate into the zit. The whole top of their heads just turn into a popped zit and they spend the movie walking around like that, scaring the locals. But instead of developing the story, the movie gets lost in many other somewhat weird sub-plots: An army woman with an obsession over her boyfriends going bald, a gypsy fortune-teller with bad eyesight, etc.\n\nAdult Swim Yule Log\n\nFrom the little that I have seen from Adult Swim, it's mostly a juvenile approach to all things 'adult', including its surrealism. Like overgrown kids thinking they can 'do Lynch'. This horror movie combines that with the American Horror Story approach: Throw everything and the kitchen sink together, and hope that impresses people. It starts like a joke static youtube broadcast of a yule-log burning. Then it dives into the home-invasion genre Hills Have Eyes style, a ridiculous evil object in the vein of 'Rubber', a horny teenage slasher movie, a cursed-house movie, a weird Lynchian-wannabe twilight-zone horror movie dealing with hellish fireplace time-travelling demons, a Satan-worshipping horror movie, and even a cheesy alien-abduction-tentacles movie. Throw in a couple of brief splattery gore scenes for good measure. Of course, nothing sticks, and it's all rather silly, but it'll keep you from getting distracted for its whole running time.\n\nA low-budget attempt at a dark Jacob's Ladder-like thriller that deals with... alien abduction. A group of teens (sigh) find themselves abducted and then entangled with a sinister government project and nasty individuals that experiment with alien semen and perform lobotomies with a blender. Some interesting nightmarish and bizarre moments, some gore, lots of bad acting that ruins the film, acceptable special effects, an interesting twist ending, and a weak final scene.\n\nThis is one of those movies that feel like an extended Twilight Zone episode, except it's one of the creaky, dated ones with dime-store, unchallenging psychology. It's also Danish and has superb production values, even though it uses shaky cameras and gritty lighting, almost like a Dogme 95 film. Zetterstrøm is a professional piano player that has lost his soul, his past locked away in a surreal 'Zone', a section of the city where he grew up that is completely blocked to the world. The powers-that-be arrange for a visitation to the Zone where he will learn Important Lessons about his past and his soul and where his Talent is stored in a jar. There is some light wry humor that pokes fun at the absurdity of the fantasy situation, but, otherwise, this is obvious, crude and unchallenging.\n\nAll the Gods in the Sky\n\nModern-day French nasty somehow combines horror, transgressive dark drama, and art-house. An insane man has been 'taking care' of his severely disabled and disfigured sister for many years after a childhood accident for which he is to blame. (The sister is acted by a real-life model with a genetic disorder.) Years of guilt has driven him to fantasies of alien intercession. His care-giving involves a few disturbing practices, and his madness is rapidly deteriorating, causing alien hallucinations and bursts of violence.\n\nAll Women Are Bad\n\nOdd and somewhat-strange nudie movies from the 60s are a dime a dozen; Just ask the Something Weird releasing company. What makes this one stand out is it's use of light surrealism. A New York salesman having a bad day is \"pulled by a voice back to civilization\", but finds his wife is cheating on him. What follows is a spree of peeping on women in New York while ranting about them all being bad, the movie using his narration to explain his reactions to all the odd sex encounters he witnesses while somehow always staying a non-participant using dream-logic. There's a strange old man into feathers and feet that visits a young girl, a flamingly gay encounter, the usual fluffy light giggling S&M, strippers, horny hippies, and then there's the horny fortune-teller, and a necrophiliac. Except many of the women turn out to have his wife's face. Movie watchers will guess the twist long before the ending, and the nudie sex is standard 60s eccentric fare, but the narration, dream-logic and randomness is entertaining.\n\nThink of this horror movie as similar to the movie 'May', except without the charm and quirk. It even has the same flaw. Alyce, who is obviously mentally unstable from the start, and her friend Carroll, are both stupid girls trying to get over Carroll's boyfriend cheating on her in an endless setup where we get to hang out with a distasteful group of youngsters. After she accidentally pushes Carroll off the roof, she makes the stupid decision to run, hide from police, feel horribly guilty, and then sell her body for drugs (what?). But this is only the beginning, and when she snaps, it's not a pretty picture. Unfortunately her personality never rings true, but the acting is good, and her psychotic, devil-may-care attitude in the second half of the movie as she starts masturbating to news footage of the Middle-East, playing deranged and violent games with lovers, flirting with necrophilia, and inventing gory ways to get rid of bodies, is a must see. And no, besides the names, and the fact that it has some colorful characters and a girl losing her mind, this has nothing to do with Alice in Wonderland.\n\nAlma Corsária (Buccanner Soul)\n\nBrazilian avant-garde movie that paints a portrait of 50 years of Brazilian life through an interconnected series of dramatic, magical-realist or absurd vignettes. A man takes a suicidal man to a bar where he is celebrating a biographical book with his old friend. They tell the tales of their past since growing up in the 50s until the 90s, with characters from the past popping up in the bar as they go along. The movies and music that shaped Brazil interweave with the stories, some involving sudden violence or crime, a strange relationship with a prostitute, life in the country and in the city, the turbulent 70s where his bedroom suddenly becomes a mass of swarming red-book students and Godardesque intertitles, that all somehow turns into a sex thing. Other absurdities include a bodybuilder posing in front of the bar, a skeleton in a typing office, and people magically transported to different settings. A moderately interesting complex artsy epic.\n\nGreek art-house movie inspired by the Greek myth of Antigone. Instead of a woman fighting an unfair system in order to bury her brother, here we get a modern day woman refusing to get involved in a surreal society that has deteriorated to creepy gangs of violent youth and violent gangs of gas-mask-wearing brutal soldiers. After turning away her brother, she is haunted by her lost innocence and honest youth, and is forcibly placed under a tree containing her dead brother. Here she ponders her choices. It's all very heavy-handed in its message and delivery and this spoils the movie, but visually and atmospherically this is a beauty.\n\nTaking it's cue from 'Pan's Labyrinth' and 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' this movie depicts a difficult time in the life of an 11-year-old girl from her point of view using magical realism and very light surrealism. But whereas Pan's Labyrinth clearly separated its fantasy and real-life events and drew very deep and affecting parallels between them, this one blends the two together, is very light on the fantasy, and draws very superficial parallels between them. Gitty is a girl growing up in an American farm in the 80s which is being threatened by big business. While farms and farmers around them are losing their livelihood and lives, her family seems to be taking the fight more seriously and upping the stakes. When she encounters a man locked up in the silo who wants to grant her wishes, her innocent mind fails to absorb what is really happening, until the stakes grow really high and she is forced to grow up and make a stand for what is right. The cinematography is beautiful, and the acting is amazingly good. The light surrealism is limited to only one nightmare dream-sequence, and the hallucinative visions of a human as a devil-like creature that makes people do things they shouldn't. The theme of making a moral stand even amongst family is a strong theme, but the implementation is poor. The biggest flaw here is that people's behaviour never makes sense: A prisoner keeps asking for idiotic things that won't really help him and never states the obvious, a family member becomes psychotic against his own family for no believable reason, and the girl never even asks basic questions. But the good aspects of this movie still make this a solid one-time watch.\n\nAmerican Scream, The\n\nA family and four teenagers visit a very strange town full of various wackos and killers, a town that seems to have a vicious and insane hatred for youngsters. This was panned by almost everyone that watched it for being an incoherent and incomprehensible 80s horror movie. Besides the endless parade of strange people and bizarre acts of violence, the weirder thing is that the teens never seem to be fazed much by all the murderous mayhem, and continue with life as normal. The thing is, and I may be wrong here, it's not meant to be watched as a horror movie about a killer town. It's a surreal satire on generation gaps in a somewhat similar way to Society (expect without the splatter). Babies are viciously exploded, teenagers are hunted for sex but are also hated to the point of murder, and the local preacher is the worst of all, because it is the standard adult disgust of immoral teenage behaviour that has been transformed into surreal violence. And the teenagers are used to that. Except that teenagers also grow up and become the next generation of teenage-hating adults. So there you go: It's a surreal social commentary movie that uses horror. Whether the director intended this is another question, since the movie is still rather strange and somewhat put together.\n\nDutch psychological thriller/comedy about twin brothers who meet for the first time after many years at their mother's house, after which their dark, traumatic past slowly rears its head. A girl appears out of nowhere who has a thing for burning cars, a criminal dies at the dinner table to which his mother reacts with a mild criticism, and a crime boss brings along a woman who urinates on graves on command. Features a sprinkle of absurdism, a dash of psychological tension and Freudian themes, an ambiguous ending, and a speck of surrealism but none of these elements stand out and the movie doesn't quite feel original.\n\nAnatomy of Hell\n\nA woman slits her wrists in a gay discotheque because 'she is a woman' then strikes a deal with a homosexual to have him visit her nightly to discuss and experience her femininity while sharing male insights as to why he finds the female body repulsive and/or powerful. So she displays her body and bodily functions, seduce each other in twisted ways, intellectually discuss sexuality as only the French can while he plays with and mildly abuses her body while trying to come to terms with his disgust. This one uses explicit pornography to explore the female body and wanders into gratuitous territory with some nasty menstruation games, but as usual with Breillat, it manages to philosophize nonsensically as well as provoke some thought.\n\nAnd the Mud Ship Sails Away\n\nQuirky Japanese dramedy about a slacker living in a small village with his old grandmother. Most of the movie is an amusing character study, pitting the defiantly unemployed slacker against several people: There's his friend who tries to pull him back into life with several semi-misguided tactics, there's a young man who keeps knocking on his door trying to guilt him into buying handkerchiefs for charity, his ex-wife who hates him and bars him from seeing their son, and finally, a young city-girl who appears from nowhere and claims to be his half-sister from a time when his father wandered. This girl calls him for what he is and doesn't take crap from him, but all of them can't shake him from his lethargy. I said 'most of the movie' above, because, for the climax, the movie suddenly veers into the surreal and possibly a drug-trip involving hermits and aliens, with a comical, ironic and absurd ending. It feels like the director didn't know how to end and hit the self-destruct button, but the absurd and silly irony hits some kind of fuzzy and amusing target anyways.\n\nThe definitive Japanese Pinku series on the topic of rape. These movies straddle the border between erotica, exploitation, art and thoughtful drama. The first deals with teenage rapists as brutish animals trying to deal with their conscience and their treatment of women, one of whom has a young sister that makes things difficult for him to behave as if he doesn't care. The second deals with porn and illusion as a pornographer falls in love with an innocent-looking girl in a rape flick only to find that reality is much darker, her innocence and charm long dead as she sells herself and practically rapes customers in nymphomaniac lust. The third follows a female reporter who tracks down rape victims to document the aftermaths, and finds much more than she bargained for as victims show her their twisted lifestyles, or cower in fear and look at her like a disease as she uncovers their experiences. The fourth deals with perception and relative perversity: a girl is tricked into posing for a porn mag and suddenly finds herself stalked, used and looked down on, a guy falls for her but is confused for a local pervert by angry neighbours, and several people all practice strange fetishistic masturbation in the privacy of their own homes. The fifth tells the tale of a couple with trust issues after being raped, cheated on, abused, lied to and abused by society, who then try to build a romance (after he hits her with his car and rapes her in despair). All the movies are filmed beautifully and artistically enhanced by some dream sequences, they linger on numerous graphic sex and rape scenes but creatively hide the cruder details, the actors are all good, and the themes are explored thoughtfully.\n\nAngels of Revolution\n\nFedorchenko explores another story of a pagan tribe, this one hit hard by the Russian Revolution. Except this time instead of using magical realism, he uses fun, avant-garde, very creative art with quirky humor and rich visuals as the medium. Russian revolutionary artists are sent to convert a tribe that would much rather follow their gods than the new Soviet vision. First Polina collects her team of highly creative and unusual artists, then the film depicts their communication through art, all of which is delightfully inventive and amusing, then suddenly the movie turns dark delivering its message with a hard blow that sneaks up on you. Most of the movie consists of sketches and short playful scenes with delightfully surprising props and visuals, each with a sardonic point to make. An artistic 'radio' tunes into the message of the people, a dead owl turns out to be a relative, a church is quickly converted into a cremation factory, a composer makes music with engines and factory sounds, a tribe buries cats up in trees, a propaganda film using ethnicity imagery is projected onto smoke, etc etc. Every frame is rich, colorful and carefully composed like a Greenaway film, each prop a surprise.\n\nAngst (AKA Schizophrenia)\n\nA study of a killer sociopath that belongs on the same shelf as Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. A pathetic sociopathic loser with ambitious fantasies for committing evil is released from jail and promptly goes looking for people to kill, plotting and planning but always failing to pull anything off due to his weak will and mind. After running away from a confrontation with a suspicious female taxi driver, he finds a house occupied by a lady, her mother and her retarded brother and even then, his attempts at sadistic murder become extremely messy. The camera-work is incredibly skilled as it follows him around, and the voice-over by the killer informs us of his plans, thoughts, and dysfunctional relationship with his family. Gritty, grimy and unpleasant.\n\nA movie about zoophilia is one thing. What's really weird is how straight this Argentinian black comedy plays it. It takes the idea of a man having a passionate affair with a sheep, and just runs with it, as a deadpan comedy-horror. The sheep's eyes call him, they fall in love, there's an torrid affair in the barn, he shares his feelings and thoughts with the sheep. But then the problems start and never stop. A rapist farm-employee, discovery, his family becomes involved, he may have to commit murder and other immoral deeds to protect his love, and what if the sheep decides to cheat on him with a ram? It also contains one of the most deranged cover-ups of a murdered body ever. I can't say that this is a tasteful movie, but it does its utmost to be tasteful, except it's completely warped and witty, resulting in a hilarious movie, except you wouldn't want to tell your friends that you laughed.\n\nPolish/Swiss reality-bending mystery and relationship drama. A husband and wife with a troubled marriage go on vacation and leave a house-sitter in charge of their home. Problem is, she looks like the upstairs neighbor who may or may not be having an affair with the husband. Things get weird when they run over a sheep, and reality starts becoming quite confusing. Relationship tension is mixed with confusion, as events happen out of time and in the wrong order, numerous strange parallels develop between events on vacation and what is happening with the house-sitter at home, they are further upset by disturbing and confusing dreams of attempted murder between them, and when a cat starts psychically communicating with the wife and putting ideas into her head, things become completely derailed. For those that have watched a couple of movies of this ilk, the ending will come as no surprise, and I found the movie somewhere in between a copy-cutter, pedestrian Hollywood reality-bending mystery, and a layered, slightly more interesting, lightly-surreal European flick about a relationship. Don't expect anything deep though.\n\nSci-fi horror with an imaginative and interesting concept, but a very troubled implementation. A biologist finds herself joining a team that is studying and exploring a very threatening phenomenon: a shimmering area on the planet that is slowly expanding to take over the Earth, and from which people never return. What this being actually is, and its form of biological invasion is the interesting part, causing havoc with the very basis of life and re-interpreting life on Earth to suit its own purposes. The bizarre and scary encounters that the scientific team come up against are also grippingly strange and threatening in new ways. The movie is part near-surreal Tarkovsky, part Hollywood action and horror, part indie sci-fi. The primary flaw, however, is the way humanity deals with this phenomenon, always in the most brainless and ridiculously idiotic way possible. And this happens throughout the movie many dozens of times, starting with the fact that the 'military' that is studying this threat seems to consist of a handful of clueless, depressed people that don't take even the most minimal precautions, and ending with the constantly irrational ways the team behave. This flaw is fatal, as it is constantly distracting and unrealistic. The ending is also unsatisfying, and the flashbacks are banal, as if they were shoehorned in just to fill in a quota. In addition, while Portman is, as usual, reliably good here, her partner for the movie seems heavily medicated, as is Jennifer Jason Leigh. In summary, it feels as if the film-maker took some solid ideas from the book, fiddled with it based on what he thought would be cool and necessary for the movie, and kept fiddling with it to make it into a primarily visual and atmospheric experience, not paying attention to the fact that it stopped making sense a long time ago.\n\nAnonymous Queen, The\n\nStrange, sometimes slightly surreal farce by Gonzalo Suárez about a housewife having a very strange day. It starts with a dream about faucets left running and a strange person knocking at the door, then it turns into reality as one strangely dressed person after another pops up in her house. People appear, disappear, there's a murder, the victim may or may not be alive, people in raunchy costumes appear for a sex party, there's a painter, a television with a mind of its own, etc. all somehow related to anger against men or her husband, and sex. Is it all in her mind? But surprises and odd events turn out to have perfectly normal explanations, then again, the normal explanations run out of steam and it becomes an absurd fantasy involving queens and special powers. Or does it?\n\nAmbitious low-budget metaphysical-buddhist-sci-fi flick. A grounded, thoughtful young man discovers what appears to be a video camera that shows him other lives, the past and some possible futures, which gradually alters his perception of reality. Dangers also appear, insanity, and it is discovered that previous owners of this object may have died. Metaphysics, perception, the power of the mind, transcendence, and similar concepts are thrown around, as the young man rises through levels of enlightenment while being jailed for a crime. The first half of this movie is intriguing and promises good metaphysical sci-fi, but then it unravels with a mish-mash of new-age mumbo-jumbo and muddled writing, hoping that something grander will emerge by throwing together random Asian characters and random cliched concepts of mental powers, reincarnation, astral projection, flying, subjective perception and how reality affects and stagnates our abilities. The actors are either bland, or poor, and the dialogue tends to become unnatural and pretentious. Top marks for ambition, above-average marks for making the movie look good despite the low budget, low marks for implementation details and muddled new-age claptrap in the second half.\n\nArrival of Joachim Stiller, The\n\nA very strange thriller/mystery/horror movie that revels in the inexplicable and unknown. A writer, some friends and associates are haunted by the continuous presence of the mysterious Joachim Stiller. Letters arrive with impossible knowledge, proof of Joachim's existence from different times in history, prophecies, mysterious bell music, omens and messages. Joachim can be interpreted alternatively as God, a guilt complex, a prophet of the apocalypse, a conspiracy, a time traveller, the second coming, a supernatural being, a magician, an illusion. Intertwined with this mystery are the lives of the protagonists, their love affairs, and a hilarious story of a deranged, old bathroom-graffiti pervert who is grabbed and promoted as a new visionary artist and bribed with whores. A very well-done and intriguing movie, but I'm not sure what to make of it.\n\nMexican version of Mad Max, with Iggy Pop and an emphasis on dark characters and strange events rather than action entertainment. The future consists of huge megapolis cities with the desert area in between ruled by local despots with their police or anarchy. Advanced gadgets mix with isolation and depravity such as a 150 year old judge (kept alive with machines) with a taste for young boys, and a priest who lectures against modern science in public and has flings with two S&M whores and a dog in private. One man tries to escape from this life with dire consequences.\n\nAtom Heart Mother\n\nVery unusual Iranian movie that is basically a dream turned into a movie. Like many dreams, there is a lot of nonsense, strange characters with a heavy psychological meaning and weight, a bit of completely absurd dream-logic, and most importantly: that feeling of mysterious dread where you can feel it but don't understand it, yet. Two airhead modern girls leave a party and drive through the city talking about various silly subjects while providing some sly social commentary on Iranians. There is reference to an absurd situation where Ahmadinejad was providing money to the citizens but causing ATM machines to stop working during that time. Various people join them in the car, including a hipster and a strange cop with a wacky sense of priorities. An accident, and a charming but dominant man steers the night towards something more evil and strange, including possible encounters with the devil, an alternate world and Saddam Hussein. There's a general feeling of the powers that be always existing and dominating their life from right around the corner. Like a dream, it just stops after an absurd but tense encounter, leaving you with the mystery and dread. Very light, barely-there surrealism, but effective.\n\nAnother crazy French genre-blender that mixes a musical (the seductive Vanessa Paradis acts and sings), sci-fi, gore and romance. A stunt-man has the hots for a local country girl with vocal talents but her protective father puts him in jail. A sleazy talent scout finds his way to the village and sets his eyes on her, but so do some violent flying aliens who enjoy decapitating and impregnating humans. Chaos ensues while another local talent makes a dog howl musically by fingering its wound. Entertaining and nicely filmed but feels unfinished and has way too much singing.\n\nSpanish rumination on death that feels like an Italian mondo complete with 70s soundtrack, filmed as a drama. A journalist wounded in Vietnam continues his thirst for answers after witnessing raw death and birth in the war. He conducts interviews with various experts and asks people in the street what they think of death in preparation for his book, but of course, not many people have interesting things to say and most ignore it or have unrealistic attitudes about it. This is mixed with some poetry and quotes recited by various characters, drama over a sudden death of a young man and his family, and drama over marriage and various people who forget to live. But all this is just decoration over the centerpiece, which is a real human autopsy in graphic detail intercut with all of the above that the journalist watches and films for his book, and which this movie treats as a life-changing experience. Of some interest only.\n\nAutopsy of a Ghost\n\nBizarre, completely wacky and silly fantasy-comedy from Mexico for fans of nutty bad movies only. A ghost, and his own walking-talking skeleton who keeps trying to dig himself out, is finally judged by God and given one last chance to redeem himself if he makes one woman out of four fall in love in him to the point of self-sacrifice. To this task, the devil himself is given the job of bringing women to his haunted abode and he recruits some odd families, luring them to the castle with the promise of money, playing games with them and pitting them against each other. There's a silly gag and surprise every other minute, with a mad inventor, a robot grandmother, a retractable tail, a reduction chair that makes the devil splatter sulfur, many women in bikinis, Christmas trees as disguises, rain that literally falls in buckets, beatnik juries, a man-child that speaks in a tiny voice, special agents and much more.\n\nBabylon: In Bed with the Devil\n\nGerman sexual horror with a surprise-surreal twist. A nurse ignores her better judgment when she gets involved with a confident con-man and skirt-chaser. In the meantime, women are arriving at the hospital with bizarre and painful pregnancies that end quite nastily, and a blind and desperate female patient with cancer keeps hitting on her. Matters escalate, the con-man seduces more and more women, while she tries to dig herself out of the trouble she finds herself in and get away from the devilishly overpowering jerk, leading to a surreal twist.\n\nCult, grindhouse, politically-incorrect horror about motherly love gone horribly and twistedly wrong. A welfare worker becomes interested in a case of a grown man still acting like a baby, in diapers, unable to speak or walk and under the care of a mother and her two grown daughters. The acting is chillingly superb, the characters are never stupid, and the movie makes its case well, making for some disturbing, plausible horror, up until the surprising twisted consequence-free ending that disappointingly makes the movie lose its plausibility.\n\nImagine a version of Henenlotter that likes to stick things up his butt, directing Gremlins after watching The Brood. This is a movie that, right after having watched it and picked your jaw off the floor, you may find yourself wondering why the hell you just enjoyed a movie about a butt monster. This feels like a comedy-horror throwback to the 80s in a good way, except it's about a man whose alter ego is a creature that lives in his stomach. This vicious-cute demon has a.... unique doorway to the world which provides ongoing jokes for the movie that are somehow both juvenile and amusing. And they somehow snagged Warburton, Root and a couple of other good actors for this one. There's awkward comedy over his mother's way-too-active sex life, office humor straight out of Office Space, one gratuitously splattery scene involving a penis, and sessions with a crazy shrink that just keep getting funnier. My favorite line: \"I had a monster up my ass. This is the furthest thing from a metaphor!\".\n\nA dark, intelligent and intense study of obsessions in relationships and clashing personalities. A self-possessed, pedantic, jealous and passive-aggressive professional psychologist gets caught up with a free-spirited, neurotic, flirtatious, spontaneous and self-absorbed woman. They are drawn to each other as only opposites can, each needing and lustfully attracted to what the other has, their relationship rapidly becoming unhealthy and obsessive from both ends until the final twisted ending. A third obsessive character is provided by the stern and pedantic detective who tries to piece together what led to her attempted suicide shown at the beginning of the movie. The structure is superbly non-linear and carefully edited together, the characters are intensely familiar, extremely well-drawn and realistically twisted and Roeg pulls no punches, thus receiving criticism from people who can't stand seeing such insightful exposure. The overly-explicit and nasty ending always ruins it for me however, not feeling completely in-tune with the rest of the characterization, and ending on a note of pointless nastiness rather than insight or dark catharsis.\n\nBag Boy Lover Boy\n\nThis movie starts off with great promise, featuring colorful and unusual character interaction, then deeply disappoints when it squanders it all away for a very banal and never believable serial-killer plot development. Albert works at a hot-dog stand, and is a strange guy both inside and out. Mentally deficient in many ways, quirky, but with his own character and opinions, and he knows how to stand his ground. He also has bizarre sexual fantasies. When a transgressive-art photographer (that could only come from New York) decides to make him his muse for some violently-themed erotica photographs, his sexual fantasies take a highly bizarre and twisted turn. While the photographer tries to exploit everyone under the sun, Albert has his own ideas... The tone is gritty, like an old-school movie about the underbelly of NY, and it is somehow both twisted and humorous, and, as mentioned, the characters are superb. But then... that happens. And then it ends.\n\nA Pasolini-esque mythical tale that is probably a metaphor for Serbian-Croatian Yugoslavia of old and its politics, but I am not knowledgeable enough to decipher it. On an island that floats, the leader is an old captain constantly awaiting death who always holds up a picture of himself as a young man, there are dozens of black-clothed crones always hovering in the background, there's a priest, a sailor, an older woman with desperate lusts, a young man, and various other characters that all seem to represent something. There's also a law that says that people are not responsible for their actions during a depressing storm. When a beautiful and mysterious woman arrives by boat, she creates havoc, with all the men lusting after her, the women chasing and hating her, as she stirs up dark secrets like greed and lust in the priest's home, a pregnancy, and deep confused desires from the dying captain. She only seems to get along with the laid-back young man who plays with her. The natives sing traditional song, the atmosphere is earthy and mythical, all leading to a violent metaphorical climax.\n\nBeyond Dream's Door\n\nLow-budget amateurish horror movie but with a decent script, sometimes reminiscent of Nightmare on Elm Street. A college boy's nightmares start blending into reality, the scenes strung together in a sequence like real life, and people and objects from real life changing, dying and coming back to life. He involves his psychology professor and some teacher assistants only to put them in danger. Somewhat entertaining and interesting, but contains weak acting and rubbery gore and monsters. Brain Dead did it better.\n\nBig Empty, The\n\nThis one is like a road movie spliced with an alien conspiracy from Twilight Zone as directed by Coen Brothers. The result is mild fun, quirky and entertaining, but it also feels like it's trying too hard to be weird. An aspiring actor is manipulated by a strange neighbour who knows his masturbation practices, to go on a mission to deliver a blue suitcase to a cowboy. Along the way he meets many odd characters and is asked to do odd things, until the oddest finale. It has fun with clues and meaningless cross-references like the number 11, sperm and neck band-aids, but this is the equivalent of putting together a lot of puzzle pieces only to find that the final picture is one big blank, a journey that the protagonist also seems to go through. Score one for the Zen-like movie title, except that it isn't satisfying in the slightest. The moral? Don't leave sperm samples lying around.\n\nA Spanish experimental movie that feels like a poor man's version of Hiroshima, Mon Amour. This is a jazzy, stream-of-consciousness movie, due to its loose structure of flashbacks, voice-overs and inner thoughts, as well as due to its score. Like Hiroshima, the subject matter is its flaw, in this case yet another self-obsessed but internally dead woman who leads a successful life of actress, mother of three and rich wife, and who is so bored that she spends her time obsessing over her affair with a frustrated artist who constantly tries to provoke her into coming alive. Flashbacks weave together with other flashbacks often involving hurtful things he said to her, to the point where we are not sure if she is projecting these conversations only within her mind, the games and tension between them devolving into a tedious game of counting numbers while awaiting each other. Dead architecture is portrayed as more alive than she is, and his frustration and blocked writing makes him try increasingly desperate acts. Mostly tedious and frustrating, if only because the movie succeeds in its experimental editing and structure to evoke a mind devoid of interest clinging to others for its source of blood.\n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\n\nAmong other targets, academy and critic favorite Alejandro Iñárritu attacks critics in this drama and black comedy. Other targets include celebrities that try to win over Broadway and the world of theatre using their celebrity status, the clash of popularity and art, washed-up has-beens and an actors' version of a midlife crisis in the search for meaning in their work, and actors that are more real on stage than in real life. Elements from Michael Keaton's and Edward Norton's real life are used to enhance their harsh, edgy roles in this movie, and they both serve amazing performances. It's about a man who once became famous as a Hollywood super-hero, putting everything he has left into a Broadway play, and encountering endless obstacles. The film is a series of impressive long-takes designed to make the whole film look like one long flowing take. His super-hero persona talks or appears to him constantly to confront him with his own insecurities and criticism, and his ego has taken on the form of super-power fantasies that he indulges in, blurring the line between real and unreal as he loses his solid footing in reality. It is these elements that make the film lightly surreal, not merely displaying inner fantasies and voices as something real, but exploring his inner psyche using such surreal tactics, viewing the world through his inner mind, while the primary drama and absurd chaos of the theatre take the main stage.\n\nBirds Without Feathers\n\nOdd, very fragmented, experimental movie about very broken interactions between people where everyone seems to be lacking an identity and is trying on different identities or having trouble with their self presentation and no-one seems quite real. There's one woman who puts on outfits and personalities depending on who she meets, dancing for them. Another one is only preoccupied with her image and selfies for Instagram, even combining parts of herself with posters. There's a motivational speaker who has no confidence, a stand-up comedian with stage fright, a foreigner with an obsession for becoming an American and a big fan of Jeff Goldblum even though he doesn't seem to know what Jeff looks like, a lying nurse who has a very bad connection with the elderly at the old-age home where she works. The movie consists of snippets of interactions, many of them suddenly cruel, other times just full of whimsy. Sometimes they do bizarre things like dig a hole in the desert, socially. Truth is, I didn't know what to make of all this and hated it. It felt like actors acting out abstract experiments in disconnected pseudo-social interactions. Or, if you prefer, a kind of z-generation version of Todd Solondz. Then towards the end I figured out how to interpret this: It's people acting in real life as they do on the internet, trying on identities, posing for others, partaking in broken snippets of communication attempts, having fantasy-identity sex, interacting with fake celebrities, pretending to be social masters but not having a clue, etc. I can't say it provided insight, but that's my take on it.\n\nBased on a script by Andrzej Zulawski and directed by his son, this messy movie combines a father's themes with the son's incoherent over-the-top approach to making social commentary on Poland's extremes. There's a literature teacher and poet with a famous film-maker for a father having an existential crisis, standing in for Xawery Zulawski. A musician with leprosy is loved by a blue-collar girl working for a depraved rich couple. A violent painter only has one eye, thus completing the trio of handicapped artists lost in a broken society that is going to extremes and superficiality. And, in its most compelling and coherent story-line (were the others altered?), a history teacher is bullied by fascist students into becoming a violent fascist himself. For the most part, this film doesn't have any of the primal expression of Andrzej and the unique performances he gets out of his actors, although the characters are generally over-the-top and often use that fragmented, tiring, free-association non-sequitur mouthpiece dialogue that plagued 'Snow White And Russian Red'. And, after a nice segment that pays a homage to Andrzej's films, one woman tries her hand at a Zulawski-esque primal breakdown but doesn't pull it off. There is also an amusing clash between a sensitive young person and the film 'Possession'. Most of the bizarreness takes place in the last few segments, as the characters turn to mindless violence and robbery to achieve their dreams, only to die within or turn against each other in confusing behaviour, leading to a surreal meta-ending. Throughout the film, I couldn't help but imagine what this would have looked like if Andrzej had directed it. A mess, with some points of interest.\n\nUnique, cult, Spanish, Lynchian-horror movie with Corey Feldman as a very prominent lead, somehow carrying the movie in a strange, Jerry-Lewis-esque nasal performance. Most of the movie is quite normal, actually, but it builds up slowly for a very overwhelming ending. Norman is a weak loser in love with a rich girl who barely seems to be able to stand being with him. He joins her for her father's birthday party in a strange retro-hotel straight out of Barton Fink, and spends the evening trying to talk to her while trying to avoid embarrassing her. But strange things are afoot with the waiters, and people keep ending up dead, while some madman keeps giving him instructions on how to stop an apocalyptic cult-ritual. The climax blends ear-splitting sound, silence, complete chaos, and very strange and incomprehensible goings-on, as all hell breaks loose and Norman tries to stop it with increasingly desperate measures. Reminiscent of Miracle Mile in how it starts as a regular movie gradually increases the chaos for an explosive ending, leaving you wondering when and how it turned surreal.\n\nBlack Journal (AKA Gran Bollito)\n\nIf anyone had told me Max von Sydow had a campy role in drag, I wouldn't believe it until I saw it with my own eyes. And this is only one of the elements that makes this Italian movie kinda weird. Shelley Winters delivers another unhinged performance loosely based on a real-life female serial-killer during WWII, who seems a normal, pleasant and helpful neighbour on the outside, but has convinced herself that she has a deal with Death after 12 miscarriages, and must regularly kill people as sacrifices. She doesn't just kill, however, she converts every part of their bodies into something useful, including soap and medicine, and converts her kitchen into a factory. She also has a disturbing, overly-protective and near-incestuous relationship with her one son and does everything to keep women and other dangers away from him. Her mentally challenged assistant and disabled husband complete the picture of her highly-controlled domain. Sydow is not the only drag-queen here, and the movie also revels in drag camp, drama and music for no particular reason.\n\nBlack Rose Is an Emblem of Sorrow\n\nArt-house Russian film that attempts to capture the zeitgeist of Perestroika through a collection of eccentric character archetypes that are portrayed with almost Fellini-esque delirium. It all takes place in an apartment building complex joined by roofs, and even the film's budget constraints are used to take a jab at governmental constraints. The general feel is of a society lost in a transitional state, both nostalgic but glad to see the old system go, and going out-of-control with the possibilities of the new. I am sure much of this went over my head, but I still got a feel for the society through the hodge-podge of anecdotes, random musings, whimsical song and dance, and the many interactions between the characters. There's a madman into drugs and alcohol, a modern man that takes his business and relationships to uncharted but chaotic territories, a female academic escaping the pressures of her family and her studies, a young boy inheriting traditional culture and money, and various other visitors, including a violent fascist, and man mourning for the loss of the past and his children. There is a lot of partying and acting out, touches of magical realism, a few absurd stories about Stalin and Brezhnev and their physical decline, a surreal dream sequence, and one character even joins the party straight from a dream. The eccentric ramblings and antics do wear out their welcome, but there is a social commentary here for those want to tune in. The second in a trilogy that started with the more conventional but cult movie Assa.\n\nBlack Sun: The Nanking Massacre\n\nFrom the maker of Men Behind the Sun comes another harrowing look at Japanese atrocities during WWII, this time in Nanking where a planned massacre took place. The numbers of murders, rapes, sadistic brutalities, and various inhumanities against civilians including women and children are all shown one after another including infamous scenes where a soldier rips out a fetus from a woman on his bayonet and some child rape and murder. It's a mixed bag, some scenes seem over-the-top and even exploitative in their indifferent and rapid delivery, others are disturbing and have a documentary feel, and others, like the massive burning of bodies, are powerful.\n\nBlind Owl, The (1992)\n\nThis has nothing to do with the classic Iranian novel as far as I can tell, except only in terms of vaguest references (see Raoul Ruiz). In fact, by setting it in a realist rent-boy drama setting, it arguably goes against that novel's themes. On its own terms, this is an idiosyncratic gloomy drama with realist settings, theatrical deadpan performances, and very light surreal touches. It portrays the life of a rent-boy, family and friends, including a pretty young teenage girl who also prostitutes herself. He takes his dead-end, desperate lifestyle in stride, encountering various perverts and clients with strange fetishes, doing their bidding best he can with a deadpan expression, in the same way that he takes a random violent beating in the bathroom. Violent pimps visit his house in search of his female friend, and everyone ignores his frequent smashing of windows as if it's nothing. He also makes a living caring for and serving an eccentric and abrupt blind man who has other strange friends that care for him as well. He cares for his mother who is sick and dying. And his father seems completely detached and purposely oblivious as to what his son is doing. Suicides are brief surreal events, the rent-boy hangout and pickup location is like a Felliniesque fetish circus, the drama is frequently interrupted by folk-music performances, and when death hits him, surreal poetry suddenly erupts in a brief visual scene (the only scene that feels inspired by the novel).\n\nA strange, condensed movie that could easily have been made into a long mini-series given its amount of plot and characters. Harry Joy, who loves to tell stories, has a heart attack, dies and comes back to life, and finds that his life has turned into "
