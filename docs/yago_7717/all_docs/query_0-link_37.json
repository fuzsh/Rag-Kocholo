        "text": "NAKED MASSACRE\n\naka Born For Hell\n\naka Die Hinrichtung\n\nDir. Denis Héroux, 1976\n\nWest Germany/Canada/France/Italy, 86 min.\n\nSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 26 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nBased on the infamous case of nurse-butcher Richard Speck—also portrayed in Kōji Wakamatsu’s VIOLATED ANGELS (1967), B-movies from 2002, 2007 and 2012, the original US poster for Fernando Di Leo’s SLAUGHTER HOTEL (1971), a Wesley Willis song, self-appointed ‘murder metal’ band Macabre’s 1993 tune “What The Heck Richard Speck?: Eight Nurses You Wrecked,” and, uh, master painter Gerhard Richter’s 1966 work “Eight Student Nurses”—this unusually sadistic international co-production is indeed the only version that grafts his story onto The Troubles in Belfast, Northern Ireland and re-casts Speck as a Vietnam vet, all while depicting a sexual perversity that allegedly outpaces that of the real-life killer.\n\nTHE SATAN KILLER\n\n(aka DEATH PENALTY)\n\nDir. Stephen Calamari, 1993\n\nUSA, 90 min.\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 25 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nA boozy addled, revenge-driven cop squares off with a crank fueled, devil-worshipping biker the hardboiled, mind-ruining crime flick THE SATAN KILLER. Filmed entirely on location in Virgina Beach, VA, and directed by the questionably named Stephen Calamari (most likey the film’s star, Steve Sayre) THE SATAN KILLER (aka Death Penalty and Rampage) features a little bit of something for everyone- murder, machine guns, drugs, drag queens, private eyes, beach babes, former male nurses, a frequently-visited t-shirt shop, punks, pimps, a frequently-visited coffee shop, strippers, a haunted house and a scene where the killer screams at a church, “You never fooled me!”\n\nA MORE PERFECT UNION\n\nDir. Steve and Ari Sheinkin, 105 min.\n\nUSA, 1995\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4 – MIDNIGHT\n\nSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!\n\nPossibly owing to the success of another film set in Austin, A MORE PERFECT UNION stumbles aboard an East Texas zeitgeist-bus of scrambled ambition and self-importance. Four roommates, being equal parts young, inexperienced, white and male, are fed up with involuntary membership in the bland Clinton-era generation. So they decide to secede and start their own country from the comfort of their ubiquitous 90s oversized couch. Stu, who wears culottes and refuses to leaves the house, provides the bulk of the philosophical leadership. The country eventually rallies around goals of Justice and Revenge, taking them into rebel territory and adolescent vigilante justice. Featuring local Austin tunes from the likes of Sidehackers, Magneto USA, Yah Yah Littleman, Javelin Boot and Prescott Curlywolf.\n\nSEXANDROIDE\n\nDir. Michel Ricaud, 1987\n\nFrance, 51 minutes\n\nSATURDAY, NOVEMBER 5 – MIDNIGHT\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18 – MIDNIGHT\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS!"
