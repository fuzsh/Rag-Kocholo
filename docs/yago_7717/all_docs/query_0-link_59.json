        "text": "Year: 1976\n\nDuration: 01:27:55\n\nDirected by: Denis Héroux\n\nActors: Mathieu Carrière, Debra Berger, Christine Boisson\n\nLanguage: English\n\nCountry: West Germany，Italy，France，Canada\n\nAlso known as: Born for Hell\n\nDescription: Vietnam veteran Kane Adamson comes back home. Without money in the Irish town of Belfast, he decides to go on the offense to get money for further road in U.S., but the usual theft turns into a cruel bloodbath.\n\nReview: Very original film from producer “Girls living down the lane” and directed “Terrible creation” and “blood ties”, which on the one hand the original slasher forming genre, given the year the movie, on the other hand a powerful psychological thriller about art hausnym, given the presentation of the material and playing on people’s emotions.\n\nUncompromising picture, tells the story of a nurse captured the girls in his home insane psychopath who had returned from the war. A rather strange protagonist from the very beginning is served in a repulsive type, while the diversity of future hostages we are trying to solve with one party or another character in order to somehow present so many heroines. Semantic foundation works very acute problem on that one hostage – a person, but because of the girls to make cannon fodder in the director had no desire, and the more terrible to observe all the murders, riots and debauchery that doeth the will of the psychopath.\n\nThere is no classic slasher cliches, but the film is intended to tradition, both by way of killing, and by tradition to kill, as they say, one by one – one by one, leading from the living room of any of the captured girls down, and already returning alone. Thriller-slasher has under a very real event, on the basis of which the film was made, so that the artistic delights are kept to a minimum, which slightly reduces the overall stress, but still makes the experience even take hand fluffy cat, which can create a maniac the most terrible things, or suitable for him, sitting on a bench in the park, children.\n\nA central figure of the antagonist is a general confusion in the individual and social mores. This is a man who has lost himself and does not have its own personality, a real beast without a soul. Not for nothing is it a tattoo “Born for Hell”, on which the film is named. The truth in the world he is most common under the name «Naked Masssacre» (Naked Massacre) which was re-released in the U.S. and has spread to a new wave of popularity as word Masssacre pecking very active in the 80’s, in the heyday of slasher whose ancestor is this film. While comparing it’s better with the “House on the edge of the park,” Deodato, where we have a fairly similar story, delivered four years later. But this picture is superior to the work of the Italian master in terms of quality voltage and the number of violence and eroticism, the crazier Khoroshayev its visuals.\n\nDennis was able to remove the tension Heroks standard narrow genre, with the author’s vision of the filing, with the base on the real tragedy, with profound psychological everything happening, and seeing this movie involuntarily immersed in the whole atmosphere, considering the aspects of the code and tanatofobii own death in a common world view and perception reality, flirting with the knowledge and interpersonal relations amid confrontation and interaction invader and hostages. And despite the rather ancient year of the painting, such masterpieces are always topical. And if this movie was released in rent now, he not only would say a new word in the genre of slasher, restoring original without breaking traditional conventions, but also shocked the audience a lot stronger kakih-nibud “Funny Games” and “Eden Lake” looking absolutely nonsense against the true greatness of the genre.\n\nScreenshots:\n\nDownload:"
