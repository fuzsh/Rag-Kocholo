        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - A Lexington man has been released from prison 14 years after his wife’s death.\n\nThe Department of Public Advocacy confirms Donald Southworth was released from the Eastern Kentucky Correctional Complex in West Liberty on Monday.\n\nIn 2010, Southworth’s wife, Umi Southworth, was found naked and beaten behind their home. She died the next day from her injuries.\n\nIn 2012, a jury found Southworth guilty of murder, but the Kentucky Supreme Court overturned that conviction in 2014, saying that the evidence the prosecutors had presented was inadmissible.\n\nHe was later resentenced in 2016 after he took an Alford plea to manslaughter. An Alford plea means a defendant admits there is enough evidence to find them guilty while maintaining their innocence.\n\nSouthworth was sentenced to 15 years for manslaughter, including time served.\n\nAccording to the Department of Public Advocacy, Southworth was released after serving out his sentence, and it was not an early release.\n\nIn 2010, Darlene Thomas, executive director of GreenHouse17, was working in the same field. Now, 14 years later she’s thinking about those who were closest to Umi.\n\n“The family, the friends, her colleagues who were very much engaged after she lost her life to domestic violence homicide, I would just say you need to breathe, there’s things in the world you can’t control.” Thomas said.\n\nThomas said she’s shocked, but she encourages family and friends of Umi to celebrate her and her life during this time.\n\nSouthworth’s former defense attorney, Tucker Richardson, said the system isn’t perfect but in the end, it is somehow fair.\n\n“The system sometimes doesn’t work. But it is what it is. He ended up accepting the Alford plea, and now he served his time. That’s just the way it works.” Richardson said.\n\nThe case also sparked changes in how Lexington police handle cases like this. Officers on the scene presumed Umi Southworth was dead when they found her. So they did not call an ambulance.\n\nThree hours later, investigators discovered she was still alive. She died the next day at UK Hospital. Now, police policy requires all officers to call EMS to scenes of apparent homicides."
