        "text": "Original Title: Die Hinrichtung\n\nAlso Known As: Naked Massacre\n\nDirected by: Denis Héroux\n\nCat Out of the Bag Alert! This review contains spoilers for this film!\n\nSynopsis: Loosely based on the Richard Speck murders, an unstable American Vietnam deserter named Cain Adams (Mathieu Carrière) terrorizes a home full of female nurses.\n\nFeatured Feline: Living with the women in the house is a cream-colored Persian cat.\n\nThe cat is included in many scenes with the nurses and has a regular spot on the windowsill in the kitchen.\n\nThis comes into play when Adams breaks into the house through the kitchen window.\n\nHe pulls the cat back and closes the window before picking up the animal.\n\nSeveral times Adams picks up and cradles the cat after committing his horrific acts.\n\nThe cat is an unfortunate witness to the carnage.\n\nAdams again picks up the cat and lays down on a bed, not knowing the one victim he missed is hiding beneath.\n\nLater the cat is sitting in the window as police and reporters swarm the house.\n\nNear the end of the film, an officer left to guard the home shares his milk with the cat.\n\nFinal Mewsings: About the only redeeming thing about this movie is that the cat survives.\n\nMany thank to Mark Murton and Wahrhaftig for letting us know about the cat in this film.\n\nRelevant Links:"
