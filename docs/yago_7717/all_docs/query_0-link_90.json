        "text": "I: Introduction\n\nSome people take Facebook memes far too seriously. They also seem to think that the sharing of one meme, often done on a mere whim, encapsulates the essence of the sharer’s political thinking, rather than understanding that the meme is just one thought that passes through time, while a consistency of themes in memes would be a far better indicator of one’s political stance.\n\nOf course, a lot of the snarky comments one gets from having shared controversial Facebook memes these days comes from the heated political climate leading up to the US presidential elections in November. One the one hand, the liberals are trying to scare us into voting for Harris/Walz because if Trump gets four more years, that will be ‘the end of democracy,’ as if democracy is even a meaningful concept in our global capitalist, imperialist system, exacerbated by over forty years of neoliberalism.\n\nOn the other hand, some people on the left seem to be trivializing the problem of Trump if he becomes the next president. 2025 will be an…interesting year, it seems…\n\nII: A Trump Meme\n\nA Trump meme that I recently shared showed a colour photo of him in absurd-looking blue shorts, and beside it was a black-and-white photo of Hitler, also in shorts. Both of them were posed similarly, leaning. Regrettably, I no longer have access to the meme, and I can’t find it anywhere.\n\nThe meme includes a quote attributed to Mark Twain: “History does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Now, most people’s gut reaction to this meme will be to assume it’s equating Trump to Hitler, which is a little much, to put it mildly.\n\nI didn’t interpret the meaning of the meme that way. Note that rhyme means the middle to the end of the words in question sound the same, while the beginning of those words sounds different. Rhyming words can even have completely different spellings: day and weigh, do and threw, etc.\n\nMy point is that when history ‘rhymes,’ one isn’t experiencing the same things, but rather some things that are comparable. To be sure, Trump is no repeat of Hitler, but should a mere paralleling of some of their politics be thought so controversial, particularly thought so among leftists?\n\n[A second point to consider: the meme was a joke (i.e., the ridiculous shorts the two were wearing). As I said at the top of this article, some people take memes far too seriously.]\n\nIn order to highlight both differences between Trump and Hitler and the jocular nature of the meme, I added this quote by Marx at the top of my post: “Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.” I was obviously implying that Hitler corresponded to tragedy, and Trump corresponded to farce.\n\nAnyway, a few leftist Facebook friends of mine objected quite vehemently to my sharing of the meme. One woman in particular insisted quite stridently that Trump is not a fascist, but a clown. I agree with the second part of her objection; allow me to explain why I disagree with the first part.\n\nBefore I go into the reasons for why I see Trump as, if not a full-blown fascist, at least someone with fascist tendencies, I should remind you, Dear Reader, of the contemporary political context in which Trump has emerged. Fascism arises whenever capitalism is in crisis, and when the ruling class is worried that the restive working class is showing threatening signs of wanting to revolt. Fascism is used to beat the workers into submission.\n\nBourgeois liberal democracy is a sham. It’s a theatrical show meant to present the illusion that ordinary people have a say in how their government is run. Go to the voting booth, check the box next to the name of the candidate you want in office, and you’ve exercised your democratic freedom of choice. Then your country will be ruled by someone you think represents your interests for, depending on the country, four or however many years until the next election. Wow, what power to the people!\n\nAnyone who has been properly paying attention to what has been going on, especially for the past forty years, almost everywhere in the world, knows that the governments (especially in the US) have been increasingly representing the interests of the 1%, while ignoring the needs of the 99%, with more and more brazen blatancy.\n\nThis. Is. Not. Even. Remotely. Democratic.\n\nThere have been plenty of protests and demonstrations over the past ten to fifteen years or so, from the Occupy movement to Black Lives Matter. This is the sort of thing, due to neoliberalism‘s causing the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer, that makes the ruling class nervous. We’ve also seen an increasing militarization of the American police, and Trump has expressed a desire to ramp up even more police power on at least two occasions.\n\nA huge aspect of fascism is the settler-colonialist mentality, and the US–as well as my country, Canada, and Australia, New Zealand, Israel, etc.–is founded on the stealing of land from the indigenous peoples originally living there and killing all of those who resisted. Hitler’s ambition to go east and invade and colonize the Slavic countries, for the sake of lebensraum, was inspired by white Americans moving out west and taking more and more of the land away from the Native Americans, resulting in their genocide.\n\nFascists, thus, are more than just your garden-variety imperialists…they’re hyper-imperialists. Consider not only what I said above about Nazi lebensraum, but also fascist Italy’s invasions of African countries like Ethiopia in the 1930s. Just as Hitler wanted to make Germany great again, so did Mussolini want to make Italy great again. Sound familiar?\n\nWhile most recent American presidents have timidly concealed their imperialist ambitions under the obvious lie that they want to bring ‘freedom and democracy’ to ‘tyrannical regimes’ that often just so happened also to be sitting on lots of oil, Trump, with respect to Venezuela and Syria, has made no attempt to cover up his coveting of their oil. One of the main purposes of territorial expansion, be it of an overtly fascist nature or not, is to take the natural resources of the land one conquers and to enrich one’s own nation with them. In this, we can see a connection between Trump and fascism, but more connections are to follow, if you’ll bear with me, Dear Reader, in another digression.\n\nIII: Liberalism and Fascism\n\nAnother part of the context in which fascism should be seen is its place on the continuum of all political ideologies. In my article, The Ouroboros of Dialectical Materialism, I imagined a circular continuum symbolized by the ouroboros, on which two opposite extremes meet and phase into each other–the serpent’s head biting its tail, and all other points on its coiled body corresponding to the intermediate points on the continuum. Fascism would be the biting head, and communism would be the bitten tail…not because the two ideologies are similar or identical (Of course not! They’re diametrical opposites! I’m not doing some idiotic horseshoe theory here!), but because the one is a reaction against the other (e.g., part of Nazi Germany became East Germany).\n\nIn that article, I also said that one could superimpose the four-way political compass on the ouroboros, so that–as I pointed out above–fascism and other far-right forms of government would be in the top-right corner, towards and including the serpent’s biting head, and communism and other far-left ideologies would be in the top-left corner, towards and including the serpent’s bitten tail. Anarchism and social democracy would be in the bottom-left, and right-wing libertarianism and other moderate right-wingers would be in the bottom-right. It would seem that social democrats and other liberals would be far from fascism.\n\nPolitical matters aren’t that simple, though. Another thing I pointed out in that article is that there is a tendency to slide counter-clockwise from the tail all the way along the coiled body of the ouroboros to the biting head. Over the past forty to fifty years, we’ve seen just such a slide from, for example, the centrist Johnson years of ‘The Great Society‘ and ‘The War on Poverty‘ (all while dishonestly escalating the Vietnam War and brutally fighting the Cold War in its other aspects, don’t forget), to the neoliberal revolution of Reagan and Thatcher, which began the unravelling of such things as welfare capitalism in favour of the ‘free market,’ and thence to the current immiseration of the poor and the ruling class flirting with fascism (Ukraine, Trump, the Gaza genocide, etc.).\n\nStalin once said, “Social-Democracy is objectively the moderate wing of fascism.” This may seem, on the surface, to be a rather extreme point of view, but consider the liberal slide to the right that I described in the previous paragraph. Liberals are ‘progressive’ during good times, but they’ll sway to the right either during bad times, or if progressive policies go against their class interests. With the dissolution of the socialist states by the early 1990s, no one in the capitalist West, including liberals, had a fear of left-wing revolution, so there was no more incentive to keep alive such things as the welfare state or a diversified media.\n\nAnd since imperialism is a crucial part of late stage capitalism, the Western ruling class is concerned about the rise of Russia and China. These countries threaten the class interests of the Western ruling class, which again includes the liberals. This is the real reason behind the banging of the war drums against countries like Russia and China.\n\nAccordingly, to counter Russia’s rise, the CIA helped orchestrate a coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014, ousting the democratically-elected, pro-Russian and anti-IMF Viktor Yanukovych and replacing his government with one including Nazi sympathizers. Recall what I said before about the capitalist class using fascism during capitalist crises in order to hold on to power. This is exactly what the Western NATO imperialists have been doing, having used these Ukrainian Nazis to provoke Russia for eight years with violence against ethnic Russians in the Donbas, forcing Putin–who between 2014 and late February 2022, did all he could to secure a peace deal with uncooperative people on the other side–to intervene in Ukraine.\n\nOf course, the Western media have either downplayed if not outright denied or ignored the influence of Nazis in the Ukrainian government and military, but that country has had a history of Nazi sympathizers, nurtured by the capitalist West, ever since WWII. And since much of our current Russophobia is being kindled by liberals, including many in Hollywood, then we can see how liberalism–the farthest left of which is social democracy–can cozy up with fascism.\n\nNow, if liberals can embrace fascism, why wouldn’t conservatives like Trump (a former Democrat, by the way)? The point is that liberals can, and often do, shift to the right, even to the point of fascism if it will further their own interests. Mussolini was a socialist in his youth, then he shifted to the right (with Britain’s influence, to keep Italy in WWI) and established fascism as an ideology.\n\nCharleton Heston was a civil rights supporting liberal, then he shifted to the right and supported the NRA. Trump, as I said above, was a Democrat for a while before running as a Republican. One grows more conservative as one gets older, right? Well, if one has lots of capital to protect.\n\nConservatives are already closer on the political spectrum to fascism than liberals are, so if the latter can come to sympathize with the far right, then it’s all the easier for conservatives to come that way. Left and right politics aren’t a dichotomy of ‘them’ vs ‘us,’ but a continuum where anyone can slide the one way to the other, given the right material conditions.\n\nIV: Trump and Fascism\n\nNow that we’ve established the political, historical, and material contexts behind which someone like Trump can be seen as at least fascist-leaning, let’s see some actual things he’s done that indicate contributions to the general fascist agenda.\n\nI’ve already explained the fascist nature of much of the current Ukrainian government. Trump sold millions of dollars worth of Javelin missiles to Ukraine. He may have hesitated at first, only agreeing when he was convinced it would be good for US business, but still, he did have them sold. Hitler also had big business backers because they knew supporting Nazi Germany would be good for business. Fascism is hyper-capitalism and hyper-imperialism. At the end of the day, it’s all about good business.\n\nOf course, Trump was not unique in giving aid to Ukraine: Obama may have never sent the Javelins, but his administration sent other forms of aid to Ukraine–millions of dollars in security assistance. And the Biden administration has sent in billions in aid. My saying that Trump was not unique in sending aid to Ukraine is for the same reason that I’m saying Trump is not unique among US politicians in having fascist tendencies. I’m just establishing that Trump is very much a part of the general fascist trajectory that world politics are moving unswervingly towards.\n\nThe point is that if Trump were truly not a fascist, but just ‘a clown,’ he wouldn’t have sold those Javelins to Ukraine at all. He and his supporters like to portray him as anti-war; he’s boasted that as soon as he becomes president again, he’ll immediately end the war in Ukraine. I call bullshit on that. His boast is just the typical empty promise of a politician to get votes. The US and NATO are in too deep in Ukraine to get out; they’ve invested so many billions of dollars in it. Trump couldn’t pull out even if he wanted to, and I’d say it’s a safe bet he doesn’t want to. After all, with the sale of the Javelins, war with Ukraine is good for US business, isn’t it? Trump has owned stock in defence contractors like Raytheon. He knows that war is where the money is.\n\nHe may not have started any new wars in his administration, but he never ended any, either. He almost started a war with Iran by having Soleimani assassinated, and his administration attempted a ‘Bay of Pigs’ style coup on the Venezuelan government, to get all that oil, as I mentioned above.\n\nWar is a business, and Trump is a businessman; he isn’t anti-war.\n\nWhere his fascist tendencies are at their most obvious are in his ‘America first’ rhetoric and his discriminatory wish to keep out the Latin Americans with his wall. What should also be obvious is the fact that Obama was the ‘Deporter-in-Chief,‘ Hillary spoke of the need to have a ‘barrier’ to keep out ‘illegals,’ Biden has been pretty much as harsh in his dealing with ‘illegals’ (who might not have been pouring through the southern US border if not for the US government’s immiseration of Latin Americans in their home countries via such tactics as economic sanctions and replacing democratically-elected leftist governments with authoritarian right-wing ones, thus forcing the desperate poor to try their luck in the US), and that Kamala Harris promises to be even stricter with border security than Trump (and as a prosecutor who fought to keep non-violent offenders, and even innocent men, in jail, she can be trusted to keep her promise).\n\nAgain, I’m not saying Trump is unique in his anti-immigrant positions. He’s part of a general trend toward the far right. The point is that he isn’t outside of the fascist problem, and it’s absurd to say he is outside of it. The real difference between him and the other members of the fascist-leaning establishment is that when they discuss the problem of ‘illegals’ going into the US, they use polite language, whereas when Trump discusses it, he uses the bluntest, rudest language he can muster.\n\nNext, we have to deal with an issue that would make Trump undoubtedly a dictator…if it really comes to be. Has all of this talk about Project 2025 been a real, legitimate worry, or is it just scaremongering in the media?\n\nFirst of all, nothing in the manifesto of Project 2025 should be of any surprise. We’ve all known that the conservative agenda has always been about returning the US to the reactionary politics of the 1950s and earlier. We all know how reactionary Trump is, that his name is brought up many times in that manifesto, and many of the people involved in devising Project 2025 are associated with Trump (like the Heritage Foundation), which all implies that if he’s elected, he surely would enact much, if not all, of the backward policies of the manifesto (despite his attempts to distance himself from it, assuredly to prevent a loss of votes). His adding of conservative Supreme Court justices led to the overturning of Roe vs Wade [which the Dems have never shown any serious interest in codifying], so his enacting of Project 2025 is no idle threat. (Recall that the underestimating of Hitler was a factor in his rise to power.)\n\nOn the other hand, it should be obvious to everyone that the Democratic Party is just using Project 2025 to scare liberals into voting for Kamala Harris, even if they don’t like her (they shouldn’t, for the reasons I’ve given above and will give later). Since there’s no real choice for progressives to vote for in the corrupt two-party system (and as promising as the likes of Jill Stein are, even if she miraculously wins the election, the ruling class won’t allow her to make the needed reforms to the system), then the Democrats have to resort to slimy lesser-evil voting again.\n\nLiberals be libbing again. Oh, dear…\n\nOther things that suggest that Trump could be reaching for dictatorial powers, it seems, include his saying, about one hour into a speech he did for his Christian followers, that if he’s voted into office, they’ll never need to vote again. Now, did he mean this, or is it just another of the many examples of verbal flatulence we’re so used to hearing from him (e.g, his claiming that ‘extreme left, Marxist Democrats‘ want to allow abortions as late as when the baby is actually born)? Surely, the Democrats are also using these words of his to scare people into voting blue, regardless of what he actually meant in saying them.\n\nThen there was the tweet he sent, with Grieg’s “In the Hall of the Mountain King” as an eerie, dramatic soundtrack, showing Trump as president not just for 2024, but also 2028, 2032, 2036,…etc., going well into and beyond the 22nd century. Is this to imply a dynasty of Trumps, with his sons, grandsons, etc., to succeed him? That tweet, if anything, comes across as trolling, provocation for the mere fun of it, and suggests, to me, a collusion with the Democrats to scare people into voting blue. Trump has always been used as controlled opposition by the ruling class.\n\nFinally, there was that botched assassination attempt…or (deliberately?) botched security…of Trump, attempted by a kid who makes a Star Wars stormtrooper seem a marksman by comparison. Lots of conspiracy theories are floating around online in response to that debacle, almost as spastic as the January 6th farce. Is Trump, if elected, nonetheless going to use that ‘attempt on his life‘ to give himself emergency powers?\n\nThe main factor that would allow Trump to assume dictatorial powers is if he has enough followers, enough muscle, to help him do it. He didn’t have enough of it, as was obviously demonstrated in that pathetic, unarmed January 6th attempt (the Nazi Beer Hall putsch was more of something to take seriously). Since the excesses and incompetence of the Biden administration, I can imagine a lot more Americans siding with Trump. The fascist-leaning types tend to work out in the gym and get military training far more than us on the left, sadly, so there’s more of a possibility of a putsch this time.\n\nIf Trump tries to take over, the CIA–in their wish to maintain the veneer of democracy that the masses need to have some sense of hope and thus stave off revolution–could try to have him killed and make it look as if he died of old age; the conspiracy theorists would have a field day, of course, but the ‘official’ explanation sent out in the mainstream media would probably drown out all of the Trumpers’ cries of foul play. Many attempts on Hitler’s life were made, and any more attempts on Trump’s life would reinforce our sense that he’ll have assumed dictatorial powers. But again, any success or failure in such attempts would depend in large part on how many followers Trump will have to make his fascism a reality.\n\nV: Kamala is NO Alternative to Trump\n\nAnother meme I shared on Facebook that gave me some static was one of Kamala Harris wearing a necklace resembling one costing $62,000. It’s assumed that she’s wearing the exact same necklace, having paid that much for it. The meme has her say, “Hello, fellow working class people…Today is the day I hope you will donate.”\n\nShit-lib supporters of her naturally got upset and not only said the usual nonsense of not voting for her equalling voting for Trump, as well as doubting that the necklaces were the same. I personally couldn’t care less if the necklaces are the same or not. I don’t generally take memes literally, as I didn’t in the case of the Trump/Hitler meme discussed above. As far as I’m concerned, it’s what the expensive necklace represents: she, as vice president and thus in with the ruling class, is in no way connected with the working class. It isn’t really about how much money she makes (though, incidentally, she has a net worth of $8 million as of 2024); it’s about which class she’s affiliated with.\n\nAs with Trump/Vance, Harris/Walz support Israel, the racist, apartheid regime that’s been murdering Gazans by the tens of thousands–at least between 35,000 and 40,000 since October 7th, which was NOT the beginning of this nightmare. This ongoing genocide is a red line, and that’s all the reason anyone needs not to vote either red or blue. It doesn’t matter how much more of a ‘Hitler’ Trump either seems or actually is: the Biden/Harris administration is already more than fascist enough, and Ms. “I’m speaking!” has made it clear that she plans to keep things the way they are in Gaza.\n\nBy a sad irony, members of the same ethnic group that were victimized by fascism back in WWII are now, and have been since a few years after that war ended, the fascist victimizers in their settler-colonialist ethnocracy. Now, this is not to give credence to the idea that Israel somehow rules the US and therefore the world, an idea whose antisemitic overtones should be obvious. As I explained in more detail in this post, it’s the Western imperialist powers that use Israel as a crucial ally in the Middle East, an extremely important region for globally strategic reasons (as well as for all that oil!), to protect their interests. Back when he still had all his marbles (and was just as evil back then as he is today), Biden said the quiet part out loud here about the true relationship between Israel and the US…and by extension, the rest of the Anglo-American/NATO empire.\n\nSo, Kamala Harris, by continuing what Biden was doing, is thoroughly entrenched in the system, supporting not only Zionism (as many non-Jews–especially evangelical Christians–do, and many Jews oppose) but also the entire neoliberal agenda as well as the system of incarceration as discussed above. This entrenchment is the real reason for her rise to prominence in politics, not competence, of which people with discerning eyes and ears can find no evidence. The fact that she’s a woman of colour is also helpful to the ruling class, for while she’ll dutifully do all their bidding, her appearance as a non-white male creates the illusion–as it did with Obama–that her election will further racial equality.\n\nAs I said almost eight years ago in this article, it isn’t the women at the top (or the people of colour up there, for that matter) who count, but those at the bottom who do, for there are so many more down there than those at the top. Who do we want to raise up to a level of dignity, a small minority of people, or the great majority of them?\n\nBecause of Kamala’s willingness to prostitute herself to the system (I need use the word ‘prostitute’ only in a metaphorical sense), she’s never needed actual ability to get as far as she has in her career, in spite of the words of those who insist that, because of that career, she must be competent. For these reasons, I feel I can speak most bluntly about her in a way that should not at all be controversial.\n\nShe is a total airhead.\n\nAll one needs to do to see the truth of this is to watch the many video clips of her doing that ditzy cackle and engaging in her many word salads. One cannot reduce the word salads to the occasional gaffe, of which even the best speakers have the bad luck of doing once in a while. She’s done way too many of these–it’s a habit with her.\n\nBiden was showing clear signs of dementia back in 2020, and surely those working with him, and helping him with his election campaign then, knew of this problem better than anyone else. His ability when younger was no longer relevant; he was put against Trump because he was associated with Obama, whose charm had been missed after four years of Trump. Biden is a Zionist and a whore for the system, too; his current incompetence had been irrelevant, as far as the ruling class was concerned, until it was exposed in his debate with Trump. Kamala’s incompetence is similarly irrelevant: as long as she furthers the interests of the ruling class, that’s good enough for them.\n\nVI: Conclusion\n\nSo, in answer to that one woman’s objection that Trump is a clown: yes, he is a clown, of course (look at his hair and at his orange face, and listen to his ridiculous bragging about all the amazing things he promises he’ll do; listen, also, to his bizarre statements about the ‘extreme left, Marxist Democrats’–something, incidentally, that only a far-right extremist would think about the largely centre-right Dems). He isn’t the only clown, though.\n\nJoe Biden is a clown–at least, his dementia has turned him into one. Kamala Harris is a clown (cackling, word salads). In fact, Hitler was a clown (the toothbrush mustache and the more-or-less bowl haircut, to say nothing of his weird conceptions of the state of world politics of his time). Mussolini was a clown. We need to remember, though, that clowns, just like Pennywise, can be scary as well as funny.\n\nA female troll who gave me a hard time about the memes I’d shared that criticized Kamala asked me, in all snarkiness, if I was even American (I’m Canadian), as if anyone outside of her sacred country has any right to say anything about the election in November. We’re talking here about a country with hundreds of military bases around the world. This is a country that orchestrates, or at least helps to orchestrate, coup after coup in other countries to ensure the latter have governments friendly to the interests of the former. This country sells weapons and gives aid to countries that commit genocides (Israel on Gaza, Saudi Arabia on Yemen–granted, my country’s government has been guilty of giving the offending countries aid, too, and I don’t have any more love of the Canadian government than I do of that of the US). The US has been engaging in nuclear brinksmanship with Russia and China, bringing us all dangerously close to WWIII. To suggest that as a non-American, I have no business criticizing her government is extremely arrogant of her.\n\nWhat goes on in the US does not happen in isolation from the rest of the world. The American government’s foreign policy is a poison to the entire world, so yes, we citizens of the rest of the planet, no matter how far away we live from the US, have not only every right to voice our opinions about this upcoming election…we have the duty to do so!\n\nUltimately, it doesn’t matter whether Trump, if elected, goes balls-out fascist on us, or if all that talk about Project 2025, ‘[Christians] will never have to vote again,’ and ‘Trump 4eva’ is just trolling and scaremongering to manipulate Americans into voting Democrat. The US has already been lapsing into fascism whether red or blue (the surveillance state, the wish for mass deportations, class collaboration in the form of simping for billionaires, the enabling of genocide, etc.), and the trajectory towards even more fascism, regardless of a Trump win or a Harris win, will assuredly continue, be it a faster or slower move farther to the right.\n\nThe US, founded on settler-colonialism (as, to be fair, is my country, Canada, and many others, no less so), the enslavement of blacks, and the genocide of the aboriginals, in which a small minority of people hoard most of the wealth, cannot reasonably be called a democracy. There’s no threat of losing a democracy that never even existed in the first place.\n\nThe problem won’t be solved by voting in the ‘better’ candidate. The problem will be solved by smashing the system the injustice is based on and replacing it with a new one, to serve the people. Doing so will be extremely difficult, if not bordering on impossible–I have no illusions about that–but it’s the only way.\n\nIn an accelerationist sense, a Trump win, with him assuming dictatorial powers, could cause just the outrage needed to motivate the people into rising up in revolution. I’m not hoping for such an outcome in the election, of course. For just as his move for those powers depends on him having enough people to back him, our success in revolution, in response to him doing that or otherwise, will depend on us having enough people to back us. Are there enough of us?\n\nHere are Parts I, II, III, IV, and V, if you haven’t read them yet.\n\nXXVI: The Circle Closes\n\nIn this chapter, we return to the involvement of Tom Rogan and Audra in the story. In fact, the first two sections of this chapter are named Tom and Audra (pages 1278 and 1283). Both of these characters are having nightmares.\n\nTom’s dream is fascinating in how he’s seeing everything through the eyes of a similar psychopath, teen Henry. First, he sees himself pressing the button on the switchblade and stabbing Butch Bowers in the neck. Then, he sees himself in the sewers with Victor and Belch, chasing the Losers (page 1279).\n\nIt’s fitting that Tom should see himself as Henry, not just because both are abusive, but also because both were abused…by their fathers. One crucial difference, though, is that–as despicable as Tom is–he wouldn’t kill: he didn’t kill, and wouldn’t have killed, his father as Henry did, so seeing himself about to commit patricide is more than disturbing for him.\n\nWe recall the many patterns and parallels of abusive relationships in the novel: Al/Tom vs Beverly, Eddie vs his mom/Myra, Butch vs Henry, Eddie Corcoran vs his father, and Henry’s gang vs the Losers. What’s important in emphasizing the parallels between Tom and Henry is how both were abused by their fathers, so both learned that one ‘solves’ relationship problems through power and control in the form of abuse. To reinforce the parallel between Tom’s and Henry’s fathers, both fathers have alliterative names–Ralph Rogan, and Butch Bowers (page 1278).\n\nJust as Tom imagined, from what he’d learned about getting “whoppins” if his younger brother and sisters–put in his charge from a young age–ever did wrong, he now imagines that the kids he’s chasing in the sewers need “a whoppin” (pages 1278-1279).\n\nTom’s fear of his father, just like teen Henry’s fear of his, is enough to make his killing of Ralph unthinkable…just as coward Henry’s would have been, had Henry not lived in the Trauma-town of Derry. So with Tom’s entrance into Trauma-town, now he is having the same unconscious murderous phantasies as every other resident there. His nightmare is actually wish-fulfillment.\n\nChasing the Losers in the sewers is also wish-fulfillment for Tom, since little Bev is one of the people being chased. All of these parallels of abusers and abused, especially when embodied in people within the city limits of Derry, reflect how It personifies not just the violent aspects of the Shadow, but of the Collective Shadow in general.\n\nTom deems the sewers to be a smelly purgatory (page 1279), which they are, since as representations of the unconscious mind, they can purge one of one’s trauma (i.e., through Jungian Shadow work and Active Imagination), provided that one navigates these passages correctly and has the courage to face It head on, as the young Losers, under Bill’s leadership, are trying to do.\n\nTom, like Henry, does not have the strength of character to be able to face his dark sides, so even dreaming about doing so is too much for him (page 1280). Just as Al, who recall had just been chasing after Bev out of suspicions that she’d been messing around with boys, so is Tom now chasing her out of suspicions that she’s fooling around with one of them, Bill, and has been sneaking (phallic) smokes. It’s easier to project aggression and wield control over her than to control himself, therefore it’s easy to equate Tom with Henry.\n\nTom wakes up, and for a moment he isn’t sure if he’s awake or still dreaming (page 1281), since he thinks he’s seeing one of Pennywise’s balloons. He also gets the feeling that this has been more than just a nightmare: after all, the unconscious is a world of a much deeper and higher truth–this is why surrealism is called what it is called.\n\nLike Henry, Tom is also hearing voices (page 1282). He’s hearing a voice from a balloon tied to the knob of the bathroom door. The voice is telling him to give Beverly and the other Losers “a whoppin“. Hypnotized by the voice no less than Henry has been, Tom obeys Its commands and gets dressed (page 1283).\n\nAs I said above, Audra is also having bad dreams. Like Tom, she feels as though she’s in some strange place, and in a different body.\n\nThat would be the body of little Beverly in the sewers, being chased by Henry, Victor, and Belch.\n\nBill is with her, which is fitting, since Audra has been pursuing Bill to Derry. Recall that, when Bill is about to make love with Beverly, he notes how Audra looks like her, so what we have in these shared dreams and experiences are examples of synchronicity.\n\nIn Audra’s dream, she-as-Bev is holding his hand, reminding us of his adulterous lovemaking with her, as well as Bev’s cheating on Tom, with whose cuckoldry we of course have no sympathy. We do feel bad for Audra, though, especially when we consider what’s soon to happen to her.\n\nThem all experiencing the sewers, whether in dream or as a distant, repressed memory, or the soon-to-be-experienced second confrontation with It as adults, is an experience of the sewers as the collective unconscious, where all minds merge. Audra feels the terror of the experience (page 1284) because it’s the terror of the Shadow.\n\nThe terror is so vivid that she hears the voice of Pennywise telling her that they all float down there after she wakes up and finds herself in bed in a hotel room in the Derry area (pages 1284-1286). She calls the Derry Town House to contact Bill, and the annoyed clerk wonders why so many calls for Bill have to happen that night (page 1287). Bill isn’t in his room because he has to deal with Eddie, as we’ll soon see; but Audra’s getting suspicions that her husband is with another woman (which of course he is–pages 1287-1288). And we can see again just how synchronistic events are getting.\n\nAs she’s trying to calm down and reassure herself that, after a bad dream, her suspicions are just over-reactions, she sees the bathroom light go on, and she hears that voice say, “We all float down here, Audra” (page 1288). The TV turns on, and she sees Pennywise.\n\nTerrified, she races out of her room and out of the hotel to the parking lot, the only thing on her mind being finding Bill in the Derry Town House (page 1289). She finds her rented Datsun, not knowing the significance of it being parked nose-to-nose with the LTD wagon Tom Rogan is using (pages 1289-1290). He’s been in the car, having been goaded by It to go there no less than she’s been.\n\nShe feels his hand on her shoulder, it forcing her to turn around. He recognizes her as an actress in the movies, then he kidnaps her and takes her to the very sewers she’s just been dreaming of.\n\nWe can see why this chapter is named “The Circle Closes.” So many separate strands are being brought together here. Not just the return of the adult Losers to Derry to be reunited with Mike, not just the three uninvited guests of Tom, Audra, and Henry being added to the mix, but there’s also the back-and-forth between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s and the parallelism of these moments. Finally, there’s a kind of merging of the past and present and of inside and outside of Derry, through the unconscious world of dreams…and therefore a fusion of conscious and unconscious.\n\nFully understood, It narrates the story of a universe where all is one. Different people, even those living far away from each other, are united in one consciousness. The past and present are one. Good and evil are juxtaposed, and therefore one. Wildly differing actions are united through the non-causal, but meaningful coincidences of synchronicity. And the meeting place of all of these separate strands is the collective unconscious, the Collective Shadow, as symbolized by the hellish, smelly, filthy, dark sewer system under Derry.\n\nIn the section, Eddie’s Room, beginning on page 1290, Bev and Bill get dressed after receiving the call and go to Eddie’s room. Eddie’s arm is broken again, after the fight with Henry–again, we see the present paralleling the past.\n\nThey can’t tell the police about dead Henry, for Eddie will be charged with murder in a town that looks the other way whenever real evil happens (pages 1292-1292). There’s no proof of Eddie killing in self-defense, for Henry’s knife is gone.\n\nThey call Richie and Ben, who will arrive right away (page 1293). They try calling Mike, who of course isn’t at home, so they try the library, too. Instead of Mike answering the phone, the Chief of Police answers, and he tells Beverly that Mike is at the Derry Home Hospital, having been “assaulted and badly wounded a short time ago” (page 1294). Since she doesn’t want to tell the cop who she is and what she knows of the assault, he starts to suspect her, being someone who is oddly calling the library so late at night (page 1295).\n\nWith Beverly’s stress over the cop’s suspicions, we come to another major theme coalescing here from the experiences of many of the characters: guilt, and accompanying guilt, the fear of being caught in the guilty act. We’ve already dealt with Bill’s guilt over the murder of Georgie, which as I explained in previous parts is based on unconscious wish-fulfillment. Now, there’s Bill’s guilt over cheating on Audra with Bev…and Audra’s on her way, with suspicions of him!\n\nThere’s the guilt that Eddie’s mom tried to impose on him for hanging out with friends she didn’t want him to be with. There’s the guilt Al was imposing on little Bev (via his abuse of her) for hanging out with boys.\n\nThere’s also the guilt of having really done things (regardless of whether or not they really should be deemed bad) that others disapprove of. Bill was really cheating on Audra. Bev has really cheated on Tom with Bill. Little Bev really had sexual relations with all of the kid Losers, just as her dad feared.\n\nAudra is trying to find the husband she rightly suspects of cheating on her. Tom is trying to find the wife he correctly suspects of cheating with Bill. Al chased after little Bev suspecting (correctly, as I’ve argued above) that her hymen is gone. The cop rightly suspects that Beverly knows a lot more about the circumstances of the assault on Mike than she’s letting on.\n\nGuilt and the fear of punishment (regardless of whether or not that punishment is deserved) are manifestations of the traumatic feelings all of these characters are having, and having them all coalesce right now–with either dreams of, memories of, or plans of going very soon to the sewers–is significant because of how the sewers symbolize the unconscious, that place where everything merges into one.\n\nOf course, there’s also the guilt of the actual antagonists of the novel: Pennywise, Al Marsh, Tom, Henry and his gang, Eddie Cocoran’s abusive father, Eddie Kaspbrak’s mom, the homophobic killers of Adrian Mellon, etc.–not that any of them feel much of any remorse for their actions, since it’s their positions of power and/or authority that makes them feel immune to remorse. Still, guilt–whether acknowledged or not–has its home, among all the other negative, rejected feelings, in the sewers.\n\nTo get back to the phone call with the Chief of Police, Beverly is worried that Henry’s assault on Mike could kill him (pages 1295-1296). This fear is tied in with her guilt, since her not telling the cop what she knows about Henry is obstructing the investigation.\n\nShe hangs up on the cop, and looks over at Henry’s corpse, which has one eye closed and the other open (page 1296), this opened eye oozing blood from its injury. He seems “to be winking at her,” adding to her guilt, fear, and sense that It, like her father and living Henry, are all coming to get her. Of course they are: they’re all one in Pennywise.\n\nThe Losers need to know how Mike is doing, so Richie calls the hospital, but pretends to be a news reporter, so he and his friends won’t be linked to the assault on Mike and the killing of Henry (pages 1296-1297). Richie calls himself “Mr. Kerpaskian,” which the one on the other end understands to be a “Czech-Jewish” name. After hanging up and finishing his act, Richie curses “Jesus!” four times. The “Czech-Jewish” name he assumed for himself must have made him think of suicide-Stan, and therefore must have given him the feeling that all the Losers were about to destroy themselves.\n\nWith the fear of being linked to all of this violence and therefore of being arrested, they all decide immediately to go to the Barrens and face It in the sewers (page 1298). As they’re driving over there, the car radio is playing the kind of classic, mid-to-late 1950s rock ‘n’ roll that they as kids would have heard all the time: “Be-Bop-A-Lula,” Buddy Holly, and “Summertime Blues.”\n\nThe problem is that Pennywise gets involved, reminding Richie of his “All-Dead Rock Show” that he saw near the Paul Bunyan statue (page 1299). Everyone wants the radio turned off, especially Bill when he hears the voice of Georgie blaming him for being murdered by Pennywise (page 1300).\n\nThey arrive at the Barrens, and already a number of things to parallel the late 1950s experience have arrived: assaults by Henry, Eddie’s broken arm, the Fifties music, and the rain and thunder (pages 1299-1300). Ben is to lead them past the old clubhouse to the pumping station’s concrete cylinder (pages 1301-1302), though Ben can hardly be expected to remember where it is after twenty-seven years. He is leading them just as he did the last time. Bill is stuttering just as he did as a kid.\n\nAll of these parallels, just as with the previous chapter’s mid-sentence transitions back and forth between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s, are indications of the unity between the past and the present in It, how everything is one in It.\n\nThe cylinder is “almost completely buried in a wallow of blackberry bushes” (page 1302), suggesting the obscure, repressed nature of unconscious feelings; yet the iron manhole cover has been pushed off, Ben assuming that its removal has been fairly recent (page 1303). Has Pennywise removed it, to lure the Losers in?\n\nIn a sense, Pennywise did. There are fresh scratches, those of someone who has gone in recently. With matches that Richie brought from Eddie’s room, they light up the darkness. Bill sees a strap…the strap of Audra’s purse (pages 1303-1304). This is where Tom–possessed by Pennywise–has taken her.\n\nBill can’t believe Audra’s here–she should be in England. He imagines what he’s seeing is another one of Pennywise’s illusions…but it isn’t. He looks through the contents of her purse (page 1305), and he sees things too accurately hers to be a mere illusion. She’s really down there in the sewers!\n\nThat Bill is wondering–since Henry, Victor, and Belch are all dead (Hockstetter, too, recall)–who could have got Audra down into the sewers (page 1305), and no one concludes that it was Pennywise who got her, adds weight to my speculation that It is a metaphor rather than an actual entity in the story. They of course don’t know that Tom is the one who got her.\n\nThe Losers go down the cylinder, Bill praying to God that Audra is all right (page 1306). Going back to the guilt/fear-of-reprisals motif discussed above, he is worrying that Audra’s abduction could be punishment for his adultery with Beverly, or even his fooling around with her when they were kids.\n\nBill starts having vivid memories of the underground place once he feels the cold water down below–the feel and the smell, the sense of claustrophobia…and yet, he forgets one of the most important memories…how did they get out?\n\nXXVII: Under the City\n\nSince we’re going into the sewers for the final confrontation with It, and the sewers symbolize the unconscious, where the secrets of everything live, and where all is one, it is fitting finally to have a glimpse of things from Its perspective.\n\nDerry, that is, up above in the sunlight, is representative of the conscious mind–always trying to look good in public, cheerful and pleasant, what Jung would have called the Persona. Derry also hides its slimy underbelly, fittingly, in the sewers, just as the Persona tries to hide the Shadow.\n\nBut now that we’re down in those sewers, what is dark is coming to light–thanks to those matches that Richie took from Eddie’s room, to the extent that they’re of much use.\n\nAs It, in August 1958, comes to realize that there’s something new about–namely, those potentially threatening kids–It contemplates Its place in the universe, and Its relationship with the Turtle (page 1307). Recall that the Turtle corresponds to God, or Ahura Mazda, the principle of light, the spirit, and goodness, however one prefers to conceptualize Maturin. Recall also that It, a giant spider, corresponds to Satan, Angra Mainyu, or the principle of darkness, the flesh, and evil.\n\nJust as Satan’s first sin was pride, leading him to believe that he could run the universe better than God, so does It think of the Turtle as stupid and passive, never leaving its shell. It may have vomited out the entire universe at the dawn of creation, but it hasn’t done much since then. Many people–that is, those who believe God exists but aren’t religious–tend to think similarly of Him.\n\nThe Turtle withdrew into its shell, and It came to Earth, to Derry, to be the god of this world as Satan is understood to be (2 Corinthians 4:4). Here’s an interesting quote from It: “It had created a place in Its own image, and It looked upon this place with favor from the deadlights which were Its eyes” (page 1307), reminding us of Genesis 1:26 and Genesis 1:31. Such a quote suggests a Gnostic interpretation of the God of Creation, a Satanic Demiurge creating the physical world, as opposed to Maturin’s spiritual world, one hidden in its shell.\n\nIt finds there to be, in the imagination of these kids coming into the sewers to confront It, both good and bad qualities. For It, their imagination is good in how their fear gives them a good taste when It eats them. Their imagination can be bad, however, when it is used against It, as it was used when Beverly fired the silver projectiles at It, hurting It and causing It to feel fear, a new experience that It doesn’t like. So in this, we see yet another example of the good/bad duality in the novel.\n\nIt doesn’t like change. It wants a reliable, cyclical world in which It wakes, eats, and sleeps in a state of hibernation for twenty-seven years before repeating the cycle. In bravely facing It and proving that It can be hurt, the kids have broken the routine.\n\nThis breaking of Its cyclical routine, of introducing change and the new element that It can be hurt, defeated, and even killed, has brought to Its attention the notion of an Other. No, It is not the centre of the universe, where everything else, like the Turtle, is stupid, timidly hiding, and exists only in terms of its relationship with It.\n\nThis “Other” that It is so worried about (page 1309) sounds a lot like Lacan’s notion of the Other, as opposed to an other that exists only as a narcissistic, metaphorical mirror of oneself, rather than a distinct entity in its own right. Such independent entities are what is so threatening to it, for as existing outside of It, they can take away Its power and control. The hurt that It has felt from the silver projectile is narcissistic injury. It is afraid of not being alone (page 1309), because not being alone means sharing the world with others, a break from the narcissistic world of a dyadic relationship in which the ‘other’ is really oneself reflected to oneself like the image in a mirror.\n\nThis is all significant when seen in light of how I interpreted the murder of Georgie. Recall how I said that the tearing-off of Georgie’s arm is a symbolic castration, the little boy’s traumatic need to leave the dyadic mother-to-son relationship and enter the larger society, to go from other to Other (see Part I, section III).\n\nIt is fitting that the first killing in the novel, George, should be thematically linked with its last killing, the destroying of It. It, as I’ve always said, personifies trauma, and the Oedipus complex, properly understood, is the ultimate, universal, narcissistic trauma in which a child has to give up his or her perceived ‘ownership‘ of the desired parent, to accept sharing him or her (and by extension, all people) with others.\n\nThough It has lived since the beginning of the universe, vomited out by the Turtle (which is, as the creator of the universe, its ‘mother,’ in effect), It has the personality of a child–selfish, grasping, impetuous, and violent if he doesn’t get his way. By feeding off of children’s fears, It is projecting Its inadequacies onto them.\n\nGeorgie is a sweetheart compared to babyish It.\n\nIt hopes to defeat the kids by having them see “the deadlights of Its eyes” (page 1309, King’s emphasis), by having them “cast […] one by one into the macroverse“.\n\nIn Stephen King’s cosmology, the macroverse is the home of It and Maturin, probably created by Gan, a much higher and more powerful being than the other two–‘God’ in a far truer sense that I conceived Maturin of being (which was really just to contrast the Turtle with Satanic It, in the dualist sense), and the Other that It fears (see above). Gan emerged from primordial Chaos and is a character in King’s Dark Tower series, so a deeper discussion of Gan is outside the scope of this already gargantuan article. Gan may have created Maturin and It, though, so I’ll leave it at that.\n\nThe point is, from the strictly limited perspective of this novel, casting the Losers out into the macroverse–that is, outside of the mainstream universe that the Turtle puked out, our everyday reality being a part of it–is symbolically a throwing of the kids outside of anything they could possibly understand, verbalize, or mentally process. The macroverse, for the Losers, is just another manifestation of Lacan’s traumatic, ineffable Real.\n\nNote that It, the personification of trauma and the embodiment of the Shadow, lurking in those dark sewers, is comprised of the deadlights, Its very life-essence. These are orange, ghostly lights that originated from the macroverse, and if one looks into them, one suffers insanity, if not death.\n\nAgain, the deadlights can be seen to symbolize the Real. It’s paradoxical that, in a world where darkness is considered evil and the light symbolic of goodness, that looking into these lights can cause madness or death, rather than enlightenment and bliss.\n\nReality is much deeper and more complex than that. As I’ve stated a number of times here, in It, in the world of the unconscious and all that is beyond our ordinary, sensory perception, all is one. Past and present are one, as seen in, for example, the jumping back and forth between the late Fifties and the mid-Eighties in those mid-sentence transitions we discussed above. The characters’ experiences are made one (e.g., Tom dreaming that he’s Henry, Audra dreaming that she’s Beverly, etc.), and good and bad juxtaposed are made one. Similarly, the light and dark can be juxtaposed and made one, in their extreme forms in the sewers.\n\nAs I’ve argued in many blog posts, the ouroboros can be used as a symbol of the dialectical relationship between opposites: the serpent’s biting head is one extreme, its bitten tail is the opposite extreme, and its coiled body represents a circular continuum where every intermediate point is found. Seeing the deadlights, especially when in the infinite black of the sewers, is a blinding light that shocks and terrifies rather than edifies you. Sometimes the light of truth is too painful to see, and the extremes of dark and light, the ouroboros’ biting place, are like Wilfred Bion‘s O as much as it is Lacan’s Real, Rudolph Otto‘s mysterium tremendum et fascinans, the numinous.\n\nPart of the meaning behind the duality of good and bad that runs throughout this novel is how the two are dialectically linked, and the terror of seeing the deadlights is equivalent to the terror of the dark unknown in the sewers. The Losers’ running from Henry’s gang, yet also running straight into Its lair, out of the light and into the darkness, only to confront the deadlights, is part of this paradox.\n\nSpeaking of darkness and light, the kid Losers have maybe ten matches that Bill wants to save for later, since they still have dim light in the drains that they can use for now (page 1309). Since this part of the story directly deals with, in a symbolic sense, confronting the Shadow, a preference of dark over light is fitting.\n\nThey’re going in deeper water now, with such dead animals as a rat, a kitten, and what seems to be a bloated woodchuck floating around them (page 1310). Such ghastly things, combined with the darkness and the stink, symbolize how an exploration of the Shadow is, however in the end therapeutic, a perilous enterprise, which if done incorrectly and carelessly, can lead to the opposite of therapy and mental health.\n\nAnd while the water they’re going through is relatively placid for the moment, it will soon roar out at them. The shapelessness of water is symbolic of the undifferentiated, indescribable nature of the Real. Again, this all adds to the uncertainty of the end of the Losers’ pursuit.\n\nAs we know, each of the Losers seems to have his (or in Bev’s case, her) special talent. Hers is marksmanship with Bill’s slingshot and the silver projectiles she’s shot at It-as-Werewolf. “Big Bill” is the leader of the group. Richie’s (potential) talent is as the self-proclaimed comedian. Mike is the town historian. Ben is the engineer. Stan can shout out bird names from his bird book to protect them. And Eddie is the one who knows which way to go, how to get found again when they’re lost (pages 1310-1311).\n\nAgain, it’s paradoxical that Eddie, the weak, germ-phobic ‘mama’s boy,’ would be the one who can lead the group through the treacherous sewers, hellish symbol of the unconscious, home of trauma, and the centre of the Shadow, but here we are. This paradox is yet another example of the good/bad duality of It, for Eddie is a mix of strength and weakness, of helplessness and helpfulness.\n\nEddie’s only answer to Bill’s question of which pipe to go through, however, is that it depends on where they all want to go (page 1311). Bill, in frustration, reminds Eddie that they’re trying to find It. Richie, Bev, Ben, Stan, and Mike all agree that It is near or under the Canal. This means going down the lower of the pipes to get to It.\n\nStan unhappily points out that this lower pipe is “a shit-pipe” (page 1312). Bill isn’t surprised to know this unpleasant fact, and neither should we be. The unconscious is a place of repressed feelings. The Shadow is all that is rejected from us. Part of that rejecting and repressing involves projection and splitting off of what we don’t like about ourselves. What better metaphor for such rejected, projected material is there than shit?\n\nAs reluctant as they all are to go through a pipe and get immersed in excrement, though, there is a strong motivation to go in that’s coming at them from behind: Henry and his gang. Here again, we have a fusion of opposites, in this case, in front with behind. They’re going forward to find It, and they’re fleeing Henry, who’s behind them. And in my interpretation, Henry-as-murderer is equivalent to It-as-murderer. The sewers are a world of non-differentiation: here, all is one.\n\nAs fetid as the smell of the sewage is, Bill is aware of an “undersmell,” the smell of some kind of animal…It. For Bill, recognizing such a smell is good news, for he knows they’re all going in the right–if rank–direction (page 1312). Again, good and bad are united.\n\nTwenty feet inside this giant, metal rectum, they find the air to be worse than rancid–it’s outright poisonous. The bad things that other people project end up getting introjected by us, toxic smells symbolically breathed in. Such exchanged pain is the basis of all of our trauma.\n\nBill calls out to Eddie for guidance: the leader of the group, “Big Bill,” the one brave enough to face It, the one hungering for revenge for George, needs Eddie, the one regarded as the weakest, the most afraid, and the most averse to this paradise of germs in the shit-pipe. All is one here, including strength and weakness, large and small, bravery and fear.\n\nAll the light is gone now. It’s no longer dark…now, it’s black (page 1313). Sounds are magnified and echoing, including those of the Losers shuffling along in the pipe, and the “sewage running in controlled bursts” (page 1313). The pipe is defecating on them. Indeed, they all scream when they get doused with it at one point, “a shit-shower,” as Richie calls it (page 1314). Now, in the absolute black, Bill could use one of those matches (page 1315).\n\nThey’ve come out of the shit-pipe, and with a lit match they can look around. Patrick Hockstetter’s body is to Bill’s right. This would seem to be an omen, for Henry and his gang are coming (page 1315). The Losers hear them coming from the pipes’ echoing acoustics.\n\nAfter Richie taunts Henry and his threat of “We’ll get youuuuuu–“ (page 1316, King’s emphasis) with the name “banana heels,” they all hear “a shriek of…mad fear and pain…through the pipe”. One of Henry’s gang…Victor, or Belch?…has been killed by It. Mike thinks it’s “some monster.”\n\nThe Losers continue toward the Canal, while the storm outside rages and brings “an early darkness to Derry” (page 1317). This storm has an apocalyptic quality similar to the one that destroys downtown Derry at the climax of the novel. This one has screaming winds, stuttering electric fire, and the racket of falling trees, all of which sound “like the death-cries of huge prehistoric creatures.”\n\nNext, we have another narration from Its point of view, but in May of 1985. It knows that the adult Losers have returned, and It also senses the return of “that maddening, galling fear…that sense of Another.” (page 1317) It feels that the Losers are agents of this Other (page 1309). I mentioned above that a higher God named Gan is this Other, from the macroverse and therefore a reminder to It that there’s much more to the world than just our mainstream universe, with the Turtle (as its creator) and It as the only two major powers. And since the Turtle remains in its shell and is, in Its estimation, “stupid,” then It, as god of our world, of Derry, is the only true power.\n\nAs I explained above, these higher powers are symbols of the Oedipal triangle we all go through that pulls us out of the dyadic, narcissistic, one-on-one parent-to-child relationship of the Imaginary and into the larger culture and society of the Symbolic, represented by a third party, the other parent, the Non! du Père that forbids the original dyadic relationship of the second party, the Oedipally-desired parent, as a mirror of the self.\n\nIn King’s cosmology, It corresponds to the child, Maturin corresponds to the Oedipally-desired parent (though It gets Its narcissistic supply not from the Turtle’s love and attention, but from a sense of superiority over the Turtle’s perceived stupidity and ineffectiveness), and Gan–the Other–corresponds to the intrusive third party that forces It to acknowledge that there’s a much larger world out there than the one It has power over. The Losers, as the apparent agents of Gan, are making It feel as though It’s about to be the real loser.\n\nIt feels somewhat encouraged in how now there are only five Losers to deal with: Stan has killed himself, and Its dogsbody–Henry–has put Mike in the hospital. It plans to send a nurse to Mike to finish him off (page 1318). It remembers how, when Mike was a baby, a large crow was pecking at him until his mother hit the bird with her fist and drove it away. The trauma of the crow would stay in Mike’s unconscious until he saw the giant bird.\n\nIts other dogsbody, Tom Rogan, has arrived in Its lair with Audra. He has also died of shock from seeing It in Its naked, undisguised form (page 1318). Audra has seen the horror of the deadlights, and she realizes that It, the giant spider, is FEMALE (page 1319).\n\nThis kids should have killed It when they had the chance, when It was hurt and therefore at Its most vulnerable. Instead, the adult Losers, older and fewer in number, will have to face It healed, renewed after Its twenty-seven-year rest (page 1320). What’s more, the adult Losers no longer have their vivid, childhood imaginations to give them power to fight It.\n\nNow, their imaginations have been stifled by TV. They need Dr. Ruth to help them fuck, and Jerry Falwell to help them to be saved. It realizes, however, that their imaginations aren’t as weak as It thought they would be, especially when the five’s imaginations are combined.\n\nIt heartens Itself by remembering that “Big Bill,” the leader and the strongest of the group (and as “the writer,” he’s also the most imaginative of them), has been weakened by his fear for his wife and what’s happened to her. After killing and feeding on him, killing the remaining four should be all the easier.\n\nNow we come to the adult Losers going through the pipes (page 1321). Them all being bigger now, it’s much harder going through such tight pipes. As they’re going through, they get to a part of the sewer system that’s moldered, ‘and the bodies of Victor Criss and Belch Huggins had moldered along with it. Like Peter Pan’s Wild Boys, Victor and Belch had never grown up.” (page 1323)\n\nSince the sewers represent the unconscious and the Shadow, and the sense of danger down there is linked with trauma, then the deaths of the two teen bullies represent how trauma has a way of putting its child victims in a state of arrested development, like those Wild Boys who never grew up. Trauma responses that serve a vital survival purpose in childhood become dysfunctional in adulthood, making the adult who was traumatized as a child still, in a way, a child. This is why the adult Losers have to confront It: their adventure underground is a symbolic facing of their childhood pain in order to be freed of it.\n\nThere’s yet another mid-sentence transition, from the adult Losers in the sewers to the kid Losers there, on page 1325. Richie begins asking Bill, “Do you have any idea…” then we go to “how long they had been wandering through the tunnels under Derry…” in the narration on page 1326.\n\nWith the ending of the adult Losers section, just before Richie’s question, Bill has found Audra’s wedding ring and put it on his finger. His match has also blown out, leaving them all in darkness. Richie’s unfinished question leaves them all in an even greater darkness of uncertainty, but the finding of her ring represents a sense of hope. The darkness and unfinished question transitioning back to the late Fifties, when the kid Losers have much less of an idea that they can defeat It, diminishes their sense of hope all the more.\n\nThere is, if anything, a far greater sense of hopelessness now, since Bill knows he won’t ever find his way back out of the sewers (page 1326). He remembers how his dad once told him that “You could wander for weeks.” They are desperately relying on Eddie’s guidance. They don’t have to be killed by It. They could die of endless wandering, get lost in the wrong pipes, or get drowned in the piss and shit.\n\nAn exploration of the Shadow can be similarly treacherous. One can be, without the guidance of a Jungian analyst, lost in the darkness of one’s negative, trauma-induced thoughts, driven mad, as Jung himself almost was.\n\nAs the kids are crawling through and smelling the filth, their traumatic memories and associations are all coming to mind, as one would expect to experience while doing Shadow work. Ben remembers the mummy from the smell. Eddie imagines it’s the smell of the leper. Richie thinks the stink is that of a moldering, rotting lumberjack’s jacket, big enough to fit Paul Bunyan. Beverly thinks of the smell of her dad’s sock-drawer (which in turn might remind one of that smell she and her dad made between them–page 1047). Stan remembers the smell of clay mixed with oil, which he associates with the demonic Golem. Mike thinks of the dry smell of feathers in a dead nest (pages 1326-1327).\n\nRecall again how these smells are symbolic of introjections from what bullies and other abusers are projecting from themselves, what the abusers hate about themselves thrown onto their victims, the shit that gives off the stink, toxic fumes from toxic people.\n\nEddie directs them all to where the Canal is, which he says is less than half a mile away, provided they can keep going in a straight line (page 1328).\n\nThen they hear a scream: “–gonna get you sons of bitches. We’re gonna get youuuuuuu–“ (page 1329, King’s emphasis). Henry is still coming. They have no idea how far back he is, since the echoes give a distorted sense of distance.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, they hear something coming toward them. Richie is so scared, he feels like a helpless three-year-old. One is reminded of adult Richie’s fortune cookie, for they all see, once Bill lights another match, “the Crawling Eye!” (page 1230).\n\nIt’s a gigantic eye filling the tunnel, with a black pupil two feet across, the iris a reddish-brown colour. The white of the eye is “laced with red veins.” It moves with tentacles, suggesting the crawling of It-as-spider. It’s looking at the kids greedily. Then, Bill’s match goes out. It’s as though the Eye can see them, but not vice versa.\n\nThis Eye is full of symbolism. This Eye stares at them just as the little eye in Richie’s fortune cookie stares at him: it’s a critical stare. The black iris is the black of the sewers, the world of the feared unknown. The russet colour of the iris suggests the red of blood from being hurt or killed (just as the red veins on the white of the eye) and the brown of shit. Henry (identified with It-as-killer) is right behind the kids, his own eyes watching for signs of them. Everything this Eye is implying is a death right there in the sewers…and even though we know the kids survive this incursion into the sewers, we also know there will be another incursion, with not all of the adult Losers surviving.\n\nBill feels the Eye’s tentacles touching his ankles (page 1330). He feels Its heat, the heat of passion and hate. Beverly also feels a tentacle touch her ear and painfully tighten like a noose around her. As It’s pulling her, she feels as if a strict schoolteacher were forcing her to sit wearing a dunce cap in the corner of the classroom (pages 1330-1331). In this, we can see how the terror of the Eye represents the pain of being criticized.\n\nEddie senses the tentacles around him but not landing on him (page 1331). He feels as if he were in a dream–a fitting feeling, given how the sewers represent the unconscious, and a giant eye with tentacles is a surreal image, the illogical, dreamlike kind that the unconscious would like to express.\n\nHis mind is screaming out to him to run home to his mamma, since he can find his way out. He’s much braver than that, though, and as we’ll learn by the end of the novel, adult Eddie is not only the Loser brave enough to face death, he’s also the one whose body will be left in the sewers, because the other adult Losers won’t be able to carry him out.\n\nOne thing we should never forget about the Shadow is that it is not all evil. It just represents aspects of ourselves that we don’t want to accept are there; sometimes they’re vices, but other times, they’re virtues. In Eddie’s case, he has strength and bravery he doesn’t even know he has.\n\nHe shouts “No!” with “a Norse-warrior sound” that one would never guess such a thin chest could ever bellow (page 1332). He does more violent shouting, he kicks at the Eye, his foot going deep into the cornea, and he shouts at the others to fight It, for “It’s just a fucking Eye!” He’s calling his friends “pussies”, he’s fighting It, and he’s “GOT A BROKEN ARM!”\n\nEddie, the weak one with “asthma,” is actually the strong one of the Losers. All opposites combine into oneness in the sewers. Here, weakness becomes strength, and vice versa. Eddie is so much more than the Persona his mother would have him show the world.\n\nThe other Losers start fighting the Eye, and they cause It to withdraw (page 1333). Stan can hear Henry still coming, so they have to move out (page 1334). The tunnel is going downward, and the stench is getting stronger. They have a feeling of disconnection, as they had in the house at Neibolt Street, as if they’re over the edge of the world, in nothingness, “Derry’s dark and ruined heart” (pages 1334-1335). I’m reminded of Joseph Conrad‘s Heart of Darkness, and Apocalypse Now, where there are similar depths of evil, of a sense of the end of the world.\n\nPart of that apocalyptic evil is a sense that they’re drifting apart, isolated and alone, as Bev is feeling. She tells the others to hold hands, so they’ll all stay together, because it’s only through their solidarity that they can hope to defeat It.\n\nThey come to a widened-out part of the tunnel. The area is huge. Bill is stuttering that they must go, for Henry will reach them soon (page 1336). Then, Stan notices the giant bird coming. Since It is the bird, and Henry is understood to be coming soon, we can see again how the bully and the evil entity can be at least symbolically equated.\n\nIt attacks Eddie first. As they’re trying to fight It off, Stan tries to do what he did with his bird book the last time he had to face It alone: he’s calling out the names of birds he believes in–scarlet tanagers, vultures, New Guinea mudlark, flamingos of Brazil, and golden bald eagles (page 1338).\n\nWith a large silence indicating that the bird has disappeared into the darkness, the Losers check Eddie’s cuts. Henry shouts out that he and Belch are coming (page 1338). Bill stutters that Henry should go back while there’s still time, for It is far more dangerous than Henry could ever be. The bullies, of course, won’t go back, for as I’ve explained, and what Bill and the other Losers don’t fully comprehend, is that the murderous instinct of It and the bullies is one and the same. In the subterranean unconscious, all is one.\n\nThe Losers reach a wall, where there’s a small door with a mark on it. Bill sees it as a paper boat. Stan sees a rising bird (page 1339). Mike sees a hooded face, maybe Butch Bowers’s. Richie sees eyes behind a pair of glasses. Beverly sees a balled-up fist (Al’s, presumably). Eddie sees the leper’s face, all disease and sickness on it. Ben sees “a tattered pile of wrappings”–the mummy’s? (page 1340)\n\nIn other words, they all see their traumas.\n\nThe door isn’t locked, so Bill pushes it open, letting out “a flow of sick yellow-green light” and a powerful “zoo smell.” As the kids pass through and into Its lair, we have another mid-sentence transition to the next section, beginning with “Bill…”\n\nWe return to the adult Losers in the sewers. Bill has stopped abruptly, and he tells the others that It was where they are now. He and Richie remember that It was in the form of the Eye, so we see how these two sections are linked, and it’s easy to know why Richie would remember the Eye (page 1341).\n\nBill mentions how Audra came to Derry because he told her the name of the town. Since Henry didn’t take her into the sewers, though, how could she have gotten in there? Ben assumes that It brought her down there, to rob Bill of his courage (page 1342).\n\nBeverly correctly suspects it was Tom who brought Audra into the sewers, because Bev also mentioned that it was Derry where she had to go to when she fought him and left him.\n\nThere’s a discussion of how everyone’s lives are intertwined: Bill and Audra, Bev and Tom, Henry, etc. Richie compares this interconnectedness to a soap opera, where Bill thinks it’s better compared to the circus (page 1342). In any case, here in the sewers, all is one.\n\nBill seems to have an intuitive sense of object relations theory, though he gets the names mixed up. He imagines that in abusive Tom, Beverly has married Henry, when she corrects him and says that in Tom she really married her father.\n\nBill knows they’re getting closer because he can smell It. He remembers, down the passageway, there’s that door with the mark on it. Again, in this moment, we see a link unifying the past with the present–all of time is one. He can’t, however, remember what’s behind the door. When exploring the depths of the Shadow, one always comes across ever darker, more repressed things one cannot discover because one doesn’t want to discover them. He remembers how scared he was when he opened the little door, the flood of light that came out, and the zoo-smell…but nothing more (page 1343).\n\nHe asks the others if they remember what It really was; none of them can. Beverly remembers they used the ritual of Chüd to fight It. They hear the approach of dragging feet, and Bill lights a match.\n\nWe next switch to a section with a sample of the residents of Derry responding to a number of ‘wrong things happening’ (pages 1343-1346). They start happening at 5:00 AM, just before the sunrise.\n\nThe first of these wrong things is the clock of the Grace Baptist Church not chiming that morning, the way it has unfailingly done at each hour and each half (except one time, at the noon-hour, supposedly a deliberate omission to mourn the deaths of some children from an explosion of the Kitchener Ironworks, though it actually just didn’t chime because it didn’t–page 1344).\n\nEvery old-timer in Derry has woken up at this time, sensing that something’s wrong, but not knowing what it is. It’s a sense of the lack of something that’s supposed to have happened. Norbert Keene, who has told Mike about the Bradley Gang and told Eddie about his asthma placebo, is now looking out his window to see a darkening sky, when the weather report of the night before has called for clear skies (page 1345). It’s going to rain.\n\nHe remembers the day the Bradley Gang was gunned down. He’s scared, thinking, “Those kids…[are] monkeying around.” Does he mean the Losers Club? If so, he’s sensing a synchronicity.\n\nEgbert Thoroughgood, who was in the Silver Dollar when Claude Heroux used his axe and gave those men so many whacks, wakes with a scream and having wet the bed after a dream about Claude. He, too, knows that something is terribly wrong. His terrifying dream (and dreams are part of the royal road to an understanding of the unconscious, as Freud observed) is connected through synchronicity to the apocalyptic events about to occur in Derry.\n\nDave Gardener, who found Georgie’s bloody, one-armed body on that other day of flooding, is now disturbed by the conspicuous lack of a chime from the local church clock. He sees the clouds coming in, and he’s even more worried (page 1346). He senses the danger because another Great Flood is coming.\n\nThe Derry Chief of Police, who has done his best to solve the new string of child-killings, and the one who suspects that Bev knows more about the circumstances surrounding the attack on Mike in the library than she’s let on, sees the clouds out there, and feels the same worry as Keene, Thoroughgood, and Gardener. He senses that it will do more than just “pour buckets” (page 1346, King’s emphasis).\n\nThe great, apocalyptic thunderstorm is about to come. The cop sees the huge raindrops beginning to fall. He hears the rumbling in the sky, and he is shuddering with fear.\n\nThese men all instinctively know that this won’t be just any thunderstorm, or even any old flooding. The morning has been full of omens. The lack of chiming from a church clock known to be faithful with it implies ‘the end of time,’ in a sense. Dreams and memories of horrific violence, both past and present, add to the ominous energy.\n\nThis merging of the inner and outer worlds, a fearful sense inside the mind from bad dreams, and the sense of things going wrong out there, in the physical world, is the essence of synchronicity…but not the sentimental kind we learn of in YouTube videos, of good news from the universe.\n\nBack in the sewers, after Bill has lit a match and held it up to see, he sees an apparition of George further up the tunnel, in his yellow rainslicker (page 1347). He’s blaming Bill for allowing him to die, plaguing Bill further with guilt.\n\nThe apparition, of course, is a projection of Bill’s guilt feelings, his unconscious running wild. He feels as if his friends are abandoning him, though Richie, Beverly, and Eddie are shouting at him to fight It and kill It (page 1348).\n\nBill tries to fight It off, saying the couplet for his stuttering therapy. As he does, Richie remembers that Bill stutters only in his own voice; he never stutters when he pretends to be someone else (page 1349).\n\nThis stuttering when he’s himself, but not stuttering when he’s not himself, ties in with what I was saying back in Part I of this analysis, when I related the stuttering to Bill’s difficulty transitioning from Lacan’s Imaginary–a narcissistic mindset in which a child’s Oedipally-desired parent is a metaphorical mirror reflecting his ego–to the Symbolic, a sociocultural mindset expressed through language, in which one interacts with many Others who exist as entities unto themselves, not just as extensions of oneself.\n\nAnother aspect of this transition from dyadic relationships to the larger society involves engaging in that society’s fakery while acting as if it were sincere, even believing it’s sincere, something Lacan expressed in his French pun of le Non! du père and les non-dupes errent. To be able to adjust to society and gain its healthy benefits, one must ‘play the game,’ or participate in the hypocrisies and play-acting that everyone does in order to fit in. Hence, for Bill to be free of his stutter, he must speak in a voice other than his own. Entering society, which must be done through language, means speaking an actor’s lines, so to speak.\n\nBill must recite that couplet like an actor reciting Shakespeare’s blank verse, so to speak, so that he can immerse himself in the cultural world of the Symbolic and its use of language. As he repeats the couplet, not stuttering, he gains strength and can advance on It, making It back off (page 1350).\n\nA little later, though, he falters, and the real Bill starts coming back, consumed with guilt. Weeping, he says sorry to George, and his stuttering returns as well (pages 1350-1351).\n\nOutside, and as of 5:30 in the morning, it’s raining hard. Weather forecasters are apologizing for the misleading predictions of good weather from the day before, which have raised the hopes of people planning picnics and other outings only to be disappointed today. Such disappointments, though, will be the least of their worries.\n\nThough the rain is heavy, everyone agrees there won’t be flooding; still, everyone’s uneasy about the growing storm (page 1352). There are explosions: one from a power-transformer at 5:45, then an underground explosion is felt at 6:05. A number of people are killed (page 1353).\n\nMike wakes up in his hospital room at 6:46 after having “an anxiety dream.” Once again, the inner and outer worlds are united through synchronicity. He slowly starts to remember how he was in the library, about to write in his notebook, when Henry appeared. Since he doesn’t know any more after the attack, he can only worry that Henry has gone after the other Losers (page 1354).\n\nHe uses the call-bell to get help. A male nurse comes in the room, Mark Lamonica, whose sister was killed back in 1958, so this is a bad omen. Mark doesn’t want to hear anything Mike has to say, another bad sign. He just wants to give Mike a shot.\n\nJust as the shot from the syringe is symbolic of projection, the kind of projection one would get from an abuser, the unwillingness to listen to the words of the one an abuser is preying on is just as bad, for one must be able to rid oneself of the pain the abuser is putting into one. The shot will put Mike to sleep, as in “to die, to sleep, no more.” The shot is a projection of the badness inside the abuser, like the projections that Eddie and Bev receive from his mother and her father respectively.\n\nThis kind of projection is projective identification, where the recipient is manipulated into manifesting the projections, hence, Eddie’s germ-phobia and fragility, Bev’s promiscuity with the Loser boys when she was a girl, and Mike’s receiving of the Thanatos the nurse wants to inject into him.\n\nBack in the tunnels, Bill wants everyone to be quiet (page 1355). Since Richie has lit a match, everyone looks around, expecting to see It in the form of another monster, a new surprise: perhaps Rodan, or a xenomorph from Alien.\n\nThis isn’t the problem that Bill is worried about, though. He senses that Mike is in danger back in the hospital. Ben feels it, too. Bill wants everyone to hold hands immediately.\n\nIt’s interesting how, in the sewers, symbolic of the collective unconscious and a place where all is one, the Losers can psychically feel Mike’s current state of danger, all the way from there to the hospital.\n\nBill shouts out, “Send him our power!” in a strange, deep voice, as if he were a shaman in a trance (page 1356, King’s emphasis). Beverly feels something leave all of their bodies and go out toward Mike. Again, the tunnels have a mystical quality rather like the Shining, which allows the Losers to send out a kind of divine energy to help Mike.\n\nAnd indeed, this power gets to Mike, and in spite of being injured, weakened, and bedridden, he is able to use this power to pick up a glass and smash Mark the nurse in the face with it (page 1357), making him drop the syringe and saving Mike from getting the fatal injection.\n\nBack in the tunnels again, Bill senses that Mike is all right. Ben has felt the power going out from them and coming back, but he doesn’t know where it went or what it did…if it even existed (page 1358).\n\nThey all continue through the tunnel, Ben recalling the thick zoo smell. They’ve reached the door they’d found when they were kids, that small door. Ben’s heart is beating faster. The place is triggering painful childhood memories for him. He feels fat again.\n\nSince they’re all grown up, it will be hard for them to get through the door. They see that mark on it, the one that evokes different things for each of them to see, as it did when they were kids. Bev sees Tom; Bill sees Audra’s severed head, with accusing eyes to guilt-trip him the way Georgie’s apparition has done (the severed head might also remind us of Stan’s in the library fridge–page 909); Eddie sees a skull over two crossed bones, the poison symbol, Richie sees Paul Bunyan’s face; and Ben sees Henry Bowers (page 1359).\n\nBill pushes the door open, letting out that flood of sick yellow-green light again, as well as more of the zoo smell, “the smell of the past become the present” (page 1359). Once again, we see how all is one in this subterranean place of the unconscious, where all times are the same time.\n\nThey all crawl through, and Bill is the first of them to see It in Its original form…or, at least, the form that is the closest that their minds can come to comprehend what It really is. They see a giant spider-like thing, but to see exactly what Its form is would be to confront Lacan’s traumatic, inexpressible, indescribable Real.\n\nSo shocking a thing makes it easy for Bill to understand why Stan killed himself…and now, Bill wishes he’d done so, too (page 1360). Seeing exactly what It is…the deadlights…is something Bill would never want to see–the Real.\n\nBen senses that he can read Its mind (page 1361). Once again, we get an idea of how all is one down here in the sewers; there is a kind of shared consciousness where Ben can sense Its thoughts, and all of the Losers can send their psychic energy to aid Mike. Ben senses Its egg-sac, and he shudders at its implications (page 1361).\n\nIt is a She, and She is pregnant.\n\nStan is the only one who understood what they were all up against, and this is why he killed himself. It is a She, a pregnant She who will produce a litter of baby-Its that will continue to terrorize Derry even if the Losers manage to kill the mother.\n\nThey have to kill every single It out there. No matter how well you defeat evil, it keeps coming back. This is the offensive thing that Stan could never accept–the reality of the Real.\n\nBill goes forward, toward It, thinking, Got to become a child again (page 1361), recalling the same Biblical idea I discussed when Mike, writing in his notebook in his library, was thinking about how one must have the right child-like quality–faith–to confront It (pages 1159-1160) as the Losers had faced It in the late Fifties.\n\nNow that Bill knows that It is a She, when he accuses It of killing his brother, instead of calling It a bastard, he calls It a “fuh-fuh-fucking BITCH!” (page 1362, King’s emphasis). He’s going over to It, and It is going up to him, “burying Bill in Its shadow,” a fitting way to express something symbolic of Shadow work.\n\n“Shadow” is also fittingly juxtaposed with the fact that Ben is looking into Its eyes, and for an instant he can see “the shape behind the shape,” the orange deadlights “that mocked life” (page 1362).\n\nAnd now what begins, for the second time, what is the subject of the next chapter.\n\nXXVIII: The Ritual of Chüd\n\nBill’s confrontation with It-as-giant-spider was greatly influenced by The Lord of the Rings, in particular, Frodo’s predicament in the lair of Shelob, also a giant spider. The confrontation to begin at the end of the previous chapter was that of the adult Losers; the one beginning this chapter is the one with the kids in 1958.\n\nBill is showing incredible bravery as he crosses the room toward It (page 1364), again accusing It of killing his brother and him wanting revenge. The same language used in adult Bill’s facing of It is used here with little Bill’s confrontation: “It was rearing up over Bill…It buried Bill in Its shadow, Its legs pawing at the air.” This should be compared with King’s near-identical words on page 1362.\n\nThe point is that these repeated words suggest once again how the late Fifties experience is paralleled by the mid-Eighties one, that in this subterranean world that represents the collective unconscious, the past is at one with the present, because here, all is one–the Spider’s lair symbolizes the traumatic, undifferentiated realm of Lacan’s Real.\n\nAgain, though, just as at the end of the previous chapter, we have that juxtaposition of Bill “buried…in Its shadow” with Ben beholding that “insane light” (page 1364). We get a repeat of the language of the end of the previous chapter, too, from page 1362, again on page 1364 in this chapter: “Ben…heard Its eager mewling, looked into Its timeless, evil eyes, and saw something behind the shape”. All of this once again reinforces the idea that the past and present are one, a cyclical repetition, synchronicity.\n\nRichie seems to anticipate knowledge of Its sex when he says to Ben, “Let’s get her, Haystack!” (page 1365). Ben is surprised to hear that It might be a She; Her? he thinks. Again, Richie’s synchronistic anticipation strengthens our understanding that in the sewers, past and present are one because in the collective unconscious, all is one.\n\nRichie runs toward Bill and into the shadow of It, and soon after, soon enough to be a near-juxtaposition, we read of Bill looking into the orange deadlights of Its eyes. Chüd has begun, just as it has at the end of the previous chapter.\n\nBill is in the void, confronting It directly, even conversing with It in their minds. Both are threatening each other, trying to intimidate each other (page 1365).\n\nIt would seem absurd to think that a little boy could even attempt to intimidate the “eternal…the Eater of Worlds“, but Bill can actually do it. His youthful imagination, as I’ve said before, while tasty to It, can also be used as a weapon against It, that childlike faith that Mike has observed.\n\nBill begins mentally chanting the “thrusts his fists against the posts” couplet, and It fires him like the Human Cannonball across the Spider’s chamber in an attempt to make him stop. Bill reminds himself that It’s only in his head, and he’s right–It, or Pennywise, is only a metaphor, a personification of his mental state.\n\nAs he’s thrown about, past piles of human and animal bones, Bill keeps trying to recite the couplet, a few words at a time (page 1366). He is surrounded in darkness, total black. It is telling him to stop reciting the couplet, but he gets to the point of reciting it in its entirety. It is getting intimidated.\n\nBill wishes he could say it out loud without stuttering, instead of just reciting it in his mind. He would thus have so much more power to defeat It. As I’ve said previously, his stuttering, or difficulty using language to connect with others socially, stems from an inability to enter what Lacan called the Symbolic–the sociocultural world of language as a cure for the traumatizing, maddening world of the Real (the deadlights) that he’s experiencing in the Spider’s lair.\n\nStill, It is desperately trying to make the boy continue to believe that Its illusion is real. It has to try to destroy Bill’s confidence, to make him believe that he has already lost the fight.\n\nSoon, though, Bill starts to sense that there is another being among them, a huge presence that is giving him a sense of awe, something with far greater power than It (page 1367).\n\nBill has encountered the Turtle.\n\nThe Turtle has kind eyes. It is the principle of goodness, but it is passive, the dark yin to Its bright yang, the maddening brightness of the deadlights. The Turtle won’t actively help Bill defeat It, but he is getting a feeling, through knowing the existence of the Turtle, that there is an Other, not just the dyadic existence of It on the one side, and on the other side, all of these child victims who exist only to sate Its hunger, only to be mirror reflections of Its narcissism in Lacan’s Imaginary.\n\nThe Turtle represents a God-like third party, opening up the possibility of there being a Final Other, Gan, the real, ultimate God of Stephen King’s cosmology. The existence of these so many others means that the dyadic, narcissistic world of It can be broken down and destroyed, the Imaginary supplanted by the Symbolic…Bill just has to say the couplet, use spoken language to bring on the Other of society.\n\nBill begs for help from the Turtle, but he doesn’t even get a “God helps those who help themselves” kind of response. Bill must help himself, and apart from the Turtle’s advice to recite the couplet out loud (page 1368), Bill has to rely on Chüd alone.\n\nBill is also getting a sense that It is only bluffing in Its threats (page 1370). He has only the ritual of Chüd to fight It with…and maybe, that’s all he needs.\n\nTo recite the couplet out loud without stuttering, Bill has to use a voice other than his own, so he drops his voice a full register to make it like his father’s voice (page 1371). He shouts the couplet out loud like this, making It scream in his mind in frustration. It’s writhing and pushing him away.\n\nRecall what I said before about entering the Symbolic not just through language, but also through a belief in the phoniness of social interaction–to be duped by that phoniness is, paradoxically, not to err…le Non! du père is les non-dupes errent. In speaking in a voice that isn’t his own, his father’s voice, Bill is engaging in the fakery of society; and so, he isn’t erring, and in entering the Symbolic thus, he can defeat It. That he uses, of all voices, his father’s, is most fitting in this connection.\n\nHe repeats his screaming of the couplet, making It scream again and feel even more intense pain (page 1371). It’s still trying to push him away, to get rid of him, but he won’t stop fighting. He knows the importance of a child’s faith, as Mike will later observe as an adult in the library. Bill affirms his belief in all of those childhood things, like the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Captain Midnight, etc. (page 1372) Believing in such things is yet another example of being duped by ideas that society teaches children about…but Bill isn’t erring.\n\nHe’s made It scream again. The Turtle is impressed with Bill, but tells him to continue, to finish It off. He mustn’t let It get away (page 1373). The Turtle’s head withdrawn back into its shell, its voice fades away. It is in agonizing pain, begging Bill to let It go.\n\nHe touches Its web, and his hand goes numb (page 1374). Ben warns him not to touch it. It is retreating back into the darkness of Its chamber at the back. Strands of Its web are floating down. Mike warns Bill to watch out for the falling web. Bill can’t see the Spider, but he can mentally hear It mewling and crying out in pain.\n\nHe doesn’t know if It’s retreated to hide, to die, or to escape. He’s come out of the void-state, and Richie is asking him what happened. Bill knows they have to make sure It is dead (page 1375).\n\nUp above, the spiderweb is drooping and collapsing, “losing its fearful symmetry,” an amusing nod to William Blake‘s poem, “The Tyger,” in which the duality of the Tyger’s beauty and ferocity finds a parallel in the good/bad duality pervading It.\n\nThis reference to the Blake poem is also illuminating in how it’s part of his Songs of Experience, as opposed to his Songs of Innocence. Consider what’s been happening to the Loser kids: throughout this novel, they have been going through a transition from innocence to experience. We see the Losers as kids and as adults. The traumas It has been putting them through are the crucial part of that transition.\n\n“The Tyger” is mostly verses that are questions posed to the animal. There is a terrible mystery surrounding the Tyger. And since the spiderweb also has a “fearful symmetry,” It, too, has a terrible mystery about it; but the spiderweb is “losing its fearful symmetry,” because the Losers have entered Its lair, confronted It, scared It, and hurt It.\n\nThe novel then brings us back to the mid-80s, with adult Bill confronting It, who taunts him about his baldness (page 1377). Bill, doing the ritual of Chüd a second time, is full of vengeful thoughts again: he accuses It of killing not only his brother, but also Stan, and of trying to kill Mike. Bill plans to finish what he’d only started as a boy with the previous ritual of Chüd.\n\nIt tells him that the “stupid” Turtle is dead. It also promises that Bill will see the deadlights. He senses, though, that It is still hurt from the last time (page 1378).\n\nIn a section titled Richie, the other four adult Losers are watching Bill in his confrontation with It, paralyzed. At first, this confrontation is “an exact replay of what had happened before,” suggesting again the idea that here in the sewers, past and present are one. It has thrown Bill, and he is intent on seizing Its tongue.\n\nSince I’ve compared the Turtle to God, we can see how Bill’s having heard that “the Turtle is dead oh God the Turtle is really dead” would cause him to feel “sickening…despair.” (page 1379) This despair is like that of anyone who has contemplated what Nietzsche meant by “God is dead,” that the Christian God can no longer be believed in.\n\nIn a world where evil, in one form or another, very much exists, to think that a powerful force of good doesn’t exist, to help us fight that evil, is terrifying. I dealt with such terrors in my analyses of films like The Exorcist and The Omen. Since the Turtle, even when alive, hasn’t helped the Losers in any substantive capacity, we can see how It is also a terrifying story with its lack of a powerful force of good. The non-intervening Turtle is more the God of the deists than the actual Christian God.\n\nStill, the Losers won’t give up. Richie, for a change, puts one of his inane voices to good use, in this case, his Irish Cop Voice, to distract It from using Its stinger on Bill (page 1379). Richie senses pain and anger in Its head. He jumps into the void, joining Bill there, and manages to do what Bill hasn’t been able to: having hurt It, Richie grabs hold of Its tongue (page 1380). It’s thought only Bill would challenge It, and now It has to shake Richie off while he’s doing a Spanish accent.\n\nIn the next section, titled Eddie, Eddie is watching Bill, and especially Richie, confronting It (page 1384). He’s impressed that Richie has improved his act: his Irish Cop Voice really sounds like Mr. Nell, the cop who, back when the Losers were kids in the Barrens, wanted them to take down their dam.\n\nEddie senses the connection between Richie and the Spider, how they’re staring at each other and swirling their talking and emotions together (page 1385). Naturally, there’s a connection, a swirling together: as a symbol of trauma, the Spider is like a mirror that Richie is looking into. His voices, his humor, are a way of dealing with his trauma, as I’ve said before.\n\nBy doing his voices, Richie, like Bill, is not speaking in his own voice. Thus, like Bill, Richie is leaving Lacan’s traumatic Real and entering the sociocultural world of the Symbolic, the world of the Other (i.e., many others, not one other as an extension of oneself, as in the narcissistic Imaginary), via the social fakery of les non-dupes errent. Since It cannot bear the multiple Other, Richie is succeeding in hurting It.\n\nBill is slumped on the floor, his nose and ears bleeding (page 1385). Eddie is thinking that they can hurt It while It’s distracted with Richie. He hears Richie in his head, crying out for help (page 1386). Eddie take out his aspirator, ready to use it as a weapon…as odd as that must sound.\n\nRecall how Eddie, from the time he’d learned from Mr. Keene that the medicine was just a watery placebo, nonetheless continued to use it, and blackmailed his mom into letting him be with his friends if he continued to use it. (Recall also when all the Losers, before entering the house at Neibolt Street, borrowed his aspirator–pages 1107-1108.) His use of the aspirator now, to spray it in the Spider’s eye while believing that it really works against asthma (page 1386), is another example of les non-dupes errent. He’s let himself be a dupe of the placebo’s supposed efficacy, and paradoxically, he isn’t erring in his attack on It.\n\nAs he does so, though, he hears the voice of his mot"
