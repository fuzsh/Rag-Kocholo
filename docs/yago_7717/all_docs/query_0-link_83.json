In 1948, this was an assertive charge for a polarized world; in 2015, it is a utopic principle, forever unfulfilled. In the early twenty-first century, censorship, especially state-implemented control over material forms of communication, remains a key challenge to any vaunted unitary culture for the globalizing world. In other ways, it is an instrument against differentiated dissent, enforcing hegemonic models of homogenized culture in contexts where local expressions of political or moral identity are found offensive or dangerous. Censorship embodies the tension between the historical legal limits of the nation state and the new planetary reach of the communicative sphere, and contemporary regulation of mediascapes is no longer isomorphic with the borders of a single country or the spread of a single language. Legal theorists such as Scott Beattie yet argue that pervasive regulatory control of electronic communication is now impossible, Edward Snowden’s exile in Russia and Julian Assange’s current confinement to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London notwithstanding. In 2014 the finale of the fourth season of the HBO series Game of Thrones became the most illegally-downloaded media product in history. About contemporary censorship, former British Labour Member of Parliament Denis MacShane advances a paradox: ‘Increased freedom and increased censorship coexist. This wasn’t meant to happen.’1 If ‘freedom of opinion and expression’ is its doctrine, art and literature have been understood as this liberty’s apex – the fora in which the unfettered liberal imagination has manifested its worth. Well before the trial of Madame Bovary, the opposition between literature and censorship had a life in Western law: the defence of artistic merit defines the literary against the offensive categories of obscenity, sedition and blasphemy, and also out of the reach of censorship, by definition – ‘art for art’s sake’. The problematic US ‘Brennan doctrine’ of the 1950s, moreover, aligned the literary also with ‘social merit’, claiming protection under the US Constitution by definitively distinguishing it from obscenity, while leaving ‘obscenity’ as an undifferentiated category without ‘redeeming value’.2 Literature’s categorical expression has depended, in courts of law and regimes of regulation, on its ability to differentiate itself from the law’s proper object,\n\n2\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nand the ambiguities at stake have seemed to describe the form as such. In the anxious, crisis-driven consolidations of the early twenty-first-century, humanities scholars seek to define the literary as a localizable phenomenon once more, identifying its ‘singularity’ and its ‘innovation’ as features essential to the function.3 As the ‘bourgeois in frock-coat’ of the Second Empire’s literary establishment proved to Flaubert, however, literature is not untainted by the confining operations of regulation, nor is censorship, as Robert Darnton articulates, ‘a thing-in-itself, an isolated phenomenon that is always and everywhere the same, the mere antithesis to freedom of thought’.4 This volume seeks to explore the degree to which, rather than removed and antithetical opposites, literature and censorship have been dialectical forms of culture, each actively defining the other in ongoing, agonistic engagement. In so far as regimes of regulation determine the character of print culture, they address, shape and even produce the conditions of literary possibility. And in so far as literature seeks to assert its own limits, in turn it addresses, provokes and determines the instruments of censorship used to measure such. Literature has not consistently stood as censorship’s heroic adversary, nor has censorship always refused the prerogatives of the literary. Literature has not been a straightforward instrument in the exercise of free speech, seen as a feature of modelled democracy, even outside the constraints of the expansive, state-implemented regulation typical of what can thus be called totalitarianism. Chris Hilliard can cite A. V. Dicey’s Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution in 1915 (8th edn) to demonstrate the absence of a strong doctrine of freedom of expression in British law: ‘no-one can maintain that the law of England recognises anything like that natural right to the free communication of thoughts and opinions which was proclaimed in France a little over a hundred years ago to be one of the most valuable Rights of Man’.5 Simon During’s complexly contrarian Against Democracy makes the case that literature was not on the side of ‘political democracy’ until 1945 or so, and argues that, in the West, ‘twentieth-century literary high culture, in particular, was largely shaped in the rhythms and forms through which it adapted to its translation into and out of mundane experience as ordered in (sometimes merely emergent) democratic state capitalism’.6 A global perspective on this question, attendant to the determining relations between national jurisdictions and publishing economies, border controls and structures of distribution, regulative regimes and diverse linguistic cultures of the book, expands the orders of experience at stake significantly. In its address to this dynamic between literature and censorship, the volume reflects a moment of congruence, when new directions in a number of scholarly fields are converging. Five new directions can be identified in particular. After Michel Foucault, through the late 1990s, scholars came to some broad agreement about the productive features of censorship – its ability to produce as well as suppress meaning – drawing on Foucault’s repressive hypothesis and further interest in the constitutive relations between discourse and power, such as that articulated (albeit differently) by Pierre Bourdieu and Judith Butler. This manifested in what was then called ‘the new censorship’ scholarship, dominated by post-structuralist investigation of the foundational relationship between language and repression, speech and silence. In an introduction to a pivotal edited collection, Robert Post asserted that ‘censorship is\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nthe norm rather than the exception. Censorship materialises everywhere’.7 Similarly, Michael Holquist declared that ‘Censorship is. One can only discriminate among its more or less repressive effects’.8 This line has been much quoted in consequent engagements with this scholarship, which draw on the critique offered, by Richard Burt and others, of the ‘Manichean vision’ of censorship and freedom, and which is now represented in conceptualizations stretching from Tudor-Stuart censorship and Jacobean press constraints to Celia Marshik’s ‘censorship dialectic’ in British modernism.9 A further set of engagements interrogate, however, the normalization consequent to a position that posits censorship as a constitutive aspect of all communication.10 Beate Müller’s interrogation, in particular, characterizes what can be seen as a second new direction in the field, coming from Eastern Europe.11 In the wake of the openingup of the voluminous archives of censorship records from the former communist bloc, Müller sought to differentiate between the mundane, everyday communicative selectivity analysed by Butler and Bourdieu, and the prescriptive and repressive regimes of control exercised by countries with Soviet-style socialist government. Her critique of the largely US-based new scholarship was not merely about degrees of comparative description, but the definition of censorship itself. Before and after Müller has come a large body of work responding to the hugely-expansive (for some states, comprehensive) records of communist print and theatre censorship, from German, Russian and other European scholars, as well as in English.12 As I’ve outlined elsewhere, the capacity of ‘censorship’ to describe exercised, coercive power was being defended, against what was seen to be a redefinition too expansive and mundane.13 At the same time, this volume, as others like it, cannot and does not confine its analysis to the state’s use of sovereign powers to control the literary – our definition of censorship includes both instances of often untracable ‘self-censorship’, evident multifariously in the history of print publication, and of what might be termed ‘soft censorship’, indirectly produced by the ‘chilling effect’ of more direct forms.14 Tyne Daile Sumner’s chapter teases out the subtexts at play in mid-century American confessional poetry in the context of the Cold War to instance the latter, for example. Together, the essays in this collection address censorship’s ability to form, produce or enact institutional forms of the literary, and in that address foreground the exercise of reticulated coercive power as well as systematic control by regimes whose aims were comprehensive. The opening-up of the Eastern Bloc’s archives was coeval, in a further direction, with developments in book-history approaches to print culture, and these have been led by Darnton’s work on the archives of the ancien régime and pre-revolutionary France. Book history’s material emphasis on trading economics and regulatory frameworks as well as the roles of institutions, bureaucracies, libraries, publishers, distributors, booksellers and readers has shifted literary censorship scholarship markedly away from a focus on the figure of the wronged author, or on the encoded, censored page, to the scope, extent and experience of censorship in specifiable, reconstructed circumstances. And the work of print history scholars in making accessible sufficient records from national censorship regimes to allow quantification has now enabled the use of new digital methods, in the mode of the ‘new empiricism’ or the ‘distant reading’ techniques articulated by Franco Moretti and others.15 Simon Burrow’s work in this\n\n4\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nvolume begins where Darnton leaves off in subjecting Bourbon-era publishing records to illuminating quantitative analysis. Above all, these recent methods have fostered a move from the instance to the system. Darnton’s newest work reminds us that comparative history is a ‘demanding genre, not merely because of the need to command different languages but owing to the problems inherent in making comparisons’.16 Contemporary censorship scholarship is now able to place into calculable contrast the systematic practices of regimes as different and yet analogous as eighteenth-century France, nineteenth-century India, twentieth-century white Australia, Catholic Ireland, fascist Italy, cold-war East Germany, apartheid South Africa and, to some degree, the UK during the Second World War.17 The fourth direction this volume reflects comes also in the wake of Foucault, pursuant on his history of sexuality, and before that feminist and gay and lesbian interest in the cultural suppression of sex and sexual identities. Critics like Jonathan Dollimore and Lee Edelman question whether the dynamic between censorship and literature is driven by nothing that inheres in either the literary or the structures of government, but only in the third, fundamental repression of sex itself. The lifting of the profound censorship of homosexual content of all kinds has been perhaps the most dramatic shift in literary expression, in the English-speaking world at least, of the last 200 years. And, by the late 1990s, some scholars were able to suggest that critical scholarly interest in censorship had been subsumed by the question of obscenity. After illuminating new work on the early modern period, from scholars such as Lynn Hunt, Valerie Traub and Joan DeJean, which put the question of gender tellingly into play, the history of literary censorship in Britain, France, the US and settler colonial states like Australia, New Zealand and Canada has been dominated by a newly-serious attention to obscenity as the most pervasive offence for legal regulation. In the wake of the work of sexuality scholars like Robert Aldrich, Dennis Altman, Anjali Arondekar, Anne McClintock and others, often combining their post-colonial interests with Foucauldian frames, as did Ann Laura Stoler, the censored history of literary sexuality has been examined in many geopolitical contexts. In this expansive field of interest, the imbrication of the political with the moral remains at stake; perhaps more exactly enmeshed as the national and the sexual. This broadly international purview then informs the last of the five scholarly directions to which this collection contributes, perhaps most significantly. The decentring of metropolitan literary histories has been a long time coming, via comparative literature, commonwealth models, post-colonial theories and methods, cosmopolitanism and its critiques, and since the 2000s a globalized revision of the ‘world literature’ ambit. In the contemporary moment, a newly-expansive big picture is accessible, with profoundly re-constitutive interest from the US and Europe (catching up with their empires) in resituating the point of view from which that big picture can be seen. This transnational moment is liberating for comparative accounts of censorship, which formerly have been restricted by the borders of nation states, even when tracing forms of censorship unidentical to state-sponsored regimes of regulation.18 The essays in this volume engage with more than twelve countries or nation states, placing into revealing contiguity a set of case studies examining national regimes, publishing industries, book trades, reading\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\ncontexts or authorial circumstances, including from some states and colonies that no longer exist. A number of chapters importantly identify connections and parallels between countries, including transferred or inherited legislative frameworks, shared or mirrored institutional structures, as well as identical logics and counterclaims from the censors and the censored, such as in the court room. The definitions of censorship at work are crucially congruent: Peter McDonald’s key essay on South African apartheid censorship points to the fact that censors denied theirs was a censorship system, since it examined books after rather than pre-publication, for instance, and so does Burrows in his account of the French regime under the Bourbon kings, and so have I in referencing severe Australian Customs controls elsewhere,19 while the eighteenth-century shift from pre- to post-publication in England is illuminating for Tuite’s chapter. A number of essays apply similar conceptual or theoretical approaches to the work of censorship, particularly its legal frames and discursive staging, enabling productive comparisons, for the volume as a whole, across wide-ranging literary histories and political geographies: both modern time and global space. In their geo-political diversity, the chapters span the history of the modern relationship between censorship and the literary, with delineated groupings into four, chronologically-ordered parts. Like many accounts of what we can term modern censorship, the volume begins at the posited birth of the Enlightenment, in mid-eighteenth-century France, when the European notion of ‘literature’ is hardening into familiar form, and the beginnings of a recognizable state apparatus are being deployed by the ancien régime to control an increasingly literate population’s reading. Burrows’ account of French censorship ‘on the eve of revolution’ contests conventional heralding of the incendiary eruption of a free public sphere by tracking the regime’s control over print publication in analysable, quantitative detail. Pervasive censorship meant that the strongest threats to the regime came from the elites rather than the populace – the revolution was not enacted in print, he suggests. Clara Tuite’s chapter then takes us across the channel to British Regency law courts, where charges of blasphemous sedition against the satires of autodidact William Hone concentrated the legislative controls of the previous century and a half (or longer in the case of theatre censorship) into a hugely-popular challenge to the equation between church and state. Hone’s spectacular victories informed John Keats’s conception of ‘negative capability’, Tuite reveals, and offer an illuminating way to code the negative agency of censorship in reactively producing literature, with implications for treatments in other chapters, including my own. If Tuite’s chapter is the joyous street, then Mary Spongberg’s is the raucous Royal court. Still in Regency Britain, this chapter’s focus is the gendered structures of speaking and silence that delimited the voices around the Queen Caroline affair, despite the forces of relative liberalization pursuant on the repressive law courts, including Hone’s trials. Spongberg’s focus on neglected writer Mary Hays exposes the double standards at play, in the wake of Wollstonecraft’s death, in the treatment of women’s public speech, subsequently absented from history. Karen Crawley moves with the nineteenth century from blasphemous sedition to popular obscenity in re-examining the determining legal decisions of mid-nineteenth-century Britain and America, particularly those deliberated under the UK’s Obscene Publications Act and\n\n6\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nthe US’s Comstock Act. She shares with Tuite a Butlerian interest in how the law is compelled to speak that which it would prohibit; this chapter examines the dimension of performativity in obscenity law, exposing the rhetorical foundations of legal decisions important for the implementation of modern censorship regimes across the English-speaking world. The next section takes us outside Europe and the US to examine contexts in which these founding relations between imperialism and censorship, and particularly obscenity and empire, can be laid bare. Paul Tickell gives us a big-picture survey of the punishing controls extended by the Dutch regime in the East Indies through the beginning of the twentieth century, from press controls and the fostered dominance of the central state publisher to the use of exile to West Papua. The profound impacts on contemporary Indonesian literature are there to be traced. Geoffrey Little pursues the volume’s materialist interest in the institutions of literature via an examination of librarian training in mid-twentieth-century Quebec, exposing its central role in the (post-)colonial Catholic state’s severe restrictions on book access and reading, as an assertion of cultural identity in sharp distinction from Protestant Anglophone Canada. The way in which the literary is not just at stake but is defined and thus produced by such institutions of censorship is then examined directly by my own essay, discussing two very different cases from the records of the Australian Customs’ Literature Censorship Board in the 1930s and 1940s: deliberated bans on le comte de Lautréamont’s poetic roman noir The Lay of Maldoror and James Noble Gifford’s exemplary pulp title Furnished Room. This central question is eruditely explicated by Peter McDonald’s essay on the South African apartheid regime, in which he confronts the ‘monstrous’ spectre of the ‘censor critic’. Tracking the theorized conceptions of literature at play for the many South African censors with parallel careers as literary professionals, he pursues the dynamic relations between censorship and the literary enacted not just in that severe regime, but in so far as a literary field may exist. Australian and South African book censorship regimes were analogous in many respects, not only because of inherited legislation and legal systems in British colonial environments (shared also with New Zealand and Ireland), but in the ways in which bureaucratic modernity militated for highly-regulated methods and complex infrastructures. The expansive records of these two regimes make them thus, in turn, practicably comparable at once to the ancien régime, colonial India and the pre-publication regimes of former Soviet countries, especially the German Democratic Republic, because centralized records of assessment from all of these states are now available. The third section draws together essays examining censorship during the Cold War. In Ilona Urquhart’s chapter, Leo Strauss, one of Soviet censorship’s old cultural enemies, is used to read one of its high profile victims, providing an acute recasting of Mikhail Bulgakov’s extraordinary suppressed modernist novel The Master and Margarita. This is one of the chapters close up to the literary’s response to censorship, with a highly-engaged rather than ‘distant’ reading. Christina Spittel’s transnational chapter on the treatment of West German fiction in the GDR’s centralized book publication system furthers work by German book historians but also comparative work by Darnton and others, including our own collaborative\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nresearch, and draws on comprehensive records of censors’ deliberations. Tyne Daile Sumner’s chapter follows this, rereading American confessional poets in tense, cold-war contexts. She tracks the threat of censorship versus the impulse towards confession, showing how pressures of expression swing between those polarities by reading ostensibly private and personal poems within the period’s global structures of silencing and surveillance. Last in this section is Loren Glass, also in the US, extending his influential account of the great post-war obscenity cases by elucidating the consequent shift not as a movement towards freedom of expression but as an insistence, rather, on freedom to read. The final, contemporary section has much to say about our world right now. Jeremy Fisher tracks the lifting of repressive censorship on gay male literary expression in Australia from the dismantling of comprehensive literary censorship in 1971, reflecting on homosexuality’s status as at once the most troubling category of the twentieth-century obscene and that which has been most transformed. Three final essays, one each on contemporary Iran, Egypt and China, conclude the volume, addressing some of the most repressive censorship regimes on earth. All by younger scholars, they offer acute insights on different issues that remain differently at stake. Sanaz Fatouhi examines the recent proliferation of memoirs published by Iranian women living outside Iran, as first an outpouring of expression after repression, but also to indicate the gendered dimensions of that control, particularly evident in the reception of the genre. Jumana Bayeh’s chapter exposes powerfully the role of literature, especially diasporic literature, in taking up the role of political dissent denied to the press in contemporary Egypt, both as an historical fact and an ongoing urgency. Countering the reductive model of the ‘Facebook revolution’, Bayeh analyses the work of writers such as Nawal El Saadawi and Naguib Mafouz, within Egypt, and, outside the country, particularly Ahdaf Soueif, to show its role in enacting acutely subversive political critique.

Eventually, these flooded the entire kingdom and set the scene for a revolution characterized by the freedom of radically subversive texts to circulate in public space. This conclusion is generally tied to the teleological myth of a heroic enlightenment that swept everything before it and helped ‘cause’ the French revolution of 1789.1 With thousands of clandestine, pirated and unlicensed works circulating, no one was quite sure what was and was not permitted. Meanwhile, at the heart of the regime, enlightened administrators such as Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, who between 1750 and 1763 served as the Directeur de la librairie [Controller of the Book Trade], connived at the circulation of enlightenment classics such as the Encyclopédie and protected the philosophes who produced them.2 Moreover, highly subversive works of scandal and political pornography were pumped into the Bourbon realm by entrepreneurial extra-territorial publisher-wholesalers such as the Swiss-based Société typographique de Neuchâtel [hereafter STN].3 So extensive was this clandestine and pirate commerce that Roger Chartier suggests the illegal sector accounted for half of all books sold in pre-revolutionary France. However, he does not distinguish between the types of illegal work, which ranged from hardcore pornography and scandalous political libelles through to pirate copies of innocuous, permitted works.4 This chapter suggests that this model is inadequately attuned to developments in the final two decades before 1789, when a resurgent Bourbon government tightened its control over the printed word, both inside and beyond French borders. This campaign crushed the extra-territorial publishing industry and brought howls of protest from domestic publishers.5 If the French Revolution was a revolution of print, it was a reaction against a tightening and increasingly effective royal publishing and censorship regime, not the ultimate triumph of an autonomous public sphere. At the heart of Bourbon police apparatus was a system of licencing and amnesties put in place in August 1777 and a brutal decree of 12 June 1783 aimed (ostensibly) at foreign-produced political libelles. These measures, together with others aimed at the\n\n14\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nnewspaper press, consolidated a century-old practice of bringing printers, publishers and writers into collaboration with the regime. The inner workings of the Bourbon censorship apparatus are well documented. Theoretically, most new books could circulate legally only if they had been vetted by the regime’s censors and granted an official permission. Passing through the censorship process often involved elaborate negotiations and resubmission. Individual censors often commented on the literary merit of manuscripts as well as suggesting amendments to content that might offend religion, order or good morals, the three watchwords of the censorship system. As the Almanach de la librairie [Book Trade Almanac] explained, authors and publishers approaching the Bureau de la librairie (the branch of the royal administration charged with regulating the book trade), for permission to publish had a range of options. For posters, ephemera and theatrical works they should apply for a permission de police, but for new books they must choose between a simple and cost-free publishing permission (permission de sceau) or a privilège, which cost 36 livres 12 sous but gave the holder exclusive rights for between two and ten years.6 However, some works, including perennial religious bestsellers such as the Scriptures and Thomas à Kempis’ Imitation de Christ, were owned under perpetual privilège by the University of Paris.7 Within the system of permissions, further gradations developed over time. For example, books denied full approval might circulate under ‘permissions tacites’. Originally designed to allow the legal circulation of works produced abroad, these were soon extended to editions published in France, but not avowed as such. Many ‘tacitly permitted’ works had to appear under a false, foreign imprint, thereby placing subterfuge at the heart of the legal book trade. Such works did not enjoy the same protections as ‘privileged’ titles.8 Equally, many foreign-produced works, most famously the third edition of the Encyclopédie, gained permissions only after lengthy wrangling between foreign publishers and the Bourbon government.9 The gradations, complexities, politics and unevenness in the workings of this system promoted a reflexive self-censorship by publishers and authors, who usually worked in partnership with their censors. The whole censorship apparatus was, moreover, only advisory to the Bureau de la librairie, which enjoyed the power to discipline publishers and printers. Decisions and privilèges could be, and were, occasionally revoked by the Bureau or higher authority. A case in point is ClaudeAdrien Helvétius’ materialist classic De l’Esprit [Of the Mind], whose publication provoked outrage and the sacking of its censor, Jean-Pierre Tercier. Tercier’s case highlights that the system depended upon the foibles of individuals. In fact, French censorship depended on the decisions of a handful of censors. The Directeur de la librarie had between 122 and 189 censors during the final four decades of the ancien régime, but these were divided among several specialist and very unequal categories, viz Theology, Jurisprudence, Natural History, Agriculture, Medicine, Surgery, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics, ‘Belles Lettres, History etc.’, Geography, Engraving, Architecture and Genealogy.10 Even within the larger categories, a handful of men did the bulk of the work. Just five of the 84 censors available examined 40 per cent of the 2,759 works of ‘Belles Lettres and History’ submitted between 1750 and 1763.11 This equates to an average workload of almost one-and-an-half books per month each.\n\nFrench Censorship on the Eve of the Revolution\n\n15\n\nThe backgrounds of censors varied considerably, but most were themselves authors. As such, they commented on fellow writers’ works as government-sanctioned literary reviewers. Their reports, which were frequently published in the works they approved, offered a seal of literary as well as ideological approbation.12 The position of censor, though not directly remunerated, was widely sought after and political opinions had little bearing on the success of applicants. There is evidence, too, that censors valued their intellectual independence. For example, Jean-Baptiste-Claude Cadet de Sainville resisted pressure from the physiocrat controlleur-général des finances [finance minister] Anne-Robert Turgot to suppress a pamphlet on the grain trade by Turgot’s rival and critic Jacques Necker, the Geneva-born financier who would himself become finance minister in 1777. But he also recommended for publication works hostile to Necker’s views.13 Caught in the ministerial crossfire, Sainville used criteria other than ideology or support of the ministry to make his judgements, invoking literary merit alongside considerations of style – authorial restraint, decorous language and, in debate, playing the issue and not one’s opponent.14 However, censors were not neutral arbiters. Enmeshed in the power networks of their academic fields, the temptation to settle literary and professional scores was always present, particularly as the censor’s identity was theoretically secret. In practice, secrecy was often breached and writers sometimes requested and were granted a particular censor. Nor did the censor have to come from an official list. The Directeur de la Librairie frequently sent controversial or useful works to the appropriate minister for approval.15 Thus political and personal considerations might enter the formal censorship process at multiple points, particularly as careerist censors might fear offending powerful interest groups or patrons. Nevertheless, the system was flexible enough in practice that, having been suitably amended, the vast majority of works submitted to the censors were finally approved.16 Moreover, within accepted and state-sanctioned limits, the censorship process could operate as editorial quality control, shaping and even facilitating literary output. Successful passage through the censorship system did not necessarily ensure a happy ending, since central government’s right to censor books was contested by other bodies. The Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne, the high clergy and the parlements all claimed a right of post facto censorship. By the later eighteenth century, the claims of the first two bodies were considerably weakened. Nevertheless, the bishops continued to issue encyclicals condemning ungodly works and the Assembly of the Clergy regularly petitioned for the restoration of a formal ecclesiastical censorship apparatus while negotiating its annual ‘don gratuit’ – a voluntary financial gift to the Crown paid in lieu of taxation. While such pleas were ultimately unsuccessful, the Clergy’s requests for the condemnation of works contrary to religion sometimes succeeded. In contrast, the Sorbonne’s star was rapidly waning, abetted by its heavy-handed and self-defeating condemnation of Jean-François Marmontel’s philosophic novel Bélisaire [Belisarius] in 1768. In asserting – in the capital of the enlightenment – that religious intolerance was an essential feature of Catholicism, the Faculty shattered its own credibility.17 It also helped catapult Bélisaire to the top of the best-seller tables for a decade and more afterwards.18 Issuing from the highest sovereign law courts in France, the claims of the parlements were a more direct challenge to monarchical censorship authority, especially\n\n16\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nas the parlements also had to register royal edicts and new taxes before they could be applied to the territories under their jurisdiction and could thus obstruct royal governance. Of course, many works condemned by the parlements were clandestine titles containing precisely the types of attack on religion, good order and morality that the monarchy and clergy also wished to suppress. Among them, in the period 1765–74 alone, were Voltaire’s Dictionnaire philosophique [Philosophical Dictionary] and Dieu et les hommes [God and Men]; Helvétius’ De l’Esprit; and the arch-materialist Baron d’Holbach’s Contagion sacrée [The Holy Disease], Bon Sens [Common Sense] and Christianisme dévoilé [Christianity Unmasked]. The Paris Parlement also condemned works that touched on its prerogatives or defended its enemies, however, including the rather improbably-titled Histoire impartiale des Jesuits [Impartial History of the Jesuits] in 1768; the Lettres provinciales [Provincial Letters] in 1772; La Voeu de la noblesse [The Nobility’s Wish] in 1773; and Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais’ judicial Mémoires in 1774. Conversely, many remonstrances, edicts and pronouncements of the parlements were suppressed by arrêts [decrees] of the Royal Council.19 From the late 1740s and 1750s the parlements began using arrêts, remonstrances and pamphlets to assert constitutional claims to be the guardians of the kingdom’s fundamental laws, thus setting themselves up as the legitimate forum of opposition to Royal policy. The parlements also declared themselves immune from censorship on several key issues, while insisting on their rights to condemn their opponents’ views. Such debates were played out particularly over religious controversies and the parlements’ claims to jurisdiction in certain matters of religious practice. As confrontation with the Crown heated up, the Paris Parlement moved in 1756 from condemning the pamphlets of its episcopal enemies, many of which were immune to censorship, to condemning works officially approved by royal censors, notably the abbé du Marsy’s La Christiade ou le Paradis reconquis [The Christiade or Paradise Regained] and IsaacJoseph Berruyer’s Histoire du peuple de Dieu [History of God’s People]. Goaded by the parlements, the government acted. On 16 April 1757, amidst hysteria generated by Robert-François Damiens’s assassination attempt on Louis XV, the Royal Council reasserted its supremacy by decreeing that: All those convicted of having composed, having had composed, and having had printed writings that attack religion, disrupt minds, undermine our authority, and disturb the order and tranquillity of our territories, will be punished by death.20\n\nThis draconian policy was never enforced. Nor, even in all its theoretical horror, did it quite match the obscenity of previous centuries, when printers were sometimes burned. Still, as we shall see, the Bourbon regime could be ruthless against those who offended it. The government’s preference, however, was to work with the producers of printed products, to try to cement their co-operation. This had been effected above all by a system of licensing for printers and booksellers, first introduced in 1667. From 1704 the number of printers in each town was limited by law. In some cases the government formally reduced printer numbers, and this nationwide exercise was repeated again in 1777.21 This system allowed the government close control. It also enriched those\n\nFrench Censorship on the Eve of the Revolution\n\n17\n\nprinters and booksellers lucky enough to hold a licence, further encouraging them to toe the line. Effectively the government was attempting to ‘licence loyalty’, as Jane McLeod has put it, and to a large degree this worked. As wealthy local notables, most printers and booksellers were satisfied with the status quo. Although many profited from the Revolution and several became prominent in national affairs, before 1789, few, if any, favoured a free press.22 That said, after 1777, many expressed concerns about the tightening of the system. The primary aims of the six decrees promulgated on 30 August 1777 were to tighten the regulation of the book trade, to consolidate the trade in French hands and to curb copyright piracy. To these ends the government declared an amnesty on all pirated books already in France, provided booksellers and printers declared them to inspectors and had them stamped. It also introduced a new permission simple, whereby printers and publishers could pay a small fee to reprint any work no longer protected by privilège. The revenue raised would finance the appointment of a centrally-paid inspector for each of the country’s 20 Chambres Syndicales (guilds). Meanwhile, existing privilèges were reviewed, and those reserving many classic works in the hands of Parisian printers were annulled.23 This greatly increased the range of marketable works available to provincial publishers, who hitherto had often relied on job-printing. The registers of permissions simples survive, recording print runs for almost 3,000,000 copies of 1,785 editions between 1777 and 1789.24 Yet the vast majority of the books given permissions simples were religious in nature.25 So were most of those stamped under the amnesty of 1777: the pirate sector of the book trade was generally composed of innocuous books, many of which underpinned the altar and French confessional state.26 Some books, however, were beyond all possibility of toleration. These included scandalous works against Marie-Antoinette, notably the Vie privée de Marie-Antoinette d’Autriche, Reine de France [The Private Life of Marie-Antoinette of Austria, Queen of France], the Amours de Charlot et de Toinette [The Love Life of Charlie and Toinette] and the Portefeuille d’un talon rouge [Briefcase of a Dandy].27 These works, which have spawned a large secondary literature, allegedly dragged the reputation of the Queen through the dirt, desacralized the monarchy and helped to provoke the French revolution.28 It has generally been assumed that such sensational works circulated widely before the revolution, as did a handful of scandalous pamphlets about Louis XV’s final two mistresses, Madame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry.29 Yet is this credible? After all, Marie-Antoinette was no haute bourgeoise parvenu like Pompadour, nor a plebeian courtesan like Du Barry. She belonged to the oldest, most powerful royal dynasty in Europe. She was the daughter of an Empress, sister of an Emperor, wife of the King of France, mother of the heir to the Bourbon throne and the incarnation of the Bourbon-Habsburg alliance. Slurs against her marital chastity were crimes of near unthinkable lèse-majesté. This truth has long been overlooked due to the diamond necklace affair, a criminal scandal in which Cardinal Louis de Rohan had the temerity to base his defence on claims that he had been duped into participating in a spectacular swindle by a prostitute impersonating the queen, in a fleeting midnight rendez-vous in the Versailles palace gardens. Rohan, a prince of the Church and distant\n\n18\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\ncousin of the Queen, was perhaps the only man in France who could with impunity have concocted such a tale, let alone persuaded the Parlement of Paris to accept his defence. Rohan’s actions and the parlement’s nakedly political verdict provoked the Queen’s implacable hatred, since they implied that Marie-Antoinette was the kind of wanton woman who might indeed arrange such an assignation.30 Rohan might dare venture such allegations, but lesser mortals who dabbled in libelles against the monarchy or highly placed courtiers lived in terror. The regime had a record of silencing such dissidents before their works got to market. Between 1659 and 1789, some 300 writers, including Voltaire, were imprisoned arbitrarily in the Bastille, usually for relatively short periods.31 Libellistes were usually treated rather severely when captured, but the priority was to silence them by any means possible. In 1744, the journalist Dubourg was seized from the Rhineland, carried to Mont SaintMichel, and suspended bent in a cramped cage. Wracked in agony, he was released by death 18 months later. The Marquis de Fratteaux was seized on the streets of London in 1753 and whisked off to the Bastille, where he spent more than two decades. His fate was widely publicized. From 1763 to 1764, the renegade diplomat Charles d’Eon de Beaumont used the British press to allege that similar attempts were being prepared against him, while between 1770 and 1772 his fellow Burgundian exile, Charles Théveneau de Morande, survived several kidnap and assassination attempts whilst working on a scandalous life of Du Barry. In the end Morande and d’Eon were both bought off by the monarchy, which used the playwright Beaumarchais as an agent, and in 1778 and 1781 the French government paid to suppress two further libelles, and the Amours de Charlot et de Toinette and Le Guerlichon femelle [The Fancywoman].32 Knowledge of such pay-offs spawned a minor industry in blackmail pamphlets in London and the Low Countries, always with the aim of negotiating a suppression fee, but this remained a dangerous business. In 1784, Anne-Gédeon de Lafite, Marquis de Pelleport, was lured to Calais, seized and imprisoned in the Bastille for composing such libelles. His friend, the future revolutionary Girondin leader Jacques-Pierre Brissot, though probably innocent of any involvement, was arrested, held for three months, and then sent into internal exile. Finally, in 1791, the Countess de La Motte, the mastermind behind the diamond necklace scam, hurled herself from the third floor window of a London apartment block to escape British bailiffs, believing they were working with French kidnappers intent on preventing publication of her mendacious memoirs against the Queen. She died a few weeks later of internal wounds.33 These tales of scandal and skullduggery suggest that, when the French government targeted its efforts carefully and pragmatically, its control apparatus could prove terribly effective. Although a number of titles were printed and suppressed, there is no credible evidence that anti-Marie-Antoinette libelles circulated among the public prior to 1789. Whenever rumours of their existence seeped out, secret policemen, as well as the authors of underground newsletters, booksellers and journalists found them as elusive as the scarlet pimpernel. Surviving copies seem to have emerged from the Bastille in the Revolution – hastily reprinted, some were marketed with the tagline: ‘This work was found in the Bastille.’34 And once government stopped paying the\n\nFrench Censorship on the Eve of the Revolution\n\n19\n\nblackmailers in 1783, the production line for libelles ceased operating overnight.35 But by then another decree, on 12 June 1783, had had profound effects on the wider trade. The full effects of the decrees of 30 August 1777 and 12 June 1783 on the trade of a major foreign publisher, the STN, can now be quantified, using a database that breaks down and renders analysable details of their trade, recording the supply origins and sales destinations for around 450,000 books.36 Drawn from the extensive surviving archival records, the data has been enriched with key markers of the illegality of works to enable specific manipulation within the dataset, noting, for example, all 720 works belonging to Darnton’s Corpus of Clandestine Literature.37 Previous studies of the illegal trade, including those by Darnton and by the current author, have suggested that the decree of 12 June 1783 for a while seriously disrupted the illegal trade in these works – but was this correct?38 The 12 June 1783 decree was ostensibly targeted at preventing scandalous pamphlets against Marie-Antoinette reaching France. This was probably only a pretext. Requiring the redirection to Paris for inspection of all book imports into France, the decree marked the culmination of a century-long reduction in points of entry and significantly increased the cost of importing books for the provinces. It particularly harmed the Swiss booksellers, as they were located further from Paris than their Dutch or Rhenish rivals. But how effective was this measure against the clandestine trade? Mapped data of evidence derived from the STN database (see Fig. 1.1) suggests that the decree severely damaged the Swiss book-dealers’ trade in pornographic works – defined by the STN database as books containing explicit descriptions of the genitals or sexual acts for the purpose of sexual arousal. And it also damaged their regular trade. Yet despite protests from Swiss publishers and French book dealers alike, the Bourbon government did not relent.39 Static maps can deceive however and further research suggests that 12 June 1783 was not the turning point. Instead, the decrees of 30 August 1777 (although targeted at a different kind of illegal work) had already driven clandestine pornographic works from the French market. These decrees stamped out much cross-border commerce: the sector hit hardest appears to have been the hardcore clandestine trade. A measure designed to curb book trade copyright piracy had the collateral effect of inhibiting the trade in pornography. Figure 1.2 overleaf shows that, prior to 1777, the French were the STN’s best clients for such material, taking almost every book sold. This compares to France’s average market share across all books of about 36 per cent. But after 1777 the French took very little of this literature. How did this compare to the decrees’ impact on the wider market? For the totality of Darnton’s 720 work Corpus, which includes materialist philosophy, anti-clerical ribaldry and politically-scandalous works alongside pornography, there is a similar fall – though not as significant as for pornography (see Fig. 1.3). Some clandestine works were still slipping through. Despairing of off-loading their illegal stock, in April 1779 the STN dumped much of it on a dealer named Malherbe, who in turn used it to supply a band of roving colporteurs (travelling booksellers) across western France. This dumping of books – unique in the STN’s history – has been excluded from Figs 1.2 and 1.3 (along with\n\n20\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nFig. 1.1: STN sales of illegal pornographic works to France, broken down by state and town, January 1769–June 1783 (above) and July 1783–December 1787 (below).

A slump also hit STN book sales to France generally, but the dip was less than for clandestine literature and lasted less time. The STN trade in legal books recovered quite quickly from mid-1778, driven by the activities of a travelling\n\n22\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nFig. 1.4: Total STN sales to France, 1769–94. salesman called Favager, reaching a new peak in 1781.40 The new trade was short-lived, however: after the decree of 12 June 1783 the STN’s French sales never again reached the more modest levels they had enjoyed in the mid-1770s. The digital evidence suggests that the French decrees did squeeze pornography out of that market and were fairly effective against other clandestine books. However, they did so largely in 1777 not 1783. Contrary to its original intent, a measure designed to stop piracy actually killed the clandestine and pornographic trades, while the 1783 decree against radical pornography delivered a body blow to Swiss export publishing in general. Could the French also control the wider public sphere in France or across Europe? Increasing evidence suggests that they were becoming more effective at this, too, by the 1770s. One key target was the cosmopolitan international press, produced primarily in the Netherlands, the Rhineland, London and the Papal enclave of Avignon. French-language international gazettes had been produced in the Netherlands since the Huguenot diaspora and served as Europe’s elite press throughout the eighteenth century.41 By 1781, one in three newspapers distributed by the French mail service was an international gazette, and these also circulated widely throughout Europe. Containing a diet limited primarily to political news information, with little editorial colour, these gazettes nevertheless offered ideological and practical challenges to the French government. Faced with a growing need for financial credit and hence to inspire public confidence, it needed the gazettes to promote its own news agenda and supplement information from its governmental and diplomatic networks.42 But the French government feared to intervene too publicly, since it was important that news appeared independent, so it indulged in a cat-and-mouse style game with journalists within and beyond its borders, seeking to influence their copy but not too obviously. For this purpose they used techniques ranging from diplomatic threats and outright bans to bribery and news management.43 Such policies could have striking impact. In the first three months of 1771 the Dutch gazettes were full of stories and documents\n\nFrench Censorship on the Eve of the Revolution\n\n23\n\nrelating to chancellor René-Nicolas de Maupeou’s attempts to radically remodel the French parlements. Most such documents were propagandist proclamations emanating from the parlements, but a series of threats to ban Dutch gazettes from France had their desired result. By mid-March pro-parlement propaganda materials had disappeared from the gazettes and they remained excluded for the duration of the Maupeou crisis. More effective still was a 1781 round-up of the nouvellistes (newsmongers) who supplied the gazettes with Parisian copy: embastilled for ten days, on their release they were either banned from corresponding with foreign editors or placed under surveillance and licensed.44 Yet, despite the success of its seduction of printers and its campaigns to control illegal works, literary piracy, foreign imports and newspaper journalism, mounting evidence suggests that the French government’s censorship apparatus faced the wrong direction. Censorship was predicated on the assumption that the printed word had the potential to disrupt order and even to threaten the regime. But it was also assumed that this threat came primarily from low-born malcontents and disreputable foreign elements.45 Historians, too, have tended to assume that a rising tide of ‘public opinion’ from an increasingly democratic public became a growing challenge, and that printers, authors and other cultural intermediaries became increasingly frustrated with the censorship regime. Eventually, in the revolution of 1789, this alliance of public and cultural intermediaries swept all before it.46 In reality, the threat came from within the elite, and the most significant oppositional genre was not books or newspapers, but political pamphlets. They remained the most effective printed genre for political comment up to the revolution.47 This was certainly the retrospective view of the Parisian police chief Jean-Charles-Pierre Lenoir, whose office worked closely with the Direction de la Librairie. Writing in postrevolutionary exile in his (unpublished) memoirs, Lenoir painstakingly explored the links between printing and politics during his watch in the 1770s and 1780s.48 He was adamant that the main danger to the government came not from a rising of the public sphere or any accompanying process of ideological erosion, but rather unbridled factionalism and rampant pamphleteering in the heart of the political elite itself. In the controlled and censored press system of the ancien régime, only the elite and those they protected could safely fund and produce political pamphlets with immunity and in secrecy.49 Such pamphlets were usually produced for immediate clandestine circulation and were often distributed outside formal commercial channels and for a limited audience. Despite the influence attributed to public opinion by contemporaries and historians, many pamphlets were not aimed at the general populace nor even a bourgeois readership. Instead, they aimed at a narrower elite audience, suggesting that their authors believed that real power and influence continued to be vested in the court rather than public opinion. Many pamphlets emanating from this aristocratic and parliamentary elite were able to evade the censorship. As we have seen, the parlements asserted immunity for publications defending their own prerogatives, and the bishops pumped out polemical tracts with the same de facto freedom. High profile litigants were also free to publish legal trial briefs in which they argued their cases before the public, and many leading\n\n24\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nlawyers used this freedom to publish anthologies of their best and most prominent speeches. Over the century, as Sarah Maza has shown, a politicized bar increasingly (ab)used this freedom to publish polemical trial briefs depicting their clients as victims of arbitrary government and despotic ministers. Such pamphlets did seek to address a wider public and were often distributed or sold in their thousands.50 In this way radical reformers, zealous parlementaires and political opportunists were able to turn incidents such as the Kornmann affair, a seemingly innocuous adultery and divorce case, into an opportunity to attack the ministry, just as Rohan and his allies used his appearance before the Paris Parlement over the diamond necklace scandal to settle scores with the Crown.51 The extent of elite complicity in pamphleteering was laid bare by the Le Maître affair of 1785–6. In December 1785, a wealthy lawyer, Pierre-Jacques Le Maître, was apprehended at the gates of Paris carrying the page proofs for a clandestine pamphlet. The new police minister, Louis Thiroux de Crosne, considered releasing him, no doubt figuring he had powerful allies, but against the minister’s better judgement was persuaded to interrogate him with a view to a public trial. In the weeks that followed, Le Maître drip-fed his interrogators enough information to implicate numerous present and former allies in the pamphleteering campaigns of the past two decades, and the trail led straight to the top.52 Le Maître’s involvement with clandestine pamphleteering dated back to the early 1770s and the parlements’ campaigns against the Maupeou ministry. Lenoir’s memoirs tell how leading activists in the parlementary network, notably the abbé Jabineau and Le Maître himself, revealed ties to prominent figures, including Malesherbes and Armand-Thomas Hue de Miromesnil, who in 1774 was appointed Keeper of the Seals (Garde des Sceaux). Lenoir reports that his own friend and patron, Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, comte de Maurepas, the elder statesman who served as political mentor to Louis XVI, was also involved.53 According to Lenoir, these men were central to the clandestine pamphleteering of the Maupeou years (1771–4), but operated within established political parameters, respecting the person of the reigning monarch. Only after Louis XV’s death in 1775 and the consequent disgrace of Du Barry did scandalous printed pamphlets against monarch and mistress begin to circulate.54 For Lenoir, the pamphleteering of the Maupeou era, seen by some historians as a dress rehearsal for revolution, was the ephemeral output of a political faction brought together by circumstances.55 Such factional alliances were temporary and mutated over time. In the political world of the ancien régime, where political advancement depended on the king’s favour and ministries were but collections of individuals, talented ‘outs’ often moved rapidly from opposition to government. Moreover, opposition was articulated against a particular minister or cabal, not royal government in general. A wise ruler tried to keep a lid on interpersonal politics, but also rewarded and advanced talented and powerful critics, as long as they played within the rules. Thus by 1783 the factions lined up rather differently. Though Le Maître had begun his pamphleteering career in the service of Miromesnil, at that time first Président of the Parlement of Rouen, a decade later he was attempting to oust him from government, while working for a new patron, Chrétien-François de Lamoignon, a kinsman of Malesherbes. That particular\n\nFrench Censorship on the Eve of the Revolution\n\n25\n\ncampaign foundered when Lenoir persuaded the king to declare that Miromesnil enjoyed his full confidence. However, by the time of his arrest, Le Maître was involved in a new virulent campaign against Miromesnil and the controlleur-général CharlesAlexandre de Calonne. Against the background of the diamond necklace affair, which was beginning to create bitter divides between the allies of the Queen and members and clients of the Rohan clan, Le Maître’s arrest threatened to expose raw nerves at the heart of government. When Le Maître shrewdly named one of the queen’s favourites as one of his major collaborators, he ensured that the eventual result would be a cover-up. With so many powerful figures in both parlements and successive ministries implicated, the Paris Parlement quietly quashed all proceedings.56 Lenoir’s evidence also suggests that much of the apparently radical, pre-revolutionary output of prominent revolutionary writers and politicians, including Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, Brissot, Jean-Louis Carra and Antoine-Joseph Gorsas, should be tied to wealthy patrons. He claimed that Mirabeau’s celebrated attacks on agiotage (speculating on artificially inflated share values) were commissioned by ‘the government’, which was also directing the efforts of Mirabeau’s patron, the future revolutionary finance minister Etienne Clavière, and apparently Brissot, too.57 On a more personal level, he was convinced that retrospective attacks on his record as Lieutenant-Général of Police of Paris were orchestrated by other ministers, including the reactionary Baron de Breteuil and Lomenie de Brienne, the conniving archbishop of Toulouse. Lenoir bitterly resented these attacks, believing they took place with the connivance of his successor de Crosne.58 Tellingly, Lenoir was also convinced that most pornographic libelles against the queen drew their materials from court, where verbal and manuscript slanders had been circulated by anti-Austrian elements from early in the reign. Courtiers, in his view, also printed and protected many of the scandalous pamphlets that appeared in France itself.59 Whether Lenoir’s suspicions and testimony were correct in every detail is less significant than his more general description of how factional politics operated. He relates that his attempts to smash the Parlementaire and Jansenist networks had been frustrated by the classic cellular organizational structures through which pamphlets were produced and disseminated. Hence, under interrogation, the abbé Jabineau informed Lenoir that the Jansenist-parlementaire network printed its Maupeouana on around 20 clandestine presses. This was a substantial number: in May 1769 the licenced printers of Paris had 317 presses between them, but only 160 were in use (roulantes).60 Unlike the Parisian printers’ equipment, which was under near constant surveillance by the inspecteurs de la librairie, the Jansenist-parlementaire presses were frequently transported from place to place to minimize the risk of detection, and their operators were unaware of one another’s identities. Likewise, the pedlars and colporteurs did not know which printers supplied them. The whole operation was funded from a secret war chest operated by princes of the blood, peers of France and other leaders in the legal and financial worlds. These people were all but untouchable. Although many of their presses were mothballed after the Maupeou crisis, Jabineau warned that the whole machinery would be ready at the first sign of political crisis – which, according to Lenoir, is precisely what happened in 1789.61\n\n26\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nThe Bourbon government’s attempts to control the printed word were thus surprisingly effective, particularly in the final years before the revolution. The censorship apparatus shaped the bulk of literary output in ways that were far from uniformly negative, while the publishing industry had been, to a considerable degree, seduced by government, though it retained links to other powerful patrons, especially in the parlements. The circulation of the most obnoxious forms of political pamphlet had been seriously disrupted or completely curtailed. Piracy had been largely eliminated; foreign publishing scotched. But these objectives and the assumptions that lay behind them were largely misdirected. In so far as the printed word represented a threat to the regime, the danger from abroad or below had been largely neutralized. Instead, the most politically destabilizing material came from within the elite itself, as a consequence of rampant factionalism and unbridled infighting. Thus, when the pre-revolutionary crisis broke, France’s ruptured and fratricidal elite quickly splintered and turned on itself. Such a rupture is generally a pre-condition for successful revolution. The pamphleteering of the pre-revolution was thus both symptom and aggravating factor of the rift that made possible the greatest of all revolutions.\n\nNotes 1 Jane McLeod, Licencing Loyalty.

However, it should be noted that several nineteenth-century sources record a cult of (an otherwise unknown) Saint Guerlichon built around veneration of a priapic Roman statue: the saint was said to be able to cure female infertility. The cult was based around the abbey of Bourg-Dieu in Berry. 33 Burrows, Blackmail, Scandal and Revolution, pp. 88–136.

John Keats\n\nI. In May 1817, the radical English writer, printer, publisher and multimedia pressman, William Hone, was charged with blasphemous and seditious libel. He had written and published three liturgical parodies that used well-known passages from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer to attack the Tory government of Lord Liverpool. In the UK, govenment is carried out in the name of the monarch. By the early 19th century British monarchs had very few powers. The Late John Wilkes’s Catechism of a Ministerial Member, The Political Litany, Diligently Revised and The Sinecurist’s Creed, or Belief. Hone was charged on ex officio information and imprisoned under a newly-minted Suspension of Habeas Corpus Act (1817), the latest, together with the Seditious Meetings Act, of the so-called ‘Gagging Acts’, which were a series of increasingly repressive legislative instruments, enacted from 1795 to 1819, designed to regulate popular radical activity.1 After five months’ imprisonment without trial, Hone was released to find that he would have to face court after all. The trials took place over three successive days, on 18–20 December, before a jury of the King’s Bench at the Guildhall in London, presided over by Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough. In the first two trials, Hone was charged with blasphemous and seditious libel, and in the third exclusively with blasphemous libel. Hone undertook his own defence and won. The trials were a widely-reported sensation, and Hone’s triumphant acquittal brought him instant national celebrity, making him a legend of popular radicalism. This popular celebrity encouraged Hone to publish The Three Trials of William Hone in January 1818, and the trials quickly became recognized as landmark cases in the establishment of a British free press and the fight against censorship. In this essay, I engage the Hone trials as an initiatory instance of the nineteenthcentury literary censorship trial, and I explore censorship as a feature of the literary\n\n34\n\nCensorship and the Limits of the Literary\n\nfield by analysing the trials as together a complex literary, social and political performance event. For the extraordinary theatricality of Hone’s trials resisted and defeated government censorship by turning the institutional machinery of censorship into a parody of itself. Hone defeated government censorship by forcing censorship’s regulatory regime into a self-parodic role, within Hone’s own parodic performance. By focusing on this mode of parodic performance – the interpellation of government censorship within a performance that defeats it – I seek to demonstrate the productivity of censorship. A larger question of the essay, then, is to what extent does the genre of the courtroom trial spectacularize the productivity of censorship? How can censorship be understood to function as a productive phenomenon? Here, I mean productive not in the sense that censorship is benign, but in the sense that it facilitates textual and performative agency as well as the productive reception and performance of the literary text. I wish to emphasize the way in which censorship – through the machinery of the libel trial – acknowledges the force and significance of the relationship between the literary text and the world in which it acts and, more importantly, it acts upon.\n\nII. Prohibitions on libel and slander were the earliest forms of legal control exercised by the British state upon writing and speech, respectively. From the seventeenth century, when heresy was distinguished from blasphemy, blasphemy changed from being a purely ecclesiastical offence to a civil one.2 Blasphemous libel and seditious libel were both notoriously difficult to define. Modern censorship is based on a shift from pre-publication to post-publication censorship. In England, pre-publication censorship of publish"
