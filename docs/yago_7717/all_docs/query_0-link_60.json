        "text": "Citation preview\n\nTake One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film Edited by Wyndham Wise\n\nTake One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film is the most exhaustive and up-to-date reference book on Canadian film and filmmakers, combining over 700 reviews and biographical listings with a detailed chronology of major events in Canadian film and television history. Compiled by Wyndham Wise, the publisher and editor of Take One, Canada's most respected film magazine, and with a foreword by Canadian director Patricia Rozema, this is the only reference book of its kind published in English. Each film title is listed with credits, a mini review, and significant awards. Biographical listings of directors, producers, actors, writers, animators, cinematographers, distributors, exhibitors, and independent filmmakers are accompanied by date and place of birth, date of death if applicable, a brief career overview, and a filmography. Wise celebrates Canadian achievement on both a national and an international scale, and juxtaposes the distinctly Canadian with Canada's exports to Hollywood: Maury\n\nChaykin and Jim Carrey, John Candy and William Shatner, Mon Oncle Antoine and Porky's, Highway 61 and Meatballs, The Red Violin and The Art of War. From great early Hollywood stars such as Walter Huston, Fay Wray, Mary Pickford, Norma Shearer, and Marie Dressier, to our current crop of star directors including Patricia Rozema, Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg, Denys Arcand, Peter Mettler, Guy Maddin, and Robert Lepage - Canadians have made an important but largely unrecorded contribution to the history of world cinema. Impressive for its breadth of coverage, refreshing in its opinionated informality, this comprehensive and lively look at Canadian film culture at the start of the twenty-first century admirably fills the gaPWYNDHAM WISE is the publisher and editor-in-chief of Take One: Film & Television in Canada, published five times annually.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nTake One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film Edited by Wyndham Wise\n\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PRESS Toronto Buffalo London\n\nÂ© University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2001 Toronto Buffalo London Printed in Canada ISBN 0-8020-3512-4 (cloth) ISBN 0-8020-8398-6 (paper)\n\nPrinted on acid-free paper\n\nNational Library of Canada Cataloguing in Publication Data Main entry under title: Take One's essential guide to Canadian film ISBN 0-8020-3512-4 (bound)\n\nISBN 0-8020-8398-6 (pbk.)\n\n1.

Trudeau died recently. I now wish I had made contact. He was our leading man for so many important years. He was our star. And we never once worried that he'd move to Los Angeles. We choose our stars. Who we pick speaks volumes about us. I think it might be useful to consider what our nation's selection of Trudeau tells us about ourselves. As members of the collective writing and directing team of the 'Late Twentieth Century Canadian History Movie,' what type of central character did we choose? Well, we thought, let's pick one who is cosmopolitan and undeniably intelligent. His journey must call forth the language of justice, pride, and finely spun philosophy. Of course, if he's going to be interesting to just about everybody, he'll have to be good-looking, yet not too good looking. Just the proper blend of the individual with the classic; the\n\nrandom ~ that odd little slant of the eye - woven into the eternally right. Our star needs to be an original. One with an aristocratic sense of entitlement, along with the greatness of vision to worry about the vulnerable among us. He must be straight but not narrow; let him declare that the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation. He should be unquestionably comfortable in the world's great cities, and at home alone in the wilds. We'll need a few gags, and some pirouettes. Let him flip the bird (this is not a character desperate for our approval) and have a rocky, splashy love life. In his later years let's give him an alternative family structure. And he must know the value of a rose. Trudeau. The collaborative imagination of our country couldn't have constructed a more alluring and admirable character. We can be proud of our creation - he was a character of range, subtlety, and quiet authority, and beneath this stillness he had an inexplicable boisterous life force that unsettled the surface of any description. Yes. This is a leading man worth watching. But why have we not tried to fabricate someone this spectacular in our movies? He is not a recognizable protagonist we find as we flip through the directory of our cinema. Why do we continue with modest people leading modest lives?\n\nForeword Perhaps the most enlightening question is not what leading character we chose, but what type of film we made. If Trudeau were this movie, what sort of movie would he be? It seems we created an art film - certainly no blockbuster this one. Not pandering to the Americans, we designed a truthful creation that played well in festivals, but not necessarily in malls. The narrative was dense, and perhaps even erratic - no clear career-building narrative thrust in this number. Ours is a work of fairly elevated culture without tremendous mass marketable appeal (much to the distress of our industry types). We sense that originality and success are strangers to each other. 'Success' in the mass market is often forgotten. Originality, however, has children. It is felt. The money comes later. Something\n\nx\n\nwithin us, within our nation, cries out for the original. We must, like our favoured leading films, speak to the new. So it was for Pierre Trudeau and so it is for all our finest cultural expressions, whether they be in collaborative nation building or in creating our own national cinema. As we survey the contents of Take One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film and consider the films we have funded, shot, and feted, we see a portrait of a nation - a nation that carries a conviction deep within itself that we are most ourselves when we try to be new, to be different from what has gone before. We are a country and a film industry as yet unimagined with purpose far beyond survival. PATRICIA ROZEMA\n\nPreface\n\nTake One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film began as an issue of Take One published in the summer of 1996 in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of film in Canada. This issue, which featured 100 of the most famous Canadians who made a living in film, whether at home, in Hollywood, or abroad, engendered a shock of recognition. From the stars of silent movies, such as Fay Wray, Walter Huston, Mary Pickford, Norma Shearer, and Marie Dressier, to our current crop of star directors, including Robert Lepage, Patricia Rozema, Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg, and Denys Arcand, Canadians have made an important but largely unrecorded contribution to the history of cinema. There are a number of earlier reference guides to Canadian film. My goal, with Take One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film, is to continue the process of charting our national cinema that was begun almost thirty years ago by Eleanor Beatty in The Handbook of Canadian Film (1973,2nd ed. 1977) and Canadian film history professor Peter Morris in The Film Companion (1984). Both of these volumes are now out of print, and the paradigm of Canadian feature filmmaking has changed dynamically since 1984. English-speaking Canadian cinema is no longer an under-appreciated cousin of Quebec cinema. With the\n\nemergence of the Toronto new wave in the 1980s, and the corresponding growth of independent features from Newfoundland, the Maritimes, Quebec, the Prairies, and British Columbia, Canadian films now take their place with the best the world has to offer. The more than 700 entries in Take One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film identify Canadians who have made a contribution to the world of cinema and important, award-winning Canadian films that have made an impact on our national culture. However, this guide is by no means complete. It is a start, a work in progress, that will grow with each new edition. A number of individuals and films have been omitted due both to space constraints and to the availability of the films to be viewed (always a problem when it comes to Canadian film). It is my intention that these will be included in future editions. This guide would not have been possible without reference to the following publications: Eleanor Beattie, The Handbook of Canadian Film, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Peter Martin and Associates, 1977); Peter Morris, Embattled Shadows: A History of Canadian Cinema, 1895-1939 (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1978); Peter Morris, The Film Companion (Toronto: Irwin, 1984); D. John Turner, The Canadian Feature Film Index, 1913-1985 /\n\nPreface Index desfilm canadiens de long metage, 1913-1985, French text by Micheline Morisset (Ottawa: Public Archives of Canada, 1987); Donald Bidd, ed., The NFB Film Guide, 1939-1989 (Montreal: National Film Board of Canada, 1991); Michel Coulombe and Marcel Jean, eds, Le Dictionnaire du cinema quebecois, 3rd ed., rev. and enlarged (Montreal: Editions du Boreal, 1999); Who's Who in Canadian Film and Television / Qui est qui au cinema et a la television au Canada, 2000 ed. (Toronto: Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, 1999); Maria Topalovich, And the Genie Goes To ...: Celebrating 50 Years of the Canadian Film Awards (Don Mills, ON: Stoddart, 2000). Take One's Essential Guide to Canadian Film would not have been published without the helpful assistance and encouragement of Eve Goldin, senior library technician at The Film Reference Library, Toronto, and members of the Take One editorial board including: Tom McSorley, the executive director of the Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa; Maurie Alioff, a film journalist and screenwriter who teaches screenwriting at Vanier College; Cynthia Amsden, editor-in-chief of Canadian Weeklies\n\nxn\n\nSyndicate; and Matthew Hays, the associate editor of the weekly Montreal Mirror. I would also like to thank the following Take One writers for their contributions: Angela Baldassarre, Pamela Cuthbert, Paul Eichhorn, Tim Foley, Marc Glassman, Barbara Goslawski, Laurence Green, Lee Parpart, and Isa Tousignant. And finally, I would like to offer my deepest gratitude to Ruth Pincoe, Geri Savits-Fine, and Susan Tolusso, who helped with the difficult task of copy editing and cross-referencing the entries, and Jill McConkey of the University of Toronto Press, whose enthusiasm and support made Take One's Essential Guide possible.\n\nOrganization Cross-references to other entries in the Guide are indicated by an asterisk.

This 'quota quickie' was one of a dozen B movies featuring lumberjacks and mounties that were made for the British market during the late 1930s on Vancouver Island with minor Hollywood talent. Across the Border was shot back-to-back with Convicted in the winter of 1937, and released in London, England, two months later. Both films show glimpses of a future Hollywood screen goddess - Rita Hayworth, age nineteen, had been in the movies for only two years.\n\nAcker, Sharon Actor; b. Toronto, 1935. A leading lady seen mostly on American television (she played Perry Mason's loyal secretary Delia Street in the last season of the long-running series) who occasionally appeared in films. Acker began her career as a model and joined the Stratford Festival company in 1956. A brief acting stint in England led to a part in the comedy Lucky Jim with Terry Thomas. Ten years later she was in John Boorman's cult classic Point Blank with fellow Canadians John Vernon* and Lloyd Bochner.* She also appeared in Paul Almond's The Act of the Heart* Films and television include: Lucky Jim 1957; 1+1: Exploring the Kinsey Reports 1961; Waiting for Caroline 1967; Point Blank 1967; The First Time 1969; Don't Let the Angels Fall 1969; The Act of the Heart 1970; The Senator 1970-1 (series, one of three rotating elements from The Bold Ones); The New Perry Mason 1973-4 (series); Executive Suite\n\nAction: The October Crisis of 1970 1974 87m prod NFB, p Tom Daly, Normand Cloutier, Robin Spry, d/narr Robin Spry, ed Shelagh MacKenzie, Joan Henson. A thoughtful look at the October Crisis, when FLQ terrorists kidnapped a British diplomat and killed Quebec cabinet minister Pierre Laporte. Compiled from news footage and other films, Action portrays past and contemporary independence moments, the rise of the separatist movement in Quebec following the death of Maurice Duplessis, and the confusion and dismay when the Canadian army was ordered out to patrol the streets of Montreal. The 'stars' of the film are Pierre Trudeau, Rene Levesque, Robert Bourassa, Jean Drapeau, and of course, the terrorists themselves. See also Reaction: A Portrait of a Society in Crisis. (V)\n\n1971118m prod NFB, p Guy L. Cote, Paul Larose, d Michel Brault, Pierre Perrault, ph Michel Brault, ed Monique Fortier, mus Majorique Duguay, Valere Blais. This important direct-cinema documentary - much admired in Quebec, but less so by Acadians - covers the protests in 1968 and 1969 at 1'Universite de Moncton in support of French-speaking students in New Brunswick. The film, which focuses on the street marches and sit-ins, includes interviews with students as they discuss what it means to be Acadian. The protests ultimately failed to move the university establishment, and the conclusion seems to be that the French fact is safe only within the borders of Quebec. (V)\n\nAct of the Heart, The 1970 103m prod Quest Film Productions,\n\nAdams, Beverly\n\np/d/sc Paul Almond, ph Jean Boffety, ed James D. Mitchell, mus Harry Freedman, Gilles Vigneault; with Genevieve Bujold, Donald Sutherland, Monique Leyrac, Gilles Vigneault, Bill Mitchell, Sharon Acker. The second of three films by Paul Almond* featuring his wife at the time, Genevieve Bujold* (see also Isabel ai\\4 Journey). Martha (Bujold), a religious young girl from the Quebec North Shore, arrives in Montreal to serve as a nanny to a widowed business woman (Leyrac) and her son Russell (Mitchell). She joins a local church where she becomes infatuated with the priest (Sutherland*). When Russell dies in an accident, Martha temporarily loses her faith and declares her love for the priest. They live together, but she is consumed by guilt over her moment of weakness and commits suicide. The film split critical opinion: some called it pretentious while others found it had rich, deep subject matter. It won six Canadian Film Awards but was a box-office failure. Awards include: CFA: Director, Actress (Bujold), Art Direction, Overall Sound, Sound Editing, Musical Score. Adams, Beverly Actor; b. Vancouver, 1945. Adams, a lovely, sensual actress who appeared in 1960s kitch classics such as How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (with Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon), also played the recurring character of Lovey Kravezit in the series of Matt Helm spy-comedy films starring Dean Martin. She retired from acting after her marriage to hair stylist Vidal Sasson. Films include: The New Interns 1964; How to Stuff a Wild Bikini 1965; Murderers'Row 1966; Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die 1966; The Silencers 1966; Birds Do It 1966; The Ambushers 1967; Torture Garden 1967; Hammerhead 1968; Mind Games 1996.\n\n4\n\nAdjuster, The 1991102m prod Ego Film Arts, Family Viewing Productions, p Camelia Frieberg, Atom Egoyan, d/sc Atom Egoyan, ph Paul Sarossy, ed Susan Shipton, mus Mychael Danna; with Maury Chaykin, Jennifer Dale, Patricia Collins, David Hemblen, Arsinee Khanjian, Elias Koteas, Don McKellar, Gabrielle Rose. Insurance adjuster Noah Render (Koteas*) attempts to restore the damaged lives of his clients. His methods are unorthodox. He sleeps with most of them, puts them up in a designated hotel, and quotes his profession's code to them like a mantra: 'You may not know it yet, but you're in shock.' This amoral yet compassionate protagonist who lives with his filmcensor wife (Khanjian*) in a barren, unfinished suburban development is one of Egoyan's* most strangely compelling creations. Egoyan's effective use of wide screen portrays the terrifying abyss that separates Noah from everyone he encounters. The Adjuster - a haunting drama of disconnection and desire - is a searching re-interpretation of Luis Bunuel's Nazarin, with distant echoes of Andrei Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice. (V) Adventure ofFaustus Bidgood, The 1986 110m prod Faustus Bidgood Productions, p/d/sc Andy Jones, Michael Jones, ph/ed Michael Jones; with Andy Jones, Greg Malone, Robert Joy, Maisie Rillie, Mary Walsh, Cathy Jones. This film was created by what was essentially the core of the Newfoundland comedy group Codco. The legend of The Adventures ofFaustus Bigood is its ten years in the making. Once completed, however, it received little commercial distribution and remains difficult to find. Crammed with gags, off-the-wall ideas, and freewheeling experiments in form, the film chronicles the final days\n\nAho ... an coeur du monde primitif in office of Faustus Bidgood, an obsequious little bureaucrat (played with winning numbness by Andy Jones*) who, after a decidedly lachrymose revolution, becomes the first ruler of the People's Republic of Newfoundland - a twisted take on Canadian documentaries mixed with a large dash of Monty Python: very bizarre and very funny.\n\nAffaire Bronswik, L'\n\n1978 24m prod NFB, p Rene Jodoin, d/sc Robert Awad, Andre Leduc, an Andre Leduc, Robet Awad, Jean-Michel Labrosse, ed Robert Awad, nan Ian De Voy. A clever satire of conspicuous consumption and the documentary genre. Directors Robert Awad and Andre Leduc combine live action with animation to 'document' stories about unfortunate consumers whose psyches are invaded by subliminal waves emanating from their Bronswik TV sets. The victims are 'forced' to buy things they don't really need, and then interviewed by the filmmakers in a realistic manner. The film's humorous, tongue-in-cheek style masks a disturbing message about media manipulation and the power of the steady flow of television commercials. Awards include: CFA: Theatrical Short.\n\nAfterlife\n\n1978 7ml2s prod NFB, p Derek Lamb, d/an Ishu Patel, mus Herbie Mann. This animated short from the Indian-born Ishu Patel* uses innovative techniques with back-lit plasticine to offer impressionistic and visionary views of the eternal question: Is there life after death? The film, based partially on case histories that provide some evidence of an afterlife, blends modern and ancient beliefs with transcultural myths. (V) Awards include: CFA: Animated Short.\n\nAfter the Axe\n\n1981 56m prod NFB, exp Arthur Ham-\n\nmond, p Sturla Gunnarsson, Steve Lucas, d Sturla Gunnarsson, sc Steve Lucas, ph Andreas Poulsson, ed/narr Roger Mattiussi, mus Patricia Cullen, Sharon Smith; with James Douglas, Janine Manatis, Anne Christison. This docudrama examines executive terminations and the growth industry of relocation counsellors. Biff Wilson (Douglas), a senior marketing executive, is let go from a major food company after fifteen years of solid service. His fall from security and status to dependent house-husband, as his children come to resent him and his former colleagues avoid him, is detailed with the use of non-actors and real-life situations and locations. The film, a damning account of a corporate culture that stresses success over compassion, received an Academy Award nomination for Short Documentary. (V)\n\nAgnes of God\n\n1985 98m prod Albion Films, p Norman Jewison, Patrick Palmer, d Norman Jewison, sc/play John Pielmeier, ph Sven Nykvist, ed Antony Gibbs, mus Georges Delerue; with Jane Fonda, Anne Bancroft, Meg Tilly, Janine Fluet, Deborah Grover, Michele George. Agnes of God, Norman Jewison's* only Canadian film, is based on the popular play by John Pielmeier. The plot concerns a young nun (Tilly) who is accused of giving birth to an illegitimate baby and then killing the child. This heavy, even hysterical, melodrama with no clear moral solution provides a field day for its two American leads, Fonda and Bancroft. It was shot by Ingmar Bergman's ace cinematographer, Sven Nykvist. (V)\n\nAho ... au coeur du monde primitif\n\n1975 91m prod Les Productions Via la Monde Canada, p/d/sc Daniel Bertolino, Francois Floquet, ph Francois Boucher, Daniel Bertolino, Francois Floquet, ed Francois Arnaud, Pierre Larocque, mus 5\n\nAir Bud\n\nPat Prilly. A visually arresting documentary about the last surviving primitive tribes around the world. The filmmakers travelled to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, the jungles of Brazil, and the Congo River basin to record this fascinating study of a world rarely captured on film. Perhaps the most successful section is on the pygmy tribes of the Congo and their relationship with the jungle that surrounds them. Scenes of filing teeth and ritual circumcision are not sensationalized, but rather portrayed as an integral part of the tribal ethos. The closing scenes - showing tribal women doing exercises directed by a gramophone-toting white woman and men working with giant forest-clearing machines - are devastating. Awards include: CFA: Feature Documentary.\n\nAir Bud\n\n1997 97m prod Keystone Entertainment, Walt Disney Pictures (U.S.), exp Michael Strange, Michael Vince, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein, p Robert Vince, William Vince, d Charles Martin Smith, sc Paul Tamsay, Aaron Mendelsohn, ph Mike Southon, ed Alison Grace, mus Brahm Wenger; with Michael Jeter, Kevin Zegers, Wendy Makkena, Bill Cobbs, Eric Christmas, Nicola Cavendish. Air Bud, a modest boy-and-his-dog Disney knockoff, tells the sentimental and mostly cliched tale of Buddy, a lovable basketball-scoring stray, and Kevin (Zegers), a lonely, inward boy. Buddy escapes the clutches of a bad-tempered clown (Jeter) and is befriended by Kevin, who discovers his hoop abilities. Through a series of improbable events, Buddy becomes the star of the local high school basketball team. When the misanthropic clown returns to reclaim his dog, events culminate in a climatic chase. Warm performances, especially by Zegers, Makkena (as the mother),\n\n6\n\nand Cobbs (as an ex-pro coach), enliven an otherwise paint-by-numbers script.

The first dramatic feature film produced by a Quebec religious community tells the story of a young man's struggle to leave his wealthy life of comfort for a missionary calling - forceful but dated propaganda for the Catholic Church narrated by Rene Levesque, the future Quebec premier. Aldon, Mari Actor; b. Toronto, 1927. During the 1950s, Aldon was a minor leading lady with Canadian stage and radio experience who managed to appear in a few good movies (The Barefoot Contessa, Summertime). She retired in 1955 after her marriage to Hollywood director Tay Garnett.

One of the first NFB films to be produced, directed, written (Jane Marsh Bevridge*), and shot (Judith Crawley*) by women. Alexis Tremblay is an idyllic portrait of life of a rural Quebec family who live in the Charlevoix region along the St Lawrence River. Each season has its tradi-\n\nAlligator Shoes\n\ntions and rituals (spring planting, fall harvest, winter chores, etc.) overseen by the Catholic Church. For years this was one the NFB's most popular films, although today its view of 'happy peasants' in the bosom of a benevolent church seems rather quaint and outdated.\n\nAlias Will James\n\n1988 83m prod NFB, p Eric Michel, d/sc Jacques Godbout, ph Jean-Pierre Lachapelle, ed Monique Fortier, mus Robert M. Lepage, Ian Tyson. A poetic and loving look at the life of Ernest Dufault, a Quebecois who claimed to be a cowboy from Montana. During the 1920s, under the name of Will James, he became known in Hollywood as a writer and illustrator of westerns. The film explores Dufault's contribution to the myth of the Old West and parallels his life with modern Quebecois pursuing cowboy aspirations on the American rodeo circuit. A quest for a Quebecois hero and an examination of the subconscious framework of the human imagination form the basis for one of Jacques Godbout's* best films, with particularly evocative songs by Ian Tyson. (V) Allan, Ted Writer; b. Alan Herman, Montreal, 1916; d. 1995. Ted Allan was Canada's leading left-wing writer of books, screenplays, and radio, television, and live drama. His life was defined by an obsession with Dr Norman Bethune, his comradein-arms during the Spanish Civil War. Allan co-wrote a biography of Bethune The Scalpel The Sword (1952) - and battled for nearly fifty years to make a movie about the Canadian surgeon who became a hero of the Chinese revolution. After an arduous production, Phillip Borsos's Bethune: The Making of a Hero* based on Allan's script and starring\n\nDonald Sutherland,* was released in 1990 to almost universal critical condemnation. In 1976, Allan's autobiographical screenplay for Jan Kadar's Lies My Father Told Me* won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award.

The Allen brothers, along with their father Bernard, opened their first Theatorium' in 1906 in Brantford, Ontario, and formed one of Canada's first distribution companies, the Allen Amusement Corporation. They built their first luxury theatre in Calgary in 1912 and by 1918 owned the largest chain in Canada. In 1922, after losing a fierce bidding war for first-run features, they went bankrupt and sold all of their fifty-three theatres to the Americanowned Famous Players Canadian Corporation. This would be the last time Canadians made a significant impact through ownership of a national exhibition chain until Garth Drabinsky* built up Cineplex Odeon in the 1980s. The Aliens continued to exhibit films, and they operated Ontario's largest independent theatrical circuit prior to the Second World War.\n\nAlligator Shoes\n\n1981 98m exp Don Haig, Barry Shapiro,\n\n7\n\nAlmond, Paul\n\np Clay Borris, John F.

Two brothers (played by real-life brothers Garry and Clay Borris) drink, carouse, and make trouble while holding close to 'down home' family values of the Maritimes. Their life is changed forever when a mentally unhinged aunt (Jones) comes to stay. Clay Borris's intensely personal drama drew a great deal of critical attention and was invited to the Cannes Film Festival, but the film received only limited distribution and Borris's promising career never materialized. Almond, Paul Producer, director, and writer; b. Montreal, 1931. From the mid-1950s into the 1960s, the Oxford-educated Almond directed more than 100 dramas for CBC-TV and British television. When he turned to feature filmmaking, he attracted domestic and international attention with a trilogy of understated, highly interiorized explorations of mind and spirit, starring his then wife, Genevieve Bujold.* In the title role of Isabel* she almost drowns in a flood of threatening memories. In The Act of the Heart* Bujold plays a troubled woman who falls in love with a priest (Donald Sutherland*) who is living through his own spiritual crisis. In Journey* Almond cast Bujold again as his destabilized protagonist, along with John Vernon.* Almond's attempt to establish an art cinema met with critical resistance and only modest commercial success, leading to his absence from filmmaking for nearly ten years. He returned in 1980 with Final Assignment, again starring Bujold, but the film was a critical and box-office disap8\n\npointment.

Anderson Lee, Pamela Actor; b. Ladysmith, B.C., 1967. Pamela Denise Anderson was the first baby born in Canada on 1 July 1967; she received the title of Centennial Baby, and her parents won several cash prizes and awards. She moved to Vancouver in 1988, and her career was launched when a cameraman noticed her at a B.C. Lions football game and put her up on the stadium screen. She found work on the sitcom Home Improvement and was cast as a regular on Baywatch. Anderson has had a rocky marriage to Motley Criie drummer Tommy Lee, and her first attempt at a movie lead in Barb Wire proved to be less of a box-office hit than anticipated. However, due to the unparalleled worldwide success of Baywatch and V.I.P., Anderson remains one of the most recognizable women on television today. Films and television include: Home Improvement 1991-3 (series); Baywatch 1992-5 (series); Barb Wire 1996; V.LP. 1998-present (series). Animation The roots of animation in Canada lie in Great Britain. John Grierson* and Nor-\n\nAnimation\n\nman McLaren/ both from Scotland, transformed filmmaking in Canada in the early 1940s. Grierson, the founder of the NFB, always claimed that his finest discovery was McLaren, whom he persuaded to come to Canada to make animated films. When he arrived in Ottawa in 1941, McLaren was immediately put to work creating propaganda pieces for the war effort, and within a year, he was asked to create an animation unit for the Board. The crack team he assembled included Jim McKay, George Dunning* and Rene Jodoin. McLaren's interest was in formal experiments, particularly drawing directly on celulloid. His animated works were not character or plot driven; in conscious opposition to Hollywood cartoons, his films were abstract, operating on principles of rhythm, melody, and colour. His style and philosophy influenced Canadian animation both at the NFB and in the private sector, which began to grow with the establishment of Dunning and McKay's Graphic Associates in Toronto in 1949. With Colin Low's The Romance of Transportation in Canada* (1953), a sense of character and incident entered animation at the NFB. As McLaren's successor as head of the animation department, Low* helped to foster the new generation of artists who entered the Board in the late 1950s. Among them were Derek Lamb,* Kaj Pindal,* Arthur Lipsett,* and Gerald Potter ton.* McLaren gave informal animation classes to these youngsters, but the films they produced were quite different from his stylized works. Humorous shorts such as Pindal's What on Earth!* (1966) and Potterton's My Financial Career* (1963) told tales in a manner that communicated directly to Canadian and international audiences. In the 1960s, Wolf Koenig* replaced his collaborator Colin Low as the head of the NFB animation department, and\n\nmore importantly, Rene Jodoin was made executive producer of a new French department of animation. Jodoin's unit produced both abstract pieces and simple stories with limited dialogue. Foreign talent such as Co Hoedeman* and Bretislav Pojar were brought in to augment a talented crew that included Quebecois pin-screen wizard Jacques Drouin and experimentalist Pierre Hebert. By contrast, the English department, spearheaded by Derek Lamb, contributed well-plotted, often sardonic pieces by such talents as Caroline Leaf,* John Weldon,* and Eugene Fedorenko. Many of their films were multi-award winners. Frederic Back,* the German-born animator who spent his career in McLaren-like freedom at SRC, also won two Academy Awards: for Crac! (1982) and for The Man Who Planted Trees (1987). The 1970s saw the growth of private animation houses as commercial work in television became plentiful. Such companies as Nelvana* in Toronto, Cinar in Montreal, International Rocketship in Vancouver, and Crawley Films and Lacewood Productions in Ottawa became important players in the North American marketplace. Community colleges established credit courses, and graduates, especially from Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario, continued the high standards set by the NFB. More recently, Canadian animators have infiltrated Disney and Industrial Light and Magic, contributing to the success of such megahits as Aladdin, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Jurassic Park, The Mask, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, often with the use of groundbreaking Canadian software programs created by Alias/Wavefront, Side Effects, and Softimage. With the NFB's tenth Academy Award (for Bob's Birthday*) in 1995 and Alias/ Wavefront's Academy Award nomina9\n\nAnne Trister\n\ntion for its experimental short, the end, in 1996, Canadian animators continue a proud tradition of producing some of the best work in the world.

The title character, Anne Trister (Guilhe), is a young Swiss-Jewish artist who is profoundly affected by the death of her father. She leaves Switzerland for Quebec to visit her friend Alix (Marleau), a psychologist to whom she becomes attracted. Through her work, Alix has developed an emotional bond with Sarah (Laurier), a rebellious child with an enormous need to be loved. Detached from the world around her, Anne takes over a vacant studio to paint a gigantic fresco and throws herself into a series of impulsive affairs. In this feminist, abstract drama with an emphasis on the characters' emotions rather than on plot, director Lea Pool* delicately creates an overlapping world where Anne, Alix, and Sarah explore the many improbable forms of love and dependency.

Toronto, 1918; d. 2000. Louis Applebaum was perhaps Canada's most prolific composer of film music. He studied at the University of Toronto before moving to New York to further his education. There he fell in love with the worlds of theatre and movies. He wrote over 250 scores for the NFB (including Alexis Tremblay: Habitant* Around Is Around* The Fight: Science against Cancer* Royal Journey* The Stratford Adventure* Paddle to the Sea*), and his score for The G.L Joe Story earned an Academy Award nomination in 1947. He also composed music for dozens of plays at the Stratford Festival, which he helped launch with Tyrone Guthrie in 1953. During the 1980s he fronted the Applebaum-Hebert advisory committe on federal cultural policy.

If Canadian cinema is in some way defined by Norman McLaren's* pristine animation, Ted Kotcheff's* version of Mordecai Richler's* novel comes across like a burp at a society ball. Duddy is an early Canadian feature that's not afraid to get its hands dirty in the material world. A young Jewish hustler grasps for success and breaks the hearts of everyone around him. Despite the fact that Duddy Kravitz is a louse, you can't stop yourself from responding to his naively hopeful, crackling energy. It may be in bad taste, but it jumps at you in Dreyfuss's career-\n\nArcand, Denys\n\nmaking performance. All Kotcheff had to do was keep up with the pace. (V) Awards include: CFA: Film of the Year, Sound Recording; AAN: Adapted Screenplay; Berlin Film Festival: Golden Bear. Arcand, Denys Director and writer; b. Deschambault, Que., 1941, brother of Gabriel Arcand. Denys Arcand is now firmly established as one of Canada's handful of star directors, but not too long ago, he was worried about ending up in the Salvation Army hostel he could see from the room where he was writing Le Declin de Vempire americain* Before the huge success of this breakthrough film, Arcand had been labelled an unbankable troublemaker, the kind of filmmaker who made politically explosive documentaries such as On est au colon* In the mid-1980s, although he had won acclaim for a string of irreverent fiction features and a couple of mainstream hits in Quebec, this so-called agent provocateur found it hard to make a living in the movie business. Arcand's films portray a world so irredeemably corrupt that he has been accused of being a cynic and a nihilist. However, his movies also convey inherent values expressed with wit and insight. 1 can't bear people who don't want to see what appears, to me, to be reality/ Arcand once told Cinema Canada. 'I don't know why. I've always been that way ... it seems to me that the first attribute of humanity is intelligence.' Arcand spent his childhood in a riverside village, then moved to Montreal, where he attended a Jesuit school. In 1962, after an apprenticeship in the University of Montreal's theatre groups, he and some friends (including Denis Heroux* and Stephane Venne, with the assistance of established NFBers, Michel\n\nBrault,* Gilles Groulx,* and Bernard Gosselin*) made a film about student life, Seul ou avec d'autres. Then, like most budding filmmakers, Arcand went to work for the NFB. The commissioned documentaries he shot didn't cause much of a stir until the Board refused to release On est au coton, a gritty, angry expose of Quebec's textile industry. Although copies of the film were circulated clandestinely, the ban lasted six years. When Arcand turned to fiction, his work began to modulate outrage with the amused disdain of a sophisticated observer. In Rejeanne Padovani,* a sleazy construction mogul has his unfaithful wife murdered during a party and entombs her under the asphalt of a justcompleted highway. Arcand expresses shock at the depravity of his characters but he is aware of the layer of comedy they provide. By the time he directed Le Declin which picked up the International Film Critics' Award at Cannes, nine Genies, and an Academy Award nomination, and remains one of the most profitable Canadian movies ever made - Arcand admitted that he felt affection as well as amusement for his self-deceptive, philandering characters. In fact, his biting humour can turn on a dime into passionate intensity. Jesus de Montreal* released in 1989, is perhaps Arcand's richest, most rewarding creation. In it he orchestrates perfectly timed mood swings between reverence and irreverence, detached irony and dark tragedy. In Le Declin and Jesus, Arcand mastered the unobtrusive visual style and rapid pacing that he admires in classic American moviemaking. No matter how bizarre the content, his approach to filmmaking is straightforward, understated, and laconic. In this, Arcand resembles the Spanish master,\n\n11\n\nArcand, Gabriel\n\nLuis Bunuel, another cool, witty minimalist who swam through powerful currents.

In spite of an impressive list of film and stage credits, Gabriel Arcand still considers himself an apprentice in his craft. He spent his formative years - professionally speaking - at the Centre national dramatique de Marseilles in France, and in Poland, where he studied theatre. Since his screen debut in Denys Arcand's La Maudite Galette, he has become established as Quebec's iconic strong, silent type, and has given subtle but powerful performances in a wide range of films, including Rejeanne Padovani* Les Plouffe* Le Crime d'Ovide Plouffe, Le Declin de I 'empire americain* and Post Mortem* Films include: La Maudite Galette 1972 (a/mus); Rejeanne Padovani 1973; Gina 1975 (a/mus); Les Vautours 1975; Ti-Cul Tougas 1976; Parlez-nous d'amour 1976; Panique 1977; Au revoir ... a lundi 1979; Suzanne 1980; L'Affaire coffin 1980; Les Plouffe 1981; Memoire bat12\n\ntante 1983; Le Crime d'Ovide Plouffe 1984 (GA-A); Agnes of God 1985; Le Declin de I'empire americain 1986 (GA-SA); La Ligne de chaleur 1987; Les Portes tournantes 1988; Les Matins infideles 1989; Nelligan 1991; Le Sang du chasseur 1995; Post Mortem 1999 (PJ-A); Le Grand Serpent du monde 1999. Archangel 1990 82m prod Ordnance Motion Pictures, exp Andre Bennett, p Greg Klymkiw, d/ph/ed Guy Maddin, sc Guy Maddin, George Toles; with Kyle McCulloch, Kathy Marykuca, Ari Cohen, Sarah Neville, Michael Gotti. Set in the remote northern Russian town of Archangel at the end of the First World War, Archangel is the story of Lieut. John Boles (McCulloch), a one-legged amnesiac Canadian soldier. As he fights courageously in a strategically suspect set of battles that are made more vague by the general amnesia afflicting most of those around him, Boles searches for his beloved, Iris. This trouble, as we know and as Boles has forgotten, is that Iris is dead. Shot in sumptuous black and white worthy of Josef von Sternberg, and filled with slices of the surreal and the cruel, Guy Maddin's second feature is a masterpiece - a wistful, luminous conflation of absurdity, high romance, and heroic delusion. Buster Keaton would have approved. Bunuel, too. Around Is Around 1951 10m prod NFB, British Film Institute, p/d Norman McLaren, an Norman McLaren, Evelyn Lambart, mus Louis Applebaum.

Not since Porky's* and The Changeling* in the 1980s has a Canadian genre film performed so well at the box office. This James Bond-style action flick has super agent Snipes working for the United Nations in pursuit of a high-level diplomatic assassin. He jumps off high buildings and kung-fus his way through fancy receptions, working for a duplicitious boss (Archer) who, in turn, works for the Canadian Secretary General (Sutherland*). Director Duguay* (Screamers*) has an original visual style and is a master of long tracking shots\n\nwith a Steadicam, but he is less successful in staging large action sequences. He keeps pulling his punches, and Snipes fails to bring any life or humour to what is essentially a cartoon character.\n\nAtlantic City\n\n1980 105m prod International Cinema Corporation, Selta Films (France), exp Joseph F.

The most stylish and cinematically satisfying co-production made to date, this French-American-Canadian hybrid stars Lancaster in one of the finest performances of his long career as Lou, an overthe-hill, two-bit hood still on the make. His relationship with Sally (Sarandon), a small-town girl from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, who works at an Atlantic City casino clam bar but dreams of becoming a Monte Carlo croupier, leads to an unexpected windfall when her sleazy, dope-dealing ex-husband (Joy*) arrives in town with her pregnant sister (McLaren). Lancaster's subtle performance, combined with Guare's almost flawless script and Malle's elegant direction, earned Atlantic City five Academy Award nominations, and is the only Canadian dramatic to feature to date to be nominated for Best Picture. The film also made Sarandon a star.

In his debut feature, Claude Jutra* takes the viewer on a virtually plotless excursion into his own psyche at a decisive moment in his life. As the film's restless young hero, Jutra chases around Montreal, searching for personal, political, and sexual identity. He says yes to his homosexuality, and ends a real-life affair with a Haitian woman (Harrelle). As director, Jutra discovers a relentlessly jittery, ad libbing style that is an ideal match for the slaphappy turmoil that the picture aims to evoke. Today, the classic French New Wave moves of this film are being revived, not only by directors ranging from Wong Kar-Wai to Oliver Stone, but also in mainstream television series such as NYPD Blue. A tout prendre can be loosely translated as 'Everything's Up for Grabs.'

When Quebec cabinet minister Pierre Laporte was murdered in November 1970, his separatist killers stuffed his body into the trunk of a green Chevrolet sedan. In Andre Forcier's* characteristically loopy Au clair de la lune, the same model car is home to the two marginalized protagonists. Bert (L'Ecuyer) tries to make the snowbound car more homey and dreams of regaining his title as the neighbourhood's top bowler. Francois\n\n14\n\n(Cote) is a buckskin-dressed albino who can literally walk on air. Au Clair de la lune is about abandoned people yearning for miracles, and is as much historical allegory as it is surreal slapstick comedy.

Beyond Parliament Hill, however, the capital connection to hilarity must have deeper roots. After all, Dan Aykroyd, the multi-talented comic, impressionist, actor, and writer is only the latest incarnation of Ottawa humour - his generation's successor to Rich Little. Aykroyd studied criminology at Carleton University before embarking on a career that has included stints with Second City and Saturday Night Live.

One of the best documentaries from the Candid Eye* series, which stressed a direct approach to the subject at hand. The Back-Breaking Leaf paints a graphic picture of the tobacco harvest in southwestern Ontario from the point of view of transient field workers. (V)\n\nBack, Frederic Animator; b. Saarbruecken, Germany,\n\n1924. It is a measure of Back's extraordinary abilities as an artist that his legitimate concerns for ecology, nuclear peace, and animal rights have not overwhelmed his films. Two Academy Awards and numerous international jury prizes testify to this animator's skill in dramatizing his ideals. Soon after his arrival in Montreal in 1948, Back found permanent employment at SRC, first in its graphics department and since 1970 as a full-scale animator. Cruel, his first Academy Award winner, is a subtle, political, pro-provincial tribute to folk art in Quebec. Back received his second Academy Award for The Man Who Planted Trees, an elegiac portrait of a French-Canadian Johnny Appleseed. Back's impressionist and painterly work typifies the strengths he brought to bear on his acclaimed stained glass in Montreal's Place des Arts subway station. Films include: Inon on la conquete dufeu 1971; La Creation des oiseaux 1973; Illusion? 1974; Taratata 1977; Tout rien 1978 (AAN-AS); Crac! 1982 (AA-AS); The Man Who Planted Trees 1987 (AA-AS); The Mighty River 1994.\n\nBack to God's Country\n\n1919 79m prod Canadian Photoplays, Curwood-Carver Productions (U.S.), exp Ernest Shipman, d David M.

Walker, Dal Clawson, ed Cyril Gardner; with Nell Shipman, Charles Arling, Wheeler Oakman, Wellington Playter. Back to God's Country, Canada's most successful silent feature film, is an overwraught and at times unintentionally funny melodramatic tale featuring Nell Shipman* as a plucky heroine who possesses a remarkable natural affinity with wild animals. It is particularly memorable not only for the scenes of Shipman interacting with a bear in its natural habitat, but also for the first\n\n15\n\nBadgley, Frank\n\nnude scene in Canadian cinema. Recently, the film has been revived by feminists because of its strong female lead and the significant role played by Shipman in the film's script and production.\n\nJesus de Montreal 1989; L'Assassin jouait du trombone 1991; Love-moi 1991; Bulk 1991 (d); Montreal vu par... 1991 (co-sc); So/o 1991 (d); Le Sexe des etoiles 1993 (d); Un 32 aout sur terre 1998.\n\nBadgley, Frank Administrator and director; b.

In 1927 he was appointed director of the Bureau, a job he held until its absorption into the NFB in 1941. He wrote, directed, and edited Lest We Forget (1935), a film about Canada's participation in the First World War, and perhaps the Bureau's most notable film.\n\nBain, Conrad Actor; b.

He has performed mostly on and off Broadway and at the Stratford Festival. He was a member of the Lincoln Center Repertory Company, where he appeared in Chekhov's Uncle Vanya directed by Mike Nichols.

Toronto, 1921. As one of the most profilic of the many producer-directors at the NFB during its glory years, Bairstow oversaw the production of more than 200 films from 1944 to 1974. His Royal Journey* an account of the five-week visit of the young Princess Elizabeth to Canada and the United States in the fall of 1951, proved to be a hit with its theatrical release and became the most successful NFB film to that time. In 1969, Bairstow spent a year with the Australian Commonwealth Film Unit.

Bar salon, a simple, effective story shot with a kind of poetry, is about a saloon owner in his fifties who is about to lose his bar, but manages to buy another only to lose it as well after an affair with a topless dancer. This downbeat, 'nee-realistic' film established Andre Forcier* as major talent in Quebec cinema at the age of twenty-five. He showed a great deal of insight into his characters and their working-class background. He didn't hesitate to take sides with the people in his film, who seem neither resigned to nor overjoyed about their lot in life and show no particular desire to improve it.\n\nBattle of the Long Sault, The\n\n1913 2 reels prod British American Film Co., p Frank Beresford, d Frank Crane; with Frank Crane and the Indians of the Caughnawaga (now Kahnawake) reserve.

The Bay Boy, which was adapted from a screenplay by Daniel Petrie,* follows the passage through adolescence of Donald Campbell (Sutherland*), a Cape Breton teenager whose family is struggling during the Great Depression. Donald is expected by his mother (Ullmann) and the nuns at his school to enter the priesthood, but instead is driven by his lust for the daughter (Pinsent) of a local police officer (Scarfe). However, complications arise when he witnesses the death of an elderly Jewish couple. The film launched Sutherland's career.

Beaudin, Jean Director, writer, and editor; b. Montreal, 1939. Although Beaudin has taken a few shots at wild and visionary moviemaking, he will be best remembered for the restrained performances and fastidious visuals of pictures such as his 1977 success, J.A. Martin photographe* which has been consistently nominated by critics as one of the best Canadian features ever made. At Cannes the film won a Best Actress Award for star Monique Mercure* and attracted Robert Altman to the cinematography of Pierre Mignot. Since J.A. Martin, Beaudin's career has been focused in Quebec with the film version of Being at Home with Claude* and the hit mini-series, Les Filles de Caleb. Beaudin has complained on many occasions that Canada's inadequate featurefilm budgets severely restrict the imagination.

Begone Dull Care, the quintessential jazz film, is a visual expression of music performed by the Oscar Peterson Trio. Norman McLaren* and Peterson developed the music together - two master soloists echoing and challenging one another in a complex interactive improvisation. McLaren deftly displays his full range of cameraless animation techniques, indulging a particular interest in texture that expands the film's already complex rhythms. Begone Dull Care, one of his most intricately detailed films, features spectacular shifts of mood and style that still impress today (V) Awards include: CFA: Special Award. Being at Home with Claude 1992 85m prod Les Productions du Cerf,\n\nBethune\n\nNFB, p Louise Gendron, Doris Girard, d/ sc Jean Beaudin, play Rene-Daniel Dubois, ph Thomas Vamos, ed Andre Corriveau, mus Richard Gregoire; with Roy Dupuis, Jacques Godin, Jean-Pran^ois Pichette, Gaston Lepage. Jean Beaudin's* film is a fine example of successful stage-to-screen adaptation, relying on the original eponymous theatrical work by Rene-Daniel Dubois. Set in Montreal, the film opens with a graphic sex scene between two men that ends in murder. Through the remainder of the film, Roy Dupuis,* the hustler/lover/ murderer, attempts to explain his motivations for the killing to the police. Beaudin's intelligent handling of the material and Dupuis's chilling performance enhance the film's overall impact. (V) Berman, Brigitte Director; b. Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 1951. After studying film at Queen's University, Berman worked at the CBC for nine years before directing her first independent documentary, Bix: Ain't None of Them Play like Him Yet. Her next documentary, Artie Shaw: Time Is All You've Got* about the legendary New York jazz great, captured an Academy Award in 1987, and is one of only three Canadian feature documentaries to do so. Berman's weak foray into fiction, The Circle Game, included an amazing soundtrack but fumbled the conflicts between a musician and her estranged mother. Films include: Bix: Ain't None of Them Play like Him Yet 1981; Artie Shaw: Time Is All You've Got 1985 (AA-FD); The Circle Game 1994.

One of the best English-Canadian docudramas to come out of the 1960s, produced by the NFB for broadcast on CBC-TV. The Best Damn Fiddler is a realistic account of an itinerant bush worker (Wiggins) living in the rural area of the Ottawa valley who can't make enough money to feed his large family but nevertheless rejects government handouts. His tough self-reliance and hard-drinking lifestyle is viewed with compassion as his family ekes out an existence in a life of isolation and deprivation. The oldest daughter (Kidder*) eventually leaves home to find work and a better future. (V) Awards include: CFA: Film of the Year, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor (Wiggins), Cinematography (B+W), Editing, Art Direction.\n\nBete lumineuse, La\n\n1982 127m prod NFB, p Jacques Bobet, d Pierre Perrault, ph Martin Leclerc, ed Suzanne Allard; with Louis-Philippe Lecuyer, Philippe Cross, StephaneAlbert Boulais, Maurice Chaillot. A group of men depart for a weekend hunting trip in rural Quebec. One man among them - an earnest, philosophical teacher and poet - is so out of place that he soon becomes an even more pathetic victim of hormonal persecution than the moose the men have come to kill. Directed by Pierre Perrault,* the nearlegendary Quebecois poet, filmmaker, and anthropologist, La Bete lumineuse suggests there is a fundamentally ugly component in male bonding - something that makes sport of attacking anyone who refuses to play by the rules. (V)\n\nBethune\n\n1964 59m prod NFB, exp Guy Glover, p/sc Donald Brittain, John Kemeny, d Donald Brittain, ph Robert Humble, Francois\n\n19\n\nBethune: The Making of a Hero\n\nSeguillon, Murray Fallen, ed John Kemeny, nan Lister Sinclair. Bethune is a biography of Norman Bethune, the Canadian doctor who served first with the loyalist forces against the fascists during the Spanish Civil War and later with the Mao's Red Army in China, where he died operating under fire. Subsequently he was hailed as a hero of the revolution. The film, created from photographs and interviews with surviving friends and collegues, is held together with Donald Brittain's* marvellous commentary, which takes the view that Bethune - a committed communist - was a 'great man.' This approach made the NFB nervous. Because of its political implications, the film never received official approval. In spite of the controversy, Bethune was a great success in Canada and the United States. (V) Bethune: The Making of a Hero 1990 117m prod Filmline International, August First Film Studio (China), Parmentier/Belstar Productions (France), p Nicolas Clermont, Pieter Kroonenburg, Wang Xingang, Jacques Dorfmann, d Phillip Borsos, sc Ted Allan, ph Mike Molloy, Raoul Coutard, ed Yves Langlois, Angelo Corrao, mus Alan Reeves; with Donald Sutherland, Helen Mirren, Helen Shaver Colm Feore, James Pax, Guo Da, Anouk Aimee. A rare Canadian epic, Bethune: The Making of a Hero is more famous for its lengthy, arduous production and the bickering between the star and the writer than for anything else. Right from the start Donald Sutherland* and Ted Allan* clashed over the interpretation of Bethune's legacy. Sutherland (who is a dead ringer for Bethune) passionately believed that despite his drinking and womanizing, Bethune became a saintly hero in China, whereas Allan (who had served with Bethune in Spain) equally passionately believed he\n\n20\n\nremained a deeply flawed man until the end. Director Phillip Borsos* was caught in the middle of these conflicting visions and it shows. Despite its subject matter, the film lacks dramatic focus. With a budget of $20 million, it was the most expensive Canadian feature of its time, but it was universally panned and became a major box-office disappointment. (V) Awards include: GA: Costumes. Between Friends 1973 90m prod Clearwater Films, exp Chalmers Adams, d Donald Shebib, sc Claude Harz, ph Richard Leiterman, ed Tony Lower, Donald Shebib, mus Matthew McCauley; with Michael Parks, Bonnie Bedelia, Chuck Shamata, Henry Beckman, Hugh Webster. In spite of the mythic resonance and justified fame of Coin' down the Road* Between friends is really Shebib's* finest effort. This tale of a botched mine robbery in Northern Ontario involves the troubled quartet of Chino (Shamata), his American surfing buddy Toby (Parks), his girlfriend's father Will (Beckman), and Coker (Webster). While the robbery is being planned, Chino's girlfriend Ellie (Bedelia) becomes attracted to Toby. It is a taut, serious dramatic study of loyalty, CanadaU.S. relations and the limitations of male bonding. Between Friends is also distinguished for its intelligent, suggestive use of desolate Northern Ontario landscapes and its failed heist sequence that rivals any film noir you can name. Beveridge, Jane Marsh Director, editor, and producer; b. Ottawa, 1915. Although she was one of about a dozen women at the NFB during the Second World War, Beveridge was the only woman to direct and produce war films. She served as de facto producer of the Canada Carries On* series, helming six films in two years, but\n\nBlack Christmas\n\nshe quit over conflicts with John Grierson,* who refused to promote her. Although its overtly feminist script was watered down, Women Are Warriors stands out as one of the few wartime films to argue that women were not leisurely idlers before the conflict. Beveridge's Alexis Tremblay: Habitant* shot by the legendary Judith Crawley,* was one of the most popular shorts in NFB history. Beveridge abandoned filmmaking in the early 1950s to become a teacher and sculptor. Films include: Women Are Warriors 1942; Inside Fighting Canada 1942; Proudly She Marches 1943; Wings on Her Shoulders 1943; Alexis Tremblay: Habitant 1943; Air Cadets 1944.\n\na Fipa d'or at Cannes for Best Drama Series. Biname has also directed a number of feature-length films, the bestknown of which is Eldorado* a groundbreaking film in the history of Quebec cinema created through a process of improvisation. His most recent feature is La Beaute de Pandore.

From the wacky imagination of Winnipeg animator Richard Condie* comes this tale of a middleage and decidedly odd couple who play a game of scrabble, while the world literally blows up around them. They cheat, scheme, and chew on the furniture, blissfully unaware that global nuclear war has broken out. They only realize what's going on when the game is over and they go outside. This very funny and unexpectedly off-the-wall film received an Academy Award nomination for Animated Short. (V)\n\nBiname, Charles\n\nDirector, writer, and actor; b. Herve, Belgium, 1949. Blessed with a golden touch, Biname has pursued a career in documentary film, advertising, acting, and screenwriting.

This independently produced, semi-improvised drama from Larry Kent,* one of the original English-Canadian auteurs of the 1960s, is about the sexual shenanigans of a self-involved young playwright (Scarfe) who throws away his marriage and his last hope for spiritual integrity for the sake of an ego-gratifying fling.\n\nBlack Christmas\n\n1974 98m prod August Films, Vision iv Productions, exp Findlay J.

As the holiday season approaches, a college town is terrorized by a psychopathic killer. One by one the residents of a sorority house are brutally slain by a heavy-breathing maniac armed with plastic wrap and some serious\n\n21\n\nBlack Robe\n\nchildhood traumas. The film acts as a somewhat less-than-graphic precursor to the impending run of slasher films in the later 1970s and 1980s (such as Prom Night* and Halloween), and offers a preview of such horror conventions as the prowling, subjective camera, the slaughter of sexy but dumb young women, and the uncertain death of the killer at the end.

The hostile wilderness of seventeenth-century New France is the setting for this compelling examination of the clash between the differing belief systems of the French settlers and the Algonquin natives. Based on Brian Moore's* acclaimed novel, the film tells the story of Father Laforgue (Bluteau*), a young, idealistic Jesuit whose mission is to save the souls of the native 'savages/ Laforgue's physical and spiritual journey deep into northern Quebec, accompanied by Algonquin guides and a French carpenter, culminates in a deeper understanding of and a new-found respect for the people he set out to convert.

A poetic documentary about Newfoundland-born David Blackwood, one of Canada's foremost etchers. Blackwood takes the viewer through a step-by-step explanation of the etching process, while the filmmakers present scenes of his outport home and tales from an old mariner about the seal hunts and a way of life that has vanished. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Short Documentary. (V)\n\nBlake\n\n1969 19m prod NFB, p Douglas Jackson, d/ph/ed Bill Mason, mus Blake James, Laurent Coderre; with Blake James. James was an NFB filmmaker who spent his spare time flying solo across the countryside as an expression of personal freedom. Blake, shot by his friend Bill Mason,* is a loving tribute to a time gone by when career pressures could easily be set aside for the pursuit of spiritual values. (V) Awards include: CFA: Short; AAN: Short Drama.\n\nBlinkity Blank\n\n1955 5ml5s prod NFB, p/d/an Norman McLaren, mus Maurice Blackburn. Norman McLaren,* compulsive innovator that he was, put aside his paints to make Blinkity Blank, a work composed entirely of images carved directly on to the film strip. With characteristic panache, McLaren used this rather simplistic methodology to create a remarkable experiment. Brief glints of imagery scrawling and primitive - flash on the screen just long enough to register before morphing into the next shape. In his capable hands, the film becomes an hypnotic, dizzying experience - a perfect expression of his penchant for rhythmic interplay. (V) Awards include: Cannes: Palme d'or for animation.\n\nBluteau, Lothaire\n\nBlood Relatives\n\n1978 101m prod Cinevideo, Classic Films Industries, Filmel (France), exp Julian Melzack, p Denis Heroux, Eugene Lepicier, d Claude Chabrol, sc Sydney Banks, Claude Chabrol, book Ed McBain, ph Jean Rabier, ed Yves Lagnois, mus Pierre Jansen; with Donald Sutherland, Stephane Audran, Micheline Lanctot, Donald Pleasence, Aude Landry. This minor whodunit, one of three films that the French master Claude Chabrol directed in Canada, is based on a book by American detective novelist Ed McBain. Blood Relatives involves the brutal murder of a teenage girl and the subsequent investigation led by Sutherland,* reprising his low-key cop role from Klute. Various suspects come and go, but Chabrol can't seem to get a handle on the material, and the film never really gets out of first gear. However, Chabrol and his regular cinematographer Jean Rabier do manage to create an unsettling mood, effectively using the streets of Old Montreal to create an atmosphere of doom and gloom.

Blue, Ben Actor; b. Benjamin Bernstein, Montreal, 1901; d. 1975. Blue, a superb, sad-faced, rubber-limbed mine and dancer on the New York stage from the age 15, stuck mostly to the stage and nightclub circuit, but his character cameos were the highlight of many features made during the 1930s and 1940s. Later in his career he appeared regularly on television.

Bobet, Jacques Producer; b. Saumur, France, 1919; d. 1996. After a brief stint as a teacher, Bobet joined the NFB in 1947 as a writer, and became a senior producer. As head of the French unit, he oversaw the production of some of the most important films ever made in Canada: Calude Jutra's (and others) La Lutte,* Gilles Groulx's Le Chat dans la sac* and Pierre Perrault's Ile-aux-Coudres triology, Pour la suite du monde* Le Regne du jour* and Les Voitures d'eau* He became a mentor to a whole generation of Quebecois filmmakers, and went on to produce the official film of the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.

Toronto, 1956, son of Lloyd Bochner. Hart Bochner had his screen debut in 1976 in Islands in the Stream. By the time he landed the lead in the 1984 television mini-series The Sun Also Rises, he was labelled a heart-throb. Later, he was cast effectively as the weasel executive in Bruce Willis's megahit, Die Hard. Hart has since become more interested in directing than acting. His first feature, the National Lampoonish PCLT, was followed by High School High.

Bones of the Forest 1995 80m prod Tansparent Film, p Velcrow Ripper, d/ph/ed Heather Frise, Velcrow Ripper, mus Hardkiss, Einsturzende Nuebauten, Jean-Luc Perron, and others. A poetic documentary about the environmental devastation caused by clearcutting in British Columbia, combined with politically correct coverage of the protests against the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas by Europeans. Utilizing a host of cinematic techniques, from time-lapse photography to animation and an evocative soundscape, the film builds a case for the significance of the land to First Nations people and provides a platform for all involved - loggers, native elders, protesters, company flaks - to have their say. Awards include: GA: Feature Documentary. Bons Debarras, Les 1980 114m prod Les Productions Prisma, p Marcia Couelle, Claude Godbout, d Francis Mankiewicz, sc Rejean Ducharme,\n\nph Michel Brault, ed Andre Corriveau, mus Bernard Buisson; with Charlotte Laurier, Marie Tifo, Germain Houde, Louise Marleau, Roger Lebel, Gilbert Sicotte. The late Frank Mankiewicz's* best picture, made during a period when Quebecois filmmakers were fascinated by dysfunctional losers (rather than by today's snappily dressed, gloomy yuppies), is saturated with a deep and satisfying melancholy. Set during a cold, grey autumn in the Laurentian mountains, the movie presents a fallen world seen through the eyes of an obsessive young girl who won't let her mother (Tifo) have a life. This child, created by the reclusive writer Rejean Ducharme, and played by Charlotte Laurier, is a dangerously compelling seductress who wreaks havoc out of a need to control those she loves. Mankiewicz was one of the most emotionally powerful and yet subtle Canadian filmmakers. It's hard to understand why he is also one of the most overlooked. Awards include: GA: Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actress (Tifo), Supporting Actor (Houde), Cinematography, Editing, Overall Sound. Borradaile, Osmond Cinematographer; b. Winnipeg, 1898; d. 1999. After studying at the University of British Columbia, Borradaile went to Hollywood and began work with Jesse Lasky Productions. He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Forces during the First World War, and then returned to Hollywood, where he was hired by Paramont's camera department. In 1930 he left for England where he worked for producer Alexandra Korda. A specialist in exterior photography, Borradaile shot the outdoor sequences for such classics as Elephant Boy, The Four Feathers, and The Thief of Baghdad. He travelled the world and worked in England, Ireland, Australia, and South Africa. In 1951 he shot Royal Journey* for the NFB.

Hobart, Australia, 1953; d. 1995. Borsos, a gifted filmmaker who was once pursued by Marlon Brando to direct a project, started out as a lab technician in Vancouver. He established himself in the late 1970s with formally assured short documentaries (his Nails earned an Academy Award nomination in 1979), and in 1982, emerged as a major talent with his feature debut, The Grey Fox* This dramatic dissection of the Canadian West is an understated, finely nuanced essay on heroism and technology. Its quiet, fatalist poetics were extended in Borsos's four other features, most notably the sprawling, awkward grandeur of Bethune: The Making of a Hero* Cancer claimed Borsos just weeks after the release of Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog. Films include: Cooperage 1976 (CFA-TS); Spartree 1977 (CFA-TS); Nails 1979 (GALAS, AAN-SD); The Grey Fox 1983 (GAD); The Mean Season 1985; One Magic Christmas 1985; Bethune: The Making of a Hero 1990; Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog 1995.\n\nBoys, Les\n\n1997 107m prod Melenny Productions, p Richard Goudreau, d Louis Sa'ia, sc Christian Fournier, ph Sylvain Brault, ed Yvann Thibaudeau, mus Normand Corbeil; with Marc Messier, Remy Girard, Patick Huard, Serge Theriault, Michel\n\n26\n\nBarrette, Paul Houde. A simple story about some Quebecois fellas who get together every Monday night for an amateur game of hockey. Les Boys was released in Quebec to an overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a massive public acclaim unprecedented in the history of Canadian cinema. Clearly, its home-grown sensibility and endless jokes about Quebecois identity struck a collective nerve among the province's moviegoers. There are plenty of crude jokes and slapstick along with a bit of suspense created when the hockey team's coach (Girard*) places a massive bet on the success of his motley crew with a Mafioso who threatens his life. Les Boys evokes the charm and camaraderie themes of such sport films as Slap Shot and The Bad News Bears. (V) Awards include: Golden Reel Award.\n\nBoys and Girls\n\n1983 25m prod Atlantis Films, CBC, p Janice Platt, Michael MacMillan, Seaton McLean, d Don McBrearty, sc Joe Wiesenfield, short story Alice Munro, ph Alar Kiriol, ed Seaton McLean, mus Louis Natak; with Megan Fellows, Ian Heath, Clare Coulter, David Fox. Set in the 1940s, Boys and Girls (which was produced for the CBC-TV anthology series Sons and Daughters) explores the critical period in a young girl's (Fellows) life when she first realizes the implications of traditional sex-role stereotyping. At thirteen, she enjoys helping with the labour on her parents' farm but soon discovers that they consider her only as temporary help until her brother is old enough to take over. An effective, wellproduced short with strong performances that surprised everyone, including the producers, by winning an Academy Award. (V) Awards include: AA: LiveAction Short.\n\nBrault, Michel\n\nBoys u, Les 1998 120m prod Melenny Productions, exp Jeffrey Tinnell, p Richard Goudreau, d Louis Sai'a, sc Rene Brisebois, Frangois Camirand, Louis Sai'a, ph Georges Archambault, ed Maxime Chalifoux, Gaetan Huot, mus Normand Corbeil; with Marc Messier, Remy Girard, Patrick Huard, Serge Theriault, Paul Houde, Luc Guerin. The gang's all here once more. This sequel, released but a year after the success of the original, proved equally popular with Quebec filmgoers. This time the crew heads to France, allowing for a string of gags about cultural differences between the Quebecois and their European counterparts. Again, the film was almost universally dismissed by critics, but in fairness, the crew manages a certain undeniable down-home charm. (V) Awards include: Golden Reel Award.\n\nBoys ofSt Vincent, The\n\n1992 92m prod Les Productions TeleAction, NFB, CBC, exp Claudio Luca, Colin Neale, p Sam Grana, Claudio Luca, d John N. Smith, sc Des Walsh, John N. Smith, Sam Grana, ph Pierre Letarte, ed Werner Nold, mus Neil Smolar; with Henry Czerny, Sebastian Spence, Philip Dinn, Brian Dooley, Greg Thomey, Michael Wade. Originally aired on CBC-TV in two parts and screened as a film abroad, John N. Smith's* dramatization of how the children at a Catholic orphanage in Newfoundland suffered physical and sexual abuse is based on the real-life Mount Cashel orphanage case. The film was intensely controversial and was banned from airing in Ontario for a time during 1992 by the Ontario Court of Appeals on the grounds that the film would prejudice the trial of the Christian Brothers, which was still in progress. The first part deals with the actual abuse at the hands of pedophiliac\n\npriests; the second picks up the story fifteen years later when an inquiry into the events was launched and the victims must face their abusers and the awful past once again. Henry Czerny's* vivid and shocking stand-out performance as a sadistic perpetrator and Smith's effective direction led to subsequent work on Hollywood productions. (V) Brault, Michel Cinematographer, director, and writer; b. Montreal, 1928. Brault, Canada's most gifted and influential cinematographer, has been a seminal figure in Quebec cinema since the 1950s. His early work with Gilles Groulx* (Les Raquetteurs*), Claude Jutra* (A tout prendre* Mon oncle Antoine*) and Pierre Perrault* (Pour la suite du monde*) virtually defines the look of classic Quebec cinema. Brault joined the NFB in 1956 and worked on the Candid Eye* series. In 1960-1 he was in France, where he worked with Jean Rouch and Mario Ruspoli. There he is considered an originator and one of the purist practitioners of cinema-verite. His cinematography ranges from the gritty cinema-verite style of A tout prendre* to the lyricism of Kamouraska* and his directorial work from the terse documentary of La Lutte* to smoothly proficient television dramas such as Les Noces du papier. His masterpiece, Les Ordres* won him the Best Director Award at Cannes in 1975. This film seamlessly fuses documentary and fiction styles while dramatizing the trauma of innocent people caught up in the October Crisis of 1970. Since the mid-1980s Brault has worked mainly in television. His son, Syl"
