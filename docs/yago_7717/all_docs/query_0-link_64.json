        "text": "1LolaWalser\n\nFeb 18, 2020, 2:25 pm\n\nGood old Flick Vault keeps giving: I watched Island of Terror, delighted to add another Peter Cushing film to my acquaintance. @alaudacorax--you were so right about the girl, though. I can't think of another similar character written quite THAT badly. Mucho hysteria! It would have been a relief for the monsters to get her.\n\nAnd then Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and Fiona Lewis in a movie I'd never heard of, Blue Blood (1973). Reed is a demonic butler who gradually takes possession of his aristocratic employer's life, wife and mansion (in reverse order). A schlocky gem.\n\n2LolaWalser\n\nFeb 18, 2020, 2:37 pm\n\nReady for the third installment of Les Compagnons de Baal.\n\n3LolaWalser\n\nFeb 23, 2020, 10:49 am\n\nHorror Hospital is now up on Flick Vault! So pleased I got to see this. Michael Gough in that splendid furry hat. I also absolutely adore how he puts on the mask for daily chores but for bedroom hanky-panky peels it off--no reason to please! Perfectly judged note of lunatic sadism.\n\nAlso seen The beast in the cellar, 1970, worth it for Flora Robson and Beryl Reid. The limp script really lets it down, could have been so much better with a little more effort.\n\n4alaudacorax\n\nMar 13, 2020, 8:04 pm\n\nGetting old is a pain in the backside! Thought I would celebrate Friday the 13th. So I hunted-up The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and Hour of the Wolf DVDs. Had my evening meal, then settled down to watch. Immediately fell asleep! Just woke up and it's midnight here ... time to go to bed, I suppose.\n\n5housefulofpaper\n\nMar 15, 2020, 12:53 pm\n\n>1 LolaWalser:\n\nI must have read about Blue Blood but had forgotten about it. Just looking online today, I see it's based on a novel by the 7th Marquis of Bath, he being the Bohemian one with the \"wifelets\" living in the grounds and murals illustrating the Kama Sutra up the staircase of the Stately Home - the home in question being Longleat House. And that's interesting to me because I've been there. It used to be the home of the \"secondary\" Doctor Who Exhibition in the 70s and 80s. Blackpool Pleasure Beach had the larger exhibition. The Safari Park was a longer-lived attraction, it opened in 1966 and is still going.\n\n>2 LolaWalser:\n\nI have looked at the YouTube trailers for all those French TV series with envy. My French is nowhere near good enough for me to follow the stories without subtitles (I've got the stage where matching pairs in Duolingo isn't thing me any further and I'm going to have to tackle verbs and grammar properly).\n\n6LolaWalser\n\nEditado: Mar 15, 2020, 1:24 pm\n\n>5 housefulofpaper:\n\nWhat a coincidence, I just looked in meaning to tell you I've seen Pete Walker's Frightmare (dear, dear Flick Vault), as I recalled you talking about it. Another GREAT performance by Sheila Keith!--she's now up there with Barbara Steele as a horror queen for me. Excellent movie, as wrong as it somehow seems to call it that given, errr, the theme, shall we say...\n\nI'm not familiar with the 7th Marquis of Bath but it sounds as if I ought to make the acquaintance. Have you seen the Reed/Jacobi movie?\n\n>4 alaudacorax:\n\nAny luck watching since? I expect quite a few of us will be parked home for the duration...\n\n>5 housefulofpaper:\n\nForgot to say, whatever you do, please don't stop listening to the spoken language, you'll surprise yourself eventually. Maybe you could use a list of French horror/ish stuff with subtitles you could use until your ear becomes practiced enough.\n\n7housefulofpaper\n\nMar 15, 2020, 1:36 pm\n\nRecent viewing:\n\nVampira (a.k.a. Old Dracula). This is the David Niven Dracula spoof and its worse than I'd remembered. The central premise is distinctly \"iffy\" - a faulty blood transfusion turns Dracula's wife black, to quote the IMDb summary in full. Jeremy Lloyd's script is full of \"comic\" exchanges and set pieces that die on their arse outside their natural environment of multi-camera sitcom in front of a live audience. There's a lack of focus as to who we're meant to be rooting for - Dracula/Maltravers, Vampira, or the writer (with a vague \"jet setting playboy bestselling author\" character) played by Nicky Henson, who gets tangled up in the Draculas' (sorry, Count and Countess Dracula, I suppose that should be!) plan to reverse the effects of the transfusion. He gets to provide an introductory voiceover as if this is his story - even though it occurs some way into the film - but then it never reappears.\n\nWorst of all, although I don't recall seeing any commentators drawing attention to it, is the way the transfusion effects the character of Vampira (played, after the transfusion, by Teresa Graves who had been in Laugh In). Although it's \"lampshaded\" with a visit to a cinema showing a Blaxsploitation movie, the transfusion apparently affects the Countess by, not just making her speak in Jive, but making her impulsive and sexually promiscuous. One one hand I can see the parallels with the effects of Dracula's bite on Lucy and Mina in the original novel, and the need to introduce a sense of urgency and peril into the plot, but on the other, it does (I can only assume unintentionally) validate (within the world of the story) the worst racist assumptions about the African-American character.\n\nI say unintentional because I read that Jeremy Lloyd knew Theresa Graves from Laugh-In and actively campaigned for her to be given the role.\n\nWhat else can be said? Quite a few familiar faces from 60s/70s British TV appear. Patrick Newell (Mother from The Avengers) does possibly the worst American accent ever committed to film. Freddie James (also doing an American accent) is in a wig that surprisingly makes him look like Martin Freeman. Linda Hayden is in the film (too) briefly and is killed off in a scene that bafflingly chooses to spoof \"The Golden Shot\". Even in 1974, only UK and Netherlander viewers (I think the format came from Netherlands TV)) would have got that.\n\nLike Love at First Bite, there's a scene where Dracula getting the better of a mugger (Blacula did it first, of course). This is after some travelogue-type footage of Niven's Dracula wandering around Soho at it's seediest. Lazy social commentary and a cheap way to pad the running time back then, a fascinating look back in time, now.\n\n8housefulofpaper\n\nMar 15, 2020, 2:05 pm\n\n>6 LolaWalser:\n\nSheila Keith's great, isn't she? I do need to steel myself before going into a Pete Walker film. As I think I wrote before, they are so nihilistic and grotty...\n\nI haven't seen the film but just ordered it from Amazon as part of a triple bill with two other films I have heard of but not seen. The Legacy (it's got Roger Daltrey in it, and scriptwriting credits for Patrick Tilley (whose \"Amtrak Wars\" books I remember seeing in the science fiction section of bookshops around 1980, but never read) and Jimmy Sangster); and Neither the Sea Nor the Sand, which is from a supernatural love story written by newsreader Gordon Honeycombe (the Touchstone might have found the novel rather than the film). For less than a fiver each, (including postage).\n\nI have got quite a lot of stuff - \"arthouse\" and a whole season of Spiral (Engrenages) that I've borrowed and need to return! I do find I have to \"tune out\" the spoken dialogue to read the subtitles, though. I can't seem to manage to follow both at the same time.\n\nOh, I've got the Blu-ray of CÃ©line and Julie Go Boating, too. That (despite the title) apparently has a Henry James (in ghost story mode) influence.\n\n9housefulofpaper\n\nMar 15, 2020, 2:11 pm\n\nOh, and I watched three more episodes of the Jonathan Rhys Meyers Dracula TV series. The Mr Selfridge comparison looks a little unfair now, it's pretty good, so far. It's kept the \"reincarnation of Dracula's lost love\" from the Copolla film though.\n\n10LolaWalser\n\nMar 15, 2020, 2:24 pm\n\n>8 housefulofpaper:\n\nSheila Keith's great, isn't she?\n\nI can't do her justice! It feels crazy to claim so much for such a grotesque role, but there it is--I'd call this one of the legendary character performances. That tarot session when she susses out the doctor's impersonation? I got gooseflesh. Her expressions, her tone, her delivery, that mad gaze from under her eyebrows... pure brilliance.\n\nAnd the others didn't play half bad in support. Rupert Davies was a name, wasn't he?\n\nI hope you like the Rivette, that's one of my all-time faves.\n\nStill no new Drac for me... Don't know if there's any sense in ordering it at this moment...\n\n11Rembetis\n\nMar 15, 2020, 8:31 pm\n\n>8 housefulofpaper: >10 LolaWalser: Sheila Keith is an amazing actress, one of the greatest in horror films. 'Frightmare' is my favourite film of hers. What a performance! Interesting that 'Frightmare' was originally called 'Nightmare Farm' (a better title perhaps).\n\nA fan called Simon Flynn produced a 74 page fanzine covering all her film and tv work about 20 years ago. Flynn also met and interviewed Keith, and included call sheets and Sheila's invites to Pete Walker's previews in the fanzine. She seems to have a delicious sense of humour. When Flynn asked her about 'Frightmare', she said 'That is the one where I chop people up and eat their brains'. She said she loved making the Pete Walker films, that they were 'fun to do'.\n\nRupert Davies was also excellent as the Monsignor in 'Dracula has Risen from the Grave'.\n\n12LolaWalser\n\nMar 16, 2020, 2:16 pm\n\n>11 Rembetis:\n\nThat's wonderful to hear! Too many good actors feel apologetic about acting in such films.\n\nAh yes on Davies--I knew I knew him...\n\nWhat is everyone looking forward to watching over the next indefinite period, if you're housebound?\n\nI'm thinking it's finally time I saw Gormenghast (BBC, 201?), which I had forever... my French fantasy stuff, which I was doling out in small portions so it would last... maybe Twin Peaks again?\n\nAnd of course anything with Veidt over & over again...\n\n13housefulofpaper\n\nMar 16, 2020, 6:52 pm\n\n>12 LolaWalser:\n\nIf I have the opportunity (my employer might be able to contrive it so that I can (and therefore must!) work from home):\n\nI only have four Veidt films, Caligari, Casablanca, The Thief of Baghdad, and The Man Who Laughs. I haven't watched th last two, so they'd have to be on the list. Changing the tone, I've got a box set of the Coffin Joe films, and I haven't seen a single one. Lots of French movies to try to get the music of the language in my ears. Or just work through the pile of DVDs and Blu-rays by the TV as the fancy takes me...\n\nGormenghast has got an incredible cast (especially if you like spotting British actors and comedians). My current Dracula (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) as Steerpike. I remember the actor playing the adult Titus failing to make much of an impact, which is a problem. It all looks brighter and more exotic than one might expect from the book. The production team took a hint from Peake's childhood in China and made a very \"city of pagodas\" Gormenghast. Probably guessing three hours of granite and shadow would be a bit much for a primetime mainstream audience.\n\n14LolaWalser\n\nMar 18, 2020, 11:00 am\n\n>13 housefulofpaper:\n\nHmm, China is an interesting choice for a template, never would have predicted it...\n\nI was thinking which French movies might be easy for a learner, within these genres, and I guess Jean Rollin would be suitable. They are not dialogue-heavy.\n\n15LolaWalser\n\nMar 28, 2020, 11:46 pm\n\nI saw Ringu, the Japanese horror movie from 1997. I had heard it involved teenagers so dismissed it sight unseen as something along the lines of American teenage screamers... but it's actually quite \"classically\" Japanese, harking back to folk legends in theme and design. Very good and so creepy it's the reason I haven't gone to bed yet and clearly never will again.\n\nWhich reminds me--also need to cover all the mirrors. Or maybe I'll just throw them out...\n\n16housefulofpaper\n\nMar 29, 2020, 2:26 pm\n\n>15 LolaWalser:\n\nI was sure I'd told this story already, but I can't find it in these threads. So apologies if it's familiar.\n\nI watched Ringu on a UK DVD release that included some extras in including all the sadako footage edited together in create a version of the cursed videotape. Was I brave enough to watch it? Of course, why not, it's only a movie...\n\nSo I put it on, played it, and then..the video recorder switched itself off. Died. Well, came back to life long enough to disgorge the disc, but that was it.\n\nI was subjecting the recorder to heavy use, it's true. I was busy digitising 20+ years of off-air VHS recordings. I'd no doubt flogged the poor thing to death. But why did it have ti choose that particular thing to expire on?\n\n17LolaWalser\n\nMar 29, 2020, 3:41 pm\n\n>16 housefulofpaper:\n\n*shiverrrrs*\n\nJust count yourself lucky no one phoned you right then... instant heart attack!\n\n18housefulofpaper\n\nMar 29, 2020, 4:58 pm\n\n>17 LolaWalser:\n\nEven without any phone calls, I'll admit to a few uneasy moments over the following week!\n\nRecent viewing.. a bit sparse on the Gothic front. I've been working through the series 2 Monty Python Blu-ray. Disappointingly the picture is softer than series 1. The accompanying booklet explains the production switched from 35mm to 16mm film for location filming.\n\nThere's some oblique Gothic interest in The Avengers: The Cybernauts Trilogy.This is the three cybernaut stories from The Avengers and The New Avengers, beautifully restored and remastered, and with the option of playing with contemporary UK television commercials in the ad breaks. The 1960s stories guest star Michael Gough and, in the sequel, Peter Cushing. The stories draw on Mad Scientist tropes which I think have roots in the Gothic but are their own thing by the 1960s. Of the two, I found the first one more interesting - you can see it drawing on contemporary ideas and concerns (industrial espionage and fears of Japan's rising power in the technology sector drive the plot, and there's thematically-linked red herring around a martial arts school).\n\nThe third story is from the '70s and the not so well regarded sequel The New Avengers. This one has some genuinely Gothic elements - the villain is disabled, disfigured, and driven by revenge (yes, that would be handled differently today), and expresses his mood by wearing one of three grotesque masks. Dating from 1976, I suppose it was too tempting not to extend the cybernetic idea to a riff on bionics and The Six Million Dollar Man. The denouement does descend into farce, and online is universally hated, but I wonder if this was a deliberate undermining of a would-be nietzschean superman. The revised cybernaut design is interesting, played by stuntman Rocky Taylor (according to one online resource) with a loose-limbed stagger that reminded me, just bit, of Christopher Lee's Frankenstein Monster (and a face a bit like the crude make-up job on Kiwi Kingston's monster in The Evil of Frankenstein)\n\n19housefulofpaper\n\nMar 29, 2020, 5:55 pm\n\nI watched The Uncanny (1977 or 1978) today. Let's see if I can be a bit more concise with this!\n\nIt's a horror anthology co-produced by Milton Subotsky after Amicus productions was dissolved. It's a UK/ Canadian production. Part of it's filmed in the UK and part in Canada (Quebec). Similarly there's a mix of British (Ray Milland was born in Wales!) and Canadian actors. The screenplay is credited to Michel Parry, a name I associate more with the editorship of 1970's paperback anthologies - I assume it's the same person. There are three stories and a frame story in which Peter Cushing is an author trying to convince publisher Ray Milland that cats are evil and secretly running things. The stories stick to the EC comics model. The final story, which stars Donald Pleasance as, surprisingly, a randy actor in '30s Hollywood, is Bram Stoker's \"The Squaw\" retold.\n\nThe film has a fairly poor critical reputation, but I suspect that's more due to its coming at the end of a cycle than any intrinsic faults. Don't get me wrong, although it's not a bad film, I wouldn't want to overpraise it. My honest appraisal is that it's no better than okay. I will say that, like the Amicus productions, the film benefits from it the quality of its cast.\n\n20LolaWalser\n\nMar 29, 2020, 6:14 pm\n\n>19 housefulofpaper:\n\nSeen that; enjoyed it (it's been a while, it used to be on YT), thought it was funny, and let's face it, cats WOULD eat us.\n\n>18 housefulofpaper:\n\nSeen that (well, not your fancy edition, SIGH, but the DVD); huge fan of the Avengers and I do like The New Avengers too, Purdy is to die for.\n\nI love the Cybernaut stories. In fact I think you've just pushed me to do a Steed/Mrs Peel marathon in these horrid hibernating times (was contemplating Buffy, but The Avengers would be better as I only went through the lot once before).\n\nSpeaking of, once upon a better time, a lady on YT with fab access to archive Brit TV (I owe her the introduction to loads of series) had up on her channel a 1960s--maybe 70s? series with a vibe VERY much like the more sci-fi-ish Avengers tales--Strange Things or Stranger Things (not to be confused with the recent American)--and it had one of Doctor Who assistants in it, I think the girl who played Polly. The swinging-sixties kitten.\n\nCan't recall the title--it was interesting. Shot in colour. Wish I could see it again now that I'm better acquainted with the usual suspect actors...\n\n22LolaWalser\n\nMar 29, 2020, 6:36 pm\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME...! :D\n\nThis is Ringu-level uncanny\n\n23LolaWalser\n\nMar 29, 2020, 6:38 pm\n\nomg I should think next of of of of of of arghh nothing comes to mind!\n\nWell that's me set for the evening... ta so much!\n\nOff to brew some tea...\n\n24alaudacorax\n\nMar 30, 2020, 4:26 am\n\n>20 LolaWalser:, >21 housefulofpaper:\n\nThis group regularly surprises me with 'sixties, 'seventies telly series which I would have thought right up my street but of which I have absolutely no memory. Don't know what I was doing rather than watching telly, but I really wish I'd kept a journal.\n\nThat lady now has seven subscribers ...\n\n25Rembetis\n\nMar 30, 2020, 8:01 am\n\n'Strange Report' is charming and great fun (love the theme music too). Network produced a dvd set of it about a decade ago with a ton of extras, and I devoured it in a few sittings!\n\nMy partner and I are both in the 'vulnerable' category (underlying illnesses) so staying inside as much as possible for the next 3+ months, only venturing out infrequently to buy food and get medicine (fortunately the shops are only 3 minutes walk away, and they are practicing social distancing inside and in the queue outside). My mum is quite ill on the other side of London, but we are keeping in touch by video on whatsapp.\n\nI realise I am so lucky to have a garden at this time. I am keeping busy gardening, tackling thick books (currently 'No Name' by Wilkie Collins), and digging out stuff I haven't watched for ages. Yesterday's double bill was a VHS of John Waters' 'Desperate Living' and Ted Post's 'The Baby'!\n\nHope you all keep safe.\n\n26LolaWalser\n\nMar 30, 2020, 4:50 pm\n\n>24 alaudacorax:\n\nNot to kvetch about the gift horse's teeth, but I'll just note that the much lamented \"CoachB's Wife\" or however her handle went, uploaded content in high resolution, was a real pleasure to watch. Sigh. Actually, it seems YT deliberately downgrades quality on some stuff, so maybe it's not the uploader's fault...\n\n>25 Rembetis:\n\nYes, do take every precaution! A garden sounds fantastic. Luckily my mum has one too, or she'd go batty with my grandma for sole company for months. Meanwhile I'm stuck here in the New World, helplessly monitoring family and friends in Italy--as it happens, everyone is concentrated in the worst-hit regions. Amazingly, no fatalities so far--only two fell sick at all! (so far).\n\n27Rembetis\n\nMar 30, 2020, 8:41 pm\n\n>26 LolaWalser: The news from Italy has been heart breaking. I hope all your friends and family in Italy come through this safe and well.\n\n29LolaWalser\n\nMar 31, 2020, 12:07 pm\n\nThanks gents & same to you... Sadly it's not just the disease we have to worry about, but the all-encompassing depression that set on life--I was just notified of a third death (not virus related) of an old family friend who'll be buried only with one or two other people present and this is killing my oldsters mentally... I keep repeating to them that the dead will wait for our goodbyes, but of course the funerals are, normally, also where the surviving reconnect.\n\nOK, back to the relative summery cheer of gruesome movies... I took in Dario Argento's The Cat o'-nine-tails, with the usual unpleasant mix of Italian and foreign actors: Catherine Spaak, the likeable Karl Malden, Horst Frank (a very good German actor with a great voice, not that it's in use here), and as the lead some pretty boy whose name escapes me... The story is standard serial killer and let down by the resolution that goes for the villain being someone we barely saw. There's a pretty cool car chase in the middle, though, showcasing more of Torino than people get to see on screen usually, as Italian locations go...\n\n30alaudacorax\n\nMar 31, 2020, 5:32 pm\n\nMade myself quite depressed, a little earlier, thinking about the batch of gawd-awful films about the currrent situation that will be made a year or two down the road.\n\n31alaudacorax\n\nAbr 1, 2020, 1:42 am\n\n\"Hey! I got a great idea. Totally ill-assorted couple trapped indoors by covid-19. Gradually fall in love.\"\n\n\"Nah--there's five of 'em in the works, already. Let's put 'em in a weird, Gothic mansion ... and there's a menacing, unseen entity in there with them ...\"\n\n\"Um ... that's been done ... many times ...\"\n\n\"Shaddup--it'll be a smash!\"\n\n32alaudacorax\n\nAbr 1, 2020, 1:43 am\n\nSorry. Going stir-crazy, here. Better go for my daily walk ...\n\n33housefulofpaper\n\nAbr 1, 2020, 7:31 pm\n\n>29 LolaWalser:\n\nThat must be tough on them. My thoughts are with them, and you.\n\nI've discovered the room I set up as a home office is too cold, this time of year. i made myself ill yesterday. I've retreated to the back of the house and I'm using an ironing board as a table. Classy.\n\nI've got quite a lot of Argento to work through. I really am not going to be so insensitive as to complain about working on full pay through this crisis, but the DVD pile is no more going to reduce than the TBR pile of books. \"Unpleasant mix of Italian and foreign actors\", though...is that akin to what movie writers used to call a \"Euro-pudding\" (think multi-national financing, European locations, Hollywood not-quite or no-longer A-listers in lead roles, dubbed voices)? I had started to come round to the idea that \"Euro-pudding\" was a condescending Anglo-American slur I needed to grow out of. Horror Express, after all!\n\nSpeaking of Karl Malden, there's a film on Vimeo by Guy Maddin called The Green Fog which recreates Vertigo using shots from other movies filmed in San Francisco. Karl Malden is there courtesy of some footage from The Streets of San Francisco and I think, at least one other film. Vertigo is solidly Gothic - it was featured in the BFI's film season at any rate - and San Francisco seems to me to have a Gothic feel to it, if only through the lens of particular works of art (Fritz Leiber's late stories, Wim Wenders' Hammett, maybe.\n\nIt's small and scruffy but I'm grateful for my patch of garden too. Still too chilly to spend much time in it but I saw a magpie a couple of days ago, and some wood pigeons (they moved from the country to the town 10 or more years ago). Crows too. No one can say they aren't Gothic!\n\n34alaudacorax\n\nAbr 2, 2020, 5:07 am\n\n>33 housefulofpaper:\n\nYou've just got me wondering how the feral pigeons are getting on in town. Stop moving in the memorial gardens, especially while carrying a paper bag, and you could find yourself surrounded by a couple of hundred of them. Shades of the Pigeons from Hell thread for those a bit bird-phobic, I suppose. I wonder if people are still feeding them.

Pigeons--they are ALL from hell...\n\n>33 housefulofpaper:\n\nMaddin's experiments always sound interesting to me but I confess I only manage to see through every other or so...\n\n\"Euro-pudding\" (think multi-national financing, European locations, Hollywood not-quite or no-longer A-listers in lead roles, dubbed voices)?\n\nThat's it, although it's practically always an Euro-American \"pudding\". It's usually the soundtracks that are the worst blemishes, at least to finicky people or those who may know the actors from other stuff... Weirdly, while the underlying reasons for such co-productions must have been above all financial, there also seems to have been a feeling that they had a cachet of their own. Which might make sense in the case of really big names in \"important\" movies (e.g. Anthony Quinn in La strada), but not really for most of this fare. Even stranger, dubbing the soundtrack was the usual thing to do in Italy even in the case of all-native cast (one of these days... years... I need to find out about the circumstances of this practice, what was it all about...)\n\nI think I may have mentioned this before--Fellini, for instance, casually planned to have Claudia Cardinale's gorgeous husky voice dubbed in 8 1/2 because it wasn't considered \"pretty\"--she was getting dubbed all the time!--then changed his mind. The audiences finally got to hear her and from then on she was allowed to keep her voice (except, of course, when dubbed in other European countries.)\n\nIt always amazes me that good film directors could treat sound so indifferently, as if it didn't matter.\n\nOh, before I forget, there's another interesting new channel on YT, Cult Cinema Classics. I caught their excellent copy of Curtis Harrington's Queen of Blood, 1965--it's sci-fi AND vampires--truly sometimes the gift to the schlock-lover overfloweth.\n\nNote that the beautiful sequences of the planets, moons, interplanetary flight etc.--everything that doesn't involve the actors--are ripped from Soviet science fiction movies bought expressly for that use. (Roger Corman in particular is famous for exploiting these sources.)\n\nIf vampires in space isn't attractive enough, there's also Basil Rathbone and a very young and still innocent Dennis Hopper!\n\n37housefulofpaper\n\nAbr 2, 2020, 5:18 pm\n\n>35 pgmcc:\n\nTruthfully, it isn't. In fact, I tried to give that room a feeling of airy rationality.

I'd seen a comment that, shorn of the dubious-if-not-spurious real-life connections, it's a decent ghost story. I don't know, so far, in the way it tells the story it just feels like a typical TV movie of the era.\n\nBy coincidence I have just finished listening to an audio adaptation of Blood of Satan's Claw. I've had it for a while but been put off by the decision to move the action to the north of England. The location of the film version looked like scenery I recognised as \"countryside\" and years later I realised it (not the scenes on Hammer's beloved Black Park) is only 10 miles or so due north of the house where I grew up. So the move left me feeling a little disenfranchised, but I got over it. (Also, what I thought was a farmhouse next to a field, when I was a child and looking north from the family home, is clearly just a big house on the Warren (on the other side of the Thames) and its garden!).\n\n50LolaWalser\n\nEditado: Abr 12, 2020, 12:49 am\n\nI didn't stick with the chat as the upload was in poor resolution and it felt silly with the DVD practically next to me. Switched to the much better Cult Cinema Classics channel and watched Gog, 1954, (wheee! Touchstone!), a tale of caution about AI gone power-hungry we should all take to heart.\n\nThree notable things: one, the senior scientist is played by Herbert Marshall, who played the lead in Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise, and generally had an actor's career when he (in my acidulous opinion) has one of the least actorly countenances ever--and a dead, wooden voice and a leaden delivery--but there you have it, he's in one of the gems of pre-code cinema... two, the leading lady is played by Constance Dowling, a minor actress you have probably never heard of BUT I have known OF since I was fifteen in a heart-shaking context because she was the woman who drove Cesare Pavese to suicidal despair.\n\nPoor Pavese, who did a lot of translating from English and probably served as the interpreter for someone at the film set, met her when she was doing a job in Italy and fell madly in love. It's unclear that she ever returned his feelings, in fact it seems she regarded him as a huge nuisance.\n\nLove. What a load of bollocks and twaddle, you think as you watch Gog and Magog, mechanical robots with six arms, chasing metallically blonde Constance with breasts shaped into pyramids by a 1950s bra across the papier-mÃ¢chÃ© sets.\n\nOops, forgot the third thing: unusually for sci-fi of any era, there's more than one woman doing sciency things! Woman radio-operator, woman chemist, Constance the scientist, woman scientist who gets killed at the start--quite remarkable profusion.\n\n51alaudacorax\n\nAbr 12, 2020, 2:19 am\n\n>50 LolaWalser:\n\nHah! Just looked up Marshall on IMDb. Face was familiar but that was it, memory was otherwise blank. Thought he looked like an accountant. Read the bio ... yep, he trained as a chartered accountant.\n\n52alaudacorax\n\nEditado: Abr 12, 2020, 2:26 am\n\n>51 alaudacorax:\n\nDisclaimer: not in any way intended to be accountantist (just in case a particular niece is reading ...)\n\n53alaudacorax\n\nAbr 12, 2020, 2:29 am\n\n>50 LolaWalser: - Oops, forgot the third thing: unusually for sci-fi of any era, there's more than one woman doing sciency things!

According to IMDb, they got a few other things right, too.\n\n54LolaWalser\n\nEditado: Abr 12, 2020, 11:36 am\n\n>51 alaudacorax:\n\nI did not know that but not in the least surprised! (Also no diss meant to honest-to-god accountants...)\n\n>53 alaudacorax:\n\nSomebody had the right idea of \"futuristic\" for once.\n\nThe channel (Cult Cinema Classics) is a treasure. I got roped into watching the 1938 Flash Gordon serial but lasted only 6 episodes (each is about 20-25 minutes; there are... 15?) before needing to go to bed. Ming the Merciless! Azura the Queen of Magic! The wonderful Claymen (some really nice old-time SFX there.) One could get a wicked drinking game going by counting Dale's fainting fits. I'd be out by ep 3...\n\n55alaudacorax\n\nAbr 12, 2020, 4:47 pm\n\n>50 LolaWalser: et al.\n\nWatched Gog this evening. I'm pretty sure I've never seen it before or heard of it before this thread. Interesting, and sort of fun.\n\nThe first half was very wordy, though; it took a long time to get going. Some of the special effects were ropey to the point of being amusing. For example, a repeated shot of some sort of aerial being elevated--there was clearly someone behind a big rock poking the thing up into the air. I actually thought Constance Dowling looked a bit sinister in quite a lot of shots (which was not at all appropriate for her character).\n\nIt may have been coincidence, but I felt Gog and Magog just a little foreshadowed the Daleks.\n\n56LolaWalser\n\nAbr 12, 2020, 6:28 pm\n\n>55 alaudacorax:\n\nYeah, she has the vibe of a hardboiled gangsta moll more than anything... something about the eyes + the sharp cheekbones...\n\n57alaudacorax\n\nAbr 13, 2020, 12:52 pm\n\nI really must get my own copy of Carry On Screaming--sat down with a meal and it was on telly about twenty minutes in.

Not revising my initial impressions although the cast are all good. Better than the dialogue they're given, that's for sure. Interesting tension going on in the Blu-ray's bonus features. A commentary by the parapsychologist who wrote the book Amityville II was based on(!) - i.e. not Jay Anson but Hans Holzer says the source is psychic energy in the ground latching onto a \"sensitive\" in the house. He also increasingly turns into a kind of querulous older relative through the course of the film: \"This didn't happen. Why make it up. The truth i dramatic enough\" \"The real George Lutz didn't look like {James Brolin}\" \"What's he doing? He's stealing the book? From a library? Why would you show that in a movie\". etc. Then there's an hour-long documentary (I think it's an hour - my new Blu-ray player doesn't have a timer. Annoying!) about one of the Lutz children. Grown up now of course. He blames his step-father's dabbling into the occult for releasing evil into the house and their family. He and other relatives in the documentary are (I don't know the right word - devout catches part of it, but they believe in the efficacy of Holy Relics, for example) Catholics. Holzer, on the other hand, denies the existence of Heaven and Hell but does believe the personality can survive the physical body.\n\nAnd here's the other interesting thing. The house is built on the site of a Native American burial ground. As far as I can remember that's NOT the case with The Shining (the Overlook Hotel's decor merely suggests it, allows an inference). It's not true for Poltergeist (that was a modern cemetery, but admittedly it was \"retconned\" in the sequels). The trope apparently starts with The Amityville Horror.\n\nOh and one last thing. The actor playing Father Delaney's (Rod Steiger's) superior, who rubbishes the suggestion of anything supernatural going on, and blocking any Spiritual aid (is that the right term) to the beleaguered Luz family, is Murray Hamilton. That is, the mayor in Jaws (and Jaws 2 - he got re-elected!). I can't decide if that's clever casting or lazy casting.\n\nOkay that's off my chest. On with the Ina treasure trove!\n\n68alaudacorax\n\nAbr 16, 2020, 3:40 am\n\n>61 LolaWalser: et al.\n\nAh, why worry?

Far out!\n\n>67 housefulofpaper:\n\nI've never seen that, but if it's along the lines of The Exorcist, I'm interested.\n\nIncidentally, wasn't that the haunting of the Borley presbytery (or whatever it's called in English) you discussed a while back?! If so, it looks as if the French covered the story too, parking this for reference:\n\nhttps://madelen.ina.fr/programme/qui-hantait-le-presbytere-de-borley\n\nIt's part of a series, Le Tribunal de l'impossible--apparently the episodes were followed up on with debates where various individuals debated whether the phenomena were real etc.\n\nhttps://madelen.ina.fr/collection/tribunal-de-limpossible\n\n72housefulofpaper\n\nAbr 19, 2020, 8:33 pm\n\n>71 LolaWalser:\n\nYes, Borley Rectory.\n\nI haven't watched the French documentary. My grasp of the language isn't sufficient to even read the notice about subscribing. It feels as if I can imagine what it would be like, from the tone and style of contemporary British TV documentaries (and, demonstrating it was an international style, the fake documentary Jan Svankmajer made about The Castle of Otranto. Here it is:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xieu4S76Jt0\n\nI've just added a couple of VHS tapes to my other account - blank tapes that I filled with stuff recorded \"off the telly\", -\n\nbecause they include things I couldn't copy to DVD, or buy. It seems at least one channel was broadcasting stuff with a copy protect signal that let you record it once.\n\nAnyway, I found that these programmes are on YouTube now:\n\nTomorrow Calling, an adaptation of William Gibson's short story \"The Gernsback Continuum\" (\"Just think of it as Ray-Gun Gothic\", says a character at one point, perhaps justifying my mentioning it here). I should give a warning that there's some nudity at the start.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh5QHtGmXn4\n\nOld Father Christmas, a mini-opera with overtones of Harrison Birtwistle, Jan Svankmajer (again!), and Folk Horror.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWIIfNLphbw\n\nBoth programmes had UK terrestrial broadcasts in or around December 1994. The tapes are still looking pretty good (blank tapes hold up better than pre-recorded tapes I understand, and the analogue TV picture you were recording was usually pretty good.\n\n73LolaWalser\n\nAbr 20, 2020, 10:01 am\n\n>72 housefulofpaper:\n\nThe French movie is a dramatisation, not a documentary. Now that I watched it, I would only mildly recommend it to the aficionados of that particular legend--I suspect it's too humorous to be enjoyable to someone looking for a horror thrill. (Always funny to see how the French play the English, and vice versa.)\n\nThanks very much for the links to Tomorrow Calling and Old Father Christmas (the Svankmajer I had seen before)! I must say Tomorrow Calling hits close to home--I avoid thinking deeply about what this... nostalgia for yesterday's dreams, shall we say, implies for the state of our (my) psyches. Or life's hopes.\n\nIt's hard to imagine any future generations looking back to our nightmares for inspiration... only warnings.\n\nThat Father Christmas is more pagan than Christian. There's a note there I perceive as specifically Germanic horror (the Slavic versions of the figure and the stories are cheerful, pastoral, harmonious).\n\n74LolaWalser\n\nAbr 20, 2020, 10:05 am\n\nNot the greatest resolution (360p) but as I remember, this is not easy to find, so...\n\nThe Face Behind the Mask (noir-horror 1941) Peter Lorre\n\n75alaudacorax\n\nAbr 29, 2020, 5:28 pm\n\nI've been watching The Haunting of M. R. James--not the dramatisation with Mark Gatiss as James, but a 2019 documentary with Chris Halston and Ursula Bielski (it doesn't have a touchstone or an IMDb page I can link to--I found it on Amazon Prime).\n\nIn this new period documentary, we take a fresh look at the unrivalled master of the modern ghost story, M.R.James and his life and beliefs. Did he believe in the paranormal? Shot entirely on location, the show explores the life of M.R.James from his early days in Suffolk to his life as a Cambridge academic and later Provost of Eton. A historical journey presented by Ursula Bielski and Chris Halton\n\nThe premise is that James, influenced by his life-long interest in pre-Reformation, English catholic literature, was a believer in the supernatural and, indeed, had experience of it, but, because of his academic status, felt he had to keep these things to himself and, thus, let it come out in his fiction. It's rather long on conjecture and short on hard facts, also rather heavy-handed with the creepy background music. There is some fascinating stuff in there, though, and it's well worth a watch.\n\n76LolaWalser\n\nmayo 1, 2020, 12:28 pm\n\nI'm not sure what boundaries can be traced between religious belief and the belief in the supernatural...\n\nI watched again The City of the Dead, always a pleasure, and The Curse of the Crimson Altar for the first time. The DVD came from an outfit self-deprecatingly named Cheezy Flicks and the image quality isn't great, but tolerable. The best thing about the latter is no doubt the combo of Christopher Lee and Boris Karloff, just the fact of them together on a set. Plus Michael Gough, in some scenes. I was grinning like a fool.\n\nKarloff to the hero (velvety tones): \"I have a rather amusing collection you might be interested in seeing\" -Oh, really, what do you collect?- (so suavely) \"Instruments of torture.\"\n\nAlso saw, courtesy of Kanopy, a strange movie from 1963 called Blood Feast. Hand on heart, what did I expect?--nothing--what did I get?--well quite a surprise, in some regards. The terrible acting and flimsy plot were more or less what one might expect. But the gore for one was unexpected, in a movie of that vintage, and the thing did have ideas behind it, someone's stamp. Visually it's quite arresting. Some lovely sixties interiors and props, pastel colours & brilliant fake blood. There's unintended and intended humour. The former mostly derives from several truly terrible actors (the boyfriend of one of the victims, the cops, the main girl) but the latter is very much in the script, like the would-be sacrifice to Ishtar performed on the kitchen counter. I thought of Kenneth Anger, of Ed Wood, of Roger Corman, of John Waters. Whoever is inclined to enjoy them might want to check this out.\n\n77housefulofpaper\n\nEditado: mayo 2, 2020, 12:47 pm\n\nI wish The Curse of the Crimson Altar was a better film.\n\nIt also seems to have a production history that is still quite murky. Those of us \"in the know\" recognise Lovecraft's \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" as contributing some elements to the story. But the story seems to want to be an \"explained supernatural\"/ Les Diaboliques or Psycho type of suspense thriller, of the kind that Jimmy Sangster was turning out for Hammer in the early sixties - apart from the final twist (or cop out) of seeing Lavinia at the end. Plus it flirts with the groovy sixties scene but loses heart or nerve and concentrates on a cast of middle-aged, middle-class men in tweeds.(I know, \"but what a cast\" -but, still).\n\nLovecraft gets no mention in the credits of course. The script is by Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln who had contributed three scripts for Doctor Who (creating the character of the Brigadier in one of them). Henry Lincoln had a sideline in the '70s with BBC documentaries about the mysteries of Rennes-le-Chateau (until the BBC broadcast a further documentary debunking the whole thing) and co-writing The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail and sequels from the '80s. That script is from a story by Jerry Sohl, a name I recognised as one of the group ghost-writing scripts for Charles Beaumont when he succumbed to some form of early-onset dementia (I first learned about this from The Twilight Zone Companion before I'd ever seen an episode).\n\nIt looks as if a treatment had been put together in Hollywood, but somehow the property came into the hands of Tony Tenser (that is, Tigon Productions) and the two British screenwriters set to work on it. Did anyone working on the film even know the Lovecraft connection, I wonder?\n\nActually the production history is evidently even more complicated. Tenser is credited as Executive Producer. The producer is Louis M. \"Deke\" Heyward, American International Picture's man in England. AIP had made a couple of loose Lovecraft adaptations and would make The Dunwich Horror in 1970. Mystery solved? No, there's a credited associate producer. Gerry Levy has credits on low budget British films, including some other Tigon pictures, and later credits (production/unit manager) in the '80s and '90s on big films such as Gandhi and Octopussy. An interviewee in the DVD extras of my copy says he brought the property to Tony Tenser, at which point it had the title \"Redemption\".\n\nAnd now I can't find it but I am sure I read a long interview with Roger Corman's production designer and director of The Dunwich Horror, Daniel Haller, which along the way discusses a script based on \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" being prepared by AIP in the '60s, to be shot in the States. All very confusing and none of it addressed in the DVD extras (the commentary is merely an excuse for David Del Valle to interview Barbara Steele at length).\n\nSadly the interviewees in the filmed extras are all sure that the cold and damp filming conditions hastened Karloff's death.\n\nThe blurb on the DVD box knows its audience: \"This adaptation from Lovecraft's 'Dream in the Witch House' was shot in Grim's Dyke, the allegedly haunted home of W S Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame. It is remarkable for being the only time that Lee, Karloff and Steele appeared in the same film and is also the last British film to star Karloff, which was innovatively filmed by John Coquillon.\"\n\n78alaudacorax\n\nEditado: mayo 2, 2020, 2:41 am\n\nThis is going to be a very vague post ... apologies.\n\nJust nipped over to IMDb to check a title for another thread, and found IMDb currently pushing this: Lovecraft Country, based on a novel--Lovecraft Country--I've never heard of, either. Looked at the synopsis of the TV and a few reviews of the book ... and don't really know what to think of either ... but I thought I'd mention them, if only for the title.\n\n79alaudacorax\n\nmayo 2, 2020, 3:48 am\n\nOn Curse of the Crimson Altar:\n\nI'm sure I've posted previously, and not too long ago, on a similar film--when I run searches on CotCA itself nothing is coming up, but I've hunted through the last three iterations of this thread without finding the post.\n\nMy post was to the effect that there seems to be a number of films with the same premise: a chap goes to a mysterious house, last-known location of a missing brother, finds possible bad guy and niece living there, falls in love with niece, and so on. Possibly the odd TV horror series episode, too. I remember seeing this film, but I also have memories of different faces in some of the roles.\n\n80LolaWalser\n\nmayo 2, 2020, 12:26 pm\n\n>79 alaudacorax:\n\nThat outline does seem familiar in general.

Steele's role is practically a cameo. I think they had something with the \"dream\" sequences that could have turned even Jarmanesque, in better hands, with better props more imaginatively used. I suppose Tigon blew their money on paying the stars.\n\n81drneutron\n\nmayo 2, 2020, 7:50 pm\n\n>78 alaudacorax: Iâve read Lovecraft Country and enjoyed.

It was visually quite interesting--sort of fun (and I was amused by the sheer volume of pipe smoke floating about). I don't think it told me anything I didn't know, though. An overwhelming amount of extras on the disc--I gave up after an hour or so--perhaps tomorrow ...\n\n83housefulofpaper\n\nmayo 5, 2020, 6:30 pm\n\n>82 alaudacorax:\n\nThat's something I find about extra features on disc - they make the disc more attractive (before I buy it), more justifiable as vague for money, even as a piece of scholarship that deserves to be supported, but then the 2x feature commentaries or the stills gallery, or examples of the director's student films can be a real slog...\n\n84housefulofpaper\n\nmayo 5, 2020, 6:53 pm\n\nI looked back over the previous Gothic films threads, it seems to have been a while since Curtis Harrington's name has come up.\n\nI wrote a few sentences about Night Tide when I bought it on DVD. I don't recall exactly what I said. I think I came away with the feeling it was sort of half-way between the avant garde and the mainstream and fell between the two stools, somewhat. I do remember being pulled by the quality of the film image, in some scenes it looked to have been shot on video.\n\nThis was I would guess the result of what was, 10 or so years ago, a heroic restoration attempt on very badly deteriorated film elements. Because a new 4k restoration has been made using a film negative apparently suffering very badly from vinegar syndrome, shrunk from a spool to a \"rough hexagon\" and only surviving long enough for a digital scan to be made by sone sort of cinematic miracle. Even so, some scenes had to be patched with a print made (from the same negative ) in 2007 - the source of my DVD version I presume. The Blu-ray (yes, I bought the Blu-ray!) is packaged with a booklet and a second disc of Harrington's short \"experimental\" films. This starts with his version of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" made at age 14, the short films from the '40s shown as \"experimental\" films before labels such as \"underground\" or \"alternative\" cinema existed, the film he made about Marjorie Cameron and her paintings (widow of Jack Parsons, Crowleyite, the mysterious woman in black in Night Tide), an about synthetic fibres in industry which he contrives as a visual essay about alchemy, and his last film, a remake of his first film, in which he again plays both Roderick and Madeleine Usher.\n\nThe extras on the Night Tide disc are - contrary to my comments in >83 housefulofpaper: - both extensive and genuinely illuminating....\n\n85housefulofpaper\n\nEditado: mayo 5, 2020, 7:33 pm\n\n...>84 housefulofpaper:\n\nthe most substantial being a 25-minute feature based on an interview with Harrington (I've seen this footage also appearing on YouTube) from around the time he made his last film (which would be 2002) and 2 episodes of a 1980s cable TV show with David Del Valle interviewing Harrington about his film career. There are 2 commentary tracks (one with Harrington and Dennis Hopper - which is also on the DVD).\n\nI was better-disposed to Night Tide watching it again, perhaps because all the supporting material helped contextualise it..and Curtis Harrington comes across as a genuinely nice man too, that certainly made me want to like his work.\n\n86LolaWalser\n\nmayo 5, 2020, 7:40 pm\n\nit seems to have been a while since Curtis Harrington's name has come up.\n\nBrought up in >36 LolaWalser:--it would be nice if there were a way to index titles and names (I suppose touchstoning works a little in that regard, but getting to posts instead of threads takes a bit of bending backward...)\n\nHarrington's short \"experimental\" films.\n\nThis would be my reason for getting that, along with the extras.

There are long speeches which the actors rattled though - clearly they didn't want to be in any way stereotypically \"theatrical\" but it made for some dull and often inaudible performances. Macbeth came alive during the fight scenes. It made me think, unkindly no doubt, that as Macbeth he would have made a good Glaswegian mobster in an episode of Taggart (oh, and he wiggled his toes all through his long speeches, you could see them moving in his boots.

Before the opening credits, there a 'white hunter' type, complete with white bush suite and pith helmet, being rowed in a canoe by two African-looking gentlemen. So far, so good; but you never saw such English-looking countryside! Might well have been the Norfolk Broads. Clearly not in the tropics. And then they showed a Green Monkey and Saddle-billed Stork, from Africa ... and a Blue and Gold Macaw from South America. I watched another ten minutes or so, particularly as there was a carriage ride and I was waiting to see if that track alongside a lake--so familiar from so many British horrors--turned up; but my mood was shattered and I gave up.

Black Narcissus is a Powell/Pressburger film I have yet to watch (the DVD is buried deep in a box of similarly unveiled discs).\n\nI looked at her Wikipedia entry, and a few of her works were adapted for children's television, which must be where I first heard the name. And the title of her novel (which was filmed) In This House of Brede had stuck in my head without my knowing what it was about (cloistered nuns). Like the submarine drama Gray Lady Down, it just sounded mysterious and possibly science-fictional!\n\nBut she wrote the original children's book that this very dark children's animation from 1984 was based on. When we started a thread about Gothic on film or television, this came to mind first.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottie:_The_Story_of_a_Doll%27s_House\n\n99housefulofpaper\n\nmayo 21, 2020, 6:48 pm\n\nIn a \"Dracula\" mood at the moment, as you must have noticed :) - so watched the 1968 television version with Denholm Elliott in the lead role again. Surprisingly there's what I think is the full version on YouTube. Evidently it was shown on cable with an Elvira style \"Horror Host\" in the '80s.\n\nIt makes some interesting choices, some of them very probably dictated by the size of the budget, so it follows the stage play in limiting the action to a couple of locations. As with nearly all adaptations there's interest in seeing what has been kept, what left out, what has been emphasised, what isn't from the novel and is it from previous screen versions or is it new?\n\nFrom a British television aspect, scenes and staging here didn't so much reoccur in later versions - the Louis Jourdan version for example - as seem to be echoed in comedy/light entertainment spoofs that I grew up with in the '70s/'80s (Light Entertainment had big budgets back then) - as if the people working with Dave Allen or Kenny Everett had this template to refer back to. Some of it, admittedly, was just cheap swing-a-bat-on-a-fishing-line stuff!\n\nIt's very clear that the Count is supposed to be a sexy hand grenade thrown into the middle of a repressed Victorian bourgeois set-up (not family exactly but the streamlined Lucy - her mother - Dr Seward & Mina - Jonathan (who is essentially Renfield here) & Van Helsing grouping(s). I have to go along with the majority of critical opinion that Elliott, splendid actor though he was, isn't convincing on that score.\n\nThere's a scene by the way, where Van Helsing tries to convince Seward of the reality of vampires with - I was going to write \"photocopies! - copies of some kind of various woodcuts etc. from old books of various cultures. It's the scene from Quatermass and the Pit where Quatermass and Barbara Judd (I think, rather than Roney) find the references to \"imps and demons\" going back centuries. Four years before the Doctor Who story \"The Daemons\" recycled it again!\n\n100frahealee\n\nEditado: Jun 21, 2022, 8:24 pm\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n101frahealee\n\nEditado: Jun 21, 2022, 8:24 pm\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n102alaudacorax\n\nmayo 23, 2020, 3:58 pm\n\n>101 frahealee:\n\nSomehow, I can't imagine Gemma Arterton as a nun.

I watched it on here (it came up as a playlist of six parts--better than the version with \"Misty Brew\"s interpolated commentary!):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JMU7mXPOQgE\n\nThere's a lot to like here, from the players to the design and the music. Yes, Elliott doesn't quite work for me either, a little too... ordinary, chatty-sounding in places? It's common to think the face is the most important, but I believe it's the voice that makes or breaks a Dracula. He needed to invent a different voice, something more than just the accent. I can't remember now what I'm flashing to but I know he has it in himself to play a terrific chilling villain, a real demonic force. Maybe he's too young here. There's some hint of the direction in which I think he should have gone full throttle, when he's ranting about the \"Ugrics\" and berserkers and whatnot--that's what it should have been, something madder.\n\nLucy and Mina were good, and Van Helsing seemed scarier than Dracula! Seward was OK, Corin Redgrave too (it's funny to me how his sisters look more like their father than he does...)\n\nAll in all, a very accomplished version by top professionals all around.\n\nOh yes.

Witness testimony etc. is played out in little staged vignettes (with some interesting faces under the stuck-on Victorian whiskers: Christopher Benjamin, Kenneth Colley, Morris Perry, a young Alan Ford in a scene with Norman Shelley (Dr Watson on BBC radio in the '60s), etc.). Brings in the Royal (Prince Eddy) cover up theory in the last episode. BEFORE the Stephen Knight book, I found out from Wikipedia.\n\nNothing But the Night - the only film produced by Christopher Lee's production company, Charlemagne films. He's in it and so's Peter Cushing but their neither antagonists nor do they have much screen time together, so on that score it feels like a missed opportunity. For about three minutes new the end it looked like the real missed opportunity was Cushing and Georgia Brown as at team. Interesting but also typically '70s cast, if you know what I mean - a big part for Diana Dors, Keith Barron (although I have to confess to not being a fan - there's something about him that just drains the energy from a scene), Fulton Mackay, Morris Perry pops up again, and a small role for John Robinson, aka the emergency Quatermass in Quatermass II (the TV serial) cast after Reginald Tate's death.\n\nJohn Blackburn, the The author of the original novel is getting some critical attention. I read a recent essay that discussed the novel and the ways the film diverges from it - to the film's detriment, in the author's judgement. I knew the film had a lukewarm write up in things like English Gothic so maybe my expectations were lowered but I enjoyed it (admittedly this is coming from someone who now watches 50-year old films to go \"look, that's Morris Perry!\")\n\n112housefulsfilmtv\n\nJun 12, 2020, 7:51 pm\n\nRewatched House of Wax and Mystery of the Wax Museum.

Yes the Fellini segment (a loose interpretation of \"Never Bet the Devil your Head\") is by far the best, but I have to confess to finding Roger Vadim's take on \"Metzengerstein\" more entertaining than Louis Malle's version of \"William Wilson\" (also, I grew up watching The Goodies so if I see an obvious dummy thrown from a stall building I can't help but expect a jump cut after it lands so Tim Brooke-Taylor can pick himself off the floor!).\n\n114housefulsfilmtv\n\nJun 12, 2020, 8:08 pm\n\nOh yes, Richard Stanley's new version of H.

I couldn't help noticing some borrowings from other films to flesh out the effects of the \"color\" - it makes it more of a haunted house movie for the \"middle act\" - especially (perhaps I mean \"specifically\") the first Poltergeist film.\n\n115LolaWalser\n\nEditado: Jun 12, 2020, 8:16 pm\n\n>112 housefulsfilmtv:\n\nI don't remember much about the Price version except how very intensely coloured it is.

It's often described as an unofficial sequel to the Lugosi/Browning Dracula made by a rival studio (Columbia). I had assumed it would pick up after the events of Dracula with some name changes. Actually the first quarter of the film tells an admittedly Dracula-like story before moving the story forward (from a WWI setting to WWII) and a German air raid uncovering the vampire and permitting his accidental resurrection.\n\nThis looks a bit more sumptious, in terms of production design, than the Universal horror films being made around the same time. It's not a big-budget picture by any means but the sets - what looks like a country churchyard (though I think it's supposed to be in London), a bombed-out church - are more detailed.\n\nSome interesting differences in approach too. Universal had developed a mythology which had become pretty pervasive but the script goes in a different direction here. Armand Tesla (the Lugosi character) became a vampire because he was obsessed with them (and the occult generally) in life. His Renfield-type servant is a werewolf because lycanthropy is the physical expression of the evil in his nature.\n\nThere's also a strong female character in Lady Jane Ainsley, played by Frieda Inescort (middle-aged too, in as required, really, by the 20+ year time period of the story). In a way she's a Mina Harker substitute (with her \"Man's brain\" (!), to quote van Helsing (in the novel). But unfortunately (infuriatingly) she gets sidelined (worse than that, metaphorically has her feet swept from under her by the most annoying, Blimpish character in the film) before the climax.\n\n118alaudacorax\n\nJun 22, 2020, 5:26 am\n\n>117 housefulofpaper:\n\nI'd intended to post on that; must have completely forgotten.

I thought his blinkered thick-headedness rather overdone and I was a little jarred by his breaking the fourth wall.

Haven't been in a horror film mood or a Ken Russell mood ...\n\n126alaudacorax\n\nJul 10, 2020, 8:12 am\n\n>125 alaudacorax: - ... I've had Count Dracula and Gothic lying around here for weeks ...\n\nGods, what am I thinking! I've sat down to Count Dracula twice and failed to get more than twenty or thirty minutes in. My impression is that it's a bloody lousy film, but it's so well-rated online that I can't bring myself to give up on it and move on. It's probably just my looming insanity that, having started with that one, I can't bring myself to watch Gothic till I'm done with it.\n\n127LolaWalser\n\nJul 10, 2020, 1:36 pm\n\nI didn't know of that Cushing flick either. *updates wishlist*\n\nWell, the Flick Vault regaled me again (sadly many movies are now geolocked), with--ta daaa!--a Christopher Lee movie I'd never even heard before, the 1994 Funny Man--ouch! what terrible ratings, I guess there's no point in linking.\n\nI, however, enjoyed it, which apparently means I'm a terrible person of no taste, but you knew that already, so...\n\nGo in with low expectations, oddity-adjusted spectacles and yer funny hat on, ye who follow in my footsteps, and mayhap you'll grin at various little things as I did.\n\n128housefulofpaper\n\nJul 10, 2020, 3:37 pm\n\n>124 benbrainard8:\n\nJohn Landis has said in interviews that he wrote the script for An American Werewolf in London as far back as 1969 but no studios would make it until the success of Animal House. It was those wrong-footing changes of tone that the executive were wary of. My guess is that fans of Landis' generation were already attuned to that sort of thing by growing up watching old horror movies with \"horror hosts\" on TV, reading Forrest J. Ackerman's pun-laden Famous Monsters of Filmland, even seeing Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein as a precursor (if you're young enough to treat the Dracula/ mad scientist and Wolf Man subplots as straight dramas, and get emotionally invested in them).\n\n>125 alaudacorax:\n\nAn American Werewolf in Paris is nowhere near as good. I've recorded it from the Horror Channel which I think equates to paying about 40p for it. Feels about right.\n\nI put Count Dracula on this afternoon to see if I agreed with you. Making allowances for a 1977 BBC budget (inflation would have been whittling it away by the day) I thought it was pretty good. Admittedly mixing film and video can have the unfortunate effect of making each format look bad by comparison with the other. I'd wondered if Louis Jordan's Dracula suffered by being too much like Roger Delgado's Master (from Doctor Who) - 6 years after that character debuted on TV. But watching back he isn't like that, he isn't being superficially charming at all. From the outset he's just very sure of himself. I did spot that some changes were made to make the Westernra household more middle class and there were some early scenes obviously telling us how stifling that world could be. I think playing into the Freudian theories that Lucy partly welcomed Dracula's attack. Oh, and I just realised the casting of Frank Finlay and Susan Penhaligon a year after Bouquet of Barbed Wire would add a frisson to their scenes together.\n\n129benbrainard8\n\nEditado: Jul 12, 2020, 11:36 am\n\nI think that John Landis should also get credit for his contribution to the movie Twilight Zone: The Movie. And apparently he will be remaking An American Werewolf in London, that was as of year 2019, but its not been release yet to my knowledge.\n\nFor me personally, the movies that take from different genres and keep you off balance can be excellent movies. Thank you for the background, I didn't know that he'd had the script for such a long period of time before he could make it.\n\n130alaudacorax\n\nEditado: Jul 13, 2020, 3:41 am\n\n>128 housefulofpaper:\n\nI've rarely, if ever, found myself so at odds with IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and the world in general (I so often find, mildly discomfortingly, that IMDb's starring of something exactly matches the one I've logged-on to give---so I suppose I should be pleased). I again tried and failed to watch Count Dracula last night.\n\n... there were some early scenes obviously telling us how stifling that world could be.\n\nI honestly think it was just plain bad acting. The Westenra family, especially Mina and 'Mummy', sounded like non-actors self-consciously reading aloud. I took against Mina from the very opening scene where she was meant to be tearfully taking leave of her lover but actually looked as if she was wishing herself well out of there. She didn't get much better (and I found it quite distracting that she was so painfully thin). I've rarely seen anything so excruciatingly, embarrassingly bad as the Westenra's dinner party with the 'stage-American' Quincy. I did wonder if he was meant as parodying or satirising Stoker's often-derided portrayal of an American. In fact, it several times crossed my mind that the whole production was some kind of parody on Stoker (it did seem to be trying to be as faithful as possible to the book---just when I'd accepted that films don't need to be).\n\nLouis Jourdan seemed in a different film. I can't fault his acting, and I'm willing to blame the director for his giving such a subdued, low-key Dracula. I wasn't really getting anything of the predator or monster off him. At what I imagine was meant as his most menacing, he looked a bit cheesed-off. The scene with him calling off the three vampire ladies was extremely bathetic. What i saw of him came across like the villain in some French domestic drama.\n\nIt was almost the worst of the film that supporting actors gave such good performances. When Jonathan escaped from his women and was on his coach ride to the Borgo Pass, I really believed in the other passengers and the film seemed to be getting into a 'best of Hammer' mode. Didn't last. Renfield, again, seemed in a different film---quite believable. And George Malpas going at it full-blooded as the ancient mariner again evoked Hammer territory.\n\nWhen Frank Finlay turned up with his 'funny foreigner' accent I started thinking of skits in old comedy shows; and discovering for the first time that there was were two-and-a-half hours of it I turned off in terminal exasperation. Life is way too short and precious to be wasted on it. You know that when you start clicking the remote control to see how long is left of a film. It's abysmal and I'm giving up.\n\nSorry for such a long post*, but at least I got through it without foul language (it was a struggle, believe me).\n\nETA - * I could write another five hundred words if you like---I don't feel I've fully vented yet. Just thank the gods I didn't watch all of it.\n\nAnother ETA - When a film has you thinking about Ed Wood, well ...\n\n131LolaWalser\n\nJul 13, 2020, 10:13 am\n\nAck! Well, we all have such instances... being the \"only\" (it's really never just the one) hater of something widely liked or appreciated etc. (Have you seen me rip into the X-Files? No fan loves them as much as I hate them!)\n\nAnyhoooo... now I wonder, by way of contrary-day philosophy, what might happen should I push you gently in the direction of Funny Man... :)\n\n132alaudacorax\n\nJul 14, 2020, 5:50 am\n\n>131 LolaWalser:\n\nOo!

But for my part, I still hit the Blu-Ray obstacle... whyyy do they do this, aren't we DVD-watchers people too... :(\n\nEverything is deteriorating for us vintage-movie lovers who buy DVDs. Warners, TCM etc. not only don't issue their archive on anything but DVD-R anymore, they have cut off all the nifty extras they used to include--short films, cartoons, commentaries...\n\n137alaudacorax\n\nJul 26, 2020, 6:20 pm\n\nJust mentioned over the in the folk horror thread that I re-watched The Blood on Satan's Claw this evening.\n\nI find it difficult, sometimes, to say why I enjoy one film and not another. I noticed this one seemed to take a very broad-brush approach to plot---it seemed suggested or implied rather than written---yet, at the same time, I was glued to the screen right through.\n\nOne thing that struck me was that I've seldom seen rural countryside so solidly portrayed. The tracks looked a foot deep in mud; footpaths were overgrown to the point of being non-existent; and you felt it was only the inadequacy of candle-light that stopped you seeing how dirty interiors were. It quite compensated for the over-proliferation of Roger Daltrey perms.\n\n138housefulofpaper\n\nJul 28, 2020, 6:31 pm\n\n>137 alaudacorax:\n\nThe episodic way the story's told is apparently because this was going to be made like an Amicus portmanteau film until quite late in the day. So, what began as three or four separate stories had to be linked together somehow, and the main actors had only been contracted for a relatively small number of days.\n\nBoth of those are reasons for major characters dropping out of the narrative for half an hour or so, and new characters being introduced halfway through.\n\nYou could analyse the story cold-bloodedly I think, and say that it is trading on anachronistic, very turn of the '60s/'70's concerns - anti-authoriarianism, the clash between the generations, and trying to have its cake and eat it by setting up Patrick Wymark's character as the hero but also try to suggest he's not to be trusted and the victory at the end is an ambiguous one.\n\nIt doesn't matter though, it's powerful and entertaining enough, and through some alchemy of casting and cinematography and what have you real enough, for it not to matter.\n\nFor a film of very nearly the same period, and trying to deal with similar themes, but getting it badly wrong, have a look at the vincent Price film The Cry of the Banshee. The best thing about it is Terry Gilliam's title sequence.\n\n139alaudacorax\n\nJul 29, 2020, 5:23 am\n\n>138 housefulofpaper:\n\nHuh---I'm confused again. I said over in the folk horror thread that I hadn't seen Witchfinder General in a 'long, long time' but that I vaguely remembered it as unpleasant and gave that as why I'd never re-watched. Now, looking at the IMDb page, I'm suspecting that, all these years, I've been confusing it with The Cry of the Banshee and now I don't know where I am. I'm going to have to watch both to get my head straight.\n\nSo, what began as three or four separate stories had to be linked together somehow ...\n\nAh ... that explains the vagueness of plot I wrote about. Well, partially, anyway. If they had to weld together disparate chunks of film, they probably had to avoid too much dotting and crossing.\n\n140alaudacorax\n\nJul 29, 2020, 5:30 am\n\n>139 alaudacorax:\n\nParadox ... a lot of the film's grip (on me, at least) possibly comes from the viewer constantly not knowing what's going on ...\n\n141housefulofpaper\n\nJul 29, 2020, 6:15 am\n\n>140 alaudacorax:\n\nI think it works in its favour. And it gives the lie to all the theorising about the \"right way\" to construct a screenplay.\n\nThere's a recent audio version that works hard to iron out the lumpy bits of storytelling and so forth. Somehow telling the story in a \"better\" way, in conventional terms, made it less gripping.\n\n142alaudacorax\n\nAgo 3, 2020, 10:25 pm\n\n>133 LWMusic:\n\nI watched The Black Cat tonight. I'm pretty sure I'd never before seen it, and I really can't think why.\n\nOkay, there were quite a few flaws, especially in the plot---definitely not the greatest film I've seen, but even as I was thinking that I was quite engrossed. It was such a pleasure watching Lugosi and Karloff.\n\nI've rarely seen such a distracting film, though.\n\nFirst of all I got distracted trying to put names to the great, bleeding chunks of classical music throughout the soundtrack.\n\nThen I was quite derailed trying to figure out exactly where and when and why the young couple got married. They were hungry because they hadn't eaten much at the wedding lunch, so they couldn't have come far. I mean, obviously not across the '34 Atlantic between lunch and dinner, surely? So what was their story? Had they eloped? Had they just met---whirlwind romance, sort of thing?\n\nAnd now I'm falling asleep ...\n\n143alaudacorax\n\nAgo 4, 2020, 6:09 am\n\n>142 alaudacorax:\n\nForgot to mention the haircuts! Karloff's and Harry Cording's hairstyles were just plain weird. Had to rewind a couple of times because I was missing bits because I was lost in hairstyle bemusement.\n\n144alaudacorax\n\nEditado: Ago 4, 2020, 6:14 am\n\n>142 alaudacorax:\n\n... and as far as I could work out poor Joan didn't get any grub for at least twenty-four thirty-six hours ...\n\n145LolaWalser\n\nAgo 4, 2020, 9:54 pm\n\nI can't figure out if somebody had posted about this before; apologies if it's a repeat... A 15-minute long silent Italian adaptation of a Poe story, \"Il caso Valdemar\", from 1936. You know the plot, a dying/dead man is hypnotised and on release liquefies on the spot. You can find many copies on YouTube but I'm linking the top resolution copy on Cineteca Milano's website (accessible via a Google or Facebook account, or with a free registration):\n\nhttps://www.cinetecamilano.it/biblioteca/catalogo/record/1580\n\nThe end is remarkably gruesome.\n\n146housefulofpaper\n\nAgo 6, 2020, 7:00 pm\n\n>145 LolaWalser:\n\nI couldn't log on to the Cineteca Milano website so I watched the film on YouTube. Remarkably gruesome is right! It could have been from one of Lucio Fulci's maggot-dripping Zombie films of the '70s.\n\n147LolaWalser\n\nAgo 7, 2020, 10:30 am\n\n>146 housefulofpaper:\n\nOh no--sorry you had trouble with the link, that's disheartening to hear. I'm glad you saw it nevertheless (and if I'd known the CM would be a hurdle I'd have linked to YT myself.)\n\nYes, I wasn't sure if it's just me, or the special effects were really something. The actors were very well cast, I thought, the dying man really looked cadaverous and the hypnotist menacing. The shadows in the claustrophobic setting, the low ceiling, the close-ups all contributed to a sense of unease, of being squeezed and smothered by dread. And the decomposition... mind you, this is all before plastics, whatever was going on looked... organic.\n\n148LucasColeman\n\nAgo 7, 2020, 10:39 am\n\nEste usuario ha sido eliminado por spam.\n\n149alaudacorax\n\nAgo 7, 2020, 10:53 am\n\n>148 LucasColeman:\n\nI'd quite forgotten that a gravestone with RIP on my homepage signified a removed spammer.

But the weather has changed and I have watched Wolfen for the first time. I was vaguely aware of it when it was released in 1981 (I used to, when I had pocket money to spare, buy Starburst magazine, which was pretty much the UK's version of Starlog). It got marked down for lacking the spectacular transformation effects of An American Werewolf in London and The Howling and for stylistically being rather more late '70s than early '80s.\n\nIt's based on a Whitley Streiber novel and, if I'm honest, it feels like quite a pulpish plot...or rather a '70s/'80s paperback original plot, with just a bit too much would-be profundity added to it by the director (and screenwriter). A bit of social commentary, ecological concerns, mysticism focused on Native Americans. That last is actually key to the story as the Wolfen are shape-shifters who have gone to ground as predators in modern White society.\n\nBut the New York location filming (contrasting uptown Manhattan with lots in the Bronx bulldozed and dynamited to mimicry of tells in the Middle East, and awaiting redevelopment. There's lots of Steadicam and solarisation (or is it thermal-imaging?) of the picture to provide a Wolfens-eye perspective.\n\nIt looks very handsome (as most films do when buffed up for Blu-ray and shown in the correct aspect ratio).\n\n152housefulofpaper\n\nEditado: Ago 28, 2020, 7:11 pm\n\nSpotting books in Amicus films that almost certainly belonged to Milton Subotsky...in And Now the Screaming Starts, there's a scene where Stephanie Beacham is reading Comus. I reckon that particular book really is \"Milton's Comus\": it's the Heritage Press edition (not dated but a quick squint at Google hits gives publication dates in the '50s and/or '60s. The film is early '70s.)\n\nEdit: - here's the screenshot I promised earlier.\n\n153housefulofpaper\n\nEditado: Sep 12, 2020, 1:42 pm\n\nMy recently viewing has more-or-less by accident had a theme running through it: Old Dark House, isolated cast, sexual violence and/or murder. Gothic themes, but not of the films are obviously Gothic.\n\nAnd Now the Screaming Starts. I first saw this late at night on a black & white portable television at some time in the late '80s. I can see that all the themes are pretty well-worn (and would have been in the early '70s) but it was probably the first time I'd seen them put together in a film and Found it pretty strong stuff: the flashback to the evil ancestor exercising his droit de seigneur, the ghost's bloodily mutilated eyes and hand, the Stephanie Beacham character's potential allies bumped off before they can be of any use, even Amicus' motorised crawling hand prop. Filmed in one of those houses on the Thames near to Hammer's Bray studios.\n\nThree films by Joseph Larraz. Although he was a Spanish director, Larraz was influenced by his friend the Belgian Weird writer Thomas Owen (a pseudonym) and worked in the UK in the '70s and in the US for his final couple of films (he returned to Spain after the death of Franco). Owen seems to share in that rather doom-laden Belgian sensibility and Larraz latched onto it, creating doomy autumnal psychodramas with (for the time) surprising levels of sex and violence.\n\nWhirlpool - a model goes to a remote house in the English countryside to mode for a creepy young photographer and an older woman (possibly she's his aunt); and gets caught up in sex games and more dangerous obsessional behaviour. Larraz's dialogue is painfully stilted and overly correct, which adds an alienating/absurdist edge to things.\n\nVampyres - the 1974 lesbian sexy vampire film. I wrote about this ages ago, it's come out on Blu-ray now. Sadly the commentary track from the DVD hasn't been ported over (this is an unintentionally hilarious comedy duo of unflappably proper English producer and excitedly voluble Spanish director. Apparently and rather incredibly, there's a commentary track out there somewhere, with Harry Alan Towers and Jess Franco doing the exact same thing). Watching it again I could see the thematic links with Whirlpool (and with the - rather classier - Symptoms that starred Angela Pleasance). I still think the story I construed from my first viewing makes more sense than Larraz's own explication (again this is only on the old DVD and not the Blu-ray). Briefly, the girls were murdered decades ago. Ted the travelling salesman is just unlucky to look look like the murderer (only an old man thinks he looks familiar). But Lisa Faulkner is his reincarnation (all unknowing of course) but Fran recognises her, says they've been waiting for her and marks her forehead his her thumb (something Larraz says the nuns used to do in school to freak out the kids!); and why her murder has the most intensity (and is the most unpleasant) of all the deaths in the film. And the vampyres seem to have disappeared at the end of the film: they've had their revenge.\n\nDeadly Manor - a late entry into the slasher genre, filmed in New York State. Larraz managed to find an old dark house in the woods here, too. This is tamed down quite a bit from his '70s films but some familar themes are still playing out.\n\nAnd Then There Were None - this is the 2016 TV version scripted by Sarah Phelps who got some grief for the changes to the next three adaptations (especially the character of Poirot or, rather, backstory in The ABC Murders). This is very bleak and I was surprised to learn that Phelps didn't have to do very much to the source material to make this \"grim dark\" version. Disparate characters summoned to a house on a remote island and killed one by one for their alleged crimes, of course. Detective fiction grow out of the original Gothic by way of Poe and the \"sensation\" novels of the mid-Victorian period, plus there's a big isolated house, so I think it merits a mention here.\n\nOh yes, and Killer's Moon, the notorious late '70s horror (with dialogue by Fay Weldon!) where a coach load of schoolgirls and four dangerous escapees from a mental hospital collide, mainly in an out of season hotel in the Lake District (another Old Dark House, you see). The escapees have been undergoing some sort of dream therapy dosed up on hallucinogenics and believe the rapes, murders, and animal mutilations they carry out are not just \"only a dream\" but actively sanctioned by their therapists - acting out their repressed urges. Cue three-legged dog, tail-less cat (don't worry, they both started the film as amputees), ripped-off nightgowns and the rest. I'd read about it so was expecting something headspinningly crass and zero-budget. I don't think I had been warned about the attempts to evoke A Midsummer Night's Dream - from the \"madmen\"'s (this is SO not a PC film) cod-shakespearian lines to scenes in the woods with one of the madmen decoyed by the hero as if he was one of the lovers and the hero were Puck (the heroes, by the way, are awful. The lead is an American actor (for overseas sales) who'd been in Star Wars, but he was only the Stormtrooper who gets hypnotised by Obi-Wan).\n\n154benbrainard8\n\nEditado: Sep 13, 2020, 3:01 pm\n\nThat's the same vibe I got from reading excerpt from Whitley Streiber's, The Hunger, bit of of pulpish plot and wording, which took away from the story. Unfortunately, won't drop the money on that type of read, library checkout only.\n\nHaven't seen or read Wolfen, one of these nights I'll stream it.\n\nAm streaming on Netflix rather creepy French Netflix show Zone Blanche, called \"Black Spot\" in English: https://www.imdb.com"
