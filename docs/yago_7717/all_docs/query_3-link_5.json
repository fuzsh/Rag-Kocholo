        "text": "Denis Heroux, the Canadian film producer whose credits included the Oscar-nominated Atlantic City and the Mask cartoon series, died Thursday night in Montreal. He was 75.\n\nVeteran distributor Christian Larouche of Christal Films, whose wife, Caroline Heroux, is the goddaughter of Denis Heroux, announced the death on his Twitter account. “We have lost a man who made world cinema. You were great. Thanks Denis Heroux. Rest in peace,” Larouche said in a tweet.\n\nHeroux, who was born in Montreal in 1940, started out as a film director in the 1960s before turning to producing in the late 1970s. He earned an Oscar nomination for producing Louis Malle’s Atlantic City, the 1980 U.S.-Canada romantic crime drama that starred Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon and picked up five Academy Award noms.\n\nAtlantic City didn’t win an Oscar, but did earn the Golden Lion in Venice in 1980, sharing the prize with John Cassavetes‘ Gloria. Heroux’s producing credits also included Jean-Jacques Annaud’s Quest for Fire (1982)."
