        "text": "Just a few short months after BD’s Ryan Larson raved about the 2004 horror movie Skinned Deep, we’ve learned this morning that Severin Films is bringing it to Blu-ray this summer!\n\nSeverin details their July lineup today, “On July 20th, Severin Films is providing comfort from the sweltering summer heat with high-definition disc debuts of Gabe Bartalos’ SKINNED DEEP, Denis Héroux’s BORN FOR HELL, and Paul Donovan & Maura O’Connell’s SIEGE.”\n\nHere’s the full rundown…\n\nSKINNED DEEP: His mind-blowing work as an FX artist has included everything from Frank Henenlotter’s BRAIN DAMAGE and FRANKENHOOKER to Matthew Barney’s CREMASTER CYCLE. And for his 2004 debut as writer/producer/director, Gabe Bartalos created this “demented gift from the B-Movie Gods” (Bloody Good Horror) about a rural clan of psychotic freaks, the killing spree “that takes us places and shows us things we’ve never seen before” (Dread Central) and the final girl that may be their depraved undoing. Warwick Davis (LEPRECHAUN) and Jason Dugre (SAINT BERNARD) star – with an appearance by fandom legend Forrest J. Ackerman – in this “brutal, bloody forgotten masterpiece” (Morbidly Beautiful) featuring music by Captain Sensible of The Damned, now scanned uncut in 2K from the original negative for the first time ever.\n\nSpecial Features for Skinned Deep:\n\nDEEP CUTS – A look back on SKINNED DEEP with Writer/Producer/Director Gabe Bartalos, Actors Jay Dugre and Karoline Brandt and Weapons Machinist Jake Lee\n\nAudio Commentary With Cast & Crew\n\nArchival ‘Making Of’ Featurette\n\nTrailer\n\n“SKINNED DEEP is also available in a limited edition of 2000 from the Severin webstore, which includes a Bonus CD of the first ever release of the Original Soundtrack by David Davidson, with additional tracks by Jonathan Bepler & The Damned’s Captain Sensible.”\n\nBORN FOR HELL: In 1976, Montreal filmmaker Denis Héroux – future director of THE UNCANNY and Oscar®-nominated producer of ATLANTIC CITY – adapted the true story of Chicago mass murderer Richard Speck to war-torn Belfast, where a disturbed Vietnam vet drifter (Mathieu Carrière of MALPERTUIS and BILITIS fame) brutalizes a dorm full of student nurses. Re-edited by its video distributor and released as NAKED MASSACRE, Héroux’s harrowing director’s cut has remained unseen in America until now. Debra Berger (THE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS), Leonora Fani (GIALLO IN VENICE), Christine Boisson (EMMANUELLE), Ely Galleani (BABA YAGA) and Carole Laure (SWEET MOVIE) co-star in this “uncompromising and unfathomably grim work of art” (Video Basement), scanned in 2K from an uncut 35mm print discovered in The National Archives of Canada.\n\nSpecial Features for Born For Hell:\n\nThe Other Side of the Mirror – Interview with Actor Mathieu Carriere\n\nNightmare In Chicago – Remembering the Richard Speck Crime Spree with Local Filmmakers John McNaughton and Gary Sherman\n\nA New Kind Of Crime – The Richard Speck Story with Once Upon A Crime Podcaster Esther Ludlow\n\nBombing Here, Shooting There – Video Essay by Filmmaker Chris O’Neill\n\nArtist Joe Coleman On Speck\n\nNAKED MASSACRE – U.S. Video Release Cut\n\nSIEGE: From co-directors Paul Donovan and Maura O’Connell (DEFCON-4) comes one of the most disturbing – and rarely-seen – Canadian shockers of the ‘80s, inspired by the actual 42-day Halifax police strike: When a local group of right-wing vigilantes massacres the patrons of a gay bar, the sole survivor seeks refuge in a nearby apartment building whose residents must now defend themselves in a night of hate, terror and bloodshed. Doug Lennox (BREAKING POINT), Tom Nardini (CAT BALLOU), Jack Blum (HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME) and Keith Knight (MY BLOODY VALENTINE) star in this “dark and intense thriller, still uncomfortably relevant 35 years after it was made” (Blog Of Horror) – released in the U.S. as SELF DEFENSE – scanned in 2K from the original negative recently discovered in a Nova Scotia archive.\n\nSpecial Features for Siege:\n\nTwo cuts of the movie – Theatrical: 84 mins / Extended: 93 mins\n\nTrailer\n\nCheck out Severin’s July 2021 trailer below, along with Blu-ray art for each upcoming release."
