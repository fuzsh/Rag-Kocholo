        "text": "Raul Meza has been charged in two recent murders and may be connected to ten more.\n\nRaul Meza Jr., who was convicted in 1982 of the murder of an 8-year-old girl, was charged with two additional murders Tuesday. Police say he might be responsible for as many as 10 more homicides and described him as a serial killer.\n\nThe two recent murder charges against Meza are for the deaths of Gloria Lofton and Jesse Fraga. Lofton was found dead in her home in May 2019 and Fraga in his home on May 20.\n\nMeza has an extensive criminal history dating back to 1975. He has spent nearly 20 years in prison for various crimes, ranging from a curfew violation to homicide.\n\nBreaking: Austin police may have missed key DNA lead to stop suspected serial killer Raul Meza Jr.\n\nHere's what we know about Meza's background:\n\nWho is Raul Meza Jr.?\n\nMeza is most known for the murder of 8-year-old Kendra Page in 1982 in Austin. At the time, police determined Page had been strangled and sexually assaulted, according to American-Statesman archives from 1993. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison but was released after 11 years because the time he served plus the time he accrued for good behavior equaled his original sentence.\n\nAt the time, Meza's early release triggered public condemnation, but it was mandated by a state law that has since changed.\n\nMeza's first recorded crime came in 1975 when he was 15 years old. During a robbery of a South Congress Avenue convenience store on New Year's Eve, Meza shot Derly Ramirez, the store attendant, the Statesman reported in 1991. Ramirez survived, and Meza was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1976. However, he was released on parole in 1981, a year before Page's murder.\n\nPolice: Raul Meza charged in two deaths, may be involved in 10 more\n\nGloria Lofton found dead in East Austin home\n\nLofton was found dead in her East Austin home in mid-2019. At the time, police thought the 66-year-old's death was suspicious, but no one was charged.\n\nPolice announced Tuesday that Meza confessed to her murder and that his DNA matched the DNA found at the scene. It's unclear whether the two had any prior connection.\n\nLofton was known to her neighbors as a private but exceptionally kind woman. They said she valued helping others and often invited people off the street to stay with her. They also noted her mental and physical health was starting to deteriorate.\n\nJesse Fraga found dead, knew Meza since 1990s\n\nFraga, 80, was found dead in his Pflugerville home May 20. Meza and Fraga had known each other since the 1990s.\n\nFraga was a retired Travis County probation officer. After Meza's release from prison, Fraga tried to support him, the Statesman reported. The two had also lived together for two years until May 12.\n\nMore: Raul Meza, who killed girl in 1982, sought in slaying of 80-year-old man in Pflugerville\n\nIs Meza connected to the Lady Bird Lake deaths?\n\nPolice have said investigators do not believe Meza is responsible for the two bodies found in Lady Bird Lake in recent weeks.\n\nPolice: No foul play in Rainey Street entertainment district deaths\n\nTimeline of Meza's crimes, convictions and releases"
