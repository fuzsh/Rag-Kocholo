        "text": "\"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris,\" the American Film Theater's second presentation of the season, has less importance as a movie than it has as a public service for those people who somehow managed not to see the Off Broadway stage show during its nearly five-year run at the Village Gate.Maybe not. Maybe the people who did not see the original show chose not to. In that case they may now choose not to see this very fancified film version, which opened at selected theaters here yesterday and will be given two more performances today.The movie, directed by a young French-Canadian named Denis Heroux, tries very hard to recreate the sense of intimacy and spontaneity of the plotless show, which is actually 26 Brel songs performed by Elly Stone, Mort Shuman, Joe Masiell, a chorus and by Mr. Brel himself, who makes a fine and much too brief appearance in the film to sing one song.Mr. Heroux, with the obvious cooperation of Eric Blau and Mort Shuman, who conceived the original show and wrote the English translations of Mr. Brel's French lyrics, has transformed what was essentially a concert into an extravaganza of surreal images that keep messing things up. The images are vivid and disconnected to one another (good) but they inevitably wind up being visual translations of the lyrics (bad). It's a rather classy variation on the format employed by the old \"Hit Parade\" television show, though it's seldom as witty.I should admit that I've never been a Brel maniac. Some of his songs are most engaging, (\"Timid Frieda,\" \"The Taxi Cab,\" \"Amsterdam\" and \"Carousel\"), and some make one long for the lyrics of Rod McKuen as comic relief. Mr. Brel is something else as a performer, which is apparent here when he comes on after intermission to sing his own \"Ne Me Quittes Pas.\"The song is not great, but the performance is—deadpan and pseudo-world-weary in the cabaret tradition of chansonniers, and Mr. Brel was one of the best until he decided officially to retire from performing to devote his full time to composing. Which was too bad.Other people take Mr. Brel's songs too seriously. Or, to put it another way, they lack that touch of redeeming ham that can sometimes make charming and even moving a truly rotten lyric about love or death or war or some other little flea in mankind's ear.Mr. Brel, you see, is inclined to write about rather large subjects, and the movie treats them so portentously it doesn't hesitate to give us a crucifixion scene. The song is \"Sons of . . .\" in which Miss Stone mocks Jesus for the world's ills, seriously, I think.Furthermore, the camera isn't always kind to the performers with the exception of Mr. Shuman, a burly, comic man with a fine voice and an aggressive way of singing that turns criticism into nitpicking. Miss Stone, a small, Giulietta Masina-type with a voice big enough to stop a clock at 300 yards, and Joe Masiell, who might be described as the romantic lead, are continually being caught in the act of hard-selling songs that ought to erupt with feeling.What's worse—if not for me but for people who take the Brel lyrics to heart—is that a lot of the lyrics are difficult to hear and understand. Sometimes it's the fault of the orchestrations, but more often it's the fault of all those images and the changes of scenery and costumes. They get in the way of possible listening pleasure.\n\nJACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS, directed by Denis Heroux; produced by Claude Heroux; co-producers, Paul Marshall and Cinevideo, Inc.; screenplay by Eric Blau; director of photography, Rene Verzier; editor, Yves Langlois; music conducted and orchestrated by Francois Rauber; an American Film Theater production presented by the Ely Landau Organization and Cine-vision, Ltd. Running time: 98 minutes. At selected theaters.WITH: Elly Stone, Mort Shuman, Joe Masiell, Jacques Brel and others."
