        "text": "A disturbed American war veteran -Mathieu Carrière- arrives in Belfast during the Northern Ireland conflicts , and proceeds to terrorize a household of female nursing students (Debra Berger , Christine Boisson , Myriam Boyer , Leonora Fani , Ely Galleani , Carole Laure , Eva Mattes) and executing tasteless tortures . For these nine young women, opening the door that night meant ending their live ! . Nine scaring young women. One night. Defiled. Tortured. Torn apart . A diabolic shocker that will grip you and hold you Spellbound ! . Don't ever let him enter your house ! No woman can escape him because he was Born for Hell\n\nA grim and thrilling film about a boarding house that is invaded by a heinous visitor , it contains inexplicable disturbing occurrences , shocks, thrills , suspense , chills , hair-rising events and surprising final . Dealing with an eerie story of a stranger who arrives in Belfast and invades a house shared by eight nurses , while carries out a criminal spree and proceeding to kill them . Loosely based on the notorious Richard Speck murders , this starts off at a brief depiction of the Besfast streets , pubs and violent confrontation between IRA members and British cops , as the camera lurks suspensenful behind its actors and beside them and above them and everywhere else . The story is uneven paced , suffering from some weak incidents and of varying quality , packing nice as well as fleeble moments . The main amusement of this slasher results to be to guess the kind of murder to execute by the creepy killer , and discover the young actress to be assassinated by stabbing . A scary and disgusting flick that garnered lousy reception as critics as indifferent reception by the general public . Nowadays , it is a little better considered , in spite of its short budget and the claustrophobic environment , as the picture goes on growing more and more and developing little by little until the unexpected ending . Nice acting by the German Mathieu Carrière as the unsettling Vietnam vet returning home via Belfast resulting in fateful consequences . He's well accompanied a lot of known B-actress from Europe that starred a lot of films at the time and in all kinds of genres , such as : Debra Berger , Christine Boisson , Miriam Boyer, Leonora Fani , Ely Galleani , Carole Laure and Eva Mattes who often played for Werner Herzog .\n\nAtmospheric cinematography , though being really necessary a perfect remastering . Shot on location in Hamburg, Germany , Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland (Belfast segments) , Belfast, County Antrimc, Northern Irelandc, UK and Studio Bendestorf, Lower Saxony, Germany . This chilling and obscure terror movie was regularly directed by Denis Héroux and uncredited Géza von Radványi . This nice filmmaker Denis Héroux, was born 1940 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and died 2015 in Montreal . He was a producer/director, and Member of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1981 . He was awarded the O. C. -Officer of the Order of Canada- on December 19 , 1983 for his services to the film industry in Canada . He was a notorious director and producer , being especially known for The Uncanny (1977) , Atlantic City (1980) , Quest for Fire (1981) , The Bay Boy (1984) , The Park in Mine (1985) . Denis directed some films in all sorts of genres , such as : ¨Born for Hell , Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris , Strikebreaker , Y'a toujours moyen de moyenner! , J'ai mon voyage! , Quelques arpents de neige , Un enfant comme les autres.., fois... par jour , L'amour humain , L'initiation , Valérie , Pas de vacances pour les idoles and Alone or with Others¨ . Born For Hell (1976) rating : 5/10 . Mediocre , though passable terror movie."
