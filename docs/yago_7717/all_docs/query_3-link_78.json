But Mr. Chabrol, wearing a mischievous smile, is obviously in his element. A smallish man with rounded shoulders and an ill-fitting suit, he delights in small flashes of humor and small, human, cinematic touches. ''There are lots of films now about robots, made with robots,'' he says, carefully filling his pipe. ''I'm afraid they might be for an audience of robots, too. Me, I'm interested in people.''\n\nOne of the founding fathers of the French New Wave cinema, Claude Chabrol is filming ''Le Sang des Autres'' (''The Blood of Others''), an early novel by Simone de Beauvoir, written in 1944. ''The Blood of Others'' is the story of two wartime lovers, Helene and Jean. Set in France before and during the Occupation, it traces Helene's attachment to Jean, and Jean's commitment to the Resistance. It is an existentialist tale of hard choices and individual responsibility.\n\n''The Blood of Others'' is the first Simone de Beauvoir work ever to be filmed, and the novelist and screenwriter Brian Moore (whose credits include Alfred Hitchcock's ''Torn Curtain'') had the formidable task of drafting a two-hour, a four- hour, and a six-hour adaptation. The movie will be shown in its four-hour version in early fall on HBO. In France and Canada, it appears first in the theaters, in April, and on television a year later.\n\nThis unusual plan, shooting several scripts simultaneously and setting multiple release dates, is a creative solution to the budgetary problems faced by the Canadian co-producers John Kemeny and Denis Heroux (whose recent credits include ''Quest for Fire'' and ''Atlantic City''). ''Like all independent producers, we have a lot of trouble with financing,'' said Mr. Kemeny. ''So we try to do two things: first, go very international for backers - to the U.S., to France, to Canada; and second, expand the production, so it can be a mini- series on cable TV, it can be on regular TV, or it can be a film for theatrical release.''\n\nInstead of a single backer, then, ''The Blood of Others'' has 60 to 70 percent of its $7 million budget covered by a disparate group of international sources: from the United States, HBO; from Canada, the CTV network, Superchannel, and the Canadian Government; and from France, TV network Antenne 2 and the film company Parafrance.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
