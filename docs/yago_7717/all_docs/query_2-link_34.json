        "text": "Police in Houston have arrested two migrants from Venezuela for the murder of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was lured away from home, then strangled and dumped in a bayou.\n\nOne of the suspects crossed the border illegally less than a month before the shocking murder, and was released into the US after claiming he feared for his life if he was sent back to his home country, sources told The Post.\n\nJohan Jose Rangel Martinez, 21, and Franklin Jose Pena Ramos, 26, were charged Thursday with capital murder.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) sources said Pena Ramos crossed into El Paso, Texas, on May 28. He was released soon after his interaction with border agents.\n\nHe told authorities that he planned to live with his cousin in Houston until his court appearance in July, sources said.\n\nAgents put a GPS tracker on Pena Ramos, which was only set to monitor his location for 21 days, sources said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether he was wearing the tracker when Jocelyn was murdered.\n\nThe second suspect, Rangel Martinez, crossed the border at El Pas on March 14 and was released with a court date in August, sources said.\n\nHe also had a GPS monitor, but was removed from the program in May, according to the sources.\n\nInvestigators identified the suspects from surveillance footage, after they were seen following Jocelyn as she walked into a local convenience store.\n\nHer body was found in a swampy creek on Monday by a Houston resident who happened to be driving by. She told KTRK-TV she thought the girl was a floating mannequin at first.\n\n“I did a U-turn, and I stopped on the bridge, put my flashers on, looked down, and realized it was someone. I parked right here and called 911 immediately,” she said.\n\nThe two migrants were arrested at a local apartment complex, where they had been living as roommates, cops said.\n\nHomeland Security has opened an investigation into the suspects’ immigration histories.\n\nThe victim’s mother, Alexis Nungaray, said her daughter sneaked out of their apartment late Sunday.\n\nShe told local outlet KHOU that she was taken “advantage of” by her killers.\n\n“I’m like angry that they took advantage of her. She was so young. She was 12, you took my baby away, you took her away. Now, I get to let her little brother know his older sister is never coming home,” she said.\n\n“She turned into a beautiful, beautiful young lady,” Alexis said. “I was really looking forward to seeing how she was gonna be and they took every opportunity away from me and my family.”\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire said Thursday that the Jocelyn’s murder affected him personally.\n\n“As a grandfather and a father, it doesn’t get any worse,” Whitmire said.\n\n“If there is any circumstance where you deny bail, this is it.”\n\nAuthorities in Houston are still investigating whether Nungaray’s killers sexually assaulted her.\n\nNungaray’s story follows a slew of high-profile crimes tied to migrants who entered the country illegally, including the rape of a 13-year-old girl in a Bronx park last week.\n\nThe suspect in that case, a migrant from Ecuador, crossed into Eagle Pass, Texas, in 2021 and was ordered removed by an immigration judge the following year, The Post recently revealed.\n\nHowever, he was never deported.\n\nThe man recently charged with the rape and murder of Maryland mom-of-5 Rachel Morin is a Salvadoran alleged gang member who crossed into the US three times in two months and was booted — before apparently entering undetected on his fourth try."
