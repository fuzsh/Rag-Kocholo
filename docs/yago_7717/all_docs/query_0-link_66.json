SAR studies coupled with in vivo evaluations in rat arthritis model culminated in the identification of 10 with excellent oral efficacy. Compound 10 exhibited a significantly enhanced dissolution rate compared to 1, translating to a high oral bioavailability (>90%) in rat. In animal studies 10 inhibited LPS-stimulated production of tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} in a dose-dependent manner and demonstrated robust efficacy comparable to dexamethasone in a rat streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis model.\n\nLipoxins and novel 15-epi-lipoxin analogs display potent anti-inflammatory actions after oral administration.\n\nPubMed\n\nBannenberg, Gerard; Moussignac, Rose-Laure; Gronert, Karsten; Devchand, Pallavi R; Schmidt, Birgitta A; Guilford, William J; Bauman, John G; Subramanyam, Babu; Perez, H Daniel; Parkinson, John F; Serhan, Charles N\n\n2004-09-01\n\n1. Lipoxins (LX) and aspirin-triggered 15-epi-lipoxins (ATL) exert potent anti-inflammatory actions. In the present study, we determined the anti-inflammatory efficacy of endogenous LXA(4) and LXB(4), the stable ATL analog ATLa2, and a series of novel 3-oxa-ATL analogs (ZK-996, ZK-990, ZK-994, and ZK-142) after intravenous, oral, and topical administration in mice. 2. LXA(4), LXB(4), ATLa2, and ZK-994 were orally active, exhibiting potent systemic inhibition of zymosan A-induced peritonitis at very low doses (50 ng kg(-1)-50 microg kg(-1)). 3. Intravenous ZK-994 and ZK-142 (500 microg kg(-1)) potently attenuated hind limb ischemia/reperfusion-induced lung injury, with 32+/-12 and 53+/-5% inhibition (P<0.05), respectively, of neutrophil accumulation in lungs. The same dose of ATLa2 had no significant protective action. 4. Topical application of ATLa2, ZK-994, and ZK-142 ( approximately 20 microg cm(-2)) prevented vascular leakage and neutrophil infiltration in LTB(4)/PGE(2)-stimulated ear skin inflammation. While ATLa2 and ZK-142 displayed approximately equal anti-inflammatory efficacy in this model, ZK-994 displayed a slower onset of action. 5. In summary, native LXA(4) and LXB(4), and analogs ATLa2, ZK-142, and ZK-994 retain broad anti-inflammatory effects after intravenous, oral, and topical administration. The 3-oxa-ATL analogs, which have enhanced metabolic and chemical stability and a superior pharmacokinetic profile, provide new opportunities to explore the actions and therapeutic potential for LX and ATL.\n\nPotent and Orally Bioavailable GPR142 Agonists as Novel Insulin Secretagogues for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGPR142 is a G protein-coupled receptor that is predominantly expressed in pancreatic Î²-cells. GPR142 agonists stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of high glucose concentration, so that they could be novel insulin secretagogues with reduced or no risk of hypoglycemia. We report here the optimization of HTS hit compound 1 toward a proof of concept compound 33, which showed potent glucose lowering effects during an oral glucose tolerance test in mice and monkeys. PMID:24900747\n\nSL-01, an oral gemcitabine derivative, inhibited human cancer growth more potently than gemcitabine\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhao, Cuirong; Yue, Bin; Liu, Huiping\n\n2012-08-01\n\nSL-01, an oral gemcitabine derivative, was synthesized by introducing the moiety of 3-(dodecyloxycarbonyl)pyrazine-2-carbonyl at the N4-position on the cytidine ring of gemcitabine. Our goal in this study was to evaluate the efficacy of SL-01 on the growth of human cancers with gemcitabine as control. Experiments were performed on human non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460 and colon cancer HCT-116 both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays, SL-01 significantly inhibited the growth of cancer cells as determined by the 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Further studies indicated that SL-01 induced the cancer cells to apoptosis showing chromatin condensation andmoreÂ Â» externalization of phosphatidylserine. In in vivo studies, we evaluated the efficacy of SL-01 in nude mice bearing human cancer xenografts. SL-01 effectively delayed the growth of NCI-H460 and HCT-116 without significant loss of body weight. Molecular analysis indicated that the high efficacy of SL-01 was associated with its ability to induce apoptosis as evidenced by increase of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining cells, activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) in tumor tissues. SL-01 also increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in cancer cells. These biological activities of SL-01 were more potential than that of gemcitabine. Based on these in vitro and in vivo results, SL-01 is proposed as a potent oral anticancer agent that may supplant the use of gemcitabine in the clinic. -- Highlights: âº An oral gemcitabine derivative SL-01 was synthesized. âº The effects of SL-01 were evaluated and its efficacy was compared with gemcitabine. âº The biological activities of SL-01 were more potent than that of gemcitabine. âº SL-01 could replace gemcitabine for clinical use.Â«Â less\n\nPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyanoenone), a highly potent Nrf2 activator with a reversible covalent mode of action\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKostov, Rumen V.; Knatko, Elena V.; McLaughlin, Lesley A.\n\nThe acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyanoenone) TBE-31 is a highly potent cysteine targeting compound with a reversible covalent mode of action; its best-characterized target being Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), the cellular sensor for oxidants and electrophiles. TBE-31 reacts with cysteines of Keap1, impairing its ability to target nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) for degradation. Consequently, Nrf2 accumulates and orchestrates cytoprotective gene expression. In this study we investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of TBE-31 in C57BL/6 mice. After a single oral dose of 10Â Î¼mol/kg (â¼200Â nmol/animal), the concentration of TBE-31 in blood exhibited two peaks, at 22.3Â nM and at 15.5Â nM, 40Â minmoreÂ Â» and 4Â h after dosing, respectively, as determined by a quantitative stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS method. The AUC{sub 0â24h} was 195.5Â h/nmol/l, the terminal elimination half-life was 10.2Â h, and the k{sub el} was 0.068Â h{sup â1}. To assess the pharmacodynamics of Nrf2 activation by TBE-31, we determined the enzyme activity of its prototypic target, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and found it elevated by 2.4- and 1.5-fold in liver and heart, respectively. Continuous feeding for 18 days with diet delivering the same daily doses of TBE-31 under conditions of concurrent treatment with the immunosuppressive agent azathioprine had a similar effect on Nrf2 activation without any indications of toxicity. Together with previous reports showing the cytoprotective effects of TBE-31 in animal models of carcinogenesis, our results demonstrate the high potency, efficacy and suitability for chronic administration of cysteine targeting reversible covalent drugs. - Highlights: â¢ TBE-31 is a cysteine targeting compound with a reversible covalent mode of action. â¢ After a single oral dose, the blood concentration of TBE-31 exhibits two peaks. â¢ Oral TBE-31 is a potent activator of Nrf2-dependent enzymes\n\nPre-clinical pharmacology of ICI D2138, a potent orally-active non-redox inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMcMillan, R. M.; Spruce, K. E.; Crawley, G. C.; Walker, E. R.; Foster, S. J.\n\n1992-01-01\n\n1. This paper describes the pre-clinical pharmacology of ICI D2138, a potent orally-active non-redox inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase which is undergoing clinical evaluation. 2. ICI D2138 potently inhibited leukotriene synthesis in murine peritoneal macrophages (IC50 = 3 nM) and human blood (IC50 = 20 nM). In human and dog blood, ICI D2138 did not inhibit thromboxane B2 synthesis at a concentration of 500 microM, thus the selectivity ratio (cyclo-oxygenase: 5-lipoxygenase) was greater than 20,000. In contrast, zileuton (a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor also undergoing clinical evaluation) exhibited a selectivity ratio of 15-100. 3. ICI D2138 potently and dose-dependently inhibited ex vivo leukotriene B4 (LTB4) synthesis by rat blood with ED50 values of 0.9, 4.0 and 80.0 mg kg-1 p.o. at 3, 10 and 20 h respectively after dosing. Similar activity was observed for inhibition of LTB4 production in a zymosan-inflamed rat air pouch model. Zileuton produced ED50 values of 5 and 20 mg kg-1 at 3 and 10 h respectively. 4. Oral administration of 1, 3 or 10 mg kg-1 ICI D2138 to dogs produced maximal inhibition of ex vivo LTB4 synthesis by blood for 5, 9 and 31 h respectively. A dose of 5 mg kg-1 p.o. of zileuton caused maximal inhibition of LTB4 for 24 h. 5. Oral administration of 10 mg kg-1 ICI D2138 caused total inhibition of LTB4 production in zymosan-inflamed rabbit knee joint. 6. Topical administration of ICI D2138 to rabbit skin caused a dose-related inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced plasma extravasation with an ID30 of 1.08 nmol per site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) PMID:1334748\n\nDesign and synthesis of potent, orally-active DGAT-1 inhibitors containing a dioxino[2,3-d]pyrimidine core.\n\nPubMed\n\nDow, Robert L; Andrews, Melissa; Aspnes, Gary E; Balan, Gayatri; Michael Gibbs, E; Guzman-Perez, Angel; Karki, Kapil; Laperle, Jennifer L; Li, Jian-Cheng; Litchfield, John; Munchhof, Michael J; Perreault, Christian; Patel, Leena\n\n2011-10-15\n\nA novel series of potent DGAT-1 inhibitors was developed originating from the lactam-based clinical candidate PF-04620110. Incorporation of a dioxino[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based core afforded good alignment of pharmacophore features and resulted in improved passive permeability. Development of an efficient, homochiral synthesis of these targets facilitated confirmation of predictions regarding the stereochemical-dependence of DGAT-1 inhibition for this series. Compound 10 was shown to be a potent inhibitor of human DGAT-1 (10 nM) and to suppress triglyceride synthesis at oral doses of <3mg/kg. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously reported the imidazo[1,5-c]imidazol-3-one derivative 1 as a potent and orally active FXa inhibitor. However, it was found that 1 predominantly undergoes hydrolysis upon incubation with human liver microsomes, and the human specific metabolic pathway made it difficult to predict the human pharmacokinetics. To address this issue, our synthetic efforts were focused on modification of the imidazo[1,5-c]imidazol-3-one moiety of the active metabolite 3a, derived from 1, which resulted in the discovery of the tetrahydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one derivative 5k as a highly potent and selective FXa inhibitor. Compound 5k showed no detectable amide bond cleavage in human liver microsomes, exhibited a good pharmacokinetic profile in monkeys, and had a potent antithrombotic efficacy in a rabbit model without prolongation of bleeding time. Compound 5k is currently under clinical development with the code name TAK-442.\n\nInduction of ovulation by a potent, orally active, low molecular weight agonist (Org 43553) of the luteinizing hormone receptor.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan de Lagemaat, R; Timmers, C M; Kelder, J; van Koppen, C; Mosselman, S; Hanssen, R G J M\n\n2009-03-01\n\nIn assisted reproductive technology, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered subcutaneously for the induction of oocyte maturation and ovulation. Our efforts to develop orally bioavailable luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor agonists have led to the discovery of Org 43553, a low molecular weight (LMW) LH receptor (LH-R) agonist. Org 43553 was tested in vitro and in vivo in pre-clinical pharmacological models to demonstrate efficacy and oral availability. Org 43553 is a potent stimulator of the human LH-R in vitro (EC(50) 3.7 nM). In primary mouse Leydig cells, Org 43553 stimulated testosterone production. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed high oral bioavailability in rats (79%) and dogs (44%) with a shorter half-life compared with hCG (3.4 versus 5.6 h in the rat). Ovulation induction by Org 43553 was demonstrated in immature mice as well as in cyclic rats after single-dose oral administration (50 mg/kg). The ovulated oocytes were of good quality as demonstrated by successful fertilization and implantation of normal embryos. In male rats, testosterone production was substantially induced after oral administration. Org 43553 is the first LMW LH-R mimetic with demonstrated in vivo efficacy upon oral administration and could therefore replace subcutaneously administered hCG. The elimination half-life of Org 43553 is substantially shorter than hCG, which could potentially represent a clinical benefit in reducing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n\nA potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B improves insulin and leptin signaling in animal models.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrishnan, Navasona; Konidaris, Konstantis F; Gasser, Gilles; Tonks, Nicholas K\n\n2018-02-02\n\nThe protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B is a negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling and a highly validated therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity. Conventional approaches to drug development have produced potent and specific PTP1B inhibitors, but these inhibitors lack oral bioavailability, which limits their potential for drug development. Here, we report that DPM-1001, an analog of the specific PTP1B inhibitor trodusquemine (MSI-1436), is a potent, specific, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of PTP1B. DPM-1001 also chelates copper, which enhanced its potency as a PTP1B inhibitor. DPM-1001 displayed anti-diabetic properties that were associated with enhanced signaling through insulin and leptin receptors in animal models of diet-induced obesity. Therefore, DPM-1001 represents a proof of concept for a new approach to therapeutic intervention in diabetes and obesity. Although the PTPs have been considered undruggable, the findings of this study suggest that allosteric PTP inhibitors may help reinvigorate drug development efforts that focus on this important family of signal-transducing enzymes.

In the radioligand-binding assay, CS-3150 inhibited (3)H-aldosterone binding to mineralocorticoid receptor with an IC50 value of 9.4nM, and its potency was superior to that of spironolactone and eplerenone, whose IC50s were 36 and 713nM, respectively. CS-3150 also showed at least 1000-fold higher selectivity for mineralocorticoid receptor over other steroid hormone receptors, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor. In the reporter gene assay, CS-3150 inhibited aldosterone-induced transcriptional activation of human mineralocorticoid receptor with an IC50 value of 3.7nM, and its potency was superior to that of spironolactone and eplerenone, whose IC50s were 66 and 970nM, respectively. CS-3150 had no agonistic effect on mineralocorticoid receptor and did not show any antagonistic or agonistic effect on glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor even at the high concentration of 5Î¼M. In adrenalectomized rats, single oral administration of CS-3150 suppressed aldosterone-induced decrease in urinary Na(+)/K(+) ratio, an index of in vivo mineralocorticoid receptor activation, and this suppressive effect was more potent and longer-lasting than that of spironolactone and eplerenone. Chronic treatment with CS-3150 inhibited blood pressure elevation induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt-loading to rats, and this antihypertensive effect was more potent than that of spironolactone and eplerenone. These findings indicate that CS-3150 is a selective and highly potent mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with long-lasting oral activity. This agent could be useful for the treatment of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disorders. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By incorporation of an indole or a quinoline moiety to the 9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indole core, we identified a series of small molecules showing high binding affinities to BET proteins and low nanomolar potencies in inhibition of cell growth in acute leukemia cell lines. One such compound, 4-(6-methoxy-2-methyl-4-(quinolin-4-yl)-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indol-7-yl)-3,5-dimethylisoxazole (31) has excellent microsomal stability and good oral pharmacokinetics in rats and mice. Orally administered, 31 achieves significant antitumor activity in the MV4;11 leukemia and MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer xenograft models in mice. Determination of the cocrystal structure of 31moreÂ Â» with BRD4 BD2 provides a structural basis for its high binding affinity to BET proteins. Testing its binding affinities against other bromodomain-containing proteins shows that 31 is a highly selective inhibitor of BET proteins. Our data show that 31 is a potent, selective, and orally active BET inhibitor.Â«Â less\n\nHighly potent growth hormone secretagogues: hybrids of NN703 and ipamorelin.\n\nPubMed\n\nHansen, T K; Ankersen, M; Raun, K; Hansen, B S\n\n2001-07-23\n\nA series of NN703 analogues with lysine mimetics combined with naphthyl- or biphenylalanine in the core has been prepared and tested in vitro in a rat pituitary cell based assay and subsequently in vivo in pigs in a single dose at 50 nmol/kg. Re-introduction of certain pharmacophores in the C-terminal of NN703, which were originally removed during optimisation for oral bioavailability, led to unexpectedly potent compounds in vitro as well as in vivo.\n\nOral zinc sulphate causes murine hair hypopigmentation and is a potent inhibitor of eumelanogenesis in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlonka, P M; Handjiski, B; Michalczyk, D; Popik, M; Paus, R\n\n2006-07-01\n\nC57BL/6 a/a mice have been widely used to study melanogenesis, including in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies. Zinc cations modulate melanogenesis, but the net effect of Zn2+ in vivo is unclear, as the reported effects of Zn2+ on melanogenesis are ambiguous: zinc inhibits tyrosinase and glutathione reductase in vitro, but also enhances the activity of dopachrome tautomerase (tyrosinase-related protein-2) and has agonistic effects on melanocortin receptor signalling. To determine in a C57BL/6 a/a murine pilot study whether excess zinc ions inhibit, enhance or in any other way alter hair follicle melanogenesis in vivo, and to test the usefulness of EPR for this study. ZnSO(4).7H2O was continuously administered orally to C57BL/6 a/a mice during spontaneous and depilation-induced hair follicle cycling (20 mg mL-1; in drinking water; mean+/-SD daily dose 1.2+/-0.53 mL), and hair pigmentation was examined macroscopically, by routine histology and by EPR. Oral zinc cations induced a bright brown lightening of new hair shafts produced during anagen, but without inducing an EPR-detectable switch from eumelanogenesis to phaeomelanogenesis. The total content of melanin in the skin and hair shafts during the subsequent telogen phase, i.e. after completion of a full hair cycle, was significantly reduced in Zn-treated mice (P=0.0005). Compared with controls, melanin granules in precortical hair matrix keratinocytes, hair bulb melanocytes and hair shafts of zinc-treated animals were reduced and poorly pigmented. Over the course of several hair cycles, lasting hair shaft depigmentation was seen during long-term exposure to high-dose oral Zn2+. High-dose oral Zn2+ is a potent downregulator of eumelanin content in murine hair shafts in vivo. The C57BL/6 mouse model offers an excellent tool for further dissecting the as yet unclear underlying molecular basis of this phenomenon, while EPR technology is well suited for the rapid, qualitative and quantitative monitoring of\n\nOptimization of 2-Anilino 4-Amino Substituted Quinazolines into Potent Antimalarial Agents with Oral in Vivo Activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGilson, Paul R; Tan, Cyrus; Jarman, Kate E; Lowes, Kym N; Curtis, Joan M; Nguyen, William; Di Rago, Adrian E; Bullen, Hayley E; Prinz, Boris; Duffy, Sandra; Baell, Jonathan B; Hutton, Craig A; Jousset Subroux, Helene; Crabb, Brendan S; Avery, Vicky M; Cowman, Alan F; Sleebs, Brad E\n\n2017-02-09\n\nNovel antimalarial therapeutics that target multiple stages of the parasite lifecycle are urgently required to tackle the emerging problem of resistance with current drugs. Here, we describe the optimization of the 2-anilino quinazoline class as antimalarial agents. The class, identified from publicly available antimalarial screening data, was optimized to generate lead compounds that possess potent antimalarial activity against P. falciparum parasites comparable to the known antimalarials, chloroquine and mefloquine. During the optimization process, we defined the functionality necessary for activity and improved in vitro metabolism and solubility. The resultant lead compounds possess potent activity against a multidrug resistant strain of P. falciparum and arrest parasites at the ring phase of the asexual stage and also gametocytogensis. Finally, we show that the lead compounds are orally efficacious in a 4 day murine model of malaria disease burden.\n\nDiscovery of methylsulfonyl indazoles as potent and orally active respiratory syncytial Virus(RSV) fusion inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Song; Li, Chao; Chen, Dongdong; Zheng, Xiufang; Yun, Hongying; Gao, Lu; Shen, Hong C\n\n2017-09-29\n\nRecently we described a novel class of imidazopyridine compounds that showed exceptional anti-RSV potency in cell culture. However, unfavorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and glutathione (GSH) adduct liabilities impeded their further development. In a bid to address the PK and early safety concerns, a small compound library consisting of dozens of scaffold-hopping analogues was designed and synthesized for RSV CPE assay screening, which led to the identification of a new chemical starting point: methylsulfonyl indole compound 8. In this paper, we report the discovery and optimization of a series of methylsulfonyl indazoles as potent RSV fusion inhibitors. In particular, compound 47 was orally efficacious in a RSV mouse model, with 1.6 log unit viral load reduction at 25Â mg/kg BID upon oral dosing. The results may have broad implications for the design of new RSV fusion inhibitors, and demonstrate the potential for developing novel therapies for RSV infection.

On the basis of X-ray crystallography, we designed a series of potent MMP-13 selective inhibitors optimized to occupy the distinct deep S1' pocket including an adjacent branch. Among them, carboxylic acid inhibitor 21k exhibited excellent potency and selectivity for MMP-13 over other MMPs. An effort to convert compound 21k to the mono sodium salt 38 was promising in all animal species studied. Moreover, no overt toxicity was observed in a preliminary repeat dose oral toxicity study of compound 21k in rats. A single oral dose of compound 38 significantly reduced degradation products (CTX-II) released from articular cartilage into the joint cavity in a rat MIA model in vivo. In this article, we report the discovery of highly potent, selective, and orally bioavailable MMP-13 inhibitors as well as their detailed structure-activity data.\n\nAllosteric Inhibition of SHP2: Identification of a Potent, Selective, and Orally Efficacious Phosphatase Inhibitor\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGarcia Fortanet, Jorge; Chen, Christine Hiu-Tung; Chen, Ying-Nan P.\n\nSHP2 is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) encoded by the PTPN11 gene involved in cell growth and differentiation via the MAPK signaling pathway. SHP2 also purportedly plays an important role in the programmed cell death pathway (PD-1/PD-L1). Because it is an oncoprotein associated with multiple cancer-related diseases, as well as a potential immunomodulator, controlling SHP2 activity is of significant therapeutic interest. Recently in our laboratories, a small molecule inhibitor of SHP2 was identified as an allosteric modulator that stabilizes the autoinhibited conformation of SHP2. A high throughput screen was performed to identify progressable chemical matter, and X-ray crystallography revealedmoreÂ Â» the location of binding in a previously undisclosed allosteric binding pocket. Structure-based drug design was employed to optimize for SHP2 inhibition, and several new proteinâligand interactions were characterized. These studies culminated in the discovery of 6-(4-amino-4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-3-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)pyrazin-2-amine (SHP099, 1), a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, and efficacious SHP2 inhibitor.Â«Â less\n\nIdentification of potent orally active factor Xa inhibitors based on conjugation strategy and application of predictable fragment recommender system.\n\nPubMed\n\nIshihara, Tsukasa; Koga, Yuji; Iwatsuki, Yoshiyuki; Hirayama, Fukushi\n\n2015-01-15\n\nAnticoagulant agents have emerged as a promising class of therapeutic drugs for the treatment and prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis.

Structural optimization of anthranilamide derivative 3 as a lead compound with installation of phenolic hydroxyl group and extensive exploration of the P1 binding element led to the identification of 5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl)-3-hydroxy-2-{[4-(4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)benzoyl]amino}benzamide (33, AS1468240) as a potent factor Xa inhibitor with significant oral anticoagulant activity. We also reported a newly developed Free-Wilson-like fragment recommender system based on the integration of R-group decomposition with collaborative filtering for the structural optimization process.

Abnormalities in CDK activity and regulation are common features of cancer, making CDK family members attractive targets for the development of anticancer drugs. Here, we report the identification of a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derived compound, 4k (BS-194), as a selective and potent CDK inhibitor, which inhibits CDK2, CDK1, CDK5, CDK7, and CDK9 (ICâ â= 3, 30, 30, 250, and 90 nmol/L, respectively). Cell-based studies showed inhibition of the phosphorylation of CDK substrates, Rb and the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain, down-regulation of cyclins A, E, and D1, and cell cycle block in the S and Gâ/M phases. Consistent with these findings, 4k demonstrated potent antiproliferative activity in 60 cancer cell lines tested (mean GIâ â= 280 nmol/L). Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 4k is orally bioavailable, with an elimination half-life of 178 min following oral dosing in mice. When administered at a concentration of 25 mg/kg orally, 4k inhibited human tumor xenografts and suppressed CDK substrate phosphorylation. These findings identify 4k as a novel, potent CDK selective inhibitor with potential for oral delivery in cancer patients.\n\nDiscovery of chiral dihydropyridopyrimidinones as potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitors of AKT.\n\nPubMed\n\nParthasarathy, Saravanan; Henry, Kenneth; Pei, Huaxing; Clayton, Josh; Rempala, Mark; Johns, Deidre; De Frutos, Oscar; Garcia, Pablo; Mateos, Carlos; Pleite, Sehila; Wang, Yong; Stout, Stephanie; Condon, Bradley; Ashok, Sheela; Lu, Zhohai; Ehlhardt, William; Raub, Tom; Lai, Mei; Geeganage, Sandaruwan; Burkholder, Timothy P\n\n2018-06-01\n\nDuring the course of our research efforts to develop potent and selective AKT inhibitors, we discovered enatiomerically pure substituted dihydropyridopyrimidinones (DHP) as potent inhibitors of protein kinase B/AKT with excellent selectivity against ROCK 2 . A key challenge in this program was the poor physicochemical properties of the initial lead compound 5. Integration of structure-based drug design and physical properties-based design resulted in replacement of a highly hydrophobic poly fluorinated aryl ring by a simple trifluoromethyl that led to identification of compound 6 with much improved physicochemical properties. Subsequent SAR studies led to the synthesis of new pyran analog 7 with improved cell potency. Further optimization of pharmacokintetics properties by increasing permeability with appropriate fluorinated alkyl led to compound 8 as a potent, selective AKT inhibitors that blocks the phosphorylation of GSK3Î² in vivo and had robust, dose and concentration dependent efficacy in the U87MG tumor xenograft model.

OPC-41061 antagonized [3H]-AVP binding to human V2-receptors (Ki = 0.43 +/- 0.06 nM) more potently than AVP (Ki = 0. 78 +/- 0.08 nM) or OPC-31260 (Ki = 9.42 +/- 0.90 nM). OPC-41061 also inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to human V1a-receptors (Ki = 12.3 +/- 0.8 nM) but not to human V1b-receptors, indicating that OPC-41061 was 29 times more selective for V2-receptors than for V1a-receptors. OPC-41061 inhibited cAMP production induced by AVP with no intrinsic agonist activity. In rats, OPC-41061 inhibited [3H]-AVP binding to V1a-receptors (Ki = 325 +/- 41 nM) and V2-receptors (Ki = 1.33 +/- 0. 30 nM), showing higher receptor selectivity (V1a/V2 = 244) than with human receptors. A single oral administration of OPC-41061 in rats clearly produced dose-dependent aquaresis. In treatment by multiple OPC-41061 dosing for 28 days at 1 and 10 mg/kg p.o. in rats, significant aquaretic effects were seen throughout the study period. As the result of aquaresis, hemoconcentration was seen at 4 hr postdosing although, no differences were seen in serum osmolality, sodium, creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations at 24 hr postdosing. Furthermore, there was no difference in serum AVP concentration, pituitary AVP content or the number and affinity of AVP receptors in the kidney and liver at trough throughout the study period. These results demonstrate that OPC-41061 is a highly potent human AVP V2-receptor antagonist and produces clear aquaresis after single and multiple dosing, suggesting the usefulness in the treatment of various water retaining states.\n\nKR-12-a5 is a non-cytotoxic agent with potent antimicrobial effects against oral pathogens.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaiaffa, Karina Sampaio; Massunari, Loiane; Danelon, Marcelle; Abuna, Gabriel Flores; Bedran, Telma Blanca Lombardo; Santos-Filho, Norival Alves; Spolidorio, Denise Madalena Palomari; Vizoto, Natalia Leal; Cilli, Eduardo Maffud; Duque, Cristiane\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThis study evaluated the cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of analogs of cationic peptides against microorganisms associated with endodontic infections. L-929 fibroblasts were exposed to LL-37, KR-12-a5 and hBD-3-1C V and chlorhexidine (CHX, control), and cell metabolism was evaluated with MTT. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC) of the peptides and CHX were determined against oral pathogens associated with endodontic infections. Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans biofilms were cultivated in bovine dentin blocks, exposed to different concentrations of the most efficient antimicrobial peptide and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. CHX and peptides affected the metabolism of L-929 at concentrationsÂ >Â 31.25 and 500Â Î¼gÂ ml -1 , respectively. Among the peptides, KR-12-a5 inhibited growth of both the microorganisms tested with the lowest MIC/MBC/MFC values. In addition, KR-12-a5 significantly reduced E. faecalis and S. mutans biofilms inside dentin tubules. In conclusion, KR-12-a5 is a non-cytotoxic agent with potent antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity against oral pathogens associated with endodontic infections.\n\nSCH 206272: a potent, orally active tachykinin NK(1), NK(2), and NK(3) receptor antagonist.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnthes, John C; Chapman, Richard W; Richard, Christian; Eckel, Stephen; Corboz, Michel; Hey, John A; Fernandez, Xiomara; Greenfeder, Scott; McLeod, Robbie; Sehring, Susan; Rizzo, Charles; Crawley, Yvette; Shih, Neng-Yang; Piwinski, John; Reichard, Greg; Ting, Pauline; Carruthers, Nick; Cuss, Francis M; Billah, Motasim; Kreutner, William; Egan, Robert W\n\n2002-08-23\n\nExperiments were performed to characterize the pharmacology of SCH 206272 [(R,R)-1'[5-[(3,5-dichlorobenzoyl)methylamino]-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4(Z)-(methoxyimino)pentyl]-N-methyl-2-oxo-[1,4'bipiperidine]-3-acetamide] as a potent and selective antagonist of tachykinin (NK) NK(1), NK(2), and NK(3) receptors. SCH 206272 inhibited binding at human tachykinin NK(1), NK(2), and NK(3) receptors (K(i) = 1.3, 0.4, and 0.3 nM, respectively) and antagonized [Ca(2+)](i) mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the cloned human tachykinin NK(1), NK(2), or NK(3) receptors. SCH 206272 inhibited relaxation of the human pulmonary artery (pK(b) = 7.7 +/- 0.3) induced by the tachykinin NK(1) receptor agonist, [Met-O-Me] substance P and contraction of the human bronchus (pK(b = 8.2 +/- 0.3) induced by the tachykinin NK(2) receptor agonist, neurokinin A. In isolated guinea pig tissues, SCH 206272 inhibited substance P-induced enhancement of electrical field stimulated contractions of the vas deferens, (pK(b = 7.6 +/- 0.2), NKA-induced contraction of the bronchus (pK(b) = 7.7 +/- 0.2), and senktide-induced contraction of the ileum. In vivo, oral SCH 206272 (0.1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited substance P-induced airway microvascular leakage and neurokinin A-induced bronchospasm in the guinea pig. In a canine in vivo model, SCH 206272 (0.1-3 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited NK(1) and NK(2) activities induced by exogenous substance P and neurokinin A. Furthermore, in guinea pig models involving endogenously released tachykinins, SCH 206272 inhibited hyperventilation-induced bronchospasm, capsaicin-induced cough, and airway microvascular leakage induced by nebulized hypertonic saline. These data demonstrate that SCH 206272 is a potent, orally active tachykinin NK(1), NK(2), and NK(3) receptor antagonist. This compound may have beneficial effects in diseases thought to be mediated by tachykinins, such as cough, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Inhibitors of BRAF and MEK kinases are approved for the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma, but resistance frequently emerges, often mediated by increased signaling through ERK1/2. Here, we describe the fragment-based generation of ERK1/2 inhibitors that block catalytic phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as RSK but also modulate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK without directly inhibiting MEK. X-ray crystallographic and biophysical fragment screening followed by structure-guided optimization and growth from the hinge into a pocket proximal to the C-Î± helix afforded highly potent ERK1/2 inhibitors with excellent kinome selectivity. In BRAF mutant cells, the lead compound suppresses pRSK and pERK levels and inhibits proliferation at low nanomolar concentrations. The lead exhibits tumor regression upon oral dosing in BRAF mutant xenograft models, providing a promising basis for further optimization toward clinical pERK1/2 modulating ERK1/2 inhibitors.\n\nPyrimethamine as a Potent and Selective Inhibitor of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Identified by High-throughput Drug Screening.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Amit; Jyotsana, Nidhi; Lai, Courteney K; Chaturvedi, Anuhar; Gabdoulline, Razif; GÃ¶rlich, Kerstin; Murphy, Cecilia; Blanchard, Jan E; Ganser, Arnold; Brown, Eric; Hassell, John A; Humphries, R Keith; Morgan, Michael; Heuser, Michael\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation are blocked in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) resulting in cytopenias and a high risk of death. Most patients with AML become resistant to treatment due to lack of effective cytotoxic and differentiation promoting compounds. High MN1 expression confers poor prognosis to AML patients and induces resistance to cytarabine and alltrans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induced differentiation. Using a high-throughput drug screening, we identified the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) antagonist pyrimethamine to be a potent inducer of apoptosis and differentiation in several murine and human leukemia cell lines. Oral pyrimethamine treatment was effective in two xenograft mouse models and specifically targeted leukemic cells in human AML cell lines and primary patient cells, while CD34+ cells from healthy donors were unaffected. The antileukemic effects of PMT could be partially rescued by excess folic acid, suggesting an oncogenic function of folate metabolism in AML. Thus, our study identifies pyrimethamine as a candidate drug that should be further evaluated in AML treatment.\n\n(3,3-Difluoro-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-[(2S,4S)-(4-(4-pyrimidin-2-yl-piperazin-1-yl)-pyrrolidin-2-yl]-methanone: A potent, selective, orally active dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAmmirati, Mark J.; Andrews, Kim M.; Boyer, David D.\n\n2010-10-01\n\nA series of 4-substituted proline amides was synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of dipeptidyl pepdidase IV for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Early tolerance induction is an attractive approach for primary prevention of asthma. Here, we found that breastfeeding by antigen-sensitized mothers exposed to antigen aerosols during lactation induced a robust and long-lasting antigen-specific protection from asthma. Protection was more profound and persistent than the one induced by antigen-exposed non-sensitized mothers. Milk from antigen-exposed sensitized mothers contained antigen-immunoglobulin (Ig) G immune complexes that were transferred to the newborn through the neonatal Fc receptor resulting in the induction of antigen-specific FoxP3(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells. The induction of oral tolerance by milk immune complexes did not require the presence of transforming growth factor-beta in milk in contrast to tolerance induced by milk-borne free antigen. Furthermore, neither the presence of IgA in milk nor the expression of the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb in the newborn was required for tolerance induction. This study provides new insights on the mechanisms of tolerance induction in neonates and highlights that IgG immune complexes found in breast milk are potent inducers of oral tolerance. These observations may pave the way for the identification of key factors for primary prevention of immune-mediated diseases such as asthma.\n\nImproved anticoagulant effect of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate orally administered as gastro-resistant tablets.\n\nPubMed\n\nFonseca, Roberto J C; Sucupira, Isabela D; Oliveira, Stephan Nicollas M C G; Santos, Gustavo R C; MourÃ£o, Paulo A S\n\n2017-04-03\n\nFucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) is a potent anticoagulant polysaccharide extracted from sea cucumber. Its anticoagulant activity is attributed to the presence of unique branches of sulfated fucose. Although this glycosaminoglycan exerts an antithrombotic effect following oral administration, high doses are necessary to achieve the maximum effect. The diminished activity of FucCS following oral administration is likely due to its degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and its limited ability to cross the intestinal cell membranes. The latter aspect is particularly difficult to overcome. However, gastro-resistant tablet formulation may help limit the degradation of FucCS in the gastrointestinal tract. In the present work, we found that the oral administration of FucCS as gastro-resistant tablets produces a more potent and prolonged anticoagulant effect compared with its administration as an aqueous solution, with no significant changes in the bleeding tendency or arterial blood pressure. Experiments using animal models of arterial thrombosis initiated by endothelial injury demonstrated that FucCS delivered as gastro-protective tablets produced a potent antithrombotic effect, whereas its aqueous solution was ineffective. However, there was no significant difference between the effects of FucCS delivered as gastro-resistant tablets or as aqueous solution in a venous thrombosis model, likely due to the high dose of thromboplastin used. New oral anticoagulants tested in these experimental models for comparison showed significantly increased bleeding tendencies. Our study provides a framework for developing effective oral anticoagulants based on sulfated polysaccharides from marine organisms. The present results suggest that FucCS is a promising oral anticoagulant.\n\nNovel indole sulfides as potent HIV-1 NNRTIs.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrigg, Siobhan; Pribut, Nicole; Basson, Adriaan E; Avgenikos, Moscos; Venter, Reinhardt; Blackie, Margaret A; van Otterlo, Willem A L; Pelly, Stephen C\n\n2016-03-15\n\nIn a previous communication we described a series of indole based NNRTIs which were potent inhibitors of HIV replication, both for the wild type and K103N strains of the virus. However, the methyl ether functionality on these compounds, which was crucial for potency, was susceptible to acid promoted indole assisted SN1 substitution. This particular problem did not bode well for an orally bioavailable drug. Here we describe bioisosteric replacement of this problematic functional group, leading to a series of compounds which are potent inhibitors of HIV replication, and are acid stable.

The aim of this study was to develop potent antibody-based antiricin antidotes. Four strong ricin resistant hybridoma clones secreting antiricin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were developed. All four mAbs are bound to conformational epitopes of ricin toxin B (RTB) with high affinity (K D values from 2.55 to 36.27ânM). RTB not only triggers cellular uptake of ricin, but also facilitates transport of the ricin toxin A (RTA) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, where RTA exerts its toxic activity. The four mAbs were found to have potent ricin-neutralizing capacities and synergistic effects among them as determined by an in vitro neutralization assay. In vivo protection assay demonstrated that all four mAbs had strong efficacy against ricin challenges. D9 was found to be exceptionally effective. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of D9, at a dose of 5âÎ¼g, 6 weeks before or 6 hours after an i.p. challenge with 5 Ã LD50 of ricin was able to protect or rescue 100% of the mice, indicating that mAb D9 is an excellent candidate to be developed as a potent antidote against ricin poisoning for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.

SB-271046 also displaced [125I]-SB-258585 from human caudate putamen and rat and pig striatum membranes (pKi 8.81, 9.02 and 8.55 respectively). SB-271046 was over 200 fold selective for the 5-HT6 receptor vs 55 other receptors, binding sites and ion channels. In functional studies on human 5-HT6 receptors SB-271046 competitively antagonized 5-HT-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity with a pA2 of 8.71. SB-271046 produced an increase in seizure threshold over a wide-dose range in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) test, with a minimum effective dose of â©½0.1âmgâkgâ1 p.o. and maximum effect at 4âh post-dose. The level of anticonvulsant activity achieved correlated well with the blood concentrations of SB-271046 (EC50 of 0.16âÎ¼M) and brain concentrations of 0.01â0.04âÎ¼M at Cmax. These data, together with the observed anticonvulsant activity of other selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists, SB-258510 (10âmgâkgâ1, 2â6âh pre-test) and Ro 04-6790 (1â30âmgâkgâ1, 1âh pre-test), in the rat MEST test, suggest that the anticonvulsant properties of SB-271046 are likely to be mediated by 5-HT6 receptors. Overall, these studies demonstrate that SB-271046 is a potent and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist and is orally active in the rat MEST test. SB-271046 represents a valuable tool for evaluating the in vivo central function of 5-HT6 receptors.

Several selective 5-HT6R ligands are currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of AD. We describe results of preclinical development of a novel and highly selective and potent 5- HT6R antagonist, AVN-322, as a clinical candidate for the treatment of AD to improve concurrent debilitation of memory and cognition in the AD patients, and schizophrenia as a substance with antipsychotic effect. In the manuscript, we present its in vitro and vivo efficacy, ADME, pharmacokinetics in animals and in humans, and toxicity. While having high binding affinity in medium picomolar range, the lead compound demonstrates substantially better selectivity index then the reference drug candidates currently being tested in clinical studies. AVN-322 showed high oral bioavailability and favorable blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. In vivo testing revealed its clear cognition enhancing effect. AVN-322 significantly restored both scopolamine- and MK-801-induced cognitive dysfunction and demonstrated antipsychotic potential. Taking into account its good safety profile and favorable pharmacokinetics, AVN-322 can be reasonably considered as a novel drug candidate for the treatment of neurological disorders such as AD and/or schizophrenia.

Methods Based on standards of the 3rd Chinese National Oral Epidemiological Survey and WHO Oral Health Surveys, 1907 graduating students from three senior high schools were examined for caries, periodontitis, dental fluorosis, and oral hygiene status. The questionnaire to the students addressed oral health practices and present access to oral medical services. Results Dental caries prevalence (39.96%) and mean DMFT (0.97) were high in Tibetan students. In community periodontal indexes, the detection rate of gingivitis and dental calculus were 59.50% and 62.64%, respectively. Oral hygiene index-simplified was 0.69, with 0.36 and 0.33 in debris index-simplified and calculus index-simplified, respectively. Community dental fluorosis index was 0.29, with 8.13% in prevalence rate. The questionnaire showed students had poor oral health practices and unawareness for their needs for oral health services. It was also noted that the local area provides inadequate oral medical services. Conclusions Tibetan students had higher prevalence of dental diseases and lower awareness of oral health needs. The main reasons were geographical environment, dietary habit, studentsâ attitude to oral health, and lack of oral health promotion and education. Oral health education and local dentists training should be strengthened to get effective prevention of dental diseases.

The most potent compound, 10, an amide of dehydroabietylamine and acrylic acid, was found to be highly potent against these parasites, displaying an IC50 value of 0.37 Î¼M against L. donovani axenic amastigotes and an outstanding selectivity index of 63. Moreover, compound 10 fully inhibited the growth of intracellular amastigotes in Leishmania donovani-infected human macrophages with a low IC50 value of 0.06 Î¼M. This compound was also highly effective against T. cruzi amastigotes residing in L6 cells with an IC50 value of 0.6 Î¼M and high selectivity index of 58, being 3.5 times more potent than the reference compound benznidazole. The potent activity of this compound and its relatively low cytotoxicity make it attractive for further development in pursuit of better drugs for patients suffering from leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.\n\nDiscovery of Potent and Selective Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV Inhibitors Derived from [beta]-Aminoamides Bearing Subsituted Triazolopiperazines\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKim, Dooseop; Kowalchick, Jennifer E.; Brockunier, Linda L.\n\n2008-06-30\n\nA series of {beta}-aminoamides bearing triazolopiperazines have been discovered as potent, selective, and orally active dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors by extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around the triazolopiperazine moiety. Among these, compound 34b with excellent in vitro potency (IC{sub 50} = 4.3 nM) against DPP-4, high selectivity over other enzymes, and good pharmacokinetic profiles exhibited pronounced in vivo efficacy in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in lean mice. On the basis of these properties, compound 34b has been profiled in detail. Further refinement of the triazolopiperazines resulted in the discovery of a series of extremely potent compounds withmoreÂ Â» subnanomolar activity against DPP-4 (42b-49b), that is, 4-fluorobenzyl-substituted compound 46b, which is notable for its superior potency (IC{sub 50} = 0.18 nM). X-ray crystal structure determination of compounds 34b and 46b in complex with DPP-4 enzyme revealed that (R)-stereochemistry at the 8-position of triazolopiperazines is strongly preferred over (S) with respect to DPP-4 inhibition.Â«Â less\n\nDiscovery of N-((4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-6-yl)-5-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methyl)-2-fluoroaniline (EW-7197): a highly potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of TGF-Î² type I receptor kinase as cancer immunotherapeutic/antifibrotic agent.\n\nPubMed\n\nJin, Cheng Hua; Krishnaiah, Maddeboina; Sreenu, Domalapally; Subrahmanyam, Vura B; Rao, Kota S; Lee, Hwa Jeong; Park, So-Jung; Park, Hyun-Ju; Lee, Kiho; Sheen, Yhun Yhong; Kim, Dae-Kee\n\n2014-05-22\n\nA series of 2-substituted-4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-6-yl)-5-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)imidazoles was synthesized and evaluated to optimize a prototype inhibitor of TGF-Î² type I receptor kinase (ALK5), 6. Combination of replacement of a quinoxalin-6-yl moiety of 6 with a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-6-yl moiety, insertion of a methyleneamino linker, and a o-F substituent in the phenyl ring markedly increased ALK5 inhibitory activity, kinase selectivity, and oral bioavailability. The 12b (EW-7197) inhibited ALK5 with IC50 value of 0.013 Î¼M in a kinase assay and with IC50 values of 0.0165 and 0.0121 Î¼M in HaCaT (3TP-luc) stable cells and 4T1 (3TP-luc) stable cells, respectively, in a luciferase assay. Selectivity profiling of 12b using a panel of 320 protein kinases revealed that it is a highly selective ALK5/ALK4 inhibitor. Pharmacokinetic study with 12bÂ·HCl in rats showed an oral bioavailability of 51% with high systemic exposure (AUC) of 1426 ng Ã h/mL and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 1620 ng/mL. Rational optimization of 6 has led to the identification of a highly potent, selective, and orally bioavailable ALK5 inhibitor 12b.\n\nDiscovery of a highly potent series of TLR7 agonists.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Peter; Pryde, David C; Tran, Thien-Duc; Adam, Fiona M; Bish, Gerwyn; Calo, Frederick; Ciaramella, Guiseppe; Dixon, Rachel; Duckworth, Jonathan; Fox, David N A; Hay, Duncan A; Hitchin, James; Horscroft, Nigel; Howard, Martin; Laxton, Carl; Parkinson, Tanya; Parsons, Gemma; Proctor, Katie; Smith, Mya C; Smith, Nicholas; Thomas, Amy\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe discovery of a series of highly potent and novel TLR7 agonist interferon inducers is described.

Such a combination may offer important advantages over the current standard of care. Herein we describe the discovery and optimization of an indazole-based chemotype to provide a series of potent dual NK1 receptor antagonists/serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitors to overcome issues of ion channel blockade. This effort culminated in the identification of compound 9, an analogue that demonstrated favorable oral bioavailability, excellent brain uptake, and robust in vivo efficacy in a validated depression model. Over the course of this work, a novel heterocycle-directed asymmetric hydrogenation was developed to facilitate installation of the key stereogenic center.\n\nPotent, selective, orally bioavailable inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE): discovery of indole, benzofuran, imidazopyridine and pyrazolopyridine P1' substituents.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Zhonghui; Ott, Gregory R; Anand, Rajan; Liu, Rui-Qin; Covington, Maryanne B; Vaddi, Krishna; Qian, Mingxin; Newton, Robert C; Christ, David D; Trzaskos, James; Duan, James J-W\n\n2008-03-15\n\nPotent and selective inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) were discovered with several new heterocyclic P1' groups in conjunction with cyclic beta-amino hydroxamic acid scaffolds. Among them, the pyrazolopyridine provided the best overall profile when combined with tetrahydropyran beta-amino hydroxamic acid scaffold. Specifically, inhibitor 49 showed IC(50) value of 1 nM against porcine TACE and 170 nM in the suppression of LPS-induced TNF-alpha of human whole blood. Compound 49 also displayed excellent selectivity over a wide panel of MMPs as well as excellent oral bioavailability (F%>90%) in rat n-in-1 PK studies.\n\nCharacterization of Pharmacologic and Pharmacokinetic Properties of CCX168, a Potent and Selective Orally Administered Complement 5a Receptor Inhibitor, Based on Preclinical Evaluation and Randomized Phase 1 Clinical Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBekker, Pirow; Dairaghi, Daniel; Seitz, Lisa; Leleti, Manmohan; Wang, Yu; Ertl, Linda; Baumgart, Trageen; Shugarts, Sarah; Lohr, Lisa; Dang, Ton; Miao, Shichang; Zeng, Yibin; Fan, Pingchen; Zhang, Penglie; Johnson, Daniel; Powers, Jay; Jaen, Juan; Charo, Israel; Schall, Thomas J\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe complement 5a receptor has been an attractive therapeutic target for many autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. However, development of a selective and potent C5aR antagonist has been challenging. Here we describe the characterization of CCX168 (avacopan), an orally administered selective and potent C5aR inhibitor. CCX168 blocked the C5a binding, C5a-mediated migration, calcium mobilization, and CD11b upregulation in U937 cells as well as in freshly isolated human neutrophils. CCX168 retains high potency when present in human blood. A transgenic human C5aR knock-in mouse model allowed comparison of the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the molecule. CCX168 effectively blocked migration in in vitro and ex vivo chemotaxis assays, and it blocked the C5a-mediated neutrophil vascular endothelial margination. CCX168 was effective in migration and neutrophil margination assays in cynomolgus monkeys. This thorough in vitro and preclinical characterization enabled progression of CCX168 into the clinic and testing of its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles in a Phase 1 clinical trial in 48 healthy volunteers. CCX168 was shown to be well tolerated across a broad dose range (1 to 100 mg) and it showed dose-dependent pharmacokinetics. An oral dose of 30 mg CCX168 given twice daily blocked the C5a-induced upregulation of CD11b in circulating neutrophils by 94% or greater throughout the entire day, demonstrating essentially complete target coverage. This dose regimen is being tested in clinical trials in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.

These beta-lactam agents have been widely used in the outpatient arena for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract and other mild-to-moderate infections. The data presented here were obtained from critical review articles on each of these compounds. Cephalexin and cefaclor were among the least potent and had the narrowest antimicrobial spectrums against the pathogens evaluated. In contrast, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, and cefuroxime were highly active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and retained some activity against penicillin-intermediate strains, whereas amoxicillin/clavulanate was the most active against S. pneumoniae, including most penicillin nonsusceptible strains. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and cefdinir were the most potent compounds against methicillin (oxacillin)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, whereas cefpodoxime was the most potent compound against Haemophilus influenzae. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime were also active against Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. In summary, orally administered \"3rd-generation\" or extended spectrum cephalosporins exhibited more balanced spectrums of activity against the principal bacterial pathogens responsible for outpatient respiratory tract and other infections when compared with other widely used oral cephalosporins of earlier generations or amoxicillin alone.\n\nHigh-Throughput Screening To Identify Potent and Specific Inhibitors of Microbial Sulfate Reduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarlson, Hans K; Mullan, Mark R; Mosqueda, Lorraine A; Chen, Steven; Arkin, Michelle R; Coates, John D\n\n2017-06-20\n\nThe selective perturbation of complex microbial ecosystems to predictably influence outcomes in engineered and industrial environments remains a grand challenge for geomicrobiology. In some industrial ecosystems, such as oil reservoirs, sulfate reducing microorganisms (SRM) produce hydrogen sulfide which is toxic, explosive, and corrosive. Despite the economic cost of sulfidogenesis, there has been minimal exploration of the chemical space of possible inhibitory compounds, and very little work has quantitatively assessed the selectivity of putative souring treatments. We have developed a high-throughput screening strategy to identify potent and selective inhibitors of SRM, quantitatively ranked the selectivity and potency of hundreds of compounds and identified previously unrecognized SRM selective inhibitors and synergistic interactions between inhibitors. Zinc pyrithione is the most potent inhibitor of sulfidogenesis that we identified, and is several orders of magnitude more potent than commonly used industrial biocides. Both zinc and copper pyrithione are also moderately selective against SRM. The high-throughput (HT) approach we present can be readily adapted to target SRM in diverse environments and similar strategies could be used to quantify the potency and selectivity of inhibitors of a variety of microbial metabolisms. Our findings and approach are relevant to efforts to engineer environmental ecosystems and also to understand the role of natural gradients in shaping microbial niche space.\n\nPharmacological characterization of hydrolysis-resistant analogs of oleoylethanolamide with potent anorexiant properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nAstarita, Giuseppe; Di Giacomo, Barbara; Gaetani, Silvana; Oveisi, Fariba; Compton, Timothy R; Rivara, Silvia; Tarzia, Giorgio; Mor, Marco; Piomelli, Daniele\n\n2006-08-01\n\nOleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator that reduces food intake, promotes lipolysis, and decreases body weight gain in rodents by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). The biological effects of OEA are terminated by two intracellular lipid hydrolase enzymes, fatty-acid amide hydrolase and N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase. In the present study, we describe OEA analogs that resist enzymatic hydrolysis, activate PPAR-alpha with high potency in vitro, and persistently reduce feeding when administered in vivo either parenterally or orally. The most potent of these compounds, (Z)-(R)-9-octadecenamide,N-(2-hydroxyethyl,1-methyl) (KDS-5104), stimulates transcriptional activity of PPAR-alpha with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 100 +/- 21 nM (n = 11). Parenteral administration of KDS-5104 in rats produces persistent dose-dependent prolongation of feeding latency and postmeal interval (half-maximal effective dose, ED50 = 2.4 +/- 1.8 mg kg(-1) i.p.; n = 18), as well as increased and protracted tissue exposure compared with OEA. Oral administration of the compound also results in a significant tissue exposure and reduction of food intake in free-feeding rats. These results suggest that the endogenous high-affinity PPAR-alpha agonist OEA may provide a scaffold for the discovery of novel orally active PPAR-alpha ligands.\n\nNewly discovered orally active pure antiestrogens.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanbe, Yoshitake; Kim, Myung-Hwa; Nishimoto, Masahiro; Ohtake, Yoshihito; Yoneya, Takaaki; Ohizumi, Iwao; Tsunenari, Toshiaki; Taniguchi, Kenji; Kaiho, Shin-ichi; Nabuchi, Yoshiaki; Araya, Hiroshi; Kawata, Setsu; Morikawa, Kazumi; Jo, Jae-Chon; Kwon, Hee-An; Lim, Hyun-Suk; Kim, Hak-Yeop\n\n2006-09-15\n\nIn order to develop orally active pure antiestrogens, we incorporated the carboxy-containing side chains into the 7alpha-position of the steroid scaffold and found that 17-keto derivative CH4893237 (12b) functioned as a pure antiestrogen with its oral activity much superior to clinically used pure antiestrogen, ICI182,780.

The fibrinolytic activity of SOT was examined using in vitro assays and was compared with those of known fibrinolytic enzymes such as plasmin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), urokinase, and nattokinase. Compared to other enzymes, SOT showed remarkably higher hydrolytic activity toward mimic peptides of fibrin and plasminogen. The fibrinolytic activity of SOT is about 18-fold higher than that of plasmin, and is comparable to that of t-PA by fibrin plate assays. Furthermore, SOT had some plasminogen activator-like activity. Results show that SOT and nattokinase have very different fibrinolytic and fibrinogenolytic modes, engendering significant synergetic effects of SOT and nattokinase on fibrinolysis. These results suggest that SOT presents important possibilities for application in the therapy of thrombosis. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The most potent compounds exhibited K(i) values toward the D(3) receptor in the nano- to subnanomolar range and high selectivity versus the related D(2) dopamine receptor. Thus, 1H-pyridin-2-one 7b displays oral bioavailability (F=37%) as well as brain penetration (brain plasma ratio 3.7) in rat. Within the urea series, an excellent D(3) versus D(2) selectivity (>100-fold) could be achieved by removal of one NH group (compound 6), although bioavailability (rat) was suboptimal (F<10%). These data significantly enhance our understanding of the D(3) pharmacophore and are expected to lead to novel approaches for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\nHighly potent silver-organoalkoxysilane antimicrobial porous nanomembrane\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUmar, Sirajo; Liu, Yuanfeng; Wu, Yiguang; Li, Guangtao; Ding, Jiabo; Xiong, Runsong; Chen, Jinchun\n\n2013-04-01\n\nWe used a simple electrospinning technique to fabricate a highly potent silver-organoalkoxysilane antimicrobial composite from AgNO3-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)/tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) solution. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses of the composite showed that the fibers contain an organoalkoxysilane `skeleton,' 0.18 molecules/nm2 surface amino groups, and highly dispersed and uniformly distributed silver nanoparticles (5 nm in size). Incorporation of organoalkoxysilanes is highly beneficial to the antimicrobial mat as (1) amino groups of APTMS are adhesive and biocidal to microorganisms, (2) polycondensation of APTMS and TEOS increases the membrane's surface area by forming silicon bonds that stabilize fibers and form a composite mat with membranous structure and high porosity, and (3) the organoalkoxysilanes are also instrumental to the synthesis of the very small-sized and highly dispersed silver metal particles in the fiber mat. Antimicrobial property of the composite was evaluated by disk diffusion, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), kinetic, and extended use assays on bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Brucella suis), a fungus (Aspergillus niger), and the Newcastle disease virus. The membrane shows quick and sustained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Only 0.3 mg of fibers is required to achieve MIC against all the test organisms. Bacteria are inhibited within 30 min of contact, and the fibers can be used repeatedly. The composite is silver efficient and environment friendly, and its membranous structure is suitable for many practical applications as in air filters, antimicrobial linen, coatings, bioadhesives, and biofilms.\n\nBiological properties of potent inhibitors of class I phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases: from PI-103 through PI-540, PI-620 to the oral agent GDC-0941.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaynaud, Florence I; Eccles, Suzanne A; Patel, Sonal; Alix, Sonia; Box, Gary; Chuckowree, Irina; Folkes, Adrian; Gowan, Sharon; De Haven Brandon, Alexis; Di Stefano, Francesca; Hayes, Angela; Henley, Alan T; Lensun, Letitia; Pergl-Wilson, Giles; Robson, Anthony; Saghir, Nahid; Zhyvoloup, Alexander; McDonald, Edward; Sheldrake, Peter; Shuttleworth, Stephen; Valenti, Melanie; Wan, Nan Chi; Clarke, Paul A; Workman, Paul\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThe phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers and inhibitors offer considerable therapeutic potential. We previously described the promising tricyclic pyridofuropyrimidine lead and chemical tool compound PI-103. We now report the properties of the pharmaceutically optimized bicyclic thienopyrimidine derivatives PI-540 and PI-620 and the resulting clinical development candidate GDC-0941. All four compounds inhibited phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase p110alpha with IC(50) < or = 10 nmol/L. Despite some differences in isoform selectivity, these agents exhibited similar in vitro antiproliferative properties to PI-103 in a panel of human cancer cell lines, with submicromolar potency in PTEN-negative U87MG human glioblastoma cells and comparable phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway modulation. PI-540 and PI-620 exhibited improvements in solubility and metabolism with high tissue distribution in mice. Both compounds gave improved antitumor efficacy over PI-103, following i.p. dosing in U87MG glioblastoma tumor xenografts in athymic mice, with treated/control values of 34% (66% inhibition) and 27% (73% inhibition) for PI-540 (50 mg/kg b.i.d.) and PI-620 (25 mg/kg b.i.d.), respectively. GDC-0941 showed comparable in vitro antitumor activity to PI-103, PI-540, and PI-620 and exhibited 78% oral bioavailability in mice, with tumor exposure above 50% antiproliferative concentrations for >8 hours following 150 mg/kg p.o. and sustained phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway inhibition. These properties led to excellent dose-dependent oral antitumor activity, with daily p.o. dosing at 150 mg/kg achieving 98% and 80% growth inhibition of U87MG glioblastoma and IGROV-1 ovarian cancer xenografts, respectively. Together, these data support the development of GDC-0941 as a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase. GDC-0941 has recently entered phase I clinical trials.\n\nBiological properties of potent inhibitors of class I phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases: from PI-103 through PI-540, PI-620 to the oral agent GDC-0941\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRaynaud, Florence I.; Eccles, Suzanne A.; Patel, Sonal; Alix, Sonia; Box, Gary; Chuckowree, Irina; Folkes, Adrian; Gowan, Sharon; De Haven Brandon, Alexis; Di Stefano, Francesca; Hayes, Angela; Henley, Alan T.; Lensun, Letitia; Pergl-Wilson, Giles; Robson, Anthony; Saghir, Nahid; Zhyvoloup, Alexander; McDonald, Edward; Sheldrake, Peter; Shuttleworth, Stephen; Valenti, Melanie; Wan, Nan Chi; Clarke, Paul A.; Workman, Paul\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers and inhibitors offer considerable therapeutic potential. We previously described the promising tricyclic pyridofuropyrimidine lead and chemical tool compound PI-103. We now report the properties of the pharmaceutically optimized bicyclic thienopyrimidine derivatives PI-540 and PI-620 and the resulting clinical development candidate GDC-0941. All four compounds inhibited phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase p110Î± with IC50 â¤ 10 nmol/L. Despite some differences in isoform selectivity, these agents exhibited similar in vitro antiproliferative properties to PI-103 in a panel of human cancer cell lines, with submicromolar potency in PTEN-negative U87MG human glioblastoma cells and comparable phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway modulation. PI-540 and PI-620 exhibited improvements in solubility and metabolism with high tissue distribution in mice. Both compounds gave improved antitumor efficacy over PI-103, following i.p. dosing in U87MG glioblastoma tumor xenografts in athymic mice, with treated/control values of 34% (66% inhibition) and 27% (73% inhibition) for PI-540 (50 mg/kg b.i.d.) and PI-620 (25 mg/kg b.i.d.), respectively. GDC-0941 showed comparable in vitro antitumor activity to PI-103, PI-540, and PI-620 and exhibited 78% oral bioavailability in mice, with tumor exposure above 50% anti-proliferative concentrations for >8 hours following 150 mg/kg p.o. and sustained phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase pathway inhibition. These properties led to excellent dose-dependent oral antitumor activity, with daily p.o. dosing at 150 mg/kg achieving 98% and 80% growth inhibition of U87MG glioblastoma and IGROV-1 ovarian cancer xenografts, respectively.

K.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn the last few years, the interest for oral cytology as a diagnostic and prognostic methodology, for monitoring patients in oral potentially malignant disorders and oral cancer has re-emerged substantially. In 1983, buccal mucosal micronuclei assay was first proposed to evaluate genetic instability. There are biomarkers that predict if a potentially malignant disorder is likely to develop into an aggressive tumor. These genotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals have been reported to be potent clastogenic and mutagenic agents which are thought to be responsible for the induction of chromatid/chromosomal aberrations resulting in the production of micronuclei. Various studies have concluded that the gradual increase in micronucleus (MN) counts from normal oral mucosa to potentially malignant disorders to oral carcinoma suggested a link of this biomarker with neoplastic progression. MN scoring can be used as a biomarker to identify different preneoplastic conditions much earlier than the manifestations of clinical features and might specifically be exploited in the screening of high-risk population for a specific cancer. Hence, it can be used as a screening prognostic and educational tool in community centers of oral cancer.

In this paper we describe an extensive structure-activity relationship study of this class of MDM2 inhibitors, which led to the discovery of 60 (AA-115/APG-115). Compound 60 has a very high affinity to MDM2 (K i < 1 nM), potent cellular activity, and an excellent oral pharmacokinetic profile. Compound 60 is capable of achieving complete and long-lasting tumor regression in vivo and is currently in phase I clinical trials for cancer treatment.\n\nFlavonoids of Cynara scolymus possess potent xanthinoxidase inhibitory activity in vitro but are devoid of hypouricemic effects in rats after oral application.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarawek, Sasiporn; Feistel, Bjoern; Pischel, Ivo; Butterweck, Veronika\n\n2008-02-01\n\nArtichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) leaves have been historically used for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout, however whether artichoke is truly efficacious for this indication, is still a matter of debate. Thus, the goal of the present study was first to examine the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity of an artichoke leaf extract (ALE) and some of its main compounds in vitro and then further test potentially active substances for possible hypouricemic effects using an in vivo rat model. The in vitro study showed that ALE inhibited XO with only minimal inhibitory action (< 5 %) at 100 microg/mL. However, when selected compounds were tested, the caffeic acid derivatives revealed a weak XO inhibitory effect with IC (50) > 100 microM. From the tested flavones the aglycone luteolin potently inhibited XO with an IC (50) value of 1.49 microM. Luteolin 7-O-glucoside and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide showed lower XO inhibition activities with IC (50) values of 19.90 microM and 20.24 microM, respectively. However, oral administration of an aqueous ALE, luteolin, and luteolin 7-O-glucoside did not produce any observable hypouricemic effects after acute oral treatment in potassium oxonate-treated rats. After intraperitoneal injection of luteolin a decrease in uric acid levels was detected suggesting that the hypouricemic effects of luteolin are due to its original form rather than its metabolites produced by the gut flora. In conclusion, an aqueous ALE, caffeic acid derivatives and flavones exerted XO inhibitory effects in vitro but a hypouricemic activity could not be confirmed after oral administration.\n\nNovel tetracyclic benzo[b]carbazolones as highly potent and orally bioavailable ALK inhibitors: design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship study.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Xiaolong; Zhou, Ji; Ai, Jing; Song, Zilan; Peng, Xia; Xing, Li; Xi, Yong; Guo, Junfeng; Yao, Qizheng; Ding, Jian; Geng, Meiyu; Zhang, Ao\n\n2015-11-13\n\nFour series of tetracyclic benzo[b]carbazolone compounds possessing more rotatable bonds and higher molecular flexibility were designed by either inserting a linker within the C8-side chain or by opening the middle ketone ring on the basis of compound 5 (Alectinib, CH5424802). Compound 15b was identified showing nearly identical high potency against both wild-type and the gatekeeper mutant ALK kinase (3.4 vs 3.9Â nM). This compound has favorable PK profile with an oral bioavailability of 67.1% in rats. Moreover, compound 15b showed significant growth inhibition against ALK driven cancer cells and KARPAS-299 xenograft model. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Lead compounds have 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) values in vitro that are in the subnanomolar range and selectivity index values that exceed 1 million. They have an absolute requirement for VZV thymidine kinase and most likely act as their phosphate forms. Some structural modification (such as aryl substitution in the base moiety) is tolerated, whereas little sugar modification is acceptable. The Cf1743 compound has proved to be significantly more potent than all reference anti-VZV compounds, as measured either by inhibition of infectious virus particles and/or viral DNA production; however, the high lipophilicity and very low water solubility of this compound gives poor oral bioavailability (<14%). Use of the modified cyclodextrin captisol and the synthesis of the 5'-monophosphate prodrug of Cf1743 has significantly improved water solubility, but does not give any enhancement in oral bioavailability. By contrast, the synthesis of the ether series does not give any further improvement in terms of solubility. The most promising prodrug to emerge to date is the hydrochloric salt of the 5'-valyl-ester, designated as FV-100. Its uptake into cells has been studied using fluorescent microscopy and biological assays, which have indicated that the compound is efficiently taken up by the cells after a short period of incubation.\n\nComparing the efficacy of hyper-pure chlorine-dioxide with other oral antiseptics on oral pathogen microorganisms and biofilm in vitro.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerczegh, Anna; Gyurkovics, MilÃ¡n; Agababyan, Hayk; GhidÃ¡n, Agoston; Lohinai, Zsolt\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThis study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), ListerineÂ®, and high purity chlorine dioxide (Solumium, ClO2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro.
