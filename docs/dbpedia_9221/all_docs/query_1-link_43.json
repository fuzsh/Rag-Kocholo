        "text": "Prior to Texas Football hitting the field for the annual Orange-White Game (presented by Texas One Fund) on April 20, Texas Country pioneers Reckless Kelly will headline Longhorn City Limits presented by Still Austin Whiskey. The FREE gameday concert series, located on the LBJ Lawn, will feature live music starting at 10 a.m. by Austin’s own Sentimental Family Band.\n\nFrom its roots as a barnstorming Idaho outfit to its modern-day status as a torchbearer for Americana music worldwide, GRAMMY-winning Reckless Kelly is celebrating nearly three decades with the launch of The Last Frontier Tour and an album of the same name out later this year. The band will preview a few of the new songs along with fan favorites in what promises to be a rocking Longhorn City Limits party.\n\n\"We are really looking forward to kicking off the Football Orange-White Game with the fans,” said Cody Braun. “Hook 'em Horns!\"\n\n“We are so excited to welcome Reckless Kelly back to the Forty Acres,” said Chris Del Conte, Vice President and Folger Family Athletics Director. “Willy and Cody have long been supporters of our program, and we can’t wait for them to entertain Longhorn Nation on the LBJ Lawn before the Spring Game”\n\nJoining Reckless Kelly on the LCL lineup is the Sentimental Family Band. Named KUTX’s Artist of the Month this past March, the band is comprised of songwriters Camille Lewis, Kyle Albrecht, and Matthew Shepherd. Fusing Bakersfield honky-tonk with western swing, they released their debut album Sweethearts Only in March 2024 featuring singles including “Face to a Name”, “Talking to Strangers”, and “Never Love Again”.\n\nSentimental Family Band will take the LCL stage at 10 a.m. followed by Reckless Kelly at approximately 11:30 a.m.\n\nFans ages 21 and up can enjoy signature experiences at Longhorn City Limits including the Still Austin Music Lounge. Serving up a full menu of refreshments including the Still Austin Horns Up Bourbon Lemonade on ice, the lounge provides relaxation in a shaded area while enjoying the show. Fans won't want to miss surprises and limited-edition swag curated by Still Austin Whiskey Co, the homegrown grain-to-glass craft distillery using 100% Texas grains.\n\nAlso returning for the Orange-White Game is the Tito’s Tailgate located in front of the LBJ Fountain featuring refreshing Tito’s cocktails on tap and shaded views of the stage to tailgate in real Texas fashion.\n\nConcert goers can also enjoy Stubb’s BBQ and pregame happy hour pricing featuring select $5 domestic and $6.50 premium beers at Longhorn City Limits.\n\nAbout Reckless Kelly:\n\nAmericana/Red-Dirt band Reckless Kelly has been burning up stages with their high-energy blend of rock and country music since 1996. Fronted by central Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun, the brothers are part of a rich musical legacy that spans three generations. Twenty-five years ago, Willy and Cody moved to Austin, TX, added drummer Jay Nazz to their core, and formed a band that would change Texas's musical history. An indispensable part of the Texas music scene for almost 3 decades, the GRAMMY Award-winning band has released 17 albums, they have been named the Outlaw Group of the Year in the 2024 Ameripolitan Awards.\n\nReckless Kelly has built their annual festival, The Braun Brothers Reunion, into a three-day event held in Challis, Idaho, celebrating 40 years in 2024. The band will kick off the first leg of their 2024 - 2025 The Last Frontier Tour in April. The members are Willy and Cody Braun, drummer Nazz, Joe Miller on bass, and Geoffrey Queen on lead guitar. www.recklesskelly.com EPK"
