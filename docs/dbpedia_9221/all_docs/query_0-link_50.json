        "meta_description": "From the minute Cory Morrow pulled Drew up to play in front of a sold out crowd at the legendary Gruene Hall, Drew knew he was born to play music. Drew's early piano training and devotion to song writing have contributed to his perfect musical storm. Soon after Grammy Award winner Lloyd Maines and Texas Country staple Cory Morrow encouraged Drew to put a band together, the newly formed Drew Fish Band was shaking the Blind Pig Pub and Hill's Cafe.",

        "text": "Texans are chauvinistic about their state because there is no place in the world that can hold a candle. Texas is friendly, self-reliant people, amazing beauty, and unique experiences. Drew's music captures the essence of Texas -- floating down the Guadalupe River at Gruene, watching the surf roll in at Port Aransas, listening to the rhythm of a windmill in Lubbock, or eating a fried Twinkie at the State Fair with a girl who probably has the skills to win her own bear on the midway. You have to spend time in Texas to understand that a beautiful Texas girl you bring home to Momma is likely able to out-shoot and out-drink Daddy and out-sass and out-love Momma. Ok, you caught me. Nobody out-loves Momma.\n\nWith the musical influences of his friends, Cory Morrow, Reckless Kelly, and Thom Shepherd and the encouragement of Grammy-Award-winning producer and musician Lloyd Maines, Drew has honed his songs into a musical expression of Texas culture.\n\nThe Drew Fish Band's irrepressible hit Irresponsible performed by co-author, Curtis Grimes, climbed to number 5 on the Texas Music Charts and the Texas Regional Radio Report. The band is aiming for the number one spot on the charts with their newest single, Playin' with a Flame.\n\nDFB's debut EP, Playin' with a Flame, features talent who have cumulatively raked in 15 Grammy Awards. Produced by five-time-Grammy-Award-winning production genius Adam Odor, the EP includes appearances by five-time-Grammy-Award-winner Cindy Cashdollar on steel guitar and dobro, two-time-Grammy-Award-winner Jason Roberts on fiddle, Cody Braun of Reckless Kelly singing harmonies and Scott Davis of the Band of Heathens, formerly Hayes Carll, on banjo, accordion, and mandolin. Grammy Award winners Sarah and Shauna Dodds designed the album artwork.\n\nThe EP is loaded with songs that chronicle a life of love, accomplishment, happiness, and pain. Written by DFB's drummer, Andrew Estrello, Small Price to Pay is a fun, up-beat expression that money isn't as important as relationships. Drew wrote Baby Just Let Go about a girl too caught up in the pressures of life to appreciate the wonder every day brings. After playing a show in Kerrville, Drew and Bennett Brown (Shane Smith and the Saints) arrived back at Bennett's place and realized that after hotel, gas, food, and drink tabs, they had spent more money on the show than they had actually made. They funneled their frustration into writing Poor. They take the credit, but that song really wrote itself. Drew and Gary Wilder, bass player for the Drew Fish Band, mixed the historically-accurate story of Gary's legendary ancestor Wild Bill Hickock with music and Lone Star beer to come up with the title track, Playin' with a Flame. You might get burned if you're playin' with a flame is a foundational message in country musicâ€”covering the unpredictable nature of love, sex, alcohol, gun-fighting, and choosing a career in music.\n\nWhether it's the generation above him two stepping to Show Me Tonight or the younger generation ready for the next Three Day Weekend, audiences of all ages identify with the candid, insightful, sometimes rowdy songs of the Drew Fish Band.\n\nArmed with the wisdom and advice of radio personalities, Drew teamed up with Tami Millspaugh to push Sounds Like A Plan to radio. It has grabbed the attention of audiences and radio stations across the state. The DFB is reeling with gratitude to all of you for your support -- hook, line, and sinker."
