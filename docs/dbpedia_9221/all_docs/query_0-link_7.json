        "text": "Americana, Red-Dirt Band Reckless Kelly has been burning up stages with their high-energy blend of rock and country music since 1996. Fronted by central Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun, the brothers are part of a rich musical legacy that began with their grandfather and continued with their father and uncle’s band The Braun Brothers. Reckless Kelly has played over 3,000 shows and traveled over 1,500,000 miles to 49 states. Reckless Kelly will be kicking off the first leg of their 2024 – 2025, The Last Frontier Tour in April. The band is made up of the brothers, drummer Nazz, Joe Miller on bass, and Geoffrey Queen on lead guitar. This show will be one of their last shows for the foreseeable future. Reckless Kelly will also be celebrating the 40th Anniversary of their festival, The Braun Brothers Reunion, which takes place each summer in August in Idaho."
