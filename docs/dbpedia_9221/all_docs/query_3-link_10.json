        "text": "Cody and Willy Braun of Reckless Kelly grew up in the White Cloud Mountains of Idaho before migrating to the great musical fountainhead of Austin, Texas. The two first toured the country as part of their father’s band, Muzzie Braun and the Boys. Muzzie taught his sons a professional ethic of integrity, persistence, hard work and professionalism. The boys overcame hardships, struggled for recognition, and learned the lessons of the trial and error that defined them. It’s only natural then that their own band, Reckless Kelly, became the very essence of Americana music. For two decades, Reckless Kelly has toured coast to coast relentlessly. Their following grows, and with an audience that truly wants to hear the lyrics and appreciate the musicianship in their arrangements, the band has moved on to play in performing arts centers and listening rooms that provide more focused and intimate encounters. The group’s new album Sunset Motel is, like all its predecessors, a reflection of Reckless Kelly’s attention to craft and continuity. Their fierce self-reliance and independent spirit keeps Reckless Kelly happy, appreciative and charitable. Fans of The MusicFest also enjoy their annual festival, The Braun Brothers Reunion (where they reunite with their brothers, Gary and Micky of the Motorcars) in Challis, Idaho each year. Cheers to this classic Big Tent gathering at MusicFest each January!"
