This historic collaboration promises an unforgettable experience for fans, as Reckless Kelly will not only be delivering their own dynamic set but will also serve as Steve Earle's backing band throughout four dates.\n\nReckless Kelly's seamless blend of rock and country, coupled with Steve Earle's timeless storytelling and raw energy, promises an unparalleled musical experience. With Reckless Kelly doubling up as Steve Earle's backing band, fans can anticipate an incredible, electric show.\n\n“If there was a sonic blueprint for Reckless Kelly, Steve Earle would have been one of the principal architects. It’s hard to imagine what we might sound like without the influence of his style and songwriting. We’re beyond excited to be his band and to get to play songs like “Guitar Town” and “Copperhead Road” with the captain on deck. These shows are going to be incredible,” muses Willy Braun.\n\nSteve Earle adds, \"I've kind of watched these guys grow up. They started young, and they got good, fast! If, after thousands of shows and hundreds of thousands of miles, this is, indeed, the end of the trail, I want to be there.\" Tickets for these highly anticipated shows are expected to sell out quickly. Don't miss your chance to witness this historic collaboration between two powerhouse acts in Americana music.\n\nFor ticket information and to stay updated on Reckless Kelly and Steve Earle's tour dates, visit www.RecklessKelly.com.\n\nReckless Kelly with Steve Earle Tour Dates:\n\nJune 22, 2024 - Maryville, TN - The Shed\n\nJune 29, 2024 - New Braunfels, TX - Whitewater Amphitheatre\n\nAugust 3, 2024 - Denver, CO - Mission Ballroom\n\nAugust 10, 2024 - Challis, ID - Braun Brothers Reunion\n\nAbout Reckless Kelly:\n\nAmericana, Red-Dirt Band Reckless Kelly has been burning up stages with their high-energy blend of rock and country music since 1996. Fronted by central Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun, the brothers are part of a rich musical legacy that spans three generations. Twenty-five years ago, Willy and Cody moved to Austin, TX, added drummer Jay Nazz to their core, and formed a band that would change Texas's musical history. An indispensable part of the Texas music scene for almost three decades, Reckless Kelly has released 16 albums, toured internationally, and built the annual Braun Brothers Reunion festival into a three-day event held in Challis, Idaho, that is celebrating 40 years in 2024. Reckless Kelly has kicked off the first leg of their 2024 - 2025, The Last Frontier Tour. The band comprises the brothers, drummer Nazz, Joe Miller on bass, and Geoff Queen on lead guitar and pedal steel.\n\nAbout Steve Earle:\n\nSteve Earle is one of the most acclaimed singer-songwriters of his generation. A protege of legendary songwriters Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, he quickly became a master storyteller in his own right, with his songs being recorded by Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Joan Baez, Emmylou Harris, The Pretenders, and countless others. 1986 saw the release of his debut record, Guitar Town, which shot to No. 1 on the Country Charts and is now regarded as a classic of the Americana genre. Subsequent releases like The Revolution Starts...Now (2004), Washington Square Serenade (2007), and TOWNES (2009) received consecutive GRAMMY® Awards. Restlessly creative across artistic disciplines, Earle has published both a novel and a collection of short stories; produced albums for other artists such as Joan Baez and Lucinda Williams, and acted in films, television (including David Simon’s acclaimed The Wire), and on the stage. He currently hosts a radio show for Sirius XM.\n\nIn 2009, Earle appeared in the off-Broadway play Samara, for which he also wrote a score that The New York Times described as “exquisitely subliminal.” Earle wrote music for and appeared in Coal Country, a riveting public theater play that dives into the most- deadly mining disaster in U.S. history, for which he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award (running through April 17 at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York City). His 2020 album Ghosts of West Virginia was named as one of “The 50 Best Albums of 2020 So Far” by Rolling Stone. Mr. Earle was recently (Nov. 2020) inducted into the NashvilleSongwriters Hall of Fame, and released his 21st studio album J.T. in January 2021 as an homage to his late son Justin Townes Earle. Now, Earle is saddling up for the release of his most recent album Jerry Jeff, a 10-track collection comprised of hit tracks and deep-cuts from Jerry Jeff Walker to pay tribute to the colorful cowboy troubadour who passed away in October 2020."
