I think so many people don't pay enough respect to the artists that have been around for so long giving us all these great memories year after year because everyone is too caught up in finding the newest artists out there....but the feelings you get at the BBR seeing so many people truly enjoy themselves is something that can not be duplicated or easily explained. It makes my soul happy to experience it year after year. Thanks to everyone involved in making it all come together and to Reckless Kelly for playing all the great songs that make us feel lucky to listen!\n\nChallis, ID@\n\nChallis Golf Course\n\nChris\n\nMay 13th 2024\n\nWhat a great show! So many songs I was hoping to hear were played and well received by the mainly older crowd. They played an hour with one encore but I believe that was because of the late start and the Thirsty Cowboy seemingly being more interested in letting the youngsters in attendance get back to their line dancing. I did notice that the venue didn't even turn off their wall TVs during the show. Other than that, the venue was large, great line of sight, clean, big bathroom and cheap drinks. I'd make the 3.5 hour trip to see another show there.\n\nMedina, OH@\n\nThirsty Cowboys\n\nBryan\n\nMay 13th 2024\n\nAwesome as ever. Hard to believe this is the last tour. Their sound and the live show is unmatchable. The Braun brothers' performance is far above most shows. The band is equally as good, perfect recipe for some of the best stories told through music.\n\nMedina, OH@\n\nThirsty Cowboys\n\nLori P\n\nApril 8th 2024\n\nThis show was awesome! My first time seeing them and I can't wait to see them again. If you've never been to Post OG, you are missing a great musical venue. The clarity of the sound in the space is better than Gruene Hall or JT Floores in my opinion and alot closer. The beer was cold and the food offerings decent. You can't go wrong, hope to see Reckless Kelly and Hill Country Revival there again. *** note to self*** Ubers are not available! It's l.o.n..g walk to 77!\n\nOrange Grove Villa Colonia, TX@\n\nThe Post OG\n\nKelly\n\nSeptember 17th 2023\n\nBest show ever! First at the Ryman, then three legendary performers combined with amazing sound, and the triple tribute at the end. You DO NOT get better than Reckless, Boland, and Moonpies! True music in a time that has diluted the art.\n\nNashville, TN@\n\nRyman Auditorium\n\nJenaro Avalos\n\nAugust 20th 2023\n\nLoved the show. This was the first time to RK and was absolutely the best. The venue was great as we could see the bands from almost anywhere. Was great to see the 4 brothers play and sing together at the same time. The bonus was that this was a show that was being recorded for audio and video for a future release. Thanks.\n\nPampa, TX@\n\nPampa Fest\n\nJenaro Avalos\n\nAugust 19th 2023\n\nFirst time to see RK and at Stubb's. I can say even though it was a hot August night, it was a great show and loved the special guests that showed up. Turns out the band was recording film and music for a live CD that will be coming up! Glad we made the trip and was part of history for RK.\n\nAustin, TX@\n\nStubb's Waller Creek Amphitheater\n\nChris\n\nMay 24th 2022\n\nThe music was great!! Good outdoor area...BUT. Stood in line for bathrooms for over 30 mins., Food line for 45 mins, they ran out of fries and the lines for alcohol were 30-40 mins also. They didn't have wine except for fizzy or canned shit and then ran out of that. Better planning next time.\n\nBoise, ID@\n\nHayden Beverage Co\n\njoe\n\nApril 25th 2022\n\nWillie, Cody and the RK boys rocked the place as usual. Have seen them in locations across the country and have never been disappointed in one of their shows. With a great mix of new songs and old favorites you can always count on a great evening. Stargazers Theater is a cool, unique venue for a show. Great to have a place like it in C Springs for live music.\n\nColorado Springs, CO@\n\nStargazers Theatre & Event Center\n\nGeorge\n\nApril 14th 2020\n\nI was 14 days removed from major surgery, but was moving faster than a locomotive. Arrived when the doors opened and got a seat right up by the stage. When you coming back. ( And when you gonna meet with the fans again, like you did the first time I saw you at the Birchmere in Alexandria, Va. in June 2017?) George putney303@gmail.com\n\nNorth Bethesda, MD@\n\nAMP by Strathmore\n\nDamian\n\nFebruary 21st 2020\n\n12th time to see them, first time not on the front row. They’re just as good from the second row though. Caught a harmonica from Willy. Met Ryan after the show. Won like, $2 at the casino afterwards. Another fantastic set. The boys are in their prime, we’ll see em one more time.\n\nDurant, OK@\n\nChoctaw Casino & Resort\n\nMelissa\n\nJanuary 5th 2020\n\nI’ve never once Ben disappointed with a RK show! Would LOVE to see them back at this venue! I am from Teutopolis Illinois, so the venues I visit most frequent are here at Off Broadway, and Boondocks in Springfield. We would love to have them back ❤️\n\nSt Louis, MO@\n\nOff Broadway\n\nTracy\n\nNovember 8th 2018\n\nAmazing concert, again! Very clean and well lit venue from safety perspective for those going alone. New twists on some RK classics, plus bonus of David abeyta singing solo, and fantastic covers of some great songs! Well worth seeing always. Glad they make the trip to the southeast twice a year!\n\nWinston-Salem, NC@\n\nThe Ramkat\n\nScott\n\nOctober 27th 2018\n\nGreat show! Being in Chicago I only get to see these guys two maybe three times a year. At every show they mix up the set list always making sure that they pull a song or two from their first few albums that we don’t get to hear too often which is awesome. I brought a few friends last night who thought they were going to see another bar band, I assured them that was not the case, they were blown away to see a professional band.\n\nBerwyn, IL@\n\nFitzGerald's\n\nMark\n\nJuly 27th 2018\n\nFive star show by one of the best bands around. RK is a super talented group of musicians led by an extraordinary writer in Willie Braun. This was my fourth RK show and they always meet and exceed expectations.\n\nSan Francisco, CA@\n\nGreat American Music Hall\n\nKathy\n\nJune 9th 2018\n\nNot 4-1/2 stars....5 STARS!! Amazing band that we’ve seen in concert numerous times. Last nights concert was great and the fans were undeniable. Need them back in the area soon!! RK fans for 15 yrs. and have never been disappointed in any of their concerts!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nHickory, NC@\n\nMusic in the Mill\n\nDavid\n\nOctober 15th 2017\n\n2/3rds- run of the mill, just ok, 3 Min and out. Album like. Kind of Boring and that’s hard for me to say cause I love these guys. From Crazy Eddie on, it was like I expected....GREAT. Maybe they play too many gigs. Don’t know but mailed it in first 2/3rds. Saw them at Birchmere earlier in year for first time and was ALL IN. Questioning that now. When they wanna be, THEY ARE CRAZY GOOD LIVE. Can’t pick 5 out of 20 songs to be great guys. Been to over 110 Bruce shows. Never ever saw him show up for last 5 songs. You’re better than that Willie et al. Still love you though. Tough love MF’ers. 🤘🏻\n\nWashington, DC@\n\nThe Hamilton\n\nFord\n\nJuly 21st 2017\n\nReckless always brings it. The band is tight, the musicianship is flawless and the WHOLE TOWN went on the emotional ride, from Ragged as the Toad through Life by Night Moon to Crazy Eddie, and ended with a Petty tribute. Well done!!!!\n\nLander, WY@\n\nJayCee Park Stage\n\nLogan\n\nSeptember 12th 2016\n\nAwesome show! Great venue. Wish there was a wider food selection would be the only thing that would have put it over the top. Came out from WA state to see this and was well worth it! Love Reckless Kelly!\n\nNashville, TN@\n\nCity Winery\n\nuser7739407\n\nNovember 22nd 2013\n\nBest Reckless show I've ever been to! got to meet Cody after the show and what a great guy! the Braun brothers are salt of the earth and I will be going to every show they play in Denver and nearby. thanks Braun brothers!!!\n\nDenver, CO@\n\nGrizzly Rose\n\nView More Fan Reviews"
