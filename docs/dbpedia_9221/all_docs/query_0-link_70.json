        "text": "This weekend, The Rock presents JEFF CROSBY & THE REFUGEES! Born and raised in Idaho, Jeff Crosby has been sharing his unique perspective of Americana throughout the U.S. and Europe for the past decade. After moving to Los Angeles in 2012, Crosby landed two songs (\"This Old Town\" and \"Oh Love Oh Lord\") on the hit FX series Sons of Anarchy, which led to the band playing an assortment of clubs, festivals, and biker rallies throughout the country, performing more than 200 shows a year for the next five years.\n\nCrosby then spent 2015-2016 playing guitar for Widespread Panic songwriter Jerry Joseph as well as for the Austin, TX, band Reckless Kelly in 2019. He also has co-written songs featured on Austin, TX, band Micky & The Motorcars' recent release \"Long Time Comin’\" and Reckless Kelly’s \"American Girls/American Jackpot\".\n\nAfter spending three years based in Nashville, TN, Crosby has now returned to Idaho and is touring with his band full time in support of his most recent release Northstar (April 2020) and the current single “Runnin’ Free” (May 2021) featuring Cody Braun (Reckless Kelly) and produced and engineered by Gregg Williams and Jonathan Tyler.\n\nSinger/songwriter Andrew Wescombe to open.\n\nDoors open by 8 p.m., music at 9 p.m.\n\n***\n\nO.P.

General Admission tickets are standing-room-only for the dance floor. Reservations are highly recommended for GA tables on the dance floor and VIP tables on the Mezzanine. For large parties, or to partially or fully buy out the Music Hall (downstairs) or Rockwell Listening Room (ground floor) for weddings, birthdays, or reunions, visit https://oprockwell.com/private-events.\n\nFAQ:\n\nIs there food available? Yes! You can pre-order a charcuterie board, already packed up and ready for you to bring downstairs with you into the Music Hall.

Rockwell, on the ground floor. Food from PCDC is the only food allowed into the performance venue.\n\nWhere is the show venue located? O.P. Rockwell Cocktail Lounge & Music Hall is located downstairs in the subterranean \"speakeasy\" level\" of The Rock Building at 268 Main Street in Park City, UT.

Rockwell Cocktail Lounge & Music Hall is a BAR, therefore everyone attending must be 21-and-over. All guests must present a valid ID at the door.\n\nWill tickets be available at the door?
