        "text": "Austin, TX-based Americana band Reckless Kelly releases it's eleventh and twelfth full length albums at the same time in one combined packaging, American Jackpot and American Girls.\n\nAlthough Reckless Kelly initially intended to make just one album, the project took on a life of its own once they headed into the studio. “I wanted to produce this one by myself, just to try that out, and I made sure to book plenty of studio time to get it done right,” says Willy. “We ended up mov-ing along really fast, so I pulled out a few more songs and figured we’d end up using them down the road. Before we knew it, we had enough material for two really good records.” The follow-up to their acclaimed 2016 album Sunset Motel, American Jackpot and American Girls em-body a wonderfully eclectic sonic palette, achieved with the help of V.I.P. guest musicians like Gary Clark Jr. and Charlie Sexton, along with several members of their own legendary family (including Uncle Gary Braun on chromatic harmonica and their father Muzzie Braun on lead and harmony vocals). Recorded at Arlyn Studios in their adopted hometown of Austin, both albums abound with an unbridled vitality—an element that has much to do with the band’s deliberate decision to keep pre-production to a minimum in order to harness the magic of in-studio spontaneity. “There’s something incredible about the first time you play a song really well together, and we don’t ever want to waste that take on the rehearsal room,” Willy notes.\n\nWith the release of American Jackpot and American Girls, Reckless Kelly hopes to lead listeners to thoughtful reflection on their own experience of living in America, and possibly invite a certain pur-poseful nostalgia. Mostly I just hope these songs remind them of all the different aspects of grow-ing up in America, and feeling so lucky to live here,” says Willy Braun.\n\nAlbum Complete With:\n\nIllustration booklet\n\nWilly Braun's written description of each song.\n\nAmerican Girls\n\nI Only See You With My Eyes Closed\n\nAmerican Girls\n\nAll Over Again (Break Up Blues)\n\nMiss Marissa\n\nLonesome On My Own\n\nAnyplace That’s Wild\n\nLost Inside The Groove\n\nNo Dancing In Bristol\n\nDon’t Give Up On Love\n\nMy Home Is Where Your Heart Is\n\nAmerican Jackpot\n\nNorth American Jackpot\n\nThinkin’ ‘Bout You All Night\n\nTom Was A Friend Of Mine\n\n42\n\nMona\n\nAnother New Year’s Day\n\nGrandpa Was A Jack Of All Trades\n\nPut On Your Brave Face Mary\n\nCompany Of Kings\n\nGoodbye Colorado\n\n**Due to production constraints because of COVID-19, any pre-orders that include a CD or Vinyl will not be shipped until mid- to late-July.
