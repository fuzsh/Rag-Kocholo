        "meta_description": "Live theatrical performances have long been a centerpiece of Park City's culture. In the late 1800's, the ornate Park City Opera House was located near our current site. On a warm June night in 1898, fire roared downhill from the American Hotel and quickly consumed most of the town, including the Opera House. In a Determined effort to restore live theatre to the town, the Dewey Theatre soon opened its doors in 1899 on the site of what is now the Egyptian Theatre. The Dewey remained a popular cultural center until its roof collapsed under a record-breaking snowload in 1916.",
