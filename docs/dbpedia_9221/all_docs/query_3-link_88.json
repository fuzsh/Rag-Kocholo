        "text": "With a name inspired by the infamous Australian bank robber and a home base of Austin, Texas, Reckless Kelly more than lives up to the implications of the moniker and the hometown. Led by brothers Willy and Cody Braun, Reckless Kelly plays alt-country the old-fashioned way: lots of sweat and spit and no time for the catatonic slickness inherent in country of the Nashville variety. The band’s 2005 effort, Wicked Twisted Road, was justifiably praised by the likes of Joe Ely and ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, two guys who know a thing or two about Texas music. Now working on material for a new disc, Reckless Kelly is required listening for those still lamenting the breakup of Uncle Tupelo."
