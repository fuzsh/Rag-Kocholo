        "text": "DEADWOOD – Three bands that define the word Americana will be headlining the first annual Deadwood Americana Music Festival presented by Deadwood Mountain Grand on Friday, May 11.\n\nReckless Kelly, Mike & The Moonpies and Ryan Schupe & The Rubber Band will take the stage for what will become an annual event at the Deadwood Mountain Grand Event Center.\n\nCody and Willy Braun of Reckless Kelly grew up in the White Cloud Mountains of Idaho. They moved to Bend, Oregon, and then migrated to that great musical fountainhead, Austin, Texas.\n\nThe band’s co-founders and frontmen toured the country as part of their father’s band, Muzzie Braun and the Boys, as children. They performed on The Tonight Show twice. Their father taught his four sons a professional ethic – integrity, persistence, hard work and professionalism – honed over three generations.\n\n“We came along in that second wave of the movement,” Cody Braun said. “Son Volt’s album Trace had a major effect on us. People like Joe Ely, Ray Kennedy and Robert Earl Keen were always big supporters. Our goal was to make music that had a country vibe but a solid rock edge.”\n\nReckless Kelly’s string of critically acclaimed albums – Under the Table and Above the Sun (2003), Wicked Twisted Road (2005), Bulletproof (2008), Somewhere in Time (2010), Grammy-nominated Good Luck & True Love (2011) and Grammy-winning Long Night Moon (2013) – set a standard of reliable excellence and commitment to an instinctive vision of Americana.\n\nOn-stage and on record, Austin's Mike and the Moonpies keep the torch of Texas country burning. Whether it's a hardcore two-step, freewheeling Western swing, Doug Sahm's Cosmic American Music or George Strait's sweet, burnished ballads, Mike and the Moonpies tap into the traditions of the Lone Star State, yet their music feels nimble and fresh thanks to their deft interplay and sly touch.\n\nA nascent version of Mike and the Moonpies premiered in 2008, with guitarist Catlin Rutherford leading a variety of musicians through a Monday night residency at the Hole in the Wall, a dive on the University of Texas drag.\n\nToward 2010, the band solidified around Rutherford, vocalist Mike Harmeier, steel guitarist Zach Moulton, drummer Kyle Ponder and bassist Preston Rhone, with this lineup releasing the independent The Real Country that year. Pianist John Carbone joined in 2011 and the band claimed the East Side venue the White Horse as its new Austin haunt. The following year found the band releasing its second album, The Hard Way.\n\nAfter the release of The Hard Way, Mike and the Moonpies continued to tour regularly, expanding to the rest of Texas. The group's third album, 2015's Mockingbird, began to earn the group attention outside of Texas. After delivering a double live album called Live at WinStar World Casino & Resort in 2016, the group returned in early 2018 with its fourth studio album, Steak Night at the Prairie Rose.\n\nRyan Schupe & the Rubber Band is a five man band hailing from Salt Lake City, Utah, include banjoist, bouzouki, guitar, mandolin and vocals Craig Miner, drummer Bart Olson, guitar and vocals Roger Archibald, bass and vocals Colin Botts and Ryan Shupe, lead vocals, fiddle, mandolin and guitar.\n\nThey initially signed with Capital Records where they made the well-received album, Dream Big, released in 2005 and produced by Jason Deere. That album produced the hit single “Dream Big” which was used as the theme song for NBC’s prime-time show, “Three Wishes,” hosted by Amy Grant.\n\nThey later parted ways with the label, but continued to tour steadily and work on new material, some of which was heard by new label Montage Music Group, who immediately signed the group. Their new CD, Last Man Standing, is a progression from their previous albums.\n\nWith songs like the catchy “Don’t Leave Me Lonely,” and the optimistically ambitious title track, there’s no question that the band hasn’t changed their essence or core, but merely expanded into bigger territory musically.\n\nTunes like “All I Need,” (a love song penned by Ryan for his wife) and the inspiring “10,000 Lakes,” with its encouraging wisdom, show a more serene side of the band, though they soon crank things back up to a fever pitch and return to their glorious picking on songs like “My Life” and “Be The One.”\n\nTickets for the Deadwood Americana Music Festival go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday, March 30. They are available at the Deadwood Mountain Grand Box Office -— The Company Store — or at ticketmaster.com. Both hotel reservations and ticket arrangements may be made by calling 877-907-GRAND.\n\nFor more information, visit deadwoodmountaingrand.com or call 605-559-0386.\n\nBeware of third party ticket brokers. The only official ticket outlets are Ticketmaster and the Deadwood Mountain Grand Box Office."
