        "text": "High-energy, legendary Texas honky tonkers Reckless Kelly are headed for Joe’s On Weed Street in Chicago on May 10th, and after nearly 30 years on the road, all signs are pointing to it being the final trip to the area.\n\nTickets are on sale HERE, and Herd Members can enter to win a pair down below! Not a Herd Member yet? Just check the box to join when you enter and you’re good to go!\n\nFronted by central Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun, the brothers are part of a rich musical legacy that spans three generations, hundreds of thousands of road miles, and virtually every club, theatre, festival, and venue across America.\n\n“It was kind of a tough decision to make, just because it’s all we’ve ever known, ya know? We’ve been in this band going on 30 years next year…we all still honestly like each other, but we’re kind of just ready to just try something else and not have to be somewhere every weekend for the rest of our lives” says founding member Willy Braun. “It’s bittersweet because we still really like playing music together, that’s why we can’t really fully commit to calling it quits forever (laughs).”\n\nThe band announced their intentions to retire from full-time touring in late 2023, with a their final official tour underway currently through 2024 consisting of 30-35 shows, and expected to wrap in current form for good in 2025.\n\n“I think we’ll wind up playing together for the rest of our lives, but just going to take a couple of shows here and there as they come down the pipe…and do a little more fishing, and relaxing, and sitting on the porch…”\n\nAn indispensable part of the Texas music scene for almost 3 decades, the GRAMMY Award-winning band has released 17 albums and are putting the finishing touches on The Final Frontier, expected to be released this Summer, but Willy says the way it’s all come together helped keep any added pressure off of a “final album”…\n\n“It’s a concept I’d been thinking about for man, probably four, five, six years…it would have been difficult, with added pressure on it, but I already had this record about half-written, so it worked out well”\n\nListen to Willy and Gordon Mays catch up on all of this and more above, and make sure to enter to win tickets below to catch Reckless Kelly in these parts while you still can!"
