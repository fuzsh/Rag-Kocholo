        "text": "ABOUT THE EVENT\n\nCall it Reckless Kelly’s Last Hurrah.\n\nFrom its roots as a barnstorming Idaho outfit to its modern-day status as a torchbearer for independent Americana music from coast to coast, Reckless has tied Austin rock and cowboy poetry together seamlessly for more than 25 years. Now, the band is slowly winding down its touring days.\n\nCo-founders and brothers Willy and Cody Braun told Rolling Stone in late 2022 that Reckless will pare its touring schedule back to roughly 35 shows a year from 2023-35 before retiring from the road altogether. This alone is a major change for a group that has neared or exceeded 200 shows a year for most of its career.\n\nThe reason for the long goodbye, according to the members, is to ensure fans have opportunities to catch more shows without the pressure a whirlwind farewell tour puts on both artist and the audience.\n\n“The coolest thing about our fan base is, we got them one at a time,” Willy — Reckless’s frontman, says. “We didn’t go out there with one big hit or music video or one big tour. We literally got our fans on an individual basis. I’m pretty proud of that part: Once we got a fan, they stayed with us.”\n\nThe Perfect Place\n\nWhen you visit us you will instantly feel welcomed and comfortable at Cafe 191. That’s how we do hospitality around here, just like friends and neighbors gathered around the ranch house kitchen table.\n\nSo relax, slow down, sit on the porch and enjoy our unmatched view of the iconic Crazy Mountains.\n\nWe’ll do the rest.\n\nAt Café 191 we proudly support Montana Agriculture offering as many local products as we can source. We feature our own all natural, grass fed & finished beef raised right here in Melville on our ranch property, Sweet Grass Land and Cattle. If you want to know where your beef comes from, simply look out the window. While we are first generation restaurant owners, our ranch is owned and operated by the fifth generation of the Cremer Family to live, work and play in Sweet Grass County. To say we are in love with Melville and Montana is an understatement and we are excited to share this part of our life with you!\n\nWe are pleased to serve bread products from Grains of Montana, a family owned farm in Nashua baking their finished product in Billings. We buy potatoes from Montana growers. While our coffee beans are not grown in Montana, they are roasted in Bozeman. Tumblewood Teas are blended, packaged and distributed worldwide from right down Highway 191 in Big Timber. Our beer and wine list includes some real Montana gems. And, let’s not forget about Wilcoxson’s ice cream - an iconic Montana brand. Thank you for dining with us today and we hope you enjoy all that our bountiful Big Sky Country offers."
