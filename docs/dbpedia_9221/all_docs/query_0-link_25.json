        "text": "Logjam Presents is pleased to welcome Reckless Kelly live in concert at The Wilma on April 18, 2019.\n\nTickets are on sale now at The Top Hat, online or by phone at 1 (800) 514-3849. Reserved premium balcony seating and general admission standing room only tickets are available. All ages are welcome.\n\nAdditional ticketing and venue information can be found here.\n\nAbout Reckless Kelly\n\nUnderstanding the virtuosity of Reckless Kelly requires the perspective of where the band has been. Cody and Willy Braun grew up in the White Cloud Mountains of Idaho. They moved to Bend, Oregon, and then migrated to that great musical fountainhead, Austin, Texas.\n\nThe bandʼs co-founders and frontmen toured the country as part of their fatherʼs band, Muzzie Braun and the Boys, as children. They performed on The Tonight Show twice. Their father taught his four sons a professional ethic – integrity, persistence, hard work and professionalism – honed over three generations. They overcame hardships, struggled for recognition, and learned the lessons of the trial and error that defined them.\n\nIn one sense, itʼs remarkable in the way of any musician, athlete, or businessperson who bucks the odds.\n\nIn another, though, itʼs utterly natural that Reckless Kelly, born in the dreams of the two Braun brothers and their heritage but nurtured in the bumpy road of maturity, became the very essence of Americana music in all its far-flung glory.\n\n“We came along in that second wave of the movement,” Cody Braun says. “Son Voltʼs album Trace had a major effect on us. People like Joe Ely, Ray Kennedy and Robert Earl Keen were always big supporters. Our goal was to make music that had a country vibe but a solid rock edge.”\n\nIn the end, all the recipe required was to just add water. Water facilitates life. It enriches the soul.\n\nAs Music Row magazine proclaimed, “In my perfect world, this is what country radio would sound like.”\n\n“This” is Reckless Kelly.\n\nJackson Holte & the Highway Patrol is a 4-piece rock and roll band from Missoula, MT, formed by several of the town’s greasiest bar-band veterans in 2017. Jackson Holte fronts the band with his own blend of earthy narrative songwriting and soaring blues guitar playing, and in the Highway Patrol – Marko “The Midnight Shadow” Capoferri on bass, Tyson Gerhardt on guitar, and Brian Tremper on drums – he’s found three co-conspirators who share his love of roots music.\n\nTogether their sound is what ISSUES magazine called “a lo-fi, indy rock version of the great Americana music of the 1970s,” and if the band’s music seems retrospective, it may be only because Holte once picked up a copy of For the Sake of the Song and learned from Mickey Newbury’s liner notes that “a writer’s tools are truths, and truth doesn’t change all that much.” With a firm grounding in America’s folk traditions, the band is able to bound across genres in a colorful and authentic style.\n\nThe band released their eponymous debut EP in September, and have since shared stages with Laney Lou and the Bird Dogs, The Hasslers, Hellbound Glory, and Lost Dog Street Band. 2019 finds the band still based in Missoula, focused on gigging and branching out across the Northwest.\n\nJackson Holte and the Highway Patrol by Jackson Holte and the Highway Patrol"
