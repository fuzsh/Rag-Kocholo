Now, the band is slowly winding down its\n\ntouring days.\n\nCo-founders and brothers Willy and Cody Braun told Rolling Stone in late 2022 that Reckless\n\nwill pare its touring schedule back to roughly 35 shows a year from 2023-35 before retiring from\n\nthe road altogether. This alone is a major change for a group that has neared or exceeded 200\n\nshows a year for most of its career.\n\nThe reason for the long goodbye, according to the members, is to ensure fans have\n\nopportunities to catch more shows without the pressure a whirlwind farewell tour puts on both\n\nartist and the audience.\n\n“The coolest thing about our fan base is, we got them one at a time,” Willy — Reckless’s\n\nfrontman, says. “We didn’t go out there with one big hit or music video or one big tour. We\n\nliterally got our fans on an individual basis. I’m pretty proud of that part: Once we got a fan, they\n\nstayed with us.”\n\nCody — who plays fiddle and mandolin — and Willy grew up in rural Idaho, near Stanley, in a\n\nfamily full of musicians. They are joined in Reckless by drummer Jay Nazz, bassist Joe Miller,\n\nand steel guitar player Geoff Queen.\n\nBefore wrapping up on the road, Reckless plans to release at least one more full-length album\n\n— a follow to the double album American Jackpot/American Girls, which was released in spring\n\n2020 just as the pandemic shut down live music and scuttled a release tour — and the band\n\nintends to announce multiple projects, big and small, between now and 2025.\n\n—--------"
