        "text": "Spicewood Art’s, a nonprofit organization, mission is to provide the residents of Spicewood, TX, and surrounding cities an opportunity to experience, enjoy and support the visual, performing, and literary arts through conducting six performances a season. Our 5th performance this season is Reckless Kelly, celebrating the beginning of the eclipse weekend.\n\nReckless Kelly is an American country rock band. The heartland gave the band authenticity. Musical lives honed its skill. Adversity instilled its persistence. Moving to Austin gave it wings to fly. As kids, the Brauns – Cody, Willy, Micky, and Gary – shared a stage with the likes of Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, and Merle Haggard. Cody and Willy branched out adding great musicians and formed Reckless Kelly.\n\nThey are ready to get off the road where they have been performing over 200 shows per year. 2024 & 2025 will be pre-retirement and they will only be playing 35 shows per year. They are excited for one of those to be for us in Spicewood, TX."
