        "text": "Longhorns City Limits has returned. At least, for now.\n\nWith the college football season months away, fans will get a sniff of the upcoming year with the annual Orange White Scrimmage on April 20. With it, comes LCL and Reckless Kelly, which will be performing on the LBJ Lawn with special guest Sentimental Family Band. It's also free admission for all fans.\n\nMore: Texas football looks for plugs on the defensive line to replace Sweat, Murphy | Golden\n\nA Grammy-winning band, Reckless Kelly is celebrating nearly three decades of its music with the launch of the Last Frontier Tour in April, while the album will be released later this year. New songs will be previewed at LCL, but fan favorites will also be part of the performance.\n\nTexas football has quite a few questions to answer after seeing 11 players from its 2023 College Football Playoff run leave for the 2024 NFL draft. The game will reveal more about the standouts from this year's roster and give fans something to be excited about for the 2024 season.\n\nSentimental Family Band will take the stage first at 10 a.m., with Reckless Kelly following at 11:30 a.m. The Orange and White Scrimmage will kickoff at 1 p.m. CT."
