        "text": "LOVEly chaotic SUPERNOVA\n\n\"Rooted in the soul of Texas, Love & Chaos, merges the talents of AJ Vallejo, the acclaimed frontman of 'Vallejo,' known for touring with national acts like The Black Crowes, Matchbox 20, Stone Temple Pilots, & Blues Traveler; and Lufkin-born singer/songwriter/American Idol finalist, Kendall Beard. The dynamic duo blends Americana, alt-rock, and country in a genre-defying manner transcending conventional boundaries.\n\nAJ, a three-time Producer of the Year at the Austin Music Awards, collaborated with Kendall after her 'Idol' journey, producing and recording her debut album. The studio relationship during that period proved to be so fruitful that the powerful songwriting duo birthed 'Out of State Out of Mind,' a single originally intended as a one-time endeavor. Yet, the overwhelming reception from audiences propelled them to explore further musical collaborations with their first 2017 self-titled EP quickly captivating a growing dedicated fanbase followed by their second EP “Everywhere I Go’ in December 2019,\n\nTheir journey is marked by notable milestones, including sharing stages with iconic acts like REO SPEEDWAGON and STYX during their Texas tour leg, as well as performances alongside artists like Diamond Rio, Monte Montgomery, and Whiskey Myers.\n\nTheir diligent rise was highlighted by the 2023 Best New Band win at the Texas Music & Radio Awards and a significant collaboration with Willy Braun from Reckless Kelly, resulting in their first #1 'Wildflower,' December 2022, continuing their chart-topping streak with their second #1 'Come Back to Bed’ in October 2023.\n\nAJ and Kendall are diligently crafting their highly-anticipated debut full-length album, slated for a 2024 release in the Fall."
