        "text": "AUSTIN, TX—June 11, 2024—Grammy-winning Americana / Red Dirt band Reckless Kelly announces their new single, “Keep Lookin’ Down the Road,” set for release on June 21, 2024. This is the debut track from the album The Last Frontier, slated for release this fall. The song will also have a music video shot and directed by Reckless Kelly frontman Willy Braun.\n\n“Keep Lookin’ Down the Road” encapsulates the essence of Reckless Kelly. “This song is a reflection on the past and an appreciation for the present, but most importantly, it’s an optimistic look ahead. It reassures the listener that good things are coming our way, while at the same time reminding us to live for the moment because, at the end of the day, Mother Nature bats last,” shares Willy Braun.\n\nReckless Kelly co-founder, Cody Braun agrees, \"I think this song fits where we are as a band right now. While we are making some changes and not going to be on the road as much, we are still excited about what the future holds for us as a band and as individuals.\"\n\nWritten by Willy Braun, brother Gary Braun (Micky & The Motorcars), and close friend Jeff Crosby, the song emerged from the trio’s annual “Hitscation”—a yearly songwriting retreat they hold at an off-the-grid cabin in Idaho. This serene and inspiring environment has consistently yielded some of the band’s most heartfelt and powerful compositions.\n\nMilestones abound for Reckless Kelly. Not only are they approaching their 30th anniversary as a band, but they are also preparing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of their album Wicked Twisted Road in 2025, and the 40th anniversary of their festival The Braun Brothers Reunion, this summer.\n\nLaunched by Willy and Cody’s parents in 1984, the three-day, family-friendly music festival, held each August in Challis, Idaho celebrates Americana music. Artists including Steve Earle, Wade Bowen, the Josh Abbott Band, Micky & The Motorcars, Cody Canada and the Departed, Bri Bagwell, and Jeff Crosby are set to perform during the festivities August 8 - 10.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the band will unveil further details about The Last Frontier, to their fans including a cover reveal, special guests, track listing, and the video. Catch Reckless Kelly on tour now, including select co-headlining shows with Steve Earle during which they will be performing sets with Steve as his band \"The Dukes\" as well as their own sets.\n\nContact Kate Richardson for a private streaming link…\n\nAbout Reckless Kelly: Americana/Red-Dirt band Reckless Kelly has been burning up stages with their high-energy blend of rock and country music since 1996. Fronted by central Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun, the brothers are part of a rich musical legacy that spans three generations. Twenty-eight years ago, Willy and Cody moved to Austin, TX, added drummer Jay Nazz to their core, and formed a band that would change Texas's musical history. An indispensable part of the Americana music scene for almost 3 decades, the GRAMMY Award-winning band has released 17 albums and is the Outlaw Group of the Year in the 2024 Ameripolitan Awards."
