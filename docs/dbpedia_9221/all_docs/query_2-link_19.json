        "text": "The wait is over.\n\nFor the first time in four years, legendary red dirt outfit Reckless Kelly is back with new music. Titled “Keep Lookin’ Down The Road,” the band’s aptly titled new tune plays right into a theme that has been latently present throughout their whole catalog, but perhaps now more than ever hits close to home for the band and fans alike.\n\nWhile relatively upbeat sonically, “Keep Lookin’ Down The Road” is an introspective and reflective track that encourages the listener to be optimistic about the future, but not so much so that they can’t live within the present.\n\nCheck it out here:\n\nWritten by lead singer Willy Braun, with the help of his brother Gary Braun (of Micky & the Motorcars) and their friend and frequent collaborator Jeff Crosby, Reckless Kelly’s latest song is also the lead single from the band’s forthcoming record The Last Frontier.\n\nScheduled to be released on an undisclosed date sometime this fall, The Last Frontier will bring the band into their final year as a touring act, as they announced at the end of 2022 that they’d wane off their presence on the road over the coming years with 2025 marking the end of Reckless Kelly as a touring band.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily rule out the prospect of them continuing to make music, though. And I sure hope they do, because there will be a big hole in the alt-country, red dirt world if Reckless Kelly fades away. For those who may not be familiar with Reckless Kelly and their importance within the music scene, these guys formed in 1996 in Bend, Oregon. The band is fronted by brothers and Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun whose musical roots run deep in the Mountain West, and ever since they moved the group to Austin, TX shortly after their formation, their presence and impact on the Texas and Oklahoma music scenes has been monumental.\n\nFollowing their debut album Millican in 1998, Reckless Kelly has had a longstanding and impressive career through which they have earned a reputation as one of the best live bands in the genre and as some of the most well-respected songwriters on the scene, and they’ve amassed an extensive catalog of top-notch original music to show for it. I highly suggest you dive in if you haven’t already. Here are a few classics to get you started.\n\n“Crazy Eddie’s Last Hurrah”\n\n“Wicked Twisted Road”\n\n“Seven Nights In Eire”\n\n“Nobody’s Girl”\n\nIt’s way too soon to say that Reckless Kelly’s reign is over, but their future, and their presence within the scenes they have occupied for years is a bit uncertain at the moment. While 2025 will allegedly mark the end of their touring careers, I’m hopeful they’ll still continue to make original music in some capacity, and I’m sure they’ll get back together for some surprise appearance at The Braun Brothers Reunion each year, the annual music festival hosted by the Braun family in their native state of Idaho.\n\nIn the meantime, though, we at least have their next album The Last Frontier to look forward to, and a handful of shows on the docket for the remainder of the year until more announced for Reckless Kelly’s last year on the road in 2025.”\n\nTour Dates\n\n6/21 – Salvage Station – Asheville, NC=\n\n6/22 – The Shed – Maryville, TN*\n\n6/28 – Whitewater Amphitheater – New Braunfels, TX+%\n\n6/29 – Whitewater Amphitheater – New Braunfels, TX*!\n\n7/27 – Kit Carson County Fairgrounds – Burlington, CO\n\n7/30 – Ozark Empire Fair – Springfield, MO\n\n8/3 – Mission Ballroom – Denver, CO*\n\n8/8-8/10 – Braun Brothers Reunion 2024 – Challis, ID~\n\n8/15 – Egyptian Theatre – Park City, UT\n\n8/16 – Egyptian Theatre – Park City, UT\n\n8/17 – Egyptian Theatre – Park City, UT\n\n8/18 – Egyptian Theatre – Park City, UT\n\n8/31 – Cafe 191 – Melville, MT\n\n9/6 – Big Barn Dance 2024 – Taos, NM~\n\n10/11 – Peacemaker Festival 2024 – Fort Smith, AR~\n\n10/12 – Knuckleheads – Kansas City, MO#\n\n=w/ The Vegabond\n\n*w/ Steve Earle\n\n+w/ Bri Bagwell\n\n%w/ The Steelwoods\n\n!w/ Courtney Patton\n\n#w/ Kenny Feidler and the Cowboy Killers"
