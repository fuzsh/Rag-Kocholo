        "text": "THE RED CLAY STRAYS\n\nTHE RED CLAY STRAYS The Red Clay Strays are forging a new path with their spellbinding, genre-bending, brand of tunes. Inspired by the vibrant heyday of southern music, while also ushering in a new era of rock-and-roll that is as distinctive as the men who form it, Brandon Coleman (lead vocals/guitar), Drew Nix (vocals/electric guitar/harmonica), […]\n\nWILLIAM BECKMANN\n\nWILLIAM BECKMANN Hailing from the small border town of Del Rio, TX, William Beckmann was raised on classic country as well as the mariachi and Norteño sounds of northern Mexico. He delivers a fresh blend of vintage country, Americana and Latin music with a timeless baritone and an old soul maturity that belies his youth. […]\n\nJAMIE LIN WILSON\n\nJAMIE LIN WILSON “It’s a weird road we’re on right now––I guess it always has been,” Jamie Lin Wilson says. She’s sitting on her porch in D’Hanis, a tiny town on the Seco Creek in South Texas, not far from San Antonio. She laughs a little, then adds, “But nobody’s life is the same. There […]\n\nTANNER USREY\n\nTANNER USREY Hailing from Prosper, TX, Tanner Usrey is an Emerging singer/songwriter with a vocal styling all his own. Since beginning his career, Tanner has developed into a soulful, Americana-rock artist that heart wrenching lyrics and soul-touching vocals provide the cherry on top of his unforgettable melodies and hard-hitting sound. Drawing inspiration from the rigors […]\n\nSTONEY LARUE\n\nSTONEY LARUE For nearly two decades Stoney LaRue has sustained a seminal music career that was dug straight out of the red dirt in Oklahoma. His rock infused country “tude” coupled with a dominating set of vocal pipes quickly identified him as a rising star. 20 years later, LaRue has “been there” and “done that” […]\n\nRECKLESS KELLY\n\nRECKLESS KELLY Call it Reckless Kelly’s Last Hurrah. From its roots as a barnstorming Idaho outfit to its modern-day status as a torchbearer for independent Americana music from coast to coast, Reckless has tied Austin rock and cowboy poetry together seamlessly for more than 25 years. Now, the band is slowly winding down its touring […]\n\nWADE BOWEN\n\nWADE BOWEN Twenty years and some 4,000 shows into his career, the name Wade Bowen has become synonymous with Texas country music –and for good reason. An artistic descendant of American icons like Guy Clark, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Robert Earl Keen and more, Bowen is another link in a Texan chain of roots-rock poets stretching […]\n\nWILLIAM CLARK GREEN\n\nWILLIAM CLARK GREEN In the proudly independent Texas-country scene, it’s not easy to separate yourself – or to evolve once you have. But for almost 15 years, William Clark Green has done both with a nod to his home state itself, both rooted in the past and barreling toward the future. Boasting sandpaper vocals and […]\n\nSOUTHALL\n\nSOUTHALL In 2015, the local songwriting scene of Stillwater, OK brought together four like-minded individuals from completely different background who wanted nothing more than to play music. Southall became the talk of Oklahoma after the release of their acoustic album “Six String Sorrow” in 2015 that accumulated 8 million streams in just 3 years. In […]\n\nRANDY HOUSER\n\nRANDY HOUSER With an inimitable voice The New York Times describes as “wholly different, thicker and more throbbing, a caldron bubbling over,” Randy Houser racked up three consecutive No. 1 hits and more than four million in singles sales to date with his Stoney Creek Records album How Country Feels. He topped the charts with […]"
