        "text": "Austin, TX - July 10, 2024 - Americana/Outlaw Country icons Reckless Kelly announce the release of their next single, \"What’s Left Of My Heart,\" on July 19. This will be the second track from their upcoming album, The Last Frontier, set for release in September.\n\n\"What's Left Of My Heart\" seamlessly blends raw emotion with a rock 'n' roll Stones-esqe groove. Penned by Reckless Kelly frontman, Willy Braun, the single regales the aftermath of love with a vulnerable yet seductive drive, inviting the listeners to pick up the pieces for another go at romance. Pre-save “What’s Left of My Heart” now!\n\nWilly Braun shares insights on the track:\n\n“This song came out really fast and easy, which made me think it probably wasn’t very good. (laughs) Jonathan Tyler, our co-producer, liked it a lot and talked me into giving it a shot We tried to put a little bit of a Rolling Stones vibe on it, while still keeping a solid foot in the country roots. It wound up being one of my favorite tracks on the record, and I’m looking forward to seeing how the crowds react to it live.\"\n\nThe 40th Braun Brothers Reunion - Reckless to Perform with Steve Earle\n\nReckless Kelly's Willy and Cody Braun, with their brothers Micky and Gary Braun (Micky & The Motorcars) are preparing for their annual festival, The Braun Brothers Reunion, August 8 -10 in Challis, ID. This year the festival features an epic set with Reckless performing as The Dukes with Steve Earle.

This year’s line-up includes Steve Earle, Reckless Kelly, Wade Bowen, Micky & The Motorcars, Bri Bagwell, Cody Canada, Tylor & The Train Robbers, and more! Three-day, two-day, and single-day tickets are available for the family-friendly festival. Full line-up and tickets here..\n\nMembers of Reckless Kelly are available for interviews, as are advance copies of the full album for media preview.\n\nAbout Reckless Kelly:\n\nAmericana/Outlaw Country band Reckless Kelly has been burning up stages with their high-energy blend of rock and country music since 1996. Fronted by central Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun, the brothers are part of a rich musical legacy that spans three generations. Twenty-five years ago, Willy and Cody moved to Austin, TX, added drummer Jay Nazz to their core, and formed a band that would change Texas's musical history.
