        "text": "FALL RIVER — Reckless Kelly will perform at Narrows Center for the Arts on Friday, Sept. 13.\n\nUnderstanding the virtuosity of Reckless Kelly requires the perspective of where the band has been. Cody and Willy Braun grew up in the White Cloud Mountains of Idaho. They moved to Bend, Oregon, and then migrated to that great musical fountainhead, Austin, Texas.\n\nThe band's co-founders and frontmen toured the country as part of their father's band, Muzzie Braun and the Boys, as children. They performed on \"The Tonight Show\" twice. Their father taught his four sons a professional ethic – integrity, persistence, hard work and professionalism – honed over three generations. They overcame hardships, struggled for recognition, and learned the lessons of the trial and error that defined them.\n\nIn one sense, it's remarkable in the way of any musician, athlete, or businessperson who bucks the odds.\n\nIn another, though, it's utterly natural that Reckless Kelly, born in the dreams of the two Braun brothers and their heritage but nurtured in the bumpy road of maturity, became the very essence of Americana music in all its far-flung glory.\n\nIn the end, all the recipe required was to just add water. Water facilitates life. It enriches the soul.\n\n\"This\" is Reckless Kelly.\n\nFor tickets, visit www.narrowscenter.org. The Narrows Center for the Arts is located 16 Anawan St."
