        "text": "The concert is part of ISU’s A Season of Note series.\n\nFounded and formed in Idaho, Reckless Kelly has remained a crowd-pleasing favorite among country rock and Americano aficionados. Based in Texas, Reckless Kelly is no stranger to larger crowds.\n\nThe band has released nine albums so far, one of which, “Long Night Moon,” won them a Grammy in 2014, and another two that have earned a top-20 spot on the U.S. Top Country Albums.\n\nKnown for their unique mix of alternative and country rock, Reckless Kelly has produced songs of all types, such as the somber “Buckaroo” and the upbeat “Nobody’s Girl.” They have also appeared on the long-running “The Tonight Show.”\n\nAs native Idahoans, the band frequently returns to Idaho to perform in its home state. Fans can find them at the annual Braun Brothers Reunion, which is held in Challis, every August.\n\nPrices for tickets are $34 for main seating and $38 for upper seating. Tickets can be purchased at the ISU Box Office in the Stevens Performing Arts Center, by phone (208-282-3595), or online at isu.edu/tickets.\n\nFor more information on Reckless Kelly, visit the website at recklesskelly.com"
