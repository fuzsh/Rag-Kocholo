        "text": "(this piece was published by Planet JH Weekly) Even considering that the Idaho-born Braun brothers founded Reckless Kelly in Bend, Oregon before moving to Austin in 1997, they more-or-less define the “Texas country” tag. Texas country refers to a sub-genre of alt-country and country-rock that brings the carefree attitude of the outlaw and the truthful, straightforward lyrics of roots music and Americana. Or, as frontman Willie Braun told Seattle Times last year, “Not this Toby Keith bullshit. Good country…Rainier and whiskey-drinking country.”Reckless Kelly’s Grammy-nominated album Good Luck & True Love [2011]—which also took home four Lone Star Music Awards and sent three singles to #1 on Texas Radio—was followed up last year by the band’s eight studio release, Long Night Moon. The latter is a classic road record, conceived from eighteen years of touring and showcasing that these five individuals have come to sustain a lifestyle that they envisioned from the start.“We are in it to make a living and make the music we want to play,” band co-founder Cody Braun told Lubbock Avalanche-Journal earlier this month. “We aren’t focused on getting the record deal or playing stadiums and that was never our goal. We are happy doing what we are doing. We set out to do what we wanted and that was the dream.”Some longtime locals may remember the band’s fiery performance on September 6, 2005 when they opened for Willie Nelson at Snow King Amphitheatre. They had just released Wicked Twisted Road, putting them in Robert Earl Keen’s company of hard drinkin’ good ole boys with a sensitive side to match the alt-country rocking.Also supporting the bill is local Americana/soul, country-blues band Screen Door Porch and another country-rock flavored Idaho singer-songwriter, Jeff Crosby & The Refugees. Both bands just recorded new albums and have been working the regional festival scene this summer. Concert on the Commons with Reckless Kelly, Screen Door Porch, and Jeff Crosby & The Refugees, 5 p.m. Sunday outside in Teton Village Commons. Free, all-ages. JacksonHole.com."
