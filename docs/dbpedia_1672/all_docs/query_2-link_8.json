        "text": "The Nevada men's basketball team in the Mountain West Tournament quarterfinal at Las Vegas' Thomas & Mack Center to fall to 26-7 overall. Here are three takeaways from Nevada's loss to the Rams.\n\n1. CSU channels non-conference form\n\nBefore the start of the MW Tournament, I . The top-three teams on that list— No. 1 Nevada, No. 2 Boise State, No. 3 UNLV, who were a combined 19-3 since Feb. 17— went 0-3 in the conference tournament. That reaffirms my belief, and I wrote this in the story, that \"momentum\" doesn't carry over to the postseason. If it did, Nevada would have beaten Colorado State, which was 3-4 in its last seven regular-season games. But the Rams channeled their elite form from non-conference when Colorado State was legitimately a top-15 team in the nation. That form did not carry over to MW play because the Rams' offense, specifically their 3-point shooting, took a nosedive.\n\nThat offense remained an issue in Colorado State's closer-than-expected 72-62 win over lackluster San Jose State in the MW Tournament first round Wednesday. Yes, that was a 10-point win, but that was a one-possession game with less than 2 minutes remaining. Colorado State was not in elite offensive form until facing Nevada. The Rams made 7-of-20 3-pointers against the Wolf Pack, a solid 35 percent mark after shooting 31.4 percent from three in MW games (10th out of 11 teams). But it was Colorado State's Princeton-style motion offense that ate up Nevada as the Rams repeatedly got layups at the rim thanks to the wizardly of star Isaiah Stevens, who had 15 points and seven assists.\n\nColorado State made 21-of-36 two-pointers (58.3 percent) and scored 36 points in the paint and 14 points on the fastbreak. While some of those points overlap, that's nearly 50 \"easy points\" added to 22 from the free throw line. Nevada's elite defense struggled against a Rams offense that tallied 123.3 points per 100 possessions, which was Colorado State's third highest in 20 games against MW foes this year. When you adjust for level of competition, this was Colorado State's third-best offensive game of the season behind wins over San Diego State and Colorado. The Rams carved up a Nevada defense that had been elite. It was the Wolf Pack's fourth-worst defensive game based on points allowed per possession behind its two losses to New Mexico and loss to Wyoming.\n\n\"I think it's been a while, particularly on offense,\" Colorado State head coach Niko Medved said of reaching that level of play. \"It's been a weird season that way that the first couple of months of the season we were one of the best offenses in the country. Then we struggled a lot just shooting the ball. I think all the other metrics offensively we were pretty good, but our defense took a massive jump. Tonight, it was interesting. I told the guys, 'I'm not going to call any plays. We're just going to go. We're going to get it out. We're going to play.' I told Isaiah today at pregame meal, I'm, like, 'Come here.' I said, 'Don't look over at me tonight. Just go. Just go be you. Just go play hoop.'\"\n\n2. Nevada loses 'bench game'\n\nOne of the reasons Wolf Pack fans could be optimistic heading into the MW Tournament was its depth. Nevada had one of the MW's better (if not best) set of reserves this season. But that bench took a major hit when it was announced earlier in the week due to a sore knee. That meant more minutes for Tylan Pope and Tyler Rolison, and the benches of both teams were asked to do more thanks to the referees' quick whistle. The officials let the teams play for the first 12 minutes before taking over the game with foul after foul called. Nevada ended up with two fewer fouls than Colorado State (24 to 26) and seven more free throw attempts (37 to 30), so the Wolf Pack can't blame the refs for the loss. But that tight whistle put a spotlight on the bench, and Colorado State clearly won the battle of the reserves.\n\nWhile Nevada's bench — Daniel Foster, Rolison, Pope and Jazz Gardner — combined for 21 points, 12 rebounds and two assists on 4-of-11 shooting, those four players had a minus-34 box-score plus-minus in 56 minutes, 14 seconds. Colorado State countered with five reserves who scored 35 points, 11 rebounds and four assists on 11-of-17 shooting while posting a box-score plus-minus of plus-14. That was huge as Colorado State's starting frontcourt of Joel Scott and Patrick Cartier both fouled out in less than 20 minutes. Nevada's starting five of Kenan Blackshear-Jarod Lucas-Tré Coleman-Nick Davidson-K.J. Hymes played just 7 minutes, 22 seconds together. In those minutes, Nevada outscored Colorado State by 12 points. In the game's other 32 minutes, 21 seconds, the Wolf Pack was outscored by 19 points.\n\n\"Their bench hurt us,\" Nevada coach Steve Alford said.\n\nAdded Blackshear: \"They won the bench game.\"\n\nWho knows how the game would have been different if McIntosh had been available, but the bench was a big story in this game. Colorado State put five players in double-figures; Nevada had three.\n\n\"When we were playing our best basketball early in the season, that's kind of what you saw from this group,\" Medved said of his bench. \"That's kind of what we do, and that's what happened tonight. We share the ball. We move. We get multiple guys that can score, and that makes you harder to defend.\"\n\n3. Postseason struggles continue\n\nThe loss dropped Nevada to 2-5 in the MW Tournament under Alford, which is surprising considering I wrote before the 2020 MW Tournament— Alford's first at Nevada— in the conference tournament. At New Mexico, Alford had his share of struggles in the NCAA Tournament but was elite in the conference tournament. Before that 2020 event, :\n\nThe X factor in Nevada's quest to win this week's Mountain West Tournament might not be a player on the court. He might be on the sidelines. Wolf Pack coach Steve Alford has won as many MW Tournament titles (two) as the rest of the coaches in the conference combined (also two). Alford's success in conference tournaments extends past his six seasons at New Mexico, though. Alford has won five conference tournaments in his 23 full seasons as a Division I head coach, which is tied for the 12th most among active coaches. The active coaches with more conference tournament titles than Alford are almost all future Hall of Famers. The names include coaches like Gonzaga's Mark Few, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, Kentucky's John Calipari, Kansas' Bill Self, West Virginia's Bob Huggins, North Carolina's Roy Williams, Villanova's Jay Wright and Michigan State's Tom Izzo.\n\nIndeed, Alford had lots of conference tournament success pre-Nevada, including two Big Ten titles at Iowa, two MW titles at New Mexico and one Pac-12 title at UCLA. That was five conference tournament titles in 23 seasons, a success rate of 21.7 percent. But that has not carried over to Nevada, which has had almost no postseason success under Alford, who is 2-6 in the postseason with the Wolf Pack if you include last year's NCAA Tournament loss. At New Mexico, Alford was 8-4 in the MW Tournament, although he started 2-4 before winning back-to-back conference titles in 2012 and 2013 before leaving for UCLA.\n\nAt Nevada, that 2-5 record has included just one semifinal appearance at the MW Tournament, that coming in 2021. Under Alford, the Wolf Pack is 1-3 in the MW Tournament as the better seed, that victory coming in 2022 as the No. 8 seed to New Mexico's No. 9 seed. As a top-five seed in the MW Tournament under Alford, the Wolf Pack is 1-4. That has included shocking losses to Wyoming in 2020 and San Jose State in 2022 plus this year's loss to Colorado State.\n\nSince Nevada won the 2017 MW Tournament under Eric Musselman, the Wolf Pack is 4-7 in the conference tournament with zero championship game appearances despite having a top-three seed four times during that period and a first-round bye in six of those seven tournaments.Musselman led Nevada to the MW Tournament semifinals in all four of his seasons with the Wolf Pack, going 6-3 overall. In general, conference tournaments have not been kind to Nevada (really in any sport). The Wolf Pack has won men's basketball five conference tournaments in 41 entries (17 in the Big Sky; 12 in the WAC; 12 in the MW). Nevada won at least a share of the regular-season conference title in 12 of those seasons. So, it has converted a regular-season title into a conference tournament title just five of 12 times and has still never won a conference tournament in a season in which it didn't win the regular-season crown.\n\nThe good news for Nevada is this is not the end of the season as the Wolf Pack will find out Sunday who it will play in next week's NCAA Tournament, and a win there would wipe away this loss to Colorado State pretty quickly.\n\n\"It sucks, but the good thing about basketball is you have another opportunity,\" Lucas said. \"For us seniors, both Kenan and I will have another opportunity in the NCAA Tournament, so we have to make the most of it. But it sucks it ended the way it did.\"\n\nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports. Contact him at crmurray@sbgtv.com or follow him on Twitter at @ByChrisMurray."
