        "text": "May 18, 2000\n\nBox Score\n\nLas Vegas, Nev - Brandon Rogers solo home run in the top of the seventh inning proved to be the difference as San Diego State topped BYU, 6-5, in the second round of the Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament at Earl E. Wilson Stadium on Thursday.\n\nNo. 2 SDSU (32-28) held only a brief lead in the game before battling back to first knot the game at five and then take the lead for good behind Rogers' homer. The Aztecs are the only team in the six-team tourney to win both of their games to this point and are one win away from playing for the conference title.\n\nAfter gaining the edge, SDSU called upon reliever Chris Dunwell, who did not allow a hit or a run over the final two and two-thirds innings and gathered his second save of the year. BYU starter Nate Fernley was tagged with the loss despite striking out seven over eight and two-thirds. Jeremy Cook picked up his seventh win of the year for the Aztecs.\n\nNo. 3 BYU will meet No. 1 New Mexico in an 11:00 a.m. game on Friday with the winner facing SDSU at 7:00 p.m. and the loser facing elimination. Friday's 3:00 p.m. matchup will feature No. 4 Utah against No. 6 Air Force."
