        "text": "By Rhett Glauser\n\nrhett@newsroom.byu.edu\n\nBYU baseball is riding a wave of momentum provided by a big win against first-place New Mexico and individual conference honors as the Cougars head into the inaugural Mountain West Conference Tournament.\n\nWith Cougar pitcher Nate Fernley's win on Saturday, May 13, the Cougars clinched the third seed in front of a crowd of 1,103, the Cougars largest home crowd this season.\n\n'(Saturday's game) was important for us to be able to get some stamina going into the tournament,' said BYU right fielder Matt Carson.\n\nCarson is the hottest hitter in the Mountain West Conference. The freshman leads the league in batting average (.450), slugging percentage (.780), and on-base percentage (.541).\n\nCarson gathered praise from the league's head coaches after they named him the Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year.\n\nCougar pitcher Nate Fernley also earned an individual award this week, hurling his way to be named MWC Pitcher of the Week.\n\nFernley, a junior, won his first weekly conference award pitching a no-hitter into the fifth inning in Saturday's game against New Mexico, eventually notching the 4-1 win after allowing only five hits, one unearned run, no walks, and throwing seven strikeouts.\n\n'We have a lot of good, young players who will form the nucleus\n\nfor our future,' said Cougar head coach Vance Law in a news release.\n\nThe Cougars will face familiar rival and fourth seed Utah on today at 4 p.m. MST.\n\nBYU took four out of six games from the Utes this time.\n\nCougar catcher and designated hitter Michael Davies has a current hitting streak of 11 games while Carson has a six-game hitting streak.\n\nThe games will be held on UNLV campus at Earl E. Wilson stadium. Tickets can be purchased at the stadium as complete tournament passes for $20 and individual game passes for $6."
