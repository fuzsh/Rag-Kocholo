        "text": "RENO, Nev. – For the second time in five years, the University of Nevada will host the Mountain West Championship for the 2019 season May 23-26 at Don Weir Field at Peccole Park. The Wolf Pack won the Mountain West regular-season title in 2018 after finishing with a 20-9 conference record.\n\n\"We are thrilled to host the Mountain West Championship this season,\" said head coach T.J. Bruce. \"It is a huge honor for our program and we cannot wait to host some of the top talent in the conference at our recently renovated ballpark. It will also be great for the Reno community to watch the top teams in the conference battle for a Mountain West championship.\"\n\nThis is the second time that Nevada will host the tournament, with the first coming in 2015 when Nevada won the MW regular season championship for the first time behind a 41-15 season. Don Weir Field at Peccole Park will play host to the championship in 2019, after celebrating its 30-year anniversary last season.\n\nEach season, the top-four teams from the regular season who boast the best MW record advance to the tournament. Under Bruce, Nevada has advanced all three years he has been at the helm and was the No. 1 seed in 2018.\n\nIn 2016, Bruce and the Wolf Pack advanced to the championship round against New Mexico in the MW Championship, the farthest it has ever advanced in the tournament."
