        "text": "Nevada's fantastic late-inning rally in its opening game of the Mountain West Tournament was short-circuited in the ninth, putting the Wolf Pack in a dire situation in its pursuit of its first NCAA Regional berth since 2000.\n\nNo. 1-seeded Nevada trailed rival No. 4 UNLV by five runs early and seven late but scored three runs in both the seventh and eighth innings to tie the game at 8-8 before the Rebels secured a 13-8 victory Thursday at San Diego's Tony Gwynn Stadium.\n\nThe loss dropped Nevada into the losers bracket of the double-elimination tournament. The Wolf Pack will have to win four straight games to secure the MW Tournament title and the conference's automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNevada (29-23) started sloppy, making two defensive miscues in the first inning that led to an unearned run. UNLV (34-22) added a second-inning homer and got three more in the third. The Wolf Pack fell behind 5-0 entering the bottom of the third and 8-1 entering the bottom of the sixth, but mounted a comeback.\n\nCatcher Kaleb Foster cracked a two-out, three-run homer over the right-field fence in the seventh inning to pull Nevada within 8-5. In the eighth, the first five Wolf Pack batters reached base, with Cole Krzmarzick knocking an RBI single and Grant Fennell tying the game with a two-run single. But Nevada was unable to push any more runs across despite having the bases loaded with no outs after evening the game at 8.\n\nUNLV burst back ahead in the ninth off Nevada's closer Keone Cabinian (2-3), who allowed back-to-back singles to open the frame. The Rebels took the lead on a squeeze bunt before adding four more runs on three two-out hits, including a two-RBI single by Dillon Johnson, a run-scoring bunt single by Kyle Isbel and an RBI single by Nick Rodriguez.\n\nThe Rebels hit around in the ninth before closing the game in the bottom of the frame. After blowing the lead in the eighth, UNLV closer Bryan Menendez (3-1) got the win.\n\nMark Nowaczewski, the Wolf Pack's two-time first-team All-MW ace, only made it through four innings. The Reed High grad allowed six runs (five earned) on six hits and three walks. Jordan Jackson allowed two runs in three innings of relief and after Bradley Bonnenfant pitched a scoreless eighth, Cabinian yielded five in the ninth.\n\nThe Wolf Pack was able to put runners on base throughout the game but couldn't capitalize early. It delivered some key hits in the seventh and eighth but missed a golden opportunity to end that eighth inning. With the bases loaded, nobody out and a chance to take the lead, Dillon Shrum hit into a fielder's choice, Foster struck out and Chase Grant fouled out before UNLV exploded in the ninth.\n\nKrzmarzick went 3-of-4 with two RBIs; Fennell was 2-of-5 with two RBIs; and Keaton Smith was 2-of-4. Nevada was out-hit 14-12.\n\nNevada will play the loser of the San Diego State-San Jose State game in an elimination contest Friday at 1:30 p.m. UNLV plays the winner of SDSU-SJSU at 6 p.m. Friday. The Wolf Pack must win one game Friday, two Saturday and one Sunday to win the MW Tournament and earn the conference's automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe loss also put a major dent into the Wolf Pack's Governor's Series hopes. With Nevada trailing by three points but holding the tiebreaker in the all-sport rivalry competition with UNLV, the team with the most head-to-head wins between the Wolf Pack and Rebels this week will determine the winner.\n\nWith the defeat, the only way for Nevada to win the Governor's Series is to advance to the championship game and beat UNLV twice – in Saturday's first game and Sunday's \"if necessary\" game – en route to MW Tournament title. Anything less than that would give the Governor's Series trophy to UNLV for the fifth time in their six seasons both teams have been in the MW."
