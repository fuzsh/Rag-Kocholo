        "text": "The Mountain East Conference held their baseball tournament at Charleston's GoMart Ballpark and when it was all said and done, ten games over five days and the University of Charleston hoisted the championship trophy.\n\nThe title game had local flavor with the University of Charleston defeating West Virginia State 17-4 in seven innings. The Golden Eagles went undefeated in the tournament winning four games and winning their third straight MEC championship and first under first year Head Coach Dean Peterson.\n\n\"This is a huge first step for us in our pursuit of winning at higher, higher levels,\" Peterson said. \"Obviously, you've got to get into the national tournament and we're able to get it done in the MEC and make sure that we have a spot.\"\n\nWest Virginia State jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning, capped off by a Chris Morris two-run homer. In the second inning, the WVSU offense struck gold again with another long ball, this time a solo-shot from Kyle Waters.\n\nIn the bottom of the second inning, UC got three of those runs back with just one swing when Eric Chartier hit a three-run homer, his third homerun in two days to make it a 4-3 game. Chartier a 24-year-old graduate student from Canada missed last year because of arthritis and because he's from Canada couldn't get the proper medication. Chartier is healthy again and it showed in his performance.\n\n\"It's definitely an amazing experience, not being able to be a part of it last year, obviously I dealt with arthritis so just being able to be back on the field with these guys, I know we weren't picked to win the conference and so it's just something really special for us,\" Chartier said.\n\nThe Charleston bats came alive in the third inning, scoring seven times to take a 10-4 lead. UC tied it at four with a perfect bunt from George Washington alum Brayden McCallister to score Carter Rust from third. McCallister was 2-for-3, with two runs batted in and scoring three times. Evan Ulrich would follow McCallister with an RBI single to give UC their first lead, 5-4.\n\n\"Luckily it's my third one (MEC championship) and I just want to get it, the first one for these guys over here, these guys deserve it,\" McCallister said. \"They've worked hard all year and it's all for them. It's not about me. I just want to do it for them, for the new guys.\"\n\nHurricane alum Damian Witty would make it three straight singles, when his hit drove in McCallister to make it 6-4 UC. Witty was 3-for-4, 2 RBI, 3 runs scored.\n\n\"Going to Hurricane we've played a lot of games in this park,\" Witty said. \"I won a state championship in this park. It's awesome that my parents are able to draft 30 minutes and come watch me play, watch us win a championship. It's an awesome feeling and I love it.\"\n\nTwo batters later, tournament MVPDrew Klaserner blew the game wide open with a three-run homerun to give the Golden Eagles a 9-4 lead.Klaserner was 3-for-3, with 4 RBI.\n\n\"I think it just goes to show we're just super resilient,\"Klaserner said. \"You know, we get hit in the mouth and we're happy about it. We remain composed. We're like, okay, we're still the best team in this tournament and hopefully we can continue that in the regional.\"\n\nCasey Finck's RBI double capped off the seven run third inning to give UC a 10-4 lead. A six run sixth inning, put the game away for the Golden Eagles."
