        "text": "San Diego State’s stay in the Mountain West Baseball Championship was brief, owing to an offense that was absent the past two days at the double-elimination conference tournament.\n\nThe second-seeded Aztecs saw their season end Friday afternoon with a 4-2 loss to fourth-seeded Fresno State at the Bulldogs’ Bennett Stadium.\n\nSDSU (24-29) managed just three runs in two tournament games. They scored one run on Thursday, that one not coming until the final inning, in a 12-1, seven-inning, run-rule loss to Air Force.\n\n“It was a microcosm of the entire year,” SDSU coach Mark Martinez said by phone after the game. “We got solid pitching with zero run support from our offense, especially the middle-of-the-order guys. That recipe equals a loss.\n\n“The pitching staff had to carry us all year. With no run protection from key people in the lineup, that makes it difficult to win more than you lose. We’ll turn the page and repair for next year. Embrace the process and demand doing it right.”\n\nWith the victory, the Bulldogs (29-26) stayed alive to play an elimination game Saturday against the loser of Friday’s late game between top-seeded San Jose State and third-seeded Air Force.\n\nA pair of two-run homers —one right-handed and one left-handed — by Fresno State first baseman Tommy Hopfe did all the damage for the Bulldogs.\n\n“To be honest, he said he was going to get two today, and he went out and did it,” Fresno State coach Ryan Overland said in a MW interview on the field. “Having a guy like that deciding the game at the plate, then again deciding it on the mound, you couldn’t ask for more.”\n\nHopfe moved to the mound in the ninth and allowed one run before closing out the game for his team-high 11th save.\n\nMountain West Pitcher of the Year TJ Fondtain pitched Game 2 rather than Game 1 for the Aztecs so he could start on full rest.\n\nFresno State leadoff hitter Grady Morgan greeted Fondtain with a double to center field to open the game. SDSU’s junior left-hander got the next two hitter on popups in the infield before Hopfe rocketed a ball over the left-field fence to stake the Bulldogs to a 2-0 lead.\n\nFondtain (7-4) followed with five shutout innings, but he never received any run support while on the mound. He allowed four hits in six innings, walked two and struck out six, giving him 99 strikeouts for the season.\n\nFondtain was bidding to become the first SDSU pitcher to reach the century mark since Bubba Derby had 131 strikeouts in 2015.\n\nSDSU catcher Poncho Ruiz, a first-team all-Mountain West selection, homered off Fresno State starter Roman Angelo (7-5) leading off the bottom of the sixth to make it 2-1.\n\nTime and again Fresno State prevented the Aztecs from making more offensively.\n\nSDSU left the bases loaded in the second inning, and the Aztecs stranded a runner at second base in both the fifth and seventh innings, largely due to outstanding catches up the middle by Fresno State shortstop Travis Welker.\n\nThe matter was all but decided when Hopfe hammered a pitch from SDSU reliever Eldridge Armstrong III over the right-field wall to make it 4-1 in the eighth."
