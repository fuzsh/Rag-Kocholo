The league's web page can be accessed from the TEAMS tab above. The state champion advances to the Northwest Regional. The regional champion advances to the ALB World Series in Shelby, North Carolina , which has been broadcast on ESPN during the second week of August since 2011.\n\nThe Class A division is also a Senior league, but is comprised of teams whose players come from high school that do not combine, or total, 1,000 students. The state champion advances to a Northwest Class A Regional Tournament (NWCART), there is no world series for this level of teams. Our Havre Northstars hosted in 2023, and Oregon will host the NWCART in 2024.\n\nThe Class B division is primarily a Junior league (17-years-old and under). New legion teams typically play and register as Class B junior, or senior teams if 18-year olds are going to be on the roster. There are many Class B invitational tournaments that are around Montana each summer. There is no officially sanctioned state tournament for this level.\n\n2024 AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL RULE CHANGES\n\nThe Americanism Commission has approved the following rule changes for the 2024 American Legion Baseball season:\n\nPlease refer to the rule within this rule book for official language.\n\nRule 1.V.
