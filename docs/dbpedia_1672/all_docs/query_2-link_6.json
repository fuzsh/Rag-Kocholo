Murf Gray walked in the next at-bat, and Tyler Davis drove in an insurance run for the Diamond 'Dogs with a sacrifice fly that scored Morgan.\n\nCloser Aidan Cremarosa held the Lobos scoreless to end the game with a 6-1 victory for the Bulldogs.\n\nNOTES\n\nStarting pitcher Jake Riding owned the mound with a career-high nine strikeouts in 7.0 innings.\n\nGrady Morgan went 2-3 on the day with a home run and a triple.\n\nMichael McKernan crushed his third home run of the season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Bulldogs continue their Mountain West Championship journey on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. PT at Tony Gwynn Stadium. \"Fresno State Athletics - Elevate: Imagine the Possibilities\" - The Elevate Campaign provides a visionary roadmap to enhance and construct a series of athletic facilities to help further position Fresno State Athletics for sustained competitive success nationally, while also further serving as a source of pride and economic growth throughout California's Central Valley.
