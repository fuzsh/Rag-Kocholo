Plumbing. Back To The Beginning…\n\nIn 1999, the Seahawks, competing in the South Division in the Northeast Conference, went 20-23 and 10-9 in conference tilts, two games behind eventual league champions, Monmouth, who posted 26-24 record and 12-7 mark in the league play.\n\nIn the early 90s, Joe Litterio, a native of Cranford, NJ, had a successful collegiate career as an infielder for nearby Rutgers University. He helped guide the Scarlet Knights to three NCAA tournament appearances from 1990-1993. In 1990, the team came within one game of the College World Series. Concluding his senior year with the final trip to the NCAA's after a 38-17 season, Litterio returned to his alma mater and served as a volunteer coach for the Scarlet Knights while also coaching at Immaculate Conception High School.\n\nLitterio accepted a position at then-NEC member, Monmouth, where he spent four seasons in West Long Branch and helping the Hawks to the 1998 NEC title and another appearance to the NCAAs. The following year, he traveled south to Winthrop University and was part of the coaching staff that led the Eagles to a 40-23 season and another championship, winning the Big South Championship with a 6-3 triumph over the top-seeded, Coastal Carolina.\n\nMeanwhile, on Grymes Hill, the Green & White were bringing back 11 upperclassmen for the 2000 season. A vacancy at the helm opened…. Enter Litterio.\n\nSeahawk New Era…\n\n11 upperclassmen returned for 2000. Eight new players and a new coach. \"Entering the 2000 season, there was a lot of question to be answered,\" commented Kevin Rugg, a Finance major at Wagner and the current owner and operator of Donato Inc. Plumbing.\n\nAfter Wagner's first ten games, the team stood 4-6. \"We knew we had a talented group with depth,\" added Scholz. \"We had some inconsistencies early, both offensively and defensively but the team was filled with loose, yet very confident and competitive guys.\"\n\n\"Coach Litterio was a very good coach who had a completely different approach to the way he prepared us and how he managed in games,\" Rugg added. \"He and I had good chemistry. He looked at me to take control of the players. We had guys like Cerminaro, Gil Barkman, and John Spinelli, who were leaders on and off the field.\"\n\nOverall, the 2000 Seahawks were about to be led by a coaching staff that was \"disciplined orientated, hard-working and knowledgeable,\" cited Musso.\n\nTurning Point….\n\nAfter dropping the April 20th doubleheader to Fairleigh Dickinson, Wagner fell to 6-7 in the league with the next three conference matchups against the Connecticut schools – Sacred Heart, Central Connecticut, and Quinnipiac.\n\nTraveling to Fairfield, the Seahawks picked up two wins over the Pioneers and outscoring them, 27-12, in the two-game set. \"I believe the turning point for us came when we won six games over the Connecticut schools,\" Scholz said.\n\n\"Back in 2000, the conference played doubleheaders on the weekend against two different teams,\" Coach Litterio recalls. \"We played Central Connecticut on the Saturday and Quinnipiac on Sunday. We were able to pick the four wins and from that point forward, I can see hope in the players' eyes and we knew we had a chance to make the NEC Tournament.\"\n\nWith the sweep of both Central Connecticut and Quinnipiac, the Seahawks stood at 12-7 in the league and have won five of its last seven games heading into the season finale at home against both UMBC and a doubleheader against Mount St. Mary's.\n\n\"We had a number of come-from-behind wins (one particularly against Quinnipiac) that helped us realize this team had hear and that we were different,\" recalled Musso.\n\nWagner was able to punch its ticket to the tournament, defeating the Mountaineers, 12-5 in game one, and 7-4 in game two.\n\nNEC Tournament Run…\n\nAfter sweeping Mount St. Mary's in the regular-season finale, the Seahawks were slotted into the four-seed in the upcoming tournament. \"Going into the NEC Tournament, we felt we had nothing to lose,\" said Rugg. \"Everyone stepped up to meet the challenge and played well when it mattered most,\" Scholz added.\n\nFriday, May 12… Game 1.\n\nSenior Justin Lucas toed the rubber for the Seahawks and rose to the occasion. The Stockton, NJ native pitched a complete game, seven-hitter and the Seahawk offense pelted 15 hits to earn the program's first-ever NEC postseason tournament win, a 16-1 triumph over the top-seed, UMBC, at The Sandcastle.\n\nThe Retrievers pushed across their lone run in the first inning when Scott Crandell drove in Chad Gerben. Wagner responded in their half of the third inning when John Spinelli mashed two-run homer over the left-field wall.\n\nThe Seahawks pushed across four runs in the fourth on three hits and three UMBC errors to push their lead to 6-1. The game opened up for the Seahawks in the top of the sixth, when the Green & White scored seven times on a single hit. Spinelli, who drove in four runs on three hits, Scholz,\n\nSaturday, May 13… Game 4…\n\nThe second complete game for the Seahawks this postseason. Steve Coppola tossed a complete game, two-hit shutout to lead Wagner past the No. 3 seed, Monmouth, 5-0. The Seahawks moved on to the championship round.\n\nThe Staten Island native Coppola, who defeated the Hawks, 1-0, back on April 8, struck out a season and career-high 11 batters. The offense tallied four runs in the first as Cerminaro plated home the first run with an RBI triple. Spinelli reached on a throwing error that plated home Cerminaro for a 2-0 advantage.\n\nAfter Rugg reached on a fielder's choice, Scholz beat out an infield single to drive in Spinelli, and then, with the bases loaded, Brian Camus was hit by a pitch that brought in Rugg to give Coppola a four-run edge. Cerminaro extended the lead to 5-0 with an RBI double to left-center.\n\nSunday, May 14…. Championship Sunday\n\nWith the first chance to clinch the program's first-ever title, the Seahawks came up short against Monmouth, who held off elimination with a 5-4, come-from-behind win over the No. 2 seed, Long Island. Bobby Weiss garnered two hits while Cerminaro extended his hit streak to 24 straight games.\n\nSunday, May 14…. Championship Sunday… Part II\n\nNewcomer Mike Windstein forever etched his name is Wagner lure, allowing one run over seven innings to lead the Seahawks to the program's first-ever championship with a 7-3 victory over the two-time defending champion Monmouth Hawks.\n\nAhead 7-3 in the ninth, Monmouth threatened, having runners on first and second with nobody out. Senior closer, Chris Pariseau, who had come on to start the eighth, got a strikeout before giving up a base hit to load the bases. Pariseau added another strikeout and induced Dan Coia to fly out to left to begin the celebration\n\n\"This is a great feeling, especially for the kids,\" Coach Litterio was quoted saying following the victory. \"They hung in there and seized the momentum after a tough first game. The kids have worked hard and it is great to see them be rewarded like this.\"\n\n\"I've been fortunate to find success personally and professionally after my time at Wagner,\" Musso says. \"With that being said, one of the most cherished memories is catching the final out of the NEC Championship game and running in to celebrate with my teammates. Just an incredible memory that I am thankful for.\"\n\nSunshine State Seahawks…\n\nWagner found out that they will be playing in the Coral Gables region of the NCAA tournament, squaring off against the defending national champions, the Miami University (FL).\n\n\"It was an extremely proud moment and we sensed really accomplished something that would be remembered,\" remembers Musso\n\nAlthough coming out short against the Hurricanes, the Seahawks had one more chance to advance, as they took on Florida International (FIU) in the elimination contest.\n\nThe 2000 season came to an end with a 10-1 setback to FIU. The memories, however, continue to last. \"Truly a team accomplishment and very proud and fortunate to be a part of the team,\" said Scholz. \"Although we lost in the Regionals, the memories of getting there and winning the NEC will never be forgotten,\" added Rugg.\n\n\"You dedicate a lot to become a Division I athlete and winning that championship and playing the NCAA tournament made me and the rest of my teammates realize that those sacrifices were well worth it,\" Musso said.\n\n11 upperclassmen, eight of which seniors… 13 underclassemen, which included a first-year coaching staff… The last seed in the conference championship…. Defying the naysayers and trusting in their abilities to get the job done…\n\n20 Years Later… We salute the 2000 Wagner Baseball team on their accomplishment, which lives on then, now and forever!\n\nFollow us: #CHAOSonthehill\n\nWagner Athletics:\n\nWagner Baseball:"
