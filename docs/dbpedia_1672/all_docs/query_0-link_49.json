        "text": "The 2024 campaign marks coach Randy Mazey's 12th and final season at West Virginia after guiding the team to unprecedented heights in his first 11 years in Morgantown, including an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2017, hosting an NCAA Regional in 2019, and four consecutive Big 12 Championship semifinal appearances from 2016-19, and a Big 12 regular-season championship in 2023.\n\nKnown as one of the top on-field coaches in collegiate baseball, Mazey led WVU to its first postseason appearance in 21 years in 2017, as the Mountaineers reached the NCAA regional final for the third time in program history. In 2019, he was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year and ABCA East Regional Coach of the Year after guiding the Mountaineers to a 38-win campaign, which featured the program hosting its first NCAA Regional since 1955.\n\nDuring his tenure, West Virginia has quickly risen in the Big 12 Conference, finishing in the top four in four of its first seven seasons in the league and advancing to the Big 12 Championship semifinals four times, with championship game appearances in 2016 and 2019.\n\nMazey is 336-250 at WVU and is the third-winningest coach in the program’s history.\n\n2023\n\nMazey led the Mountaineers to new heights in 2023 as WVU took home a share of the Big 12 regular-season title for the first time in program history, the first conference championship for the Mountaineers since winning the Big East in 1996.\n\nLeading WVU to a 40-20 overall record and 15-9 conference record after being picked sixth in the preseason poll, Mazey was named Big 12 Coach of the Year for the second time in his career. He won his 300th game with the Mountaineers against Arizona, his 500th game overall against Xavier, the same team his first win came against. He also moved into third all-time at WVU with his 334th win against Texas Tech.\n\nHe led the Mountaineers to their third NCAA Regional appearance in the last six completed seasons as WVU was the No. 2 seed in Lexington, defeating Ball State for his fourth NCAA win with the Mountaineers.\n\nJJ Wetherholt led a group of 13 Mountaineers to be named All-Big 12 as the sophomore was named Big 12 Player of the Year. Pitchers Ben Hampton and Carlson Reed joined Wetherholt on the first team while pitcher Blaine Traxel and outfielders Landon Wallace and Braden Barry were named to the second team. In addition, seven other players earned All-Big 12 Honorable Mention.\n\nWetherholt also became the first unanimous First-Team All-American in program history as he was honored by seven publications. He led the nation with a .449 batting average while slugging 16 home runs and 24 doubles while also stealing a Big 12-most 36 bases.\n\nAfter the season, Mazey saw five of his player sign pro contracts. Reed was drafted in the fourth round by the Pittsburgh Pirates while Barry was taken in the eighth round by the Toronto Blue Jays. Wallace (Angels), Tevin Tucker (Rockies), and Kevin Dowdell (Angels) all signed undrafted free-agent deals.\n\n2022\n\nDespite being picked eighth in the preseason Big 12 poll, Mazey’s Mountaineers won 33 games, including a program-record 14 in conference play. It marked the fifth time the veteran coach won at least 30 games at WVU. The squad also swept two Big 12 series for the first time in program history.\n\nWest Virginia was the only Big 12 squad to avoid a three-game losing streak, and it was one of just five Power 5 programs to accomplish the feat. In all, WVU was an impressive 15-6 in games following a loss.\n\nOn April 9, Mazey coached in his 500th game at West Virginia in an 8-4 win over Baylor.\n\nWVU’s strong baserunning ability continued in 2022, as the Mountaineers finished No. 2 nationally in stolen bases, with 156, good for a single-season school record. Individually, outfielder Victor Scott II swiped 38 bags, which also ranks No. 1 in the Mountaineer record books for one season.\n\nScott (five round – St. Louis) went on to become one of three Mountaineers selected in the MLB Draft, joining right-handed pitchers Jacob Watters (fourth round – Oakland) and Trey Braithwaite (16th round – Cincinnati).\n\nEight Mountaineers were placed on All-Big 12 teams, led by Braithwaite, who also was named a Third Team All-American by NCBWA, and outfielder Austin Davis. Catcher McGwire Holbrook earned second-team honors, while right-handed pitcher Noah Short, Watters, left-hander Ben Hampton and infielder JJ Wetherholt were Honorable Mention selections. Additionally, right-hander Chris Sleeper joined Wetherholt on the All-Big 12 Freshman Team.\n\nSuccess in the classroom also was a big theme in 2022, as outfielder Braden Barry and infielder Nathan Blasick earned CoSIDA Academic All-District honors, becoming the first WVU duo to be named to the team in the same year since 2003. What’s more, a program-record 15 Mountaineers were named to the Academic All-Big 12 Team. The squad’s 11 first-team honorees also were an all-time team high.\n\n2021\n\nMazey’s club won multiple games at the 2021 Big 12 Championship for the sixth time in the last eight tournaments. The Mountaineers also finished the year with five wins over ranked opponents.\n\nWest Virginia earned its highest-ranked win in program history with a 5-4 victory at No. 2 Texas on May 20, in Austin. The club matched the feat six days later with a 5-1 win over the Longhorns at the conference tournament on May 26.\n\nThe WVU skipper also reached a pair of personal milestones in 2021. On April 11, at Baylor, Mazey collected his 250th win at West Virginia with an 8-4 victory over the Bears. Later in the year, Mazey appeared in his 800th career game as a head coach on April 24, at Kansas State.\n\nThe Mountaineer pitching staff finished with 535 strikeouts in 2021, good for the fourth-most in one season in team history. As a team, WVU ranked No. 14 nationally and No. 2 in the Big 12 in strikeouts per nine innings (10.6). What’s more, Wolf became just the fourth WVU pitcher to tally a 100-strikeout season since 2000.\n\nFor the second consecutive season, a Mountaineer newcomer earned freshman All-America honors, as Hampton was recognized by Perfect Game. At the conference level, a total of four players were recognized on All-Big 12 teams, as left-handed pitcher Jackson Wolf, who registered 104 strikeouts in 2021, was named an All-Big 12 Second Team selection, while catcher Paul McIntosh and Davis earned honorable mention status. Additionally, Hampton and infielder Mikey Kluska were selected to the Big 12 All-Freshman Team.\n\nFour Mountaineer pitchers were taken in the 2021 MLB Draft. Wolf was the first WVU player to hear his name called, as he was taken in the fourth round by the San Diego Padres. Right-hander Ryan Bergert joined Wolf when he was selected in the sixth round by San Diego. Additionally, right-hander Madison Jeffrey (15th round) and left-hander Adam Tulloch (17th round) were each taken by the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nThe Mountaineers also had a superb year in the classroom. A program-record 12 players were named to the Academic All-Big 12 Team, including eight on the first team.\n\n2020\n\nThe Mountaineers played just 16 games in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. WVU finished 11-5, good for the program’s best 16-game start since 2009. On March 4, four pitchers combined to no-hit Kent State, as right-handers Tyler Strechay, Dillon Meadows, Skylar Gonzalez and Watters led WVU’s to its first nine-inning no-hitter since March 8, 2002. It also marked the first no-no in Monongalia County Ballpark history.\n\nOverall, the Mountaineers allowed four runs or fewer in 14 of their 16 games.\n\nAdditionally, two WVU newcomers, left-handed pitcher Jake Carr and infielder/catcher Matt McCormick, earned Freshman All-America honors from Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. It marked the first time two Mountaineers received the honor in the same season since 2016.\n\nIn the classroom, eight players were named to the Academic All-Big 12 Team, tying for the most in program history. The squad’s seven first-teams selections were its most since joining the league in 2013.\n\n2019\n\nThe 2019 campaign was a historic one on multiple levels for Mazey and the Mountaineers. WVU finished 38-22, the most wins under a Mazey-led team at WVU and second-most all-time. In the Big 12, West Virginia finished 13-11 before advancing to the Big 12 Championship finals for the second time in four years.\n\nHowever, the biggest news of all came when the Mountaineers were selected to host an NCAA Regional for the first time since 1955. WVU was ranked in the top 25 for the final eight weeks of the season and finished as high as No. 19 in the final NCBWA poll.\n\nA program record eight players were selected in the 2019 MLB Draft, led by junior right-handed pitcher Alek Manoah, who was picked 11th overall by the Toronto Blue Jays, tying for the highest draft pick in program history. Manoah, the first player in program history to be named to more than five All-America teams in a single season, was named the unanimous Big 12 Pitcher of the Year and to the All-Big 12 First Team. He broke the single-season WVU record for strikeouts, with 144, tied the record for starts (16), was No. 3 in innings pitched (108.1) and strikeout-to-walk ratio (5.33), No. 6 in shutouts (2) and wins (9) and No. 9 in strikeouts per nine innings (11.96). Additionally, Manoah was a Dick Howser Trophy Finalist, as well as a finalist for the CBF National Pitcher of the Year.\n\nAlong with Manoah, catcher Ivan Gonzalez was selected in the eighth round by the Chicago White Sox, left-handed pitcher Nick Snyder was an 11th-round pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks, right-handed pitcher Kade Strowd was chosen in the 12th round by the Baltimore Orioles, outfielder Brandon White went in the 17th round to the Los Angeles Angels, outfielder Darius Hill was a 20th-round selection of the Chicago Cubs, catcher Chase Illig was picked in the 29th round by the New York Yankees and right-handed pitcher Sam Kessler was a 34th-round pick of the Detroit Tigers.\n\nManoah also was joined by 10 others who were honored by the Big 12, as Gonzalez, Hill, junior Marques Inman, Kessler and designated hitter Paul McIntosh were named to the All-Big 12 Second Team, while second baseman Tyler Doanes, Snyder and White were honorable mentions. WVU’s 11 total All-Big 12 accolades were its second-most since joining the league, and the five second team honors were its most ever.\n\nUnder Mazey’s tutelage, the Mountaineer pitching staff broke the school record for saves (15) and strikeouts (595) and was second in innings pitched (528.1) and fourth in strikeouts per nine innings (10.10). At the national level, WVU pitching was No. 4 in the NCAA in hits allowed per nine innings (7.19), No. 8 in strikeouts per nine innings (10.1), No. 11 in shutouts (6), No. 18 in WHIP (1.27) and No. 24 in ERA (3.70).\n\nOffensively, WVU tied the program record for walks (257) and was third in stolen bases (98) and sacrifice flies (30), while the defense had 1,585 putouts, second-most all-time.\n\n2018\n\nFor the third consecutive season, the Mountaineers advanced to the Big 12 Championship semifinals, as they went 29-27 on the season and 9-15 in the Big 12, the No. 2 RPI conference in the country. WVU is one of two teams to reach the Big 12 semifinals in three consecutive years.\n\nWest Virginia went 5-3 against top-25 teams, which included a series win over No. 19 Texas. Another highlight of the 2018 campaign was a 3-2, walk-off win in 10 innings at PNC Park, as the Mountaineers improved to 2-0 at the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nMazey’s squad stole 95 bases, which led the Big 12, was No. 17 nationally and was third-most in program history. Additionally, WVU’s 12 team saves and 462 strikeouts also were No. 3 in the record books.\n\nNumerous Mountaineers earned national postseason awards, highlighted by junior second baseman Kyle Gray, who was recognized on the ABCA All-America Third Team. That continued a stretch of four consecutive years with an All-America honor for West Virginia. Gray was joined by fellow junior Darius Hill on the ABCA East All-Region First Team, marking the sixth consecutive year under Mazey’s leadership West Virginia has had a representative on the all-region list.\n\nEight players were named to an All-Big 12 Team, and five were honored on an Academic All-Big 12 Team.\n\nWVU also continued its streak of having several players selected in the Major League Baseball Draft, as four Mountaineers were drafted. West Virginia has had 20 draft picks in Mazey’s tenure, the most in a six-year stretch in program history.\n\nJunior Michael Grove was drafted in the second round by the Los Angeles Dodgers, Gray was selected in the 14th round by the New York Yankees, junior Jimmy Galusky was picked in the 20th round by the Chicago White Sox and senior BJ Myers was drafted by the Tampa Bay Rays in the 35th round. Grove became the fourth Mountaineer ever picked in the top two rounds and is WVU’s highest draft pick since 2010.\n\n2017\n\nThe 2017 season was WVU’s best under Mazey at the time, as the Mountaineers earned an NCAA Tournament berth for the first time since 1996 and the 12th time in program history. West Virginia went 36-26 and earned an NCAA at-large bid for the first time in program history.\n\nFollowing the record-breaking season, Mazey was named the East Regional Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) and the Chuck Tanner College Coach of the Year by the Rotary Club of Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, second-seeded WVU went 2-2 and advanced to the regional final for the third time and first since 1982, falling to top-seeded and 13th-ranked Wake Forest, which was host of the four-team regional.\n\nThe Mountaineers went 12-12 and finished in fourth in the Big 12 Conference, the No. 1 RPI conference in the country. WVU also advanced to the Big 12 Championship semifinals for the second time in as many years, going 2-2 at the conference tournament.\n\nAlong with a challenging Big 12 slate, West Virginia played 18 games against top-25 opponents, going 10-8, with all but six games against ranked foes coming on the road.\n\nOnce again under Mazey’s leadership, a record number of players earned national and conference postseason honors.\n\nSophomore designated hitter/right-handed pitcher Braden Zarbnisky was named to the NCBWA All-America Third Team, becoming the 17th All-American in team history and earning the 15th total All-America accolade under Mazey. Zarbnisky was also named the NCBWA District II Player of the Year, a John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year Award finalist and to the All-Big 12 First Team.\n\nAdditionally, junior outfielder Kyle Davis was named to the All-East Region First Team, and sophomore shortstop Jimmy Galusky was recognized on the Brooks Wallace Award Watch List.\n\nZarbnisky headlined a program-record 12 Mountaineers to earn All-Big 12 Team honors, and for the second consecutive year, WVU earned a team-record-tying four Big 12 All-Tournament Team accolades.\n\nWVU also had plenty of success in the classroom, as eight Mountaineers were named to the Academic All-Big 12 Team and another three were named to the Academic All-Big 12 Rookie Team\n\nSenior Jackson Cramer was one of 10 finalists for the Senior CLASS Award, an accolade that honors seniors for their accomplishments on the field, in the classroom, in the community and as leaders\n\nAs Mazey’s Mountaineers were having plenty of success on the field, it once again came in front of record-breaking crowds throughout the 2017 season at Monongalia County Ballpark. A total of 40,616 fans, an average of 1,846 per game, filled the stands in Morgantown, both program records. The home season was highlighted by a crowd of 3,415 that saw WVU face No. 3 TCU on April 15, the largest home crowd in team history.\n\nThe path to the pros under Mazey continued in 2017, as two players were drafted, and another signed a professional contract with a Major League organization. Junior Kyle Davis was drafted by the eventual World Series Champion Houston Astros in the 15th round of the 2017 MLB Draft and senior Jackson Cramer was picked in the 35th round by the Washington Nationals. They became the 85th and 86th draft selections in team history and the 15th and 16th picks in Mazey’s tenure, the most in a five-year stretch in team history. Additionally, senior Jackson Sigman, the only other senior on the 2017 WVU roster, signed a free agent contract with the Kansas City Royals organization.\n\n2016\n\nWith one of the youngest starting lineups in the country, Mazey led WVU to a record-breaking year in 2016, highlighted by the team’s first trip to the Big 12 Championship Game. The Mountaineers went 36-22 in Mazey’s fourth season, coming up just short of an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\nWest Virginia’s 36 wins were its most in a single season in Mazey’s tenure and the most since a 37-win campaign in 2009. A 12-11 mark in Big 12 play earned the Mountaineers the No. 4 seed in the Big 12 Championship, its second-highest seed since joining the league. WVU went 3-1 in the tournament and made its first conference title game appearance since 1996 and 11th in team history.\n\nThe Mountaineers finished the year as one of the hottest teams in the country, winning 17 of their last 21 games. The stretch included a 10-game winning streak, the longest in the country at the time and WVU’s longest since an 11-game streak in 2008.\n\nMazey won his 100th game at WVU in an 11-6 victory at Kansas on March 26. He became the fifth coach in program history to eclipse the 100-win mark and the second to accomplish the feat in his first four seasons. Additionally, Mazey’s 300th career win came in an 11-2 win over Texas on May 6.\n\nWith success on the field came plenty of recognition off of it. For the second consecutive year, two Mountaineers earned Freshman All-America honors. Right fielder Darius Hill was named to five Freshman All-America teams, while Ivan Rodriguez was recognized once.\n\nAdditionally, WVU collected a program-record 10 All-Big 12 honors, headlined by junior Chad Donato, who became the fourth Mountaineer to earn All-Big 12 First Team accolades. Four Mountaineers were named to the All-Tournament Team, the most in program history: senior KC Huth, sophomore Kyle Davis, sophomore Conner Dotson and senior Ross Vance.\n\nThroughout the year, West Virginia earned a total of 10 Big 12 weekly honors, the most in a season since WVU joined the Big 12 in 2013 and tied for the most of any school in the conference in 2016. The total included the first sweep by any Big 12 school of the Player, Pitcher and Newcomer of the Week awards on May 2.\n\nFans once again came out in record numbers to see the Mountaineers, as a total of 40,390 fans filled Monongalia County Ballpark in 2016, the highest home attendance in team history. For 30 home games, WVU averaged 1,346 fans per game, the second-highest average in program history.\n\nThe Mountaineers continued to excel in the classroom, as seven were named to the Academic All-Big 12 team, with five First Team honorees.\n\nMazey’s success of producing professional talent continued as Chad Donato and Blake Smith were selected in the 2016 MLB Draft by the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels, respectively. Ross Vance and Ray Guerrini also signed free-agent contracts with the St. Louis Cardinals and Seattle Mariners and KC Huth signed with the American Association’s Joplin Blasters.\n\n2015\n\nWith a young squad, the program’s upward progression continued in Mazey’s third season, as the Mountaineers earned a berth in the Big 12 Championship for the third consecutive season.\n\nIn the inaugural season of Monongalia County Ballpark, West Virginia finished 27-27 overall, highlighted by series wins at Clemson, at Kansas State, at Oklahoma State and vs. Texas Tech.\n\nDespite moving into its new ballpark halfway through the season, WVU broke attendance records for the third consecutive season under Mazey. A total of 33,158 fans, an average of over 1,500 per game, cheered on the Mountaineers at home, a program record.\n\nFollowing an impressive season, several Mountaineers earned national recognition. Freshmen Kyle Davis and BJ Myers had breakout campaigns and earned Freshmen All-America accolades. Davis was named to a program record five Freshman All-America teams, and Myers was named a Freshman All-American by Louisville Slugger.\n\nTwo Mountaineers were selected in the MLB Draft. Junior Blake Smith was picked in the 24th round by Washington, and senior Taylor Munden was picked by Miami in the 27th round.\n\n2014\n\nMazey continued to lead the Mountaineers in the right direction, qualifying for the Big 12 Championship for the second-straight season and narrowly missing a chance to appear in an NCAA Regional for the first time since 1996.\n\nWest Virginia finished 28-26 overall, including impressive series wins over Baylor, Oklahoma, Kansas State and Texas.\n\nOffensively, the Mountaineers ranked No. 1 in hitting (.287) amongst Big 12 teams. Individually, Bobby Boyd (.356), Billy Fleming (.351) and Ryan McBroom (.341) were ranked No. 1-3 in the Big 12 in batting average.\n\nThe pitching staff posted its lowest earned-run average (3.73) since 1974, marking the first back-to-back under 4.00 ERA seasons since 1973-74.\n\nFor the second-straight season, the Mountaineers averaged over 1,000 fans (1,098) with seven of the 15 home games featuring crowds of 1,000 or more.\n\nFollowing the season, six players were chosen in the MLB Draft, led by eighth-rounders Boyd and Harrison Musgrave\n\n2013\n\nAfter being picked to finish last in the Big 12 preseason poll, Mazey’s first season at the helm of the Mountaineers was a magical one. The team finished with a record of 33-26, including a 13-11 mark in Big 12 play, to finish third in the final conference standings and qualify for the Big 12 Championship.\n\nIt was only WVU’s fifth 30-win season since 1999 and featured Big 12 series victories against Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Texas Tech.\n\nThe fans throughout the state of West Virginia began to follow the Mountaineers, and for the first time ever, WVU ranked in the national average home figures at No. 50 (1,328). Twelve of the 21 home games featured crowds of 1,000 or more, including a Hawley Field record of 2,535 fans on April 30 against Pitt.\n\nOffensively, the Mountaineers continued their annual prowess, batting .275 as a team and smacking 32 home runs. McBroom hit a Big 12-leading 12 home runs, and left fielder Jacob Rice earned the WVU batting title with a .333 average.\n\nThe pitching staff posted its lowest earned-run average (3.88) since 1978, lowest opponent batting average (.256) since 1993 and the least earned runs allowed (226) since 2001. Musgrave became the first WVU pitcher to earn All-America honors since 1997, completing the year with a 9-1 record, posting a 2.17 ERA and tossing three complete games. In 95.1 innings of work, Musgrave struck out 81 batters and allowed just 65 hits. Musgrave also earned Big 12 Pitcher of the Year honors after earning Big 12 Pitcher of the Week four times and National Pitcher of the Week three times.\n\nPreviously obsolete, the run game changed drastically to help WVU offensively and defensively.
