Its two members are located in the states of Oregon and Washington. The Pac-12 participates at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level for all sports, and its football teams competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the highest level of NCAA football competition.\n\nThe modern Pac-12 Conference formed after the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), the principal members of which founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959. The conference previously went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, and Pacific-10. The Pac-12 moniker was adopted in 2011 with the addition of Colorado and Utah.\n\nNicknamed the \"Conference of Champions\", the Pac-12 has won more NCAA national championships in team sports than any other conference in history.[1] Washington's national title in women's rowing in 2017 was the 500th NCAA championship won by a Pac-12 school.[2]\n\nOn August 2, 2024, 10 of the 12 members departed from the conference. The Pac-12 continues to operate as a two-team conference for at least the 2024–25 academic year, sponsoring four sports – football, track & field, women's gymnastics and wrestling.[3]\n\nMember universities\n\n[edit]\n\nFull members\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Pac-12 currently has two full-member institutions.

Not only does it maintain the automatic bid from the Rose Bowl inherited from the PCC, but the eight largest schools in the old PCC all eventually joined the new league. However, the old PCC operated under a separate charter.\n\nThe Pac-12 is one of the founding members of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), a conference organized to provide competition in non-revenue Olympic sports. All-Pac-12 members participate in at least one MPSF sport (men's and women's indoor track and field both actually have enough participating Pac-12 schools for the conference to sponsor a championship, but the Pac-12 has opted not to do so). For certain sports, the Pac-12 admits certain schools as associate members.\n\nFull members Other Conference Other Conference\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPacific Coast Conference\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pacific Coast Conference\n\nThe roots of the Pac-12 Conference go back to December 2, 1915, when the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was founded at a meeting at the Imperial Hotel in Portland, Oregon.[11] Charter members were the University of California (now University of California, Berkeley), University of Washington, University of Oregon, and Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University).[11] An official of Stanford University also attended the meeting but declined to join right away because, unlike the other schools, it was not going to sponsor a football team in the coming year and it was not willing to prohibit freshmen from competing in sports.[11] The PCC began play in 1916.\n\nOne year later, Washington State College (now Washington State University) joined the league, followed by Stanford University in 1918.\n\nIn 1922, the PCC expanded to eight teams with the admission of USC and Idaho. Montana joined the Conference in 1924, and in 1928, the PCC grew to 10 members with the addition of UCLA.\n\nFor many years, the conference split into two divisions for basketball and baseball—a Southern Division comprising the four California schools and a Northern Division comprising the six schools in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn 1950, Montana departed to join the Mountain States Conference. The PCC continued as a nine-team league through June 1959.\n\nAAWU (Big Five and Big Six)\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing \"pay-for-play\" scandals at California, USC, UCLA, and Washington, the PCC disbanded in June 1959. Ten months earlier in August 1958, these four schools agreed to form a new conference that would take effect the following summer.[12][13] When the four schools and Stanford began discussions for a new conference in 1959, retired Admiral Thomas J. Hamilton interceded and suggested the schools consider creating a national \"power conference\" (Hamilton had been a key player, head coach, and athletic director at Navy, and was the current athletic director at Pittsburgh). Nicknamed the \"Airplane Conference\",[14][15][16] the five former PCC schools would have played with other major academically-oriented schools, including Army, Navy, Air Force, Notre Dame, Pitt, Penn State, and Syracuse.[14][17] The effort fell through when a Pentagon official vetoed the idea and the service academies backed out.[18]\n\nOn July 1, 1959, the new Athletic Association of Western Universities was launched, with California, UCLA, USC, and Washington as the four charter members.[19] Stanford joined during the first month.[13][20] Hamilton left Pittsburgh to become the first commissioner of the AAWU,[19][21] and remained for twelve years.[22] The conference also was popularly known as the Big Five from 1960 to 1962.[23] When Washington State joined in 1962,[24] the conference became informally known as the Big Six.[23][25] The new league inherited the PCC's berth in the Rose Bowl; since 1947, the PCC champion had received an automatic bid to the bowl.\n\nPacific-8\n\n[edit]\n\nOregon and Oregon State joined in the summer of 1964.[26][27][28] With their addition, the conference was known unofficially as the Pacific Athletic Conference,[29][30][31][32][33] and then the Pacific-8 (as there already was a major conference called the Big Eight). In 1968, the AAWU formally renamed itself the Pacific-8 Conference, or Pac-8 for short. The Pac-8 did not allow a second bowl team from the conference until the 1975 season;[34] in basketball, participation in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was not allowed until 1973.[35]\n\nIdaho was never invited to join the AAWU;[28] the Vandals were independent for four years until the formation of the Big Sky Conference in 1963, and were independent in football until 1965.\n\nPacific-10\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1978, the conference added Arizona and Arizona State from the Western Athletic Conference, becoming the Pacific-10 Conference or Pac-10. The invitations to the schools were extended in December 1976,[36] and the expansion formally announced in May 1977.[37]\n\nIn the mid-1980s, three of the northwest schools (Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State) were having financial difficulties in athletics, primarily with revenue from football, and their long-term membership in the conference was in question.[38]\n\nThe Pac-10 began sponsoring women's athletics in the fall of 1986. Women's teams previously competed with other large universities on the Pacific coast in either the Northern Pacific Conference or the Western Collegiate Athletic Association.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the conference expressed interest in admitting the University of Colorado and the University of Texas after the collapse of the Southwest Conference. Texas expressed an interest in joining a strong academic conference, but joined three fellow Southwest Conference schools (Texas A&M, Texas Tech, and Baylor) to merge with the Big Eight Conference to form the Big 12 Conference in 1996. Colorado elected to remain in the newly formed Big 12.[39]\n\nBefore the addition of Colorado and Utah in 2011, only the Ivy League had maintained its membership for a longer time than the Pac-10 among Division I conferences. Commissioner Larry Scott said on February 9, 2010, that the window for expansion was open for the next year as the conference began negotiations for a new television deal. Speaking on a conference call to introduce former Big 12 commissioner Kevin Weiberg as his new deputy, Scott talked about possibly adding new teams to the conference and launching a new television network.[40] Scott, the former head of the Women's Tennis Association, took over the conference in July 2009. In his first eight months on the job, he saw growing interest from the membership over the possibility of adding teams for the first time since Arizona and Arizona State joined the conference in 1978.\n\nPac-12\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early June 2010, there were reports that the Pac-10 was considering adding up to six teams to the conference: the University of Texas, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University, the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Colorado.[41]\n\nOn June 10, 2010, the University of Colorado Boulder accepted an invitation to join the Pac-10 Conference, effective starting with the 2012–2013 academic year.[42][43] The school later announced it would join the conference a year earlier than previously announced, in the 2011–2012 academic year.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, a deal was reached between Texas and the Big 12 Conference to keep Texas, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State in the Big 12. Following Texas' decision, the other Big 12 schools that had been rumored candidates to join the Pac-10 announced they would remain in the Big 12. This deal effectively ended the Pac-10's ambition to potentially become a sixteen-team conference.[44]\n\nOn June 17, 2010, the University of Utah accepted an invitation to join the Pac-10 Conference, effective starting July 2011.[42] Utah was a member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) with Arizona and Arizona State before those two left for the Pac-10 in 1978. The Utes left an expanded WAC with seven other schools in 1999 to form the new Mountain West Conference. Utah became the first \"BCS Buster\" to join a BCS conference, having played in (and won) two BCS games beforehand.\n\nOn July 27, 2010, the conference unveiled a new logo and announced that the Pac-10 would be renamed the Pac-12 when Utah and Colorado formally joined in July 2011. On October 21, the Pac-12 announced that its football competition would be split into two divisions—a North Division comprising the Pacific Northwest and Bay Area schools, and a South Division comprising the Mountain Time Zone and Southern California schools. On July 1, 2011, the Pac-12 assumed its 12-team alignment when both Colorado and Utah officially joined as full members.\n\nOn August 15, 2012, the conference debuted the Pac-12 Network. It was the third college sports conference to launch a dedicated network, and the first to completely fund and own their own network outright.\n\nThe conference had been based in Walnut Creek since the late 1970s until August 2014.[45] Since 2014, the conference was headquartered in San Francisco, California, with the conference moving to working remotely once the lease expires in June 2023.[46] The Pac-12 Network and meeting space for headquarters employees are now located at Bishop Ranch in San Ramon, an East Bay suburb.[47]\n\nNCAA conference realignment (2021–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 24, 2021, the Pac-12, ACC, and Big Ten announced the formation of a \"historic alliance\" that would bring their member institutions \"together on a collaborative approach surrounding the future evolution of college athletics and scheduling.\"[48] The formation of this alliance between three of the Power Five conferences was in response to Oklahoma and Texas announcing plans to leave the Big 12 and join the SEC. The alliance included an inter-conference scheduling component for football and men's and women's basketball. In 2021, the Pac-12 paid $19.8 million to its member schools, the lowest distribution in the Power Five.[49]\n\nDespite the alliance, on June 30, 2022, UCLA and USC announced their departure to the Big Ten Conference beginning in the 2024–25 academic year.[50][51] As a result of losing two of the conferences tentpole programs (and the entirety of the Los Angeles television market), the conference’s ongoing media rights negotiations became much more complicated. ESPN had reportedly made an offer where the ten remaining schools would receive around $30 million per year. This was rejected by member schools, who counter offered $50 million per school per year. ESPN responded by walking away from the negotiating table.[52]\n\nReports began circulating that Commissioner Kliavkoff had been to San Diego State University and SMU campuses for tours. This was allegedly part of the conference’s vetting process for expansion.[53] San Diego State sent the Mountain West Conference a letter notifying them of their impending departure. The Pac-12, however, was adamant about securing a media rights deal before expanding. Without an incoming offer before a June 30, 2023 deadline, San Diego State had to rescind their intention to leave the Mountain West.[54]\n\nAt the start of Pac-12 Media Days on July 21, 2023, Commissioner Kliavkoff was asked about the status of the media rights deal and conference expansion, deflecting most questions on the matter. Having heard enough, Colorado president Rick George left Media Days early to return to Boulder. Less than a week later on July 27, Colorado announced they would be returning to the Big 12 effective the 2024–25 school year.[55]\n\nThe nine remaining Pac-12 members then demanded an update on the negotiations, including numbers on expected payouts. Kliavkoff came back with a deal from the AppleTV streaming service that paid member institutions in the low to mid $20 million range, albeit with escalators for meeting subscriber quotas. On August 4, 2023, Oregon and Washington announced they would be following UCLA and USC to the Big Ten conference for the 2024 season.[56] Later on that same day, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah announced that they would follow Colorado to the Big 12 Conference starting in 2024.[57] On September 1, 2023, California and Stanford announced their departure for the Atlantic Coast Conference starting in 2024.[58]\n\nIn September 2023, Yahoo! Sports reported that the Pac-12 is \"expected to operate as a two-member conference at least for [2024]\"[59] and would be recognized under a two-year grace period, until 2026, to meet conference requirements in the NCAA bylaws.[60]\n\nOn December 5, 2023, it was announced that Oregon State and Washington State had entered into a football alliance with the Mountain West Conference (MWC) for the 2024 season. With the alliance, both programs will play 3 home games and 3 away games against MWC opponents.[61] The West Coast Conference (WCC) has invited both teams as affiliate members for basketball and most other non-football sports.[62][63] Both partnerships are expected to last from the fall of 2024 to the spring of 2026. Washington State will also participate in the Mountain West for baseball,[64] but Oregon State, a three-time College World Series champion, will become an independent.[65]\n\nAfter the ten schools depart, the conference will continue using the Pac-12 name and branding for at least the 2024–25 academic year.[66] Oregon State and Washington State were nicknamed the \"Pac-2\" by media outlets, to the point that a game between the two teams during the 2023 football season was jokingly dubbed the \"Pac-2 Championship Game\" by fans.[67][68][69]\n\nOregon State and Washington State lawsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 8, 2023, Oregon State and Washington State filed a lawsuit against the Pac-12 and Commissioner George Kliavkoff in Washington State Superior Court for control of the conference and its assets. They contended that the departing schools, under the conference constitution, forfeited their right to participate in governing the conference by publicly declaring their intention to leave, and that if they retain control they might use it to dissolve the league and drain its millions of dollars in assets.[70] On November 14, Judge Gary Libey of the Whitman County, Washington Superior Court ruled in favor of the two schools.[71] The University of Washington (UW) filed an emergency motion to keep the two schools from gaining full control of the conference for the 2023–24 academic year; a Washington Supreme Court commissioner granted UW's motion on November 28.[72] However, this was later overturned on December 15 by the Washington State Supreme Court, giving Oregon State and Washington State sole control of the Pac-12, meaning the departing schools will no longer be able to vote on conference decisions.[73]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nInstitution Academics Admissions Research U.S. News & World Report rankings Graduation rate\n\n(6-yr – 2023)[74] Retention rate\n\n(Fall 2022)[74] Admit rate\n\n(Fall 2023)[74] Yield rate\n\n(Fall 2023)[74] AAU member[75] Earned doctorates\n\n(AY2022)[76] Expenditures\n\n(millions – FY2022)[77] National\n\n(2023)[78] Global\n\n(2024)[79] Oregon State University 71% 87% 79% 20% No 290 $297.9 142 (tie) 365 (tie) Washington State University 62% 81% 85% 19% No 276 $368.40 178 (tie) 397 (tie)\n\nAthletic department revenue by school\n\n[edit]\n\nTotal revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights and licensing, student fees, school funds and all other sources including TV income, camp income, concessions, and novelties.\n\nTotal expenses includes coach and staff salaries, scholarships, buildings and grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance.\n\nThe following table shows institutional reporting to the United States Department of Education as shown on the DOE Equity in Athletics website for the 2021–22 academic year.[80]\n\nInstitution 2021–22 Total Revenue from Athletics 2021–22 Total Expenses on Athletics Oregon State University $87,727,179 $87,727,179 Washington State University $84,195,555 $82,858,720\n\nThe following table shows revenue specifically from NCAA / Conference Distributions, Media Rights, and Post-Season Football reported by the Knight Commission for the 2021–22 academic year.[81]\n\nInstitution 2021–22 Distribution (Millions of dollars) Oregon State University $42.41 Washington State University $40.61\n\nApparel\n\n[edit]\n\nSchool Provider Oregon State Nike,[82] Asics (volleyball only) Washington State Nike[83]\n\nCommissioners\n\n[edit]\n\nSince restarting in 1959 as the AAWU, the Pac-12 has had five commissioners:\n\nName Years Tenure Conference name(s) Thomas J.

USC football vacated two wins from their final two games of the 2004 season (one conference game and a bowl game) and all 12 wins from the 2005 season, as well as the conference titles from both years. Their 2004 BCS National Championship was vacated, while their 2004 Associated Press title was not removed.[141][142][143]\n\nNumber of Claimed National Championships, as well as win–loss–tie records, include all seasons played, regardless of conference membership.\n\nRivalries\n\n[edit]\n\nEach of the ten schools that were conference members before 2011 has its own in-state, conference rivalry. One is an intracity rivalry (UCLA-USC) and another is within the San Francisco/Oakland metropolitan area (California-Stanford). Colorado and Utah, who joined in 2011, were historic rivals in the Rocky Mountain region prior to 1962 when they suspended the series. These rivalries (and the name given to the football forms) are:\n\nArizona–Arizona State – The winner receives the Territorial Cup. The two universities also compete across all sports for the Territorial Cup Series.\n\nCalifornia–Stanford – Known as the Big Game, the winner receives the Stanford Axe.\n\nColorado–Utah – Known as the Rumble in the Rockies.\n\nOregon–Oregon State – Though not officially recognized by the universities, the Platypus Trophy is awarded to the winning alumni association.\n\nUCLA–USC – The winner receives the Victory Bell. The two universities compete across all sports for the SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup.\n\nWashington–Washington State – Known as the Apple Cup, the winner receives Apple Cup trophy.\n\nRivalry standings\n\n[edit]\n\nRivalry Name Standings Duel in the Desert Arizona leads, 51–45–1 The Big Game Stanford leads, 65–50–11 Rumble in the Rockies Utah leads, 35–32–3 Oregon–Oregon State Oregon leads, 68–49–10 UCLA–USC USC leads, 50–34–7 Apple Cup Washington leads, 76–33–6\n\nThe most frequently played rivalries in the conference are between Oregon and Oregon State (126 meetings through 2022) and Big Game between Stanford and California (125 meetings). These rivalries are among the most played rivalries in college football.\n\nThe two newest members, Colorado and Utah, had a football rivalry that had been dormant since 1962 – both were conference rivals previously in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (now a Division II conference) and later the now-defunct Mountain States Conference (also known as the Skyline Conference). Even after Colorado joined what became the Big 12 in 1948 (the conference was then known popularly as the Big 7 Conference), the two schools continued their football rivalry for over a decade before ending it after the 1962 season. With the two schools being placed in the same division for football starting in 2011, the rivalry was revived with their 58th meeting during the 2011 season.\n\nAll of the California schools consider each other major rivals due to the culture clash between Northern and Southern California.[144] California and UCLA have a rivalry rooted in their shared history as the top programs within the University of California system. Stanford and USC have a rivalry rooted in their shared history as the only private schools in the Pac-12. California and USC also have a long history, playing each other beginning in 1915.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest schools of Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, and Washington State all consider each other major rivals due to their proximity and long history; a sweep of the other 3 teams is known as the Northwest Championship. The Oregon–Washington rivalry is sometimes referred to as the Border War.[145]\n\nArizona and New Mexico have a recently renewed rivalry game, based upon when they were both members of the WAC and both states were longtime territories before being admitted as states in 1912. They played for the Kit Carson Rifle trophy, which was no longer used starting with their meeting in the 1997 Insight Bowl.[146][147]\n\nUSC and Notre Dame have an intersectional rivalry (See Notre Dame–USC rivalry). The games in odd-numbered years are played at Notre Dame Stadium in mid-October, while the games in even-numbered years are played at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, usually in late November.\n\nStanford and Notre Dame also have an intersectional rivalry (See Notre Dame–Stanford football rivalry). The schedule of the Stanford–Notre Dame rivalry mirrors that of USC–Notre Dame. The games in even-numbered years are played at Notre Dame in mid-October, while the games in odd-numbered years are played at Stanford in late November.\n\nThe isolated rural campuses of Washington State and Idaho are eight miles (13 km) apart on the Palouse, creating a natural border war known as the Battle of the Palouse. Idaho rejoined FBS in 1996 and was a member until 2017.\n\nUtah and BYU have a fierce rivalry nicknamed the Holy War that goes back to 1896.\n\nColorado also has a rivalry with in-state rival Colorado State called the Rocky Mountain Showdown.\n\nWith the NCAA permanently approving 12-game schedules in college football beginning in 2006, the Pac-10—alone among major conferences in doing so—went to a full nine-game conference schedule. Previously, the schools did not play one non-rival opponent, resulting in an eight-game conference schedule (four home games and four away). In 2010, the last season before the arrival of Colorado and Utah, the only other BCS conference that played a round-robin schedule was the Big East. The schedule consisted of one home and away game against the two schools in each region, plus the game against the primary in-state rival.\n\nDivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Pac-12 Football Championship Game\n\nOn October 21, 2010, the Pac-10 announced the creation of divisions and a championship game in football, to be used when Colorado and Utah joined the conference effective July 1, 2011. The twelve members were split into two divisions for football only: a North Division comprising the Pacific Northwest and Bay Area schools, and a South Division comprising the Mountain Time Zone and Los Angeles schools.[148]\n\nA nine-game conference schedule was maintained, with five games within the assigned division and four games from the opposite division. The four California teams, noted in the table in gray, still played each other every season— consequently, the four non-California teams in each division will only play one of the two California teams from the opposite division each year.\n\nThe Pac-12 Football Championship Game featured the North Division Champion against the South Division Champion for the first 11 years of its existence, with divisional champions determined based on record in all conference games (both divisional and cross-divisional). However, on May 18, 2022, the NCAA Division I Council announced that conferences would no longer be required to maintain divisions in order to hold a conference championship. As a result, later that same day, the Pac-12 announced that it would eliminate its divisions for the 2022 football season and beyond, with the championship game instead featuring the two Pac-12 teams with the highest winning percentage.[149] It was the first FBS conference to scrap its divisions as a result of this change.\n\nNorth Division South Division Oregon Arizona Oregon State Arizona State Washington Colorado Washington State Utah California UCLA Stanford USC\n\nBowl games\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2023 college football season, the following is the selection order of bowl games with Pac-12 tie-ins.

For several years, it was one of a small number of non-conference games in Division I basketball that was played twice a season (home-and-away). The most famous game in the rivalry was on January 19, 1974, when Notre Dame scored the last 12 points of the game to nip UCLA and end the Bruins' record 88-game winning streak. This rivalry is now dormant, partly because Notre Dame is no longer independent in sports other than football (now in the ACC).\n\nIn baseball, there are intense rivalries between the four southern schools. Arizona, Arizona State, and USC have long and successful histories in baseball and all have won national titles in the sport. The most intense series is widely regarded to be the \"Basebrawl\" series between USC and Arizona State in 1990. Arizona State swept the series and in the final game a bench clearing brawl spread quickly to the stands and made national headlines. Several were injured and riot police were called to end the fracas.\n\nWashington and California have a longstanding rivalry in men's crew as the two traditionally dominant programs on the West Coast.\n\nDue to the unique geographic nature of the Pac-12 teams, the teams travel in pairs for road basketball games. For example, on Thursday, February 28, 2008, USC played Arizona and UCLA played Arizona State. Two nights later the teams switched and USC played Arizona State and UCLA played Arizona. The teams are paired as follows: USC and UCLA (the L.A. teams), Arizona and Arizona State (the Arizona teams), California and Stanford (the Bay Area teams), Washington and Washington State (the Washington teams), Oregon and Oregon State (the Oregon teams), and Colorado and Utah (the Rocky Mountain teams). Usually, the games are played on Thursdays and Saturdays with a game or occasionally two on Sundays for television purposes. This pairing formula is also used in women's volleyball. To make scheduling simpler for men and women's basketball (a sport in which each conference member uses a single venue for both teams' home games), the schedule for women's basketball is the opposite of the men's schedule. For example, when the Oregon schools are hosting the men's teams from the Arizona schools, the Arizona schools host the women's teams from Oregon schools the same weekend.\n\nThis formula has made a tradition in conference play to keep track of how a team does against a particular region; and stats are kept as to how successful a team is against, for example, \"the Bay Area schools\" at home or away. Effective in the 2011–12 season, with the expansion into 12 teams, a 10-year rotation model has been developed to maintain the existing 18-game conference schedule. Teams remained paired with their regional rival. Each school plays its regional rival and six other teams both home and away, and the other four teams once – two at home and two away. The newest members, Colorado and Utah, are paired with each other. The single play opponents rotate every two years.[160]\n\nRecently, Cal Poly and UCLA has grown into a competitive Men's Soccer rivalry with Cal Poly hosting UCLA in a 0–0 tie in front of a crowd of 8,717 which at the time was the 9th largest regular season, on-campus attendance in the history of college soccer.[161] The schools have played several times since; however, UCLA has not returned to San Luis Obispo for a Friday or Saturday game since tying Cal Poly in front of a record crowd. UCLA leads the series 6–2–2.[162]\n\nOlympians\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a 2017 study by OlympStats, USA Olympians and the medals they won were counted and sorted by their college affiliations.[163][164] Stanford led all schools with 289 athletes, 408 games, and 282 total medals won. UCLA was second, USC was third, California was 4th, Harvard was 5th in each category, respectively.\n\nLeading the country with the most participants in their respective events are, Colorado in Alpine Skiing and Cycling, Arizona State in Archery and Badminton, Stanford in Baseball, Rugby, Swimming, Tennis and Water Polo, UCLA in Basketball, Beach Volleyball, Gymnastics and Softball, USC in Athletics and Volleyball, and Utah in Freestyle Skiing.\n\nSince 1924 a PAC-12 school has led the country in the number of athletes in every Summer Olympic Games as of the 2017 study.[164]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
