The Owls captured both the Conference USA regular season and post-season tournament titles. Prairie View is making its second consecutive appearance in the NCAA tournament, thanks to winning the SWAC Tournament. . Rice has advanced to the Super Regionals six times (1999, 2001, '02, '03, '05 and `06) and to the College World Series five times (1997, '99, 2002, '03 and `06).\n\nFriday's losing teams play Saturday at 2 pm and the two winners meet at 6 pm. A second elimination game will be played at 2 pm Sunday followed by a 6 pm game that could decide the regional champion. If a second championship game is needed, it will be played at 6 pm on Monday (June 5).\n\nAudio Broadcast Info.  All Games Now On KTRU (91.7 FM)\n\nEvery game for the remainder of the season is set for a live broadcast on the radio in the Houston area on KTRU, 91.7 FM, and around the world on the Internet. A direct link to the audio feed is provided above and on the baseball schedule page. Veteran broadcaster Dan Perez has the Rice call for the remaining games. National Champion broadcaster Jonathan Yardley returns to the booth to sit in with the call of Saturday's game.\n\nNational Ranking Update  Rice Consensus No. 2\n\nThe Owls began the year with a preseason ranking of number one in the nation. The team has held a top ten ranking for most of the year and is now second in each of the latest polls. This week's ranking roll call is as follows....\n\nBaseball America: second\n\nCollegiate Baseball: second\n\nNational Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA): second\n\nRivals.com: second\n\nUSA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll: second\n\nThe Owls had the preseason No. 1 ranking on the strength of seven starters returning to the regular lineup as well 11 experienced pitchers back in 2007. The newcomers making their Rice debut in 2007 were tabbed as among the best recruiting classes in the country by a host of baseball publications.\n\nHigh R.P.I.\n\nThe Rice baseball team has a lofty perch in the various polls, but that's nothing compared to the official NCAA Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) report released by the NCAA on May 27. As of May 27 the Owls have Division Baseball's highest RPI in the country. The RPI is one of the key factors used by the NCAA to select and seed teams for the national postseason tournament. View the NCAA Baseball RPI site\n\nHead Coach Wayne Graham\n\nThree-time national coach of the year and Texas Sports Hall of Fame inductee Wayne Graham (Texas, 1970) is in his 16th season at Rice... He is 733-282 with the Owls (449-96 at home, 219-147 in road games and 65-39 at neutral sites). Graham has reached two notable milestones this season. On March 17 he won his 700th game at Rice. On May 11 he won his 1,300th career game as a collegiate head coach... His overall winning percentage is .722, the best in school history. Another way of looking at Graham's .722 win percentage is that it is the equivalent of a major league team winning 117 games in a single year... Graham's record against Prairie View is 6-0 (all home). His record against Baylor is 27-17 (16-7 home, 7-9 road, 4-1 neutral) and his record against TCU is 38-18 (20-6 home, 12-10 road, 6-2 neutral)... Under Graham, the Owls clinched another automatic postseason bid in 2007, making 13-straight seasons for Rice to earn an NCAA appearance. The 2003 bid culminated with the Owls' first national championship. Rice played in the 1994-95-96 Southwest Conference tournaments (winning the final league title in '96), won the 1997-98-99 WAC tournaments, shared the 2000 WAC title with San Jose State before winning the 2001-02-03-04-05 titles outright. He won the C-USA regular season crowns in 2006 and 2007, as well as the C-USA tournament championships in 2006 and 2007. Rice has advanced into the NCAA tournament in 1995-96-97-98-99-00-01-02-03-04-05-06-07... Graham was named the WAC coach of the year in 1998, '99, '02 and the co-coach of the year in '03. He was named the Keith LeClair C-USA Coach of the Year in 2006 and `07, his first two years in the league... Rice has made five appearances in the NCAA College World Series under Graham (1997, '99, `02, `03, `06)... Graham has led the Owls to number-one rankings for seven weeks during the 1999 season, for six weeks during the '01 campaign, two weeks in '02, six weeks in 2003 (the last of which established some staying power), three weeks in 2004 and 12 weeks in 2006... Graham's San Jacinto Gators dominated the NJCAA World Series in Grand Junction, Colo., in the 1980s, winning five national titles in six years (1985-86-87, 89-90)... The Austin American-Statesman named Graham its SWC coach of the year in '95 after he led the Owls to their first NCAA tournament appearance... Collegiate Baseball was especially cognizant of Graham's efforts at San Jac. He was named the newspaper's coach of the decade for all levels in the 1980s after winning those five junior college national titles, and CB tabbed him the NJCAA coach of the century... One of the few current collegiate coaches to have played in the major leagues (N.Y. Mets in 1963, Philadelphia in 1964), Graham is aided by assistant coaches Mike Taylor (Prairie View A&M, 1997; seventh year), David Pierce (Houston, 1988; fifth year), Patrick Hallmark (Rice, 1995; second year)... Graham will coach at third base. Taylor will be at first base.\n\n1,308 Wins  A Baseball Odyssey\n\nWayne Graham owns 733 career wins at Rice, but he also has 1,308 victories when including his 11 years at San Jacinto North College where he won five national championships. Graham's overall collegiate record is 1,308-395 in a 26-year career that began in 1981.\n\n12-Straight Conference Titles\n\nRice won the C-USA Tournament championship with a big 16-8 road win over East Carolina on May 27, just a little more than two weeks after clinching the regular season title on May 11 with a home win over Tulane at Reckling Park... The championship is the team's 12th in a row dating back to 1996. Rice won nine-straight Western Athletic Conference championships in baseball from 1997-2005, as well as the final Southwest Conference Tournament crown before that league disbanded (1996)... In addition to winning seven WAC regular season titles, Rice was also a perfect 12-0 in winning three WAC tournaments in 1997, 1998 and 1999.\n\n13-Straight NCAA Appearances\n\nRice is making its 13th-consecutive trip to the NCAA Championship, the fifth-longest active streak in Division I. Here is a look at the longest active streaks:\n\n35 Miami (Fla.)\n\n30 Florida State\n\n21 Clemson\n\n16 Cal State Fullerton\n\n13 Rice Owls\n\nJust Win\n\nHeading into the NCAA Tournament, Rice is tied for second in the nation with Wichita State in wins (49). The Owls also have the fifth-best record (49-12, .802) of any college team in the country.\n\nIn Search Of The Big \"Five-0\"\n\n12-Straight Seasons With 40+ Wins\n\nRice is striving to reach to reach the 50-win plateau for a fifth time since 1999. Rice currently has its third-highest win total in school history heading into the NCAA's behind last season's 50-win squad and the 1999 squad that won 52 prior to regional play.... The Owls also clinched their 13th-straight 40-win season. In fact, limiting it to just 40 wins shortchanges it a bit. Rice has won at least 42 games a year in every season since 1995. The team has also won at least 46 games in 10 of the last 11 campaigns.\n\n30-of-32\n\nRice has won 30-of-32 games since March 30. The Owls have hit 110 points better than their opponents during the stretch (.343 to .233) and averaged 8.4 runs per game. The home run ratio has been 3-to-1 in Rice's favor."
