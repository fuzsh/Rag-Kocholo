        "text": "Courtesy of San José State Athletics\n\nFRESNO, Calif.—Left-handed pitcher Jack White earned two saves to lead the San José State baseball team (30-25, 18-11 MW) in an 11-8 win over No. 4 seed Fresno State (30-27, 16-14 MW) and a 7-5 win over No. 3 seed Air Force (28-29, 17-13 MW) on Saturday at the Mountain West Championship. The Spartans move on to Sunday and will face Air Force for the Mountain West Championship title.\n\nVS. FRESNO STATE\n\nJack Colette was a triple shy of the cycle, going 4-for-4 with a walk.\n\nColette, Robert Hamchuk, James Shimashita and Charles McAdoo all hit home runs.\n\nRobert Hamchuk and Theo Hardy each produced three hits.\n\nMatt Spear recorded two hits, one of which was an RBI double.\n\nRight-handed pitcher Cade Van Allen earned the win, tossing 4.1 innings and allowing only two runs on three hits while striking out four.\n\nWhite entered in the ninth inning and struck out two for the save.\n\nVS. AIR FORCE\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Ethan Ross tossed 7.0 innings, allowing four earned runs on nine hits while striking out seven to earn the win.\n\nWhite picked up the save with 2.0 scoreless innings of relief, striking out three.\n\nThe Spartans scored five runs in the bottom of the seventh inning after going down 5-2.\n\nHunter Dorraugh and Dalton Bowling hit back-to-back solo home runs in the seventh inning.\n\nDorraugh’s home run was his third blast of the championship and 25th of his career. He moves into a tie for second all-time with John Fagan (2000-01) for most career home runs by a Spartan.\n\nBowling’s home run was his team-leading 11th of the season.\n\nBowling and Hamchuk each registered three hits.\n\nUP NEXT: The No. 1 seed Spartans and No. 3 seed Air Force will duel for the Mountain West Championship title on Sunday, May 28 at 1 p.m. Watch the contest on the Mountain West Network.\n\nClick here to build your One Spartan Nation membership."
