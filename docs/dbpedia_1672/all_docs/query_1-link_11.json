Utah won the tie-breaker for the No. 3 seed in the Mountain West Tournament by winning four of the six games in the season series with the Lobos. The Utes finished five games behind second-place San Diego State and 7-1/2 games behind first-place BYU.\n\nAfter losing four of six in conference play, Utah took two of three from New Mexico last Thursday through Saturday at Franklin Covey Field. Utah won the first game of the series 7-6 and took the third game 5-3. The Lobos won the middle game 8-6.\n\nUtah is second in the MWC with a .315 team batting average. The Utes are the conference leaders in slugging percentage (.528), hits (623), doubles (132), home runs (82) and total bases (1043). Seven Utes have a batting average above .300, led by Chris Shelton's .372. Shelton also leads the team in home runs (16). Nate Weese sets the pace in RBI (62).\n\nThe Utes' 6.19 ERA is third-best in the conference. Travis Palmer has a 5.77 ERA. Ryan Bailey leads the team in wins with a 7-5 record. Matt McAfee has four saves with a 2.96 ERA in 18 relief appearances.\n\nScouting New Mexico\n\nThe Lobos are 24-32 overall and finished tied for third place in the Mountain West Conference with a 14-16 record. Before losing two of three to Utah last weekend, the Lobos had won five of their last six in league play.\n\nTroy Cairns leads the team with a .352 batting average and 24 doubles. Anthony Lovato is hitting .342 with a team-best 41 RBI. Chris Cooper is 5-7 in 16 starts with a 5.52 ERA. He also has 78 strikeouts in 104-1/3 innings.\n\nConference Tournament History\n\nThe Utes have played in two previous conference tournaments with a 1-4 record. Utah made its first appearance in the WAC Tournament in 1997, losing to Fresno State (6-3) and Rice (5-4). Last year in the Mountain West Conference Tournament, the Utes went 1-2. Utah lost to Brigham Young (9-6) in the first round, defeated New Mexico (6-4) and lost to Air Force (10-5).\n\nNew Mexico Series Review\n\nUtah took two of three games from New Mexico last weekend at Franklin Covey Field to clinch a tie for third place in the Mountain West Conference and take four of six from the Lobos on the season.\n\nUtah won 7-6 in the opener on Thursday. With the score tied 2-2, Sam Swenson homered in the bottom of the fourth inning. After the Lobos tied the game 3-3 in the top of the fifth, the Utes added three runs in the bottom half of the inning to regain the lead, 6-3, as Donnie Saba, Adam Castleton and Nate Weese drove in runs. After New Mexico tied the game again in the top of the sixth, Swenson scored on a balk by New Mexico pitcher Marvin Wong. Swenson scored three runs in the game. Matt McAfee earned the win after coming in during the sixth inning to improve to 1-2 on the season.\n\nSenior night on Friday was spoiled with an 8-6 loss. Ryan Bailey started the game for Utah, but was jolted early as he gave up a home run on the second pitch of the game. Utah jumped ahead 2-1 in the bottom of the first inning after Chris Shelton doubled to drive in two runs. The Utes added two more in the bottom of the second off of Josh France's two-run homer. However, the Lobos added runs in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth innings to lead 7-4. Utah added another run in the bottom of the sixth when Saba hit a home run. Saba went 4-for-5 from the plate with one RBI and two runs scored. Shelton and France added two RBI each. Bailey got the loss to fall to 7-5 after allowing six runs, 11 hits and three walks.\n\nJason Wylie gave up only two earned runs off eight hits and struck out four in eight innings to give Utah a 5-3 win on Saturday. Castleton, who went 3-for-4 in the game with three runs scored, hit a solo home run in the bottom of the first to stake Utah to a 1-0 lead. It was Castleton's fourth big fly of the season. Utah rocked Jeremy DeYapp for three runs in the eighth. Weese, Swenson and Brit Pannier all drove in runs for the Utes as the Lobos went through four pitchers. Wylie improved to 4-3 with the win. Mitch Maio retired the Lobos in order in the top of the ninth to pick up his third save.\n\nHead Coach Tim Esmay\n\nThe Utes are under the direction of fifth-year head coach Tim Esmay. Esmay is 133-139-1 overall and 71-77 in conference games entering the Mountain West Conference Tournament. The Utes went 26-27 overall and tied for third place in the MWC with a 14-16 mark during the regular season.\n\nIn his first season directing the Utah baseball program, Esmay did what no Ute coach had done in 32 years when he led Utah to a WAC division title and a 36-21-1 record in 1997. The Utes posted a 22-8 record in the WAC Northern Division that year. In his second year as head coach, the Utes finished with a 23-31 record and went 12-18 in the WAC to place third in the WAC Northern Division. In 1999, the Utes finished 22-30 with an 8-20 WAC record. Last year, Utah compiled a 26-30 record while going 15-15 in the new MWC. Esmay guided the Utes to a third-place finish in the conference, equaling the second-best of his tenure. A seasoned player in his own right, Esmay played at Arizona State from 1986-87 and was a member of the ASU team that appeared in the 1987 College World Series.\n\nSluggin' Shelton\n\nIn the NCAA statistics released on May 7, designated hitter/catcher Chris Shelton was tied for 23rd in home runs (0.33 per game). Shelton ranks fourth in the Mountain West Conference and leads the team in hitting with a .372 batting average. He is also Utah's leader in RBI (60), home runs (16), doubles (22) and slugging percentage (.729).\n\nShelton had a 21-game hitting streak before going hitless in the second game of the doubleheader against Albertson College on May 1. During the steak, he hit .483 (42-for-87) with multiple hits in 16 of those contests. After the streak was broken, Shelton went 3-for-5 with two home runs and three RBI in game one of the San Diego State series on May 4. In the UNLV series (April 27-29), Shelton went 4-for-13 with eight RBI, two home runs and four runs scored.\n\nSwingin' Sammy\n\nSenior center fielder Sam Swenson has become Utah's all-time leader in hits (225), triples (15), runs scored (185), total bases (403) and at bats (713) this season. In 2001, the South Jordan, Utah, native ranks in the top 10 in the Mountain West Conference in 10 offensive categories, including sixth in hitting with a .361 average, tied for fifth with 50 RBI and fourth with 13 home runs. Last season, he hit .339 and legged out a school-record 7 triples while earning first-team all-conference honors.\n\nOh My, Maestas\n\nSenior Tommy Maestas has saved his best for last at Utah. Joining the Utes last season after playing two years at Trinidad State Junior College, this shortstop hit .214 in 12 games in 2000. This season, he has become a fixture in the line-up. He has started 48 games, hitting .332 (fourth-best on the team) with 15 doubles, three home runs and 29 RBI. He also has a .954 fielding percentage.\n\nBack-to-Back Wins for Wylie\n\nSophomore righthander Jason Wylie has posted wins in his last two starts to improve his record to 4-3. Last Saturday, Wylie pitched the Utes to a 5-3 win over New Mexico. He threw eight innings, giving up two earned runs off of eight hits and striking out four. On May 12 against San Diego State, Wylie gave up two runs off just five hits with six strikeouts in seven innings in a 13-3 win.\n\nRepeat Performers\n\nDesignated hitter/catcher Chris Shelton leads the team with 28 multiple hits games this season. Sam Swenson and Mike Westfall are second on that list with 22. Shelton also leads the club with 19 multiple RBI games, including 10 games with three or more.\n\nTake Note of These Utes\n\n- Adam Castleton (2B) takes a five-game hitting streak into the Mountain West Conference Tournament.
