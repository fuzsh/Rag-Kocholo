        "text": "Nevada football saw its two-game win streak snapped last week with a home loss to Hawaii, which was bad. But I randomly had a piece of one of my central incisors (aka front two teeth) fall out last week, so it could have been worse for the Wolf Pack. It was the day after Halloween, and I was literally doing nothing but working when I noticed a piece of my tooth was missing. I wasn't biting into hard candy. I wasn't trying to split two Lego pieces apart with my teeth. And I wasn't trying to break into a plastic wrapper. I've done all of those things and never had a piece of my tooth disappear. But it happened as I was sitting at my desk typing a story. So, at least Nevada's football players have all their teeth. Or at least I can assume so. Things can always be worse. Anyway, onto this week's Monday Mailbag. Thanks, as always, for the questions.\n\nI'd set the over/under at 3.5 and take the under. Between San Diego State, Boise State, New Mexico and Nevada, I think three teams get in. The Mountain West is coming off back-to-back four-bid seasons, although both times the conference had a team in the First Four, so it was close to being a three-bid league. The MW generally hasn't done much in non-conference play in terms of securing Quad 1 and Quad 2 losses, but it has earned good NET rankings, which means teams can build theirrésumés almost entirely off conference play (see Nevada last year). The conference needs a lot to go right to build a strong conference NET with middling non-conference results, so one or two little things can throw the league off from hitting four bids again. Before this current stretch, it went six straight seasons with two bids or fewer. I do think the MW will have a solid season, but I'm going with three bids instead of four.\n\nI have Nevada fourth in , and the Wolf Pack was in fourth in the overall preseason MW media ballot. I see the MW having three tiers at the top, including:\n\nTier I: Boise State and San Diego State\n\nTier II: New Mexico and Nevada\n\nTier III: UNLV and Colorado State\n\nThose are your six MW postseason contenders. Nevada could finish anywhere from first to sixth in the MW and I would not be shocked. The top of the conference is pretty tightly bound.\n\n1) No injuries\n\n2) Nevada improves defensively (top 50 in KenPom)\n\n3) Two players other than Jarod Lucas are reliable 3-point shooters (two non-Lucas players hit 50-plus threes at a 35 percent or better clip)\n\n4) One of the frontcourt pieces (Nick Davidson, K.J. Hymes, Jazz Gardner, Jeriah Coleman)emerges as an All-Mountain West-caliber player\n\n5) The MW ranks seventh or worse in conference NET, thus making the in-league competition more palpable\n\nIn terms of Caleb Williams crying after the loss to Washington, I don't see that as a bad thing. It shows he cares even though his team had already been eliminated from College Football Playoff contention. You want your players to care. at a picture of TCU quarterback Max Duggan crying after a loss last season set him up as a target for doing the same thing last weekend.\n\nMy preferred analytics site is , which has the following win-loss projections for MW teams this season (note: the record does not include games against TBD opponents in multiple-team events, which for Nevada means two games in the Diamond Head Classic).\n\n1. San Diego State — 22-8/13-5\n\n2. New Mexico — 22-9/11-7\n\n3t. Nevada — 19-11/10-8\n\n3t. Colorado State — 19-11/10-8\n\n3t. Boise State — 18-10/10-8\n\n3t. UNLV — 18-10/10-8\n\n7t. Fresno State — 17-13/8-10\n\n7t. Utah State — 16-13/8-10\n\n7t. San Jose State — 16-13/8-10\n\n10. Air Force — 15-15/6-12\n\n11. Wyoming — 9-19/4-14\n\nBarttorvik.com gives Nevada an 18.4 percent chance of reaching the NCAA Tournament's round of 64. Sweet 16 odds are2.5 percent.\n\nA reminder last year Nevada freshman Trey Pettigrew had 12 points, three steals, two assists and a rebound in 19 minutes. He made 4-of-8 shots. And then he played sparingly in the offseason, transferred to Bradley this summer and . I'm not saying that's what is going to happen with this year's freshmen, but I wouldn't read too much into exhibition stats. That said, Tyler Rolison seems like the real deal. He could get 20-plus minutes per game and syphon some playing time away from Hunter McIntosh, Tyler Powell and Daniel Foster. Given Nevada is going to lose McIntosh, Jarod Lucas and Kenan Blackshear to graduation after this season (that's the team's top-three guards), I would play Rolison 20-plus minutes per game this season so he's ready to take over as the team's lead guard next year. As for the other two freshmen, Jazz Gardner and Amire Robinson, Gardner has a good skillset for a 7-footer and needs to fill out his frame. His playing time will hinge on his defense, so let's say 8 to 10 minutes per game. Robinson is further down the depth chart, so his playing time will be more muted. He might not be in the rotation, but he has drawn three charges in Nevada's two exhibitions this year, so he's ready to do the dirty work.\n\nLucas discussed the Wolf Pack freshmen (and a lot more) in our \"Inside the Den\" video podcast last week, which is worth a listen. That's below.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much. Obviously you don't want an exhibition game against a below-.500 Division II school from a season ago (Stan State went 10-18 last year) to come down to the last possession. But Nevada's 2003-04 Sweet 16 team lost an exhibition to Humboldt State and the team's 2018-19 squad that started the season 24-1 and was ranked as high as No. 5 in the nation also lost an exhibition (it was spanked by Washington). Coach Steve Alford was going through the death of his college coach, Bob Knight, so the team's pre-game routine was messed up (Alford didn't speak to the team before the game as he normally would, per Lucas' interview above). In terms of talent level, this year's Nevada team and last year's Nevada team is pretty similar. This year's team might be a little less talented but should be deeper. And the Wolf Pack's hope is there are more defensive pieces on this year's team, so the gaps are filled in better.\n\nNo, I don't agree with those. I have Boise State No. 1 in the MW, so the Broncos being two tiers below New Mexico and SDSU don't jive with my rankings. I'd also put \"Arkansas\" in the elite category. Nevada in \"good for sure\" territory seems fine.\n\nWell, Ken Wilson answered this one for us and notes the 14 locals dressed for Nevada's game against Hawaii. You can see that list below.\n\nObviously Wilson is going to get some criticism considering Nevada is 4-17 during his tenure. But he deserves zero criticism for his recruitment of local players. I've covered four Nevada football coaches, and Wilson has most ardently recruited locals. The coaches who recruited locals the least during my time covering the team (Chris Ault, Jay Norvell) had the most success. That's the same in Nevada baseball (T.J. Bruce recruited locals the least and won two Mountain West titles). I'm all for giving locals walk-on spots and having them earn their way to a scholarship. But anybody who thinks a heavy-local team is going to compete for MW football title is misguided. Wilson has more than gone out of his way to recruit local players. In fact, of any coach I've covered in any sport, I think he's recruited locals the most. Maybe Josh Taylor in softball recruited more local products. But Wilson is near the top of the list. He deserves zerocriticism for how he's treated local prospects.\n\nI did ask Wilson about this tweet at his Monday press conference, and this is what he had to say.\n\n\"I don't often respond to social media, but I thought that was not correct information,\" Wilson said. \"We work really hard. We have 125 guys on our team. We can travel 74 of them. We dress another 15 for home games. That a lot has to do with what they do in practice, if they're going to play in the game. There's guys that don't go to the hotel with us on Friday that actually play in the game. We're constantly elevating guys like Donoven DeRicco (from Bishop Manogue), who's played on special teams the last two weeks. It doesn't matter if they're a scholarship guy, a walk-on guy, we love them all the same. We treat them all the same, We prepare them all the same. And I think our guys respect us for that.\n\n\"I know that locker room and how their hearts are and I know the coaches that coach them. We dress the best players that we can dress every week, and there's a lot of local talent in there. We love the Battle Born guys just as much as we love everybody else. I thought it was important when I responded to that to put in there how many Northern Nevada guys dressed and how many of them played. Some of them were walk-ons, some of them were scholarship guys, but those were the guys that for that week earned a chance, and that changes every week. You've got guys that are coming up on their fourth game of the redshirt year. We don't want to burn redshirt years if we don't have to. There's all those things that go into who's dressing, who's going to the hotel, who's getting on the airplane, and you're trying to get the best guys and show respect to the guys that are practicing hard.\n\n\"Not everybody that they practice hard gets the dress for every game. I wish they could. But if we dress 125 guys and try to prepare 125 guys on a half a field and put them in the coaches box, you wouldn't be able to move in there. We're just not able to do it. But we try to get the the guys that we can dressed and show respect to those guys constantly. That's why that's ever changing. We just can't dress everybody. But we dress a lot of them, and we dress more here than in a lot of places I've been. In a lot of places, you just dress the 74 that travel. We don't feel like that's right. We want to reward the guys that are practicing hard, that have a chance to play that might get on the field. We want to get them out there on the sideline. That means a lot to me, and that didn't hit me right. I'll take credit for a lot of negative stuff around here but not that.\"\n\nNevada linebacker Jackson LaDuke also weighed in on the topic while backing his coach.\n\nNobody else on the offensive staff has play-calling experience, so I don't see how that fixes things. A reassessment after the season if Ken Wilson gets a third year is certainly in order. But changing your coordinator with three games left in the season feels like a panic move that's not going to happen.\n\nAt this stage, A.J. Bianco is the more high-risk, high-reward option at quarterback for Nevada. I asked Ken Wilson at his press conference today who would start against Utah State, and he said it's an open competition with a decision to be made early this week. That's the first time he's not just said Lewis is starting. So, my guess is Bianco will start against the Aggies. Myinterpretation for the quarterback competition? If Wilson felt comfortable with his job security, he should turn it over to Bianco, who is going to take more sacks and turn it over more often than Lewis because (a) he's young and (b) he holds the ball and takes risks because he wants to get it downfield. But Bianco also is capable of doing more in the pass game than Lewis, whose advantage is (a) he's a slightly better runner (both good in that area); (b) isn't going to turn it over as often; and (c) throws a better deep ball. But Lewis has been given nine games to clearly win the job and he hasn't done so, so while he might give Nevada a little better shot to win games this year, Bianco is the future.\n\nThe bigger issue is Lewis and Shane Illingworth before him were far more productive at their previous schools than Nevada. At Colorado, Lewis had a117.5 quarterback rating. At Nevada, he has a 97.0quarterback rating. Illingworth had a139.1 quarterback rating at Oklahoma State and102.4 rating at Nevada. Not a good sign.\n\nClemson offensive coordinator Garrett Riley (brother of USC's Lincoln Riley) makes $1.75 million a year. Ohio State offensive coordinator Brian Hartline makes $1.6 million annually. Nevada has never paid a football coach even $1 million. So, no, I don't think that's a fit. Even if Nevada could stretch to $1.3 million, that's way under what those guys already make. Barry Odom did take a small pay cut to go from Arkansas' defensive coordinator to UNLV's head coach (from $1.85 million to $1.75 million with two built in raises of $250,000 each), but he was still made the highest-paid head coach in the MW.\n\nI'd set the over/under at 2.5 and take the under (I think it will be two, although three is not out of the question).\n\nI was unable to find that in any quick Google searches, so I don't know. But for UNLV's sake, hopefully it's high.\n\nIt hinges a little on that buyout number, but I'll say 20 percent. Most schools would want a little more proof of concept given Barry Odom's so-so stint at Missouri. But I think you could make a legitimate case UNLV is the Mountain West's best team. Will the Rebels make the MW championship game? Unlikely. But this is a very good team, so give Odom a lot of credit. Turning a perennial loser into a MW contender in one year is super impressive and will catch the attention of Power 5 schools. If he does it again next year, he'll almost certainly be scooped up.\n\nIf you're a Nevada season-ticket holder, I think your top priority would be having Mackay Stadium as packed a possible. If you're already a big enough supporter to buy a season ticket, you probably want a good gameday experience. And season tickets start at $89. Single-game tickets start at $25 for the lower-level games and $30 for the priority games. That's a minimum of around $160 if you buy single tickets to all the games, so season-ticket holders already get a pretty good discount compared to per-game costs.\n\nWrite your state senator.\n\nFinish 2-10: 85 percent\n\nFinish 3-9: 40 percent\n\nFinish 4-8: 1 percent\n\nFinish 5-7: 0 percent\n\nThat's based on zero inside info.\n\nThe biggest hurdle is the Washington State situation. Nick Rolovich was fired by Wazzu for not adhering to the state of Washington's COVID-19 vaccine requirement forstate employees and then sued Washington State, Cougars AD Pat Chun and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who issued the mandate. earlier this year. I don't know that Nevada would want to get involved with this situation when other quality candidates are surely available.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't agree that the players look confused on the field. I've not seen that.\n\nIt'd be the south end zone, and it'd be an addition to Cashell Fieldhouse and the Wolf Pack locker room, strength center and coaches offices. Many college football stadiums are connected to their offices. At Mackay, there's a small gap (like 35 yards). But connecting the two would make some sense even if it's not a top priority.\n\nTheOrmsby House is never reopening (it closed in 2000), but I'd still say that happens before Nevada makes it to a New Year's Six bowl (or the College Football Playoffs, which expands to 12 teams next season).\n\nYou mean Oregon State and Washington State? Yeah, those teams have a strong case to get full control of the conference given the other 10 teams are leaving after this year. I don't see why those teams would have control over the Pac-12's assets. When I sold my last house a couple of years ago, I didn't claim I had access to it after the deal closed just because it had a nice view of Wingfield Springs and I might want to have dinner on the porch on occasion because I loved the sunsets. That'd be nice, but that's not how this works. You leave, you're gone.\n\nI don't see that happening because the RSCVA is adding a $5 million indoor track inside the Reno-Sparks Convention Center that's . It will be home base for Nevada indoor track and field and could be used to host national and international events. , but the track will stay in place for the winter months each year and will be a semi-permanent situation (the track will be removed in the summer months). That track will be big for Nevada track and field and the community at large.\n\n\"This may be the single greatest opportunity to put Reno-Tahoe on the grand stage as a destination for world-class sports since the 1960 Winter Olympics,\" , the former captain of the Wolf Pack men's track and field team, wrote in a testimonial favoring the purchase. \"This track's surface and construction will certainly stand the test of time. You will get to witness youth, high school, masters, collegiate, open, world and Olympic track and field champions compete right here in Reno-Tahoe. Build this track and Reno-Tahoe will become Indoor Track City USA.\"\n\nAdded Nevada track and field coach Shantel Twiggs: \"Transformational. When you look at the history of the program and where it had its successes, one of the areas was in indoor track because at the time they were in the old WAC conference. They still had formidable schools, but they were able to pull off championship-type performances two years in a row, back-to-back years (winning the WAC indoors in 2003 and 2004). That's because they were maybe not getting the best kid in the country, but they got top-level kids and then gave them opportunities to compete and train on the Bill Cosby track and develop them, which we haven't had since the '07 season. It's transformational.\"\n\nEasily the 2015 Nevada baseball team that went 41-15 overall and 22-7 in conference. That team was 41-12 before a three-game skid to end the season. If you win 40 games in college baseball, you should be in an NCAA Regional. Jay Johnson, the coach of that team, told me earlier this year, after LSU won the national title, the Wolf Pack getting snubbed from a Regional berth helped inform his decision to leave Nevada for Arizona that offseason.\n\n\"Every once in a while, maybe two or three times a year, I'll click on the Nevada website and I'll like click on that schedule and I'll look at the schedule and remember some of those games and how special that team was,\" . \"I remember being very proud when we won the Mountain West championship. That was the first Mountain West championship for Nevada in any sport, and that's something I'll always be super proud of. Not getting into the NCAA Tournament, there's two tied for first single disappointing moments of my career. One was losing the national championship game in 2016. The other was just complete disbelief that we weren't in the postseason with a team of that caliber, and they didn't do anything wrong.\n\n\"We were 41-15. We caught a tough break in the Mountain West Tournament, didn't play our best, and I remember this very vividly. We lost the last regular-season game to Air Force. Going into that game, our RPI was 28 and I remember looking and it dropped to 44. It added a lot of pressure to what was going to happen in the Mountain West Tournament where had we won that game, I still believe if we would have gone 0-2 (in the conference tournament), we would have been in the NCAA Tournament. That was just a tough way to end that season. I will say that definitely had a motivation in my move of going, like, 'If you're going to win a national championship, you have to have a fair fight to be an NCAA Tournament team,' and that's hard in the Mountain West. You're just a one-bid league, and that's just the way that it's become.\"\n\nThe 2011-12 Nevada men's basketball team was the third team left out of the NCAA Tournament. But the Wolf Pack, which went 28-7 overall and 13-1 in the MW, only beat two top-100 RPI teams that season (Washington and New Mexico State, twice). It was 3-5 against top-100 RPI teams. Therésumé was flimsy. But it's truly a shame Deonte Burton never got to play in an NCAA Tournament game. Ditto with Luke Babbitt, who was not on that team, but he deserved to play on that stage.\n\nMy top-10 NFL quarterbacks:\n\n1. Patrick Mahomes\n\n2. Joe Burrow\n\n3. Jalen Hurts\n\n4. Josh Allen\n\n5. Lamar Jackson\n\n6. Justin Herbert\n\n7. Tua Tagovailoa\n\n8. Dak Prescott\n\n9. Kirk Cousins\n\n10. Trevor Lawrence\n\nSo, I've got Dak right at No. 8. I also considered Brock Purdy, Jared Goff and C.J. Stroud. The Panthers really blew it trading up in the draft to select Bryce Young over Stroud. It always amazes me how bad NFL decision-makers are at drafting quarterbacks. That's their No. 1 job. To get that right. Stroud is clearly way better than Young. And Carolina's 2024 first-round pick was traded to the Bears to get Young, so it looks like Chicago will get Caleb Williams since the Panthers are on pace for the No. 1 spot. Incredible mismanagement by Carolina.\n\nSince we lived in Gardnerville, we didn't go to Meadowood Mall all that often. Instead, we would drive to theNut Tree in Vacaville every summer for back-to-school shopping. But the two stores atMeadowood Mall that always stood out to me were Copeland Sports since they had a putting green and Hot Topic. I'm still a big Hot Topic guy. In college, I'd get my . And whenever I'd visit Las Vegas and go to the Forum Shops at Caesars, I'd hit the three-story FAO Schwarz, which sadly closed in 2011.\n\nI don't think it will change anything, but I'm glad somebody is trying to challenge another public handout to sports stadiums being built in Las Vegas. The Raiders got $750 million in public money and is in buyout money after firing head coach Josh McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler. That's in addition to whatever they paid their previous head coach, Jon Gruden, to go away. It's not a good use of public money.\n\nI'm not sure why we're giving Mark Davis credit for the Las Vegas Aces being good. Davis bought the Aces from MGM in February 2021 when the team was already a WNBA power having just come off a run to the WNBA finals.\n\nIf I get to the \"Attending Burning Man\" portion of my life, I'm in trouble. But the easy answer is Gregg Popovich. I would actually love to have a conversation with Popovich, who is quite scholarly and has interesting things to say about non-sports topics. And that's when he's sober. Throw in some acid and mushrooms and I can't imagine where that conversation could go. Much better than a mumbling Bill Belichick.\n\nThey're hurt, which is making Brock Purdy look more like Mr. Irrelevant than Mr. MVP. That said, the 49ers are 5-3 through their first eight games. Last year, they started 3-4 and the year before 3-5. This is ahead of schedule. They also play in the terrible NFC West. They'll be fine if they get their stars back.\n\nEvery answer to a struggling football team is found on a fan message board. That's never been in question.\n\nBuyShohei Ohtani and add one of the free-agent aces (Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell,Jordan Montgomery, Eduardo Rodríguez, Aaron Nola, Marcus Stroman, Sonny Gray) and one of the reclamation project pitchers (Lucas Giolito, Kenta Maeda, Seth Lugo, Lance Lynn, Hyun Jin Ryu, Michael Wacha). Then bring Clayton Kershaw back around midseason if his shoulder allows for it. The Dodgers are in pretty good shape overall, but getting two guys who can eat innings plus the game's biggest star would be great. It'd also cost around $700 million. We'll see if the Dodgers are willing to spend that much. The books are fairly clear.\n\nOh, he's easily No. 1, and I'll tell you why.\n\nIn 2018, Bruce Bochy was the guest speaker at Nevada baseball's Bobby Dolan Dinner. I got his phone number to do an interview previewing the event. I texted him on Jan. 16, 2018 asking if he'd be free for a 10- to 15-minute interview. He immediately hit me back saying he had to do a press conference with local reporters for theAndrew McCutchen trade (he was the Giants' manager at the time). I texted him back, \"Congrats on the trade!\" As an aside, it ended up being a poor trade asMcCutchen spent less than a year with the Giants, who dealt future All-Star Bryan Reynolds and Kyle Crick to the Pirates in exchange forMcCutchen. Anyway, Bochy called me after the press conference, and . He had many good things to say about Reno.\n\nMore than five years later, Bochy won the World Series with the Texas Rangers. Seconds after the team recorded its final out, I went back to my text exchange with Bochy from 2018 and sent him a message that read: \"Congratulations, Skip! Legendary performance. Enjoy the champagne bath and fourth World Series ring. (Insert four emoji trophies) And tell Seager the Dodgers fans out there are thrilled for his success!\" I wasn't going to text him since he clearly has no idea who I am. But I figured, \"When will I ever get to text an MLB manager immediately after he won a World Series?\" So, I did it. And as I watched my Buffalo Bills lose to the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday Night Football last night, four days after the World Series clincher, my phone lit up with a text message. It was from Bochy, who thanked me for my message and said he'd pass my congratulations on to Seager. And that, my friends, is why Bruce Bochy is the baseball manager in baseball history.\n\nSee y'all next week!\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
