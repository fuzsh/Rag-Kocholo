        "text": "May 17, 2000\n\nBox Score\n\nLas Vegas, Nev - San Diego State's Jacob Minter's single with the bases loaded and two-out in the bottom of the ninth inning drove in the tying and winning runs, pushing the Aztecs past UNLV for a 7-6 victory in the first round of the Mountain West Conference Baseball Tournament at Earl E. Wilson Stadium Wednesday.\n\nMinter's single capped a five-run inning for the No. 2 Aztecs (31-28), who trailed throughout most of the game. Behind a solid pitching performance from Ryan Olson, No. 5 UNLV (24-32) carried a 6-2 advantage into the ninth.\n\nUNLV, which trailed 1-0, scored a single run in the third inning to tie the game. The Rebels then went ahead 3-1 on a two-run home run by senior catcher Harold Betts in the fourth inning.\n\nUNLV then increased the lead to 5-1 in the seventh inning on a two-run single by senior first baseman Tony DeMarco. The Rebels final run came on a solo home run in the eighth inning by junior designated hitter Trent Kitsch, his team-leading 13th of the season.\n\nOlson tossed another soild game against San Diego State. He pitched 8 innings, allowed 4 hits, 3 runs (all unearned), walked 2 and struck out 7.\n\nUNLV will face Air Force at 11 a.m. on Thursday at Wilson Stadium."
