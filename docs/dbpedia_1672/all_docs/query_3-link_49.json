        "text": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada— The Mountain West’s wild regular season has ended, capping one of the most exciting in conference history. Utah State was picked ninth in the MW preseason polls but played like a team of destiny all year.\n\nSenior point guard Darius Brown II and junior wing Great Osobor ended up in Logan alongside former Bobcat head coach Danny Sprinkle. With Sprinkle creating a winning environment and the Brown & Osobor duo leading the way on the court, USU wrapped up a magical regular season with a last-second win against New Mexico to clinch the program’s first outright Mountain West regular season championship.\n\nRELATED: Darius Brown II Propels Utah State To Conference Title\n\nThe Aggies were the biggest risers from the preseason polls, climbing eight spots from their initial prediction, but it wasn’t easy for Utah State. USU dropped one game in the non-conference schedule, a 72-66 loss at Bradley in the second game of the year.\n\nFollowing that setback, the Aggies reeled off 15 straight wins before suffering its first Mountain West loss against New Mexico at The Pit on January 16. Utah State’s only two-game losing skid came in early February after losses at San Diego State and its only Spectrum loss of the year against the Nevada Wolfpack. It was a tough loss to stomach at the time, but the two-seed Wolfpack enter the conference tournament on a seven-game winning streak.\n\nUSU finished the season 9-0 in games decided by five points or less, 13-1 in games decided by ten points or less, and 2-1 in overtime games. The Aggies enter the tournament on a five-game winning streak.\n\nMountain West Tournament 2024 Schedule\n\nAll tip-off times are Mountain Standard Time\n\nFirst Round | Wednesday, March 13\n\nGame 1: #8 Wyoming 73 vs. #9 Fresno State 77\n\nGame 2: #7 Colorado State 72 vs. #10 San Jose State 62\n\nGame 3: #6 New Mexico vs. #11 Air Force – 5 p.m.\n\nQuarterfinals | Thursday, March 14\n\nGame 4: #1 Utah State vs. #9 Fresno State – 1 p.m.\n\nBovine Blog: Previewing No. 18 Utah State Vs.
