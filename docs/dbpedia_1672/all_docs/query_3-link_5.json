Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The MW officially began operations on January 4, 1999. Geographically, the MW covers a broad expanse of the Western United States, with member schools located in California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, as well as an associate member in Hawaii. Gloria Nevarez took over as commissioner of the MW on January 1, 2023, following the retirement of founding commissioner Craig Thompson.[1][2]\n\nThe charter members of the MW included the United States Air Force Academy, Brigham Young University, Colorado State University, San Diego State University, the University of New Mexico, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, University of Utah and the University of Wyoming. Before forming the Mountain West Conference, seven of its eight charter members had been longtime members of the Western Athletic Conference and half of these had been charter members of that conference from 1962. Overall, each school that has ever been either a full or football-only member of the MW spent at least three years in the WAC before joining the Mountain West.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGenesis\n\n[edit]\n\nThe creation of the MW was a delayed aftereffect of the 1996 NCAA conference realignment, which had initially been triggered two years earlier when the Big Eight Conference agreed to merge with four members of the Southwest Conference (SWC) to create the Big 12 Conference, which would begin competition in the 1996–97 school year.\n\nThe Western Athletic Conference, which had initially announced plans to expand beyond its then-current 10 members to at least 12, ended up with even more potential expansion prospects. Ultimately, the WAC took in three of the four SWC schools left out of the Big 12 merger—Rice University, Southern Methodist University (SMU), and Texas Christian University (TCU). Three other schools were added to bring the total membership to 16, namely Big West Conference members San Jose State University and UNLV, plus the University of Tulsa, an NCAA football independent and otherwise a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. The WAC's 16 teams were divided into four four-team \"quadrants\", two of which rotated between the Mountain and Pacific Divisions every two years. However, the newly expanded WAC was soon wracked by tension between the established and new members.[3]\n\nIn spring of 1998, BYU and Utah proposed a permanent split into two eight-team divisions. The proposal would have forced some schools into an unnatural alignment because of the geographic distribution of the conference.[3] Air Force was the most strident opponent of this proposal, threatening to become an independent.[3] Soon after the proposal by BYU and Utah, the presidents of Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, Utah, and Wyoming met at Denver International Airport to discuss their future, and they agreed to break away from the WAC to form a new conference.[3] They invited the WAC members New Mexico, San Diego State, and UNLV to join them in what became the Mountain West Conference.\n\nThe next move for the MW came in 2005, when the conference added TCU, who had spent the previous four seasons in Conference USA (C-USA).\n\nEarly–2010s realignment\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 11, 2010, Boise State University agreed to join the conference as its tenth member. On June 17, 2010, Utah announced it would be leaving the Mountain West to join what would become the Pac-12 Conference. On August 18, 2010, amidst rumors that BYU was considering leaving the Mountain West to go independent in football and rejoin the Western Athletic Conference in all other sports, the Mountain West Conference officially extended invitations to California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) and the University of Nevada, Reno (Nevada). Both schools accepted and would become the tenth and eleventh members of the league.[4][5] BYU announced on August 31, 2010, that it would leave the Mountain West Conference and go Independent in football and become a member of the West Coast Conference (WCC) in other sports starting in 2011.[6] On November 29, 2010, TCU announced all athletic teams would move to the Big East Conference effective in 2012.[7] (Less than a year later, on October 10, 2011, TCU announced it would not join the Big East but would join the Big 12, home to fellow former SWC members Baylor, Texas, Texas Tech, and formerly Texas A&M, in 2012 instead.)[8] On December 10, 2010, the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa accepted a bid to become the 10th member of the conference for football only.[9] These changes would leave the Mountain West Conference with 10 teams for the 2012 football season.\n\nDuring the era of football's Bowl Championship Series (BCS), which was replaced by the College Football Playoff (CFP) in 2014, the MW champion qualified for a BCS bowl four times after the BCS formula was tweaked to allow teams from non-BCS conferences to play in BCS bowls if ranked in the top 12. However, two of the three schools that qualified are no longer with the conference.\n\nOn October 14, 2011, the Mountain West and C-USA announced a plan for a football only alliance.[10] On February 13, 2012, the two leagues announced that both conferences would be dissolving after the 2012–13 season to reform into one conference with at least 15 members for all sports, and a 16th team, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa as a football-only member.[11] However, when the two conferences discussed their plans with the NCAA, they were told that due to NCAA rules, they would forfeit substantial revenues. Specifically, the new conference would receive only one automatic bid to NCAA championships; at least one of the former conferences would lose future revenue distributions from the NCAA men's basketball tournament; and at least one former conference would not be able to collect exit fees from any members that departed to join the new conference.[12] As a result, the Mountain West and C-USA backed away from a full merger. In late March of that year, the commissioners of both conferences stated that all 16 schools had entered into binding agreements to form a new \"association\",[13] although the Mountain West and C-USA would have apparently remained separate legal entities.[12] In the end, this alliance never materialized due to both conferences soon adding new teams.\n\nOn May 2, 2012, San Jose State and Utah State agreed to join the conference for the 2013–14 academic year. On December 31 of that year, Boise State announced that it had backed out of its previously announced move to the Big East for football and the Big West for other sports, and would remain in the MW.[14]\n\nOn January 16, 2013, San Diego State accepted an offer to remain/return to the Mountain West Conference in all sports. Keeping SDSU in the conference gave the Mountain West 12 football members, allowing for a Championship Game to be held. The first championship game took place on December 7, 2013.[15]\n\nFurther membership changes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2018, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the MW was looking to expand in the near future. In the report, commissioner Craig Thompson revealed that the conference had discussed expansion with six schools, with WCC member Gonzaga (which has not sponsored football since World War II) the only school mentioned by name. Thompson added that Gonzaga could potentially join the MW as a full but non-football member as early as July 2018. While Thompson said that BYU had not contacted the conference, the report indicated that BYU would be open to an MW return, at least in non-football sports, should Gonzaga join.[16] A later Union-Tribune report indicated that talks were advanced enough that the conference's presidents planned a vote on an invitation to Gonzaga during the MW men's and women's basketball tournaments in Las Vegas, but decided to delay the vote until after the Final Four.[17] However, on April 2, the day of the Division I men's title game, Gonzaga athletic director Mike Roth notified the MW, the WCC, and media that the school would remain in the WCC for the immediate future.[18]\n\nOn June 30, 2022, UCLA[19] and USC[20] announced their departure from the Pac-12 Conference to the Big Ten Conference beginning in the 2024–25 academic year. After that announcement, San Diego State had been considered one of the top candidates for Pac-12 expansion. On June 16, 2023, Pete Thamel of ESPN reported that San Diego State had given the Mountain West Conference notice that the school would be departing from the conference and asked for an extension for the departure deadline of July 1, 2023, to avoid paying extra exit fees.[21] The Mountain West Conference denied the request for a deadline extension and considered the letter from San Diego State as a formal notice of departure and began to proceed with the separation process; however, San Diego State disputed that its letter of intent was a formal notice.[22] On June 30, 2023, with the Pac-12 still lacking a media rights agreement for 2024–25, ESPN reported that San Diego State would remain in the Mountain West Conference, rescinding the intention to withdraw from the conference.[23] The MW and San Diego State reached a settlement of their dispute the following month, with SDSU remaining a member for the immediate future.[24]\n\nIn September 2023, after a mass exodus from the Pac-12 left Oregon State and Washington State as its only remaining members, MW commissioner Gloria Nevarez began discussions with the two schools regarding various options for partnership, affiliation, or merger.[25][26] On December 1, 2023, the conference announced that it would enter into a football scheduling agreement with the two schools for the 2024 season. All 12 Mountain West members will play one game against either Oregon State or Washington State next season, giving both schools three home games and three away games. These games will not count towards Mountain West conference standings, and Oregon State and Washington State will remain members of the Pac-12.[27] On April 16, 2024, it was also announced that Washington State would be joining the MW as an affiliate for baseball and women's swimming.[28]\n\nMember schools\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent full members\n\n[edit]\n\nInstitution Location Founded Joined

This first championship game took place on December 7, 2013, at Bulldog Stadium in Fresno, California, the home stadium of Fresno State, the divisional winner with the higher BCS ranking.[38] Each team played five divisional games and three cross-divisional contests annually.[39] The 2015 championship game featured the Air Force Academy Falcons against the San Diego State University Aztecs. The 2016 championship game featured the San Diego State University Aztecs against the University of Wyoming Cowboys.\n\nOn May 20, 2022, the conference approved a new football schedule format, set to take effect in the 2023 season.[40][41] Under this format, the conference will remove divisions, and instead play a 2–6 format, where each team plays 2 designated rivals every year along with six separate 6-team rotations that flip every other year, such that every team will have at least one home game and one away game against every other team in a three-year cycle (less than the standard length of a college player's career). The MW Championship will also no longer be determined by the winners of the two divisions; the two teams with the highest conference winning percentage will play instead.[42][43] The designated rivals under this system are as follows:\n\nMW Permanent Matchups[42] School Rival 1 Rival 2 Air Force Colorado State Wyoming Boise State New Mexico Utah State Colorado State Air Force Wyoming Fresno State Nevada San Jose State Hawaii San Diego State UNLV Nevada Fresno State UNLV New Mexico Boise State San Jose State San Diego State Hawaii Utah State San Jose State Fresno State New Mexico UNLV Hawaii Nevada Utah State Boise State San Diego State Wyoming Air Force Colorado State\n\nPrior to this, the division format was as follows:\n\nMW Football Divisions (2013–2022) Mountain Division West Division Air Force Fresno State Boise State Hawaiʻi Colorado State Nevada New Mexico UNLV Utah State San Diego State Wyoming San Jose State\n\nNo other MW sport is split into divisions—including women's soccer, the only other conference sport with 12 competing schools (with Colorado College as the 12th member).\n\nBowl games\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mountain West Conference has agreements with six bowls.\n\nSince the 2014 season, the Mountain West champion is eligible for an at-large berth in the Cotton Bowl Classic, Fiesta Bowl, or Peach Bowl, if it is the highest-ranked conference champion among the \"Group of Five\" conferences (which also includes The American, C-USA, MAC, and Sun Belt) in the final College Football Playoff rankings, if it is not in the top 4. In the 2014 season, Boise State became the first team to receive this berth, being selected for and winning the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nAs of 2020,\n\nPick Name Location Opposing\n\nconference Opposing\n\npick 1 LA Bowl Inglewood, California Pac-12 5 Non–specific Hawaii Bowl Honolulu, Hawaii The American Non–specific Non–specific Famous Idaho Potato Bowl Boise, Idaho MAC Non–specific Non–specific New Mexico Bowl Albuquerque, New Mexico C-USA Non–specific Non–specific Arizona Bowl Tucson, Arizona MAC Non–specific Conditional* Cactus Bowl Phoenix, Arizona Big 12 or Pac-12 6 (Big 12) or 7 (Pac-12) Conditional* San Francisco Bowl Santa Clara, California Big Ten or Pac-12 Non–specific (Big Ten) or 4 (Pac-12)\n\nIf Hawaii is bowl eligible and not MW champions or selected for a CFP bowl, they will receive a berth in the Hawaii Bowl.\n\nThe MW will only send a team to the Cactus or San Francisco Bowls if one of the primary conferences affiliated with those bowls is unable to fill their slots.\n\nBowl records\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2019–20 bowl games\n\nSchool Appearances W L T Win\n\n% BCS/\n\nNY6 National\n\nchampionships Air Force 29 15 13 1 .534 0–0 0 Fresno State 28 14 14 0 .500 0–0 0 Boise State 20[a] 13 7 0 .650 3–0 2 — 1958 (NJCAA), 1980 (NCAA Division I-AA[b]) San Diego State 20 10 10 0 .500 0–0 3 — 1966–1968 (NCAA College Division[c]) Nevada 18 7 11 0 .389 0–0 0 Wyoming 18 9 9 0 .500 0–0 0 Colorado State 17 6 11 0 .353 0–0 0 Utah State 15 6 9 0 .400 0–0 0 Hawai'i 14 8 6 0 .571 0–1 0 New Mexico 13 4 8 1 .346 0–0 0 San Jose State 12 7 5 0 .583 0–0 0 UNLV 4 3 1 0 .750 0–0 0\n\nBowl Challenge Cup\n\n[edit]\n\nESPN created the Bowl Challenge Cup in 2002 for the conference that had the best college football bowl record among Division I Football Bowl Subdivision conferences. The conference has won it five times, more than any other conference, by finishing with bowl game records of 2–1 in 2004–05,[44] 4–1 in 2007–08,[45] 4–1 in 2009–10,[46] 4–1 in 2010–11[47] and 5–1 in 2021–22.[48]\n\nMen's basketball\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mountain West and Missouri Valley Conferences hold an annual challenge series that was renewed in the 2015–16 season after a two-year hiatus. The series began in the 2009–10 season but temporarily ended when the original contract ran out after the 2012–13 season, During the first four seasons of the series, it involved all members of the MW and an equal number of the 10 MVC teams in basketball. With the MW now having 11 basketball members to the MVC's 10, the renewed series involves all MVC teams, with one MW team sitting out.\n\nThe first game was on November 13, 2009, featuring the Bradley Braves and the BYU Cougars in Provo and it concluded on December 23 with the Wyoming Cowboys visiting the Northern Iowa Panthers in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The challenge is similar to the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, which pits men's basketball teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big Ten Conference.[49]\n\nNCAA tournament records\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season\n\nSchool Appearances W L Win\n\n% Wins per\n\nappearance National\n\nchampionships Utah State 23 6 24 .200 0.273 0 UNLV 20 33 19 .635 1.650 1 (1990) San Diego State 16 11 14 .440 0.733 0 Wyoming 16 9 21 .300 0.563 1 (1943) New Mexico 15 8 16 .333 0.533 0 Colorado State 12 5 12 .250 0.363 0 Nevada 11 6 10 .375 0.600 0 Boise State 10 0 9 .000 0.000 0 Fresno State 5 2 5 .286 0.400 0 Air Force 4 0 4 .000 0.000 0 San Jose State 3 0 3 .000 0.000 0\n\nWomen's basketball\n\n[edit]\n\nNCAA tournament records\n\n[edit]\n\nSchool Appearances W L Win\n\n% Wins per\n\nappearance National\n\nchampionships UNLV 10 3 10 .231 0.300 0 New Mexico 8 3 8 .273 0.375 0 San Diego State 9 6 9 .400 0.571 0 Fresno State 7 0 7 .000 0.000 0 Boise State 6 0 6 .000 0.000 0 Colorado State 6 5 6 .455 0.833 0 Wyoming 2 0 2 .000 0.000 0 Air Force 0 0 0 – 0.000 0 Nevada 0 0 0 – 0.000 0 San Jose State 0 0 0 – 0.000 0 Utah State 0 0 0 – 0.000 0\n\nFacilities\n\n[edit]\n\nSchool Football stadium Capacity Basketball arena Capacity Baseball stadium Capacity Air Force Falcon Stadium 39,441 Clune Arena 5,858 Falcon Baseball Field 1,000 Boise State Albertsons Stadium 36,387 ExtraMile Arena 12,480 Non-baseball school Colorado State Canvas Stadium 41,000 Moby Arena 8,745 Non-baseball school Fresno State Valley Children's Stadium 40,727 Save Mart Center 15,544 Pete Beiden Field 5,757 Hawaiʻi Clarence T.

This impacts endurance in sports like football, soccer, and the distance races in track & field and swimming meets; air resistance in sprints and horizontal jumps in track & field; and aerodynamics in baseball, softball, tennis, golf, and the discus and javelin throws. The Mountain West's institutions have the highest average elevations in NCAA Division I sports.\n\nSchools in italics are single-sport members. In the case of women's soccer-only member Colorado College, \"stadium elevation\" refers to the school's soccer venue.\n\nSchool Campus\n\nelevation (ft) Stadium\n\nelevation (ft) Air Force Academy 7,258 6,621 Wyoming 7,220 7,220 Colorado College 6,053 6,053 New Mexico 5,174 5,100 Colorado State 5,007 5,190 Utah State 4,777 4,710 Nevada 4,564 4,610 Boise State 2,697 2,695 UNLV 2,024 1,600 San Diego State 433 25 Fresno State 338 335 Hawai'i 105 19 San Jose State 85 93\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
