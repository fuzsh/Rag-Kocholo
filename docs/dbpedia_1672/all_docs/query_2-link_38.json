        "text": "March is a time of basketball related rejoicing. The NCAA Tournament starts midway through the month, but in the early weeks we get a flurry of fantastic college basketball with the various conference tournaments which will help decide the field for the Big Dance. I’m going to take a look at each conference, try (almost certainly unsuccessfully) to pick the winner, and determine whether anyone from that conference can make some noise, come Tourney Time. So with that, onward and upwards amigos!\n\nConference Realignment was almost entirely motivated by college football programs. However, the trickle down effect was that basketball rivalries all across the country were broken up or relocated as teams switch conferences. The end result, then, was that several of the formerly great basketball conferences took on massively different looks. They didn’t necessarily become worse, but they defeinitely aren’t the same as the once were. So, most of these conferences are generally big, brand name type conferences that have several teams which could make some noise in the big dance, but they are no longer part of the absolute top of the mountain (your ACCs etc). So, without further ado let’s take a look at the tier of conferences just behind the top.\n\nConference USA was absolutely raided and decimated by conference realignment, but somehow, through all the chaos they came out looking like a fairly impressive basketball conference.\n\nCurrently leading the pack are the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs.\n\nLouisiana Tech really came on in Conference play after a less than impressive non-conference performance. They have some good length, size, and athleticism that makes them a very solid defensive team capable of generating blocks, steals, and turnovers to help fuel their slightly under-powered offense. However, they’re not completely inept offensively as they have two players (Raheem Appleby and Alex Hamilton) who average 15 points per game and a third player in double digits (Erik McCree with 11). Moreover, they have some impressive length in McCree which helps them crash the glass, and perhaps more importantly senior Michale Kyser and his 3 blocks per game can be an absolute menace for opponents. However, they’re relative newcomers to the top of C-USA and are more consistent than great.\n\nOld Dominion, on the other hand, has shown legitimate signs of greatness throughout this season. They started the season on an absolute tear, scoring upsets over LSU, #14 VCU, and Georgia State, ending their non-conference slate at a stellar 12-1 record, and even working their way into the top 25. The LSU win was particularly impressive to me personally because seeing a relatively undersized team like ODU go up against a team with one of the best athletic front-courts in the country, and come out on top is not an easy task. If they’re playing at their best, Old Dominion could easily be one of the 20 best teams in the country. Unfortunately, however, they haven’t been at their best since conference play started.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, they’ve still been good, but after that 12-1 start, they’ve gone 12-5 in conference play and have picked up several losses to teams I would have thought were far inferior to them in conference. I’m chomping at the bit for a reason to hop back on the ODU bandwagon, and if they can run through the Conference USA Tournament and punch their ticket to the NCAAs I’ll be all over them. Until then, however, I’m cautiously optimistic.\n\nThe final team of note in conference USA is UTEP. The miners started off the season very well with wins over Washington State, New Mexico State, Princeton, and Xavier, but hit a 3 game losing skid after that and have been consistently inconsistent every since. However, they’ve still managed to put together a 20-9 record, and played an excellent game against Arizona back in December (a 60-55 loss) which gives me a lot of faith that they could pull off some upsets and win Conference USA, and maybe even make some noise beyond that.\n\nThe MAC remained relatively safe and untouched through conference realignment, but they’ve always been somewhat of an outpost in the wilderness as far as “bigish” conferences are concerned. However, they have several programs with some solid basketball history, and a handful of very solid teams this year.\n\nThe traditional “basketball powers” out of the MAC are generally Akron, Kent State, and Toledo, and while all three have definitely been solid this year, and Kent State has even been on somewhat of a tear to close out the season, none of them are the class of the MAC this year. I have full faith that any one of them could get hot and pull off an upset or two to win the MAC Tournament. Same goes for Bowling Green, Western Michigan, and Eastern Michigan. Bowling Green in particular was leading the conference back in February, but a 2-3 stretch in their last 5 games cost them the lead, and has them looking more uncertain than ever coming into the MAC Tournament. So there are six teams that I think stand a reasonable chance of punching their ticket to the NCAA, but non of them are necessarily the class of the league.That would be Central Michigan.\n\nThe Chippewas are 22-6 this year with a 12-5 MAC record, but have been far and away the most consistent team in the league all season long. They have an elite offense that is 14th in the nation in scoring and 28th in offensive efficiency (again referencing Ken Pomeroy). They’re definitely the safest bet to come out of the MAC and probably the most deserving team as well, but my fear with them is that they appear to be yet another good but not great team. Its easy for me to imagine another team getting hot and upsetting Central Michigan, even on a good night for the Chippewas, simply because they don’t have anyone on their roster that I feel can truly take over a game and put down an upset bid before it happens. They’re still a very good team, and deserving of an NCAA Tournament bid, I’m just worried that it might not happen for them.\n\nAnd the main reason I feel that was is because of the University of Buffalo. They had a somewhat rocky start in the non-conference going 9-3, but that is easily explained away when you realize 1 of those games was on the road to St. Bonaventure and the other two were against #1 Kentucky and #6 Wisconsin. Moreover, the Bulls actually LED Kentucky 38-33 at the half IN RUPP ARENA in their November 16th meeting (before being dominated in the second half). My point, however, is that Buffalo is probably the most talented and athletic team in the MAC this season, and that half against Kentucky proved it. They didn’t have even close to the depth necessary to stay fresh for an entire 40 minutes and compete with the Wildcats, but Head Coach Bobby Hurley had them doing so for a half when the adrenaline was flowing and his athletes were still fresh.\n\nFreshman Lamonte Bearden is young, inexperienced, and somewhat prone to mistakes, but the guy is a stellar athlete and a great X-factor for the Bulls. Forward Justin Moss is an absolute stud and an excellent anchor for the team when paired with Sophomore guard Shannon Evans. Moreover, with Rodell Wigginton and Jarryn Skeete off the bench the Bulls have plenty of scoring options, and Will Regan and Xavier Ford give them the size and length the need to establish a presence inside. The Bulls can run, they can score, and they can absolutely wear their opponents down, especially in the MAC where they have been on fire lately winning 5 straight. If they can win their season finale against a struggling Bowling Green team, and carry that momentum into the MAC Tournament, they will easily be my pick to win the league and head to the NCAA Tournament, and once there I’m convinced they could compete with anyone.\n\nThe Mountain West is undeniably a football conference, and in fact are the best “non-automatic qualifier” conference in football, but over the last decade or so they’ve built themselves into quite a niche little basketball conference as well.\n\nGenerally this has meant Utah State, San Diego State, Nevada, and UNLV, but this year Utah State has been only slightly above average, Nevada and UNLV have been outright bad, and San Diego State (while still good) has taken their whole “Elite Defense with Limited Offense” strategy to disastrous levels of poor offense. This, then, has created a small power gap that has allowed several new schools to float to the top, which I personally love to see. So let’s take a look at a few of them.\n\nSan Diego State we’ve already touched on a little so we might as well finish them off here. Coach Steve Fisher has built the Aztecs into an NCAA Tournament mainstay over the last few years, and he’s done so on the backs of elite defense. Even in a down year like this season the Aztecs somehow still find themselves drifting into the top 25 on the back of top tier defense. The Aztecs are currently 3rd in the nation in points allowed and #4 in defensive efficiency according to Ken Pomeroy. Those are some pretty jaw dropping stats, and honestly any team capable of playing that level of defense should be a title contender. So why are the Aztecs just 23-7? Because their offense is abysmal. To be fair it was pretty bad last year when they made it to the Sweet 16, but the 2014 Aztecs had Xavier Thames dropping 30 point games from time to time. This year’s crop has no such luxury, and with out it they’re the kind of team that I could see losing any night to a half decent team. They play championship caliber defense, but if their offense doesn’t start pulling its weight they won’t even win the Mountain West title let alone make a deep NCAA run.\n\nSo while San Diego State is generally the class of the league, this season the leaders in the Mountain West are, shockingly, the Boise State Broncos. I say shockingly because last year’s Boise State team was the team everyone was picking to make the NCAA Tournament as it was a senior laden team which had just come off a Tournament appearance in 2013. That team ultimately fell short, but this one, even with the bulk of its veteran roster gone, seems to be making a spirited run at things. They have been positively destructive since entering conference play. They opened up 0-3, but since then are 13-1 in the Mountain West. Absolutely noone in the MWC is playing better than them right now. Seniors Derrick Marks and Anthony Drmic have been on fire and I could easily see those two keeping up this pace through the MWC Tournament and into the NCAAs. I’m not sure that they’re the caliber of team I would pick to make a deep run in the Tournament, but a Round of 64 upset certainly isn’t out of the question.\n\nIf Boise State have been the class of the MWC for the second half of the season, however, Colorado State was undeniably the Conferences best looking team to open up the season. The Rams kicked off the season with an undefeated non-conference record (13-0) and won the opening game of their MWC season with a win over Boise. They were ranked in the top 25, and everything looked peachy. However, the month of January was not kind to them. They lost their next 2 conference games, and had a 5-3 record in January. Not exactly the same as ripping off 14 straight wins to open the season. They recovered fairly well, finishing the season 6-2 with this Saturday’s Utah State game (a very probable loss admittedly) left on the schedule. They’re currently a very respectable 25-5, but have yet to recover that early season form. However, Colorado state may be the most balanced team in the MWC offensively and defensively, and I wouldn’t be shocked (or disappointed) at all to see them win the MWC Tournament and come out of the league.\n\nMy personal favorite MWC team this season, however, are the Wyoming Cowboys. Gotta love these guys. They’re a D2 school playing in a big time D1 conference. They’re in the middle of nowhere in Laramie, Wyoming, and every once in a while they put together a stellar sports team that makes some noise on a national scale. This year really looked like their year when they started out the season with a very impressive non-conference performance of 11-2 with wins over Colorado and New Mexico State and their only two losses coming in loooong distance road games against Cal and SMU. However, conference play was about as unkind to them as it was to Colorado State as they’re currently sitting at 11-6 in conference with one road game left to play tomorrow. They have the talent to make some noise both in the MWC and even in the NCAA Tournament with Josh Adams, and especially Larry Nance Jr. (son of 3x NBA all star and dunk contest winner Larry Nance), but unfortunately they’ve completely lost their form here closing out the season. If they can quickly recover their early season form they still have a chance, but any hope of an at large bid is now gone, and they probably need to win the MWC to make the NCAA Tournament. I’ll be rooting for them and would love to see them make the Tourney for the first time since 2002, but sadly this might not be their year.\n\nThe American Athletic Conference is essentially what Conference USA used to be. The Big East, a traditional basketball power with mountains of fantastic basketball history, continuously tried to whore itself out and become a football conference in a desperate grab for cash. Eventually, however, the basketball schools in the conference either decided to leave for greener pastures or split off entirely, leaving the rag tag pile of expansion schools pilfered from Conference USA to fend for themselves. The reformed into the American, and in spite of their woeful starting position have recovered and built themselves into a solid basketball conference once again.\n\nMemphis and UConn have both started to make a run here late in the season, and Tulane started off the season great, but all three of them just don’t look like they’re in their best form right now. If I was going to pick any of them to win the American Tournament and make it to the NCAAs it would be UConn but all three of them are long shots.\n\nTemple, on the other hand, seems to be back to the old grind of winning basketball games. Temple is one of the most consistent mid major programs out there. The Owls play tough, hard nosed defense, smother people at home, and grind their way to 20 win seasons year after year. This year is no different. They’re playing excellent defense, and the rebound very well, but somehow they leave me unimpressed. This is a vintage Temple team to be sure, but much like San Diego State in the MWC I worry that they don’t have enough offensive weapons to win a game in the NCAAs (or even win the American).\n\nCincinnati under Mick Cronin has won just as consistently if not more so than Temple with more or less the exact same recipe. They play tough defense which keeps them in any game, even if they’re playing a superior opponent. Moreover, every once in a while they find a handful of offensive talents who can push them over the edge and make a deep run. This years team, however, doesn’t appear to be one of these vintage teams. For one thing, Cronin has been ill for most of the season, and while he still coaches the team in practice, has not been allowed to coach from the sidelines for medical problems. This is a real shame, because they guy is a great coach, but if its for his health things are definitely better this way. For the team, however, it just adds one more shaky leg to a team which might not have all the pieces in place to make the NCAA Tournament.\n\nTulsa, however, looked every bit the Conference Champion and NCAA Tournament caliber team all season long for most of the year. They opened up conference play 10-0 and looked like they would easily skate to victory in conference. However, they are 4-3 since then, have fallen to 14-3, and allowed SMU to tie them for the conference lead. They’re still talented enough to win the league under new coach Frank Haith (fresh off of his disastrous abandonment of Mizzou) and could easily get hot in the conference tournament to punch their ticket to the NCAAs, but I don’t really think this is the team to beat in the American.\n\nBecause that would be Larry Brown’s SMU. When Larry Brown came out of retirement for the 78th time to coach SMU everyone knew it was only a matter of time until he had them in contention. That year was honestly supposed to be last season when they were so rudely snubbed from the Tourney field, but Brown has come back with an even better performance this year to make sure they make the big dance. Moreover, they made it all the way to the NIT Finals, proving that this team has postseason chops, and comes to play every night. They don’t let themselves get upset and quit when things don’t go their way which is exactly the kind of team you want to have in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThey don’t necessarily have any one star leading their team (outside of that decrepit old coach I guess) but they’re Ken Pomeroy’s #22 offense and play incredibly well as a unit. They’re not flashy or exciting, but neither is anyone in the American. Its a conference full of gritty hard nosed basketball teams, and this year SMU just so happens to be the best of them. I fully expect SMU to win the American Tournament, and even if they don’t they probably deserve an at large bid into the tournament. Whether they do anything after that is anyone’s guess, but I think not. But its not like Brown hasn’t won big games with inferior teams before so who knows.\n\nThe better half of the American, however, is the Big East. Like I mentioned the old Big East was one of the best basketball conferences around rich in basketball tradition and absolutely littered with elite basketball programs. Now, a lot of these schools were basketball only programs that did not play BCS football, so when they say the bigger schools in their conference bastardizing their tradition and history, they decided to split from the jerks (aka football schools) and rebuild the old basketball Big East to the best of their ability. Obviously this is not the same Big East that used to dominate March, but by all accounts they are still an excellent basketball conference.\n\nSeton Hall got my hopes up that they were finally back to their spectacular form of the late 80s through early 2000s when they opened up the year 12-2 with wins over #15 St. Johns and #6 Villanova. They were back in the top 25 and looking good but they have since completely melted down (including a widely publicized punch) and are no longer anywhere near making the NCAA Tournament without winning the Big East (which I assure you is astronomically unlikely at this point). Xavier started out the year alright with wins over Low-Major darlings Stephen F. Austin and Murray State, but it never really materialized into much as they found themselves brutalized in conference play. Neither of them probably have any chance of making the NCAAs anymore but there are still a handful of teams from the Big East that could.\n\nFirst and foremost is Villanova. Clearly the best team in the Big East so I’ll keep this short. They might not win the conference Tourney in Madison Square Garden, but thats because they’re playing against teams fighting for their Tournament lives while Nova has all but locked up a #2 seed in the Tournament. I am extremely skeptical about them as a Final Four or even Elite 8 team, but regardless of all that they clearly deserve to be in the Tournament and are the best team in the Big East this year.\n\nNext comes my personal favorite team from the Big East this year Providence. They’ve struggled a lot at times this year, but as a unit the Friars play solid offense, serviceable defense, and if they can just keep things close enough for star swingman LaDontae Henton to do his thing and explode on people, then all will be right with them. They have the athleticism necessary to play an up tempo game, and are capable of slowing the game down and playing an efficient half court offense/defense if need be. I like the fact that they’re adaptable and would be furious if they didn’t secure an at large bid into the Tourney, and shocked if they didn’t win at least one game once they got there.\n\nButler Georgetown St. Johns are the last of the Big East contenders as far as I see it. And honestly they’re all kindof the same team. They’ve all had great wins and crushing losses (mostly to each other) all season long as they beat on one another in an attempt to make the Tournament. I think all three of them are good. And any one of them deserves to make the tournament. However, they definitely can’t all three make it. If anything I figure the last man standing out of this group will make the NCAA Tournament, and the other two can feel grievously wronged since they are clearly no worse than the team in question. In the end, however, there just aren’t enough tournament spots to go around, and while all three of these teams are definitely better than many of the teams that will make the tournament in the 13-16 seed range this just won’t be their year.\n\nThe Atlantic 10 also had its fair share of shuffling during conference realignment, but might have come out of realignment even stronger than before. The A10 has always been a basketball only conference, and has gone out of its way to ensure that it puts up spectacular performances in the sport. The conference is absolutely replete with programs rich in basketball history and tradition, and constantly put up solid performances year after year. They started as a collection of East Coast / Atlantic Seaboard basketball schools but have since expanded into the Midwest. This expansion, however, hasn’t hurt their reputation as basketball first programs at all however as they have been able to cherry pick some of the best Midwestern Mid-Majors around such as Dayton (Sweet 16 last year) and St. Louis (a 5 seed in last year’s tournament in the loaded Midwest Bracket). So needless to say these guys are pretty good at basketball.\n\nGeorge Washington and UMass have put together impressive resumes to end the season, but they’ve both struggled all year long, and I don’t really see them being anywhere near title contention for the A10 let alone NCAA. Richmond has had a few spectacular wins, and by all means could get hot and win the A10, but I highly doubt it. The real meat of this conference, then, starts with VCU.\n\nEveryone remembers Shaka Smart and the Rams’ spectacular run from First Four to Final Four in 2011. Since then Smart has built the Rams into an absolute college basketball stalwart. They have made the NCAA Tournament every year since that 2011 run, and seem to look more and more impressive season after season. This year, however, there is a problem. This rams team could have made a deep tournament run, but in the end of January Senior guard Briante Weber went down, and VCU hasn’t looked the same since. They are an abysmal 4-6 since he went down, dropping their overall record from 17-3 with a top 25 ranking to 21-9 with only the slimmest of hopes for making the NCAA Tournament. They honestly might deserve to make the Tournament based on their first half results, but as the NCAA taught us in 2010 with Kentucky, they have no problem keeping a deserving team out of the Tournament if they’re missing a key player. I think this will be the end of VCU’s consecutive Tournament appearances streak unfortunately, but I’m certain Coach Smart will have them back better than ever next season.\n\nThe next A10 team which probably won’t have its excellent season rewarded with an NCAA Tournament bid is another set of Rams, this time in Rhode Island. Rhode Island has put together their best season in years with a 20-8 record at present, but unfortunately that still leaves them in 3rd place in the A10. Luckily their star player E.C. Matthews is only a sophomore so they’ll have some time to rebuild and try again, but it seems that the only way they make the NCAA tournament this season is by winning the A10 Tournament. That is by no means out of the question but it will definitely be difficult. I have hope that they can do it, and certainly want them to succeed, but we’ll have to see how they look once the A10 Tournament starts.\n\nThe now Curry-less Davidson Wildcats are back in the national picture this year as they’re sitting at 22-6 and 2nd place in the A10. They once again have a spectacular offense (8th in the country in scoring in fact) led by Tyler Kalinoski and Jack Gibbs. Four of their 5 starts score in double digits and their fifth man Peyton Aldridge nearly does with 9.7 points per game. By all accounts this looks like vintage Davidson, even if they lack the star power of having a Curry on the roster. I’m not certain that their resume is strong enough to secure an at large bid if they don’t win the A10 Tournament however so these next 10 days will be crucial for their season.\n\nBut the real team to beat in the A10 this year appears to be last year’s Elite 8 Cinderella darling Dayton. The best thing that came out of that run for Dayton was that they were able to hang on to their head coach Archie Miller (brother of Arizona’s Sean Miller). With Miller at the helm the Flyers have a chance to start a nice little tournament run here a la VCU in 2011. To be honest I’m not sure that they’re the best team in the A10 (I’ve thought that was VCU all season long, but again injuries derailed them) but they’ve somehow ground their way to a 13-4 conference record and currently sit tied with Davidson atop the A10. This team really doesn’t look that impressive on paper, but neither did last year’s team that almost made its way to the Final Four, and with Archie Miller at the helm you can be certain that they’ll be well prepared and well coached going into the tournament. My gut tells me that they’re ripe for an upset in the A10 Tournament, but my heart says 2014’s Cinderella can run it back. We’ll have to see what the truth is March 11th when the A10 Tournament starts, but no matter what I’m confident the Atlantic 10 will provide us with some great basketball throughout the duration of that Tournament.\n\nIts bowl season again. Time to watch Whatstatearetheyin University square off against Ididn’tknowtheyhadafootballteam State. But this year there’s a little twist added to the shenanigans. This is the first year of the College Football Playoff, which, in its current composition, only contains 4 teams: Alabama, Oregon, Florida State, and Ohio State. Now, if you’ve been following college football all year you already knew that, but what you also knew is that this list was conspicuously missing two major, yearlong contenders for playoff spots: TCU and Baylor.\n\nEven though TCU had leapt up to #3 in the Playoff Committee’s rankings before the final week of the season, and even though Baylor had a win over TCU, and the same 11-1 record as them, both Big 12 Schools were left wanting. This appears to have been a result of the Playoff Committee’s decision to place a major emphasis on “Conference Champions” when picking their Chosen Four. Moreover, even though the Big 12 attempted to declare TCU and Baylor “Co-Champions” the Committee wasn’t buying it.\n\n[One True Champion! Unless of course we think we can sneak 2 teams into the Playoff… wait, we’re getting 0 in?!]\n\nThe Committee want their playoff teams to play in, and win, a Conference Title Game. And with only 10 teams in the Big 12 (a result of the 2012 Great Conference Reshuffle) the Big 12 is not allowed to have a Conference Title Game (per ridiculous NCAA rule #92183475).\n\nSo its too late for either of the Big 12’s power teams this year, but if the conference doesn’t want to be competing at a disadvantage into perpetuity (or at least until someone gets their act together and realizes that a 16 team (or at LEAST 8) playoff is the ideal anyway, the Big 12 is going to have to seriously consider expanding back to 12 teams (hurray for sensible names!).\n\nSo because I love conference realignment (because it gives me hope that NDSU will have an opportunity to hop up into an FBS conference) let’s take a look where the fake Big 12 could turn to become that actual Big 12.\n\nThe first and most logical place for the Big 12 to look in its poaching is the Mountain West Conference. The Mountain West is far and away the best “Non-Power Five” Conference for football. Their members consistently out perform members of Power Five Conferences, and have been known to win many big games against even the best of the Power Five.\n\nYou’ll also notice that two of those former MWC champions in the above videos (TCU and Utah) are no longer in the MWC, but have been poached by bigger conferences (The Big 12 and PAC 12 respectively). So it seems to make the most sense that the Big 12 would first look to the Mountain West (it is both a geographic match and competitive match) to expand its conference.\n\nAs far as I see it there are 4 Mountain West teams that may be competitive enough to succeed in the Big 12 (Air Force is very competitive, but with their unique recruiting restrictions [anyone who wants to go to Air Force to play football also has to want to… y’know… join the Air Force for 7 years] I don’t think they’d be a fit for the Big 12).\n\nThe first is Boise State. Competitively speaking they are obviously the first choice. They have made a habit of beating Big 12 schools in recent years (including the infamous Fiesta Bowl win over Oklahoma) and have been relevant on a national stage for a decade now. However, they never seem to be a target by any large conferences, which I have to imagine stems in large part from their isolated geography. Now, I won’t put any kind of geographic inanity past the Big 12 after they moronically allowed West Virginia into their conference, but I can’t imagine they want to make that mistake twice.\n\nThe next best Flavor of the Day would be Colorado State. They’re a better geographic fit than Boise. They have the student population and endowments to fit in with the Big 12. They are consistently competitive in both the big money college sports (Men’s Basketball and College Football). And this year they made a good deal of noise on the national scene… however, that noise was primarily because they were losing their head coach to Florida. So if the Big 12 pulled the trigger on Colorado State, they’d likely be buying high and may regret it as CSU is perhaps set to regress slightly for the next couple seasons.\n\nUtah State would also be a great option. They fit geographically. Have the endowments and students to match Big 12 programs. They’re consistently competitive in both Football and Basketball. The same could be said about Nevada (although they’re a far inferior geographic fit). Neither of these schools has major clout in the public consciousness though which could scare off the Big 12 if they don’t want to be perceived as diluting their conference.\n\nHowever, its entirely possible that the MWC teams hold together. The MWC commissioner made impassioned pleas to strip the collapsing Big East of their automatic qualifier status and grant it to the Mountain West when the big conference shakeups were going on. And even though the BCS is now gone, and that battle was therefore removed from the equation, it could rear up again. If Conference Titles matter as much as they seem to to the Committee, we could eventually move toward an 8 team playoff where the Power 5 each get an Automatic Qualification for their Champion, and there is no reason to believe the MWC won’t fight for (and perhaps receiver) the same status. So anyway, let’s take a look at a couple other options if noone from the MWC wants to make the leap.\n\nI think BYU is very serious about remaining independent (Notre Dame of the West I guess…), but I can’t imagine they wouldn’t at least consider a move to the Big 12 if asked. Moreover, this move would allow the Big 12 and their potential target to skip a lot of red tape, as they don’t need to remove a team from its current conference, but rather simply need to add an independent. Add in the fact that BYU has major football pedigree, and they’d seem like a great match.\n\nAfter that the contenders start to look a lot worse. SMU has football history (not all of it good), and they’re located in the Big 12’s backyard, but they’ve been atrocious of late. Tulsa could possibly grow to compete in the Big 12 but I imagine if they joined tomorrow they’d spend the better part of a decade getting beaten down (perhaps a bottom dwellers rivalry with Kansas is in the works!).\n\nAt the end of the day, all these schools have arguments for and against their joining the Big 12. Moreover, the Big 12 may not even decide to expand at all. But if they want to erase the risk of having two playoff caliber teams left out of competition like this year, they may be better safe than sorry, and may get to play kingmaker for one of these well deserving schools.\n\nBut now, because I am an enormous homer, I have a quick aside which of course involves NDSU. Conference shakeups always get me excited that maybe the guys running NDSU will decide to be proactive and push to join an FBS conference. Now I’m not saying NDSU will be targeted by the Big 12 (they wont… even though it may be a pipe dream of mine…) or even that they’ll be able to join the Mountain West to replace a hypothetically poached team (another dream of mine), but when one conference makes a move (in this case the Big 12) the repercussions always flow downhill, which means that eventually, at the end of the road there could be an FBS conference looking for a new team, and NDSU could fit the bill perfectly.\n\nI’ve talked about this time and again so I’ll keep this short but heres the issue. The conferences lower down in FBS (and therefore closer to NDSU’s current status) aren’t good geographic fits for the Bison at all (Sun Belt, Conference USA) OR if they are a good geographic fit, they are not likely to lose teams in this Big 12 shakeup (MAC) which means NDSU likely won’t benefit from this change.\n\nThe larger shame is that the two conferences which form the bulk of this discussion (The Big 12 and the Mountain West) both would form excellent geographic homes for NDSU. While competing in the Big 12 would be difficult it would be nowhere near impossible as NDSU has beaten both Kansas State and Iowa State in back to back years, and Kansas a couple years before that. Moreover, NDSU could come in and compete immediately in the Mountain West. They would absolutely feast on the bottom tier of the Mountain West (Wyoming, Hawaii, San Jose State, UNLV, New Mexico) and at least compete with the best (although it would take several years of growth before NDSU could consistently beat the Boise’s or the Utah State’s of the world. And other than Hawaii the geographic concerns wouldn’t be the end of the world (NDSU already travels to southern California on multiple occasions for small sports such as track etc).\n\nIn any event both these conferences would make great homes for the Bison. But that will likely not be coming any time in the near future (MWC) or any time at all (Big 12). These conferences would need new teams that could begin playing right now, and if NDSU moved to the FBS there would be an initial ban on postseason play (just as there was when the Bison went from DII to DI FCS in the first place). These two conferences are not “starter” conferences. These are finished products. They’re not in the business of doing a favor for a school which is just now moving out of the FCS ranks, regardless of how successful that school may be.\n\nI don’t know what needs to happen to pull NDSU up to the FBS ranks, but I’m getting pretty sick of waiting, and I hope this new shakeup happens, and opens some doors for the Bison.\n\nThis is Part 2 of a multipart series. For part one please click here. Or just scroll down. I’m not a very prolific writer soooo they’re pretty easy to find.\n\nOur Little Baby is All Growns Up:\n\nWe’ve already talked about why now is the moment NDSU needs to act in terms of making the leap to bigger and better pastures. But I want to slow down for a second and explain just how drastically NDSU Football has outgrown its surroundings.\n\nFirst off, lets start with the quick and easy. NDSU is the best team in NCAA Division 1-AA football right now. Nobody denies that. (26/26 on first place votes).\n\nTheres no question that NDSU is at the top of the 1-AA ranks, but a simple coaches poll like this doesn’t tell us just how dominant NDSU is and just how overmatched their competition is. For that we need to get a little bit stat nerdy. Enter the Sagarin metrics. For those of you who don’t know, Jeff Sagarin is the Michelangelo of college football ranking metrics. He’s the man when it comes to computer college football rankings and helps work on the BCS’s own computer ranking systems (though his own system is slightly different, and I believe better. Although its still flawed in small ways, but nothing is perfect.) Lucky for us Sagarin ranks all D1 football programs together whether they’re 1-AA or 1-A so we can get some especially interesting comparisons. So let’s take a look at what Jeff has to say about NDSU 8 games into their attempted 3-peat. Don’t worry… we don’t need to scroll down because NDSU is not only in the top 50, they’re #37 overall. (these pictures are gonna be a little small so please click on them to get the full size view)\n\nNot only is NDSU 18 spots ahead of the next closest 1-AA competition (Eastern Illinois #55) these numbers put them above a staggering number of quality 1-A programs. For one thing, it puts them above traditional Mid Major Football darling Boise State(#38). It puts them ahead of both an undefeated Northern Illinois (#51) team and undefeated Fresno State(#52) (both likely to be this years BCS party crashers as long as they finish out their slate undefeated). But it also puts them ahead of some MAJOR traditional powers. Tennessee, admittedly down from their traditional success but still an elite SEC program is ranked #44. They’re ahead of an Iowa team (#42) that almost beat undefeated Ohio State last weekend. Ahead of big brother Minnesota (#59) and even Craig Bohl’s alma mater (and the school that fired him, sending him to NDSU) Nebraska (#46). NDSU is not just good, they’re good no matter who you compare them to. This NDSU team could hop into any D1-A program this year and compete, even a BCS conference. I’m not saying they’re run the table there, but this team would have no problem winning 6 games at the 1-A level this year and making a bowl game. There simply is no gap between NDSU and the upper division.\n\nWhere to Captain?\n\nSet a course for the stars Lieutenant…\n\nSo where should NDSU look to land if they make the jump? Where is the right fit for the Lord of the Plains, the Mighty Buffalo? After all, when we left off yesterday we had determined it would take a perfect fit to get the “visionaries” in NDSU’s Athletic Department to agree to a move, even in the face of insurmountable evidence. Well, we need to consider a few factors, primarily geography (and the ability of fans to travel to road games) and competitive balance within the division (we’ll have our new best friend for life Jeff help us out with that). So I’ve pulled together a few conferences currently in existence that I think would represent the best fit for NDSU athletics. (again, football is going to be the primary deciding factor in these moves supplemented minimally by basketball, because as stated before conference realignment is all about football money). And we’ll move from the most plausible to the least plausible.\n\nThe Big 10\n\nThis would be a dream scenario for the Bison. Fan’s in Fargo primarily consider themselves part of the Big 10 umbrella (even more so now that Nebraska has moved from the Big 12 to the Big 10) so for the fan’s its a natural fit. Geographically, you could have instant COMPETITIVE rivalries with the Golden Gophers (aka traditional whipping post of NDSU football with the only blip being a lucky last second come behind victory in 2006 when NDSU was still fielding a fully DII roster) Iowa, and Wisconsin. And Nebraska really isn’t that far either considering how well NDSU fans traveled all the way to Manhatten Kansas this year. And NDSU already plays teams on a yearly basis from Illinois and Ohio. So the fit is there in terms of fan mentality and regional identity. Its more or less PERFECT geographically. Moreover, the style of play for NDSU would fit the slower paced, power running and mauling defense that is traditionally the Big 10’s MO. They would certainly make a hell of a lot more sense than who the Big 10 is ACTUALLY adding next year in Rutgers and Maryland. Those school could not POSSIBLY be further from the Big 10’s traditional fanbase, and even fans of those schools don’t seem to fully embrace the move. In all the x factors this really is a match made in Heaven for NDSU, and really should be for the Big Ten as well. Let’s take a at the numbers and see how NDSU would fit in this year.\n\nWe’ll throw NDSU into the “Legends” division, because as we’ve already stated that is their geographic ideal situation and its the less competitive division, meaning we could expect a quicker rebound from NDSU after moving up. As it currently stands NDSU would be the 3rd best team in the “Legends” falling only behind Michigan State (#19) and Michigan (#35) which is definitely understandable. But its way closer than you would think. NDSU and traditional power Michigan are neck and neck. I don’t think NDSU could consistently beat Big Blue, but if they played 10 times this year on a TRULY neutral site I’d say NDSU could win 3 of them. Michigan is down and NDSU is at an apex. That will change over time but RIGHT NOW NDSU could compete at the top of that division. Moreover, even when we look at the conference as a whole, NDSU would rank 5th overall in the 13 team league (12 actual members plus NDSU would make 13).\n\nBut let’s also take a look at Rutgers and Maryland once more, the two schools the Big Ten is nonsensically adding next year. Rutgers has an abysmal ranking (by NDSU’s standards) of #72 overall and Maryland, even after a quick start and a top 25 ranking this year is all the way down at #63. Both a far cry from NDSU’s #37. So had the Big 10 chosen to look in its own backyard and added NDSU, not only would they have found an expansion team which fit their mores geographically, culturally, and stylistically, THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN ADDING A BETTER TEAM!!!\n\nNow, obviously the Big 10 added those two schools for financial reasons, not necessarily football reasons (they wanted access to both the Washington DC and New York City TV markets for the Big 10 network) and NDSU brings much less to the table economically, but as a pure football decision, NDSU and the Big 10 would have been a match made in Heaven.\n\nThe Big 12\n\nBut if not the Big 10, there is another nearby BCS conference that would make sense for the Bison. The Big 12 got brutally raided in the conference realignment shakeup losing Texas A&M and Missouri to the SEC, Nebraska to the Big 10, Colorado to the PAC-12, and almost losing Texas either to the PAC-12 or to independence (which would surely have sunk the conference a la the old Big East / current AAC). However, they didn’t go under (thanks entirely to Texas staying) and pulled the traditional Dutchman in the Dike by adding the West Virginia Mountaineers. But let’s take a little look and see if NDSU could have been a better fit.\n\nFirst off, the team the Big 12 tried to stop the bleeding with, West Virginia, makes absolutely no sense geographically. They are off on an island and have NOTHING to do with the Big 12 culturally (Texas football dominance), but do have ties stylistically (Dana Holgorsen plays an undeniably Big 12 style game with his wide open spread offense, and he also came with Big 12 ties. WVU also started the season last year highly ranked, making them look like a strong addition to shore up the lines last year). However, that addition and the geographic misfit look a lot worse this year while WVU is hanging out at a spectacular #69 ranking, and outside of wrecking Oklahoma State’s season they might as well have not played at all this season. NDSU, on the other hand, would fare a little better standing at #37 which would put them as the 7th best team in the ten member, divisionless Big 12. However, the Big 12’s numbers may be inflated. They have taken a lot of flak in the past for backloading their schedules so that they can raise their rankings early in the year and improve the chances one of their members makes it to a title game. Moreover, #32 overall is Kansas State, a team NDSU has already beaten this year and Texas Tech is certainly looking a lot more suspect after their loss last weekend. So it isn’t out of the question that NDSU could be the 5th best team in the Big 12 at least this year (surely getting blown out by Baylor, beaten down by Texas, and losing to the two Oklahoma schools). So NDSU could at least be competitive in the Big 12.\n\nThis kid is well aware the NDSU could compete in the Big 12.\n\nFurthermore, they’ve made a habit of playing Big 12 teams in the recent past in addition to Kansas State, so the geographic connection, although definitely worse than the case in the Big 10, wouldn’t be horrible. If the Big 12 added a second school (either from the 1-AA ranks with SDSU or one of the Montana Schools or even grabbing a Mountain West Team such as Colorado State) in addition to NDSU, thus bringing their members back up to an ACTUAL 12, they could also hypothetically split into two 6 team divisions. Taking Colorado State as our hypothetically partner then you could have a Big 12 composed of a North Division consisting of NDSU, Kansas, Kansas State, Iowa State, Colorado State, and West Virginia (… dammit WVU… screwing everything up…) and a South of the 2 Oklahoma schools and the 4 remaining Texas schools. In such a system I see no reason why NDSU couldn’t contend for a Big 12 North crown consistently. All of those schools ebb and flow rather violently throughout history, and NDSU’s consistency could easily keep them in the top three of such a configuration year in and year out. The travel to West Virginia would frankly be impossible (so would the Texas teams in large part) but everything else is more than do-able and you could even create a legitimate rivalry with Iowa State.\n\nSo it wouldn’t be perfect, its not a stylistic fit, but given just a few dominoes falling at the right time, NDSU could grow into a culturally assimilated Big 12 team (especially with an Iowa State rivalry) and be consistently competitive in the Big 12 (especially if you consider the inroads it would provide into the fertile Texas football recruiting grounds. And by fertile I mean like octo-mom levels of fertility. Seriously. Ever seen Friday Night Lights? So much football talent in Texas…TIM RIGGINS!!!!) And it could be a win for the Big 12 too as long as NDSU proves competitive. They could help shore up their numbers, getting back to a 12 team conference and hopefully increase their stability as they move forward in this unstable time of conference realignment.\n\nfuture NDSU Fullback Tim Riggins\n\nHowever, I think we all know that there is approximately a -72% chance that NDSU could hop straight into a BCS power conference straight from DI-AA so let’s take a look at some more logical and/or viable solutions.\n\nThe Mountain West\n\nWith the absolute annihilation of the WAC (NDSU’s true best case scenario / ideal match of a conference… once upon a time) the Mountain West is probably the best case (and perhaps most realistic) option for NDSU at this time. However, the unfortunate reality is that its honestly not that realistic, as the fit isn’t nearly as obvious as it would be in say the Big 10.\n\nOn the positive side, NDSU already has a relationship playing several MWC teams in football (beating Colorado State and only losing to Wyoming on a last second field goal [as an aside… Wyoming brings infinitely less to the table than NDSU and yet they have been competing at the DI-A level for decades now… just to put this absurd debate in perspective… seriously I can’t come away from this point… WYOMING HAS BEEN DOING THIS SINCE THE 1960s FARGO!!! PLEASE REALIZE THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE]), and they already have relationships with some Mountain West schools in the non profit sports so I don’t really see this being a difficult change across the board.\n\nGeographically the shift would be difficult but manageable. Playing the California teams is a stretch, but Fargo’s airport has direct flights to LAX anyway, and again the smaller sports already fly to California to compete on a regular basis so there is no reason the football/basketball team or the fans couldn’t do so. Traveling to Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah is do-able so its not that big of a stretch.\n\nStylistically the MWC is very diverse so even if there isn’t the same appeal as the Big 10 there certainly isn’t a detraction. The MWC shouldn’t have any problem accepting a hard nosed, consistent defensive team like the Bison (perhaps even to replace the loss of a similarly minded TCU team to the Big 12).\n\nMoreover, competitiveness is probably NDSU’s strongest argument. During the Boise State/TCU glory years, the argument was made repeatedly that the MWC deserved BCS automatic qualifier status over conferences such as the inferior Big East. The conference has maintained the elite football status even after losing members such as TCU and BYU, and yet our old buddy Jeff would have you believe NDSU could immediatel be the class of the MWC. NDSU’s #37 ranking would put them at #1 in the MWC, one spot ahead of #38 Boise State.\n\nNDSU could slide right into the mix in the “Mountain” conference with little difficulty geographically or competitively. While the geography doesn’t mesh quite as well as it would playing schools like Minnesota and Iowa its certainly not difficult, and I have no doubt that NDSU coudl compete immediately in what has become the single best “mid major” football conference in DI-A. I’m honestly not sure what else to say here because this just makes too much sense to hammer on… The MWC has even become a competitive (if slightly overrated) college basketball conference which NDSU could compete in and eventually earn the chance to receive even an at large NCAA tourney bid, not just a single seat conference champion slot as is the case in the Summit. Moreover, while the MWC appears satisfied with its current 12 team format there is no reason to believe continued realignment will not result in further pilfering of their ranks by BCS AQ conferences, giving them added incentive to buttress their current formation with up an coming DI-AA teams like NDSU. An invite from the Mountain West Conference would be mana from Heaven for NDSU, and there is absolutely positively NO reason why the NDSU Athletic Department should not be calling Craig Thompson ever. single. day. and serenading him with Peter Frampton songs.\n\nI LOVE YOU CRAIG!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE YOU!!!!!!!\n\nGet your shit together Gene Taylor and work on your falsetto dammit!!!\n\nThe MAC\n\nIf, however, the MWC bid couldn’t materialize (The appear to be incredibly satisfied with their current 12 team construction) the MAC could be a legitimate backup plan for the Bison. Again, the fit, albeit stretched, is there geographically, and by extension culturally (the MAC being somewhat of a Big 10 Junior). NDSU has no problem playing teams as far east as Ohio, and the stretch to Massachusettes and New York can’t be any more painful than the streches to Texas or California would be. NDSU would be right at home in the MAC’s West division, and, big surprise, they could dominate this conference competitively.\n\nNoone in this conference is really even that close to NDSU this year. Even BCS hopeful (and repeat challenger in that department) Northern Iowa likely wouldn’t stand up to NDSU in this particular year. Again, I feel like there isn’t much to say with this conference in terms of convincing people of its viability. The only problem anyone could have would be the occasional trips to MA and NY, but those likely would only happen once every 4 years. Seriously. There is no reason for NDSU not to fit in the MAC. So if Mr. Thompson isn’t a fan of Frampton maybe we could hit the MAC maybe we can just direct our love toward the MAC? C’mon Jon Steinbrecher… you know we’d be good to you…!\n\nJust give us a chance!"
