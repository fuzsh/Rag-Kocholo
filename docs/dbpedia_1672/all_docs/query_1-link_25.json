        "text": "For any of you that enjoy wild finishes to playoff races, might I suggest tuning in to some Mountain West Baseball the next two weeks? Four weeks ago, the Fresno State baseball team appeared to be coasting to an easy first seed in the conference tournament. The Bulldogs have lost 7 straight to MW competition, their run production has dropped from over 7 runs per game to 4 runs per game, and the pitching staff’s ERA has ballooned to 7.5 over those games compared to the season’s average of 5.37. The last six losses have been inflicted by two teams that had been struggling early in the season, San Jose State and San Diego State.\n\nThe end result has been a dramatic tightening in the conference standings. Currently 1 ½ games separates the top five teams. Any team in the top five could easily end up at the top or just out of the conference tournament. San Jose State has the toughest road to the top spot due to having only 3 conference games remaining, while all the other teams have six.\n\nThe margin is so tight between the top 5, any power ranking will have some judgment involved, and having grown up watching Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Don Sutton, and Orel Hershiser, et al. led the Dodgers to multiple strong seasons, I tend to favor strong pitching. My rankings follow:\n\nPower Rankings\n\nFresno State - Amid their 7 game winless streak against MW foes, the Bulldogs managed to win 2 of 3 from Washington State, so they still know how to win. Although the pitching has struggled a little recently, the hitters have dropped quite a bit in production, as I noted above. Some of that can probably be attributed to normal slumps, and I expect the Bulldogs to recover going forward, but they have been exposed as beatable.\n\nNevada - The Wolf Pack have a leading contender for MW Pitcher of the Year in Jason Doktorczyk leading their weekends off and a variety of other good pitchers to fill in after and provide effective long relief. They also own the tiebreaker with the Falcons and the Spartans should they finish in a tie with either.\n\nAir Force - The Falcons haven’t been very consistent at anything this year except for #1 pitcher Seungmin Shim and preseason All American Jay Thomason, but they have found a variety of ways to win games. Chase Spencer, Jake Grieving and Charlie Jones have had some big series, they lead the league in stolen bases and sacrifice hits, and relievers Doyle Gehring and Kyle Moats have had good performances on the mound that allowed them to win some tight games.\n\nNew Mexico - The Lobos are a dangerous team because of their relentless offensive onslaught. However, they are also dangerous to themselves by allowing a lot of runs. The staff has an ERA of 8.24 and allows a batting average of .327, which is higher than their own outstanding batting average of .325, which is good enough for 5th in NCAA baseball. Most games are a crap shoot to see which team can score more runs.\n\nSan Jose State - The Spartans have turned around and become the team that many expected this year. After sweeping Fresno State and winning 2 of 3 from UNLV, the Spartans lost 2 of 3 to the Falcons on late homers by two hot hitters, Charlie Jones and Jay Thomason. They have the toughest road to the playoff with only 3 games left and on the bad end of tiebreakers with Nevada and Air Force. They’ll play New Mexico in San Jose for their final 3 games on the last weekend of the regular season.\n\nUNLV - The Rebels are essentially out of the race with only 3 games left against conference leader Fresno State in Fresno.\n\nSan Diego State - The Aztecs have improved over the last few weeks. The pitching staff has dramatically cut their free passes down, but unfortunately, they lost star freshman Colby Turner to an injury. The sweep of Fresno should provide some confidence for the last two weeks of the season.\n\nMountain West Players of the Week\n\nPlayer of the Week\n\nAir Force’s Charlie Jones\n\nSophomore Jones went 7 for 17 on the week, with 2 doubles and 5 home runs and 12 RBIs, including a game-winning homer in the first game of the San Jose series.\n\nPitcher of the Week\n\nSan Diego State’s Omar Serrano\n\nSerrano led the Aztecs to a 3-1 win over Fresno State by pitching 7 innings, allowing 4 hits and 3 walks and 1 earned run."
