        "text": "SAN DIEGO—Striking out over twice as often as hitting, no. 3 San Jose State (29-28, 16-14 MW) struggled to find any offensive rhythm in a 7-3 loss Friday night to no. 4 Air Force (29-27, 15-15 MW) in the Mountain West Baseball Tournament at Tony Gwynn Stadium, with the championship game on the line.\n\nWith a career high 13 strikeouts, Doyle Gehring (3-3) was the winning pitcher for Air Force. Ethan Ross (1-5) was the losing pitcher.\n\n“We swung underneath the fastball quite a bit today,” said San Jose State head coach Brad Sanfilippo.\n\nSan Jose State had only six hits while striking out 14 times against three Air Force pitchers. Offensively, Air Force found ways to score with both small ball and power hitting.\n\nIn the third, Air Force twice reached on bunts, the second time resulting in an RBI single by Blake Covin. Ross limited Air Force to a 1-0 lead after escaping a one-out, bases loaded jam with a shallow fly out and strikeout.\n\nAir Force then jumped to a 4-0 lead, thanks to solo homers by Jay Thomason in the fourth and Gabriel Garcia in the fifth, followed by an Thomason RBI single. In the final three innings, Air Force scored three more times, capped by a ninth inning solo homer by Cayden Zimmerman for the third team homer of the night.\n\nHowever, San Jose State made sure to avoid a shutout with three runs in the ninth starting with a James Shimashita bases loaded walk. Pinch hitting in the nine spot, Ruben Mercado hit a sharp grounder to third but got an RBI single after beating out the throw. Robert Hamchuk then had an RBI sac fly to deep right.\n\n“The character of our guys is that we’re not going to go away. We’re not going to quit,” said Sanfilippo.\n\nThe conference tournament has a double elimination format where teams are disqualified after losing twice. Earlier Friday, no. 1 UNLV had a stunning 0-for-2 exit with a 7-3 loss to no. 2 Nevada. Among the three remaining teams, Air Force is 1-0, with Nevada and San Jose State 1-1.\n\nOn Saturday, San Jose State will begin at 1:30 p.m. (PT) against Nevada in an elimination game for both teams. The winner will face Air Force at 6 p.m. (PT). Air Force is one win away from winning the tournament, so Saturday will mark Air Force’s first Mountain West championship game appearance since 2000, the program’s first year having moved from the WAC to MW.\n\nA win Friday would have put San Jose State one win away from winning the tournament. Instead, the path has become much more difficult with three wins needed, first against Nevada then twice against Air Force. This year, San Jose State has won three out of seven matchups against Nevada but only one out of four against Air Force.\n\nAll three remaining teams have never won the Mountain West Tournament. However, Nevada won the regular season conference title in 2015, 2018, and 2021."
