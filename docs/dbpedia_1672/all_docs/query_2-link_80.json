        "text": "Getting to the state championship game with the Eugene Challengers felt like another bad dream for Aiden Hazen.\n\nHazen played in the 4A state championship game in football his sophomore year and again this past school year in football and baseball, his senior year for Marist Catholic High School, but had fallen short each of those times.\n\n\"Here we are, but then like, oh, something bad's gonna happen,\" Hazen told The Register-Guard on Monday.\n\nBut it was the opposite of what Hazen dreamed of as he delivered a walk-off single in extra innings to secure the Challengers a 5-4 win against the Mid Valley Southpaws to remain undefeated in the American Legion baseball state tournament.\n\nIt wasn't until the Challengers' final game of the tournament that the feelings really began to sink in for Hazen.\n\n\"It was really good to see Grady (Saunders) have a really good pitching performance, and the team rallied behind and finally get the job done,\" Hazen added. \"It was very special, and I was very happy.\"\n\nSaunders took to the mound in the final game, striking out 11 to lead the team to a 2-0 victory over Mid-Valley to capture the Challengers' fifth Oregon American Legion crown and first since 2021.\n\n\"Coach (Kenny) Niles made it a point to make me go get the trophy, so that was really special for me and what he has done for my baseball career,\" Hazen added.\n\nThe excitement hasn't stopped for Hazen, and he said he and his teammates will need to keep playing team baseball to be successful.\n\nChallengers headed to Northwest Regionals\n\nThe Challengers' summer baseball season continues in Billings, Montana, for the 2024 Northwest Regionals. The double-elimination tournament will start Wednesday and be played over the next five days.\n\nThe Challengers (46-8) went 5-0 during the state tournament. Eugene will open the regional tournament against last year's regional champion and World Series runner-up Cheyenne (Wyoming) at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"They have one really good front-end arm, so we're gonna have to play small ball,\" Niles said. \"We're gonna have to try to create some runs. It's undetermined now, but we'll probably go with (right-hand pitcher) Grady Saunders and he doesn't give up a lot of runs.\"\n\nFollow along at registerguard.com for results and scores during the regional tournament.\n\nA look back at the Challengers' state tournament sweep\n\nThe Challengers, as hosts, earned an automatic bid into the state tournament for the second straight year.\n\nNew to the team this season was Saunders, a sophomore right-handed pitcher who led Thurston to the second of back-to-back 5A state titles against West Albany in June. He had been recruited to join the Challengers by his Colts teammates.\n\n\"Eli Crist and Easton McDonald told me that I should come play, and that'd be the best summer of your life,\" Saunders said. \"And it has been so far, definitely the most fun I've ever had playing baseball.\"\n\nSaunders dominated in the first game of the tournament, leading the Challengers to a 6-2 win against the Grants Pass Nuggets.\n\nNiles said Mid-Valley, a team comprised of West Albany players, exposed them to situational plays.\n\n\"They were able to get five bunts for base hits and their short game was really good, and we didn't defend it very well at all,\" Niles said.\n\nThe Challengers' late scoring efforts, including Caiden Gould's four RBIs, lifted the team to an 11-4 win over the Portland Barbers during day three.\n\n\"We're really good at moving runners around, whether it's bunting, when the runners are on first and second with no outs,\" Caden Richardson said. \"They give themselves up because they can trust the next guy that comes up is going to score.\"\n\nWhile the Challengers cruised to an 8-2 win against the Roseburg Doc Stewart's to clinch their spot in the championship game, Niles was feeling superstitious after the team's tournament played out the exact same as last year.\n\nTo disrupt the superstition, Niles held a 45-minute practice following the win on how to \"defend the bunt game.\"\n\nNorthwest regional schedule, results\n\nWednesday, Aug. 7\n\nGame 1: Cheyenne (WY) vs. Eugene, 9:30 a.m. (live stats)\n\nGame 2: Anchorage (Alaska) vs. Pocatello (ID), following Game 1\n\nGame 3: Bellevue (WA) vs. Montana, 4 p.m.\n\nGame 4: Ft.
