        "text": "SAN DIEGO – In the highest-scoring final game in Mountain West Championship history, Fresno State's offensive explosion at the plate was too much for San Jose State in a 16-11 slugfest on Sunday afternoon at Tony Gwynn Stadium. The Diamond 'Dogs captured their second MW tournament title in program history, and their first since 2019.\n\nTyler Davis and Justin Stransky brought in half of Fresno State's runs as both went 3-for-5 with four RBIs. Jaykob Acosta got the win, striking out seven and allowing one run in 3 ⅔ innings in relief of Jake Dixon who started his second game of the week.\n\nMurf Gray was named the MW Championship Most Valuable Player. The sophomore was 11-for-21 at the plate in five games, driving in seven RBIs and scoring eight runs. Seven of his 11 hits went for extra bases, recording five doubles and two home runs.\n\nGray was joined on the All-Tournament Team by Acosta, Stransky, Noah Beal, Tommy Hopfe and Jake Riding.\n\nHOW IT HAPPENED\n\nThe Spartan offense got going early, scoring the first run of the game with a solo home run in the bottom of the first. A double down the left field line almost allowed the Spartans to score another run, but the relay from Bobby Blandford to Murf Gray to catcher Tyler Davis was in time to get the runner out at home.\n\nFresno State's bats got hot in the third as Michael McKernan doubled down the left-field line with two outs on the board. Ben Newton drove in McKernan with his first hit of the game, a single to right field, and crossed the plate himself after a two-run bomb from Tommy Hopfe.\n\nBlandford and Justin Stransky hit back-to-back home runs to opposite ends of the ballpark in the fourth to keep the Diamond 'Dog offense rolling. San Jose State responded with a solo shot to center field in the bottom of the frame to halve the Bulldogs lead at 6-3.\n\nThe hits kept coming in the fifth as the four, six and eight hitters in the lineup all recorded RBIs. Grady Morgan doubled to bring in Hopfe. Singles from Davis and Stransky plated another three runs as the advantage grew to eight.\n\nJaykob Acosta sent the Spartans down in order in the bottom of the fifth, finishing it with back-to-back strikeouts.\n\nFresno State batted around in the sixth. The 'Dogs loaded the bases with no outs. Eddie Saldivar hit a sacrifice fly to center to bring in McKernan. After Morgan was hit by a pitch, a single from Gray brought in Newton. With a 2-0 count, Davis ripped a shot down the left line to clear the bases. A pitching change did not cool the bats as Blandford singled and Stransky doubled to score Davis.\n\nWith the Bulldogs leading 16-3, the Spartans used four home runs over the next three innings to creep back to within five heading into the ninth.\n\nAfter the Bulldogs were held scoreless in the ninth, Hopfe allowed back-to-back singles to start the bottom of the inning. The senior closer then shut the door with a pair of flyouts bookending a strikeout.\n\nNOTES\n\nFresno State won its second Mountain West tournament championship and its first since 2019.\n\nFresno State captured its 10th conference tournament title overall.\n\nFresno State will head to the NCAA Regionals for the first time since 2019.\n\nAfter entering the 2024 tournament with a 6-6 record in Mountain West elimination games, the Bulldogs won four straight this weekend.\n\nFresno State won its first game on Day 4 of a Mountain West tournament. The 'Dogs were previously 0-3.\n\nHeading into their third game of the tournament, Fresno State had lost four straight games to Air Force and three straight to San Jose State. The Bulldogs eliminated the Falcons before twice defeating the Spartans.\n\nFresno State's 16 runs are the most in a Mountain West championship-clinching win since 2012.\n\nThe 16 runs are the second-most ever in the final game of a MW tournament.\n\nThe 27 combined runs are the most in the final game.\n\nFresno State's pitching staff recorded a tournament record 67 strikeouts, 18 more than the previous record of 49 set by San Diego State in 2001. Acosta, Jake Dixon and Noah Beal each accounted for 12 strikeouts.\n\nMurf Gray's five doubles this week tied the tournament record.\n\nTyler Davis had a team-high eight RBIs in the tournament while Gray and Tommy Hopfe each scored eight runs.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Diamond 'Dogs will await Monday's announcement of where they will be headed for the NCAA Regionals. The selection show can be watched tomorrow on ESPN2 at 9 a.m. PT.\n\n\"Fresno State Athletics - Elevate: Imagine the Possibilities\" - The Elevate Campaign provides a visionary roadmap to enhance and construct a series of athletic facilities to help further position Fresno State Athletics for sustained competitive success nationally, while also further serving as a source of pride and economic growth throughout California's Central Valley.
