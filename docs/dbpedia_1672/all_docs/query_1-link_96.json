        "text": "Courtesy of Utah State Athletics\n\nLOGAN, Utah – No. 16 Utah State men’s basketball (17-2, 5-1 MW) bounced right back into the win column with an 83-62 victory over Fresno State (8-10, 1-4 MW) inside the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum on Saturday afternoon.\n\nUtah State’s 5-1 start to Mountain West play is its second-best in its 11 years in the league trailing only the 2020-21 team that started MW play with a 9-0 record. The 17-2 start to the season is the sixth-best in school history behind the 2008-09 (25-2), the 2010-11 (22-2), the 2003-04 (20-2), the 2000-01 (18-2) and the 1959-60 (18-2) teams.\n\nFour Aggies scored in double figures on Saturday, with junior wing Great Osobor leading the way with a double-double of 20 points and 12 rebounds. Senior guard Ian Martinez added 14 points and graduate senior guard Darius Brown II had 11, while junior guard Josh Uduje scored 12 points off the bench. Martinez also logged a career-high six assists.\n\nAfter some back and forth to open the first half, an Osobor and-1 gave the Aggies the 32-20 edge with 5:45 to go. The teams traded buckets until a Martinez jumper and Osobor layup gave the Aggies the 40-27 lead heading into the half.\n\nFresno State trimmed the margin to four early in the second half, but an 8-2 Aggie run, capped by a Martinez layup, extended the lead back out to double digits at 49-39. A 10-0 USU spurt, bookended by a pair of Brown buckets, later put Utah State on top 73-51 with just under four minutes to go. The Aggies maintained the gap as a jumper from freshman forward Karson Templin sealed the 83-62 victory.\n\nThree Bulldogs scored in double figures, led by senior Isaiah Pope with 16 points, while senior Isaiah Hill logged a game-high 10 assists.\n\nOverall, USU shot 55.0 percent (33-of-60) from the field, 38.5 percent (5-of-13) from deep and 70.6 percent (12-of-17) at the free throw line. Fresno State shot 41.4 percent (24-of-58) from the field, 28.0 percent (7-of-25) from behind the arc and 77.8 percent (7-of-9) at the charity stripe.\n\nUtah State next takes on Boise State on the road on Saturday, Jan. 27, at 2 p.m., in a game broadcast on the Mountain West Network."
