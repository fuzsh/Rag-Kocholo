        "text": "PROVO -- A women's cross country national championship, two individual national titles in both women's track and men's gymnastics and a revitalized basketball team headlined the 1999-2000 BYU sports season. The Cougars were among the top 20 overall athletic programs in the nation with an 18th place finish in the Sears Cup.\n\nIn the inaugural season of the Mountain West Conference, the Cougars picked up where they left off in the WAC. The 1999-2000 sports season saw BYU produce five national champions, 38 All-Americans and 56 All-Conference athletes. Out of the 19 MWC sports, Cougar athletes claimed nearly half of the MWC Player of the Year and MWC Freshman of the Year awards, with nine in each category. They also claimed seven of the 19 MWC Coach of the Year awards. Cougar teams placed first or second in the conference in 15 of the 19 sports, with 11 first place finishes and four second place finishes. Some of the greatest performances of this past year included a No. 1 national finish by the women's cross country team, as well as No. 1 finishes by senior gymnasts Guard Young (vault) and Cortney Bramwell (rings), and female tracksters Susan Taylor (1,500-meter) and Tara Rohatinsky (10,000-meter). The men's basketball team had their best season in five years, posting wins over every team in the conference, placing second in the MWC tournament and making it to the third round of the NIT.\n\nWomen's Cross Country\n\nTo start the year off, the women's cross country team continued its dominance by winning a second NCAA title in three years. BYU began the year at No. 1, but after placing second behind Stanford in the Triple Crown and third behind Stanford and Arkansas in the Stanford Cross Country Invitational, BYU fell to fourth in the nation. But the Cougars turned it on when it counted the most, dominating the MWC Championships and going on to win the national title by a 53-point margin. Women's cross country becomes the first BYU team to win two national titles and they claimed the sixth NCAA team title in BYU history (men's volleyball, 1999; women's cross country, 1997; football, 1984; men's golf, 1981; men's track & field, 1970). The men's cross country team also dominated the MWC Championships and went on to place 30th in the nation.\n\nFootball\n\nIn September, the football team began the season by beating nemesis Washington on a last-second pass from senior Kevin Feterik to freshman Chris Hale. The next week, the conference season began when the Cougars delivered a thumping to No. 23 Colorado State, 34-13, in the first-ever MWC sporting event. With the two big victories, the Cougars jumped to No. 17 in the national rankings. After a loss to Virginia, BYU ran off six straight victories, securing at least a share of the first-ever MWC title. The wins moved the Cougars to a No. 12 ranking before losing to Wyoming and Utah in the final two games, which forced BYU to share the conference title with Colorado State and Utah. Despite two losses to finish the season, the Cougars received an invitation to play in the Motor City Bowl in Detroit against Marshall. Heisman finalist Chad Pennington and undefeated Marshall scored three touchdowns and held the Cougar ground attack to minus 16 yards rushing as the Thundering Herd beat the Cougars, 21-3, to remain undefeated on the year.\n\nWomen's Volleyball\n\nThe women's volleyball team put their No. 4 preseason national ranking on the line as they faced Michigan in their first match of the year at the Georgia Invitational. They lost to the Wolverines but went on to beat Georgia and Toledo in the same tournament. Throughout the season BYU lost only one conference match, winning the regular season conference title and advancing to the NCAA tournament. After victories over Princeton in the first round and Wisconsin in the second round, the Cougars found themselves in the Sweet 16 before losing to fourth ranked Florida. BYU finished the season with No. 9 and No. 13 national polls.\n\nSoccer\n\nIn soccer, the Cougars started the year with an overtime victory against Arizona State and ended the first year of MWC play with an overtime victory against San Diego State. The team finished the exciting year by winning the conference tournament, making the NCAA tournament and finishing the year at No. 20 in the nation. BYU lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament to No. 1 Santa Clara. This was the third year in a row that BYU has lost to Santa Clara in the tournament. The Cougars had a stingy defense that recorded 10 shut outs, including three in a row, and they were undefeated at home.\n\nWomen's & Men's Basketball\n\nBoth the women's and men's BYU basketball teams posted 20-plus wins on their way to second place finishes in their respective MWC tournaments. The women started the year with four straight wins before losing to No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara. The Cougars continued winning as they finished the year at 22-9 and made an appearance in the NCAA tournament. One of the most notable differences on BYU campus this year was the return of a winning men's basketball team. The Cougar basketball team brought some excitement back to the Marriott Center this year as they garnered victories over every conference opponent, including the first win over Utah in five years. The season also included a regular season sweep of conference champion, UNLV and victories over each in-state foe, Utah State, Weber State, Utah and Southern Utah. In Steve Cleveland's third year as head coach, the Cougars were invited to the NIT where they defeated Bowling Green in the first round and Southern Illinois in the second round before falling at Notre Dame in the quarterfinals.\n\nWomen's & Men's Gymnastics\n\nThe women's gymnastics team, led by sophomore All-American Kelly Parkinson, had another successful season, including a new all-time team high score of 196.525 against Southern Utah. The team scores at the end of the year were good enough to qualify them for Regionals, where they placed second behind Georgia. At the regional meet, a team score of 194.700 was good enough to qualify them for the NCAA meet. At nationals, the Cougars finished at No. 11 in the nation. This year's men's gymnastics team included two returning national champions in seniors Guard Young (vault) and Cortney Bramwell (rings). Both gymnasts successfully defended their titles, repeating as national champions once again in 2000. In its last season at BYU, men's gymnastics had its best season ever, breaking the single-meet team scoring record in the last regular season meet (228.525) and breaking it again in the team's last meet ever by scoring a 228.625 at the NCAA championships. The team finished the year at No. 7 in the nation.\n\nWrestling\n\nThe wrestling program, also in its last year at BYU, had one of its best years in recent memory, with five wrestlers qualifying for the NCAA tournament and a No. 37 national finish. Rangi Smart, Chris Miller, Aaron Holker, Trent Rollins and Rocky Smart all qualified for the NCAA tournament. The year included a fundraising meet at the Delta Center against the No. 1 team in the nation, Iowa, and two strong victories against No. 20 Oregon State and Air Force to finish the regular season.\n\nMen's Volleyball\n\nThe defending national champion men's volleyball team started the 2000 campaign with a victory over Loyola-Chicago and reeled off 11 straight home victories before Ohio State ended the Cougars' 40 game home win streak. The team recorded its fourth straight 15-win season with a record of 18-9. UCLA ended the Cougars' chances at another title by beating BYU 3-0 in the first round of the MPSF tournament. The Cougars finished third in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and sixth in the nation.\n\nWomen's & Men's Swimming & Diving\n\nBoth women's and men's swimming and diving teams finished first in the conference, with each team producing two All-Americans. Senior Rachelle Smith Kunkel was one dive away from a national title, but finished sixth overall. The women's team finished 29th nationally and the men finished at No. 33. The teams swept MWC Diver of the Year honors with Kunkel and senior Devan Porter while coach Keith Russell was named MWC Diving Coach of the Year.\n\nMen's & Women's Golf\n\nDespite a team-best second place regional finish, the men's golf team finished a disappointing fourth in the MWC tournament and 28th in the NCAA tournament. The team, which was ranked No. 6 nationally most of the year, was led by senior All-American Andy Miller, who helped guide the Cougars to eight tournament wins. The women's team finished second in the conference and 39th in the national polls. They were led by MWC Co-Player of the Year, sophomore Carrie Summerhays.\n\nWomen's & Men's Track\n\nThis year's track and field teams produced two more BYU national champions in senior Susan Taylor and sophomore Tara Rohatinsky. Taylor surprised many when she won the 1,500-meter race this spring at the NCAA Championships. She ran in the middle of the pack for most of the race, but passed everyone in her kick to the finish line. Rohatinsky, a cross country and track All-American, won the 10,000-meter race, helping the Cougars to a fourth-place national finish in outdoor track and a sixth-place finish in indoor track. The conference title was the women's 13th consecutive outdoor title and sixth consecutive indoor title. The men also won both the indoor and outdoor track conference titles, finishing 27th nationally in outdoor track and 34th in indoor track. All-American Jim Roberts moved up to second place on the BYU all-time list in the shot put.\n\nMen's & Women's Tennis\n\nSophomore Gert Vilms and senior Damien Ward finished 19th nationally in men's tennis doubles as they helped the men's team to a third-place conference finish and No. 66 national finish. In women's tennis, Eline Chiew led the team to a 11-9 record as Chiew went on to a 97th place finish in women's singles. The Cougars placed second in the Mountain West Conference.\n\nSoftball\n\nOn February 4th, 2000, the BYU women's softball team recorded its first victory ever, beating Sacramento State, 3-2, in the San Jose Early Bird Invitational. In the first season of women's softball at BYU, the Cougars went 7-13. After splitting a double-header with conference leader Utah to end the regular season, BYU finished its inaugural season after a close loss to UNLV in the MWC tournament.\n\nBaseball\n\nWith a new stadium under construction and a new coach in Vance Law, the BYU baseball team has a bright future. Highlights of the season included Law's first collegiate victories coming in a two-game sweep at No. 19 Arizona, the Cougars upset at No. 2 Alabama and the groundbreaking for BYU's new Miller Park, which began in May. The team ended the season at an even 29-29, finishing third in the conference. Matt Carson, the MWC Freshman of the Year, had a .449 conference-leading batting average in league play. Jeff Stone won a conference-high 10 games to enhance his career record to 21-6. BYU's .327 batting average ranked among the top teams in the nation and Cougar senior Craig Peterson and junior Aaron Whitley were ranked at one time in the NCAA leaders in batting average and triples, respectively.\n\nSears Cup Finish: 18th\n\nConf Finish\n\nTeam Ssn/Trn.
