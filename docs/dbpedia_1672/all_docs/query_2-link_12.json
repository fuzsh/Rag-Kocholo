        "text": "SAN DIEGO -- San Diego State opens its 24th season of Mountain West baseball competition this weekend when it travels to the Central Valley for a three-game series with Fresno State, March 1-3, at Pete Beiden Field at Bob Bennett Stadium in Fresno, California.\n\nFriday's opener is scheduled to begin at 6:05 p.m. PT, while Saturday's clash is slated to get underway at 3:05 p.m., followed by Sunday's finale at 1:05 p.m.\n\nIn addition to live stats, all three games will air live on the Mountain West Network, with links to both platforms available on GoAztecs.com. Fans can also catch the action on their TVs or smartphones by downloading the MW app.\n\nThe Aztecs will launch their MW schedule against the Bulldogs for the first time since 2021 and the fourth occasion since Fresno State joined the conference prior to the 2012-13 academic year.\n\nThe teams played one series during the 2023 campaign, with San Diego State dropping two of three games in Fresno. After claiming a 4-3 victory in 10 innings in the opener, the Aztecs were upended by the Bulldogs in the final two encounters by scores of 4-0 and 5-4.\n\nIn addition, SDSU will be looking to avenge a 4-2 season-ending loss to Fresno State at the 2023 Mountain West Championship, which was also contested on the Bulldogs' home diamond.\n\nSETTING THE SCENE\n\n> San Diego State will be looking to put the brakes on a two-game losing streak after falling to Utah, 11-5, in the finale of the Tony Gwynn Legacy on Feb. 25, before dropping a wild 13-9 decision at UC Riverside in a midweek contest two days later.\n\n> The Aztecs were undone by the big inning in both defeats, surrendering five runs to the Utes in the top of the seventh of that latter contest, which broke a 5-5 tie. On Tuesday, SDSU nursed a 3-2 lead at UCR, but the Highlanders erupted for seven runs in the bottom of the second to vault in front, 9-3, and the Scarlet and Black was unable to regain the upper hand for the remainder of the night.\n\n> The Aztecs have been riding the hot bat of third baseman Colby Turner, who leads team regulars in batting average (.406), on-base percentage (.444), hits (13), total bases (21) and triples (3) while ranking second in slugging percentage (.656) and RBIs (9).\n\n> Turner was named Mountain West Freshman of the Week on Feb. 26 after batting .467 with a .529 on-base percentage, seven RBIs and four runs scored in four games between Feb. 21-25. The Huntington Beach native becomes the second straight Aztec player to win the award after Jake Jackson received the same distinction on Feb. 19.\n\n> Entering the weekend, Turner leads the Mountain West in triples (3), which is tied for top spot in the country, while ranking second in the conference in hits (13), fourth in batting average (.406), fourth in RBIs (9 - tied) and seventh in slugging percentage (.656).\n\n> As a team, Aztec pitchers lead the MW in opposing batting average (.204) and strikeouts (95) while occupying the fourth spot in ERA (4.44). SDSU also tops the conference in strikeouts per nine innings (11.4) and hits allowed per nine innings (6.60), which rank 17th and 18 in the nation as of Feb. 29, respectively.\n\nFOR OPENERS (MW EDITION)\n\n> Since the first year of Mountain West baseball action in 2000, San Diego State has compiled a 15-8 record in conference openers, including an 11-3 mark at home.\n\n> During that span, San Diego State has captured 16 opening series against league opponentsâ€”17 if one includes a four-team round-robin event in 2006 when the Aztecs went 3-1.\n\n> SDSU has faced Fresno State in a conference opener on three previous occasions in 2013, 2016 and 2021. The teams met in Fresno for that MW lid-lifter in 2013 before locking horns in San Diego for the 2016 and 2021 league openers.\n\n> In that two-day set to open the 2021 Mountain West schedule, the Aztecs forged a doubleheader split, countering a 3-2 setback with a huge 17-0 run-rule shutout, before securing the series victory with a 15-7 triumph in the rubber game.\n\nAZTEC WEEKEND ROTATION\n\n> For the third straight weekend, San Diego State is expected to utilize the starting rotation of Chris Canada, Omar Serrano and Xavier Cardenas III.\n\n> Chris Canada (0-0) is slated to take the mound for the Aztecs on Friday. The Aztec junior has yet to post a decision in two previous starts this season, compiling a 7.94 ERA with eight walks and 10 strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings of work. In his last outing against Missouri at the Tony Gwynn Legacy, Canada was tagged for three runs on one hit, three walks and a hit batter before exiting with one out in the third. The SDSU left-hander was selected to the 2024 preseason all-Mountain West team in a vote of the league's coaches on Feb. 8 after receiving the same recognition from Perfect Game the previous week. Canada finished second among MW leaders last season in fewest hits allowed (62) and tied for fifth in strikeouts (72), compiling a 3-5 record with a 5.69 ERA. In addition, he ranked eighth in the conference a year ago in opposing team batting average (.265). In 2023, Canada also posted five or more strikeouts in nine of 13 appearances while yielding two or fewer walks in eight games. The Orange, California, native tied his career high with nine strikeouts in back-to-back outings vs. Air Force and at New Mexico. In three career games vs. Fresno State, Canada has racked up a 1-1 record with a 5.93 ERA, countering 10 hits and seven walks with nine strikeouts in 13 2/3 innings.\n\n> Likewise, Omar Serrano (0-0) has not factored in the decision involving his first two starts of the 2024 campaign, posting a 4.15 ERA with seven strikeouts in 8 2/3 innings pitched. In his last appearance vs. CSU Bakersfield, the SDSU junior allowed two runs on four hits and three walks while striking out four batters in 5 1/3 innings. Serrano joined Canada on the 2024 preseason all-Mountain West team after leading the league last year with fewest hits (46) and runs allowed (34) while ranking second in opposing team batting average (.237). In 2023, he also finished third on the Aztecs with career highs in strikeouts (62) and innings pitched (53.0), logging a 1-5 record with a 5.43 ERA and one save. A 6-4 right-hander, Serrano yielded two walks or less in 13 of 16 games and struck out six or more batters four times. The Downey, California, product set a career high with nine strikeouts in the series finale at Fresno State on April 16, 2023, but was lifted with the score tied at 3-3 with one out in the sixth inning. Serrano came through in the clutch late last year, notching his first career victory after helping the Scarlet and Black clinch a share of the Mountain West championship with a huge performance in the regular-season finale vs. New Mexico when he recorded eight strikeouts against one hit and two walks in 6.1 scoreless innings of relief, as the Aztecs rallied for an 8-6 triumph. For his efforts, Serrano earned a spot on Collegiate Baseball Newspaper's National Players of the Week list.\n\n> Meanwhile, Xavier Cardenas III (1-0) is once again slated to get the call in the series finale on Sunday. Entering the weekend, the sophomore right-hander leads the Scarlet and Black with 10.0 innings pitched and ranks third on the squad in ERA (3.60) while occupying the sixth spot in strikeouts (9). Cardenas was victorious in his first start of the year against Portland on Feb. 18, scattering four hits and two walks while finishing with a trio of strikeouts in five scoreless innings. In his last game vs. Utah at the Tony Gwynn Legacy, the La Habra, California, native struck out six batters but allowed five runs (four earned) on two hits and four walks before exiting after five innings with the score tied. Cardenas earned Mountain West Preseason Pitcher of the Year honors from D1Baseball.com on Feb. 7. He appeared in 15 games with two starts during his rookie campaign in 2023, posting a 1-0 record with a 3.31 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 15.2 innings. Cardenas limited the opposition to a .200 batting average and yielded one walk or less in 12 games, fanning multiple batters on seven occasions. He tossed two scoreless innings in his first career start at UC San Diego on March 28, 2023, recording two strikeouts against one hit and one walk without a decision. Cardenas also started the series opener against New Mexico late in the year on May 18, 2023, striking out five batters in 2.2 innings before the Scarlet and Black rallied to win in dramatic fashion by a 5-3 count.\n\nSERIES RECORD VS. FRESNO STATE\n\n> The Aztecs, who have faced Fresno State more than any other team in school history, own an all-time record of 109-112 against the Bulldogs in a series dating back to 1939.\n\n> SDSU is 51-56 against Fresno State in San Diego, 51-53 in Fresno and 7-3 at neutral sites.\n\n> The Aztecs posted a 1-3 record vs. the Bulldogs last season, dropping two of three contests in the lone series between the two squads in Fresno, before suffering a 4-2 defeat in the first elimination game of the Mountain West Championship, which was also held at Fresno State's home park.\n\n> In that regular-season weekend series, SDSU fell short in the final two contests by scores of 4-0 and 5-4 after winning the opener in 10 innings by a 4-3 count.\n\n> Among Aztec returners, shortstop Xavier Gonzalez led the Scarlet and Black with a .357 batting average (5-14) in four games against the Bulldogs last season, contributing one home run, one double, two RBIs and a run scored. In addition, Shaun Montoya hit .286 (4-14) with two doubles and a pair of walks.\n\nFRESNO STATE AT A GLANCE\n\n> The Bulldogs, who were picked to finish second in the Mountain West preseason coaches poll, are off to a 5-2 start this year after winning two of three games in a road series at Cal State Fullerton, Feb. 23-25. Fresno State sandwiched an 8-0 shutout and a 2-1 nail-biter around a narrow 5-4 defeat vs. the Titans in Orange County.\n\n> Previously, the Bulldogs swept a season-opening series at home from Milwaukee by scores of 7-3, 9-3 and 2-0 before dropping a 8-6 decision at Sacramento State on Feb. 21.\n\n> Prior to the 2023 campaign, pitcher Jake Dixon, infielder Murf Gray and utility player Tommy Hopfe were named to the preseason all-Mountain West team.\n\n> Entering the series, outfielder Grady Morgan has posted a slash line of .406/.533/.906, leading the conference in total bases (24) and slugging percentage (.906) while tying for the top spot in home runs (3) and the ninth position in RBIs (8).\n\n> Morgan and infielder Eddie Saldivar (.367) share the team lead with 11 hits apiece, which is tied for seventh in the Mountain West, while the latter is tied for fourth in the league in runs scored (8).\n\n> In addition, Hopfe has compiled his own slash line of .360/.500/.600, tying for third in the MW this week in on-base percentage.\n\n> Although Fresno State's pitching rotation has not been confirmed at press time, the trio of Dixon, Noah Beal and Jack Anker have made two starts apiece this season.\n\n> Dixon owns a 1-0 record with a 0.75 ERA and 15 strikeouts in 12.0 innings of work. The Bulldog left-hander finds himself among the conference leaders this week, ranking second in strikeouts and fourth in ERA while sharing the fourth spot for innings pitched. Dixon picked up his first victory of the season in his last start at Cal State Fullerton, scattering six hits and four walks with seven strikeouts in seven scoreless innings.\n\n> Despite an 0-1 mark and a 4.09 ERA, Beal is tied for third in the Mountain West with 13 strikeouts, sharing the spot with teammate Anker. The UNLV transfer absorbed the loss in his last start at Fullerton, where he yielded five runs (three earned) on five hits and two walks while fanning four hitters in five innings.\n\n> Meanwhile, fellow right-hander Anker is off to a hot start, posting a 2-0 ledger with a 0.69 ERA and 13 strikeouts. The Fresno State sophomore ranks third in the conference this week in ERA and opposing batting average (.178) while tying for third in strikeouts. Anker combined on a shutout in the Bulldogs' 2-0 triumph over Milwaukee on Feb. 18, offsetting five hits with five strikeouts in six innings. He followed that effort with eight additional strikeouts at Fullerton on Feb. 25, yielding just one run on three hits and a walk in seven innings, as Fresno State held on for a 2-1 victory.\n\n> Elsewhere, reliever Jake Riding (1-0) has pitched seven innings without giving up a run in three appearances this year, tying for the top spot in the Mountain West with an unblemished ERA (0.00) to go with six strikeouts. He was credited with the victory in Fresno State's 9-3 win over Milwaukee in the second game of the season on Feb. 17.\n\n> Additionally, Hopfe has two saves out of the bullpen, preserving Bulldog victories over Milwaukee (Feb. 18) and Cal State Fullerton (Feb. 25).\n\n> As a staff, Fresno State pitchers lead the Mountain West with a 2.36 team ERA, which ranks seventh in the nation as of Feb. 29, while their 66 strikeouts and .237 opponent batting average are good for third in the conference.\n\n> Conversely, the Bulldogs occupy the fifth spot in the league this week with a .258 team batting average while ranking sixth in hits (59), runs scored (38) and RBIs (32).\n\n> Ryan Overland enters his second year in charge of the Fresno State program after serving as the team's interim head coach during the 2023 campaign following the retirement of Mike Batesole. Last season, Overland guided the Bulldogs to a 30-27 overall record, marking the squad's first 30-win ledger since 2019.\n\nSDSU IN MW RANKINGS\n\n> Through seven games, Aztec freshman extraordinaire Colby Turner finds himself among the conference leaders in several statistical categories, ranking second in hits (13) and fourth in batting average (.406) and total bases (21), while sharing the fourth position in RBIs (9). He is also slotted seventh this week in slugging percentage (.656).\n\n> In addition, the SDSU third baseman has smacked a league-leading three triples, which is tied for the top spot in the nation as well.\n\n> Designated hitter Jacob McCombs shares the second position in the league with 11 RBIs, bolstered by grand slams vs. CSUN and CSU Bakersfield.\n\n> After three appearances, relief pitcher Issac Araiza is also listed among the MW leaders in fewest hits allowed (T-3rd, 6), strikeouts (T-5th, 12) and ERA (9th, 2.25).
