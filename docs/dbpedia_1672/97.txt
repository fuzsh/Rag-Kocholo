San Diego State won the inaugural Mountain West Baseball Tournament in 2000.

The postgame celebration was an empty one for the Aztecs.

The NCAA did not give automatic postseason berths to a tournament champion in a conference’s first year of its existence.

The tournament champion has received a postseason bid ever since, and SDSU has taken full advantage of it.

The Aztecs won the Mountain West Tournament championship for the fifth time in six years Saturday night in demonstrative fashion, beating UNLV 14-5 at Tony Gwynn Stadium. It is more tournament titles than any school in the nation during that span.

It was SDSU’s first title on its home field since a WAC championship in 1986. Those on the field and in the stands likely weren’t aware of this piece of Aztecs history. They didn’t need to be to savor the moment.

A boisterous crowd of 1,203 clapped, chanted and cheered as SDSU’s offense broke open a close game with 12 runs over four of its next five at-bats. That’s twice as many runs as the Aztecs had scored in 2-1 and 4-3 wins in the tournament’s first two days.

Fittingly, SDSU senior lefthander Jacob Erickson was on the mound at the finish. Erickson made the team as a walk-on four years ago. This season he became SDSU’s career leader in pitching appearances. Erickson — making his 119th appearance — pitched the final 3 2/3 innings, watching first baseman Jordan Verdon glove a bouncing ball and step on the bag for the last out to set off a celebration.

When he saw the ball headed his way, Verdon tried to play it cool. The same way the Aztecs do at tournament time.

“We just know that if we’re going to play in a regional, it’s all about the tournament,” Verdon said. “Just leave no questions about it. Win it and you’re in. That’s what you practice for and play for all year, these moments.”

SDSU pitching coach Sam Peraza told Erickson on Friday that if the Aztecs had the lead in the championship, Erickson would be on the mound in the ninth inning.

“I couldn’t hold my emotions,” Erickson said. “I knew it was my last time pitching at Tony Gwynn Stadium, and this is exactly how I dreamed it would happen. There’s nothing better than that to cap off my career.”

SDSU hasn’t won a regular season championship since 2004. So how is it the Aztecs have become Monsters of the Mountain West come tournament time?

“San Diego State’s never been to the College World Series, so you have to find something to latch onto, and right now that’s what we’ve latched onto,” SDSU coach Mark Martinez said. “It’s the process of building a culture here of expectation and standard. It’s still a work in progress. …

“Once we started winning some games in the tournament it became part of our culture. It’s been a long time in the works. It’s a process. It doesn’t happen overnight. You’re not going to catch lightning in a bottle.”

This was the first time since that 2000 title that the Aztecs went through the tournament undefeated.

SDSU catcher Dean Nevarez staked the Aztecs to an early 2-0 lead when he turned on a 1-2 pitch from UNLV right-hander Paul Richy for a two-run homer to left field.

That looked like plenty of runs for SDSU right-hander Jorge Fernandez, who buzzed through the first three innings by allowing just one hit.

Trouble found Fernandez in the fourth, however, when he allowed three straight hits to open the inning. Nick Rodriguez’s double got one of the runs back for UNLV. Nick Ames’ sacrifice fly scored another to tie it.

The Aztecs nearly got out of the inning with a double-play, but Verdon couldn’t glove a low throw from third baseman Casey Schmitt for the third out.

Rebels DH Jack-Thomas Wold made SDSU pay for it moments later with a two-run double that gave UNLV a 4-2 lead.

SDSU answered with four runs in the bottom of the fourth — two on a double off the left-field wall by Schmitt, the tournament MVP, and two more when Matt Rudick shot a ball through the legs of UNLV third baseman Dillon Johnson for a two-out error — for a 6-4 lead.

“Luckily, our pitching stepped up and shut the door,” Nevarez said. “They put them away. It was a tough game the first couple innings, but then we took off. Coach always tells us, ‘When you have them by the throat, step on them.’ That’s what we did.”

UNLV got a run back in the seventh, but again SDSU responded in the bottom of the inning. Five-fold. The Aztecs jumped out to an 11-5 advantage with run-scoring singles by Matt Rudick, David Hensley and Verdon doing most of the damage.

UNLV had advanced to the championship game with a 9-2 victory over San Jose State earlier in the day.
