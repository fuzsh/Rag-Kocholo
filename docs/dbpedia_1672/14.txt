Box Score

LAS VEGAS - A seven-run, nine-hit third inning was the difference as San Diego State captured the very first Mountain West Conference Baseball Championship with a 9-4 victory over Air Force at Earl E. Wilson Stadium on Saturday.

The Aztecs (34-28) scored in only two innings of Saturday's game, but exploded in the third after falling behind 2-0. SDSU collected five straight hits to begin the inning and had taken a 4-2 lead before the first out was recorded. Paul Lockhart then slammed his 11th home run of the year, a two-run shot which put SDSU up 6-2.

With a 7-2 edge, Aztec starter Rory Shortell cruised. He completed eight innings, scattering nine hits and giving up just two earned runs to improve to 6-6 on the year. Air Force starter Matt Kaercher gave up six of the seven runs in the third and suffered the loss, going 6-10 on the year.

Matt Ricardy went 5-for-5 on the day, driving in two runs and making countless plays on defense to lead the Aztecs' title run. San Diego State captured its first conference title since 1991 with today's win and its fourth overall.
