        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nI was surfing through Quora and stumbled upon a pretty interesting topic; which bands have someone other than the lead vocalist as their biggest star?\n\nThe original source listed Van Halen and Santana as examples. For Van Halen, its namesake Eddie Van Helen is listed as a top 5 guitarist, while David Lee Roth was just, well, there despite being a good vocalist. For Santana, although literally nobody knows who was its lead singer was or is, everyone knows who Carlos Santana is.\n\nAnother good example is Blink-182. While the band has had three different vocalists, I've always saw drummer Travis Barker as its most famous member.\n\nAre there any more examples of this?\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nIt's fairly subjective I guess - I think there's an argument that both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar are more recognizable than Eddie, which could be interpreted as being more famous. They both had successful solo careers which I think only strengthens this argument.\n\nThere's also Motley Crue - with Tommy potentially being more famous to some than Vince. But again, totally debatable.\n\nSlash from Guns N Roses is a stretch, although he kept his name out there longer than Axl did, at least in terms of making music after their initial breakup. He also had some high profile features. But it's still hard to argue anyone being more famous than Axl, really.\n\nPost by mkarns on\n\n@mello said:\n\nIt's fairly subjective I guess - I think there's an argument that both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar are more recognizable than Eddie, which could be interpreted as being more famous.

He also had some high profile features. But it's still hard to argue anyone being more famous than Axl, really.\n\nRe Motley Crue, I always thought that Nikki Sixx was at least as well known or prominent as Vince Neil. Later on Tommy Lee as well, though not entirely for musical reasons.\n\nThe G'n'R analogy got me thinking of Nirvana. It's hard to think of many musicians being much more famous than Kurt Cobain, but Dave Grohl has of course gone onto great things since. I wonder if Dave is now almost as well known to those not old enough to remember Nirvana firsthand?\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\n@mello said:\n\nIt's fairly subjective I guess - I think there's an argument that both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar are more recognizable than Eddie, which could be interpreted as being more famous.

I wonder if Dave is now almost as well known to those not old enough to remember Nirvana firsthand?\n\nGood point about Kurt/Dave. But, like Axl, Kurt is this iconic legend to so many, he's practically immortal. So Foo Fighters could have gone on to be the most successful band ever, and I still feel like Kurt would be more famous than Dave.\n\nThen there's the difference between famous and infamous. Tommy Lee is probably good example of this. haha.\n\nPost by Gekkouga on\n\nJane's Addiction - Dave Navarro (guitarist) is far more famous than Perry Farrell (lead vocalist)\n\nI'd put him in the same bucket as Tommy Lee of people who are more famous but not because of the music. I dont think he would have been nearly as famous if not for his connection to Carmen Electra\n\nProbably, but he also was known for his work with RHCP and other artists (Janet, Alanis, Xtina, etc) Sorta like Slash. Being famous for celebrity gossip/tabloids does not take away credit from them."
