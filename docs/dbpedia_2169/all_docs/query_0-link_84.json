        "text": "11 Jan 2011\n\nKyla La Grange\n\nWalk Through Walls\n\nunsigned/ NOIR\n\nWE SAY\n\nKyla La Grange's double-A debut single Walk Through Walls/ Courage comes out on Noir, the label offshoot from Coco Sumner's club night at Notting Hill Arts Club. This track has racked up over 1600 plays on SoundCloud in the first day of going up, and has gathered some positive blog reviews, including this one from the award-winning My Band's Better Than Your Band. She has already worked in the studio with Rollo Armstrong (Faithless) and the people from Communion Music, but both sides of the single were produced by newcomer Brett Shaw. Live, she has had some high-profile support slots with I Blame Coco which has set her up nicely for her forthcoming UK shows with a full band and a slot at SXSW in March. What a debut this is - a bewitching vocal turn in a track which builds towards a killer hook, delivered with gusto in the chorus.\n\nLondon gig: February 8, Bull & Gate NW5\n\nCONTACTS\n\nManagement: JP Duncan, Field/ATC Management - +44 (0)7900 916 632\n\nPress: Jon Lawrence, Stoked PR, +44 (0)20 7841 7085\n\nOnline: Matt Brown, Stay Loose - +44 (0)7939 527 656"
