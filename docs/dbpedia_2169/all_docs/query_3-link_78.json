        "text": "🎵 Have you ever heard this track before? 🎵 Probably not. Because @dundumusik creates music individually for the DUNDU shows. That’s why the music played at our performances isn’t just music, not just a background noise, it’s part of the show. Played by skilled musicians even on exotic instruments like the Kora … So – whether you are part of the audience or the event organizers crowd, every DUNDU show you watch is some kind of synthesis of the arts. A visual, auditive, emotional experience invented to connect with each and every person present. Let’s get on the magical journey of motion, light and sound and give your audience something truly special. Maybe even an opportunity to remember the special DUNDU tunes and to being able to hum or whistle on their way home, actually … 👉 Would like to get more information on this special kind of event performance for your business? Just DM us. #Dundu #lightshow #showact #giantpuppets #EventMagic #illuminateyourevent #creativespectacle #ShineTogether #lightupthenight #eventplanning #creativeeventideas\n\nYesterday on my Instagram story, I made a comment on the benefits and value of collaboration between artists at any career level and how it can be a means of showcasing their own individuality, adaptability and can further help audiences conceptualize an artist and what they have to offer. collaborations such as Robert Plant & Alison Krauss' 2007 album 'Raising Sand' goes to worlds and beyond to prove that when you combine very different things oftentimes the result is surprisingly wonderful, and achieved both critical acclaim and won several grammys. 'Two' an album featuring experimental bluegrass banjoist Bela Fleck and the Late Jazz fusion pioneer pianist Chick Corea is an exploration of this unlikely pairing and how this arrangement can open up whole new ideas while both artists describe it as \"having fun, with audiences and with each other\" Though it could be said based on this that the advantage of this level of collaboration and crossover is more beneficial to later career artists or those with established catalogues of their own music, I would argue that an audience who is interested in the development of independent music and independent artists would appreciate the attention to detail, the adaptability, the limited-edition easter-egg-ness of it all. Furthermore, in the next couple of hours Bricknasty will kick off the first of two Choice Cuts billed 'Nasty sessions' in the Sugar club which features the band playing with other heavy hitters Maverick Sabre, Kojaque, Aby Coulibaly and Shiv, a show which the Goo report \"sold out in mere minutes\". The fact that it also turns collaboration between independent Irish artists into an all-you-can-eat easter-egg buffet probably isn't lost on ticket holders. #irishmusic #independentartist #independentmusic #dublinevents\n\n🎵🔥 Music is not just about money! 🙌🏽🎶 In a recent interview, talented musician Rema, also known as Divine Ikubor, revealed that his motivation for creating music goes beyond financial gain. 🎤💰 While the 21-year-old artist has achieved financial security through his freestyles and social media posts, he emphasized that his record company discovered him. During the interview, Rema expressed his relentless dedication to earning a living, even if he hadn't succeeded in the music industry. He shared, \"If music didn't work, I would still be hustling and pushing myself in other ways.\" It's inspiring to see Rema's commitment to his craft and his passion for music, regardless of financial considerations. 🎶💪🏽 To read more about Rema's perspective on the importance of music beyond money, click the link below: [Read full blog post here](https://ift.tt/BSoyUf7) #musicindustry #inspiration #divineikubor\n\nCalii Concert Poster Translation reads from left, right, and then bottom center: “Unbelievable, A Must See, Don’t Miss, and Nirvana” Calii (pictured center) is considered the first wildly famous music artist in the Endless Lands. Having made their start in their traveling performing clan of fireflies, Calii would quickly learn to pick up on the types of music and instruments played throughout The Endless Lands in their travels. Written records of their debut performance in passing 10083 managed to combine nearly all musical styles far and wide in part thanks to their tritar (adapted center). A icon to Calii’s clan and skill. Whose music has had major impacts and adaptations to this day. They also claimed their dream was to see “the sky sea.” A rumored world or place that only handfuls of bugs have managed to return from. It’s unclear if Calii ever fulfilled that dream. *Note: Still finding supporting evidence about her song, “The Wave of Way of Silence” is clearly better than, “March Will Come.” I mean what the heck is a March anyway? Like what those ants do? **Note: Ruben, stop leaving so many notes on the exhibit labels. It’s becoming a problem. Also, March clearly represents the meaning to move on. That’s another reason it’s her best. ***Note: From Exhibit Director: Both of you need to stop and find a way to erase these notes. Anyway, you’re both wrong. It’s Calii’s early work where she was really getting a hold of her sound. #PINCERVERE #worldbuilding #art #bugs #digitalart #webcomics #comics #comic #comicart #comicartists #indiecomic #indiecomics #indiecomicsart #indiecomicartists #drawing #draw #poster #posterdesign #posterart\n\nBoarding Pass #3 Music Room Access. So far 3 passes have been shown. Dark Space Depot Boarding Pass #1 Space-themed room Student Art Society Boarding Pass #2 Art museum room Encrypted Scrolls Boarding Pass #3 Music room (featuring special musical performances and guests) This event features 5 rooms. When you get a boarding pass to the event, you have to choose which room you would like access to. While at the event, you can transfer your access to another room, but you can only do this once. So you'll get to see only 2 of the 5 rooms. To help you decide if going to another room is something you want to do, there is an outer lobby where you can hang out in and chat with others about their observations of other rooms. When you leave the room to access the lobby, there is a 1 hour respawn delay before you can re-enter the same room. However, if you choose to switch access, there is no respawn delay. There are 2 more rooms to announce and many more details regarding sponsors, featured technology, featured guests, and how to get access to the in-person event. #BoardingPass\n\nAs an independent artist, you may not have a huge financial backing to draw a large following around your music. This means your only option is to fully invest in feeding and engaging with your small fan base. So what's the advantage? You are more likely to have dedicated, die-hard fans because you focus on feeding your fans and forming a deeper connection with them. The bond and chemistry between you and your fans will be exceptional. So, let the signed artists focus on numbers, and instead, concentrate on building connections with your fans. That's your advantage!"
