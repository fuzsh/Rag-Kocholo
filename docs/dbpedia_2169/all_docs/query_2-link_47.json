        "text": "Since Paul Revere and the Raiders and the Kingsmen each laid down \"Louie Louie\" on a historic week in April 1963, Portland and Oregon musicians have been making an impact on the world. Portland alone is an indie-rock mecca, the west coast's temple of the blues, a bastion of folk and roots, a hide-out for electronic producers, one of America's hottest metal scenes and a growing hub for hip-hop: whatever your taste, someone out here is making it.\n\nThough there are many ways to trace Oregon's musical history, we wanted to see who came out on top. So we turned to Facebook, the world's biggest social network, to see how our bands ranked.\n\nFor this countdown, we selected from groups and artists based in Oregon or who spent crucial periods here, such as Robert Cray, a former Oregonian—like Everclear's Art Alexakis—who now lives in Southern California. We skipped a handful of bands with a single Oregon musician, such as Kiss (Tommy Thayer) and Rage Against the Machine (Brad Wilk) Most of these musicians still live and work here: look around and you might see one catching the show next to you at the Moda Center or Bunk Bar.\n\nSome crucial bands, like the Kingsmen themselves or '80s soul-funk outfit Pleasure, don't have Facebook pages, while other acts you might expect may have just missed the cut. No matter your taste in music, this list will include bands you love and many you've never heard of: it spans from the 1960s to 2016, from blues to metal, from globe-trotting classical to electronic remixes. None of these bands are close to the sky-high following of superstars such as Justin Bieber (now at 76 million Facebook likes), since after all, the Oregon music scene's always been a bit of a secret. Isn't it better that way?\n\nFacebook doesn't keep music charts, so feel free to let us know who we missed before some band sends a hundred thousand angry followers in our direction.\n\n-- David Greenwald\n\ndgreenwald@oregonian.com\n\n503-294-7625; @davidegreenwald\n\nInstagram: Oregonianmusic\n\n25. RAC\n\n103,000+ Facebook likes\n\nIf you've heard a good remix in the last decade, chances are it came from RAC's computer. The project of Portland's André Anjos has the likes of U2, Lana Del Rey and Katy Perry on its resume, as well as his own original material.\n\n24. Paul Revere and the Raiders\n\n114,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe Raiders' leader, who died in 2014, made music history when his Oregon band was the first rock act to sign to Columbia Records. The group went on to hits such as \"Kicks\" and \"Indian Reservation\" and continues today in Revere's memory.\n\n23. Blind Pilot\n\n113,000+ Facebook likes\n\nIt's been a while since we've heard a new album from the Astoria folk project, but a 2014 Pickathon performance reminded the region what we've been missing.\n\n22. Sleater-Kinney\n\n116,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThough Sleater-Kinney's highway-referencing name will forever be a tribute to the trio's Washington roots, Portland can claim some of the punk act's best years, and now that Corin, Carrie and Janet are back in action here, a bright and noisy future.\n\n21. Agalloch\n\n144,000+ Facebook likes\n\nAcross 21 years, the Portland group has become one of metal's best-reviewed bands anywhere, drawing notice from Decibel to NPR to Stereogum for its progressive sound.\n\n20. Chromatics\n\n144,000+ Facebook likes\n\nOne of the most acclaimed, influential independent acts of the last decade conjures up its synth-pop wizardry from mastermind Johnny Jewel's Portland studio, among his other home bases.\n\n19. The Dandy Warhols\n\n145,000+ Facebook likes\n\nWith \"Bohemian Like You,\" the Dandys made a Portland anthem. With \"We Used to Be Friends,\" they soundtracked TV's \"Veronica Mars.\" And with 2016's \"Distortland,\" the rock group's ninth studio album, they proved they're not done yet.\n\n18. Emancipator\n\n152,000+ Facebook likes\n\nDoug Appling's electronic project, which builds cocoons of lush, worldly instrumentation rather than thudding dance beats, will be spending this summer near the top of a number of festival lineups.\n\n17. Unknown Mortal Orchestra\n\n167,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe Prince-influenced project of Ruban Nielson made one of 2015's best albums with \"Multi-Love,\" its third full-length.\n\n16. STRFKR\n\n172,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThis is a family paper, so we can't say this band's name out loud. But we can certainly dance to the indie-pop group's ecstatic music.\n\n15. Chris Botti\n\n204,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe Portland-bred trumpeter has gone on to play with the likes of Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon and Sting as well as his solo success, which includes a Best Pop Instrumental Album Grammy for 2012's \"Impressions.\"\n\n14. Toxic Holocaust\n\n210,000+ Facebook likes\n\nIf the long-running metal band's album covers look familiar, it's because genre legend Ed Repka (Megadeth, Death) drew them.\n\n13. Red Fang\n\n217,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe most-liked representatives of Portland's mighty metal scene can riff with the heaviest of 'em and have a sense of humor, too.\n\n12. Robert Cray\n\n267,000+ Facebook likes\n\nOne of the foremost blues players of the '80s and beyond, Cray got his start in Eugene with Curtis Salgado, now a Portland solo artist.\n\n11. Everclear\n\n296,000+ Facebook likes\n\n\"Santa Monica.\" \"Father of Mine.\" Though Everclear didn't make many friends during its controversial Portland early days, the group became one of alternative rock's biggest hit-makers in the late '90s.\n\n10. Pink Martini\n\n299,000+ Facebook likes\n\nPortland's self-described \"little orchestra\" offers music without borders or eras, a melting-pot sound that has brought it to concert halls all over the world for two decades and counting.\n\n9. Portugal. The Man\n\n383,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe major label group that calls itself \"the lords of Portland\" is also a staunch community member, whether it's helping a local school or showing up for the Oregon Music Hall of Fame.\n\n8. Broken Bells\n\n399,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe Shins' James Mercer's other band blends his Portlandian melodies with the funky, psychedelic mind of producer Danger Mouse.\n\n7. Esperanza Spalding\n\n413,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe Portland jazz darling is proving her 2011 Best New Artist Grammy trophy was no fluke: new album \"Emily's D+Evolution\" is her most sprawling, ambitious release yet.\n\n6. The Gossip\n\n441,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe Portland dance-punks have called it quits (and folded their Facebook page into frontwoman Beth Ditto's), but \"Standing in the Way of Control\" remains a 2000s indie anthem.\n\n5. The Decemberists\n\n608,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe only Portland band with an eight-minute song about a whale, the wordy folk-rock act are both twee ambassadors and a must-see prog-rock force.\n\n4. She & Him\n\n709,000+ Facebook likes\n\nThe Him half of the retro duo, M. Ward, remains a local, and singer Zooey Deschanel's \"New Girl\" character, Jess, is totally from Portland.\n\n3. The Shins\n\n757,000+ Facebook likes\n\nMaybe they changed your life with \"Garden State,\" maybe you already owned \"Oh, Inverted World\" on vinyl. But we bet you didn't know that frontman James Mercer owns the Southeast Portland house Elliott Smith recorded \"Roman Candle\" in.\n\n2. Kutless\n\n1.259 million Facebook likes\n\nThe Christian rock act formed at Portland's Warner Pacific College in 1999 and have gone on to release nine successful studio albums, including 2015's \"Surrender.\"\n\n1. Modest Mouse\n\n1.865 million Facebook likes"
