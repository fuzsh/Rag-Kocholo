The celebrated East London festival is delighted to announce the new 'AMEX UNSIGNED.' stage across the weekends from Friday 16 August to Sunday 25 August. This year's line-up features a dynamic mix of emerging talents set to captivate the crowds with their unique sounds and electrifying performances.\n\nOn Friday 16 August, Amex Unsigned artists Harleighblu, as well as Bloody Civilian, Rian Brazil will take to the stage. Born and raised in Abuja, Nigeria, Bloody Civilian is a genre-defying singer, whose penchant for storytelling manifests in her authentic, unbridled, and poetic lyricism. A driving force of Bloody Civilian's work is to empower and platform African art: she hopes that her career will be marked by her distinct dedication to uplifting her African culture and heritage in every space she encounters.\n\nRian Brazil is a seasoned artist who has established himself in the hip hop and trap music scenes. His ability to expertly incorporate trap music components into his sound gives his songs an additional depth and complexity - thought-provoking and insightful, Rian Brazil's songs explore themes of love, struggle, and human development. Stirring in the underbelly of the bubbling UK Neo-Soul scene, and among the winners of Amex's Unsigned initiative designed to support up and coming artists, is Harleighblu, a captivating songstress paving her own lane with her distinctive sound and touching vocals. A mellow fusion of soul, hip hop and jazz, pulsating with unexpected eclectic flourishes, her impressive vocal flow and succinct storytelling, all make Harleighblu one of the most unique artists coming out of the Soul world right now.\n\nSaturday 17 August will see Tom Did It and another Amex Unsigned alumnus, Kianja, perform at All Points East, with more names to be revealed. Rapper, singer, and producer Tom Did It, began his journey as a DJ, before producing and then putting his own vocals to the music - a mix of UK rap, upbeat club-ready beats, and laid-back indie pop. After enjoying early success with the 2020 single 'Outside', in three short years he has worked with Nafe Smallz, Sigma, Chip, Sigala, and Steel Banglez. This eclectic array of artists shows his versatility and, as he spends time in the studio with global icons and joins his childhood heroes on stage, his self-determination proves to be his guiding light. Born in North-East London, Amex Unsigned artist Kianja was raised on a musical diet of Soul, Reggae and Jazz. Her debut EP, Glory, led to support across BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra, before she found herself singing alongside Craig David, Swarmz and S- X on Bastille's Other People's Heartache EP.

Riya almost feels like she is from a different era being an old soul living in a technology driven and forever advancing world which has led her to embody an alternative pop sound and style with conventionally classic undertones.\n\nThe following weekend, on Friday 23 August we have Attawalpa, Nick Ward and simon a. (Amex Unsigned artist.) Attawalpa a.k.a British Peruvian artist Luis Felber has put together a band of distinct and accomplished musicians formed to replicate his recorded sound and then surprise with a new alchemy. 2022 and 2023 saw Attawalpa sharing billings with Bruce Springsteen, Grace Jones, The Rolling Stones, Phoebe Bridgers and War on Drugs and many more.
