        "text": "Fame and fortune don’t guarantee job security, as many rock stars have discovered.\n\nThe list of famous musicians who have been fired from their bands features some of the biggest names in rock history. Ozzy Osbourne was kicked out of Black Sabbath when his drug use became too much to handle. The irony is that his ousting actually led Ozzy to a hugely successful solo career, something the Prince of Darkness alluded to when he was selected for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for a second time: \"Not bad for a guy who was fired from his last band.”\n\nThings didn't go so well for other musicians who were fired over drugs. Syd Barrett (Pink Floyd), Steven Adler (Guns N’ Roses) and Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots) all saw their careers -- and personal lives -- take serious downturns following their dismissals.\n\nOf course, it’s not just hard partying that can drive a wedge between bandmates. In many cases, the mix of egos, jealousy and “creative differences” brought famous musicians’ tenures to an end. Such was the case for Dennis DeYoung, whose Styx bandmates were no longer interested in grandiose rock operas, and Brian Jones, who clashed with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards over the Rolling Stones' direction.\n\nREAD MORE: Nastiest Rock Feuds\n\nFor other fired stars, the dismissal was much more personal. Lindsey Buckingham, who’d weathered decades of Fleetwood Mac’s drama, was dismissed in 2018 following – the final result of lingering tension from his complicated relationship with Stevie Nicks.\n\nThen there’s Sammy Hagar, who insists he was fired from Van Halen, while others have reported he quit to focus on solo material.\n\nThese stories and more are covered below in our list of 30 Famous Rockers Who Were Fired From Their Bands.\n\nRockers Who Were Fired From Their Bands"
