This is Hardcore boiled down to it’s purest, most raw form: Fast, pummeling, and pissed the hell off. Seriously, if you’re a fan of bands like Internal Affairs, Madball, Agnostic Front or just want to hear some damn good Old School Hardcore, check out A Breed Apart and be prepared to want to stave dive and circle pit all night long.\n\nPlus, any band that starts off their EP with a Taxi Driver sample is automatically my favorite band of all time. So excuse me while I replay “What We Do” for the millionth time tonight."
