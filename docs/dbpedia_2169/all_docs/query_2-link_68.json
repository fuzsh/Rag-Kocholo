        "text": "Why does an agency never show its prices on the website?\n\nHave you ever noticed booking agencies do not list pricing for the entertainers they represent? This is why we have created the most extensive list of entertainers with pricing on the internet.\n\nYES, We know that the list isn’t 100% accurate. We understand that some of this data is from almost a decade ago. Regardless, the list is yours for reference. Use it as a resource when preparing an offer for the entertainer of your choice.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nSome of the sources we referenced are many years old and may have paid inflated or deflated pricing depending on their market and who was buying or selling the act\n\nWe do not directly represent any of the artists listed on the price sheet\n\nSome of these prices reflect a flat deal structure\n\nGot a new artist price?\n\nFeel free to send it to us and we will update the list.\n\nTHIS LIST HAS OVER 1,900 ARTISTS & TOOK A DECADE TO CURATE\n\nWhy does it cost so much to hire a celebrity to perform at my event\n\nThe cost of having a celebrity, DJ, magician, band, or actor perform or appear at your event is subjective.\n\nThe talent agency knows that the client or venue wants to increase attendance or profit from selling tickets to their event. What they don’t know is how interested we are or how profitable the event will be.\n\nThis is why talent agencies require YOU to submit the initial offer. It is so they can gauge your interest, gather details, and leverage for the negotiation.\n\nMost agents don’t want their time wasted, so getting all the event details outlined ahead of time is more efficient for everyone, including the artist.\n\nDoes The Price Change?\n\nWhile we understand that these are only rough figures, the actual cost is negotiable and can be more dependent on other factors.\n\nThe price for each band will always go up or down depending on the timing of the market.\n\nA booking agency bases its prices on perceived value and the venue’s desire to hire an act.\n\nExample: We have seen two different properties in WA state pay two different prices in less than one year.\n\nJust south of the Canadian border a casino paid $22,000 for a certain act (which is a $12,500 act anywhere else in the US) and in that same year, they were hired at a different casino for just $15,000 less than a 100 miles away.\n\nWhat’s the bottom line? Always try to cross-reference pricing with other venues, talent buyers, and agents.\n\nNo matter what type of deal/offer you are pursuing, consulting with at least one other venue can only help.\n\nIt is important to remember that the artists will have an absolute bottom dollar amount that they are not willing to take less than.\n\nThe agent isn’t usually going to tell you that number, so if you don’t have an educated suggested starting point, you could get taken advantage of."
