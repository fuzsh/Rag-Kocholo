        "text": "Independent artists have more opportunities than ever before to launch their own career without the backing of the majors or a big budget.\n\nWhile we are seeing more and more unsigned artists breaking through off their own backs, many promising new artists out there simply donât know where to start or how to maintain a successful music marketing campaign and make money from music.\n\nâ\n\nHow to promote music in 2024\n\nâ\n\nIt should go without saying, but first and foremost, making great music needs to be your primary focus. You can follow all this advice to the letter, but if your track, EP or album isnât well-written, tight instrumentally and professionally produced, youâll fall at the first hurdle.\n\nNow thatâs out of the way, letâs look at the best ways to promote your music independently in the modern music landscape.\n\nYou can watch our Unsigned Advice video here!\n\nâ\n\nAnd remember to check out our complete guide to marketing music for a free downloadable e-book with everything you need to plan, organise and carry out a successful, independent music marketing campaign for your next big drop!\n\n1. Sign up to artists services\n\nMost of the biggest music streaming services have platforms built specifically for artists. So if you're releasing music, signing up is a no-brainer.\n\nThese services will allow you to access an array of features and benefits within the platform, that are exclusively reserved for artists using and releasing music on the platform.\n\nSo for example, signing up to Spotify for Artists allows you to add a profile image, submit music to Spotify playlists (more info on that below!), edit your Spotify artist bio, view streaming analytics and access Spotify's 'Artist's Pick'. Â\n\nBut it's not just Spotify that caters to artists needs. There's also Apple Music for Artists, Amazon Music for Artists, Deezer for Creators and YouTube for Artists - so if you haven't already, go sign up!\n\nâ\n\n2. Build a website & mailing list\n\nCreating a slick, professional website as a base for your online presence is vital, but perhaps even more important is building a large & dedicated mailing list.\n\nYour website should obviously include links to your music, bios, images and tour dates, but make sure to also include a mailing list sign up form. Email marketing offers direct access to the inboxes of people most likely to engage with your music.\n\nIf a fan gives you their email address, it means they want to hear from you, and a message direct to their inbox about your latest release or upcoming tour is much more likely to reach them than a social post that can be restricted by a platform's limited reach.â\n\nâ\n\n3. Develop an engaging social presence\n\nThe power of a good social media marketing strategy is no secret. Developing and maintaining a consistent, interesting and engaging presence across Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Facebook and even less obvious platforms like Snapchat, is essential. Also, try and keep your profile handles consistent to make things easier for people searching for you online.\n\nThereâs an insurmountable amount of advice out there on how to manage your social channels, and things are constantly changing across every platform. Look through some of these helpful resources for more info on how to run and make the most of your social media presence.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n4. Get playlisted\n\nYou canât afford to ignore streaming and playlisting. Playlists across Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and other platforms reach hundreds of millions of listeners across the globe, racking up billions of streams. Getting your track into a popular playlist can help you rack up thousands of streams. Thatâs not only great awareness but also Spotify royalty earnings in your pocket.\n\nWhile getting your music placed on curated playlists is great for awareness and credibility, being placed on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly can make a big difference to your stream count and music royalty payments. So it's worth persusing all possibilities.\n\n5. Get press & blog coverage\n\nIf your music gets featured by music publications, whether thatâs mainstream mags or niche blogs and webzines, those placements can help build hype and give you the credentials to take your music career up a level.\n\nHiring a professional PR executive to handle your campaign is generally the best way to get great coverage. But this isnât always affordable or possible for a new artist with a limited budget.\n\nDo-it-yourself PR is an option for artists without a big enough budget. But it's important to approach bloggers and journalists in the right way. Firstly, youâll need to create an electronic press release. This should contain all the essential info about you & your music. The resources below offer advice for musicians who want to take PR into their own hands.\n\nâ\n\n6. Music videos\n\nAn exciting, interesting and original music video has the potential to go viral online, even if the track isnât a hit.\n\nDonât be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to creating a video for your latest release. Think about the kind of videos from acts like OK GO and Childish Gambino that have blown up thanks to online traction. Theyâve had something unique and intriguing about them, whether that was a deeper underlying message or a quirky theme.\n\nYou might want to develop a standard music video or live performance-based visuals â which is perfectly fine. But investing thought, time and effort into your videos has the potential reap huge rewards.\n\nâ\n\n7. Surround yourself with a strong team\n\nYou might prefer the lone-wolf approach to promoting your music, but there can be huge benefits to surrounding yourself with a great team of like-minded people. If you have a team of well-connected individuals who are passionate about your music all working in your interest, it stands to reason that your chances of success will increase.\n\nIf you can put together a team of friends whoâll help you free of charge, or for a cut of eventual earnings â great! But sometimes, youâll need to acquire the services of professionals to help give you the edge in the competitive music market. Whether thatâs a PR person, a radio plugger or promoter/booker - there's nothing wrong with accepting help.\n\nItâs also a good idea to get yourself a great manager. Again, make sure theyâre passionate about your music and believe in you as an artist. A manager whoâll go above and beyond for you is worth their weight in gold.â\n\n8. Know your audience & focus on your niche\n\nWhere and to whom you market your music can make all the difference. Thriving music subcultures exist in all corners of the world, some huge and sprawling, some small and dedicated. Finding, knowing and exploiting your musical niche is key to your promotional campaign.\n\nIt might sound obvious (and it should be) but if youâre a metal band, play metal venues, join a metal community and win metal fans. If youâre a rapper, find rap venues, join rap communities and win rap fans. And so on.\n\nBut niches arenât always defined by genre. If your music has more widespread appeal, start locally. People generally want to see an artist from their area succeed. Take advantage of this mentality and grow your fanbase close to home to before expanding nationally or even globally.\n\nUtilising the different artists services features will allow you maximise your in-platform marketing and unlock new potential for engagement with your music from your fans and listeners!\n\n9. Play live often & make an impact\n\nObviously this is a bit more difficult in the post-Covid-19 era, but gigs and tours offer an invaluable way to connect with fans. Get booked at nearby venues, play awesome sets for local music fans and you'll quickly develop a strong, new fan base. But remember, you have to make them remember you, so be memorable.\n\nOnce youâve built up a local following, you can head out on the road, taking on new music scenes city by city or even country by country. If this sounds too easy & simplified â thatâs because it is. Touring and playing gigs night after night is hard work, but if youâve got a killer live show, the rewards will speak for themselves.\n\nWant some help promoting your next release? Let's talk.
