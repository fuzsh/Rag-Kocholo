        "text": "Like van Gogh, are you comforted by music?\n\nDoes music inspire you?\n\nDoes music change your mood, or make you more productive?\n\n(I always crank some upbeat music while doing the ironing; it becomes an enjoyable ‘music festival’ rather than an enduring chore.)\n\nMany famous artists have credited music as a muse for their work, while some musicians have revealed that art or an artist has been their inspiration.\n\nAmerican Pop Artist Keith Haring always had a ‘boom box’ playing rap music close by when he was painting a mural or creating art. He loved Run DMC and even designed a sneaker style for the band members to wear.\n\nPop Star Madonna wore outfits designed by Haring during her some of world tours and promotional events.\n\nFrench Post-Impressionist Matisse played the violin every day. He appreciated the discipline and focus that it required of him and felt that it helped his concentration for painting.\n\nSo too did Russian-French Cubist Marc Chagall. Music was so important to Chagall that the term was the theme of an impressive exhibition of his work at the Montreal Museum of Modern Art in 2017: Chagall: Colour and Music\n\nAs well as being inspired by music, van Gogh was the very muse for a touching folk song 81 years after his death. Vincent van Gogh’s love of painting and fragile life was the inspiration for Don McLean’s 1971 song Vincent.\n\nMcLean said he was inspired to write the song after reading a biography of van Gogh. The song is beautiful and sad and is so highly valued that even the original handwritten lyrics by McLean were put up at auction for 1.5 million dollars earlier this year.\n\nAmerican Modern artist Georgia O’Keeffe is well known for her large scale cropped flower paintings and cityscapes, but she too understood art had the ability to evoke emotion in the same fashion that music did.\n\nFor a time, O’Keeffe was occupied with ‘the idea that music could be translated into something for the eye.” This led to the creation of several abstract works inspired by music including: (left) Music, Pink and Blue No. 2 1918, and Blue and Green Music 1919-1921 (right).\n\nJapanese Pop Artist Yayoi Kusama was friends with Georgia O’Keeffe. When Kusama moved to New York, O’Keeffe introduced her to American art buyers to assist her friend’s profile and livelihood. Like O’Keeffe, Kusama has explored music by way of singing poems she has written which were later incorporated into her Life is The Heart of A Rainbow exhibition.\n\nFurthermore, Kusama’s art was the muse for musician Peter Gabriel’s 1993 video clip Love Town. Gabriel enlisted several visual artists to create original artworks for each of the 11 songs on his 1992 Us album, one of them being Kusama. Click on the link Love Town below to see the obvious Kusama influence in the video and the works of art she created for the album.\n\nAnd finally, we turn to Dutch painter Piet Mondrian who was known to take his love of music and dancing as seriously as he took his painting. When Mondrian lived in Paris, he became an adept ballroom dancer.\n\nAfter he fled Europe in the wake of World War II for the bustling city of New York, he was immediately captivated by the jazz music and the ‘boogie-woogie’ style of dancing that was popular at the time. He spent time at jazz clubs in Harlem with artistic ‘big wigs’ including Alexander Calder, Peggy Guggenheim, Lee Krasner, Nelly Van Doesburg, and Fernand Léger.\n\nMondrian translated the energy of the bustling New York City, the intensity of its night life, and the vigour of its beloved Boogie Woogie jazz into his paintings.\n\nMondrian’s last two works of art even included Boogie Woogie in their titles: Broadway Boogie Woogie, 1942-1943, and the unfinished Victory Boogie Woogie, 1942-1944.\n\nMany art critics and musicians have indicated that these two paintings are a visual form of music in that the grid lines denote rhythm (the beat that holds the music together), while the shape patterns represent the melody: the sequence of single notes of a tune."
