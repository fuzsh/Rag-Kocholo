        "text": "Hey all. Here's the skinny. My band is about to hit a really nice local studio to record some tracks and mix them into a full-fledged album; we are all really excited. After two years of playing together, this is obviously a big deal for us. But because of the gravity of this project, my family are really making a big deal about it. I mean, a BIG deal.\n\nSuch that a lot of them are saying that I need legal documentation, outside of liner note credits, that I wrote the songs that I did, and so on. Their argument is that if the band ever split up, I would want a document that maintained this list, so that certain songs would be \"mine\". As ludicrous as this sudden affront seems to me, at the same time, I can see that they may have a point, and certainly if my bandmates and I split and they ran off with some of my very favorite songs to stardom, it would really hurt. So what should I do?\n\nFrankly, I've always believed that all it took was a little parenthetical or similar in the liner notes, such as\n\nVia Volpes (J. Chandler)\n\nFool (A. R. Roberson)\n\n...and so on.\n\nAt the same time, there is another part of me that feels like it's selfish to think of this at all. Even if I wrote the lyrics and the basic structure of a song, I can't take credit, say, for the subtleties of the drum part or the particular way our singer interprets the melody. In that case, aren't all the songs all equally written by my band as a uniform entity? The only messy thing here is, again, if we break up, I'd hate for the music that I contributed to be hijacked without me.\n\nI don't know. This is obviously a sensitive subject... If you all have any advice, please share.\n\ncassius\n\np.s.: Anyone know if Folsom Prison Blues, by the Man in Black, is public domain yet? We have a VERY unique interpretation of this song as a cover, and we were debating about whether or not it should make the album. But this in itself, with copyright laws, is its own can of worms.\n\nThe songwriter owns rights to a song. To prove ownership, you need something dated that shows you wrote the song at a certain time.\n\nYou can go through the copyright process.\n\nYou can make a cassette, send it to yourself by registered mail and never open the envelope.\n\nThe arrangement is different than the song. A song is considered to be a melody and words. Chord changes are not copyrighted. The way the singer interprets the song or the drum part are not an issue related to who wrote the song. (unless the singer made changes to the words or drastic changes to the melody.)\n\nThe performance on your cd is also copyrighted, which means the rights to play that song on the radio are defined. That's different than the songs. Once your cd has been published, anyone who listens to it is allowed to play the songs. Another band could also record the songs without permission but there is a legislated amount of money that you have to be paid. They can't write new lyrics to song without expression permission.\n\nI am not a lawyer and I do not play one on TV.\n\nIf your recording is picked up by a major label company, you might as well consider your songs gone. They will insist on the publishing rights to your songs which is a good deal for them and a terrible one for you.\n\nI sincerely doubt that any Johnny Cash song is in the public domain. I think the time limit is the life of the composer plus 75 years.\n\nAs pointed out...only lyrics and melody pertain to any copyright law. Arrangements are not part of the deal...regardless the importance the subtleties of the drum part may invoke on the piece. Financial \"arrangements\" for the arrangements can be made with the players. And, as much as it may bruise the fragile egos of young musicians, their contributions to an arrangement are considered \"works for hire\", and not subject to royalties from song ownership.\n\nAnd, yes, it is quite possible to \"share\" ownership of copyright with all band members. This works fine until serious money gets involved. Tehn it often does not work at all.\n\nSo...to get down the heart of the matter....no matter how you feel, or your bandmates feel, about their \"art\", you are now making the step which crosses over into the realm of commerce. And, at the the end of the day, the business of music is business. So that no conflicts are brought to light at a later date, you all should draw up documents citing the authorship of any original tunes. These should also be filed for copyright by either \"standard\" of \"common law\" practices.\n\nFinancial divisons of the recording/production and marketing costs should also be drawn up, as should plans for any (if any) divison of profits. all of this can be a divison with rights deferring to the \"author\" of the piece, or as a group effort and each member with a share regardless of the contribution to any particualr song.\n\nAnd, when money gets involved you have to make contingencies for when a member decides to leave and the band must buy out his/her share or investment......\n\nAll of this is rather quite daunting, and intimidating. Yet, quite easy to deal with once all the members agree that their \"little band\" is a business (ok, so there is a requesite median level of maturity...), and that to make a successful business, one needs to run it like a business.\n\nfor some bands, esp. those without that requsite level of maturity, this can mark the begining of the end. Yet,. the problems which arise from this are problems which sooner or later would surface anyway...and 'tis better to get them out when life is simpler, as later things can get very messy (and expensive).\n\nIf you are serious about your tunes, your career, future, copyrights...the financial responsibilities of recording your own CD and such...it is never a bad idea to consult an attorney.\n\nAnd no, none of the Johnny Cash catalog is in the PD. Yet it is quite possible to gain permission to record that song by simply writing to holders of that copyright, or to his estate, expressing your desire to do so. Often in such cases any fees are waived 9esp. for low-budget, indie stuff).\n\nMax\n\nFirst off, cassius, nice fish in your avatar!\n\nYes, a song is lyrics and melody as far as the U.S. Copyright Office is concerned. This often puts the rhythm section at a disadvantage when writing songs \"as a band\", unless the drummer is also the lyricist, as Neil Peart is for Rush.\n\nIn my experience most songs written \"as a band\" start with a chord progression or a riff: not necessarily copyrightable material. But I'd be surprised if whomever wrote the bass line to \"My Sharona\" didn't get songwriting credit. And yes, I've read (rare) examples where drummers got songwriting credit for drum beats that became integral to a song.\n\nSo if I bring into a band an idea for a song that is just a drum beat, a bass riff, or a chord progression, is it still \"my song\" after others add lyrics and melody? [My answer: yes, because the song was built around my idea, but the others mentioned should also be credited. The courts may decide otherwise, though.]\n\nHow about if someone else brings in a (partial) song and I just arrange the bridge (no lyrics)? [My answer: technically, no, but the song would still be unfinished without the bridge, so yes.]\n\nWhat if my only input is to change one word of the lyrics (and it was adopted)? [My answer: technically, yes, since it's still in the songwriting stage and my change isn't considered a derivative work yet. That one word may be the difference between a hit and a flop! However, for a minor change I may not seek songwriting credit.]\n\nWhat if your band is brainstorming and bouncing ideas off of each other. Do these guys get credit: (a) Proposed several ideas but none are incorporated into the final? (b) Was merely present but did not contribute anything? [My answer: technically, both (a) and (b) were part of the songwriting process, so both earn songwriting credit. Certainly there is less of a case for (b) since he didn't do anything ... at least not materially. But he was invited in on the session as a songwriter and listened to everyone else. OTOH, (b) and perhaps (a) might feel inclined not to claim songwriting credit for this session. And no, I'm not advocating that someone not invited to the session but who was present and did not contribute should have any kind of claim.]\n\nPeople are usually not this generous in reality.\n\nIf you enter into a songwriting agreement with other songwriters -- even if one of them is a drummer that does not contribute lyrics nor melody -- write a song with them and do not credit them, you could offend them and they might walk. If you do not credit them and they have a defensible claim, you may see them in court. The bigger threat really is trashing your songwriting relationships. So if you can afford that, you can be more restrictive in assigning songwriting credit.\n\nLet's say you're writing a song as a group and you only have one verse so far. If the drummer kicks off a beat for the chorus that inspires a bass line that in turn inspires some chords and ultimately the lyrics and melody, wasn't that songwriting? But again, this would be nearly impossible to uphold in court.\n\nTo be absolutely sure the drummer is not contributing, you and the guitar player should only write songs together (or separately, but not when the drummer is around). Once they're finished bring them to band rehearsal and have the drummer arrange a \"hired gun\" drum part. To seal the deal, either pay your drummer a set fee for his session work or have him sign a document stating that he is providing this service free of charge. (This last part is definitely overkill; in most cases an oral agreement should suffice, at least until you are all megastars.)\n\nBut go ahead and read some books on songwriting and come to your own conclusions. You might find some at your local library or the bookstore. Even Songwriting for Dummies is a decent reference.\n\nHere's another scenario: If I write a complete lyric, melody and, say, a chord progression, and my band fills out the rest of the arrangement, do they get songwriting credit? [My answer: in nearly all cases this baby belongs to me 100%. I may consider something such as the addition of a musical hook that \"makes\" the song (others probably would not). Otherwise I'm going to act as the executive producer for the song and my bandmates will be \"hired guns\".]\n\nSo, although it's probably infinitely more rewarding to write songs as a group, a lot of musicians may prefer to only bring finished songs into a group so they can retain control and sole copyright.\n\nIn any event, you can choose to enter into an agreement with your bandmates however you wish. I believe all four band members --including the drummer -- were listed as songwriters on Led Zeppelin's first album. This seems to be the most equitable solution and the least to cause problems, unless for certain some songs were entirely written by only one band member, or a subset of band members before other members joined later, etc."
