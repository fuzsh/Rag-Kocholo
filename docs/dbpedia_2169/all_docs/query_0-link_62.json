She initially shared the co-President title with Azi Eftekhari, who has since departed from the business.\n\nNeaves’ elevation to sole President comes during a period of significant global success for UMR, with acclaimed projects featuring Amy Winehouse, Elton John, Florence & The Machine, The Rolling Stones, The Spice Girls, Sam Smith, Bob Marley, and The Beatles‘ “Now And Then” release.\n\nDavid Joseph praised Neaves, stating, “Hannah is, first and foremost, an artist person with an innate understanding of where creativity and discovery meet, something she has brought in abundance since re-joining our team. A truly exceptional and inspiring executive, Hannah has already had enormous success, most recently creatively leading the global and record-breaking ‘Now And Then’ campaign for The Beatles, and there’s so much more to come.”\n\nNeaves brings a wealth of experience from her 23-year career in the music industry. She began as an intern at EMI, later becoming the Head of Artist Development at Polydor. She served as Marketing Director at Atlantic Records, where she was instrumental in Ed Sheeran‘s record-breaking ÷ (Divide) album campaign. Transitioning to artist management, Neaves joined Tap Music as Head of Artist Development & Marketing, overseeing the album marketing and creative for Dua Lipa‘s Future Nostalgia.\n\nCommenting on her new position, Neaves said, “I am enormously proud of everything the brilliant and successful team at UMR has already achieved and feel privileged to be continuing the great work with the best artists in the world.”\n\nPOSITION MUSIC INKS KHALID “KHAL” YASSEIN\n\nTO GLOBAL PUBLISHING DEAL\n\nTyler Bacon, President & CEO, Position Music recently announced that RIAA Platinum-selling artist and songwriter Khalid “Khal” Yassein has signed a worldwide publishing deal with Position Music.\n\nYassein, known as the lead writer and male vocalist of the indie folk band Wild Rivers, has collaborated with artists including Sasha Sloan, venbee, Oh Wonder, Morgan Evans, The Fray, Matt Hansen, Maddie Zahm, and others.

The band’s breakout single, “Thinking ‘Bout Love,” achieved Gold-certification in Australia and Platinum in Canada.\n\nRecently, Wild Rivers supported The Chicks on their 2023 U.S. arena tour and Noah Kahan on his sold-out 2024 European arena tour. Also, Yassein’s recent and upcoming projects include collaborations with The Reklaws, Phillip Phillips, Suriel Hess, elijah woods, Zach Seabaugh, Kyle Hume, and Tyrone Wells.\n\nJoe Brooks, A&R, Position Music, stated, “I have been a fan of Khal’s band, Wild Rivers, for many years. The intelligence he applies in his lyrics and melody is exceptional. Both writing and performing at the highest level, Khal is a true all-rounder and a wonderful human. I am excited to be in business with him and I believe Position will be a very fruitful home for him.”\n\nKhalid “Khal” Yassein joins a growing Position Music label roster, already home to NoMBe, Elohim, Kyle Dion, Kid Bloom, Ryan Oakes, Layto, Welshly Arms, Blackway, Hunter Metts, Jordan Suaste, Maya Kurchner, and Dead Posey.\n\nEach week, A&R Worldwide shares a snapshot of creatives and executives that we have collaborated or worked with in various music markets around the world, albeit in recent or previous times!\n\nA&R Worldwide and its team have been involved in the world of sync since the mid-90s when the role and impact of the music supervisor was not widely known to the global music business. Since then, A&R Worldwide has helped music supervisors discover and land syncs with artists from Sia, Clubbed To Death (Rob Dougan), Imogen Heap (Frou Frou), Lily Allen, Ting Tings, Robyn, Teddybears, All Mankind, Klaxons, Vassy, The Temper Trap, Miss Li, Neil Davidge (Halo 4), and hundreds of other artists and songwriters.\n\nAlso, thanks to A&R Worldwide’s close and trusted relationships with the music supervision community, as well as its licensing work across film, TV, video games, trailers, promos, and brands, it regularly assists events around the world with curating and organizing some of the “best in class” sync forums. A&R Worldwide was also the first organization in the U.S., and internationally to organize the annual Global Sync & Brands Summit, which launched at MUSEXPO 2010 and has since been replicated by other events.\n\nA&R Worldwide was also the first organization in the U.S., and internationally to organize the annual Global Sync & Brands Summit, which launched at MUSEXPO 2010 and has since been replicated by other events.\n\nWelsh indie art rock collective Papa Jupe’s T.C. has released their new single “Milgi,” a vibrant, disco-tinged track. Described by the band as a “joyous three-minute disco-tinged stomper,” the song juxtaposes uplifting instrumentation with deadpan, melancholic lyrics. This creative tension is evident in the song’s energetic synths, pop bassline, trumpet flourishes, and disco flair, contrasting sharply with the lyrics’ somber tone. “Milgi” follows their previous single, “High Value Male,” and continues their ironic and humorous commentary on contemporary issues. The song was recorded at their DIY studio, Jupe HQ, in Cardiff, with new member Tom Emlyn contributing to its distinct sound. The band cites influences from 80s indie and new wave, inspired by the likes of Tom Tom Club and Dire Straits. The track has received support from notable radio personalities such as Chris Hawkins and Amy Lamé (BBC Radio 6 Music), Huw Stephens (BBC Radio Wales), John Kennedy (Radio X), as well as other prominent U.K. stations, and Passport Approved worldwide. Known for their cult-like performances and aesthetic, Papa Jupe’s T.C. has a strong presence in the Cardiff music scene and beyond, having played sold-out shows and supported bands like English Teacher. With “Milgi,” they continue to develop their unique sound and cult following.

With over twenty years of experience in music supervision and directing for major studios, Markey’s expertise in the creative, business, and legal aspects of the music industry equips him to lead Bold Management as the company expands. Furthermore, Bold Management has introduced Coda Recordings and Publishing, ventures designed to revolutionize the monetization and management of composers’ catalogs and co-writers’ works. Bold Management aims to bridge the gap between composers, songwriters, and producers, fostering a collaborative environment where creativity flourishes. “Bold Management is committed to highlighting and celebrating the immense talent of our composers,” says Markey. “Our mission is to ensure that composers are not only recognized but also provided with the platforms and opportunities they deserve through innovative marketing and strategic branding. With clients like David Murillo R. (Leguizamo Does America), Chris Forsgren (Fast & Furious franchise), and Philip White (Smurfs: The Lost Village, Lost in Space), we are excited to lead a new era where composers achieve the acclaim and audience they merit. Fortune truly favors the bold.”\n\nWCM FRANCE EXTENDS ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH ORELSAN & SKREAD: Orelsan and Skread, along with their companies Strong Ninja and 7th Magnitude, have signed new global agreements with Warner Chappell Music France, the music publishing division of Warner Music Group. Orelsan’s fourth solo studio album, Civilisation, was the best-selling album in France in both 2021 and 2022.
