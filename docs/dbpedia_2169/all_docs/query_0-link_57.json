Unsigned & Streamed is a new column where we stream a song from an unsigned band we at Metal Insider really dig.\n\nThis week, we’re shining a light on Trenton, NJ’s Beyond Dishonor. For the past six years, this five piece metalcore group has made a name for themselves across the Northeast for their high-energy performances and brutal yet accessible brand of metal. They’ve previously shared the same stage with the likes of Chimaira, August Burns Red, Suffocation, Carnifex and many others. Beyond Dishonor’s blend of aggression and groove shares strong resemblances to other metalcore titans such as Unearth and All Shall Perish. So without further ado, give the song “Otis (Slayer Of Demons),” off of their latest release Travesty, in the stream below.\n\n[audio:https://www.metalinsider.net/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/06-Otis-Slayer-of-Demons.mp3|titles=”Otis (Slayer of Demons)” by Beyond Dishonor]\n\nBeyond Dishonor will be entering the studio this Summer to record new material for an EP tentatively titled This Is Madness. Both 2009’s Signs Of A Struggle and 2011’s Travesty can be purchased via all digital outlets. You can stay up to date on Beyond Dishonor’s upcoming plans via their website and Facebook page."
