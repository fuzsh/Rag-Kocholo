Graham is from San Diego and moved to Nashville 5 years ago with hopes to grow all-around as an artist. Kevin and Graham dive into his life on the road as an independent artist, including the struggles of a few break downs and trying to book his own shows. Graham also discusses his variety of venues and talent he’s played with over the years, from Stagecoach with Chris Stapleton to Broadway with tourists. The guys also discuss Grahams new single and the inspiration behind his songwriting.</p> <p><strong>Podcast Description: </strong></p> <p>Unsigned and Independent is a six episode season podcast hosted by <a href='https://www.instagram.com/kickoffkevin/'>Kevin O’Connell</a> that features unsigned and independent artists and bands in Nashville. The purpose of this podcast is to highlight the journey and grind musicians go through trying to make it in the industry; the journey most fans don’t see leading up to national success. People move to music city from all over the country to chase something they have only dreamed of – making music and performing for a living. This podcast will dive into stories on the road, late nights and early mornings on the infamous Broadway, their background story, and if there is an ultimate goal for each artist or band. The artists featured on this podcast don’t have the backing of a label or sometimes even management, or a publishing team to handle their bookings, travel, etc.… But what they all have in common is a genuine passion for the love of music and performing. There is hidden talent spread throughout music city and the aim of this podcast is to give this hidden talent an opportunity to have a platform for an audience to hear their story, what the process is really like in the industry, and hopefully gain a new fan or two.  </p> <p><strong>Follow</strong> <a href='https://www.instagram.com/kickoffkevin/'>@KickOffKevin</a></p> <p> </p><p>See <a href='https://omnystudio.com/listener'>omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
