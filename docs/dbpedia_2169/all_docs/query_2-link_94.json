        "text": "We've reviewed the 20 best music distribution platforms for independent artists at every stage of their career, comparing price, features and support systems.\n\nWith the emergence of DIY music distribution comes a vast array of options the market has to offer. Which is why the team at Pirate brings you this comprehensive guide on the best music distribution services the world has to offer.\n\nDiscover the best music distribution services for independent artists and musicians in 2023. Learn about features, pricing, and distribution options to find the right service for you.\n\nWhat to consider when choosing a distribution service?\n\nWith any business or consumer spend decision, you should always think intently about what you need from such a service.\n\nPrice\n\nSupport\n\nFeatures\n\nReviews\n\nTerritory\n\nTerms\n\nYouTube Content ID\n\nShazam\n\nTikTok\n\nCommission structure\n\nRights\n\nLicencing\n\nCome up with a shortlist of a handful of services that might be a good fit for you, then reach out to their respective teams and see who comes up as most resourceful.\n\nFree vs. Paid music distribution\n\nAs they say, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Many distributors do offer a free plan, but there is usually a caveat. They could be taking a commission or there could be features that are billed on usage. Do your due diligence.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the best music distribution services for independent artists?\n\nIt depends on a variety of factors, a major one being what your yearly release cycle looks like.\n\nIf you intend to embark on a high frequency release cycle, one of the subscription based offerings would likely be more suitable.\n\nCan I release covers and monetise the songs with music distributors?\n\nTechnically speaking, the big DSPs such as Spotify and YouTube already pay a blanket licences for the musical works that are âperformedâ and âreproducedâ on their platforms. But you should still obtain a licence from the rightsholder of the composition, with the exception being if itâs in the public domain.\n\nWhich streaming service pays the most?\n\nWhilst there is no fixed rate per stream, there are plenty of statistics available about this. None of the platforms decide what the rate is, the royalty pool is divided up on a pro-rata basis.\n\nWhere can I get smart links (Pre-Saves)?\n\nThe emergence of landing page platforms, and pre-save solutions means there is a lot on offer in terms of creating buzz for your next release.\n\nHere are a handful of those services:\n\nToneden\n\nFeatureFM\n\nLinkfire\n\nCDBaby (ShowNow)\n\nPresave.io\n\nLinktree\n\nCan you use multiple music distribution services simultaneously?\n\nIndeed, you may find yourself using different providers for different releases. You can even migrate distributions between them, as long as you donât miss any important steps.\n\nWhat to consider when changing your music distributor?\n\nItâs important to consider why you are changing and to make sure you have tapped the resources that are available to you with your current service provider.\n\nIf youâre having trouble with the service, make sure you reach out to support, then if they donât respond promptly, then it might be best to look elsewhere.\n\nWhich music distribution service is best for Spotify distribution?\n\nDistrokid are most affiliated with Spotify, but that doesnât by itself make them better. Check out Spotifyâs preferred partners page for more information.\n\nDo music distribution companies own your music?\n\nGenerally no, you retain the rights, but itâs always good to read the terms and get professional advice before you hand over your IP."
