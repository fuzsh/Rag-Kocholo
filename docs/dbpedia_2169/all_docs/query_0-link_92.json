        "text": "Solid State Records is a record label that originated in 1997 out of Seattle, Washington in the United States. The label was founded by Brandon Ebel to release heavier bands, while his parent label focused on punk, rock, and folk. The label primarily focuses on metalcore and hardcore punk, with death metal bands occasionally joining the label.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe label began officially in 1997, after signing Living Sacrifice in 1995. The label of Tooth & Nail were hesitant to sign the band, save for founder Brandon Ebel. When the label was founded, Living Sacrifice and Strongarm were the label's first releases; Strongarm's Advent of a Miracle and Living Sacrifice's Reborn.[1]\n\nFrom there, the label began signing several metalcore and hardcore bands, including Training for Utopia, Zao, Spitfire, Stretch Arm Strong and Embodyment. Over the years, after releasing several seminal records, including Zao's Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest, Spitfire's The Dead Next Door, Embodyment's Embrace the Eternal and Norma Jean's O God the Aftermath, the label had acquired a new lineup of bands, including Demon Hunter, Becoming the Archetype and Extol.\n\nReligious Views[]\n\nThe label is a Christian label, however, Brandon Ebel stated that not every band or staff member was a Christian. Bands that stated they were not Christian bands included Stretch Arm Strong,[2] Gwen Stacy,[3] He is Legend,[4] The Famine,[5] Training for Utopia,[6] and The Agony Scene.[7] More recently, several bands, including Silent Planet,[8] Norma Jean[9] and August Burns Red[10] stated that they were not Christian bands or no longer Christian bands.\n\nCurrent Artists[]\n\nAzusa[11]\n\nDeath Therapy[12]\n\nDemon Hunter\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada[13]\n\nThe Drowned God[14]\n\nEarth Groans[15]\n\nEmpty[16]\n\nFit for a King[17]\n\nLifelong\n\nLightworker\n\nMantric\n\nNorma Jean[18]\n\nThe Ongoing Concept[19]\n\nPhinehas[20]\n\nSilent Planet[21]\n\nTo Speak of Wolves[22]\n\nWolves at the Gate [23]\n\nFormer Artists[]\n\nActive[]\n\nAdvent (Bridge 9 Records)\n\nThe Agony Scene (Independent)\n\nAs Cities Burn (Independent)\n\nAs They Sleep (Luxor Records)\n\nAugust Burns Red (SharpTone Records)\n\nBeloved (Independent)\n\nBlindside (WASA Recordings)\n\nDestroy the Runner (Independent)\n\nEmery (Bad Christian Records)\n\nFew Left Standing (Independent)\n\nHe is Legend (Spinefarm Records)\n\nLife in Your Way (Independent)\n\nLiving Sacrifice[1] (Independent)\n\nMyChildren MyBride (eOne Productions)\n\nMy Heart to Fear (Luxor Records)\n\nOh, Sleeper (Independent)\n\nSoul Embraced (Rottweiler Records)\n\nTrenches (Unsigned)\n\nUnderoath (MNRK Music Group)\n\nZao (Observed/Observer)\n\nDisbanded[]\n\n3rd Root\n\nBloodshed (Members joined: The O.C.
