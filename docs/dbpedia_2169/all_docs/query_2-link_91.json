        "text": "Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh\n\nImpressionist painters Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh met in 1887. They hit it off straight away and soon after meeting, van Gogh invited Gauguin to stay with him in his house in Arles, France. This was in hopes of beginning his dream of having his own artist’s collective.\n\nBoth artists learnt from each other, spending their time developing new techniques and broadening their color palettes with new pigments. Despite this, tempers frayed and the friends had many quarrels due to van Gogh’s stubborn nature clashing with Gauguin’s pride. A few weeks before he left, Gauguin painted a portrait of van Gogh painting sunflowers. When the artist saw the painting, he supposedly said that, while it looks a bit like him, he felt Gauguin had portrayed him as “a madman”. However, later in a letter to his brother Theo van Gogh he said: “My face has lit up after all a lot since, but it was indeed me, extremely tired and charged with electricity as I was then”.\n\nMan Ray and Marcel Duchamp\n\nWhen artists Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp first met in 1915, the pair ended up playing an impromptu game of tennis. Man Ray was quoted as saying: “Duchamp didn’t speak English and my French was non-existent… in order to have a conversation I would give a name to each pass and each time Duchamp would reply in English with ‘yes’.”\n\nThe pair found common ground in their shared independent spirits and sense of freedom, as well as a passion for chess. Man Ray and Duchamp’s creative processes were also similar in the way that both artists tried to undermine artistic conventions. In particular, Man Ray’s taste for using objects and experimenting with language was inspired by Duchamp.\n\nThey found common ground in the subjects and themes within their work, as both depicted everyday American life and culture. The pair took on a familial relationship and spent a lot of time together. When Grandma Moses turned 88 in 1948, Rockwell delivered an enormous birthday cake to her house, a mark of affection for his fellow artist.\n\nCamille Pissarro and Paul Cézanne\n\nCamille Pissarro and Paul Cézanne met at the Académie de Charles Suisse in Paris and a friendship and collaboration soon developed between the two Impressionist artists. For Cézanne, he recognized the same rejection of tradition and academic training that characterized his own work.\n\nHelen Frankenthaler and Grace Hartigan\n\nHelen Frankenthaler and Grace Hartigan forged a lasting friendship in what was primarily the \"boys club\" of the New York City art scene in the 1930s and 40s. Sisters in Abstract Expressionism, the artists became friends early in their careers and helped define the pillars of what we now know as feminism in art.\n\nThere were periods of time where their friendship cooled though, like in the late 1950s when Hartigan didn’t get on with Frankenthaler’s lover Clement Greenberg, an art critic who thought Hartigan’s latest work had regressed. Yet there was resilience in their friendship and the pair always came back together eventually.\n\nThe two artists became friends, despite their contrasting personalities and artistic interests. Degas’ relationship with Manet and Impressionism was to be a stormy one, but the encounter was a turning-point in Degas’ career. He helped form the loose group of the Impressionists, but because of his training, found it hard to let go of the traditions he’d been taught. As such, he wanted non-Impressionists included in their well-known exhibitions, and disliked the scandal created by the shows being wary of the labels and publicity his colleagues sought. This is partly why after the 1870s the two artists were never as close as they once were."
