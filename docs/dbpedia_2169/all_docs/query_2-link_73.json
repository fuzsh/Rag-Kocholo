        "text": "When I first started researching and listening to all these bands from North Carolina, along with solo musicians and acclaimed bandleaders, an eventual euphoria took over the initial overwhelm. And not just because of the many stories behind songs and albums produced and created by these amazing people.\n\nThe thing that really stood out to me is that many of these singers, songwriters, and bandleaders still live in North Carolina or return often. And the fact that Carolina remains on so many of their minds is a clear indicator that we’ve got something special in this state.\n\nBecause there are so many, we’ve organized this guide to help you find that amazing artist that you love:\n\nBands from North Carolina\n\nMusicians from North Carolina (Solo and Bandleaders)\n\nI know there are many more to share but for now, here are 50-plus bands and musicians from North Carolina that are worth a listen right now!\n\nList of Bands from North Carolina Featured In This Guide\n\nArchers of Loaf\n\nThe Avett Brothers\n\nBetween the Buried and Me\n\nBombadil\n\nCarolina Chocolate Drops\n\nShirley Caesar\n\nChatham County Line\n\nChatham Rabbits\n\nChe Apalache\n\nChócala\n\nCorrosion of Conformity\n\nSylvan Esso\n\nIt’s Snakes\n\nJodeci\n\nLittle Brother\n\nRainbow Kitten Surprise\n\nSouthern Culture on the Skids\n\nThe Spongetones\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers\n\nSteep Canyon Rangers\n\nSuperchunk\n\nWatchhouse (formerly Mandolin Orange)\n\nYaggfu FRONT\n\nWhile reading this post and after finishing, check out the Spotify Playlist we created that features songs from all the artists we mentioned. We also included a few of these artists in a fun checklist inside our NC Bucket List book!\n\nArchers of Loaf\n\nArchers of Loaf’s members all originally hail from North Carolina (Asheville) and singer/guitarist Eric Bachmann even spent some time studying saxophone at App State in Boone.\n\n“Web in Front” made the soundtrack of the Kevin Smith-directed Mallrats and recent release “Raleigh Days” is a fun listen, too!\n\nRead More: 80+ Great Things to Do in Asheville (The Asheville Bucket List)\n\nThe Avett Brothers\n\nIn 2000, Seth and Scott started The Avett Brothers in Cabarrus County.

Their songs are a journey through a variety of genres, from blues to death metal and many more in between.\n\n“Voice of Trespass” off Automata II is an excellent example of their range.\n\nBombadil\n\nDuke students Bryan Rahija and Daniel Michalak formed folk-pop band Bombadil while studying abroad in Bolivia, recording multiple demos at an elementary school in La Paz. Rahija eventually left the band but Bombadil has continued on with Michalak, James Phillips, and Stacy Harden.\n\n2013’s Metrics of Affection is a sooting showcase of this North Carolina band’s harmonies and lyrics.\n\nCarolina Chocolate Drops\n\nThe Grammy-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops formed in Durham as one of the only all-Black string bands. Many of their songs were based on traditional Piedmont music, including old-time fiddler Joe Thompson.\n\nThe Drops also touched upon R&B traditions, which you’ll find in “Hit’ em Up Style.” The group’s songs have reached far and wide, including “Daughter’s Lament,” which featured on the Hunger Games Soundtrack.\n\nShirley Caesar\n\nDurham-born Shirley Caesar has released more than 40 albums and her 2016 Fill This House topped the Gospel Billboard chart.

Sarah and Austin make up today’s version, which combines the traditions and old, forgotten stories with theirs.\n\nTheir debut All I Want from You is filled with sweet, reminiscent songs like “Come Home” and “Rambler.”\n\nChe Apalache\n\nJoe Troop is the only member of Che Apalache from North Carolina, so that gets this band into our list. They formed in Argentina while the Winston-Salem-raised Troop was teaching bluegrass music.\n\nListen to songs like “The Dreamer” and you’ll see why Che Apalache has built up such a huge following and acclaim. Bluegrass icon Bela Fleck is one fan who went on to produce their second album Rearrange My Heart.\n\nChócala\n\nCharlotte-based Chócala is an adventurous band that anyone with a taste for the eclectic will appreciate. Evolving in 2019 out of their previous effort Patabamba, the group’s self-titled debut is a journey that you’ll want to take.\n\nBased on the spontaneity of that effort, we hope they’ll keep things open and adventurous on subsequent albums.\n\nCorrosion of Conformity\n\nStoner Rock legends Corrosion of Conformity hail from Raleigh and after a couple of hiatuses are still in action. Blind and Deliverance are probably their two best-known albums, though the band has produced a ton of headbang-worthy hits.\n\nSylvan Esso\n\nAmelia Meath and Nick Sanborn paired up in Durham between 2012 and 2013 and have been going strong ever since.

Drummer and lead singer Hope Nicholls is known to many as the Godmother of Charlotte Rock and guitarist Aaron Pitkin rocked out with her as part of Fetchin Bones in the late 1980s.\n\n“Dance Party with Cats” is one of their toe-tappingest songs, part of their sophomore effort It’s Snakes II.\n\nJodeci\n\nJodeci, also known as “The Bad Boys of R&B,” formed in Charlotte in 1989 and made a splash with Forever My Lady and two additional platinum albums.

The trio remained intact for three albums before 9th Wonder departed following Getback.\n\nA hiatus began in 2010, though all three reunited briefly in 2018 and Phonte and Big Pooh continuing on in 2019.\n\n“Lovin’ It” from their second album The Minstrel Show remains the group’s most popular song to date.\n\nRainbow Kitten Surprise\n\nRainbow Kitten Surprise recorded its first EP in an App State dorm room in 2013. Original members Sam Melo and Darrick “Bozzy” Keller have since added three more members and the group eventually signed on with Elektra Records after a stint on Split Rail Records, a student-run label.\n\nTheir talents and harmonic instrumentation capabilities come together throughout the band’s catalog, especially in “Cocaine Jesus” and “Fail!”\n\nSouthern Culture on the Skids\n\nSouthern Culture on the Skids formed in Chapel Hill in the early 1980s and has released more than a dozen albums. As they move into their fourth decade of playing, Rick Miller, Dave Hartman, and Mary Huff show no signs of slowing down.\n\n“Camel Walk” and “Freak Flag” are a couple of the fun listens you’ll encounter when digging into this band that seemingly ventures into unknown territory during each song.\n\nThe Spongetones\n\nThe Spongetones started in Charlotte and its reach has gone far beyond North Carolina. Their British Invasion-influenced sound has featured on ABC World News Now and the band toured Japan for a couple of days in 2009.\n\n“My Girl Maryanne” and “She Goes out with Everybody” are fun listens to start your journey with the Spongetones.\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers\n\nYou can’t reminisce about the 1990s “Swing Revival” without mentioning the Squirrel Nut Zippers. The band debuted in Chapel Hill and its popularity peaked with performances at Summer Olympics in 1996 and during various TV appearances.\n\nHot was the band’s most popular album, with “Hell” and “Put a Lid on It” its two biggest hits.\n\nSteep Canyon Rangers\n\nSteep Canyon Rangers had been around for almost a decade before joining forces in 2009 with acclaimed actor/banjo player Steve Martin. Martin and the Rangers played together at Bonaroo and Austin City Limits before recording Rare Bird Alert.\n\nThey released another album with him, aptly titled The Long-Awaited Album with Steve Martin. On their own, the Rangers have done quite well, too, taking home 2013’s “Best Bluegrass Album” at the Grammys for Nobody Knows You.\n\nSuperchunk\n\nSuperchunk was a big part of the 1990s Chapel Hill music scene with their version of DIY power-pop-punk. Since starting in 1989, the band has released 11 studio albums.\n\n“Driveway to Driveway” off 1994’s Foolish and their 2018 album’s titular track “What a Time to Be Alive” shows that this band is still rocking, even after 30 years of playing.\n\nWatchhouse (formerly Mandolin Orange)\n\nFor more than a decade, the Chapel Hill duo formerly known as Mandolin Orange has released six albums and toured extensively, including a show at the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh in 2019. You can label them Americana or Folk but one thing is clear.\n\nThere’s a real synergy between songwriter Andrew Marlin and Emily Frantz, especially on songs like “Wildfire” and “Wolves.”\n\nYaggfu FRONT\n\nYaggfu FRONT is about as old-school hip hop as it gets on this list. The trio got started as DJs on NC State’s NCSU and got the attention of Mercury Records, who signed them in 1993.\n\nWhile Yaggfu FRONT is listed as active today, not much information is available about the group. “Busted Loop” and “Left Field” are great ways to start your listening journey with them.\n\nMusicians from North Carolina (Solo and Bandleaders)\n\nClay Aiken\n\nClay Aiken is more of a political activist today, but the Central North Carolina-born artist’s memorable second-place finish on American Idol in 2003 remains on many music fans’ minds.\n\nIn fact, he’s the first of many artists mentioned here to get their start on that show. Since then, he’s released multiple albums, with his debut Measure of a Man going multi-platinum.\n\nTori Amos\n\nTori Amos might not have spent a lot of time in North Carolina, but she was born in Newton. And as of 2012, Amos has been a North Carolina Music Hall of Fame inductee.\n\n“Cornflake Girl” and “Caught a Lite Sneeze” deserve a least a listen before moving onto the rest of the hit-filled Amos catalog.\n\nChuck Brown\n\nChuck Brown, also known as the “Godfather of Go-Go,” sadly passed away at age 75 in 2012. The Gaston-born musician moved from North Carolina at age six and experienced many hardships during his early years.\n\nHe found his way with music and is credited as a major influence of Go-Go, a DC area-developed subgenre of funk.\n\nRead More: Christmas Town USA (How to See the Wonderful McAdenville Christmas Lights)\n\nEric Church\n\nEric Church might call Nashville home today but he’s North Carolina, through and through. Before releasing chart-topping hits like “Springsteen” and “Record Year,” Church was born in Granite Falls.\n\nHe even graduated from App State and married his wife in Blowing Rock. The Churches’ Chief Cares Fund helps underprivileged families in Tennessee, North Carolina, and elsewhere throughout the world.\n\nJ Cole\n\nFayetteville-raised J Cole long proved himself through music and eventually landed as the first of Jay-Z’s Roc Nation signees. He did more than break through, with multiple platinum records and massive hits.\n\n2014 Forest Hills Drive is one that many fans will say is his best, thanks to songs like “No Role Modelz” and “Wet Dreamz.”\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nOne who left this world far too soon, John Coltrane is a musician from North Carolina who needs no introduction. But in case you didn’t know, this saxophonist and composer was in fact born in Hamlet, Richmond County and grew up in High Point.\n\nAmong the many songs to kick back and enjoy, “Blue Train” and “In a Sentimental Mood” first come to mind.\n\nElizabeth Cotten\n\nYou might not know who Elizabeth Cotten is but you might definitely know some of the Carrboro native’s songs. She wrote “Freight Train” at age 11 and that song has been covered by many artists, including Bob Dylan and Joan Baez.\n\nThankfully, much of her work was preserved in the late 1950s when Mike Seeger recorded them in Cotten’s house. Those songs and many others were packaged in album form titled Folksongs and Instrumentals with Guitar.\n\nGreg Cox\n\nWilson’s Greg Cox mixes gospel and R&B in his inspiring collection of songs. “Bigger Dreams” is an excellent example of the power behind his words, especially during the chorus.\n\nCox’s most popular effort “The Other Side” features Charlotte jazz vocalist Emily Sage and earned much praise on NPR’s World Cafe.\n\nGeorge Clinton\n\nIs it too much speculation to assume that the NC Music Hall of Fame belongs in Kannapolis because it’s also where the Godfather of Funk was born?\n\nHis influence throughout the music industry is clear, whether you’ve listened to Parliament-Funkadelic outright or heard Clinton’s work sampled by various producers and artists.\n\nCharlie Daniels\n\nWilmington-born Charlie Daniels might be primarily known for “The Devil Went Down to Georgia,” but he’s made many musical contributions beyond that iconic hit.\n\nHis writing credits include “It Hurts Me,” which King Elvis Presley recorded. While working as a session musician in the 1970s, Daniels played on Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen albums.\n\nDaughtry\n\nDaughtry frontman and namesake Chris Daughtry is from Roanoke Rapids and two of the four remaining members hail from North Carolina.

The band formed in Chapel Hill and 1997’s Whatever and Ever Amen brought them mainstream success.\n\n“Brick” is the most popular song among fans but “Battle of Who Could Care Less” is one of many dashboard-thumpers that’s perfect for your next road trip.\n\nAndy Griffith\n\nAndy Griffith not only starred in TV shows about and filmed in North Carolina, but his credits also included “musician.” He didn’t write the Andy Griffith show’s title song “The Fishin’ Hole,” but he did sing and record a version of it.\n\nThe Mount Airy native also won a Grammy for his platinum I Love to Tell the Story: 25 Timeless Hymns.\n\nJoshua Gunn\n\nMany folks in Durham and surrounding areas know him as Joshua Gunn or J Gunn. Both are entirely possible if you voted for Durham City Council in 2019 and if you’ve had the pleasure of hearing his music.\n\nGunn’s “What a Wonderful Durham” was a collaborative effort with Made in Durham, a cross-industry community cooperative that hopes to prepare younger generations for joining the workforce.\n\nAnthony Hamilton\n\nIt’s easy to fall in love with Anthony Hamilton’s voice when listening to “Charlene” or “Coming from Where I’m From.” The Charlotte native has released six albums and has been on the Grammy’s radar since at least 2004.\n\nHis “You’ve Got the Love I Need” won “Best Traditional R&B Performance in 2009.\n\nPercy Heath\n\nYou can listen to Percy Heath’s solo work but might also want to check out the Wilmington native’s long list of credits. You can hear his double bass on multiple Miles Davis albums, including Blue Haze, and also on Dizzy Gillespie’s Dizzy and Strings.\n\nHeath was also a longtime member of the Modern Jazz Quartet, appearing on albums released between 1952 and 1993.\n\nJason Jet\n\nCharlotte’s Jason Jet brings a truly unique mix dubbed “electro-soul.” In “Up All Night,” the melodies and lyrics harken back to the days of Soul’s heyday.\n\nSongs like “Superhero” demonstrate that Jet is looking ahead to forge his own legacy, “putting an ‘S’ on his chest.”\n\nRonnie Milsap\n\nRobbinsville native Ronnie Milsap faced a difficult early childhood until age five when he was sent to the Governor Morehead School for the Blind in Raleigh. His passion for music truly came to fruition there and Milsap mastered the piano.\n\nHe wrote and performed many hits over the years, including “(I’m a) Stand by My Woman Man” and “Smoky Mountain Rain.”\n\nPetey Pablo\n\nPetey Pablo was born in Greenville and his “Raise Up” put him on the map and is played by the Marching Tar Heels during football games when UNC makes a third-down stop.\n\nPablo’s biggest song to date, though, is “Freek-a-Leek,” which featured on his second album Writing in My Diary: 2nd Entry.\n\nAs of 2024, Pablo, along with 5 other music legends, is a member of the NC Music Hall of Fame.\n\nMaceo Parker\n\nMaceo Parker is another of our musicians from North Carolina that you may not recognize so easily on his own but you’ve probably heard his work. The Kinston-born saxophonist featured on many James Brown songs during the 1960s and also played with Parliament-Funkadelic a decade later.\n\nHis list of credits continues on but Parker’s solo work, including “Children’s World,” is worth a listen.\n\nKellie Pickler\n\nChris Daughtry wasn’t the only North Carolina to make it far into the fifth season of American Idol. Albemarle-born Kellie Pickler finished sixth and soon after, signed a record deal and released her debut Small Town Girl.\n\nHer latest release was The Woman I Am in 2013 but she’s still been active on the stage and screen. Pickler and professional ballroom dancer Derek Hough won the sixteenth season of Dancing with the Stars.\n\nRapsody\n\nRapsody is the second person on this list from Snow Hill in Greene County, along with Petey Pablo. This rapper stands alone, making a name for herself that led to a debut on 9th Wonder’s The Dream Merchant Vol 2.\n\nRapsody has released three of her own studio albums, though her guest appearance credit list is impressive at least. 2017’s Laila’s Wisdom earned two Grammy nominations for “Best Rap Album” and “Best Rap Song.”\n\nEarl Scruggs\n\nThere may not be any other musicians from North Carolina who have a style of playing named after them. Three-finger or Scruggs-style picking helped bring the banjo and Bluegrass music itself to the forefront.\n\nYou can learn about this and more at the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby. If you can’t make it out to Cleveland County to pay homage, give “Foggy Mountain Breakdown” a listen before enjoying the rest of this musical legend’s work.\n\nNina Simone\n\nWhen listening to her renditions of “Feeling Good” or “I Put a Spell on You,” you’re bound to come away with memories of Nina Simone’s captivating voice.

His “I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free” became a popular Civil Rights era song and was even covered by Nina Simone.\n\nJames Taylor\n\nBoston might be where James Taylor was born but there’ll always be “Carolina in My Mind,” in his own words. Taylor spent much of his childhood in Chapel Hill while his father Isaac taught at UNC, even rising to become dean of the School of Medicine there.\n\nAlong with “Carolina in My Mind,” there are many hits to sample from Taylor, including “Fire and Rain” and “How Sweet It Is.”\n\nRandy Travis\n\nMarshville’s very own Randy Travis has made it very big, even though he was initially rejected by every major label in Nashville. He’s recorded 20 studio albums and released more than a dozen number-one singles.\n\n“1982” and “On the Other Hand” are just two of his many big hits and two that show his range between slower ballads and more up-tempo songs.\n\nDoc Watson\n\nDoc Watson hailed from Deep Gap in Watauga County (near Boone) and shared many songs that he learned from word of mouth (along with many others) to the world. Until his passing in 2012, Doc was regarded as a living legend in bluegrass, folk, country, and gospel circles.\n\nWatson’s legacy includes a wonderful collection of tunes and MerleFest, which takes place each spring and was named for his son Merle who tragically died in 1985. Doc Watson Day commemorates his legacy each June in Boone, too.\n\nG Yamazawa\n\nG Yamazawa is a poetry slammer/rapper who’s added beats to his rhymes in the form of two studio albums and multiple singles and EPs. While he’s moved to the West Coast to continue his career, Yamazawa hasn’t forgotten his roots.\n\n2017’s Shouts to Durham includes songs such as “Hwy 751” and “North Cack,” with the latter featuring the aforementioned J Gunn and fellow spoken word champion Kane Smego.\n\nWhich of these Bands from North Carolina (or Musicians) Do You Love Most?\n\nIf you haven’t listened to many of these musicians from North Carolina, we hope you’ll find time to dig into at least a few of their catalogs.
