        "text": "One of the things that makes America great is how diverse it is. While Americans share many things, collectively there are also plenty of distinctions between different regions. This is very apparent when you look at musical tastes. You can learn a lot about the different states by looking at their favorite genres and favorite artists, so that’s exactly what we’ll do.\n\nBefore we look at the findings, it’s important to note that the way that such information is gathered influences the result. The sort of songs popular on streaming sites like Spotify aren’t necessarily the types of songs popular on the radio. To get the most widely representative results, we’ll be looking at both the top genres in terms of live performances and the most popular musicians according to Pandora 2017 streaming numbers. Finally, to give you a taste of the music each state has individually produced we’ll look at the most popular bands that have come from each state. A handful of artists from major metropolitan areas might dominate the top of the charts at any given moment, but that doesn’t mean that each and every state hasn’t contributed their own unique artists to America’s musical tapestry.\n\nWith all that out of the way, let’s take a closer look at America’s musical landscape.\n\nAlabama\n\nMost popular genre: Country\n\nMost popular contemporary artist: Kevin Gates\n\nMost famous homegrown band: Alabama\n\nAlaska\n\nMost popular genre: Country\n\nMost popular contemporary artist: Eminem\n\nMost famous homegrown band: Portugal.

is that while live tastes are diverse across the country the most popular artists tend to be rappers. Out of fifty states, only one gave the top spot to a singer, with Hawaii streaming Bruno Mars more than anyone else. Nielsen found that 2017 was the year where hip-hop became America’s leading genre, finally surpassing rock in terms of popularity.\n\nWhile hip-hop and R&B are more dominant than ever the popularity of the genres are driven by streaming. That’s why they dominate the “contemporary artist” category but almost never show up when we look at most popular touring genres. Younger listeners are more likely to enjoy hip-hop and use streaming sites. Genres like rock and country are more likely to be enjoyed via radio, record, or live performance. According to a report from Nielsen Music, rock accounts for 40.1% of the total album sales even though it only accounts for 16% of total streams. On the other hand, kip-hop and R&B account for just 17% of total album sales while they captured 29.1% of the total streams.\n\nStreaming numbers are also subject to frequent change. For example, Kevin Gates was at the height of his popularity when Pandora released its figures in mid-2017. But in the early months of 2018, it feels like Kevin Gates has dropped off the planet. It should also be noted that Eminem dominated ten states despite the fact that he hadn’t released a new album in years when the Pandora’s numbers were released. That speaks to his lasting power, something he shares with artists like Guns N’ Roses, U2, Metallica, and Garth Brooks, artists who dominated concert ticket sales even if they weren’t found at the top of the latest sales charts.\n\nMusic in America is currently in an interesting place. The internet has made it easier than ever for artists to release their music for the world to hear, but at the same time it can feel like a smaller group of artists is capturing the top of the charts. Still, when it comes to touring shows and local scenes rock and country musicians are helping to bring fans together all across the country. While the charts might be dominated by music that is streamed over phones and computers the local concert venues are packed with people looking for that classic combination of drums, a guitar, and a singer that can make them feel something."
