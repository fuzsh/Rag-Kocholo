        "text": "Multi-Platinum, chart-topping hip-hop superstar Logic has switched labels to BMG, citing the company’s distinctive commitment to giving artists control of their careers.\n\nLogic’s new multi-album global partnership with BMG will allow him for the first time to own his own sound recordings. It is his first new label deal since his debut album Under Pressure was released in 2014. The first new music from his planned upcoming studio album is expected imminently.\n\nReferences to his new partnership with BMG feature on ‘Sayonara’, the last song of Logic’s latest album, Vinyl Days, in lines like “Independent now, won't double back, I rep the BMG” and “Independent shit next, BMG, VMG, Bobby Boy, Sayonara”.\n\nLogic said, “There’s a lot of bullshit in the music industry. I’m just glad to move on to a place where I can be independent, and respected as an artist, and feel like I’m in control of my career.”\n\nTim Reid, SVP, Repertoire & Marketing, BMG, said, “As an artist, creator, and entrepreneur, Logic is the perfect fit for BMG and we are excited to join forces. He has a unique authenticity that has consistently enabled him to remain among the best in the business.”\n\nDan Gill, BMG’s EVP, Recorded Music, Los Angeles, said, “Our new partnership is an incredible opportunity to begin the next chapter of Logic’s career and further expand his brand. Everyone at BMG is well-positioned and prepared to amplify his creative vision and elevate his music to the next level.”\n\nThomas Scherer, BMG’s President, Repertoire & Marketing, Los Angeles and New York, said, “BMG is fast becoming the home of more and more established artists departing long-time deals, moving towards independence, and wanting control over their careers. BMG has an impeccable team helping artists achieve their goals by not only delivering the highest level of service, but the attention to detail and strategy that sophisticated artists desire.”\n\nSince his emergence in 2010, multi-Platinum Grammy Award-nominated Logic (aka Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, aka Bobby Hall) has separated himself from the pack as one of the most prolific artists of the past decade, a New York Times bestselling author, and a positive force for change. The Maryland native progressed from a now-legendary run of mixtapes to Number One albums, Grammy Award nominations, dozens of Gold and Platinum certifications, and sold-out arena tours around the world, with more than six billion streams and counting.\n\nIn 2014, he shook the culture with his full-length debut Under Pressure. It bowed at number four on the Billboard 200 before ultimately reaching Platinum status. In 2015 came the conceptual opus The Incredible True Story, followed by Logic making history with Everybody in 2017. It marked his first debut atop the Billboard Top 200 and uplifted millions with the anthem ‘1-800-273-8255’ (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) [feat. Alessia Cara & Khalid]. The song notably has been certified 8x Platinum, received Grammy Award nominations in the categories of Song of the Year and Best Music Video, and addressed the suicide crisis head-on. Upon release, the hotline generated its “second-highest daily call volume in history.” Bookending the success of these records, he maintained a breakneck pace with a string of official mixtapes: Bobby Tarantino [including the gold-selling ‘Flexicution’] in 2016, the chart-topping Billboard 200 Bobby Tarantino II [including the Gold-selling ‘44 More’ and ‘Everyday’ with Marshmello] in 2018, and YSIV also in 2018. The latter boasted ‘One Day’ [ft. Ryan Tedder of One Republic].\n\nHe made his literary debut with the fictional Supermarket [Simon & Schuster] in 2019. In its wake, he became the “first hip-hop artist to debut at Number One on the New York Times paperback fiction bestseller list.” The accompanying ‘soundtrack’ of the same name crashed the Top 10 of the Billboard Alternative Albums chart, an ‘alternative’ chart first for Logic. His fifth full-length album Confessions of a Dangerous Mind captured Number One on the Billboard Top 200 and boasted the platinum ‘Homicide’ [ft. Eminem].\n\nAfter taking a short hiatus from music, Logic returned with his final major label release, Vinyl Days, teaming up with frequent collaborator 6ix and artists such as Action Bronson, Russ, Wiz Khalifa, and the RZA. Vinyl Days symbolizes the end of a decade long tenure at his former label home, but also marks the beginning of the next era in Logic’s career at BMG."
