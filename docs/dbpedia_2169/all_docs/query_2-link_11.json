A definite favourite.....It never gets old, and is one I can listen to over & over. Brilliant lyrics:\n\nin the paper today\n\ntales of war and of waste\n\nbut you turn right over to the T.V. page\n\nI also love Distant Sun lyrics:\n\nTell me all the things you would change\n\nI donâ€™t pretend to know what you want\n\nWhen you come around and spin my top\n\nTime and again, time and again\n\nand Fingers of Love lyrics:\n\nColour is its own reward\n\nThe chiming of a perfect chord"
