Please bear in mind though there are some bands that would rather totally do their own thing and have for a while so not always possible to sign, even if we would like to do so. We signed Sanguine Hum on recommendation as we really loved them. Just to mention whilst we do like artists that are a bit leftfield as well, we don't really go for the bands that are almost metal as Cherry Red have another label for this. We have one such artist already lined up for an April release , American too and recommended to us by Alan McGee , absolutely great stuff we think and not an artist I have ever seen mentioned.\n\nThey might be a little heavy based on what you've said above, but I'm 100% behind The Mariana Hollow from the UK. Alt-prog-hard rock (some softer stuff mixed in) with a very charismatic frontwoman that resists easy comparison yet is accessible to all fans of the genre.\n\nVideo for their \"Your Halo\" single:\n\nApproximately 30-minute documentary vid about the band and the making of their latest EP, \"Scars, Not Wounds.\"\n\nI've interviewed them twice for my podcast and find them to be a genuine group of people who are dedicated to what they do and are gaining a big following in and around London. Just need that last extra boost. Pretty sure they're looking to be signed based on conversations I've had with them. I'd love to see them gain a wider audience.\n\nAbsolutely no offense, I was just having a little fun. I would say the songs are basically written, mapped out and basic arrangements sequenced into Logic (I had a fun three weeks of updating all my Macs to Mavericks and Logic X, as well as dealing with the re-authorizing all my plugins (note to Squids - Sonic Synth won't authorize!) and getting 32 bit plugins to work in Logic X.\n\nI definitely have enough good material for a CD and then some. But the Herculean task of finalizing arrangements, going into the studio to record proper drums (as opposed to sequenced drums), recording bass, guitar, vocals, then fixing/editing all the tracks, mixing and mastering 60 minutes of music - I would need 6 months to a year full time to do it right. As much as I'd love to take a year off, Wells Fargo, the holder of my two mortgages, would not approve.\n\nAlso, if you saw my studio, you would understand how easy it is to lose site of the task at hand (working on music), as opposed to just playing and noodling. I go into the studio with the best intensions, but then I fire up the Hammond or Minimoog (or their digital equivalents) or plug my doubleneck into some of my amps and just PLAY. After a hard day or week of work, the last thing I want to do is work on music, I just want to play.\n\nI think the material is better than the first (I've had over 15 years to write it) and would love to release it. Every year I say I'm going to do it, but then life gets in the way (divorce, moving, remarriage, switching jobs, starting my own law practice). Now I know how Gabriel feels - releasing an album every 8 years! It's hard work.\n\nIt took me about 3 years of noodling, tweaking and re-recording to arrive at the solo project I did (see sig ) I find for that sort of thing it's best to get fired up for short bursts, get away and come back when you can be more objective. But at some point you decide it's close enough and let it go *lol* Like Michalangelo, you have to \"make an end of it\". If you have no natural inclination to decide when it's done a deadline can be a great way to do it."
