        "text": "I got it wrong. Hands up. I will admit it. I have been saying the Grants are the best unsigned band in the United Kingdom. No. They are the best unsigned band in the world. And the world is theirs; at the Queen is Dead (the unofficial Grants residency and fan club) last Friday, people were shocked to hear the band playing stadium-sized songs in a small club. Shocked. Clubbers came up to the DJ booth in awe of the band and I could only tell them the best songs were yet to come. For many it was watching a masterclass in how to do it right, especially when so many bands are doing it wrong. The Grants are working class and ambitious, and lead singer and songwriter Chris Grant is reminding me more and more of a young Noel Gallagher.\n\nLike Gallagher, Grant's main preoccupation is writing big songs capturing northern innocence. It's a soulful escapism that eschews the hard man approach to songwriting. As with the best bands I've known, I get excited to hear the new songs and their musical progression.\n\nIf Courtney Love wanted a Crazy Horse garage band, she missed out with the Grants. They are a modern-day Crazy Horse, instigating frenzied feedback and subtle atmospherics while painting Chris Grant's songs with psychedelic colours. When the Grants get it right, it's like a showdown against apathetic rock'n'roll.\n\nPeople who have never seen them ask me \"Why so serious about the Grants?\" It's obvious they've never seen the band live, because they play as if it's the last happening on planet Earth.\n\nI took the band down to In the City and the heavy interest never unnerved them. I laughed as Chris announced to the crowd he felt like \"cattle in a cattle market\" before playing one of the most talked-about (not to mention atmospheric) sets of the event; conjuring up such a haunting and spooky vibe it will rank as one of the best performances in the history of Tony Wilson's festival.\n\nThe Grants could be one of the few bands in the history of Liverpool - after Echo and the Bunnymen - to step out of the shadows of the Beatles. Why? Chris Grant's songwriting is equalling that of Ocean Rain-era Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant, when the Bunnymen duo were writing unaffected, orchestrated, dark, paranoid and romantic songs. Echo and the Bunnymen created their own world for Ocean Rain and in every demo from the Grants (recorded in a Liverpool bedsit, then uploaded on to MySpace), I hear Grant's world.\n\nIn the 80s, Ian McCulloch never minced words; he wanted fame, fortune, and he wrote classic songs and albums to back it up. Grant has absorbed some important lessons from the iconic Bunnyman. All Grant wants to do is write timeless music and the Grants want nothing less than to make their debut album The Greatest Album Ever Made. And they will. Chris Grant is an unstoppable force with his new songs. Nothing will stop the young man. He is even beyond the collapse of capitalism."
