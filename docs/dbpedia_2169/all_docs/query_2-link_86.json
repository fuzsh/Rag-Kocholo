Famous London Bands include The Faces, Fleetwood Mac , Babyshambles, David Bowie, Bush, Deep Purple, Motörhead & Rod Stewart. Lets take a good look at some of our Famous London Musicians!\n\nLondon Bands Musical groups from London-Influential London bands in 60s and 70s:\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nGuitar Lessons London have always loved the Stones! we actually love teaching a lot of there material from Sticky Fingers era Dead Flowers through to the hedonistic Jumping Jack Flash and the rock raunch of Brown Sugar. Led by co-founders and songwriters Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, The Rolling Stones continues to thunder like a dinosaur releasing albums and performing on tours. The band celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, with a greatest hits album and two new tracks. Incredibly well received, The Rolling Stones is one of those bands that still fascinates, thanks in part to the mythos and wild tales that have grown around the band over the years, but also some amazing music. Mick Taylor the stone guitarist in the wary 70's has to be one of the most soulful guitarists of all time.\n\nThe Who\n\nThe ultimate big festival band, The Who rose to prominence in the mid 1960s are a great example of a melodic power rock band. It was the band’s experimental forays that would gain them notoriety, however, with such projects as their rock opera, Tommy. The Who were probably the band that has the most influence on other rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s, from Led Zeppelin to The Clash, as well as later bands of the Brit pop wave in the 90s, such as Blur.\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nVery few bands can claim to have the reach of influence of Led Zeppelin, as nearly every London guitar shop plays host to someone test driving a new instrument to Stairway To Heaven. The hard, blues rock riffs were unlike anything else in the early-70s, making them one of the most enduring British bands for popularity ever. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page who we see regularly on Lonsdale Road the home of London Guitar Academy, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia.\n\nQueen\n\nPompous, pretentious, silly and wonderful, it’s hard not to have real fondness for the overblown antics of Queen. It was perhaps the sad loss of Freddie Mercury in 1991 that reminded people just how many songs had become part of the soundtrack of their lives. Although I had got to the stage where if I heard Bohemian Rhapsody one more time I would have gone postal. Deep Purple Ritchie Blackmore Deep Purple with Legendary guitar great Ritchie Blackmore know for his virtuoso prowess, earth shattering guitar riffs and flamboyant stage persona. Blackmore led the Purple from the front providing us with rock bangers like Smoke on the Water, Black Night, Highway Star & Hush. Later incarnations of Deep Purple featured guitar maestro Tommy Bolin a rock heavyweight in his own right. Check out the rock classic Deep Purple Live in Tokyo to kick start your listening. Ritchie Blackmore was famous for his use of s scalloped neck white Fender Stratocaster powered by an impressive bank of Marshall Amplifiers.\n\nThe Kinks\n\nThe quintessential English band, that’s what everyone says about The Kinks. They’d sing about things like sipping a cup of tea and bonking the vicar’s wife, or about a buxom man-women they met in a seedy Soho coffee shop. All with a wry smile, a cheeky wink, and a fist punched into the crease in their forearm accompanied by a big chorus.\n\nDAVID BOWIE\n\nDavid Bowie (born David Robert Jones, 8 January 1947) is an English singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, arranger, and actor. He is also a painter and collector of fine art.Bowie has been a major figure in the world of popular music for over four decades, and is renowned as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He is known for his distinctive voice as well as the intellectual depth and eclecticism of his work. Aside from his musical abilities, he is recognised for his androgynous beauty, which was an iconic element to his image, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s\n\nThe Sex Pistols\n\nThe ultimate British punk band, The Sex Pistols epitomised the angst and frustrations of the UK’s disenfranchised youth. The effect the band had on the musical landscape of Britain in the late 70s, particularly in the summer of 1977, was like a force of nature. The successes centred around the release of ‘God Save The Queen’ at the time of Queen Elizabeth’s Silver Jubilee. The Clash were an English punk rock band that formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk. Along with punk, their music incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, and rockabilly. For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky “Topper” Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones’ departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.\n\nPaul Weller & The Jam\n\nThe Jam appeared like a thunderbolt from the British new wave scene. Sharp suits tales of everyday life powered by Rickenbackers and British Vox amplifiers. A powerhouse of three, their raw energy coupled with angst ridden, sometimes politically fuelled lyrics, cut through and rise above other bands of their generation. Heavily influenced by the Kinks and the Who the Jam led s generation through there teenage years. Suggested listing includes Eaton rifles Going Underground , Beat Surrender & English Rose.

The band formed when Alex James met longtime friends guitarist Graham Coxon and Damon Albarn at Goldsmith’s College, London. It was the single Parklife that gave the band its first big smash, followed by Girls & Boys, reflecting the very Britishness of the group. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDswiT87oo8\n\nColdplay\n\nColdplay is perhaps one of the most successful British bands in recent years.
