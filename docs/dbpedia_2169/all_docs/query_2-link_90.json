        "text": "Some of the best and most famous 1920s Musicians, others are sometimes forgotten in the tombs of jazz history\n\nWilly \"The Lion\" Smith:\n\nFrom \"rent parties\" to Harlem's nightclubs Willy \"the Lion\" Smith represented himself and his craft with precision and aggression, always battling for position as one of the great jazz pianists of the 1920s\n\n\"The Footsteps of a Legend\" Jelly Roll Morton\n\nHe went as far as to deny his African-American heritage, calling himself \"Creole\" instead. But, Morton also had the musical chops to back up his bragging.\n\nThe period he spent in Chicago from 1923 to 1926 were the most productive and fruitful years of his career. During this time he founded and led the \"Red Hot Peppers\" and began referring to himself as \"the world's greatest hot tune writer.\"\n\nKing Oliver\n\nBut it's been said that at the time without Oliver's band, at that specific point in music history, that Armstrong may have never risen to the heights that he achieved.\n\nHe wouldn't have been able to stand out as a great 1920s musician if there were many soloists in the band. Because he stood at the front and center of King Oliver's New Orleans Jazz Band, Armstrong both helped make the band a huge success and hastened it's demise.\n\nLouis Armstrong\n\nSidney Bechet\n\nEddie Lang\n\nJack Teagarden\n\nHe traveled frequently between New Orleans, New York and Chicago. During this time he recorded many famous tracks with people like Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman.\n\nBix Beiderbecke\n\nBeiderbecke's first band, \"The Wolverines\" took their inspiration from the New Orleans jazz style. Bix's music at the time only hinted at his overall genius with a trumpet in his hand.\n\nSimple solos marked the haunting style and tone that would later make his horn so famous. Beiderbecke's career and life was cut short by his desire for booze and fast lifestyle. He left a lasting legacy in the world of jazz and makes many wonder what could have been had his career been longer.\n\nDuke Ellington\n\nThe 1920s were good to Ellington, he made a name for himself with his talent, ear for harmony, and tireless work ethic.\n\nHe defined a unique sound during these formative years. While he has often been accused of not being the most original of the 1920s musicians, Ellington's work is without peer in his ability to create harmonious teams of musicians, and his ability to frame the individual's strengths and hide their weaknesses within his bands.\n\nFletcher Henderson"
