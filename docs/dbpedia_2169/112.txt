Unsigned Only Music Competition is a unique platform, offering emerging artists an unparalled opportunity to showcase their talent on an international stage. What sets this competition apart is its exclusive focus on unsigned artists, providing a level playing field for all artists who have not secured a major label record deal. This means that entrants are not competing against well-known musicians, Grammy winners, or artists with a major label machine behind them. Unsigned Only's mission is to give unsigned artists exposure, recognition, and validation for their artistry â€“ and to help them to further their goals musically.

Unsigned Only gives away $150,000 in cash and prizes, including a Grand Prize of $20,000 USD. Prizes are also awarded to First and Second Place winners in each category.

Judges include influential, high-profile recording artists and music industry professionals. This is a great opportunity for artists to have their music heard by iconic artists and seasoned professionals who share a passion for discovering and supporting independent artists. Their involvement in the competition reflects Unsigned Only's committment to fostering emerging and diverse talent from all over the world.
