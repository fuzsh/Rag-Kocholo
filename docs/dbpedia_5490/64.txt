SPOKANE, Wash. â€“ The Whitworth University Department of Athletics has recognized four outstanding and inspirational student-athletes with the school's year-end special awards. Swimming All-American Ryan Grady is the 2022 Dennis Spurlock Award winner, while men's basketball player Jordan Lester claims the Aaron Leetch Inspiration award. Softball's Maddy Thomas is the 2022 Senior Female Athlete of the Year, while baseball outfielder Jaxsen Sweum is the Senior Male Athlete of the Year.

The Whitworth athletics department voted on the 2021-22 awards last week.

The Dennis Spurlock Award is named in memory of the former Pirate All-America quarterback (1958-61). The award was established to honor Whitworth student-athletes who model the characteristics of the award's namesake, specifically modesty, poise, and leadership in addition to excellence in athletics performance, drawing respect for the school, the team, and the individual.

Grady rewrote much of the Whitworth swimming record book in his final year as a Pirate. He set four individual school records, including two Northwest Conference marks, and was also part of three Whitworth relay records. Grady concluded his career at the 2022 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championships, where he finished fourth in the 200-yard breaststroke, ninth in the 200-yard individual medley and 11th in the 100-yard breaststroke. The 800-yard freestyle relay finished 13th. Grady was the NWC's Co-Men's Swimmer of the Meet at the 2022 championships in Federal Way after he won the 200 I.M., 100 breaststroke and 200 breaststroke. He now holds Whitworth's school records in the 200-yard freestyle, 500-yard freestyle, 200 breaststroke and 200 I.M. He also is part of Pirate records in the 200-yard freestyle relay, 400-yard freestyle relay and 800-yard freestyle relay. Two of the records he broke were held by former NCAA Division III champions and Whitworth Heritage Gallery Hall of Fame members. The 500 free record was set by Kevin Wang in 2003. The 200 breaststroke record was set by Rory Buck in 2013.

The Aaron Leetch Inspiration Award was created in 2015 to honor the memory of the former Whitworth Director of Athletics who perished in a plane crash in April of that year. It recognizes a Pirate student-athlete who embodies inspiration, passion, perseverance and dedication to his or her sport.

Lester was part of the Whitworth men's basketball program for five seasons (2017-18 through 2021-22) after transferring from the University of Robert Morris. Yet he was only able to play one full season (2018-19) because each of his other four seasons ended early, or never happened, due to injury. He started all 50 games for which he was healthy at Whitworth and averaged 12.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists. Yet his impact on the team always continued after the injuries. Lester would attend practices and games to encourage his teammates. He was there in 2022 to help cut down the nets when the Pirates claimed the NWC tournament title. Lester earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Whitworth while retaining his eligibility through those five seasons.

The Whitworth Senior Athlete of the Year award recognizes outstanding athletic achievement during a student's final year of eligibility and culminates an accomplished career as a Pirate.

Thomas battled through a severe hip injury in 2022 to play designated hitter, instead of her usual position at catcher. She batted .294 and led the team with 10 home runs and 41 RBIs and led the conference in walks (27), earning honorable mention All-NWC. She ended her career as Whitworth's all-time leader in home runs (39) and slugging average (.725).

Sweum led the Pirates in batting average (.314), home runs (12), doubles (12), RBIs (27) and runs scored (31) this season. He also led in slugging average (.720) and in walks (23). Sweum ranked second in the NWC in slugging average, second in on-base plus slugging (1.170) and was third in home runs, earning first team All-Conference recognition. He played in 35 of the team's 38 games.

Members of the Whitworth athletics department voted for these student-athletes from among a strong class of Pirate seniors in 2021. All four will be recognized and presented with their awards Whitworth's Athletics Celebration next week and during graduation weekend ceremonies.
