        "text": "A study of 215 athletes at a small private liberal arts Division III college revealed that athletes (a) begin their college experience with SATs no different from non-athletes; (b) attain GPAs that do not significantly differ from those of nonathletes; (c) achieve GPAs that do not significantly differ between their “in-season” semester and their “off-season” semester, and (d) perceive their GPA as important to their college and future success. These results indicate that Division III athletes are a valuable and important group of students who exhibit “sustainable” behavior as part of their college experience. The sustainability and growth of Division III institutions can rely on the recruitment of athletes to increase student numbers and revenue while maintaining the prestige and mission of the school. The topics of academic performance and perceptions of athletes about GPA are areas that have been investigated by many researchers in Division III sports programs throughout the Unite...\n\nObjective. The relationship between academic achievement, especially grade point average (GPA), and college athletics is often focused on \"big-time\" (National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I (NCAA DI)) colleges. This study examines athletic and academic identity correlates with student-athlete (SA) GPA for not only DI but also DII and DIII SAs, separately by sex. Methods. The GPAs of over 19,000 SAs across divisions are analyzed using OLS with covariates including athletic and academic indicators. The analysis pools SAs, separates by division, and separates by division and sex. Additional analyses were conducted for the revenue-producing sports. Results. SAs' GPA is directly influenced by their athletic versus academic identity, the athletic context including the coach's influence, and the seriousness with which they view academics. Cross-equation joint testing found no statistical differences in athletic or academic identity across division and sex. Conclusions. Two beliefs are widely presumed: that DI SAs' focus on athletics more than SAs in the \"less competitive\" divisions leads them to worse academic outcomes, and that the athletic identity of male SAs has a greater impact on academic performance than female SAs. Our results provide no evidence for either presumption. The relationship between collegiate athletics and academic achievement has been a source of persistent discussion for years. Throughout most of this research, however, the focus has been on the high-profile (revenue-producing) sports of football and basketball in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I (DI). Published research focusing on academics and athletics across the other two divisions-by themselves and in comparison to DI-as well as comparisons with the non-revenue-producing sports is very underdeveloped. In addition to this line of work, but also very much related, is the relationship between gender and academic performance. Much of the academic literature regarding women in collegiate sports tends to focus on issues germane to Title IX (Anderson, Cheslock, and Ehrenberg, 2006), as well as specific issues such as self-esteem, disordered eating (Johnson et al., 2004), and gender role orientation (Harrison and Lynch, 2005). Missing from this line of work is a consideration of more academic and sport-related factors that may influence academic performance."
