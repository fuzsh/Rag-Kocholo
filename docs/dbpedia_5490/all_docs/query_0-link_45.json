        "text": "NNU Athletics\n\nWomen's Track & Field 4/6/2022 11:10:00 AM William McLaughlin\n\nEastern Heads to Spokane for Whitworth Peace Meet\n\nLA GRANDE, Ore. – Mountaineers Track & Field is ready to go once again for another weekend of meet action. Eastern Oregon heads north to Spokane, Washington for a one-day meet hosted by NCAA Division III institute Whitworth University.\n\nMEET INFORMATION\n\nWhitworth Peace Meet\n\nWhitworth University Hosts\n\nBoppell Track at Whitworth Pine Bowl\n\nSpokane, Wash.\n\nFriday, April 8\n\nField Events: 12 p.m.\n\nTrack Events: 1:20 p.m.\n\nAbout the Meet\n\n• The Whitworth Peace Meet will be a one-day event that is also the first ever for Whitworth. This meet comes as an addition with the annual Buc Scoring Invite and Whitworth Twilight.\n\n• This meet originally was called the WAR Invite and was hosted by the Community Colleges of Spokane but was rebranded this year as the Peace Meet.\n\n• There will be no prelims for any event on the track. Majority of the field events will feature flights, with the top eight advancing to finals.\n\n• The schedule will be a running schedule for the entire day. Events will have women competing first followed by men, unless otherwise noted on the meet schedule sheet.\n\n• The Peace Meet will also be scored one. Dual meet scoring will be used with the 5-3-1 point format.\n\n• There will not be a livestream for the one-day meet in Spokane, but live results will be available. Live results will be available at www.AthleticTiming.net or by clicking the respective link above.\n\nLast Time Out - NNU Invite & Multi's\n\n• Eastern Oregon had a solid showing in its first outdoor meet for the month of April. The Mounties tallied six event winners over the two-day span.\n\n• Day one meet action, saw EOU pick up two wins. On the track, freshman Justin Ash won the 10,000-meter run, while in the field Moses McAninch won the javelin … Read more.\n\n• On the second day, Eastern picked up four more wins and had multiple top-10 finishes. On the women's side Maggie Ledbetter led the way winning the shot put and discus.\n\n• On the men's side, day two belonged to TJ Davis and Darrian Walker. Davis won the decathlon scoring an NAIA leading 6,949 points, while Walker won the pole vault clearing 15-7 … Read more.\n\nCCC Athlete of the Week\n\n• With his dominant performance in the decathlon, TJ Davis was named the CCC WVT Laboratory Men's Field Athlete of the Week.\n\n• Davis racked up 6,949 points in the win and quickly established himself as the NAIA leader in the decathlon. He won six of the 10 events and blew out second place by over 500 points.\n\nNAIA A & B Standard Performances\n\n• Entering the Weekend, Eastern has seven athletes that have hit an NAIA A or B standard mark for the 2022 Outdoor National Championships.\n\n• Leading the way in TJ Davis in the decathlon with 6,949 points. In the same event, Judson Mansfield currently ranks fourth with 6,041 points. Davis also ranks 14th in the 110-meter hurdles with a B standard time of 14.68.\n\n• Hitting an A standard mark is Darrian Walker in the pole vault. He cleared 15-9 ¼ back in mid-March and has auto-qualified for Outdoor Nationals.\n\n• On the women's side, Maggie Ledbetter is currently seventh in the shot put with a B standard mark of 44-5 ¼. She ranks 13th in the hammer throw with a B mark of 160-3.\n\n• Morgan Bayes currently sits 14th in the NAIA in the 400-meter hurdles. The junior has a B standard time of 64.47, which she ran last weekend.\n\n• In the javelin, Moses McAninch is currently ranked 20th in the NAIA. He has a B standard mark of 180-6 that he threw back in mid-March.\n\nRewriting the Record Books\n\n• Last weekend, EOU had multiple changes within the top-10 of the outdoor record book. In all, four Mounties entered or moved up in the all-time top-10.\n\n• Highlighting the efforts was TJ Davis. His 6,949 points is now second best all-time in EOU outdoor history.\n\n• Katie Brown now ranks seventh all-time in the 100-meter dash. She clocked a time of 12.45 at the NNU Invite and placed third.\n\n• Morgan Bayes moves up to No. 7 in the 400-meter hurdles list. She ran a 64.47 and her time is top-25 in the NAIA currently.\n\n• Tanner Nett entered the all-time top-10 in the shot put. The freshman heaved the rock 49-9 ¼ last weekend to rank ninth in EOU outdoor history.\n\nWhat to Watch For This Weekend\n\n• With the Cascade Collegiate Conference Championships just over a month away, look for EOU to continue adding more qualifiers across multiple events.\n\n• Entering the weekend, EOU currently has 80 individual event qualifiers for the CCC Championships. Leading the way in the women's pole vault and hammer throw with six, respectively.\n\n• The second most entries is the men's 5,000-meter run, shot put, discus, and pole vault with four each.\n\n• Nationally, the Mountaineers are still looking to hit NAIA qualifying times in both the short sprints and distance events. Expect both areas to feature multiple Mounties this weekend.\n\n• In the field events, eastern still has yet to hit a qualifying mark in the jumps. Both Allexander Kosel and Tyler Jones will look to hit qualifying marks this weekend.\n\n• Outside of Maggie Ledbetter and Moses McAninch's marks, the throws group will all hope to add more qualifiers this weekend.\n\n• With the Whitworth Peace Meet being a one-day meet, the Mounties will likely load up athletes across multiple events. EOU is still needing to qualify a relay team for the CCC Championships, with a chance to do so this weekend.\n\nUp Next\n\n• Following the Whitworth Peace Meet, EOU will head back to Portland next weekend to compete at Lewis & Clark College once again. They will compete at the Lewis & Clark Invite, which will take place Saturday, April 16.\n\nFOLLOW EOU ATHLETICS\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
