        "text": "--Courtesy of CMS Athletics--\n\nSenior guard Josh Angle earned the Region X Player of the Year Award from both the National Association of Basketball Coaches and D3hoops.com on Tuesday, and was one of 20 players selected to the 2024 NABC Reese's Division III College All-Star Game to be held Saturday, March 16 at 12:30 p.m. ET at Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Ind.\n\nBy earning the Region X Player of the Year, Angle is now one of ten finalists for the NABC National Player of the Year Award, which will be announced on Thursday.\n\nAngle averaged 19.4 points, 4.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 2023-24, nd led CMS to its deepest NCAA Tournament run in program history, advancing the sectionals at Hampden-Sydney with a regional championship. The Stags defeated St. Thomas (Texas) and Whitworth in a regional held at Cal Lutheran, with Angle scoring 30 points in the St. Thomas win and 21 against Whitworth.\n\nDuring the regular season, Angle was named the SCIAC Athlete of the Year, and then went on to earn the Most Outstanding Player of the SCIAC Postseason Championship, leading the Stags to narrow wins over Pomona-Pitzer and Cal Lutheran. He had 18 of his 20 points in the second half of the Pomona-Pitzer win, helping CMS to a 74-71 comeback win.\n\nIn that contest, Angle also became the all-time leading three-point shooter in program history, making his 223rd career three-pointer in the second half to break the old record of 222 held by Bob Donlan (1998-2002). He finished his career with 237 threes, and as a 50-40-80 shooter, with career percentages of 50.5 percent from the floor, 41.7 percent from three, and 83.2 percent from the line.\n\nAngle also finished his career with 1647 points, despite only scoring 91 as a first-year when he came off the bench. His total ranks No. 3 in CMS history, behind only Chris Greene (1757) and Todd Thomas (1700).\n\nFollow the SCIAC on Threads (@theSCIAC), X - formerly Twitter (@theSCIAC) and Instagram (@thesciac) with hashtags #SCIACtion and #SoCalSoGood.

Rosters include representation from each Division III region. Former Wooster coach Steve Moore and former Marymount and Frostburg State coach Webb Hatch will serve as coaches for the two Division III All-Star teams."
