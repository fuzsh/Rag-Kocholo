        "text": "WASHINGTON STATE WILL be entering fall camp with a mostly clean bill of health. Jake Dickert met with the media via Zoom on the eve of fall camp on Tuesday and provided an update on running back Leo Pulalasi who was injured in the spring game, and right tackle Fa'alili Fa'amoe who missed all of the spring after offseason surgery.\n\n\"Leo's full go,\" Dickert said. \"He'll be full day one, doing everything. Fa'alili will be a progression. And game one is still the target, but it will be a little bit of a moving target. We will not put Fa'alili on the field until he is 100 percent healthy.\n\n\"He gets more confident in his knee every day. The rehab process is going phenomenal but remember he only had that a little bit before the new year. So we're just getting into the eighth month ... hopefully you see him out there sometime during week two.\"\n\nFa'amoe was named to the Outland Trophy watchlist on Tuesday.\n\nDickert also noted that wide receiver Kyle Maxwell is still working back from a spring injury and that linebacker Tristan Bohannon has medically retired after a second torn ACL.\n\nPULALASI WILL RE-ENTER a fiery running back competition, a four-horse race between himself, Dylan Paine, Wayshawn Parker, and Djouvensky Schlenbaker, with all four presenting strong cases to be named the starter.\n\n\"We have four guys that are really capable and we have four different blended skill sets,\" Dickert said. \"I think Djouvensky Schlenbaker is in the best shape of his life. His leadership skills have really kind of risen to the occasion in that room.\n\n\"But Leo is as crafty as it gets. He's fully recovered off of the injury and he's ready to roll. Wayshawn Parker, everything we give him, he answers the bell and does it to a really high degree. DP is that stalwart. He's gonna get a real opportunity to be the starting tailback here at Washington State.\"\n\nWSU will also be down a freshman defensive tackle but while the Cougars do not have a ton of bodies, Dickert believes in the group led by David Gusta, Ansel Din-Mbuh and Khalil Laufau.\n\n\"We've never been this explosive,\" Dickert said. \"The top three guys, David, Ansel, and Khalil, we've never been this athletic at the interior defensive line in my five years here. We're phenomenal there. And then the next guys really have to shine. Whether it's Rashad McKenzie, he's coming off two knee surgeries. Bryson Lamb has worked his tail off as a walk-on.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Hyrum Benjamin-Moors came here with a shoulder injury that we caught in an early kind of screening, so he won't be out there. (And we have) Jackson Cowgill. So a couple of these guys really have to rise to the occasion.\"\n\nDickert also said one Coug will move back and forth between EDGE and DT.\n\n\"The other thing that you will see is Andrew Edson bouncing back and forth. He's a bulldog, he's a pit bull, he's physical, he knows how to play with leverage. You'll see him do a little bit of both, and don't be surprised if he's taking 15 to 20 snaps in the interior defense line this year.\"\n\nRelated: Key things to know as WSU fall camp begins Wednesday\n\nTHERE WILL BE three veterans at fall camp not with the team in the spring. Austin Lawrence, Jerrae Williams and Wesley Steiner all transferred in after spring ball, with Lawrence coming as an offensive lineman from Northern Colorado, Williams as a defensive back from UNLV and Steiner as a linebacker from Auburn. Here is what Dickert said on all three.\n\nLawrence: \"Austin's from Puyallup, so he's a Washington kid. He understands our program, played at Northern Colorado last year, so he obviously played a game here and knows us. So he'll be a guard to start and offensive line needs to take a huge step forward this year. We have the pieces to do it, we have the talent to do it, and now we feel like we have the competitive depth to do it.\"\n\nSteiner: \"Wes will be at the MIKE position and Wes has proven throughout this summer to be one of the freakiest athletes I've ever seen. He power cleaned from the floor 405 pounds. It's just incredible Coach Ben has never seen it. He's fast, he's agile and I'm excited to see it translate on the field.\"\n\nWilliams: \"Jerrae will be at the nickel cover position since we moved Jackson to strong safety. He gives us a ton of depth there. His skill sets are physical, fast and aggressive. He'll be that big body nickel to compliment Kapena there.\"\n\nWSU ALSO ANNOUNCED some changes in coaching titles on Monday. Justin Kramer has been elevated to assistant offensive line coach, John Kuceyeski to quarterbacks' assistant coach, Justin Mesa to assistant special teams and tight ends coach, and Calin Criner to assistant secondary coach.\n\n\"The biggest thing is the NCAA changed the rules that now the quality controls are allowed to coach,\" Dickert said. \"All those guys that were in support roles that weren't allowed to do anything on the field, I couldn't meet with them, they weren't allowed to be on the headset. So all those guys we've given them an opportunity in an assistant realm.\"\n\nAs the special teams assistant to Nick Whitworth, part of Mesa's responsibilities will include overseeing the return battle. The Cougars are looking to hone in on one or two players to return punts and kickoffs, with a few different possibilities.\n\n\"It will be a big fall camp for that as well,\" Dickert said. \"We got to put those guys in a couple of live situations to see how it pans out. But Tony Freeman, I think we're going to take a big step forward in that direction. Kris Hutson, Jaylon Edmond, Carlos Hernandez, those would be some guys to really watch in the punt return game.\n\n\"Obviously, Leyton (Smithson) coming back in the kick return (game). Chris Barnes is a freshman, a 10.2 (100-meter) kid out of Texas. I believe he possesses those skill sets. Brandon Hills too.\"\n\nAS FOR OVERALL DEPTH, Dickert said the EDGE spot at WSU may be its deepest -- even with Brennan Jackson and Ron Stone Jr. graduating."
