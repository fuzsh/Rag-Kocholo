        "text": "üèê‚ú® Celebrating Hard Work and Dedication: Lessons from the Volleyball Court ‚ú®üèê This past weekend was nothing short of extraordinary as my daughter's volleyball team soared to new heights at a thrilling 3-day tournament in St. Louis, Missouri. MEQs in case you were also there. üòÉ I am elated to share that they finished an impressive 7-2, a testament to their unwavering commitment and sheer determination. As a parent, witnessing the evolution of this team has been nothing short of remarkable. But this weekend was different. It was as if every player had tapped into an unseen reservoir of heart and teamwork, propelling them to victory with a sense of unity that left me in awe. The journey of club volleyball is undeniably a roller coaster of emotions, a sentiment shared by many parents and players alike. Yet, amidst the highs and lows, there lies a profound lesson in perseverance and camaraderie. Much like in our professional careers, success on the volleyball court is not merely the result of talent, but rather a culmination of hard work, dedication, and effective leadership. I am immensely grateful for our coach, who not only understands when to push the team beyond their limits but also possesses the foresight to strategically place each player in positions where they can excel. This weekend's triumph serves as a poignant reminder that when passion meets purpose and when individuals come together as a cohesive unit, there are #NoLimits as to what can be achieved. As parents, we are not only witnessing our children grow as athletes but also as resilient, tenacious individuals prepared to tackle any challenge that comes their way. Here's to the invaluable lessons learned on the volleyball court, lessons that undoubtedly extend far beyond the boundaries of the game. And here's to the unwavering dedication of our children, the lessons we learn from them, and whose spirit and determination continue to inspire us all. #Volleyball #Teamwork #Leadership #Dedication #Parenting #AthleteDevelopment #LifeLessons #CareerJourney #Opportunity #Inspiration\n\nCase Study: 36 Lacrosse: Leveraging the Kolbe Index to Strengthen Family Dynamics Background: 36 Lacrosse is a family business specializing in youth lacrosse development, training, and teams (View their website HERE - https://buff.ly/4bmVXGd ).

It has big audiences and the highest level of lacrosse. Most professional and Canadian and US internationals played in the NCAA Division 1 but it does not go further than amateur collegiate sport. Premier League Lacrosse (PLL), the professional field lacrosse league in the US, operates as a touring model. It has built a set of new teams without any connection to the NCAA lacrosse teams. Major League Lacrosse which merged with PLL under the same name, had teams based in cities but not connected to the NCAA lacrosse teams. From where I am standing the best option is to create professional lacrosse teams connected to the NCAA lacrosse teams. Duke University could have a professional team called \"The Dukes\", Syracuse could be \"The Cuse\", Notre Dame could be \"The Dames\", John Hopkins could be \"Hopkins\". In this way the passion and support that collegiate lacrosse teams have could be transferred over to the professional arena. Supporters would watch players develop out of the amateur collegiate teams into the local pro teams located in university towns. Collegiate teams in the NCAA Division 1 league, as well as in Division 2 and 3 have built in audiences. Fans could carry on supporting the same players at the professional level, they could wear the same colours as they do at the collegiate level. There would be new players able to enter the professional ranks every year. There is no point in starting from scratch, the professional teams built out of the NCAA lacrosse teams could provide funding for more high-performance development at the collegiate level, which would in turn produce players for the pro-league. Universities are businesses. Forming pro-lacrosse teams out of the existing brands that make up collegiate teams but with a modern twist is the only way to create a viable professional field lacrosse league in the US. The lacrosse infrastructure is committed to amateur sport but players that train hard to develop their skills and make big wins for university, giving them kudos, need a place to use their skills after honing them to the highest level over 3 years or more. Collegiate lacrosse players are like war veterans. They develop their skills and bodies for lacrosse but once they have finished university, they cannot find a place to be employed with their skills. NCAA collegiate team administrators have to acknowledge the physical demands of playing lacrosse and the effort it takes to be good and help to provide economic opportunities in the sport, post-collegiate, for those that offered blood, sweat and tears by licensing the brands to pro-lacrosse and supporting the localised pro-teams that adopt aspects of their brands.\n\nFrom the college basketball coach who won more championships than any other in history...so far... How many times do we distort our perception of success based on the home runs vs. the base hits we have? So often we discount the little things we do in life because they aren't flashy or headline-making, and by such measures we consider ourselves unsuccessful, when in reality, the little things compound to make big things happen. What if we celebrated our little wins every day? (And we all have them...). What would shift in our self-belief and in what we are capable of then? Little things matter. What we tell ourselves matters. Doing little things enables us to do big things too. Oh, and the base hits vs. home runs question? From 2001 through the 2020 season, there were 12 TIMES AS MANY BASE HITS as home runs...I'll bet those athletes have a different point of view of THEIR success... Food for thought! #littlethings #consistencycompounds #celebratethewins #perspective #coaching #ddtc #ciysp"
