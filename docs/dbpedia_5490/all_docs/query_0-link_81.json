        "text": "B.A. in Health Science, Pre-Occupational Therapy\n\nThe B.A. in health science, pre-occupational therapy is designed to prepare students for careers in health sciences, as well as provide some students direct entry into the Doctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD) graduate program at Whitworth. This major is designed to be part of a 3 + 3 program when combined with Whitworth’s Doctor of Occupational Therapy program. All undergraduate degree requirements for a bachelor’s degree will still apply. Students will complete all Shared Curriculum requirements in the first three years, before beginning OT coursework in their fourth year. Courses taken in the fourth year will count toward existing undergraduate requirements of 126 total credits and 36 upper division credits. Students apply in year three and, if accepted, will start the graduate degree program in year four, but will still be considered undergraduate students until the bachelor’s degree is posted after year four. Credits taken cannot count towards two degrees at the same time. Credits taken as an undergraduate student go on the undergraduate transcript and GPA. Students in the Pre-OT major will not receive the B.A. in Health Science until successfully completing the fourth year of study.\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe mission of the entry-level Doctorate in Occupational Therapy at Whitworth University provides innovative, creative, holistic and interprofessional mind-and-heart education to develop and empower ethically competent and transformational leaders in occupational therapy and healthcare. Guided by and committed to faith integration, reciprocal therapeutic relationships and an understanding of the potency of daily life activities, the program prepares practice scholars who use best scientific evidence to be catalysts for change, advocates for occupational justice and servants of humanity.\n\nRequirements for B.A. in Health Science, Pre-Occupational Therapy (45)\n\nOther courses outside the major, taken as electives or to fulfill shared curriculum requirements, but required to be completed before admittance into the OTD program include (15 credits):"
