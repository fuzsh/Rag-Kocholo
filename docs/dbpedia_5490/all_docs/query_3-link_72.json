        "text": "DETROIT LAKES — The Pine to Palm Golf Tournament saw clear skies and sunshine as the second day of qualifiers began on Tuesday, Aug. 6.\n\nDetroit Country Club was filled with golfers from the Mid-Am division fighting for their spot in match play beginning on Thursday and Championship division competitors out on the links for the first time this week.\n\nThe Mid-Am medalist crown came down to the wire as Fargo’s Jeffrey Bernstrom held a one-stroke lead over Detroit Lakes’ Jason Justesen and Prior Lake’s James Ford. The trio were paired with 2023 Mid-Am champion Joe Schnorak who hit the course for his practice round.\n\nBernstrom made a massive putt on the 18th final hole to save par and secure his first-ever Mid-Am medalist trophy. He ended the two rounds with a final score of 144 and closed out Day 2 with a 1-over par 72.\n\n“The start was a little slow, but my driver started to get going and put it well,” Bernstrom said about what worked for him today. “So I just tried to stay out of the trouble and hit those big numbers.”\n\nBut Bernstrom was just playing golf until someone got into his ear and had him check the scoreboard as he approached the final few holes of the round.\n\n“I think it was around 15 or 1,” Bernstrom said. “I had my friend Dan helping me as my caddy. He goes, ‘Do you want to know?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I better see where I'm at.’ It was about then I think I was up one.”\n\nFord and Justesen were tied for first after the first day. They each returned to the clubhouse shooting a 3-over par 74 and tied for second in the Mid-Am qualifiers. Rochert, Minnesota’s Matt Bekkerus had the fourth-best total score at 146. Hawley’s Ted Cox and Moorhead’s Erik Wiess ended with the fifth-best scores at 149.\n\nBernstrom was the 2022 Mid-Am runner-up and was excited to add a medalist title to his Pine to Palm collection. He also sees winning the qualifiers as a great setup for Thursday’s match play.\n\n“It gives me some confidence come Thursday,” Bernstrom said.\n\nThe Mid-Am division took the lowest 16 scores and paired them in the Championship Flight and the next eight and paired them in the Floyd Flight.\n\nChampionship division shrinks, Detroit Lakes boys golf tests talents\n\nOver 190 Championship division golfers hit the course on Tuesday with hopes of extending their time at Pine to Palm another day. The division was shrunk to the lowest 132-lowest scores including ties when the rounds were concluded.\n\nFargo’s Jake Skarperud is the Day 1 leader shooting an 8-under par 63. Maple Grove’s Lucas Feterl and Moorhead’s Ian Simonich were the following two lowest scores at 6-under par 65. Moorhead’s Nick Olsgaard and Roseau’s Teagan LaPlante trailed with fourth fourth-lowest scores of the day shooting 67s.\n\n2023 Pine to Palm runner-up and Minnesota’s Class AAA champion Edina’s Torger Ohe ended his first round tied for 12th with a 2-under par 69. Minnesota’s Class AA champion Hawley’s Jack Justesen finished the day even par.\n\nDetroit Lakes boys golf fans were treated to many of their favorite golfers testing their talents in the coveted event. The Class AA runner-ups had some ups and downs on the first day of qualifiers. Senior Tommy Suckert (4-over par 75) and juniors Carter Whitworth (6-over par 77) and Lawsen Justesen (2-over par 73) made the cut.\n\nFormer Laker Nick Tobkin (7-over par 78), seniors Owen Chiodo (13-over par 84) and Tyler Stensgard (7-over par 78) and junior Brock Burhans (9-over par 80) missed the cut.\n\nThe Detroit Lakes boys golf take over at Pine to Palm wasn’t planned.\n\n“We all signed up on our own accord, but we all really look forward to this tournament to represent DL and be a team out there and just go try and shoot our best scores,” Whitworth said.\n\nThe summer is all about hitting bombs with friends while enjoying the weather before the cold months roll in. Whitworth has been trying to dial it in this summer. Despite not having played in many tournaments, he was most excited to play in the Pine to Palm. And its competitions just like this that his coaches encourage him and his counterparts to participate in.\n\n“They (Whitworth’s coaches) really look forward to having us play in this,” Whitworth said. “They think we can really compete and play against some of the best golfers in the States.”\n\nThe Lakers are coming off their program’s fourth second-place finish at the Class AA state tournament. Whitworth loved seeing his boys out on the course playing some of the toughest competition they’ve had to face at a tournament like Pine to Palm.\n\n“It makes me excited just to see the team working together to try and beat some of the good older guys,” Whitworth said. “It's just fun to go out there and play your hardest.”\n\nThe Championship division cut the field to the lowest 132 scores including ties. The final qualifying round will tee off at 7:05 a.m."
