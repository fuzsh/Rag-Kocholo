        "text": "RV Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Colleges have reached the first Sweet 16 in program history with a 69-67 victory over NCAA Tournament regular Whitworth University in the first-ever Southern California four-team regional pod.\n\nThe Stags maintained a late lead after a back-and-forth affair in which each team led by 10 points, with Will King and others hitting clutch free throws down the stretch to stay in front. Multiple second-chance efforts for the Pirates failed to drop in the final seconds as CMS kept a six-game winning streak intact through the beginning of March.\n\nJust over 24 hours following a superb shooting performance in the opening round win over University of St. Thomas (Texas), the Stags had to find a different way to win on a night they hit only three of 17 triples, with just 12 assists on 26 baskets. Winning the turnover battle (6-11) proved key, as did a significant free throw edge (14-18 vs. 7-17). King stepped up with his first double-digit scoring performance since Dec. 30, 2023 as he shot 5-for-6 from the floor and was a perfect 5-5 at the line for 15 points. Josh Angle added 21 while hitting 50 percent of his shots, while the backcourt duo each recorded a pair of steals as well.\n\nWhitworth's Sullivan Menard single-handedly kept the Pirates in range throughout the game as he went off for a game-high 27 points (9-17 FG, 5-12 3FG).\n\nCMS will face d3hoops.com No. 19 Nebraska Wesleyan University, which defeated both Centenary (La.) and UT-Dallas by double digits, likely in Virginia next weekend.\n\nFollow the SCIAC on Threads (@theSCIAC), X - formerly Twitter (@theSCIAC) and Instagram (@thesciac) with hashtags #SCIACtion and #SoCalSoGood.
