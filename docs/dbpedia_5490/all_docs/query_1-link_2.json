        "text": "If you are the parent of a serious student-athlete, then chances are you’re becoming familiar with the scholarship policies of schools at various levels of competition.\n\nDivision 1 schools offer the most scholarship money, but also put the highest demands on student time, and are incredibly competitive. Meanwhile, you may have heard that there are no Division 3 (D3) athletic scholarships.\n\nThat’s not exactly true.\n\nWhat is a more accurate statement is that there are no Division 3 athletic scholarships that are administered by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which provides funding for scholarships at other levels.\n\nInstead, student-athletes who are interested in playing sports at a Division 3 school will often find that there are considerable Division 3 scholarships available, just from other sources.\n\nDo Division 3 Schools Give Athletic Scholarships?\n\nDivision 3 colleges do not provide athletic scholarships per se, but instead provide scholarships based on need and merit, like most other universities.\n\nThat means that parents, with students interested in pursuing a Division 3 athletic career, should familiarize themselves with how merit-based and need-based aid work.\n\nThat does not mean that athletics counts for nothing. Some of the best ways to demonstrate leadership experience, gain an appreciation for community service, and generally prove that your child has all the “soft” factors that make a great admit is through sports.\n\nAs extracurricular activities count towards consideration for D3 merit scholarships for athletes, admissions committees are always happy to see someone who is willing to play ball, literally.\n\nWhat Can D3 Schools Offer Athletes?\n\nDon’t think that your child will somehow be cheated out of a student-athlete experience by going to a D3 school; nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nIn fact, due to shorter seasons, they will likely be able to enjoy a more balanced time while pursuing their degree.\n\nAfter all, many Division 3 schools are academic powerhouses; while the Ivy League is a Division 1 conference (but one that treats scholarships like a D3 school), the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), has some of the top colleges in the country and is firmly a D3 conference.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that competition is anything other than fierce. Some of the most heated rivalries in college sports exist between Division 3 schools.\n\nWhile Amherst—Williams may not get the media coverage of Michigan—Ohio State or Auburn—Alabama, you can bet that students and alumni take the games very seriously.\n\nFinally, Division 3 schools try to put the student first. At schools with NCAA athletic scholarships, a student must continue to play for the scholarship to be valid.\n\nDivision 3 admits have no such requirement; if after a season or two continued involvement is not in the student’s interest, there is no financial consequence for your child walking away from a sport.\n\nHow Do D3 Athletes Pay for School?\n\nBecause there are no sports scholarships at the Division 3 level, student-athletes have to pay for college like the majority of other applicants. However, they do have a couple of advantages at hand.\n\nFirst, they stand out, meaning they are more likely to get preferred consideration for merit-based rewards.\n\nSecond, many Division 3 schools already offer substantial financial aid packages and offer preferred acceptance to athletes. After all, just because there aren’t scholarships doesn’t mean that these programs are not incredibly competitive, and coaches (and admissions officers) are pragmatic: They know that successful sports teams are a great way to build rapport with alumni.\n\nIn fact, being an athlete can help students gain admission to universities where they would otherwise be waitlisted, like Williams, Hamilton, or Amherst.\n\nThese colleges, like practically all others in the NESCAC, offer comprehensive financial aid packages for many middle-class families. As you can see in the table below, other Division 3 colleges still work to meet the financial needs of student-athletes.\n\nNameState4 yr\n\nGrad\n\nRateNeed Met Avg Fin Aid for Freshmen w/NeedPrivate COA Wesleyan UniversityCT89100$65,227$89,094 Wellesley CollegeMA82100$64,345$90,341 Washington University in St. LouisM088100$63,820$83,760 Colby CollegeME84100$63,725$85,470 University of ChicagoIL89100$63,056$89.040 Colorado CollegeCO84100$62,383$86,500 Amherst CollegeMA84100$62,236$91,304 Washington and Lee UniversityVA91100$62,138$87,000 Williams CollegeMA88100$61,853$81,160 The Colorado CollegeCO83100$56,923$87,128 Vassar CollegeCA81100$61,182$86,886 Haverford CollegePA83100$61,176$90,382 Smith CollegeMA83100$60,749$86,026 Johns Hopkins UniversityMD89100$60,027$86,065 Cazenovia CollegeNY5085$58,796$52,404 Bard CollegeNY5790$58,581$78,080 Swarthmore CollegePA90100$58,439$81,376 Bowdoin CollegeME88100$58,320$85,100 Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyMA88100$57,691$82,730 Vassar CollegeNY87100$57,597$85,220 Carleton CollegeMN88100$57,354$84,893 Hamilton CollegeNY89100$57,037$86,030 Bryn Mawr CollegePA100100$57,010$82,250 St. Lawrence UniversityNY7790$56,038$80,350 Grinnell CollegeIA84100$55,722$82,890 Franklin & Marshall CollegePA81100$55,201$87,367 Tufts UniversityMA90100$54,954$88,300 Trinity CollegeCT80100$54,753$85,410 Macalester CollegeMN8397$54,387$79,890 Bates CollegeME88100$54,033$83,932\n\nD3 Merit Scholarships for Athletes\n\nFinally, there is the matter of merit scholarships, especially for athletes. While the NCAA places firm limits on the amount of outside funding students who receive NCAA scholarships may receive, those rules don’t apply for Division 3 athletes.\n\nInstead, they can get a full range of merit scholarships, which differ by university, and some of which exist to reward athletic prowess.\n\nYou can find colleges that offer merit scholarships for athletes with our easy-to-use, online R2C Insights Tool. Filter, sort, and compare the results for information not only about merit scholarships, but test-optional, early decision, early action, need-based aid, and more.\n\nCompetition at Division 3 level colleges is aggressive, and just because your child plays a sport does not mean that they will be automatically accepted.\n\nHowever, for many families whose children would be borderline at other divisions, going to a D3 school is a viable option, and may permit them to get financial aid beyond what they would otherwise receive.\n\nNameState4 yr\n\nGrad\n\nRateFreshmen w/out NeedFreshmen w/out Need Receiving Merit AidAvg Merit Aid for Freshmen w/out NeedPrivate COA Swarthmore CollegePA9048%1%$45,110$81,376 Washington and Lee UniversityVA9147%11%$43,818$87,000 Bard CollegeNY5724%10%$40,474$78.080 Albion CollegeMI4814%100%$39,697$67,796 Johns Hopkins UniversityMD8945%10%$39,328$86,065 Susquehanna UniversityPA6617%98%$36,317$70,600 Kalamazoo CollegeMI7122%96%$36,009$68,166 Clarkson UniversityNY6426%100%$35,794$76,666 DePauw UniversityIN7348%102%$35,510$70,880 Allegheny CollegePA5915%129%$35,299$66.746 Washington & Jefferson CollegePA6917%100%$34,857$45,515 The College of WoosterOH7038%98%$33,902$73,550 Washington CollegeMD6729%100%$33,834$67.960 Wheaton College (MA)MA7222%50%$33,421$77,510 Ursinus CollegePA6923%97%$33,247$74,240 Washington University in St. LouisMO8857%6%$32,844$83,760 Simpson CollegeIA6415%100%$32,534$55,394 Lebanon Valley CollegePA6014%98%$32,257$60,460 Wabash CollegeIN7328%100%$31,853$61,500 Hartwick CollegeNY4414%11%$31,823$66,409 Lawrence UniversityWI6230%99%$31,503$66.987 Widener UniversityPA5614%97%$31,300$68,148 Lake Forest CollegeIL7419%107%$31,278$65,780 Agnes Scott CollegeGA6922%100%$31,127$61,195 Ohio Wesleyan UniversityOH5922%99%$30,854$69,443 Hollins UniversityVA5818%100%$30,658$56,360 Illinois Wesleyan UniversityIL7529%93%$30,636$68,612 Whittier CollegeCA6231%95%$30,466$64,547 Lycoming CollegePA5514%98%$30,445$61,559 Whitworth UniversityWA6624%80%$28,942$68,668\n\nOther Articles You Might Like:\n\nHow to Get Recruited: A Comprehensive Guide to College Recruiting for Student Athletes\n\nJUCO Colleges: The Underrated Launchpad for Student-Athletes\n\nScholarships for Student Athletes: Our Softball Player’s Story\n\nJOIN ONE OF OUR FACEBOOK GROUPS & CONNECT WITH OTHER PARENTS:\n\nPAYING FOR COLLEGE 101"
