        "text": "EWU’s head men’s basketball coach and Whitworth’s fourth-highest scorer to by honored by the University on Saturday\n\nEastern Washington University head men's basketball coach, David Riley, will be inducted into Whitworth's Hall of Fame tomorrow (Oct. 8).\n\nThe class, which is the Whitworth Heritage Gallery's 32nd, will be officially inducted at 9 a.m. at the Hixon Union Building. It includes other Pirate standouts in Ryan Freeman (swimming), KC McConnell (women's basketball), and Kerry Wright (track and field).\n\nRiley had a standout career with the Pirates from 2008 to 2011. He finished his career as the fourth-highest scorer in the history of the men's basketball program with 1,655 points, averaging 14.6 points per game in 114 contests.\n\nHe was a three-time first team All-NWC honoree, one of only 15 players in the history of the conference to do so. Riley set Whitworth single game records for three-pointers made (10) and attempted (19) in a game against Willamette in 2011. He ranked second all-time at Whitworth for three-pointers made (300) and attempted (696) in a career. As a senior he earned third team All-Region, helped the Pirates finish 28-2 and reach the NCAA Division III quarterfinals.\n\nThe entire class joins 106 others already inducted along with eight teams. Riley will be recognized at halftime of the Whitworth-Linfield football game that afternoon.\n\nAfter graduating, Riley came to Eastern with Pirate head coach, Jim Hayford, and started as the director of basketball operations while earning his Master's degree from EWU. He worked his way up to assistant coach and spent three years in that position under Hayford, and then spent four seasons with Shantay Legans as an assistant coach and the associate head coach.\n\nHe was officially named Eastern Washington's head coach on March 25, 2021 and is in his 12th season overall with the Eagles.\n\nIn April of 2017, he was selected by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) to the Under Armour 30-under-30 squad. In March of 2022, he was named one of 15 finalists for the Joe B. Hall Award, presented annually to the top first-year coach in Division I college basketball.\n\nIn his first season, Riley hit the ground running by hiring an entirely new staff and bringing in 12 newcomers. Riley guided the Eagles to an 18-16 overall record and an 11-9 mark in Big Sky play. It marked the eighth-straight winning season for Eastern Washington and the eighth-straight season with at least 10 conference victories. The Eagles won seven of their last eight regular season games.\n\nThe Eagles also advanced to the postseason for the eighth time in program history, participating in The Basketball Classic a week after appearing in the Big Sky quarterfinals where they lost to Northern Colorado by a point. Eastern Washington also had marquee wins over Washington State and an overtime victory to eventual Big Sky champions, Montana State.\n\nRiley coached Steele Venters and Linton Acliese III to All-Big Sky Second Team honors along with the Big Sky Freshman of the Year, Ethan Price. Under Riley's tutelage, four Eagles ranked in the top-20 all season in points per game in the Big Sky Conference and EWU also led the league in assists per game.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#2 Steele Venters\n\nG/F\n\n6' 7\"\n\nRedshirt Freshman\n\n1L\n\n#10 Ethan Price\n\nF\n\n6' 10\"\n\nFreshman\n\nHS\n\n#20 Linton Acliese III\n\nF\n\n6' 6\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\nTR"
