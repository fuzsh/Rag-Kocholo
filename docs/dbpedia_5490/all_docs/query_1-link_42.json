        "text": "COLLEGEVILLE — For the first time since 2013, the St. John's football team won't be playing in the Division III postseason.\n\nThe Johnnies (8-2) were left out of the 32-team D-III playoff field when the brackets were announced on Sunday, Nov. 12, by the NCAA. St. John's also didn't play in the postseason in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe four at-large teams selected to the field were Coe (Iowa), Wheaton (Illinois), Wisconsin-Whitewater and Union (New York). The Johnnies would have been an at-large team if selected.\n\nAccording to D3football.com, St. John's had the second best strength-of-schedule in Division III this season. Coe was 104th in strength-of-schedule, Wheaton was 64th, Union was 24th and Whitewater was sixth. Ithaca (New York) had the toughest schedule this season in D-III. The Johnnies lost to Whitewater 56-28 back on Sept. 9 in Wisconsin.\n\n\"Once Coe was picked, I knew we were out,\" said SJU head coach Gary Fasching, who was watching the selection show with his coaching staff and some SJU players. \"I turned to one of my coaches and said that. Whitewater was a shoe-in. We had a better strength-of-schedule than Wheaton, Coe and Union. Those three teams didn't have a win against regional opponents.\n\n\"We don't get to choose our fate sometimes. In this case, the NCAA committee felt these three other teams were better than us. I didn't think we'd be competing against Coe, in particular, for an at-large berth.\"\n\nMIAC champion Bethel (8-2), which lost 27-7 to the Johnnies in Collegeville back on Sept. 23, won the conference's automatic berth. Bethel beat Gustavus 31-7 in the MIAC championship game on Saturday, Nov. 11.\n\nBethel opens at Wisconsin-Whitewater (9-1) in a first-round game on Saturday, Nov. 18. In the end, St. John's 38-35 loss at Gustavus (6-4) on Oct. 21 cost it a playoff berth.\n\n\"We had a really good team this year with some great kids on it,\" Fasching said. \"That one slip-up at Gustavus obviously hurt us in the eyes of the committee. They decided to go a different route. I'm not privy to what other factors they looked at.\"\n\nThis was the first season that Division III only had four at-large berths compared to years past when it was five.\n\n\"That hurts, but we don't know if we were the last team left out or not,\" Fasching said. \"Coe didn't have any wins against regional opponents and we had two. The things that supposedly have been important in the past weren't taken into account this year. I can't tell you how disappointed our staff and players are.\n\n\"This team is as every bit as good as some of the teams that have made the playoffs.\"\n\nMinnesota-Morris (7-3), the UMAC champion, qualified for the postseason for the first time since 1981. The Cougars beat Northwestern (Minnesota) 42-39 in the UMAC championship game on Saturday, Nov. 11, to earn an automatic berth. It was the first conference championship for UM-Morris since 2006.\n\nThe Cougars open the playoffs with a game at Wisconsin-La Crosse (9-1) on Nov. 18.\n\nAfter St. John's beat Concordia 48-21 on Saturday to end the regular season, Fasching felt his team had done enough to qualify for the postseason. D3football.com did its own prediction bracket late Saturday and had the Johnnies in the field.\n\n\"Based on what we were told was important, I felt we had a good chance. To have a strong schedule, that's why we schedule teams like Trinity and Whitewater in nonconference,\" Fasching said. \"I felt we did that to compete at a national level and for a playoff berth.\"\n\nFasching will meet with his players on Monday and his message will be one of appreciation and gratitude.\n\n\"It's like anything in life, not everything happens the way you expect,\" he said. \"We all face disappointment in a lot of ways in life. You have to overcome them and move on. We had a pretty darn good season. Most teams would be happy to be 8-2. But here, we aspire for bigger things.\n\n\"We'll build them up for next season and let them know how much we appreciate them.\"\n\nMinnesota Morris (7-3) at Wisconsin La Crosse (9-1)\n\nCoe (9-1) at Aurora (10-0)\n\nHardin-Simmons (9-1) at Trinity (9-1)\n\nBelhaven (9-1) at North Central (10-0)\n\nIllinois College (9-1) at Wartburg (10-0)\n\nChapman (6-3) at Whitworth (9-0)\n\nMount Saint Joseph (9-1) at Wheaton (9-1)\n\nBethel (8-2) at Wisconsin-Whitewater (9-1)\n\nAlfred State (6-4) at Mount Union (10-0)\n\nDePauw (10-0) at Alma (10-0)\n\nCortland (9-1) at Endicott (9-1)\n\nGrove City (10-0) at Susquehanna (10-0)\n\nWestConn (6-2) at Johns Hopkins (10-0)\n\nUnion New York (9-1) at Delaware Valley (9-1)\n\nIthaca (8-2) at Springfield (9-1)\n\nChristopher Newport (7-3) at Randolph-Macon (10-0)"
