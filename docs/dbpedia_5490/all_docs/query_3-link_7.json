Off-campus employment is obtainable; however, clinical experience schedules frequently change with short notice due to the nature of athletics (e.g. rain delays, tournament play, etc.).\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nFinancial aid is available to Whitworth students to support their investment in education. Students do not have to be in a low-income category to qualify, but they do need to apply to be considered for financial aid."
