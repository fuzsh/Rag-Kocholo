        "text": "Toggle Item\n\nWhat are the rankings?\n\nThe Rolex AJGA Rankings is the proprietary system created by the AJGA to identify and rank the top junior players who have competed in the premier junior golf tournaments in the U.S. The specific purposes for which the AJGA uses the Rolex AJGA Rankings are:\n\n1. to guide the Rolex Junior All-America selection process\n\n2. to select or round out AJGA Invitational fields\n\n3. to determine AJGA Wyndham Cup teams, the PING Junior Solheim Cup team, the Junior Presidents Cup team, the AJGA Junior All-Star team, and other international tournament selections\n\nThe information on this page is valid for the 2023-24 Rolex AJGA Rankings year (begins with ranked tournaments October 20 - 22, 2023 and concludes with ranked tournaments the weekend of October 10 - 14, 2024) and is subject to change in 2024-25.\n\nThe rankings are calculated on a 52-week rolling points cycle. Only the most recent 52 weeks are counted in the rankings.\n\nThe rankings are typically updated Tuesday mornings. Each update includes Rolex AJGA-ranked tournaments which ended from Tuesday of the previous week through the Monday prior to the update.\n\nPlayers are ranked on an \"average points per tournament basis.\" A minimum divisor of six (6) is set, meaning that players who play in six or fewer tournaments will have their point total divided by 6 to determine their ranking. Players may be ranked if they have played in fewer than six tournaments, but they must play at least six tournaments in order to receive the full value for each performance. Players that play more than six tournaments will have their point total divided by the total number of tournaments played.\n\nAll starts in ranked tournaments will count towards a player's ranking. Any withdrawals, disqualifications, etc., will count as a tournament played once a player begins said tournament and will result in the player earning zero points for that tournament.\n\nThe system rewards players who compete against strong fields by assigning a point value to each tournament included in the rankings. The point value assigned to a tournament is based on the strength of field for that tournament, discussed below.\n\nToggle Item\n\nHow are tournament point-levels assigned?\n\nA tournament included in the Rolex AJGA Rankings is assigned points ranging from 10 - 150 based on the strength of field once the tournament has concluded. Strength of field is measured by the cumulative number of quality points earned by that tournament field. Each tournament point level has an associated quality point range that is used to determine a tournament’s point value. Quality point ranges are not available to view online. Please note, a tournament’s point value is not a direct 1 to 1 correlation to the quality points a tournament field has earned over the past 52-weeks. For example, a tournament field that has earned 90 quality points does not mean the tournament point value will be 90 points.\n\nOnce an initial tournament point level has been established, a tournament has the ability to rise in value through the remainder of the current rankings season, up to the 150-point level, but it will not decrease in value. Minimum Value tournaments listed below also have the ability to rise in value.\n\nThere are also tournaments at the 225-point level. This value is locked-in and will not change after the tournament is played.\n\nIn all, there are 20 different tournament point levels in the Rolex AJGA Rankings (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90, 100, 120, 150, and 225).\n\nStrength of field is calculated as follows:\n\nCumulative number of quality points a given tournament field has earned in all Rolex AJGA Golf-ranked tournaments over the past 52 weeks\n\nQuality points, based on tournament type, are determined as follows:\n\nBoys Quality Points based on Tournament Type\n\nInvitational - 1st place earns 15 points down to 1 point for 15th place\n\nOpen/Senior - 1st place earns 10 points down to 1 point for 10th place\n\nAJGA Junior All-Star - 1st place earns 5 points down to 1 point for 5th place\n\nAJGA Preview - 1st place earns 1 point\n\nGirls Quality Points based on Tournament Type\n\nInvitational - 1st place earns 10 points down to 1 point for 10th place\n\nOpen/Senior - 1st place earns 5 points down to 1 point for 5th place\n\nAJGA Junior All-Star - 1st place earns 3 points down to 1 point for 3rd place\n\nAJGA Preview - 1st place earns 1 point\n\nNotes:\n\nQuality points at the AJGA Junior All-Star Invitational and the Stacy Lewis Junior All-Star Invitational will be calculated at the \"Open\" level\n\nQuality points at Non-AJGA tournaments that are NOT locked at the 225-point level will be calculated at the \"Open\" level\n\nQuality points at Non-AJGA tournaments that are locked at the 225-point level will be calculated at the \"Invitational\" level\n\nToggle Item\n\nWhat tournaments have minimum point value?\n\nThe minimum point value based on tournament type is listed below*:\n\nOpen tournaments = 40 points\n\nSenior Events = 20 points\n\nAJGA Junior All-Star Series tournaments = 20 points\n\nNon-AJGA tournaments = 20 points\n\nAJGA Preview Series tournaments = 15 points\n\nAJGA Preview Series tournaments (Ages 12-15) = 10 points\n\n*see Bonus Points for recognition of Team Events\n\nBelow is a listing of individual tournaments that have earned a higher minimum point value for the 2023-24 Rankings year.\n\nFormat for tournament listings below:\n\nTournament Dates | Tournament Name | Location | Division Recognized at this Minimum Point Value | Type\n\n120 Points\n\nMar 21 - 24, 2024 | K.J.
