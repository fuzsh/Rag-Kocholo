        "text": "http://www.whitworth.edu/kinesiology-and-athletics\n\nThe Whitworth Kinesiology & Athletics Department offers a major in kinesiology and minors in kinesiology and athletic coaching. These academic programs provide both a theoretical and a practical educational experience for future teachers, coaches and health/wellness/fitness specialists. The kinesiology major allows students to choose from two educational tracks. The teaching track prepares students to teach/coach in public or private schools. Students in the teaching track are also required to complete an education (elementary or K-12) certification. The non-teaching track prepares students for health, fitness and physical education-related career opportunities and requires an internship in the discipline.\n\nThe learning outcomes for this major prepare students to:\n\nDevelop a holistic understanding of the importance/role/significance of the fitness/wellness discipline\n\nDevelop the skills and abilities necessary for employment in careers in the education, exercise and/or health-related professions\n\nLearn and apply the concepts of professionalism and integrity in the fitness and wellness industry\n\nBe prepared for entry into advanced degrees in health, fitness, physical education, sports management, sports psychology, exercise science, movement studies and related fields\n\nBecome health, fitness and physical education teachers who will have a positive impact on the learning and development of those whom they are called to serve\n\nBe eligible for certification exams in strength and conditioning, as well as in personal training\n\nDevelop a worldview that integrates the student's spiritual and ethical values with their vocational calling\n\nWhitworth students are required to complete a minimum of one writing-intensive (“W”) course within their major. Kinesiology courses that currently meet that requirement are KIN 322W and KIN 430W. Students pursuing an education endorsement must have an alternate-level field experience, which may be fulfilled with EDU 493, EDU 494, EDU 496, EDU 497 or EDU 498. In addition, EDU 493, EDU 494, EDU 496, EDU 497 or EDU 498 may be substituted for the kinesiology internship experience if the student is pursuing an endorsement in health and fitness. A grade of “C” or higher in all major courses is required if the student is pursuing teacher certification or an education endorsement. All endorsements are subject to change; see School of Education for updated education requirements.\n\nVarsity Sports\n\nVarsity Baseball Varsity Basketball Varsity Football Varsity Golf Varsity Tennis Varsity Track and Field Varsity Swimming Varsity Softball Varsity Cross-Country Varsity Volleyball Varsity Soccer Cheer Leadership\n\nFitness and Wellness (PE Activity Courses)\n\nIn addition to the previously described degree programs, the kinesiology & athletics department is responsible for the oversight of the institution’s shared curriculum requirements for “fitness and wellness for life.” Courses that fulfill these requirements are designed to emphasize responsible stewardship of God’s creation through maintenance of personal health. Students develop skills and establish habits that prepare them for a lifetime of healthy living and physical well-being. Students are required to complete one activity course.\n\nThe learning outcomes for fitness-for-life courses include:\n\nProvision of an environment for students to participate in regular physical activity\n\nStudents who are challenged to develop healthy lifestyle habits and choices\n\nDevelopment of an understanding and appreciation for the miraculous creation of the human body\n\nThe understanding and application of appropriate fitness and wellness terminology"
