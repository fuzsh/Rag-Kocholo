        "text": "Accreditation\n\nInstitutional Accreditation\n\nWhitworth University is a member institution with the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Whitworth's accreditation status is \"Accreditation Reaffirmed.\" The NWCCU's most recent action on the institution's accreditation status on July 24, 2018, was to reaffirm accreditation. NWCCU is an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).\n\nAccreditation of an institution of higher education by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one which has the necessary resources available to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.\n\nInstitutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrative staff of the institution. Individuals may also contact:\n\nNorthwest Commission on Colleges and Universities\n\n8060 165th Ave. N.E.\n\nRedmond, WA 98052\n\n425.558.4224\n\nWhitworth is also a member of the Association of American Colleges & Universities, the American Council of Education, the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, the Council of Independent Colleges, the CIC Network for Vocation in Undergraduate Education, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.
