PLU was one of eight institutions from the Northwest Conference to earn the Team Academic Award for both its men's and women's track & field programs.\n\nPLU's three individual award winners secure the honor after compiling a 3.30 GPA or higher during the academic year while also ranked in the top 50 in NCAA Division III in an individual event or the top 35 in a relay event.\n\nIndividually, Katy Cook earns All-Academic honors for the second consecutive year. The kinesiology major ranked 32nd in NCAA Division III in the javelin this spring and 19th in the West Region with a season-best toss of 131 feet, three inches, at the 2024 NWC Championships on April 16.\n\nDarius Chaffin joins Cook as a two-time recipient of the All-Academic Award. The communications major had a season-best throw of 187' 8\" in the javelin at the Pacific Open on March 30— an effort that ranks as the 46th best mark in NCAA D3 this season.\n\nKeola Sanchez is the third Lute to be honored. The business major finished the indoor season with the 27th best time in the 60-meters, clocking a time of 6.86 seconds at the Whitworth Invitational on Feb. 9. During the outdoor season, Sanchez was runner-up at the NWC Championships in the 100-meters, blazing down the track in 10.73 seconds.\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
