Division III is the NCAA’s largest division with around 450 member institutions of which most are private. The enrollment rates range from a few hundred to over 30,000 students so you definitely won’t have the same experience at all division III schools.\n\nBelow we’ve listed all colleges that compete in division III athletics. We hope this is useful as you’re searching for the perfect school!\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between the NCAA Divisions?\n\nWhat’s the NCAA?\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a member-driven organization that supports learning through the integration of sports and higher education. The NCAA is made of colleges and universities along with single and multi-sport conferences, plus other affiliated groups. Intra-university leadership work together to create rules that ensure safety, fairness, and success in the long term for student athletes.\n\nWhy have divisions?\n\nThe NCAA stratifies each university by the amount of available resources. The more resources a school has, the lower division it will be i. e. University of Illinois has vast resources as a land grant university so it is a D1 school whereas a smaller, private institution like Trinity College in Connecticut is DIII. The strata (D1, DII, and DIII schools) each have tournaments and conferences where they play against similarly ranked schools. This is so a university with a two billion dollar endowment doesn’t play against a team with significantly fewer resources.\n\nDivisions ensure a competitive playing field in college sports. Division 1 athletes compete at the highest level followed by division II and III (not to say it isn’t competitive).\n\nComplete List of Division III Colleges by State\n\nBecause DIII schools are the smaller colleges in a state, they are often private institutions; however, some DIII colleges are public. Because a majority of DIII schools are on the east coast, in states like New York and Pennsylvania, students in the Midwest or South may have to travel further for games and conferences.

The cake includes factors like extracurricular activities, selection of majors, professors, and location. You should ask yourself questions like: Do you want to go to school with harsh winters or no winters at all? Do you want to go to school with 40,000 students or just a few hundred? How long do you want your morning walk to class to be: two minutes or 20? Below are important questions to answer once you’ve found a school you’re interested in.\n\nLocation\n\nDo you want to go to a DIII college close to home?\n\nAre you prepared for cold winters?\n\nHow important is being close to the beach?\n\nIs the urban life for you, or do you prefer to be hidden behind fields or meadows or grazing cattle?\n\nAcademics\n\nDo you know what you want to major in, and does this DIII school offer that?\n\nIf you don’t know what you want to major in, are there fields of study that seem interesting? Take a look at some of the classes offered.\n\nDoes the academic rigor match how much you want to be challenged?\n\nWould you be happy with a degree from this university?\n\nExtracurriculars\n\nHow many clubs does this university offer? Are there ones that seem interesting?\n\nDoes this school have your favorite sport? What about intramurals?\n\nIs there an academic student group for your selected major?\n\nWhat does the dorm life look like?\n\nEveryday Life\n\nDo you want a close-knit campus or one that you can get lost in?\n\nAre there professors that are doing intriguing research?\n\nCan you get a job close to campus?\n\nWhat is transportation like? Is there a bike path, bus system, etc.?\n\nIt is crucial to answer these questions as you’re making your college selection. Universities vie to satisfy the needs of all their students, but no university is perfect. It’s more about personal fit. You may not like the dorms, the dining hall food, and you really might not like your roommate, but other factors of the university can outweigh this! Prioritizing what is important to you, like location and major selection, will redress the smaller things like an imperfect roommate.\n\nIf you’re looking for a DIII school, you may want to consider things like access to events, students discounts at games, and opportunities to get close to the action. Many schools have student clubs that travel with the sport teams to their away games. You can be a part of the action, giving an ostensible home field advantage.\n\nWhat Are Your Chances of Acceptance?\n\nThe first step is getting accepted, before making your decision. If you’re unsure which school you want to attend or what your odds are of getting accepted, CollegeVine is here to help.\n\nOur free chancing engine uses a myriad of inputs and factors to estimate your odds of success in your college applications. Our school exploration tool helps you explore hundreds of schools. You can search using filters like: DIII athletics, specific conferences, and location.
