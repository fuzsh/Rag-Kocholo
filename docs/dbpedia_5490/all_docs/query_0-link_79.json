        "text": "Academic Policies\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nJust as the faculty, staff and administration at Whitworth strive to be forthright, direct and honest and to value integrity in all their dealings, the university expects all students to function in like manner. Students are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic honesty and to refrain from any dishonest or unethical action. In all academic exercises, examinations, papers and reports, students are expected to submit their own work. The use of the words or ideas of others is always to be indicated through an acceptable form of citation. This policy will be specified in the syllabus for each course.\n\nDefinition of plagiarism: Plagiarism occurs whenever students attempt to pass off as their own work, either verbally or in writing, the words and ideas of others. Plagiarism most often occurs in projects that require independent preparation (outside of class); although it can occur in essay examinations, this is not generally the case. Plagiarism can be either inadvertent (a failure to understand the responsibility for acknowledgment or the means by which acknowledgment should be made) or willful (with a conscious intent to deceive).\n\nDefinition of cheating and dry-labbing: Cheating is any academic activity in which students submit for grade or credit work that is not their own and/or work that has not been done within the structure and context established by the assignment. Students may plagiarize in a variety of ways: copying another student’s homework, copying answers from another student’s test, bringing unauthorized notes or materials to an exam, copying another student’s lab notes, or making up fictitious lab results (also known as “dry-labbing”). All cheating is regarded as willful deception.\n\nConsequences of violations of the policy on academic honesty:\n\nThe faculty member will confront the student(s) in cases of suspected violations of the policy on academic honesty and will keep a written record of the incident.\n\nThe faculty member will assess the gravity of the violation and determine the consequences, which may range from a failing grade on a specific assignment to a failing grade in the course. Assigning a failing grade in a course must be done in consultation with the associate provost.\n\nThe faculty member will submit a written report of policy violations, with their consequences, to the associate provost in the academic affairs office.\n\nThe student has a right to appeal any faculty member's decision by submitting a written appeal to the associate provost. Students may request an appeal if new information has been discovered that was not available at the time the original consequence was assigned. A summary of this new information and its potential impact must be included in the request for appeal. The appeal must be submitted within the assigned time frame.\n\nThe associate provost may then review the appeal in the consultation with the Academic Policies & Appeals Committee, if such review is deemed necessary. All decisions of the associate provost and the Academic Policies & Appeals Committee will be final.\n\nAll violations of the academic honesty policy become part of a student’s educational record. More than one violation may result in behavioral suspension for the remainder of the current term or for a longer period, depending on the nature of the violations.\n\nAcademic Grievances\n\nGrade Challenges\n\nGrade challenges must be initiated by the student in writing within 30 days after a grade is posted. Challenges on grades go to the professor first, but in cases where resolution is not easily achieved, the procedures are as follows:\n\nThe student must first seek resolution of the conflict in consultation with the professor.\n\nIf a satisfactory resolution is not possible in the first phase, the student may contact the department chair.\n\nIf a satisfactory resolution is not possible in the first and second phases, the student may appeal for further adjudication by submitting a written appeal to the appropriate area dean, or the dean's designee, who will issue a final decision.\n\nAcademic Grievances\n\nA student wishing to file a grievance regarding their experience in the classroom should begin with a conversation with their professor or within the department involved. In cases where resolution is not easily achieved, the procedures are as follows: The student must first seek resolution of the conflict in consultation with the professor. If a satisfactory resolution is not possible in the first phase, the student may appeal for further adjudication by submitting a written appeal to the associate provost for instruction. This appeal will be the final step in the grievance process. The associate provost's decision is final.\n\nMontessori Programs in Oregon\n\nStudents should attempt to resolve any grievances they may have with their school first. Should attempts to resolve these problems with appropriate school officials fail, or should the student be dissatisfied with the final outcome of the college complaint process, then the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) can respond to a formal complaint. Students may contact the Higher Education Coordinating Commission, 3225 25th St. SE, Salem, OR 97302, or by sending an email to complaints@hecc.oregon.gov. Students may also access the HECC complaints web page at oregon.gov/highered/about/Pages/complaints.aspx . Students may also contact Whitworth’s institutional accreditor, the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, 8060 165th Ave. N.E., Redmond, WA 98052, or by calling 425.558.4224.\n\nAcademic Warning, Probation and Suspension\n\nAcademic Warning\n\nA student receives an academic warning when, during any fall or spring semester, their semester GPA falls below 2.0 while the cumulative grade-point average is 2.0 or above. The academic record of a student who receives an academic warning for two or more consecutive semesters will be reviewed by the Whitworth Educational Review Board and the student may be placed on probation. Extracurricular activities are not limited by an academic warning.\n\nAcademic Probation\n\nStudents are placed on academic probation at the end of any semester or term in which their cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.0 and/or they have received two consecutive warnings. Students remain on probation until their cumulative GPA reaches the minimum 2.0 standard. Since probation removes a person from good academic standing, students on probation will be limited in their opportunities to participate in off-campus study programs and extracurricular activities (varsity sports, student government, student publications, radio broadcasting and cheer squad, for example).\n\nAcademic Suspension\n\nStudents may face academic suspension at the end of any semester or term in which their semester GPA falls below 1.0, or if, after being placed on probation, they fail to earn at least a 2.0 GPA for the succeeding semester or term. Academic suspension will be noted on the transcript.\n\nAppeal Process\n\nIf there are mitigating reasons for unsatisfactory progress that results in suspension, students may appeal in writing to the Educational Review Board through the associate provost in the academic affairs office. Reinstatement after any semester or sequence on suspension is dependent upon the student's written application to the Educational Review Board through the associate provost. If the student is reinstated, a notation of reinstatement will be noted on the transcript. Students who are receiving financial aid should refer to satisfactory academic progress policies and appeal processes.\n\nAcademic Petitions\n\nThe Whitworth Registrar has the delegated authority to see that students adhere to the university's academic policies and requirements. The petition process provides students and faculty with the possibility of a response outside the normal bounds of policy when extenuating circumstances are judged to warrant such a response. Extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to, illness, injury, death in the family, problems with immigration, and matters in which established policies are unclear or in conflict. Holds that are unresolved by the deadline do not constitute an extenuating circumstance and are not grounds for petition.\n\nPetition Process:\n\nPetitions should be generated by an individual current or potential student on the standard Petition for Exception form. A petition must not only voice the request but must also substantiate its validity.\n\nSubmit the petition to the registrar's office, which will rule on the petition; in the case of a denial, written reasons will be supplied to the petitioner.\n\nIf the petition is denied, and if extenuating circumstances exist, the student may ask the registrar to have the denial reviewed by the associate provost in consultation with the Appeals & Policy Committee. Students may request an appeal if new information has been discovered that was not available at the time of the original decision. A summary of this new information and its potential impact must be included in the request for appeal. The appeal must be submitted within the assigned time frame.\n\nAll decisions of the Appeals & Policy Committee are final and binding.\n\nAccommodations for Religious Observances\n\nIn accord with SSB 5166, Whitworth University accommodates student absences, for up to two days per academic year, for reasons of faith or conscience, or for an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church or religious organization. Written notice and request for accommodation must be given within the first two weeks of the beginning of the course and provide specific dates the student requests accommodation. Faculty members will work with such students to reach mutual agreement about the terms of the accommodation. Grievances about a failure to accommodate should be directed to the associate provost.\n\nDeclaring or Changing Academic Program\n\nDeclaration deadline policies apply as follows:\n\nStudents with A.A./A.S. degrees: by second semester\n\nStudents with transfer credit: by second semester or by Spring Term of their sophomore year\n\nFreshmen: by Spring Term of their sophomore year\n\nNote: Failure to declare a major by the appropriate deadline will result in a registration hold being placed on the student's record.\n\nStudents may elect to change their major, individually designed major or second field, but they are advised to evaluate possible increases in the length of time required to graduate. Any changes of program or academic advisor must be requested in writing, signed by the advisor and submitted to the registrar’s office.\n\nCredit Hour Policy\n\nOne semester credit is equivalent to 14 contact hours and at least two hours of work outside of class for each contact hour for a total of 42 hours per credit. Online courses may define contact hours with either synchronous or asynchronous instruction, but the total expected work still represents at least 42 hours per credit. Students are not allowed to register for courses with time conflicts due to federal requirements for contact hours. The only exceptions allowed for time conflicts are courses where the total contact hours far exceed the minimum 14 contact hours per credit. These include some music ensembles, field studies and laboratories. Students in one of these conflicting courses may obtain permission to partially attend as long as the minimum contact time per credit is met and the total hours of contact time plus outside work still represents 42 hours per credit.\n\nFERPA\n\nDirectory Information\n\nAt its discretion, the university may provide directory information in accordance with the provisions of FERPA to include a student’s name, address, telephone number, email address, date and place of birth, major field of study, dates of attendance, class standing, full- or part-time status, degrees and awards received, photos, most recent previous educational agency or institution attended, denominational affiliation, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, and weight and height of members of varsity athletics teams. Students may withhold directory information by notifying the registrar’s office in writing within two weeks after the first day of class for each semester. This request for nondisclosure will be honored until it is revoked. A request to withhold directory information will prevent the student’s name and degree from being published on the Provost's Honor Roll. If non-directory information is required during an emergency, and if the university deems that information necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or of other individuals, Whitworth may release that information.\n\nStudents may allow the release of academic and/or financial information to designated individuals by granting those individuals proxy access; this authorization can be set up in Self-Service under the User Options menu.\n\nChanges to Directory Information\n\nLegal name-change policy: Current students of Whitworth University may change their legal name with proper documentation and the submission of a completed name-change request form. Acceptable proof of legal name change will include two forms of official documentation such as a birth certificate, divorce decree or court order, government issued identification card, social security card or passport. After the proper documentation and a completed request form are received by the registrar’s office (300 W. Hawthorne Road, Spokane, WA 99251), the change will be reflected on the student’s university records.\n\nChosen name-change policy\n\nA student may choose to be identified within the university community by a chosen name that differs from the individual’s legal first or last name. Students who want to use a chosen name may initiate the process from the Chosen Name Change Request form. A person’s chosen name will appear instead of, or in addition to, the person’s legal name in university-related systems and documents where it is technically feasible and where the use of the legal first name is not required by university business or legal need. Whitworth University reserves the right to deny or remove a chosen name for any reason, including but not limited to misuse, misrepresentation, attempting to avoid legal obligation, or the use of offensive names, with or without notice. Under the university’s Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) policy, a student’s chosen and legal name are both identified, along with other items, as directory information.\n\nEqual Opportunity Policy\n\nIt is the policy of Whitworth University to provide equal educational opportunity without regard to age, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or disability as defined by law, in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972, Sections 799A and 845 of the Public Health Services Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991. In addition, Whitworth University is committed to the fair and equal treatment of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in its programs and activities. As a religious educational institution affiliated with the Presbyterian church, Whitworth University reserves the right to hire employees who share a commitment to the Christian faith.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nEach academic year the university informs students of their rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This act is designed to protect the privacy of education records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review their academic records, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal or formal hearings. Students have the right to file complaints with the FERPA office concerning any alleged failure by Whitworth University to comply with this act. The complete institutional policy statement related to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 is available through the registrar’s office.\n\nGrading\n\nGrade Reports\n\nMidterm Grades\n\nOn the date designated as midterm in the academic calendar, student grades of \"C-\" or lower are reported to the registrar’s office. Students and their advisors are then notified of the grade so that there is opportunity for the students to improve their performance before the end of the semester.\n\nFinal Grades\n\nFinal grades are reported to the registrar’s office on the designated date specified in the academic calendar. Final grades may be viewed on Self-Service.\n\nIncomplete Grades\n\nGrades and Quality Points\n\nGrades Grade Quality Points A Superior: 4 points A- 3.7 points B+ 3.3 points B Good: 3 points B- 2.7 points C+ 2.3 points C Fair: 2 points C- 1.7 points D+ 1.3 points D Poor: 1 point D- 0.7 points F Failure: 0 points W Official Withdrawal; does not affect GPA WA Administrative Withdrawal; does not affect GPA WF Withdrawal Failing (past the acceptable time limit for a \"W\" grade), computed as an \"F\" in the GPA WW Withdrawal Without Permission (stopped attending or never attended the course), computed as an \"F\" in the GPA AU Audit; does not affect GPA I Incomplete; to be made up by six weeks into the next fall or spring semester; after the deadline, the grade computes as an \"F\"; see incomplete grades policy above for more information IE Incomplete; time to finish work is extended until six weeks into the next fall or spring semester; after the deadline, the grade computes as an \"F\"; see incomplete grades policy above for more information S Satisfactory; given upon completion of a Satisfactory/Not Satisfactory course; does not affect GPA; commonly used for grading internships, study abroad programs and specific non-graded courses NS Not Satisfactory; given for unsatisfactory work in a Satisfactory/Non Satisfactory course; does not affect GPA P/NC For class taken with P/NC option, Pass for a grade of \"C\" or higher; No Credit is given for grades of \"C-,\" \"D+,\" \"D,\" \"D-,\" or \"F\"; grade of P/NC does not affect GPA and is irreversible\n\nCalculation of the Grade-Point Average\n\nCurrent and cumulative grade-point averages are calculated on the basis of grades earned at Whitworth only. Credits for courses accepted in transfer from other institutions count toward the total required for graduation, but the grades for those courses do not affect the Whitworth GPA. The grade-point average is computed by dividing the quality points total by the total number of graded (\"A\"-\"F\") credits attempted during any given grading period. Quality points for a course are determined by multiplying the numerical equivalent of the letter grade by the credit attempted. Pass/No Credit and Satisfactory/Not Satisfactory grades are not used in computing the GPA.\n\nAcademic Forgiveness\n\nIf a student has been withdrawn from Whitworth for a minimum of one year, they can return and petition to have one semester of academic grades and credits forgiven. The grades will remain on the transcript, but the grade points and credits will be removed. They will no longer calculate in the GPA. A notation of “academic forgiveness” will be indicated on the transcript.\n\nHonors\n\nProvost's Honor Roll\n\nAt the end of each fall and spring semester, full-time undergraduate students with a 3.75 GPA for the semester who carry a course load of 12 semester credits for which \"A\"-\"F\" grades are given will be listed on the Provost’s Honor Roll for that semester once grades have been processed.\n\nLatin Honors\n\nLatin Honors Honor GPA cum laude (with honors) 3.50 GPA magna cum laude (with high honors) 3.75 GPA summa cum laude (with highest honors) 3.90 GPA\n\nNote: Honors are calculated and awarded when degrees are posted.\n\nGeorge Whitworth Honors\n\nFor George F. Whitworth Honors Program requirements, see the George Whitworth Honors Page.\n\nStudent Information\n\nGraduate Students\n\nGraduate students are master's candidates. Admission to master's programs is by application only.\n\nMatriculated Students\n\nMatriculated students are those who have met the requirements for admission and have registered for courses in their program of choice.\n\nNon-Matriculated Students\n\nStudents who do not wish to seek a degree, and who want to attend only specific courses, are classified as non-matriculated students. These students are not required to submit the credentials required for admission as a matriculated student. Non-matriculated students must register for courses in person through the registrar's office, and comply with all associated policies. Full courses and course waitlists are not available for non-matriculated registration.\n\nVeterans\n\nWhitworth is approved for veteran training as an institution of higher education by the Washington Student Achievement Council. Selected programs of study at Whitworth University are approved by the Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board's State Approving Agency (WTECB/SAA) for enrollment of those who are eligible to receive benefits under Title 38 and Title 10, USC. Whitworth is committed to upholding and complying with the intent of Veterans Administration regulations. The university does not and will not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollment or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admissions activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. Benefit recipients must meet satisfactory-progress standards in order to continue receiving benefits for study. VA benefit recipients are held to the same academic standards as are other Whitworth students. Records that permit monitoring of progress are kept in the registrar’s office. Termination of benefits will be initiated upon receipt of a withdrawal form. It is the responsibility of the benefit recipient to submit a withdrawal form to the registrar and to notify the veterans coordinator immediately upon ceasing to attend any course. Contact the registrar's office at registrar@whitworth.edu or 509.777.3205 for additional information.\n\nClass Standing\n\nClass Standing Class Credits Freshman 0-29 semester credits Sophomore 30-59 semester credits Junior 60-89 semester credits Senior 90 and above semester credits 126 minimum credits to graduate\n\nConsumer Information\n\nwww.whitworth.edu/consumer-information\n\nFor more information please contact:\n\nAssistant Vice President for Research and Innovation: Greg Orwig, gorwig@whitworth.edu\n\nAssociate Vice President for Student Financial Services: Traci Stensland, tstensland@whitworth.edu\n\nRegistrar: Stacy Hill, shill@whitworth.edu\n\nStudent Right-To-Know Information\n\nIn compliance with the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, Whitworth is pleased to provide the following information concerning its graduation rates. The rates reflect the graduation status of full-time, matriculating undergraduate students for whom 150 percent of the normal time to completion has elapsed.\n\nFirst- to Second-Year Retention Rates\n\nFirst-to-Second Year Retention Rates Cohort Cohort Cohort Cohort 2020 Cohort 2021 Cohort 2022 Cohort Total 79% 78% 80%\n\nSix-Year Graduation Rates\n\nSix Year Graduation Rates Cohort Cohort Cohort 2015 Cohort 2016 Cohort 2017 Cohort Total 75% 76% 68% Gender Female 77% 78% 70% Male 72% 72% 66% Race/Ethnicity American Indian/Alaskan Native* 33% 100% 33% Asian 66% 76% 70% Black/African American* 81% 62% 80% Hispanic/Latino 67% 73% 62% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander* 100% na% 55% Two or More 64% 72% 67% White 79% 76% 72% Race/Ethnicity Unknown* 80% 100% 33% International Students* 75% 88% 45% Financial Aid Type Pell Grant 65% 72% 66% Stafford Loan 77% 68% 67% All Others 87% 83% 60% *These populations are very small and so small fluctuations can create big changes in the percentages.\n\nFour-Year Average Rate for Graduating Within Six Years\n\nMatriculated day, full-time, student body diversity for fall 2023\n\nMatriculated Day Full Time Student Type Percentage Female 56% Male 44% American Indian/Alaskan <1% Asian 4% Black 3% Hawaiian 2% Hispanic 12% Two or More 10% White 64% Unknown <1% International Students 5% Pell Grant Recipients 30%\n\nNormal Full-Time Course Load\n\nFall and spring semesters: The normal load for full-time undergraduate students is 12 to 16 semester credits, including up to five semester credits in Jan Term. Students must have advisor approval to register for more than 16 credits during a single semester. Students may not take more than 20 credits in a single semester regardless of GPA or advisor approval.\n\nSummer Term: The maximum allowable load is three semester credits in a three-week session and six semester credits in a six-week session.\n\nA student must average 31.5 semester credits per year to graduate in four years. In order to remain under the catalog requirements in effect at the time of their initial enrollment, students must complete a degree within six years from the time of matriculation. Because graduate programs vary in format, students should check with their respective graduate schools to determine the normal course load.\n\nIf students enroll in more than 16 credits, they may incur additional tuition charges. Students should check with the student accounts office to see if overload tuition charges are waived for a particular course. Jan Term is considered part of the spring semester and tuition is free to students who were enrolled full time as matriculated day students in the fall semester or who are enrolled full time as matriculated day students for the spring semester. A flat fee for Jan Term will be charged; please see Financial Information for more information.\n\nPlease note: Class fees are subject to change without notice.\n\nNormal Progress and Financial Aid\n\nA student is eligible to receive aid while they are working toward his or her degree until they reach 150 percent of the number of credits required to earn the degree. Registration for less than a full-time load (12-16 semester credits) may prevent a student from receiving some forms of Whitworth financial aid. More information on satisfactory progress requirements for recipients of financial aid is available at the Whitworth Financial Aid website or office.\n\nStudent Registration\n\nRegistration\n\nWhitworth University matriculated day students register for classes through Self-Service. Matriculated day students register for their next classes during their assigned registration period each semester. Students enrolled in the School of Continuing Studies and in graduate and doctoral programs must work with their program staff/faculty to register for courses. The registrar's office will assist students who are away from campus on study abroad programs with class registration for their next semester or term.\n\nStudents can adjust their class schedules via Self-Service through the first week of classes. Beginning with the second week of classes, students must complete an add/drop form, including the instructor and advisor's signature, and submit it to the registrar’s office for processing. It is the university’s policy to deny requests for registration in any course after the close of the term in which registration was required.\n\nRegistration for teaching assistantships, research assistantships, field studies, readings, independent studies and internships are processed in the registrar’s office. Continuing studies students and graduate students should check with their programs for registration dates. Registration for study abroad is coordinated by the Whitworth Office of International Education.\n\nDeadlines for adding or withdrawing from classes are published in the academic calendar each semester. It is the student's responsibility to check their registration information and to discuss any needed corrections with the registrar’s office.\n\nNo person, other than a faculty member conducting a formal peer teaching evaluation, may attend a Whitworth class for which that person has not been officially registered. A professor may allow students to attend their class only if the students' names appear on the official and current class roster.\n\nIn order for the university to provide the best classroom learning environment for all students, children may not attend any Whitworth class. No child may, under any circumstances, be left unattended in a university building while a parent is attending class. Safety is our main concern; we cannot ensure children's safety when they are left unattended.\n\nWaitlisting for Closed Courses\n\nStudents may waitlist themselves via Self-Service for most closed courses. As space becomes available in such classes, waitlisted students will be sent an email notifying them that they have 24 hours to register for the course on Self-Service. If a waitlisted student does not register within 24 hours, they will be dropped from the waitlist.\n\nChanges in Registration\n\nDistanced Learning\n\nIn the event health/safety protocols require it, Whitworth reserves the right to deliver instruction through distanced modes.\n\nClass Attendance\n\nClass attendance is expected and may be included in the calculation of the grade for the class. Students who register for courses they do not attend are responsible for dropping the courses officially through the registrar’s office. The consequence of not officially dropping a course is a “WW” (withdrew without permission) grade, which calculates as an “F” in the GPA. A student should contact the professor of a class if they (the student) plans to be absent any day during the first week of the semester/term.\n\nAdd/Drop Policy\n\nStudents are required to be registered for all of their courses before the end of the add/drop period, including independent studies, field studies and internships.\n\nStudents who must change their schedule after the fifth day of the semester must do so by completing an Add/Drop form and returning it to the registrar's office with signatures from the course instructor and the students' advisor. After the 10th day of the semester, a grade of \"W\" will be given for any full-semester course that is dropped. A grade of \"WF\" will be given for full-semester courses dropped after the ninth week of the semester. See the academic calendar for applicable dates for half-semester courses. The last day to drop a course is the final day of regular instruction before final exams.\n\nRepeat/Delete Policy\n\nA course taken at Whitworth may be repeated at Whitworth. Courses cannot be taken under the repeat/delete policy except at Whitworth. Check the section on financial aid to determine if/how your level of aid will be affected if you repeat courses in which you received a passing grade.\n\nIn order for a student to repeat a course, they must have received a grade no higher than a \"C\" in the class.\n\nGrades for all courses taken at Whitworth will appear on the permanent record.\n\nWhen computing the grade-point average and total hours earned, the student repeating a course will be credited with the highest grade earned for all attempts and with course credits for only one attempt.\n\nThe GPA will reflect the credits and quality points in the term during which the student earns the best grade unless the credits have expired, which can happen in graduate programs.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of times a student can repeat a course.\n\nCourse Withdrawals\n\nAccelerated classes and graduate-level classes are sometimes offered in a nontraditional term. Check with your department to determine the withdrawal policy for your program.\n\nTraditional semester programs have the following course withdrawal policy:\n\nA withdrawal from a course during the first two weeks of the term will not appear on the transcript.\n\nA withdrawal after the first two weeks through the ninth week of the term will be noted with a \"W\" (withdrawal) grade on the transcript.\n\nA withdrawal after the ninth week and before final exams will be noted with a \"WF\" (withdraw failing) grade on the transcript.\n\nIf a student stops attending a course or never attends but does not officially withdraw from the course by completing a drop form and submitting it to the registrar's office, a grade of \"WW\" (withdrew without permission) will be noted on the transcript. The student will still be bound by any financial obligations they have assumed.\n\nHardship Hiatus or Hardship Withdrawal\n\nIn rare circumstances, a student may be granted a hardship hiatus or withdrawal, given when a debilitating medical, psychological condition or family emergency makes it necessary for them to withdraw from all of their non-graded courses and get the off-campus support/help necessary to their return as a student.\n\nMatriculated day students seeking a hardship hiatus or hardship withdrawal should apply to the dean of students or their designee within a week of the anticipated withdrawal, providing written documentation of the condition. Under a hardship status, the student will receive a \"W\" in all non-graded classes for the term, and financial officers will determine charges to be paid, based on the current Tuition and Fee Refund Policy. A hold will be placed on the withdrawing student's account until reinstatement criteria are met and reinstatement is approved by the dean of students or their designee. Hardships will not be granted after the Friday before finals week, and no hardships are granted during the January term.\n\nSchool of Continuing Studies, graduate and doctoral students seeking a hardship hiatus or hardship withdrawal should apply to the dean of their school/college or their designee within a week of the anticipated withdrawal, providing written documentation of the condition. Under a hardship status, the student will receive a \"W\" in all non-graded classes for the term, and financial officers will determine charges to be paid, based on the current Tuition and Fee Refund Policy. A hold will be placed on the withdrawing student's account until reinstatement criteria are met and reinstatement is approved by the dean of students or their designee.\n\nReinstatement Process following a Hardship Hiatus or Hardship Withdrawal\n\nStudents should contact the appropriate dean or their designee when they are ready to request reinstatement. Students must provide documentation that demonstrates their readiness to return to academic work and, if applicable, a residential environment. The student will also create a reinstatement plan outlining strategies and/or support systems that will provide the best possible opportunity for success. The student will be restricted from enrolling in courses until these materials are provided and reinstatement is approved by the dean of students or their dean's designee.\n\nOfficial Withdrawal from Whitworth University\n\nTo withdraw officially from Whitworth University, a student must complete the electronic withdrawal form and submit it for processing.\n\nHiatus Policy\n\nStudents who have completed at least one semester at Whitworth are eligible to take a leave of absence for up to one academic year and to return without reapplying for admission. This leave, known as a hiatus, allows students to maintain their access to Self-Service and their Whitworth email accounts while they are away. To be placed on an official hiatus from Whitworth University, a student must complete the electronic hiatus form and submit it for processing.\n\nPass/No Credit Option\n\nThis option is designed to encourage students to explore areas of study outside their majors. Students may choose to take one P/NC course each academic year at Whitworth. Courses in the student’s major and education courses are excluded from this option. Students may elect to take PE activity courses Pass/No Credit. A grade of \"Pass\" will be assigned in a P/NC course on the basis of a grade of “C” or higher. A grade of \"No Credit\" will be assigned in a P/NC course on the basis of a grade of “C-” or lower. Once a P/NC has been declared, it is irreversible. Check the academic calendar for the deadline to declare P/NC. NOTE: If students never attend or stop attending a class in which they have declared a P/NC, they will receive a \"WW\" grade and not the No Credit grade; the \"WW\" grade equates to unofficial withdrawal from the class.\n\nStudent Holds\n\nCircumstances may cause a hold to be placed on a student’s account. Each hold prevents the student from participating in a university privilege such as registration, adding/dropping classes, receiving official transcripts and participating in campus activities. The list below shows the types of holds and the offices to contact regarding these holds.\n\nStudent Holds Type of Hold Department Academic Suspension Registrar's Office Business Office Hold Student Accounts Office Loan Office Hold Student Accounts Office Financial Aid Hold Financial Aid Office Registrar's Hold Registrar's Office Student Life Hold Student Life Office Compliance Hold International Education Office Health Center Hold Health Center\n\nGeneral Course Numbers\n\nLower-Division Courses\n\n100-199: Primarily for first-year students. May not be taken for graduate credit.\n\n200-299: Primarily for sophomores. May not be taken for graduate credit.\n\nUpper-Division Courses\n\n300-399: Primarily for juniors/seniors. Graduate students may count a limited number of credits.\n\n400-499: Primarily for seniors. Graduate students may count a limited number of credits.\n\n500-599: Graduate level. Undergraduates may enroll only with special permission.\n\nSpecial Course Numbers\n\nAt undergraduate and graduate levels, course numbers ending in 80, 86, 90, 91, 95 or 96 indicate special courses. Subject matter in these courses varies.\n\nAll departments may offer these types of courses, but because not all may be listed in this catalog, students are urged to ask individual department offices about the availability of courses of the type and level desired. Their designations are as follows:\n\n80 Field Study\n\n86 Readings\n\n90 Internship\n\n91 Independent Study\n\n95 Teaching Assistantship/Research Assistantship\n\n96 Special Topics (offered at the 100, 200, 300 and 400 levels)\n\nTransfer and Alternative Credit\n\nAcademic Credit and Evaluation\n\nAcademic credit is awarded on the basis of semester credits. One semester credit is equivalent to 14 contact hours and two hours of work outside of class for each contact hour. Evaluation of coursework is accomplished in a variety of ways, depending upon the nature of the course.\n\nAcceptance of Transfer Credits\n\nWhitworth will accept applicable undergraduate and graduate work transferred from regionally accredited institutions. In the case of graduate theological credit, this includes institutions accredited by the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) in the United States and Canada. For institutions without regional accreditation, the transfer of credit will be considered if the credibility of the institution can be supported by the “three-letter rule,” which states that it is the responsibility of the student to provide letters from three regionally accredited institutions certifying that they will accept credit from the institution from which the student is seeking credit. A total of two-thirds credit will be awarded for coursework completed at non-regionally accredited Bible schools that hold an ABHE accreditation. For the full policy on transfer graduate credit, please visit catalog.whitworth.edu/graduate.\n\nIf transfer credit is taken from an institution using quarter credits, Whitworth University will use a two-thirds conversion calculation to convert the credits to semester credits.\n\nConversion of Quarter Credits to Semester Credits\n\nConversion of Quarter to Semester Quarter Credits Conversion Semester Credits 1 x 2/3 .67 2 x 2/3 1.33 3 x 2/3 2 4 x 2/3 2.67 5 x 2/3 3.33\n\nA maximum of 64 lower level semester credits and 30 upper level semester credits may be transferred from a community college; a total of 94 semester credits may be transferred from a four-year college or combination of two- and four-year colleges. Credits earned more than 15 years prior to matriculation at Whitworth will require department approval if they are to fulfill a requirement in the major. Courses in which the student received a grade lower than “C,” vocational-technical courses, non-college-level courses, credit earned by exam at another institution, and incomplete courses are not transferable. Official transcripts must be received by the registrar’s office from the transferring institution in order to have credit evaluated for final acceptance.\n\nTransfer Policies for Students Holding Associate of Arts Degrees\n\nA student transferring to Whitworth with an associate of arts (A.A.) degree from a community college in Washington (approved by the Intercollege Relations Commission for the State of Washington), Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, or with an associate of science (A.S.) degree from a community college in Washington or North Idaho college (excludes AST-Track I & II), will receive the following:\n\nJunior standing (60 semester credits)\n\nTransfer credit of a maximum of 96 quarter credits or 64 semester credits\n\nWaiver of all shared curriculum requirements, with the following exceptions:\n\nFirst-year seminar(s) or transfer seminar​\n\nOne course in Biblical Literature\n\nOne course in Faith, Reasoning and Contemporary Issues (FRCI)\n\nStudents who transfer from other institutions or states not mentioned above and who hold A.A. or A.S. degrees will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis.\n\nIn order to be eligible for DTA shared curriculum waivers, transfer students must earn an approved associate degree prior to initial enrollment at Whitworth. Students who begin matriculation at Whitworth University, then leave and return at a later date with an A.A. or A.S. degree, or who complete an A.A. or A.S. degree while attending Whitworth University, will have credits evaluated on a course-by-course basis, and they will not receive DTA shared curriculum waivers.\n\nTransfer students are encouraged to contact the registrar’s office to determine the applicability of their coursework to specific bachelor’s degrees. General information can be given over the telephone (toll-free at 800.533.4668). To obtain a complete transcript evaluation, send the request with an official copy of college transcripts to the Whitworth University Registrar’s Office, 300 W. Hawthorne Road, Spokane, WA 99251.\n\nPolicy on Credit Transfer for Exchange Students\n\nWhen a student studies abroad on an approved, non-faculty-led program, the credit they receive will be based solely on the transcript issued by the host institution or program.* When applying credit from exchange partner universities, Whitworth will use widely-accepted credit conversion rates for academic systems around the world.\n\n*Approved programs are listed in the Whitworth Catalog under Exchanges and Study Abroad Opportunities.\n\nWashington 45\n\nStudents who transfer Washington 45 courses must still meet Whitworth’s admission requirements and satisfy all shared curriculum and degree requirements. A student who completes courses from within the shared curriculum categories in the Washington 45, and earns a \"C\" or better for each course, will be able to transfer up to 45 quarter credits to Whitworth. The ratio of quarter hours to semester hours is 2/3. So for every quarter-credit earned, Whitworth will award 0.67 semester credit in transfer. A total of 30 semester hours is awarded for 45 quarter-credit hours; this is equivalent to sophomore standing at Whitworth.\n\nAlthough the courses in the Washington 45 are listed under various categories, the actual course may satisfy a different shared curriculum requirement at Whitworth. Whitworth, like many institutions, has its own shared curriculum requirements, so students should check with the registrar’s office regarding how these courses will transfer.\n\nAlternative Course Credit\n\nA maximum of 32 alternative semester credits (48 quarter credits) may be counted toward graduation. Alternative credit includes Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB) degree courses, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) credit, and DANTES credit, portfolios and credit for military service and schools. Alternative course credit is calculated as part of the transfer-credit limit of 94. Contact the registrar’s office for further information.\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP)\n\nWhitworth is an active participant in the College Entrance Examination Board Advanced Placement program. A score of four or above on an AP test is accepted for credit in some disciplines at Whitworth. In many cases, this score will also satisfy a general graduation requirement and/or a requirement for an academic major.
