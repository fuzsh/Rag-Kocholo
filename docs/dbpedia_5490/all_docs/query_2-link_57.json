        "text": "No. 19 Football Squares Off Against No. 8 Randolph-Macon This Saturday\n\n11/21/2023 9:35:00 AM\n\nITHACA, N.Y. – The nationally ranked No. 19 Ithaca College (9-2) football team will travel to Ashland, Virginia for an NCAA Second Round matchup at No. 8 Randolph-Macon College (11-0) this Saturday, November 25 at Day Field. Kickoff is scheduled for 12 p.m.\n\nGAME COVERAGE\n\nWATCH | LIVE STATS | LISTEN | GAME NOTES\n\nTICKETS:\n\nPlease purchase tickets prior to game day.\n\nAdults - $10\n\nStudents and Children ages 2-12 - $5\n\nhttps://events.ticketspicket.com/agency/278061dd-baf7-435b-b70e-c1aee5a182fa/events/87e4254e-a8f0-41ac-9925-59074a690b92\n\nSTATISTICS:\n\nITHACA | RANDOLPH-MACON\n\nALL-TIME SERIES: Saturday's second round matchup will mark the first-ever meeting between Ithaca and Randolph-Macon in more than 200 combined years of football between the two schools. Ithaca's first football season was 1930 and Randolph-Macon started its program in 1881.\n\nThe two programs have barely shared any common opponents as well. Randolph-Macon played Cortland in the NCAA First Round last season and the Yellow Jackets opened their 2018 and 2019 seasons against Johns Hopkins. The only conference foe of Randolph-Macon's that Ithaca has played was Ferrum College back in 1988.\n\nNCAA SECOND ROUND: There are 16 teams remaining in the NCAA Division III Football Championship heading into this weekend. The eight winners on Saturday will advance to the quarterfinals on December 2.\n\nWisconsin-La Crosse vs. Aurora | Trinity (Texas) vs. North Central\n\nWartburg vs. Whitworth | Wheaton (Ill.) vs. Wisconsin-Whitewater\n\nMount Union vs. Alma | Cortland vs. Grove City\n\nJohns Hopkins vs. Union | Ithaca vs. Randolph-Macon\n\nRECAP FROM SPRINGFIELD: Ithaca beat the host Springfield College Pride at their own game in an NCAA First Round matchup at Stagg Field and came away with a 21-7 victory. Ithaca held Springfield to just 160 yards of offense and 105 yards rushing, while the IC offense ran for 259 yards and finished the day with 294 yards as the Bombers held onto the ball for over 40 minutes. Springfield entered the game as the nation's leading rushing team with 407 per game.\n\nJalen Leonard-Osbourne finished the game with 165 yards on 20 carries and two touchdowns. Leonard-Osbourne also led in receiving yards with 26. He eclipsed 1,000 yards on the season to become the first running back to reach that mark since 2012.\n\nDerek Slywka made six solo tackles, including two for a loss and forced a fumble to clinch IC's win.\n\nHOW THEY GOT HERE: Ithaca claimed its second straight Liberty League championship this season with a perfect 6-0 mark. The Bombers also defeated now No. 14 Endicott and Alfred to achieve the hardest strength of schedule in Division III at .673. IC's only losses the season were to now No. 7 Johns Hopkins (27-17) and No. 11 Cortland (38-28).\n\nRandolph-Macon won its second straight Old Dominion Athletic Conference title this season. The Yellow Jackets have gone undefeated in the regular season each of the past two seasons and have only lost two games since 2020.\n\nITHACA IN THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP: The Bombers are one of the most storied programs in Division III history with three national championships in 1979, 1988 and 1991. IC has reached the national title game seven times, finishing as the runner-up in 1974, 1975, 1980 and 1985. Only Mount Union (13), Wisconsin-Whitewater (6) and Augustana (4) have more national titles than Ithaca.\n\nIC is making its 21st all-time appearance in the NCAA Division III Championship and owns an overall record of 31-17.\n\nLIBERTY LEAGUE WEEKLY HONORS: On November 20, the Liberty League announced its weekly awards and selected Leonard-Osbourne as the Offensive Performer of the Week and Darren Brunner as the Special Teams Performer of the Week.\n\nAgainst Springfield, Brunner recorded four punts for 201 yards, an average of 50.3 yards, and boomed three punts over 50 yards, including a long of 59. Three punts landed inside Springfield's 20-yard line. He also forced a fumble on defense.\n\nMORE ABOUT THE BOMBERS: IC improved to 9-2 on the season with its first round victory and enters the second round averaging 27.8 points and 375.5 yards per game, while the opposition averages 13.9 points and 290.0 yards.\n\nThe Bombers recorded two more takeaways in the win against Springfield to bring their total to 23 over the past eight games.\n\nColin Schumm reached 200 rushing yards on the season with 63 against Springfield. Schumm has completed 63.1 percent of his passes since stepping into the starting role and has thrown for 751 yards and four touchdowns. Sam Kline is the leading target with 618 yards and five touchdowns on 45 catches. Leonard-Osbourne also has 39 receptions for 394 yards.\n\nBen Stola now has 106 total tackles on the season, while Jake Connolly has 87 tackles. Slywka has recorded a takeaway in six straight games (six interceptions, one fumble recovery and one forced fumble). He also has two blocked kicks during that stretch.\n\nNCAA STAT LEADERS: IC ranks top 20 nationally in eight difference statistical categories. The Bombers are second in sacks allowed, sixth in turnovers lost, eighth in turnover margin and interceptions thrown, 11th in interceptions, 16th in tackles for loss allowed, 17th in fumbles lost and 20th in scoring defense.\n\nRandolph-Macon ranks top 20 in 22 different statistical categories and are the nation's best team in third down conversions at 60.5-percent.\n\nLET'S MEET RANDOLPH-MACON: The Yellow Jackets have rolled their competition all season as only one game has been decided by a single possession – their first round game against Christopher Newport, 28-20. RMC's next closest outcome was a 35-12 win over Washington & Lee.\n\nRandolph-Macon averages just under 49 points per game and 493.8 yards of offense behind a balanced attack of 256 on the ground and 237 through the air. Its defense limits teams to 11.6 points and 228.5 yards, including just 54.9 on the ground.\n\nNick Hale is the go-to offensive threat for the Yellow Jackets as he has 20 rushing touchdowns on the season with 885 yards. Three other players will be significant contributors on the ground – Cameron Chatmon (579 yards, 7 TDs), Kwesi Clark (490 yards, 15 TDs) and Mitchell Johnson (448 yards, 9 TDs).\n\nDrew Campanale is one of the most accurate quarterbacks in Division III with a 69.4 completion percentage. Campanale has 2,200 yards and 19 touchdowns on the season. His main target is David Wallis with 795 yards on 31 receptions and nine touchdowns.\n\nThree of RMC's four linebackers in its 3-4 scheme lead the team in tackles. Neftali Reyes paces the unit with 59 tackles, while Jackson Deaver has 58 stops and Tony Skinner comes into Saturday's game with 50 tackles.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?: The winner moves onto the quarterfinals to play either Johns Hopkins on Union on December 2."
