Lee became the first ASC female golfer to win the conference championship in back-to-back years.\n\n\"We are so excited to be selected to play at the NCAA Division III Women's Golf Championship,\" LeTourneau head women's golf coach Lauren Gentry said. \"Leslie deserves this and has worked real hard at this opportunity. She will look to go and compete great and play to the best of her ability. I have got confidence she will do really well at this tournament.\"\n\nEleven conferences have been granted automatic qualification and the remaining nine teams were selected on an at-large basis from conferences and the remaining independent institutions. Six individuals, not from selected teams, also were selected for the championships.\n\nIn the 2010 field is the defending champions – Methodist University. Joining Methodist is Gustavus Adolphus College, George Fox University, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, DePauw University, Williams College, St. Mary's College (Indiana), Illinois Wesleyan University, St. Lawrence University, Southwestern University (Texas), Olivet College, Otterbein College, Allegheny College, Centre College, Washington University-St. Louis, Whitworth University, Wartburg College, Franklin College, Schreiner University and Carroll University.\n\nJoining Lee as individuals at the tournament is Jessica Urban (University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point), Kimberly Eaton (Wellesley College), Flora Weeks (Middlebury College), Kathryn Hauff (College of St. Benedict), Stephanie Mingos (Rhodes College).\n\nThe championship will consist of both team and individual competition conducted concurrently. The tournament consists of 72 holes of play over four days of competition. In the team competition, the low four scores from each team for each day will count in the team's total score.\n\nThe championships will be conducted May 11-14 at the Mission Inn Resort in Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla. Oglethorpe University and the Central Florida Sports Commission will serve as hosts."
