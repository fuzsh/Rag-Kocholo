        "text": "I. Purpose\n\nConsistent with its Non-Discrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Notice and the U.S. Department of Education's implementing regulations for Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\") (see 34 C.F.R. § 106 et seq.), Whitworth University (the \"university\") prohibits Sexual Harassment that occurs within its education programs and activities.\n\nAs further defined herein, Sexual Harassment includes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking.\n\nAdministrators, faculty members, staff, students, contractors, guests and other members of the university community who commit Sexual Harassment are subject to the full range of university discipline including verbal reprimand; written reprimand; mandatory training, coaching or counseling; mandatory monitoring; partial or full probation; partial or full suspension; fines; permanent separation from the institution (i.e., termination or dismissal); physical restriction from university property; cancellation of contracts; and any combination of the same.\n\nThe university will provide persons who have experienced Sexual Harassment ongoing supportive measures as reasonably necessary to restore or preserve access to the university's education programs and activities.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThis policy applies to Sexual Harassment that occurs within the university's Education Programs and Activities and that is committed by an administrator, faculty member, staff, student, contractor, guest or other member of the university's community.\n\nThis policy does not apply to Sexual Harassment that occurs off-campus, in a private setting, and outside the scope of the university's Education Programs and Activities; such Sexual Misconduct may be prohibited by the Student Code of Conduct, the Faculty Handbook, Employee Handbook, and other university policies and standards, as applicable, including the Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy and Complaint Resolution Procedure.\n\nConsistent with the U.S. Department of Education's implementing regulations for Title IX, this policy does not apply to Sexual Harassment that occurs outside the geographic boundaries of the United States, even if the Sexual Harassment occurs in the university's Education Programs and Activities, such as a study abroad program. Sexual Harassment that occurs outside the geographic boundaries of the United States is governed by the Student Code of Conduct, the Faculty Handbook, Employee Handbook, and other university policies and standards, as applicable, including the Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy and Complaint Resolution Procedure.\n\nIII. Definitions\n\nA. \"Sexual Harassment\" is conduct on the basis of sex that constitutes Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence or Stalking.\n\nB. \"Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment\" is an employee of the university conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit or service of the university on an individual's participation in unwelcome sexual contact.\n\nC. \"Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment\" is unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person access to the university's education programs and activities.\n\nIn determining whether Hostile Environment Sexual Harassment exists, the university will consider the totality of circumstances, including factors such as the actual impact the conduct has had on the Complainant; the nature and severity of the conduct at issue; the frequency and duration of the conduct; the relationship between the parties (including accounting for whether one individual has power or authority over the other); the respective ages of the parties; the context in which the conduct occurred; and the number of persons affected. A person's adverse subjective reaction to conduct is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish the existence of a hostile environment.\n\nHostile Environment Sexual Harassment may include, but is not limited to:\n\nUnwelcome efforts to develop a romantic or sexual relationship;\n\nUnwelcome commentary about an individual's body or sexual activities;\n\nThreatening to engage in the commission of an unwelcome sexual act with another person;\n\nEngaging in indecent exposure, voyeurism or other invasion of personal privacy;\n\nThreatening to publish intimate photos or videos of a person without consent;\n\nSending unwelcome and sexually explicit electronic messages; and\n\nUnwelcome physical touching or closeness that does not rise to the level of Sexual Assault.\n\nD. \"Sexual Assault\" includes the sex offenses of Rape, Fondling, Incest and Statutory Rape.\n\n\"Rape\" is the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus, with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. Attempted Rape is included.\n\n\"Fondling\" is the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of age or because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity.\n\n\"Incest\" is sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurred.\n\n\"Statutory Rape\" is sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent as defined by the law of the state where the sexual intercourse occurred.\n\nE. \"Dating Violence\" is violence committed by a person –\n\nWho is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim; and\n\nWhere the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors:\n\nThe length of the relationship;\n\nThe type of relationship; and\n\nThe frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\n\nF. \"Stalking\" is engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to:\n\nFear for their safety or the safety of others; or\n\nSuffer substantial emotional distress\n\nG. \"Consent\" is a verbal \"YES\" and refers to words or actions that a reasonable person in the perspective of the Respondent would understand as unambiguous permission to engage in the sexual conduct at issue. A person who is Incapacitated is not capable of giving consent. A person who is below the statutory age of consent is not capable of giving consent. Consent must be given voluntarily. It cannot be procured through physical violence, threats, blackmail or other unreasonable pressure for sexual activity. Consent to some form of sexual activity cannot be automatically taken as consent to any other form of sexual activity. Previous relationships or prior consent do not imply consent to future sexual acts. In order to give effective consent, a person must be of legal age.\n\nH. \"Incapacitated\" refers to the state where a person does not appreciate the nature or fact of sexual activity due to the effect of drugs or alcohol consumption, medical condition or disability, or due to a state of unconsciousness or sleep. In other words, the person is unable to understand the \"who, what, when, where, why and how\" of their sexual interaction and, as a result, cannot give effective consent. Incapacitation is something beyond mere drunkenness or intoxication. No single factor is determinative of incapacitation. Incapacitation can only be found when the Respondent knew or should have known that the Complainant was incapacitated when viewed from the position of a sober, reasonable person.\n\nI. \"Retaliation\" is intimidation, threats, coercion or discrimination against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX and its implementing regulations or because an individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, or participated or refused to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this policy.\n\nJ. \"Complainant\" means an individual who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment.\n\nK. \"Respondent\" means an individual who has been reported to be the perpetrator of conduct that could constitute Sexual Harassment.\n\nL. \"Formal Complaint\" means a document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX coordinator alleging Sexual Harassment against a Respondent and requesting that the university investigate the allegation of Sexual Harassment in accordance with this policy. If a Formal Complaint is filed by the Complainant, at the time of filing the Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in the university's education programs and activities. A \"document filed by a Complainant\" means a document or electronic submission (such as an email) that contains the Complainant's physical or electronic signature or otherwise indicates that the Complainant is the person filing the Complaint.\n\nM. \"Supportive Measures\" are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered, as appropriate, and reasonably available, and without fee or charge, that are designed to restore or preserve equal access to the university's Education Programs and Activities without unreasonably burdening another party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties implicated by a report or the university's education environment, or to deter Sexual Harassment. Supportive measures may include: counseling, extensions of academic or other deadlines, course-related adjustments, modifications to work or class schedules, campus escort services, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of campus, and other similar measures. Supportive Measures may also include mutual restrictions on contact between the parties implicated by a report.\n\nN. \"Education Programs and Activities\" refers to all the operations of the university, including, but not limited to, in-person and online educational instruction, employment, research activities, extracurricular activities, athletics, residence life, dining services, performances, and community engagement and outreach programs. The term applies to all activity that occurs on campus or on other property owned or occupied by the university. It also includes off-campus locations, events or circumstances over which the university exercises substantial control over the Respondent and the context in which the Sexual Harassment occurs, including Sexual Harassment occurring in any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the university.\n\nO. \"Restorative Practice\" means a practice relating to a specific harm that\n\nIs community based and un-affiliated with any civil or criminal legal process;\n\nIs initiated by a victim of the harm;\n\nInvolves, on a voluntary basis and without any evidence of coercion or intimidation of any victim of the harm by any individual who committed the harm or anyone associated with any such individual\n\nOne or more individuals who committed the harm;\n\nOne or more victims of the harm; and\n\nThe community affected by the harm through one or more representatives of the community\n\nShall include and has the goal of\n\nCollectively seeking accountability from one or more individuals who committed the harm;\n\nDeveloping a written process whereby one or more individuals who committed the harm will take responsibility for the actions that caused harm to one or more victims of the harm; and\n\nDeveloping a written course of action plan.\n\nShall include the goal of\n\nThat is responsive to the needs of one or more victims of the harm; and\n\nUpon which one or more victims, one or more individuals who committed the harm, and the community can agree; and\n\nIs conducted in a victim services framework that protects the safety and supports the autonomy of the one or more victims of the harm and the community.\n\nP. Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)\n\nWhitworth University is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for all members of its community. The university Violence Against Women’s Act (VAWA) policy aims to prevent and respond to incidents of violence against women, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.

Reporting Sexual Harassment\n\nA. Title IX Coordinator\n\nAny person may report Sexual Harassment to the Title IX coordinator. Reports may be made in person, by regular mail, telephone, electronic mail, or by any other means that results in the Title IX coordinator receiving the person's verbal or written report. In-person reports must be made during normal business hours, but reports can be made by regular mail, telephone or electronic mail at any time, including outside normal business hours.\n\nThe name and contact information for the Title IX coordinator is:\n\nRhosetta Rhodes\n\nTitle IX coordinator\n\nrrhodes@whitworth.edu\n\ntitleixcoordinator@whitworth.edu\n\n509.777.4536\n\n300 W. Hawthorne Road\n\nHUB #253\n\nSpokane, WA 99223\n\nB. University Reporting Officials\n\nIn addition to reporting to the Title IX coordinator, any person may report Sexual Harassment to any university employee with managerial authority over the university as a whole, or an academic or operational unit of the university (collectively \"Mandatory Reporters\") who must promptly forward such a report of Sexual Harassment directly to the Title IX coordinator.\n\nC. Online Reporting System (Including Anonymous Reporting)\n\nPersons may also use the university's online reporting system to report Sexual Harassment, which will generate a report that is sent directly to the Title IX coordinator. A person wishing to report anonymously can do so through the online reporting system. While the university will accept anonymous reports, they are not preferred because it is often difficult to gather sufficient information without the identity of the reporting party.\n\nD. U.S. Department of Education\n\nPersons may also file a complaint of Sexual Harassment with the United States Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights regarding an alleged violation of Title IX by visiting www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html or by calling 1-800-421-3481.\n\nE. Confidential Options\n\nA student who wishes to have a confidential conversation about Sexual Harassment should contact the counseling center at 509.777.3259, the health center at 509.777.3259 or spiritual life at 509.777.4568. An employee who wishes to have a confidential conversation about Sexual Harassment should contact the Employee Assistance Program by calling 1.800.523.5668.\n\nF. Community-Based Support and Advocacy Groups\n\nContact information for various community-based support and advocacy groups is available from the Title IX coordinator upon request. These outside groups are not required to report Sexual Harassment to the Title IX coordinator.\n\nV. Special Advice for Individuals Reporting Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence or Stalking\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence or Dating Violence, do everything possible to preserve evidence by making certain that the crime scene is not disturbed. Preservation of evidence may be necessary for proof of the crime or in obtaining a protection order. For those who believe that they are victims of Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence or Dating Violence, the university recommends the following:\n\nGet to a safe place as soon as possible.\n\nTry to preserve all physical evidence of the crime. Avoid bathing, using the toilet, rinsing one's mouth or changing clothes. If it is necessary, put all clothing that was worn at the time of the incident in a paper bag, not a plastic one.\n\nDo not launder or discard bedding where the assault occurred – preserve for law enforcement.\n\nPreserve all forms of electronic communication that occurred before, during or after the assault.\n\nContact law enforcement by calling 911.\n\nGet medical attention. All medical injuries are not immediately apparent. This is also necessary to collect evidence in case the individual decides to press charges. Local hospitals have evidence collection kits necessary for criminal prosecution should the victim wish to pursue charges. Take a full change of clothing, including shoes, for use after a medical examination.\n\nContact a trusted person, such as a friend or family member for support.\n\nTalk with a professional counselor or health care provider who can help explain options, give information and provide emotional support.\n\nMake a report to the Title IX coordinator.\n\nExplore this policy and avenues for resolution under this policy.\n\nIt is also important to take steps to preserve evidence in cases of Stalking, to the extent such evidence exists. Such evidence is more likely to be in the form of letters, emails, text messages, etc., rather than evidence of physical contact and violence. This type of non-physical evidence will also be useful in all types of Sexual Harassment investigations.\n\nOnce a report of Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence or Stalking is made, the victim has several options such as, but not limited to:\n\nObtaining Supportive Measures\n\nSeeking legal advice\n\nSeeking personal counseling (always recommended)\n\nFiling a Formal Complaint\n\nFiling a report with the police\n\nRequesting that no further action be taken\n\nVI. Preliminary Assessment\n\nUpon receipt of a report, the Title IX coordinator will conduct a preliminary assessment to determine:\n\nWhether the conduct, as reported, falls or could fall within the scope of the policy specified in Section II; and\n\nWhether the conduct, as reported, constitutes or could constitute Sexual Harassment\n\nIf the Title IX coordinator determines that the conduct reported could not fall within the scope of the policy, and/or could not constitute Sexual Harassment, even if investigated, the Title IX coordinator will close the matter and may notify the reporting party if doing so is consistent with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"). The Title IX coordinator may refer the report to other university offices, as appropriate, for resolution under other applicable policies and standards.\n\nIf the Title IX coordinator determines that the conduct reported could fall within the scope of the policy, and/or could constitute Sexual Harassment, if investigated, the Title IX coordinator will proceed to contact the Complainant as specified in Section VII.\n\nAs part of the preliminary assessment, the Title IX coordinator may take investigative steps to determine the identity of the Complainant, if such identity is not apparent from the report.\n\nVII. Contacting the Complainant\n\nIf a report is not closed as a result of the preliminary assessment specified in Section VI and the Complainant's identity is known, the Title IX coordinator will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss the availability of Supportive Measures specified in Section VIII; to discuss and consider the Complainant's wishes with respect to such Supportive Measures; to inform the Complainant of the availability of such Supportive Measures with or without filing a Formal Complaint; and to explain the process for filing and pursuing a Formal Complaint.\n\nVIII. Supportive Measures\n\nIf a report is not closed as a result of the preliminary assessment specified in Section VI, the university will offer and make available Supportive Measures to the Complainant regardless of whether the Complainant elects to file a Formal Complaint.\n\nContemporaneously with the Respondent being notified of a Formal Complaint specified in Section XIII, the Title IX coordinator will notify the Respondent of the availability of Supportive Measures for the Respondent, and the university will offer and make available Supportive Measures to the Respondent in the same manner in which it offers and makes them available to the Complainant. The university will also offer and make available Supportive Measures to the Respondent prior to the Respondent being notified of a Formal Complaint, if the Respondent requests such measures.\n\nThe university will maintain the confidentiality of Supportive Measures provided to either a Complainant or Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality does not impair the university's ability to provide the Supportive Measures in question.\n\nIX. Interim Removal\n\nAt any time after receiving a report of Sexual Harassment, the Title IX coordinator may remove a student Respondent from the university's education programs and activities on a temporary basis if an individualized safety and risk analysis determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of Sexual Harassment justifies removal. In the event the Title IX coordinator imposes an interim removal, the Title IX coordinator must offer to meet with the Respondent within twenty-four hours and provide the Respondent an opportunity to challenge the interim removal.\n\nIn the case of a Respondent who is a non-student employee (administrator, faculty or staff), and in its discretion, the university may place the Respondent on administrative leave at any time after receiving a report of Sexual Harassment, including during the pendency of the investigation and adjudication process specified in Sections XIV and XVI.\n\nFor all other Respondents, including independent contractors and guests, the university retains broad discretion to prohibit such persons from entering onto its campus and other properties at any time, and for any reason, whether after receiving a report of Sexual Harassment or otherwise.\n\nWhere the conduct referenced in a report of Sexual Harassment could constitute a violation of some other applicable policy or standard, irrespective of whether it constitutes Sexual Harassment, this Section IX shall in no way constrain the university's ability to take interim measures under the Student Code of Conduct, the Faculty Handbook, Employee Handbook, and other university policies and standards, as applicable, including the Non-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Policy and Complaint Resolution Procedure.\n\nX. Formal Complaint\n\nA Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX coordinator requesting that the university investigate and adjudicate a report of Sexual Harassment in accordance with the provisions of Sections XIV and XVI. Provided, however, that at the time the Complainant submits a Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in, or attempting to participate in, one or more of the university's education programs or activities.\n\nA Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX coordinator in person, by regular mail, or by email using the contact information specified in Section IV above.\n\nIn any case, including a case where a Complainant elects not to file a Formal Complaint, the Title IX coordinator may file a Formal Complaint on behalf of the university if doing so is not clearly unreasonable.\n\nIf the Complainant or the Title IX coordinator files a Formal Complaint, then the university will commence an investigation as specified in Section XIV and proceed to adjudicate the matter as specified in Section XVI.\n\nIn a case where the Title IX coordinator files a Formal Complaint, the Title IX coordinator will not act as a Complainant or otherwise as a party for purposes of the investigation and adjudication processes specified in Sections XIV and XVI.\n\nXI. Consolidation of Formal Complaints\n\nThe university may consolidate Formal Complaints as to allegations of Sexual Harassment against more than one Respondent, or by more than one Complainant against one or more Respondents, or by one party against the other party, where the allegations of Sexual Harassment arise out of the same facts or circumstances. Where the investigation and adjudication process involve more than one Complainant or more than one Respondent, references in this policy to the singular \"party,\" \"Complainant,\" or \"Respondent\" include the plural, as applicable. A Formal Complaint of Retaliation may be consolidated with a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment as specified in Section XXX.\n\nXII. Dismissal Prior to Commencement of Investigation\n\nIn a case where the Complainant files a Formal Complaint, the Title IX coordinator will evaluate the Formal Complaint and must dismiss it if the Title IX coordinator determines:\n\nThe conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not constitute Sexual Harassment, even if proved; or\n\nThe conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint falls outside the scope of the policy specified in Section II (i.e., because the alleged conduct did not occur in the university's Education Programs and Activities and/or the alleged conduct occurred outside the geographic boundaries of the United States).\n\nIn the event the Title IX coordinator determines the Formal Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to this Section XII, the Title IX coordinator will provide written notice of dismissal to the parties and advise them of their right to appeal as specified in Section XVIII. The Title IX coordinator may refer the subject matter of the Formal Complaint to other university offices, as appropriate.\n\nXIII. Notice of Formal Complaint\n\nWithin five (5) days of the Title IX coordinator receiving a Formal Complaint, the Title IX coordinator will transmit a written notice to the Complainant and Respondent that includes:\n\nA physical copy of this policy or a hyperlink to this policy;\n\nSufficient details known at the time so that the parties may prepare for an initial interview with the investigator, to include the identities of the parties involved in the incident (if known), the conduct allegedly constituting Sexual Harassment, and the date and location of the alleged incident (if known);\n\nA statement that the Respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged Sexual Harassment and that a determination of responsibility will not be made until the conclusion of the adjudication and any appeal;\n\nNotifying the Complainant and Respondent of their right to be accompanied by an advisor of their choice, as specified in Section XIX.\n\nNotifying the Complainant and Respondent of their right to inspect and review evidence as specified in Section XIV.D.\n\nNotifying the Complainant and Respondent of the university's prohibitions on retaliation and false statements specified in Sections XXIX and XXX.\n\nShould the university elect, at any point, to investigate allegations that are materially beyond the scope of the initial written notice, the university will provide a supplemental written notice describing the additional allegations to be investigated.\n\nXIV. Investigation\n\nA. Commencement and Timing\n\nAfter the written notice of Formal Complaint is transmitted to the parties, an investigator selected by the Title IX coordinator will undertake an investigation to gather evidence relevant to the alleged misconduct, including inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. The burden of gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination in the adjudication lies with the university and not with the parties. The investigation will culminate in a written investigation report, specified in Section XIV.E, that will be submitted to the adjudicator during the selected adjudication process.\n\nB. Equal Opportunity\n\nDuring the investigation, the investigator will provide an equal opportunity for the parties to be interviewed, to present witnesses (including fact and expert witnesses), and to present other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the investigator retains discretion to limit the number of witness interviews the investigator conducts if the investigator finds that testimony would be unreasonably cumulative, or if the witnesses are offered to render testimony that is categorically inadmissible, such as testimony concerning sexual history of the Complainant, as specified in Section XXI. The investigator will not restrict the ability of the parties to gather and present relevant evidence on their own.\n\nThe investigation is a party's opportunity to present testimonial and other evidence that the party believes is relevant to resolution of the allegations in the Formal Complaint. A party that is aware of and has a reasonable opportunity to present particular evidence and/or identify particular witnesses during the investigation, and elects not to, will be prohibited from introducing any such evidence during the adjudication absent a showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\n\nC. Documentation of Investigation\n\nThe investigator will take reasonable steps to ensure the investigation is documented. Interviews of the parties and witnesses may be documented by the investigator's notes, audio recorded, video recorded, or transcribed. The particular method utilized to record the interviews of parties and witnesses will be determined by the investigator in the investigator's sole discretion, although whatever method is chosen shall be used consistently throughout a particular investigation.\n\nD. Access to the Evidence\n\nAt the conclusion of the evidence-gathering phase of the investigation, but prior to the completion of the investigation report, the investigator will transmit to each party and their advisor, in either electronic or hard copy form, evidence obtained up to that point that is directly related to the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint, including evidence the university may choose not to rely on at any hearing and inculpatory or exculpatory evidence whether obtained from a party or some other source. Thereafter, the parties will have ten (10) days in which to submit to the investigator a written response, which the investigator will consider prior to completing the investigation report.\n\nE. Investigation Report\n\nAfter the period for the parties to provide any written response as specified in Section XIV.D has expired, the investigator will complete a written investigation report that fairly summarizes the various steps taken during the investigation, summarizes the relevant evidence collected, lists material facts on which the parties agree, and lists material facts on which the parties do not agree. When the investigation report is complete, the investigator will transmit a copy to the Title IX coordinator. The investigator will also transmit the investigation report to each party and their advisor, in either electronic or hard copy form.\n\nXV. Informal Resolution\n\nAfter the investigator has sent the investigation report to the parties, the Title IX coordinator will transmit to each party a notice advising the party of the two different adjudication processes specified in Section XVI. The notice will explain that the hearing process specified in Section XVI.A is the default process for adjudicating all Formal Complaints and will be utilized unless both parties voluntarily consent to administrative adjudication as specified in Section XVI.B as a form of informal resolution. The notice will be accompanied by a written consent to administrative adjudication and will advise each party that, if both parties execute the written consent to administrative adjudication, then the administrative adjudication process will be used in in lieu of the hearing process. Parties are urged to carefully review this policy (including the entirety of Section XVI), consult with their advisor, and consult with other persons as they deem appropriate (including an attorney) prior to consenting to administrative adjudication.\n\nEach party will have three (3) days from transmittal of the notice specified in this Section XV to return the signed written consent form to the Title IX coordinator. If either party does not timely return the signed written consent, that party will be deemed not to have consented to administrative adjudication and the Formal Complaint will be adjudicated pursuant to the hearing process.\n\nXVI. Adjudication\n\nA. Hearing Process\n\nThe default process for adjudicating Formal Complaints is the hearing process specified in this Section XVI.A. The hearing process will be used to adjudicate all Formal Complaints unless both parties' timely consent to administrative adjudication as specified in Section XV above.\n\n1. Hearing Officer\n\nAfter selection of the hearing process as the form of administrative adjudication, the Title IX coordinator will promptly appoint a hearing officer who will oversee the hearing process and render a determination of responsibility for the allegations in the Formal Complaint, at the conclusion of the hearing process. The Title IX coordinator will see that the hearing officer is provided a copy of the investigation report and a copy of all evidence transmitted to the parties by the investigator as specified in Section XIV.D.\n\n2. Hearing Notice and Response to the Investigation Report\n\nAfter the hearing officer is appointed by the Title IX coordinator, the hearing officer will promptly transmit written notice to the parties notifying the parties of the hearing officer's appointment; setting a deadline for the parties to submit any written response to the investigation report; setting a date for the pre-hearing conference; setting a date and time for the hearing; and providing a copy of the university's Hearing Procedures. Neither the pre-hearing conference, nor the hearing itself, may be held any earlier than ten (10) days from the date of transmittal of the written notice specified in this Section XVI.A.2.\n\nA party's written response to the investigation report must include:\n\nTo the extent the party disagrees with the investigative report, any argument or commentary regarding such disagreement;\n\nAny argument that evidence should be categorically excluded from consideration at the hearing based on privilege, relevancy, the prohibition on the use of sexual history specified in Section XXI, or for any other reason;\n\nA list of any witnesses that the party contends should be called to attend the hearing pursuant to an attendance notice issued by the hearing officer;\n\nA list of any witnesses that the party intends to bring to the hearing without an attendance notice issued by the hearing officer;\n\nAny objection that the party has to the university's Hearing Procedures;\n\nAny request that the parties be separated physically during the pre-hearing conference and/or hearing;\n\nAny other accommodations that the party seeks with respect to the pre-hearing conference and/or hearing;\n\nThe name and contact information of the advisor who will accompany the party at the pre-hearing conference and hearing;\n\nIf the party does not have an advisor who will accompany the party at the hearing, a request that the university provide an advisor for purposes of conducting questioning as specified in Section XIX.\n\nA party's written response to the investigation report may also include:\n\nArgument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; and\n\nArgument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint constitute Sexual Harassment.\n\n3. Pre-Hearing Conference\n\nPrior to the hearing, the hearing officer will conduct a pre-hearing conference with the parties and their advisors. The pre-hearing conference will be conducted live, with simultaneous and contemporaneous participation by the parties and their advisors, provided, however, that a party may request, and the hearing officer may determine in their own discretion, to conduct the pre-hearing conference by way of proximate, separate meetings with each respective party and the party's advisor. By default, the pre-hearing conference will be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology.\n\nDuring the pre-hearing conference, the hearing officer will discuss the hearing procedures with the parties; address matters raised in the parties' written responses to the investigation report, as the hearing officer deems appropriate; discuss whether any stipulations may be made to expedite the hearing; discuss the witnesses the parties have requested be served with notices of attendance and/or witnesses the parties plan to bring to the hearing without a notice of attendance; and resolve any other matters that the hearing officer determines, in the hearing officer's discretion, should be resolved before the hearing.\n\n4. Issuance of Notices of Attendance\n\nAfter the pre-hearing conference, the hearing officer will transmit notices of attendance to any University employee (including administrator, faculty, or staff) or student whose attendance is requested at the hearing as a witness. The notice will request the subject to appear at the hearing at the specified date and time and advise the subject to contact the hearing officer immediately if there is a material and unavoidable conflict.\n\nThe subject of an attendance notice should notify any manager, faculty member, coach or other supervisor, as necessary, if attendance at the hearing will conflict with job duties, classes, or other obligations. All such managers, faculty members, coaches, and other supervisors are required to excuse the subject of the obligation, or provide some other accommodation, so that the subject may attend the hearing as specified in the notice.\n\nThe university has no authority to compel the attendance of any witness who is not an employee or a student, and a notice of attendance will not be issued to any such individual.\n\n5. Hearing\n\nAfter the pre-hearing conference, the hearing officer will convene and conduct a hearing pursuant to the university's Hearing Procedures. The hearing will be audio or video recorded. The recording will be made available to the parties for inspection and review on reasonable notice, including for use in preparing any subsequent appeal.\n\nThe hearing will be conducted live, with simultaneous and contemporaneous participation by the parties and their advisors. By default, the hearing will be conducted with the hearing officer, the parties, the advisors, witnesses, and other necessary University personnel together in the same physical location. However, upon request of either party, the parties will be separated into different rooms with technology enabling the parties to participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by video and audio.\n\nIn the hearing officer's discretion, the hearing may be conducted virtually, by use of video and audio technology, where all participants participate simultaneously and contemporaneously by use of such technology.\n\nWhile the Hearing Procedures and rulings from the hearing officer will govern the particulars of the hearing, each hearing will include, at a minimum:\n\nOpportunity for each party to address the hearing officer directly and to respond to questions posed by the hearing officer;\n\nOpportunity for each party's advisor to ask directly, orally, and in real time, relevant questions, and follow up questions, of the other party and any witnesses, including questions that support or challenge credibility;\n\nOpportunity for each party to raise contemporaneous objections to testimonial or non-testimonial evidence and to have such objections ruled on by the hearing officer and a reason for the ruling provided;\n\nOpportunity for each party to submit evidence that the party did not present during the investigation due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\n\nOpportunity for each party to make a brief closing argument.\n\nExcept as otherwise permitted by the hearing officer, the hearing will be closed to all persons except the parties, their advisors, the investigator, the hearing officer, the Title IX coordinator, and other necessary University personnel. With the exception of the investigator and the parties, witnesses will be sequestered until such time as their testimony is complete.\n\nDuring the hearing, the parties and their advisors will have access to the investigation report and evidence that was transmitted to them pursuant to Section XIV.D.\n\nWhile a party has the right to attend and participate in the hearing with an advisor, a party and/or advisor who materially and repeatedly violates the rules of the hearing in such a way as to be materially disruptive, may be barred from further participation and/or have their participation limited, as the case may be, in the discretion of the hearing officer.\n\nSubject to the minimum requirements specified in this Section XVI.A.5, the hearing officer will have sole discretion to determine the manner and particulars of any given hearing, including with respect to the length of the hearing, the order of the hearing, and questions of admissibility. The hearing officer will independently and contemporaneously screen questions for relevance in addition to resolving any contemporaneous objections raised by the parties and will explain the rationale for any evidentiary rulings.\n\nThe hearing officer will have discretion to modify the Hearing Procedures, when good cause exists to do so, and provided the minimal requirements specified in this Section XVI.A.5 are met.\n\nThe hearing is not a formal judicial proceeding and strict rules of evidence do not apply.\n\n6. Subjection to Questioning\n\nIn the event that any party or witness refuses to attend the hearing, or attends but refuses to submit to questioning by the parties' advisors, the statements of that party or witness, as the case may be, whether given during the investigation or during the hearing, will not be considered by the hearing officer in reaching a determination of responsibility.\n\nIn applying this Section XVI.A.6, the hearing officer will not draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party or a witness's absence from the live hearing and/or refusal to submit to questioning by the parties' advisors.\n\n7. Deliberation and Determination\n\nAfter the hearing is complete, the hearing officer will objectively evaluate all relevant evidence collected during the investigation, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, together with testimony and non-testimony evidence received at the hearing, and ensure that any credibility determinations made are not based on a person's status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness. The hearing officer will take care to exclude from consideration any evidence that was ruled inadmissible at the pre-hearing conference, during the hearing, or by operation of Section XVI.A.6. The hearing officer will resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., \"more likely than not\") standard and reach a determination regarding whether the facts that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence constitute one or more violations of the policy as alleged in the Formal Complaint.\n\n8. Discipline and Remedies\n\nIn the event the hearing officer determines that the Respondent is responsible for violating this policy, the hearing officer will, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with an appropriate university official with disciplinary authority over the Respondent and such official will determine any discipline to be imposed. The hearing officer will also, prior to issuing a written decision, consult with the Title IX coordinator who will determine whether and to what extent ongoing support measures or other remedies will be provided to the Complainant.\n\n9. Potential Consequences and Sanctions\n\nStudent members of the Whitworth community who are found responsible for violating a Whitworth policy are subject to disciplinary sanctions. Actual consequences may vary, depending upon the severity of the behavior and the previous conduct of the student. A range of sanctions is listed below.\n\nEducational Sanctions\n\nSuspension in Abeyance\n\nBehavioral Suspension\n\nExpulsion\n\n10. Written Decision\n\nAfter reaching a determination and consulting with the Title IX coordinator as required by Section XVI.A.8, the hearing officer will prepare a written decision that will include:\n\nIdentification of the allegations potentially constituting Sexual Harassment made in the Formal Complaint;\n\nA description of the procedural steps taken by the university upon receipt of the Formal Complaint, through issuance of the written decision, including notification to the parties, interviews with the parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather non-testimonial evidence, and the date, location, and people who were present at or presented testimony at the hearing;\n\nArticulate findings of fact, made under a preponderance of the evidence standard, that support the determination;\n\nA statement of, and rationale for, each allegation that constitutes a separate potential incident of Sexual Harassment, including a determination regarding responsibility for each separate potential incident;\n\nThe discipline determined by the appropriate University official as referenced in Section XVI.A.8 and any ongoing support measures or other remedies as determined by the Title IX coordinator; and\n\nA description of the university's process and grounds for appeal, as specified in Section XVIII.\n\nThe hearing officer's written determination will be transmitted to the parties. Transmittal of the written determination to the parties concludes the hearing process, subject to any right of appeal as specified in Section XVIII.\n\nAlthough the length of each adjudication by hearing will vary depending on the totality of the circumstances, the university strives to issue the hearing officer's written determination within fourteen (14) days of the conclusion of the hearing.\n\nB. Administrative Adjudication (Optional)\n\nIn lieu of the hearing process, the parties may consent to have a Formal Complaint resolved by administrative adjudication as a form of informal resolution. Administrative adjudication is voluntary and must be consented to in writing by both parties and approved by the Title IX coordinator as specified in Section XV.\n\nIf administrative adjudication is selected, the Title IX coordinator will appoint an administrative officer. The Title IX coordinator will see that the administrative officer is provided a copy of the investigation report and a copy of all the evidence transmitted to the parties by the investigator as specified in Section XIV.D.\n\nThe administrative officer will promptly send written notice to the parties notifying the parties of the administrative officer's appointment; setting a deadline for the parties to submit any written response to the investigation report; and setting a date and time for each party to meet with the administrative officer separately. The administrative officer's meetings with the parties will not be held any earlier than ten (10) days from the date of transmittal of the written notice specified in this paragraph.\n\nA party's written response to the investigation report must include:\n\nTo the extent the party disagrees with the investigation report, any argument or commentary regarding such disagreement;\n\nAny argument that a particular piece or class of evidence should be categorically excluded from consideration based on privilege, relevancy, the prohibition on the use of sexual history specified in Section XXI, or for any other reason;\n\nArgument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; and\n\nArgument regarding whether any of the allegations in the Formal Complaint constitute Sexual Harassment.\n\nAfter reviewing the parties' written responses, the administrative officer will meet separately with each party to provide the party with an opportunity to make any oral argument or commentary the party wishes to make and for the administrative officer to ask questions concerning the party's written response, the investigative report, and/or the evidence collected during the investigation.\n\nAfter meeting with each party, the administrative officer will objectively reevaluate all relevant evidence, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence and ensure that any credibility determinations made are not based on a person's status as a Complainant, Respondent, or witness. The administrative officer will take care to exclude from consideration any evidence that the administrative officer determines should be ruled inadmissible based on the objections and arguments raised by the parties in their respective written responses to the investigation report. The administrative officer will resolve disputed facts using a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., \"more likely than not\") standard and reach a determination regarding whether the facts that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence constitute one or more violations of the policy as alleged in the Formal Complaint.\n\nThereafter, the administrative officer will consult with any university official and the Title IX coordinator, in the manner specified in Section XVI.A.8 and will prepare and transmit a written decision in the manner as specified in Section XVI.A.9 which shall serve as a resolution for purposes of informal resolution.\n\nTransmittal of the administrative officer's written determination concludes the administrative adjudication, subject to any right of appeal as specified in Section XVIII.\n\nAlthough the length of each administrative adjudication will vary depending on the totality of the circumstances, the university strives to issue the administrative officer's written determination within twenty-one (21) days of the transmittal of the initiating written notice specified in this Section XVI.B.\n\nXVII. The Dismissal During Investigation or Adjudication\n\nThe university may dismiss a Formal Complaint at any point during the investigation or adjudication process if the Title IX coordinator determines that any one or more of the following is true:\n\nThe Complainant provides the Title IX coordinator written notice that the Complainant wishes to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed);\n\nThe Respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by the university, as the case may be; or\n\nSpecific circumstances prevent the university from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint, or any discrete allegations therein (in which case those discrete allegations may be dismissed).\n\nThe university shall dismiss a Formal Complaint at any point during the investigation or adjudication process if the Title IX coordinator determines that any one or more of the following is true:\n\nThe conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not constitute Sexual Harassment, even if proved; or\n\nThe conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint falls outside the scope of the policy specified in Section II (i.e., because the alleged conduct did not occur in the university’s Education Programs and Activities and/or the alleged conduct occurred outside the geographic boundaries of the United States).\n\nIn the event the Title IX coordinator determines that a Formal Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to this Section XVII the Title IX coordinator will provide written notice of dismissal to the parties and advise them of their right to appeal as specified in Section XVIII. The Title IX coordinator may refer the subject matter of the Formal Complaint to other university offices, as appropriate.\n\nXVIII. Appeal\n\nEither party may appeal the determination of an adjudication, or a dismissal of a Formal Complaint, on one or more of the following grounds:\n\nA procedural irregularity affected the outcome;\n\nThere is new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination or dismissal was made, that could have affected the outcome;\n\nThe Title IX coordinator, investigator, hearing officer, or administrative officer, as the case may be, had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally, or against the individual Complainant or Respondent, that affected the outcome.\n\nNo other grounds for appeal are permitted.\n\nA party must file an appeal within seven (7) days of the date they receive notice of dismissal or determination appealed from or, if the other party appeals, within thee (3) days of the other party appealing, whichever is later.\n\nThe appeal must be submitted in writing to the Title IX coordinator who will refer it to the appeal officer.\n\nThe appeal must specifically identify the determination and/or dismissal appealed from, articulate which one or more of the three grounds for appeal are being asserted, explain in detail why the appealing party believes the appeal should be granted, and articulate what specific relief the appealing party seeks.\n\nPromptly upon receipt of an appeal, the appeal officer will conduct an initial evaluation to confirm that the appeal is timely filed and that it invokes at least one of the permitted grounds for appeal. If the appeal officer determines that the appeal is not timely, or that it fails to invoke a permitted ground for appeal, the appeal officer will dismiss the appeal and provide written notice of the same to the parties.\n\nIf the appeal officer confirms that the appeal is timely and invokes at least one permitted ground for appeal, the appeal officer will provide written notice to the other party that an appeal has been filed and that the other party may submit a written opposition to the appeal within seven (7) days. The appeal officer shall also promptly obtain from the Title IX coordinator any records from the investigation and adjudication necessary to resolve the grounds raised in the appeal.\n\nUpon receipt of any opposition, or after the time period for submission of an opposition has passed without one being filed, the appeal officer will promptly decide the appeal and transmit a written decision to the parties that explains the outcome of the appeal and the rationale.\n\nThe determination of a Formal Complaint, including any discipline, becomes final when the time for appeal has passed with no party filing an appeal or, if any appeal is filed, at the point when the appeal officer has resolved all appeals, either by dismissal or by transmittal of a written decision.\n\nNo further review beyond the appeal is permitted.\n\nAlthough the length of each appeal will vary depending on the totality of the circumstances, the university strives to issue the appeal officer's written decision within (21) days of an appeal being filed.\n\nXIX. Advisor of Choice\n\nFrom the point a Formal Complaint is made, and until an investigation, adjudication and appeal are complete, the Complainant and Respondent will have the right to be accompanied by an advisor of their choice to all meetings, interviews and hearings that are part of the investigation, adjudication, and appeal process.\n\nExcept for the questioning of witnesses during the hearing specified in Section XVI.A.5, the advisor will play a passive role and is not permitted to communicate on behalf of a party, insist that communication flow through the advisor, or communicate with the university about the matter without the party being included in the communication. In the event a party's advisor of choice engages in material violation of the parameters specified in this Section XIX and Section XVI.A.5, the university may preclude the advisor from further participation, in which case the party may select a new advisor of their choice.\n\nIn the event a party is not able to secure an advisor to attend the hearing specified in Section XVI.A.5, the university will provide the party an advisor, without fee or charge, who will conduct questioning on behalf of the party at the hearing. The university will have sole discretion to select the advisor it provides.\n\nThe university is not required to provide a party with an advisor in any circumstance except where the party does not have an advisor present at the hearing specified in Section XVI.A.5.\n\nXX. Treatment Records and Other Privileged Information\n\nDuring the investigation and adjudication processes, the investigator and adjudicator, as the case may be, are not permitted to access, consider, disclose, permit questioning concerning or otherwise use:\n\nA party's records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional or paraprofessional's capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party; or\n\nInformation or records protected from disclosure by any other legally-recognized privilege, such as the attorney client privilege;\n\nunless the university has obtained the party's voluntary, written consent to do so for the purposes of the investigation and adjudication process.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the investigator and/or adjudicator, as the case may be, may consider any such records or information otherwise covered by this Section XX if the party holding the privilege affirmatively discloses the records or information to support their allegation or defense, as the case may be.\n\nXXI. Sexual History\n\nDuring the investigation and adjudication processes, questioning regarding a Complainant's sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the Complainant's prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the Respondent committed the conduct alleged, or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the Complainant's prior sexual behavior with respect to the Respondent and are offered to prove consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Complainant who affirmatively uses information otherwise considered irrelevant by this Section XXI for the purpose of supporting the Complainant's allegations, may be deemed to have waived the protections of this Section XXI.\n\nXXII. Informal Resolution\n\nAt any time after the parties are provided written notice of the Formal Complaint as specified in Section XIII, and before the completion of any appeal specified in Section XVIII, the parties may voluntarily consent, with the Title IX coordinator's approval, to engage in mediation, facilitated resolution, or other form of dispute resolution the goal of which is to enter into a final resolution resolving the allegations raised in the Formal Complaint by agreement of the parties. Administrative Adjudication as specified in Section XVI.B is a form of informal resolution.\n\nThe specific manner of any informal resolution process will be determined by the parties and the Title IX coordinator, in consultation together. Prior to commencing the informal resolution process agreed upon, the Title IX coordinator will transmit a written notice to the parties that:\n\nDescribes the parameters and requirements of the informal resolution process to be utilized;\n\nIdentifies the individual responsible for facilitating the informal resolution (who may be the Title IX coordinator, another university official, or a suitable third-party);\n\nExplains the effect of participating in informal resolution and/or reaching a final resolution will have on a party's ability to resume the investigation and adjudication of the allegations at issue in the Formal Complaint; and\n\nExplains any other consequence resulting from participation in the informal resolution process, including a description of records that will be generated, maintained, and/or shared.\n\nAfter receiving the written notice specified in this paragraph, each party must voluntarily provide written consent to the Title IX coordinator, before the informal resolution may commence.\n\nDuring the pendency of the informal resolution process, the investigation and adjudication processes that would otherwise occur are stayed and all related deadlines are suspended.\n\nIf the parties reach a resolution through the informal resolution process, and the Title IX coordinator agrees that the resolution is not clearly unreasonable, the Title IX coordinator will reduce the terms of the agreed resolution to writing and present the resolution to the parties for their written signature. Once both parties and the Title IX coordinator sign the resolution, the resolution is final, and the allegations addressed by the resolution are considered resolved and will not be subject to further investigation, adjudication, remediation, or discipline by the university, except as otherwise provided in the resolution itself, absent a showing that a party induced the resolution by fraud, misrepresentation, or where required to avoid a manifest injustice to either party or to the university. Notwithstanding the forgoing if the form of informal resolution is Administrative Adjudication as specified in Section XVI.B, there shall not be an agreed resolution requiring the parties' signatures; instead, the determination issued by the administrative officer shall serve as the resolution and conclude the informal resolution process, subject only to any right of appeal. With the exception of a resolution resulting from the Administrative Adjudication process specified in Section XVI.B, all other forms of informal resolution pursuant to this Section XXII are not subject to appeal.\n\nA party may withdraw their consent to participate in informal resolution at any time before a resolution has been finalized.\n\nAbsent extension by the Title IX coordinator, any informal resolution process must be completed within twenty-one (21) days. If an informal resolution process does not result in a resolution within twenty-one (21), and absent an extension, abeyance or other contrary ruling by the Title IX coordinator, the informal resolution process will be deemed terminated, and the Formal Complaint will be resolved pursuant to the investigation and adjudication procedures. The Title IX coordinator may adjust any time periods or deadlines in the investigation and/or adjudication process that were suspended due to the informal resolution.\n\nOther language in this Section XXII notwithstanding, informal resolution will not be permitted in any form if the Respondent is a non-student employee accused of committing Sexual Harassment against a student.\n\nXXIII. Presumption of Non-Responsibility\n\nAs required by U.S. Department of Education's regulations implementing Title IX, from the time a report or Formal Complaint is made, as the case may be, the university will adopt a presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the alleged misconduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made final.\n\nXXIV. Conflicts of Interest, Bias and Procedural Complaints\n\nThe Title IX coordinator, investigator, hearing officer, administrative officer, appeals officer and informal resolution facilitator will be free of any material conflicts of interest or material bias. Any party who believes one or more of these university officials has a material conflict of interest or material bias must raise the concern promptly so that the university may evaluate the concern and find a substitute, if appropriate.\n\nXXV. Objections Generally\n\nParties are expected to raise any objections, concerns or complaints about the investigation, adjudication and appeals process in a prompt and timely manner so that the university may evaluate the matter and address it, if appropriate. The failure of a party to timely raise an objection, concern or complaint may result in a waiver of the issue for purposes of any appeal specified in Section XVIII or otherwise.\n\nXXVI. Relationship with Criminal Process\n\nThis policy sets forth the university's processes for responding to reports and Formal Complaints of Sexual Harassment. The university's processes are separate, distinct, and independent of any criminal processes. While the university may temporarily delay its processes under this policy to avoid interfering with law enforcement efforts if requested by law enforcement, the university will otherwise apply this policy and its processes without regard to the status or outcome of any criminal process.\n\nXXVII. Recordings\n\nWherever this policy specifies that an audio or video recording will be made, the recording will be made only by the university and is considered property of the university, subject to any right of access that a party may have under this policy, FERPA, and other applicable federal, state, or local laws. Only the university is permitted to make audio or video recordings under this policy. The surreptitious recording of any meeting, interview, hearing or other interaction contemplated under this policy is strictly prohibited. Any party who wishes to transcribe a hearing by use of a transcriptionist must seek pre-approval from the hearing officer.\n\nXXVIII. Vendors, Contractors and Third Parties\n\nThe university does business with various vendors, contractors, and other third-parties who are not students or employees of the university. Notwithstanding any rights that a given vendor, contractor, or third-party Respondent may have under this policy, the university retains its right to limit any vendor, contractor, or third-party's access to campus for any reason. And the university retains all rights it enjoys by contract or law to terminate its relationship with any vendor, contractor or third-party irrespective of any process or outcome under this policy.\n\nXXIX. Bad Faith Complaints and False Information\n\nIt is a violation of this policy for any person to submit a report or Formal Complaint that the person knows, at the time the report or Formal Complaint is submitted, to be false or frivolous. It is also a violation of this policy for any person to knowingly make a materially false statement during the course of an investigation, adjudication, or appeal under this policy. Violations of this Section XXIX are not subject to the investigation and adjudication processes in this policy; instead, they will be addressed under the Student Code of Conduct, the Faculty Handbook, and other university policies and standards, as applicable.\n\nXXX. Retaliation\n\nIt is a violation of this policy to engage in Retaliation. Reports and Formal Complaints of retaliation may be made in the manner specified in Sections IV and X. Any report or Formal Complaint of Retaliation will be processed under this policy in the same manner as a report or Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment, as the case may be. The university retains discretion to consolidate a Formal Complaint of Retaliation with a Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment for investigation and/or adjudication purposes if the two Formal Complaints share a common nexus.\n\nXXXI. Confidentiality\n\nThe university will keep confidential the identity of any individual who has made a report or Formal Complaint of Sexual Harassment or Retaliation including any Complainant, the identity of any individual who has been reported to be a perpetrator of Sexual Harassment or Retaliation including any Respondent, and the identity of any witness. The university will also maintain the confidentiality of its various records generated in response to reports and Formal Complaints, including, but not limited to, information concerning Supportive Measures, notices, investigation materials, adjudication records, and appeal records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the university may reveal the identity of any person or the contents of any record if permitted by FERPA; if necessary to carry out the university's obligations under Title IX and its implementing regulations including the conduct of any investigation, adjudication, or appeal under this policy or any subsequent judicial proceeding; or as otherwise required by law. Further, notwithstanding the university's general obligation to maintain confidentiality as specified herein, the parties to a report or Formal Complaint will be given access to investigation and adjudication materials in the circumstances specified in this policy.\n\nWhile the university will maintain confidentiality specified in this Section XXXI, the university will not limit the ability of the parties to discuss the allegations at issue in a particular case. Parties are advised, however, that the manner in which they communicate about, or discuss a particular case, may constitute Sexual Harassment or Retaliation in certain circumstances and be subject to discipline pursuant to the processes specified in this policy.\n\nXXXII. Other Policy Violations\n\nAlleged violations of university policy, other than violations of the prohibitions on Sexual Harassment and Retaliation, will be subject to review under the Student Code of Conduct, the Faculty Handbook, Employee Handbook and other university policies and standards, as applicable.\n\nXXXIII. Signatures and Form of Consent\n\nFor purposes of this policy, either a physical signature or digital signature will be sufficient to satisfy any obligation that a document be signed. Where this policy provides that written consent must be provided, consent in either physical or electronic form, containing a physical or digital signature, as the case may be, will suffice.\n\nXXXIV. Deadlines, Time, Notices and Method of Transmittal\n\nWhere this policy specifies a period of days by which some act must be performed, the following method of calculation applies:\n\nExclude the day of the event that triggers the period;\n\nCount every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays recognized by the federal government;\n\nInclude the last day of the period until 5 p.m. central time, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday recognized by the federal government, the period continues to run until 5 p.m. pacific standard time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday recognized by the federal government.\n\nAll deadlines and other time periods specified in this policy are subject to modification by the university where, in the university's sole discretion, good cause exists. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, the unavailability of parties or witnesses; the complexities of a given case; extended holidays or closures; sickness of the investigator, adjudicator, or the parties; the need to consult with the university's legal counsel; unforeseen weather events; and the like.\n\nAny party who wishes to seek an extension of any deadline or other time period may do so by filing a request with the investigator, hearing officer, administrative officer, appeal officer, or Title IX coordinator, as the case may be, depending on the phase of the process. Such request must state the extension sought and explain what good cause exists for the requested extension. The university officer resolving the request for extension may, but is not required to, give the other party an opportunity to object. Whether to grant such a requested extension will be in the sole discretion of the university.\n\nThe parties will be provided written notice of the modification of any deadline or time period specified in this policy, along with the reasons for the modification.\n\nWhere this policy refers to notice being given to parties \"simultaneously,\" notice will be deemed simultaneous if it is provided in relative proximity on the same day.
