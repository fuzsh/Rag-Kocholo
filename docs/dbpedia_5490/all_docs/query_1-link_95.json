        "text": "Senior Leo Castillo leads returns to lead Willamette after a 56th-place finish at nationals last fall.\n\nMatt McGuirk was amazed when he arrived at Willamette University in 2001 to take over the men’s cross country team and assist with track. “It was eye-opening that the times weren’t faster,” he recalls. “I couldn’t believe we didn’t have one guy who could run sub-4:00 for 1500m that first season. When I was running at South Eugene [High School] we had 10 or 12 guys who were at 4:10 or faster.”\n\nThe subsequent decade has produced significant changes at the Salem, Ore., school. This past spring not one but four Willamette runners ran sub-4:00 in the 1500, so the quality has gone up considerably. And McGuirk, who now serves as head men’s and women’s cross country and track and field coach, is a bit more understanding about Division III athletics.\n\n“I went to the University of Oregon to run,” he explains, “and I happened to get an education along the way. At a school like Willamette, the kids are here first of all because of the outstanding academic opportunities. So you get a varying degree of commitment on the athletic teams. We have some highly competitive people, and we have some who just like being on a team, and then there’s everything in between.”\n\nMcGuirk, 46, grew up in Eugene where he was a prep standout at perennial distance power South Eugene High. In 1982 he anchored the 4 x 1500m relay team in 3:54.5, helping the Axemen establish a national high school record of 16:03.7 that still stands today. Progressing to the University of Oregon, McGuirk played a key role in the Ducks’ 1984 NCAA Division I track title. And he put together a fine post-collegiate career, achieving U.S. top-10 steeplechase rankings in 1992, 1993 and 1994 and finishing seventh in the 1992 U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nA stint of middle school coaching jobs during his elite competitive years convinced McGuirk that he’d like to continue coaching at some level after his own career had ended. He coached at Wilsonville High in suburban Portland for four years before the position at Willamette opened up, and he hasn’t looked back. “This is my world now and I love it,” he says. “The goal is to take everyone who wants to be here and help them improve, and have them keep enjoying it after they leave Willamette.”\n\nThere’s no doubt that McGuirk’s teams have been enjoying their consistent success, the men’s cross country squad in particular. The Bearcats have been NCAA Division III West region champions seven of the past nine years and have placed as high as fifth at nationals on two occasions (2002 and 2004). McGuirk was named NCAA Division III Men’s National Coach of the Year in 2004.\n\nCross country training at Willamette is neither heavy on the mileage nor is it particularly speed-oriented. “We’re certainly not a high-volume program,” McGuirk notes. “I’ve seen too many guys overdo on the mileage. They feel great and then all of a sudden they don’t. Once you lose that, it’s hard to get it back. So we want to be healthy, fit and excited about opportunities, not wishing the season was over already.”\n\nMcGuirk does emphasize regular long runs and is particular about being sure his athletes incorporate hills into nearly every run they do. Last year a key workout was a session of hill repeats with fast 200s mixed in. This was done a week out from regionals and McGuirk felt it was beneficial. “But we don’t have what you’d term a go-to workout; every team and every season is different.”\n\nThis fall the Bearcats will count heavily on senior standouts Leo Castillo, a definite All-American prospect (56th at nationals last year), and Ben Donovan (186th at nationals). Other key returning members of last fall’s team include Kevin Aubol and Parker Bennett, and McGuirk looks for a strong season from sophomore Kit Kingstad, a former pole vaulter and intermediate hurdler who has converted to running distance. “We’re going to rely a lot on freshmen and sophomores,” the coach explains. “There are a lot of question marks right now.”\n\nThe first team goal is winning the Northwest Conference title on Oct. 29. Last fall Willamette was edged by Whitworth by a mere three points, a bitter pill to swallow. Winning the West regional again may be a tall order, but that’s the plan. “Our region advances two teams automatically but we’ve sent three most years,” McGuirk says. “Still, you can’t count on that, so we need to finish in the top two.”\n\nOver the years McGuirk has coached the likes of Nick Symmonds (a 2006 graduate who was a seven-time NCAA Division III national champion at 800m and 1500m and a varsity cross country runner; currently U.S. No. 1 at 800m and fifth in the 800m at last month’s world championships) and Sarah Zerzan (the 2006 and 2007 NCAA Division III cross country national champion). McGuirk admits it’s great working with national-caliber talent, but says that’s not a requirement for enjoying his job. Luckily for McGuirk, he seems to have the best of both worlds at Willamette.\n\nTop Teams\n\nNorth Central – The Cardinals, coached by the legendary Al Carius (now in his 46th year at North Central), have won 20 national cross country championships. Perhaps even more amazingly, North Central has finished off the podium (i.e., outside the top four) a mere four times since Division III cross country was established in 1973. Two seniors have been lost from last year’s squad, including third-place finisher Michael Spain, but this team looks to be as strong as ever in 2011 with juniors Matthew Perez, a transfer from Oklahoma State, and Dan Kerley, leading the way.\n\nCalvin – Coached by 1984 Olympic bronze steeplechaser Brian Diemer, the Knights are four-time national champions and have been on the podium no fewer than 13 times. They’ve won the Great Lakes regional 15 straight years and appear a shoe-in for No. 16. Depth is a bit of a question mark this fall, but Calvin’s top five are solid and they have one of the nation’s best in senior Nick Kramer.\n\nHaverford – The Fords were last year’s champions but lost individual winner Anders Hulleberg as well as their No. 2, 3 and 6 finishers from their nationals team. Nevertheless, this consistently strong outfit appears to have reloaded quite well. Veteran coach Tom Donnelly, now in his 37th season, has a rare knack for developing talent, so look for Haverford to challenge for another podium finish. Junior Jordan Schilit (31st at nationals last year) leads the way.\n\nTop Runners\n\nBen Sathre, sr., St. Thomas, second at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships. Also: fifth in 5,000m (14:29.84) at indoor nationals; injuries curtailed outdoor season. Sathre’s coach, Pete Wareham, was also NCAA DIII cross country runner-up as a St. Thomas junior and came back to place third as a senior. Sathre would naturally like to surpass Wareham’s record and perhaps win it all. A return to full strength will certainly put Sathre in the individual title hunt this November.\n\nSteve Kiplagat, sr., St. Lawrence, fourth at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships. Also: 58th at 2008 XC nationals (second freshman). Although Kiplagat’s fourth-place finish last fall can’t be discounted, he produced nothing of note during indoor or outdoor track seasons. He clearly has the ability to run with the best.\n\nNate Stymiest, sr., UW-Oshkosh (pictured at right), seventh at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships. Also: 59th at 2008 XC nationals (third freshman). Stymiest recorded fine marks of 3:51.68 for 1500m and 14:23.73 for 5,000m before disappointing at outdoor nationals (20th in 15:55.87). On his home course, the senior must be considered a legitimate threat to win it all.\n\nLee Berube, sr., SUNY-Geneseo, eighth at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships. Also: 77th at 2008 XC nationals (fourth freshman) and 106th at 2009 XC nationals; seventh in 5,000m (14:32.14) at indoor nationals and seventh in 5,000m (14:47.09) at outdoor nationals. Consistent and very experienced, Berube should be up among the leaders late in the race.\n\nOthers to Watch\n\nNick Kramer, sr., Calvin, 16th at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships. Also: third in steeplechase (8:56.04) and fourth in 5,000m (14:44.75) at outdoors nationals. This very experienced senior had the kind of track season that makes him a good prospect for a top-five finish.\n\nMichael Burnstein, sr., Washington, 30th at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships. Also: third in 10,000m (30:29.69) at outdoor nationals.\n\nMatthew Perez, so., North Central, 26th at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships (highest-placing freshman).\n\nLeo Castillo, sr., Willamette, 56th at 2010 NCAA DIII cross country championships. Also: ran a 30:38.01 10,000m PR at the Willamette Invitational; 15th in 10,000m (32:11.18) at outdoor nationals.\n\nNoteworthy\n\nWisconsin-Oshkosh will host the 2011 NCAA Division III Cross Country Nationals on Nov. 19. The men’s team will be led by first-year head coach Paul Brown, who replaces long-time Titan coach John Zupanc. Brown served as an assistant to Zupanc last fall and now has the heavy responsibility of guiding one of Division III’s most successful programs. The Titans have won four national titles (1998, 1989, 1990, 2002) and have qualified as a team for the national championships 20 of the past 25 years. The Oshkosh women also have a new coach in Liz Kujawa (née Woodworth), who steps in for Zupanc’s wife, Deb Vercauteren, who also enjoyed a highly successful run as a Titan coach. Kujawa was an outstanding athlete at Oshkosh from 2000-2004, winning nine national titles, and was a two-time NCAA Division III cross country runner-up (2003 and 2004).\n\nQuoteworthy\n\nHaverford, the defending national champions, coached by Tom Donnelly, are currently ranked No. 2 in the nation behind North Central. In talking to the Philadelphia Inquirer, he said it takes a while to really understand what a student-athlete's ability and training capacity is. \"They don't know what they're capable of, and I certainly don't know, either,\" Donnelly said. \"It usually takes me about a year to sort of get a sense of how much a kid can take and how much he can't. I think in general, from almost any athlete, you're going to get better results by slightly under-doing what they can do. I always say, just because somebody can do something, they can literally do a workout, doesn't mean that's the best thing for them.\"\n\nKey Meets\n\nSept. 30: Paul Short Invitational, Leigh University, Leigh, PA\n\nA huge event featuring three men’s collegiate races. Several of the top Division III schools match up with each other and compete against all levels of Division I and Division II talent.\n\nOct. 1: 37th Annual Charles Bowles Willamette Invitational, Willamette University, Salem, OR\n\nA good opportunity for some of the West’s top Division III talent to match up against each other and also several Division I and Division II teams.\n\nOct. 15: UW-Oshkosh Brooks Invitational, UW-Oshkosh, Winneconne, WI\n\nAt last a half dozen of the best from the Midwest and Great Lakes regions will be on hand, racing on the Lake Breeze Golf Course that will host Division III Nationals on Nov. 19.\n\nOct. 29: Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) Championships, UW-Stout, Menomonie, WI\n\nThe WIAC is arguably the nation’s top Division III conference on the men’s side and put three schools in the top 11 at nationals last fall. , unless you favor the…\n\nOct. 30: Centennial Conference Championships, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD\n\nHaverford and Dickinson, No. 1 and No. 5 in the nation last fall and always two of the very best, are sure to battle it out up front.\n\nNov. 12: NCAA Division III Regionals\n\nIt’s make it or break it at the penultimate races of the season at these eight NCAA DIII regional meets around the U.S.: Atlantic (Canton, N.Y.), Central (Waverly, Iowa), Great Lakes (Oberlin, Ohio), Mideast (Center Valley, Pa.), Midwest (Rock Island, Ill.), New England (Brunswick, Maine), South/Southeast (Sequin, Texas), West (Claremont, Calif.). All eight regional meets will be great, but the one Augustrana College hosts on the Sauki Golf Course in Rock Island, Ill., stands out every year.\n\nNov. 19: NCAA Division III National Championships, Lake Breeze Golf Course, Winneconne, WI\n\nHosted by Wisconsin-Oshkosh, this year’s NCAA DIII championships will be held on fast and smooth terrain with a few moderate rolling hills. The women will run roughly two loops en route to the 3.5-mile finish line, while the men will run just under three loops en route to the 8K finish line.\n\n2010 NCAA DIII Cross Country Championships\n\nTeams\n\n1. Haverford 87\n\n2. North Central 104\n\n3. St. Lawrence 137\n\n4. Wisc-Platteville 198\n\n5. Dickinson 204"
