        "text": "Mind & Heart Newsletter: May 2017\n\nAn update from Whitworth University President Beck A. Taylor\n\nI'm finishing my seventh year as Whitworth's president. What an incredible privilege and journey! That means this is my 70th Mind & Heart newsletter. I can think of no better way to acknowledge this milestone than to sing the praises of the woman whose tremendous skill and dedication have been the backbone of this publication â and of so many other projects at Whitworth â since President Emeritus Bill Robinson began this monthly newsletter, in 1993. Terry Mitchell's incredible skill and devotion in compiling and editing the content in Mind & Heart have helped Bill and me to communicate effectively with all of you, and, more important, to express eloquently the pillars of Whitworth's mission. Simply put, Terry â who will retire this month, after 34 years at Whitworth â edits almost everything I write, and in doing so, she helps me to communicate more effectively and persuasively what's in my heart. I will be eternally grateful, as will Bill, who wrote, \"Terry not only helped me with Mind & Heart, she edited 99 percent of all the public messages I wrote. She had to do it, because as far as I know, she was the only person at Whitworth who shared my twisted sense of humor and grammar fetish. In fact, when I asked her to review a rewrite on Leading People from the Middle, she did a much better job than the first publisher had done. My biggest compliments came when people suspected her of being the real writer of Mind & Heart. While she never did the actual writing, she always made me a better writer. For that and more, I pay deep, affectionate tribute to a dear friend with whom I released 169 issues of Mind & Heart and never split an infinitive!\" Terry, on behalf of Bill and me, thank you for all you've meant to us, and to the Whitworth family. God bless you!\n\nAcademics\n\nAt Giveapalooza, a one-day event hosted by Beyond the Pines, Whitworth's student-run public-relations agency, students spent the day working on PR projects including logo redesigns, transferring a website to a new platform, and creating social-media strategies.

More information about these programs is available online at www.whitworth.edu/gradtheology.\n\nThe Arts\n\nBen Brody (Music) led an effort that resulted in a new e-collection of 46 hymns, titled Singing Welcome: Hymns and Songs of Hospitality to Refugees and Immigrants.

I'll have the privilege of shaking approximately 750 hands as graduates receive their Whitworth diplomas this weekend. Each new alum is a gift from God, and I wish them Christ's blessings as they begin exciting new life chapters. We will miss them, but their positive impact on our campus will be felt for years to come. They will be Whitworthians for life. Go, Bucs!"
