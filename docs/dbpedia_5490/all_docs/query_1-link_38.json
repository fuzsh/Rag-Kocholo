        "text": "CLEVELAND -- The National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) announced the Association's Hall of Fame Class of 2024. The list of inductees includes: Bob Boerigter, Northwest Missouri State University; Gary Broadhurst, Mohawk Valley Community College; Clint Bryant, Augusta University; Jeff Hathaway, University of Connecticut; Lynn Hickey, Eastern Washington University; Jerry Hughes, University of Central Missouri; Jim Murphy, Davidson College; and Greg Waggoner, Western Colorado University. The group of deserving individuals will be honored in conjunction with the 59th Annual NACDA & Affiliates Convention at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, Nev., at the beginning of the Association-Wide Featured Session on Monday, June 10, starting at 4 p.m.\n\nBob Boerigter, Northwest Missouri State University\n\nAfter 45 years of service to the intercollegiate athletics enterprise, Dr. Bob Boerigter retired January 31, 2017.\n\nBoerigter earned a bachelor's degree in physical education from Northwestern College (Iowa) and began his career in collegiate athletics at his alma mater in 1972, where he assumed the role of basketball, baseball, football and golf coach. In 1974, he earned a master of arts from the University of Northern Colorado and followed that with a Ph.D. from the University of Utah in 1978.\n\nThroughout his career, Boerigter served as director of athletics at five institutions, including: Whitworth College (Washington), Northwestern College, Adams State University (Colorado), Hastings College (Nebraska) and Northwest Missouri State University. Boerigter guided the Bearcat athletics department from 2001-10, also overseeing recreational sports, club sports, campus recreation and the campus fitness center in an era that saw Northwest capture 20 MIAA championships.\n\nDuring his time in the AD chair, Boerigter served in multiple capacities on the national level. He was named Chair of the Division II Football Committee, served as a member of the Division II Championships Committee and the Planning and Finance Committee, as well as on many other association-wide and Division II task forces. He also was the Chair of the Division II Management Council and served as a member of the NCAA Executive Committee. Boerigter served as a D2 ADA Board Member from 2003-08.\n\nIn 2010, he was appointed as the fourth full-time commissioner of the MIAA. During his time with the MIAA, he implemented an expansion program of both full-time and associate members to the conference. He oversaw the MIAA Centennial in 2012, serving as a principal figure in attracting NCAA National Championships to sites within the MIAA membership. As commissioner, Boerigter guided the conference through an era of immense success that saw the MIAA produce 10 national championships in six different sports.\n\nBoerigter was named the NAIA Athletics Administrator of the Year in 1993 and was inducted into the Hastings College Hall of Fame in 2008. He was also named Kansas City's Sports Executive of the Year by the Kansas City Sports Commission. Boerigter received the D2 ADA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018, and in 2023, was inducted into both the Northwest Missouri State M-Club Hall of Fame and the MIAA Hall of Fame.\n\nGary Broadhurst, Mohawk Valley Community College\n\nGary Broadhurst retired in 2022 after over 43 years at Mohawk Valley Community College (MVCC), finishing his career as dean of athletics. He directed one of the most extensive, diverse, and successful two-year college intercollegiate athletics programs in the country.\n\nBroadhurst began his career at MVCC in 1979 as a technical assistant. He was promoted to the faculty ranks in 1988 before his appointment as director of athletics in 1996. During his tenure he served as head coach of both the men's and women's basketball programs, the men's and women's bowling teams, softball, and golf programs. He has taught almost every course in the department's curriculum, including several certification courses in the American Red Cross, American Heart Association, and National Safety Council organizations. He is recognized by the State Education Department as a certified instructor in the state's coaching certificate curriculum.\n\nUnder Broadhurst's leadership at MVCC, the Hawks captured 20 NJCAA National Championships, 81 Region III Championships and 144 Mountain Valley Conference titles. MVCC student-athletes were selected as NJCAA All-Americans 484 times, 1,329 were recognized as All-Region and an astounding 172 were individual NJCAA National Champions. Six student-athletes earned NATYCAA Scholar-Athlete of the Year, more than any other institution in the nation, and 34 were chosen for the SUNY Chancellor's Scholar-Athlete of the Year. The Hawks won the inaugural NATYCAA Cup in 2004 in the non-scholarship division and never finished lower than 15th in the history of the national award.\n\nCurrently, Broadhurst is on the NJCAA Foundation Board of Directors, and previously served on the NJCAA Board of Regents, chaired numerous NJCAA committees, and served as both the Men's and Women's Regional Director and Chair of the region's Executive Committee for over 10 years.\n\nBroadhurst was NATYCAA President in 2011-12 during the Association's 25th anniversary. He also served as treasurer of the organization until his retirement. Broadhurst was a member of the NACDA Executive Committee from 2008-12.\n\nBroadhurst has been the recipient of numerous awards during his career including the NATYCAA L. William Miller Award (2015), NACDA Athletics Director of the Year (2007, 2012, 2016 and 2019), the NJCAA Loyalty Award (2019-20), the SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Professional Service, and was selected by his peers for the inaugural NJCAA Region III Athletics Director of the Year. Most recently he received the NJCAA Appreciation Award, recognizing superior contributions to the Association. He is also being inducted into the NATYCAA Hall of Fame this year.\n\nClint Bryant, Augusta University\n\nAfter 34 years of leading the Augusta University (Georgia) department of athletics, Clint Bryant retired on June 30, 2022.\n\nUnder Bryant's leadership, Augusta's programs enjoyed success on and off the playing fields and courts, bringing home national, regional and conference championships. Named NACDA Athletics Director of the Year (ADOY) in 2006-07 and selected to the NCAA's Division II 40th anniversary team for his standout efforts, Bryant made a name for himself throughout the state and region. To commemorate Bryant's legacy at Augusta, the court at Christenberry Fieldhouse was renamed the Clint L. Bryant Court.\n\nBryant oversaw the 13-sport athletics department at Augusta for more than three decades and promoted an environment focused on student success. In addition to program additions and facility upgrades, Augusta enjoyed unprecedented success, especially over Bryant's last several seasons at the helm, with numerous teams qualifying for NCAA regional competition, while 28 of the teams earned national rankings in their respective sports. Augusta men's golf won back-to-back Division I NCAA National Championships in 2010 and 2011, and an individual men's golf NCAA National Championship in 2018. Bryant ended his historic career with the Augusta volleyball team reaching the NCAA Elite Eight for the first time in school history and the men's basketball team reaching the National Championship Game.\n\nDuring his administrative tenure, Bryant was a member of various national committees, including serving two terms on the NCAA Division II Management Council, eventually being appointed to chair. He also served on the NCAA Legislation Committee, Division II Budget and Finance Committee, and was chairman of the Championships Committee and the NCAA Basketball Rules Committee.\n\nThroughout his more than 45-year career as a collegiate administrator and coach, Bryant has been recognized for his impactful leadership at Augusta University and throughout the community. He has served the Kiwanis Club of Augusta, the United Way of the CSRA on its Board of Directors, a Past President of the 100 Black Men of Augusta, Inc. and a past Honorary Chairman of the National Kidney Foundation of Georgia.\n\nBryant is one of the founding fathers of MOAA and served as the Association's first President from 2000-10. This year, he is also being recognized with the D2 ADA Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nBryant was inducted into the Belmont Abbey College (North Carolina) Hall of Fame in 2013, where he was a four-year student-athlete on the men's basketball team and received a bachelor's degree in business management in 1977. He later obtained a master's degree from Clemson. After a standout coaching career that included stops at Clemson (1977-84), Miami (1984-88) and Augusta State (1988-97), Bryant became the director of athletics at Augusta.\n\nJeff Hathaway, University of Connecticut\n\nJeff Hathaway served as the director of athletics at the University of Connecticut from 2003-11. Hathaway played a vital role in UConn's success story for nearly 20 years as he was the senior associate athletics director prior to being named executive associate director of athletics at the school from 1990-2001.\n\nDuring his time at UConn, Hathaway and his staff negotiated the university's first ever department-wide apparel contract resulting in a $46 million agreement with NIKE. Hathaway also negotiated UConn's first ever multimedia/corporate partnership contract with IMG which guaranteed more than $80 million with the opportunity for additional revenue sharing.\n\nNine national championships were won during his tenure – five in women's basketball, three in men's basketball and one in men's soccer. In his vision for program success, Hathaway continuously evaluated ways to enhance the student-athlete experience such as building the state-of-the-art football office complex, including an indoor practice facility, that served many of UConn's sports. In addition, Hathaway initiated construction of a women's and men's basketball practice facility. The UConn football program was the first university to transition from Division I-AA to participation in a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game when they accepted an invitation to play Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl. Hathaway served on the NCAA Football Post-Season Committee which had the responsibility to manage the annual certification of all bowl games. He also served a five-year term as a member of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee and was selected by his Committee peers to be the Chair in 2011-12.\n\nDuring the last capital campaign of Hathaway's UConn tenure, the athletics program generated over $71 million before his departure – more than any other campus entity at that time. The Huskies also consistently attained a 99 percent academic retention rate among their student-athletes.\n\nIn his two years away from the Storrs campus, Hathaway enjoyed a successful tenure as the director of athletics at Colorado State University from 2001-03. The football team played in two bowl games, men's basketball won the Mountain West Conference championship that earned the first NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament bid in 13 years, the women's team played in the NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament in 2002, and advanced to the 2003 WNIT semi-finals along with championships in other sports. In addition, Colorado State athletics received a gift of $15.2 million to renovate and expand the football stadium.\n\nAfter his time at UConn, Hathaway served as the vice president / director of athletics at Hofstra University from 2012-18, where he led an outstanding athletics program that enjoyed tremendous success in the classrooms, competitive venues and in the personal development of its student-athletes.\n\nHathaway represented the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) on the inaugural NCAA Division I Council while also serving as the Chair of the NCAA Men's Basketball Oversight Committee. He was selected to serve on the Commission on Basketball chaired by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nDuring his six-year tenure at Hofstra, there were 15 teams that qualified for NCAA Tournaments, eight CAA postseason championships, 10 regular season CAA titles and four other postseason tournaments including their first NIT appearance in nine years. Hathaway initiated upgrades in facilities, particularly the construction of a much-needed basketball practice facility. Hofstra's student-athletes established a single semester athletics department record by posting an average GPA of 3.3 and an academic year record of a 3.29 average GPA in 2016-17. Hofstra's program established an athletics department record for Academic Progress Rates (APR) with 13 of its 17 teams earning perfect 1,000 single year scores.\n\nPrior to becoming an AD, Hathaway also spent eight years working at his alma mater, the University of Maryland, in a variety of athletics administrative roles.\n\nHathaway was a member of the NACDA Executive Committee from 2008-11 and earned NACDA Athletics Director of the Year (ADOY) honors in 2006-07, 2009-10 and 2014-15. Currently, he is co-owner and managing partner of CarrSports Consulting LLC focusing on executive searches for athletics directors and coaches along with consulting projects for universities.\n\nLynn Hickey, Eastern Washington University\n\nLynn Hickey dedicated 50 years to higher education and intercollegiate athletics before retiring on May 30, 2023. The beginning of her career coincided with the start of Title IX, and Hickey was a pioneer as one of the first women to play, coach and then administer collegiate sports.\n\nHickey served as associate vice president/director of athletics at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) for 18 years, from 1999-2017. She led the Roadrunners to three conference commissioner's cups, two league all-sports trophies and team and individual academic and athletics awards in all 17 sports programs at the university. During Hickey's tenure, UTSA competed in the Southland Conference from 2000-12, during which time it added women's golf, women's soccer and football, then moved to the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) where it played for a year before joining Conference USA in 2013. In Hickey's first year the athletics budget at UTSA was under $2 million, but upon her departure the operating budget had grown to $28 million.\n\nUTSA made history in 2011 when it brought NCAA Division I football to San Antonio. Since that time, the Roadrunners have drawn more than one million fans to their home games. In 2016, the Roadrunners were invited to their first bowl game, the Gildan New Mexico Bowl.\n\nIn addition to being the only female Division I athletics director to oversee both men's and women's sports in the state of Texas, Hickey served as president of the Southland from 2002-04 and as the league's representative to the NCAA Championship/Competition Cabinet. Hickey was also a member of the Women's Basketball Rules Committee from 2003-06, spending the final two years of that term as Chair. In 2007, she was named to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee, one of the most prestigious appointments in all of collegiate athletics. Most recently she served on the NCAA Nominations Committee, serving as Chair of that group in 2022.\n\nHickey was named NACDA Athletics Director of the Year (ADOY) in 2005-06 and was a member of the NACDA Executive Committee from 2015-17. She was named NACWAA (now Women Leaders in Sports) Division I-AAA Administrator of the Year in 2005.\n\nFollowing her time at UTSA, Hickey came to Eastern Washington University (EWU) in 2018 to lead an athletics department that includes 14 intercollegiate sports, six for men and eight for women. The department is designed to be an integral component of the campus community, while also enhancing the value, image and visibility of the university throughout the nation. Those values were exemplified as the department navigated challenges presented by the pandemic. Hickey advocated for Eastern to remain in the Big Sky as a Division I program, rebuilt the department staff and hired eight head coaches, and ensured student-athletes competed both in the classroom and on the courts and fields.\n\nDuring her five-year tenure at EWU, the football team competed in the FCS Championship game, won two Big Sky men's basketball regular season championships and one Big Sky postseason championship, had appearances in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament and the NIT, and won the Big Sky President's Cup.\n\nIn 2023, Hickey was a member of the inaugural class for the UTSA Athletics Hall of Fame and she was also inducted into the Texas A&M Hall of Honor. She served Texas A&M for 15 years (1984-99) as both the head coach for the women's basketball team and the senior woman administrator (SWA) and senior associate athletics director. Before her stint at A&M, Hickey was head women's basketball coach at Kansas State University from 1979-84. She was inducted into the Kansas State Athletics Hall of Fame in September 2004. Hickey is also a member of the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2021.\n\nJerry Hughes, University of Central Missouri (posthumous)\n\nJerry Hughes, who dedicated more than 40 years to laying the foundation for successes that included regional and national athletics championships, improved sports playing facilities, and the recruitment of thousands of outstanding student-athletes at the University of Central Missouri (UCM), passed away January 21, 2023, after a brief illness.\n\nHughes, who served as vice president for intercollegiate athletics, graduated from UCM in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in physical education, having lettered for the Mules golf team during his undergraduate studies, and he received his master's degree in secondary school administration in 1979. He joined the university that same year as a business placement director, became assistant athletics director in July 1981, and athletics director in January 1983. This launched a tenure as head of athletics that lasted four decades and enabled him to garner numerous awards exemplifying his far-reaching impact on collegiate sports.\n\nHughes' dedication to quality athletics teams resulted in many forms of recognition for the Mules and Jennies. Under his leadership, Central Missouri won 179 Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) championships entering the fall 2022 semester, 10 national championships, had 50 other top-four NCAA finishes, and made more than 300 NCAA postseason appearances. The Central Missouri athletics program also won the MIAA All-Sports Trophy each year from 1998-99 (the year of the award's inception) until the award was discontinued in 2002-03 and took home the first two MIAA Commissioner's Cups following the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons and again in 2019-20 and 2020-21. UCM finished second in the LEARFIELD Directors' Cup in 2010-11, the best finish in university and MIAA history after finishing third the previous two years.\n\nAside from his work at UCM, Hughes held multiple leadership positions for committees in Division II athletics. He served on the NCAA Executive Committee and as chairman of the Division II Championships Committee. He also served a term as NCAA Vice President for Division II and has been a member of the NCAA Council, making him the only person to twice hold the highest-ranking office available to athletics administrators in NCAA Division II. Other NCAA committees on which he served are the Membership Structure Committee, Administrative Committee, and Post-Season Football Subcommittee. He chaired the NCAA Division II Management Council and Membership Growth Project Team and was a member of the NCAA Budget and Finance Committee and NCAA Administrative Review Panel, as well as the LEARFIELD Directors' Cup Committee.\n\nHughes was the founder of the Las Vegas High Desert Classic, served as regional director of the Show-Me State Games, and was a member of the Governor's Council for Physical Fitness and Health. Hughes was also inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 2005 and named a Missouri Sports Legend, the highest honor bestowed by the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nA member of the NACDA Executive Committee from 1995-99, Hughes was recognized by the Association as Athletics Director of the Year (ADOY) in 1998-99, 2001-02, 2010-11 and 2015-16. In 2022, he was given the D2 CCA Award of Merit, reserved for individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the entire NCAA Division II membership and the Division II student-athlete experience.\n\nJim Murphy, Davidson College\n\nJim Murphy served as director of athletics at Davidson College for nearly 25 years before stepping down in February 2018 to take on a new role advising on finance and operations. Murphy was first introduced as Davidson's director of athletics in November 1995, returning to his alma mater on the eve of its 100th anniversary of intercollegiate athletics.\n\nEach aspect of athletics at Davidson reflects Murphy's leadership. The Carol Grotnes Belk Turf Field for field hockey, the Alumni Stadium for soccer, Wilson Baseball Park and practice facility, the football stadium expansion project, the relocation of the outdoor tennis courts, and the Harry L. Vance Athletic Center, including the Cheryle Williamson Center for Dance, all came during his tenure. Davidson teams won 25 regular season titles and 32 tournament championships with Murphy at the helm of the athletics programs. He oversaw Davidson's move to the Atlantic-10 Conference, where Davidson athletes have met with success in swimming, tennis and track and field.\n\nUnder Murphy's direction, the Wildcats pursued several major construction and capital projects, including the creation of the innovative $10 million Davidson Scholars Program, a state-of-the-art weight room, new press box and additional permanent seating as part of facility enhancements.\n\nMost importantly, Murphy ensured that Davidson's Division I athletics program served the long-term aspirations of the college's scholar-athletes and furthered Davidson's holistic educational mission.\n\nOn the national stage, Murphy served two terms on the prestigious NCAA Division I Management Council. He chaired the Division I-AA Governance Committee and formerly served on the NCAA Division I Business and Finance Cabinet, the Division I Governance Committee and the Division I Finance Committee.
