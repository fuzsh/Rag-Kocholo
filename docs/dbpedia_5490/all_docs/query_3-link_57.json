        "text": "Aspiring college athletes have no shortage of options when it comes to schools. The NCAA offers three divisions of college sports at over 1,000 colleges, providing an appropriate level of competition for almost any athlete. If you’re thinking about playing sports in college, don’t miss our complete list of NCAA schools and more information about what each division has to offer.\n\nWhat is the NCAA?\n\nNCAA stands for the National Collegiate Athletic Association and it is a nonprofit, member-led organization that provides college level athletic play for more than 52,000 athletes across 24 sports in three divisions.\n\nMember representatives serve on committees that develop and refine rules and policies surrounding college sports. These include everything from rules of play to the protocol for formal athletic recruitment. Part of the NCAA’s primary role is to ensure that college athletes are treated fairly and not exploited.\n\nThe NCAA is committed to the following seven core values:\n\nThe collegiate model of athletics in which students balance their academic, social and athletic experiences.\n\nThe highest levels of integrity and sportsmanship.\n\nThe pursuit of excellence in both academics and athletics.\n\nThe supporting role that intercollegiate athletics plays in the higher education mission and in enhancing the sense of community of member institutions.\n\nAn inclusive culture that fosters equitable participation for student-athletes and career opportunities for coaches and administrators.\n\nRespect for institutional autonomy and philosophical differences.\n\nPresidential leadership of intercollegiate athletics at the campus, conference and national levels.\n\nWhy are there NCAA Divisions?\n\nNCAA’s three divisions aim to account for the varying degrees of competition and opportunity from one college to another. They allow college athletes of varying abilities to play at levels that are competitive for them. In addition, eligibility standards for scholarships and admissions vary according the division.\n\nWhat Makes Division I Unique?\n\nDivision I schools tend to be large universities with highly competitive, well-funded athletic programs. The mean undergraduate enrollment of a Division I school is 9,895, and only one in 25 students at a Division I school will typically be an athlete.\n\nDivision I schools have the most autonomy when it comes to recruitment, scholarships, and admissions. These schools can recruit athletes specifically for their abilities, and are allowed to offer scholarships and admissions acceptance even if the athlete would not normally meet the standards for acceptance to the school. 58% of athletes competing in Division I athletics receive some type of athletic scholarship.\n\nTo qualify to play Division I sports, you must meet minimum course and GPA requirements in high school. There are 16 core courses, ones that you will likely take or have taken anyways because of state graduation requirements. You must receive at least a 2.3 GPA in your core courses.\n\nYou can learn more about the eligibility standards to play NCAA Division I athletics on the NCAA website.\n\nWhat Makes Division II Unique?\n\nDivision II schools tend to be mid-sized. They have decently funded athletic programs and are allowed to recruit some athletes and offer partial athletic scholarships. Division II schools have a mean undergraduate enrollment of 2,514 and one in 11 students at a Division II school is typically an athlete.\n\nThe athletic eligibility standards for Division II schools are slightly less stringent than Division I schools. There are still 16 required high school courses, but the courses are a bit more flexible. The GPA requirement is also slightly lower, at 2.2. Furthermore, partial qualifiers are still allowed to practice and receive scholarships. To learn more about the eligibility standards for Division II, read the NCAA’s Play Division II Sports guidelines.\n\nWhat Makes Division III Unique?\n\nDivision III schools tend to be smaller, with an average undergraduate enrollment of just 1,736, and about one of every six students at a Division III school is an athlete. Division III athletic play tends to be well-balanced with academics, as Division III rules minimize potential conflicts between athletics and academics and focus on regional in-season and conference play.\n\nThe NCAA does not set eligibility requirements for Division III athletes. Instead, each athlete is expected to meet the admissions standards at each individual school. No athletic scholarships are offered through Division III."
