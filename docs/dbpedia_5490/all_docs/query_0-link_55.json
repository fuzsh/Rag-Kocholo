        "text": "Indianapolis, IN – The NCAA announced its Division III men's and women's cross country team and individual qualifiers Sunday, as decided by the Track and Field and Cross Country Committee and for the first time in program history the State University of New York at New Paltz will have more than one individual represented at the national meet.\n\nSeniors Emily Cavanagh and Matt Whitworth, and junior Cassandra Williams all earned a spot at the NCAA Division III National Championship Nov. 23 in Louisville, KY. Cavanagh becomes the first Hawk to make multiple appearances, while Whitworth is the first male to qualify.\n\nCavanagh etched her name into nationals after placing sixth overall Saturday at the Atlantic Regional meet with a time of 22 minutes, 36.7 seconds, while Williams and Whitworth each placed 16th in their races with times of 23:05.6 and 25:42.9, respectively.\n\nThirty-two teams were selected to participate with the top two, seven-person teams automatically qualifying from each of the eight regions, totaling 16 teams. Sixteen additional teams were selected for an at-large with 56 individuals also qualifying. The first seven male and female runners from each region who were not a part of the qualifying team were selected to participate.\n\nCavanagh and Williams will compete in the women's 6K race at 11:45 a.m. at Tom Sawyer State Park, while Whitworth will run in the 8K slated for 10:45 a.m.\n\nTo view the official NCAA press release announcing all teams and individuals, click here.\n\nTo stay up to date with everything #NPHawks be sure to follow us on Twitter at @nphawks, Instagram and Facebook at @newpaltzhawks, and subscribe to our Youtube channel, New Paltz Hawks."
