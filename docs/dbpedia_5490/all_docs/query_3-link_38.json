Under Mark's leadership, Asbury became members of NCAA DIII and the NCCAA, had several student-focused enhancements to athletics facilities, and was named the NCCAA's #KingChasing Institution of the Year this past year. Prior to Asbury, Mark served on the Southeastern Conference staff for 27 years in roles that include Director of Media Relations and Associate Commissioner for External Affairs. He participated in the SEC's media rights negotiations with ESPN and CBS, which also resulted in the launch of the SEC Network.\n\nIn this episode, Mark shares about his time working in the SEC, Asbury's over two-week long revival, and ways that he integrates Christ within the athletic department."
