        "text": "President's Office\n\nMind & Heart Newsletter: June 2023\n\nAn update from Whitworth University President Scott McQuilkin\n\nThe renowned theologian Martin Luther said this about our work, and in consideration of whatever vocational aptitudes and interests we bring to bear: \"These are the masks of God, behind which He wants to remain concealed and do all things.\" In whatever line of service we find ourselves, whether teaching, crunching numbers, counseling patients, sowing and planting crops – whatever – behind that labor, Luther suggests, is a God who is at work and whose work it truly is. (Although I suppose this doesn't include my first paying job at the age of 5, for a $5 payday, clad in plaid, as a Sears runway model.) Well, what to do with Luther's assertion?\n\nJust over two weeks ago at our graduate and undergraduate commencement ceremonies, as students walked toward me after hearing their names called, in the presence of proud and grateful families and friends, I was aware of how they would depart their Whitworth experience: empowered through their vocational gifts and personal attributes to help make society, although not perfect, better. Whitworth graduates have been equipped to help the people they encounter flourish and the spaces they occupy better for their presence. On this side of glory, we will not triumph in all ways. We can't. And yet (and yet!) our students, stewards of their God-given smarts, trained and educated in their fields of study, and infused by the love and guidance of their professors and mentors, will no doubt be an extension of this holy God, who is perhaps concealed, yet who works through Whitworth graduates. Had Luther only known then that he was writing about the robed and capped students I encountered onstage, incredibly capable instruments for the Lord's greater purposes.\n\n16 Spring Term Highlights\n\nWe were thrilled to honor the Class of 2023 over Commencement Weekend May 20-21. One hundred and fifty-seven graduate students and 615 undergraduates celebrated their transition from Whitworth students to alumni. We held ceremonies in the Pine Bowl in keeping with our new tradition. Associate Professor of Communication Studies and Associate Dean of the College of Arts & Sciences Erica Salkin, voted a \"Most Influential Professor\" by the graduating class, delivered the undergraduate commencement address, \"Small Acts of Courage.\"\n\nWhitworth's legacy of producing Fulbright finalists continues. Congratulations to Kyra Furuta '23! The mathematics and secondary education double major has been chosen as a Fulbright finalist for the English Teaching Assistant (ETA) award in South Korea.\n\nWhitworth launched the School of Health Sciences in April to house our expanding health science programs. The school is comprised of our undergraduate health sciences department, Master of Science in Athletic Training program, pre-nursing program, and doctoral programs in occupational and physical therapy. Mike Ediger, D.H.Sc., a visionary leader in our health sciences programs, is serving as the school's founding dean.\n\nUndergraduates in the Whitworth School of Business had many opportunities to build connections and take their learning outside of the classroom this semester. Students attending the yearly Spokane Career Trek visited local businesses with alumni employees like Medcurity, Ignitium, Greater Spokane Incorporated, Ten Capital and Treasury4. Three finance students traveled to New York to attend the GAME (Global Asset Management Education) Forum at Quinnipiac University. And students met with leaders from six tech companies at Whitworth's annual Tech Startup Weekend.\n\nThe George F. Whitworth Honors Program held its inaugural Honors Exhibition in May, where five students from the Honors Exhibition course presented their interdisciplinary, problem-solving capstone projects. The one-credit course enables students to design a project that is based on their individual areas of study and interests under faculty guidance. Topics included \"Drowning Prevention in Spokane,\" \"PCB Pollution in the Spokane River\" and more.\n\nTwo faculty members in the College of Arts & Sciences have received grants from the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust of Vancouver, Wash. Assistant Professor of Biology Olivia Cope received a Life Sciences grant for more than $68,000 to support her summer research for the next three years that will investigate the diversity in plants. Assistant Professor of Engineering & Physics David Schipf received a $19,000 Partners in Science grant to fund a collaborative proposal with North Central High School science teacher Andrew Wiebers; the pair will study the propagation of ultrasonic mechanical waves through a wave insulator.\n\nOur Graduate Studies in Business programs continue to expand. We look forward to welcoming the first cohort in our Master of Science in Financial Planning program this fall. This program will be the first graduate degree program in financial planning offered in the Northwest. Plus, after a successful first year, ELEVATE, Whitworth's Leadership Certificate for Women, will double in size this fall to meet demand.\n\nThe Office of Church Engagement recently commissioned 26 students to serve in ministry this summer through its Summer Fellowship Program. Students have been placed in churches across the Northwest and in California, and several will also be contributing to the OCE's Resilient Fellows program, partnering with churches to conduct sociological and ethnographic research while serving in ministry. Other Summer Fellows will be serving in nonprofit ministries, including organizations in Spokane like Side by Side and Growing Neighbors.\n\nThe Office of Student Diversity, Equity & Inclusion hosted the eighth annual Diversity Monologues. Eight student poet-scholars presented monologues addressing the question, \"How do you come to know belonging?\" Christian Paige, an Emmy-nominated spoken word poet, professional speaker and educator, served as scholar-in-residence and emcee. While on campus, Paige facilitated a workshop for staff and faculty and met with various student groups.\n\nOne Pine Day, Whitworth's annual giving event in February, drew support from 809 donors representing 35 states, plus Austria, Canada, Iraq, Japan, Nepal and Mongolia. Donors generously supported a record 20 projects, including the Wildest Dreams Retreat for School of Continuing Studies adult students, professional clothes for teachers in training, a discipleship library for students to grow their faith, and the Whitworth Nutrition Center, increasing the quantity and quality of ingredients the center provides students to make meals at home. View projects making a difference at www.whitworth.edu/crowdfunding.\n\nMomentum is building as the university endeavors to construct a world-class engineering building, Whitworth's top capital priority. Our newly accredited engineering program provides students with an academically rigorous education that takes place in the context of committed Christian faith, intellectual challenge and holistic mentoring. Preliminary design plans are in hand for a 19,600-square-foot structure at a cost of $15.5 million. If you would like to learn more or partner with us, please visit www.whitworth.edu/engineering-building.\n\nA growing number of advisory councils comprised of alumni, parents and community leaders in specific fields are serving Whitworth's academic departments in meaningful ways. The Liberal Arts Advisory Council and Finance Advisory Council were formed this year, bringing the number of university advisory councils to eight. Whitworth also has several Industry Insights Groups that advise on specific areas. Our council and group members bring valuable insights that help strengthen our programs and prepare students for the marketplace. Thank you to the nearly 100 participants who are serving Whitworth in this way!\n\nWhitworth appointed two new vice presidents this spring. We are pleased to have Joshue Orozco, Ph.D., as our vice president for diversity, equity & inclusion. Orozco joined the Whitworth Philosophy Department faculty in 2009, rising to the rank of professor and department chair. We are also excited to welcome Josh Hibbard, Ph.D., to Whitworth as vice president for enrollment management.\n\nThe Spokane Journal of Business honored President Emeritus Bill Robinson, Whitworth's president from 1993 to 2010, as a 2023 Icon. Robinson's commitment to Whitworth has remained steadfast, and just this year he conducted a series of workshops on work culture and leadership for Whitworth employees. We are grateful for Bill's lasting influence on Whitworth.\n\nThis spring, Whitworth named the library archives after Whitworth's longtime university historian, Professor Emeritus of History Dale Soden. The Dale E. Soden Archives houses the official and historical records of Whitworth. It also holds documents of the history of Protestantism in the Pacific Northwest, a collection which Soden helped develop in his role as founding director of the Weyerhaeuser Center for Christian Faith & Learning.\n\nOur athletics teams had strong seasons this winter and spring, helping Whitworth to finish as the runner-up in the 2022.23 McIlroy-Lewis All-Sports Trophy standings. Men's basketball won the Northwest Conference tournament by knocking off top-seeded Whitman on the road to advance to the NCAA Division III playoffs. The men's swimming team, led by Co-NWC Men's Swimmer of the Year Zachary Washburn '25, finished as NWC runner-up. Carly Hoff '23 earned NWC Women's Swimmer of the Year after she won all three of her individual races. During the spring season, both Pirate track & field teams finished in second at the NWC championship meet. Solo Hines '24 was the 2023 NWC Men's Track Athlete of the Meet after winning both the 100 and 200 dashes, the former in meet record time. The softball team made it to the 2023 NWC tournament for the 11th time since 2011.\n\nUpcoming\n\nEnrolling for Fall 2023 | Good news… and it's not too late.\n\nWhitworth received enrollment deposits for next fall from 566 incoming first-year students. We can't wait to welcome these students to the Whitworth community and provide them with a transformative education that prepares them to serve a world in need. There are many students still working through their decisions, and we will continue accepting admissions applications (www.whitworth.edu/apply) and awarding financial aid through early August (but sooner is better!). Plus, transfer students have until July 1 to apply by our regular fall deadline (www.whitworth.edu/transfer). If you have questions, please contact the admissions office at admissions@whitworth.edu or 509.777.4786.\n\nSeattle Mariners Game | Sept. 16\n\nCalling all Pirates! Join us in Seattle to watch the Mariners play the Los Angeles Dodgers. Purchase tickets at www.whitworth.edu/mariners-dodgers.\n\nHomecoming and Family Weekends | Oct. 13-15\n\nAll alumni and family members of current Pirates are invited to One Big Whitworth Weekend, Oct. 13-15. Watch your inbox and www.whitworth.edu/obww23 for details. We will celebrate reunions for the classes of 2013, '03, 1993, '83, '73, and the classes of '72 and earlier.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nI've been asked whether it ever gets old asking Whitworth friends and alumni for financial gifts to support Whitworth students and programs. Nope – not in the slightest! That's because of how your gifts provide access for students, bridge financial gaps to remain in school, and enable program enhancements that make the student experience even that much better. In that spirit, please do consider a gift in support of this special place. You may visit connect.whitworth.edu/heart to make a gift. The Whitworth Scholarship Fund is the area of greatest need, but please use that link to give to any area you are passionate about. Your generosity makes a huge impact. It simply does.\n\nScott McQuilkin"
