        "text": "Mark Whitworth (VP for Intercollegiate Athletics & University Communications: 7th Year)\n\nAsbury University’s reputation for excellence in and out of the classroom was reinforced again on March 29, 2018, as former Southeastern Conference (SEC) Associate Commissioner, Mark Whitworth, was introduced as the school’s first-ever Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics. In 2020, his role in the AU administration was expanded to include University Communications.\n\n“While in the national spotlight, Mark Whitworth continually exemplified the same positive integration of faith, learning and athletics that Asbury is known for,” said former Asbury President Sandra Gray when announcing his appointment. “Mark understands the unique mission and atmosphere surrounding Asbury and its athletics department. It is very significant in the history of our University, as this is the first time that we have had someone at the Vice President level who will be serving on the cabinet.”\n\nUnder Whitworth's leadership Asbury has experienced significant growth, most notably becoming a member of NCAA Division III in 2021. Now in the final stages of provisional membership, AU is on schedule to become an active NCAA member September 1, 2024. Asbury became the first school in the history of the NCAA Division III to be granted a waiver for the exploratory year, reducing the membership process from four years to three years. As part of the move to the NCAA, the Eagles secured a new conference home accepting an invitation to become a member of the Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS) July 1, 2024.\n\nWith a focus on enhancing the missional nature of the student-athlete experience, Asbury joined the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) in May 2021. The NCCAA provides AU student-athletes expanded opportunities to participate in postseason competition for baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. Several Asbury student-athletes have earned NCCAA All-American, All-Region, Scholar Athlete honors, while the men’s golf team captured the school’s first-ever national title by winning the 2021 NCCAA National Championship. In 2023, Asbury was recognized as the NCCAA’s #KingChasing Institution of the Year.\n\nSince arriving on the AU campus, Whitworth has led several student-focused enhancements to the athletics facilities. In the fall of 2023, Asbury completed Phase One of the Outdoor Venue. This project includes an eight-lane track, a synthetic turf field, LED lighting, and a throwing events field. The Outdoor Venue enabled AU to re-launch men’s and women’s track and field as intercollegiate sports in the 2023-24 academic year, after a nearly 40-year hiatus.\n\nConstruction of Phase Two of the Outdoor Venue will begin in the spring of 2024. This will feature stadium seating for 1,000 spectators, a digital scoreboard, a meeting suite building, and a team-services building with locker rooms for baseball, softball, and track and field, along with public restrooms.\n\nThe Luce Center, which serves as the home of Asbury Athletics, has also undergone numerous updates. It now features a new custom team meeting room, a re-purposed strength and\n\nperformance room, an expansive athletic training center and a state-of-the art indoor golf practice facility. The Luce Center lobby was also renovated in the summer of 2019 with illuminated AU logos and digital signage highlighting student-athletes, coaches, and sponsors. In October 2018, AU dedicated a new Team Suite, game-day entrance and new branding throughout the facility.\n\nThe Luce Center natatorium has experienced several significant upgrades including, new branded starting blocks, an industrial-sized fan, an eight-lane scoreboard, and a permanent sound system. The softball complex has also received a series of important updates with the installation of LED field lighting in 2023 and the construction of a new custom press box in 2021. The two-story structure features a climate-controlled elevated view above the softball grandstands for game management staff and live-streaming along with a spacious storage area on the ground level. The project also included the installation of a new permanent sound system.\n\nWhitworth is committed to telling the story of #TeamAU through a variety of strategic initiatives, including a re-designed athletics website launched in July of 2023, a corporate sponsor program, and the first-ever Asbury Sports Digital Network (ASDN), which began in 2020. The ASDN team is comprised of talented students and staff that produce nearly 100 live events each year.\n\nA 1984 Asbury graduate and former member of the university’s board of trustees, Whitworth served on the SEC staff for 27 years before becoming Chief Operating Officer at Knight Eady (a sports marketing and event management firm) in 2016. During his tenure, he helped KE earn the designation as Birmingham’s 12th fastest growing business in 2017.\n\nThe Louisville, Ky., native was appointed to a newly created role as Associate Commissioner for Men’s Basketball in 2013. As the SEC’s lead administrator for all men’s basketball matters for three seasons, Whitworth’s responsibilities included serving as the staff liaison to the head coaches, coordinating conference and non-conference scheduling, directing the SEC Tournament, and working closely with the league’s television partners. He also represented the SEC on the NCAA Men’s College Basketball Officiating Board of Directors and the Competition Committee.\n\nWhitworth previously served as Associate Commissioner for External Affairs. In that role, he was the SEC’s day-to-day contact for ESPN, working closely with the national cable network to coordinate coverage of more than 420 SEC events per year across multiple distribution platforms.\n\nWhitworth was a member of the Transition Team responsible for incorporating Texas A&M and Missouri as new members of the conference on July 1, 2012. He also participated in the league’s multimedia rights negotiations, which resulted in unprecedented agreements with ESPN and CBS in 2008-09 and the SEC Network and an extension with ESPN in 2013.\n\nBesides his responsibilities with the SEC’s television partners, Whitworth worked closely with the league’s digital initiatives, branding, marketing, licensing, and the corporate sponsorship program. He also served as the Commissioner’s liaison to the SEC Football Coaches, Men’s Basketball Coaches, and Men’s Golf Coaches. In addition, Whitworth served as liaison to the SEC Chief Marketing Administrators, Chief Development Officers, the Fan Experience Working Group and the institutional media and sponsorship rights holders.\n\nIn his role as Chairman of the SEC’s 75th Anniversary Committee, Whitworth was responsible for all components of the year-long celebration and multi-platform “Stories of Character” media campaign in 2007-08.\n\nHe began his career at the SEC as an Associate Director in the media relations department and was promoted to Director of Media Relations in 1990. He served in that capacity when the SEC expanded to 12 member institutions and conducted the nation’s first-ever conference football championship game in 1992.\n\nPrior to joining the SEC, Whitworth served on the Athletic Department staff at the University of Tennessee from 1984-1988. While at UT, he earned a master’s degree in Sports Administration. Whitworth received a bachelor’s degree from Asbury University in 1984 and was a member of the baseball team. He was appointed to the Board of Trustees at his alma mater in 2009 and was a recipient of the 2014 “A Award” given annually to alumni who have achieved distinction professionally and demonstrated loyalty to Asbury.\n\nHe is married to the former Tyanne James of Winchester, Ky, who is an Asbury graduate. They have a son (Tyler) and a daughter (Mary Kathryn) who is also an Asbury graduate.\n\nNCCAA KingChasing Podcast Link Here\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Whitworth was featured on the NCCAA KingChasing Podcast.
