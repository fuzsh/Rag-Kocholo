        "text": "Albany, NY — The State University of New York (SUNY) named 13 student-athletes this past spring for their academic and athletic achievement hailing from Division III SUNY institutions across the state with Hawks baseball junior Tommy Kreider and women's tennis junior Isabel van der Veen earning the SUNY Scholar Athlete Award for baseball and women's tennis, respectively.\n\nThe award was officially announced by the conference office Wednesday. The Spring SUNY Scholar Athlete Award recognizes student-athletes from SUNY colleges and universities sponsoring intercollegiate athletics at four and two-year levels who were named and voted upon by representatives of their respective institutions. Nominations included cumulative grade point average, current and career statistics, along with athletic and academic honors.\n\nBoth Kreider and van der Veen join fellow Hawks, men's basketball's Rylan Blondo, women's soccer's Rachel Eisert and field hockey's Hannah Ackerman who were selected this past year. Softball's Jackie Rometo and women's tennis' Onalee Batcheller were honorees for their respective sports in the spring of 2023.\n\nVan der Veen battled through injuries to be a pivotal piece in her team's repeat championship run in 2024. She was named to her first, SUNYAC First-Team Singles and First-Team Doubles recognition after going 4-0 in conference play at third singles, while she and partner Batcheller went 6-0 in second doubles against the league throughout the year, while being honored on the All-SUNYAC Tournament team for the third time in her career.\n\n\"In as many years as I have been head coach of this program I have never had a student athlete who fully deserves this award as does Izzy,\" said Hawks women's tennis coach Rob Bruley. \"Izzy is a true role model both on and off the court. A true leader and a student that others look up to. One of the most academically hard-working students a coach could wish for and one of the most coachable athletes I have ever had on the program.\n\n\"Izzy has played a major part in our continued success over the past three years,\" he continued. \"An athlete who has been plagued with serious injuries, Izzy has just picked herself up, done her rehab and is always eager to get back on the court to help out the team. The adversity she has had to go through over the past three years has made her stronger and taught others not to take playing time for granted. I hope her senior year is injury free so we can all see the best of her on the tennis court.\"\n\nVan der Veen has been a shining example of a well-rounded student-athlete, excelling in all aspects during her three years with the Hawks. She is a three-time SUNYAC Commissioner's Academic Honor Roll recipient, earned a spot on the Hawks Academic Honor Roll and Dean's List for six-straight semesters, and was enshrined into the Chi Alpha Sigma National Honor Society this past year, along with balancing her time honing her skills as a professional, working multiple internships including within the Athletic Communications Office.\n\n\"I'm amazed that she balances everything she takes on,\" Bruley said. \"She thrives under pressure and gives 100 percent on the court, in the classroom and in her athletic department duties. A player who never misses practice and strives to be the best she can be every day. A true role model for any student.\"\n\nBruley boasts back-to-back recipients of the SUNY Scholar Athlete Award, as van der Veen's doubles partner Batcheller was named last spring following the captain's senior season when she led the team to a conference title, while also being named as the 2023 SUNYAC Scholar Athlete of the Year along with 2023 Women's Tennis SUNY Scholar Athlete honors.\n\n\"If ever a student-athlete deserved this award, Izzy is that athlete. She has been recognized by the conference on many occasions for her tennis abilities and it is fantastic to also be recognized for her academic accomplishments,\" Bruley added. \"I'm very proud as her head coach that she has won this award and I only see great success for her as she graduates next year from New Paltz and moves into the workplace. This also has been a proud moment for me having back-to-back winners of this award following on from the conference recognizing Onalee Batcheller as last year's winner. Great academic recognition for our tennis program.\"\n\nKreider, meanwhile, enjoyed the best season ever for any individual who suited up for the SUNY New Paltz Baseball program. On the field, he set a new standard for individual success the team has ever seen, bringing home First-Team All-SUNYAC and All-Region honors, while becoming the first ever All-American selection, along with SUNYAC Tournament MVP after helping hoist the program's first ever SUNYAC title this past spring.\n\n\"Tommy has definitely maximized his success on and off the field this past season,\" Seay said. \"He's consistently been one of our top students and it's great to see his efforts as a student are being recognized just as much as his success as an athlete. When you couple Tommy's on field success with his academic achievements he's very deserving of this honor. Like all of our players, Tommy does a tremendous job balancing his commitment to being a student while building this program.\"\n\nAs excellent as Kreider was on the diamond, he mirrored his success in the classroom. As an Accounting major, the New City, NY native was named as the 2024 SUNYAC Baseball Scholar Athlete of the Year after earning a spot on the SUNYAC Commissioner's Academic Honor Roll for third straight year, along with landing on the Hawks Academic Honor Roll and Dean's List for six consecutive semesters.\n\n\"Tommy definitely manages his time effectively; he's always taking advantage of road trips to get his work done. He has a strong grasp on his priorities and it's always gratifying to see a player's hard work and dedication be rewarded,\" Seay said. \"I'm really excited for Tommy, not only for the success he's had this past season, but to see how he executes his plan for the 2025 season. I have no doubt he will come in prepared and hungry to lead a new crop of players.\"\n\nKreider and van der Veen were selected among nominees from 18 other NCAA Division III/USCAA Category schools including Alfred State, Brockport, Buffalo State, Canton, Cobleskill, Cortland, Delhi, Farmingdale, Fredonia, Geneseo, Maritime, Morrisville, Old Westbury, Oneonta, Oswego, Plattsburgh, Potsdam and SUNY Poly.\n\nView the full list of Division III Spring SUNY Scholar Athlete Award winners below:\n\nDivision III\n\nBaseball – Tommy Kreider, New Paltz\n\nKreider was an ABCA All-American (second team), ABCA All-Region III (first team), All-SUNYAC (first team) and the SUNYAC Tournament MVP in 2024.
