These workshops focus on best practices for securing coaching opportunities, networking, and career strategy to help women catch a vision for their careers and set them on a path toward landing their first coaching job. Over 150 women registered for the December 11 workshop.\n\n“CATCH A VISION advances our WeCOACH mission to recruit, advance, and retain women coaches in all sports and levels. WeCOACH strives to be a national leader in actively recruiting more women coaches to build the pipeline of future leaders in sport. And this program has special meaning to me as it is named in honor of my collegiate coach, Sue Semrau, who continually empowered her student-athletes to catch a vision for their lives,” said WeCOACH CEO, Vanessa Fuchs.\n\nCoach Semrau was joined by five current and former coaches representing different sports and levels for the inaugural CATCH A VISION workshop:\n\n• JoAnne Ferguson, Head Softball Coach at Pomona-Pitzer Colleges\n\n• Nicole Lukic, Head Coach of Minnesota Aurora (USL W League)\n\n• Ana Rios, Head Cross Country & Head Girls Track Coach at Diamond Hill-Jarvis High School\n\n• Nickie Sanlin, Head Men’s & Women’s Volleyball Coach at McKendree University\n\n• Sue Semrau, Former Head Women’s Basketball Coach at Florida State University (retired)\n\n• Helen Williams, CEO of HMW Sports Consulting LLC (former DI, II & III basketball coach)\n\n“Catching a vision for what you want to accomplish, and whom you want to be, is vital for success in our coaching careers. WeCOACH hosted an excellent program with this in mind. Aspiring young coaches heard from an outstanding and diverse panel of coaches who shared their “Why,” their plans after catching their vision, and the importance of celebrating the small victories along the way. Full discussion and breakout rooms provided a strong format for knowledge sharing and discussion,” said recently retired Florida State University Head Women’s Basketball Coach, Sue Semrau. “WeCOACH is making all the right moves to pour into coaches and move the needle for women in coaching!”\n\nThe interactive workshop format allowed participants to ask questions and gain advice from the featured coaching panel. Topics discussed included: knowing your coaching why, common career pathways, mentoring, lessons learned, tips for building experience & preparing for interviews, coaching resources, and navigating the unique challenges women face in sport.\n\nMOVE the NUMBERS\n\nMagdeline Gigliotti, Fairmont State University Acrobatics and Tumbling student-athlete, was recognized as the first aspiring coach to register for the workshop and she shared this about her experience: “As a current female athlete who is looking forward to a career in coaching, the WeCOACH Aspiring Women Coaches Workshop was a great opportunity to ask established women coaches questions about their experiences and to network with other young women who intend to get into coaching. I am so excited to be a part of WeCOACH and to attend and learn from all of the women involved in this organization! I’m sure they will provide so much valuable information for me and other young women as we look forward to entering the coaching profession!”\n\nAs we continue to celebrate Title IX at 50, the CATCH A VISION: Aspiring Women Coaches workshops will directly impact our MOVE the NUMBERS campaign to support and increase women in coaching. The next workshop will be held in Spring 2023.

This grant funding will enhance the professional leadership opportunities for our WeAMPLIFY participants, expand our recruiting and staffing efforts, and generate critical research data. On behalf of our entire WeCOACH Community, we are grateful to Truist for empowering our organization to advance and amplify the lives and careers of our members,” said WeCOACH CEO, Vanessa Fuchs.\n\nWeAMPLIFY was created to drive change and conversation surrounding social and institutional\n\nbarriers, and to amplify the voices, visibility, and value of women coaches of color. Truist grant funding will grow our specific programming for women coaches of color to better equip them with tools to advance and thrive in their coaching careers. Through our existing virtual and now in-person WeAMPLIFY leadership and networking programs, WeCOACH will advance its mission to exponentially move the numbers in terms of recruiting, advancing, and retaining women coaches in all sports and levels.\n\n“Whether it’s on the field or in the workplace, supporting opportunities for women, including women of color, to grow and demonstrate their leadership is critical to gender and racial equality,” said Emily Dawkins, north Florida regional president for Truist. “The leadership training and programming that WeCOACH’s Women Coaches of Color initiative is making in the lives of female coaches encapsulates Truist’s purpose of inspiring and building better lives.”\n\nThe next WeAMPLIFY virtual gathering is scheduled for Monday, January 9, 2023.

This year-round professional growth and leadership development program is designed specifically for Division II and Division III women coaches in all sports and will feature nationally renowned experts addressing timely topics impacting the coaching profession. We will also partner to actively identify and build the pipeline of women on Division II and III campuses who aspire to enter the coaching profession by hosting “Catch a Vision” sessions that will provide best practices for securing coaching opportunities, networking, and career-strategy. Eighteen (18) conferences have already committed to participate in the 2022-23 inaugural program.\n\nAs a one-of-a-kind nonprofit organization with a mission to recruit, advance and retain women coaches in all sports and levels, the Development Program offers strategies to help navigate the challenges and obstacles women coaches face to stay in, feel supported, and advance in the coaching profession. Throughout the 2022-23 academic year, the inaugural program participants will be offered three virtual sessions led by nationally renowned experts (fall, winter & spring), as well as have access to participate in the WeCOACH Mentor Program, WeAMPLIFY for women coaches of color, live video chats and more.\n\nWeCOACH CEO Vanessa Fuchs states, “As our nation celebrates Title IX at 50, the data demonstrates greater investment in women coaches is necessary to support their advancement and retention in the coaching profession. We are excited to offer this year-round Development Program for women coaches in Divisions II and III. One of our organization’s goals is to make our transformational programming accessible and affordable for women coaches working in every level of sport. This new Development Program does just that for Division II and III coaches.”\n\nChampioning this initiative is Sunshine State Conference Commissioner and WeCOACH Board member, Ed Pasque, and Jay Jones, Commissioner of the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. Both played invaluable leadership roles and committed significant time to provide guidance and insights to help establish the new initiative for Divisions II and III. And they were amongst the first to commit to having their league’s women coaches participate.\n\n“This Development Program has a chance to be impactful and inspirational for women coaches in NCAA Division II and III. I applaud WeCOACH CEO Vanessa Fuchs for launching this initiative, and for her commitment to serving women coaches at all levels of intercollegiate athletics. The future is bright for WeCOACH.” says Sunshine State Conference Commissioner Ed Pasque.\n\nJay Jones, Commissioner of Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference states, “I am really excited for this partnership, especially in light of recently celebrating the 50th anniversary of Title IX and the importance of what that legislation has meant for women in education. Being able to partner on a sports based educational initiative seemed idealic in that way, but more importantly this relationship helps us work towards our strategic vision of better serving underrepresented individuals across our conference and helping those individuals grow as professionals.”\n\nWeCOACH has also been propelled by long-standing support through Division II and Division III conference-wide memberships that have included: the Coast-to-Coast Athletic Conference, Northeast-10 Conference, Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC), and Sunshine State Conference.\n\n“WeCOACH is grateful to Commissioners Pasque and Jones, as well as the D-II and D-III conference-wide members who have supported our organization for many years. We salute the leadership in the 18 conferences that have committed to participate in the first year of the Development Program and certainly anticipate additional conferences committing in the coming months as we continue the rollout,” Fuchs added.\n\nThe following 18 conferences have already committed to participate in the inaugural 2022-23 Development Program:\n\nNCAA Division II Conferences:\n\nCalifornia Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA)\n\nCentral Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA)\n\nConference Carolinas\n\nEast Coast Conference (ECC)\n\nGreat Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC)\n\nNortheast-10 Conference (NE10)\n\nThe PacWest Conference\n\nRocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC)\n\nSunshine State Conference (SSC)\n\nNCAA Division III Conferences:\n\nColonial States Athletic Conference (CSAC)\n\nCommonwealth Coast Conference (CCC)\n\nHeartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (HCAC)\n\nMichigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA)\n\nMidwest Conference (MWC)\n\nMinnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC)\n\nNorth Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC)\n\nOld Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC)\n\nUpper Midwest Athletic Conference (UMAC)\n\nThis list continues to grow at a rapid rate as the start of the new 2022-23 academic year approaches and WeCOACH continues the program’s rollout.

Anytime we can position the CIAA to be in a space of advocacy and change, provide opportunities for growth and gain from an organization like WeCOACH, it is a win for our conference. The statistics reveal the direct need to identify more female coaches at all levels and the CIAA is always on board to help move the needle in shaping and preparing the women of our conference to take the helm when the opportunity avails.”\n\n– Jacqie McWilliams, Commissioner of Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA)\n\n“The Commonwealth Coast Conference and our member institutions are delighted to enter into a formal partnership with WeCOACH.

The variety of professional development, networking, and mentorship opportunities the program has on tap are great resources for our membership. We cannot wait to hear about their experience at the conclusion of the year!”\n\n– Brad Bankston, Commissioner of Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC)\n\n“We’re very excited to be joining WeCOACH in offering the Division II Women Coaches Development program. I think this is going to be a really beneficial program for our women coaches, especially during the 50th Anniversary of Title IX.

Fifty years ago, countless lives were transformed when Title IX was passed on June 23 as part of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 – a law that removed barriers and exponentially opened up access to education programs and activities for all, while also advancing millions of girls and women in sport. Fifty years later on June 23, 2022, WeCOACH launches a year-long celebratory campaign entitled “MOVE the NUMBERS,” along with a new commemorative logo and dedicated 50th Anniversary landing page.\n\nThe MOVE the NUMBERS campaign is designed to achieve three goals:\n\nRaise the critical funding necessary to support our WeCOACH mission to considerably increase the number of women coaches in all sports and levels\n\nIncrease the number of year-round growth and leadership development programs\n\nOffer enhanced member benefits to impact and elevate a greater number of women coaches in our WeCOACH Community\n\nPrior to Title IX in 1972, over 90% of women’s collegiate sports teams were coached by women. Today, 50 years later, data in the 2021-22 Women in College Coaching Report Card, a 10-year collaboration between The Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport and WeCOACH, indicates at the NCAA Division I level, that number has decreased to a stagnant 43%, with only 7.3% women coaches of color. According to the NCAA, for all three divisions, 41% of women coach women’s teams, and 5% coach men’s teams. At the youth level, data is hard to estimate, but approximately less than 20% of teams are coached by women.\n\nWeCOACH is a one-of-a-kind nonprofit dedicated to recruiting more women into the coaching pipeline, advancing their careers and retaining women coaches in all sports and levels through year-round growth & leadership development programs. Our events focus on offering strategies to address the challenges and obstacles women face to stay in, feel supported, and advance in their coaching career. Funds raised during the MOVE the NUMBERS campaign will be applied towards securing nationally renowned speakers, removing financial barriers to allow more women coaches cost-free access to our transformational events and expanding upon the programs we offer to impact a greater number of members in our WeCOACH community.\n\nThroughout Title IX’s golden anniversary year and beyond, WeCOACH will host events for members to learn about our history, celebrate the present and MOVE the NUMBERS to impact history for the next 50 years.\n\nHow you can help us MOVE the NUMBERS: (visit our website for detailed information):\n\nFund Women Coaches Academy Scholarships for collegiate and high school coaches.

These Academies are made possible through a longstanding partnership with the NCAA.\n\nForty-five women coaches of all experience levels and sports from NCAA Divisions I, II and III have been selected to participate in the NCAA Women Coaches Academy, while 17 have been selected to partake in the master-learning NCAA Academy 2.0 program.\n\n“The NCAA is proud to once again partner with WeCOACH to host the 2022 NCAA Women Coaches Academy and NCAA Academy 2.0. The NCAA Leadership Development Office serves to educate and empower student-athletes, coaches and athletics administrators through transformative experiences that develop strong, effective leaders, cultivate an inclusive community and enhance the college sports landscape”, said DeeDee Merritt, NCAA Director of Leadership Development. “These Academies for women coaches align with our mission and have had tremendous results in supporting, advancing and retaining women coaches in collegiate athletics.”\n\nThe NCAA WCA is designed for women coaches who are ready to elevate their holistic coaching effectiveness by learning advanced leadership skills and strategies that directly affect their personal and team success. Participants will focus on non-sport-specific concepts in an environment that fosters inclusion across the sports community. The NCAA Academy 2.0, exclusively created for WCA graduates, is a master-learning opportunity – in a small class setting – that progresses on the leadership skills, strategies, and knowledge gained from their WCA experience.\n\n“We are thrilled to return to in-person Academies this year and welcome our NCAA Women Coaches Academy Class #51 and NCAA Academy 2.0 Class #5 to Denver! The programs are our signature growth and leadership development events and the data demonstrates the significant impact”, said Vanessa Fuchs, WeCOACH CEO. “Women coaches who graduate from our Academies remain in the coaching profession at a higher rate. And as we approach Title IX’s 50th anniversary, there’s no better time than now to move the numbers in terms of increasing women in coaching and these Academies are one of the many ways WeCOACH is

In it, a veritable who’s who of women coaches—representing 15 different sports and earning more than 50 national championships and dozens of world and Olympic titles—provide the acumen and inspiration for women to succeed in the coaching profession.\n\nCollegiate softball coaching standouts Lonni Alameda and Kelly Inouye-Perez, basketball coaches Carol Owens and Tara VanDerveer, gymnastics coach Valorie Kondos Field, swim coach Teri McKeever, Major League Baseball’s first-ever female manager Rachel Balkovec, and Jen Welter, the first female NFL coach, are just some of the 20 esteemed contributors, each examining a different coaching topic from her unique viewpoint.\n\nReaders will glean strategies, insights, and advice to help them address common coaching challenges, build and maintain successful sport programs, foster player engagement and growth, and further their coaching careers. In addition, the contributing authors weave a common thread throughout the chapters by discussing the importance of building team chemistry and fostering team culture.\n\nEdited by collegiate volleyball coaching legend Cecile Reynaud, PhD, and embodying the idea of “If she can see it, she can be it,” Winning Ways of Women Coaches will reinvigorate current women coaches and inspire would-be coaches to make the leap into coaching.\n\n“Each one of the women coaches who took the time to contribute a chapter in this book has been successful in reaching the top of her sport or is a trailblazer in men’s professional sport leagues,” says Reynaud. “Each contributor offers a unique perspective into how she leads her program to achieve at the highest level.\n\nThe contributors empower coaches at all levels by sharing their expertise and philosophies for multiple aspects of sport, adds Reynaud. “These are some incredibly smart and talented women.

Their idea of bringing shoes directly to the athletes grew from hosting shoe clinics around Central Wisconsin to joining the Foot Locker, Inc. family in 1997. The partnership provided Eastbay access to a wider range of the market and an even larger selection of gear aligning with their vision of being the go-to resource for pro-grade gear, casual styles, and expert training tips for athletes who care about winning.\n\nAbout WeCOACH\n\nFounded in 2011, WeCOACH has become the premier membership organization committed to recruiting, advancing, and retaining women coaches across all sports and levels.
