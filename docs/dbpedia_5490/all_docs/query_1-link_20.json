In his first two seasons at the helm, Riley led Eastern to a combined 41-27 record (27-11 in conference), including a Big Sky Regular Season Championships in 2022-23 (23-11, 16-2).\n\nRiley earned Big Sky Coach of the Year honors in 2022-23 as the Eagles set program and conference records with an 18-game winning streak and 16-0 start to conference play. They lost at the Big Sky Tournament but earned a bid to the 2023 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), where they secured the second postseason win in program history, knocking off Washington State on the road in Pullman. They narrowly missed a second-round win over Oklahoma State in Stillwater. Guards Steele Venters and Angelo Allegri earned First Team All-Big Sky honors, with Venters named MVP as a unanimous selection. Forward Ethan Price earned Honorable Mention recognition.\n\nThe Eagles went 18-16 (11-9) in Riley’s first year as he was recognized as a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Award for the top first-year head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. The Eagles competed in The Basketball Tournament (TBC) and Price was named Big Sky Freshman of the Year. Venters and Linton Acliese III were named Second Team All-Big Sky.\n\nPrior to being named head coach, Riley served as an assistant under Jim Hayford from 2011-17, then Shantay Legans from 2017-21. During his time as an assistant, the Eagles began their current stretch of unparalleled success, earning four league MVP honors in five years (2016, 2017, 2019, 2020) as well as NCAA Tournament berths in 2015 and 2021.\n\nAs a player, Riley was a sharpshooting wing at D-III Whitworth University in nearby Spokane, Wash., earning First Team All-NWC honors in his final three seasons while starting 112 of 114 games in his career. He finished with 1,664 points (14.6 per game) to rank fourth in Whitworth history and made 43.1 percent of his three-point attempts (300-of-696). He averaged 16.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game as a senior when he earned Third Team All-Region (D3hoops.com) honors. Riley drained a school-record 10 three-pointers and finished with 33 points in a 115-69 triumph over Willamette on Feb. 11, 2011. The Pirates finished 28-2 and advanced to the Elite Eight of the D-III Tournament for the first time in school history. The Pirates competed in the D-III tournament every year during his career.\n\nRiley is formerly from Palo Alto, Calif., and graduated from Gunn High School in 2007. He was born on Nov. 28, 1988, in Seattle. He and his wife, Emily, were married in 2018.\n\nRiley’s father, Edward Riley, is a Whitworth graduate and a physician and professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Riley’s uncle, Mike Riley, grew up in Wallace, Idaho, and went on to a successful football coaching career, including head coaching roles at Nebraska (2015-2017), Oregon State (1997-98, 2003-2014), the NFL’s San Diego Chargers (1999-2001) and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (1987-1990). Riley’s grandfather, Bud Riley, was an assistant football coach at Idaho (1962-65), Oregon State (1965-72) and the head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (1974-77).\n\nDavid Riley’s mother, Rev. Renee Riley, also graduated from Whitworth and was ordained in 1986. She was the Moderator of the Presbytery of San Jose in 1998. She passed away in 2005 at the age of 45."
