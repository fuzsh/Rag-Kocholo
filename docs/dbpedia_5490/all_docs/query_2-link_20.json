        "text": "5/22/2024 3:22:00 PM\n\nMYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - Washington and Lee University men's track and field first-year George Mann is set to compete at the 2024 NCAA Division III Men's Track and Field National Championships on Thursday, May 23.\n\nMann earned a berth to the championships for the first time in his career after an impressive rookie campaign with the Blue and White. Mann ranks 11th in Division III in the javelin this season and will be the second student-athlete in program history to represent the Generals at the national meet in the event.\n\nThe Blue and White have had 20 student-athletes qualify and compete at the National Championships since 1974. Evan Langhammer was the last General to compete at the NCAA Championships, finishing in a tie for fourth place in the pole vault at the 2023 national meet to earn All-American honors.\n\nThe Hoover, Ala. native tossed the second best mark in program history in his first outdoor meet of his career, recording a mark of 61.74m (202'-06.50\") which ranked second in the nation following the W&L Carnival on Mar. 15. Mann claimed the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) crown and first team All-conference honors in the event on Apr. 27, recording a toss of 56.97m (186'-10.75\").\n\nMann will compete with 21 of the best javelin throwers this season with hopes of earning All-America status in his first national meet. 12 of the 22 student-athletes competing hold marks over 200 feet this season while Cody Wheeler of Whitworth University holds the top mark with a toss of 68.21m (223'-09.00\"). Liam Bourassa of Fitchburg State University ranks second in the nation with a mark of 66.41m (217'-10.00\") and Andrew D'Asara of Denison University sits in third with a mark of 64.07m (210'-02.00\").\n\nThe men's javelin will kick off at 3 p.m. (ET) on Thursday, May 23 at the Doug Shaw Memorial Stadium in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Fans can follow along with live results via Leone Timing HERE.\n\nNestled in the mountains of Virginia, Washington and Lee University is a proud member of NCAA Division III and the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. Founded in 1749, W&L is the ninth-oldest college in the United States and a top-ranked liberal arts university. With over 500 student-athletes in 24 varsity sports, the Generals have celebrated over 265 conference championships.
