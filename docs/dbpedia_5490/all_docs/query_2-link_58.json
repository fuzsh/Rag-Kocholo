        "text": "ATLANTA, Georgia (June 3, 2025) – The National Football Foundation (NFF) & College Hall of Fame has announced the names on the 2025 ballot for induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. The list includes 77 players and nine coaches from the Football Bowl Subdivision, as well as 101 players and 34 coaches from the divisional ranks.\n\nNFF President & CEO Steve Hatchell remarked, \"Being on the College Football Hall of Fame ballot is a significant honor. Out of the more than 5.7 million individuals who have played college football, only 1,093 players have been inducted. The Hall's requirement of being a First-Team All-American narrows the pool to about 1,500 eligible individuals. Being part of this elite group signifies true greatness, and we eagerly await announcing the 2025 College Football Hall of Fame Class early next year.\"\n\nThe ballot has been emailed to over 12,000 NFF members and current Hall of Famers, whose votes will be compiled and submitted to the NFF's Honors Court for final selection. (Individuals can cast a vote this year by becoming an NFF member.)\n\nThe Honors Court, chaired by NFF Board Member and College Football Hall of Famer Archie Griffin from Ohio State, includes a prestigious and geographically diverse group of athletic administrators, Hall of Famers, and media members. For official criteria and voting procedures, please click here.\n\nNFF Chairman Archie Manning, a 1989 Hall of Fame inductee from Mississippi, emphasized, \"Having a ballot and a voice in the selection of the College Football Hall of Fame inductees is one of the most cherished NFF member benefits. Our membership, the most knowledgeable and passionate group about college football, engages in the significant responsibility of selecting those who have reached the pinnacle of achievement in our sport.\"\n\nThe announcement of the 2025 College Football Hall of Fame Class will be made in early 2025, with specific details forthcoming.\n\nThe 2025 College Football Hall of Fame Class will be officially inducted during the 67th NFF Annual Awards Dinner Presented by Las Vegas on December 9, 2025, at the Bellagio Hotel & Resort. They will also be honored at their respective schools with an NFF Hall of Fame On-Campus Salute, presented by Fidelity Investments, during the 2025 season.\n\nOf the 5.7 million individuals who have played college football since the first game between Princeton and Rutgers on November 6, 1869, only 1,093 players (less than 0.02%) have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. From the coaching ranks, 233 individuals have achieved Hall of Fame distinction.\n\nThe 2025 Ballot includes 11 NFF National Scholar-Athletes, such as FBS players Jeff Bregel (USC), Gregg Carr (Auburn), Brad Culpepper (Florida), Greg Eslinger (Minnesota), Graham Harrell (Texas Tech), Alex Mack (California), Darrin Smith (Miami, FL), and Manti Te'o (Notre Dame). Divisional nominees include Keith Elias (Princeton), Gerald Quinlivan (Buffalo), and Thomas Stenglein (Colgate).\n\nSince 1959, the NFF has recognized 922 National Scholar-Athletes, with only 44 earning the distinction of both Hall of Famer and National Scholar-Athlete, making it one of the most elite groups in sports. Among these 44 dual honorees, only Peyton Manning (Tennessee), Matt Stinchcomb (Georgia), Tim Tebow (Florida), and Danny Wuerffel (Florida) have also claimed The William V. Campbell Trophy®.\n\nVoting Deadline: July 1, 2025.

1951 by the National Football Foundation, the College Football Hall of Fame immortalizes the greatest of the amateur gridiron. 5.1 million people have coached or played the game and less than 1,300 are inductees in the Hall. This makes the College Football Hall of Fame an extremely selective group of individuals.\n\nOriginally slated to be built on the Rutgers University campus – home of the first college football game in 1869 – the Hall ultimately found its first home in Kings Mills, Ohio in 1978. The Ohio location closed in 1992 and the Hall relocated to South Bend, Indiana where it resided from 1995 to 2012.\n\nIn 2014, the College Football Hall of Fame opened in Atlanta, a major hub of college football activity, a convention and tourist destination, and home of one of the nation’s busiest airports. It’s a $68.5 million, 95,000 square foot, state-of-the-art tribute to 977 players, 211 coaches, and countless fans.\n\nLocated in the heart of Atlanta’s sports, tourism and entertainment districts, the Chick-fil-A College Football Hall of Fame is steps away from the iconic Centennial Olympic Park and surrounded by other attractions including the World of Coca-Cola, the Georgia Aquarium, CNN Center, and much more.\n\nIn addition to celebrating the best of college football, the Hall serves as one of the most unique and popular private event spaces in Atlanta. The Hall also provides a platform for character development initiatives, community outreach and education throughout the city. To see what events we have, look here.\n\nThree floors, five themed galleries and over 50 interactive exhibits, including a 47-yard football field and a three-story wall of over 750 college football helmets, awaits visitors.
