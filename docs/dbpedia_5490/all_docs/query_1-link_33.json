        "text": "THIS WEEKEND: Pacific Lutheran makes its first NCAA Division III softball postseason appearance since 2003 when the Lutes face Huntingdon (Ala.) in a first round game of the Tyler, Texas Regional at 4 p.m. (CDT) Friday. The games will be played at UT-Tyler Ballpark. The double-elimination regional tournament features seven teams and three (or four, in case of weather delay) days of action, with the regional champion booking a ticket to the Division III national championship tournament scheduled for May 18-22 at the Moyer Complex in Salem, Va.\n\nOTHER REGIONAL TOURNAMENTS: In addition to the Tyler Regional, NCAA Division III regionals will be hosted this weekend by Alma College in Alma, Mich., Amherst College in Amherst, Mass., Central College in Pella, Iowa, Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va., Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Conn., Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Ill., and Kean University in Union, N.J. Each of the eight regional tournament champions will advance to the national tournament in Salem, Va.\n\nFOLLOW THE TOURNAMENT ACTION: Lutes fans interested in listening to the PLU audio webcast can do so by clicking here. UT-Tyler provides a video stream and live stats that can be accessed by clicking here. UT-Tyler's tournament web site can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nFAMILIARITY BREEDS...WELL, FAMILIARITY: One of the advantages for the Lutes being sent to the Tyler Regional is that they are quite familiar with the surroundings. PLU played two doubleheaders at the UT-Tyler facility during their 10-game swing through Texas in late March.\n\nHOW THE LUTES GOT THERE: Not giving the NCAA Division III national tournament selection committee an opportunity to deal out heartbreak as it did a year ago, Pacific Lutheran punched its own ticket to NCAA postseason play Sunday by winning the Northwest Conference softball tournament title on Sunday, April 22, in McMinnville, Ore. Senior Stacey Hagensen shut down the tournament host, No. 1-ranked and defending national champion Linfield Wildcats, limiting the prolific offensive machine to just two hits in a 3-0 whitewash at Del Smith Field. With the win, the Lutes earned the NWC's automatic bid into Division III postseason play. Linfield later received an at-large bid and will play at the Bloomington, Illinois Regional hosted by Illinois Wesleyan University.\n\nREGIONAL FIRST ROUND MATCHUPS: Pacific Lutheran, 37-11 this season, will face Huntingdon (Ala.), 28-13, in its NCAA Division III softball regional round opener at 4 p.m. (CDT) on Friday. The other side of PLU's bracket has Redlands (Calif.), 31-11, playing Birmingham-Southern (Ala.), 34-9. Other teams in the seven-team regional tournament include No. 1 seed and tournament host Texas-Tyler, 36-7, which has a first-round bye before meeting the winner of the regional's opening game between Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (Calif.), 28-13, and Louisiana College, also 28-13. Games will continue through Sunday, and because this is a seven-team tournament there are several variations of schedules that could come into play. No matter the outcome of its regional tournament opener against Huntingdon, PLU will play its second game on Saturday.\n\nPREVIOUS MEETINGS: Pacific Lutheran has never faced Birmingham-Southern or Louisiana College. However, PLU has met with Huntingdon, its opening-round opponent, four times dating back to the 1991 season. The programs have split the four games, however, Pacific Lutheran may hold the upper hand in the series after winning a NAIA national tournament semifinal match up en route to the team's 1992 national title. In addition, the Lutes have won four of five games played against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, including a 3-2 win in the most recent meeting in 2010. PLU is 6-6 in 12 total games against Redlands, including a 3-3 split since 2009. Playing at Redlands, the Lutes and the Bulldogs each won a game in doubleheaders played in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Pacific Lutheran's only games against UT-Tyler came on March 29 of this year when the teams split a doubleheader at the end of the Lutes' 10-games-in-six-days Texas road trip. PLU won the opening game, 3-2 in eight innings, before the Patriots took a 7-0 decision in the final contest.\n\nCONNECTING PLU AND HUNTINGDON TO THE SEC: As previously mentioned, PLU and Huntingdon squared off in the NAIA national semifinal in the 1992 season. PLU was led that season by head coach Ralph Weekly. On the other side of the diamond, Tina Deese was in her fifth season as head coach at Huntingdon. Now, 20 years later, Weekly and Deese are coaching at the Division I level. Thursday afternoon, Weekly will lead his University of Tennessee Volunteers out on the field to face Deese's Auburn University Tigers in the first-round of the SEC Tournament in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Earlier this season, Tennessee swept a three-game series from Auburn.\n\nBRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE REGIONAL TOURNAMENT TEAMS:\n\nNo. 1 Seed - Texas-Tyler: 37-6 overall record, American Southwest Conference champions, automatic qualifier to Division III tournament, No. 7 ranking in the NFCA poll.

In 2002, PLU won the regional championship on its own field with a victory over East Texas Baptist University (ETBU) before placing fourth in the national tournament.
