        "text": "Kamran obtained his medical degree from Western University of Health Sciences (Pomona) in 2017. He then traveled north to Spokane for his family medicine training, followed by completion of a primary care sports medicine fellowship at OHSU. He served as a team physician for Portland State University during his time in Oregon, and currently provides medical care to athletes at Gonzaga University and the Spokane Indians. He has a passion for musculoskeletal medicine with an emphasis on diagnostic/procedural ultrasound and working with learners in various stages of medical training. In his free time, he enjoys hiking, camping, snowboarding, and rooting on the Dodgers/Lakers.\n\nI was born in Durham, NC and was raised between there and Raleigh, NC. I attended East Carolina University where I was a walk-on football player for a year prior to beginning my medical education at Xavier University School of Medicine. Following that, I completed my family medicine residency (Rural track) back at ECU. I chose sports medicine because of my love for athletics and competition, but also to prepare myself to be able to help patients achieve pain relief and return to function through non-operative measures when possible and help maintain a good quality of life for years to come! Outside of medicine I enjoy playing and watching sports, traveling around the world, trying various cuisines, working out, and spending time with my dog Lilo.\n\nDr. Fralich is a fellowship-trained Sports Medicine physician in the Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine at Providence and serves as head team physician for the Spokane Chiefs hockey club.
