        "text": "5/30/2024 12:00:00 AM\n\nGreenville, SC: The NCCAA inducted Matt Hill as the newest member into the Hall of Fame at the Hall of Fame Banquet during the Annual Convention. Also honored were recipients of the Game Plan 4 LIFE Character Award, Paul & Carolyn Berry Award, Meritorious Service Award, #KingChasing Institution of the Year, and Presidential Award.\n\nHall of Fame\n\nGP4L Character Award: Female Student-Athlete | Male Student-Athlete\n\nPaul & Carolyn Men's Staff Award | Paul & Carolyn Berry Women's Staff Award\n\nMeritorious Service Award\n\n#KingChasing Institution of the Year\n\nPresidential Award\n\n2024 Hall of Fame Inductee\n\nMatt Hill, University of Northwestern\n\nDr. Mathew (Matt) Hill has been a staple of consistency at University of Northwestern (UNW) over the last 24 years. Hill’s integrity in Christ and desire to serve has led him to impact the hearts of thousands of young men and women in their student-athlete experience at Northwestern, as well as many other young leaders across the NCCAA.\n\nAfter graduating from UNW with a bachelor’s degree in marketing in 1989 as a four-sport athlete, Hill immediately went on to continue his education at Drake University where he received his master’s in teaching. Seven years later, Hill would begin his tenure as Director of Athletics back at Northwestern.\n\nThroughout his time, Hill has seen multiple promotions including a role as Vice President for Student Life in 2009 as well as a promotion to the executive leadership team at Northwestern. Hill’s servant heart has led him to participate in multiple leadership roles outside of UNW over the years. Serving for several terms, including a three-year stint as NCCAA President, Hill currently serves on the Administration Committee of the NCCAA Board of Directors. Hill has been instrumental in providing Northwestern student-athletes mission trip opportunities, sending 347 student-athletes and coaches from 11 different teams on mission experiences, many of which have utilized the NCCAA Sports Ministry Fund.\n\nHill has been an active advocate in Title IX and facility expansion projects. Hill helped generate facility expansion across Northwestern’s campus, overseeing an $11 million capital improvement project to enhance all Eagle outdoor facilities. This project not only helped UNW be a leader within the NCCAA but has helped them become a force within NCAA Division III.\n\n“Matt is mission minded,” said University of Northwestern President Dr. Corbin Hoornbeek. “He has lived out our institutional mission without fail for more than two decades. His commitment and ongoing pursuit of making disciples of all nations is evident in all he does.”\n\nThis mission has led Northwestern athletics to 70+ NCCAA National Championship appearances during Hill’s tenure, where student-athletes have had the experience to compete while focusing on #KingChasing. UNW has also won many NCCAA awards and titles under Hill’s leadership, including 16 Game Plan 4 LIFE Character Awards, over 750 Scholar-Athletes, and four National Championships.\n\nChad Briscoe, Director of Athletics at Grace College, stated, “Hill’s sincere Christian commitment to always working with excellence is a tremendous asset to the University of Northwestern, the UMAC, NCAA, and NCCAA. He has a tremendous passion for higher education and is dedicated to assisting both his coaches and students through his position at UNW.”\n\n“Hill exemplifies what it means to be a servant leader,” added Northwestern Head Women’s Basketball Coach Aaron Kahl. “Whether climbing to the top of a scoreboard to change a bulb or chairing a national committee, Hill is willing and capable to answer the call. When faced with obstacles, Hill doesn’t focus on what can’t be done, he often says: ‘what can we do.’”\n\nAs a result of Hill’s leadership, UNW has seen longevity among their coaching staff, with nearly every active head coach being the all-time winningest coach in their respective sport. He has also helped Northwestern achieve a stable enrollment during turbulent times across the country in higher education.\n\n“Hill is the model for effective service, always being the first one there and the last one to leave,” said Northwestern Head Men’s Basketball Coach Tim Grosz. “He encourages transparency, humbly puts others’ needs before his own, and deals with conflict in a Godly way. Matt Hill is a special person, a wonderful friend, colleague, and boss.”\n\nThe NCCAA is honored to induct Dr. Matt Hill into the Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2024.\n\n[Back to top]\n\nGame Plan 4 LIFE Character Award\n\nThe purpose of this award is to recognize NCCAA student-athletes and athletics staff who epitomize the Christian character qualities of LOVE, INTEGRITY, FAITH, and EXCELLENCE.\n\nThis year’s Game Plan 4 LIFE Female Student-Athlete Character Award recipient is Maddie Ryman of Grace College.\n\nRyman has been prolific for her hometown Grace College over the last four years, impacting the northern Indiana community on and off the court. On the court, Ryman has been one of Grace’s best players in program history as she recently led Grace to their first ever NCCAA National Championship in 2024. She is the all-time leader in points and assists for the Lancers and is one of just 12 players to score 2,000 points in the Crossroads League. She has earned numerous honors including two NCCAA All-American honors, the NCCAA Midwest Regional Player of the Year award, and an NAIA All-American Honorable Mention honor. Ryman averages 14.1 points per game for her career and 2.6 assists per game while shooting just under 40% from the field.\n\nOff the court, Ryman has really developed in her faith while at Grace, making it the forefront of what she does as she begins to think about what life after college will look like. Ryman serves her team through leading Bible studies, but also serves the community through her action. One of the many ways she has served is with SCORE International in Eutaw, Alabama. Ryman helped clean up wreckage of a tornado and provided meals and times of fellowship to local families displaced from their homes. Ryman loves to serve kids and has shown that through shopping with and for local elementary students to provide them Christmas gifts. She also has used a hobby of making blankets to serve an organization called Project Linus that donates these handmaid blankets to homeless and hospitalized children. Ryman is always looking for ways to serve as these are just a few of the many ways she has impacted the lives of those around her through her faithful service.\n\nRyman does all this while being committed to her education. She holds a 3.9 GPA as a Digital Marketing major at Grace College and has been on the Dean’s List all four years. She has also earned multiple NCCAA and NAIA Scholar-Athlete honors.\n\n“Maddie is truly the epitome of a Christian student-athlete who puts in the work to find results,” said Grace Women’s Basketball Head Coach Dan Davis. “She takes pride in this program and her team and will not settle until she has fought as hard as she can for those around her.”\n\n[Back to top]\n\nThis year’s Game Plan 4 LIFE Male Student-Athlete Character Award recipient is Bryce Crabb of University of Northwestern. Crabb has been a solid two-way player for the Eagles, seeing time in the lineup as a pitcher or shortstop. The native of Des Moines, Iowa is the all-time winningest pitcher in the history of UNW baseball, holding a 27-13 career record with a 2.59 ERA in 39 starts. Crabb has had 17 complete games while pitching 288.1 career innings, allowing just 83 earned runs, and striking out 270 batters in his career. When playing shortstop, Crabb has batted leadoff for most of his career, holding a .336 career batting average with 178 hits, 36 doubles, 137 runs scored, and 82 RBI with a slugging percentage of .439. The graduate student has also been lightning on the basepaths, with 45 stolen bases.\n\nCrabb is a two-time NCCAA All-American, four-time NCCAA All-Regional Award winner, and is a four-time UMAC First Team All-Conference selection. In the classroom, he is a four-time NCCAA Scholar Athlete, a four-time UMAC Academic All-Conference selection, and was a College Sports Communicators Academic All-District selection. Crabb is majoring in accounting and holds a 3.95 GPA.\n\nOff the field, Crabb gives back to the community with volunteer work. Crabb has volunteered with various organizations, such as Meals From The Heartland, Christmas With Dignity, Feed My Starving Children, and Operation Christmas Child.\n\nHead Coach Jesse Eikum states, “Bryce Crabb will leave Northwestern as one of the best two-way players in the history of Eagle baseball. In terms of versatility, it is hard to find somebody who tops the career Crabb has turned in. Crabb is one of those rare players that is his team's best pitcher, best hitter, and best fielder, and has been one of the most important pieces to one of the best four year stretches in program history. He has done this while also racking up academic achievements and holding a near 4.0 GPA. He has also made his community and school a better place through his volunteer work and Christian service. Bryce's talent and abilities make him rare, but it is character and ability to make everybody around him better that truly makes him special.”\n\n[Back to top]\n\nThis year’s Paul & Carolyn Berry Award recipient is Judy Allen from Trinity Baptist College (TBC).\n\nJudy Allen has been a part of Trinity Baptist College for the last decade, previously serving as the school's women's basketball coach and now serving as the Senior Women's Administrator (SWA) and Title IX Coordinator. During Allen's coaching career she was named the Trinity Baptist Coach of the Year twice. Now in athletic administration she supports the entire department through her representation of the Game Plan 4 LIFE character traits. The trait that most commonly was mentioned in Allen's leadership is the way she loves. Allen has a strong love for the Lord and scripture and consistently uses that love to exhort others.\n\n\"I observe the love that Judy has demonstrated to both students and fellow staff members regularly,\" said TBC Campus Pastor, Jeremiah Stanley. \"She consistently goes above and beyond to care for the needs of students, and they see her as more than a coach or authority person in their lives. They see her as a spiritual mentor, mother, protector, motivator, and encourager.\"\n\nDirector of Athletics John D. Jones added, \"At the heart of who Coach Allen is as a person is the love she demonstrates. If love is a verb, then Judy fits this definition perfectly. She doesn't just vocalize it, but her actions consistently show it.\"\n\n[Back to top]\n\nThis year’s Paul & Carolyn Berry Award recipient is Chad Mayes from Asbury University (AU).\n\nChad Mayes has been the Women's Basketball Head Coach and Mission Trip Coordinator at Asbury University for the last six years. On top of being named the 2023 Mideast Regional Coach of the Year, and leading a successful women's basketball program that has been to the NCCAA National Championships each of the last three seasons, Mayes works with LYNC8 Project and brings different Asbury programs to Puerto Rico every summer. Mayes does not just bring Asbury teams on this trip but has expanded his mission to leading teams across the United States on trips to Puerto Rico. Staff at Asbury shares how evident it is that Mayes uses coaching as a calling, and that his mission work is inspiring to all who have met him.\n\nVice President for Intercollegiate Athletics and University Communications Mark Whitworth states, \"Coach Mayes is one of the most committed and servant-minded leaders I have ever been around. His interaction and involvement extend well beyond the women's basketball team or the athletics department. Coach Mayes has earned the trust and respect of many on campus, from students and administrators, faculty, and staff.\"\n\n\"Coach Mayes faith is his bearing,\" said Asbury Faculty Athletic Representative and Assistant Professor of Accounting Emily Walsh. \"Faith exudes from him, and he is passionate about others experiencing the love of Christ through athletics cross-culturally.\"\n\n\"Chad's goal is not only for the people of Puerto Rico to be blessed, but also the members of each team as they reflect the faith that Chad and his wife Chandi show,\" stated Asbury Men's Basketball Coach Will Shouse.\n\n[Back to top]\n\nMeritorious Service Award\n\nPaul Berry, (Retired) The Masters University | Division I West Regional Coordinator, 2013-2024\n\nHailey Cavanagh, Concordia University Ann Arbor | Softball National Chair, 2021-2024\n\nJordan Strom, Manhattan Christian College | DII Men's Basketball National Chair, 2021-2024\n\nAmy Strong, Trinity Christian College | Division I North Central Regional Coordinator, 2018-2024\n\nWillie Williams, Carolina University | Division I Men's Basketball National Chair, 2021-2024\n\n[Back to top]\n\n#KingChasing Program\n\nThe #KingChasing program uses the four values of the Game Plan 4 LIFE - Love, Integrity, Faith, and Excellence - to enhance the purpose of collegiate athletics to be more than winning championships.
