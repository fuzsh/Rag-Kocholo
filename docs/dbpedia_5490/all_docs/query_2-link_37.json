(July 1, 2024) - The Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS) is announcing changes in its membership, including the addition of Asbury University, which has recently been accepted as a full member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the departure of Berea College.\n\nAddition of Asbury University\n\nThe CCS is thrilled to welcome Asbury University as a new member, effective July 1. Asbury's acceptance as a full member of the NCAA reflects their dedication to maintaining high standards in both academics and athletics. This acceptance also triggers the Eagles’ conference affiliation with the CCS, set to begin in the fall of 2024.\n\n“Asbury University is honored and excited to join the Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS),” said Dr. Kevin Brown, President of Asbury University. “We are proud to join a conference whose schools strive for academic rigor, student development, and high-level athletic performance that prioritizes effort, excellence, hospitality, and character. We are excited for the days ahead!”\n\n“This is a monumental step in the growth of Asbury Athletics. We are deeply grateful for the opportunities membership in the CCS will provide our student-athletes and coaches,” said Mark Whitworth, Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics & University Communications. “We will work diligently to represent the CCS in a way that reflects positively on the member institutions and fulfills our mission.”\n\nIn the CCS, team championships are sponsored in women's cross country, soccer, volleyball, basketball, softball, tennis, and track and field.

The conference and its member institutions express gratitude for the institution's contributions and achievements, as they have been instrumental in forming the conference.\n\n“We are grateful for our time in the CCS and the many great relationships formed with conference leadership and the tremendous group of institutions, their athletic departments and teams,” said Ryan Hess, Berea College’s Athletic Director. “The conference’s unwavering commitment to student-athletes and the student-athlete experience is truly commendable, and we eagerly anticipate the continued growth of the conference, and the impact they will continue to make in the lives of student-athletes for years to come.”\n\nIn their two years with the league, the Mountaineers achieved remarkable success, securing five championship titles in men’s and women’s cross country, back-to-back women’s basketball championships, and the women’s track and field title this past season. Additionally, they earned four runner-up titles in women’s cross country, men’s track and field, and women’s track and field.\n\n“We extend our heartfelt thanks to Berea for their commitment to academic and athletic excellence. Their departure marks the end of a successful chapter in our conference's history, and we wish them continued success in their future endeavors,\" said CCS Commissioner Beth Vansant.\n\nABOUT ASBURY UNIVERSITY\n\nAsbury University is a nationally ranked Christian liberal arts institution in Wilmore, Ky., with 15 academic departments offering more than 130 undergraduate areas of study, along with graduate degrees and online programs in business administration, media communication and education and an online bachelor’s degree program.
