        "text": "HELENA — Anna Cockhill (softball, University of Montana), Trey Moseman (men’s soccer, University of Colorado – Colorado Springs), and Liam McAdams (men’s soccer, Whitworth University) sat in front of pride-filled parents and loved ones and inked National Letters of Intent Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAll three athletes helped the Bruins achieve lofty heights, Cockhill with her bat and glove as Capital claimed a third-place trophy in 2022, and Moseman and McAdams with their legs during back-to-back quarterfinal appearances by the Bruins boys soccer team.\n\nCockhill’s signing, with a school both her parents attended and where her father played and coached football, firmed up a Bruins-to-Griz softball pipeline.\n\nThe three-time All-State shortstop (with a season to play) and Capital’s record-holder for career runs scored (123), Cockhill slashed .471/.598/.871/1.469 with six home runs, 26 RBI, and 23 stolen bases as a junior.\n\n“It’s special,” Cockhill said. “I’ve wanted to play Division I softball since I was little. It’s a big dream come true…I’m really happy everyone came and decided to support me. It feels good.”\n\nCockhill follows current Griz freshman Nyeala Herndon to Missoula.\n\nTeammates for three years, the duo swept the Western AA’s Player of the Year awards in 2022 and were stabilizing forces in the Bruins’ undefeated conference championship.\n\n“I loved playing with Nyeala and I miss her a lot,” Cockhill said. “I’m super excited to play with her again.”\n\nCockhill will also reunite with former Washington Ladyhawks teammate Rylee Rehbein on the Griz’s roster.\n\nCurrent Ladyhawks teammate Raygun Klippert, who was announced as one of Montana's five signees on Wednesday, will be Cockhill’s roommate.\n\nSometimes described as a perfectionist to a fault, Cockhill said it stems from her drive to be great.\n\nHer journey toward a Division I roster spot began with backyard catches with dad at six or seven years old, progressed into travel ball – on a 10U team – at eight years old, and then blossomed into Cockhill becoming one of the best Bruin softball players in program history.\n\n“She’s driven and this has always been a goal for her,” Capital head softball coach Mike Miller said.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of girls who’ve played for us, played shortstop, even been All-State, but she’s been the only girl who’s been our shortstop starting as a freshman and been All-State the whole time.”\n\nCockhill said she is receiving roughly a half-scholarship from UM and is currently undecided on an academic major.\n\nTeammates since eight years old, Moseman and McAdams shared one final special moment together on Wednesday seated beside each other with pens in hand.\n\n“We started off as teammates and we ended as brothers,” Moseman said. “We really built a family, especially over the last four years, with this tight-knit group at Capital…\n\n“I love every one of these boys. It sucks they can’t keep playing with me, but I’m really grateful for the time we did have to play together.”\n\n“It’s fantastic…We’ve kinda gone through the ranks together through club teams and being here playing for the same high school, and accomplishing the same dream,” McAdams said.\n\nThis year’s Class AA All-State soccer selections have yet to be announced, but Moseman very well could become a three-time honoree following a six-goal, 11-assist campaign.\n\nMoseman said he visited UCCS as a sophomore and quickly built a connection with assistant coach Keith Buderus.\n\nA member of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, UCCS fell in the conference tournament semifinals to Fort Lewis on Sunday. Currently 10-5-5 (5-2-3 conference), the Mountain Lions maintained a No. 11 ranking within the NCAA Super Region 4 on Wednesday.\n\nForty teams, 10 from each Super Region, qualify for the NCAA Division II Men’s Soccer Tournament. The full field will be announced on Monday.\n\nMoseman said he was excited to take the next step in his soccer career, playing a game he fell in love with as a child.\n\n“It was somewhere I could go and not think about anything else – just play and have fun,” Moseman said.\n\n“I love it.”\n\nMcAdams was an All-State defender as a junior and described Whitworth as the type of Christian community he wanted to join, a place where he could become the man he desires.\n\nWhitworth, which competes in the Northwest Conference, finished runner-up to Pacific Lutheran with a 12-4-4 (10-2-4 conference) record this season.\n\nBeckett Arthur, a Missoula Hellgate graduate, scored six goals and assisted on three others for the Pirates after entering the season a two-time first-team All-Northwest Conference selection.\n\nNCAA Division III does not award athletic scholarships, but McAdams is receiving academic aid as he plans to pursue a degree in electrical and mechanical engineering.\n\n“I wrote down on a piece of paper when I was 12 that I wanted to be a college soccer player,” McAdams said.\n\n“Here I am. It means a lot and it’s really fantastic to be here today...”\n\n“I couldn’t have made a better decision.”\n\nEmail Daniel Shepard at daniel.shepard@406mtsports.com or find him on Twitter/X @IR_DanielS.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nDaniel Shepard\n\nReporter\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
