        "text": "Of Mind & Heart Newsletter: March 2000\n\nAn update from Whitworth University President Bill Robinson\n\nMarch is the month when college students everywhere go through moods that swing back and forth between the peaks and the pits. But they never take their eyes off the prize.Spring Break. At Whitworth, occasional appearances by the sun, some absolutely great courses, and the richness of the Lenten season keep us from getting too far out of sorts. I hope March is going well for all of you, our Whitworth friends. Your interest and support mean so much to us. I have a small confession for those of you who read last month's Mind and Heart. My good wife Bonnie has accused me of embellishing her response to the researcher who asked her to \"rate the Whitworth president.\" Maybe I paraphrased a bit. But to my way of thinking, there's very little difference between her actual response, \"Above average,\" and my interpretation, \"He's a good kisser.\" It's just semantics, for goodness sakes. Well, again, I hope spring is off to a great start for you.\n\nAcademics\n\nThe focus of Whitworth's academic program is internal, on our students. But our academic activities do reach outside the \"Pine Cone Curtain.\" Here are a few examples:\n\nSenior Matt Lockard, a 3.9-GPA double major in math and philosophy, has received a $26,000 graduate fellowship from the Pew Younger Scholars Program. Matt was one of 11 finalists flown to the University of Notre Dame in January for an intense interview session. Way to go, Matt!\n\nAssociate Dean of Academic Affairs Gordon Jackson's penchant for pith has yielded his second published anthology, this one a book of Christian quotations titled Quotes for the Journey, Wisdom for the Way (NavPress). I love this book. It is an absolute treasure chest of wisdom, and just the right kind of reading for those of us who have the attention span of a hummingbird.\n\nOur English Department boasts nine students whose work has been accepted at the National Undergraduate Literature Conference at Weber State University in April. These students are Maggie Bullock, Annie Dwyer, Marla Meekhof, Emily Myers, Andrea Palpant, Josh Robbins, Brenna Robinson (rah!), Jeremiah Webster and Damian Westfall. They'll represent Whitworth well.\n\nBarb Sanders (Education) was one of four Washington educators selected to help develop the instrument and process for assessing pedagogy in the state's schools. This project is funded by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n\nMichael Young (Music) has been commissioned to compose music for Whitworth in recognition of his many years of service. Michael will retire at the end of next school year, and his work will be performed in spring 2001. Funds for the commission were donated enthusiastically by former music students, friends and faculty.\n\nHans Bynagle (Library) did a presentation, Internet Resources in Philosophy at a recent American Library Association conference attended primarily by philosophy and religion specialists from major university and research libraries.\n\nThe Whitworth College Jazz Band finished second to Brigham Young University at the 2000 Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival. Individual first-place awards went to Eric Gruber, bass, and Michael Jones, trumpet, in the jazz improvisation competition; and to Bryan Swenland for best college jazz band drummer. Although Dan Keberle's band usually brings home the blue ribbon, the Whitworth group did get the only standing ovation of the day. They swing hard.\n\nDue to the hard work of our faculty and the academic emphasis in our strategic plan, our academic grant-writing office has already exceeded the total number of grants sent out last year. Director Lynn Noland predicts that \"we should come close to doubling the amount of money we applied for last year.\" Next week, Bonnie and I will host a reception/conversation time for all faculty who've recently applied for grants.\n\nDuring Black History Month actor Rich Swingle presented his critically acclaimed one-person play about John Woolman, the passionate Quaker leader who spoke out against slavery more than a century before the Civil War. We also heard from Russell Moldovan, a leading authority on Martin Luther King's preaching. After interviewing more than 30 people who participated in King's pastoral ministry, Moldovan presented MLK's passion for justice as an extension of his commitment to Christ. These lectures were supplemented by the Black Student Union hosting Christian rap musicians, a dance performance, and readings by African-American poets and authors.\n\nEnrollment\n\nProcrastination is alive and well. In the last week of February we received 300 applications that just beat the March 1 deadline. This puts us at 1,020 applications (4 percent behind last year) for 375 spaces (8 percent fewer than were available last year). So we're pretty much where we want to be. Applications that come in after March 1 go on a waiting list, which we tap in May after the deposit deadline. Last year we were able to accommodate almost all of the wait-listed students. By the way, this spring's residence hall population is the largest on record. The second highest occupancy for this time of year was in 1975.\n\nWhen asked what I consider to be Whitworth's biggest challenge, I invariably respond, \"That we remain affordable to a wide range of students.\" As our Financial Aid Office has now begun putting together aid packages, many students and families anxiously await the outcome. I want you to know that these folks are helped enormously by your annual gifts and endowed scholarships. You put Whitworth within reach of many deserving students.\n\nParents, take note. If you have a student returning next year, and if you filed a FAFSA last year, you should have received your student's renewal application in the mail. The renewal application must be submitted to the federal processor by May 1. Awards will generally be sent to students in late May and June. You should also have received a 1098T IRS Form from our Student Accounts Office. This form is used to apply for education tax credits when you file your federal tax return.\n\nStudent Life\n\nMarch brings the Sadie Hawkins dance, where students dress as famous couples (I know two of our \"hair boys\" who could go as Rocky and Bullwinkle, with zero costume expense). This month will also offer a coffeehouse, a Hawaiian Club dance, student excursions to Phantom of the Opera, and the famed International Banquet with our students providing fabulous food and performances from around the world. One of the month's highlights will be the theatre production of Crimes of the Heart, and March will end with an all-campus Lazer-Tag game in Graves Gym.\n\nOne of the principal emphases in our new five-year strategic plan is to strengthen our effectiveness in helping students with their post-college careers. We are exploring ways to supplement and enrich the activities provided by our Career Services Office, but we're hardly starting from scratch. For example we just hosted Career Week 2000, in which students were provided information on proper deportment for a business interview, advice on how to develop a professional wardrobe economically, connections to potential internships, and the opportunity to attend an etiquette dinner with a professional consultant. Also, about 115 Whitworth students attended a career expo sponsored by a consortium of the four-year universities and colleges in Eastern Washington. More than 90 employers were represented. Career Week 2000 concluded with a rÃ©sumÃ© contest with prizes for the top submissions. The best thing we do for these students' careers is provide them with a relevant, high-quality education, but these other resources can be very helpful.\n\nResources\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I had a poignant moment with the men of Mac Hall. Just hours after a son was born to Billie Saunders and her late husband, Jim Saunders, '90 (the former Mac resident who was killed last fall in the line of duty as a Washington State Patrolman), a dozen guys from Mac met to lift up Billie and the Saunders family in prayer. I know I speak for the family in expressing appreciation to these guys and to all of Jim's classmates who have contributed to his memorial fund. David Harris, '91, is spearheading an effort to build a $25,000 scholarship endowment in Jim's memory.\n\nNearly 600 alumni, parents and friends made pledges to The Whitworth Fund in our Fall Phonathon. Thank you so much. Our fiscal year ends June 30 and we're a trifle behind schedule, so we're counting on these pledges.\n\nFor some 50 years Dave Weyerhaeuser provided clear direction and strong support as a Whitworth trustee. Less than a year ago, our dear friend died. His support, however, continues. We just received word that the Stewardship Foundation, which he established, will continue its annual support and contribute $1.5 million to the classroom initiative in our Faith in the Future Campaign. We are deeply appreciative to this great family.\n\nDixon Hall is now a shell. All interior walls have been removed, and framing for the new room layout is under way. The west end of the building has been removed to allow for construction of the new addition. We'll definitely be in these new classrooms sometime this fall.\n\nAthletics\n\nThe Whitworth women's basketball team made it to the NCAA Division III basketball tournament, but lost a heartbreaker to PLU in the first round. The Bucs finished the season at 18-8 and notched their first NCAA Tournament berth. The only other time the women's basketball team made a national tournament was in 1995, when the Pirates advanced to the second round of the NAIA Division II tournament under the superb coaching of Helen Higgs. Not all the honors have been awarded, but junior Jamie Wakefield was named to the 2000 GTE Academic All-District Team (college division), based on a vote by schools' sports information directors. With a 3.98 GPA and all-star athletic credentials, Jamie received the highest number of votes in our region and will now be entered into the selection process for national Academic All-America honors.\n\nThe Pirate swim teams finished second to UPS at the NWC championships. The women were led by senior Mindy Galbraith and junior Erin Kay, each of whom won two individual events. Mindy won the 500 and 1,650 freestyles, while Erin took the 200 and 400 individual medleys. Both have been invited to swim at the NCAA Division III Championship meet this weekend in Atlanta. The men were led by senior Ben Swinehart and sophomore Brent Rice. Ben matched Mindy and also won the 500 and 1,650 (both in meet-record time). Brent won the 200 IM and the 200 butterfly. Ben, whose time in the 500 free qualified him for the men's NCAA Championships in Atlanta next week, will be joined in Georgia by Brent and freshman Ryan Freeman, whose provisional times in their events earned them an invitation to the big meet.\n\nIn a ranking we rarely have cause to brag about (which is why you haven't seen it in one of these shamelessly self-congratulatory Mind and Hearts), we're looking good. After the winter seasons, the Northwest Conference \"all-sports\" top four colleges (based on their teams' finishes in fall/winter sports) are: 1. Willamette 2. Whitworth 3. Puget Sound 4. Pacific Lutheran. How 'bout those Bucs?\n\nAlumni\n\nJazz Cruise in Seattle, March 25: Join the Whitworth Jazz Combo, alumni, parents and friends aboard the Goodtime II for a cruise of Elliott Bay from 1-4 p.m. Cost is $12 per person and includes light refreshments. Contact the Alumni Office (509-777-3799, 800-532-4668, fyoung@whitworth.edu) for reservation information.\n\nWind and Jazz Ensemble Tour of Western Washington, March 18-25: Our acclaimed musicians will present a series of concerts with receptions for Whitworth alumni and friends to follow each performance.\n\nChoir Mini-tour to Central Washington, April 27-30: Beginning and ending with concerts in Spokane, the choir will be in Yakima on Friday, Apr. 28, and Wenatchee on Saturday, Apr. 29. More information soon.\n\nWhitworth Graduate School of International Management celebrations, May 18 and 19:The Fosseen Distinguished Lecture will take place on Thursday, May 18; the 19th will feature a retirement banquet for Director Dan Sanford. Don't miss either; more information later on both.\n\nFor many years Whitworth College and Young Life have enjoyed a special relationship. Countless Young Life alums have found Whitworth a great place to learn, grow and contribute. This fall, Young Life launches the Leadership Training Program for Young Life at Whitworth College. Kent McDonald, whose family will relocate to Spokane this summer after six years in Kenya, will direct the program. We welcome both the McDonalds and this new position.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nOnce in awhile I preach in churches. This really humbles me. I feel like the donkey carrying Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. It's an honor, but I never forget that the hosannas weren't exactly for the mule. This year it is my privilege to \"carry the Good News\" on the first Sunday of Lent. As I studied the Presbyterian Church's suggested text regarding the temptations of Christ, it occurred to me that our relentless goal-orientation can sucker us down wrong paths. Satan teased Jesus with three noble outcomes: satisfying his hunger, proving his deity, and delivering people from Satan's hold. But the evil was in the \"how.\" We dazzle our students with inspirational examples of \"how much,\" \"how many,\" and \"how high.\" But I'm dead sure that God's pleasure, and our true blessing, is mostly in just plain \"how.\" It may be that not too many of Whitworth's alumni will ever be listed in Forbes magazine as the nobles of \"how much\" (not that I would mind!), but there are tons of them out there serving their ways into the Who's Who of How. It's an honor to be associated with such good people. And, as always, we extend our gratitude to you for your part in their lives. Through them, you're touching the world.\n\nJust as this was about to be printed, we received the heart-breaking news that Whitworth General Maintenance Worker Dave Wright, a 20-year employee and member of one of Whitworth's longest-serving families, was killed in a tragic accident this morning. Dave was a treasure, and our love and prayers go out to his widow, Janet, who is our supervisor of grounds services, and to his entire family."
