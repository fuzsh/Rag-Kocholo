STAUNTON, Va. (WHSV) - Staunton Fire & Rescue responded to an unusual call for a possible cannonball found in the yard of a home on W Frederick Street.

The object was discovered by landscapers working in the yard of the home. Real estate agent, Jasin Singh with Innovation Properties said when the object was discovered, they thought it was a rock.

“This feels way too heavy to be a rock and one of them ended up rinsing it off and we saw that it was a metal ball and as soon as I saw that I thought ‘oh my God this is a cannonball,” said Singh.

Singh said this is not the first time he has been in this situation, and having been in a similar situation, had a better idea of the protocol that should be taken.

“I had something similar actually happen up in Front Royal and so that is why I was kind of bit more familiar with what to kind of do and I am thankful that I have some of that experience,” said Singh.

Perry Weller, Deputy Chief of Community Risk Reduction, with Staunton Fire & Rescue said this happened on Monday, April 8 and Staunton Fire-Rescue called Virginia State Police to dispose of the object.

“We assumed it was a Civil War-era cannonball because it can be very unstable so we treated it as it was a live ordinance,” said Weller.

Weller said if you find something unusual in the ground, leave it alone.

“Don’t pick it up, don’t toss it around, call us and we will get the proper authorities there to dispose of it,” said Weller.

It is possible for others to be in the city that have not been discovered yet, said Weller.

“In the last couple of years this is the second one that I can recall that has been discovered and we have had to call the Virginia State Police to assist with,” said Weller.

Weller said if you find something odd in your yard, to call the authorities so they can come out and take a look at what it is to determine if it needs to be disposed of.
