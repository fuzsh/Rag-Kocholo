Discover how we can help prepare and protect you and your family with our emergency dental care services.\n\nContinue reading for more information on what is considered a dental emergency or call our Staunton, Virginia office immediately at 540-885-2000 if urgent assistance is required!\n\nTypes of Dental Emergencies\n\nSo, what constitutes a dental emergency? When a toothache or another dental emergency strikes, the emergency team at Staunton Dental Care are trained to quickly respond by connecting you with a provider who can give prompt relief. We handle a wide range of emergency dental issues, which may include:\n\nToothaches- Severe pain is a sign that something is amiss. The longer you wait, the more difficult (and expensive) the solution. Rinsing out your mouth with warm saltwater will hopefully dislodge any trapped food between your teeth. If you are experiencing facial swelling, use a cold compress and acetaminophen for temporary relief.\n\nCut Tongue, Lip, or Cheek- For bleeding, apply pressure with sterile gauze to reduce the chances of infection and complication. Use your better judgment as well; if the cut looks significant, and bleeding does not seem to be subsiding, contact an emergency room.\n\nBroken, Cracked, or Chipped Tooth- Not sure what to do for a broken tooth? Start by rinsing the area with warm water. Place a cold compress over the site of the injury. If you can, recover any broken tooth fragments. If possible, save the tooth fragment and rinse both your mouth and the salvaged tooth pieces with warm water.\n\nKnocked Out Permanent Tooth- Recover the tooth and hold it by the crown (top), not the root. Rinse, but do not over-cleaning or over-handling. Put and hold the tooth in place using a clean piece of gauze or cloth. If reinsertion is impossible, carry the tooth in a cup of milk or water. Stopping the bleeding is most important. Don’t remove any attached tissue, they help re-secure the tooth!\n\nBroken Wires and Braces- If a wire breaks or sticks out of a bracket in your braces and pokes around your mouth, try and push it to a non-bothersome position. If you can’t do this, add a cotton swab until you can see your provider. Leave the wire as is. You may swallow it if cut.\n\nCold, Canker Sores, and Abscesses- Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen can provide temporary relief as well. Use only as directed. An abscess is a serious infection that typically occurs in the gumline around the teeth. If left alone, infections might spread to the body. Visit your emergency provider as soon as possible if you discover pain or swelling in the gums.\n\nTo expedite your care, Staunton Dental Care also recommends adding 540-885-2000 to your contacts so that, if an emergency happens, you can reach us immediately. Keeping our information handy will not only help you save valuable time; it could be important in helping to rescue an injured tooth.\n\nOther Dental Emergencies\n\nIf any other peculiar symptoms or pain persists, or you are wondering where to go for a dental emergency, please give us a call so we can help determine if you need to come into our practice or to the emergency room. With emergency dental care, you can spend less time worrying about if the dentist is open and more time fixing the problem at hand!\n\nHow to Avoid Dental Emergencies\n\nAccidents are unplanned, and therefore hard to prepare for. The best option for staying in front of a dental emergency is to be preventative. Schedule regular exams every six months and continue your regimen of good oral hygiene. Brush at least twice a day, floss once per day, and avoid brittle foods like hard candy that may do damage to your teeth!\n\nSchedule an Emergency Dental Care Service Today!\n\nAt Staunton Dental Care, we understand that the luxury of time is often unavailable when an emergency happens and that the need for rapid response can be nerve-wracking. When a dental emergency happens, your health and comfort are our first priority. If you are experiencing serious oral pain, call Staunton Dental Care directly at 540-885-2000."
