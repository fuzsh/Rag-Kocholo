        "text": "Tuesday, February 13, 1990\n\n90-28 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Structural Fire\n\nAround 3:30 a.m. on the 11th, a fire was discovered in Dormitory One at the Job Corps Center in Harpers Ferry. The Charlestown Fire Department was notified and responded. The fire caused approximately $30,000 in damage to the building, which was vacant and being renovated. The fire is considered suspicious in nature and is being investigated by the Park Police. (CompuServe report from Capt. Dave Blackburn, RAD/NCRO, 3 p.m. EST, 2/12/90).\n\nFriday, July 6, 1990\n\n90-182 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Drowning\n\nOn the afternoon of the 4th, S.M., 26, of Potomac, Maryland, was picnicking with four other adults and her five-year-old son on the ruins of Dam Number Three on the Potomac above Harpers Ferry. At about 4 p.m., S.M. and J.M., also 26, decided to go wading in the turbulent water flowing through a breach in the dam. According to one account, S.M. yelled \"Let's go for a swim\", then jumped into the rapids. She was immediately pulled under by the hydraulic current, surfaced briefly, then disappeared from sight. Her body was found five hours later, trapped beneath a log in the hydraulic. In response to later questioning, J.M. mentioned that he had nearly drowned in the same spot two years earlier. Alcohol is believed to be a contributing factor in the incident. (CompuServe message from Bob Mackreth, Acting CR, HAFE, 7/5).\n\nWednesday, October 17, 1990\n\n90-368 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Planned Demonstration\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Chapter of the International Committee Against Racism (INCAR) has requested a permit to conduct a demonstration in the park on the 21st. During last year's demonstration, rangers and Park Police officers worked together to ensure that there were no incidents, and Park Police will again be providing support to the park this weekend. We'll advise you of the outcome next week. (Telefaxed report from Capt. Marvin Ellison, RAD/NCRO, 10/16).\n\nTuesday, October 23, 1990\n\n90-378 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Search\n\nOn the afternoon of the 20th, Dale Walser, 28, of G.B., Maryland, was fishing along the Armory Canal when he wandered off toward the nearby CSX railroad tracks. (Companions became worried when he failed to return after an extended period of time and notified rangers, who searched the area without success. Several hours later, Walser was found hitchhiking along Interstate 70 nearly 20 miles away. He explained that he had impulsively hopped on a slow-moving freight train, then was afraid to jump off when the train gathered speed. Alcohol is believed to be a factor in the incident. (CompuServe message from Harvey Sorenson, CR, HAFE, 10/22).\n\nWednesday, October 24, 1990\n\n90-368 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Follow-up on Demonstration\n\nThe International Committee Against Racism (InCAR) demonstrated in the park for an hour on the afternoon of the 21st. Approximately 50 people were involved. The demonstration was very peaceful. Very few members of the public or visitors to the park expressed any concerns about the demonstration. A detail of rangers and Park Police officers provided security for the event. (Telefaxed report from Capt. Marvin Ellison, RAD/NCRO, 10/23).\n\nWednesday, February 19, 1992\n\n92-40 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - ARPA Case\n\nOn the afternoon of February 16th, park visitors reported seeing two men using metal detectors in the Six Gun Battery on Maryland Heights. Rangers Bob Mackreth and Bruce Hasson responded. Hasson spotted a man holding a metal detector and dressed in camouflage hiding amid some rocks. When the man fled, Hasson gave chase, but slipped and injured his ankle in the rocky terrain. Although the man escaped, rangers impounded his metal detector, a digging implement and a sack with 275 Civil War era bullets. Inspection of the area revealed over 30 illegal excavations, all believed done during that day. An archeological assessment is underway. Hasson is expected to be out of work for at least a week with a badly sprained ankle. [Telefax from Bob Mackreth, HAFE, 2/17]\n\nFriday, October 16, 1992\n\n92-563 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Capture of Homicide Suspect\n\nOn October 9th, a Brunswick, Maryland, police officer attempted to stop a vehicle bearing only a rear tag which was being driven by a man who appeared to be wearing a ski mask. It was soon determined that the vehicle was stolen, and a chase ensured that ended in the park when the operator abandoned his vehicle just beyond the railroad station house. The town's police chief and ranger Bill Scholfield were among the first to arrive on scene. Gunshots were exchanged between the vehicle's driver and other officers (Scholfield did not fire), but no one was hit. Other officers soon arrived and negotiations with the man were begun. One aspect of these negotiations involved putting the man in contact with his mother, which was done through park dispatch. That contact significantly aided the negotiation process; he finally relinquished his weapon and was taken into custody. Ballistics test conducted on the gun indicated that it had been involved in four homicides over the past 12 months. Other information revealed that the man was also a probable suspect in several bank robberies which occurred in nearby jurisdictions. [Capt. Marvin Ellison, RAD/NCRO, 10/15]\n\nTuesday, March 16, 1993\n\n93-115 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Storm Impacts\n\nThe winter storm which struck the Mid-Atlantic area on March 4th and 5th caused about $50,000 in damage to the park. Following the intense rainfall which dropped about three inches throughout the area on the 4th, the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers, which meet within the park, began to rise and forecasters predicted a river crest which would likely flood two buildings - the information center and bookstore in Building 45 and the ranger station in Building 33. Flooding was also expected in the Hamilton Street area, which would affect a pumping station, parking lot, the new pedestrian bridge to Virginius Island and other nearby resources. Maintenance employees removed wayside exhibits, signs, trash barrels, wagons, books and bookcases, and other items; rangers contacted owners of vehicles regarding their removal. Much of the area was closed to visitor use. Although the river crested a bit lower than expected in the early hours of March 6th, the entire Hamilton Street area was nonetheless flooded. Water extended into the bus parking lot and into the area between the lot and blacksmith shop. Shenandoah Street was not affected. Cleanup began at 7 a.m., but the park remained closed that day because of the failure of the pump at the pumping station. The park reopened on Sunday. Damage estimates are based on the cost to resurface areas, remove silt and debris, reinstall waysides and signs, dredge a canal, replace topsoil, repair the pumping station, repair roofs, remove and/or repair tree damage, and pump basements and remove silt from Buildings 32 and 33. [Donald Campbell, Superintendent, HAFE, 3/9]\n\nWednesday, June 9, 1993\n\n93-339 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Rescue\n\nOn the afternoon of June 6th, R.C., 20, fell approximately 30 feet from a steep crevasse near the face of Maryland Heights. R.C. had been free-climbing (unregistered) with friends when she lost her handhold and fell backwards. She suffered severe lacerations to the head, back and lower extremities and a possible fracture to the right arm. Rangers Bruce Hasson, David Tucker and Jeff Carlisle were first on scene and began rescue efforts. Members of Frederick County's advanced technical rescue team provided assistance by setting up rescue lines and a Z rig enabling a hand rescue to the top of the heights. Once at the top, R.C. was evacuated in Eagle I, the Park Police helicopter. Pilot Ron Galey and rescue technicians Kevin Chittick and Fred Davis conducted the evacuation in high winds and were cited by the park for their excellent work in the rescue. R.C. was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment; full recovery is expected. The successful rescue was attributed to close cooperation between all participating agencies. Hasson was the incident commander for the operation. [Harvey Sorenson, CR, HAFE, 6/7]\n\nMonday, December 13, 1993\n\n93-849 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Shooting Incident; Theft\n\nThe park received a report of gunshots being fired directly behind park quarters early on the afternoon of December 5th. The responding ranger arrived at the scene in time to see two individuals - K.S. and F.S. - discharging blackpowder weapons. The two fled, but were soon caught along with a third person. Three blackpowder rifles and three blackpowder revolvers were confiscated, and their vehicle was impounded for license tag violations. A weapons check through NCIC revealed that three of the weapons were stolen. When the S.s returned for their vehicle on December 7th, they were met and questioned by a Clarke County detective. They confessed to the theft of the weapons during a reenactment held near Winchester, Virginia, last October. The two stated that they enjoyed planning and carrying out \"raids\" on Union reenactment groups during their encampments. Following their confession, they were arrested by a Harpers Ferry officer for bringing stolen property into the state of West Virginia. The pair also face indictment in the state of Virginia. The park is working with an assistant U.S. attorney on the disposition of the remaining three weapons. [HAFE, 12/10]\n\nWednesday, June 8, 1994\n\n94-273 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Rescue\n\nOn May 29th, R.W., 23, of Ashburn, Virginia, was free climbing by himself on the east side of Maryland Heights when he fell between 60 and 80 feet and sustained fractures to his ribs, pelvis, leg and ankle. Responding rangers stabilized R.W. and evacuated him by helicopter to the University of Maryland's shock-trauma center. A full recovery is expected. [Terry Hall, HAFE, 6/6]\n\nFriday, September 8, 1995\n\n95-593 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Suspicious Package: Center Evacuation\n\nShortly after 4:30 p.m. on September 5th, an employee at the Interpretive Design Center in Harpers Ferry reported a suspicious package in his office. Efforts were made to determine the origin of the package; when they proved unsuccessful, law enforcement rangers were notified. Ranger Robert Sampsell assessed the situation and determined that the package and circumstances surrounding its placement in the building met a majority of the indicators of a potential bomb. The building was cleared and assistance was requested from a bomb team and local police and fire departments. Shortly after the local units were on site and a safe zone had been established, a center employee came forward and said that the package contained a gag gift for another employee. By that time, however, the decision had been made to continue to treat the incident as a potential bomb threat until the Army bomb team from Fort Indiantown Gap in Pennsylvania could remove the package and declare the area \"safe.\" This was accomplished at 10:30 pm. Investigation revealed that the incident was the result of an in-house prank that went sour. [Harvey Sorenson, CR, HAFE]\n\nMonday, January 22, 1996\n\n96-17 - Mid-Atlantic Areas - Flooding\n\nThe heavy rains which fell throughout the Mid-Atlantic regions and New England on Friday, January 19th, coupled with the melting of several feet of snow throughout the area, caused severe flooding in several parks. The following reports - some preliminary and by phone - were received as of this morning; more are expected later today:\n\n* Harpers Ferry - Flooding was expected to reach half way up the walls of historic building in the park, which is at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers. The park is closed.\n\n[CR, CHOH; Einar Olsen, RAD/NCFO; Bill Halainen, IO, Wet and Wild Incident, DEWA]\n\nWednesday, February 21, 1996\n\n96-61 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Death of Eight Job Corp Corpsmen\n\nThe eight passengers killed in the February 16th accident between the Maryland commuter train and the Amtrak passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland, were all corpsmen at the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Center. All were in their late teens and early 20's and were from metropolitan areas on the East Coast. They were on leave and heading home for the three-day weekend at the time of the crash. Counselors from the field area's employee assistance program provided counseling to other corpsmen and the center's staff. A memorial service will be held at the center this Friday morning. Labor Secretary Robert Reich will speak; representatives from the NPS will include NCFA Director Robert Stanton and a delegation of about a dozen interpretive and protection rangers. The latter will serve as greeters and as members of the color guard. [Bill Lynch, Einar Olsen, NCFO]\n\nMonday, February 26, 1996\n\n96-61 - Harpers Ferry (West Virginia) - Follow-up on Death of Corpsmen\n\nOn Friday, February 23rd, approximately 300 people attended a memorial service for the eight Job Corps students who had been killed in the train accident the previous week. The service began with presentation of colors by the NPS color guard from the National Capital Area. Letters from President Clinton, Secretary Babbitt and Secretary Reich were read. Senator Barbara Mikulski was the principal speaker. Biographies of the students were read; a candle lighting ceremony followed. Numerous officials and community leaders attended the event. [Bill Lynch, LES, NCFO]\n\nMonday, September 9, 1996\n\n96-511 - East Coast Areas - Follow-up on Hurricane Fran\n\nReports on the impacts of Hurricane Fran have been received from a number of Eastern parks. Of particular note is the fact that the flooding along the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers has in most cases been as or more severe than that which occurred during January, making this the first year since the National Weather Service began keeping track early this century that areas along those rivers have been hit by two major floods. As of Sunday night, the Potomac was flowing past Little Falls in Maryland at more than 300,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) - 130 times the normal volume. When the Shenandoah River crested on Saturday, it had a flow rate of 153,000 cfs, or more than 200 times its typical rate.\n\no Harpers Ferry - No word has yet been received from the park, but media reports indicate that the area is closed due to severe flooding. Employees moved more than 5,000 artifacts from the museums and exhibit halls along low-lying Shenandoah Street. By Sunday afternoon, about two dozen historic buildings on the street were flooded and the street was covered with chest-high water.\n\n[Greg Styles, IC, SHEN; Kevin Fitzgerald, CHOH; Gary Pollock, GWMP; Sandy Ailey, PIO, NCFA; Jim Fox, BLRI; Bob Woody, CI&VS, CAHA; Newt Sikes, CUIS; John Breen, FOPU; Andrew Loveless, Superintendent, KIMO; John Tucker, Superintendent, FOSU; Chuck Harris, CR, CALO; Mike Johnson, CR, FRSP; Washington Post]\n\nTuesday, September 10, 1996\n\n96-511 - East Coast Areas - Follow-up on Hurricane Fran\n\nDamage reports are beginning to filter in as flood waters recede and park staffs gain access to their areas:\n\no Harpers Ferry - Water levels crested on Sunday at approximately 29 feet, 11 feet above flood stage. The park will remain closed at least though the week, and park museums will be closed until further notice. Thousands of visitors parked on adjacent town streets and walked to the edge of the closure area to view the river. The flood waters put up to six feet of water in 17 of the Lower Town historic buildings. Damage assessments will be available when the waters recede. The economic impact to the park and the local merchants as a result of an expected decrease in visitation could be significant. At least one merchant adjacent to the park boundary suffered damage due to flooding.\n\n[Mark Hardgrove, SAJU; Mark Woods, VIIS]\n\nMonday, September 16, 1996\n\n96-511 - East Coast Areas - Follow-up on Hurricane Fran\n\nAdditional reports on the impacts of Hurricane Fran have been received:\n\no Harpers Ferry - The park remains closed. Employees are continuing extensive clean-up and emergency repairs to the area and working closely with town officials and businesses to reopen the park. Railroad crews and heavy equipment are in the park repairing track; a half-mile of rail bed was swept away by the Shenandoah River at several locations within the park. Plans were to reopen the park on Saturday except for those areas which remain too hazardous for public use. This flood was six inches higher at Harpers Ferry than last January's flood. Damage is extensive and will take months to repair.\n\nThe preliminary cost estimate for repairs to National Capitol Field Area parks has reached $380,000, but does not include long-term rehabilitation and restoration of roads, trails and museums. Damage at present does not appear to be as severe as that inflicted by last January's flood. [Don Boucher, FMO, NCSO; Ann Childress, CR, FOSU Group; Harvey Sorenson, CR, HAFE; Jim Fox, BLRI]\n\nThursday, March 5, 1998\n\n98-90 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV/MD) - Probable Arson\n\nThe operator of a passing train reported a fire in an empty park building around 4:50 a.m. on February 21st. Responding rangers and volunteer firefighters found a small office area engulfed in flames. The fire was quickly extinguished. It appears that asbestos wall panels prevented it from spreading throughout the building. Rangers found that the front door had been forced open; arson was accordingly suspected. An investigation was conducted that day by an ATF arson investigator brought to the scene by regional law enforcement specialist Bill Lynch. The building, constructed in 1925 on an old mill site dating back to 1854, had housed two water-powered generators. The damage has been estimated at $10,000. [Harvey Sorenson, CR, HAFE, 3/5]\n\nThursday, April 23, 1998\n\n98-155 - Harpers Ferry NHP/Appalachian Trail (WV) - Special Event\n\nPresident Clinton and vice president Gore visited the park yesterday to celebrate Earth Day and worked on a section of the Appalachian Trail, which passes through the park, with members of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. They helped revegetate a heavily used section of the trail near Jefferson Rock, a famous landmark, and also assisted in resetting stone steps installed several years ago by volunteer trail crews. The visit provided a forum for highlighting volunteerism on the trail and in other national parks and for presenting the administration's upcoming agenda on park and environmental matters. Director Stanton and other dignitaries also spoke. The event was managed by park staff and the Secret Service; assistance was provided by rangers from a number of nearby parks and officers from the Park Police and West Virginia State Police. [Robert Gray, CR, ANST, 4/22]\n\nTuesday, July 14, 1998\n\n98-385 - Harpers Ferry NHP (MD/WV/VA) - Fatal Bicycling Accident\n\nOn July 12th, G.R, 63, of Centereach, New York, died as a result of head injuries he'd sustained in an accident in the park two days previously. G.R. has been bicycling downhill at a high rate of speed when he apparently locked his breaks, lost control, and struck his head. He was not wearing a helmet. Ranger Melissa Hancock is investigating. [Henry Berberich, RLES, NCRO, 7/13]\n\nThursday, December 3, 1998\n\n98-737 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV/MD/VA) - Rescue\n\nOn November 18th, the park received a report that C.S., 55, of Hancock, Maryland, had fallen and suffered an injury while hiking in the Maryland Heights unit. Dispatcher Gary Butera employed a spotting scope from the lower town area of the park to locate C.S. and direct rescuers to her, including rangers David Tucker and Melissa Hancock and members of several local fire departments. C.S. was stabilized, immobilized and carried out to a waiting four-wheel-drive rescue vehicle; she was then taken to a hospital in Hagerstown, Maryland, where she underwent surgery to repair an open fracture to her left forearm.

Tests are currently being conducted to determine what happened to him. [Gary Cummins, Manager, HFC, 3/25]\n\nTuesday, March 30, 1999\n\n99-103 - Harpers Ferry Center (WV) - Follow-up: Serious Employee Illness\n\nMichael Alvarez, the center's deputy associate manager for support services, has recovered from his recent hospitalization and has returned to work. Mike collapsed at his home on the night of March 24th and was taken to the emergency room at a local hospital, then placed in intensive care. Doctors subsequently determined that he'd suffered a toxic reaction to a new antibiotic that he'd received - within 12 hours, it had basically killed all microorganisms in his body. [Gary Cummins, Manager, HFC, 3/29]\n\nThursday, July 1, 1999\n\n99-322 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV/MD/VA) - Assist at Fire; HazMat Response\n\nOn June 25th, an estimated 2,000 vehicles were destroyed by fire at an auto salvage yard adjacent to the park. Rangers responded to a request for assistance from Harpers Ferry PD and assisted in traffic control. The salvage yard is located in a drainage which flows through park wetlands to the Shenandoah River. Anticipating a significant flow of contaminated water through the drainage from the estimated 100,000 gallons of water used to suppress the fire, rangers formed a containment dam of petroleum absorbing pads and monitored the flow. The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the EPA had on-scene coordinators present, and they determined that the flow was not as toxic as first feared due to the complete combustion of the petroleum products. The salvage yard operator was cited by state DEP for failing to have a state runoff permit and a monitoring program. [Larry Johnson, CR, HAFE, 6/29]\n\nThursday, July 1, 1999\n\n99-324 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV/MD/VA) - Special Event\n\nThe park held it's annual Independence Day celebration, \"Freedom's Birth: An American Experience,\" on June 26th. A full slate of educational and musical programs occurred throughout the day, culminating in a fireworks display that evening. An estimated 12,000 visitors attended. Park Police, local law enforcement agencies, and rangers from adjacent parks assisted in managing the event. There were no major incidents. Rangers Todd Bolton and Nancy Stanley planned the event. [Larry Johnson, CR, HAFE, 6/29]\n\nWednesday, February 16, 2000\n\n00-046 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV/MD/VA) - Death of Employee\n\nOn February 14th, budget analyst Dorie Lent collapsed while at work at the park's administrative headquarters. Rangers and park EMT's provided medical attention and life support until an ambulance and county EMS personnel arrived. Dorie was transported to Jefferson Memorial Hospital in Charles Town, where she died from a heart attack. Dorie had been with the Service for over 16 years. She worked at Northwest Alaska Areas from 1983 to 1987, Christiansted NHP from 1987 to 1990, Virgin Islands NP from 1990 to 1995, and at Harpers Ferry NHP since 1995. Funeral arrangements are pending and will be announced as soon as they are available.

The train stopped at the Harpers Ferry train station adjacent to the park to evacuate it's 145 passengers. While a bomb sniffing dog was brought in, park staff assisted the Harpers Ferry Police Department by establishing a perimeter and were available to provide EMS. After the dog cleared the carry-on baggage, four of the park's shuttle buses and a handicapped accessible van were used to transport the passengers to the Brunswick, Maryland, train station ten miles away. This was done at the request of CSX Railroad. The dog didn't find a bomb on the train. No injuries or property damage were reported, but numerous commuter trains were disrupted. The FBI is investigating. Media interest is high. [Larry Johnson, CR, HAFE, 3/28]\n\nFriday, June 29, 2001\n\n01-317 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV/MD/VA) - Assist; Multiple Rescues\n\nOn Saturday, June 9th, a large group of Boy Scouts and their leaders were canoeing on the rain-swollen Potomac River adjacent to the park when their canoes capsized. Two Maryland State Police helicopters attempted unsuccessfully to retrieve the victims. Using the helicopters as spotters, Rangers Robbie Sampsell and David Mayeski responded in the park's jet-drive zodiac boat while Ranger Ryan Levins coordinated shore-based efforts with the local responders. A total of eight scouts and leaders were rescued by rangers, who had to interrupt the rescue effort to rescue nine local volunteer fire company responders whose three boats swamped or capsized. The rescues were conducted in Class IV whitewater flowing at above normal stage. River advisories were in effect due to high water. The incident occurred during an unrelated park special event. [Larry Johnson, CR, HAFE, 6/22]\n\nMonday, September 24, 2001\n\n01-521 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV) - Rescue\n\nEarly on September 10th, the park received a report of two people who were overdue from an exploration of John Brown's Cave, an extensive system of caves long closed to public access for safety reasons. The cave is in the park, but the entrance is on CSX Railroad property directly adjacent to heavily-used railroad tracks. Rangers found the explorers' vehicle parked outside the park near the cave entrance. Its contents indicated that the pair were probably in the cave. The rangers also found that the metal gate blocking the entrance had been defeated. Seven local cave rescuers, including ranger Fred Viers of George Washington Memorial Parkway, conducted a search of the cave. CSX special agents held train traffic to a minimum during the operation. Ranger David Mayeski accompanied the team into the cave. Ranger Heather Irwin's investigation revealed that the 36-year-old man and his eight-year-old son had left home the previous morning, intending to return the same day. The father had a history of depression and alcohol and drug use and had recently been released from a drug rehab center. A pending divorce and child custody hearing made child abduction a possibility. After a two-hour search, the father and son were found 2,000 feet into the cave; they were wet, tired, and hungry, but otherwise healthy despite over 24 hours in 50-degree temperatures. Local media interest was high. The father was cited for being in a closed area and cost recovery is being pursued. Ranger Todd Roeder was IC. [Larry Johnson, CR, HAFE]\n\nThursday, November 29, 2001\n\n01-622 - Harpers Ferry NHP (MD/VA/WV) - Special Event\n\nA filming permit was issued this fall to director Ron Maxwell to film the major motion picture \"Gods and Generals\" in the park over two days in October and six days in November, each period preceded by several days of extensive set construction. Over 600 cast, crew, and extras were in the park to film the $58 million dollar Ted Turner production, billed as the biggest Civil War movie ever made. The film is a prequel to the movie \"Gettysburg\". Actors Robert Duvall, Jeff Daniels, Bruce Boxleitner, Stephen Lang, C. Thomas Howell, and Kevin Conway were very gracious, signing autographs and posing for pictures with park visitors and staff. The park was open as usual and interpretive staff helped minimize impacts on visitors. The event was managed under ICS. Extra protection and black powder safety staff from other parks helped ensure physical security. The park required a deposit of $100,000 for cost recovery, a performance bond of $50,000, and $2,000,000 in insurance protection from the production company. The event went smoothly; resource and visitor impacts were minimal. A First Amendment permit was issued to a local merchant protesting the loss of business due to street closures during filming.

[Delia Garza, HFC, 3/21]\n\nThursday, May 16, 2002\n\n02-176 - Harpers Ferry NHP (WV/MD/VA) - ARPA Investigation\n\nRanger Ryan Levins discovered that a series of holes had been dug along a park trail in the Maryland Heights section of the park late on the afternoon of Saturday, January 26th. The holes appeared to have been dug recently, as they came after a period of substantial rain. Rangers secured the area and began an ARPA investigation. With the help of park archeologists, they processed the scene over a period of two-and-a-half days. A total of 156 holes were found in the area, once a Civil War campsite. Evidence that has been collected is awaiting analysis by the Park Police lab. Damage to park resources and cost of repair and recovery has been estimated to be in excess of $20,000. The case has received some local press attention, and rangers hope to thereby gain information on the violators. Levins is the case officer.

On May 20th, the two men, who had entered pleas pursuant to plea agreements to one count each of misdemeanor ARPA violations, were sentenced in magistrate's court. Their fines were $225 and $75, respectively; they also got two years' probation each and are required to publish a half-page notice on their case and conviction once a week for three successive weeks in two local newspapers. Damage assessments were prepared for the case, but were not used in the plea agreement. The park is now considering civil action under 16 USC 19jj to recover costs of the investigation and damage assessment and for restoration of the affected resources.

His supervisor assigned him to seasonal quarters, and he unpacked some items and told his roommate that he was going out to get something to eat. When he failed to appear at work the next day, a check was made. S.W., his vehicle, and all his belongings were gone. Ranger John McCutcheon subsequently received a note from S.W.'s father advising him that a female friend of his son's had received an email message from him with some suicidal phrases in it. S.W. was entered into NCIC as a missing person. An old girlfriend of S.W. then reported receiving emails from him that put him on the road to Wupatki NM, where he'd also worked as a volunteer. A nationwide lookout was issued. On July 21st, S.W. was found at a motel by police officers in Winslow, Arizona. S.W. agreed to be committed to a local hospital. His employment at Harpers Ferry was terminated.

Ranger Ryan Levins found the two visitors, who were uninjured by shaken up. Investigation revealed that they'd avoided a noisy charge by six pigs by moving to cover and throwing a rock at them. They were able to provide accurate descriptions of their assailants, including length, color and types of snouts and tails. Levins located two of the assailants on an adjacent property owner's land, returned them to their pens, and left a note for the owner asking that he repair his fence. At the time of the report, the other four assailants were still at large. An APB has been issued and they've been entered into NCIC.

Rangers Robert Baker and David Tucker responded and found that the woman had attempted suicide by ingesting up to 15 Xanax pills. She said that she'd come to the park to die because it was the only place where she'd been happy and because rangers had always been nice to her. She was taken to a county hospital for treatment.\n\n[Submitted by Scot McElveen, Chief Ranger]\n\nThursday, September 18, 2003\n\nEast Coast Areas\n\nIsabel Comes Calling\n\nEastern parks in the path or potential path of Isabel have completed preparations. As a precautionary measure, one of the Service's two national Type 1 teams (JD Swed's team) has staging in Charlotte, North Carolina, in order to be prepared to respond as needed to any park or area. A number of Type 2 teams are also on standby.\n\nAll federal agencies in the Washington area are closed today, including the NPS Washington Office. OPM will monitor the weather and make a determination later today on whether or not offices will reopen on Friday.\n\nHere's a rundown on the status of many of the parks in or near the storm's path (south to north):\n\nHarpers Ferry NHP - Normal park operations were suspended at noon yesterday and the park's flood plan was activated. The park is operating under ICS. Preparations are being made to remove artifacts, exhibits, equipment, etc. from the historic Lower Town. Although it's hard to predict how much rain will fall in the Potomac and Shenandoah River basins (the two rivers meet in Harpers Ferry), the park is basing its preparations on a flood level of 28.5 feet, which would be 10.5 feet above flood stage. The park was closed to the public today and will remain closed until further notice. All park employees will assist with moving the contents of Lower Town buildings. The entire operations should be completed by early this afternoon. The process is labor-intensive, involving emptying the bottom floors of over 20 historic structures into five tractor-trailers and moving the contents out of the flood plain.\n\nThis summary was compiled from reports submitted by Ken Garvin, SERO; Brenda Ritchie, EICC, SHEN; Russ Wilson, Superintendent, SAHO/GATE; Ann Childress, Superintendent, MOCR; Mark Hardgrove, Assistant Superintendent, CAHA; Mike Litterst, PIO, COLO; Bob Kirby, Superintendent, PETE; Wayne Valentine, IC, FIIS; José Rosario, Acting Chief, Park Operations Support, GATE; Cindy MacLeod, Superintendent, RICH; William Kenyon, NCR Dispatch; Scot McElveen, Chief Ranger, HAFE; Wayne Sanders, Chief of Maintenance, GEWA/THST; Tom Nash, Chief Ranger, COLO; Russ Smith, Superintendent, FRSP; Clay Jordan, IC, SHEN; Steven Ambrose, Park Ranger, HOFU; Frank Mills, IC, STLI; Ed Whitaker, IC, DEWA.\n\nMonday, September 22, 2003\n\nEast Coast Areas\n\nHurricane Isabel Slams Virginia, Carolina Parks\n\nHurricane Isabel caused moderate to extensive damage in many parks within Southeast, National Capital and Northeast Regions. As of yesterday, 36 parks had reported damage sufficient to require the preparation of conditions assessments. Although most of these parks are not requesting any additional assistance, several have sustained damage sufficient to warrant oversight of recovery efforts by incident management teams.\n\nHere's a rundown on the affected parks (south to north), excluding those that reported negligible impacts:\n\nHarpers Ferry NHP - The park has downed trees and is without power, but there was no significant street damage. The Shenandoah River was expected to crest at 20.4 feet on Saturday, which would not be high enough to flood buildings.\n\nAdditional reports will appear daily during recovery operations, which will likely go on for some time.

Initial recovery efforts were hampered by heavy rain that fell on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, causing new flood damage in many areas already affected by Isabel.\n\nThe following reports were received from parks and regions over the past 24 hours. They are listed from south to north. This information either supplements or revises information previously reported; no effort is being made to recap earlier submissions with each new summary.\n\nThrough the assistance of David Duran in the Service's National Information Systems Center in Denver, URL's are posted below for maps of three of the hardest hit parks - Cape Lookout, Cape Hatteras, and Colonial - so that readers can more easily determine referenced locations.

Early work efforts are focused on orienting personnel to the operations, with a heavy emphasis on safety due to the increased hazards involved in tree removal operations, especially with vehicle traffic. Team members are also holding short training sessions on ICS for newly-arrived personnel, as there are many people coming to this incident with minimal previous exposure to the system. The FMSS team continues to compile and input facilities assessment information received from the 38 park units that sustained hurricane-related damage. The preliminary assessment has been 100% completed by the parks. The FMSS team members are going out to parks beginning today to conduct comprehensive condition assessments. Crews will continue work on clearing the Yorktown Battlefield tour road in Colonial NHP. Additional crews and other resources were dispatched yesterday to Fredericksburg/Spotsylvania NMP, Richmond NB and Petersburg NB to work on tree clearing and other cleanup operations.\n\nMany employees working in the parks being managed in this incident are still without power at home. These same employees have been working for extended hours with little or no time off for over a week. A three-person Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) team was scheduled to arrive in Williamsburg yesterday. They will make arrangements to provide assistance to park employees dealing with incident-related stress\n\nRick Brown's Type 2 team, which is focusing on four sites in what's being called the North Carolina Seashore Area, is divided into two branches. The Outer Banks Group branch has four divisions - one for Wright Brothers and Fort Raleigh, one for Bodie Island, one for Hatteras Island, and one for Ocracoke Island; the Cape Lookout branch has two divisions - one for Core Banks and one for Portsmouth Village.\n\nPrincipal problems confronting personnel on this operation have to do with the time and distances between locations and the amount of travel required. Operations are underway in all divisions.\n\nPark Updates\n\nThe following reports were received from parks and regions over the past 24 hours. They are listed from south to north. This information either supplements or revises information previously reported; no effort is being made to recap earlier submissions with each new summary.\n\nHarpers Ferry NHP - About 90% of the lower town has been reopened.

He picked it up and was carrying it out when the bag started to tear. Tucker opened the bag and found a neatly folded sheet and metal weights inside. After obtaining proper evidence collection supplies, he investigated further and found the body of an infant boy inside. Tucker and other rangers secured the crime scene and contacted appropriate federal, state and local law enforcement authorities. County officers and the medical examiner arrived on scene shortly thereafter. An autopsy was conducted last week; preliminary results indicated that the infant died from trauma, most likely in the fall from the bridge  about 80 feet. The investigation is continuing.\n\n[Submitted by Scot McElveen, Chief Ranger]\n\nThursday, August 26, 2004\n\nHarpers Ferry National Historical Park (WV)\n\nCar Clout Arrest\n\nThe August 7th arrest of T.C., 20, of Jefferson County, Maryland, during an attempted car clout in the park brought to conclusion a summertime spree of burglaries and petit larcenies in that county. Ranger Mark Howard caught T.C. near the Dam #3 area, where he'd been patrolling each day for several weeks because of a tip he'd received. Howard saw T.C. and his girlfriend acting suspiciously in the Dam #3 parking lot; he immediately called for backup and detained them until ranger Tim Morrison and a Harpers Ferry PD officer arrived on scene. Both were taken into custody. T.C.'s arrest lead to 15 other charges being filed against him, including six counts of petit larceny, four counts of burglary, three counts of destruction of property, and two counts of breaking and entering an automobile. He's being held on $100,000 bail. The arrest concluded a multi-agency operation focusing on car clouts in the Harpers Ferry area. The operation, led by rangers Morrison and Ryan Peabody, was two pronged, with a special operations team and an investigations team. Although special o9ps proved fruitless, investigations was able to identify and obtain warrants for two suspects, including T.C.\n\n[Submitted by Ryan Peabody, Acting Chief Ranger]\n\nTuesday, October 12, 2004\n\nHarpers Ferry National Historical Park (WV)\n\nRescue of River Rafters\n\nRangers assisted in the rescue of river rafters in the Shenandoah River adjacent to the park on September 30th. A commercial raft flipped over in high water, throwing the passengers into the river, which was near flood stage.\n\nIn order to reach them, them the rangers had to descend a 100-foot embankment. They found one person in full cardiac arrest and a second having difficulty breathing.\n\nThey provided CPR to the former until advanced life support medics arrived on scene, but he did not survive. The person with breathing difficulties was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. Both were raised by ropes from the river to the nearby road.[Submitted by Jennifer Flynn, Chief Ranger]\n\nWednesday, August 10, 2005\n\nHarpers Ferry NHP\n\nThree Rangers Injured In Head-on Collision\n\nThree Harpers Ferry rangers - Mark Howard, Kimberly Morris-Ropp and Jeremy Murphy - were en route to federal magistrate's court in Martinsburg, West Virginia, on the morning of August 9th when a Mercury Sable traveling in the opposite lane crossed over the center line and struck their Ford Crown Victoria head on. Despite the damage caused to the vehicle, the rangers were spared serious injuries because all were wearing seatbelts and because both front seat air bags deployed. The rangers were unable to open any of the Ford's doors, but were able to kick out a window and get out of the car. A fire was detected in what was left of the engine compartment. As local EMS and fire arrived on scene, the rangers were in the process of attempting to aid the driver of the Mercury, who was also spared from serious injury. Ambulances transported all four to City Hospital in Martinsburg, where they were treated and released. The rangers are reported doing well but \"feeling pretty beat up.\" They will be on leave for a few days. Says chief ranger Jennifer Flynn: \"We are feeling very lucky based on the condition of the vehicle that their injuries were not more severe. They were driving a 2005 Ford Crown Victoria that was about two months old.\" The accident investigation is being conducted by the Berkeley County Sheriff's Department. Ranger Josh Cunningham of C&O Canal is investigating for the NPS.

Two suspects were seen fleeing on an ATV. One of the rangers pursued them on foot up a fire road, then followed the ATV's tire tracks in the snow until catching up with the pair. The two men, who had a rifle in their possession, each admitted to shooting one of the deer. On April 11th, they both pled guilty to poaching and weapons violations in federal district court in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Each was fined $500 and required to pay the park $200 in restitution. The rifle was confiscated.

West Virginia, were notified of an injured person at the base of Loudoun Heights (part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park) on the shoulder of Highway 340. Initial reports were confused about whether the victim had been struck by a car or if he had fallen off the mountainside. Rangers assisted in the treatment and packaging of the patient, who had suffered a significant head injury, facial trauma and multiple abrasions and avulsions on his legs and torso. The rangers were able to quickly determine that the victim had fallen and could trace his fall line through the brush and debris on the hillside. A ranger found his wallet in his pants and suicide notes to his wife and parents. The information was passed on to the medics. The park is an area of concurrent jurisdiction and rangers investigated the incident with Loudoun County Sheriff's Department officers. A ranger ascended the area adjacent to the fall line and documented the fall. He was also able to collect additional personal effects that the man had left at the site that he jumped from. The fall was approximately 200 feet down a steep wooded slope covered with rocks and brush.

Ranger Robert Baker backed up Morrison and the two men were taken into custody. One was identified as R.L.L., 23, a convicted felon; the other was a juvenile. At the time, R.L.L was wearing an NPS fleece jacket with an arrowhead patch on the left sleeve. Investigators determined that the jacket had been stolen from a park maintenance worker two months earlier at the same location (it had been hung on a fence while the employee worked). The juvenile reported that R.L.L intended to impersonate a protection ranger and confiscate weapons from other poachers that they might contact that morning. On January 18th, Morrison and an ATF special agent testified before a federal grand jury in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The grand jury indicted R.L.L on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of impersonating an officer. On March 27th, R.L.L entered into a plea agreement with the government and pled guilty to the first charge. On June 20th, R.L.L was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison with no possibility of early release.

She requested assistance from C&O Canal rangers and Jefferson County officers, then headed for Keyes Gap, where she contacted a highly intoxicated man later identified as J.J. J.J. was unable to identify himself, saying \"I'm a little out of it right now,\" then began to flee toward the Appalachian Trail with a twelve-pack of beer in his possession. Reynolds was able to catch J.J. and took him to the ground. A struggle ensued and Reynolds attempted to employ her taser on J.J.. The darts failed to penetrate his heavy coat, though, and he again fled with the beer. Reynolds again used her taser, this time stopping him. J.J. was charged with public intoxication and resisting arrest. The sheriff's department will be handling the case. It was later learned that a local landowner had been firing his personal semi-automatic weapon on private property next to the trail.

Over the next few days, rangers periodically checked the vehicle, finally impounding it on December 21st for violation of the closure restriction. An inventory was performed on the Buick and several items were discovered in the trunk that lead the rangers to believe the owner of the vehicle - M.W., 76, of Silver Springs, Maryland - might still be in the area. As temperatures had been well below freezing for several days, the rangers performed a quick hasty search of the riverbank. The following morning, rangers, together with NPS special agent Tim Alley, began an investigation into M.W.'s disappearance. An expanded search of the area, including river banks along the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers and hiking trails and shelters along the Appalachian Trail, was undertaken with the help of a number of park maintenance employees, C&O Canal rangers, and Maryland DNR officers. At approximately 11:40 a.m., ranger Eric Sheetz discovered a body in the water on the east bank of the Shenandoah River, approximately 100 yards north of the Shenandoah River Bridge. The body was positively identified as M.W.'s. The cause of death is currently undetermined.

The bridge connects West Virginia to Maryland as part of the Appalachian Trail. Questions remain about funding for repairs and the soundness of the railway bridge trusses. Discussions are continuing regarding the possibility of providing shuttle service for those who wish to access the C&O Canal or Maryland Heights from Harpers Ferry.

The park is coordinating restoration efforts with CSX, which will cover the cost for the repairs. The trail closure affects thousands of visitors and hikers on the AT. The closure has created problems for hikers who have had to rely on private shuttle services to get across, a problem that will worsen as the weather warms up and the number of through hikers increases significantly. The National Park Service and CSX are planning to provide a shuttle service that would transport hikers and visitors around the footbridge closure until repairs can be completed.

Thus far, positive samplings by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Pennsylvania State University researchers have been found at Catoctin Mountain Park, Rock Creek Park, Monocacy National Battlefield, and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The NPS expects they'll see similar results at Antietam National Battlefield and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the risk of getting COVID-19 from animals in the U.S., including wildlife, is low. The NPS donates all suitable meat from its deer management operations to local food banks, and though there is no evidence that humans can get COVID-19 through handling or eating game meat, the NPS has contacted local food banks to discuss their venison donations.

The hiker was able to contact emergency response, who were able to see the individual's headlamp and speak to them via cellphone, but could not reach their location due to the steep, densely-wooded terrain. Maryland State Police Aviation Command's helicopter was called and was able to lower a rescue technician to the individual. They then lifted the hiker and dog into the aircraft and flew them to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Advanced Training Facility. An ambulance crew evaluated the individual and helped arrange a pick-up.

The wafers were placed \"mostly around the vehicles' driver's side doors\" so that people would have to step on them to enter their vehicles. In the Catholic Church, communion wafers are considered \"consecrated hosts,\" so stepping on them would be tantamount to sin. Church officials buried the wafers, following Catholic practices, even though they suspected that the wafers were not consecrated. Church officials expressed concern that it might be a hate crime meant to instill fear. The NPS is investigating the incident.
