We serve as the central hub for strategic planning, administration, and communication between various stakeholders, including faculty, staff, students, alumni, and external entities. As the head of Mary Baldwin, President Jeff Stein is responsible for guiding the institution toward its mission, vision, and goals.\n\nThe President works closely with other senior administrators, deans, and department heads to establish academic priorities, develop institutional policies, and make crucial decisions that impact the university’s growth and development. This involves overseeing strategic planning initiatives, ensuring adherence to academic standards, and promoting innovation in teaching, research, and community engagement."
