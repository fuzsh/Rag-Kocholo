        "text": "Lt. Col. Mary Stewart Atwell came to VMI in 2015. Previously, she taught at Cal Poly State University and Missouri State University. She received her B.A. from Hollins University, her M.A. from the University of Virginia, and her M.F.A. and Ph.D. from Washington University in St. Louis. Lt. Col. Atwell teaches courses in British literature and creative writing, specializing in fiction. She serves as the Institute Pre-Law Advisor and the Alumni Network Coordinator in the Department of English, Rhetoric, and Humanistic Studies.\n\nLt. Col. Atwell is the author of the novels The Good Ones (forthcoming from Harper Books) and Wild Girls (Scribner). Her short fiction has appeared in Epoch and Alaska Quarterly Review, among other journals, and in the anthologies Best New American Voices and Best American Mystery Stories. Her articles and essays have appeared in The New York Times, Poets & Writers, and The Writer's Chronicle, and in the anthology Paperback Writer: Literary Advice into the Twenty-First Century (Palgrave).\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nEnglish, Rhetoric, and Humanistic Studies\n\nMaj. Adam Cody studies and teaches rhetoric as the art of effective communication. He earned a doctorate in Communication Arts and Sciences from The Pennsylvania State University in 2020 and joined the Virginia Military Institute’s academic faculty later that same year.\n\nIn his capacity as Assistant Professor of Rhetoric, Composition, and Oral Communication, it has been Maj. Cody’s pleasure to teach ERH 103: Fundamentals of Public Speaking, ERH 201: Rhetorical Traditions I (covering the ancient, medieval, and Renaissance periods), ERH 202: Rhetorical Traditions II (covering the modern and post-modern periods), ERH 301: Rhetoric and Public Address, and ERH 302: Civic Discourse. Students in Maj. Cody’s classes may expect to encounter practical exercises and open discussions designed to hone their abilities with the transferable skills of communication.\n\nAs a scholar, Maj. Cody is a historian of arguments and narratives relating to topics of democracy, citizenship, and empire, with a particular focus on the Greco-Roman rhetorical tradition. His most recent publication, “Dialectics, Post-Dialectics, and the Democratic Argument of Lysias XII,” was published in December 2022 by Argumentation and Advocacy. This essay argues that post-dialectical persuasive forces, such as fascistic argument, can be explained in dialectical terms as practices of strategic maneuvering. The essay goes on to identify the concept of “democratic argument,” a type of post-dialectical persuasion that seeks to control the terms of discourse by negating disinterested choice. Ongoing and future projects focus on the forensic speeches of 5th-century BCE Attic orator Antiphon of Rhamnus and on the 4th-century BCE textbook Rhetorica ad Alexandrum.\n\nMaj. Cody also supports the Writing Center as the Oral and Digital Communication Specialist. He encourages any cadets who are interested in or would like help with public speaking to arrange a meeting with him.\n\nAssistant Professor English, Rhetoric, and Humanistic Studies\n\nAnnick Dupal has been teaching part-time at VMI since fall 2017; she also teaches at James Madison University.

She teaches Writing and Rhetoric I & II.\n\nCurrently a candidate for the Ph.D. in Education, Curriculum, and Instruction with a concentration in Integrative STEM Education (I-STEM Ed.) at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Smith explores best practices for integrating STEM and the humanistic studies, such as American literature, creative writing, and rhetoric to support hands-on design thinking in the design-based technology and engineering classroom. Her current research involves impacts for critical reflective writing on design-based learning.\n\nSmith is also a creative writer. Her poems have recently appeared in Poetry X Hunger, The Timberline Review, Phi Kappa Phi Forum Magazine, and several of her poems have been anthologized in publications, such as Tupelo Press’s 30/30 Anthology.\n\nAs a screenwriter, Smith shares several awards with husband and VMI peer, Douglas N. Smith. Their documentary film, Between Two Fires garnered a CINE Eagle and Best Documentary of the Show in the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences also awarded Between Two Fires a Bronze Oscar for excellence in graduate student filmmaking. This film is currently distributed by International Historic Films. Additionally, their screenplay “Once to Every Man” was an honorable mention in Virginia Governor’s Screenplay Competition.\n\nSmith’s creative writing often explores the influence of science and technology on the poetic imagination, especially figurative language. Intrigued by dynamical systems and emergent complexity, she and her husband have been writing about unforeseen, chaotic impacts natural events have unleashed throughout the history of mankind. Their recent collaboration has engendered a completed screenplay for a major film project, “Eagle in the Snow,” adapted from the novel Eagle in the Snow, written by Wallace Breem. This story is set on the Rhine River, New Year’s Eve, 406 A.D., when the river froze, and five barbarian tribes crossed, catalyzing the fall of Rome. Most recently, this project was accepted for distribution in four twenty-two page volumes on comiXology.com, and she is hopeful for future, multi-platform success.\n\nAn avid hiker, Smith enjoys hiking with her ten children and a gathering host of significant others!\n\nCol. Pennie Ticen has been a member of the English faculty at VMI since the fall of 2003. She earned her graduate degrees from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where she focused on modern and contemporary British Literature, writing her dissertation on post-colonial epics. One of her focus areas is in South-Asian Indian literature, especially the novels of Salman Rushdie, various retellings of the Indian epic The Ramayana, and the essays of Arundhati Roy. She has been an active member of the South Asian Literary Association for 25 years, where she has presented papers, co-chaired conferences, served as treasurer and been a member of the executive committee.\n\nCol. Ticen regularly teaches courses in Writing and Rhetoric, British Literary Traditions, Literature of Indian Independence, and Empire Writing, as well as seminars on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Salman Rushdie. She also teaches Fieldwork courses, with recent sections focusing on Cadet Life at VMI and Women and African-Americans at VMI. She enjoys working closely with cadets and has shepherded them through SURI projects, conference presentations, department honors theses, capstone projects, and independent studies on a variety of topics.\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nEnglish, Rhetoric, and Humanistic Studies\n\nSample of Lt.

Henry Wise taught for several years in Taiwan, where he worked for the ROC Military Academy in Fengshan, selecting, instructing, and training cadets who would go on to study in American military institutions, including VMI. In 2015, he earned his MFA in poetry from the University of Mississippi, where he continued to teach creative writing and composition until he joined VMI’s English faculty in 2017. At VMI, he teaches American literature and creative writing and serves as faculty adviser to Cadence (formerly The Sounding Brass), VMI’s annual fine arts journal, which he edited as a cadet. He has taught a variety of courses, among which are those of his own design on the subjects of Frontier American Literature and the works of Nobel Prize-winning author William Faulkner. Maj. Wise has advised several independent cadet projects on topics as varied as environmental anxiety in Cormac McCarthy’s novels, Mark Twain’s challenging of romanticism in Roughing It, and reconciling Ralph Waldo Emerson’s surprising involvement in the Abolitionist movement with his skepticism of society in “Self-Reliance.” A writer across multiple genres, his poetry has been published in Shenandoah, Radar Poetry, Clackamas, Eunoia Review, and elsewhere; his nonfiction can be found in Southern Cultures. His debut novel, Holy City, will be published by Grove Atlantic in 2024.\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nEnglish, Rhetoric, and Humanistic Studies"
