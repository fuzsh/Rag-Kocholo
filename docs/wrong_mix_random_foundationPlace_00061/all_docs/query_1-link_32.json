        "text": "Research/ Does it Make Sense?\n\nBusinesses in Staunton enjoy the low cost advantages associated with operating outside of a Major Metro, but these same circumstances should cause you to think differently about the viability of your product or service. Consumer behaviors outside of major metropolitan areas are vastly different from your D.C., or Richmond markets. Understanding the trends and prevalence associated with your targeted demographic will help you determine sales projections, growth plans and saturation points over the first three to five years of your business.\n\nPut It On Paper\n\nCreate Your Business Plan\n\nThe completed business plan is a key document to starting your business. Start with these three exercises then click on Learn More for the next steps and where to find help.\n\nWhat kind of space do you need? Office? Manufacturing? Does it need to be accessible for customers and walk-in traffic? What type of zoning does your business require? Will you be home-based?\n\nLearn More\n\nTry not to be too literal or too abstract, there’s a balance out there that will match your brand. Think about the life of your business and whether or not your name is flexible with the growth of your business. Be sure to check availability with the State Corporation Commission.\n\nlearn more\n\nThe best legal structure varies for each owner and each business, but it is wise to consult with an attorney, an accountant, and/or business advisor. Consider the type of business, your business and personal goals, and your personal finances when making this decision.\n\nYour business goals are constantly changing, and so should your plan. When things change, update your plan. Changes in customers, employees, location and funding affect your long-term planning process and strategy. Keep in mind, a plan is a strategy for the future, not for the present. Your business plan should be looking months/years down the road, and your actions today should reflect that approach.\n\nlearn more"
