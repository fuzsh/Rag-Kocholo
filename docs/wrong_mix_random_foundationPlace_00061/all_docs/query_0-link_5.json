He argues that its formation is the true continuation of democratic traditions begun in the Revolution and recently subverted by the North. Davis also describes the functions of some of the Confederate offices and the services they will perform.\n\nEncourages all voters to vote in the upcoming election. Voters are encouraged to vote for the Ordinance of Secession as well as the amendment equalizing taxation.\n\nReports that reinforcements are arriving at Harper's Ferry to protect the town from Federal assault. Article describes blacks at work on defenses as \"cheerful in the performance of their duties.\"\n\nReports that several of the military companies stationed in Staunton were on parade last Saturday. The display was witnessed by five hundred spectators composed \"chiefly of the ladies of this place.\"\n\nReports that a resolution was passed at a meeting in Wheeling condemning the Ordinance of Secession and providing for a Convention of delegates from counties favoring division of the State.\n\nGov. Hicks of Maryland has called four regiments to Union service on the written assurance of the Secretary of War that they will not be used outside of Maryland or Washington city.\n\nA load of freight bound for Staunton from the North via Washington had been broken open by troops and much of it was detained in Washington. Further shipments will not be permitted to come further South than Washington.\n\nVirginia denies the Republican charge of guilt for the war and insists that the state did everything in its power to find a peaceful solution to difficulties. Virginia now takes up arms in self-defense and has yet to assume the role of aggressor.\n\nThe writer is a former Unionist who came to the banner of secession only after Lincoln's call for troops. The writer encourages all to vote for the Ordinance of Secession."
