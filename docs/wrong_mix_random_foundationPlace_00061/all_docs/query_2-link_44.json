        "text": "General Edward Braddock\n\nAmong the earliest records we have for travel over this general route come from the march of Gen. Edward Braddock’s British expeditionary force, which was sent to clear the French out of the Ohio country in the spring of 1755.3 On May 2, 1755, Sir Peter Halkett’s 44th Regiment crossed the Blue Ridge at Vestal’s [Keys] Gap, about six miles south of present-day Harpers Ferry. Halkett’s troops marched through Charlestown [Charles Town, W.Va.], proceeded southwest through Smithfield [Middleway, W.Va.], then turned south to Abril’s Ford on Opequon Creek. On May 4, Halkett’s troops forded Opequon Creek and rested at Littler’s Tavern [Brucetown, Va.].\n\nAt Littler’s Tavern, Halkett’s 44th Regiment was joined by Col. Thomas Dunbar’s 48th Regiment, which had forded the Potomac River at Williams Ferry [Williamsport, Md.] and proceeded south along the “Waggon Road” [Valley Turnpike or U.S. Route 11]. Gen. Edward Braddock, accompanied by 23-year-old George Washington, forded the Potomac River at Swearingen’s Ferry [Shepherdstown, W.Va.] and joined the 44th and 48th Regiments at this same place.\n\nFrom Littler’s Tavern, the 44th and 48th Regiments marched west through Cedar Grove, across Babbs Run, and over Hunting Ridge to present-day Gainesboro, Va., hauling with them 29 pieces of artillery, 407 wagons, 400 pack horses, and a herd of livestock. This route, which appears on an 1863 map prepared by the U.S. Army, passed about six miles north of Winchester, Va.4\n\nBraddock’s force continued west through Cross Junction, camped near present-day Whiteacre, crossed Big Timber Ridge, and bivouacked on land owned by Henry Enoch and surveyed in 1750 by George Washington [Forks of Cacapon, W.Va.]. In what was described as the most difficult stretch of the entire march to the Ohio River, Braddock’s army crossed Spring Gap Mountain near present-day Slanesville, W.Va. Dunbar’s 48th Regiment reached Wills Creek [Cumberland, Md.] on May 10, 1755. Halkett’s 44th Regiment arrived there on May 16.\n\n“Braddock’s Road” and its subsequent incarnations as the Cumberland Road or National Road [U.S. Route 40] has been well-documented between Cumberland, Md., and the Monongahela and Ohio rivers in western Pennsylvania. On May 30, 1755, Braddock dispatched 600 men under the command of Maj. Russel Chapman to clear a road 12 feet wide west from Fort Cumberland. This road closely followed the Nemacolin Indian trail, which had been blazed by the Ohio Company in 1753.5\n\nBraddock’s Road passed through the present-day towns of Frostburg, Md., Grantsville, Md., Addison, Pa., Somerfield, Pa., and Farmington, Pa., before veering away from Nemacolin’s trail. The road continued north through Connellsville to McKeesport, Pa. on the Monongahela River, just south of Fort Duquesne [Pittsburgh, Pa.]. It was near here, in a place subsequently named Braddock’s Field, that Gen. Edward Braddock was defeated and mortally wounded by the French and their Indian allies on July 9, 1755.\n\nFrench and Indian War\n\nThe defeat of Gen. Braddock and retreat of the British expeditionary force from western Pennsylvania threw the western Virginia frontier into turmoil. On August 14, 1755, Virginia governor Robert Dinwiddie appointed George Washington Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of the Virginia forces. Washington made Winchester, Va. his headquarters, and the roads and trails west of Winchester became essential conduits for moving men, supplies, and couriers to and from the western Virginia frontier.\n\nOne of Washington’s first acts was to order a stockade and fort built on the east side of Patterson’s Creek about 14 miles south of Fort Cumberland [Cumberland, Md.]. Fort Ashby, as this outpost became known, served to protect the main line of supply between Winchester and Fort Cumberland.6 A smaller fort, called Fort Capon or Enoch’s, was erected along this same supply route at the forks of the Cacapon River [Forks of Cacapon, W.Va.]. Traffic along this wagon road reached a peak during the last half of 1758 as the British campaign to capture Fort Duquesne proceeded across western Pennsylvania and began to draw supplies from western Virginia.\n\nWhen the hostilities of the French and Indian War came to a close in 1764, Fort Ashby was probably abandoned. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, however, the site remained a bustling transportation link on the wagon road from Winchester to the Ohio River, and on December 5, 1787, the town of Frankfort was founded on the site of Fort Ashby. A local historian later wrote:\n\nBefore the completion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad [in 1854] Frankfort was on the direct route from Winchester to Wheeling over which hundreds of tons of merchandise passed monthly. It was the long wagon trains passing over this route that furnished business for two hotels in Frankfort. Many times has the Public Square been crowded over night with canvas covered wagons loaded with valuable merchandise.7\n\nFrankfort was subsequently renamed Alaska, and is now incorporated as Fort Ashby, W.Va.\n\nWhiskey Insurrection\n\nThe importance of the wagon road from Winchester, Va., west to the Monongahela River was again documented during the Whiskey Insurrection of 1794. On Saturday, October 4, 1794, the “infantry and light Corps” of the Virginia militia departed Winchester to support the militias of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey in suppressing the Whiskey Insurrection in western Pennsylvania.8 Among the Virginia militiamen was Meriwether Lewis, who mustered in as a private in T. Walker’s volunteer corps. Lewis and his fellow Virginians assembled at Winchester, and on October 4, 1794, he wrote his mother from their camp.9\n\nDr. Robert Wellford and the Volunteer Troop of Fredericksburg Cavalry followed the infantry, departing Winchester on the morning of October 6. Wellford documented the march in his diary:\n\nOctober 6: “Rinkers, 9 miles” [Gainesboro, Va.]10\n\nOctober 7: “a little beyond Copsyes,” at the “Black horse of John Coxey”, “17 miles” [Forks of Cacapon, W.Va.]11; “Crocks, 5 miles further” [unknown, but possibly “Cross Roads” or Slanesville, W.Va.]\n\nOctober 8: “Springfield, 17 miles from Crock’s” [Springfield, W.Va.]\n\nOctober 9: “Frankfort, 7 miles, where we had a most comfortable breakfast at McMeekins Tavern” [Fort Ashby, W.Va.]; “Fort Cumberland, 14 miles, making a journey of Sixty nine miles from Winchester.” [Cumberland, Md.]12\n\nThe main body of Virginia militia camped and rested for several days at Frankfort. On October 17-18, 1794, Gen. George Washington, who had accompanied the Maryland militia to Fort Cumberland, wrote:\n\nUnderstood that about 500 more were at a little Village on the Virginia side, 11 Miles distant, called Frankfort, under the command of Majr. Genl. Morgan; that 700 more had arrived at that place the evening of the 18th. undr. Brigr. Mathews and 500 more were expected in the course of a few days under Colo. Page and That the whole were well supplied with Provns., Forage & Straw.13\n\nMeriwether Lewis undoubtedly camped with the rest of the Virginia militia at Frankfort. On Thursday, October 23, 1794, the Maryland and Virginia militia forces finally moved west from Fort Cumberland, following closely the route of Braddock’s Road. Dr. Robert Wellford documented the route:\n\nOctober 23: “Fort Cumberland to Strickers, 11 miles”\n\nOctober 24: “to Tomlinson’s, at the little Meadows, 11 miles” [east of Grantsville, Md.]14\n\nOctober 26: “the Infantry & artillery proceeded to Simkins’s, & the Cavalry as far as Mountains & Augustines. The distance from Tomlinson’s at the little Meadows to the little crossings of Youghogany River, 3 miles, from the little crossings to Simkins, where the Commander in Chief made his Head Quarters, 8 miles, & from thence to Mountain’s hovel & Augustine’s hog stye, making a progress of 18 miles this day.” [vicinity of Negro Mountain]\n\nOctober 28: “Left this detestable part of America, & proceeded to the great crossings of the Youghogany (three miles).” [Somerfield, Pa.]. “Soon after landing, the Army proceeded about Clark’s five miles, but Major [George] Lewis & myself went on to Bells, 12 miles.” [Farmington, Pa.]\n\nOctober 30: “At noon this day passed over the Laurel hill.” Viewed “a small Town called Beesom Town alias Union Town. Into this Town, 12 miles from Bells, we entered about dining time.” [Uniontown, Pa.]15\n\nOrders issued by commander-in-chief Major General Henry Lee at Union Town on November 2, 1794, provide considerable detail on the disposition on the militia regiments in western Pennsylvania on the following days:\n\n“The army will resume its march on the morning of the 4th, at the hour of eight, when a signal gun will be fired. They will advance in two columns composed of the respective wings. The right column will take the route by Lodge’s to Budd’s ferry, [24 miles north of Uniontown on the Youghiogeny River, south of present-day West Newton, Pa.] under the command of his excellency [Pennsylvania] governor [Thomas] Mifflin, who will please take the most convenient situation in the vicinity of that place for the accommodation of the troops, and wait further orders. The left column will proceed on the route to Peterson’s, on the east side of Parkinson’s ferry [Monongahela, Pa.], under the orders of major general [Daniel] Morgan; they will march by the left in the following manner:—Light corps, cavalry, artillery, Virginia brigade, Maryland brigade, the baggage to follow each corps, and the public stores of every kind, in the rear of the Virginia brigade. On the first day, the light corps and artillery will march to Washington Bottom [Perryopolis, Pa.], fourteen miles; the Virginia brigade to Peterson’s farm, twelve miles; the cavalry under major Lewis, will move with the commander-in-chief—the bullocks to precede the army at daylight. On the second day the column will proceed to the camp directed to be marked out between Parkinson’s and Budd’s ferries.”16\n\nDr. Robert Wellford’s journal documents the movements of the Volunteer Troop of Fredericksburg Cavalry over the next several days:\n\nNovember 5: “The Commander in Chief left this dirty place [Uniontown, Pa.] for Brownsville (alias Red-Stone), & all the troops marched out of Town.” [Brownsville, Pa., is situated on the Monongahela River]. Dr. Wellford stayed at “Jacksons Mill” one mile north of town.17\n\nNovember 7: “Left this place [Brownsville, Pa.] with an intention of going to Head Qr’s, & from thence to the other Column of the Army, about 12 miles from Jacksons; found the Commander in Chief at Powers Farm, & slept there. The land in this County Fayette is generally good, with a number of fine farms particularly in the Forks of Yough.”18\n\nNovember 10: “The remainder of the Army proceeded to cross the Monongohalia River for Washington County & Alleghany County. Mercer, Glassell & myself crossed at Parkinsons Ferry.” [Monongahela. Pa.]19\n\nNovember 10 was the last entry in Dr. Wellford’s diary until Saturday, November 22, 1794, when his party commenced upon their return trip to Virginia. Subsequent entries in his diary indicate that Wellford had visited Pittsburgh, but he provided no details on his travel routes.\n\nA close inspection of “A Map Of The State Of Pennsylvania by Reading Howell, 1792” shows a route extending northward from Brownsville along the east side of the Monongahela River through “Cook’s” to “Peterson’s” [through Rostraver Township, Pa.]. Roads from “Peterson’s” connected with “Parkinson’s” [Monongahela, Pa.], “Elizabeth T.” [Elizabeth, Pa.], and “M Kees” [McKeesport, Pa.]. The northern portion of this route— from “Cook’s” to “Elizabeth T.”—closely follows the present-day path of Pa. Route 51.20\n\nAn 1803 travel account by Thaddeus Mason Harris also describes a primary northsouth road across this area, passing from Elizabethtown to Pittsburgh along the present-day path of Pa. Route 51.21 Howell’s map shows this same route, passing north from “Elizabeth T.” and terminating immediately south of “Pittsburg” at the confluence of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.
