Harpers Ferry and Marlinton are the first two communities in WV to receive this award. A water utility earns the designation as a Source Water Community if they take an active role in protecting the waters that serve as their drinking water source. To receive the designation of a Source Water Community, a water utility must partner with the community on source water protection projects and issue a Proclamation celebrating Drinking Water Week during the first week of May.
