This petition was unsuccessful, and another petition was submitted the following year and according to 1979 history was granted, although no implementing law has been found as was the case in other communities such as Charles Town, Petersburg and Fincastle. In any event, no money was raised by the lottery and the matter was studied for the next three decades.\n\nThe Western Lunatic Asylum opened in Staunton in 1828, and in 1833 and 1838 the state appropriated funds for construction of water works. The town of Staunton had been looking into their own options, and the town and asylum agreed to build a common system although this was not successful due to an insufficient water supply and disagreements between the two parties.. The town built their own works that began service in July, 1843, and in 1849 the two entities built a new system.\n\nThis was replaced by a new system in 1876 that used earthen pipes to collect water from springs into a basin, where a Worthington steam engine pumped it into an elevated reservoir and distributed through cast-iron pipes.\n\nWater service is provided by the City of Staunton.\n\nReferences\n\n1806 Petition from inhabitants of Staunton asking for authority to hold lottery to raise $30,000 to aid Staunton Academy and for town improvements, including permission to \"to convey in pipes water from a neighboring spring to different parts of the town.\" December 8, 1806.

Western Lunatic Asylum and the town united to bring water from Kinneys Springs (on Middlebrook Avenue) in iron pipes, but the quality was inadequate for both places. In 1848, Staunton piped water from Buttermilk Spring. This spring is on the road by the same name which is an extension of Straith Street. This spring is also formerly known as Stoney Spring. Later Staunton began piping its water from the springs in Gypsy Hill Park, then known as Spring Farm, when owned by Peter Hanger. from The Mirror of Staunton, March 25, 1966, Page 4.\n\n1979 \"Not for 'Barter and Speculation': A Comparative Study of Antebellum Virginia Urban Water Supply,\" by Thomas F.

Waddell\n\nPage 436: The subject of supplying the town of Staunton with water, by means of iron pipes leading from a spring in the country, was introduced in the town council as early as 1833, but nothing was accomplished till 1839. The Legislature in that year passed an act for supplying the Western Lunatic Asylum with water, and the town united with the asylum in bringing water from Kinney's Spring. The county contributed one thousand dollars to the cost. The quantity of water furnished, however, proving inadequate to supply both town and asylum, the former, in 1848, piped the \"Buttermilk Spring.\" Dwellings soon sprang up on the hills surrounding the town. The contract for the present extensive city water works was awarded July 27, 1875.\n\n© 2015 Morris A. Pierce"
