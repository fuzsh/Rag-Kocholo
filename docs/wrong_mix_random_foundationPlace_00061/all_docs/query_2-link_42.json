        "text": "West Virginia 2024 PRIMARY Voter Guide\n\nPrimary Election Day is May 14. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWhile the top of every primary ballot will be the candidates running for U.S. President, by the time West Virginians go to the polls that race has already been decided: incumbent Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee, and former President Donald Trump got the Republican nod.\n\nBut there are lots of other races that West Virginians will have a chance to decide, including who will be on the November ballot for U.S. Senate, two U.S. House seats and every statewide office from governor to auditor to agricultural commissioner.\n\nPlus, there are the city and county races: for sheriffs, county commissioners, mayors, assessors and the like.\n\nAnd in every county there are a number of nonpartisan races — for positions like circuit court, family court and magistrate judges, as well as board of education and conservation supervisor seats. Because these races are nonpartisan, they’ll be decided in the primary, and this will be West Virginians’ only chance to choose these candidates this year.\n\nWho can vote?\n\nTo register to vote in West Virginia, you must:\n\nbe a citizen of the United States\n\nlive in West Virginia at the address on your application\n\nbe 18 years old on the day of the election.\n\nnot be serving a sentence (including probation or parole) for a felony, treason or election bribery (people convicted of misdemeanors are eligible to vote).\n\nnot have been judged “mentally incompetent” in a court of law.\n\nHow do you check if you’re registered?\n\nYou can search for your voter registration information on the Secretary of State’s website by entering your name and date of birth.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote in the primary was April 23, 2024. You can register online, by mail or in person. You will need a valid ID in order to vote; here’s a list of acceptable IDs. Note that first-time voters may be asked to provide additional identification with their current name and address.\n\nHow do you find your polling place?\n\nWhat are the key dates?\n\nDeadline to register: April 23, 2024.\n\nEarly voting starts May 1 and goes through May 11. Here’s a list of early voting locations and times.\n\nPrimary Election Day: Tuesday, May 14, 2024.\n\nCan you mail in a ballot?\n\nYes, but unlike in recent elections, you have to meet certain requirements before you’re allowed to vote absentee in West Virginia. Eligibility requires two basic criteria: (1) confinement or not being present in the county during in-person voting, and (2) a permitted reason/excuse.\n\nRead more on the Secretary of State’s website.\n\nIf you plan to vote absentee, you must request an absentee ballot by May 8. It must be postmarked by Primary Election Day (May 14) or hand-delivered to your local County Clerk’s office by the day before Primary Election Day (May 13).\n\nThis is a primary election. Here’s what that means.\n\nBecause this is a primary election, voters will see a different ballot depending on their party registration. For example, if you’re registered as a Democrat, you will just be able to vote in races where there is at least one Democratic candidate, as well as nonpartisan races. If you’re registered as an Independent, you will be able to ask for a ballot of any party.\n\nWhat races are on every ballot?\n\nBecause this is a primary election, the candidates you see on your ballot will vary depending on your registered political party. (If you’re a registered independent, you can request the ballot for any party.) But in every county there are nonpartisan races that will be on every ballot. Unlike the partisan races, these seats will be decided during the primary, meaning this is your only chance to weigh in on candidates.\n\nJudicial positions\n\nWest Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals\n\nFive justices are elected to West Virginia’s highest court for 12-year terms. Every year, the court convenes twice for several months to hear appeals of Intermediate Court decisions, as well as appeals from circuit court in criminal cases, juvenile proceedings, and child abuse and neglect matters. They can also be asked to help interpret state and national constitutions and laws, as they were recently asked to do in the Huntington/Cabell County case against opioid distributors.\n\nTo be eligible for the court, candidates must be at least 30 years old, have lived in West Virginia for at least five years, be a member in good standing with the West Virginia State Bar, and have been admitted to practice law for at least 10 years prior to the election. The annual salary for justices is $149,600.\n\nIn the 2024 primary, two candidates will be on the ballot, but because both are vying for seats in different divisions, they are running unopposed.\n\nSupreme Court of Appeals – Division 1\n\nSupreme Court of Appeals – Division 2\n\nWest Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals\n\nWest Virginia’s Intermediate Court of Appeals is new: it was created by the Legislature in 2021 and officially opened in 2022. These judges hear cases involving certain types of appeals, including those from circuit court civil cases, some family court decisions, state agencies and workers compensation cases.\n\nThe judges are elected to 10-year terms, and earn an annual salary of $142,500. To be eligible for the court, candidates must be at least 30 years old, have lived in West Virginia for at least five years, be a member in good standing with the West Virginia State Bar, and have been admitted to practice law for at least 10 years prior to the election.\n\nThe first three judges to serve on the court were appointed by Gov. Jim Justice in December 2021; of the three, Judge Thomas E. Scarr’s term expires at the end of this year and he is not running for reelection. Three candidates are vying to fill that vacant seat.\n\nPartisan races\n\nDemocratic ballot\n\nNational and statewide races\n\nU.S. President\n\nTo run for U.S. president a candidate must be at least 35 years old, have lived in the country for at least 14 years and be a natural born U.S. citizen. The president serves a four-year term, and is paid a salary of $400,000 a year.\n\nDemocratic voters in West Virginia will see the following five candidates on primary ballots, but as of March 12, incumbent Joe Biden officially secured enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nWest Virginia, like every state in the country, is represented by two U.S. senators. One is Republican Shelley Moore Capito, who isn’t up for reelection until 2026. But with the retirement of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, voters will choose a new senator for that six-year term this year.\n\nTo be eligible to run for the U.S. Senate, a candidate has to be at least 30 years old, have been a U.S. citizen for at least nine years and live in the state they seek to represent at the time of election. The annual salary for senators who don’t serve in the body’s leadership is $174,000 a year.\n\nThere are three Democrats competing for the party’s slot on the November ballot. They include Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott and Zachary Shrewsbury.
