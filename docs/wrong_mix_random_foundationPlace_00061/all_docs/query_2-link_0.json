It was founded in 1737 by a wealthy landowner. Colonel William Byrd II inherited land on both sides of the James River, where he began developing the city. Today, it is a bustling town, and as of 2020 has a population of about 230,000 people. The city is home to many historical landmarks. Each year, tourists come to visit Maymont, a lovely, 100-acre Victorian estate converted into a public park and museum. Visitors will also find the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. Today, the city acts as a hub for government, law, and finance.\n\nB.
