        "text": "Advertisements\n\nI've lived in Atlanta for over a decade. My wife and I are seriously considering moving to a smaller place, most likely in western North Carolina or Virginia. We like the mountainous regions because of the climate and the beauty of the terrain. We have a young child but we were \"late parents\" so we're comfortable with people in the 35-45 range, mostly. We've lived in several places around the country and generally seen it and done it all; we're not really into the hype of big cities anymore...tired of traffic and materialism and b.s. We are not snobby types who gush all over the so-called five-star restaurants and latest \"cultural attraction\" -- but we are educated, fairly open-minded people so we don't want to go to the other extreme and live in a backwards place, either.\n\nAnyway, I was contacted recently about a job in Staunton. (Fortunately, I'm in a profession where I have pretty decent job options, even in a relatively small city that probably doesn't have too many jobs). My wife thinks that I'm being silly for even thinking about Staunton -- she thinks it's one of those places where you risk raising your kids and then never seeing them again because they'll want to get out as fast as they can and not return -- I'm not so cynical. I'm tempted to at least visit and do a little research.\n\nBasically, we like the idea of a small city -- but we don't want to be in an area inhabited primarily by closed-minded people. We're not left-wing nutjobs -- don't get me wrong -- but I was scared by some other posts about Staunton that implied it is dominated by evangelicals and ultra-conservative old people. I'm also concerned that it's one of those places where if you aren't born and raised there, you will never be part of the community. (A long time ago, when I was in the military, we lived in a small town in the midwest -- about the same size as Staunton as a matter of fact -- and while people were superficially friendly, we could never be truly accepted and never had much luck making friends with locals).\n\nOn the other hand, Staunton looks like a town with some potential for a cool little downtown area, if there's any significant influx of newcomers. I also like the idea that it's close to Charlottesville and only a couple of hours drive to DC. And it is in the middle of a beautiful area.\n\nSo...am I nuts? What is it like to live there? Is there ANYTHING \"hip\" about Staunton? A coffee shop or two where some educated people hang out and discuss politics? (Or would that be more like a diner with a bunch of 70-year-olds talking about the weather?) Is Staunton a place that is developing and slowly become more \"artsy\" or progressive -- like a few of the small towns in Western North Carolina in the Asheville sphere of influence -- or is it more or less a \"dead\" town that won't ever change very much? I'm really just looking for some honest perspectives.\n\nFrom what you are saying, I think Charlottesville or even Harrisonburg might be a better option for you.\n\nI have to say that Staunton is not really a happening place for young people. They have Mary Baldwin College for women. But its not quite anything to do really. Its a nice college town and very laid back though.\n\nAnd most people pronounce it wrong. Its called STANT-ON\n\nHarrisonburg, just 25 minutes North- actually offers more in the way of things to do. It has a bit more night life and since JMU is a state school, it has a lot more to offer . More live music there too.\n\nCharlottesville is also fairly close to Staunton. So its not like there aren't nearby cities for fun.\n\nHere are some pics of Staunton. It really is a lovely town:\n\nDowntown Staunton, Virginia photo - Meade Skelton photos at pbase.com\n\nI have lived in Staunton for over ten years having moved from Pittsburgh. What I really like about it is that it is a safe place to raise a family with many non-material things to do such as hiking and going to Gypsy Hill Park. It has a surprising number of unique cultural opportunities for a town of its size (25k) including the American Shakespeare Center (ASC - Home) and the Frontier Culture Museum (FCMV Home). Although it does lean conservative I think it is becoming more progressive probably on account of the number of people that have moved there over the past decade. I have found that most people do move away from the area after high school or college but many of them return when they start having a family. While the area is certainly not a melting pot of diversity it does seem to be increasing gradually. I do wish there were more - or any - good ethnic restaurants (other than your typical Mexican and Chinese restaurants) but there is always Harrisonburg or Charlottesville if you want Thai, Indian, or something else. Also, DC is about 2.5 hours away.\n\nI grew up in Staunton and I am now 21 and living in Austin, TX.\n\nI have always said that Staunton is a good place to grow up and a good place to retire, but you don't \"live\" there -- which is why I wanted to get out to a bigger city before I got \"stuck\" in Staunton. It's a pretty good place to be a kid and grow up, though, and to raise a family -- but I think it's likely that your little one will want to get out of the town when the time comes.\n\nIf you want a slow-paced town that shuts down early on weekdays, and if you want a quaint and predictable storybook Shenandoah childhood for your kid, Stuaunton is the place.\n\nBUT, there isn't much to DO at all. Charlottesville is much better, and just a 35-minute drive away. Check out C-ville and drive to Staunton for a weekend. Once you've visited the three or four highlights of Staunton, return to Charlottesville where there is much more to do.\n\nThe Shenandoah Valley is gorgeous, and I do miss it since I've moved to TX. Staunton is a pretty town, but a town to visit on the weekend. You'll get bored there, I promise. Charlottesville is a much nicer place, and much less conservative.\n\nHope this helps!"
