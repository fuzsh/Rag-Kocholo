        "text": "Rail station in Staunton, Virginia, US\n\nStaunton station is an Amtrak train station in Staunton, Virginia, located in the downtown Wharf Area Historic District of the city. It is served by Amtrak's Cardinal, which runs between New York and Chicago. The station has restrooms and benches, but no ticket office.\n\nThe site of the station has been a railroad depot since 1854:\n\nThe present railroad station is the third one on this site. The first station was destroyed by [Union] General Hunter's troops in June of 1864. A runaway train at the turn-of-the-century [in 1890[2]] destroyed the second station.\n\nâ€” Staunton in the Civil War[3]\n\nThe third and existing station building was designed by Staunton architect Thomas Jasper Collins and built by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1902.[4]\n\nThe current station facility is the former telegraph tower from when the Staunton station functioned as a full passenger and freight railroad depot. While the platform still functions as the railroad platform for loading and unloading passengers, the former station passenger and freight buildings are now occupied by a reception hall for events, replacing a restaurant. Next to the station is a Chessie System caboose.[5][6]\n\nMedia related to Staunton station at Wikimedia Commons"
