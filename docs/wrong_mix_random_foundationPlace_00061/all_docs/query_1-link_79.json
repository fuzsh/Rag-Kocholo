        "text": "I had Dr. Whiting for the first time and the practice will be in excellent hands when Dr. McIntire retires in Sept. He was profesional yet had an engaging demeanor when interacting with me. What makes this practice exceptional is the support staff- the welcoming friendliness of the front desk and the business office personnel. In particular, I would like to give high praises to the dental technician, Faith. She is warm, engaging and puts you at ease. She educates you during the whole process and is extremely knowledgeable about the procedures. Without a doubt, this is the best dental practice in the Valley.\n\nDr. Mac performed a small miracle for me yesterday during my appointment. I was having an issue with my temporary bridge and he squeezed me in with his other patients to fix it. He went to great lengths to help me and I am very grateful. Thank you SFL!!\n\nI had every intention of shopping around before committing to the extensive dental work I needed. However, after visiting the practice and seeing how dedicated they were to making life changing improvement for their patients, I looked no further. It is a process, starting with evaluations, recommendations, x-rays and scheduling. Beginning with my first appointment I marveled at the kindness, care and professionalism I received. I was taken care of skillfully and gently as we began my transformation. Today, June 6, 2024, I left their office with a beautiful smile without discoloration, wear, and misaligned teeth, and I now have a corrected bite and completely restored teeth that I am proud to show. Dr. Geo is very caring and meticulous, striving to complete his work with skill and perfection. Iâ€™m so glad that I came to Smiles For Life.\n\nSmiles for Life has taken care of my dentistry needs for the last 6 years or so. Other offices in the past have had difficult times fitting me in when I needed an appointment. That hasnâ€™t been the case here. Today, I needed to reschedule my appointment for next Monday, and they had an opening today with Cathy Batton instead of my regular hygienist. Cathy does a great job with years of experience and has a way about her to make you feel comfortable.\n\nOn my first visit I meet Becky, we sat down and talked about everything they do there and she allowed me to tell her about my issues with my teeth and she felt that they could help me with my problem. This is the first time I have ever been able to explain, in detail, about my past and present experiences with my dental problems. She made me feel very comfortable in taking about my care and what I would like to have done with my denture issue's. I have set up my next appointment to have x-rays done and feel very good about that! I'm looking forward to my visit and what they have to say about fixing my problem ."
