        "text": "Released in 2009 from director Duncan Jones, Moon is a high concept and intelligent science fiction drama that dispels and sheds many of the more familiar conventions and ideas common to the genre and instead opts for a more grounded and realised depiction of life in the cosmos. It redefines the concept and idea of the One-Man film style in an intelligent and creative way, featuring an accomplished performance from actor Sam Rockwell and a notable supporting cast in a minor capacity that elevates and carries the production beyond its humble means. There are certain aesthetic touches and choices that draw comparison to other illumni in the genre, but it never feels subservient or ode to those classics, its an accomplished film and narrative in its own right and one that deserves wider acclaim and knowledge in wider culture than arguably it has achieved to date.\n\nFrom a personal bias, it had the weight of expectations upon it, a film I was aware of for a long time but never really having the means or opportunity to experience it. In recent weeks having gone back to watch its peers in the genre such as Solaris and Sunshine it felt apt to finally experience Moon and be able to form my own impressions of this intelligent production. It certainly fulfilled what I had come to expect, grand ideas and ambitions tempered with a restricted budget resulting in an accomplished presentation lacking some of the shine and sparkle of its American counterparts. This isn’t a critique or lament directed towards those productions, it’s clearly directed towards an audience that enjoys high concept ideas and formulations which of course relies entirely on its cast to deliver. Despite personal reservations of the actor, this is a strong and memorable performance from Rockwell that in turn carries Moon and makes it a recommended film of the genre.\n\nAs with any budget production you are immediately aware of its financial shortcomings or restrictions, visually and from an overall presentation standpoint it looks and feels like a high cost production, utilising practical and digital effect in equal measure to present a final product that certainly is equal to its peers in the genre irrespective of a smaller financial pool to draw from. There is perhaps some repetition or over use of its interior sets and location which eludes to a single set production but equally its befitting of the overall narrative and tone that it works so well. It adds to the sense of isolation and forlorn resignation to the circumstances that permeates the entire narrative. It lives up to the weight of expectation with its presentation but for a movie like this to succeed, it demands a narrative of equal measure, whether it delivers here is only to interpretation.\n\nPlot Synopsis\n\nSet in the near future on the surface of the Moon, Sam Bell, played by Rockwell, is the sole employee at a lunar mining facility providing a fuel source for the citizens of Earth below. In the opening moments of the film he is tasked with overseeing and ensuring the maintenance of the various autonomous machines that are harvesting the fuel source from the dark side of the moon, ensuring a continuity in service and delivery for the corporation on Earth. There is a clear loneliness and resignation to the circumstance on behalf of Bell who is working his contract before his return to his family below. His only consistent companion in the opening segment of the film is the robotic assistance Gerty with a voice credit for Kevin Spacey which has certain connotations to HAL in 2001 or Mother in the first Alien film, the detached AI presence that creates room for doubt to the observant audience. Sam is able to communicate through a delayed messaging system to his partner and child on Earth which was an interesting use of this mechanic as it reflects time displacement whereby instantaneous communication between points in space would be nearly impossible for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe familial connection between Sam and his wife Tess does present a different dynamic to his role and length of time away from his family. It’s an aspect of space exploration films the genres tends to overlook or bypass, the sacrifice of duty and service in being away from those you love. In recent years Interstellar reflected this sacrifice and loss to an extent, but here, the absence of the instant communication works to highlight how alone he is on the surface of the moon, stoically fulfilling his contract and waiting for his return. As the time for his departure draws near, his mental condition starts to deteriorate, seeing visions of his partner, memories of conversations that have happened that he didn’t recall having. It raises the prospect of insanity through isolation which again, fits the larger narrative established in the opening moments but instead opts to pursue a different direction, his condition rapidly changing and affecting him before resulting in an accident and his apparent death. From here, the films true narrative is exposed and revealed to the audience.\n\nSam wakes up back in the safety of the Lunar base, Gerty seemingly providing medical care although there is no visible sign of the physical or mental deterioration that was present before the accident. In short order, he returns to the scene of the accident and discovers an injured body identical to his own. It changes the narrative of the film and becomes one of the conflict between being alive and being human, the gradual revelation to the audience Sam in either iteration shown is derived from a seeming endless supply of clones stored in hibernation on the Lunar surface, working a three year contract before being decommissioned, their memories apparently lost with the only continuity between cycles Gerty whose sole focus is the preservation and well being of the various Sam clones. It becomes evident this isn’t a hostile or dangerous AI, Gerty cares for the well being of both versions of Sam, a really effective performance from Rockwell in portraying two distinct and different personalities to the same individual. A lot intense and conflicting issues but managed in a calm and measured fashion without losing track of the central premise, how do you define life and the human existence.\n\nThere is a moment of sadness as Sam makes contact with his daughter and wife on Earth having established real time communications and realising a significant time has passed, far beyond his original preconceptions as his child has now aged significantly, the original version of himself living happily with his family. With the impending arrival of the company to sanitise the facility, there is a growing menace that builds until the final moments of the film, Sam having to trust in the AI presence of Gerty to ensure his survival. Facing the prospect of presumed, termination having realised the true nature of his existence and exposure of the cloning process or escape from the lunar base, the awakened Sam triggers the activation of the next worker, erasing the memory of Gerty and escaping through the mining samples capsule. It preserves the facade of normality for the arriving sanitation team providing Sam enough time to return to Earth and alerting the world to the realisation to the true measure of what their power cost. The film concludes with the conversation beginning on the planet below.\n\nThe Good and the Bad\n\nThe film, looks amazing, considering a relatively modest budget compared to its peers in the genre, it certainly elevates itself above its humble station as an independent cinema release. Certainly there are areas where you do begin to notice some restrictions in filming locations and reuse of assets, the setting is largely contained entirely to the Lunar base but the external shots and effects are impressive and do stand to scrutiny. Through the use of post-production company Cinesite, any budgetary issues detectable in using practical model effects were taken out after shooting leaving a solid and visually ‘weighted‘ feel to this cinematic universe. I won’t tangent onto the benefits of practical effects against digital, a conversation for another day but certainly a well crafted, detailed model has certain aesthetic benefits in how it interacts with the landscape terrain. I’d imagine there is a reason the great directors in this genre such as Ridley Scott opt for practical effects where possible, the xenith and plinth of science fiction often cited as Blade Runner utilising this approach of supporting physical sets with digital effects as a secondary function. Here, in Moon whilst certain elements such as the external shots of space and the Earth in the background are added on in post-production, the base itself and surface ere constructed on sound stages, miniatures dragged across the constructed moon surface on wires before being removed afterwards.\n\nIt stands and works as an intelligent Science Fiction movie, discarding the crutches of the genre and opting to pursue a near future approach to space exploration and human endeavours. The Martian in 2015 opted to use a similar approach casting Matt Damon as a Botanist on the surface of Mars left alone after a disastrous attempt to escape a storm front, and utilising real science to survive before his rescue. The Moon was shown to an audience at NASA after its release, praised for its depiction of the mundane and repetition of performing routine tasks in an extraordinary environment and setting. You sense a real knowledge and enthusiasm for this genre and subject matter in how director Duncan Jones describes the reasoning and process behind certain decisions such as the basis for filming on the dark side of the moon. It’s very easy to dismiss Science Fiction as a genre, often in part because of the absurdity of more mainstream releases such as Star Wars and the Marvel franchise. As a fan you do want to hold these more grounded realities and environments in films such as Moon or Sunshine as the best examples of the genre, that do have a certain fictional narrative but attempt to ground the experience in near future science along current trajectories technological advancement. It not only adds authenticity to the entire production but allows you to immerse more fully into the experience.\n\n“For the exteriors, we built this chunk of lunar terrain, about 30 foot by 40 foot, and were pulling around model miniatures. So we went with a very retro technique for doing those effects. Obviously, we had the benefit of having the backup of a post-production company like Cinesite, who sort of beautified and fixed all the obvious problems, like being able to see fishing line when we were pulling trucks across the lunar landscape and digitally expanding the landscape. But we tried to capture as much as possible in-camera in order to save ourselves money and to give the film a different, hybrid look that just felt more real.”\n\nDuncan Jones, SyFyWire\n\nUnfortunately it is a little uncomfortable watching today with one of the few supporting characters, the bases robot GERTY played by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. It raises the issue of separating the artist from the composition, a near impossible act in the current climate but a necessary one to find any enjoyment and appreciation for his role in the film. Taken on its merits, both actors deliver strong performances here, Rockwell playing various iterations of the same individual, often acting against himself and the performance of Spacey who you do spend almost the entirety of the movie second guessing its motives before the realisation there is a bond between the AI presence and the clones of the worker and its attempt to keep them alive and well irrespective of orders from its superiors on Earth. I did enjoy the performance of Rockwell in playing the same character a little differently and creating that differentiation between the two, the first injured clone more fatigued and run down, the second more refined and by the book yet both coming to the realisation of their existence and reacting quite differently. Beyond that, given its limited budget there aren’t many more actors or performances of note, though a staple of the hard science fiction genre Benedict Wong appears in a small role as one of the support workers from Earth communicating to the Lunar Base. He’s appeared in nearly every cited hard sci-fi movie discussed here, a happy coincidence to note.\n\nThe main issue with the film and a similar thematic problem with other releases in the genre such as The Martian, Sunshine and even Christopher Nolan‘s, Interstellar is the point where the narrative pulls away from the ‘grounded setting’ and nature of the film for the purpose of the story. The setting and near future projections for NASA’s exploration and settlement on the Lunar surface make for a fascinating story in itself, in the early moments of this film it depicts the monotony of life in an incredible setting. The introduction of the clone elements, the authoritarian company on Earth controlling the fate of the Moons inhabitants and the implied menace of the arriving rescue party just felt like plot mechanics to add suspense that were perhaps, unnecessary. In much the same way as the political events on Earth in The Martian or the side mission to investigate the sister ship in Sunshine just felt added on to give an emotional gravitas, here the existential debates on existence felt, a little contrived. I’m glad Jones has continued to build and shape this unique cinematic universe and concept beyond this initial film with a connection to his Netflix exclusive film Mute released in 2018 featuring the same character in a small role. Equally, the setting in all of these films is very much a character and threat of its own, Sunshine found a certain measure of plausibility with its more fatalist take on the dangers of space, here Moon also works to show the dangers of isolation and the cost of human life. Sometimes the journey is more rewarding than the destination, here the narrative elements almost worked against the incredible production and setting.\n\nIn Summary\n\nMoon is an enjoyable and often cerebral film to watch and enjoy, an ode to the intellectual science fiction films of the past few decades that pursued a narrative and theme against the backdrop of the stars. What starts as a somewhat grounded narrative of the fatigue and loneliness in working alone in space shifts into an intellectual debate on what defines life and living with elements of forced servitude and labour thrown in for good measure. Visually and from a general presentation point of view, there is an instant familiarity to a great many films that have come before, the interior location and set has a strong resemblance for the clean crisp setting of 2001 and Alien, fortunately it never feels as if Moon is lacking for substantive ideas and inspiration, more a passing homage and ode to these illustrious films whilst managing to chart and define its own path. It looks amazing despite its limitations with an impressive use of model work one of its highlights that adds a real authenticity to the production in addition to a memorable and stirring soundtrack.\n\nI was a little hesitant whether I would enjoy this anchoring the entire story around Sam Rockwell’s character Bell. My only memorable experience of the actor to date despite an impressive list of films to his credit was a forgettable appearance in the Star Trek ode Galaxy Quest as the Red Shirt inspired security officer Guy Fleegman. I’ll humbly concede he delivered two really distinct and memorable interpretations of the same character, a difficult task to showcase different aspects and traits of the same individual whilst making each distinct and believable. To his credit, you do find yourself buying into each of these characters as their own people, supported by a calm and nuanced delivery from Kevin Spacey that despite controversies in recent years that has seen the actor fall from grace is able to bring to life a memorable robotic presence that supports the main narrative in much the same way as HAL from 2001. For the duration of the film you do question it’s intentions and whether it poses a threat to Bell’s well being, the final decision towards the films conclusion adds a real sense of pathos and humanity when you realise the bond that has been formed between machine and man.\n\nPerhaps it lacks a little of the enjoyment and spectacle of films in recent years with a similar setting and premise, the notion and idea of cloning and a labour class have been explored and depicted in more dramatic fashion, notably the release from Quantic Dream, Detroit: Become Human that whilst focusing on robotics touched upon the idea of a cheap disposable labour class easily replaceable and treated as subservient to humanity. The warmth and soul of the film comes entirely from Rockwell’s performance, and thankfully he delivers with aplomb in his depiction of the two characters and aspects of himself, the first deteriorating clone has a real lethargic personality, the second a more devil may care side to his actions and behaviors that contrast between each other. It’s not necessarily a fun film, it lacks a little humour and humanity for a film that is centred around these notions, but equally the moment Bell discovers his family, and ultimately the reason for holding onto his humanity is a facade is shattering, you do feel and imagine what it would feel like to come to that realisation in his place. As with any Spacey film, you are required now to separate the artist from the work and it can feel a little uncomfortable in certain parts buying into the character of Gerty but equally it succeeds based on this bond between the two you do find yourself absorbed by its characters and story forgetting its stars and limitations. Worthy praise indeed when you’re absorbed into the universe and here it succeeds with merit.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed reading this blog please come and visit and ‘like’ the Comfortably Adventurous Facebook page and contribute your feedback and comments, the interaction for those that have enjoyed and found these articles informative helps beyond measure.
