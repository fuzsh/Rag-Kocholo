Based on a true story, Jim Carrey stunningly portrays the late Andy Kaufman - considered the most innovative, eccentric and enigmatic comic of his time - in Man on the Moon. \"Jim Carrey is extraordinary\" says The New York Post. \"Jim Carrey may be a better Andy Kaufman than Andy Kaufman\" writes Newsweek. Also starring Danny DeVito as Kaufman's manager, Courtney Love as the woman Andy falls in love with and Paul Giamatti as his best friend. You'll stand up and cheer for Carrey in one of the year's most entertaining movies!",
