        "text": "Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum find themselves in each other’s orbit in the first trailer for Fly Me to the Moon.\n\nApple Original Films‘ romantic comedy feature from director Greg Berlanti hits theaters July 14, with Sony handling distribution. Jim Rash, Ray Romano and Woody Harrelson round out the cast for the film that takes place against the backdrop of the Apollo 11 moon launch in 1968.\n\nFly Me to the Moon focuses on Kelly Jones (Johansson), a marketing whiz tasked with improving NASA’s public image who ends up complicating the challenging task at hand for launch director Cole Davis (Tatum). In order to appease the White House, she is charged with staging a fake moon landing as a second option in case the mission fails.\n\n“If you fake this mission, every single thing that we have sacrificed will have been for nothing,” Tatum warns Johansson in the trailer.\n\nBerlanti helmed the movie from a script by Rose Gilroy, with Bill Kirstein and Keenan Flynn credited for the story. Producers are Johansson, Jonathan Lia, Keenan Flynn and Sarah Schechter, while Robert J. Dohrmann serves as executive producer.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported in 2022 that the film — previously titled Project Artemis and boasting a $100 million-plus budget — landed Berlanti as director after Jason Bateman left due to creative differences. Additionally, Tatum stepped in to star opposite Johansson after Chris Evans dropped out amid scheduling issues.\n\nJohansson’s recent credits include last year’s Wes Anderson film Asteroid City, and she voices a role in Paramount’s forthcoming animated title Transformers One. The actress, whose drama North Star premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival, is also known for playing Marvel’s Black Widow, which she most recently did in Disney’s eponymous 2021 feature.\n\nTatum showed off his fancy footwork in last year’s Magic Mike’s Last Dance after appearing in the 2022 movies Dog and The Lost City. He also has a role in the Zoë Kravitz-directed thriller Blink Twice, set for release this summer.\n\nBerlanti is a prolific television producer whose small-screen projects have included Arrow, The Flash and Riverdale. His most recent feature as a director was 2018’s Love, Simon."
