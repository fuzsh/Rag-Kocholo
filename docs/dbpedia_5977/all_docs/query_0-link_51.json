        "text": "The best thing about Chris Smith’s documentary “Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond—Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton,” which is streaming on Netflix, is that it serves as a reminder of Andy Kaufman’s singular genius. His was a genius that has yet to be assimilated by comedy or television or, for that matter, by movies, least of all by Milos Forman’s 1999 bio-pic about Kaufman, “Man on the Moon,” which stars Jim Carrey and is the subject of Smith’s documentary.\n\n“Jim & Andy” exists because Kaufman’s girlfriend, Lynne Margulies, and his friend and collaborator Bob Zmuda shot extensive behind-the-scenes footage, which had never been publicly seen, of Carrey at work on “Man on the Moon.” Smith uses the footage to create a double portrait of Carrey and Kaufman, and of the former’s extraordinary portrayal of the latter. What it reveals—and what makes the film indispensable—is that Carrey remained in character as Kaufman (or as Kaufman’s alter ego Tony Clifton, the crude and aggressive insult singer) throughout the shoot, off-camera, behind the scenes, in his dressing room, and even in venues outside the studio, such as on an impromptu visit to Steven Spielberg’s production company. What’s more, Carrey is an active participant in “Jim & Andy,” speaking at length on camera in a recent interview, in which he discusses his entire life and career and goes into specific detail about his incarnation of Kaufman. Some of his remarks prove deeply illuminating about his work in the role, but the use that Smith makes of those remarks, structuring “Jim & Andy” around Carrey’s own retrospective view of this performance and of his life and career, draws attention away from the archival footage, which is more than of merely archival significance—it’s a better film about Kaufman than “Man on the Moon,” and Carrey gives an even greater performance in that footage than he did in Forman’s bio-pic.\n\nIn the recent interview, Carrey talks about the metaphysical moment he experienced when he learned that he was cast in the role: “I decided for the next few days to speak telepathically to people . . . That’s the moment when Andy Kaufman showed up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, ‘Siddown, I’ll be doing my movie.’ What happened afterwards was out of my control.” Carrey adopts Kaufman’s identity to such an extent that, as seen in the archival footage, when Forman needs to communicate with Carrey, he’s reduced to addressing “Andy” and asking him to pass a message along to “Jim.”\n\nCarrey’s lower-case-m method, a virtual parody of a technique that’s itself a parody of Method acting, nonetheless yields astonishing results. The power of Carrey’s performance as Kaufman in the film is both an impersonation of gestures and a seeming possession of emotional energy—and the backstage submersion of Carrey into Kaufman serves a special purpose regarding this onscreen incarnation, a purpose differing from that which is served by other actors remaining constantly in character while working on a movie. The difference is that the game that Carrey plays, of suspending the boundary between performance and reality, is the defining trait of Kaufman’s work. An actor staying in character in the role of a bear hunter or a pilot isn’t hunting bears or flying planes while in the dressing room; whereas Carrey, by turning his backstage and offscreen existence into an elaborate fiction, is flying Kaufman’s plane, hunting his bear.\n\nThe subject of Andy Kaufman’s performances was performance. He definitively broke the boundary between a joke and a practical joke, between person and persona. He proved that a joke is, in essence, a floating set of quotation marks; when comedians tell a joke, they are, in effect, quoting themselves (or their writers). Kaufman realized that those quotation marks could be put on any words, any actions, any thing—and turn anything in existence into a joke, opening up a seemingly infinite abyss of put-ons and deceptions.\n\nBut Kaufman didn’t put quotation marks around random things. He put them around extremes of feeling—love and hate, sweetness and bitterness. He took the “Mighty Mouse” song and the Rockettes and excavated the heroism and the joy from pop kitsch—and found humor, absurdity, and comedy in the disproportion between their simplistic form and their powerful emotions. He did the same thing with the cruelty, the egotism, the contempt of Tony Clifton, and of himself as an anti-feminist wrestling villain.\n\nBreathtaking, awe-inspiring, and frightening scenes of Carrey imitating—being—Kaufman on the set are scattered throughout “Jim & Andy,” but they’re rendered as snippety-snippets, decorated with music, parenthesized with Carrey’s current-day remarks—consistently and frustratingly defanged, neutered, packaged. Carrey talks about the “Hyde” who takes over when he performs—though with a caveat, calling his inner double a “good Hyde.” It’s clear when Carrey is performing; by contrast, Kaufman was Hyding in plain sight, rendering himself and his characters and performances indistinguishable, and his Hydes are clearly not all good ones. His wrestling routine was a display of pure villainy, flaunting misogyny, vanity, egotism, and condescension; his act as Tony Clifton was insulting and violent. He played holy innocents and monsters with equal abandon.\n\nIt’s meant as no insult to Carrey, one of the great comedians of the era, to say that he extended the art of comedy, whereas Kaufman transformed it. Carrey’s career slotted into existing formats and helped to revitalize them; Kaufman’s career broke existing formats and created new ones. What Carrey did, onscreen, playing Kaufman is extraordinary in an utterly ordinary way; it’s a bio-pic performance at a very high level of achievement. But what Carrey did to prepare for that performance is a work of art in itself—a work of performance art that, fortunately, was documented on video. From his imitation of the frame-breaking, persona-melding Kaufman, Carrey derived the essence of Kaufman and, working on an expensive Hollywood film with a famous and acclaimed director, put the backstage environment and his relationship with that director at risk in order to play the role with the sense of commitment and identification, the sense of danger, that he felt it required.\n\nOne of the most memorable events in Kaufman’s career is also perhaps the most horrible one—when Jerry Lawler slammed him head-first onto the floor of the wrestling ring, jamming and nearly breaking Kaufman’s neck. The behind-the-scenes footage of the shoot of “Man on the Moon” shows that the dramatization of that event was originally to have featured a stunt double for the awful moment, but Carrey insisted on doing the entire scene himself—and it had terrifying consequences. After being thrown to the canvas by Lawler, Carrey lay motionless, called for help, and was fitted with a neck brace and transported to the hospital in an ambulance. His ostensible injury was widely reported as news, and, when he returned to the studio, reporters were waiting at the gates. Seeing this in the “Jim & Andy” footage should be as scary for the viewer as it was for the members of the cast and crew on the set who saw it happening before their eyes. Instead, Carrey in the present day is edited into the material, before it unfolds, explaining that he was only pretending: “I was thinking as an actor, in my head: How far should I take this? How far would Andy take it?”\n\nThe emotional recklessness, the physical danger, the political risk of misinterpretation were the constants of Kaufman’s career—and Carrey’s wildly daring incarnation, as documented in the rediscovered footage, replicates that risk in cinematic form. That’s why the footage is treated as if it’s radioactive. Forman didn’t draw on it for the film; the studio mandates that it be locked away so that their star doesn’t come off as an “asshole”; and Smith firmly and clearly contextualizes it in the documentary as an archival object under glass, apostrophized commentary, clip-happy editing, and music.\n\nWhat if Forman had jettisoned the actual footage of “Man on the Moon” and the entire film had become nothing but the documentary of the making of a feature film that itself never got made—the “Blair Witch Project” of comedy, and of Hollywood? “When I watch the footage of the stuff we took behind the scenes,” the present-day Carrey says in “Jim & Andy,” “I often wish that that was part of the movie, that it had been married in the movie, because most people felt that the movie was happening behind the camera.” He is right. “Man on the Moon” is to Carrey as “Jim & Andy” is to the videos of Carrey—both of them repress and normalize what defies easy interpretation and ready categorization in the performance. Just as “Man on the Moon” isn’t up to Carrey’s performance in it (let alone up to Kaufman’s own career, which it—as Carrey was well aware, in character as Kaufman, and tells Forman—turns into “Hollywood”), “Jim & Andy” isn’t up to the 1998 backstage footage of Carrey that Smith presents. The conventions of fiction and documentary prove to be the definitive enemies of artists who defied and disdained them."
