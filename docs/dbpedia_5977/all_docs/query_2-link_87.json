        "text": "When it came out in 2019, Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story joined a long line of films that made divorce—or, at least, the fallout from falling out of love—their focus. As divorce rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s, set off by the same shifting social mores that fueled Women’s Lib, Hollywood reacted in kind, trading simpering visions of American domesticity for lively portraits of familial distress. Yes, there’s a line to be drawn from Marriage Story to The Squid and the Whale (2005), which deals with Baumbach’s parents’ separation, but one can’t reasonably discuss divorce in the movies without mentioning either 1979’s Kramer vs. Kramer, with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, or Ingmar Bergman’s punishing Scenes from a Marriage (1973)—recently remade for HBO.\n\nAll of the above help to round out our list of the most moving, carefully observed, and darkly funny films about divorce (or separation) ever made. Read on for the rest of our picks.\n\nThe Awful Truth (1937)\n\nHow to Watch: Buy it on Amazon.\n\nKramer vs. Kramer (1979)\n\n“Kramer vs. Kramer wouldn’t be half as good as it is—half as intriguing and absorbing—if the movie had taken sides,” Roger Ebert observed in 1979. Helmed by director and screenwriter Robert Benton, who based his script on Avery Corman’s 1977 novel, the film centered instead on two characters, Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna (Meryl Streep), with a great deal to learn: Joanna about herself, which she does largely offscreen, and Ted about being a father. (Three food scenes—two with French toast, one with ice cream—help to chart his progress with their young son, Billy, played by Justin Henry.) An instant classic, Kramer vs. Kramer swept the 1980 Academy Awards, nabbing best picture, best director, best actor (for Hoffman, his first), best supporting actress (for Streep, her first), and best adapted screenplay.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nShoot the Moon (1982)\n\nHow to Watch: While not officially available to stream, the full film isn’t difficult to find online.\n\nHeartburn (1986)\n\nAdapted from Nora Ephron’s eponymous 1983 novel, Heartburn recounts with certain slight modifications the events that precipitated her divorce from journalist Carl Bernstein in 1980. The film, Ephron’s second collaboration with director Mike Nichols, stars an acerbic Meryl Streep as Rachel Samstat, a food writer, and Jack Nicholson as Mark Foreman, a political columnist revealed to be having an affair. “One day, I was sitting at the typewriter writing something else, and started writing a novel about the end of my marriage,” Ephron recalls in the 2013 documentary Makers: Women Who Make America. (She died in 2012.) “I’m really not interested in women as victims; so one of the things I like about Heartburn is that it is basically: Look what happened to me, and guess what? I get to have the last laugh because I get to be funny about it.”\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon with Epix, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nWaiting to Exhale (1995)\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nThe Squid and the Whale (2005)\n\n“Two contrasting things kept me from writing this story,” Noah Baumbach said of his wonderfully wry The Squid and the Whale in 2009; “on the one hand, everyone deals with divorce—it’s too universal. On the other, it’s too specific to my family, and won’t resonate beyond that. Unconsciously, at some point I just let go and thought, Let’s see what happens.” Starring Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney as the sparring, intellectual parents to two adolescent sons (Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline), The Squid and the Whale responds to some of Baumbach’s own experiences as a product of divorce in the 1980s. But yet, much like Kramer vs. Kramer, the film refuses to choose between Mr. and Mrs. Berkman, looking instead to how their boys, Walt and Frank, negotiate confused allegiances of their own.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon, iTunes, or YouTube.\n\nA Separation (2011)\n\nA Separation, from the Iranian director and screenwriter Asghar Farhadi, is about truths, mistruths, and all kinds of tests of faith, but it begins and ends with a couple at odds about how to take care of their family. While Simin (Leila Hatami) doesn’t want to raise her daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), in Iran, Nader (Peyman Moaadi), her husband, has an ailing father to look after. The trouble starts when Simin moves out, and Nader must hire an aide. Thick with cultural insights and ethical ambiguity (A.O. Scott called it “a rigorously honest movie about the difficulties of being honest”), A Separation was littered with accolades, among them the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2012.\n\nHow to Watch: Stream on Amazon.\n\nCrazy, Stupid, Love (2011)\n\nGlenn Ficarra and John Requa’s Crazy, Stupid, Love stars Steve Carrell as Cal, a middle-aged man who, after separating from his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), strikes up a friendship with the womanizing Jacob (Ryan Gosling) and begins to meet women again. Yet bolstered confidence (and a new wardrobe) can’t change Cal’s longing to reconnect with Emily—and Jacob has love troubles of his own."
