        "text": "With teary eyes, I finish watching Patricia Riggin’s 2007 film La Misma Luna one more time, a testimony of the unconditional love between a mother and son. Carlitos Reyes, a 9-year-old boy, who lives in Mexico with his grandmother. Carlitos is separated from his mother, Rosario, a housekeeper in Los Angeles, California. I feel a knot in my throat as I follow Carlitos’ journey to reuniting with his mother.\n\nThe experiences Carlitos goes through, such as navigating grief, being abandoned by coyotes (smugglers), and relying on the kindness of strangers, seem almost impossible to believe. La Misma Luna provides a refreshing angle on how people view immigration. This film does something remarkable and allows viewers to attach a story to the immigrant experience and hardships. I felt how effortlessly through its narrative, the film teaches viewers to be selfelss and follow dreams bigger than themselves.\n\nThe lack of Latine representation in films and the media has always been a topic of conversation. For me, one of the few first experiences in which I saw another Latine’s story portrayed positively was in La Misma Luna. Throughout the film, Rosario tells Carlitos that no matter how far away they are from each other, he must remember that they are both “under the same moon” alluding to the film’s title. Enrique, the man that helps Carlitos make the treacherous journey of finding his mother, adds a deeper meaning to the story. His development throughout the film brings forth the idea of new beginnings and strays away from the stereotypical “machista” portrayal of Latine men in the media.\n\nLa Misma Luna, is a story full of hope and perseverance, bringing change to not only how society views immigrants but the Latine community as a whole.\n\nI vividly remember the first time I watched La Misma Luna. I was in the seventh grade, the last day before the summer break. It was the first time I saw both my parents’ story on the screen. For once, somebody did not portray a Mexican story as dangerous to society. The political climate of 2016 was an era I recall being full of uncertainty, one I was not old enough to grapple with. I often think about why my teacher showed us La Misma Luna, and it was his way of easing the worry many of my classmates and I felt for our parents.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got home was tell my parents about the truly transformative experience I had in my English class and, of course, look all over YouTube for the movie I spent all evening talking about. As my parents watched, I noticed their eyes get watery at the exact same moments mine were. We did not have to say anything to understand what we felt.\n\nCarlitos’ and Rosario’s stories made many immigrants like my parents feel seen. Whether they are the ones who leave their home or are left behind, a mutual feeling of solidarity and hope are expressed. La Misma Luna is timeless and allows for representation in the media and public opinion. Every time I rewatch the film, I view it from different perspectives and try to use that to understand and empathize with the characters and their journeys. I go through the same routine of gratitude and admiration for all the brave people that came before and after Rosario and Carlitos and sought a better life.\n\nThe opportunity to see my family’s story on the big screen makes me hopeful that our stories will continue to be told and celebrated. There’s something so powerful about seeing a relationship of pure love between a parent and their child, seeing them break all odds to one day be together. It brings forth the fact that we are all Under the Same Moon regardless of nationality, background or race. I truly cannot express the beauty of this film, as I watch and experience the magic of the characters over and over again."
