        "text": "Sometimes, Disney comes up with some really strange ideas. We had a war drama in Miracle of the White Stallions, we’ve got a political allegory in A Tiger Walks. Now we have a thriller? Seriously, reviews for this one compared it to Hitchcock. Not exactly what I associate with family movies, but hey, I can be optimistic. Hayley Mills is in it! It can’t be that scary!\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are capped from my copy of the movie with InstantShot! unless otherwise specified.\n\nWe’ve almost reached a couple of sad milestones, here. Not only is The Moon-Spinners Hayley Mills’ second to last film for Disney (that went fast!), but it’s Walt’s second to last credit as a producer. It’s also director James Neilson’s second-to-last Disney credit, following Moon Pilot, Bon Voyage, and Summer Magic. I guess these aren’t really milestones yet but this movie doesn’t have a whole lot of trivia so roll with me. This is the only film Michael Dyne wrote, as he primarily worked on television. His script was loosely based on the novel The Moon-Spinners by Mary Stewart.\n\nThis film suffered from a lot of the same problems at the box office as Sleeping Beauty. It actually didn’t do too poorly at the box office, making a decent amount of money and garnering mixed-to-positive reviews. However, it cost more than any of the studio’s exclusively live-action films to date, keeping it from turning a profit. Those mixed reviews criticized the melodramatic acting and plot, comparing it to a sanitized Hitchcock film, but praised Hayley Mills’ growth and the exquisite cinematography. All this is pretty promising and I kinda feel bad for comparing it to two lackluster movies in the cold open. Let’s go!\n\nSTORY\n\nNikky Ferris’s vacation to Crete is off to a bad start. She and her Aunt Frances are stuck on a nasty, smelly bus with a fish dangling in her face. Finally, the bus pulls in just outside the village of Aghios Georgios. Somewhere offscreen, the ladies acquire mules and meet a local boy named Alexis, who leads them into town right in the middle of his cousin’s Big Fat Greek Wedding. The whole village rings with color, laughter, and the very music Aunt Frances came here for! She’s a musicologist, looking to collect folk songs from around the world. What could be better than that? The groom happily invites the visitors to the celebrations, and they follow the processional along to the Moon-Spinners Inn.\n\nThe innkeeper, Sophia (who also happens to be Alexis’s mother), runs up to her brother Stratos’s room to warn him about the coming visitors. He demands to be left alone, but she interrogates him on his true intentions in coming back from England. He’s so angry and suspicious that he won’t let Sophia accept guests at her own hotel, which seems like a bad business model to me. When she calls him on how shady he’s acting and suggests he might be into something illegal, he orders her to mind her own business and throws her out of his room.\n\nDownstairs, the wedding celebrations are in full swing. Aunt Frances wonders aloud how the Moon-Spinners Inn got its name, and finds that it’s named after a folk song. They’re staying in the perfect place! After giving that piece of exposition, Alexis brings his mother over to meet the guests. She takes this surprisingly poorly for an innkeeper and refuses to let them rooms no matter how many times Aunt Frances asks. She insists she’ll sleep on the floor if she has to, and no joke, I’ve had people tell me the same thing when the hotel where I work is full. Sweet, simple Alexis pipes up that there are empty rooms and there goes that façade.\n\nWhen his mother relents, Alexis shows the visitors to their room, proudly revealing the incredible view of the Bay of Dolphins. As nice as it is, that wasn’t exactly the welcome they’d hoped for. Alexis tells them all about his mean old Uncle Stratos, but they don’t have to worry. He’ll help with anything they need. Still, he is like twelve, and Stratos is terrifying when he storms in demanding to know what the English ladies are doing here. Aunt Frances refuses to stand for this unwarranted rudeness and puts her foot down, but Stratos declares that they can only stay for the night and they’d better be gone in the morning. When he storms out, the two ladies share a good laugh over this terrible trip. Nikky heads out to the balcony to enjoy the view and spots a handsome, shirtless young British man on a motorboat in the bay.\n\nThis movie actually has decent segues! Stratos’s cousin and henchman Lambis moors the young man’s boat and accuses him of swimming in the Bay of Dolphins. The young man, Mark Camford, innocently tells him how clear the water is, but he knows Lambis was spying on him. But why? Well, there’ll be time for that. First, we go back to Nikky, who’s already enamored with Mark and determined to dress to impress before meeting him properly. It takes her all of five seconds to spot him enjoying the wedding festivities. She beelines to him, and he invites the two ladies to join him for dinner without even noticing Stratos giving them evil death stares.\n\nI’m sure it surprises exactly no one that a Hayley Mills character is physically incapable of shutting up. Mark finds it charming, and at least she’s not jabbering as bad as Nancy Carey. When he gets a chance to speak, Mark reveals a little bit more about Stratos’s strange, inhospitable behavior, but nothing particularly important. He sweeps her away to dance, and the camera sweeps us away to watch Stratos and Lambis getting real paranoid about the British visitors. After the dance, Aunt Frances decides a wedding is as good a place as any to do some research for work, so she asks Mark about the Moon-Spinners. Stratos, not Mark, snaps that the song is about three sisters who spin the full moon and unravel it throughout the month. But there’s more to it. The song refers to a treasure that lies at the bottom of the Bay of Dolphins. Stratos bristles at that and warns Mark and the ladies about the man-eating sharks swarming the Bay.\n\nAwkward. Alexis diffuses the tension by introducing Mark and Nikky to the bride and groom. Aunt Frances decides she’d just love to record the music at the wedding and present a gift to the bride all in the same swoop, so Nikky runs upstairs to get what they need. When she gets to her room, she finds Stratos rifling through their things! He says he’s looking for a book he left in there, but obviously that’s crap. Instead of reporting the encounter, Nikky blithely returns to the party to learn the local dances. She at least makes her suspicions known to Mark, but he tells her not to worry about it. That should make her worry about it more, but the cute boy asks her to go swimming with him in the morning and the girl has her priorities. Then they get everybody to do the Twist with them and it’s super weird.\n\nSoon, the party ends and the wedding procession files out to “sing the bride and groom to bed” which… woah now. Mark sends Nikky up to bed, but not before he takes a second to admire Nikky’s romantic notions and get as much mileage out of that title as possible. The second Nikky leaves, Stratos bursts outside, menacing Mark with a harpoon or inviting him to go fishing where he can stage a tragic accident. Thankfully, Mark is not that stupid, but he follows Stratos down to the docks. Little does he know that Lambis lurks behind with a gun. So we get back to Nikky! She complains that she’s at that weird in-between age where she’s too young to be beautiful and too old to be cute and she’ll never win over her crush like this. Aunt Frances reminds her that he liked her the way she is enough to ask her on a date, and that’s enough to cheer Nikky back up.\n\nLate that night, Stratos catches Mark spying on him at the Bay of Dolphins and signals to Lambis to give chase. Mark tries to run for it, but Lambis shoots him in the arm and he topples into the sea. It doesn’t look like he’ll make that date after all. When Nikky comes downstairs in her adorable pink bathing costume, Sophia tells her that Mark already left Aghios Georgios. Heartbroken, Nikky sets out to explore the bay on her own. Stratos watches the whole scene from upstairs, then goes back to disposing of Mark’s personal effects because that’s not suspicious at all. Also not suspicious is the shoe Nikky finds washed up on the beach. Nothing weird about that at all.\n\nHer wanderings take her to an old abandoned church full of elaborate paintings of saints. As she examines the ancient art, she spots some red on the floor that are definitely not paint. The blood trail leads to a handprint on the wall, signalling a hidden door and a staircase into the church’s crypt. Blood trail aside, this level of suspense is unusual for a Disney movie and I’m kinda into it, even though I really really hate jumpscares. It’s okay, though, the hand that drops from the grave scaring the daylights out of Nikky and me both belongs to Mark. He’s in rough shape after getting shot in the arm but he’s lucid enough to apologize for the whole date thing. Obviously, he’s got bigger problems, but he won’t tell Nikky what’s going on (though she figures out Stratos’ involvement pretty quickly) and he won’t accept help from the police or medical professionals. No, it’s up to Nikky to get supplies and bandage the wound with her own scarf.\n\nWhen Nikky enters Mark’s room for some clean clothes, she finds it completely empty. That’s weird. She grabs some cloth and a first aid kit from her own room, then heads down to the bar for a bottle of brandy. Unfortunately, the bar is full of old ladies from the village, recording the Moon-Spinners song for Aunt Frances. Nikky has to be sneaky if she’s going to get the brandy out, so she hides behind the bar and moves it as carefully as possible. It works out, mostly. One old woman spots the bottle moving “by itself” and thinks she’s going crazy because this movie is light on wackiness, but that’s about it. She doesn’t stop her or anything and soon Nikky makes it back to the church with the supplies in hand.\n\nOf course, someone’s going to notice these things missing. Aunt Frances can’t find her blanket (Travelling rug. Whatever. It’s a blanket.) or her first aid kit, so obviously Stratos is the best person to ask. Once again he gets super defensive because of Nikky’s connection to the man he shot last night. To keep up appearances he promises to find Nikky and sets off for the Bay of Dolphins. To look for her. Obviously. Meanwhile, Nikky gets to work redressing Mark’s would with real bandages and iodine. He still won’t tell her what happened and it’s getting super frustrating because she knows it was Stratos and we saw it was Stratos and I know he’s trying to protect her but come on, movie. Mark tells Nikky to get to Aghios Nicolaos and away from this whole situation as fast as possible.\n\nAfter Mark pushes her away, Nikky heads back to the inn and runs straight into Stratos. She comes up with a flimsy and obvious lie about using the blanket and first aid kit to help an injured shepherd but he sees right through it. He knows she’s helping Mark and “knows” that she’s in on all this shady business, so he grabs her and drags her kicking and screaming into the church. Knowing all is lost, Nikky yells to Mark to watch out, but he’s ahead of the game. There’s nothing there but a bloodstained sweater. Now the only target for Stratos’s rage is Nikky. After a particularly horrifying cut, Stratos returns to the inn pretending he regrets not finding Nikky. He promises to look again when he and Lambis go shooting quail later.\n\nWhen he goes to grab his gun, Sophia stops him. She demands to know what’s going on. She knows he was lying and he has something to do with that poor girl’s disappearance. She also seriously doubts Mark took a bus out of town and she will not take any more of this. He ignores her and shoves past her to join Lambis on his hunt for Mark. Mark himself does his very best to manage the pain in his arms as the two criminals stalk him like an animal. Lucky for him, he spots a familiar face in the middle of nowhere and convinces Alexis to make sure Nikky and Aunt Frances get safely to Aghios Nicolaos. Well, Nikky’s a bit tied up at the moment. Tied up in the attic of a windmill, in fact, until Stratos returns to dispose of her. Alexis hears her screaming for help and runs off to get Mark to help save her.\n\nBack at the inn, Stratos manages to convince Aunt Frances that he’s still looking for her niece. Sophia doesn’t buy it, though. She confronts her brother and declares that she’s done with him and his lies, even if it means poverty (he financed her inn and basically pays for her to live). But Stratos knows she’ll never report him to the police. If she does, something terrible might happen to Alexis, her precious son. It’s a great character moment. The reminder hits hard, even though we already know Stratos will sink to any depths, including locking an innocent woman in a windmill. Mark and Alexis try to break down the door, but find it locked tight. The only way in is through the window, high in the air.\n\nBy crazy random happenstance, the kids of the village just happen to have a game where they cling to the windmill sails and spin around until they can reach a hook embedded in the wall. And by crazy random happenstance, Alexis happens to be really good at this game. Funny, that. It’s very awkward writing, that’s all I’m saying. But at least Alexis gets through the window to cut Nikky’s bonds. She tries to hug him in gratitude but there’s “no time make love” (yeah that is the actual line), they have to get out of here. And there’s only one way down: the same way he came up. One look at the ground dozens of feet below makes Nikky queasy, so Alexis demonstrates for her. Nikky remains paralyzed with terror and I can’t even fault her because I’m getting vertigo just watching this. When Mark finds he can’t hold onto the sail with his injured arm, Nikky realizes she has to do this herself. Finally, she leaps out onto the windmill sail and, after circling the whole mill and missing the ground five or six times, makes it back to the ground.\n\nAs traumatic as that was, Nikky isn’t safe yet. She needs to get to Aghios Nicolaos now more than ever, even if Mark has to drag her there. But Nikky refuses. She’s done with this adventure. She wants the police to handle everything so she can go back to her aunt and her life. Mark tries to pull her down the hills again, but Nikky is sick and tired of being whipped around like a ragdoll. She rears back and slaps Mark across the face which I think is the proper response to a mostly sketchy guy you don’t know well trying to aggressively drag you someplace you don’t want to go, but she starts sobbing apologies almost immediately. He’s not your boyfriend yet, girl, and even if he was, you don’t have to just put up with that. It’s enough for Mark to get fed up with her, though, and he starts to storm off.\n\nHe doesn’t get very far. The second he turns his back, Lambis and his gun out from behind the rocks! Nikky tries to help but Lambis punches Mark unconscious and the two men fight. In a shocking step forward for Disney’s live-action ladies, Nikky actually does something during a fight scene! She picks up the fallen gun and knocks Lambis unconscious! Now, I’m not one to think a girl has to be violent or do traditionally masculine things in order to be strong, but defending herself and her crush is a sight better than Roberta standing there shrieking in Swiss Family Robinson. The bad guy is defeated, but the exertion proves too much for Mark. He collapses from his injuries and declares that he can’t go on. Ever loyal, Nikky helps him to his feet and walks him to a safe resting place.\n\nThat safe resting place turns out to be an abandoned Temple of Apollo. It’s far from ideal, but it’s shelter. Local legend says that the place is haunted, but the “ghosts” turn out to be very angry feral cats. Once they settle down, Mark finally, finally agrees to tell Nikky what’s going on. He used to work at a bank in London, taking care of some priceless emeralds for The Countess of Fleet. Sometimes, the Countess asked him to bring her the emeralds so she could bask in how rich she is or something like that. On his way for one of these deliveries, someone bashed him on the head and made off with the jewels while he was unconscious. Naturally, the authorities pinned the disappearance on him, as it’s the simplest explanation. But Mark never stopped trying to clear his name, and followed a lead to Stratos, then the owner of a Greek restaurant called The Moon-Spinners. He conveniently disappeared after the robbery and Mark followed a lucky hunch to track him to Crete.\n\nAccording to the Moon-Spinners legend, The Bay of Dolphins hides a fabulous treasure in its depths. It stands to reason that Stratos would hide his own fabulous treasure there. But while Mark has brilliant deductive skills, he doesn’t actually have any proof. Nikky believes her love interest implicitly, of course, and the two settle in for the night. As they drift off, Stratos finds the temple! And so begins the most ludicrous scene in the movie. The villain makes his way through the tunnels as cats hiss and yowl from the walls. Suddenly, they jump out at him, chasing him out of the temple, which really doesn’t sound that weird except most of the flying cats are very obviously stuffed animals flung from the wings. Someone got paid to hurl stuffed cats at Eli Wallach. It’s obviously better than the alternative, but it’s still hilarious to look at.\n\nOur young lovers sleep through that somehow, but wake when a shadow falls over them the next morning. Not to worry, it’s not Stratos. It’s an Englishman just like them, called Anthony Gamble. In fact, he’s the British consul! They’re saved! Nikky starts to tell the whole story but Mark still doesn’t know if they can trust this stranger so he covers her right up. Whatever the truth is, Mr. Gamble offers to drive them down to Aghios Nicolaos so they don’t have to keep roughing it in a temple full of stuffed cats. Mark remains skeptical but once Nikky hears that Mr. Gamble’s wife is a trained nurse who can finally give Mark’s shoulder proper attention, there’s no arguing with her.\n\nAt first, everything looks fabulous at the Gambles’ villa. Mr. Gamble’s wife, Cynthia, ushers Mark upstairs to examine his wound and Mr. Gamble even offers to have someone bring Aunt Frances here! It looks like all their problems are solved… but there’s still 45 minutes left of the movie. While Nikky enjoys her warm food and soft bed, Mr. Gamble retreats into his office, where he has a visitor— Stratos! He scolds him for his bloody-mindedness and insists that he can take it from here before someone comes to investigate him. That’s right, Gamble is in on the whole deal! But he wants Stratos and his astrology obsession out of it before they cause more problems. Speaking of more problems, Cynthia checks in on Nikky to tell her that Mark’s shoulder is infected. He needs a hospital, and for that they have to take him all the way to Athens. Before she gets to work on the arrangements, she goes into this pretentious rant about all the fine people she knows back in England.\n\nA yacht pulls in to the harbor, and Mr. Gamble very pointedly steers Nikky away from seeing it. It’s time for lunch, that’s all. Really. As they sit down to eat, Mr. Gamble promises that he’ll get Mark to the British hospital in Athens within a few hours… if they can get through yet another convenient street festival that exists only to serve as an overlong obstacle. You know, again. Mrs. Gamble totters down to the lunch table drunk out of her mind and starts slurring a bunch of nonsense about how much she hates living where there aren’t any fine people to talk to. She harbors particular contempt for an heiress named Madam Habib, with her huge jewel collection and a fortune she obtained after five husbands. She leaves as quickly as she arrived now that she finished her part in the plot, but it’s too late. She’s already come dangerously close to blowing her husband’s whole operation.\n\nNikky has plenty to tell Mark when she visits, even though he feels a little off. The name Madame Habib rings a bell for Mark, and he decides they need to leave right now. He’s not strong enough to move but only Nikky can stop him from trying to stumble around anyway. He can’t go to Athens, he has to stop this deal! She promises to look at the yacht outside to see if it’s really Madame Habib’s Minotaur if it means Mark will rest. When she gets to Mr. Gamble’s telescope, she sees the name The Minotaur written in clean gold script. There’s no mistaking it. Madame Habib has arrived to buy the jewels. Before she can turn around to report back to Mark, Mr. Gamble catches her and tries to steer her vision to harmless sightseeing.\n\nAn even lovelier distraction arrives in the form of an extremely relieved Aunt Frances, who knows all about the plan to get to Athens. She and Nikky (now in the most adorable green dress) tearfully hug and, once two servants carry Mark down on a stretcher, get ready to go. But the car set to take them to the airport isn’t exactly what they were expecting. Of course, Mark needs to stretch out, but sending a hearse seems a bit on the nose. Still, Mr. Gamble smooths it over and says his goodbyes, and soon the hearse is on its way to the airport in Iraklion. Unfortunately, the Festival of King Minos is in full swing and the revelers refuse to let the hearse through. In fact, the drunken party-goers have so little respect that they try to yank the doors open and get inside! On top of that, the festival lacks any music or visual interest as festivals go and it lasts entirely too long. Still, it’s one of only a few moments that really drags, so it could be worse.\n\nIn the back of the hearse, Nikky does her best to shield Mark from the noise, but Mark is absolutely done with this nonsense. He knows for a fact that Cynthia drugged him, but he found some kind of upper in the bathroom to counteract it which sounds dangerous to me but he’s fine. Now that Madame Habib is in the picture, he can’t go to Athens. He has to get back to Aghios Georgios like yesterday to get those jewels and finish this before Stratos can. But he still insists that Nikky needs to get to Athens where it’s safe, prompting yet another argument over whether or not Nikky will leave her boyfriend’s side. This particular argument culminates in Hayley Mills’ very first on-screen kiss! Not the most romantic circumstances, but I’ve seen worse. When they pull apart, Mark makes a break for it, slamming the door on Nikky. Nikky writes a note for her aunt on the window in lipstick and gives chase, but before she gets through the throng, Mark gets on a bus and disappears.\n\nNow Nikky is all alone, but there’s still something she can do to help! The Minotaur is still right outside on the harbor. If she can speak with Madame Habib and convince her not to buy the stolen jewels, they might have a chance at clearing Mark’s name. She commandeers a motorboat, jets right up to the yacht and begs to be allowed aboard. The eccentric old lady lets her into her cabin and listens to Nikky recount the whole story so far (I hate when they do this). The cold ocean spray chilled Nikky so badly that her sneezes interrupt the story and besides, the whole thing is so crazy Madame Habib needs a drink. Once the alcohol warms her up, Nikky counts up all the people who know about the jewel robbery. Madame Habib’s ears perk up at the mention of Anthony Gamble the British counsel- she knows him as an antiquities dealer. He’s the fence!\n\nOnly one possibility matters. Madame Habib declares that Nikky is insane just like “the girl from that English children’s book who walked through the glass into a world full of crazy people” which just makes me think how good Hayley Mills would be as Alice. Even doubting the story, Madame Habib still asks how she can help, prompting another borderline hysterical rant pleading the heiress not to buy the jewels. If she just hands them over the Mark, he can give them back to the Countess of Fleet and clear his name. Speaking of Mark, he makes it back to the Bay of Dolphins just in time to catch Stratos taking his boat out. While Mark hides among the rocks, Stratos fishes up an ordinary lobster pot with a very extraordinary catch: a small brown-wrapped package. It’s the jewels! Mark leaps down to attack Stratos and the two men fight while Alexis looks on.\n\nHe runs back to the inn just as the hearse pulls up, and frantically tells Aunt Frances that he saw Stratos kill Mark. Aunt Frances panics as he leads her back to the Bay of Dolphins, thinking Nikky is with Mark and in trouble. Of course, she isn’t. She’s aboard The Minotaur, unharmed if a bit drunk on brandy. The yacht docks in the Bay of Dolphins, and Madame Habib hides Nikky in her liquor cabinet to make sure Stratos doesn’t see her when he comes in. He wastes absolutely no time storming up to Madame Habib with the fabulous emerald necklace in hand, demanding his money. Nikky eavesdrops on the conversation, but immediately blows her whole cover with an ill-timed and very loud drunken hiccup.\n\nJust as Stratos flings the door open and discovers Nikky, Mark boards The Minotaur and saves his girl from getting her head bashed open. Once again, the two men brawl on the floor, smashing up Madame Habib’s priceless furniture. The nerve. Once again, Nikky proves her worth as a heroine by seizing the jewels to hold them over the mens’ heads. They each grab a side and end up pulling the whole necklace apart, enraging Stratos into hurling her into a post hard enough to knock her out. One more punch from Mark knocks Stratos out, and Madame Habib’s security swarms in with the Cretan police. He whines that the stars lied to him as they haul him off to prison. Mark and Nikky embrace while he scolds her for meddling, and Madame Habib invites everyone to enjoy the rest of the voyage. She has to go lie down. They hear Alexis calling them outside and wave goodbye to him, promising him they’ll come back and have a big wedding.\n\nDisney’s definitely starting to find their groove with their live-action adventures. I thoroughly enjoyed this one! It felt a little bloated and one or two scenes dragged a little bit, but I liked the characters and it was fun working out all the pieces of the puzzle. Hayley Mills and Peter McEnery had nice chemistry and the supporting characters were delightful to spend some time with. It would be a nice introduction to the thriller genre for a younger audience, as there’s nothing particularly complex or scary here. As an adult, I can still definitely think of worse ways to spend two hours!\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nNicola “Nikky” Ferris embodies all the qualities of Hayley Mills’ other characters: cheerfulness, loquaciousness, and pluckiness. But Hayley is eighteen now, and the writing for Nikky definitely feels a little more mature than Pollyanna, the twins, Mary Grant, or Nancy Carey. She’s still naïve, but she’s a little more worldly and can handle herself quite capably in a crisis. And she gets to be a romantic lead! She’s not the greatest heroine we’ve seen so far, but she’s far from the worst, too. And they finally let her get rid of those weird poofy bangs!\n\nMark Camford is the perfect romantic lead. He’s suave and charming, with enough mystery to make us keep an eye on him but not enough that we ever really stop trusting him. Well, there’s one point, when he tries to drag Nikky down the hills, but she breaks him of that behavior real quick. My one problem with him was that there wasn’t enough focus on him, which kind of muddied the whole “clearing his name” thing. If we’d focused on him and Nikky supported him, the thriller aspect would be a lot stronger. That’s a minor thing, though. I can’t believe Peter McEnery didn’t have much of a career after this. He starred in a few movies and TV shows after this (including one more Disney film!) but nothing super notable, which is a tragedy because this boy is adorable.\n\nAunt Frances felt a little underused to me. Making her a musicologist sounded so much like an excuse to make this film a musical, but, spoilers, it’s not. In fact, she mostly disappears about halfway through and never really finds out anything that’s going on. It’s a real shame, because Joan Greenwood (Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Importance of Being Earnest) is a huge name to barely put in the movie!\n\nAlexis fills our Disney requirement of a cute, quirky youngster. He’s actually kind of adorable, with some of the best lines in the film, but his weird broken English kept getting on my nerves. I think it was supposed to represent a Cretan boy with a fascination with British/Western culture, but none of the other Greek characters spoke that way. He’s a nice positive presence in a movie where nearly everyone is sketchy, but I could not get over the way he talked. Michael Davis is American, too, so there’s really no excuse.\n\nStratos is so obviously our villain from the very start that it kind of messes with the mystery elements. However, because we know who is behind everything from the word go, it lets us focus our attention on how Nikky and Mark are going to stop him. He doesn’t do himself any favors, either, constantly acting like a jerk even to his business partners. I guess they didn’t want to waste a second of Eli Wallach’s talent. He made quite a name for himself playing villains in such famous works as The Magnificent Seven and The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. Nerdier circles might recognize him as Mr. Freeze in the ’60s Batman series, and he’s done work as recently as 2010 in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps!\n\nMadame Habib became a major marketing point for this film, despite only appearing at the very end. Walt personally convinced legendary silent film actress Pola Negri to come out of retirement for this film, where she basically played herself. I mean, I’m not really a silent film buff, but from what I can see the lady was levels of extra that make her perfect to play a dramatic, eccentric jewel collector. For example, the script called for Madame Habib to own a Siamese cat, but Pola Negri didn’t feel like that was good enough. So she ended up owning a cheetah named Shalimar instead. We all know how I feel about that in practice by now, but I’ve got to respect the drama behind the idea.\n\nMUSIC\n\nWe have a new face composing our music this time around! Well, not new. New to Disney. Ron Grainer had already made a name for himself writing the theme music for the original Doctor Who series in 1963, so you know this film was in good hands. Yet again, we have a climax with little music (why do they keep doing this?), but the rest of the film has a magnificent score. Every piece, especially “Village Wedding” and “Temple of the Stray Cat” utilizes traditional Greek instrumentation and themes to further the sense of place. Several films we’ve watched that are supposed to take place in a specific locale use pretty generic movie music, so it’s nice to hear the quavering notes of the bouzouki (thanks Google!) helping the visuals and script along.\n\nThe Moon-Spinners Theme uses those same instruments, bringing us to Crete the second we push play. The minor key sets us up for a mystery and an adventure, and best of all, Terry Gilkyson is finally stepping it up! This is easily my favorite of his songs so far. It won’t stay that way for long, but it’s way, way better than “Savage Sam and Me” or “Thomasina”. Repeating it later so it sounds like a folk song the characters would name their inn after is a really nice touch too!\n\nARTISTRY\n\nFirst off, let me say the Island of Crete is absolutely stunning. The outdoor shots, which comprise most of the film, were filmed on location, and Paul Beeson outdid himself showing off the island’s beauty. The smooth white buildings and craggy gray rocks contrast exquisitely with the turquoise waters in the Bay of Dolphins. Any exterior shot from this film could be the cover of a travel brochure for Crete. The interiors were shot on studio lots, but they’re quite lovely and detailed as well.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nIt seems we’ve hit a sweet spot in the history of Disney live-action films! Disney may not have hit the exact level of intrigue of a Hitchcock film, but he created an engaging mystery nonetheless. Our two leads worked, the music worked, the visuals worked, and it was all around a fine time! I think another draft might have done the script some good, especially with Alexis and Aunt Frances, but the final product is definitely more fun to watch than some of the other stuff I’ve seen.\n\nFavorite scene: Nikky saving Mark by braining the bad guy with a rifle butt. It’s so nice seeing a live-action heroine who does more than stand by and scream when things get real.\n\nFinal rating: 7/10. Another hidden gem, albeit one that could use a little polish.\n\nThis film was good, but the next one is practically perfect. Hold on, because I think I feel a change in the wind…."
