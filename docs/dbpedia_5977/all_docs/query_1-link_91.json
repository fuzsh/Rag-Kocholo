Artists address topics ranging from indigenous histories to the sublime British Columbia landscape. Several artworks focus on the personal experience of traveling to and discovering a new place.\n\nExhibiting artists: Joi Houston, Kyle McKenzie, Em Nicholas, Tijorn Skelton Mactavious, Abbi Surbrugg, and Caleb Thomas\n\nArtists’ Talk – Art & Place in Canada\n\n1 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 22, 2024\n\nPhelps Theater in Billingsly Student Center\n\nZoom link: https://mssu-edu.zoom.us/j/86356290355\n\nAdmission: free\n\nIn conjunction with the “Art & Place in Canada” exhibition by MSSU students and faculty in Spiva Art Gallery (Aug. 6-28), this talk will provide further perspective on the artists’ diverse creative responses to their travels.

Adaptability, the capacity to anticipate and manage dangers, is essential for the country to survive and thrive. But Canada is not as adaptable as it once was.\n\nIn The Adaptable Country, Dr. Alasdair Roberts explains what this vital ability means and why we are currently falling short. Politicians, he argues, are overloaded and fixated on the next election. Governments no longer launch big projects to think about the future. Leaders have stopped meeting regularly to discuss national priorities. Technological changes have undermined journalism andre the ability of citizens to talk civilly about public affairs. The public service has become less agile because of a decades-long buildup of controls and watchdogs. While in many ways Canada is a better country than it was a generation ago, it is also more complex and harder to govern.\n\nThe Adaptable Country outlines straightforward reforms to improve adaptability and reminds us about the bigger picture: in a turbulent world, authoritarian rule is a tempting path to security. Canada’s challenge is to show how political systems built to respect diversity and human rights can also respond nimbly to existential threats.\n\nDr. Alasdair Roberts is a professor of public policy at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He writes extensively on problems of governance, law and public policy. His most recent book, The Adaptable Country: How Canada Can Survive the Twenty-First Century, was recently published by McGill-Queen’s University Press, in the Canadian Essentials series edited by Professor Daniel Béland.\n\nIn 2007, Professor Roberts became the first non-U.S. citizen to be elected as a Fellow of the US National Academy of Public Administration. In 2022, he received the Riggs Award for Lifetime Achievement in International and Comparative Public Administration. He received a JD from the University of Toronto in 1984, a Master’s degree in Public Policy from Harvard University in 1986, and a Ph.D. in Public Policy from Harvard University in 1994.\n\nThe Great Canadian Potato Chip Tasting\n\n11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2024\n\nLion’s Den in Billingsly Student Center\n\nAdmission: free\n\nSponsored by Student Activities\n\nPotato chips are high-demand snacks in Canada because Canada is the world leader when it comes to the potato industry. Chips are popular in Canada because their unique and distinct flavors have become a part of Canadian snack culture. Some popular flavors are ketchup, all-dressed (a mix of ketchup, barbecue, sour cream, onion, and salt and vinegar flavors), lobster, sour cream and bacon, roast chicken, and bulgogi blaze. Come and sample these unusual tastes and determine which one is your favorite.\n\nStudents also will have the opportunity to craft their own custom seasoning blends, drawing inspiration from beloved Canadian tastes like ketchup, poutine, and maple bacon. Mix and match spices to create your perfect chip seasoning and enjoy a fun, flavorful experience with friends.\n\nSouthern Theatre presents Salt-Water Moon\n\n12:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2024\n\nBud Walton Theatre\n\nAdmission: $10 general; $8 seniors and military; $6 faculty and staff; free for MSSU students with students IDs.\n\nSalt-Water Moon is about a young man’s attempt to win back the love of a woman. The time is 1926, the place the front porch of a summer home in the tiny coastal town of Coley’s Point, Newfoundland. Mary Snow, a lovely young girl of 17, studies the evening sky through a telescope. Her reverie is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of Jacob Mercer, the boy with whom she had once fallen in love, and who, a year ago suddenly departed for Toronto without so much as a good-bye. Now Jacob has returned to Coley’s Point, wanting to win back the affection which Mary once felt for him. In his absence, however, Mary has decided to accept the marriage proposal of Jerome McKenzie, the local schoolmaster, who may be on the dull side but is certainly reliable and more than willing to provide for her younger sister, Dot. But when memories of Jacob are revived, and when he feigns leaving for good, she suddenly realizes that he just may be the man for her. Salt-Water Moon was written as a prequel to the one-two punch that established David French as a theatrical heavyweight in the early 1970s, following Leaving Home and Of the Fields, Lately.\n\nSalt-Water Moon premiered in 1985 by Tarragon Theatre in Toronto and has been staged hundreds of times across Canada. The third play of The Mercer Family play cycle, Salt-Water Moon won the 1985 Canadian Authors Association Literary Award for Drama, the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding New Play, A Hollywood Drama-Logue Critics Award, and an ACTRA Award. With its simple setting, cast of two, and universally comprehensible emotions, it has been produced constantly in regional repertory, high school, college, fringe festival, and community theatre productions.\n\nA note from director NaTasha O’Brien-Davies: “Southern Theatre is delighted to participate in the 2024 Canada Semester. We look forward to an opportunity to showcase our talented students, while also celebrating the rich history and culture of our neighbors to the north. Salt-Water Moon is a heartwarming piece with a message that resonates across generations. As the director, I am thrilled to be at the helm of this project. There are a variety of elements involved, but I’m most excited about collaborating with our student performers, local musicians, and the design team, as we strive to bring the playwright’s work from page to stage.”\n\nReading Canada: An Afternoon of Canadian Literature\n\n3 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024\n\nSpiva Library, L-413 (Quiet Room)\n\nZoom link: https://mssu-edu.zoom.us/j/89305540760\n\nAdmission: free\n\nThis afternoon of readings will highlight Canada’s diverse voices and its rich literary history.

When Canadians attend a winter sporting event, there is a significant chance they are heading to a curling match, given the sport’s widespread popularity. Curling is a unique and strategic game that involves sliding granite stones on a sheet of ice toward a target area known as the “house.” Each team consists of four players who take turns delivering the stones and sweeping the ice to influence the stone’s trajectory and speed.\n\nCurling combines elements of precision, strategy, and teamwork, requiring a high level of skill and coordination. The sweeping motion is akin to brushing the ice vigorously, which reduces friction and allows the stone to travel farther and straighter. This aspect of the game adds a dynamic and physically engaging component to the otherwise calm and measured sport.\n\nCanada boasts numerous curling clubs and world-class athletes, consistently achieving success in international competitions. The sport fosters a sense of camaraderie and community, making it a popular social activity during the winter months. Whether played competitively or recreationally, curling is accessible to all ages and skill levels, contributing to its enduring appeal across the country.\n\nOctober\n\nFriends, Neighbours, and Allies: The U.S.-Canada Relationship\n\n9:30 a.m. Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024\n\nPhelps Theater in Billingsly Student Center\n\nZoom link: https://mssu-edu.zoom.us/j/82649898477\n\nAdmission: free\n\nIn 1961, U.S. President John F.
