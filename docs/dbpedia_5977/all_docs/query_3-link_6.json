Shades of \"Capricorn 1.\" At least that was about a fictional future Mars landing, not a historic, factual Moon landing. I can't think of any circumstances where this is going to be appropriate.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 04-12-2024 01:18 PM The film received NASA's permission to film at Kennedy Space Center and to use the agency's logo, which means the space agency had script approval. That doesn't mean everything has to be factual, but it does have to show NASA in a good light.\n\nThe trailer makes it clear that they aren't faking the moon landing â the mission is proceeding âÂ but they are filming a backup to show the world should something go wrong. While clearly fictional, there are also parallels to real-life events.\n\nThe CIA considered putting debris under LC-14 in the event that John Glenn's Mercury-Atlas 6 launch went awry, so the U.S. could blame the tragedy on Cuba. Obviously, that is not the same as trying to get the world to believe we successfully landed on the moon when we didn't, but it is still a subterfuge.\n\nAnd, as pointed out in the article and has been discussed a few times on this forum, NBC and CBS staged simulations to fill in when live video was not available. In essence, they too were faking the moon landing in real time on national television, though they labeled it as such so there was no confusion.\n\n\"Fly Me to the Moon\" is a work of fiction, but has hooks into the real-life efforts to market the moon landings to the American public and the world. Personally, from what we've seen so far, it looks like fun.\n\nMartinAir\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 384\n\nFrom:\n\nRegistered: Oct 2020\n\nposted 04-12-2024 01:42 PM Neil deGrasse Tyson once said that the conspiracy theories are actually paying space agencies a compliment for their unbelievable achievements.

If the Saturn V had blown up, we would have seen it. If the LM had crashed, we would have heard it live. If the TV camera had failed, the TV networks (as you point out) would have shown simulations to support the live audio. If the LM had failed to launch from the Moon, the (real) live Moonwalk TV would already have been shown, and there would have been no way to hide the deaths of the crew.\n\nBy the way, to say that NBC and CBS were \"in essence... faking the Moon landing in real time on national television\" is absurd. There was no confusion because there is no way to confuse an acknowledged simulation for a deliberate fake designed to fool people.\n\nIt is clear from the comments which follow the YouTube trailer that there are a lot of people concerned that this is going to be a bonanza for Moon-hoax supporters. I'm afraid that the age-group most likely to watch this in the cinemas won't be able to distinguish comedy/satire from historical reality. And so it will go on.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 04-12-2024 04:29 PM So we're all supposed to pander to the lowest common denominator because of the fear that we might be bolstering something they already believe?\n\nBesides, show me someone who truly doesn't believe we went to the moon and I'll show you someone who has much larger problems than any movie can ever pose.\n\nquote: Originally posted by Blackarrow:\n\nHollywood encouraging Moon-hoax idiots...\n\nHollywood made the movie to make money.

I can't see any way that the plotlines which are clearly set out in the trailer won't encourage, enthuse and embolden the Moon hoax lobby, and I can't see how that is anything but bad news. \"Capricorn 1\" was \"just a movie\" but it arguably turbocharged a whole industry.\n\nI agree that it won't make any difference to the people who could be flown to Tranquillity Base and still wouldn't believe Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the Moon, but it will make a difference to people who will watch all the stuff in this film about faking a Moonwalk on a movie set and will say to themselves (and to each other, and to others) \"Hmmm... it makes you think. Looks like the government did fake it after all.\"\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 04-13-2024 01:42 PM The little the trailer shows of the fake moon landing shows it as being a farce. The actor-astronauts are fighting, there is a fire and Scarlett Johansson's character is regretting her choice of director. It's not exactly a convincing argument that the moon landing could be faked.\n\nThe trailer also gives no hint if the backup will even be needed. History could play out in the movie exactly as it did in real life, with Apollo 11 being a success.\n\nAs Scott (mercsim) said, it's a movie. It is best to enjoy it (or not) for what is, not what you think others might think of it.\n\ncapoetc\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 2383\n\nFrom: McKinney TX (USA)\n\nRegistered: Aug 2005\n\nposted 04-13-2024 02:01 PM\n\nquote: Originally posted by Robert Pearlman:\n\n...

At the end of the program I save 15 minutes for questions and invariably I'll get a teacher who asks \"Did we really land men on the moon or was it filmed on a sound stage in the middle of nowhere?\" Sometimes I'll pull up LRO photos of the landing sites, they clearly show the LRV and LM descent module and sometimes I'll ask if they're really a teacher with a degree in education.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not thrilled that a major motion picture is showing the moon landings being faked, primarily because so many believe what they're shown.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 04-28-2024 08:16 PM\n\nquote: Originally posted by Spacepsycho:\n\n...a major motion picture is showing the moon landings being faked\n\nBased on the trailer alone, we don't really know if the film shows the moon landing being faked. It only shows them setting up a sound stage in an attempt to do so, but whether they are successful or even go through with it is not shown.\n\nFor all we know, maybe the hoax fails and the real moon landing succeeds. Maybe the punchline of this film is something those who have been debunking the hoax has been saying all along: it would be easier and less expensive for NASA to actually land on the moon than convincingly fake it on Earth given the technology at the time.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 05-09-2024 10:56 AM Movie poster: Robert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 06-20-2024 05:01 PM Final trailer release before the movie hits theaters on July 12: Robert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 07-05-2024 10:29 PM Attended an advance screening of \"Fly Me to the Moon\" tonight. Really enjoyed it!\n\nDon't let what you think this movie is about (based on the trailers) keep you away. I was pleasantly surprised how the movie unfolds.\n\nMore to come, leading up to the film's opening on July 12.\n\nGTBuzz\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 10\n\nFrom: Atlanta, GA, US\n\nRegistered: Apr 2019\n\nposted 07-06-2024 12:14 AM Same here â thought it was an entertaining and well-made film. I was surprised at the level of background detail â Wolfies! With the correct logo, albeit not at the Ramada Inn â that I wouldn't have expected in this kind of movie. Sure, there were a few errors, but someone definitely did their homework on this one. The production design and CGI were so well done that the \"Apollo 11\" 70mm scenes fit in seamlessly.\n\nAnd, of course, there was the Georgia Tech reference, which, along with \"Space Cadet,\" makes two for two in space-themed movies today!\n\nrjurek349\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 1234\n\nFrom: Northwest Indiana\n\nRegistered: Jan 2002\n\nposted 07-09-2024 06:58 AM Was at an advance screening last night, too â and went in skeptical, but came out really enjoying the film. The choice of doing it as a comedy (for obvious reasons which become clear as the film progresses) was brilliant and just loved the look and feel of it. And the inside references, both visual and in dialogue: fantastic.\n\nIn one scene, Johanssonâs character is standing in front of a portrait of Von Braun, which obscures him, but to the screen left, Abe Silversteinâs portrait is boldly framing the scene. Set design and framing like that is no accident. And some real inside baseball.\n\nWill be on Alan Boyleâs fun podcast Fiction Science reviewing the film and talking all things âMarketing the Moon.â But in short: a thumbs up from me, too.\n\nRobert Pearlman\n\nEditor\n\nPosts: 52729\n\nFrom: Houston, TX\n\nRegistered: Nov 1999\n\nposted 07-12-2024 01:09 PM Here in the U.S., it appears that if the movie theaters are running any promos with \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" they are sweepstakes to win a trip to Florida. I have not seen much by way of collectibles, other than some decals and coasters that were unique to a special screening in Los Angeles:\n\nThat said, it appears Vieshow Cinemas in Taiwan has produced a promotional patch. (It appears, based on local movie posters, that in Taiwan, it not elsewhere, the Saturn V has been replaced with a more cartoonish, fictional rocket in the film's logo and on designs such as this.)\n\nrjurek349\n\nMember\n\nPosts: 1234\n\nFrom: Northwest Indiana\n\nRegistered: Jan 2002\n\nposted 07-14-2024 08:03 AM An honor to read this morning in the USA Today interview with the movie's author Rose Gilmore that the advertising/PR story was inspired in part by reading \"Marketing the Moon,\" the book I co-wrote with fellow cS'er David Meerman Scott.\n\nGilroy looked to \"Marketing the Moon,\" a nonfiction book by David Meerman Scott and Richard Jurek, which details how NASA made the moon enticing to the masses through product placement, magazine articles and TV specials.\n\n\"It's about the original ads that were used, and how sci-fi was woven into the minds of the American people\" using genre books and movies, Gilroy says. \"That was instrumental. It was endlessly interesting to learn all the ways they sold\" the Apollo 11 mission."
