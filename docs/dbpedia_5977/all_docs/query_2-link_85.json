        "text": "A new month means a fresh slate of films to choose from on Netflix Netflix –a glorious time indeed. And June, much like other recent months, does not disappoint, featuring a wide array of films that cover all sorts of genres and feature some of Hollywood’s most prominent names. This month features the SVOD debuts of two different recent releases, sequels to legendary historical epic action films, war films shots in a single continuous take, biopics about legendary civil rights figures—and that just scratches the surface. All in all, there’s a plethora of great movies awaiting subscribers.\n\nSo which movies do you absolutely not want to miss? Well, I’ve got a list for you. Below I map out my top ten picks for the best movies added to Netflix so far in June 2024. And at the bottom of the article, you can find a full list of all the new options available this month. I have no doubt that you can find a great new favorite or an oldie just waiting to be revisited in this bunch.\n\nThe 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In June 2024\n\nNote: this list covers all releases leading up to June 3, 2024.\n\nCold Copy (2024)\n\nCold Copy premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in June 2023, receiving praise from critics for its incisive insights into modern journalism. The film became available on VOD in January, but is making its streaming debut on Netflix this month. This delve into the dark side of ambition in the cutthroat world of TV journalism follows eager student Mia Scott (Bel Powley) s she tries to win over her idol, renowned journalist Diane Heger (Tracee Ellis Ross). Directed by Roxine Helberg, Cold Copy showcases Mia's descent into ethical ambiguity as she manipulates the truth to craft a compelling story about her subject, Igor Nowak (Jacob Tremblay). A mix of crime, mystery, and thriller, this compelling film explores themes of corruption and moral compromise.\n\n1917 (2019)\n\nSam Mendes has low-key had one of the most successful careers in modern Hollywood. He’s overseen an incredible mix of genres (from Jarhead to Revolutionary Road to Away We Go), fronted box-office-shattering triumphs (Skyfall and Spectre) and enjoyed award-winning success (American Beauty). But for my money, his absolute best and most exciting feature to date has been 1917, which plunges viewers into the harrowing reality of World War I. The film follows two British soldiers on an impossible mission to deliver a message that could save 1,600 men. Featuring standout performances by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, this single-take feat is a masterclass in tension and realism. With its groundbreaking cinematography by Roger Deakins, 1917 immerses audiences in the chaos and desperation of the trenches, making the perilous journey feel immediate and visceral.\n\nSimón (2023)\n\nWhat started as a short film back in 2018 has become Diego Vicentini’s first fully realized feature film—and is now making its streaming debut with Netflix. This powerful film immerses viewers in the heart-wrenching journey of Simón, a young man caught in the tumult of Venezuelan protests. After being arrested and tortured, Simón flees to Miami as an asylum seeker. Starring Christian McGaffney in the titular fole, this poignant drama explores Simón's struggle with trauma and guilt as he faces an impossible choice: to build a new life in exile or return to his homeland and confront tyranny. The film, which owned a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes back in August 2023, delves into the complexities of forgiveness and self-acceptance.\n\nDetective Pikachu (2019)\n\nRob Letterman has enjoyed a lucrative career as a director of family-friendly entertainment, from Shark Tale to Goosebumps to Monsters vs. Aliens, which combined to earn nearly $1 billion at the worldwide box office. But none of those movies made as much money as Letterman’s biggest hit: Detective Pikachu. Starring Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu alongside Justice Smith, this live action take on the Pokémon universe brings to life a world where humans and the fabled creatures coexist, centering on the unlikely partnership between a young man searching for his missing father and a wise-cracking, coffee-loving Pikachu. This super-fun film blends live-action and CGI to create a vibrant, fantastical world.\n\nBaby Boy (2001)\n\nThere are few directors in the history of Hollywood that went as under-appreciated as John Singleton did during his run. Before his untimely death in 2019 at the age of 51, the visionary directed everything from hard-hitting hood dramas like Boyz n the Hood and Poetic Justice to high-octane action flicks like 2 Fast 2 Furious and Abduction. But the height of his artistic career, without a doubt, had to be the criminally overlooked Baby Boy—a raw, intimate exploration of urban life in South Central Los Angelesn that follows 20-year-old Jody as he navigates the complexities of fatherhood, relationships and finding his place in the world. Starring Tyrese Gibson in a breakout role, alongside Taraji P. Henson and Ving Rhames, Singleton’s keen eye for authentic storytelling shines through in the film's portrayal of Jody's struggle to break free from the cycles of his environment.\n\nIf you’d like some insight into the deeper ideas at play in Baby Boy, check out this breakdown of the film.\n\n300: Rise of an Empire (2014)\n\nZack Snyder’s 300 is an undeniable triumph that, while critically maligned by some at the time by many, has emerged as a timeless blueprint that showcased the director’s incredible visionary prowess. Since, triumphs like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Watchmen and Rebel Moon have captivated millions of moviegoers worldwide. And while Snyder didn’t direct 300’s sequel, Rise of an Empire, you can see how his vision shaped this underrated film. Directed by Noam Murro, this epic actiln film plunges into the brutal and epic naval battles of ancient Greece, following the clash between the Greek general Themistocles and the Persian navy led by the formidable Artemisia. Starring Sullivan Stapleton as Themistocles and Eva Green as Artemisia, Rise of an Empire expands on the world of 300 in delightfully entertaining fashion.\n\nTangerine (2015)\n\nSean Baker is the talk of the town this year, with his latest feature Anora winning the Palme d'Or at the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival. And while other pieces from the director like The Florida Project and Red Rocket have enjoyed success, none of them have had quite the impact that Tangerine had on Hollywood back in 2015. Shot entirely on iPhones, this revolutionary LGBT film follows a day in the life of transgender sex worker Sin-Dee Rella as she discovers her boyfriend and pimp has been unfaithful. Starring Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor in raw, captivating performances, and set against the vibrant backdrop of Los Angeles, Tangerine captures the energy and resilience of people fighting for a better life, offering an unfiltered look at life on the margins.\n\nAli (2001)\n\nThere’s not much more to say about Michael Mann that hasn’t already been said. His films, from Heat to Collateral, from Thief to Miami Vice, from The Insider to Blackhat, have won multitudes of awards and redefined cinema (specifically the crime genre) over and over. But one of his few attempts at the biopic has remained one of his most insightful. Ali chronicles the life of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, from his rise to fame to his struggle against racial injustice and his transformation into a global icon. Featuring a powerhouse performance by Will Smith, the film delves into the personal and professional challenges the famed boxer faced. With a supporting cast that includes Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight, Ali not only showcases the athlete's prowess in the ring but also highlights his impact on civil rights and culture.\n\nThe Lego Movie (2014)\n\nPhil Lord and Christopher Miller’s short-lived directing careers were a heck of a time for fans of hilarious movies that tread a different path. While they’ve produced plenty of great projects, they only director four films: 21 and 22 Jump Street, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and, arguably their most entertaining feat, The Lego Movie. This box-office smash invites audiences into an imaginative world where ordinary LEGO construction worker Emmet discovers he is the key to saving the universe. This animated adventure bursting with creativity and humor features the voices of Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Arnett. The Lego Movie effortlessly balances comedy and heart, delivering a message about creativity and individuality that resonates with viewers of all ages.\n\nOn the Basis of Sex (2018)\n\nMimi Leder has had quite an eclectic career in Hollywood, directing everything from big-budget sci-fi disaster films like Deep Impact to quiet dramas like Pay it Forward to heist films like Thick as Thieves. And while it seemed like her career had stalled back in 2009, she made a comeback in 2018 with On the Basis of Sex, which tells the inspiring true story of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s early career and her fight for gender equality. Starring Felicity Jones as Ginsburg and Armie Hammer as her supportive husband, Martin, the film chronicles Ginsburg’s journey from law school to her landmark case challenging sex-based discrimination. With a script that highlights Ginsburg’s determination and intellect, On the Basis of Sex is a stirring tribute to a legal pioneer whose work laid the groundwork for future generations.\n\nEvery New Movie on Netflix in June 2024"
