        "text": "rsantos92 wrote:\n\nI was very surprised that Corey died in the end. I thought that the mom would have died giving birth to the baby, or when she fell. Because then Corey's family would have to help them out. After, Corey would fall in love with Moreen and they would accidentally have a child.\n\nHis name is Court, Did anyone besides myself notice that the tractor turned to the right after running him over? I mean when Court is about to grab his hat you can barely see that he is heading for a fence, then when his mother runs out its driving away from the fence. Is it just me or does the tractor have a mind of its own? Overall it was a good yet depressing movie and it had a lot of relevance to the book The Member of the Wedding. For instance they both ahd a young southern girl as the protagonist of the book/film. It was kind of gory when it showed Court covered in blood, but I've seen worse. If you looked closely he didn't really have any wounds. He was just covered in blood. I mean didn't go head first into the thing? Yet he had no marks on his face. I think they didn't want to much gore in that scene. Oh well\n\nPersonally, I found this movie to be very similar to The Member of the Wedding. This was not because of the plots being similar but rather because of the main characters and the ending. This was due to the fact that both of the stupid girls were so wound up in their little dream worlds that they both believed that the impossible could happen while everyone else actually lived in reality. Also, both stories ended with the tragic death of one of the main characters. Actually, I thought that falling of the tractor and dying just to get your hat was more stupid than tragic, but that is just my point of view! Overall, I enjoyed watching the movie much more than reading the book.\n\nP.S. The ending of the movie isn't sad, it's just stupid on the account of Court not having enough common sense to turn of the tractor before grabbing his hat.\n\nP.S.S. What happened to the tractor and did the elder sister ever get pregnant?\n\nI thought that the movie was very good. It made you feel what the characters were feeling, and it made you so riled up inside that you just want to burst. Suprisely, my favorite character turns out to be Maureen. Usually I hate characters like her, and I do hate her, ( ) but I thought that she was the most realistic character of all. I also liked the father very much too. If I could, I would just totally rant on about how I hate so many of the characters, but I won't. But honestly, why couldn't the guy have just turned the tractor off, got his hat, and turned the tractor back on? It's not that hard!!\n\nAnd I realize how irrational I am being. Sorry!!\n\nI thought the movie was really good and I liked the main character. I thought it was weird when the guy died because it was really random and mostly stupidity on his part. I thought that it was sad that the sister was so selfish and didn't feel bad for her sister, when really it was more realistic for the kids of the same age to like eachother. Cort (Court/Corey/Pork/??) also gave her signs that he didnt really like her and that he thought she was just a kid.\n\nI thought The Man in the Moon was a good movie. I was sad at the ending though because I felt really bad for both Dani and Maureen because they both lost someone that was speacial to them. I wasn't really sad that the guy died though. I thought his death was really gross though because he was all red from the blood. I was glad that Dani and Maureen got over their disagreement and became close sisters again. I thought Dani and Maureen had a really cool sisterly relationship. I think Dani was similar to Frankie from the Member of the Wedding because both characthers matured and grew up in the end. In Member of the Wedding, Frankie gets over her obsession about the wedding and stops pushing the people around her away. In The Man in the Moon, Dani gets mad at Maureen, but gets over it. She becomes the bigger person and forgives her older sister. She grew up from the beginning of the movie to the end.\n\nThe movie was really surprising. I found it kind of funny how he sees her older sister and falls in love =P. I think they had a good ending in how he dies and then the sisters forgive eachother and are all cool. I think that his death kind was important to the story like John Henry's. I think that because he died, the sisters could relate in a way and it kind of made them closer.\n\nI didn't really feel like the movie had much to do with coming of age. Really its about enduring through hardships when bad things may happen. The characters don't really change in the sense that they become wiser they just become depressed. Also I fealt that the death by tractor was unrealistic because the guy had been on the farm all his life and he would probably be a little smarter with grabbing his hat.\n\nI thought the movie was a little depressing. I can see the resemblance to Member of the Wedding but there are many other stories dealing with teenage girl hardships. I liked the acting jobs and the screenplay. The script was pretty well written. I didn't like the part when the dad comes home and whips Dani. Dani also should have known that he was older and should not have gotten so caught up with him. Also, I was wondering what would happen to Court's (sp.?) family. His mom counted on him to run the farm. They would probably have to leave the property again.\n\nI thought that Reese Witherspoon did an excellent job of portraying the character of Danny in the movie. She was the perfect actress to show what a struggle it is to become an adult. There were so many emotions that her character had throughout the film. Danny was stubborn at first, then very flirtatious. At the end of the film, she was depressed and heartbroken. The first person she believed to have fallen in love with died, which, by the way, was extremely unexpected. Court's death was a huge twist. When I saw him reaching for his hat, I could kind of tell something bad was going to happen. Nevertheless, I never expected him to get run over by a tractor. It was interesting to see Danny's reaction after Court's death compared to her sister's reaction. Danny appeared to be more hurt by the death, but her sister was probably hurting more. Their sadness and compassion for Court ended up bringing them closer together. This wasn't the best movie, but I enjoyed it.\n\nI loved the movie \"The Man in the Moon\". After watching it, I wanted to watch it over and over again. I think the ending was very depressing but it added a certain reality and truth perspective that made it seem so real. The dramatic twist at the ending made the movie be connectable to its audience. A couple days later I was talking to someone about the movie and I was saying how it would have been perfect if he hadn't died. But then she (I totally forgot who I was talking to) brought up the really good point of that maybe if the guy hadn't died, the sisters would have never been the same again. And I totally agree. I mean what would have happened to that bond the sisters had? Maybe he needed to die so the sisters could forgive each other and have that sisterly bond again.\n\nI think this movie connected to the novel, The Member of the Wedding because both the main characters were young teenage girls going through a major change in their life, an I really liked the novel, and absolutely loved the movie.\n\nI really liked the movie Man In the Moon becuase it was a very cute movie with Reese Witherspoon as a 13 year old. I didn't know she went back that far... Although I really like the plot of the story and everything, I didn't really like the acting, I thought it was a little too soppy and corny in some parts. It was pretty depressing in the end. It was almost like worse led to worse led to worse. Over all and besides that point it was a pretty good movie. I'd give it a thumbs up. Mr. Kelso did a good job picking a movie so similar to A Member of the Wedding .\n\nI thought that the movie The man on the moon was a very sad movie. i really did not like the ending where corey had to die. Like everyone else i also think that this book connects to the member of the wedding greatly. Since both of these books are coming of age books they both had main characters that were teenage girls who struggle to make a place for themselves in the real world.\n\nI thought the movie was really sad, but good. I would've probably liked it more if it had a happy ending, and no one had to die. However, if Cout hadn't died Danny might have stayed mad at her sister for a long time. The movie was very similar to The Member of the Wedding because both of the main characters thought they had found someone who would change their life, but in the end it was just an illusion and not what they wanted. For Frankie, she thought her brother and sister-in-law were her group in life, and would live with her when in reality her brother and his wife did not want to live with Frankie at all. For Danny, she thought Court was the love of her life, but he was more interested in Danny's older sister. The Man in the Moon was definitely very memorable.\n\nLast edited by on Mon Oct 02, 2006 5:56 pm; edited 1 time in total\n\ni liked the happy parts of this movie. it was sooo sad. I see how the theme is similar to that of member of the wedding but i think that it could apply to any book about a person growing up not just frankie. I think it is so interesting to see older actors in a movie when they were youing and i think reese witherspoon was amazing but a little too young for court. What a funny name. I do prefer to watch happier movies while im eating popcorn."
