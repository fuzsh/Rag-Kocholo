        "text": "One of the best ways to learn about American culture is to watch movies. By seeing how Americans interact with each other on the big screen, you can learn a lot about what values and beliefs are important to them. You can also get a sense of the different regional cultures within the United States, as well as how generational differences can affect attitudes and beliefs. In addition, watching movies can also be a great way to learn about American history, as many films are set in different periods of time. By watching movies, you can gain a greater understanding of the American experience and learn about the people and events that have shaped this country.\n\nDiscover more ways to learn English from PELA!\n\nHow to Improve English Speaking Skills\n\nClever Techniques to Learn English Fast\n\nFun Music to Learn English Through Songs\n\nHow to Learn English at Home\n\nHow to Speak English Fluently and Naturally\n\nUse PELA’s 3×3 Method to learn English at home!\n\nLearn About American Culture Through Movies\n\nMovies are often said to be a reflection of society, and this is especially true for American films. By watching movies, we can learn a lot about American culture, from the way people dress and speak to the values they hold dear. We can see how Americans view love and relationships, work and success, and even death and grieving. In short, movies offer a window into the American soul. Of course, it is important to remember that not all films accurately reflect reality. Hollywood tends to glamorize and idealize life, so we should take what we see on the big screen with a grain of salt. But even if we don’t learn everything about American culture from watching movies, we can still gain a better understanding of the country and its people by doing so.\n\nTop 10 Movies for Learning About American Culture\n\nThere are so many movies that show different aspects of American culture and history that it is almost impossible to pick just 10 to watch! However, the following movies are, in our opinion, movies that not only teach you something about American history (both past and present) but also touch upon themes and ideals that Americans, in general, find important. Many of these movies portray Americans as either they wish or imagine themselves being or focus on themes that Americans in many ways feel are ‘defining characteristics of what it means to be American.\n\nApollo 13 (1995)\n\nTo see a great example of how Americans see themselves as real-life, everyday heroes, check out the movie Apollo 13. Set in 1970, it tells the true story of the Apollo 13 mission to the moon that almost ended in disaster after there was an explosion on the spacecraft. The three astronauts, alone in space and losing air quickly, must work together and with the people back on Earth or die before making it back home. This movie gives you insight into Americans’ views about space exploration, but its main theme is the value of never giving up no matter the odds of success. Ideas of resourcefulness and ‘can-do-ism’ are at the heart of this film; they are common ideals that many Americans hold about themselves and our country. If you enjoy this film and want to watch a similar one, then The Martian is a great choice!\n\nDances With Wolves (1990)\n\nThis movie tells the fictional story of an American soldier living in the Old West (set around the year 1865) near a Native American tribe. Over the course of the movie, his understanding and love of Native American culture grows, but he finds himself in a conflict between the Native Americans and other American soldiers. This movie shows a little bit of the difficulties Native Americans had when white people started moving west and settling in lands that the Native Americans considered their own. It also shows how one man comes to respect, love, and find value in a foreign culture that he once thought impossible to understand. The main character discovers the misconceptions he had about Native Americans and comes to understand some negative aspects of his own culture. This is a common theme in many movies, but Dances With Wolves portrays a particularly American relationship between the white American settlers and the Native Americans they meet as they settle in the American West.\n\nDo The Right Thing (1989)\n\nOf all the movies on this list, Do The Right Thing is probably the most unusual, controversial, and topical. It is the fictional story of the lives of various lower-class people living on a street in New York City. On the street people of different ethnicities live and work, but not always peacefully or friendly. Over the span of one day, tensions build between the Black, Italian, Hispanic, and Asian people on the street, a conflict that is not helped by the presence of white police officers who are there to try and control the actions of the lower-class residents.\n\nThis movie explores issues of racism, nationalism, police brutality, and class. The various characters in the movie are symbolic representations of various cultural, class, and racial groups in America. Thus, their interactions in the movies are presented as a metaphor for how these various communities interact, often in very negative ways, with each other in American society.\n\nField of Dreams (1989)\n\nSet in small-town, rural America, Field of Dreams follows a man who suddenly starts to hear a voice telling him, “If you build it, he will come”. Thus begins a journey trying to discover what he should build in his cornfield and who will come. This movie explores themes of what it means to be a father in white American culture, how relationships between parents and children can have unresolved issues, and the idea of reaching the end of life having regretted some past choices. In this movie, you will see how many Americans view fathers and their role in their children’s lives. You will also get an idea of just how much baseball is a part of American culture. There are elements of ‘magical realism’ in this movie, which means that while the movie is set in the real world, strange, magical things happen, too.\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nA classic film that has captivated audiences for generations is It’s a Wonderful Life. The story follows George Bailey, a man who is facing tough times and is on the brink of suicide. However, he is visited by an angel who shows him what life would be like if he had never been born. Through this experience, George learns to appreciate his life and the people in it. Part of the movie centers around the conflict between a greedy rich man and a selfless poor man—a common theme in American media. In a way, the film reflects some of the best aspects of American culture. It highlights the importance of family, friendship, and community. It also instills a sense of hope and optimism, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, things can eventually get better. As such, It’s a Wonderful Life is more than just a feel-good movie – it’s a film that speaks to the very core of what it means to be American.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West (1968)\n\nSergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in the West is widely considered to be one of the greatest Westerns ever made. The film tells the story of a bandit named Harmonica who seeks revenge on the ruthless killer who murdered his family. Along the way, he forms an unlikely alliance with another bandit named Cheyenne. As their journey unfolds, the two men come to learn that they have more in common than they initially realized. One of the other main characters is a ruthless gunfighter who stops at nothing to achieve his goals. Through the course of the film, he murders, manipulates, and terrorizes those around him, all in the name of power and money.\n\nThe movie’s depiction of the American West of the 1880s as a lawless place where violence and greed reign supreme is a stark contrast to the romanticized version that is often presented in popular culture. By showing the dark side of the American dream, Once Upon a Time in the West offers a prophetic warning about the dangers of unchecked ambition.\n\nPhiladelphia (1993)\n\nThe movie Philadelphia is set in the city of the same name and follows the story of Andrew Beckett, a lawyer who is fired from his prestigious firm after his colleagues discover he has AIDS. Beckett decides to take legal action against his former employers and enlists the help of Joe Miller, a homophobic lawyer who initially refuses to take on the case. However, over the course of the trial, Miller comes to understand the injustices faced by Beckett and other members of the LGBTQ community, and eventually emerges as a champion for their rights.\n\nThe film was controversial when it was first released in 1993, but today it is widely considered to be one of the most important films about AIDS and homosexuality in America. It helped to break down many of the stereotypes and misconceptions about people with AIDS, and also shed light on the discrimination that members of the LGBTQ community regularly face. In many ways, Philadelphia remains an important cultural touchstone for Americans, providing a valuable representation of both the progress that has been made in accepting people with AIDS and LGBTQ people, as well as the challenges that still need to be addressed.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1962)\n\nAmerican culture is complex and multi-faceted, but one film that offers some insights into the national character is To Kill a Mockingbird. The film tells the story of a young girl named Scout living in the town of Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930s. The town is plagued by racism and prejudice, but Scout is shielded from the worst of it by her father, Atticus Finch. Atticus is a lawyer who has been appointed to defend a black man accused of rape, and Scout gradually comes to understand the importance of fairness and justice. As she witnesses her father’s brave stand against bigotry, Scout learns that America can be a great nation, but only if its citizens are willing to stand up for what is right. In this way, To Kill a Mockingbird offers a hopeful vision of American culture, even in the face of adversity.\n\nWest Side Story (1961 & 2021)\n\nThe movie West Side Story is set in New York City in the late 1950s and tells the story of two rival gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The Sharks are a gang of Puerto Rican immigrants, while the Jets are a gang of white American youths. The two gangs are constantly feuding, and the movie culminates in a tragic showdown between them. In addition to its compelling story, West Side Story provides a fascinating glimpse into American culture in the 1950s.\n\nAt a time when ethnic tensions were running high, the movie offered a glimpse of hope that people from different backgrounds could come together and live in peace. This message was especially relevant in New York City, which was home to large numbers of immigrants from all over the world. While West Side Story is ultimately a tragedy, it remains an iconic representation of America’s melting pot culture. However, West Side Story is also a hopeful story about the possibility of transcending the hatred and intolerance that too often plagues our society.\n\nLearn English by Immersing Yourself in American Culture\n\nWhile watching movies is a great way to learn about American culture, nothing compares to actually coming to the United States to study English abroad!
