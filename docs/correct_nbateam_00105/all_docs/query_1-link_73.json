        "text": "In an upcoming book, George Karl makes a number of critical comments about Carmelo Anthony, Kenyon Martin and other players he coached during a long NBA career. Anthony didn’t have much to say about that until after his Knicks played on Thursday, but Martin took to Twitter hours earlier and tore into Karl for being, among other things, “selfish” and “cowardly.”\n\n“Carmelo was a true conundrum for me in the six years I had him,” Karl wrote in a book, “Furious George,” set for release in January, excerpts of which were published Thursday by the New York Post. “He was the best offensive player I ever coached. He was also a user of people, addicted to the spotlight and very unhappy when he had to share it.”\n\n“Kenyon and Carmelo carried two big burdens: all that money and no father to show them how to act like a man,” Karl wrote elsewhere in the book. Per the Post, he also described the trio of Anthony, Martin and J.R. Smith as “AAU babies,’’ saying they were like “the spoiled brats you see in junior golf and junior tennis.’’\n\nKarl coached Anthony, Martin and Smith during a nine-season stint with the Nuggets, part of a career that spanned from 1984 to April of this year, when he was fired by the Kings. While Anthony said he hopes Karl “finds happiness in what he’s doing” after the Knicks game on Thursday when asked for a reaction to Karl’s comments, Martin posted a number of tweets attacking the 64-year-old, for whom he played from 2005 to 2011.\n\nMartin also took issue with Karl “talking [a]bout Melo didn’t like defense,” saying, “Hell he never coached defense. How does that work.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his book, Karl wrote of Anthony, “He really lit my fuse with his low demand of himself on defense. He had no commitment to the hard, dirty work of stopping the other guy. My ideal — probably every coach’s ideal — is when your best player is also your leader.\n\n“But since Carmelo only played hard on one side of the ball, he made it plain he couldn’t lead the Nuggets, even though he said he wanted to. Coaching him meant working around his defense and compensating for his attitude.”\n\nFollowing New York’s 106-95 win over the Magic, Anthony took the high road, telling reporters (via ESPN’s Ian Begley), “I just hope [Karl] finds happiness in whatever he’s doing.” He added, “I never knew I was a — what’s the word? — conundrum,” and he indicated that he was pleased some former teammates had stuck up for him.\n\nKarl also had this to say about Anthony, who played for him from 2005 to February 2011, when he was traded to the Knicks. “I want as much effort on defense — maybe more — as on offense,” Karl wrote. “That was never going to happen with Melo, whose amazing ability to score with the ball made him a star but didn’t make him a winner. Which I pointed out to him. Which he didn’t like.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarl offered comment on that trade, which sent Anthony and Chauncey Billups to New York for a package that included Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Timofey Mozgov, a 2014 first-round pick and rights to swap picks in 2016. “We won this trade, definitely,’’ Karl wrote, calling it “a sweet release for the coach and the team, like popping a blister.’’\n\nOne of those players, Chandler, posted a tweet about Karl’s comments, as did another of his former players, Reggie Evans.\n\nSmith was also singled out for criticism by Karl, who used the word “posse,” that recently earned criticism for Phil Jackson from LeBron James and Jay-Z, among others. Karl wrote that the guard had “a huge sense of entitlement, a distracting posse, his eye always on the next contract and some really unbelievable shot selection.” That likely was the cause of an otherwise cryptic tweet by Smith on Thursday.\n\n“Carmelo for us has been great,” said Anthony’s current coach with the Knicks, Jeff Hornacek (via ESPN). “Whatever happened in the past, that guys talk about, I know none of that. All I can go by is what I’ve seen out of Carmelo here. He’s done everything we’ve asked, and what the coaches want him to do. He’s been a great leader for our team. So that’s it simply for me.”"
