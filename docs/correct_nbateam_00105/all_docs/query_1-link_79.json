        "text": "In recent years, the Denver Nuggets have established themselves as a consistent playoff team in the NBA. This achievement can be attributed to the stellar performances of superstar Nikola Jokic, skilled guard Jamal Murray, and the collective efforts of the entire roster.\n\nA significant milestone in their journey came when the Nuggets secured the first-ever NBA Finals appearance in franchise history. After three previous attempts, the 2022-23 Nuggets roster finally overcame the formidable Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, showcasing their determination and resilience.\n\nThis is a great time to honor and recognize the remarkable talents of some of the finest former players who once graced the Denver Nuggets' roster. Additionally, we will acknowledge a few current players deserving of mention on this esteemed list.\n\nDenver Nuggets Roster History\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have put together some great teams in their history. This includes the 2007-08 roster that saw a veteran Allen Iverson team up with Carmelo Anthony. J.R. Smith, Marcus Camby, and Kenyon Martin rounded out that starting five.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Nuggets were led by Bobby Jones and David Thompson before Alex English became the team’s star in the 1980s.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets roster of 2022-23 will go down as one of the best in team history, and it's the first group of players to make the NBA Finals since the ABA merger in 1976. Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic lead the way, supported by a talented cast, and Denver is now a consistent force in the NBA’s Western Conference.\n\nDenver Nuggets Hall of Fame Players\n\nAlex English is the most famous Denver Nuggets Hall of Famer and one of the greatest Nuggets of all time. The former Nuggets small forward was the star of the show throughout the 1980s, earning eight straight NBA All-Star Game appearances as a member of the team and winning the NBA scoring championship in 1982-83.\n\nThere is also Dan Issel, who played for Denver for nine years and is one of the longest-tenured Nuggets players in the Hall of Fame. He had been a six-time All-Star in the ABA, and after the 1976 merger earned a trip to the 1977 NBA All-Star Game.\n\nEnglish and Issel are joined in the Hall of Fame by Dikembe Mutombo and David Thompson, as well as a group of star players who had stints in Denver. That group includes Allen Iverson, George McGinnis and Bobby Jones.\n\nFamous Nuggets Players\n\nIt would be fair to say that two-time MVP Nikola Jokic is now one of the most famous Nuggets players of all time. He is the only player in franchise history to win the MVP award, doing so in back-to-back years.\n\nWith his roots in Serbia, Jokic has a tremendous European following, making him a very popular figure in recent Nuggets history. Carmelo Anthony and Alex English also come to mind, as well as the likes of Marcus Camby and David Thompson.\n\nJamal Murray’s performance as part of the current Denver Nuggets roster also puts him in the conversation. When both he and Jokic are on the floor together, they are one of the most exciting duos in the NBA today.\n\nRanking the Top 10 Greatest Denver Nuggets Players of all time\n\nMarcus Camby\n\nPosition: Center\n\nYears with Nuggets: 2002 to 2008\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 10.1 Points, 11.1 Rebounds, 2.5 Assists, 3.0 Blocks\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA Defensive Player of the Year (2006-07), NBA All-Defensive First Team (2006-07, 2007-08), NBA Blocks Leader (2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08)\n\nSelected as the second overall pick by the Toronto Raptors at the 1996 NBA Draft, Marcus Camby joined the Denver Nuggets in 2002. He had begun his professional career with the Raptors and would later have a stint with the New York Knicks.\n\nDuring his tenure with the Nuggets, Camby's influence grew significantly. His playing time increased each year, and he became a dominant force on the defensive end. Camby effortlessly blocked shots, leading the NBA in blocks for three consecutive seasons from 2005-06 to 2007-08.\n\nHis outstanding performance in the 2006-07 season earned him the prestigious NBA Defensive Player of the Year award. With an average of 11.7 rebounds and 3.3 blocks per game, Camby showcased his exceptional defensive skills in contributing to the team's success.\n\nCamby is one of just two players in franchise history with over 1,000 blocks, and the former Nuggets center is one of the best defensive players the team has ever seen.\n\nBobby Jones\n\nPosition: Power Forward\n\nYears with Nuggets: 1974 to 1978\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 14.8 Points, 8.6 Rebounds, 3.5 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All Star Game (1977, 1978), NBA All-Defensive First Team (1976-77, 1977-78)\n\nHead coach Larry Brown had coached the ABA’s Carolina Cougars before taking the Denver Nuggets job in 1974. In 1973, the Cougars had drafted Bobby Jones out of the University of North Carolina as a junior, but Jones had returned to college. When Brown came to Denver, he was adamant about wanting Jones, so the Nuggets secured his ABA rights and then outbid the NBA’s Houston Rockets for his services, and Jones became a member of the ABA Nuggets.\n\nAs a rookie, Jones contributed to the team’s 1974-75 success story, which saw the Nuggets go 65-19 in their second-to-last ABA season before the 1976 NBA merger. Playing alongside David Thompson and Dan Issel the following season, Jones helped Denver win the ABA’s final regular-season title at 60-24.\n\nHe made a smooth transition to the NBA with the Nuggets, earning a place in the very first post-merger All-Star Game as well as NBA All-Defensive First Team honors. He was eventually traded to the Philadelphia 76ers amid concerns about his health -- a deal that saw George McGinnis come to Denver.\n\nIn retrospect, that might have been a mistake. McGinnis only lasted a couple of years in Denver, while Jones played for eight years in Philly and won a championship with the Sixers in 1983.\n\nJamal Murray\n\nPosition: Point Guard\n\nYears with Nuggets: 2016 to present\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 16.9 Points, 3.7 Rebounds, 4.2 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All-Rookie Second Team (2016-17)\n\nJamal Murray seems to have been on the verge of becoming one of the league's All-Stars for quite some time now, but what really stands out about his game are his exceptional performances in the postseason.\n\nMurray has been with Denver since the Nuggets drafted him seventh overall back in 2016, and he has developed year-by-year as a talent in the NBA. Had he not been hampered by injuries almost every season, he would likely get far more recognition than he currently does. Murray failed to play at least 60 games in both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 regular seasons, and he missed the entire 2021-22 campaign with a torn ACL.\n\nWhen the Nuggets’ point guard is healthy and gets hot on the floor, Murray is as fascinating as any Nuggets player the team has ever seen. He can take over a playoff game entirely and began earning his great postseason reputation during the NBA bubble in 2020.\n\nFast forward to the 2023 playoffs, and Murray has once again come through in the clutch for the Nuggets, helping lead them to the first NBA Finals in franchise history. He battled back from a long-term injury to become a key member of the team in 2022-23, and his ability to take over a game in the playoffs has resurfaced once again.\n\nFat Lever\n\nPosition: Point Guard\n\nYears with Nuggets: 1984 to 1990\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 17.0 Points, 7.6 Rebounds, 7.5 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All Star Game (1988, 1990), All-NBA Second Team (1986-87)\n\nFat Lever earned a reputation as one of the league's most enticing point guards over a span of six seasons with the Denver Nuggets. Averaging 17 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.5 assists, and 2.5 steals per game, he made a real impact on the court in Denver.\n\nThanks to his exceptionally quick hands, Lever holds the distinguished title of being the franchise's all-time leader in steals with an astonishing 1,167 steals to his name.\n\nHe also managed to secure the team’s No. 2 spot in career assists with an impressive 3,566. In terms of scoring, Lever ranks eighth, boasting a total of 8,081 points during his career with the Nuggets. Lever's rebounding ability for a point guard was quite something. Despite being just 6-foot-3, his activity and movement often enabled him to lead the team in rebounding, which earned him the 10th spot in the franchise's record books with a commendable 3,621 career rebounds.\n\nDan Issel\n\nPosition: Center\n\nYears with Nuggets: 1975 to 1985\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 20.4 Points, 7.9 Rebounds, 2.5 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All Star Game (1977), ABA All Star Game (1976), All-ABA Second Team (1975-76)\n\nDan Issel, known as \"The Horse,\" made a name for himself as a star player in the ABA. He began his career with the Kentucky Colonels after showcasing his exceptional offensive skills as a center at the University of Kentucky, where he still holds the career scoring record.\n\nAlthough he was drafted by the NBA's Detroit Pistons, Issel chose to play in the ABA and was selected as the first overall pick by the Kentucky Colonels. He played a vital role in helping the Colonels secure the ABA championship in 1975 before making his way to the Denver Nuggets.\n\nDuring his nine seasons with the Nuggets, Issel maintained an impressive scoring average of over 20 points per game. He also held the record for the franchise's all-time rebounding leader until it was surpassed by Nikola Jokic in recent years.\n\nIssel earned a strong reputation among NBA fans for his great work ethic, durability, and fierce offensive skills -- making him a respected figure in the world of basketball.\n\nDikembe Mutombo\n\nPosition: Center\n\nYears with Nuggets: 1991 to 1996\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 12.9 Points, 12.3 Rebounds, 1.7 Assists, 3.8 blocks\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All-Star Game (1992, 1995, 1996), NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1994-95), NBA Blocks Leader (1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96)\n\nDikembe Mutombo attended Georgetown University and was hardly able to speak any English at the time of his arrival there. Born and raised in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mutombo had plans to be a doctor but was recruited by the Hoyas instead.\n\nFollowing Mutombo’s successful college career, the Nuggets selected him as the fourth overall pick in the 1991 NBA Draft. The team was in desperate need of a defensive shot-blocker and interior presence, having been abysmal defensively the previous season.\n\nHis iconic finger-wagging gesture after blocking opponents' shots made Mutombo a fan favorite in the early 1990s. His shot-blocking ability was outstanding, and he immediately filled a void for the Nuggets franchise. He eventually set a team record with 1,486 career blocks -- a record that still stands today.\n\nMutombo quickly established himself as one of the league's most dominant defensive players. His exceptional performance earned him the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1994-95, thanks to his impressive averages of 11.0 points, 11.8 rebounds, and a career-high 4.5 blocks per game. During his time with the Denver Nuggets, Mutombo led the NBA in blocks for three consecutive seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, a contract dispute arose in 1996, when Mutombo sought a long-term deal that the Nuggets were not willing to offer. As a result, he left the team. Former general manager Bernie Bickerstaff later acknowledged that allowing the talented center to leave was the biggest mistake of his tenure with the Nuggets.\n\nCarmelo Anthony\n\nPosition: Small Forward\n\nYears with Nuggets: 2003 to 2011\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 24.8 Points, 6.3 Rebounds, 3.1 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All-Star Game (2007, 2008, 2010, 2011), All-NBA Second Team (2009-10), All-Rookie First Team (2003-04)\n\nCarmelo Anthony was selected by the Denver Nuggets with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. He was a part of one of the most talented draft classes in recent memory with LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also taken in the top five.\n\nMelo played in all 82 games in his rookie year and hit the ground running as the second-youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points in a game, trailing only Kobe Bryant.\n\nHis career with Denver grew year by year, and by 2007 he received his first NBA All-Star recognition, something he would achieve another three times with the franchise. Carmelo transformed the trajectory of the Nuggets, and by 2008 he was surrounded by veteran talent as Denver was picking up national attention.\n\nAnthony averaged over 20 points per game in all eight of his seasons with the Nuggets, making four All-Star Game appearances and being named to four All-NBA teams. Denver had a great star on its roster, and his decision to request a trade to the New York Knicks caused a lot of pain for the Nuggets and their fan base.\n\nDespite the fact that he moved on, Carmelo gave Denver eight great years and some of the best basketball in its history. He is one of the most gifted Nuggets players of all time and boasts some of the best scoring stats in a Denver jersey.\n\nDavid Thompson\n\nPosition: Shooting Guard\n\nYears with Nuggets: 1975 to 1982\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 23.7 Points, 3.9 Rebounds, 3.4 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All-Star Game (1977, 1978, 1979), NBA All-Star Game MVP (1979), All-NBA First Team (1976-77, 1977-78), ABA All-Star Game (1976), ABA All-Star Game MVP (1976), ABA Rookie of the Year (1975-76), ABA All-Rookie First Team (1975-76), ABA All-Time Team (1997)\n\nDavid Thompson is the best guard to ever play for the Denver Nuggets and was nicknamed “Skywalker” for his surreal dunking ability.\n\nThompson was a crucial member of the Nuggets organization in the ABA prior to the league merger, and he led the team in scoring when they reached the 1976 ABA Finals. Hoping to keep his team alive in that championship series vs. the New York Nets, Thompson scored 42 points in Game 6. Although the Nuggets fell short, it was not for a lack of Thompson’s contribution.\n\nAfter the merger, the Nuggets shooting guard only got better, and he came within inches of winning the NBA scoring title in 1977-78. He averaged a career-high 27.2 points that season, tying him with scoring champion George Gervin. Thompson only missed out by .01 percent after scoring 73 points in the final game of the season, which was nearly enough to claim the leading-scorer honor.\n\nThompson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame after a prolific NBA career. He is recognized for his vertical ability, magnificent shooting touch, and speed on the court.\n\nConsidered one of the Nuggets’ best players and one of the most talented to ever grace the franchise, Thompson’s stats speak for themselves because he was one of the best scorers ever to play for the team.\n\nAlex English\n\nPosition: Small Forward\n\nYears with Nuggets: 1980 to 1990\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 25.9 Points, 5.6 Rebounds, 4.4 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA All-Star Game (1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989), NBA Scoring Champion (1982-83), All-NBA Second Team (1981-82, 1982-83, 1985-86)\n\nThe trade that brought Alex English to Denver would go down as one of the greatest trades in franchise history. Midway through the 1980 season, Denver shook up the roster by trading an aging George McGinnis for a young Alex English, who would turn into a star with the Nuggets.\n\nEnglish averaged 23.8 points in his first full season with the Nuggets and one year later earned his first All-Star Game appearance. As it turned out, that appearance was the first of eight straight, as the Nuggets forward made the All-Star team in each season from 1982 to 1989.\n\nHe ended the 1982-83 season as the NBA’s scoring champion with 28.4 points per game and would later break that career-high with 29.8 points per game during an outstanding 1985-86 season.\n\nEnglish really found a home with the Denver Nuggets and was beloved by the fans. He is the only player in franchise history to score over 20,000 points and is the Nuggets’ all-time leading scorer as a result. He also holds team records for games played, field goals made, and offensive rebounds.\n\nHad English not been injured in 1985, the Nuggets might have been poised to take down the Los Angeles Lakers, to whom they eventually lost a five-game Western Conference Finals.\n\nA proud member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, English is one of the best Nuggets players of all time and one of the franchise’s most notable icons.\n\nNikola Jokic\n\nPosition: Center\n\nYears with Nuggets: 2014 to present\n\nCareer Per-Game Stats with Nuggets: 20.2 Points, 10.5 Rebounds, 6.6 Assists\n\nAwards with Nuggets: NBA MVP (2020-21, 2021-22), NBA All-Star Game (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023), NBA Western Conference Finals MVP (2023), All-NBA First Team (2018-19, 2020-21, 2021-22), NBA All-Rookie First Team (2015-16)\n\nThe Denver Nuggets uncovered an unlikely star when they selected Nikola Jokic with the 41st pick in the 2014 NBA Draft. His selection was now famously flashed across the screen during a Taco Bell commercial, and he has since gone on to become the lowest-picked NBA MVP in league history.\n\nJokic is the only player in Nuggets history to be named the MVP of the league, and he did so in back-to-back seasons in 2020-21 and 2021-22. He is now a five time All-Star -- having made his first appearance in 2019 and every year since -- and has become one of the NBA’s brightest talents.\n\nWhen Denver took a chance in drafting him, not many expected things to turn out the way they have. Jokic is one of the most gifted passing big men, if not the best, that the NBA has ever seen, and he has the ability to do just about anything on the court. He has a great shooting stroke, he can knock down threes, he can pick out open teammates, and he dominates in rebounding.\n\nIt’s not often you find a guy in the second round of the NBA draft who possesses all of those skills, but Jokic has become one of the greatest success stories of all time. Perhaps the best thing about his story is how humble he is. He doesn’t brag or talk about his own accomplishments -- he just focuses on the team, and that’s one of the reasons that he is already considered the greatest player in Denver Nuggets history.\n\nParameters for Ranking\n\nThe ranking of these all-time great Denver Nuggets players takes into account their remarkable achievements while playing for the team, both as individuals and as contributors in their respective eras. The assessment considers various factors, including notable accolades, such as Nikola Jokic's two MVP awards, and the long-term impact a player had on the franchise's future, such as Carmelo Anthony's arrival in the early 2000s.\n\nBet on NBA odds at Betway\n\nFind season-long NBA odds on Betway sportsbook.
