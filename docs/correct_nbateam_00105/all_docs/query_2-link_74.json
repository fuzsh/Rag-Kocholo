        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers made a big trade in the wee hours of Tuesday morning to send James Harden to the Los Angeles Clippers for a package of expiring contracts and a slew of draft picks. The deal ends the Harden saga in Philadelphia that began back in June.\n\nAlong with Harden, the Sixers sent PJ Tucker and Filip Petrusev to the Clippers in exchange for Marcus Morris Sr., Nic Batum, Robert Covington, KJ Martin, and a slew of draft picks.\n\nMartin is the son of former NBA All-Star Kenyon Martin. The elder Martin was on an episode of “Gil’s Arena” and he was a bit emotional about his son being sent across the country to the Sixers in the deal:\n\nIt’s stuff like this that people don’t necessarily think about when it comes to a big trade in the NBA. It can be an emotional time for almost everybody involved when a big move like this happens.\n\nAs for the younger Martin, KJ should be able to get an opportunity to thrive under coach Nick Nurse in Philadelphia so it is a good thing for him."
