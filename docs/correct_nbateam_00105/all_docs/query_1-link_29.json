        "text": "A number of George Karl’s former players aren’t very happy about his upcoming book. The retired NBA coach, who is behind only Don Nelson, Lenny Wilkens, Jerry Sloan and Pat Riley in career wins, has a book coming out next month titled, Furious George: My Forty Years Surviving NBA Divas, Clueless GMs, and Poor Shot Selection. As you might expect from the title alone, Karl didn’t exactly hold back when it came to talking about his time in the NBA, which he spent with the Seattle SuperSonics, Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets and Sacramento Kings from 1992 until 2016.\n\nBased on an advanced copy received from the New York Post, Karl calls current New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony a “true conundrum” because he was “a user of people, addicted to the spotlight and very unhappy when he had to share it.” However, while there’s a lot more where that came from, Karl found himself the talk of social media on Thursday due to one passage in particular: “Kenyon and Carmelo carried two big burdens,” Karl writes. “All that money and no father to show them how to act like a man.”\n\nOnce Martin caught wind of what Karl had to say, he responded in a series of tweets:\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nMartin wasn’t alone, either. While Anthony said there’s “no way” he’d discuss what Karl wrote, Al Harrington, J.R. Smith and Reggie Evans all weighed in on the subject.\n\nTrending"
