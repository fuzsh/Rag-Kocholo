        "text": "Kenyon Martin says the Nets never offered him a contract in the summer of 2004 before trading him to the Nuggets.\n\nThe Nets and Nuggets did a sign-and-trade involving Martin. Martin was sent to Denver in exchange for three future first round draft picks.\n\nMartin signed a six-year, $82.3 million contract with the Nuggets after the sign-and-trade was completed.\n\n“Yeah it wasn’t up to me, man,” Martin told our own Brandon ‘Scoop B’ Robinson on Scoop B radio. “They didn’t offer me a contract and that is what people don’t know. Like those people didn’t offer me a contract, you know what I’m saying? They didn’t even call me to offer me a contract. So, I waited around and I waited around and they never called. I had to do what was best for me and my family.”\n\nMartin averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds in 283 games with the Nets and played in two NBA Finals. In 51 playoff games with the Nets, he averaged 18.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 1.3 steals per game.\n\nMartin played seven seasons in Denver before signing a free agent deal with the Clippers in 2011. The former No. 1 overall pick made stops in Milwaukee and New York before retiring from the NBA in 2015.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who plays in the BIG3 league now, has career averages of 12.3 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 757 games."
