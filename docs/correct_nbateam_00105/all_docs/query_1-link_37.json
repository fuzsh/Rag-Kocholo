        "text": "While Nuggets forward Kenyon Martin awaits test results that will determine when — or if — he can return to the court this season, the Nuggets remain optimistic that their current roster is championship-worthy.\n\n“Of course,” forward Carmelo Anthony said. “We have a similar team that we had last year with a couple of big pieces that we picked up in the offseason that will help us out a lot. We had a chance to make some moves before the trade deadline, but it didn’t work out, or whatever the case may be or excuse may be, we just didn’t do it.”\n\nAny thoughts of a deep playoff run will take a big hit if Martin is not able to play the rest of the season. Martin will not play tonight and missed Friday’s game against Indiana with what the team is calling left knee tendinitis.\n\nHe had an MRI on Friday on a knee that had become just too painful for him to play on.\n\n“If they tell me that it’s something more serious than I think it is and I’ve got to get surgery, then I’ll have to do that,” Martin said. “But if they say I can rest and it will heal and I can play, then I’m going to do that.\n\n“I’m not speculating anything. I’m not getting too up, too down about it. Of course I want to play; that’s the frustrating thing about it. I never liked sitting out. I want to be out on the court with these guys. There’s nothing like seeing the guys out there struggling and I can’t help. That eats at me more than anything.”\n\nThe Nuggets have options if they want to get a big man to add depth for the stretch run.\n\nBecause they carry the NBA-mandated minimum 13 players on the roster, they have two spots to work with to add another post player. Out on the market are players such as Mikki Moore, Mark Blount and Jake Vos-kuhl. There are NBA Development League options as well.\n\nIf Martin can’t play the rest of the season, he vowed to remain an active part of the team. He is the Nuggets’ defensive leader, and the team has fallen apart in that area at times when he has been out of the lineup.\n\n“If I’m not playing, I’m not sitting in the locker room, just being on the bench, just helping guys,” Martin said. “Talking through it with (Chris Andersen), Nene, Chauncey (Billups), Melo. If I see something, just going to those guys or going to the coaches, whatever the case may be, putting my opinion in and helping them. If I’m not playing I’m going to be on the bench.\n\n“Hopefully it’s not something that’s going to be where I can’t play. I’m looking forward to getting back on the court, whenever it’s going to be.”\n\nMeanwhile, Nuggets coach George Karl has gained confidence in the reserves when the regulars are out of the lineup.\n\n“I think, for the most part, we’re OK,” Karl said. “We might run into a matchup in the playoffs where we’re going to have to play a guy that maybe hasn’t played a lot of minutes during the year. I think we’re ready to do that even though we may not have practiced it enough in the games in the regular season.”\n\nChris Dempsey: 303-954-1279 or cdempsey@denverpost.com\n\nPortland at Denver\n\n8:30 p.m. tonight, ESPN/ALT, KCKK 1510 AM\n\nSpotlight on Nicolas Batum: With solid all-around play recently, the second-year forward is making his mark in Portland. He swiped a starting spot from veteran Martell Webster and is averaging 19.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in his last three games.\n\nNuggets: Guard Ty Lawson (shoulder) is out for the game. . . . A Nuggets win tonight would give them a 2-1 lead in the season series and make them 9-4 this season in games played against Northwest Division foes. . . . Joey Graham is expected to start in place of injured forward Kenyon Martin.\n\nBlazers: Old friend Marcus Camby returns to Denver again, this time as a member of the Trail Blazers. Camby was traded to Portland last month and is averaging 3.3 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots in seven games.\n\nChris Dempsey, The Denver Post"
