        "text": "We spoke to K-Mart, and he says he’s far from the racist he’s being depicted as, and wants to apologize to Lin for the comment he said was a joke, which was taken totally wrong. As for the subject of Lin’s polarizing new look, Kenyon still had to keep it real, even while he was eating a little crow. “Is it still funny that he has dreadlocks? Yes.”\n\nLin responded to Martin’s video with a comment of his own, saying he was grateful for the former All-Star’s thoughts. “Its all good you don’t have to like my hair and are entitled to your opinion. Actually i legit grateful you sharing it tbh,” Lin wrote on Instagram. “At the end of the day i appreciate that i have dreads and you have Chinese tattoos bc i think its a sign of respect. And i think as minorities, the more we appreciate each others cultures, the more we influence mainstream society. Thanks for everything you did for the nets and hoops…had your poster up on my wall growin up.”\n\nThen, Martin posted a video on his Instagram talking out against Lin and his hairstyle, while bringing the Nets organization into it. He captioned the post, “I’m confused, puzzled, in shock, disappointed in his teammates and the Nets as an organization for allowing this foolishness!!!"
