        "text": "Kenyon Martin\n\nBirthdate: December 30, 1977\n\nBirthplace: Saginaw, Michigan\n\nHigh School: Bryan Adams (Dallas, Texas)\n\nCollege: University of Cincinnati (2000)\n\nYear Inducted: 2013\n\nWhile leading the University of Cincinnati Bearcats to the No. 2 perch in the Associated Press national ranking in 2000, Kenyon Martin was the consensus national player of the year. The 6-foot-9 center averaged 18.9 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.5 blocks per game. Many thought the 28-2 Bearcats were the best team in college basketball when Martin suffered a season-ending fracture of his leg three minutes into Cincinnati’s first Conference USA Tournament game with Saint Louis. Not only did UC lose that game but lost a probable No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament and lost a second-round game to Tulsa. Cincinnati fans still believe the Bearcats might have won the NCAA Tournament if Martin had been able to play. Later that year Martin was selected first overall in the 2000 National Basketball Association draft by the New Jersey Nets. He became an immediate starter for the Nets who ascended from last place to the NBA finals in three years. After averaging 16.7 points and 7.6 rebounds for four years, Martin was traded to Denver for three future first round draft picks and played seven years for the Nuggets. He currently plays with the New York Knicks.\n\nWatch Kenyon Martin’s Enshrinement Speech:"
