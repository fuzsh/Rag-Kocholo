        "text": "Nikola Jokic has only one thing to say to Kenyon Martin right now:\n\nBack atcha, big guy.\n\n“It means a lot, to be honest, because (Martin) was something special,” Jokic said early Monday afternoon when asked about the praise that Martin, the former Nuggets enforcer from 2004-2011, heaped upon the current Denver post star before the Nuggets-Cavaliers game last Saturday night.\n\nK-Mart, who was honored at the Pepsi Center during the Cavaliers game, isn’t one to mince words — or to sugarcoat his opinions. But he said he’s liked what he seen of The Joker, especially because the Nuggets center “competes every night.”\n\nWith Martin in the house, Jokic posted his sixth triple-double of the season against Cleveland: 19 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists in just 28 minutes.\n\n“He was an extremely high-energy guy,” Jokic said of Martin, who retired from pro basketball in 2015. “He was extremely passionate about basketball. He didn’t want to lose. And when someone like that says something (about) you, it means a lot, of course.”\n\nThe 7-foot Serbian is threatening to pass Martin on the Nuggets’ career scoring and rebounding lists over the weeks to come. Jokic opened the week with 4,285 points and snatched 2,533 rebounds over his three-plus seasons with the franchise; Martin scored 4,553 points and collected 2,583 boards during his seven years in Denver.\n\nMartin also said Jokic was a “prototypical big these days” and that he should be one of at least three Nuggets chosen to the Western Conference All-Star squad. Despite being the only center among the NBA’s top 10 in assists per game (7.7) while leading also leading the Northwest division leaders in scoring (19.6 per game) and rebounding (10.0 per contest), Jokic ranked No. 7 among Western Conference frontcourt players in the NBA All-Star Game fan voting (1.128 million votes) as of Jan. 17.\n\nFan voting, which accounts for 50 percent of the vote that determines the All-Star starters, closes Monday night.\n\n“I mean, I don’t know,” Jokic shrugged when asked about Martin’s All-Star prediction. “Yes, I think we’re all supposed to go.”\n\nThe big lug then paused, smiling wickedly.\n\n“Sparky, too,” Jokic said with a grin, a nod to longtime Nuggets equipment manager Sparky Gonzales. Who, it should be noted, is, um, not on the ballot.\n\nMorris excited for Thomas to return. Regardless of if it’s next month or later, when guard Isaiah Thomas does return to the rotation, it could translate to fewer minutes for unsung backcourt performers such as Malik Beasley — who’s averaging 14 points per game this month — and Monte Moore — one of the most pleasant surprises in the NBA. But the latter says he’s amped for the veteran to get back on the court.\n\n“Nobody’s really got egos on this team,” Morris said after practice Monday afternoon at Pepsi Center. “That’s why it’s always somebody different every night besides Nikola, he does it every night.\n\n“That just shows you we’re unselfish and I’m looking forward to I.T. coming back. It’s going to be big-time for me to see, just to be part of the journey, it’s going be a crazy story, how he came back, because he has so many naysayers and things like that about his career. So him coming back, I’m not tripping about it. I’m excited.”\n\nMalone: Goals haven’t changed. Even after 31 wins over the first 45 games, coach Michael Malone hasn’t stopped doubling down on his season-long goals for the Nuggets, including a Northwest division crown.\n\n“It really hasn’t changed,” the coach said after practice Monday. “I mean, the No. 1 goal is that we have is to find a way to get better every single day. And we feel if we do that, then that’ll take care of everything else.\n\n“And we talk about winning our division. Right now, we’re 6-0 in our division.\n\n“We talk about being an improved defensive team — much improved from last year, most notably (with) our 3-point defense. From being last to being a top-5 3-point defensive team. To being better on the road.\n\n“And the schedule does not get easier — you know, when you get a chance, everybody, look at our schedule, especially after the All-Star Break, it’s murderer’s row.”\n\nFour of the Nuggets’ first eight tilts coming out the break are on the road, including a gruesome, three-game road swing through San Antonio (March 4), the Los Angeles Lakers (March 6) and Golden State (March 8). A three-game homestand follows after that, then a brutal six-day, four-game junket at Boston (March 18), at Washington (March 21), at New York (March 22) and at Indiana (March 24).\n\nJokic enjoys teasing Malone. The last word goes to Jokic, who has trimmed his second-half foul rate this season, getting whistled for one every 11.2 minutes after halftime. That’s down more than a full minute from last winter when he was tagged with one every 10.1 minutes, and down two minutes from 2016-17, when the clip was one every 9.3 minutes. When a reporter pointed out his improvement on ticky-tack fouls late in games Monday, the Serbian grinned again and cracked: “Yeah, sometimes I do that just to (expletive) Coach (Malone off).”"
