        "text": "You might say dunking runs in the family for Kenyon Martin Jr.\n\nThe young Rockets forward has begun to make a name for himself in the NBA thanks to his constant competitiveness and a knack for explosive in-game dunks.\n\nHere he is posterizing three-time All-Star Domantas Sabonis just last week:\n\nBut he's not the only Kenyon Martin who has been known to throw it down.\n\nWatch the 2023 NBA All-Star Game on Sling TV: Sign up today!\n\nIs Kenyon Martin Jr. related to Kenyon Martin?\n\nYes, he is. Kenyon Martin Jr. — who often goes by KJ — is the son of former NBA All-Star Kenyon Martin Sr.\n\nMartin Sr. had a successful 15-year professional career that included stints with the Nets, Nuggets, Clippers, Knicks and Bucks. Taken with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2000 NBA Draft, he was a power forward known for his athleticism and dunking ability. He earned NBA All-Star honors as a member of the Nets in 2004.\n\nMORE: Updated list of starters, reserves for the 2023 All-Star Game\n\nNow, KJ is looking to replicate his dad at the 2023 NBA Slam Dunk Contest in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe 22-year-old told Marc Spears in 2019 he learned a lot from watching his dad play as a kid.\n\n“I remember his energy the most,” he said of his father. “People fed off of him on the court, and when you have energy, it makes everyone else better. Everyone is up high; no one is down low. His energy helped a lot, and that is what I’m trying to bring to my game, energy, and try to help in any way my team needs.”\n\nUnlike his dad, who had his No. 4 jersey retired by the University of Cincinnati Bearcats, KJ opted not to play in college. He originally committed to play for Vanderbilt but instead chose to spend a postgraduate year at IMG Academy in Florida. He was ultimately drafted by the Kings with the 52nd overall pick in the 2020 draft before being traded to Houston a week later.\n\nHe made his NBA debut for the Rockets in January 2021 and has slowly been earning more and more minutes throughout the last two seasons. He's currently averaging 11.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game in the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nMORE: John Wall, Russell Westbrook headline best players available on buyout market\n\nNow, he'll get the chance to show off his dunking skills with the basketball world watching on as he takes center stage in Utah this weekend. There's no doubt his dad will be proudly watching on.\n\nThe 2023 NBA Slam Dunk Contest will take place this Saturday night after the 3-Point Contest. The events begin at around 8 p.m. ET on Feb. 18."
