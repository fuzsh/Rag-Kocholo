        "text": "CINCINNATI â€” ESPN recently ranked the best college basketball players of the past 25 years and Kenyon Martin cracked the list at No. 9.\n\nThe stalwart forward dominated the paint from 1996-2000.\n\n\"The 1999-2000 Cincinnati team will always be one of men's college basketball's biggest 'What if?' cases because Martin suffered a season-ending leg injury before the NCAA tournament,\" Myron Medcalf wrote. \"Outside of that, his senior season was remarkable (18.9 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 3.5 BPG), and proof that he is one of the best two-way college players of the last quarter century.\"\n\nMartin was flat-out dominant during his run in Clifton. He averaged 11.0 PPG, 7.5 RPG, and 2.5 BPG in his career while picking up the 2000 Wooden Award and AP All-American honors.\n\nHe was also a multi-time Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year and First-Team All-Conference Player. Martin went into the NBA as a No. 1 overall pick.\n\nHe still owns the Bearcats' career blocks record (292).\n\nMake sure you bookmark All Bearcats for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more.\n\nYou May Also Like the following:\n\nUC Cracks The Top-Five Schools For Three-Star 2024 Running Back Jason Patterson\n\nThree-Star 2024 Safety Marqavious Saboor Commits to Cincinnati\n\nUC Lands Commitments From Three-Star 2024 Defensive Lineman Devyn Zahursky\n\nAlec Pierce Bullish on Tre Tucker's NFL Future: 'Instant Impact in The Kickoff Game'\n\nWatch: UC Produces Recruiting Video For Four-Star Visiting Quarterback Samaj Jones\n\nWatch: Aziz Bandaogo Shows Off Vertical Leap During UC Summer Workouts\n\nThree-Star 2024 Cornerback Rae'mon Mosby Puts UC Among Top-Nine Schools\n\nLook: UC Basketball Practices in Jordan Brand Apparel\n\nRecruiting Roundup: UC Football Offers Three-Star Quarterback Carson Boyd, Among Others\n\nLook: Big 12 Releases Game Times For a Few Early 2023 Football Games\n\nBYU Cornerback George Udo, Virginia Tech Defensive End Kyree Moyston Commit to UC\n\nFormer UC Football Coaches Mark Dantonio, Tommy Tuberville Land on 2024 College Football Hall of Fame Ballot\n\nWatch: Aziz Bandaogo Says Hello To UC Fans With Fresh Highlight Tape\n\nUC Football Cracks Top-Eight Schools For 2024 Four-Star Running Back DeJuan Williams\n\nPinging The Portal: UC Contacts Tennessee Transfer Forward Julian Phillips\n\nAthlon Sports Names Dontay Corleone, Mason Fletcher Preseason All-Americans\n\nScott Satterfield, John Cunningham, and More Discuss New Athletics Facility at Groundbreaking Ceremony\n\nWatch: University of Cincinnati Leadership Breaks Ground on New Indoor Athletic Facility\n\n-----\n\nBe sure to keep it locked on All Bearcats all the time!\n\nFollow All Bearcats on Twitter: @AllBearcats"
