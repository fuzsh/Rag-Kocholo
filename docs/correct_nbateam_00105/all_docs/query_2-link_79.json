        "text": "Prior to the trade deadline, New York had expressed interest in signing a veteran big man due to uncertainty surrounding the health of Rasheed Wallace and Marcus Camby.\n\nGrunwald said on Thursday that he's hopeful that Wallace and Camby can return this season but called Martin \"insurance\" if the veteran bigs can't get back on the floor.\n\nWallace has been out since mid-December with a stress reaction in his left foot. Camby has been sidelined since mid-January with a plantar fascia injury in his left foot.\n\nBoth players returned to practice Tuesday, but there is no specific timetable for either player's return."
