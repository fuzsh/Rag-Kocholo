        "text": "Why stop at one? Kenyon Martin thinks the Denver Nuggets are deserving of three representatives at the NBA All-Star Game next month in Charlotte.\n\n“I don’t know how many All-Stars they would get, but (among) guys that deserve it, they probably could have three,” Martin, the Nuggets’ star power forward and enforcer from 2004-11, said at the Pepsi Center on Saturday night before his old club hooked up with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n“But who knows? But (are they) deserving of that? Yeah … they’re playing well, can only get better. If they keep it together and guys continue to get better and grow. You’ve got guys that haven’t played yet: Isaiah (Thomas) and Michael Porter. So just imagine. Then you add some of that caliber of talent to the mix, it can only get better. Guys buy into just winning not ego, (it) could be great.”\n\nThe 41-year-old Martin said he’d tap center Nikola Jokic and guards Jamal Murray and Gary Harris for All-Star consideration.\n\n“They play an integral part, with what they’ve been doing,” said Martin, who was honored at the Pepsi Center as part of the Nuggets’ series Skyline Night series. “The season ebbs and flows, but … they definitely deserve it. Will it happen? You never know. (With) voters … it’s just tricky. Coaches voting on it is tricky. It’s tricky, man. You never know.”\n\nWhile Jokic brings a different style to the paint than Martin did during his salad days, the former Nuggets big man said he thinks the Serbian is “tough as nails, passes it well. He fits the prototypical big these days.”\n\nMartin was a member of the Trilogy team that won the initial BIG3 basketball league in 2017; while he’ll continue to be involved with the circuit in some capacity, “I’m not playing (anymore) … certain guys going down like Rashard Lewis ruptured his Achilles last year, Mike James fractures his knee cap.\n\n“I’m not trying to rehab; I’ve been there before. Like I was talking to (former first-round pick) Michael Porter in that locker room, just how they’re supposed to rehab and stuff like that… and I was like, ‘I had two microfractures, I had my patella repaired, and I kept playing for a reason.’ But I’m not trying to go through that (again),” Martin said. “Again, basketball’s easy. It’s rehab, that’s hard. You don’t want to do that, but you got to. You’ve got to put that much more time into it.”\n\nMartin also, ahem, lamented the state of defense in the NBA at present, calling it “terrible.”"
