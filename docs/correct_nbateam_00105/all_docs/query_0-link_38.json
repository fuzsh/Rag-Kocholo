        "text": "Three NBA players have now agreed to play in China this season and all three played for the Nuggets last season.\n\nKenyon Martin on Wednesday became the most recent player with a Nuggets background to make the historic leap. The veteran power forward will play for Xingiang Guanghui in the Chinese Basketball Association. Martin signed the biggest contract in CBA history, according to his agent, Andy Miller.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity for him to stay in shape and stay fresh,” Miller said. “It also gives him an opportunity to expand his name globally.”\n\nIt’s an exciting career opportunity for Martin, an unrestricted NBA free agent. He doesn’t have an “out” clause in his new contract, meaning he’s not coming back to the NBA should the locked-out league play this season. The Chinese Basketball Association’s regular season ends Feb. 16, but Martin’s team is talented and could make a playoff run into late March.\n\nWilson Chandler and J.R. Smith, Martin’s Denver teammates last season, also will be playing in China this year. Smith has a new contract worth about $3 million, a figure Martin is believed to have surpassed. Like Martin, Smith is an unrestricted NBA free agent. Chandler is restricted."
