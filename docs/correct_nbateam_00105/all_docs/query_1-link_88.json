        "text": "If NFL labor talk wasn't giving you your fill of legal fun, the NBA appears ready to follow suit as rumors of a basketball lockout continue to gather steam.\n\nIf the NY Daily News is right, the NBA Las Vegas summer league won't be happening this year. The league is usually a chance for rookies to prepare for their first season, while players who were undrafted, or played int eh D-League or overseas can use the league as a chance to get an invitation to somebody's camp. This helped earn Gary Forbes a job last year. Without a summer league there'll be fewer chances for someone to crack a roster.\n\nIf there is a work stoppage, even a short one, that postpones the start of the 2011-12 season. It's likely that NBA will have shorter training camps. Players with NBA experience will be safer invites to people camp. For someone like Gary Forbes, who'll be a free agent after the season, this is a good thing.\n\nFor someone like Tony Gaffney, who played this season in the D-League, or Anthony Gurley, who isn't expected to be drafted, there is less chance of becoming the next Gary Forbes.\n\nGary Forbes wakes up and starts almost every morning with a tweet: \"Thanking God for another day alive . . . #Blessed.\"\n\nLiving is something Forbes no longer takes for granted. Each day after his GForbz3 tweet, Forbes takes two insulin shots. There is another shot before lunch and one or two more before he goes to bed.\n\nThe Nuggets small forward has lived with Type 1 diabetes since he was diagnosed in 2005 when he was 19.\n\n\"I'm pretty much used to it by now,\" Forbes said. \"It doesn't bother me. It doesn't affect me. I'm still out here running up and down like everybody else.\"\n\nRead the feature in the Denver Post: Nuggets' Forbes \"blessed\" to get NBA shot\n\nIt was your typical post-practice media scrum. Guys and gals from print media, online, TV, radio. Oh, and Gary Forbes, the 6-foot-7 Nuggetsguard.\n\nForbes had wandered over from the Nuggets locker room, noticed the huddle around coach George Karl and figured he'd join in. So he pretended his water bottle was a microphone and stuck it in Karl's face.\n\nBenjamin Hochman, one of our Nuggets writers, couldn't resist.\n\n\"What about Forbes?\" he asked Karl. \"What are you thoughts on Gary Forbes?\"\n\nKarl looked up, saw Forbes, and smiled. \"He took two of the crappiest shots I've ever seen him take in the Philadelphia game,\" Karl said.\n\n\"Ever?\" Forbes asked.\n\n\"Ever,\" Karl said. He sighed, and let out a wry smile. \"I don't know. I thought about waiving him afterward.\"\n\n\"Those are some strong words. 'Ever'?\" Forbes asked.\n\n\"Ever,\" Karl reiterated with a straight face.\n\n\"Coach, you've won a thousand games,\" Forbes said. \"And I took the two crappiest shots ever?\"\n\n\"Ever,\" Karl said, smiling, \"and I think (the assistant coaches) would agree.\"\n\nFormer UMass star and Brooklyn native Gary Forbes had a feature story in the New York Daily News.\n\nIt wasn't a good omen for Gary Forbes, the Brooklyn product who played his first pro game at the Garden Sunday as a 25-year-old rookie.\n\nBefore the Knicks beat Forbes' Nuggets, 129-125, Spike Lee, the denizen of all things Brooklyn, admitted to the Daily News that he had never heard of Forbes, who starred at Banneker High in Fort Greene.\n\nMaybe he should have known him since Forbes' team lost to Sebastian Telfair and Lincoln in the 2003 PSAL city championship game at the Garden. Lee famously chronicled Coney Island's Lincoln High in his film, \"He Got Game.\"\n\nWhile Telfair jumped from Lincoln to the NBA, Forbes took a meandering journey to the pros, through a pair of high schools, two colleges, Italy, Israel, the NBA Development league and finally to the Denver Nuggets this season.\n\nWhen Gary Forbes was a player at UMass, he and then Minuteman coach Travis Ford were tight. They had similar competitive streaks and Forbes was a perfect player in Ford's system.\n\nSo I called Ford tonight to get a comment on Forbes' reaching the NBA. The former UMass coach was excited at the news.\n\nI've talked to him quite often. We stayed in contact and talked a lot lately. It was great to get the phone call from him.\n\nFord said Forbes tried to play it nonchalant when he called\n\n\"He was like 'Hey coach, how're you doing?' and I was like \"Did you make it?!\"\n\n\"Here's a kid who just kept believing in himself more than anything. When he was playing over in Stillwater he'd come over and spend time with me in Stillwater. He kept saying 'Coach I'm going to make it.'\"\n\n\"Last season he went for the money which I thought was a smart idea, but he kept saying he was going to make it. I think he finally got in the right system.\"\n\n\"He's done the hardest part. The hardest part is getting in. He's a guy that could stick around for a while. He's played well in the preseason and has been able to show what he's capable of doing. He's gotten a lot better since he's left UMass.\"\n\n\"It goes two ways. I'm still in touch with a couple players, who played for me in my first year at Oklahoma State. If you see a guy like that it makes you want to keep trying. But a very small percentage accomplish what Gary is able to accomplish. A very very small percentage. Guys who've been out of college for two years don't usually make it. Some of these guys I'm talking to probably aren't going to make it, but this gives them a little bit of hope to keep going. Players don't realize who hard it is to make the league.\""
