        "text": "Fast Facts:\n\nOn Thursday, October 28th, weâll be dropping new Common Archive Set packs for $19.\n\nFeaturing new historical Momentâ¢ collectibles, these packs will feature the first Common Moments from select stars covering the 2005-06 and 2013-14 seasons.\n\nThe General Queue starts at 1pm PDT, with a 30 Collector Score requirement to enter the queue. The Priority Queue starts at 11am PDT, with 3,000 Collector Score points (including bonus)Â required to enter the queue.Â\n\nIf you qualify for the Priority Queue, you will be able to purchase up to 3 packs.\n\nâ\n\nOPENÂ THEÂ ARCHIVE>>\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâKenyon Martin - Nuggets\n\nâ\n\nAn incredible leaper with great finishing ability, Kenyon Martin made waves in the league after he was selected #1 overall by the then-New Jersey Nets in 2000. Martin teamed up with Jason Kidd & Richard Jefferson to help propel Jersey to the Finals in 2002 & 2003.Â\n\nThere werenât many better pick and roll/alley-oop combos in the early millennium than Kidd & Martin. Whenever there was space, Martin made sure to throw down a ridiculous slam - plenty of highlight-worthy plays in the vault.Â\n\nMartin went on to have a strong stretch with theÂ Nuggets, where he and Marcus Camby joined forces to form one of the most imposing front courts in the NBA.\n\nHis son, current Houston Rockets forward KJ Martin, is a great athlete and shot-blocker in his own right.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nLuke Walton - Lakers\n\nâ\n\nThe son of NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton and current Sacramento Kings head coach, Luke spent 9 of his 10 NBA seasons donning purple & gold with the Lakers. Though Phil Jackson used Walton in more of a utility role off the bench, Luke was instrumental during LAâs Finals appearances from 2008-2010 as a defender and playmaker.Â\n\nAfter Luke got his second title in 2010, he and his father Bill (won in 1977 & 1986) became the first father-son duo in NBA History to win multiple titles during their career.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMarcus Camby - NuggetsÂ\n\nâ\n\nFor years, Marcus Camby ruled the paint as a premiere rim protector: 2007 Defensive Player of the Year, 4-time leader in blocks (sits at 12th! on the all-time leaderboard) & 2 NBA All-Defensive First Team selections.Â\n\nHe made a strong impact on three different teams in particular: Raptors, Knicks & Nuggets.Â\n\nCamby helped put Toronto on the map as an expansion team (formed in 1995, Camby was drafted in 1996), filled in for an injured Patrick Ewing as the 8-seed Knicks made an improbable run to the Finals in 1999 and anchored the lane as Denver went from lottery team to Western Conference contender in the mid-2000s.Â Camby's run with the Nuggets included some moderate playoff success alongside Carmelo Anthony and Kenyon Martin.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâMario Chalmers - Heat\n\nâ\n\nMario Chalmers is a winner on every level of basketball. A two-time state champion in high school, Chalmers capped off his college career at Kansas with a buzzer-beating three to send the 2008 National Championship game into overtime - where Kansas went on to capture the title.Â\n\nAfter establishing himself as a starting point guard under Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, Chalmers made great contributions during Miamiâs back-to-back Finals victories in 2012 & 2013 - he provided timely scoring and clutch plays, including a 25-point outing to help defeat OKC in Game 4 of 2012 Finals.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMichael Finley - SpursÂ\n\nâ\n\nSelected 21st overall out of Wisconsin in 1995, Michael Finley made a big difference over 15 seasons in the NBA - most notably as a go-to scorer in Dallas. With a profile as a strong perimeter threat (pull-up jumper is a thing of beauty), Finley averaged over 20 points/night for 5 straight seasons from 1997-2002 - earned back-to-back All-Star selections in 2000 & 2001.Â\n\nDallasâs Big 3 of Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash and Finley had it all: a versatile shooting big, a pure shooting floor general and a scoring wing who could also create and play defense.Â In the 2005-06 season,Â Finley joined the San Antonio Spurs where he played a key role for the 63-win team.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nSteve Francis - Magic\n\nâ\n\nNicknamed âFranchiseâ or âStevie Franchise,â Steve Francis was a lot like many of the explosive guards in todayâs game. A real aerial artist at 6â3, Francis was creative on the break, with the type of elevation to complete creative flushes - like his infamous âself alley-oopâ or patented leaning, one-handed tomahawk.Â\n\nWhat made Francis so fun to watch, however, was how he would combine his crossover and other combo dribbles into a huge finish over the top. His athleticism and speed in the open court was unmatched in that era.Â Â\n\nThough Francis had his NBA career cut short at age 31 due to a knee injury, he produced plenty of big moments early on as a 3-time All-Star in Houston.Â He was the cover athlete of NBAÂ Live 2002, and was the centerpiece in a trade that sent Tracy McGrady from Orlando to Houston.\n\nFrancis' time in Orlando was short-lived, but it included a full season in which \"Franchise\"Â averaged 21.3 points, 7.0 assists, and 5.8 rebounds per game.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWally Szczerbiak - Timberwolves\n\nâ\n\nWally World! Though now more known as a college basketball analyst for CBS, Szczerbiak experienced a nice NBA career after being drafted from little-known Miami (of Ohio) in 1999. In Minnesota, Szczerbiak quickly developed into a perimeter scorer to take pressure off Kevin Garnett.Â\n\nBy year 3, he was named to the All-Star team after posting just under 19 points/night on 51% shooting from the field and 46% from deep.Â\n\nWally finished his playing days with career averages of 14.1 points and 4 rebounds, his best years coming as a member of the Timberwolves from 1999-2006.Â Szczerbiak's smooth stroke and strong frame would lend itself well to today's NBA.\n\nâ"
