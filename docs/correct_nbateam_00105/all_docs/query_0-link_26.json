        "text": "Ex-Denver Nuggets power forward Kenyon Martin has agreed to a buyout with his Chinese team, the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, according to Yahoo!'s Adrian Wojnarowski. While this is definitely good news for Martin (and his agent), it doesn't mean that Martin will be able to return to the NBA immediately.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, Martin will be unable to return to an NBA team until after Xinjiang's season ends, which may last into late February or early March depending on if the team makes, and advances in, the China Basketball Association's playoffs. Once the season ends, Martin will be able to receive a waiver from FIBA allowing him to return to the NBA. It's unclear at the moment whether or not Martin will be able to negotiate with NBA teams while Xinjiang's season is still in progress."
