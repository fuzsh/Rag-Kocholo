        "text": "The Denver Nuggets are a professional basketball team based in Denver, Colorado. Founded in 1967 as a member of the American Basketball Association (ABA), the team has a rich history and has been a mainstay in the city of Denver for over 50 years.\n\nEarly years: 1967-1976\n\nThe Denver Nuggets were founded in 1967 as a member of the American Basketball Association (ABA), a rival league to the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was owned by a group of Denver businessmen, who chose the team's name and colors to reflect the city's mining history.\n\nIn their inaugural season, the Nuggets finished with a 36-42 record and missed the playoffs. However, the team quickly turned things around in their second season, posting a 48-34 record and reaching the ABA Finals, where they lost to the Kentucky Colonels.\n\nThe Nuggets continued to be a competitive team in the ABA, making the playoffs in all but one season during the nine years of the league's existence. In 1975, the team was led by All-Star forward/center Dan Issel, who averaged 25.9 points and 12.9 rebounds per game and was named ABA MVP.\n\nJoining the NBA: 1976-1984\n\nIn the last season of the ABA, 1976, Denver had one of its best campaigns. That season they reached the NBA Finals with a cast of renowned players such as David Thompson, Marvin Webster, Dan Issel and Bobby Jones. The season would end with Denver winning the final edition.\n\nThe following summer the ABA disappeared and Denver switched to the Denver Nuggets name because the Rockets were already taken.\n\nThe decade of the 80's began with the dismissal of Brown, which caused the team's performance to drop until the arrival of Doug Moe. This coach brought fresh air and a very flashy style based on a very powerful offense but poor defense. During that decade the team averaged 115 points and became one of the flashiest teams to watch.\n\nThis great offense was supported by two great scorers like Kiki Vandeweghe and Alex English, both with more than 25 ppp. During that decade the Denver showed their great offensive power and poor defense in a game for history in which, Nuggets and Pistons combined to score 370 points. The final score was 186-184 in favor of Detroit.\n\nIn the 1984-1985 season Denver reached the conference finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. However, the power of Magic and company was too much for them. The following season began with the trade of Kiki Vandeweghe for Fat Lever, Calvin Natt... These reinforcements, along with star Alex English, caused the Nuggets to repeat in the conference finals. However, once again Magic and company clipped the wings of the Colorado Nuggets.\n\nThe following seasons, until the 90's, saw repeated playoff and conference finals appearances, although in no year could the Nuggets reach the finals. Houston and Dallas took it upon themselves to cut the dream short.\n\n@NBAFantasy\n\nDecade of the 90s\n\nThe decade, like the previous one, started with a coaching change. Moe left the team right at the beginning of the decade, his position was replaced by former Suns player Paul Westhead. Despite the coaching change, the philosophy remained the same. Moe and Paul shared a passion for great offense, but a poor concern for defense. His tenure in Colorado was a disaster. The team had a couple of forgettable seasons with poor overall records.\n\nPaul Westhead was fired before the 92-93 season. That summer was a turning point. Former Nuggets player Issel was chosen as the bench replacement. Aside from the bench replacement, the summer began with the selection of Dikembe Mutombo in the draft. The Congolese signed a great season finishing 2nd in the ROTY race. The following year the outlook improved, although without making the playoffs. The following season the team, led by Mutombo, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Ellis managed to finish the season with a 42-40 overall record, which allowed Denver to enter the playoffs. Those playoffs were characterized by being the first in which the eighth-ranked team eliminated the first-ranked team. The series against Seattle was a tribute to the defense at the hands of Mutombo, who would end up averaging 6.2 blocks per game. That feat was nearly repeated against the Jazz the following year, but Malone and Stockton won Game 7 91-81.\n\nIn the 1996 season, the Congolese center left the franchise for Atlanta. After the departure of the center, Antonio McDyess was brought in to be the franchise player. The new signing did not find support due to Ellis' injuries and Adbul-Rauf's departure. Because of this, the Nuggets signed one of the worst records in history with only 11 wins.\n\n@NBALatam\n\nCarmelo Anthony era\n\nAfter a few years in no man's land, the Colorado team began to show signs of a renaissance with the selection of Carmelo Anthony. Anthony's arrival was accompanied by Andre Miller, Boykins, Nene and Camby. Little by little the Nuggets regained their prestige. The first playoff adventures of the decade were not the best. Minnesota defeated Denver 4-1.\n\nSome time later, George Karl took over the reins of the team. He achieved a 32-8 record, which added to the previous record, led to a playoff berth. However, a powerful San Antonio Spurs managed to take the series 4-1. Little by little Denver was building a good team with players like Jr. Smith. In the 2005-2006 season they reached the postseason again, but lost again in the first round, this time to the Clippers.\n\nOn December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded Joe Smith, Andre Miller and two 2007 first-round draft picks to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ivan McFarlin and star Allen Iverson. The shooting guard came to Denver to team up with Carmelo Anthony, who was gradually becoming one of the best scorers in the league. Iverson's first season in Colorado was a carbon copy of the 2004-2005 season. The team made it to the Playoffs, but couldn't do anything against the Spurs. Seasons went by and Denver kept making the playoffs, but without even making it to the second, third rounds... Both scorers were getting good averages, but without ever materializing those averages into something bigger.\n\n@AS_History\n\nAnthony-Billups Era\n\nThe 2008 season was a time of change. First, Camby was traded to the Clippers for a first round draft pick. Second, in November 2008, the Nuggets traded Allen Iverson to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess and Cheikh Samb.\n\nBillups' arrival brought the leap in quality that did not come with Iverson. The point guard, a ring winner with the Pistons, brought to the team a game control that was foreign to Iverson's style of play. That season, the Nuggets achieved their best record (54-28) and a good performance in the playoffs. In the first round they defeated the New Orleans Hornets, with a difference, in the 4th game, of 58 points. In the second round it was Dallas who suffered the effects of the Anthony-Billups partnership. After overcoming Dirk and company, the next and last step was the Lakers. It was the first NBA Finals in the history of the Nuggets. However, they were unable to reach the NBA Finals after losing 4-2 to the Lakers.\n\nThe following season was marked by mid-season injuries to their three stars and coach. That season ended with a 53-29 overall record and elimination in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n@NBAdictosRC\n\nRebuilding and current situation\n\nIn February 2011, after a disgruntled season for Carmelo Anthony, the Nuggets traded him in a multi-trade involving several teams. The Nuggets got rid of Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman and in turn acquired the services of Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Kosta Koufos and Timofey Mozgov. That season would continue to be a season of change and important players such as Nene, J.R Smith and Kenyon Martin left the franchise. The season ended with a sixth place finish and a first round exit.\n\nThe following season began with the Nuggets being involved in the famous Howard trade, which sent Iguodala to Denver. That season was an outstanding season, the Nuggets finished 3rd in the western conference. However, the Warriors beat them in the first round 4-2.\n\nThe following seasons were weak. The team stopped appearing in the Playoffs and the rebuilding began. A team was built with draft picks with players such as Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic...\n\nCurrently Denver is going through some good years, they have managed to place themselves among the highest positions of the table with a stellar Jokic. However, the situation in the playoffs is very different from the one offered in the regular season. Despite this, the future is very hopeful for Denver as they have one of the best young players in the league."
