Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Denver Nuggets are a historical team that has been led by many great players, and with this article, we will divulge into power forwards in team history.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets are a franchise that has always been able to accumulate talent. The one problem has been being able to retain that talent, but that is beside the point.\n\nEveryone knows about the talented small forwards, shooting guards, and point guards the Nuggets have had through the years. However, the one position that has been overshadowed is the power forward spot.\n\nWhile not as glamorous as the Nuggets legendary small forwards, they have had some great power forwards as well.\n\nJan 21, 2016; Cincinnati, OH, USA; Former professional basketball player and former Cincinnati Bearcat Kenyon Lee Martin acknowledges the fans at Fifth Third Arena. Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKenyon Martin\n\nWhile he was not the New Jersey Nets Kenyon Martin, he provided Denver with a physicality they needed desperately.\n\nMartin stepped in his first year and averaged 15.5 points per game and 7.3 rebounds per game for the Denver Nuggets. This was his fifth year in the league after being drafted out of the University of Cincinnati.\n\nKenyon Martin spent the majority of his years in Denver, and he would continue to bring the physicality nightly.\n\nMartin was not someone who would stuff the stat sheet night in and night out, but he was an enforcer. Any opponent who got in Martin’s face was running a dangerous risk. He was a reliable defensive presence with Denver even averaging 2 blocks per game in the postseason one year.\n\nIt is key to note that Martin made the playoffs every season that he was with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nNene\n\nNene never quite materialized like a lot of fans hoped he would. However, much of that had to do with injuries. The guy is an inspiration to Nugget faithful for battling and winning against testicular cancer and still coming back to play.\n\nWhile it wasn’t a pretty trade getting JaVale McGee in return, Nene has developed into one of the strongest rim protectors. It was a trade that benefited the Wizards for a couple of years. Nene was a great defender for the Nuggets and was an efficient scorer. He had one season where he shot an outstanding 60% from the field and it was rare for him to shoot under 40%.\n\nNene’s best days were in a Nuggets jersey. During the 08-09 season, Nene’s true shooting percentage was 64.5%. He was a dominate big man. While not being a great shooter- honestly anywhere other than right by the rim- Nene used his energy and athleticism to spark the Nuggets team. Nene in his prime was much like Joakim Noah a few seasons ago.\n\nNene was a great second tier player for Denver.\n\nBobby Jones\n\nJones was a defensive mastermind for the Denver Nuggets. He helped lead the Nuggets to an ABA Finals appearance in 1976, so it would be foolish to leave him off this list.\n\nJones has left his imprint on the Nuggets’ history books leaving behind 625 blocks during his tenure with Denver. Jones, being 6th in team history for steals, would probably intimidate some of the power forwards in today’s game.\n\nThere isn’t too much more about Jones. He was a very underrated NBA player. He also ended up being a top defender for the Nuggets.\n\nKiki Vandeweghe\n\nOf course, any Nuggets fan would know Kiki should be on this list.\n\nVandeweghe is one of the true pioneers of Denver basketball along with his former teammate Alex English. Despite only playing four seasons with Denver before being traded, Kiki put up significant numbers at 23.3 points per game and 5.3 boards per game.\n\nIn one season that he was with the Denver Nuggets, he actually got up to a whopping 29.4 points per game!\n\nVandeweghe provided a spark with Alex English one time scoring 51 in a game while his counterpart poured in 47. Kiki Vandeweghe was one of the first true stretch 4’s in Nuggets history.\n\nFeb 10, 2016; Auburn Hills, MI, USA; Retired professional basketball player Antonio McDyess (middle) shares a laugh with former teammates Rasheed Wallace (left) and Richard Hamilton (right) during halftime in the game between the Detroit Pistons and the Denver Nuggets at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Nuggets win 103-92. Mandatory Credit: Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAntonio McDyess\n\nOkay before you crucify me, let me just state my reasoning.\n\nMcDyess may not have had the scoring ability like Kiki, but a young McDyess was relatively athletic and more rounded in other areas of the game. McDyess was great in the post averaging around 20 points per game in 2 different seasons with Denver.\n\nAntonio McDyess didn’t have a year where he did not average double figures in points until the 2003-2004 season. He was a solid rebounder throughout his entire career as well.\n\nIt is a big chart, but I bet you didn’t know that he averaged 20.8 points per game along with 12.1 rebounds. Can I hear Tim Duncan?\n\nMcDyess was a second overall draft pick for a reason. McDyess’ great tenure in Denver earns him the title of greatest power forward in Nuggets’ history.\n\nWe definitely acknowledge that you may not agree with our list, but we certainly hope you tell us your thoughts and drop of a comment or just comment/reply on Twitter and Facebook!\n\nMore from Nugg Love\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
