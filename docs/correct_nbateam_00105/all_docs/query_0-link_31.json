        "text": "China’s professional basketball league has snagged its latest NBA refugee, and fans of the Denver Nuggets may be asking: What did we ever do to you?\n\nKenyon Martin, a free-agent forward who played the last seven seasons in Denver, signed a one-year deal with the Xinjiang Guanghui, according to his agent, Andy Martin. He also told the Denver Post that Martin’s contract is the richest in Chinese Basketball Association history. Yahoo Sports reports Kenyon Martin’s salary will total $2.65 million for the season, while manager and agent fees will bring the team’s total bill to $3 million.\n\nThat makes K-Mart, as the 33-year-old player is known, the third former Nugget to move to China since the U.S. league was locked out by the owners July 1. Wilson Chandler was the first NBA player to make such a move, signing a one-year contract with Zhejiang Guangsha in August, and Zhejiang Chouzhou followed this month by picking up another Denver guard, J.R. Smith."
