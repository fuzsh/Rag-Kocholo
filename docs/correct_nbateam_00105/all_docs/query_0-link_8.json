        "text": "During a recent episode of Gil's Arena, former NBA All-Stars Gilbert Arenas and Kenyon Martin slammed the idea that a team from Lebanon would have chance against the Denver Nuggets. The conversation was sparked from Noah Lyles' comments about the NBA Finals being called a World Championship, as both Arenas and Martin were arguing that no team outside of the NBA would stand a chance against the defending champion Nuggets.\n\n\"Ya'll would lose by 200,\" Arenas told Rashad McCants, who said his team from Lebanon would have a chance against the Nuggets. \"Stop... For the Denver Nuggets to go around the [United States], to play a bunch of sorry ass teams, it's a waste of f--king time. We're talking about the NBA with the best Euro teams in the country would be on the NBA teams, not on the team that won the EuroCup.\"\n\nArenas seems to be proposing a hypothetical scenario where the best Euroleague teams joined the NBA to see if they could challenge a team like the Nuggets, which he sees as a waste of time since Denver is so superior. While this is of course not a scenario that would ever happen, it was Arenas's way of explaining why there's nothing wrong with the NBA Champions being called World Champions, since in his eyes there is no challenger anywhere in the world for a team like the Nuggets.\n\nNikola Jokic Could Pass LeBron James on Historic List Next Season\n\nFormer Nuggets Player Unleashes Controversial LeBron James Take"
