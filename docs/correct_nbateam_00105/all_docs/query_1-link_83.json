        "text": "Our NBA trade tracker for 2024 NBA off-season is now live. We look at NBA trades today with grades and analysis for each of these basketball trades, regardless of how small they might be.\n\nThis offseason promises to be filled with a ton of big-time trades. It started with the Oklahoma City Thunder sending a former All-Rookie performer back east.\n\nWho got traded in the NBA today?\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans pull off blockbuster Dejounte Murray trade\n\nPelicans get: Dejounte Murray\n\nHawks get: Dyson Daniels, Larry Nance Jr., two first-round picks\n\nNew Orleans now has a big four after acquiring this All-Star guard from Atlanta. Whether it remains a big four, depends on if the team is going to trade Brandon Ingram. Regardless, acquiring Murray for what is seemingly pennies on the dollar is a major win. He’s averaging 21.5 points, 5.3 rebounds and 6.3 assists over the past two seasons. For Atlanta, it’s now clear that the team is going into rebuild mode. Though, one would think the team might have landed more for Murray.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: A+\n\nAtlanta Hawks: D\n\nDetroit Pistons acquire Tim Hardaway Jr\n\nPistons get: Tim Hardaway Jr., three second-round picks\n\nMavericks get: Quentin Grimes\n\nThis was a pure cost-cutting move for the Mavericks. Hardaway Jr. is set to count $16.2 million against the cap with Grimes’ cap hit being $4.3 million. Hence, why the defending Western Conference champions sent three second-round picks to the Pistons.\n\nPrior to pretty much finding himself out of the rotation during the playoffs, Hardaway Jr. avraged 14.4 pointts on 35% shooting from distance last season. He gives Detroit a veteran wing. Meanwhile, the the 24-year-old Grimes averaged 7.0 points on a mere 37% shooting last season.\n\nLatest NBA trades\n\nSacramento Kings trade Davion Mitchell to Toronto Raptors\n\nKings get: Jalen McDaniels\n\nRaptors get: Davion Mitchell, Sasha Vezenkov, 45th pick\n\nFor the Kings, moving on from Mitchell just three seasons after making him the ninth pick feels like a loss, but to be fair, he had fallen out of favor with other players outperforming him in Sacramento. This trade indicates that the Kings are making another move soon.\n\nAs for the Raptors, it’s hard not to love the idea of adding a 25-year-old former lottery pick, plus a potential sharpshooter in Vezenkov. McDaniels is 26, who knows how much untapped potential he has left, if any.\n\nSacramento Kings: C-\n\nToronto Raptors: B+\n\nAtlanta Hawks trade recent first-round pick\n\nHawks get: 44th pick\n\nRockets get: A.J. Griffin\n\nAtlanta is giving up on this former first-round pick from Duke after just two seasons. Griffin averaged a robust 8.9 points on 39% shooting from distance as a rookie. He fell out of the rotation this past season, scoring 2.4 points per in less than nine minutes of action. It’s still surprising that the Hawks are giving up on him so quickly.\n\nAtlanta Hawks: D\n\nHouston Rockets: A\n\nGolden State Warriors add three-point shooter\n\nWarriors get: Lindy Waters III\n\nThunder get: 52nd pick\n\nGolden State now doesn’t have a pick in the 2024 NBA Draft after making this move ahead of Round 2. It moves a late pick for a 26-year-old guard in Waters III who could find himself in the rotation. In limited playing time over three seasons with OKC, Waters shot 38% from three-point range. That included a 44% mark in 2023-24. The Thunder just continue to add to their draft capital.\n\nGolden State Warriors: A\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: A\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves sell off Wendell Moore to Detroit Pistons\n\nPistons get: Wendell Moore, 37th pick\n\nTimberwolves get: 53rd pick\n\nAfter making two selections in the first round of the NBA Draft the Timberwolves are in cost-cutting mode. They opted to move off 2023 first-round pick Wendell Moore Jr. and his $2.8 million salary for next season in a trade with Detroit. The Wolves also moved down 16 spots in the second round, which saves even more money. From Detroit’s perspective, it gets a still-young forward while moving to the top of the second round.\n\nDetroit Pistons: A+\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: A\n\nPortland Trail Blazers add Deni Avdija in big trade\n\nBlazers get: Deni Avdija\n\nWizards get: Malcolm Brogdon, 14th pick, future first-round pick, two second-round picks\n\nThe Blazers get a potentially good three-and-D wing to team up with Scoot Henderson and Co moving forward. Still only 23 years old, Avdija averaged 14.7 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists on 51% shooting last season. Washington simply looks to collect draft picks as the team continues its rebuild.\n\nBlazers: A\n\nWizards: D\n\nNew York Knicks pull off blockbuster trade for Mikal Bridges\n\nKnicks get: Mikal Bridges\n\nNets get: Unprotecte first-round picks in 2025, 2026, 2029 and 2031; Bucks unprotected first-round pick in 2025, 2028 pick swap and 2025 second-round pick\n\nThe New York Knicks have pulled off the first big blockbuster of the NBA offseason, acquiring star forward Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nTo say that this is an absolutely huge move for both the Nets and Knicks would be an understatement. New York had built up draft assets to make a move of this ilk in recent years. As of yet, it had primarily held on to these assets.\n\nAs for the Nets, this represents the clearest indication yet that they are going to go into full-scale rebuild mode under general manager Sean Marks.\n\nKnicks: A\n\nNets: A\n\nChicago Bulls acquire Josh Giddey from Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nChicago Bulls get: Josh Giddey\n\nOklahoma City Thunder get: Alex Caruso\n\nThe Chicago Bulls have picked up a former top-six pick in Giddey from Oklahoma City. Giddey earned All-Rookie honor in 2021-22 and looked to be a franchise cornerstone in OKC. He’s averaging 13.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.6 assists throughout his career. Struggles in the 2024 playoffs and some off-court issues made him expendable.\n\nAs for the Thunder, they get one of the better perimeter defenders in the game. Caruso has earned two All-NBA Defensive Team honors throughout his career. He’s a major get for OKC.\n\nThunder: A+\n\nBulls: C\n\nGolden State Warriors make a small trade\n\nIndiana Pacers get: Cory Joseph, cash\n\nGolden State Warriors get: Second-round pick\n\nBoston Celtics open up roster space\n\nPortland Trail Blazers get: Dalano Banton\n\nBoston Celtics get: Second-round pick\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers clear another roster spot\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers get: Second-round pick\n\nBoston Celtics get: Jaden Springer\n\nMilwaukee Bucks ship out Robin Lopez\n\nMilwaukee Bucks get: Cash\n\nSacramento Kings get: Robin Lopez\n\nIndiana Pacers trade for sharpshooter\n\nIndiana Pacers get: Doug McDermott\n\nSan Antonio Spurs get: 2029 second-round pick, Marcus Morris\n\nPat Beverley lands with Milwaukee Bucks for NBA Finals run\n\nMilwaukee Bucks get: Patrick Beverley\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers get: Cam Payne, 2027 second-round pick\n\nPhoenix Suns strengthen bench rotation with Royce O’Neale\n\nPhoenix Suns get: Royce O’Neale, David Roddy\n\nBrooklyn Nets get: Three second-round picks, Keita Bates-Diop, Chimezie Metu, Jordan Goodwin\n\nMemphis Grizzlies get: Draft pick swap, Yuta Watanabe\n\nDallas Mavericks add PJ Washington via trade\n\nDallas Mavericks get: PJ Washington, two future second-round picks\n\nCharlotte Hornets get: Grant Williams, Seth Curry, 2027 first-round pick\n\nToronto Raptors make trade with Brooklyn Nets\n\nToronto Raptors get: Spencer Dinwiddie\n\nBrooklyn Nets get: Dennis Schroder, Thaddeus Young\n\nDallas Mavericks, Washington Wizards exchange bigs\n\nDallas Mavericks get: Daniel Gafford\n\nWashington Wizards get: Richaun Holmes\n\nNew York Knicks swap Quentin Grimes for Alec Burks, Bojan Bogdanovic\n\nNew York Knicks get: Alec Burks, Bojan Bogdanovic\n\nDetroit Pistons get: Quentin Grimes, Malachi Flynn, Evan Fournier, Ryan Arcidiacono, two future second-round picks\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers clear roster spot in anticipation of bigger move\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers get: Cap relief, roster space\n\nDetroit Pistons get: Danuel House Jr., 2024 second-round pick\n\nOklahoma City Thunder trade for Gordon Hayward\n\nOklahoma City Thunder get: Gordon Hayward\n\nCharlotte Hornets get: Tre Mann, Davis Bertans, Vasilije Micic, draft compensation\n\nUtah Jazz add more future assets in Kelly Olynyk trade\n\nToronto Raptors get: Kelly Olynyk, Ochai Agbaji\n\nUtah Jazz get: Otto Porter Jr., Kira Lewis, 2024 first-round pick\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers land Buddy Hield\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers get: Buddy Hield\n\nIndiana Pacers get: Marcus Morris, Furkan Korkmaz, three second-round picks\n\nBoston Celtics pick up Xavier Tillman\n\nBoston Celtics get: Xavier Tillman\n\nMemphis Grizzlies get: Lamar Stevens, 2 2nd-round picks\n\nBoston acquires a top bench option in the frontcourt in a player in Tillman who has improved each season he’s been in the NBA. The 6-foot-8 veteran is averaging 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds on the season. He’s seen as a defensive-minded specialist. In return, Memphis picks up some of the draft assets it lost in the Steven Adams trade with Houston.\n\nHouston Rockets acquire Steven Adams\n\nHouston Rockets get: Steven Adams, 3 2nd-round picks\n\nMemphis Grizzlies get: Victor Oladipo\n\nThe Grizzlies are in money-saving mode as they find themselves in the midst of a down season. Moving off Adams’ contract for Oladipo’s expiring at the cost of three second-round picks is the latest example of this. It will save the team $12.5 million next season.\n\nAs for Houston, this is also a move for next season. Adams is out for the 2023-24 campaign due to injury. But when he’s been healthy, the 30-year-old center has proven to be valuable. Adams is averaging 10.7 points and 9.3 rebounds since the start of the 2016-17 season.\n\nHouston Rockets: A\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: C\n\nMiami Heat acquire Terry Rozier\n\nMiami Heat get: Terry Rozier\n\nCharlotte Hornets get: Kyle Lowry, 1st-round pick\n\nIt might not have been Damian Lillard or James Harden. But the Heat have found a running partner for Jimmy Butler. It comes in the form of the 29-year-old Rozier who is averaging 23.2 points and 6.6 assists on 46% shooting from the field this season.\n\nThis gives Miami four 20-point scorers in that of Butler, Rozier, Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo. It’s something front office head Pat Riley has been seeking for some time now.\n\nThe cost was Lowry’s expiring contract and a future first-round pick (lottery protected in 2027, unprotected in 2028). From Charlotte’s perspective, the team is still going to look to flip Lowry’s expiring contract for more assets ahead of the Feb. 8 NBA trade deadline.\n\nMiami Heat: B-\n\nCharlotte Hornets: B\n\nPascal Siakam trade to the Indiana Pacers\n\nIndiana Pacers get: Pascal Siakam, Kira Lewis, 2nd-round pick\n\nToronto Raptors get: Bruce Brown, Jordan Nwora, 3 1st-round picks\n\nOklahoma City Thunder get: N/A\n\nThe long-awaited Pascal Siakam trade has finally happened with the two-time All-Star forward heading to the upstart Indiana Pacers. The price with huge. Indiana sends three future first-round picks, including two in 2024, to Toronto for the impending free agent.\n\nThis is a major shot the Pacers are taking to team Siakam up with star guard Tyrese Haliburton. The price was high. But in a vacuum, Siakam is more than worth it.\n\nFrom Toronto’s perspective, the team is clearly headed for a rebuild. It moved OG Anunoby to the New York Knicks late last month. The team now adds three future first-round picks to the mix for a player that was not going to be in Toronto long-term.\n\nIndiana Pacers: B+\n\nToronto Raptors: A\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: N/A\n\nMinor trade between Pistons, Wizards\n\nDetroit Pistons get: Danilo Gallinari and Mike Muscala\n\nWashington Wizards get: Marvin Bagley, Isaiah Livers, 2 2nd-round picks\n\nThis move between the two bottom feeders in the Eastern Conference was all about Washington taking on Bagley’s multi-year contract while moving off two expirings. This will save the Pistons $12.5 million for next season while adding two more future second-round picks to Washington’s draft warchest.\n\nDetroit Pistons: D\n\nWashington Wizards: A\n\nNew York Knicks pull off blockbuster trade for OG Anunoby\n\nNew York Knicks get: OG Anunoby, Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn\n\nToronto Raptors get: R.J. Barrett, Immanuel Quickley, 2nd-round pick\n\nThis is a deal that seems to work out for both sides. New York moves off Barrett’s contract while adding a defensive-minded wing in Anunoby who has been the subject of NBA trade rumors for some time now. He’ll team up with Jalen Brunson to form an elite duo in New York.\n\nAs for the Raptors, they acquire an up-and-coming Quickley to help led the charge in their rebuild. Meanwhile, a change of scenery could end up doing Barrett well.\n\nNew York Knicks: A\n\nToronto Raptors: A\n\nSacramento Kings acquire depth from Los Angeles Clippers\n\nSacramento Kings get: Filip Petrušev, cash\n\nLos Angeles Clippers get: —\n\nThe Kings utilied an open roster space by acquiring this former second-round pick and cash from Los Angeles on Nov. 1. Petrušev was originally sent to the Clippers from Philadelphia in the James Harden blockbuster. It’s a low-risk move for the Kings in that they are able to see what the 23-year-old Serbian native offers. From Los Angeles’ perspective, it needed to clear a roster spot.\n\nSacramento Kings: N/A\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: N/A\n\nJames Harden blockbuster trade to the Los Angeles Clippers\n\nLos Angeles Clippers get: James Harden, P.J. Tucker, Filip Petrušev\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers get: Marcus Morris, Nic Batum, Robert Covington, K.J. Martin, 2 1st-round picks, 2 2nd-round picks, pick swap\n\nThis blockbuster trade has finally happened roughly a week into the 2023-24 NBA regular season. Harden is now headed to the Clippers to team up with fellow future Hall of Famers Paul George, Kawhi Leonard and Russell Westbrook for Los Angeles.\n\nIn return, the 76ers add three rotational pieces in that of Morris, Batum and Covington to the frontcourt. Front office head Daryl Morey also creates a ton of flexibility moving forward with the draft pick assets he acquired in this blockbuster trade.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: A\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: A\n\nKevin Porter Jr. traded after off-court issues\n\nOklahoma City Thunder get: Kevin Porter Jr, 2027 2nd (MIN), 2028 2nd (MIL)\n\nHouston Rockets get: Victor Oladipo, Jeremiah Robinson-Earl\n\nPorter Jr. was arrested back in September and charged by the New York Police Department for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend. The details of the alleged incident are terrible. Immediately, the Rockets attempted to find a trade partner for the troubled, but high-scoring wing.\n\nThey did just that ahead of opening day by pretty much giving Oklahoma City two future second-round picks while taking on multiple deep bench options. The Thunder immediately waived Porter Jr., who might have played his final NBA game.\n\nHouston Rockets: B\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: A\n\nJrue Holiday blockbuster trade to the Boston Celtics\n\nBoston Celtics get: Jrue Holiday\n\nPortland Trail Blazers get: Robert Williams, Malcolm Brogdon, 2 1st-round picks\n\nAfter picking up Kristaps Porzingis this past summer, Boston has added another star to team up with Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. Holiday is a massive upgrade from both Marcus Smart and Malcolm Brogdon at the point.\n\nAs for Portland, this has to be seen as a continuation of the Damian Lillard blockuster. The team picks up a top-four protects first-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft (via Golden State) and a young big man to go with the recently acquired Deandre Ayton. The Blazers will also likely flip Brogdon for more assets.\n\nBoston Celtics: A\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: A\n\nDamian Lillard blockbuster trade to the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nMilwaukee Bucks get: Damian Lillard\n\nPhoenix Suns get: Jusuf Nurkic, Grayson Allen, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson\n\nPortland Trail Blazers get: Jrue Holiday, Deandre Ayton, Toumani Camara, 2029 1st-round pick, 2 pick swaps\n\nIn an NBA trade to end all NBA trades heading into the start of the 2023-24 season, the Bucks have given Giannis Antetokounmpo a legitimate star to run with. He now forms one of the best duos, if not the best duo, in the entire Association with two 30-point scorers who do vastly different things on the court. The cost was not cheap with one of the best distributors and on-ball defenders, Jrue Holiday, heading out of town.\n\nAs for the Blazers, we really have no idea how this deal is going to work out moving forward. They are now actively engaging in discussions with other teams about Holiday. That should net general manager Joe Cronin and Co. a lot more in return as part of this package. Until we know what happens there, we have to reserve judgement.\n\nPhoenix’ inclusion in this deal is interesting in that it had Ayton on the block throughout the summer. The team might have just found a better fit in Jurkic with Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal. It also added much-needed depth out on the wing with Allen, Little and Johnson. This seems to be a major win for Suns general manager James Jones.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: A\n\nPhoenix Suns: A\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: INC\n\nPhoenix Suns trade Cam Payne to Spurs, acquire future picks from Magic\n\nPhoenix Suns receive: Future second-round pick\n\nSan Antonio Spurs receive: Cam Payne, future second-round pick\n\nThe Suns also completed a separate trade with the Orlando Magic to help recoup some future draft capital.\n\nPhoenix Suns receive: 3 future second-round picks\n\nOrlando Magic receive: 2026 first-round pick swap with Suns\n\nPatty Mills traded, again\n\nAtlanta Hawks receive: Patty Mills\n\nOklahoma City Thunder receive: TyTy Washington, Usman Garuba, Rudy Gay, second-round pick\n\nPatty Mills keeps racking up the air miles. Traded for the third time in the past ten days, Mills now heads to the Hawks where his perimeter-scoring talents can be on full display. Mills, 34, already has his first NBA championship, coming in 2014 with the San Antonio Spurs, maybe now he can help relay the valuable lessons learned across his 14 NBA seasons with his new teammates in Atlanta.\n\nMeanwhile, the Thunder continue collecting assets. TyTy Washington was the 29th overall pick in last year’s NBA draft but made just 31 appearances as a rookie in Houston. The Hawks have plenty of guards, but Washington is still just 21 years old and has plenty of untapped potential. Garuba is also a former first-round pick who’s still just 21. We’ll see if the 6-foot-8 big can crack the rotation in OKC.\n\nAtlanta Hawks grade: D\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: A-\n\nSuns and Grizzlies swap draft picks in odd trade\n\nPhoenix Suns receive: Three 2nd-round picks\n\nMemphis Grizzlies receive: Isaiah Todd, 2 1st-round pick swaps\n\nPhoenix sent six second-round picks to the Washington Wizards as part of the blockbuster Bradley Beal trade earlier this summer. Using his creativity, Suns general manager James Jones has picked up three second rounders for his troubles.\n\nIn return, the Grizzlies add two future first-round pick swaps from Phoenix. In 2024 and 2030, Memphis will have the right to swap its own first-round pick for the lesser of the Suns and Wizards first rounders. For example, if Memphis has the 28th pick in a given draft with the Suns picking 20 and the Wizards at 10, the Grizzlies will receive the 20th selection. This move gives both teams more versatility moving forward.\n\nPhoenix Suns: A\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: A\n\nGrant Williams headed to Dallas Mavericks in 3-team trade\n\nDallas Mavericks receive: Grant Williams, 2 future 2nd-round picks\n\nSan Antonio Spurs receive: Reggie Bullock, 2030 1st-round pick swap with Dallas\n\nBoston Celtics receive: 2 future 2nd-round picks\n\nIn Williams, Dallas acquires a 24-year-old player who can play three positions. He’s best suited as a three or four moving forward. He averaged 8.1 points and 4.6 rebounds on 40% shooting from three-point range a season ago.\n\nBoston was not going to retain Williams in free agency. For its troubles, the team acquires more draft capital in the form of two future second-round picks. As for San Antonio, it acquires versatility in the NBA draft moving forward.\n\nDallas Mavericks: A\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: B+\n\nBoston Celtics: B\n\nRelated: Sportsnaut’s updated NBA trade rumors\n\nHouston Rockets add Dillon Brooks in sign-and-trade\n\nHouston Rockets receive: Dillon Brooks\n\nMemphis Grizzlies receive: Josh Christopher\n\nOklahoma City Thunder receive: Patty Mills\n\nWith Brooks entering free agency and the Grizzlies reportedly not having interest in retaining the member of the 2022-23 All-Defensive team, the Rockets saw value in the experienced vet. By inking a four-year, $80 million contract with Houston, Brooks can help mentor several young athletes looking to take the next step in their development.\n\nIt’s not 100% clear whether Christopher was included in the sign-and-trade agreement or not. He definitely was traded to the Grizzlies, but whether it was as part of a separate deal is not yet known.\n\nHouston Rockets grade: B\n\nMemphis Grizzlies grade: A-\n\nOklahoma City Thunder grade: B+\n\nLos Angeles Clippers land K.J. Martin from Houston Rockets\n\nLos Angeles Clippers receive: KJ Martin\n\nHouston Rockets receive: Two future second-round picks\n\nAfter adding Amen Thompson with the fourth pick in the NBA draft, the Houston Rockets had an abundance in young talent. It sounds odd, but it’s true. But now they need some veterans like the recently signed Dillon Brooks. So to clear another roster spot, Houston sends Kenyon Martin Jr., who they initially acquired via trade in exchange for a second-round pick back in 2020, for two future picks.\n\nThe Clippers are happy to continue the 22-year-old’s development, and they’ll owe him just $1.9 million this season. Yet, Martin is set for unrestricted free agency in 2024, giving him one year to make a strong impression in L.A. After averaging 12.7 PPG and 5.5 RPG in 28 MPG last season in Houston, Martin’s numbers and minutes figure to take a dip with the Clippers, but he should have no issue earning a role off the bench.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers grade: A-\n\nHouston Rockets grade: B+\n\nNew York Knicks send Obi Toppin to Indiana Pacers\n\nIndiana Pacers receive: Obi Toppin\n\nNew York Knicks receive: 2nd-round picks in 2028 and 2029\n\nWith Julius Randle blocking his chance at a starting role, the Knicks get a couple of future assets for the former first-round pick while sending him to a situation where he’ll have more opportunities.\n\nToppin was heading into the final year of his rookie contract with the Knicks, and it’s hard to envision a scenario where the explosive power forward didn’t find a bigger payday and more floor time elsewhere.\n\nObi Toppin’s stats last season: 7.4 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 44% FG, 34% 3PT\n\nBut with the Pacers, Toppin gets a chance to compete for a starting role with Isaiah Jackson, Jarace Walker, and Oscar Tshiebwe. Still just 25 years old, Toppin has started just 15 games in his career and has yet to receive a role earning more than 17.1 minutes per game. If nothing else, Toppin gets a fresh start with a new coach where a strong first impression could turn into a big payday at the end of the season.\n\nIndiana Pacers grade: A-\n\nNew York Knicks grade: B\n\nMax Strus lands with Cleveland Cavaliers in three-team trade with Miami Heat\n\nMiami Heat receive: Undisclosed second-round pick\n\nSan Antonio Spurs receive: Cedi Osman, Lamar Stevens, second-round pick\n\nCleveland Cavaliers receive: Max Strus\n\nAfter drawing significant interest from the Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat forward Max Strus has agreed to a four-year $63 million contract to join the Cleveland Cavaliers. In order to absorb his new contract more easily, Cleveland swung a three-team trade with the Heat and San Antonio Spurs on Saturday.\n\nIn exchange for taking on Cedi Osman, who the Cavaliers wanted to dump this offseason, San Antonio received a future second-round pick and Lamar Stevens. Miami, already set to lose Strus, receive a future second-round pick by agreeing to the sign-and-trade.\n\nStrus, who shot 35 percent from the perimeter last season and is a career 37.1 percent shooter from beyond the arc, will provide Cleveland with much-needed shooting. The Cavaliers finished the regular season ranked 19th in three-pointers made per game (11.5) and were 13th in perimeter shooting (36.5 percent).\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: A-\n\nMiami Heat: B-\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: B-\n\nAtlanta Hawks bring in two former first-round picks\n\nAtlanta Hawks get: TyTy Washington, Usman Garuba, 2 2nd-round picks\n\nHouston Rockets: Draft rights to Alpha Kaba\n\nNow, this is an odd trade. Houston opted to move off two recent former first-round picks in what is a mere salary dump. In the process, it yields two future second-round picks to Cleveland (2025 and 2028). The team also acquired a 2017 second-round pick in Kaba who will not be suiting up with the team.\n\nAs for Atlanta, it picks up two youngsters for depth. Washington was the No. 29 overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft. The guard averaged 4.7 points on 36% shooting in 31 games as a rookie. Big man Usman Garuba was the 23rd pick in the 2021 NBA Draft. The Spaniard averaged 3.0 points and 4.1 rebounds on 75 games as a sophomore.\n\nDamian Jones sent to Cleveland Cavaliers in salary dump\n\nCleveland Cavaliers get: Damian Jones\n\nUtah Jazz get: To be determined\n\nCleveland has a new backup big man for Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen after bringing in this former first-round pick. Jones averaged 3.5 points and 3.0 rebounds between the Lakers and Jazz a season ago.\n\nAs for Utah, it is simply moving Jones’ $2.59 million contract without acquiring a player in return. This has the Jazz roughly $14 million under the 2023-24 NBA salary cap.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: A\n\nUtah Jazz: A\n\nMonte Morris sent to the Detroit Pistons\n\nDetroit Pistons get: Monte Morris\n\nWashington Wizards get: Future 2nd-round pick\n\nDetroit absorbs yet another contract after picking up Joe Harris from the Brooklyn Nets on the opening day of free agency. It also gets a solid backup point guard for Cade Cunningham as general manager Troy Weaver adds more veterans to a young roster. Morris averaged 10.3 points, 3.4 rebounds and 5.3 assists on 38% shooting from distance in his only season with the Wizards.\n\nFrom Washington’s perspective, the team was point guard heavy before moving off Morris. It acquired Jordan Poole and Tyus Jones in separate trades earlier this offseason.\n\nDetroit Pistons: A\n\nWashington Wizards: C\n\nVictor Oladipo’s contract sent to the Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nMiami Heat get: $9.5 million traded player exception\n\nOklahoma City Thunder get: Victor Oladipo, future draft picks\n\nWe told you to expect every move to be included in our NBA trade tracker. This one doesn’t necessarily move the needle too much, but it does give Miami yet another traded player exception worth $9.5 million.\n\nWe’re not sure what’s headed back to the Thunder. But it’s likely going to be multiple future second-round picks to take on Oladipo’s contract. The former All-Star is expected to miss most of the 2023-24 season after suffering a serious knee injury in the playoffs.\n\nMiami Heat: A\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: A\n\nBrooklyn Nets trade Joe Harris to Detroit Pistons\n\nBrooklyn Nets get: $19.9 million traded player exception\n\nDetroit Pistons get: Joe Harris, 2 future 2nd-round picks\n\nBrooklyn created a whopping $19.9 million traded player exception by moving Harris to the Detroit Pistons. It takes back no cash in return, enabling general manager Sean Marks to create future versatility as the summer progresses. The cost was two future second-round picks and a player who didn’t fit into the Nets’ vision.\n\nAs for Detroit, we’re not 100% sure what’s going on here. Sure, picking up second rounders in 2027 and 2029 is decent. But eating into over half of their cap room to take on Harris’ expiring deal made no sense.\n\nBrooklyn Nets: A+\n\nDetroit Pistons: F\n\nSacramento Kings acquire Chris Duarte\n\nSacramento Kings get: Chris Duarte\n\nIndiana Pacers get: 2nd rounds picks in 2028 and 2030\n\nDuarte, a lottery pick back in 2021, was expendable before being sent to Sacramento. Indiana has a ton of guards who are seemingly ahead of him in the rotation, including Tyrese Haliburton, Bennedict Mathurin, Buddy Hield and T.J. McConnell. Once Indy selected Ben Sheppard in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft, Duarte was likely going to be moved.\n\nFrom Sacramento’s perspective, acquiring a young guard for pennies on the dollar has to be seen as a win. Duarte, 26, averaged 13.1 points and 4.1 rebounds on 37% shooting from distance as a rookie before struggling this past season (37% shooting, 32% 3-point).\n\nPacers: Incomplete\n\nKings: Incomplete\n\nJohn Collins heads to the Utah Jazz\n\nAtlanta Hawks get: Rudy Gay and a future second-round pick\n\nUtah Jazz get: John Collins\n\nAfter months of speculation, the Atlanta Hawks finally pulled the trigger on a long-rumored deal for big man John Collins. Sending the former first-round pick to the Utah Jazz in a trade that only landed them well-aged veteran Rudy Gay and a future second-round pick.\n\nThe move was a true addition-by-subtraction transaction as the Hawks free up a good bit of cap space and move on from a talent they had soured on. For the Jazz, they take a chance on a player that is still only 25 and has a lot of potential. The deal could end up being a steal if head coach Will Hardy can turn his career around like he did fellow former first-round pick Lauri Markkanen last season.\n\nHawks: C\n\nJazz: B\n\nDetroit Pistons acquire first-round pick in draft deal trade\n\nPistons get: 25th pick (Marcus Sasser)\n\nCeltics get: 31st pick, future 2nd-round picks\n\nBoston moved one of the picks it acquired in the Kristaps Porzingis-Marcus Smart deal (below in our NBA trade tracker). In doing so, it picked up the 31st pick and future second-round selections.\n\nAs for the Pistons, they acquire a unanimous 2022-23 All-American in Sasser. The 6-foot-1 shot 38% from distance for Houston last season.\n\nPistons: A\n\nCeltics: B\n\nRichaun Holmes heads to Dallas Mavericks in draft day trade\n\nMavericks get: Richaun Holmes, 24th pick\n\nKings get: traded player exception\n\nSacramento is taking the long game here. It moves off Holmes and his $12.05 million salary for next season while taking on a traded player exception. This potentially sets up a big move for Sacramento, who now has $30 million in cap room.\n\nAs for the Mavericks, they had acquired this exception earlier in the draft via a trade with the Thunder. With the pick, Dallas selected fast rising wing Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Marquette.\n\nKings: A\n\nMavericks: A\n\nDavis Bertans heads to the Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nThunder get: Davis Bertans, 10th pick\n\nMavericks get: 12th pick\n\nDallas did a heck of a job to get out from under Bertans contract as our NBA trade tracker hits a fever pitch. Bertans has $22 million guaranteed remaining on his contract. In doing so, the Mavs move down just two spots.\n\nAs for the Thunder, they add Bertans to the mix with their traded-player exception. Oklahoma City then drafted former Kentucky guard Cason Wallace.\n\nThunder: A\n\nMavericks: A\n\nIndiana Pacers, Washington Wizards pull NBA Draft trade\n\nPacers get: 8th pick (Jarace Walker), 2 2nd-round picks\n\nWizards get: 7th pick (Bilal Coulibaly)\n\nWe’re not exactly sure what the Wizards are doing here. Sure, they acquired several second-round picks in the Bradley Beal and Kristaps Porzingis’ trades. But moving two of them to trade up one spot for a major project didn’t make sense.\n\nAs for Indiana, it is able to acquire a target player while adding two second-round picks to the mix. Pretty solid stuff from the Pacers.\n\nWizards: D\n\nPacers: A\n\nFuture Hall of Famer Chris Paul heads to the Golden State Warriors\n\nWarriors get: Chris Paul\n\nWizards get: Jordan Poole, Ryan Rollins, Patrick Baldwin Jr., 2027 2nd-round pick, 2030 1st-round pick\n\nThis was a very surprising trade for the Golden State Warriors. First off, they need more size. That did not happen in acquiring another point guard to go with Stephen Curry. Secondly, some might believe that the team should’ve gotten more for a young 20-point scorer in Jordan Poole. Even then, Paul gives the Warriors a level hand off the bench at the point. Poole was not that.\n\nFor the Wizards, we have to look at this as an extension of the Bradley Beal trade. They get a potential cornerstone in Poole who helped Golden State to the NBA title in 2022. He will take over the Beal role. Future draft assets only adds to the gold mine Washington received in this blockbuster.\n\nWizards: A+\n\nWarriors: B-\n\nLos Angeles Lakers move up in NBA Draft\n\nLakers get: 40th pick\n\nPacers get: 47th pick and cash\n\nOne of the first notable trades on Thursday ahead of the 2023 NBA Draft saw the Los Angeles Lakers land a second selection in the top 40. The Lakers moved their pick at 47, and cash, to the Indiana Pacers for their selection at 40. Los Angeles now owns picks 17 and 40 in the event.\n\nLakers: B\n\nPacers: B\n\nBoston Celtics add Kristaps Porzingis, lose Marcus Smart to Memphis Grizzlies\n\nCeltics get: Kristaps Porzingis, 25th pick and 2024 1st-round pick\n\nGrizzlies get: Marcus Smart\n\nWizards get: Danilo Gallinari, Mike Muscala, 35th pick\n\nAfter losing in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Boston Celtics once again shake up their roster, this time sending out former Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart in exchange for Kristaps Porzingis to add more size to their frontcourt. But the Celtics also added future assets in a move that helps now and later.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grizzlies add one of the best perimeter defenders in basketball but give up two first-round picks and their reliable backup point guard to do so. Washington just furthers their rebuild, but with Porzingis ready to opt out, the Wizards ran the risk of losing him for nothing at all. Any return at all is a win.\n\nCeltics: A+\n\nGrizzlies: B\n\nWizards: D\n\nDenver Nuggets add first-round pick\n\nNuggets get: 29th and 32nd picks in 2023 NBA Draft\n\nPacers get: 40th pick in 2023 NBA Draft, 2024 1st-round pick\n\nThe defending champion Nuggets did their thing again on the eve of the 2023 NBA Draft, trading back into the first round. This move comes after Denver pulled off a separate trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder during the NBA Finals to acquire more draft capital.\n\nIn short, Denver now has three of the top-37 selections in Thursday’s draft. It can move up even more if that’s what general manager Calvin Booth and Co. decide to do. With veteran wing Bruce Brown opting out of his contract, that could be in the cards.\n\nFor Indiana, the team had five picks in the draft heading in. It now adds a first-round selection in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nNuggets: A\n\nPacers: A\n\nBradley Beal traded to the Phoenix Suns in blockbuster\n\nSuns get: Bradley Beal, Isaiah Todd, Jordan Goodwin\n\nWizards get: Chris Paul, Landry Shamet, 2nd-round picks, pick swaps\n\nWe don’t have the full details of the draft picks and pick swaps heading to Washington in this blockbuster. It’s also highly likely that Paul is rerouted to another team with the Los Angeles Clippers being a likely destination. It’s the start of a rebuild under new front office head Michael Winger in D.C.\n\nFrom the Suns’ perspective, they form a big three with Beal, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker. That’s three players who have averaged well over 25 points over the past three seasons. Though, Phoenix now only has four players under contract for next season.\n\nSuns: A\n\nWizards: C+\n\nDenver Nuggets, Oklahoma City Thunder swap draft picks\n\nNuggets get: 37th pick in 2023 NBA Draft, 2024 first-round pick, 2024 second-round pick\n\nThunder get: 2029 first-round pick\n\nAs far as recent trades go, this one was a bit baffling. Denver pulled it off as the team was on its way to winning the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat. In the process, the Nuggets created a ton of flexibility for the summer months. They now have the 37th and 40th picks in the 2023 NBA Draft. Adding a first and second rounder next year was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe Nuggets are now expected to use these assets as a way to trade into the first round of the NBA Draft. As for Oklahoma City, this deal didn’t make a whole lot of sense. It’s going to be all about the protections included in the pick Denver sent to the Thunder.\n\nNuggets: A+\n\nThunder: D\n\nRelated: Highest-paid NBA players today\n\nNBA trade tracker: 2023 NBA trade deadline deals\n\nHere is a recap of the biggest NBA trades from February’s in-season trade deadline.\n\nKevin Durant goes to the Phoenix Suns in blockbuster\n\nSuns get: Kevin Durant, T.J.
