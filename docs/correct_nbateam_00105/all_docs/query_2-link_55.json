        "text": "Following a disappointing 1999-2000 NBA season, finishing 31-51, the New Jersey Nets got the first overall pick in the 2000 Draft. Collegiate Player of the Year Kenyon Martin was theirs for the taking, making an immediate impact with the Nets the following season.\n\nA fan favorite from day one, K-Mart not only impressed offensively, but put in the work defensively as well, averaging 1.1 steals and 1.7 blocks per game in his rookie season. K-Mart earned all-rookie first team honors while finishing second in Rookie of the Year voting. Martin’s flashy dunks and aggressive defense earned him notoriety around the league.\n\nTurning things around for the Nets\n\nThe Nets went from last to first in the Eastern Conference after Martin’s rookie season, making their way to the franchise’s first NBA Finals appearance. Despite making it to the Finals in back-to-back seasons, the Nets unfortunately could win it all. Nevertheless, Martin continued to give it his all, every night.\n\n\"There was never any question, when that ball went up, whatever time of day it was, whatever the situation, no matter how I was feeling, you knew what you were going to get from me,\" Martin told ESPN in 2015. “Numbers and all of that are cool and people look at that, but you can't put heart on paper.”\n\nFollowing the 2004 season, Martin was traded to Denver, where he initially put up similar numbers to those in New Jersey, but it was different. The chemistry and fire that he and Jason Kidd and the rest of the Nets teams that made it to back-to-back finals simply weren’t there anymore.\n\nEtched in Nets' fans' hearts\n\nLooking back, Kenyon Martin's stint with the Nets was more than just stats on paper. It was a story of relentless effort, electrifying dunks, and a bond with fans that went beyond the game. His grit and defensive prowess left an indelible mark. Though his time was brief, the impact was profound. In the hearts of Nets fans, K-Mart remains a legend, reminding us that passion transcends mere numbers.\n\n\"I wish it could have lasted longer,\" Martin said of his time with Kidd. \"But for that short period of time, I don't think there were two NBA players to do it better.\""
