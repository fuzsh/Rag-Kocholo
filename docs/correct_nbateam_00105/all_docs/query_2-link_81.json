        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers on Monday announced they re-signed forward KJ Martin, acquired during last season as part of a three-team, seven-player deal that sent disgruntled All-Star guard James Harden to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe 76ers did not disclose financial terms, though multiple media reports have Martin agreeing to a two-year, $16 million contract.\n\nMartin, 23, averaged 3.7 points, 2.2 rebounds and 12.3 minutes in 58 games (two starts) for Philadelphia. He also played two games for the Clippers before they dealt him on Nov. 1, 2023, in the trade involving the Oklahoma City Thunder and 76ers.\n\nPhiladelphia also obtained Marcus Morris, Nicolas Batum and Robert Covington, who, like Martin, all had contracts that expired at the end of the season. After becoming a free agent, Martin decided to come back to Philadelphia.\n\nThe son of former NBA All-Star Kenyon Martin, KJ Martin was selected in the second round of the 2020 NBA Draft by the Sacramento Kings. He was traded a week later to the Houston Rockets, where he played from 2020-23, until he was traded to the Clippers. Over four seasons, Martin averaged 8.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 21.7 minutes per game over 266 games (61 starts).\n\nâ€“Field Level Media"
