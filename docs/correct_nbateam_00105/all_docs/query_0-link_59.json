        "text": "Update: The woman, Savannah McMillan-Christmas, is apparently not Martin's stalker. Her father, Chris Christmas, told Spears on Tuesday that Denver police misidentified his daughter. From Yahoo! Sports:\n\nChristmas said he isn't sure why his daughter mentioned Martin's name, but said Denver police told him they mistakenly identified his daughter as Martin's former stalker. Det. John White, a Denver police spokesman, told The Denver Post that police are not aware of any previous incidents involving McMillan-Christmas.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nThe story of the woman that ran onto the court during Game 4 of the first-round NBA Playoffs series between the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Lakers keeps getting weirder. Earlier, TNT's Craig Sager reported that the woman has a history of stalking Nuggets players. Now, according to Marc Spears of Yahoo! Sports, we find out that she was specifically stalking former Nuggets forward Kenyon Martin, now with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe Nuggets are lucky that Martin departed the team following last season. If Martin still was with the squad, things could have turned ugly. As it turned out, she was removed without incident, and play continued mostly uninterrupted."
