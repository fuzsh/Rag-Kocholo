        "text": "[sg-gallery]\n\nWhen the NBA lockout ends—whenever that’ll be—Denver Nuggets forward Kenyon Martin will become an unrestricted free agent. A former No. 1 overall draft pick, Martin’s up-and-down career has been highlighted by several injuries, so it wasn’t a shock the Nuggets declined to give him a contract extension this past season. With his future in Denver in limbo, Martin has gone ahead and posted his house for sale. But because Martin’s pad is under contract, REMAX’s Nick Evancich, the agent handling the listing, has declined to reveal the sale price.\n\nAbove are several pictures of Martin’s crib, along with a video-tour of the house. CelebrityDetective.com, which originally shared the photos, claims K-Mart wanted to make $3.2 million on the transaction, while the YouTube video of the property lists $2.6 million in the description and $2.4 million in the actual title. So, yeah, no one knows how much the asking price is. What we do know: Kenyon Martin will be a free agent when the league resumes, and if this is any indication, he may be on his way out of Denver."
