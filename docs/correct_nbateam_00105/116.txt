Kenyon Martin, nicknamed “K-Mart,” is a former professional basketball player who played 15 seasons in the NBA. The 6-foot-9 power forward played college basketball for Cincinnati before being drafted as the first overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft by the New Jersey Nets. K-Mart’s NBA career would involve playing for the New Jersey Nets, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks; being named to the 2001 NBA All-Rookie First Team and the 2004 NBA All-Star Team; and a contribution to the International Basketball Federation in 2011 as part of the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of China. In 2016, K-Mart would officially retire from the NBA, and he worked as an NBA analyst for ESPN and Fox Sports. Shortly after, Kenyon was the first player to join Ice Cube’s BIG3 Basketball League as Player/Captain of Trilogy, who would go on to be the league's inaugural champions.
