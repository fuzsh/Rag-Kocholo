Nikola Jokic seems poised to represent the Denver Nuggets in the All-Star Game next month, but former Nuggets big man Kenyon Martin feels that Denver could actually have three All-Stars:

“I don’t know how many All-Stars they would get, but (among) guys that deserve it, they probably could have three,” said Martin, according to Sean Keeler of The Denver Post.

As for which two Nuggets Martin feels should accompany Jokic? Guards Gary Harris and Jamal Murray:

“They play an integral part, with what they’ve been doing,” said Martin. “The season ebbs and flows, but … they definitely deserve it. Will it happen? You never know. (With) voters … it’s just tricky. Coaches voting on it is tricky. It’s tricky, man. You never know. But who knows? But (are they) deserving of that? Yeah … they’re playing well, can only get better. If they keep it together and guys continue to get better and grow. You’ve got guys that haven’t played yet: Isaiah (Thomas) and Michael Porter. So just imagine. Then you add some of that caliber of talent to the mix, it can only get better. Guys buy into just winning not ego, (it) could be great.”

Martin should probably slow his roll a bit.

While Harris and Murray have certainly been impressive, they have not been good enough to make the All-Star team, regardless of how impressive Denver has been as a team this season.

The Nuggets currently own a record of 31-14 and sit in second place in the Western Conference standings.
