        "text": "These profound words, articulated by Shimon Peres (former President of Israel), encapsulates the sentiment in this country right now. I had pleasure of seeing the legend, now a 92 year old, address an elated crowd at the TEDx White City event in Tel Aviv last month. It was extraordinary to witness his positive spirit and even more poignant now, during the current wave of violence that has been plaguing the region.\n\nThe past month or so in Israel has been challenging. Calls for a near intifada have circulated, and my personal level of safety was put at compromise. You may read this in Australia and ponder, why would one consciously choose to live in a reality like this? Fast forward a few weeks and I receive the news that my father living in a relatively quiet neighbourhood in Melbourne, was attacked by two young boys outside our family home. So I sit back, totally flabbergasted by what happened to my dad, whilst sipping a latte at my favourite coffee shop in Jaffa, and consider… is it really that much more dangerous to live in Israel?\n\nTo be an Israeli is to live with this feeling of ‘survivability’ and this is the key to understanding the utter success of this amazing start-up nation. Israel is testament to the proof of how throughout difficult times, one strives harder in order to survive. In the backdrop of a political quagmire, the care in the streets for one another is a feeling that cannot be expressed.\n\nFor example, I was riding my bike through the gushing rain a few weeks back, at night, a random girl standing next to me at the traffic light turned to me and said, “please come under the umbrella with me so you don’t get even more wet”. I walk home another night and see thousands of people running through the streets for the augural ‘Nike Tel Aviv Night Run’, during a time where they say it’s not so safe to be out. The positive attitude in Israel is is mind-blowing.\n\nPeople live on, try not to focus on the prevailing attacks and rather choose to revert their attention to create the next big ‘Waze’, to be bought out by Google.\n\nTEDX WHITE CITY TEL AVIV\n\nIsrael has also taken to the exciting movement known as ‘TED’. My first TED event was at Burning Man last year, so it I was pretty enthused to be attending another one in my beloved Tel Aviv! Along with some friends, I spent a full day on the Tel Aviv Port listening to numerous speakers pitch an idea for 20 minutes. From a freelance photographer, Middle Eastern Social Media expert, a talk about ‘making politics sexy’ an amazing initiative called TOM – Which Stands for Tikkun Olam (saving the world) Makers and so much more. It was an insightful day and everybody in the hall left with a feeling of hope for this country. Hope through innovation….\n\nWORKING AT THE AICC\n\nThe past month I have had the pleasure of working at the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, under the amazing Paul Israel. In preparation for the Young Entrepreneurs Innovation Mission, I had been manoeuvring from coffee shop to coffee shop, meeting to meeting, to assist in organising the best possible experience for the amazing delegation that were about the come. Little did I know what I was in for, or the opportunity that was presented to me…\n\nTHE MISSION\n\nPeople were arriving, meetings were prolific and the energy was rising in Tel Aviv.\n\nBefore the Mission had officially begun I had the honour of accompanying Tim Smith, member for Kew (in Victoria), to meetings in the Israeli Knesset (Parliament). It was an afternoon to remember. It turned out that MK Oded Forer’s father was from the same small village as my grandparents in Poland called Bendzin. Yoav Kischh, MK, had to run out of our meeting mid-way to vote alongside Bibi (Israeli Prime Minister). We also met 31 year old Sharren Hassel – impressive young lady, who had lived in Australia and felt a strong connection to our country and making a difference.\n\nDay one started shopping at Zara, putting on my ‘sales assistant hat’ and helping some of the delegates find appropriate clothes due to some ‘luggage problems’. We visited Pitango, one of Israel’s top Venture Capital (VC) fund, and attention was grabbed by Chemi Peres, Managing General Partner and Co-Founder, also the son of Simon Peres. “Be optimistic long term with technology not short term. ”he advised.\n\nWe had drinks that night at the Ambassador of Australia’s home in Hertzliya filled with interesting guests and a topical speaker. I had a fun night out with some of the gang, visiting a favourite bar of mine, Kuli Alma, and giving them of taste of this electric city.\n\nWe were up bright and early the next morning heading south for the commemoration of the 98th Battle of Be’er Sheva- the site where the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) gave their lives in 1917 for a ‘better world’. I had shivers standing here so many years later, and singing both the Australian and Israel anthem, back-to back, alongside delegates, diplomats, family members and other Australians & New Zealanders who had made the trip for this important occasion.\n\nFollowing the service, we then make our way to the golden city of Jerusalem, to grab some lunch and a quick tour before the Shabbat came in. We visited the Great Synagogue and have a beautiful dinner at our hotel, where the guests learned about the Jewish traditions and enjoyed a delicious Shabbat meal.\n\nBack on the bus the next morning, this time to visit the breathtaking Masada followed by the ever so enjoyable Dead Sea.\n\nIt was highly entertaining floating with 40 people on a gorgeous Autumn’s day. What was not so riveting was filling my face with mud and stupidly rinsing off in the salty water. Not recommended!\n\nReturning back to Jerusalem, we joined a rowdy gang of Aussies and Kiwis at the UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organization) to watch the Rugby World Cup. Whilst most were cheering enthusiastically, I got into some heated political conversations (perhaps it was Israeli beer talking).\n\nSunday morning was heavy at Yad Vashem (Holocaust Memorial), with an unforgettable ceremony at the Hall of Remembrance.\n\nWe then visited Hebrew University and had a sensational dinner at the Moroccan favourite Darna, where Saul Singer, author of the famous Start Up Nation gave us an address. A highly engaged crowd listened to him talk about how complimentary Australia is to Israel and conversations were brewing as a result.\n\nOther highlights of the week included; an exciting visit to Teva Pharmaceuticals, a visit to Technion, one of Israel’s most prestigious universities specialising in technology and science, and sitting at a board table listening to Avi Hason, Israel’s Chief Scientist,“Inventions don’t matter, entrepreneurship does”. His wise words got me thinking. Any of us can have an idea, but if you don’t implement it is just a concept,right? One thing Israelis know how to do too well is to deliver. The final reception at Bank Leumi was inspiring with lots of great networking for all. The night kicked on at a Georgian hot spot – Nanuchka, and if you have visited this spot, need I say more!\n\nThe final day, we listened to two entrepreneurs speak from WMN – a co-working space for women entrepreneurs, which exists to bridge the gender gap in the startup ecosystem. Totally inspiring!\n\nWe had a stimulating lunch at one of the top Israeli law firms, Yigal Arnon and left with a brief understanding of the tech industry from a legal perspective.\n\nWe ended off at South Tel Aviv’s coolest co-working space SOSA, and had the most meaningful end to the delegation on the rooftop, whereby each participant and staff member had their 2 minutes of fame to talk about their personal experience.\n\nWyatt Roy the Assistant Minister of Innovation in Australia and co-leader of the delegation alongside Marita Cheng (Robogals), conveyed in the in Times of Israel, “I think Australia and Israel are a more natural partnership than Australia and Silicon Valley. We both have strong anti-authoritarian streaks, ‘chutzpah’ and ‘rosh gadol’ (thinking big)”.\n\nUndoubtedly, a hugely successful mission for both Israel and Australia.\n\nWORK HARD, PLAY HARD\n\nWhilst it has been a crazy month or so of work with the chamber, I have also managed to have my own sort of fun too. Visits from friends, wining and dining, Shabbat with the diplomats from around the world, Brit Milla (circumcision) party, hosting meals on my rooftop and a sneaky night out here and there, because I am living in the city that never sleeps.\n\nOne weekend, my friends and I set up camp on the beach in Maayan Zvi, an hour north of Tel Aviv. It was sensational! We set up on the sand; lay in the still, cool sea as the sun went down; gathered wood for the campfire and welcomed in the Shabbat. Dinner was a traditional ‘Poike’ which is a stew cooked in a round cast iron over a hot flame. Ingredients include potatoes, vegetables, rice, chicken, wine, beer, coca cola, rice, almonds and more. The two-hour participation was well worth the wait.\n\nOn the way back to Tel Aviv we stopped off in Furedeis, an Arab village with mouth watering humus.\n\nFor yet another meaningful Shabbat, friends and I threw a feast for my friend’s birthday in Tel Aviv – giving Yotam Ottelenghi a sure run for his money. Research for the meal included a thrilling food shop, dancing in the puddles of rain in Carmel Market. We sung the welcomed in Shabbat with a makeshift service in the Kerem Hatermanim (Yemen Quarter) and stayed up matching wine with political debates until 4:30am, with the most diverse bunch of Melbournians.\n\nTHANK YOU\n\nAmanda’s Jerusalem (or shall I say Israel Journey) had ended for now, I will return very soon to continue working and living in this miraculous country. As the lady at the airport said to me upon attempting to get my V.A.T. back, “I am sorry, you are not a tourist”. I smile, thank her for the compliment and continue on my way.\n\nI have decided to end my series of blog posts here for now, with a few final thoughts..\n\nFirstly, I challenge each one of you who has a passion or idea to write a blog. It has enriched my experience and enabled me to connect to people on a level I would not have dreamed possible. I would like to thank my editors, Noah Picholtz and Natasha Gammell for guiding me; correcting my sentences, some of which simply didn’t make sense, and adding your extra touch to each piece. To my loyal readers, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for coming on this journey with me. For the comments, messages and conversations it has sparked, I am grateful. Please continue to send them through (or if you are in Melbourne hit me up for a coffee).\n\nIsrael is a country that just keeps giving. If you have learnt a thing or two from my posts, know not to be fooled by the often misleading comments in the media, instead focus on the astronomical success of this tiny country.\n\nMore than the holiness of this place, the rich history, the chutzpah in the streets and and the intensity that sometimes prevails – what makes the state of Israel so unique and special are the incredible people that fight every single day for its mere existence!\n\nI sign off to you now from Ben Gurion Airport. Filled with mixed emotions, I am about to surprise my family and friends in Melbourne who have no idea I am coming home (I have since learned that I cannot try and trick my mother as she is always one step ahead). My final week was magical, YES, another Shabbat on my rooftop, goodbye drinks with friends and visit to extended family members here who I adore.\n\nI encourage you to stop focusing on war and blame when you read about Israel, because as Steve Jobs so famously put it, “Innovation is the only way to win”.\n\nAJJ’s Tips of the week:"
