Danziger\n\nHis Honor, Justice N. Hendel\n\nHis Honor, Justice E. Rubinstein\n\nHis Honor, Justice S. Joubran\n\nHer Honor, Justice E. Hayut\n\nHis Honor, Justice U. Vogelman\n\nThe Appellants: 1. State of Israel, Courts Administration\n\n2. Supervisor under Freedom of Information Law in the Courts Administration\n\nv.\n\nThe Respondents: 1. TheMarker – HaAretz Newspaper Ltd.\n\n2. Hila Raz, Journalist, “TheMarker”\n\nAppeal against the judgment of the Administrative Affairs Court in Jerusalem on April 14, 2011, in AP 43366-03-10 by Her Honor President M. Arad\n\nDate of Session: Tevet 5, 5773 (December 18, 2012)\n\nOn behalf of the Appellants: Adv. S. Rotshenkar\n\nOn behalf of the Respondents: Adv. P. Moser\n\nJudgment\n\nJustice (Ret.) E. Arbel\n\nThe Administrative Affairs Court in Jerusalem (Hon. President M. Arad) ordered appellant no. 1, the Courts Administration, to hand over to the respondents, TheMarker newspaper and the journalist Hila Raz, for their scrutiny, information concerning the number of open cases being heard in the Supreme Court and in the district courts before every judge; and also the length of time that has elapsed since each case was opened. In every case, the name of the judge was to be mentioned. Before us is an appeal on this judgment.\n\nDoes the public’s right to information by virtue of the Freedom of Information Law, 5758-1998 (hereinafter: the “Law” or the “Freedom of Information Law”)­—by means of the newspaper TheMarker — also apply to the requested information that concerns open cases in the district courts and the Supreme Court, with the names of the judges hearing the cases being identified? This is the question upon which we must decide in this appeal.\n\nBackground\n\n1. On August 18th 2009, respondent no. 2, journalist Hila Raz, submitted a request to appellant no. 2, the supervisor for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Law in the Courts Administration, to obtain information under that Law, as specified in a list that was submitted together with the request. The information was sought “in light of the supreme public importance with respect to the burden imposed upon the courts system.” A response to the request was sent by appellant no. 2 on December 14, 2009, noting that he had the information that was sought with respect to two of the items: “quantitative information about the number of open cases being heard by each district court judge in the country and the justices of the Supreme Court” as well as “information about the length of time that has elapsed since the opening of each of the principal open cases.” Despite this, on February 3, 2010 respondent no. 2 received a letter from Adv. Barak Lazar, professional advisor to appellant no. 1, which stated as follows:\n\nThe number of cases assigned to a judge does not constitute a measure of the case load. Court cases are differentiated from each other according to the type of matter (civil, criminal, administrative), the bench before which the proceedings are conducted (a bench of three or a single judge) and the complexity of the legal dispute. Therefore, presentation of the details of the number of cases assigned to each judge would provide a misleading representation, attesting to nothing, save the numerical assignment of anonymous cases to a judicial functionary.\n\nThe presentation of data that reflects a true index of burden requires the development of a tool for classification of cases which takes into account the time and the resources allocated to each and every case; the purpose of this is to create a basis for comparison.\n\nIn the past, an attempt involving extensive research was made to develop such a tool. Several flaws were discovered in this research, which prevent effective use of the tool that was developed. At the present time, we are making plans to conduct complementary research and to develop the said tool for assessing case-load, especially in view of the relevancy of that information for improving efficiency in the courts. Clearly such complementary research cannot be carried out in the time allocated to us for the purpose of responding to the request that has been submitted pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law.\n\nThis is also the case with respect to data concerning the length of a case’s lifetime. Production of such data requires an analysis of the database in the system, which is conducted by external factors and involves substantial costs.\n\nRespondent no. 2 also referred to the half-yearly report and the Freedom of Information Report published by appellant no. 1; these are public reports that include quantitative information about pending cases, cases that have been closed and cases that were opened in Israeli courts, as well as data concerning the average lifetime of a case in the courts system. There is no dispute between the parties about the fact that the information included in these reports does not fully correspond to the information requested by respondent no. 2. After a further attempt of the respondents to obtain information from the appellants was not successful, an administrative petition was filed.\n\nThe Judgment of the Administrative Court\n\n2. The District Court granted the petition. First, the appellants’ argument that delivering the information would necessitate an unreasonable allocation of funds was rejected. The Court determined that the appellants possess the requested information, and that its delivery involves the production of a computer report and does not require the allocation of substantial resources. The Court noted that the respondents did not request anything beyond the specified information, and that they did not ask that it be processed for them. The Court therefore rejected the appellants’ argument that because the number of open cases does not reflect the judge’s case-load, complex research, requiring an unreasonable allocation of funds, would be necessary, in order to produce data that could serve as an index of overload.\n\nThe appellants’ argument that making the information available to the respondents was liable to disrupt the functioning of the Authority was also rejected. It was mentioned that this reservation to the obligation of disclosure applied, in accordance with the case law, only where there was near certainty of serious interference with the functioning of the Authority, and that the anticipated interference had to be “grave and serious” (AAA 398/07 Movement for Freedom of Information v. State of Israel – Tax Authority [2008] IsrSC 63(1) 284 (hereinafter: Tax Authority), at p. 346). However, the Court found that the argument that publication of the information would lead, with a high degree of certainty, to real interference with the functioning of the court system was not substantiated. The argument that the court system would have to provide complementary explanations with respect to an enormous number of cases for the information to serve as an index of the overload was also dismissed. It was made clear that public criticism that is liable to arise against the Authority as a result of publication of the information does not constitute the sort of “disruption” in the functioning of the Authority that would justify refusal to disclose the information. The Court was aware of the fact that the requested information could not serve as an index of the burden borne by the court or by judges, and of the fact that negligent reporting making use of this information would be baseless and misleading. However, it was decided that concealing information was not the way to deal with biased or unsubstantiated publications, and that judges could be presumed to perform their work faithfully even if a misleading article were to be published. It was also noted that it should not be assumed that the respondents, or any other body, would misuse the information, or that any publication would be issued without first receiving the reaction of the courts administration.\n\nThe argument that making information available was liable to harm public confidence in the judges and in the legal system was dismissed, and it was noted that precisely the opposite is true. The concern expressed by the appellants about harm to the efforts of the courts system to improve and become more efficient was dismissed as being too speculative. The concern about increased complaints and requests to recuse judges, or about attempts at “forum shopping” after publication of the information, was also found to be baseless. It was therefore found that handing over the information would not disrupt the functioning of the Authority, and that, in any event,there is no near certainty of serious interference with its functioning which would justify non-disclosure of the information.\n\n3. The Court did not accept the appellants’ argument that the information about the stock of cases, segmented according to judge, falls within the category of “information about the content of a judicial proceeding” (sec. 2 of the Law), which was excluded from the application of the Law. It was decided that information about the number of cases being handled by a judge and the date on which they were opened is administrative information, and the provisions of the Interpretation Law (1981) should not be used in a manner that broadens the scope of information that is not to be available to the public.\n\n4. The attempt of the appellants to base themselves on the legal situation pertaining in other countries, too, was unsuccessful, after the Court determined that it is unnecessary to resort to foreign law where the Israeli law was explicitly applied to the courts system; furthermore, it was held that the comparative law that was cited did not clearly support the appellants’ position.\n\n5. The Court clarified that its conclusion was applicable, both in relation to the Supreme Court and to the district courts. It ruled that in the framework of the information handed over, it was possible to mark the year that the case was opened, but there was no requirement to provide such information for cases that had not yet been assigned to a judge, since the information that had been requested was “per judge”. As for the Supreme Court, in which cases are not immediately assigned to a justice upon being opened, it was pointed out that it is possible to publish the requested information with respect to cases that had been assigned to a judge or a panel, together with details of the date on which the case was so assigned, in order to ensure delivery of information that was as complete as possible.\n\nThe State is appealing the judgment of the Administrative Affairs Court.\n\n6. Before we review and discuss the pleadings of the parties, it should be mentioned that on July 12, 2011, this Court (Justice H. Melcer) order a stay of execution of the judgment of the Administrative Affairs Court. On December 19, 2011, this Court ([then] Justices A. Grunis and M. Naor, and Justice U. Vogelman) ordered a continuation of the hearing on the appeal before an expanded bench, by virtue of its authority under sec. 26(2) of the Courts Law [Consolidated Version] 5744-1984. On 18 December 2012 the pleadings of the parties were heard before the expanded panel.\n\nPleadings of the Appellants\n\n7. The appellants opened their pleadings with a clarification that in a letter of appellant no. 2 dated December 14, 2009, he agreed to deliver the quantitative information that had been requested, but he expressed no intention of delivering the information together with exposure of the identities of the judges. Appellants contend that Adv. Laizer’s letter was sent only when it became clear that respondent no. 2 would not be satisfied with information that did not include the names of the judges.\n\n8. On the merits, the appellants’ opinion is that they are under no obligation to hand over the requested information, in accordance with sec. 9(b)(1) of the Freedom of Information Law, which deals with non-delivery of information whose disclosure is liable to disrupt the proper functioning of the public authority or its ability to carry out its duties. They argue that delivering personal information about the performance of the judges is liable to harm the principles on which the orderly functioning of the courts system relies—public confidence and judicial independence. This, they say, would nearly certainly interfere with the functioning of the system. The appellants explained at length what constitutes interference with the proper functioning of the system, which they claim is liable to ensue if the requested information is handed over. They say that the requested data itself cannot create a complete and reliable picture that will attest to efficiency or overload, neither of the system as a whole, nor of the individual judge. Thus, for example, they explained that there are various features that impact significantly on the input and the time required to conduct proceedings, which are not reflected in the quantitative data that was requested.\n\n9. The appellants contend that a distinction must be made, in the context of the Freedom of Information Law, between institutional and personal information. In their view, the purpose of the Law is to create transparency with respect to the activities of the public authority, which bears systemic responsibility for the nature of the service that is provided for the citizen and for the employment of its workers; therefore, concretization of the requested information and its connection to a particular worker is not necessarily justified. It was further argued that connecting the requested information to a particular worker is liable to harm the worker’s reputation and to harm public confidence him, for it contains elements of imposing liability for the ills of the system on the worker. It was explained that the worker cannot protect his reputation in public. The appellants believe that it cannot be assumed that the worker’s functioning will be unaffected if he is publicly tried on the basis of purely quantifiable parameters which do not accurately reflect the quality of his work and its nature. It was also argued that impugning an individual in public on the basis of incomplete and misleading information will affect the ability of the public system to recruit the finest candidates into its ranks. In conclusion it was pointed out that delivery of personal information, particularly when it does not present a complete picture, involves greater potential for misuse of the information than a situation in which “systemic” information is handed over.\n\n10. The appellants believe that the above arguments hold even more so in relation to the judiciary, and for the purpose of maintaining public confidence in it and for its independent functioning. They claim that publication of personal statistical information that is misleading will lead to contempt for the judges, which may affect public confidence in them, as well as to the conduct of “kangaroo courts” which will harm the regular functioning of the judges. It was stressed that in order to fulfill the goals of the judicial system, there must be assurance that, despite the complexity of the arena in which the judge operates, his considerations will always be relevant and that his decisions will be of a high quality.\n\n11. In the appellants’ opinion, the balance between the principle of independence and public confidence. on the one hand, and the public interest in oversight of an authority that acts as a public trustee on the other, should be achieved in a manner that allows for effective oversight of the judicial system without causing the aforementioned potential harm. In their pleadings, the appellants enumerated the various frameworks in which oversight of the legal system is possible. They also pointed to the presently existing mechanisms for maintaining the personal and professional independence of judges and their public standing. The appellants also refer to the position adopted by Professor Segal, according to which the appropriate solution is to publish the information without attaching the names of the judges (Ze’ev Segal, The Right to Know in Light of the Freedom of Information Law (2000), 143-144 [hereinafter: Segal]). It was further claimed that the issue of the appropriate balance between the interest of preserving judicial independence and the judges’ duty to report was discussed and decided by the legislator in the framework of the Ombudsman for Complaints against Judges Law, 2002 (hereinafter: Ombudsman’s Law). According to the Ombudsman’s Law, the work of the Ombudsman’s Office is protected by a statutory duty of confidentiality, and the reports that it publishes do not indicate the names of the judges against whom complaints have been lodged. The appellants argue that an analogy should be drawn from that arrangement to our matter.\n\nAccording to the appellants, in the balance between the need to maintain the independence of the judiciary and public confidence therein and other important interests, to the extent that the matter is one of information that relates to the functioning of a worker in a personal manner, the stricter standard of near certainty should not be applied, and proving a “reasonable basis for concern” or “reasonable possibility of harm to justice”, should suffice, due to the sensitivity of the concrete information. In this context, reference was made to case law that established the standard of “reasonable possibility” for the purpose of balancing between freedom of information and the interest of ensuring that justice be done by the judiciary. They referred specifically to CrimA 126/62 Dissenchik & Hon v. Attorney General [1963] IsrSC 17 169 (hereinafter: Dissenchik), and to CrimA 696/81 Azulai v. State of Israel [1983] IsrSc 37(2) 565 (hereinafter: Azulai).\n\n12. The appellants explain that in order to amend the data with explanations, a very sizeable allocation of resources will be required of them. Moreover, they think that such information which is capable of explaining the statistical-technical data. “encroaches” on the area of judicial discretion in the conduct of cases—and such information was excluded from the application of the Freedom of Information Law.\n\n13. The appellants maintain that, considering that the information was sought for the sake of the public interest in pointing out the burden imposed upon the courts system, these goals of examining the information can still be achieved if the information is handed over to the respondents with the information segmented according to judge, without mentioning individual names. According to them, this is a good legal solution, compatible with the provisions of sec. 11 of the Freedom of Information Law.\n\nPleadings of the Respondents\n\n14. The respondents explained that publishing information about the activities of public authorities, including the judiciary, is part of their occupation in the area of communications and journalism; therefore, failure to hand over the information infringes upon their freedom of occupation. They stressed the public’s right to know about the judiciary, and explained that their goal was not to besmirch judges, and that prior to each publication, the response of appellant no. 1 would be sought.\n\n15. The respondents complained that their request was rejected in the letter of Adv. Laizer, who is not the authorized party for matters of freedom of information on the part of appellant no. 1; and this only a few months after appellant no. 2 notified them that the information would be delivered. They also pointed out that in the statements of pleadings, appellants claimed that producing the requested information involves an unreasonable allocation of resources, which is likely to disrupt the orderly functioning of the authority. However, when the Court ordered the appellants to submit an affidavit concerning the estimated cost of carrying out this task, it emerged that the computer program used by the appellants enables the data to be produced without any unreasonable allocation of resources. Despite this, the appellants performed an about-face and raised new arguments in support of their refusal to deliver information.\n\n16. The respondents contend that the information they are requesting is not information about the “content[s] of a judicial proceeding”, but rather, information about the administrative side of the legal system, which falls within the rule of disclosure under the Law. According to them, in order to fall within the exception to the delivery of information under sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law, the appellants would have had to prove that disclosure of the information would cause disruption in the functioning of the Authority, with a high degree of certainty, of real, severe harm. Such proof was not forthcoming. They object to the appellants’ argument that in matters concerning the judiciary, a lenient criterion of “reasonable possibility of harm” should be applied, and they stress that this was raised only in the appellants’ summations. Moreover, they are of the opinion that the case law on which the appellants sought to rely is based on the assumption that disclosure of the requested information involves harm to the pursuit of justice or the purity of the legal process, which was not the case here. They say that there is no place for the concern that the judge will not be able to withstand criticism relating to his performance, for exposure to such criticism is an intrinsic part of his judicial role. It was claimed that the judiciary acquires the confidence of the public, in part due to its transparency, and that, regardless, this confidence is liable to be harmed by the revelation of information about case overload. According to the respondents, the fact that the requested information cannot serve as an index of the burden borne by the court, or by a particular judge, cannot justify its being withheld.\n\nThe respondents are also of the opinion that the Ombudsman’s Law has no relevance for the matter at hand, and that the distinction the appellants wished to draw between systemic information and personal information has no statutory basis.\n\nDeliberations\n\n17. The appeal before us is unlike other appeals under the Freedom of Information Law. If, until now, appeals under this Law dealt with the implementation of the Law on the part of other authorities, the present appeal is concerned with the implementation of the Law by the courts system, and we, who are an integral part of that system, are being asked to decide the matter, In doing so we are bound, as in every appeal under the Freedom of Information Law, by the provisions of the Law, which must provide the guidance for the path we take, joined by professional discretion, conscience, and the sense of justice. In making such a determination we are obliged, naturally, to be doubly and triply cautious, and it has often been said in the past by President Barak that “when we sit in judgment, we are being judged” (Aharon Barak, “Law and Judgment”, Selected Writings 1 (5760-2000); Aharon Barak, “Speech in the Supreme Court on his Retirement from the Bench”, Mishpatim 38 (1) 3, at pp. 10-11 (5768-2008) (hereinafter: Barak, “Retirement”).\n\n18. Let me state from the outset, in brief, that my conclusion, after having examined the pleadings of the parties and all the material relevant to the subject, is that respondents have a right to obtain the requested information, and that the appellants have not succeeded in showing that the interference with the activities of the courts as a result of the publication, as they claim, is a near certainty. I found that the information that was requested is in essence administrative information, to which the Freedom of Information Law applies; in other words, this is information to which the public has a right of access. In my view, the public interest in the information also emerges from the identity of the parties: on one end, the courts system, a public authority, whose influence on the lives of the individual and whose effect in shaping these lives is substantial, and knowledge of whose activity there is a clear public interest, whereas on the other end the fact that the information was sought by people from the media who are interested in the information for the purpose of fulfilling their journalistic function, and whose activity is extremely important in the realization of freedom of expression of the public and the fashioning of a civilized society. As stated, I did not find that the appellants could invoke the exception to the publication of information under sec. 9(b)(1) of the Freedom of Information Law, which deals with interference with the functioning of the authority. The activity of the courts is characterized by transparency that is not only systemic: it also involves personal transparency in relation to the judges trying the cases, which exposes them, even today, to harsh public criticism. This being the case, it is difficult to accept the argument that publication of the requested data will detract from the judicial independence of judges, to their functioning and to public confidence in them. As I will show, even if it is not possible to rule out the possibility of the consequences against which the appellants warn, such as harm to the esteem which judges have been accorded or misuse of the information, many of the arguments raised in this context are conjectural, focusing on cases of callous, litigious reporting, which is the exception rather than the rule. These arguments do not attribute the appropriate weight to the right of the public to know about the judiciary and the possibility that most of the reporting will be neutral, or at least fair. I found that appropriate weight must be attributed to the high standard of conduct that is expected of a judge, as well as to the fortitude required from a person selected to fulfill a judicial function and who is expected to rule according to the law, even when faced with enormous pressure. When one takes into account the transparency characterizing the activity of the courts, including in weighty cases that involve substantive matters, it is difficult to justify not according the same treatment to quantitative data concerning the activity of the system. I believe that transparency on this matter, too, will only strengthen confidence in the system. The position taken by the appellants seeks to create a different attitude to courts vis-à-vis other governmental authorities that were made subject to the Freedom of Information Law. I did not find—even given the distinctive nature of the judicial function—that any reasons were given that would warrant such a differentiation.\n\n19. The subject under discussion includes within its purview various rights and interests, some in concert, some in conflict. All of them are worthy of representation, while above them hovers the spirit of the Freedom of Information Law, the purpose of which is to “help promote social values, including equality, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and also to allow more efficient oversight of the public of the acts of the government” (Freedom of Information Bill, 5757-1997). In our matter, on the one hand stand the rights of the public to know and to obtain information about the modes of action of the public authority—and in this case, the courts—as well as the right of the public to oversee the governmental authorities; and on the other hand, the status, mode and orderly functioning of the courts and the judges. This interest is seemingly independent, but it incorporates weighty rights in our system such as the right to due process. The place of the value of human dignity, of the dignity of the judge and the right not to be put to shame and not to be denigrated should not be ignored, but neither should the dignity of the system, which is essential for ensuring its proper functioning. These are the topics that I shall discuss.\n\nI will begin with the normative framework within which the discussion will be conducted – the Freedom of Information Law.\n\nThe Normative Framework – the Freedom of Information Law\n\n20. The Freedom of Information Law developed from the right to examine documents held by a public authority. In the evolution of the right to examine, Israeli law first recognized a private right of examination—the right of the individual to view the documents held by an administrative authority and which were used in the making of a decision which concerned him (HCJ 142/70 Shapira v. Jerusalem District Committee of the Israel Bar Association [1971] IsrSC 28(1) 325 (hereinafter: Shapira); HCJ 337/66 Estate of Kalman Fital v. Assessment Committee, Holon Municipality [1967] IsrSC 21(1) 69 (hereinafter: Fital), at p. 71; CA 6926/93 Israel Shipyards v. Israel Electric Corporation [1994] IsrSC 48(3) 749, at p. 796; AAA 8282/02; HaAretz Newspaper Ltd. v. State of Israel, Office of the State Comptroller [2003] IsrSC 58(1) 465 (hereinafter: HaAretz), at p. 469). This right, which is one of the foundations of the democratic regime, is derived from the right to be heard and from the duty of the public administration to act in a transparent fashion (LCA 291/99 D.N.D. Jerusalem Stone Supply v. V.A.T. Director [2004] IsrSC 58(4) 221 (hereinafter: Jerusalem Stone), at p. 232). Its source is in the case law, in that it is one of the principles of natural justice (Fital, at p. 72).\n\nA significant development occurred in 1998, with the enactment of the Freedom of Information Law and recognition of the right of the individual to view documents held by the authority, even where there is no personal interest in the information, and subject to the exceptions prescribed by the Law (Segal, p. 11; Tax Authority; HaAretz, at p. 472; Explanatory Notes to the Bill). Our interest, therefore, is in the public right of inspection.\n\n21. The right of the individual to obtain information about the activities of the governmental authorities “is one of the cornerstones of a free society” (AAA 9135/03 Council for Higher Education v. HaAretz Newspaper [2006] IsrSC60(4) 217 (hereinafter: Council for Higher Education), at p. 233. See also Jerusalem Stone, at pp. 232-33); “The foundations of democratic culture” (sec. 15 of my opinion in AAA 9341/05 Movement for Freedom of Information v. Government Corporations Authority [Nevo – May 19, 2009] (hereinafter: Government Corporations). It is “a preliminary condition for the realization of other rights, and a basis upon which, in a democratic society, it is possible to build a culture of rights” (Aharon Barak, “Freedom of Information and the Court”, Kiryat Hamishpat 3 (5763-2003) 95, 97 (hereinafter: Barak, “Freedom of Information”). The right to obtain information is based on the conception of a governmental authority as a public trustee. As a public trustee, the administrative authority is held to a standard of detailed accountability to the public it represents, which will allow the public to understand how it has exercised its authority and the power that was placed in its hands, the range of its activities etc.\n\n22. The principle of freedom of information has several purposes, the realization of which must guide us when we address any petition or appeal dealing with freedom of information. First, the right to obtain information about public authorities is closely connected to freedom of expression and the public’s right to know. As is known, under the broad span of freedom of expression are to be found other freedoms that are essentially connected to it, derived from it, and vital to its realization. The broad protection enjoyed by the freedom of expression covers these as well and impacts the extent of their reach (HCJ 5771/93 Citrin v. Minister of Justice [1993] IsrSC 48(1) 661, at p. 673). Realization of the right to know involves the right to information: “There is no freedom of expression without the right to know, and there is no right to know without freedom of information” (AAA 6013/04 State of Israel – Ministry of Transport v. Israeli News Corporation Ltd. [2006] IsrSC 60(4) 60 (hereinafter: Ministry of Transport), at p. 73). The purposes served by freedom of expression mandate recognition of a broad right to know, and therefore also of a broad right of access to information. The fact that freedom of expression underlies the right to information and is bound up with it led to its recognition as a constitutional right, even though it is not entrenched explicitly in Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (AAA 11120/08 Movement for Freedom of Information v. State of Israel – Antitrust Authority [Nevo – November 17, 2010] (hereinafter: Antitrust Authority), para. 9 and the references there).\n\nThe second purpose of the principle of freedom of information is the exercise of effective civilian review and oversight of the activities of governmental authorities. “The public eye is not only an expression of the right to know, but it is a reflection of the right of oversight” (HCJ 1601/90 Shalit v. Peres [1990] IsrSC 44(3) 353, at p. 361; see also AAA 10845/06 Keshet Broadcasting Co. v. Second Authority for Television and Radio [Nevo – November 11, 2008] (hereinafter: Keshet Broadcasting), para. 65); Segal, at p. 102). The accessibility of information is a condition of the ability of the public to oversee the governmental authorities, to form an informed view of their activity, “to demonstrate involvement in governmental activity and to take part in the formation and fashioning of appropriate governmental culture . . .“ (Government Corporations, at para. 15). It makes possible the realization of political and civil rights and is an important component in the fostering of active, involved citizenship. The flip side of the coin is that transparency of the activity of the authority ensures an important contribution to “public hygiene”, as described by Justice Hayut in Council for Higher Education, at p. 231, for improving the quality of governmental decisions and its activities.\n\nA third purpose of the right to information is ensuring public confidence in public authorities. The knowledge that the authority is subject to oversight, which can be exercised by any individual, contributes to the confidence in the governmental authorities (Antitrust Authority; Segal, at p. 101.) As I mentioned in the past, without public confidence in the system, democratic society cannot exist (HCJ 5853/07 Emunah – National Religious Women’s Organization v. Prime Minister [2007] IsrSC 62(3) 445, at p. 493).\n\nThe fourth purpose of the right to information is proprietary. In its capacity as a body serving as a trustee for the public, the public authority holds information in trust for the public. The public is the owner of the information, and the authority cannot act in respect of this information as if it were the owner of property belonging to it. The importance of this goal is highlighted in the commentary to the Bill, whereby “… in fact, it would appear that it is difficult to uproot the proclivity of the authorities for regarding information as their property and not property that is held in trust by them for the public and on its behalf” (See Freedom of Information Bill). Accordingly, every one of the individuals constituting the public has the right to obtain information from the authority, even if he has no direct, personal interest in that information, when there are no good reasons for withholding it (HCJ 2283/07 Legal Forum for Israel v. Judicial Selection Committee under Section 4 of Basic Law: The Judiciary [Nevo – May 5, 2008], per Justice Hayut, para. 5; HaAretz, at p. 471; AAA 7744/10 National Insurance Institute v. Adv. Yafit Mangel [Nevo – November 15, 2012] (hereinafter: National Insurance Institute), per Justice Hendel, para. 5).\n\n23. I would point out that the hierarchy amongst the various purposes of the right to information is in dispute. There are those who viewed the protection of freedom of expression as the main purpose that the Law is designed to realize (Ministry of Transport, at pp. 72-73); some saw it in the value of transparency and the ability to maintain oversight of governmental activity (Government Corporations, at para. 37; Tax Authority, per my opinion, para. 56). As I pointed out in Antitrust Authority, I do not think that any one of these purposes should outrank any other. The different purposes are all foundational to the Law. To a great extent, they are bound up with and affect one another. In the circumstances of a particular case, one of these purposes will be the focus of the discussion, and at times, the discussion will touch upon several of them. One way or another, I believe that “…rather than examining the centrality of any particular purpose that lies at the basis of the Law and examining the request for information in its light, one must examine which of the purposes underlie the concrete request and examine their combined weight” (para. 9).\n\n24. A person’s entitlement to information held by a public authority arises if he succeeds in passing through the three filters on which the Law is based, as Justice Cheshin put it (HaAretz, at pp. 472-472).\n\nThe first filter is to be found in sec. 1 of the Law, which sets the parameters of the broad, principled range of the right to information:\n\nEvery Israeli citizen or resident has the right to obtain information from a public authority in accordance with the provisions of this Law.\n\nThe second filter prescribes exceptions to the right to information (secs. 8 – 9 of the Law), which define the cases in which information will not be delivered by the public authority or in which it is not obliged to deliver information, due to the existence of other, potentially conflicting interests and rights. Like all rights, the right to information is not absolute, but rather is relative. At times, it yields to other rights that merit protection, such as the right to privacy and to reputation, or to weighty interests, such as state security or foreign relations. In sec. 8, the Law enumerates a list of cases in which the public authority has discretion as to whether to grant the request for information. One can generalize and say that these cases are concerned with “administrative efficiency and practical constraints” (HCJ 2398/08 State of Israel – Ministry of Justice v. Segal [Nevo – June 19, 2011] (hereinafter: Segal), per (then) Justice Naor, para. 26); Eliezer Shraga & Barak Shahar, Administrative Law – Basic Principles vol. 1 (2009), 357), in view of which the authority is authorized to dismiss the request for information. The Law also provides a list of exceptions to delivery of information (sec. 9), distinguishing between cases in which information is not to be delivered, such as a case of concern of harm to national security or foreign relations (sec. 9(a)(1)-(2) of the Law) or harm to a person’s privacy (sec. 9(a)(3) of the Law), and cases in which the authority is granted discretion as to whether to hand over the information (sec. 9(b) of the Law). These exceptions express various points of balance between the right to information and other rights and interests, and place broad discretion in the hands of the public authority. The main consideration that the public authority must weigh in its decision is that of the public interest in disclosure of the information (Segal, at p. 199).\n\nThe third filter (sec. 17 of the Law) grants the court authority to order the disclosure of information contrary to the position of the public authority (and see also HaAretz, at pp. 472-473).\n\nTo these three filters are adjoined the provisions of the Law that limit the realization of the right to information: inter alia, sec. 10, which deals with the considerations of the public authority; sec. 11, dealing with the possibility of delivering partial information or with conditions attached; sec. 13 which deals with protection of third parties; and sec. 14 of the Law, which contains a list of bodies that are not subject to the Law.\n\n25. This is the normative framework of the deliberation. Before we examine the arguments of the parties, I will discuss the issues that define the dispute before us. First, I will consider the nature of the judicial function and the principle of judicial independence which lies at its core. Juxtaposed to this I will present the mechanisms of supervision to which governing judges are subject, which are of importance in the present matter due to the fact that the purpose of the present petition is to increase the transparency of the activity of the courts. I will then proceed to examine the arguments that were raised by the parties in order to ground their contention that handing over the requested information will cause disruption with the proper functioning of the courts system, and that they may therefore invoke the exception to the delivery of information specified in sec. 9(b)(1) of the Freedom of Information Law; I will then decide on these arguments.\n\nOn Judging and the Image of the Judge\n\n26. Judging is a calling. It is not like other occupations. It is not a trade. To choose a judicial career is to choose a destiny, a way of life. The task that befalls a judge—to decide disputes and to adapt the law to the changing exigencies of life, to preserve and protect the rule of law, human rights and all other values of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state (Aharon Barak, “On My Role as a Judge” Mishpat Umimshal 7 (5764-2004) 33; Tova Strasberg-Cohen and Moran Svorai, “Justice Bach – The Image of a Judge” Gabriel Bach Volume (2011) 731, 740 (hereinafter: Strasberg-Cohen & Svorai, Bach Volume)) — is a weighty one. The authority and the power vested in the judge’s hands have the capacity to affect—sometimes very profoundly—the life of the individual and his rights; they can have a significant impact on shaping the face of society. Vice-President M. Cheshin and (then) Justice E. Rivlin described the distinctive nature of the vocation of the judge as follows:\n\nThe judicial profession is no ordinary profession: it is a profession that is one of a kind; a profession of destiny that imposes upon the judge, almost of itself, special tasks and norms of behavior. The judge has a heavy—extremely heavy—burden placed on his shoulders: to judge and to decide the law. A person’s fate is entrusted to his hands—not only metaphorically — his liberty, his money, and his rights. This requires the judge to act with integrity, discretion, moderation, caution, and precision, and to continually ensure that he does not deprive the litigants before him of their rights (DC 2461/05 Minister of Justice v. Judge Cohen [2005] IsrSC 60(1) 457 (hereinafter: Judge Cohen), at p. 461).\n\nThe special nature of judging characterizes those who have chosen this profession and were chosen for it. A person who merited donning the judicial robes is obligated to justify, in all aspects of his life, in his conduct both in the court and outside of it, the trust that has been placed in him. The highest personal, professional, moral, and ethical standard is demanded of him (Tova Strasberg-Cohen, “The Image of the Judge” Parliament, 72, available at the website of the Israeli Democracy Institute, www.idi.org.il, hereinafter: Strasberg-Cohen, Parliament). He is required to encapsulate in his personality a blend of personal attributes, professional sills, responsibility, wisdom and discretion that will guide him, as a kind of inner compass:\n\nFrom the special nature of the judicial system—with which the judge is occupied in making fateful decisions, in the criminal law and in preserving the rule of law, human rights and democratic values—is derived the requirement that he requires a special personality, special characteristics, and a special nature to qualify him for his position. Principal amongst the required qualities are: personal honesty, integrity, moral rectitude, clean hands, professionalism, independence of thought, objectivity, and neutrality. In addition to these qualities, the judge must—when sitting in judgment—be attentive, sensitive, tolerant, and patient. He must hold the reins of the judicial process and conduct the trial fairly and efficiently. He must display a judicial temperament even though the process—by its very nature—is fraught with tension and pressure. (Ibid)\n\nAnd as the prophet said:\n\nHe has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God (Micah 6:8).\n\nThe judge is a symbol of values, conscience, and morality. In his conduct, and in all that he does, he must constitute a shining example for the public in his respect for the law, in his meticulous adherence to it, and in his exemplary, respectful, and respecting personal conduct.\n\nA preliminary, essential condition of the judge’s ability to serve in that capacity is the confidence of the public, which recognizes his authority to judge and will accept his decisions as binding. Not only is the matter of the individual judge at issue before us, but also public confidence in the system as a whole (and see Judge Cohen, at p. 461).\n\nJudicial Independence\n\n27. The judiciary is one of the three branches of government on which the democratic regime is founded. The alignment of the relations between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive is based on a balance between the authority of these branches in a way that allows for autonomy on the one hand, and mutual oversight on the other—the existence of separate governmental authorities that amongst themselves maintain mutual relations of “checks and balances”:\n\nOne principal is that of the separation of powers: the legislature will legislate, the executive branch (the government) will execute and the judiciary will sit in judgment. The combination of words “separation of powers” does not indicate the full content of the expression. The essence of this principle does not lie in the “separation of powers”, i.e. the separation between the branches for the sake of separation, but in the decentralization of power and authority between different and separate branches. The essence lies in the legislature engaging solely in legislative acts and not in executive ones, the executive solely in executive acts and not in legislative and judicial ones and the judiciary engaging solely in judicial acts and not in legislative and executive ones.” ((then) Justice M. Cheshin, HCJ 6971/98 Paritzky v. Government of Israel [1999] IsrSC 53(1) 763, at p. 790).\n\nThe principle of checks and balances between the governmental branches requires, therefore, that there be an independent judiciary, which is not susceptible to any inappropriate influence, either on the part of the other governmental braches or on the part of any interested party.\n\n28. Judicial independence is one of the basic values of the democratic system, and its existence is essential for the realization of all the other values of the system. It is one of the judge’s most important assets in fulfilling the weighty tasks laid upon his shoulders. It is the crux of judging, “the heart and soul of the judicial enterprise” (Tova Strasberg-Cohen, “Judicial Independence and the Supervision of Judges’ Conduct: Reflections on the Purposes of the Ombudsman for Complaints against Judges Law, 2002”, Mishpat Ve’Asakim 3 (5765-2005), hereinafter: Strasberg-Cohen, Mishpat Ve’Asakim), and it constitutes the basis and the condition for realization of the right to due process. At the core of judicial independence are to be found objectivity and neutrality, which are the first principles of judging (Strasberg-Cohen & Svorai, Bach Volume, at p. 737; Meir Shamgar, “Independence of the Judicial System as a Fundamental Element of Democratic Order” Hapraklit 42 (5755-1995), 245, 249 – hereinafter: Shamgar). The meaning of this is that the judge decides the case according to the law, with freedom of thought and conscience, without fear and without bias, acting in accordance with the law and with professional discretion and a sense of justice and conscience, with no pressure nor incentive applied to him (Strasberg-Cohen, Mishpat Ve’asakim, at p. 335; Aharon Barak, The Judge in a Democratic Society (2004), 124 – hereinafter: Barak, The Judge in a Democratic Society; Tova Strasberg-Cohen, “The Tension between Judicial Independence and Accountability”, Berenzon Volume (5767-2007) 127, 129 – hereinafter: Strasberg-Cohen, Berenzon Volume).\n\n29. Judicial independence ensures the pertinence and the quality of the judicial decision. It is mandated by, and warranted in view of, the powers that are placed in the hands of the judge—powers which may decide fates and change the courses of lives. Its importance, however, is not exhausted at the level of the individual litigant; significantly, for the public at large, this independence ensures equality before the law to all who cross the threshold of the court, as well as enabling the judge to fulfill his role in protecting human rights and the rule of law (see also: Strasberg-Cohen, Berenzon Volume, at p. 130; Eli Salzberger, “Temporary Appointments and Judicial Independence: Theoretical Thoughts and Empirical Findings from the Supreme Court of Israel”, Mehkherei Mishpat 19 (5763-2003) 541, 543; Michal Agmon-Gonen, “Judicial Autonomy? The Threat from Within”, HaMishpat 10 (5765-2005) 213, 216 (hereinafter: Agmon-Gonen)). In other words, more than protecting the judge, judicial independence protects the public whom he judges.\n\n30. There are two facets to judicial independence. The first facet is the personal independence of the judge who hears the case. Personal judicial independence is secured within two concentric circles. In the inner circle is to be found the personal substantive independence of the judge, i.e., the liberty granted to the judge to decide the law according to his best professional understanding and conscience, with no dependence on any external factor, in order to ensure neutrality and objectivity in the conduct of the case and the decisions made therein. Personal independence of the judge is prescribed in sec. 2 of Basic Law: The Judiciary, the heading of which is “Independence”: “A person vested with judicial power shall not, in judicial matters, be subject to any authority but that of the Law” (and see sec. 5 of the Code of Ethics for Judges, 5767-2007, and in particular, sec. 5(c) of the Code, which states that “The judge shall fear no one, and shall not be influenced, in the fulfilling his role, by public opinion, concern about criticism or desire to please”). Of course, the decisions of a judge are subject to appellate review, but this is an integral, fundamental part of the judicial enterprise, which does not negate or erode the fact that at the time when the judge makes his decision in a case, he does so according to his conscience and his best judgment; hence the activity of the appeals court cannot constitute harm to his judicial independence (Shlomo Levin, “Judicial Autonomy – An Inside Look”, Iyunei Mishpat 29 (2005) 5, 11 (hereinafter: Levin)).\n\nThe autonomy of the judge is not intended to be confined to relations with the legislature and the executive; rather, it extends to fulfillment of the judicial role with administrative independence vis-à-vis every internal factor in the judicial system (Shamgar, at p. 254; Levin; Barak, The Judge in Democratic Society, at p. 125).\n\n31. In the outer circle of personal independence are the rules that seek to prevent inappropriate interventions in the function of the judge that affect his substantive independence. These are rules which seek to ensure for the judge a professional working environment free from pressures and concerns regarding potential personal consequences stemming from a particular ruling (Shamgar, at p. 248; Shimon Shetreet, “Culture of Judicial Independence in Israel: Institutional and Substantive Aspects of the Justice System in a Historical Perspectives”, Law and Business 10 (5769-2009) 525, 529-533 (hereinafter: Shetreet)). We will mention in particular those rules that set out the modes of appointment and conditions of office of the judge (Basic Law: The Judiciary, secs. 4, 7 and 10); the rules concerning the personal immunity of the judge in torts for an act done in the capacity of his judicial role (sec. 8 of the Civil Wrongs Ordinance [New Version], 5728-1968; LCA 6830/00 Bernowitz v. Te’umim [2003] IsrSC 57(5) 691, at p. 702; and rules about taking testimony from judges (LCA 3202/03 State of Israel v. Yosef [2004] IsrSC 58(3) 541).\n\n32. For the sake of completeness I will mention that the second aspect of judicial independence is institutional independence, i.e., the administrative and organizational independence of the judiciary. Institutional independence is closely connected to personal judicial independence. The latter draws sustenance from the former, without which it would not be possible to ensure, fully, the personal independence of judges. The issue of institutional independence is not the focus of our discussion, and I will therefore say no more on the subject (for elaboration of the subject see: Aharon Barak, “Judicial Independence – How?” Mivhar Ketavim 1 (5760-2000); Barak, Judge in a Democratic Society, at pp. 125-127).\n\n33. To sum up this point: in matters of judging, the judge is not subject to the authority of any other person, or any governmental authority, or any office, or to the power of money. He is subject only to the authority of the law. Judicial independence is a precondition—and there is none more vital —for allowing the judiciary to fulfill its role in protecting the rule of law and ensuring the orderly functioning of the other branches, as well as its role in protecting human rights and the basic values of society, and most of all, in doing justice. It comes to ensure that the judge can fulfill his function with professionalism and without bias, in that it constitutes a barrier against abuse of authority or deviation from the bounds of competence by other governmental authorities (Shamgar, at p. 254), or against attempts by those with an interest and power to influence the proceedings. Judicial independence is fundamental in ensuring due judicial process. It is the basis for securing the confidence of the public in the legal system, that “judging is executed fairly, neutrally, with equal treatment of litigants and without even a smidgeon of personal interest in the outcome” (HCJ 732/84 MK Yair Tzaban v. Minister for Religious Affairs [1986] IsrSC 40(4) 141 (hereinafter: Tzaban), at p. 148). As such, it is one of the basic values of democracy: there is no properly-functioning regime where the public has no confidence in the fact that the judiciary resolves disputes that come before it on the merits, objectively, and independently. Without public confidence in the characterization of the judicial system as described, society has no effective mechanism for deciding disputes and for the conduct of life in a cooperative, organized, and orderly framework. Public confidence and the independence of the judiciary operate reciprocally: judicial independence provides the basis for public confidence in the judiciary, whereas public confidence strengthens judicial independence and is the source of its power (Strasberg-Cohen, Berinson Volume, p. 131).\n\nOversight and Supervision of Judges – the Principle of Accountability\n\n34. “Our system relies on unreserved trust in judges, in their integrity, their morality, their humanity, and their values” (HCJ 188/96 Tzirinsky v. Vice President of Hadera Magistrates Court [1998] IsrSC52(3) 721 (hereinafter: Tzirinsky) , at p. 743; and see Barak, The Judge in a Democratic Society, at p. 50). At the same time, even given the judicial independence enjoyed by the judges and the courts system, they are not immune from supervision, nor are they exempt from it.\n\n35. Judges are not like the other functionaries in the public service. The nature of their task, its particular characteristics, as mentioned above, and inherent duties, as well as responsibility for the high standard of conduct to which the judge is held, both inside and outside the courtroom, are different from those pertaining to other public servants. The role of the judge is characterized by norms that he sets forth in his decisions, within the framework provided by the law, to which the influence and application are not limited to the litigants in the particular case before him, but rather, reach the entire public. All these create a substantive, significant difference between judges and other public servants (in this context, cf: Daphna Avnieli, “Who Will Judge the Judges and How?” Hapraklit 47 (5764-2004) 77, 95; Strasberg-Cohen, Mishpat Ve’asakim, at 337; Agmon-Gonen, at p. 230). However, precisely because of these characteristics of the judicial function, judges are subject to the duties that apply to other public functionaries as public trustees (see also the Preface to Code of Ethics for Judges; Tova Strasberg-Cohen and Moran Svorai, “Mechanisms for Supervision of the Judiciary” HaMishpat 24 (2007), 47 (hereinafter: Strasberg-Cohen and Svorai, HaMishpat)). The concept of trusteeship leads to a requirement of transparency that applies to all public authorities. Transparency, which I shall discuss presently, also involves supervision:\n\nThe indispensability of supervision is derived from the requirement of transparency that stems from a conception of the public authority and its workers as trustees on behalf of the public. About this is has been said: “The public authorities are trustees of the public. They have nothing on their own, and everything that they do have, they have for the public (HCJ 1635/90 Zarzewski v. Prime Minister [1991] IsrSC 45(1) 749, at p. 839). Even despite the fact that due to these special characteristics of the judicial task, judges should not be regarded as public servants in the narrow sense, the duties that apply to public servants as public trustees should be applied to them, mutatis mutandis (Strasberg-Cohen, Berinson Volume, at p. 132).\n\nThe Judge’s being subject to supervision stems, therefore, from the transparency that is necessitated by the activity of the courts as a public body, but it also expresses acknowledgment of the fact that the judge is a human being, and like every human being, “there may be failings and defects in his behavior and his conduct” (Strasberg-Cohen, Berinson Volume, ibid.). The fact that the judge is subject to supervision and oversight of his conduct and behavior in the framework of fulfillment of his judicial role—this is the “Principle of Accountability”.\n\nThus, “… supervision is desirable. Like every governmental authority, we too must be subject to supervision; just as there is no authority that is higher than the law, so too is there no authority which is beyond supervision” (Aharon Barak “Supervision of the Judiciary”, Mivhar Ketavim (2000) 961). The fact that judges are subject to supervision contributes to the public confidence in the courts, to the propriety of legal process, to the quality of the decisions that are made, and to the quality of the functioning of the legal system as a whole.\n\n36. What is the nature and the extent of the supervision of judges? How does it comport with judicial independence and the principle of accountability?\n\nNormally, three fundamental approaches are cited for balancing the natural tension existing between the principle of judicial independence and the principle of accountability (Strasberg-Cohen, Berinson Volume, p. 134-135). The first approach holds that judicial independence must be absolute, with absolutely no interference from an outside body. The proponents of this approach believe that the legal system itself must handle claims about the conduct and the behavior of judges, including with regard to matters of the administration of justice, and that action by external review mechanisms should not be permitted. There are also those who claim that judes’ accountability to the public for their actions is only indirect and passive, and is exhausted by the publication of judicial decisions and the written reasons judges provide for these decisions (Haim H. Cohn, “Heretical Thoughts on Public Confidence”, Shamgar Volume 2 (5763-2003) 365, 381 (hereinafter: Cohn)). This approach is inconsistent with the predominant approach today whereby no public authority is above external supervision.\n\nThe second approach is that the judge, like every public servant, must be subject to supervision. This approach assigns no real weight to the substance and the goals of the principle of judicial independence or to the special nature of the role of the judge vis-à-vis public servants. This approach, too, expresses an extreme position and does not attribute proper weight to the interests that are relevant to the matter.\n\nThe third approach, accepted today both in Israel and the world over, is a combined approach, which grants weight to both principles and strikes a balance between them (Strasberg-Cohen and Svorai, HaMishpat, at pp. 47-48). This approach contends, inter alia, that the principle of judicial independence is a means for protecting democracy, the rule of law, and human rights, and insofar as it does not serve these purposes, it should be limited (Strasberg-Cohen, Mishpat Ve’Asakim, at pp. 339-340).\n\nExisting Mechanisms for Supervision of Judges and Courts\n\n37. Supervision of judges in Israel occurs within formal, institutionalized frameworks, into which the preservation of judicial independence and the balance between that independence and the need for supervision are built. However, this supervision also occurs informally, sometimes raising questions as to the appropriate manner to enable supervision while still preserving the judicial system and its independence. As will be explained, the existing mechanisms of supervision extend to all areas of activity of the courts.\n\na. Supervision Mechanisms Built into the Judicial Process\n\n38. Review is the backbone of the judicial process. This process, and the rules by which it is conducted, are based on the conception that the conduct of a process and the rendering of a decision in that process are subject to review. The principal mechanism of review of a judge’s decision is the appeals process. The review that is embodied in the appeals process may also relate to: the conduct of the judge in the process; to his attitude to the litigants, their attorneys and the witnesses; to the manner in which he conducted the hearings; to the manner in which he expressed himself; to delays in issuing the judgment and more (Daphna Avnieli, “Who Will Control the Judges - and How?” Mishpat Umimshal 9 (5766-2006) 387, 391 (hereinafter: Avnieli, “Control of Judges”).\n\n39. Another means of review is the principle of transparency, which constitutes an integral part of the judicial process and of the activity of the court; its main manifestation is in the principle of publicity of proceedings. This principle is one of the foundations of the democratic regime, and has acquired constitutional status in our legal system (HCJ 5917/97 Association for Civil Rights in Israel v. Minister of Justice [Nevo –October 8, 2009] (hereinafter: Association for Civil Rights), para. 17). Its meaning is that as a rule, a trial will be held publicly, will be transparent, and will be open to the public (sec. 3 of Basic Law: The Judiciary. See also sec. 68(a) of the Courts Law [Consolidated Version] 5744-1984 (hereinafter: the Courts Law)). The limitations clause listing matters in which the legislator permitted the courts not to hear a case in open court was interpreted in the case law as exclusive and narrow, in order to ensure that the principle of publicity is strictly maintained (CA 5185/93 Attorney-General v. Marom [1995] IsrSC 49(1) 318, at p. 341).\n\nThe publicity of court proceedings is intended to ensure that the activity of the courts will be transparent and open to the public, and that the public will be able to observe how the system works, and also to criticize the system (HCJ 258/07 MK Zahava Galon v. Government Commission of Investigation for Examining the Events of the 2006 War in Lebanon [2007] IsrSC 62(1) 648, at pp. 664-665, 676-677). Indeed, “proper government acts in daylight, in the open, and thus exposes itself to perpetual criticism …” ((then) Justice M. Cheshin, LCrimA 112/93 State of Israel v. Klein [1994] IsrSC 48(3) 485, at p. 516). The public nature of hearings is an essential condition for the proper functioning of the courts. It is “… one of the main guarantees of the regularity of the legal process, both in terms of doing justice and uncovering the truth, in practice, and in terms of the appearance of justice …” (CrimA 353/88 Vilner v. State of Israel [1991] IsrSC 45(2) 444, at p. 450).\n\n40. There are three main rationales for the principle of the publicity of proceedings (CrA 11793/05 The Israeli News Company v. State of Israel [Nevo – April 5, 2006] (hereinafter: Israeli News Company), para. 13-15; LCA 3614/97 Avi-Isaac v. Israel News Corporation [1998] IsrSC 53(1) 26 (hereinafter: Avi-Isaac), at pp. 45-46).\n\nThe first rationale is that the public’s right to know about the activity of governmental authorities is part of freedom of expression and freedom of the press (LCA 3007/02 Yitzhak v. Moses [2002] IsrSC 56(6) 592, at p. 598). The guarantee that the publicity of the proceedings provides for the transparency of court proceedings, as well as to the supervision and oversight of the courts and their activities was discussed by (then) Justice M. Cheshin stating:\n\nThe overarching principle, whose wings span the whole issue of publicity, is the principle of publicity of the proceedings in court. In the days of old, the elders sat in judgment in the gates of the city. Similar to the ancient gates, are the courts in our times, whose doors are wide open to those who wish to enter therein. The conduct of a trial, of any trial—other than the exceptions—occurs in public, and the publication of what has been done and what has been heard in the courtroom is simply a by-product of that publicity. Subject to considerations of physical room capacity, everyone is entitled to be present at courtroom hearings, and publication of what occurred in the courtroom extends the courtroom, as it were, to those not physically present. The public nature of the legal proceeding—which itself provides publicity—fulfills an exalted need in the system of open government and law. Publicity means—in practice—the transparency of proceedings in the court, and transparency ensures ongoing review of what occurs in the courtrooms. Transparency and supervision—those are the essential terms (CrM 5759/04 Turjeman v. State of Israel [2004] IsrSC 58(6) 658, at p. 662).\n\nA second rationale for the principle of the publicity of legal proceedings is its contribution to improving the quality of the judicial decision (Avi-Isaac, at p. 46). “The exposure of legal proceedings to the public eye serves as a guarantee for the existence of public oversight of the courts, and to ensure the conduct of a fair trial and absence of bias” (Report of the Committee for Examining the Opening of Courts in Israel to Electronic Media, p. 14 (2004)).\n\nThe third rationale relates to public confidence in the public authorities in general, and in the courts in particular. The public nature of proceedings prevents the impression that law is conducted secretly, and that extraneous considerations are exercised (CA 152/51 Trifous v. Attorney General [1952] IsrSC 6(1) 17, at p. 23): justice must not only be done but must also be seen.\n\nIf so, the fact that as a rule, legal proceedings are conducted publicly ensures that the provisions of the law are followed scrupulously with respect to the conduct of trials, contributing to their fairness and to their proper conduct. It makes the process of doing justice transparent and accessible to the public as a whole, fortifying public trust in the judicial system (and see: LCrimA 5877/99 Yanos v. State of Israel [2004] IsrSC 59(2) 97 (hereinafter: Yanos), at p. 111)). These functions, which are served by the public nature of proceedings, render it an instrument of oversight of the judges and of their conduct.\n\n41. Alongside the public nature of the proceedings, other characteristics of the legal process are directed at ensuring transparency, and in this they contribute to the oversight of judges. In this context I will mention that judicial proceedings are documented in the protocol, which is intended to express and reflect what happens in the courtroom (and see: Dafna Barak-Erez, Administrative Law (5770-2010), at p. 613), and that there is a duty to provide written reasons for judicial decisions. The protocols and the duty to provide reasons are significant, necessary components in enabling the parties to challenge the decision before an appeals court, and in order to allow that court to review the judicial decision and the discretion that was exercised in the conduct of the process (on the importance of the protocol for review on appeal, see: CA 579/90 Rosin v. Ben-Nun [1992] IsrSC 46(3) 738, at p. 747. On the importance, for that purpose, of providing reasons see: CrA 446/01 Rudman v. State of Israel [2002] IsrSC 56(5) 25, at p. 30; CA 84/80 Qassem v. Qassem [1983] IsrSC 37(3) 60, at p. 70; CrM 3196/00 Abergel v. State of Israel [2000] IsrSC 54(2) 236, at p. 239). In addition, as an element of the transparency of the courts system, there is a right to view court files, even for non-litigants, as regulated in the Courts and National Labor Courts (Examination of Files) Regulations, 5763-2003 (on this matter, see Association for Civil Rights).\n\n42. Mention has been made, both in legislation and in the legal literature, of other means that can serve the function of supervision of the judges, such as the process for judicial disqualification, due to concern about bias (see Yigal Mersel, Judicial Disqualification Law (2006) 37); filing a civil suit for a judicial tort; the possibility of suing the state instead of bringing a personal suit against a judge; a suit against the state as being responsible for the propriety of the judicial system; and embarking on legal proceedings against a judge in cases which are not protected by the immunity from criminal proceedings that is afforded to a judge by virtue of sec. 34T of the Penal Law, 5737-1977 (Avnieli, Control of Judges, at pp. 392-399).\n\nb. Supervision Mechanisms in the Disciplinary and Ethical Realm\n\n43. The main mechanism of oversight of judicial conduct is the institution of the Ombudsman for Complaints Against Judges, who operates by virtue of the Ombudsman’s Law. The Ombudsman’s Office is a separate, neutral, and independent body, whose job is to investigate “complaints about the conduct of judges in carrying out their functions, including the manner in which they conduct a trial (end of sec. 2 of the Ombudsman’s Law), for the purpose of improving the service given to the public by judges, while preserving judicial independence (Strasberg-Cohen and Svorai, HaMishpat at p. 54). The oversight exercised by the Ombudsman’s Office does not deal with the substantive aspect of the judicial function, which clearly falls within the principle of judicial independence, and which is subject to review by the appeals process. The Ombudsman’s activity focuses on the conduct of the judges on the ethical-disciplinary plane (ibid.), which, as befitting the nature of the judicial position, is held to a high normative standard:\n\nIndeed, even that which is permitted to all other people, and even to other public servants, may well be prohibited to a judge qua judge. This is so with respect to his manner of speaking and his conduct, and with respect to the need to be meticulous in guarding against harm to the appearance of justice, and this is so with respect to the care he takes in conducting a well-run trial and more. This extra vigilance stems from the special nature of the judicial endeavor, in which the judge deals with fateful decisions in criminal and civil law, in preserving the rule of law, human rights and the values of society, while doing justice through the law. This vigilance also stems from the need to preserve public confidence in the judicial system— meaning the public’s sense that the judicial act is executed with fairness, neutrality, objectivity, without bias or prejudice, while maintaining the high moral level of the judges (Tova Strasberg-Cohen and Moran Svorai, “Oversight of Judges on the Ethical-Disciplinary Plane” Mishpat Umimshal 9 (2006) 371, 378).\n\nThe purpose of these norms, the observance of which is within the purview of the Ombudsman for Complaints Against Judges, is to preserve a high professional and moral standard in the judicial system, and to maintain and strengthen public confidence in that system.\n\nAlongside oversight of the conduct of the judge in the courtroom and his maintenance of a judicial temperament that is in keeping with his judicial position, the Ombudsman also deals with aspects of the efficiency of the operation of the courts system, including the speed with which cases are handled.\n\n44. The oversight conducted by the Ombudsman is publicized in an annual report, which includes details of the complaints lodged each year against judges, without designating the names of the judges against whom the complaints are lodged. In addition, reasoned decisions regarding complaints that have been found to have merit are inserted into the personal files of the judge in question. The Ombudsman’s office is also authorized to recommend that disciplinary action be taken against a judge, or that his judicial appointment be terminated by the Committee for the Appointment of Judges (sec. 22 of the Ombudsman’s Law). At the same time, the Ombudsman’s office also looks to the system as a whole, by recommending steps to correct defects that emerge as general or broad phenomena and following through on their execution (Strasberg-Cohen, Berinson Volume, at p. 143).\n\nThe principles that have been laid down in the Ombudsman’s Law for the supervisory activity express a striving for effective oversight, together with caution, responsibility, and sensitivity to ensure that there is no violation of judicial independence (Strasberg-Cohen, Mishpat Ve’Asakim, at p. 342). The actions of the Ombudsman’s office express, therefore, a model of oversight of the activity of judges that involves public expression and reporting, which may have significant implications from the point of view of those over whom the oversight is exercised, but without exposure of the details of the judge in question.\n\n45. In addition to the activity of the Ombudsman’s office, aspects of supervision and oversight over the conduct of judges can be discerned in other frameworks as well: for example, the activity of the disciplinary court for judges (sec. 13 of Basic Law: The Judiciary and secs. 17 – 21 of the Courts Law); or the activity of the Ethics Committee under sec. 16B of the Courts Law (see also Strasberg-Cohen and Svorai, HaMishpat, at pp. 54-55). These are joined by the fact that the courts are amongst the bodies subject to audit by the State Comptroller (State Comptroller Law 5718-1958, secs. 9 and 10(a)(2)). In addition, there is informal oversight of the courts system by the director of the courts and the presidents of the courts, which mainly consists of administrative oversight by means of tracking the number of cases and the pace of proceedings in each court (and see: Strasberg-Cohen and Svorai, Mishpat Umimshal, at p. 380).\n\nPublic Oversight\n\n46. To the mechanisms of oversight must be added the public criticism to which the courts and the judges are subject. Public oversight includes criticism of courts and of judges by jurists, academics, public representatives, the media, and of course—the general public. The possibility of criticizing judges as public functionaries is a component of freedom of expression. As stated, public confidence in the courts significantly depends on the ability of the public to publicly criticize them. Indeed, “justice is not a cloistered virtue, She must be allowed to suffer the scrutinty and respectful, even if outspoken, comments of ordinary men” (as cited (and translated) by Justice Etzioni, CrA 364/73 Seidman v. State of Israel [1974] IsrSC 28(2) 620, at p. 634). In this context, the fact that the deliberations of the courts are, as a rule, open to the public who may come, listen, see, and form a first-hand impression of the manner in which cases proceed is, obviously, of particular importance.\n\n47. The possibility of formulating criticism depends, as mentioned, on access to information. A major instrument of oversight for the public is the Freedom of Information Law. Various reports that the appellant publishes by virtue of the Freedom of Information Law allow the public to see the number of cases that are handled in the courts and the pace at which they are handled. Thus, the annual report of appellant no. 1 includes data concerning the number of cases that were filed and closed each year, the total number of cases pending, the distribution according to courts and according to areas of activity, and the average lifetime in years of a case. The bi-annual report published by appellant no. 1 includes data about the volume of cases, the number of cases that were filed and that were closed, segmented according to the courts, the types of proceedings and types of cases, and also data concerning the rate at which hearings take place, the distribution of the cases according to the number of years that they have been in the system, and the average lifetime of a case in the different courts. The judges’ dockets and the online management of cases make it possible to learn about the functioning of the system. Of course, this data does not refer to the volume of cases handled by a particular judge, or to the duration of proceedings in the cases he hears, which is the issue before us at present.\n\n48. I will add something that might be obvious: the importance of public scrutiny does not necessarily imply that the criticism requires or justifies internalization or correction. The criticism might reflect “passing whims, which are detrimental to fundamental principles,” in the words of President Barak (Aharon Barak, “Law and Judgment”, Selected Writings 1 (5760-2006) 961, 963), and it is clear that the judge should not wring his hands over them. The criticism is sometimes based on incomplete or wrong information. Sometimes it ignores relevant facts. In these cases, too, there is no justification for correction or change in the wake of the criticism (Barak, Farewell Address, at pp. 9-10).\n\nInterim Summary\n\n49. I have discussed at length judicial independence on the one hand, and the fact of the court being subject to oversight and audit by means of various mechanisms on the other hand. It is precisely because of the elevated status of the judicial function that the mechanisms that ensure the transparency of the courts and their oversight are so important. They are able to increase and bolster public confidence in the courts in general and in the judges in particular. I will note at this point that given the publicity, transparency, oversight, audit, and supervision, one cannot but be surprised at the objection of the appellants to the request, which is something of an addendum, and not central, to the large, broad set-up of transparency in the courts, which only increases confidence in the judges and in the whole courts system.\n\nAt this stage let us turn to the Freedom of Information Law, and determine whether the appellants succeed in passing through the filters that it establishes. First I will look at whether the requested information is governed by the Freedom of Information Law. Then I will examine the reasons for the appellants’ refusal to hand over the information, and decide whether they can invoke an exception to disclosure by virtue of sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law, as they claim.\n\nFirst Filter – Section 1 of the Freedom of Information Law\n\n50. As we have said, sec. 1 of the Freedom of Information Law states that every citizen or resident in Israel has the right to obtain information from a public authority. Section 2 of the Law defines a “public authority” for the purposes of the Law. Item (5) of the definition of “public authority” includes within this definition “Courts, tribunals, execution offices and other bodies with powers of adjudication under any law, except in respect of the content of a judicial proceeding.” The definition does not, it is true, specifically mention the courts administration as a public authority, but because it applies to “courts”, there is no doubt in my mind that appellant no. 1 comes within its purview. In addition, the requested information—data regarding the number of cases that are being heard by each judge and as to the date on which each case was opened—is information that is administrative in nature and does not involve the contents of a judicial proceeding, as required by the end part of the definition of a “public authority” (for the distinction between administrative information and information regarding the content of a judicial proceedings see Segal, at pp. 141-143).\n\nI am aware of the appellants’ argument that in order to present a complete picture of the situation, they would have to add various explanations to the requested data. According to them, the required explanations would create “slippage” towards the innards of the judicial proceeding and the discretion exercised in its framework, which is not covered by the Law. I will discuss this issue below; at this stage, however, I am of the opinion that our matter passes through the first filter established by the Law.\n\nThe Second Filter – Exceptions to Delivering Information (Section 9 of the Law)\n\n51. The appellants contend that they may invoke the exception to the delivery of information prescribed in sec. 9(b)(1) of the Freedom of Information Law, whereby:\n\n(b) A public authority is not obliged to provide information in any of the following categories:\n\n(1) Information, disclosure of which is liable to disrupt the proper functioning of the public authority, or its ability to carry out its duties.\n\nI will mention, very briefly, that appellants’ main argument is that delivering the information with the names of the judges hearing the cases will bring harm to public confidence and to judicial independence, which are essential foundations of the functioning of the courts system; hence the concern about interfering with the orderly functioning of this system. As stated, the appellants are prepared to deliver the requested information, but without mentioning the names of the judges.\n\n52. The exception upon which the appellants wish to rely is included in the cases in which the authority is not obligated to give out information, as specified in sec. 9(b)(2) of the Law, and in relation to which the public authority has discretion whether to disclose the information, in order to protect other important interests. The scope of the discretion granted to the authority within the bounds of sec. 9(b) of the Law is broad (Council for Higher Education, at p. 238). The fact that administrative discretion lies at the core of this section makes it an extremely important and central arena in which the right to information acquires content (Hillel Sommer, “The Freedom of Information Law: Law and Reality”, HaMishpat 8 (5763-2003) 435; Segal, at p. 199). The main consideration that should guide the authority in its decision as to whether to refrain from providing information under sec. 9(b) of the Freedom of Information Law is public interest in the disclosure of the information (Segal, ibid.). At the same time, the authority will also take into account, inter alia, the public interest in transparency of the authority’s activities in order to enable informed discussion and to allow for effective, appropriate public oversight of the authority, the applicant’s interest in the information (sec. 10 of the Freedom of Information Law), and the right of the public to know.\n\nI will begin with a discussion of the probability test that the appellants must pass in order to invoke the exception in sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law. I will then proceed to examine the arguments on their merits.\n\nProbability Test\n\n53. The parties disagree on the question of whether, in the balancing that takes place pursuant to sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law, appellants must show that interference with the activity of the authority or with its ability to perform its tasks is a near certainty, as respondents claim, or whether it is sufficient for them to pass the more lenient standard of proving a reasonable possibility that the said result will occur, as appellants argue. According to the appellants, in achieving a balance between the principle of justice being done by the courts and other principles such as freedom of expression, the case law requires nothing beyond the criterion of reasonable possibility of interference with the administration of justice, and in this regard they refer to Dissenchik and Azulai, in which there was discussion of the balance between freedom of expression and preservation of the integrity of the judicial process; to CrimApp 1986/94 State of Israel v. Amar [1994] IsrSC 48(3) 133, in which there was discussion of the balance between the freedom of movement and the orderly function of the judicial process; and to LCrimA 4708/03 Hen v. State of Israel – Ministry of Health [2005] IsrSC 60(3) 274 (hereinafter: Hen), in which the balance between the principle of doing justice and the public interest in improving and advancing medicine was discussed.\n\nIndeed, in these cases, the court employed the “reasonable possibility” standard, in examining whether competing rights or interests should be limited for the purpose of ensuring various aspects of the judicial proceeding. However, there is a significant difference between these matters and the one before us. To what am I referring?\n\n54. In order to strike the appropriate balance between various values and interests, there is an accepted distinction between “horizontal balancing” which exists between two interests or values that are of equal legal status, and in the framework of which a certain concession is required on the part of each in order to allow for the core of both to be upheld, and “vertical balancing” which seeks the balancing point between a “high” right or normative value that clashes with a right or normative value of inferior status. In the framework of vertical balancing, preference will be accorded to the value whose status is more elevated, if the balancing formula that can determine the severity of the violation of that value and the probability of its occurrence is satisfied. In this context, the common criteria are the “near certainty” of the occurrence of the violation, or the “reasonable possibility” of its occurrence (see in short in: Barak, The Judge in a Democratic Society, at pp. 272-272; Hen, at p. 296; HCJ 10271/02 Fried v. Israel Police—Jerusalem Region [2006] IsrSC 62(1) 106, at pp. 152-153; Barak, Freedom of Information, at p. 101-102).\n\nIn the present matter, the public’s right to information, which as stated is a right of a constitutional nature, in that it is derived from the right of freedom of expression, is in competition with the public interest in the efficient functioning of the judiciary, which also encapsulates the interests of protection of the rule of law and maintenance of public confidence in the courts. I would clarify that I do not believe that the opposing interest is the moral integrity of the judicial process, for even the pleadings of the appellants in no way intimate that they are concerned that publication will affect the exercise of judicial discretion. The balance in question is, therefore, one which is vertical in nature.\n\n55. In the past, this Court has considered the exception in sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law, and has determined that anyone seeking to invoke it must show that the disclosure of the information will lead, with a high degree of probability, to real harm to the public interest, which the authority seeks to protect in declining to disclose that information:\n\nSection 9(b)(1) is formulated in broad and inclusive terms. The provision permits the public authority not to deliver “information, disclosure of which is liable to disrupt the proper functioning of the public authority, or its ability to carry out its duties.\n\n.” It has rightly been said of this provision that it “opens the door to a distortion of the very right to obtain information” (Segal, at p. 199). Interpretation of the section must, therefore, adapt itself to the criteria that guide the Law and to the general and constitutional principles that are accepted in our law. It is a well-known, established rule in our law that where there is a clash between a protected constitutional right and a public interest, the latter takes precedence over the former only where there is an appropriate standard of probability—normally, “near certainty”—of real harm to that public interest is met… This rule is particularly applicable in the case of a clash between freedom of expression and other public interests (see Kol Ha’am; HCJ 4804/94 Station Film Co. v. The Film Review Board IsrSC 84 (5) 661). The formula that emerged from the abundant case law regarding freedom of expression and its constraints is applicable to our case as well.\n\n…\n\nIndeed, there is an important public interest in preserving the orderly functioning of a public authority, but only where there is near certainty of harm to that interest will there be sufficient cause for limiting the freedom of information. Let us be precise: where it is possible to reduce the harm to the orderly functioning of the authority without negating the freedom of information, it is right and proper to do so. The restriction of freedom of information is a last resort, and the public authority has a duty, before it decides not to hand over the information whose disclosure is being sought, to examine means that are less detrimental to the freedom of information ( Ministry of Transport, at p. 84-85 (emphasis added, E.A.). See also AAA 1245/12 Movement for Freedom of Information v. Ministry of Education [Nevo – August 23,2012] (hereinafter: Ministry of Education), para. 7 per Vice-President E. Rivlin).\n\nA similar view regarding the fact that the relevant probability criterion within the bounds of sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law is that of near certainty was also expressed by Segal (p. 199), and by President Barak who noted that “… within the bounds of the external balance and against the background of the purpose of the Law, only severe, serious disruption whose occurrence is a near certainty allows for the non-disclosure of information” (Aharon Barak, “Freedom of Information and the Courts”, Kiryat Hamishpat 3 (5763-2003) 95, 102-103). I too accept that for the purpose of restricting the citizen’s access to information, the authority must meet a strict standard of near certainty of the occurrence of harm to a competing protected interest which is recognized by the law.\n\n56. The appellants sought to argue that the more lenient standard, i.e., that of “reasonable probability”, ought to be applied in our case, as was done in the cases cited above, in order to ensure protection of the legal process and its integrity. I beg to differ. First, in the cases of Dissenchik and Azulai, there was concern for damage to the integrity of a judicial proceceding that was actually taking place, against the background of the contents that had been published. In the present case, the appellants plead concern about the general effect of publicizing the performance of the judges. This concern is based, even if only partially, on assumptions and speculation, and assumes that the publication per se will affect the general conduct of the judges. In my view, and I will elaborate below, this argument is difficult to accept, and in all events it does not justify invoking a more lenient standard. Another significant difference emerges from the decision of (then) Justice A. Barak in Azulai, who explained that in the context of a violation of sub judice (sec. 41 [then] of the Courts Law, 5717-1957), the criterion of reasonable probability is not only directed at harm done to a judge:\n\nTill now I discussed the possible effect on the professional judge. Needless to say, sec. 41 of the Law does not deal exclusively with a judge. It is concerned with publication that has the potential to affect the course of the trial or its outcome. It may be a litigant who is affected; or the witnesses. It would seem that it, in fact, the judge is the strongest link in this chain, whereas the witnesses are the weakest link. Frequently, there is a reasonable probability of the witnesses having been influenced, whether by way of dissuading a witness from testifying or by influencing—consciously or otherwise—the contents of his testimony. This is the reasonable probability that sec. 41 is intended to prevent (ibid., at p. 577; cf. also the words of Justice Berinson in Dissenchik, at p. 185).\n\nTo this must be added that sub judice involves the restriction of the freedom of expression regarding a particular matter for a limited period—as long as the trial is proceeding. In our case, the restriction sought by appellants is much wider. Moreover, I will point out that even though, in the cases on which the appellants sought to rely, the reasonable probability standard was selected for balancing between protection of the judicial process and other rights and interests, there are other cases in which, when the freedom of expression comes up against the interest of protection of the legal system, it was in fact the standard of near certainty that was selected (see, e.g., HCJ 506/89 Be’eri v. Head of Claims Department, Investigations Division, Israel Police National Headquarters [1990] IsrSC 44(1) 604 (hereinafter: Be’eri), a p. 607).\n\n57. The cases to which the appellants referred dealt with the balance between the freedom of expression and preservation of the integrity of the judicial process and due process. Apart from the fact that, as stated, I do not think that our case relates to the integrity of the judicial process, these cases did not deal with a balance that involved the right to information. It is important to emphasize that in the context of disclosure of information that is held by public authorities, there is a special legislative arrangement, viz., the Freedom of Information Law, and the balances it requires must be made in light of the purposes of the Law, and in particular, the purpose of the transparency of public authorities in order to allow for oversight of their activity. Moreover, as Segal explains in his book, the Law was applied to the administrative aspect of the activity of the courts, and the committee to examine the implications of the Freedom of Information Law for the courts system, headed by Judge J. Tsur, found that out of respect for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Law, the judiciary should not be granted protection or immunity in relation to the administrative aspect of its task (Segal, at p. 143). In light of this, the argument that in relation to courts, the more lenient probability standard should be adopted as a starting point, in order to protect the judicial process is troublesome: it seeks to create a different standard for the courts precisely where the legislator saw fit to subject them to the Freedom of Information Law, albeit regarding the administrative plane of their activity, with which we are dealing. I therefore see no justification for abandoning the framework that was established by the Law and the case law for considering petitions under the Freedom of Information Law by making do with a lenient probability standard, and therefore, I reject this argument.\n\nFrom here we will proceed on a path that will lead us to a decision. Only if it is found with near certainty that publication of the requested information will interfere with the activity of the judiciary or with its ability to perform its task, in that it will detract from the confidence of the public in the judges and affect judicial independence, will the appellants have cause to refrain from delivering the information under sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law.\n\nDisruption of Proper Functioning of the Authority or its Ability to Carry Out Its Duties\n\n58. The argument of the appellants that publication of the requested information will disrupt the proper function of the courts or their ability to carry out their duties, and that they may therefore avail themselves of the exception in sec. 9(b)(1) of the Law, is built on several levels. The first is their argument that the requested information does not create a reliable picture of the load on the system or on a particular judge in the system. At the second level it is argued that the distorted picture that will be painted by this information will harm the judges in various ways—it was explained that handing over the information while connecting it to the names of judges does not comport with the purpose of the Freedom of Information Law. It will cause the individual judges to be seen as being exclusively responsibile for these numbers, but to which, in fact, various systemic problems contributed; it will harm their reputations and cause them to feel that they have been wronged; it will be detrimental to their functioning, because they will be judged by the public exclusively on the basis of quantifiable parameters, which do not reflect the quality of their work and its nature; it will be burdensome to them, due to the need to deal with distorting criticism. It was also mentioned that releasing the data would make it difficult for the system to recruit suitable judicial candidates in the future, and that there was a concern about misuse of the information. All these, according to the appellants, will lead to a third layer—to the serious outcome of harm to public confidence in judges as a result of incomplete, distorted information, leading to disrespect for the judges and to harm to judicial independence, due to distorted personal information, which has the potential for embarrassment and intimidation and for upsetting the equanimity which is essential to the functioning of a judge. I will stress that from the appellants’ arguments it emerges that they are not arguing that the publication will affect the discretion that the judges exercise, but that it will affect the conditions necessary for them to perform optimally.\n\nThe Requested Information – An Incomplete Picture\n\n59. There is merit in the appellants’ argument that presentation of the requested information does not create a reliable picture—neither of the burden on the courts system, nor of the caseload of any particular judge. The reasons for this are many and varied, most of which were elaborated upon by the appellants in their appeal.\n\nThe requested information concerns only the district courts and the Supreme Court, and it does not, therefore, reflect the overload in the courts system in its entirety. Moreover, I accept that data as to the number of open cases and the date on which each case was opened, even when added to other data published by the courts system, present a limited, incomplete picture which does not shed light on the reasons for the duration of the "
