        "text": "On Tuesday, local Israeli media claimed that, within the framework of a widespread budget cut, the Ministry of Immigration and Absorption drastically reduced the financial assistance given to new immigrants for their first rent payments.\n\nThe information came from a statement from the Knesset Committee on Immigration, Absorption and Diaspora Affairs, led by Oded Forer, of the opposition Yisrael Beytenu party.\n\nThe official document revealed that, starting with the immigrants who arrived in Israel last March, the assistance figure will be NIS 363 per month, which is equivalent to $97.\n\nThe period will be two years, which translates into a total assistance of $2.340. Until now, the total assistance was $4.430, delivered monthly over a five-year period.\n\nNew immigrants will receive additional assistance only if they settle in the so-called national priority areas, which include, for example, communities located on the border with the Gaza Strip. Immigrants who relocate to these areas will receive up to an extra $400 per month, depending on family composition.\n\nForer was against the measure at the last committee meeting, explaining that it was a very harsh message for immigrants and clarifying that they had asked “the ministry to show us the emerging reform in the committee before it was made.” public, but it did not happen.”"
