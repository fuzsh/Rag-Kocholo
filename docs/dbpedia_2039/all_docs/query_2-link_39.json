        "text": "Amazing event yesterday run by BioIndustry Association (BIA) to present their Deep BioTech report (https://deepbiotech.org/). I may be boring everyone by repeating the same thing over and over, but this report reinforces my view of the power of #SyntheticBiology to redefine core industries and, in the words of BIA’ CEO Steve Bates OBE FMedSci \"unlock a healthy bioeconomy by replacing environmentally damaging practices with a more sustainable bio-based ones”. Deep Blue BioTech is on a clear journey to unlock this power in the Beauty & and Wellbeing industry, landing a new generation of bioactives that will not only be sustainable but highly-efficacious for the industry’s core benefits. We’re getting there, faster than you think. 🚀 I loved the panel chaired by Linda Bedenik showing that UK’s intention to become a global leader in Engineering Biology is creating the supporting structure for start-ups like us can hit the ground running. Isabel Webb's assessment of where the key pain points are was spot on and it was nice to hear from Rita Cruz on how players like Ingenza Ltd can help us bridge that gap in preparation for international scale, where the government through arms like the British Patient Capital will speed up growth and scale, right George Mills, CFA? We're counting on that. Always great to catch up with the familiar and new faces making this journey happen (Sara Holland, Isabel Zhang, Sasan Fouladi-Pour, Nick Goodwin, Jack Weaver) If you want to know how SynBio can make ingredients even better, reach out!

This includes the likes of Number 8 bio, creating carbon-neutral food products for agriculture, Nourish Ingredients, building animal-free fats to make plant-based food tastier and Psylo, leveraging inspiration from natural psychedelics to create next-gen therapeutics to treat mental illness. 🐄 🍄 Many of these companies are making their way into our lives in very big ways through partnerships with the likes of lululemon (Samsara Eco), Quicksilver (Uluu) and Norco Co-operative Limited (Eden Brew), translating research into real-world value. We’re proud to play a role in supporting what has the potential to be one of Australia’s major industries and are continuing to invest in and build incredible companies in the space.

In our food and personal care products, this is typically achieved using #TitaniumDioxide. However, its associated #health and #environmental #concerns are driving regulators to ban its use in edible products. The market is intensively looking for alternatives, which until now fail to meet the holy Trifecta of price/performance/sustainability! That's where our #NewPortfolioCompany, EcoCrystal, shines—introducing a revolutionary #alternative that ticks all the boxes. With a team of experts from renowned institutions like the Technion, Teva , and the Weizmann Institute of Science, Ecocrystal is poised to seize the $ billions narket opportunity in replacing titanium dioxide. Their recent acceptance into StartLife's accelerator program marks a significant milestone in their journey toward reshaping the standards of food pigments>> https://lnkd.in/eeG8P25P #FoodTechExperts #StartupIncubator #IsraelInnovation Noga Sela Shalev, Tammy Meiron, Ph.D., Daniel Gamsu, Hadas Sibony Benyamini, Sapir Hashmonai, Tnuva, Tempo Beverages Ltd, OurCrowd, Finistere Ventures, Israel Innovation Authority רשות החדשנות, Dvir Gur, Nimrod Yavo, Elad Arie, Guy Samburski\n\nThe limitations of resources and the continuous increase in population bring the challenge of feeding nearly 10 billion people by 2050. In this race, the search for alternative protein sources is gaining more prominence in discussions. In the pursuit of new #technologies and #resources, the food industry is gearing up for this #reality, with the goal of #sustainability in current productions. We at GEMÜ Brazil, one of the world leaders in the manufacturing of valves, measurement, and control systems, with the support of The Good Food Institute and JBT Corporation, are hosting a workshop on #alternative protein and the #technologies involved in production through #fermentation and #cellcultivation. The event will take place in a #hybrid format and aims to bring together companies, research institutes, startups working in food technology, government and non-governmental organizations, among others, with the purpose of fostering innovation in food systems.
