        "text": "Israeli Official Incitement between September 1 – September 30, 2018\n\nThis report includes examples of recent inciting statements made by top Israeli officials, mainly ministers and members of the Israeli Knesset, against the Palestinian people including refugees, prisoners, and martyrs. It highlights inciting statements against UNRWA, the Palestinian Bedouin village of Khan Al-Ahmar, in addition to other statements in support of the U.S. decision to cut off funding to hospitals in occupied East Jerusalem. It also includes statements made against the Palestinian President and leadership, as well as against the indigenous Palestinian citizens of Israel.\n\nI. On Palestinian Refugees/ UNRWA\n\nMK (Yesh Atid) Yair Lapid, ( Twitter, 15 September)\n\n“Congratulations to the Belgian Government on its decision to stop funding Palestinian Ministry of Education which is encouraging terrorism. It is time that all European countries stop funding UNRWA as well.”\n\nMinister of Transportation and Road Safety, Minister of Intelligence and MK (Likud) Yisrael Katz, (Twitter, 11 September)\n\n“I welcome the initiative of the US President to re-settle the Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. The Refugees’ problem was formulated by the Arab and Palestinian leaders to use it as a leverage to claim the “right of return” and as an attempt to destroy Israel, it is good that this issue disappears from the world.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Bezalel Smotrich, (Twitter, 2 September)\n\n“Seventy Percent of Gaza strip residents are refugees. The only way to solve the Gaza problem is by reducing its population to adapt with its capacity. At this stage, we must disperse the refugees in other countries. Closing UNRWA must be the first step in this plan.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev, (Twitter, 1 September)\n\n“It is good that the US decided to stop funding UNRWA which has been involved in the past years in the education for terrorism and the annihilation of Israel more than supporting the refugees themselves. It is another significant step on the way to strengthen the State of Israel. Thanks to the United States of America”\n\nMK (Likud) Anat Berko (Facebook, 23 September)\n\n\" (....) UNRWA, an organization that perpetuates the Palestinian \"eternal refugee\", will disappear in light of the cessation of US funding, and the \"claim of return\" is a recipe for national suicide, therefore no Palestinian \"refugee\" will enter the territory of the State of Israel. I affirm this to you, no refugee…..”\n\nII. On Khan Al-Ahmar Bedouin Village\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Bezalel Smotrich, (Twitter, 6 September)\n\n“For those interested in facts about Khan Al-Ahmar must read the report of Regavim movement. Do not miss the chance to listen to the statement made by the head of activists in that place, which does not conceal the fact that the Palestinian Authority and the European Union used those people and turned them into toys against their will to pressure Israel.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev, (Twitter, 5 September)\n\n“I call upon the public security minister to instruct the army and his coordinator in the West Bank to start implementing the decision of the court and evacuate Al-Khan Al-Ahmar. In return, to execute the law and prevent Bedouins from settling in Judea and Samaria (occupied West Bank).”\n\nMinister of “Defense” Avigdor Lieberman, (Twitter, 5 September)\n\n“Khan Al-Ahmar will be evacuated. Congratulations to the judges of the High Court of Justice for making this bold and necessary decision while Abu Mazen, the Israeli left as well as some European countries are waging an orchestrated hypocritical campaign. No one is above the law, we won’t allow anyone to harm our sovereignty and responsibility as a state.”\n\nIII. On Palestinian Prisoners/Martyrs\n\nMinister of “Defense” Avigdor Lieberman, (Twitter, 16 September)\n\n“I decided to immediately suspend the appointment of the Advisory Committee to examine the imposition of imprisonment on terrorists. I am about to discuss this issue thoroughly with the Israeli army, the prosecutor as well as the security services. We won’t allow the bastard terrorists to dream about shortening their sentences”\n\nMK (Likud) Miki Zohar, (Twitter, 16 September)\n\n“Terrorism does not stem from despair, but from hope, the hope for liquidating the Jewish people. The argument over reducing sentences to terrorists would encourage the murderers. Only death penalty for terrorists and the demolition of their homes will bring about the necessary deterrence.”\n\nMinister of Culture and Sport and MK (Likud) Miri Regev, (Twitter, 16 September)\n\n“Shortening sentence for the murderers, the terrorists, would give them hope and encourage them to kill. The terrorists must be rotten in prison...”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev, (Twitter, 16 September)\n\n“We are working on – approving the immediate construction of hundreds of additional residential units in Gush Etzion, we will establish new neighborhood that would carry name of Ari in Efrat where he lived. We will deter – and ensure that the family of the terrorist won’t receive money from the Palestinian Authority and we will stop all funds transferred by the Palestinian Authority to the families of the murderers.”\n\nMK (Likud) Oren Hazan, (Twitter, 15 September)\n\n“… to reduce sentences to the murderers? Forget that as long as I am an MK. We should not reduce sentences to human animals – the only thing to do is to shorten their lives by imposing death penalty\n\nIV. On President Mahmoud Abbas's Speech before the United Nations General Assembly (27 September)\n\nMinister of Construction and Housing Yoav Galant, (Twitter)\n\n“Abu Mazen calls for hatred, whoever calls terrorists and murderers as heroes can never be a partner and cannot share the life together. Mahmoud Abbas must understand simple facts, that Israel is a strong and prosperous Zionist Jewish state and that Jerusalem is its eternal capital.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev (Twitter)\n\n“The PLO finances the families of the murderers, glorifies the martyrs and the Palestinian charter to destroy Israel in stages, the PLO vision has never changed. The land of Israel is the land of the Jewish people, to where we returned after thousands of years of being in exile. We will live here and we will create a life of peace not terrorism.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev (Twitter)\n\n“Abu Mazen is hiding the lies of terrorism behind his suit. Starting from his doctoral thesis in which he denies the holocaust to educating children on destroying Israel. A state of Palestinian terrorism will never be here. The united Jerusalem was and will remain the capital of Israel. Between the Jordan River and the sea only one state will rule, the state of Israel.”\n\nMinister of Education and Minister of Diaspora Affairs Naftali Bennett (Twitter)\n\n“Abu Mazen speech reminds us of one basic fact: a nation that hallow the murderers, and a chairman who finances terrorists would never attain a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel. We are here to prevent it.”\n\nMinister of “Defense” Avigdor Lieberman (Twitter)\n\n“The speech of Abu Mazen is all about saying “No No”. It was the stock of all insults and disappointments since the day he was born. Instead of responding positively to the Israeli and American offers to achieve an agreement, he is concerned of closing the accounts and drag the region into conflict. We will stand firmly against any attempt to harm the lives of our citizens and will make those responsible pay the price”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Bezalel Smotrich, (Twitter)\n\n“It is good that this pathological liar is saying once the truth: The issue of Khan Al-Ahmar is not an issue of human rights or existence. It is an issue of a strategic national struggle led by the Arabs with the support of Europeans in order to control Adumim area, it is a struggle over the question of whether there will be an Arab territorial contiguity from north to south or a Jewish contiguity from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea that would prevent an Arab contiguity.”\n\nMK (Likud) Anat Berko, (Facebook)\n\n“This “permanent claim” of Palestinians after 70 years is an exaggerated issue and it is time to stop talking about and put it off the negotiating table. Abu Mazen does not recognize the Jewish state, Abu Mazen does not recognize the Jewish state, and more importantly, he is surrounded by the dancing swords of the Palestinian terrorist organizations…..”\n\nV. On the Meeting between President Mahmoud Abbas and Former Israeli PM Ehud Olmert in Paris on 21 September\n\nMK (Likud) Ayoub Kara (Twitter, 22 September)\n\n“Olmert's meeting with Mahmoud Abbas teaches us a lot about both. First: the failed PM who ended up in jail and despite his generous and arrogant proposals he repeatedly rejected an “unreal partner” who is trying to sell us now. Second: it is well known worldwide who is the one rejecting peace, continuing to pay salaries to the murderers and inciting/supporting terrorism.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev (Twitter, 22 September)\n\n“Olmert met with Abu Mazen, who educates Palestinian children to kill Jews and destroy the state of Israel. Both are alike.”\n\nVI. On the US Closure of the General Delegation of the PLO to the U.S.\n\nMK (Likud) Yehuda Glick, (Twitter, 15 September)\n\n“Not only the US, but Belgium as well. The world began to realize the Palestinian lies and is not ashamed to say it in the face. We are sick of the double standard policy, it is painful to witness the existence of a corrupted leadership for the Palestinian civilians who wish to live here in peace, a leadership that the last thing it cares about is the Palestinian citizen.”\n\nPM Netanyahu, at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting (PMO Website, 12 September)\n\n\"The US made the correct decision when it decided to close the PLO offices in Washington. The Palestinians refuse to enter negotiations with Israel even as they attack Israel with false claims in international forums. Israel very much appreciates the Trump administration decision and supports American actions that are designed to make it clear to the Palestinians that the refusal to enter into negotiations with Israel and the unbridled attacks against Israel will not only not advance peace but will certainly not make things better for the Palestinians.”\n\nDeputy Minister in the Israeli PM Office, MK (Kulanu), Michael Oren, (Twitter, 11 September)\n\n“Closing the PLO's DC embassy sends exactly the right message: the Palestinians will no longer be rewarded for rejecting peace talks and violating US law. If incentives couldn't bring them to the table perhaps punishment will.”\n\nMinister of Public Security, Strategic Affairs and Minister of Information, MK (Likud) Gilad Erdan (Twitter, 11 September)\n\nIn an interview with RT kann news on the closure of Palestinian Mission in Washington: “rejoicing over Trump’s step is very understandable. Finally, the leader of the largest superpower in the world came and ended the Palestinian lies. What if there were official contacts with the Palestinian Authority? I suppose we would have met as Likud to brainstorm and identify what is proposed on the table, but…..”\n\nDeputy Minister in the Ministry of “Defense”, MK (Jewish Home) Eli Ben Dahan, (Twitter, 11 September)\n\n“Historical justice- Trump’s Administration has repeatedly demonstrated its just fixed position towards Israel by deciding to close the PLO mission in Washington, which was working to sow poison against Israel in the corridors of the US Government over the past years. It is good that Israel has real friends across the sea!”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev, (Twitter, 11 September)\n\n“The closure of the PLO embassy in the United States showed the entire world that the PLO, known as ' Palestinian Authority ', is a terrorist organization that has never had a state and will never have a state and therefore there no justification for the existence of such a mission, as its interest is to distort the image of Israel in the United States and the world.”\n\nDeputy Minister in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MK (Likud) Tzipi Hotovely (Twitter, 11 September)\n\n“The American administration’s decision to close the PLO mission in Washington is a courageous right one. Trump administration continues to send a sharp message to the Palestinians that whoever acts against Israel will pay a price.”\n\nMinister of Transportation and Road Safety, Minister of Intelligence MK (Likud) Yisrael Katz, (Twitter, September 11, 2018)\n\n“Trump unveils the Palestinian lies. Abu Mazen told him “May your house be destroyed” – why did he think [Abu Mazen] that he will continue to transfer him money?”\n\nMinister of Regional Cooperation, MK (Likud) Tzahi Hanegbi (Twitter, September 11, 2018)\n\n“Four and a half years after abandoning negotiations and waging a world-wide incitement campaign against Israel, Abu Mazen learns from Trump that there is a price for such a defiant policy.”\n\nMK (Likud) Anat Bertko, (Twitter, 10 September) - The post was later deleted.\n\n“They are closing the embassy of a “nation” that were recently created. Don’t you know that the PLO terrorist organization has embassies abroad more than the State of Israel? It is good that president Trump is making an additional step that is useful to end the illusions of Palestinians, “a nation” that was recently created, by closing the embassy of PLO in Washington. The profession of “Palestinian refuge” and the claim of the“right of return” are both coming into an end, thanks to the Israeli fixed position led by Netanyahu as well as the responsible and reasonable US administration that has no intention to fund the Palestinian rejectionists who got used to live on aid money without attempting to reach a real solution but to “liquidate the state of Israel”.”\n\nVII. On US decision to Cut Off funding to Palestinian Hospitals in Occupied East Jerusalem\n\nMK (Zionist Camp) Eyal Ben Reuven, (Twitter, 8 September)\n\n“Will we bring the Palestinians to the negotiating table by reducing the possibility of treating cancer patients in East Jerusalem? There is a chance to exert pressure, we should help the Americans to make the right choices regarding the pressure points”\n\nVIII. Against the Indigenous Palestinian Citizens of Israel\n\nMK (Likud) Anat Berko (Twitter, 24 September)\n\n“Since the past and still at present the [Joint List] MKs are working to undermine the existence of our state, and are using their positions, statuses and their diplomatic passports to destroy the state of Israel from within and distort its image in the world. …”\n\nMK (Likud) Anat Berko, (Facebook, 12 September)\n\n“We have to withdraw immunity of Tibi and Zahalka who are both now in Cairo. They arrived to Cairo to combat the nation-state law which was legislated in the Knesset where they work as members. I have news for you, according to the law of MKs immunity, to annul the existence of Israel as a state for the Jewish people means toppling your immunity….I will continue to work to cancel their immunity and dismiss MK Tibi from his position as deputy Knesset head.”\n\nMK (Yisrael Beitenu) Oded Forer wrote against Joint List MKs meeting with the Secretary General of Arab League in Cairo (Twitter, 11 September 2018)\n\n“Both Arafat’s advisor and the terrorist who was jailed seem smiling, they receive a salary from the State of Israel just to work against it. They spit in the face of the state and the law enforcement system is not stopping this farce. I had already turned to the General Attorney to open an investigation and in the meantime they allow themselves to cross another red line. It is better that they remain in Cairo.”\n\nMinister of Transportation and Road Safety, Minister of Intelligence and MK (Likud) Yisrael Katz in an interview with 103FM, (Twitter, September 4, 2018)\n\n“Arab MKs who met with Federica Mogherini who is leading a hypocritical policy against Israel, are working against the state….they were disappointed she even informed them that the nation-state law is an Israeli internal issue…same Arab MKs appealed to the UN and EU , we should get rid of them prior to the next elections.”\n\nMK (Likud) Anat Berko, (Twitter, September 3, 2018)\n\n“We must dismiss MK Tibi right now from his position as deputy Knesset head. I have asked the head of the Knesset to dismiss him from his position. Tibi and his colleagues are enemies of Israel in the Israeli Knesset!”\n\nAlso on the same day, Berko responded to MK Aida Touma’s post on Twitter regarding the Joint List MKs visit to Brussels and their meeting with European officials. Berko wrote on Twitter:\n\n“You can continue dreaming about another failed Arab state in the place of the State of Israel…I will also arrive soon to Brussels to brief them also about your anti-democratic subversive behavior in the Israeli Knesset, do not swear loyalty….and MK Touma Sleiman, it is worth taking this opportunity to discuss the status of Christians in the Palestinian Authority areas and the Middle East, this is an important issue.”\n\nMK (Likud) Avi Dichter, (Facebook, September 4, 2018) / Reported by I`lam Media Center (Arab Center for Media Freedom, Development and Research )\n\n“Together we will defeat the gang of liars of the Joint List, the Arab MKs are heading to Brussels to distort the reputation of Israel because of nation-state law. Share this video on the nation-state law, we have translated it into English so that the world would know the truth.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev, (Times of Israel, 3 September)\n\nAgainst Joint List MKs: “We congratulate you for leaving Israel. This is what you want. Welcome to all those arriving and blessed are those who are leaving. This is not your country. This land will always be the Land of Israel and all the traitors should leave.” “Even Ramallah will be part of Israel. Go to Paris, go to Britain, go to your anti-Semitic friends, go to whomever you want. Your place is in the departure lounge.”\n\nMinister of the Economy and Industry, MK (Kunalu) Eli Cohen (Twitter, 11 September)\n\nCommenting on an article published by Ynet on 10 September titled “Palestinians send incendiary tires to Israeli shores”, Cohen wrote:\n\n“Animals”\n\nMK (Likud) Oren Hazan, (Twitter, 5 September)\n\n“If we have indeed attacked Gaza, as we attacked Syria (according to foreign reports), then preparations won’t have been necessary. Hamas would have become paralyzed, and Israel’s deterrence would have grown stronger, silence would have prevailed in our districts and the Negev would have flourished.”\n\nDeputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s office, MK (Kulanu) Michael Oren (Twitter, 26 September)\n\n“The meeting between the opposition chairman Tzipi Livni and Mahmoud Abbas says a lot about the Israeli left. They strive for a meeting with a Holocaust denier, a person who makes anti-Semitic speeches and finances the killing of Jewish, who sues Israel in the Hague and above all- a man who rejects Peace.”\n\nMK (Jewish Home) Moti Yogev, (Twitter, 16 September)\n\n“Cut off – stop the chiefs of the education system in the Palestinian Authority and halt the incitement and anti-Semitic propaganda against Israel in the Palestinian educational institutions.”"
