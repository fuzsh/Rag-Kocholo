        "text": "EVEN ALAN J. PAKULA, the veteran director who has seen his share of hard times on movie sets, does not shy away from the word ''disaster'' to describe some aspects of filming ''The Devil's Own'' last year.\n\nBrad Pitt, one of the two stars, threatened to quit early in the shoot, complaining that the script was incomplete and incoherent. He later denounced the movie as ''the most irresponsible bit of film making -- if you can even call it that -- that I've ever seen.'' The co-star, Harrison Ford, kept his mouth shut at the time but said recently that there was little that he would disagree with in Mr. Pitt's criticisms. Ego clashes, budget overruns and long delays plagued the project.\n\nEvery few years, Hollywood produces a movie that months before its release is labeled the next ''Ishtar,'' ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' or ''Heaven's Gate.'' Usually the same factors are present -- big stars, a big-name director, big money and big, last-minute rewrites, all colliding like cars in a freeway pileup.\n\n''The Devil's Own,'' which opened on Wednesday, had all those elements. And yet, judging from the early reviews, it has avoided joining Hollywood's pantheon of debacles. Even Weekly Variety said that the movie, ''a well-crafted suspenser, bears no signs of the much-reported on-set difficulties.'' The film tells the story of a New York City police officer (Mr. Ford) who takes into his family's home a young man (Mr. Pitt) who turns out to be a fugitive Irish Republican Army soldier.\n\nHollywood has a long tradition of being able to redeem the most troubled shoots with good, and occasionally great, movies. ''Casablanca'' and ''The Godfather'' are two prominent examples.\n\nStill, Mr. Pakula does not seem eager to repeat the experience of ''The Devil's Own.''\n\n''I can't imagine what it would have been like if it had been my first film,'' he said in his Manhattan office, recounting the stream of negative stories that appeared last year in both the Hollywood trade papers and the mainstream press during the shoot's six long months.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
