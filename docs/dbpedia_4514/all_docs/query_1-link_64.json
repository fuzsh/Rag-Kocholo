        "text": "Almost 20 (!!!!) years after The Devil Wears Prada debuted in 2006, it's been reported that Disney is developing a follow-up film for the franchise‚Äînews that left us all:\n\nThe announcement almost instantly sparked nostalgia among audiences who cherished Meryl Streep's iconic portrayal of Runway Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway's character Andrea (aka Andy) Sachs's transformation from fashion novice to fashionista. Oh, and let's not forget Emily Blunt's *chef's kiss* performance and ironic/comedic relief by way of her character Emily Charlton.\n\nWith details emerging about the sequel's storyline and potential cast, here's everything you need to know about The Devil Wears Prada sequel.\n\nWhen was The Devil Wears Prada sequel announced?\n\nOn July 8, 2024, the OMG-worthy news about the project *officially* dropped. According to Puck News‚Äîthe first outlet to report on it‚ÄîDisney is developing a follow-up to the iconic film, with the original 2006 hit's screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna apparently in conversation to write the script.\n\nP.S. According to Deadline, Wendy Finerman, producer of the original film, is set to develop the sequel *and* David Frankel, director of the original film, might be back as well. The more ya know!\n\nWhat will The Devil Wears Prada sequel be about?\n\nPer Variety, the project's storyline ‚Äúreportedly follows [Miranda] Priestly as she navigates her career amid the decline of traditional magazine publishing and faces off against [Emily] Blunt‚Äôs character, now a high-powered executive for a luxury group with advertising dollars that Priestly desperately needs.‚Äù TL;DR: There's likely gonna be no shortage of *chef's kiss* moments that'll make fans of the original incredibly happy.\n\nWho will be in it?\n\nAccording to Puck News, Meryl Streep will reportedly reprise her role as Runway editor Miranda Priestly alongside fellow actor Emily Blunt, who played her assistant in the original film. That! Said!!! Neither the actors nor Disney has confirmed this, so we'll just have to keep manifesting it happens. üïØÔ∏èüïØÔ∏èüïØÔ∏è\n\nAdditionally/sadly, Anne Hathaway is also not guaranteed to work on the sequel, though she *has* publicly spoken out about her feelings on a follow-up to the beloved 2006 film‚Äîand tbh, her thoughts on it kinda make us üò≠.\n\n‚ÄúI don't think a continuation of that story is probably ever gonna happen,‚Äù the actor confessed to E! News back in March. However, Anne also noted that she's beyond grateful for how impactful the movie still is all these years later, adding, ‚ÄúThe reason that movie felt so special was that we were a team and we did that work, but really it's the love that everybody pours to it.‚Äù\n\nAnd just a month later, in April 2024, during an interview with V Magazine, the celeb shared similar sentiments after being asked about the likelihood of a The Devil Wears Prada sequel: ‚ÄúProbably not. We all love each other and if somebody could come up with a way to do it, I think we‚Äôd all be crazy not to. But there‚Äôs a huge difference in the world now with technology, and one of the things about that particular story is it was about producing a physical object. Now with so much being digital, it would just be very different. Maybe me, Stanley [Tucci], Emily [Blunt], Meryl [Streep], Dave Frankel, Patricia Field‚Ä¶we should just all do something else together. That‚Äôd be fun.‚Äù\n\nLegit all of us after reading this ^^^:\n\nSpeaking of Stanley Tucci, though...the actor has fully been quoted as saying he'd ‚Äúhappily play Nigel again‚Äù as recently as last year. üëÄ\n\nWhen will The Devil Wears Prada sequel come out?\n\n*Le sigh* While a million girls would kill to see this movie in theatres RTFN, we don't know for sure when it'll debut. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n\nAnything else?\n\nIn the years since the original The Devil Wears Prada film came out, fans everywhere have been obsessed with the fact that Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, and Anne Hathaway occasionally continue the project's lore, most recently by reuniting at the SAG Awards in February 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Anne and Emily sat down late last year and reminisced about making the movie for Variety‚Äôs ‚ÄúActors on Actors‚Äù series. ‚ÄúWe just had a joy bomb of a time on that movie. I don‚Äôt know if any of us knew it was going to become what it did. It‚Äôs quoted to me every week. It will be the movie that changed my life,‚Äù Emly said during the convo. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre in the The Devil Wears Prada club together,‚Äù Anne added.\n\nAaaaaand that's pretty much all we know about the highly-anticipated sequel, but definitely make sure to check back for any and all updates! In the meantime..."
