        "text": "I’m continuing my journey of the Top-100 Action Movies from the 1990’s covering films 90-81. There’s a little of it all in this list from cyber-thrillers, to sci-fi, to comics, with maybe an assassin tale, or two. So, let’s get into it.\n\n90. The Net (1995)\n\nComing in at #90 is a modestly forgotten computer thriller that still holds up from 1995 starring Sandra Bullock as a computer programmer that realizes escape is impossible when you’re caught in, The Net directed by Irwin Winkler.\n\nNow I’ll admit this movie is more of a pure thriller than a traditional action flick, but I still enjoy it, and when the action does hit it’s a suspenseful ride. It’s fun to go back and look at what was considered cutting-edge technology yet despite the aging of the tech, the ability to have your identity erased, or stolen, is even more really prevalent today than it was back in the mid-90s. The plot keeps a strong pace, it doesn’t muddle itself in unneeded story layers and it keeps the focus on Bullock who delivers a fantastic performance. She brings the emotional range, she feels like a normal person, and she brings life to this role and lands the action effectively. Dennis Miller is a lovable supporting character and really the main weakness in The Net for me, is the performance from Jeremy Northam who just doesn’t work for me as the main villain otherwise this is an enjoyable cyber thriller.\n\n89. The Devil’s Own (1997)\n\nI’m sticking with the theme of forgotten gems for my #89 movie, a moody crime-drama. It would star Harrison Ford as a man bound by duty. It would also star Brad Pitt as a man trapped by destiny, and both would discover what they’re willing to fight for in 1997’s The Devil’s Own directed by Alan J. Pakula.\n\nI always enjoy movies that showcase two actors from different generations who are able to go toe-to-toe and that’s what The Devil’s Own provides with Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt. The story here does have its pacing issues, and while it’s a serviceable plot, it’s not really a captivating one. This limits the film in terms of being an intriguing thriller. However, with the awesome performances from Pitt and Ford, the spots of suspense, and the gritty sequences of gunplay and violence, The Devil’s Own is a capable action flick with a little more meat to its bones than the genre usually provided during the era. The Boston settings give the film an appealing backdrop and overall, the atmosphere in this one is a strong positive. This may not be a film that will resonate with you, but when you sit down for it, what it does provide will grab and hold onto your attention.\n\n88. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)\n\nNow my #88 pick is certainly much more well-known. It’s based on the comic book character that became famous for their cartoon series. They’re four mutant turtles that are also teenage ninjas who are ‘Heroes in a Half Shell’ and the film would be their first live-action feature in 1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nThis may be a surprise pick to many but when you break this movie down it’s an entertaining action adventure with surprisingly advanced fight choreography. This is still the best big screen version of the ninja turtles we’ve ever gotten and it’s because of its balance of elements. The costumes still look cool, the comical banter cements the bond between these brothers, and the story despite its by-the-numbers plot, has a quick engaging pace. And I know it’s cliche, but what I love about this movie is how it brings the cartoon I grew up watching to life on the screen. This movie feels lived-in, just gritty enough, and despite the passing of the years the fight sequences this one still hold up and it’s always a great time going back in time to see the ninja turtles kicking ass.\n\n87. El Mariachi (1992)\n\nNext up at #87 is an indie film from a rookie director that never gained the same popularity of its Hollywood sequel. The film would star Carlos Gallegos as a mariachi with a guitar in his hand and a price on his head. He wasn’t looking for trouble, but it came looking for him in 1992’s El Mariachi directed by Robert Rodriguez.\n\nI’d consider El Mariachi to be about as raw as a film can get. It was crafted on less than 8 grand, and it gives the movie such a strong realism that it feels like you’re in this story with these characters. Now I would say the story is a bit thin, and the plot layering is limited, but Rodriguez’s direction and the brutal violence compensate nicely. The culture is steeped into this film and the lack of studio polish is actually a bonus. The performances are hit-and-miss, the pacing is a bit uneven, and it’s certainly not as widely popular as its well-known sequel Desperado starring Antonio Banderas (which is essentially a big-budget remake-esque) continuation of this film, but El Mariachi is indie filmmaking at its finest and the vibe of this movie can capture your imagination as a man with a guitar full of weapons flees a group of hitmen throughout the backstreets of Mexico.\n\n86. No Escape (1994)\n\nMoving along to my #86 movie, I have a sci-fi thriller that has gained a cult-following but one I think is under appreciated. It’s directed by Martin Campbell and stars Ray Liotta and Ernie Hudson as prisoners in a futuristic prison where there are no guards, no walls, and No Escape from 1994.\n\nI would consider No Escape to be one of the more hidden gems on this list. It’s a sound film on many levels yet it’s never gotten a proper release on Blu-ray and it’s rarely on streaming services. However, it’s a great action thriller with a dystopian setting, enjoyable layers of suspense, and gritty performances. Liotta, more a dramatic actor, is able to feel like an action lead here and he’s more than capable in the action department. Now the depiction of 2022 is a little off, but this movie’s apocalyptic setting is a perfect playground for thrilling action and inspiring worldbuilding. Stuart Wilson brings a ton of charming gravitas to his role. Lance Henriksen and Ernie Hudson deliver strong performances as well, and the production design is nicely detailed to make this an immersive action film with plenty of substance.\n\n85. The Big Hit (1998)\n\nNow my pick for #85 is another forgotten gem from the late 90s. It’s a ridiculously silly action comedy set inside the world of a socially anxious hitman with a bad stomach played by Mark Wahlberg and the movie is The Big Hit from 1998 also starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Christina Applegate.\n\nTo be honest I just love this movie for its over-the-top absurdity. Wahlberg is the star; he has his moments of humor and he’s certainly able to deliver all the stunt-work needed to make the dazzling choreography in this film work. But really the true star of the film is Lou Diamond Phillips as the villain who steals the show with a hilariously excessive performance. The Big Hit is like a parody of the assassin genre without being a parody of the genre and the alternate reality created in this movie is a humorous guilty pleasure escape. It’s super cheesy in places, but it has a short runtime and a tight consistent pace. The ensemble cast is strong as well and when this movie is leaning into the full-throttle action (which is frequent) The Big Hit is a wildly delightful ride of nonsense and hyper-violent killing, with a contagiously lighthearted charisma.\n\n84. Point of No Return (1993)\n\nI have another hitman film for my #84 pick, only this time it’s a hitwoman flick starring Bridget Fonda as a woman who was given a choice by the government, death, or life as an assassin, and there’s no turning back because she’s reached the Point of No Return from 1993 from director John Baham.\n\nThis remake of La Femme Nikita is not quite to the level of its original, but Bridget Fonda is kick-ass in this one. She brings more than enough screen presence to pull off the wide range of layers needed for this role. She feels vulnerable and timid at times but in complete control and relentless during other moments and her performance is what makes this movie a thrilling ride of intrigue, manipulation, and killing. The pace is swift, the story layers are continually moving, and the action is adrenaline pumping. With the supporting cast, led by Gabriel Bryne, all being able to elevate their roles. And Point of No Return doesn’t really get the attention it deserves. Sure, it was another American remake that came out a bit too soon, but the energy from Fonda’s performance is more than enough to validate its existence as one of the best action flicks from the decade.\n\n83. Darkman (1990)\n\nI have another great action film for my #83 pick. An action thriller that thrives in the shadows from director Sam Raimi. In the darkest hour, there is a light that shines on every human being, but one, Darkman from 1990 starring Liam Neeson and Frances McDormand.\n\nI think Darkman is Frankenstein meets the Phantom of the Opera meets vigilante superhero and the result is a thrilling adventure with an emotional core that has a surprising amount of sincerity. Raimi’s direction is fantastic; he stages the large action set-pieces skillfully and he brings an intimacy to the quiet moments of the story that gives the movie so much emotional grittiness. And you have to commend the performance from Liam Neeson as Darkman, he’s shrouded in gauze and gnarly skin, but Neeson is still able to bring heart to this man that connects to the viewer to have you rooting for his success. And the ambition this film shows in the action department results in sequences that are still very-much visually appealing all these years later. Some of the digital effects look a tad dated, but for the time this movie looked great, and it still looks good enough all these years later to make it a nostalgic ride.\n\n82. U.S. Marshals (1998)\n\nThe Cop who won’t ever stop is back for my #82 pick. But this time Tommy Lee Jones is chasing down a lot more than just a fugitive when he plays cat-and-mouse with Wesley Snipes in the modestly forgotten action gem U.S. Marshals from 1998.\n\nFrom top-to-bottom U.S. Marshals is a well-crafted action thriller that’s skillfully acted and filled with enough action to elevate the energy when needed. And I think had it not been a sequel to the massively successful The Fugitive that this movie would be much more remembered. The plot does get a bit convoluted in the back half but it’s more than enough to capture your imagination. There are spots of suspense, moments of drama, sprinkles of prickly humor from Jones, and the characters are all appealing. Jones’ personality is much more…robust in this one, but it works and Snipes is awesome as well. He’s able to bring the physicality of an action star but also has the acting chops to pair with Jones and it makes this hunt for an escaped fugitive a thrilling ride. The action stays grounded for the most part; it fits into the fabric of the story effectively, and the massive plane crash is still a wild watch all these years later.\n\n81. Hard Rain (1998)\n\nAnd for my #81 pick I have a fun, water logged action thriller starring Christian Slater as a armored truck driver who must stand between a group of criminals and $3M during the worst storm in living memory in 1998s Hard Rain also starring Morgan Freeman, Minnie Driver, and Randy Quaid.\n\nNow the plot of Hard Rain is admittedly generic. It’s a simple heist flick with all the usual trimmings but the rain and flooding are a great added element and far from just a gimmick. The rising waters create a charming element of tension during many moments and the action is mindless fun with plenty of gunplay and chase sequences like racing jet-skis through a flooded high school. The cast elevates the material. Slater is a solid lead. Minnie Driver is a strong addition, and both Morgan Freeman and Randy Quaid give Hard Rain two efficient villains. It’s also fun to see Freeman play against type, and Quaid is perfect as a sleazy sheriff. The film also keeps a quick pace, the story connects the weather-themed action nicely and the atmosphere this one provides is a great time.\n\nAnthony J. Digioia II © 2024 SilverScreen Analysis"
