        "text": "The idea of making a deal with the devil has appeared many times in works of popular culture. These pacts with the Devil can be found in many genres, including: books, music, comics, theater, movies, TV shows and games. When it comes to making a contract with the Devil, they all share the same prevailing desire, a mortal wants some worldly good for their own selfish gain, but in exchange, they must give up their soul for eternity.\n\nGenerally when Satan is depicted in these works, he is represented as a red-skinned man with horns or pointed ears on his head, hooves or bird-legs, a forked tail or one with a stinger, and a pitchfork. When trying to blend in or deceive somebody, often he is represented as a plain human being, and, in some instances, only his voice is heard.\n\nThe theme enjoyed a large run of popularity in the 20th century. At one point Anthony Boucher, editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, \"reported that fully 50 percent of his unsolicited submissions consisted of deal-with-the-devil stories or 'formalities of the hereafter', which as often as not involved the Devil\".[1]\n\nIn print\n\n[edit]\n\nComic books\n\nBaron Mordo, story line in Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme (1988) #5.[2]\n\nthe Black Panther, story line in Black Panther (1988) #3.[2]\n\nCynthia von Doom, Mephisto helped Cynthia get revenge against her oppressors.[3]\n\nDeath Note manga by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata; Light Yagami makes a pact with a Shinigami.[4]\n\nDemon Candy: Parallel, an original English-language manga by Lord Dragon Master, Jonathan is tricked into selling his soul for a Klondike bar.[5][6]\n\nDoctor Strange, story line in Doctor Strange: Damnation.[3]\n\nthe Ghost Rider, story line beginning in Marvel Spotlight (1971) #5.[2]\n\nJohn Constantine, Hellblazer story line Dangerous Habits: John Constantine cons the Lords of Hell into curing his lung cancer.[7]\n\nKuroshitsuji or Black Butler, manga by Yana Toboso[8]\n\nLoki, story line in Siege: Loki (2010) #1.[2]\n\nMagik, her son was born in between multiple dimensions; to keep him safe, Magik made a deal with Mephisto.[3]\n\nMagma, storyline in New Mutants (vol. 3) #30.[3]\n\nthe Scarlet Witch, Wanda once used Mephisto's soul to create two children for herself.[3]\n\nthe Silver Surfer, Mephisto tempts the Surfer with his heart's greatest desires.[3]\n\nSpider-Man, story line in One More Day, The Amazing Spider-Man (1999) #544.[2]\n\nSusan Storm, story line in Give the Devil His Due.[3]\n\nTeam Fortress 2[broken anchor], The Naked and the Dead[9]\n\nX-23, the Red Hulk, the Ghost Rider and Venom, story line in Venom (2011) #13.[2]\n\nNovels and short stories\n\nBearskin, fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, in which a man gains a fortune and a bride by entering into a pact with the devil.[10]\n\nThe Bet, by Anton Chekhov[11]\n\nThe Black Spider (Die Schwarze Spinne; 1842), novella by Jeremias Gotthelf, (1842)[12]\n\nThe Bottle Imp, by Robert Louis Stevenson, (1891)[11]\n\nThe Demon Pope (1888), Madam Lucifer, short stories at Wikisource by Richard Garnett[1]\n\nThe Devil and Daniel Webster, short story based on the Washington Irving story; by Stephen Vincent Benét[13]\n\nThe Devil and Tom Walker by Washington Irving, (1824)[14]\n\nThe Devil's Elixir, novel by E.
