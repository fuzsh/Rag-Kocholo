        "text": "This is a very mediocre movie, and a bad sign-off for Alan J. Pakula (who died a year later in 1998 from a car crash). Listen to Brad Pitt's awful accent for a few moments and you'll get a clear idea that this film is going nowhere.\n\nIt caused some controversy on release because of its simplified view of the IRA/Britain terrorism and some people (particularly Europeans I suppose) took offense to the fact that Brad Pitt's character is given a \"motive\" for what he does... and the film seems to sympathy with him.\n\nBrad Pitt hated the film and Harrison Ford and him battled on set over who would become the focus of the film itself (apparently Pitt became upset because the script was re-written and his character was given less screen time).\n\nI only recommend it to people who haven't seen many movies. Why? Because then the recycled dialogue, characters, plot, and performances may seem fresh.\n\nBut as it stands, \"The Devil's Own\" is a poor example of mediocre film-making. Or is that a \"good\" example of mediocre film-making? Whatever it is, the film is not anything special, and certainly not anything that hasn't been done before.\n\nI love movies from this timeperiod. They carry a vibe that's gone in modern day movies. Different camera action, less pace (even action movies) and a different psychology of the characters. TDO is not the best movie of it's genre, but Ford and Pitt bring a lot of weight to it. Pitt is charming as always, but is also convincing portraying a ruthless IRA commander. A decent script, lovely irish accents and convincing motives for the characters make this a nice movie for a sunday afternoon.\n\nThe latest IRA operation has been a failure and they suspect a setup. Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt) is an IRA gunman who barely escaped from the battle, and is sent to America with an alternate identity Rory Devaney. Frankie is housed with NY cop Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford) and his family (Margaret Colin, Julia Stiles...) who don't know Frankie's true identity. The two men slowly develops a friendship until Tom starts to suspect something's wrong with the newcomer.\n\nThe movie attempts to be a profound examination of loyalties in the Irish conflict. It just does it poorly despite the best efforts of the two leading men. The movie is well known for its troubled production and there's a chance that I've been influenced by it. After an exciting shoot-em-up battle in Northern Ireland, the story rambles on and on as we wait for something dramatic to happen. The dialog is lifeless and bland. The tension fades away until I don't really care about the characters even when something actually starts to happen."
