        "text": "Mandalay Entertainment Between “The Lost City” and “Bullet Train”–and the upcoming release of “Babylon”–it’s been a Brad Pitt summer and fall. What’s most surprising is that Pitt is still acting at all. In 2011, he told Australia’s “60 Minutes” that he planned to give up on starring in movies by the age of 50. Now 58, he’s still going strong–and it’s not because he needs the money. The path to global stardom wasn’t exactly clear cut for Pitt, who grew up in Shawnee, Oklahoma. An athletic student with a broad spectrum of interests and hobbies, he enrolled at the University of Missouri and majored in journalism. It was upon graduating that he realized his passion for film was too powerful to ignore. That brought him to Los Angeles, where he attended acting workshops, took odd jobs, landed uncredited roles in various movies, and appeared on TV shows like “Dallas” and “21 Jump Street.” Famously, Pitt’s big break came when he snagged the role of a grifter named J.D. in 1991’s “Thelma & Louise.” As subsequent offers came pouring in, the actor ascended to A-list status in just a few years’ time. Reluctant to play the straight-laced man or romantic lead, he opted instead for a variety of interesting and challenging roles. He generated a diverse repertoire, which comes filled to the brim with eccentric characters and heroic ones alike. Equally diverse is his evolving reputation, which swings from pot-loving heartbreaker to global humanitarian. As his career progressed, Pitt shifted toward production while continuing to star in several films. In 2001, he co-founded Plan B Entertainment, taking sole ownership four years later. Wildly successful in its own right, Plan B has produced a range of films, from crowd-pleasers like “Eat, Pray, Love” to such blockbusters as “World War Z” to Oscar winners like “12 Years a Slave” and “Moonlight.” Add to that Pitt’s various charitable causes and high-profile relationships, and it’s safe to say the man keeps busy on both sides of the camera. Despite his many achievements in various fields, Pitt remains best known as an accomplished actor. For that reason, Stacker ranked his movies from worst to best. For the list, Stacker compiled the definitive ranking of the 51 films featuring Pitt using an index of IMDb ratings and Rotten Tomatoes’ Tomatometer. Cameos, uncredited roles, and production credits without acting roles were not considered. Here are Pitt’s best (and worst) movies. You may also like: Best Clint Eastwood movies #51. Cool World (1992) Bakshi Animation – Stacker score: 26 – IMDb rating: 4.8 – Tomatometer: 4 From “Fritz the Cat” creator Ralph Bakshi comes this noirish blend of animation and live-action, which ultimately feels like a low-rent follow-up to “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” Pitt plays the role of Frank Harris, the only human in an otherwise cartoon world. Despite tanking at the box office, this was among the first films to actualize Pitt’s potential as a leading Hollywood man. #50. Cutting Class (1989) April Films – Stacker score: 29.5 – IMDb rating: 4.5 – Tomatometer: 14 Pitt made his big-screen debut in this campy slasher flick, which centers on a high school girl and her two suitors. One suitor is a homicidal maniac; the other is Pitt. Decisions, decisions. #49. The Favor (1994) Nelson Entertainment – Stacker score: 39.5 – IMDb rating: 5.2 – Tomatometer: 27 Filmed in 1990 and then released four years later, this romantic comedy stars Pitt in a supporting role. At the heart of the story is a married woman named Kathy (Harley Jane Kozak) who wonders what it would be like to sleep with another man (Ken Wahl). When she asks her friend Emily (Elizabeth McGovern) to do the deed on her behalf, it kicks off a string of disastrous events. #48. Johnny Suede (1991) Arena – Stacker score: 42.5 – IMDb rating: 5.8 – Tomatometer: 27 Arriving just months after “Thelma & Louise,” this indie comedy centers on an aspiring musician named Johnny Suede. Director Tom DiCillo insisted on casting a then-unknown Pitt in the lead role, later describing the actor’s performance as some of his “best work.” Miramax purchased the film in 1990 and released it the following year, hoping to “capitalize on Pitt’s ascending stardom.” #47. By the Sea (2015) Universal Pictures – Stacker score: 44 – IMDb rating: 5.3 – Tomatometer: 35 The only film to star both Pitt and Angelina Jolie when they were married is also one of the worst efforts of their respective careers. Jolie wrote and directed the movie (under Angelina Jolie Pitt), hoping it would help improve their waning relationship. Fittingly, it tells the story of a couple trying to save their marriage while staying in France. You may also like: Most widely watched but universally hated movies of all time #46. The Counsellor (2013) Fox 2000 Pictures – Stacker score: 44 – IMDb rating: 5.4 – Tomatometer: 34 Expectations were high for this disappointing crime drama, which put a slate of A-list talent both in front of and behind the camera. Starring alongside Cameron Diaz, Michael Fassbender, Penélope Cruz, and Javier Bardem, Pitt plays a shady middleman named Westray. A critical and commercial flop, the movie features one heck of a death sequence toward the end. #45. The Devil’s Own (1997) Columbia Pictures – Stacker score: 48.5 – IMDb rating: 6.2 – Tomatometer: 35 Back when adult crime dramas were a bankable genre, Pitt starred in this one as an IRA terrorist named Frankie McGuire. Upon being sent to the U.S. to buy weapons, McGuire adopts an alias and stays under the roof of NYPD sergeant Tom O’Meara (Harrison Ford). It paves the way for an unlikely friendship, which gets put to the test when Frankie’s true identity is revealed. #44. Happy Feet Two (2011) Warner Bros. – Stacker score: 51.5 – IMDb rating: 5.8 – Tomatometer: 45 Pitt lent his voice to the character Will the Krill for this computer-animated sequel, which drastically underperformed at the box office. Determined to scrap his way out from the bottom of the food chain, Will attempts to become an apex predator. The move sparks hostility between Will and his best friend, Bill, voiced by Matt Damon. #43. War Machine (2017) Netflix – Stacker score: 53.5 – IMDb rating: 6 – Tomatometer: 47 On the heels of movies like “Beasts of No Nation,” Netflix continued to strive for reputable fare with this somewhat middling satire. Pitt stars as General Glen McMahon, who is sent to “clean up” the mess in Afghanistan. Spoiler alert: He doesn’t succeed. #42. The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) Avala Film – Stacker score: 54 – IMDb rating: 5.4 – Tomatometer: not available Pitt was completely unknown when he scored his first starring role in this Yugoslavian drama, playing a man with a rare skin disease. Tensions were high during the on-location shoot, as former Yugoslavia teetered closer to a decadelong civil war. The movie was shelved upon completion and then released straight to video in 1997.

Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003) Dreamworks Pictures – Stacker score: 56 – IMDb rating: 6.7 – Tomatometer: 45 Most animated fare is a recipe for box office success, but not this forgotten bomb from 2003. Pitt provides the voice of the mythic sailor Sinbad, who travels to the end of the world in search of a stolen book. Critics were more or less uniformly impressed with the animation but otherwise divided on the script. #40. Across the Tracks (1990) Tung Films – Stacker score: 57 – IMDb rating: 5.7 – Tomatometer: not available Pitt stars opposite former child actor Ricky Schroder in this high school sports drama about two teenage brothers named Joe and Billy. As Joe (Pitt) competes on the track team and pursues a college scholarship, Billy (Schroder) grapples with a life of crime and substance abuse. When it turns out that Billy is a talented runner in his own right, an athletic rivalry develops. #39. The Mexican (2001) Dreamworks Pictures – Stacker score: 57.5 – IMDb rating: 6.1 – Tomatometer: 54 Pitt was at the height of his star power when he headlined this adventure comedy alongside fellow A-lister Julia Roberts. Despite its potential as a rollicking road movie, the film’s poor plotting and drawn-out pacing turned off numerous fans and critics. Pitt and Roberts also co-starred in “Ocean’s Eleven,” released later that same year. #38. Meet Joe Black (1998) Universal Pictures – Stacker score: 58 – IMDb rating: 7.2 – Tomatometer: 44 His name is Joe Black, but he’s also known as Death in this 1998 fantasy drama, which stars Pitt in the title role. While learning about life on Earth with help from a media mogul (Anthony Hopkins), Black falls in love with the mogul’s daughter (Claire Forlani). The movie was more or less forgotten until its most ridiculous scene went viral in 2019. #37. Happy Together (1989) Apollo Productions – Stacker score: 59 – IMDb rating: 5.9 – Tomatometer: not available Because of a computer glitch, an ambitious male freshman (Patrick Dempsey) ends up with a party-loving female (Helen Slater) for a roommate. So goes this indie comedy from 1989, which stars Pitt in the bit role of Brian. It opened in 10 theaters nationwide and made just under $71,000 at the domestic box office. You may also like: Biggest box office bombs of all time #36. Ocean’s Twelve (2004) Warner Bros. – Stacker score: 60 – IMDb rating: 6.5 – Tomatometer: 55 Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang of charming thieves reunite in this lucrative sequel. Like both its predecessor and successor, the movie stars a veritable bounty of A-list talent. Pitt reprises the role of Rusty Ryan, Ocean’s coy right-hand man who oversees day-to-day operations. #35. Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) New Regency Productions – Stacker score: 62 – IMDb rating: 6.5 – Tomatometer: 59 It might have sparked one of the most dramatic love affairs in tabloid history, but this smash hit keeps a light tone from start to finish. Beneath the veneer of their mundane marriage, a husband (Pitt) and wife (Angelina Jolie) lead double lives as secret assassins. When they’re assigned to kill one another, it provides the perfect jolt to their ailing relationship. #34. Kalifornia (1993) PolyGram Filmed Entertainment – Stacker score: 62.5 – IMDb rating: 6.7 – Tomatometer: 58 Pitt was ascending the Hollywood ranks when he took a minor detour, starring in this quirky crime drama. It follows a journalist (David Duchovny) and his girlfriend on a road trip across America, as part of a research project involving famous serial killers. Joining them for the ride are Early Grayce (Pitt) and Adele Corners (Juliette Lewis), who have firsthand knowledge of the subject. #33. Bullet Train (2022) 87North – Stacker score: 63 – IMDb rating: 7.3 – Tomatometer: 53 “Bullet Train” fit nicely into 2022’s stable of summer blockbusters. The film features Pitt portraying an assassin called Ladybug who has a series of run-ins with fellow assassins while riding aboard a fictionalized version of the Japanese high-speed rail Tokaido Shinkansen. #32. Troy (2004) Warner Bros. – Stacker score: 63 – IMDb rating: 7.3 – Tomatometer: 53 Before adapting “Game of Thrones” for HBO, writer David Benioff penned the script for this historical epic. Taking cues from Homer’s “Iliad,” it depicts an abridged version of the Trojan War. Pitt stars as Achilles, the fearless warrior whose fatal weakness remains the stuff of legend. You may also like: Sequels that outperformed the original at the box office #31. Seven Years in Tibet (1997) Mandalay Entertainment – Stacker score: 65.5 – IMDb rating: 7.1 – Tomatometer: 60 This 1997 drama tells the true story of Austrian climber Heinrich Harrer (played here by Pitt), who visits Tibet and befriends the Dalai Lama amid a backdrop of political unrest. Because of his role in the film, Pitt was banned from entering China for a number of years. On Empire’s list of the Top Ten Worst Movie accents, his Austrian accent landed at #3. #30. Allied (2016) Paramount Pictures – Stacker score: 65.5 – IMDb rating: 7.1 – Tomatometer: 60 A rumored affair between Pitt and co-star Marion Cotillard wasn’t enough to drum up interest in this British American war thriller, which tanked at the domestic box office. Set at the height of World War II, it centers the romance between a Canadian intelligence officer (Pitt) and a French resistance fighter (Cotillard). Critic Peter Sobczynski gave the film a four-star review on Roger Ebert, citing it as an “entertaining stab at old-fashioned storytelling.” #29. Legends of the Fall (1994) TriStar Pictures – Stacker score: 66 – IMDb rating: 7.5 – Tomatometer: 57 Pitt secured his A-list status by headlining this sweeping drama, which takes place in early 20th-century Montana. When two brothers (Pitt and Aidan Quinn) fall in love with the same woman (Julia Ormond), it threatens to tear an entire family apart. Reflecting upon the film in 2014, Ormond described Pitt as a dedicated character actor who was reluctant to become the next Hollywood heartthrob. #28. Spy Game (2001) Universal Pictures – Stacker score: 67.5 – IMDb rating: 7 – Tomatometer: 65 Filmed in Tony Scott’s signature kinetic style, this 2001 thriller stars Pitt as superspy Tom Bishop. After being arrested in China on espionage charges, Bishop’s former mentor (Robert Redford) concocts a plan to spring him free. Interspersed throughout are flashback sequences, chronicling the turbulent relationship between the two men. #27. Killing Them Softly (2012) Plan B Entertainment – Stacker score: 68 – IMDb rating: 6.2 – Tomatometer: 74 Adult crime dramas were definitely not a bankable genre by 2012, as this retro-flavored box office turkey goes to show. It stars Pitt as the mob enforcer Jackie Cogan, who’s hired to track down and kill three amateur stick-up artists. This marked the third time Pitt shared a billing with actor James Gandolfini, Pitt’s former co-star in both 1993’s “True Romance” and 2001’s “The Mexican.” You may also like: 50 times actors hated their own movies #26. World War Z (2013) Paramount Pictures – Stacker score: 68 – IMDb rating: 7 – Tomatometer: 66 Adapted from the bestselling novel, this action-horror movie follows a man (Pitt) and his family through the zombie apocalypse. In the wake of a famously troubled production, the film earned Pitt his highest returns at the domestic box office (not counting cameos). He and director David Fincher were attached to a long-awaited sequel, reportedly shut down due to budget issues. #25. Ocean’s Thirteen (2007) Warner Bros. – Stacker score: 69.5 – IMDb rating: 6.9 – Tomatometer: 70 Marking a conscious return to form, the third installment of the “Ocean’s Eleven” franchise pits Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his crew against casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino). As always, it was a convivial affair both on and offscreen for all those involved. In an interview, Pitt and Clooney confirmed that director Steven Soderbergh jokingly referred to this film as “Ocean’s Thirteen: The One We Should Have Made Last Time.” #24.
