        "text": "Every actorâyes, even the most famous and award-winning of themâhas a turkey in his or her closet. Whether the thespian wants to admit it or not is another story: While Ben Kingsley has kept mum on his reasons for playing the flatulence-prone sex guru Tugginmypudha in 2008's rightfully maligned The Love Guru, Warren Beatty has repeatedly gone on the record to defend his legendary 1987 bomb, Ishtar. In 1991, Beatty told Entertainment Weekly that âIshtar is a very good, not very big, comedy, made by a brilliant woman. And I think it's funny.â\n\nBut badmouthing oneâs own not-so-stellar oeuvre has become a popular pastime in Hollywood as of late. Here are 15 actors who werenât afraid to spray a little venom at the films theyâd like to erase from their resumes.\n\n1. BRAD PITT // THE DEVIL'S OWN (1997)\n\nIn February of 1997, eight weeks before The Devil's Own premiered, Brad Pitt shared his disappointment about Alan Pakulaâs IRA thriller with Newsweek. âWe had no script,â Pitt said. âWell, we had a great script but it got tossed for various reasons. To have to make something up as you go alongâJesus, what pressure! It was ridiculous. It was the most irresponsible bit of filmmakingâif you can even call it thatâthat I've ever seen.â (Has he not seen Cool World?)\n\n2. GEORGE CLOONEY // RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES! (1988)\n\nGeorge Clooneyâs likability factor seems to improve with age. And his occasional jabs at his own moviesâmost notably Joel Schumacherâs Batman & Robinâonly add to his Everyman persona. But his turn as the Caped Crusader has got nothing on his role in this late-â80s camp-fest! At Newsweekâs 2012 Oscar roundtable, Clooney talked about the dangers of acting for money: âAs an actor all bets are off if you need money,â he declared. âI've done really [crappy] movies or [crappy] jobs when I was broke, and people go, âWhy did you do Return of the Killer Tomatoes?â Because I got the job!â\n\n3. JULIA ROBERTS // I LOVE TROUBLE (1994)\n\nJulia Roberts did not earn her âAmericaâs Sweetheartâ moniker by being difficult. But Nick Nolte wouldnât know that. The two actors fell way short of Hepburn/Tracy expectations when they teamed up for I Love Trouble, Charles Shyer's tribute to the fast-talking rom-com. It wasnât long before the press got wind of the dueling actorsâ on-set antics. While her PR team tried to do damage control, Roberts couldnât keep herself from making some thinly masked digs at her co-star. In a 1993 interview, she told The New York Times, âFrom the moment I met him we sort of gave each other a hard time and naturally we get on each other's nerves. [While he can be] completely charming and very nice, he's also completely disgusting. He's going to hate me for saying this, but he seems go out of his way to repel people. He's a kick.â The film, unsurprisingly, repelled audiences and critics alike.\n\n4. ALEC GUINNESS // STAR WARS (1977)\n\nBy the time he played Obi-Wan Kenobi in 1977âs Star Wars: A New Hope, Alec Guinness had already appeared in cinematic classics like The Bridge on the River Kwai, Great Expectations, and Lawrence of Arabia. During production, Guinness is reported to have declared that, \"Apart from the money, I regret having embarked on the film. I like them well enough, but it's not an acting job, the dialogueâwhich is lamentableâkeeps being changed and only slightly improved, and I find myself old and out of touch with the young.\" The insane amount of fame he won for the role as the wise old Jedi master took him somewhat by surprise and, ultimately, annoyed him.\n\nIn his autobiography, A Positively Final Appearance: A Journal, Guinness recalled a time he encountered an autograph-seeking fan who boasted to him about having watched Star Wars more than 100 times. In response, Guinness agreed to provide the boy with an autograph on the condition that he promise never to watch the film again.\n\n5. SYLVESTER STALLONE // STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT (1992)\n\nSylvester Stallone doesnât pull any punches when it comes to his film career. Despite co-starring with the delightful Estelle Getty as the titular violence-prone mother, Stallone knows just how bad the film was: \"I made some truly awful movies. Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot was the worst,\" Stallone said. \"If you ever want someone to confess to murder, just make him or her sit through that film. They will confess to anything after 15 minutes.\"\n\n6. HALLE BERRY // CATWOMAN (2004)\n\nThree years after winning an Oscar for the indie hit Monsterâs Ball, Halle Berry donned the famous catsuit to star in this well-known bomb. And she played the role of good sport months later when she actually showed up to collect her Razzie Award for Worst Actress for the film, wherein she told the crowd: âYou know, Iâve got so many people to thank, because you donât win a Razzie without a lot of help from a lot of people ... First of all, I want to thank Warner Bros. Thank you for putting me in a piece of sh*t, god-awful movie. You know, it was just what my career needed, you know? I was at the top, and then Catwoman just plummeted me to the bottom.â No one involvedânot Berryâs manager, agent, lawyers, acting coach, nor the filmâs writers, cast, and directorâescaped her wrath.\n\n7. MICHAEL CAINE // JAWS: THE REVENGE (1987)\n\nMaybe itâs the English accent, but few people pan their own films as entertainingly as Michael Caine. And while the two-time Oscar winner has seen his career resurrected in recent years, thanks in large part to Christopher Nolan, the decades havenât always been so kind to Sir Michael. The 1980s were a particularly odd time, as they saw Caine regularly transitioning from fantastic roles to atrocious ones. Case in point: In 1986 Caine was too busy shooting the fourth film in the Jaws franchise to accept his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Woody Allenâs Hannah and Her Sisters. In his 1992 autobiography, Whatâs It All About, Caine wrote of Jaws: The Revenge: âI have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.â\n\n8. CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER // THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965)\n\nThe film that made Christopher Plummer a household name is the one heâd like to pretend doesnât exist. At different times he has referred to The Sound of Music as âThe Sound of Mucus,â âS&Mâ or simply âthat movie.â In 2010, he told The Boston Globe: âI was a bit bored with the character. Although we worked hard enough to make him interesting, it was a bit like flogging a dead horse. And the subject matter is not mine. I mean it canât appeal to every person in the world. Itâs not my cup of tea.\"\n\n9. GWYNETH PALTROW // VIEW FROM THE TOP (2003)\n\nShe may get a lot of flak for her lifestyle blog, Goop, but when it comes to picking the right roles, Gwyneth Paltrow has made very few missteps. The two exceptions, according to the Oscar-winning actress, are Shallow Hal and this flight attendant comedy. Calling it âshiteâ in a 2006 interview with The Guardian, Paltrow described the movie as \"terrible.â\n\n10. BOB HOSKINS // SUPER MARIO BROS. (1993)\n\nFor anyone who doesnât understand the cultural differences between Hollywood actors and British ones, behold Bob Hoskins. Whenever the topic turned to Super Mario Bros., the Oscar nomineeâwho passed away in 2014ânever made an attempt to hide his ire. In 2007, The Guardian quoted him as saying, âThe worst thing I ever did? Super Mario Bros. It was a [freaking] nightmare. The whole experience was a nightmare. It had a husband-and-wife team directing, whose arrogance had been mistaken for talent. After so many weeks their own agent told them to get off the set!â\n\nOne year later, Hoskinsâs Super Mario Bros. co-starâtwo-time Oscar nominee Dennis Hopperâgot in on the bashing action. When asked about his biggest disappointment while appearing on Late Night With Conan OâBrien, Hopper replied that âI made a picture called Super Mario Bros., and my 6-year-old son at the timeâhe's now 18âsaid, âDad I think you're probably a pretty good actor, but why did you play that terrible guy King Koopa in Super Mario Bros.?â And I said, 'Well Henry, I did that so you could have shoes.' And he said, 'Dad, I don't need shoes that badly.ââ\n\n11. GARY OLDMAN // TIPTOES (2003)\n\nWhatâs that? Youâve never heard of Tiptoes? The 2003 straight-to-DVD flick isn't exactly the gift to movie buffs that one might expect, given the star-studded cast. Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey star as brothers, one of them normal-sized (McConaughey) and one of them a little person (Oldman). Oldman played the role on his knees in order to achieve the height disparity; in the years since its release, few of the actors have ever spoken publicly about it (including Oldman), and with good reason. But in March 2012, The New York Times managed to get a few words from Tiptoes co-star Peter Dinklage. âOh, that movie,â he said, shaking his head. âThat was something â¦ It was sort of an amazing idea for a movie, but the result was what we were fighting againstâthe cutesiness of little people.â\n\n12. CHARLIZE THERON // REINDEER GAMES (2000)\n\nThe 2000 action film Reindeer Games starred Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise, and Charlize Theron and was directed by John Frankenheimer, which sounds like the makings of a decent project. But it all somehow failed to come together. In the end the film lost a lot of money and compiled a wealth of negative reviewsâincluding one from its lead actress who simply stated, âReindeer Games was not a good movie.â\n\n13. MARK WAHLBERG // THE HAPPENING (2008)\n\nMark Wahlberg doesnât exactly seem like a guy who lives his life afraid of trees. But that is the odd position M. Night Shyamalanâs 2008 film The Happening put him in. Wahlberg, as it turns out, doesnât look back too fondly on the film. He went on record during a press conference for The Fighter when he described a conversation with a fellow actor:\n\n\"We had actually had the luxury of having lunch before to talk about another movie and it was a bad movie that I did. She dodged the bullet. And then I was still able to â¦ I donât want to tell you what movie â¦ alright The Happening.â F*** it. It is what it is. F***ing trees, man. The plants. F*** it. You canât blame me for not wanting to try to play a science teacher. At least I wasnât playing a cop or a crook.\"\n\n14. MICKEY ROURKE // PASSION PLAY (2010)\n\nTruth be told, itâs probably not all that surprising that Mickey Rourke has done his fair share of badmouthing his own movies. After all, this is the man who gave up his career as a Hollywood hunk to get his face beaten in for a living. But in 2011, Rourke opened up to New York Magazine about his many failed cinematic efforts. When asked about Passion Play, the movie he had recently wrapped with Megan Fox and Bill Murray, Rourke noted that it was âTerrible. Another terrible movie. But, you know, in your career and all the movies you make, youâre going to make dozens of terrible ones.â Fair enough!\n\n15. DAVID CROSS // ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: CHIPWRECKED (2011)\n\nWhen actors have a movie out, it's customary that they publicize the film by saying nice things about it. In 2012, David Cross took a different approach. When it came to describing Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, the veteran comedian and actor went on Conan and called the film a âbig commercial for Carnival Cruise Linesâ and urged people not to go see it.\n\nThis article was originally published in 2018 and has been updated."
