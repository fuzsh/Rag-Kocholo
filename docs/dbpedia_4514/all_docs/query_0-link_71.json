        "text": "CANADIAN FRONT, 2008 Denys Arcand’s satire “Days of Darkness,” set in the very near future, takes place largely in the mind of Jean-Marc Leblanc (Marc Labrèche, above, in a scene from the film), a middle-aged civil servant who works in the provincial citizens rights department listening to the complaints of ordinary people whose problems he is powerless to solve. As his mind wanders, this harried milquetoast entertains grandiose Walter Mitty-worthy fantasies of fame, wealth and sex with beautiful women jockeying for his favor.\n\nOne reason this concluding chapter of Mr. Arcand’s Quebec Trilogy, which began with “The Decline of the American Empire” and continued with “The Barbarian Invasions,” isn’t as strong as its forerunners is the speed with which satire catches up with reality. But the movie takes some amusingly nasty swipes at political correctness, as when Jean-Marc is brought before a committee and reprimanded after being overheard using the word Negro.\n\n“Days of Darkness” is the centerpiece of the Museum of Modern Art’s annual Canadian Front series, an eight-film survey of recent Canadian movies having their New York premieres at the Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters. The highlight of last year’s series was “Away From Her,” which won Julie Christie an Academy Award nomination.\n\nOther worthy entries this year include “Poor Boy’s Game,” a boxing drama starring Danny Glover set in working-class Halifax, Nova Scotia, and “The Tracey Fragments,” based on a novel by Maureen Medved, which stars Ellen Page as a troubled adolescent girl.\n\nIn the breezy comedy “Breakfast With Scot,” the life of a gay former hockey star turned sportscaster living a semi-closeted life with his partner is upended when his lover’s 11-year-old nephew comes to live with them after the death of his mother. The effeminate child, who arrives arrayed in his mother’s jewels and scarves, forces the sportscaster to confront his own lingering discomfort with his sexual identity. (Through Thursday, Museum of Modern Art, 212-708-9400, moma.org; $10; $8 for 65+.) STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nTHOROLD DICKINSON’S WORLD OF CINEMA Here’s a fine opportunity to go spelunking in the perennially underestimated British cinema. The director Thorold Dickinson (1903-84) made only a handful of features and shorts during his career, which concluded with a long stint (at the Slade School of Fine Art in London) as Britain’s first officially appointed professor of film. He remains best known for two rip-roaring thrillers he considered commercial quickies: the tense and claustrophobic 1940 version of Patrick Hamilton’s stage play “Gaslight” and the genuinely creepy ghost story “The Queen of Spades” (1949).\n\nBoth films will be shown in a weeklong retrospective of Dickinson’s work that begins on Wednesday under the auspices of the Film Society of Lincoln Center. Both happen to star the Austrian actor Anton Walbrook (“The Red Shoes”) as a schemer who seduces a naïve young woman in his drive to realize uncontrollable obsessions: the possession of a set of rubies in “Gaslight” (Wednesday and March 23, also starring Diana Wynyard, above) and of the Devil’s own method of winning at cards in “Spades” (March 21 and March 22).\n\nBut the series will also give us a chance to see the more politically engaged films that Dickinson himself preferred, including the 1946 Technicolor colonial drama “Men of Two Worlds” (March 24 and March 25) and the 1952 film “The Secret People” (Wednesday and March 22), which features Valentina Cortese and Audrey Hepburn (her last film before “Roman Holiday” made her a star) as sisters who are drawn into a shady plot to avenge the death of their father, a slain anti-fascist leader. (Through March 25, Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, 212-875-5600, filmlinc.org; $10.) DAVE KEHR\n\nRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n‘ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS’ (PG, 1:32) Adults who remember this musical cartoon franchise created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. in 1958 may derive fleeting amusement from this update, which concerns the efforts of the title characters’ surrogate dad, Dave Seville (Jason Lee), to rescue them from the clutches of a perfidious record executive (a delightfully despicable, movie-stealing David Cross). Kids may find less to connect with: The digitally animated heroes are eclipsed by their adult, live-action co-stars, a fatal mistake. Rent the DVD, or watch it with your children on a plane flight. (Andy Webster)\n\n‘ATONEMENT’ (R, 2:03) Gorgeous and inert, this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel suggests that some books are best left alone. (A. O. Scott)\n\n★ ‘THE BAND’S VISIT’ (PG-13, 1:29, in Arabic, English and Hebrew) The Israeli writer and director Eran Kolirin wrenches comedy out of intense melancholia in his beautifully played story about eight Egyptian musicians stranded in the Israeli desert. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n‘THE BANK JOB’ (R, 1:50) A wham-bam caper flick, efficiently directed by Roger Donaldson, that fancifully revisits the mysterious whos and speculative hows of a 1971 London bank heist. With Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows. (Dargis)\n\n‘BE KIND REWIND’ (PG-13, 1:41) Michel Gondry’s sweet and lackadaisical new film pays tribute to movie love, not as a grand aesthetic passion but rather as an antidote for boredom. Jack Black and Mos Def are a pair of loafers who recreate well-known films (e.g., “Ghostbusters” and “Driving Miss Daisy”) on videotape. Their art, like Mr. Gondry’s, is both silly and inspiring. (Scott)\n\n‘BEAUFORT’ (No rating, 2:05, in Hebrew) Joseph Cedar’s tense drama takes place at a fortress in Lebanon captured by Israel in the 1980s. The last group of Israeli soldiers is preparing to withdraw, under attack from Hezbollah and with decided ambivalence. The movie’s earnest sobriety helps it through passages of tedium and occasional bouts of combat-picture cliché. (A. O. Scott)\n\n★ ‘BLINDSIGHT’ (PG, 1:44, in Tibetan) Filmed primarily in and around the cascading Tibetan Himalayas, Lucy Walker’s astonishing documentary follows six blind Tibetan teenagers as they attempt to scale the 23,000-foot Lhakpa Ri peak on the north side of Mount Everest. The film is at its strongest and most complex when humanitarian and competitive goals collide, and the raw beauty of the surroundings dwarfs every human ambition. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\n\n‘CARAMEL’ (PG, 1:36, in Arabic and French) Set in a Beirut beauty salon, Nicole Labaki’s debut feature presents a charming, if somewhat familiar, tableau of female friendship and mild melodrama. (Scott)\n\n‘CHARLIE BARTLETT’ (R, 1:37) If the attention span of “Charlie Bartlett” didn’t wander here and there, the movie might have been a high school satire worthy of comparing to “Election.” But as it dashes around and eventually turns soft, it loses its train of thought. (Stephen Holden)\n\n‘CHICAGO 10’ (R, 1:43) The ’68 Democratic convention and its aftermath, rendered with archival clips and also with animated re-enactments of the trial of a number of activists. More mythology than history, this hybrid, directed by Brett Morgen, squanders its ingenuity on a glib, uninformative rehash of Yippie attitudes. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘CHOP SHOP’ (No rating, 1:25) Rahmin Barhani, the director and co-writer of this modest, neo-realist gem, stays close to the ground in the Willets Point section of Queens. In following the lives of a brother and a sister scratching out a future amid grim circumstances, he celebrates their resilience without condescension, sentimentality or false hope. (Scott)\n\n‘CITY OF MEN’ (R, 1:51, in Portuguese) The companion piece (not strictly a sequel) to “City of God,” the Brazilian hit about youth gangs in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, is a warmer-hearted melodrama built around the friendship of two 18-year-old boys from the favelas, both brought up without fathers, making their way into manhood. (Holden)\n\n★ ‘CJ7’ (PG, 1:26, in Cantonese) A devilishly entertaining curveball, “CJ7” is “E.T.” as reimagined by the premier clown of Chinese cinema, Stephen Chow. Here he plays an impoverished widower whose young son (the 9-year-old actress Xu Jiao) befriends a tiny alien with magical powers. Ceding the limelight to his young co-star  who dances in it like a pro  Mr. Chow devotes his considerable creative energy to unexpected scenes that showcase his bizarre sense of humor. The violence is as exaggerated as vintage Hanna-Barbera, but the film’s gentleness of spirit and frequent flights of fancy ensure that no child will be left behind. (Catsoulis)\n\n‘CLOVERFIELD’ (PG-13, 1:24) OMG! It’s, like, totally the end of the world!! (Dargis)\n\n‘COLLEGE ROAD TRIP’ (G, 1:23) Eyes popping and mouths agape, Martin Lawrence and Raven-Symoné mug their way through “College Road Trip” as a disturbingly doting father and his fed-up daughter en route to her college interview. As Dad crashes a wedding and storms a sorority house, you’ll be thankful that the movie’s target audience is too young to have heard of Freud. (Catsoulis)\n\n‘THE COUNTERFEITERS’ (R, 1:38, in German) Stefan Rudowitsky’s film, winner of this year’s Oscar for best foreign-language film, is based on the true story of concentration camp inmates involved in a Nazi scheme to counterfeit Allied currencies. Karl Markovics gives a ferociously concentrated performance as Salomon Sorowisch, a man who brings his underworld code of ethics and his professional pride from Berlin to the Sachsenhausen camp. (Scott)\n\n* ‘DEFINITELY, MAYBE’ (PG-13, 1:52) This unusually smart, thoroughly charming romantic comedy follows a nice guy’s involvement with three women, one of whom he will marry. Isla Fisher, Rachel Weisz and Elizabeth Banks are all wonderful as the candidates, as is Ryan Reynolds as the guy. (Scott)\n\n‘THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY’ (PG-13, 1:52, in French) Julian Schnabel’s film, about Jean-Dominique Bauby, a French magazine editor paralyzed by a stroke, is a marvel of empathy and imagination. It is also a celebration of French sensualism and an examination of the nature of consciousness. (Scott)\n\n* ‘THE DUCHESS OF LANGEAIS’ (No rating, 2:17, in French) Based on Balzac’s 1834 short novel and set against the French Restoration, Jacques Rivette’s nearly impeccable interpretation traces how a passionate affair of the heart (Jeanne Balibar and Guillaume Depardieu play the lovers) curdles into cruelty and obsession. (Dargis)\n\n‘THE EYE’ (PG-13, 1:37) Yet another Western deconstruction of a successful Asian horror movie, this one features a vapid Jessica Alba as a blind violinist whose cornea transplant yields the ability to see dead people. But while the original was an insinuating ghost story that cleverly exploited cinema’s fascination with all things ocular, this louder and more literal remake only highlights the debt owed by both to “The Sixth Sense.” (Catsoulis)\n\n‘FOOL’S GOLD’ (PG-13, 1:52) Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey go swimming. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS’ (No rating, 1:53, in Romanian) In this ferocious, unsentimental film from the Romanian writer and director Cristian Mungiu, the camera doesn’t follow the action, it expresses consciousness itself. This consciousness  alert to the world and insistently alive  is embodied by a young university student who in the late 1980s helps her roommate with an illegal abortion in Ceausescu’s Romania. It’s a pitiless, violent story that in its telling becomes a haunting and haunted intellectual and aesthetic achievement. (Dargis)\n\n★ ‘FROWNLAND’ (No rating, 1:46) An up-close, painfully intimate portrait of a hapless, manipulative schlub  inhabited with every sweating pore of his being by Dore Mann  Ronald Bronstein’s striking feature film debut is personal cinema at its most uncompromising and fierce. (Dargis)\n\n‘GEORGE A. ROMERO’S DIARY OF THE DEAD’ (R, 1:35) The loosest, goosiest chapter in Mr. Romero’s continuing zombieland epic pivots on a clutch of students who in the process of fleeing legions of the undead have taken up video cameras, thus becoming the producers of their own snuff biopic. (Dargis)\n\n★ ‘GIRLS ROCK!’ (PG, 1:30) For one earsplitting, consciousness-raising week at the Rock ’n’ Roll Camp for Girls in Portland, Ore., 100 delirious 8- to 18-year-old girls  many of whom have never touched an instrument  find expression for more than their music. Employing an amiably chaotic visual style, Shane Cook and Arne Johnson’s jubilant documentary observes a place where power chords and empowerment go hand in hand. (Catsoulis)\n\n‘HANNAH MONTANA AND MILEY CYRUS: BEST OF BOTH WORLDS CONCERT’ (G, 1:14) This 3-D concert movie, offering musical highlights of Miley Cyrus’s recent sold-out tour, offers little in the way of revealing backstage glimpses of the star. But that won’t bother your daughter if she’s a “Hannah Montana” fan. Good luck getting tickets opening weekend. (Webster)\n\n‘IN BRUGES’ (R, 1:47) An amusing trifle from the potty-mouthed playwright Martin McDonagh about two Irish hit men (the very fine Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) and their nuttier boss (an even better Ralph Fiennes). The characters talk a blue streak beautifully, but Mr. McDonagh has yet to find the nuance and poetry that make his red images signify with commensurate sizzle and pop. (Dargis)\n\n‘I AM LEGEND’ (PG-13, 1:40) Will Smith, as the sole surviving human resident of Manhattan, paints the town in fine style in this postapocalyptic zombie action thriller. It falls apart in the last act, but Mr. Smith and the special effects make it quite watchable up until then. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘I’M NOT THERE’ (R, 2:15) Hurling a Molotov cocktail into the biopic factory, Todd Haynes uses six different actors and an astonishing range of looks and styles to meditate on the life, work and cultural impact of Bob Dylan. Inspired and inexhaustible. (Scott)\n\n‘J’ENTENDS PLUS LA GUITARE (I DON’T HEAR THE GUITAR ANYMORE)’ This 1991 meditation on love, from the French director Philippe Garrel, is oblique, poetic and unexpectedly moving. (No rating, 1:38, in French) (Scott)\n\n‘JODHAA AKBAR’ (No rating, 3:13, in Hindi) They may not make ’em like they used to in Hollywood, but sometimes they still do in India. This film, about the 16th-century Muslim emperor Akbar (Hrithik Roshan), who marries a Rajput princess (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan)  a Hindu, that is  has star power, romance, a cast of thousands and enough elephants and gold to sink the Titanic. It also has a message of religious tolerance. (Rachel Saltz)\n\n‘JUMPER’ (PG-13, 1:30) A barely coherent genre mishmash from the usually reliable Doug Liman (“The Bourne Identity”) about a guy who transports himself across the globe at will. Next! (Dargis)\n\n★ ‘JUNO’ (PG-13, 1:31) A sharply written and acted coming-of-age comedy, starring the remarkable Ellen Page as Juno MacGuff, a teenager who deals with her unanticipated pregnancy in unexpected ways. (Scott)\n\n‘LIVE AND BECOME’ (No rating, 2:20, in Amharic, Hebrew and French) Fundamental issues of ethnic and religious identity and the agony of exile go to the heart of “Live and Become,” an intermittently compelling swatch of recent Israeli history filtered through the experience of an African immigrant. With epic aspirations that are only partly realized, the movie tries to be something like a contemporary “Exodus” from an outsider’s point of view. (Holden)\n\n‘MARRIED LIFE’ (PG-13, 1:30) A comedy of manners merged with a suspenseful psychological thriller, the movie aspires to be a hybrid of the sort that Alfred Hitchcock polished to perfection in the age of sexual subtext and subterfuge. When to shudder and when to smirk: as you watch this sly marital fable of secrets, lies and homicidal intent, you’re never sure of what your reaction should be. (Holden)\n\n‘MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY’ (PG-13, 1:32) The particular screwball screen magic Amy Adams commands in this weightless period fairy tale, based on the novel by Winifred Watson, hasn’t been this intense since the heyday of Jean Arthur. She helps turn a little nothing of a movie into a little something. (Holden)\n\n‘NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN’ (R, 2:02) Mean, violent and impeccable, Joel and Ethan Coen’s adaptation of a pulpy, compact novel by Cormac McCarthy lives and breathes in the central performances of Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem, who chase one another, $2 million and metaphysical truth through the Texas back country. (Scott)\n\n‘THE ORPHANAGE’ (R, 1:40, in Spanish) Juan Antonio Bayona’s Spanish ghost story, in which a woman (Belén Rueda) returns to her childhood home with her adopted son, is effectively scary, but not as emotionally rich as it could have been. (Scott)\n\n‘THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL’ (PG-13, 1:55) Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson star in a salacious slog about two hot blue bloods who ran amok and partly unclothed in the court of Henry VIII. (Dargis)\n\n★ ‘PARANOID PARK’ (R, 1:18) Gus Van Sant’s haunting, voluptuously beautiful portrait of a teenage boy who, after being suddenly caught in midflight, falls to earth, is a modestly scaled triumph without a false or wasted moment. (Dargis)\n\n‘PENELOPE’ (PG, 1:30) In this mirthless and poorly written and directed fairy tale, Christina Ricci plays an English heiress born with the snout of a pig. (Holden)\n\n★ ‘PERSEPOLIS’ (PG-13, 1:35, in French) Marjane Satrapi’s adaptation of her graphic novel-memoir is a free-spirited coming-of-age story, beautifully drawn and voiced by a formidable trio of French movie stars. (A. O. Scott)\n\n★ ‘THE SAVAGES’ (R, 1:53) Tamara Jenkins’s beautifully nuanced tragicomedy involves two floundering souls  a middle-aged brother and sister, played with force and feeling by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney  who are suddenly left to care for their infirm father (Philip Bosco). There isn’t a single moment of emotional guff or sentimentality in “The Savages,” a film that periodically caused me to wince, but also left me with a sense of acute pleasure, even joy. (Dargis)\n\n‘SEMI-PRO’ (R, 1:30) In this 1970s-rooted sports comedy, the latest in his series of wildly successful movies about demented man-children, Will Ferrell plays the owner-coach-promoter-star of the Tropics, a Flint, Mich., team that’s part of the soon-to-be-defunct American Basketball Association. The movie is a raunchy, R-rated goof that doesn’t cohere as a comedy but contains many hilarious moments, an amusing cast that includes Woody Harrelson and Andre Benjamin as basketball stars, and a wealth of period detail worthy of “Boogie Nights.” (Matt Zoller Seitz)\n\n‘SNOW ANGELS’ (R, 1:46) David Gordon Green’s warm, offbeat direction and some fine performances cannot rescue this tale of small-town American misery from a studious grimness that seems assumed rather than observed. (Scott)\n\n‘THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES’ (PG, 1:37) Computer-generated goblins menace three children in an old house. Not much enchantment. (Scott)\n\n‘STEP UP 2 THE STREETS’ (PG-13, 1:38) This earnest sequel to the 2006 cornball musical drama “Step Up” mixes new characters into the original’s setting, the neighborhoods surrounding the Maryland School of the Arts in Baltimore. Like its predecessor, it takes place in a gritty neighborhood, has a white lead (Briana Evigan as a striving dancer), posits a universe where racial and class differences are minor obstacles to fun and pretends its clichés aren’t clichés. The film’s likable cast and exuberant musical sequences almost save it. (Seitz)\n\n★ ‘TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE’ (R, 1:46) This documentary by Alex Gibney (“Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room”) traces a path from Bagram prison in Afghanistan to Abu Graib and Guantánamo, and serves up a powerful indictment of some of the American military’s tactics in the war on terror. (Scott)\n\n‘10,000 B.C.’ (PG-13, 1:49) In the future this saga, loaded with computer-generated imagery, about a tribe of mammoth-hunters will be enjoyable, in a campy kind of way, for its earnest, B-movie dumbness. At the moment, it’s just dumb. (Scott)\n\n★ ‘THERE WILL BE BLOOD’ (R, 2:38) Paul Thomas Anderson’s epic American nightmare tells a story of greed and envy of biblical proportions, set against the backdrop of the Southern California oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There is no God but money in this oil-rich desert, and his messenger is Daniel Plainview, a petroleum speculator played by a monstrous and shattering Daniel Day-Lewis. (Dargis)\n\n‘THE UNFORESEEN’ (No rating, 1:33) Laura Dunn’s well-meaning if fuzzy documentary about developmental sprawl in Austin, Tex., tackles a great big subject, or rather a handful of great big subjects, among them the rights of man, the death of nature, the water below, the air above and all that going, going, gone green in between. (Dargis)\n\n‘UNTRACEABLE’ (R, 1:40) Morally duplicitous torture porn: how else to describe this bleak, rain-washed horror thriller, whose predatory villain streams live video of his murders on his own popular Web site, killwithme.com? (Holden)\n\n★ ‘U2 3D’ (G, 1:25) The musical documentary “U2 3D,” which stitches together performances by this Irish rock band during a recent tour of South America, brazenly ignores the usual stipulations about making a 3-D film, to thrilling effect. The movie’s directors, Mark Pellington and Catherine Owens, layer the screen with multiple planes of information: long shots and medium shots of the musicians; images of the crowd; close-up details of graphics from the big screen that the band performs in front of that make the designs abstract and merge them with the performers. Thanks to the clarity of the movie’s format, digital 3-D, the result is not a confusing mishmash of images but a musical-experimental work that visually simulates the sensation of thinking. (Seitz)\n\n‘VANTAGE POINT’ (PG-13, 1:24) A gimmick (repeat the assassination of an American president over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over) in search of a point. (Dargis)\n\n‘WELCOME HOME ROSCOE JENKINS’ (PG-13, 1:54) This comedy about a talk-show host (Martin Lawrence) revisiting his relatives down South is just a shaggy diversion that gives its energetic star and its populous, accomplished supporting cast (including James Earl Jones as Papa Jenkins, Margaret Avery as Mamma Jenkins, and Cedric the Entertainer and Mo’Nique as the hero’s siblings) a chance to clown around. But it’s a cut above other films of its type, because every scene is packed with details that suggest that the film’s writer and director, Malcolm D. Lee (“The Best Man”), is working overtime to smuggle life into formula. (Seitz)\n\n‘THE YEAR MY PARENTS WENT ON VACATION’ (No rating, 1:44) A young boy comes of age against a backdrop of political repression and soccer mania in 1970 São Paulo. (Scott)\n\nFilm Series\n\nFILMS BY GEORGES FRANJU (Friday through Thursday) A weeklong retrospective for one of France’s most fascinating and difficult-to-classify filmmakers begins on Friday with “Head Against the Wall,” Franju’s 1959 film about a troublesome young man whose father has him committed to a psychiatric hospital. Typically for Franju, the film is a blend of documentary realism (shot at an actual mental institution) and gothic horror, a combination he worked to unforgettable effect with what is probably his best-known film, the surgical thriller “Eyes Without a Face,” also showing on Friday. The series continues with a package of Franju shorts (Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday) that includes his notorious first film, “Blood of the Beasts” (1949), a disturbingly clear-eyed look at a Parisian slaughterhouse, as well as “Judex” (Saturday, Sunday and Thursday), a 1963 feature-length homage to the pioneer French filmmaker Louis Feuillade, who practiced a similar mix of the real and the surreal. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Dave Kehr)\n\nTHE TALKING PICTURES OF MANOEL DE OLIVEIRA (Friday through Thursday) A continuing review of the work of this endlessly inventive and apparently ageless Portuguese director continues at BAMcinématek with two important, rarely screened films from his middle period that both draw on postmodernist devices to communicate a sense of 19th-century life. “Doomed Love” (Saturday) is a 262-minute adaptation of a celebrated Portuguese novel about star-crossed lovers that helped regenerate critical interest in Mr. Oliveira when it made the festival rounds in 1978; it will be followed on Sunday by the even better (and significantly shorter) “Francisca” from 1981. The story of a cynical aristocrat who seduces and abandons an innocent young woman, “Francisca” established the stylistic parameters  presentational acting, a deliberate theatricality  that continue to shape Mr. Oliveira’s work. BAMcinématek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)"
