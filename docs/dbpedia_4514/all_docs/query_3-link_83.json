        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nStanding in the almost empty apartment, Andy only now felt how much of her life she had left behind. Nate had been a constant for almost five years. He had been, certain, and safe. She did not doubt that it had been a good decision to end their relationship, but she felt that a very large part of her had gone with him. It wasn't just the things he had taken — the last box just two minutes earlier. Andy hadn't even realized how much personality Nate had given this apartment. Most of it belonged to him and now it was all gone.\n\nShe didn't blame him for that, because she had hurt him in a way she would never have thought herself. The old Andy, who had been head over heels in love with Nate, would never have been able to think of something like that, and yet, here she stood.\n\nLooking around the living room, she could almost feel how empty the apartment seemed now, how much bigger it had become in her eyes. Andy had never been one of those people who collected things. When the time was right, she simply swapped out an old thing for a new one, and so on. She wasn't sentimental about things, so there weren't many left in the apartment. All the memories they had, Nate took with him, and Andy didn't know how she should feel about that.\n\n\"It's just us now, Laggy.\" She said to the cat, and only now did she feel how wet her voice sounded.\n\nHe looked at her, tilted his head, and meowed twice, jumping off the couch and rubbing against her legs. Andy bent down and picked him up, hugging him tightly, needing this more than she probably ever had.\n\nShe was happy that it was over with Nate, she was. It was just that at some point their lives had started to go in completely different directions, and Andy... well, Andy found someone else.\n\nShe cursed loudly and sat down on the couch, letting the cat out of her hands, not wanting to hug him too tightly by accident. Only now did the real weight of the whole situation and what it meant hit her.\n\nShe was completely alone.\n\nShe had Doug, of course, and even Nigel or Emily, but it wasn't the same, wasn't it? After almost five years of belonging to someone, now, when he was gone, she felt empty in a way, as if something was missing.\n\n\"Oh, God, I'm so fucking lost...\" She whispered and bowed her head, running her hands through her hair and clenching her fingers.\n\nAndy had no idea what was happening to her or what she was feeling. On the one hand, there was this relief, this freedom she had been yearning for some time. The knowledge that she didn't have to confess to anyone, that when she returned home, she would finally rest there, instead of participating in another argument. On the other hand, there was a certain fear and anxiety. It wasn't just about the apartment any more but about the very aspect of sharing her life with another person.\n\nShe sniffled loudly, gasping for air as her body seemed to forget to breathe, how deeply she had sunk into all the fond memories she had shared with Nate.\n\nThe sound of her phone ringing startled her. She got up to get it and walked to the nearby table in three quick steps. She wiped her nose with her hand and wiped it on an old, worn-out shirt before answering the call.\n\n\"Y-yes?\" She stuttered and sniffed again, trying to calm herself.\n\n\"Hey, Andy!\" The chorus of two thirteen-year-olds rang in her ears, and she couldn't help but smile. \"When are you coming over?\"\n\n\"Oh, umm, I-, I don't know, guys, you'd have to ask your mom.\" She mumbled, embarrassed.\n\nShe wasn't going to promise the twins' anything, especially since she had a feeling that her recent behaviour had made Miranda even more likely to distance herself from her. Andy might be younger, but she wasn't stupid enough to not see when someone reacted to her, and Miranda did. Very much so. If she wanted to make it real, she had to approach it thoughtfully.\n\n\"Mom already agreed.\" One of them said, and from the tone of her voice, Andy was almost certain it was Caroline. \"So, when? We were thinking that Friday would be good, so when you bring the Book, you could stay longer.\"\n\nAndy frowned. Just because it was supposed to be Friday didn't mean Miranda would agree to the twins staying up that late. Why couldn't they plan it for Saturday or Sunday, if Miranda had no problem with...\n\n\"Girls,\" She sighed and put a hand to her forehead, lifting her bangs slightly. \"I'd love to come over and spend some time with you, but for that, your mom has to agree. I won't invite myself over and put her in an uncomfortable situation because you little rascals are scheming.\"\n\n\"... told you she'd figure it out...\" She heard from one of the headphones in the distance and snorted under her nose. \"Come on, Andy! It would be such a nice surprise for our mom! She loves surprises!\"\n\n\"I'm sure she does.\" Andy snorted because the twins could be very charming in their evil plans, but she was perfectly aware of how Miranda felt about anything that happened without any prior planning. \"Shouldn't you be asleep? I was over there about an hour ago and it was after 10pm already.\"\n\n\"Andy, we're not eight.\" Thirteen ain't that much more, but Andy could admit that they had a point. \"Momma's just overly sensitive about us. We normally go to bed a lot later.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and then I'm the one to listen to her whining that she was almost late to work because of you not being able to get out of bed in the morning.\"\n\n\"I'm totally telling Mom that you said she's whining.\" It was definitely Cassidy, who started giggling evilly, and Caroline joined her.\n\nDamn those kids — that's why Andy didn't want any.\n\n\"Okay, okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves.\" She started slowly, also laughing under her breath. \"What do you want?\"\n\nBefore Andy got an answer, she had to wait a moment, because there was a long conference going on at the other end of the phone. In the meantime, she went to the kitchen and opened one of the cabinets and suddenly remembered why she had been in such a terrible mood earlier; there was only one cup and two glasses in the entire cabinet. She swallowed hard and reached for the cup and poured juice into it. After some thought, she poured it down the sink and reached for the already opened bottle of sweet wine in the fridge.\n\n\"We've decided.\" I guess- Caroline spoke and Andy hummed, letting them know that she was ready for their price for silence. \"You'll write our essays for English. We have the time until Monday.\"\n\nAndy snorted and shook her head, not believing that this was what they had come up with. She had already had experience doing homework for the twins. It wasn't like she was doing it every day any more, Miranda had clearly understood that it wasn't the best for them, but when there was a bigger physics project to do, or a big paper to write for English, Andy was still the first to act.\n\nNow, she felt that she was already close enough with the girls that she could easily make some changes to the routine.\n\n\"I can help you write it, guys, but I won't do it for you.\"\n\n\"Damn, okay, fine.\" Andy was one hundred percent sure that it was Cassidy. \"So when will you come over?\"\n\n\"Ask your mom!\" She said in a melodic voice and laughed when she heard their whining in the receiver. \"It's really late and I have to get up at 4am, I have to go.\"\n\n\"What? That early? Why?\"\n\n\"Again, ask your mom! Goodnight, munchkins!\"\n\nShe hung up and held the phone in her hand for a moment, smiling. Suddenly she didn't feel alone any more.\n\nDespite the last sudden surge of courage, Andy had felt when she had decided to kiss Miranda back (on the cheek), she now felt as if all the air had been let out of her like a mattress.\n\nWell, it's not like up to this point she was a Casanova reborn, but she at least had some courage to actually talk to that woman.\n\nTwo more strokes of the pen, and she finished drawing what she had started the last time she had sat behind Miranda in the conference room.\n\nThis time the whole meeting was about accessories, which meant it was an exceptionally boring meeting. Andy thought the run-throughs that mostly happened in Miranda's office were much more interesting. Then she could see how the whole outfit was made, and yes, they were talking about the colour of the jewellery, and how big it should be, depending on the length of the jacket. Andy would listen to them and just imagine how it all could be accessorized. But those meetings? Good God, it was about two hours of listening about two, almost the same necklaces, and at the end, they would go with something completely different — it was always like that.\n\nYes, Andy was still bitter about those belts, because they were, in fact, almost the same.\n\nThis time, however, Miranda seemed just as bored, which Andy noticed only because she decided to fix one thing about her face in the drawing. She sat the same way as always, with one leg over the other. This time, however, she rocked one slightly as if she couldn't wait to leave, and her gaze did not focus on those who were talking, but instead spent most of the time looking at her lap and secretly at the watch on her left hand.\n\nAndy would die just to know what the woman was thinking about.\n\nMiranda had her own notes on the table and suddenly began to write something in them. Normally Andy wouldn't have paid any attention to it, but since observing this woman had become a hobby of hers (not in a creepy way), it didn't escape her that the movements of her pen were... odd. Andy wasn't an expert, of course, but she was right, then that would mean that Miranda was also one of those people who drew something on paper to pass the time. She could easily imagine her back in school, bored in class and drawing strange things in the margins of her notebooks.\n\nAndy bit her lip slightly at the thought and looked back at her own drawing. It wasn't of any known quality. Her skills were quite limited, and the only knowledge she had of this form of art was thanks to her mother, who had forced her to take drawing lessons as a child. If Andy had to count all the different things her mother had tried to get her into, she would have spent the entire day doing it. Almost her entire childhood had been filled with different things to find something for her to do. From swimming lessons to singing lessons, to even a single horseback riding lesson. That had broken her finger, and since then her mother had given up on sports.\n\nShe felt bad about letting her mother down all the time because she was expected to do better. Jill was the dream daughter — she was a surgeon. Andy was supposed to follow in her father's footsteps and become a lawyer, and she ended up working at Runway and a lesbian, or bi, whatever.\n\nHow funny things turned out for her in life.\n\n\"... gold would add some depth to it, especially that we already have some of it in the dress.\"\n\nAndy blinked and thought back to what was actually happening at the meeting. If she didn't want to get fired for being absent-minded, she should focus on what needed to be done, not what she wanted to do.\n\nMiranda cleared her throat, and suddenly the whole room went silent. It fascinated Andy that despite the general chaos, people always seemed to be listening for even the slightest sound from Miranda, waiting on tenterhooks for her to speak. Until now, the woman had simply sat and watched, which must have been driving them crazy.\n\n\"It amazes me, how for the last half an hour all you people talk about is what might be barely good for the next issue.\" She said in a suspiciously light tone as if she was in deep shock. Maybe she was. \"I was expecting clear ideas and samples from you, but it seems, that you have no idea whatsoever of what is required of you. How disappointing.\"\n\nOh, Andy was so glad to not be on the receiving end of that. She was a couple of times before, and she'd rather forget. Although at this moment she'd get anything from Miranda, even the harsh words.\n\n\"Here we have some samples from Tiffany, Arples, and Cartier, although Van Cleef also sent us some.\" Maddie stood up from her place and gave Miranda a couple of samples.\n\n\"Oh, look at that. Suddenly we do have the samples.\" Miranda certainly raised one eyebrow, although Andy couldn't see from where she was sitting. \"How thrilling that at least one of you woke up.\"\n\nGod, she was torturing them. Miranda always had a way with words, but Andy personally thought that when she was getting all nice like that, it was the best way to make people feel stupid. Looking around, Andy noticed that it was exactly how they all felt right now.\n\n\"Andrea, notes.\"\n\nAndy flinched because she had almost got out of the habit of Miranda talking to her at work. Luckily, she knew exactly what notes she was referring to and quickly pulled them out of her purse and stood up. Despite the few other people in the room with them, Andy decided to take a little risk.\n\n\"Here.\" She said quietly and placed the necessary notes right in front of Miranda.\n\nHowever, she stood a bit closer than necessary and leaned her right hand lightly on the back of Miranda's chair in such a way that it was not noticeable to anyone else. Instead of going back to her seat, she decided to stay next to her out of curiosity about what she would say.\n\nMiranda, she had to admit, gave her no sign at all, but Andy managed to hear her suck in a slightly louder breath. Then the tables turned, because Miranda, as if sensing what Andy was up to, smirked, and leaned back against the back of the chair, so that her back was directly touching her hand.\n\nTo say that she was way worse at hiding her reaction would be an understatement. She was able to control her breathing, but Andy was sure that her face would start to turn redder and redder.\n\nIt was stupid to admit it, but as she stood there next to Miranda, she didn't hear a single word that was exchanged at the table, and from those samples she didn't see anything. Finally, Miranda moved, leaning over the table again, and Andy quickly took the opportunity to remove her hand, feeling her whole body tingle where it had touched Miranda.\n\nShe glanced down and couldn't help but smile a little when she noticed that she was right; Miranda was doing little drawings of clothes, as if she was designing them, on her own notes. It was another adorable fact about her.\n\nMiranda stood up suddenly, apparently ending the meeting, and Andy took a step back to make room for her. She said something to the others and as she walked away from the table she turned around with a challenge flickering in her eyes and a sly smile on her lips.\n\n\"Come along, Andrea,\" She said in a lower voice than usual, which made Andy lose her balance. \"That's all.\"\n\nWhere was the woman that was pretending that Andy didn't exist?\n\nShe obediently followed her back to their office. Miranda stopped suddenly, causing Andy to almost bump into her, and turned around, still with that expression on her face, completely ignoring how close they were suddenly standing.\n\n\"I want a steak in one hour, bring me those samples and tell them that we need more of them from Cartier.\" She recited, her eyes scanning Andy up and down. \"You should wear Armani more often, Andrea, it suits you.\"\n\nAndy swallowed hard, unable to get a word out, so she just nodded her head to show that she understood. Miranda looked at her like a Predator at its prey and turned back to sit at her desk.\n\nAndy didn't wait for any 'that's all', instead she walked out of her office and went straight for those damn samples.\n\nIt seemed that Miranda decided to play after all.\n\nWhatever it was, that Miranda was doing, it worked, because Andy was on the verge of sending her a bill for the high blood pressure medication, that she would be definitely facing shortly because of this woman.\n\nIt really shouldn't be as surprising to her, how Miranda was good at everything that she decided to do. Whether it was because she only did things that she was good at, or she just made sure there was no witness if something went bad — it didn't matter. The fact was, that when she decided to engage in something — she would succeed.\n\nApparently, she decided that Andy would be her new victim, and she knew exactly how to approach the subject. Not that Andy was complaining about that, but she sure as hell had no idea that she'd ever see Miranda in action. That kind of action.\n\nAndy had a rather simple plan for getting to Miranda. She decided to keep up the flowers, but also add to them by just saying something nice to her. Let it be just a simple 'i like your hair' — at the end of the day, it didn't matter. Well, it did, of course it did, but the point was, that she wanted to show her intentions without voicing them directly. In Andy's head, it all sounded manageable, but she knew that the moment she would stand in front of her, the words would probably stick in her throat, but she had to try. She'd never forgive herself if she didn't know that Miranda might be even slightly interested. Maybe not to the same extent as Andy was, but she for sure wasn't as straight as people thought she was.\n\nNow, sitting in the car with her, on their way to Dior, Andy gathered the courage to speak. Miranda looked beautiful that day. She had an ecru shirt with a notched collar with square corners. The v-neck was rather deep, and going by the slightly transcendent material of the shirt, Andy assumed that the bra was also ecru. She blushed at that thought and turned around trying to calm down. She wasn't a fifteen-year-old boy, damn it!\n\n\"You were saying something?\" Miranda asked and Andy turned to her indignantly because she hadn't said a word and had almost twisted her neck to make sure there wasn't Miranda nowhere in sight, so she would be able to gather her thoughts.\n\nShe kept her own expression as calm as she could and looked at Miranda, who was looking at her with a raised eyebrow and a challenge in her eyes. Oh, this was such a dirty move, to place Andy in such a position, that she now couldn't back off from. Her pride wouldn't let her. Miranda's eyes were shimmering beautifully, and Andy realized that it was because she was smiling with them — she had that talent. Even though the rest of her face expressed nothing at all, Andy could see how amusing this whole thing between them was for her.\n\nShe really wanted to know what was the reason for that, because just a couple of days ago, Miranda was avoiding her as if she was sick. Whatever had changed, Andy was glad for it, although if the woman wanted to play now and play dirty at that, she wasn't sure how much of a chance she had to win. She had one goal in all of it, she wanted Miranda, and she could finally admit it to herself, but the reasons behind Miranda's participation — she had no clue. It could be the same, or it could be just a want to humiliate Andy, and she was known for being excellent at doing that to people.\n\nAndy blinked and knew that she couldn't back down now, because she'd disappoint Miranda, and it was something that she just would never do.\n\n\"No, not really.\" She started and saw how Miranda's eyes dimmed slightly, and that was when she added; \"Well, I just wanted to say that you look really pretty today. I like the blouse.\"\n\nThere, she dropped the bomb, and she knew that it was the best thing she could say at the moment because Miranda was one of those people who had no idea how to accept any compliments. Well, she did, she heard a lot of them when on benefits people were saying how beautiful she looked, or when people were praising her work at Runway — those she knew how to accept, and she was doing it with a proud smile. But this? This was personal, not in front of the cameras, not for the show, and not said just to suck up to her, like many models do, just to be featured in the next issues. This was just for her, and it was pure and honest, and Miranda, being married to that idiot, probably never heard those any more.\n\nAnd she should. She deserved to hear them every day.\n\nAndy at the beginning thought that she'd have to act it up a bit, but it turned out that she didn't have to. She looked at Miranda with so much admiration on her face, and she didn't even have to think about it beforehand — she knew that's what it was. Andy always looked at Miranda with feelings and emotions written all over her face, not because she desperately wanted her to see them, but because she didn't want to hide them. Not from her.\n\n\"Oh.\" Miranda gasped and Andy officially thought that this little sound that she made, was her favourite, especially since, for some time now, she had heard it often. She cleared her throat. \"It's a shirt, Andrea. Do you know the designer?\"\n\nAndy almost, almost smirked noticing the slight blush and immediate retreat to the safer subject. One to zero, Priestly, she thought, because it was Miranda who wanted to provoke the whole conversation in the first place. Andy decided to follow, and just let her lead the rest of it. There was no use in overdoing it.\n\n\"Umm, I'm not sure, but I think it may be Chanel?\" She asked, more than stated because despite months in this environment, she still didn't distinguish brands that well.\n\n\"How do you know it?\" Miranda asked, looking noticeably calmer now that she had full control of the situation.\n\n\"Well-\" She swallowed and turned more toward Miranda without even thinking about it too much and leaned back slightly from the back of her seat to get a better look at the shirt. \"I mean-, it looks very classic, timeless. Maybe it's the collar, because it's kind of, umm, double? I don't know what it's called. But the buttons are covered in small silver stones, probably worth more than I make in a week here. It just looks like something Chanel would do.\" She shrugged and looked up at Miranda, frowning slightly as she saw that the woman's face was once again slightly pink.\n\nThen she realized that she had been staring at her breasts the whole time.\n\n\"Yes.\" Miranda took a deep breath and broke eye contact. \"So, who would be the designer?\"\n\nAndy rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Come on, everyone knows Karl Lagerfeld is the creative director for Chanel.\"\n\nMiranda smirked and looked back at her, her gaze intent and Andy would give anything to know her thoughts. The older woman looked very pleased as if Andy's answer gave her more pleasure than the compliment itself. For a moment she wondered if it wasn't just that the woman liked to hear when Andy talked about clothes. As if the fact that she was learning about it and expanding her knowledge was some kind of... aphrodisiac. Smart is the new sexy after all, or rather has always been.\n\nSuddenly she wanted to learn absolutely everything about fashion just for Miranda.\n\n\"I named my cat after him\" She blurted out, unable to control her tongue.\n\nMiranda's face suddenly changed from slightly dreamy to perplexed, and Andy almost laughed at that. It was the face of pure disbelief.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, he kinda looks like him.\" She admitted and shrugged, not sure if she should be embarrassed by the whole thing or just start laughing. \"I can show you.\"\n\nWithout waiting for Miranda's reaction, she pulled out her phone and looked for a picture of Laggy she had recently taken of him. He had such a serious expression on it that if they were ever to make a movie about the cat fashion world... or something, he would get the lead role.\n\nWhen she found it, she looked back at Miranda, who now looked even slightly interested, and showed her the picture. The older woman hummed in agreement, for sure, and narrowed her eyes slightly. Andy got herself together then and, pushing her phone into Miranda's hands, reached into her purse for her glasses and handed them to her quickly. Miranda took them without a word, put them on, and lifted the phone higher to see the picture properly. Andy wanted to record the moment because she couldn't believe that she had just bragged about her cat and Miranda actually seemed interested.\n\n\"Good God, he actually looks like him.\" She mumbled and Andy couldn't stop the giggle that escaped her lips. Miranda handed her the phone back, took off her glasses, and looked at Andy with a slight amusement. \"Why a cat?\"\n\n\"You don't like cats?\" Andy asked, ready to defend the pride of Laggy with all her might.\n\n\"I'm not fond of them, no.\" She admitted and chuckled.\n\nAndy had to admit that it was nice. Just this, being able to talk with her, even laugh a little. This whole cat-and-mouse game aside, Andy was just really happy that the silent days were apparently over.\n\n\"What about Patricia?\"\n\n\"What about her?\" Miranda sighed, and although she looked as if the whole conversation was boring her, Andy knew that if it were, they would both be sitting in silence a long time ago... or she would be dropped off at the next intersection.\n\n\"Well, why 'Patricia'? Someone famous or did you just like the name?\"\n\nMiranda looked at her for a moment as if she was deciding what would be the best answer to that. And then, oh, dear lord, she licked her upper lip, like she often did, when she was thinking about something, and Andy looked at it for a second, before going back to her eyes. Miranda noticed because she stopped and instead smirked and turned her head a little, breaking their eye contact.\n\nAndy felt her heartbeat getting a little uneven.\n\n\"My family dog, back in London, was named 'Patricia'.\" She finally said, and Andy hummed because she never thought that Miranda would be sentimental to that extent. \"All my dogs are 'Patricias'.\"\n\nWait, what?\n\nAndy felt her jaw drop slightly in shock and was unable to hold back a short laugh that escaped her throat.\n\n\"Oh my God...\" She laughed, which earned her another sharp look. \"It's almost like with 'Emilys'.\" She added in a whisper, fascinated by that kind of approach.\n\nMiranda snorted and Andy immediately looked up at her, wanting not only to hear, but most of all to see her laugh.\n\n\"You could say that.\" She admitted and looked out the window, probably trying to hide her smile and put her hand to her mouth.\n\nAndy really wanted to ask about where Miranda was from, especially since this was the first time she decided to share something from her past, no matter that it was only about the dog. Sure, she could go online and read some information about her, but Andy didn't want to do that, no matter how tempted she was. Miranda had no way of doing the same about her, because she wasn't anyone important, although she probably wouldn't be too interested in that.\n\nShe wanted to hear it all from Miranda — from her own mouth. It wasn't just about knowing those things about her, but more about being trusted enough in her eyes to hear it.\n\nShe opened her mouth to ask but decided that there would be an even better opportunity some other day. She didn't want this moment between them to turn into an interrogation, so she leaned back in her seat and sighed slightly, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.\n\nAfter Nate left, Andy decided to clean the apartment. Mainly to completely get rid of any things he might have accidentally left behind and the ones he said 'do whatever you want with them, I don't want them' — those she threw out for sure.\n\nOverall, it wasn't going so badly for her. Andy wasn't a fan of cleaning and usually, the mess would just get bigger and bigger until she finally pulled herself together and did a general clean. For some reason, she couldn't keep things tidy regularly, and there were always dishes in the sink waiting to be washed. Now, however, seemed like the perfect time to get the apartment in tip-top shape, especially since she now had much less to do.\n\nShe ignored the slight knot in her stomach at the thought and continued cleaning while calling Laggy names under her breath because the main problem in the whole apartment was how much fur there was everywhere. That's why Andy paid special attention to taking care of her clothes and almost always left the house in the morning all ruffled up because the cat used to rub against her legs before she left and leave half of his fur on her.\n\nSpeaking of clothes; Andy decided to clean up her wardrobe a little. There were a lot of things in it, that she had worn so many times, that she felt embarrassed to wear them again to a place like Runway. Of course, there were washing machines, but she had the impression that there were things that the other warehouse workers didn't see in the same way she did. That's why she decided to sort everything and return some clothes to the Closet. She didn't even know when exactly to 'keep' and 'give back' the two piles and turn them into a third one called 'Miranda likes it'. She decided not to question it, though, and towards the end of the shift, she focused on that the most.\n\nAndy of course didn't keep any records of which clothes Miranda liked on her and which ones she didn't — she wasn't that bad — but she remembered exactly how she reacted when she really liked something. In the beginning, she'd just barely smile, later the said smile got bigger, and for some time now her breathing had quickened slightly, or she'd gone red in the face.\n\nIt was precisely these clothes that Andy aimed for, especially since Miranda had stopped completely ignoring her like she had been doing for the past few days.\n\nThe earlier trick with the flowers had been completely accidental. Andy simply had a knack for saying things that made already awkward situations worse. It had turned out to be a good thing, though. Not only had she learned something about flowers, but she had also pleased Miranda, and that was what it was all about — Miranda. The feedback from the older woman couldn't have been better — that is, if we were to judge it by her scale. Normally, the ideal outcome would be to thank her, go on a date, and maybe spend the rest of their lives together, not that Andy had planned to. Here, however, she received complete silence in response to her gestures.\n\nIt was a really good sign because if Miranda didn't sue her for harassing her and didn't throw all the flowers at her face, it meant that she appreciated the gesture.\n\nAndy was on a roll but had no idea how to seduce someone because she never really had to before. Nate just appeared and it happened. She was ashamed to admit it, but she had even read a few things about it on the internet, but when she saw how manipulative it all was, she decided that she wouldn't take any of that advice. All she wanted to do, was let Miranda know what she wanted without telling her that directly, or showing her, or...\n\nBasically, she wanted Miranda to just figure it out on her own — that would be perfect.\n\n\"What's got into you?\"\n\nShe lifted her head and looked at Emily, who was looking at her in disbelief.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You started to look good, is everything all right? I'm worrying.\"\n\nAndy looked at her with a bored look, but after a moment she snorted — you got to love Emily and her friendly nature.\n\n\"Ha, ha, very funny, I'm great, thanks.\"\n\nIt was quite late. Miranda had been called away by Irv, so she wasn't currently in the office, and the rest of the staff was already getting ready to leave, finishing up another day of work.\n\n\"Well, I'm in a remarkable mood, thank you for asking.\"\n\nShe looked at Emily once more, because apparently, she was in the mood to talk.\n\n\"That's amazing, Emily, tell me all about it.\" Andy used an overly pleasant voice, not caring about how much sarcasm was now pouring out of her.\n\nShe was talking with Emily after all, and if there was one person that could take someone being sarcastic or just pure mean it was her.\n\nShe reached into her purse took out a water bottle and opened it.\n\n\"Well, first of all, I don't have to be that ashamed of the way a person I'm working with looks any more...\" Andy rolled her eyes, although a smile still lurked at the corners of her mouth. \"And besides, I thought it would be good to say goodbye on good terms.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nAndy jumped up and spit almost everywhere, but mostly at her shirt. Emily couldn't possibly leave, she loved Runway more than probably her own mother.\n\n\"Shit!\" She cursed and ignored Emily, who was now smiling cheekily and stood up to go to the kitchen with the redhead following her. \"What the hell, Em? You're leaving?\"\n\nThe British woman stood in the doorway, and watched with pity Andy, as she applied paper towels to clean herself in any way she could.\n\n\"I'm not leaving Runway, are you mental?\" She asked, and her previous amusement was replaced by disgust that Andy could even come up with such an idea. \"It's the best place to work at if one has such aspirations as myself.\" Here Andy couldn't help but roll her eyes. \"I got a promotion.\"\n\nShe jerked her head up and looked at Emily with a sly smile.\n\n\"Really. Does Miranda know about it?\"\n\n\"Of course she does! What a question!\" Emily was outraged, her nostrils widening slightly.\n\nAndy, seeing her nervousness, laughed out loud, but then remembered that her entire shirt was wet and gulped again, returning to her feeble attempts at drying it.\n\n\"So, what are you going to do then? Which department?\"\n\n\"Stylist, as of now, then I'll move directly under Nigel,\" Emily explained proudly, her nose in the air.\n\n\"Wow, Em, I'm happy for you,\" Andy replied honestly, forgetting again about the rescue mission for her shirt. Then she added just to annoy her; \"I'm going to miss you so much.\"\n\nEmily snorted, causing Andy to smile, because that was exactly the reaction she had expected.\n\n\"Well,\" she cleared her throat. \"You'll know where to find me.\"\n\nAndy smiled genuinely this time at Emily, who, kind of, returned it. She hadn't expected to actually grow to like her so much, and it seemed to be mutual. Andy realized that she would miss the redhead at the desk across from her. She was used to having some sarcastic comments from her every day. She'd be way too comfortable in here without her.\n\nEmily seemed to be thinking about it too, because she cleared her throat awkwardly and adjusted her jacket, pulling it down slightly.\n\n\"Now, it's going to be your job to train the next one, so I'd start going through the resumes already if I were you. I'm here only until the end of the week.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Em,\" Andy said quietly, and feeling inspired by the moment, she walked over to her and hugged her, counting in her head; three, two, one...\n\n\"Let go of me! You'll ruin my jacket, and it was more expensive than all the bloody flannel skirts you've ever owned!\" Andy laughed again and took a step back, knowing that even though the redhead would never admit it, she had hugged her back for a moment. \"You better go to the loo and dry that up. I can almost see your entire boobs through that thing.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" Andy saluted and grinned at Emily, who rolled her eyes at her and walked out to take her things and probably go home.\n\nAndy wasn't going anywhere until Miranda got back, plus the Book still didn't arrive.\n\nShe knew that she could relax now, because at this hour there were no phone calls, and nobody wanted anything from her. The only thing left to do was to wait for the Book. She waved to Em when she saw that she was actually leaving and sighed heavily.\n\nThis whole day had been one of the most tiring ones. There was a huge mess because there was some water leak in the toilets, so they ended up completely unplugging them for a few hours. In addition, the clothes, which were supposed to be sent by Versace did not arrive and no one answered from them, neither Andy nor Emily. Miranda was forced to call them there herself and someone laughed and hung up on her. If you'd ask Andy for her opinion, she'd have to admit that the guy would have legends written about him.\n\nShe hadn't seen Miranda this angry in a long time.\n\nIt ended with Andy offering to go there and see what it was all about. She went, saw it, and broke down because it turned out that the documents were not approved in advance, so the clothes were not released for Runway. Somehow Andy managed to make it all work, and with the help of Roy, they took as much as they could and brought it with them.\n\nShe was tired, annoyed, and so fucking horny all the time, that she wanted to punch something.\n\nCounting to ten in her head to calm herself down, she threw the soaked paper towel into the trash and, grabbing her phone, went back to her desk. It was only water after all, so it will dry.\n\nShe sat back down at her desk and set her notebook and the book she had recently bought, 'Language of Flowers' by Kate Greenaway, in front of her. As far as it was rather helpful, she had to admit that she looked at flowers differently now and understood people who loved them better.\n\n\"I come with a gift!\" Tom announced his arrival and Andy smiled tiredly at him, reaching for the Book. \"How are things?\"\n\n\"Could be better.\" She sighed and shrugged. Andy was tired enough from today that she didn't even care that the entire front of her shirt clung to her like a second skin. \"You?\"\n\n\"I'm great actually.\" He admitted and laughed as if he couldn't believe his own words. \"I've got an offer. For a job.\"\n\nAndy's eyes widened and her mouth fell open in surprise.\n\n\"Oh, wow, what kind of job?\"\n\nTom smiled, obviously proud of his not-yet-achievement, and leaned his elbow on her desk, his other hand in his pocket.\n\n\"Runway France.\" He replied proudly. \"Well, not sure if I'll get it, but-\"\n\n\"My God, Tom! This is amazing!\" Andy assured him quickly.\n\n\"Yeah, I-, I think so too.\"\n\nAndy stood up to congratulate him properly. She stepped out from behind the desk and extended her hand to him with a wide smile. She was happy for him, she realized.\n\n\"Come on, I don't even know if I got it, yet.\" He laughed but shook her hand either way.\n\nThen he pulled and hugged her.\n\nAndy felt a cold shiver, that wasn't any near the ones Miranda was causing, but decided to hug him back. She already felt rather awkward and didn't want to let it be even more. She patted his back twice and wanted to move back, but apparently, Tom wanted to make it last a little longer.\n\nNow she was getting annoyed, and the previous approach to the matter, not to make the situation unnecessarily unpleasant, turned into a desire to start a fight.\n\n\"Okay, that's it.\" She finally said, and when he still didn't let go, instead moving his hand higher up, to her neck, Andy was ready to kick him right between his legs, when someone cleared their throat.\n\nAndy finally gathered enough strength to push him away, and silently sighed with relief when she saw Miranda, who, without stopping, walked past them.\n\n\"The Book, Andrea.\" She called from her office, and Andy quickly turned and grabbed it. \"You may go.\" She added to Tom and waved her hand dismissively, not even looking up.\n\nTom wanted to say something else and grab Andy's hand, but she nimbly passed him and practically flew into Miranda's office, only saying a quiet 'sorry' to him.\n\nThen she was mad at herself for saying that.\n\nShe walked up to Miranda's desk and looked at her gratefully, putting the Book in front of her.\n\n\"I'm surprised, Andrea, aren't you with that cook?\" She asked and there was a hint of steel in her voice and distance.\n\nAndy's eyes widened in surprise caused not only by Miranda's tone and how nervous she seemed, but also by the fact that she had even suggested something like that. It's not like she was hoping for any words of comfort, because nothing actually happened. Besides, Miranda once told her about setting boundaries with that kind of people and it wasn't in her nature to repeat herself.\n\n\"N-no.\" She straightened up and cleared her throat. \"I mean-, I was, but not any more.\"\n\nMiranda slowed down her movements for a second. She was in the middle of gathering all the documents on her desk, but she quickly hid it. If it weren't for the fact that Andy was watching her so intently at that moment, she wouldn't have noticed this subtle reaction and Miranda was the epitome of subtlety.\n\nShe had had many opportunities to observe the older woman as her assistant, and she was very familiar with how Miranda's mind worked. Many said that she was impossible to please, that you never knew what to expect, and that she wanted everybody to read her mind. Those things were true to some extent, but Andy knew that if one knew what to look for, one would have no problem at all.\n\nMiranda was a master at hiding her feelings and appearing without any emotions almost. She was focused only on work and made it look as if she never did anything else. Work, work, work. Of course, she was a workaholic, Andy thought, but there was so much more to her... Being allowed to see all of those layers of her character, was an honour for Andy. She was always a people pleaser, so to be granted that level of trust, when even Miranda could relax and even say a joke — that was quite an accomplishment.\n\n\"Really.\" She said and her movements slowed a little. Then, after a moment of silence, she added; \"Why is that?\"\n\nAndy swallowed hard and shifted her weight from foot to foot. She didn't feel like talking about her relationship with Nate, much less how it had ended. The guilt and the way she'd treated him still lurked in the shadows of her mind and would occasionally surface. She wanted to talk about it, but Doug had been so busy that he hadn't had time at all, and if Miranda was the alternative, Andy was more than willing to wait a little longer.\n\n\"Umm, we just fought.\"\n\n\"About your work or me?\" Miranda asked and straightened up, setting aside the papers she'd been sorting up to this point. Her voice was suddenly much more serious.\n\nThat was a bold question. Very pointed in Andy's opinion, if you'd ask. Although Miranda looked angry at her, Andy had no idea what she had done to deserve harsher treatment. That day was tiring for all of them, but it was a long time since Miranda would just go off at her, only because she happened to be close by.\n\nShe frowned, confused by the situation she found herself in. Miranda had different moods, although impatience was the most common. At this moment she looked... different. Beautiful, but different, in a way Andy didn't recognize.\n\nAnd she was so sure she knew them all.\n\n\"Both, actually.\" She admitted before she could stop herself.\n\nMiranda's breathing was even, although it was obvious that it wasn't because she was calm, but because she was keeping an eye on it. Her eyes were pressing Andy into the ground, her posture was intimidating. Straight, and confident, and the nervous expression on her face didn't make her look nice now.\n\nShe didn't say anything more and the tension between them increased. Andy knew that now it was mainly up to her how the conversation would go, and there were several possible scenarios. She was about to speak up when Miranda broke the silence, clearly deciding that this was the best time to confront Andy. About what — she had no idea.\n\n\"Yes, I remember him to be the jealous type.\" She said slowly and sighed slightly as if she was suddenly recalling their conversation from their weekend together.\n\nAndy stopped breathing for a moment because this was the first time Miranda had referred to those two days in any way.\n\n\"Yeah, he was-\"\n\n\"Did he have a reason to be jealous, Andrea?\"\n\nAndy felt as if the temperature in the room had risen by a dozen or so degrees in a moment. Her breathing quickened, and she wasn't sure if it was from the stress of being put in such a situation by Miranda, or because the woman's voice sounded almost... seductive.\n\nShe had no idea what Miranda was playing at. There were so many mixed signals. From kissing her on the cheek to pretending that it didn't happen, to now acknowledging it and using it to tease or rather confront Andy.\n\nWhat should she say to that? It's not like she could just straight up deny — she didn't want to lie about it. It felt too personal. The feelings that she started to have were so pure in her mind, and so new that she didn't want to stain them with negativity. But she couldn't just tell her how it was, plainly, just like that. That would be wrong and, and, and Andy didn't want Miranda to learn about it all in that way.\n\n\"Would you like there to be a reason?\" She asked quietly so that if anything, she could have some route of escape.\n\nHer heart was beating fast and irregularly like crazy. Mixed emotions of warmth and anger took over Andy's control alternately, and she did everything she could not to say too much, not to say words she might regret.\n\nAll the while, step by step, she was building the foundations for a completely new relationship with Miranda, one she had started dreaming about less than three months ago. Andy didn't want it to culminate in Miranda pressing her for answers to the questions that were tormenting her. She was so angry and in a way disappointed, that the older woman thought that this was the way to do it. This was the best way to get Andy to talk just because she also didn't understand what was happening between them.\n\nMiranda must have seen something in Andy's expression, or the question itself was enough for her to decide to let it go. Without saying another word, she returned to collecting papers and sat down at the desk.\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\nAndy swallowed and realized there was no point in fighting for an answer. Miranda thought that she was the only one allowed to ask questions, without giving anything in return.\n\nShe turned around, took her things, and left, deciding that it was better to leave Miranda to her own mind. Maybe she'd come up with an answer on her own.\n\nAndy had decided some time ago that she would throw away her home phone, which she no longer used anyway. She always had her cell phone with her and simply gave it out to people when they asked. For some reason, however, she decided to give her home number to the twins. Well, the reason was obvious, it got to the point where they called her almost every day. While Andy appreciated their sympathy and even a certain kind of affection they showed for her, she wasn't always able to pick up and give them the time they deserved. That's why she shared her home number with them so that if anything happened, they could always leave a voicemail, at least for her, when the information they had to convey couldn't wait.\n\nFor a week now, Andy's routine had included listening to all the messages from the twins every day when she got home from work. She had to admit that it cheered her up every time, regardless of what had happened during the day.\n\nThis time, she knew it would have to wait, because she finally managed to meet Doug, who had come over to her place and was sitting on the couch, looking around the apartment as if he didn't recognize it.\n\nAndy felt the same.\n\n\"Jesus, it looks so much bigger now.\" He noticed and Andy nodded in agreement. \"How are you holding up?\"\n\n\"Not bad, actually.\" She said, even though it wasn't exactly true. \"I'm getting used to being single again. Forgot what it was like.\"\n\nDoug snorted and shoved a handful of chips into his mouth.\n\n\"Welcome to my world! You're gonna love it.\" Doug laughed, but seeing Andy's raised eyebrow—a gesture she definitely didn't pick up from Miranda—he looked at her indignantly, determined to convince her. \"I'm serious! It's just me and my peaceful apartment, and there's no one bothering me all the time. The whole bed for me, and...\"\n\n\"But I like sleeping with someone,\" Andy admitted and went up to sit next to him with two bottles of bear in hands.\n\n\"Yeah, but she's unavailable for you, so get used to cold sheets.\" Doug snorted, earning him a light tap on the shoulder.\n\nThey clinked their bottles and took a sip.\n\n\"Shut up, it's not like anything is going to happen.\" She shrugged and took another sip of beer. \"At least I don't think so, she's weird, Douggy.\"\n\nHe looked at her, his eyes sparkling.\n\n\"Is that a hint of hope that I'm hearing in your voice?\" Doug laughed and turned to face her more, reaching for the bag of chips and setting them next to his lap on the couch. \"Spill it, I need all the tee.\"\n\nAndy smiled wryly and sat back.\n\n\"Well, you know how at the beginning she would just ignore me because she was clearly uncomfortable about the whole kiss and all. Well, something must have changed her mind, because now she's all over the subject.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I-, I honestly have no idea how to even describe it.\" She snorted and ran her hand through her hair. \"Suddenly she makes all of those references to that weekend, and she's teasing me about it, and I'm just like-\" She opened her mouth, having no idea how to describe it, then pointed at herself. \"Like that.\"\n\n\"Yeah, she's totally into you...\"\n\n\"Oh God, stop saying that!\"\n\n\"...she just doesn't know how to handle it.\" He said and looked at it as if it was general knowledge. \"Oh, come on, Andy, she's over forty, and have only been with men. No wonder she's confused about it all.\"\n\n\"Or maybe she's just kind of person to tease me about it, because there's been millions of girls before that were in l-, into her.\" She suggested and quickly drank beer, the word almost making its way through her throat.\n\nShe wasn't in love, she knew she wasn't. Andy just didn't want Doug to get the wrong idea.\n\nHe looked at her pointedly and got serious for a moment.\n\n\"Do you really believe that?\"\n\n\"I-\" She started, because did she? \"I would like not to, Douggy. I mean-, I don't even know if I do, it's just-. For sure, I'm not the first assistant that fell for her.\" She grunted, annoyed at herself for not being able to voice all the things that had been on her mind all this time.\n\nShe looked at Doug and realized, that he didn't actually understand what was happening to her. Andy wasn't surprised, not really, because she couldn't understand it herself. There were so many mixed feelings that shouldn't go together, but somehow they did. There was no possible way to explain it to him, and suddenly she realized that she didn't want to.\n\nShe loved him like a brother, she could tell him anything, but this was something that she wanted to stay only between her and Miranda. What he knew — he knew, but the rest of it she'd keep for herself.\n\n\"I don't even know.\" She waved her hand and gave him a fake smile, putting all her experience from kindergarten drama classes into it. \"What about you? Anyone on the radar?\"\n\nDoug snorted and immediately started talking about a new guy who started working a desk away from him. Andy listened to him with pleasure and tried to ignore the fact that for the last month or so all their conversations were about her.\n\nFrom now on it would change, Andy decided. Miranda was for her, and her only to figure out, and she decided to do just that.\n\nMiranda was on her way out of the office when she stopped suddenly and turned to Emily.\n\n\"Call Patrick, and tell him, that I want him here at 3pm today in my office. Also, tell Nigel, that we have to push through the run-through until tomorrow, so he'll better be prepared. Andrea, come with me.\"\n\nAndy stood up quickly, unsure whether she was supposed to take Miranda's bag, but figured since she didn't say anything, she'd just follow obediently.\n\nShe stepped out from behind her desk and quickly followed Miranda, who wordlessly headed toward the Closet. She entered and the staff clearly weren't expecting her visit, because all the noise died down for a moment and people began to move much faster than before.\n\nShe followed Miranda through most of the Closet when she finally stopped and turned right, where most of the evening dresses were hanging.\n\nShe stood by one of the racks and began to quickly move them between her fingers, mumbling under her breath. Andy smirked under her nose at that, because it was quite some time since she heard her do that. Always when she was focused and relaxed enough, she'd start to do that.\n\nMiranda hummed and stopped her movements and grabbed one of the racks, pulling the dress out in front of her. Andy tilted her head, examining it; it was pretty although she found it rather sparkly.\n\n\"What is that?\" She asked, deciding to start any kind of conversation because up to this point, Miranda hadn't said a word.\n\nHer head turned toward Andy quickly, looking as if she had forgotten she was even there. She smiled faintly, and Andy remembered that Miranda liked it when she showed interest in anything fashion-related.\n\n\"It's Valentino from 2003, Spring collection.\" She explained and turned fully to Andrea and walked up, holding the dress to her.\n\nAndy gasped in surprise, not expecting the move at all and hoping she had put on enough makeup to hide the blush building inside her. Miranda looked up from the dress for a moment, to look at Andy's face, probably hearing it, but quickly went back to examining the dress.\n\n\"W-what is happening?\" Andy asked genuinely confused, because as far as she was aware the run-through was supposed to be tomorrow, and she didn't sign up to change her career to modelling.\n\n\"Do you like the dress?\" Miranda asked instead of answering the question, as usual.\n\nAndy looked down, trying to see it again.\n\n\"It's nice.\"\n\n\"You don't like it.\" Miranda looked back at her, her face calm, her eyes giving nothing away.\n\nAndy felt her blood speeding up in her veins and panicked.\n\n\"No! I mean, I like it, it's just-\" She sighed, not knowing how to explain it. \"It's weird.\"\n\nMiranda smirked and raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by her assistant's professional opinion.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\nAndy swallowed hard, not expecting to be put in such a position. She honestly didn't expect Miranda to be asking for reasons as to why she didn't like the dress so much.\n\n\"If you don't like something, you have to be able to explain why in this industry. People won't accept just a simple 'no.' They need to know where your decision is coming from if you want them to not make the same mistake again.\" Miranda added and moved back, visiting the dress again.\n\nAndy absorbed every word, taking advantage of the fact that Miranda was clearly in the mood to impart some knowledge, but she couldn't help but notice, that;\n\n\"You never explain your decisions.\"\n\nMiranda stopped going through the dresses and looked at her, a sly smile on her lips.\n\nAndy thought that she didn't blame her at all. The woman had built such a reputation for herself that she didn't have to explain anything; people listened to her and followed her blindly because they knew Miranda wouldn't mislead them.\n\nShe was very impressed by that. Who wouldn't? For people to have such trust in your decision to never even think of questioning them was the level of professional success Andy desired.\n\n\"The dress, Andrea. Why didn't you like it?\" Miranda ignored her comment and put one hand on her hip, the other lightly leaning on the row of hanging dresses.\n\n\"I-, well I guess I just didn't think the colour would suit me?\" She answered uncertainly, slightly afraid of Miranda's reaction.\n\nHere she was, apparently choosing a dress for Andy herself, and she didn't like it.\n\n\"Are you telling me or asking?\"\n\nAndy cleared her throat and rubbed her hands on her pants, suddenly feeling how sweaty her palms were. Was this some kind of test?\n\n\"Okay, umm, well-, the colour is odd, and I don't like the fact that the waistline is not emphasized. Plus the patterns on the front seem a little awkward to me, and I prefer things that are symmetrical and a little simpler.\"\n\nMiranda hummed, thought for a moment, and then nodded.\n\n\"So what would you like?\"\n\n\"I like classics.\" She shrugged and smiled shyly, feeling that she understood what Miranda was doing.\n\n\"Really, Andrea, one would think that you've already worn every Chanel dress that exists. Karl should start paying you for it.\"\n\nAndy laughed shortly and with a sudden burst of courage, she walked up to Miranda and stood next to her, touching some of the dresses.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be Chanel.\" She shrugged, and then an idea came to her mind, and honestly nothing was stopping her, so... \"What would you like to see me in?\"\n\nShe turned towards Miranda to look at her, and she was eating up the sight of Miranda biting her lower lip, just barely, and her intense gaze. If she was surprised by the sudden forwardness from Andy, she didn't show it.\n\nThen she moved back two steps away and her eyes went roaming around Andy's entire body.\n\n\"That will work.\" She mumbled and Andy, proud of herself, followed her when Miranda went to the next row of hangers.\n\nShe moved a few dresses around but very quickly found what she was looking for and pulled out a dress walked over to Andy and held it under her neck like the previous one, this time her hand was directly touching her skin.\n\n\"Hold it.\" She said, her eyes completely focused on the dress, and Andy was rather grateful for it because otherwise, Miranda might've felt how fast her heart was beating. \"It's Dior, Fall collection 2003. Galliano is brilliant at elevating the simplest of the silhouettes.\"\n\nAndy couldn't look away from her. She generally loved watching Miranda, but when the woman was at work, focusing directly on clothes instead of filling out piles of papers, a completely different energy emanated from her. She spoke about these things with a passion that was not normally so visible and her eyes shimmered every time. Andy appreciated every moment she could spend seeing Miranda when she was in her element. It was the best proof of how much she loved what she did.\n\n\"The material is very smooth to the touch and reflects light beautifully. It looks very tight, but you won't have a problem putting it on. Your waist will be emphasized by the slight wrinkles, right here. \"\n\nShe almost completely forgot how to breathe, because Miranda took a step closer and grabbed the dress on both sides and held it to Andy's body, stretching the material slightly. Miranda wasn't looking at her face, her eyes completely focused on Andy's hips.\n\nThen she looked up, apparently realizing that Andy hadn't given any feedback and it was at this moment when Miranda also realized how close they stood to each other, and she inhaled slowly and deeply through her nose.\n\nAndy swallowed hard, afraid to even blink, not to miss a single second of Miranda's expression, which was most likely the first time she had forgotten what she was talking about. She completely forgot where they were and the memory of the first time she wanted to kiss her clouded her mind. In reaction, she glanced at Miranda's lips, who in response stopped breathing. Andy looked back up, and she knew that Miranda could see the need in her eyes.\n\nMaybe it was better this way. To just show her how she felt, instead of saying anything. Miranda was a woman of action. People were saying a lot of things but not many of them were fulfilling any promises made. If Andy wanted Miranda to believe that what she felt was honest, she had to prove it to her by taking action. She didn't even feel her head tilt forward slightly, but she was sure Miranda caught the movement because her pupils dilated.\n\nAndy, unfortunately, had forgotten that they weren't alone, even though they were standing in the very corner of the Closet, where no one dared to go, knowing that Miranda was there. The approaching quick footsteps fortunately happened to reach her, because in time she took a step back, ignoring Miranda's confused look, which for a moment seemed to agree with everything Andy had wanted to do earlier.\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm late, Miranda. What is it?\" Nigel asked as soon as he stepped out of the corner. He moved closer and stood next to her, to look at what Andy was wearing, examining it. \"Oh, I like it, we could pair it with the Miu Miu stilettos.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Miranda cleared her throat and looked away, and only her voice brought Andy back to reality. \"It should work.\"\n\nNigel went to get his shoes and Andy moved her dress away from her to look at it.\n\nIt was all white, reaching down to mid-thigh. It had thick straps that started from the sides of the dress, creating a kite shape. Her bust would be hugged and slightly exposed, especially with her Andy cup size.\n\n\"It's really beautiful.\" She said, thus gaining Miranda's attention.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, it is.\" Miranda agreed, but Andy, being focused on the dress, didn't notice, that the woman was looking at her only.\n\n\"What is the dress for?\" She asked later on when they were both in an elevator on their way to Miranda's meeting with Carla Fendi, who was in New York at the moment.\n\nMiranda glanced at the watch on her right wrist and put her glasses on her nose a moment before the door opened.\n\n\"You're going with me for dinner with the namesake of your cat.\" She explained, and Andy smiled slightly under her breath. \"He personally asked me to bring you.\"\n\nWith that she moved forward, leaving a shocked Andy behind. But she quickly came to her senses and caught up. They went outside, and she reached for the handle of the car door to open it for Miranda. She got in on the other side and buckled her seat belt, glancing at Roy, who greeted her with a nod in the reflection of the mirror.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'he asked for me'?\"\n\n\"Exactly that, Andrea,\" Miranda replied matter-of-factly and looked at her taking off her sunglasses again.\n\nShe looked suspicious.\n\nAndy after a moment of carefully observing the woman, took a breath into her lungs to ask another question, when Miranda sighed and looked at her with a raised eyebrow, previously rolling her eyes.\n\n\"I think he mentioned something about an assistant of mine that was rather... determined for my dinner with him to take place.\"\n\nAndy pressed her lips into a thin line to not smile. It was one of her achievements that she was most proud of. Until now, she did not know what possessed her to crash Karl Lagerfeld's private lunch to convince him to change his schedule. It was worthy of putting it into her resume.\n\n\"I'm sure she had good intentions,\" Andy replied and turned her head the other way, although it did not escape her attention how Miranda snorted silently.\n\nAndy really liked those peaceful moments with her. She always did, and it wasn't caused only by Andy's developing feelings. In a way, she always had this weird connection with Miranda. Since day one, for some reason she came back even after hearing the inevitable 'that's all'. She came back and stayed above the surface, despite her ignorance and lack of any actual investment in her work. Miranda let her stay.\n\nFor Andy, in some weird way, now, it seemed almost a natural progression. When she looked again at Miranda who was doing something on her phone with glasses on the tip of her nose and squinting trying to read something on the small screen, she couldn't imagine herself not feeling the way she felt now for her. These were the little things she enjoyed seeing in Miranda that others ignored, being too uptight and focused on what she represented instead of who she really was.\n\nMany people have said that Miranda's entire life was Runway and nothing else. They were wrong, and it was so obvious, and for some reason, people just wouldn't see the difference. Andy knew that for the magazine Miranda was irreplaceable. She was the main pillar that had made Runway what it was now. That didn't mean it went both ways.\n\nYes, Miranda had a high opinion of herself and was a bit narcissistic and sometimes selfish, but when Andy thought about it, those traits didn't even bother her. They made Miranda who she was, and she liked her exactly as she was. There were no changes necessary. Maybe that's why Andy was so mad at Nate at the beginning for how much he wanted to change her.\n\nShe was angry at herself for leaving her newly acquired book at work the day before. She hadn't found it yet, and she was sure that a flower that meant admiration and devotion would be one of the prettiest."
