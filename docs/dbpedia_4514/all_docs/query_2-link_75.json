The platform gave it a qualifying theatrical release in New York ahead of its digital release at the end of June.\n\nNews of Austria’s submission followed hot-on-the heels of Ireland’s announcement that it is submitting Irish-language Sundance title Kneecap.\n\nUnder the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rules for its 97th Academy Awards, Best International Feature Film submissions must have been theatrically released in their home country after November 1, 2023, and no later than September 30, 2024 for at least seven consecutive days.\n\nThe deadline for submission is 5 p.m. PT on October 2, 2024. The 97th Academy Awards ceremony will take place on March 2, 2025.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nBerlin Film Festival 2024: Award Ceremony, Film Premieres & Red Carpet Gallery\n\nSundance Film Festival 2024 Photos: Award Ceremony, Film Premieres & Parties Gallery\n\nSundance Film Festival U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize Winners Through The Years - Photo Gallery"
