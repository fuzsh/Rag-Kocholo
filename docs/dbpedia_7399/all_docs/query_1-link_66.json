        "text": "The flower is torn at the heart\n\nIts fragrance befriends the breeze\n\nWho can tell who destroyed it?\n\nWe have spent this evening under sentence\n\nNo one has to go on this journey\n\nI can still turn round, if you want\n\nEvery street in this city is asleep\n\nIt's my turn to stay awake\n\nIn the uncertain view of this evening\n\nThe whole thing wavers\n\nHow can we honour our union\n\nWhen my heart is gripped by fear of separation\n\nMy heart desires above all\n\nThat we make this evening ours\n\nShare this poem"
