        "text": "Words have always been as life to me; such a thing which one adores, relishes and becomes a mad lover of. But the words clothed with the blood of betrayal have stained the gleaming fabric of my belief and have taken my madness to believe in them away. Being called a rose and being trained like a thorn, not anymore! Deciphering life at 2:21 AM with the gentle rain gracing the thirst-stricken boundaries of my house, my inner voice utters; deceiving with words must be their charm but deciphering their words should be yours. Take the plunge and don’t be a prey to words which are not backed up by actions and doings. Be aware the next time you are being called a rose. You know what to do! 😉\n\nThe ones who have gone through my previous post ‘Deciphering life…(1)’ must be aware that while deciphering life, I also decipher some favorite Urdu couplets to English translation. The place is again Panjpeer Rocks where not only birds sing but life too. Hope you find the cure through these couplets.\n\nآؤ خوابوں کی باندھ کر آنکھیں\n\nدور جنگل میں چھوڑ آتے ہیں\n\nLet us blindfold our dreams\n\nand leave them in the jungle\n\nدھیان کے آتش دان میں ناصر\n\nبجھے دنوں کا ڈھیر پڑا ہے\n\nA furnace of thoughts, Nasir\n\nHolds the heap of the bygone days\n\nPoet: Nasir Kazmi\n\nوقت کی قید میں زندگی ہے مگر\n\nچند گھڑیاں یہی ہیں جو آزاد ہیں\n\nA prisoner of time this life is\n\nOnly a few moments to live by freely\n\nPoet: Fayyaz Hashmi\n\nکون سیکھا ہے صرف باتوں سے\n\nسب کو اک حادثہ ضروری ہے\n\nWho understands life with just pieces of advice\n\nEveryone needs a happenstance themselves\n\nصرف اس شوق میں پوچھی ہیں ہزاروں باتیں\n\nمیں تیرا حسن تیرے حسنِ بیاں تک دیکھوں\n\nI have asked a thousand things only to revel in\n\nYour beauty and the magnificence of your speech\n\nPoet: Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi\n\nوقت کی چند ساعتیں ساغر\n\nلوٹ آئیں تو کیا تماشا ہو۔۔۔\n\nIf only some moments return to life again, Saghar\n\nWhat a delightful treachery will they cause\n\nPoet: Saghar Siddiqui\n\nعادتاً تم نے کر دیے وعدے\n\nعادتاً ہم نے اعتبار کیا۔۔۔\n\nOut of sheer habit, you made a promise\n\nAnd similarly, habitually, I trusted you\n\nPoet: Gulzar\n\nP.S: Only those credits have been given which I am sure of.

Like a lover who takes pleasure in writing a love letter to the beloved, I take pleasure in writing a letter to the soul. Nature is my soul.\n\nLike the dewdrops remain with petals, serenity with spring and a silver lining with clouds; nature remains with me as soul with body. While deciphering life, I have tried to blend poetry with nature; the best love letter in the making! These shots have been taken at the place called ‘Panjpeer’ near Kahuta in Rawalpindi district, Pakistan.\n\nHere is a collection of a few favorite pieces of Urdu poetry along with a loose English translation.\n\nرات پھیلی ہے تیرے سرمئی آنچل کی طرح\n\nچاند نکلا ہے تجھے ڈھونڈنے پاگل کی طرح\n\nThe night intensifies like your dark apparel\n\nThe moon embarks a deep struggle to find you\n\nPoet: Kaleem Usmani\n\nوہ بے وفا ہے تو کیا مت کہو برا اس کو\n\nکہ جو ہوا سو ہوا خوش رکھے خدا اس کو\n\nنظر نہ آئے تو اس کی تلاش میں رہنا\n\nکہیں ملے تو پلٹ کر نہ دیکھنا اس کو\n\nDo not call him callous even if he is a deserter\n\nMay he find happiness beside all deception\n\nBe in his quest if he is out of sight but\n\nBe oblivion if ever an encounter occurs\n\nPoet: Naseer Turabi\n\nیہ جو ہم ہیں نہ احساس میں جلتے ہوئے لوگ\n\nہم زمیں زاد نہ ہوتے تو ستارے ہوتے\n\nDrenched in the fiery feelings, we are\n\nlike the stars if not human-like\n\nسفر ختم نہ ہو تو مشکل اور\n\nختم ہو جائے تو اور مشکل\n\nAn expedition coupled with difficulties is terrible\n\nBut no expedition is even more terrible\n\nعمر رائیگاں کردی تب یہ بات مانی ہے\n\nموت اور محبت کی ایک ہی کہانی ہے\n\nBeing wasteful with life, consequently, I learn\n\nLove and death are synonymous to each other\n\nPoet: Noshi Gilani\n\nبھیگے رستے، ہلکی برفباری ، گہری دُھند\n\nآج کا موسم ، دل کے موسم جیسا ہے\n\nMisty means, beguiled snowfall, abyssal haze\n\nThe heart is as heavy as the weather today\n\nP.S: Only those credits have been given which I am sure of.
