Roopa, a beautiful young village belle is much loved by the villagers of Chandanpur. Chandanpur celebrates a huge Mela every year and this year they invite a minister (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to inaugurate it. In an assassination attempt that follows, a blood-carting massacre takes place. Chandanpur is devastated and Roopa’s family gets wiped out. She vows revenge. Into her life enter two men, the gregarious Kishen and volatile Shankar. Kishen is a nautankiwala who dreams of making it big in life, while Shankar, a truck driver, is more cynical and practical. Roopa’s entry into the lives of these men causes much upheaval in their inter-personal relationship. How do Kishen & Shankar help Roopa in her quest for revenge? How they bring about a revolution by their courage and conviction from the crux of the film “MELA”.\n\nThis product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.
