        "text": "Noshi Gilani, a former academic from the Bahawalpur University, settled in San Francisco, USA in 1995. She moved to Australia after her marriage to Saeed Khan, an Australia-based Urdu poet in 2008. The couple lives in Sydney, Australia.\n\nHer experience of living in USA is notably reflected in many of her poems. She has expressed the sensibilities of the diaspora in her poems which also reflect her sense of female identity and introduce a new revolution against the restraints on creative writers in Pakistani society. Gilani co-founded the Urdu Academy of Australia (Sydney) in 2009. The Academy organises monthly sittings in Sydney to promote Urdu Poetry and literature.\n\nSome of her important works include ‘Aakhri Khawahish’, ‘Mohabatain Jab Shumar Karna’, ‘Udaas Hone ke Din Nahin’, ‘Pehla Lafz Mohabat Likha’, ‘Ay Mere Shareek-e-Risaal-e-Jaan’, ‘Hum Tera Intezaar Karte Rahe’, ‘Hawa Chupke se Kehti Hai, etc."
