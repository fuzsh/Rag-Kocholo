        "text": "Haaziriin-i-maHfil, aadaab 'arz hai.\n\nRecently janaab-i- Afzal Sahib and janaab-i-UVR Sahib had a little\n\ndiscussion on the terms \"accent-free\" Urdu and \"impeccable\" Urdu.\n\nPerhaps due to the fact that the thread title was \"Farida Rehman's\n\nDadra\" and not Urdu pronunciation, this discussion came to a sudden\n\nand unexpected end.\n\nI suspect what Afzal Sahib meant by \"accent-free\" Urdu is any Urdu\n\nwhich is spoken by a non-Urdu speaker that does not have any trace of\n\nthe speaker's own mother tongue influence, e.g. Bengali, Punjabi etc.\n\nBoth UVR Sahib and Afzal Sahib have rightly pointed out that there are\n\n\"accents\" within a particular language group itself. So, one can not\n\nreally have an accent free language since we may have Lucknow accent,\n\nDelhi accent, Hyderabad accent, Bareley accent and so on and so forth.\n\nAccent may change within a space of a few miles. One could have\n\nseperate accents in one family if one's mother and father are from\n\ndifferent parts of the country and the children may end up as having\n\nmixed accents!\n\nAs for impeccable Urdu, I believe, as Afzal Sahib has indicated, one\n\ncan speak without blemish even if one's mother tongue is not Urdu.\n\nThis may be achieved by sheer hard work, consciously striving for\n\nperfection and being absorbed in the linguistic and cultural\n\natmosphere of the language area.\n\nWhy the new generation has been unable to preserve the inheritence of\n\nits ancestors is not so straightforward to answer. It seems to be the\n\ngeneral norm that one can not match one's parents in the quality of\n\nlanguage. My knowledge of Punjabi is no where near as good as my\n\nparents' command of it. I have been influenced by Urdu and English and\n\nthis influence has been at the expence of Punjabi. The generation of\n\nthose people who spoke \"impeccable\" Urdu in Pakistani media, such as\n\nUbaidullah Baig, Qureshpur, Suraiya Bajiya, Anwar Maqsood, Qazi Wajid,\n\nJamshed Ansari are a dying breed. I doubt very much if their off-\n\nspring will speak anywhere near as good as their mothers and fathers.\n\nI believe there are not only educational and economic factors at play\n\nhere but also, and most importantly, cultural factors too. One needs\n\nto be absorbed in the Urdu linguistic environment in such a way that\n\none lives by breathing it. The new gas being breathed is of course\n\nEnglish and the result is that, on the whole, nah idhar ke rahe nah\n\nudhar ke(:\n\nOn a lighter note, here are a few videos, you may enjoy.\n\nHyderabi accent\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ow6eOH6p5L8 ...part 1\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=jVb8egzfYmk ....part 2\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm1gS_ip9F4 ....part 3\n\nBihari accent\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=MulJFLSxyfs .....part 1\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=rTbCzrsB2JI&feature=related ...part 2\n\nDelhi accent\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6b9WHp_SLio&feature=related ....part 1\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=DMBxRYNhSxk&feature=related ..part2\n\n\"impeccableUrdu\"\n\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=A-SoV5wM07U&amp;feature=related\n\nKHair-Khvaah,\n\nNaseer\n\nî—“\n\nNaseer Saheb,\n\nAt the outset, let me state that I have not yet seen the TouTube\n\nlinks furnished by you.\n\nThis issue arose out of a cursory remark by me, made en passant,\n\nthat \"the singer could be a Bengali lady\". Shri Joshi, who has\n\nlived in Calcutta for many years, seemed to disagree. He said :\n\n\"Mujhe to Bangladesh ki naheeN lagti haiN. Un ke pronunciation\n\nmen koi bhi Bengali jhalak naheeN dikhaee deti\".\n\nThereafter, I had cited the examples of some eminent people hailing\n\nfrom Bengal whose Urdu pronunciation was very good. It is also\n\ntrue that not every Bengali can speak Urdu or even hindi properly.\n\nA noteworthy example is the Indian playback singer Manna Dey who\n\ncan sing quite well, but his ordinary conversation in hindi\n\nis rather \"grating\", containing too many grammatical errors.\n\nHaving recapitulated the background, let me now state that \"good\",\n\n\"excellent\" and \"impeccable\" are merely adjectives and refer to\n\na speaker's purity of diction. And it isn't as if such \"pure\" or\n\neven \"impeccable\" pronunciation is something highly exalted or\n\nsublime or dignified or esoteric or recondite. There was a time,\n\nnot so long ago, when such pronunciation was quite commonplace in\n\nmany parts of India. Such may no longer be the case. And it is a\n\nstate of affairs that can be very distressing for people like me.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, there is little that we can do about\n\nit.\n\nUVR Saheb asked as to what exactly was \"impeccable\" pronunciation.\n\nI have tried to answer that question in the preceding paragraph.\n\nThere can be a hundred examples cited --- of people who speak\n\ncorrect Urdu. To make things simpler, we can think about people\n\nfrom the film and TV industry. Let us leave aside people like\n\nDilip Kumar. Pradeep Kumar, who was a Bengali, could speak excell-\n\nent Urdu. The late Rehman was another such. An old-time character\n\nactor Badri Prasad used to speak very good Urdu. Singers like Lata\n\nand Asha (who are Maharashtrians) spoke very good Urdu. Talat\n\nMehmood and Naushad Ali were \"native\" Urdu speakers. You have\n\ncorrectly cited the example of Qazi Wajid. You may perhaps\n\nrecall the name (and speaking style) of a Pakistani radio news -\n\nreader Shakeel Ahmed who used to be on the air 4/5 times a week\n\nin the late forties and early fifties.\n\nYou have rightly pointed out that people from the Punjab and\n\nBengal can have a distinct Punjabi or Bengali accent when they\n\nspeak Urdu. This is only to be expected. But even these people\n\ncan still pronounce Urdu words quite correctly. In Indian films,\n\nthese accents (Bengali and also South Indian) have been used often\n\nas a sort of laughter-evoking device. Which is not fair.\n\nIn some earlier thread, I had mentioned that Faarsi was still the\n\nlanguage preferred by the \"ashraaf\" as recently as the eighteenth\n\nand nineteenth century. Many poetic compilations about Urdu poets\n\n(Tazkiras) were written in Faarsi. Allama Shibli used to write\n\nmost of his letters in Faarsi. And he is a comparatively recent\n\nfigure (d. 1914). Today, you will be lucky to find even 2000\n\nFaarsi speakers in India. There is a medical term which you may\n\nhave come across in some other cotext : \"disuse atrophy\". That\n\nin fact is the malaise which is affecting Urdu today. If today's\n\nchildren cannot have opportunities to learn Urdu in schools, how\n\ncan they impart its knowledge to their progeny ? And thereby hangs\n\na tale. And a sad one, at that.\n\nAfzal\n\nî—“\n\nMukarramee Naseer Saheb,\n\nEssentially, we are in agreement on all points.\n\nThe crux of my viewpoint can be summarized as under :\n\n1. \"Good/impeccable\" pronunciation is not like the Holy Grail\n\nthat one has to spend a lifetime searching for it. It can be\n\nall around us. Though it is true that people who speak thus\n\nare a dwindling lot.\n\n2. If some people, whose mother tongue is different, learn to\n\nspeak faultless Urdu, it is an achievement to be greatly\n\nadmired and respected. I had cited some Bengali names in\n\nthis regard.\n\n3. Nobody should look down upon people whose Urdu pronunciation\n\nis not all that pure, or which is affected by other linguistic\n\ninfluences. If one was born in a family where Urdu was consi-\n\ndered a \"household servant (ghar ki kaneez ya ghar ki baaNdi\n\n-- a phrase of those days)\", it is an accident of birth.\n\n4. Even today, good speakers abound in our Film & TV industry.\n\nThere are a great many people of Bengali origin in the Indian\n\nTV industry, and I am always amazed to note the felicity with\n\nwhich they pronounce Urdu words and expressions.\n\nShakeel Ahmed and others of his period may have been there before\n\nyour time. But it was always a pleasure to hear his deep,\n\nsonorous, barrel-chested voice: \"Yeh Radio Pakistan hai, ab aap\n\nShakeel Ahmed ki zabaani KHabreN suniye\". Many people in those\n\ndays, young men as also school boys, used to imitate his style,\n\nmuch to everybody's amusement. His death some years ago was\n\nwidely mourned throughout the country. I believe he too was\n\nfrom Bengal (Calcutta). Other news-readers of the time (having\n\n\"impeccable\" pronunciation were Masood Taabish and Anwar Behzaad.\n\nPerhaps some of your elderly family members or other friends can\n\ntell you more about them.\n\nWhen the last Indian General Elections were to be held and\n\npolitical campaigning had reached a crescendo, the then Indian\n\nPrime Minister made a grandiose promise : \"We are going to\n\nappoint Two Crore Urdu teachers\". When told that he was going a\n\nlittle overboard, the figure was soon whittled down to Two Lakhs.\n\nNobody thought it fit to ask where were the schools which could\n\nabsorb such numbers, as everybody knew this was merely a well-\n\nworn election rhetoric. Now the next General Elections are round\n\nthe corner and, maybe, someone else would make similar empty\n\npromises.\n\nI had once quoted a Faani sher and likened the Urdu language to\n\nthe poet himself :\n\nMar mar ke ji raha hai Faani\n\nAllah re us ki saKHt~jaani\n\nAfzal\n\nî—“\n\n> >http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6b9WHp_SLio&feature=related....part 1\n\n> >http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=DMBxRYNhSxk&feature=related ..part2\n\n>\n\n> > \"impeccableUrdu\"\n\n>\n\n> >http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=A-SoV5wM07U&feature=related\n\nî—“\n\nNaseer and Afzal Khan saahibaan,\n\nTo Naseer saahib, at the outset, allow me to convey my thanks for\n\nstarting a separate thread on this topic.\n\nTo both of you, please allow me to state that there is a very\n\nsignificant difference, at least in my mind, between \"accent-free\"\n\ndiction and \"impeccable\" diction. In the Farida Rehman thread, Afzal\n\nsaahib's position seemed to be that these are one and the same thing.\n\nThat's why I was trying to chase down the roots of \"accent-free\".\n\nIn my opinion, \"impeccable\" diction signifies correctness in grammar\n\nand idiom (muhaawara) and, in the case of Urdu, a non-caricaturing way\n\nof pronouncing our \"special consonants\", viz., qaaf, Khe and\n\nGhayn[1]. I believe that a person can have, say, a Punjabi, Lucknowi\n\nor Hyderabadi accent, even a 'pronounced' one (pun unintended) and\n\nstill have impeccable pronunciation as described above. Personally\n\nspeaking, sometimes the accent is quite endearing -- take Mohammed\n\nRafi's for example.\n\n\"Accent free\" diction, in my mind, is something that does not really\n\nexist. I believe that it is possible to discern an accent in any\n\nspeech, and that it is possible for someone possessing the skills and\n\nexperience of Professor Higgins of \"My Fair Lady\"[2] to identify the\n\ngeographical origins of said accent (I hasten to add that I am not\n\npossessed of such skills).\n\nIn closing, I should say that I don't really have a fundamental\n\ndisagreement with anyone about what \"good\" (or \"great\") Urdu\n\npronunciation is.\n\n-UVR.\n\n[1] \"Impeccable\" diction, to me, however, does not include the\n\n'stilted' variety where special effort is made to imitate the Arabic\n\npronunciation of ALL Arabic consonants. You know the kind I mean.\n\n[2] I can't believe I made a reference to Pygmalion TWICE in the span\n\nof one week. And that too on ALUP!\n\nprem_...@yahoo.com wrote:\n\nî—“\n\nî—“\n\nJoshi Saheb,\n\nYou must have read Naseer Saheb's relpy. I am largely in agree-\n\nment with what he has written. There is only one point, where I\n\nfeel a little uneasy --- and that is the use of the term \"native\"\n\nUrdu speaker. It is possible that the two of us (i.e. Naseer\n\nSaheb and myself) may not mean the same thing by this term.\n\nInstead, we can use the terms \"literate\", \"semi-literate\" and\n\n\"illiterate\". One can safely assume that the speaker of \"good/\n\nimpeccable\" Urdu has to have some basic grounding in \"literary\"\n\nUrdu. In its absence, he will not make a good showing even if he\n\nis using \"scientific\" Urdu or \"religious\" Urdu or \"political\"\n\nUrdu.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the word \"native\" actually refers to\n\n\"birth\" --- a 'native' place is where a person is born and\n\nbrought up and where he learns the rudiments of his mother\n\ntongue. So we can have a Punjab-native person, a Bengal-\n\nnative person and a Hyderabad-native person. And these regions\n\ndo happen to have peculiarities associated with the \"native\"\n\npronunciation. A good Urdu speaker from these areas learns to\n\nsort of discard the local influences or oddities of pronun-\n\nciation. On the other hand, even a Lucknow-born \"semi-literate\"\n\nor \"illiterate\" person would not be able to have an \"impeccable\"\n\npronunciation.\n\nIn my various posts in this thread, I have tried to explain my\n\npoint of view --- and I am not necessarily looking for other\n\npeople to offer agreement therewith. Like most other issues,\n\nit is possible for people to have different opinions on this\n\nmatter too.\n\nLike Naseer Saheb, I too wouldn't like to use the terms Indian\n\nUrdu and Pakistani Urdu. In any case, the last (third) link\n\nprovided by you doesn't work. The links involving Ali Sardar\n\nJ'aafri do contain genuinely good Urdu.\n\nNaseer Saheb had cited the name of Qazi Wajid. His pronuncia-\n\ntion is definitely good and \"impeccable\". I don't know if he\n\nis still acting in Pakistani dramas.\n\nOne last thing. It used to be the case that \"baazaari\"\n\nwomen in the days of yore not only spoke excellent Urdu\n\nbut were so civilized and urbane that many youngsters from\n\ndecent (i.e. non-\"baazaari\" families) were sent to their\n\nkoThas for learning the nuances of the (Urdu) language and\n\nalso the subtleties of polite social behaviour.\n\nAfzal\n\nOn Jun 8, 3:50 pm, UVR <u...@hotmail.com> wrote:\n\n> To both of you, please allow me to state that there is a very\n\n> significant difference, at least in my mind, between \"accent-free\"\n\n> diction and \"impeccable\" diction.

From\n\nthe group that I am connected with, people who have never been to\n\nschool even for a day (i.e totally illiterate) pronounce KH, Gh, f and\n\nz without any difficulty. So, your example would be pronounced \"hak-i-\n\ntabliiGh\". I have tried to find a video in the same \"Loose Talk\"\n\nseries for a Punjabi speaker but have been unable to do so. The\n\nfollowing video in the \"Tanz-o-Mizah\" series from Zia Mohyiddin\n\nillustrates the speech pattern of two Punjabi speakers: Ziya Mohyiddin\n\nand Khalid Abbas Daar\". I would label the former as \"neutral\" and the\n\nlatter as distinctly Punjabi. By the way, the latter is hugely\n\ntalented artist in the field of music and drama. I have heard him\n\nimmitate \"classical\" singing when I thought his performance was\n\nincredibale. Zia Mohyiddin, of course, needs no introduction.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpvpqO7eqC8&amp;feature=related (Ziya\n\nMohyiddin Khalid Abbas Daar)\n\nBelow is taken from an earlier post of yours...\n\nYou have rightly pointed out that people from the Punjab and\n\nBengal can have a distinct Punjabi or Bengali accent when they\n\nspeak Urdu. This is only to be expected. But even these people\n\ncan still pronounce Urdu words quite correctly. In Indian\n\nfilms,\n\nthese accents (Bengali and also South Indian) have been used\n\noften\n\nas a sort of laughter-evoking device. Which is not fair.\n\nAgreed. Accent is part of that rainbow which illustrates the diversity\n\nof our peoples.\n\nIn some earlier thread, I had mentioned that Faarsi was still\n\nthe\n\nlanguage preferred by the \"ashraaf\" as recently as the\n\neighteenth\n\nand nineteenth century. Many poetic compilations about Urdu\n\npoets\n\n(Tazkiras) were written in Faarsi. Allama Shibli used to write\n\nmost of his letters in Faarsi. And he is a comparatively recent\n\nfigure (d. 1914). Today, you will be lucky to find even 2000\n\nFaarsi speakers in India.\n\nIqbal died in 1938 and he was probably the last if not one of the last\n\ntruly great Farsi poets of India.\n\nThere is a medical term which you may\n\nhave come across in some other cotext : \"disuse atrophy\". That\n\nin fact is the malaise which is affecting Urdu today. If\n\ntoday's\n\nchildren cannot have opportunities to learn Urdu in schools, how\n\ncan they impart its knowledge to their progeny ?

If I may say so, I find this a rather\n\nstrange and unnecessarily restrictive position to take.\n\nSince we have zero'ed in (unfortunately) on Punjabis, I think the time\n\nis opportune to ask you what you think of the accents of Mohammed Rafi\n\nand Ghulam Ali -- do they, or don't they, have 'impeccable'\n\npronunciation, as you define it? I think they do, never mind the\n\n(occasionally heavy) Punjabi lilt on their tongues. Vasmi saahib will\n\nprobably bear testament to the fact that Ahmed Faraz's Urdu is less\n\nPunjabi accented, and he makes no attempt to hide it (for example,\n\nwhen he is in a mushaa'ira). Nevertheless, I doubt there can be an\n\naccusation made that his Urdu is not 'sheen qaaf se durust'.\n\nElsewhere, you have alluded to the propensity of the 'average'\n\nHyderabadi (Deccani) Urdu speaker to use \"qHa\" where \"qa\" is intended\n\n(e.g., \"qHasam\" vs. \"qasam\"). I feel I should add two things -- (a)\n\nthe sound of the 'qH', when \"correctly\" pronounced, is slightly\n\ndifferent from that of the \"KH\" (as in Khushboo or Khudaa) and (b)\n\nthere do exist Hyderabadis who have good Urdu diction -- the poet\n\nKhwah-m-Khwah is one, Talat Aziz (notwithstanding his less than\n\nstellar musical skills), another.\n\nSpeaking of \"native\" accents, there is at least one from UP that\n\nsports a Re (peR, ghaRaa) which is best described as \"more retroflex\n\nthan retroflex itself!\" When these people say \"laRkaa\" or \"paRhnaa\",\n\nit's as if their tongues literally STRIKE their palate! But should\n\nthis one peculiarity disqualify their speech from deserving the\n\nimpeccability 'tamGha'?\n\nI guess what I am asking is whether it is possible that \"impeccable\"\n\nconstitutes not one but a (fairly wide) r-a-n-g-e of pronunciations.\n\nIs it really necessary for an Urdu speaker to (clinically) excise\n\nevery residue of his own linguistic identity from his diction in order\n\nto be able to be accepted as \"impeccable?\" There is a certain\n\n\"Khushboo\" in the \"miTTi\" of every part of our language's geography,\n\nand can any manner of speech not imbued with that fragrance be really\n\nenjoyable?\n\n-UVR.\n\nUVR wrote:\n\nî—“\n\nî—“\n\nUVR Saheb,\n\nDid I say that an Urdu speaker from the impugned geographical\n\nregions must necessarily \"divest\" himself of \"every trace\" of\n\nthe native flavour ? I don't think so. Instead of putting\n\nwords in my mouth, you should appreciate that I was using\n\nterms like \"rising above\" the local linguistic influences.\n\nI think I also emphasized that such local influences \"can\n\naffect\" correct/proper pronunciation. I didn't say that such\n\ninfluences would do so in ALL cases with ALL people. Here,\n\nlet me quote a couple of lines from an earlier post of mine :\n\n> I don't quite know whether people with Punjabi/Bengali/\n\n> Hyderabadi accents can usually speak correct, idiomatic, \"baa ~\n\n> mohaavara\", \"sheen~qaaf se durust\" Urdu as a matter of course.

I was always talking about oddities of accent found\n\nin three principal geographical regions. No single region was\n\nspecially targeted.\n\nI cited the example of the word \"KHasam\" only by way of illustra-\n\ntion. Any number of such examples can be quoted. For instance,\n\nwhen a TheTh Hyderabadi uses the word \"saheeh\", it sounds to my\n\naged ears as \"saee\". Truth to tell, there can't be two opinions\n\nabout the fact that people from Hyderabad do have a special\n\naccent.\n\nEngland is a far smaller country than India. Also, it doesn't\n\nhave the plethora of languages that flourish in India. But even\n\nthen, there exist in England a large number of accents, all\n\nrelated to a single language. As a pointer to this, let me quote\n\nthe following paragraph :\n\n*****************************\n\nThere is considerable variation within the accents of the\n\nEnglish. Notable geographical accents include West Country (the counties\n\nof Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and\n\nAvon (Bristol); North East England (Northumberland, County Durham,\n\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, Sunderland); North West England (Lancashire (with\n\nregional variants in Bolton, Manchester, Blackpool and Merseyside);\n\nYorkshire (which has differences between the North Riding of Yorkshire,\n\nWest Riding of Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire); West Midlands\n\n(The Black Country, Dudley, Birmingham and Wolverhampton); the accents\n\nof the counties comprising the East Midlands (Nottingham, Derby,\n\nLeicester) and East Anglia (Norfolk and Suffolk). Even within these\n\nbroad categories there are considerable differences in inflection and\n\npronunciation.\n\nThe arrival of large scale immigration to England has produced another\n\nlayer of regional accents that have merged with the accents of\n\nimmigrants. Such examples include London-Caribbean, West Yorkshire mixed\n\nwith Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi.\n\n*******************************\n\nMaybe, I can make it clearer by a reference to cricket personali-\n\nties. Australian cricketers and commentators have their own\n\naccent. I always find it difficult to understand what exactly\n\nRicky Ponting is saying. But he too is supposed to be speaking\n\nin English. Even amongst British commentators, there are consi-\n\nderable variations in pronunciation/accent. David Lloyd (he is\n\nfrom Lancashire) has an accent different from Geoff Boycott (who\n\nis from Yorkshire). West Indian commentators like Michael\n\nHolding have their own accents. The late commentator John Arlott\n\nhad what is known as the \"Hampshire Burr\". For me, the cricket\n\ncommentator I liked the best was Brian Johnston. I suppose his\n\nEnglish was what we call the BBC English or as near to it as\n\npossible.\n\nI suppose even people from the \"Urdu belt\" might have had special\n\nother linguistic influences that they managed to overcome while\n\ntrying to speak \"shus'ta\" Urdu. People like Kaifi Azmi, Firaaq\n\nGorakhpuri and Ali Sardar J'afri were, I daresay, quite capable\n\nof using the Bhojpuri dialect of the \"Ka kahat ho ?\" type.\n\nIn a reply to Naseer Saheb, and in this post too, I have used the\n\nword \"shus'ta\" Urdu. Briefly, I can say that this term encom-\n\npasses a combination of \"Standard English\" and \"Received\n\nPronunciation\". Just my opinion.\n\nLastly, I don't quite know why we are still belabouring this\n\nissue about the \"lab-o-lehja\" of SPOKEN Urdu, when we are not\n\nexperts in this field.\n\nSo it is high time we ended this discussion.\n\nAfzal\n\njanaab-i-UVR Sahib, aadaab 'arz hai.\n\nOn Jun 10, 5:52 am, UVR <u...@hotmail.com> wrote:\n\n> > > \"Accent free\" diction, in my mind, is something that does not really\n\n> > > exist.

You know I do not shy\n\naway from being \"adventurous\"!:)\n\nAlthough I myself have suggested that \"no-accent\" could be termed\n\n\"neutral\" accent, I shall make an attempt at explaining \"EXACTLY what\n\nmakes this not just another accent\".\n\nI regard myself a foreigner to Urdu as opposed to a \"native\" speaker\n\n(Afzal Sahib, I was merely emulating your choice of the word \"native\"\n\nand I believe we both mean one and the same thing, namely one whose\n\nmother-tongue is Urdu). If you were to ask me what in my opinion\n\nseperates a \"native\" accent, (not withstanding the fact that there are\n\nmany \"native\" accents) from this \"neutral\" accent, I am inclined to\n\nsay the following.\n\n1) That contains \"karaaraa qaaf\"\n\n2) And an even more karaaraa \"Re\"\n\n3) The \"ai\" diphthong pronounced \"fully\".\n\n4) A certain high tone at the end of the phrase/sentence.\n\nPerhaps here I am describing only one kind of \"native\" accent but, for\n\nme this is THE NATIVE accent. If a speech, which is otherwise\n\n\"impeccable\" is devoid of the above \"mirch-masaala\", then either we\n\ncan call it \"no-accent\" or a \"neutral\" accent or \"received\n\npronunciation\".

My answer was equally direct: I noticed that the clip\n\nshowed him sporting a particular kind of accent, and I pointed to what\n\nI noticed.\n\nWhere did I say that Iftikhar 'Arif's diction was, as a consequence,\n\nnot \"impeccable?\"\n\nSecondly, my opinon, as stated repeatedly in this thread, is that the\n\nmere presence of an accent DOES NOT disqualify a person from having\n\nstellar speech. Indeed, in my very first post on this thread, I had\n\nclearly indicated my opinion of what constitutes 'impeccable' speech.\n\nGiven this, I must admit I am at a loss to understand where you got\n\nthe impression that I was trying to cast 'Arif saahib's Urdu in less\n\nthan respectable light!\n\nI will be extremely grateful to you for an answer to this.\n\n> This does not seem to be a correct approach.

Just my opinion.\n\n>\n\nThis is almost exactly what I have said previously.\n\nWhereas, in previous posts, I think you have advocated the stance that\n\npeople who come from backgrounds with accented speech (Punjabi,\n\nBengali, Madrasi) should try to divest themselves of those accents, as\n\ncompletely as possible, as their accents are get in the way of \"pure\"\n\ndiction. In another post, you have said you'd prefer to use the\n\nphrase \"rise above\" (their accents) versus \"divest themselves of every\n\nvestige of\" (their accents). That's fine, although it must be said\n\nthat \"to rise above\" seems to imply that the native accents are an\n\nundesirable (or at least a limiting) influence on their Urdu, one that\n\nis liable to contaminate (or at least impede the \"shus'tafication\" of)\n\ntheir diction. I'm not able to see why \"rise above\" is a better\n\nalternative to \"get rid of.\"\n\nOnce again, my opinion on this (also one that I have stated\n\npreviously), is that accents impart a certain delectable charm to the\n\nUrdu of the various peoples who speak it and \"rising above\" is not\n\nnecessarily a critical activity. (This is not to say that you can say\n\n'fir', 'jindagi', 'sholaamat' etc. Those are WRONG pronunciations,\n\nnot 'accents'.)\n\n> I heard a ghazal in the voice of Noshi Gilani, a noted poetess.\n\n> She clearly enunciates one word as \"intasaab\".

I just don't get it.\n\nBut I must say I am rather disappointed at the turn this discussion\n\nhas taken -- for some reason I have been painted as a person who is\n\nout to \"keechaR uchhaalify on\" the Urdu of these speakers of shus'ta\n\nUrdu speakers, while myself not being a 'native' (or worse, while\n\nbeing a Delhi-wallah!).\n\n-UVR.\n\nUVR wrote:\n\nî—“\n\nUVR Saheb,\n\nAap ka GHussa (m'aaf keejiye, shikwa) sar~aaNkhon par......\n\nFirstly, I did not start this debate. It was Shri Prem Joshi\n\nwho first pointed out that Ms. Farida Rehman didn't seem to have\n\nany \"Bengali\" jhalak in her Urdu pronunciation. Thereafter, our\n\nworthy friend Naseer Saheb started this discussion about \"lab-o-\n\nlehja\" and I recall you lauded him for starting a separate\n\nthread.\n\nSecondly, none of us have claimed to possess the skills of Prof.\n\nHiggins or being experts in this field. We merely expressed our\n\nopinions and nothing more. And, in such cases, differences of\n\nopinion are bound to occur.\n\nThirdly, I have clearly explained my position that I do not\n\nregard any particular pronunciation style as being the best or\n\nsuperior to any other style. But I can't help it if there are\n\ncertain geographical regions which have specific \"accents\".\n\nFourthly, I never \"zeroed in\" on the Punjabi accent or any other\n\narea's accent. To do so would have been against my juridical\n\ntemperament. I was speaking about all three regions in general\n\nterms.\n\nFifthly, I have always emphasized that the discussion is essen-\n\ntially about SPOKEN Urdu, not written Urdu. There have been\n\nmany many eminent people from the three regions whose writings\n\ncan be classified as \"impeccable\". It is very much possible for\n\nan \"accented\" person to write perfectly sound \"baa~mohaawara\"\n\nUrdu, even if he does not have an \"impeccable\" style of pronun-\n\nciation.\n\nSixthly, I referred to England and the English language and\n\npointed out the multiplicity of different pronunciations and\n\naccents. In this context, I also talked about \"Standard\n\nEnglish\" and \"Received Pronunciation\", explaining the difference\n\nbetween the two.\n\nShri Prem Joshi may not be as erudite and learned a practitioner\n\nof Urdu as, say, your goodself and Naseer Saheb, but he seems to\n\nbe aware of what constitutes a \"Bengali jhalak\" in the enuncia-\n\ntion of Urdu words in a song.\n\nI have cited a few examples from Hyderabadi style pronunciation\n\nand many more can be cited. These cannot be called correct Urdu\n\nby any stretch of imagination, and the Hyderabadi inflexion is\n\nvery clearly discernible. When I was in school, I remember our\n\nteacher trying to explain the Hyderabadi style by the following\n\n\"verse\" :\n\nAmeeraaN ke baaGHaaN men aamaaN ke jhaaRaaN\n\nYou may perhaps have heard about a lady writer Waajida Tabassum,\n\nwho used to write short stories. She has immortalized the\n\nHyderabadi Urdu in her writings. Now, mangoes are no doubt very\n\nsweet and the \"soNdhi miTTi\" can also have a sweet smell but,\n\nwith due respect, these examples do not constitute correct/\n\nidiomatic/baa~mohaawara Urdu. I can narrate my own experience.\n\nIf I wanted to hire a cycle-rickshaw and asked the man about\n\nthe fare in my own \"nativet\" accent, I would be told a compara-\n\ntively high figure. But if I asked him in the local style, the\n\ncharge quoted was much more reasonable. In Bombay too, the\n\ncabbies used to be (and still are) sometimes unwilling to accept\n\na fare if you want to go in a particular direction. However, it\n\nwas my experience that if I asked a Punjabi/Sardar driver in the\n\nPunjabi accent (maiN~kya baadshaa-o etc.) he was much more like-\n\nly to take me where I wanted to go.\n\nAll that I have said is that if a particular \"accent\" affects\n\nthe correct pronunciation of words and expressions in a wide-\n\nranging sense, I would not call it \"shus'ta\" Urdu.\n\nRegarding Mr. Iftikhar 'Arif : My personal opinion about his\n\npronunciation style was as under :\n\n\"There should be no doubt about his being an \"ahl-e-zabaan\"\n\nand as a speaker of \"shus'ta\" Urdu.\"\n\nYour opinion about him :\n\n\"Where did I say that Iftikhar 'Arif's diction was, as a\n\nconsequence, not \"impeccable?\".\n\nSo, aren't we in agreement about him ?\n\nHe may pronounce \"subh\" in a particular style. But that is his\n\nown personal (or idiosyncratic) variant of this word. But can\n\nwe say that it represents a particular geographical/ethnic\n\ninfluence ? Assuming that he has lived in Sindh or Punjab for a\n\nlong time, can we say that his \"subh\" is essentially a Sindhi\n\nstyle or Punjabi style pronunciation ? Do all Sindhis or all\n\nPunjabis pronounce that word in that fashion without exception ?\n\nI talked about the poetess Noshi Gilani. She seems to pronounce\n\none word in a different (perhaps incorrect) way. But, overall,\n\nher style of pronunciations seems to be OK. Essentially, there-\n\nfore, there is no dichotomy about my position in the two cases.\n\nIt seems to me as if you are propounding a theory : If a person\n\nis pronouncing a word or two in a somewhat different manner,\n\nhe has an \"accent\". And if such a person's pronunciation is\n\n(otherwise) \"shus'ta\", it proves that even a person with a\n\n(pronounced) Punjabi/Hyderabad/Bengali accent can have a\n\nvery \"shus'ta\" pronunciation. If so, I beg to differ.\n\nIn my view, an \"accent\" covers the whole gamut of one's voca-\n\nbulary --- it is not limited to just a word or two. The\n\nYorkshire accent of Geoff Boycott can be seen (or rather\n\nheard) in his entire commentary, not just in a word or two.\n\nI have always made a clear distinction between \"an average\n\nDelhi-wallah\" and yourself. I have lived in Bombay for quite\n\na while. But, from a linguistic angle, would anyone call me\n\na Bombayite ? Strangely, whenever I shopped in Bombay's\n\nBhindi Bazaar and Mohammed Ali Road areas, the shopkeepers were\n\nwont to ask me : \"Saheb, aap Pakistan se aaye haiN ?\".\n\nAfzal"
