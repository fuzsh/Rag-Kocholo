        "text": "Personal life\n\nGilani was born in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. She studied at Bahawalpur University. She settled in San Francisco, USA in 1995. She moved to Australia after her marriage to Saeed Khan an Australian-based Urdu poet in 2008. The couple lives in Sydney,Australia.\n\nLiterary career\n\nThe candour and frankness of her poems is unusual for a woman writing in Urdu and she has gained a committed international audience, performing at large poetry gatherings in Pakistan, Australia, Canada and the USA. Unknown outside the Pakistani community, the translations mark her introduction to an English-speaking audience. She is a member of younger generation of female poets. Her experience of living in USA shows a notable impact on her significant number of poems. Living through Diaspora has increased the complexity of her poems and reinforced her sense of female identity and introduced a new revolution against restraint creative writers in Pakistani society.\n\nIn 2008, her some poetry work was translated into English and her poems were read in the UK, with the Poetry Translation Centre's World Poets' Tour. Gilani is also credited with co-translating the great Australian poet Les Murray into Urdu language. These works were published in Tasteer Literary magazine in Islamabad in its December 2011 edition. She hosted a tribute to folk singer Pathanay Khan, sponsored by the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA).\n\nGilani co-founded the Urdu Academy of Australia (Sydney) in 2009. The Academy organises monthly sittings in Sydney to promote Urdu Poetry and literature.,"
