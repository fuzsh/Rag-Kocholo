        "meta_description": "The fact that people who make it to their senior years can expect to live beyond the age of 80 means the average Supreme Court justice’s tenure also will be longer. The average tenure of justices is likely to increase from 17 years over the last century to 35 years over the next. This means turnover will be lower: an actuarial analysis reveals that there likely will be only another 25 appointees over the next 100 years, and that includes the two justices President Trump has already nominated. This is almost half the number of appointees in the previous century. Term limits on justices seem like an obvious solution, but in fact, they’ll increase the likelihood that a single president could have a disproportionate impact on the court. A better method is to have a term limit on the individual seats on the court. Under an approach where one seat comes up every four years during the second year of a presidential term, the number of new appointees over the next century would increase to 41.",
