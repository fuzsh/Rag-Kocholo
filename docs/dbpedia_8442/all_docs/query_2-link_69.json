        "text": "Judges are key to the fight for civil rights\n\nIn the U.S. judicial system, judges are tasked with presiding over trials and maintaining order. They also review whether or not there are any illegality issues per the evidence submitted. Judges provide instructions to juries prior to their deliberations and in the case of bench trials, judges must decide the facts of the case and make a ruling. Additionally, judges are also responsible for sentencing convicted criminal defendants. Most cases are heard and settled by a jury.\n\nAbout half of all judges are chosen by the president, including the Supreme Court justices and district judges. All are meant to ensure that everyone gets a fair shot at justice, no matter the color of their skin, their background, or their bank account.\n\nJudges in federal courts, from district courts up to the U.S. Supreme Court, have the final say on issues that have an effect on the lives of every American, including basic civil rights, religious freedoms, voting rights, affirmative action, and in some cases, life or death. They lead court proceedings, use established laws and guidance to determine sentencing, and rule on the constitutionality of various laws and legal precedents.\n\nWe must ensure that anyone who serves as a judge is fair minded. We should pay close attention to all judicial nominations. In recent years, a concentrated attempt has been made to pack the district and circuit courts with extreme, right-wing judges. Given the large number of cases whose ultimate determination is made at the District or Court of Appeals level (over 90%), and the fact that some people are put on the bench for life, we cannot afford to be complacent."
