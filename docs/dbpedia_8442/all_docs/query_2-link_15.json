Generally, the clips feature the first time a Justice spoke at oral argument or announced an opinion. Because of poor audio quality, however, sometimes we have substituted a clip from later in their first term.\n\nThanks to Pat Ward for providing the sound engineering and to Jerry Goldman for permission to use material from Oyez Project."
