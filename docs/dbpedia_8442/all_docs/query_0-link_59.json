        "text": "Chief Justices and Associate Justices are nominated by the President of the United States and are subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate. The nominees appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee in one or more hearings where they and any relevant witnesses are questioned. The committee then decides whether or not to refer the nomination to the full Senate for debate. The Senate then debates the nomination and generally will either vote to confirm or reject the nominee.\n\nJustices serve lifetime terms, excepting retirement, resignation, or removal from office via impeachment. Only one Justice, Samuel Chase, has ever been impeached. He was charged in 1804 and ultimately acquitted.\n\nTwelve nominees have been rejected by the Senate. The most well-known rejection in recent memory is Robert Bork, whose nomination was defeated by the largest margin in U.S. history (58-42) after an aggressive campaign against led him by Senator Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts. Because of this the word “bork” or “borking” has come to describe the defeat of a candidate for public office through an organized campaign of harsh criticism, defamation, and vilification.\n\nRejected Nominees\n\nName, Year (Nominating President) Final Vote John Rutledge, 1789 (George Washington) 14-10 Alexander Wolcott, 1811 (James Madison) 24-9 John Spencer, 1844 (John Tyler) 26-21 George Woodward, 1846 (James Polk) 29-20 Jeremiah Black, 1861 (James Buchanan) 26-25 Ebenezer Hoar, 1870 (Ulysses Grant) 33-24 William Hornblower, 1894 (Grover Cleveland) 30-24 Wheeler Peckham, 1894 (Grover Cleveland) 41-32 John Parker, 1930 (Herbert Hoover) 41-39 Clement Haynsworth, Jr., 1969 (Richard Nixon) 55-45 G. Harrold Carswell, 1970 (Richard Nixon) 51-45 Robert Bork, 1987 (Ronald Reagan) 58-42\n\nSeveral nominees have declined their nominations, two of them after having been confirmed by the Senate. John Jay declined a second nomination five years after retiring as Chief Justice in 1795 in order to serve as the second Governor of New York. The first Chief Justice, Jay was a Founding Father who served in numerous offices in the then-new government of the United States before retiring from politics completely in 1801.\n\nNominees Who Declined to Serve\n\nName, Year (Nominating President) Reason Robert Harrison, 1789 (George Washington) Poor health Levi Lincoln, Sr. , 1811 (James Madison) Poor health John Quincy Adams, 1811 (James Madison) Prior commitment as U.S. Minister to Russia William Smith, 1837 (Andrew Jackson) Declined after confirmation due to desire to comment freely on public affairs Roscoe Conkling, 1882 (Chester Arthur) Initially accepted, declined after confirmation for unspecified reasons\n\nMany nominees to the Court have had their nominations for either Associate Justice or Chief Justice fail due to withdrawal, postponement, or lack of action by the Senate. If a nomination is not withdrawn by the nominating President, it will expire and thus be considered withdrawn when the Congressional term expires if no action has been taken by the Senate by that time. And while a nominee cannot be appointed without the approval of the Senate, the Senate is under no obligation to take action for any nomination.\n\nFailed Nominees\n\nName, Year (Nominating President) Details John Crittenden, 1811 (John Quincy Adams) No action taken by Senate. Reuben Walworth, 1844 (John Tyler) Nominated three times, 1st and 3rd withdrawn, no action taken on 2nd. John Spencer, 1844 (John Tyler) Nominated twice, was rejected 1st and 2nd withdrawn. Edward King, 1844 (John Tyler) Nominated twice. 1st confirmation hearing postponed indefinitely, 2nd withdrawn. John Read, 1845 (John Tyler) No action taken by Senate. Edward Bradford, 1852 (Millard Fillmore) No action taken by Senate. George Badger, 1853 (Millard Fillmore) Confirmation hearing postponed indefinitely. William Micou, 1853 (Millard Fillmore) No action taken by Senate. Henry Stanbery, 1866 (Andrew Johnson) No action taken by Senate. George Williams, 1873* (Ulysses S. Grant) Nomination withdrawn. Caleb Cushing, 1874* (Ulysses S. Grant) Nomination withdrawn. William Hornblower, 1893 (Grover Cleveland) Nominated twice. No action on 1st, rejected on 2nd. Homer Thornberry, 1968 (Lyndon Johnson) Nominated to replace Associate Justice Fortas, who'd been nominated for Chief Justice. Nomination withdrawn after Fortas' nomination was withdrawn. Harriet Miers, 2005 (George W. Bush) Nomination withdrawn. Merrick Garland, 2016 (Barack Obama) Nomination was before the Senate without action for 293 days, longer than any nomination in U.S. history.\n\n*Nomination for Chief Justice, all other nominations for Associate Justice.\n\nThe official title of the Chief Justice is Chief Justice of the United States. Nominated by the President, they can either be current Associate Justices or not and their appointment is not related to their tenure on the Court. The Chief Justice is the presiding officer of the Court and the administrative head of the entire federal judiciary. Along with the regular duties of an Associate Justice the Chief Justice’s additional duties include overseeing the administration of the Court, presiding over arguments and private conferences, presiding over impeachment trials, writing and assigning the writing of opinions, appointing federal judges to the membership of various courts and panels, and overseeing the acquisition of books for the Law Library of the Library of Congress. They are also paid more than the Associate Justices.\n\nWhile the Chief Justice often administers the oath of office for the President of the United States, this is simply a tradition and not an official duty. Any federal judge, state judge, or notary public is allowed by law to administer the oath.\n\nChief Justices\n\nName (Appointing President) Tenure John Jay (George Washington) 1789-1795 (resigned) Books @ BPL John Rutledge (George Washington) 1795 (rejected by Congress) Books @ BPL Oliver Ellsworth (George Washington) 1796-1800 (resigned) Books @ BPL John Marshall (John Adams) 1801-1835 (died in office) Books @ BPL Roger B.

Each Justice, including the Chief Justice, has one vote in the decision of cases. Seniority among the Associate Justices is determined by length of tenure on the Court. If the Chief Justice is unable to carry out their duties or the office is vacant, the Associate Justice with the most seniority will take over.\n\nIn addition to deciding cases argued before the Court, each Justice is responsible for emergency applications and other matters from one or more of the thirteen circuits in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Chief Justice, by tradition, oversees the District of Columbia Circuit and the Federal Circuit. In the past, Justices were expected to travel to their assigned circuit courts to preside over cases.
