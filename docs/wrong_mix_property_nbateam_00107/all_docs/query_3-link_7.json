        "text": "As most basketball fans are probably aware, the NBA draft happened this week. And the Portland Trail Blazers ended up selecting Scoot Henderson with the third pick in the draft.\n\nIf you’re feeling betrayed, or fearing the end of an era, we have something for you: The Panicking Blazer Fan’s Guide to Drafting Scoot Henderson.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the draft, however, the Blazers were making headlines for another reason. It was revealed that a local billionaire was making offers to purchase the team...again. Can you guess who? That’s right, Phil Knight.\n\nBut that’s not today’s question in our latest installment of Hot Mic—a roving civics exam brought to you by WW and filmmaker Zave Payne."
