        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers just used their seventh-overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft to select UConn big man Donovan Clingan. Joe Cronin, the team’s general manager, dropped an encouraging review of the rookie whom they have monitored over a year ago.\n\nClingan, a 7’2″ center from Connecticut, had a standout college basketball career at UConn. As a freshman, he was named to the Big East All-Freshman team, and helped the Huskies win the 2023 NCAA championship. Although he was considered a potential 2023 NBA draft pick, Clingan decided to return to UConn for his sophomore season.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 campaign, Clingan entered the season as UConn’s starting center. He suffered a foot injury in December but returned in January, helping the Huskies win their second consecutive national championship. He averaged 13.0 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks per game during his sophomore campaign.\n\nAfter winning the NCAA title, Clingan declared for the 2024 NBA Draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility. He was selected seventh overall by the Portland Trail Blazers, marking the start of his professional career. Clingan’s combination of size, skill, and championship pedigree made him an intriguing prospect for the Blazers as they look to build a contending roster for the future.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers GM Joe Cronin Reveals Encouraging Review of Donovan Clingan After Drafting Him\n\nDuring the draft’s first night, the Trail Blazers used its seventh pick to select Clingan, even though they already have former number one pick Deandre Ayton and Robert Williams III in the lineup. In a tweet by Sean Highkin on X, general manager Cronin gave an interesting review on the big man and how he was always in their radar.\n\n“Joe Cronin: “Our scouts were all over him a year ago. They loved him as a freshman. When the lottery played out the way it did, we thought there might be a chance [he was there],” Highkin tweeted.\n\nAlong with the selection of Clingan, Portland also dealt a package headlined by point guard Malcolm Brogdon for Washington Wizards’ Deni Avdija. As a result, the Trail Blazers are going with a younger core and replenishing their draft capital in the coming years.\n\nIt remains to be seen who Clingan will into Portland’s backcourt rotation or if he can exceed expectations as a pro. In any case, a lot of Trail Blazers fans will be eager to see how he’ll shape up in the coming season.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
