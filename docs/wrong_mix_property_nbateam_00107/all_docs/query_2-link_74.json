The team honored him at a game against the Lakers on Sunday night.\n\nKATU’s Steve Dunn sat down Tuesday to discuss the life of the Trail Blazer's icon with Kerry Eggers, who literally wrote the book on Bill Schonely - called “Wherever You May Be: The Bill Schonely Story.”\n\nYou can watch the interview below:\n\nWe are waiting for word on when a public service will be held to honor Schonely.\n\nAt a game in the 1970's against the Lakers, Schonely coined his most famous phrase – “rip city.”"
