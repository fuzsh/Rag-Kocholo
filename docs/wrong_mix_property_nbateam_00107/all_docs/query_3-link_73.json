        "text": "After a long wait, much to the chagrin of University of Kentucky fans, the basketball universe is finally getting a taste of what Shaedon Sharpe can do on the floor.\n\nOnly six games into his NBA career, boy oh boy ... it’s mesmerizing to watch him play.\n\nRarely does a top-end lottery pick go under the radar, or contend for ‘biggest steal’ of the draft. However, Sharpe is certainly finding a way to make other franchises jealous based on the flashes we’ve seen.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers executed a masterful tank job down the stretch of last season, hoping to fall deep into the lottery and replenish some of the talent they lost through multiple trades – the Norman Powell and Robert Covington deal is still befuddling.\n\nThey selected Sharpe at No. 7 overall, right behind Detroit’s Jaden Ivey and Indiana’s Bennedict Mathurin. General Manager Joe Cronin bet on the upside by taking one of the youngest prospects in the draft and a player that hadn’t suited up since high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school early, Sharpe enrolled at the University of Kentucky in November 2021 to practice with the team and prepare for the 2022-23 college season. His plans changed last April when he opted to forgo his NCAA career and declare for the NBA Draft, likely after realizing he’d be a sure-fire lottery pick.\n\nSharpe’s summer league experience was supposed to be vital for his NBA preparation, but it was cut short after he suffered a small labrum tear in his left shoulder. While it didn’t require surgery, he was shut down and didn’t get back on the court until the Blazers started camp in late September.\n\nIt hasn’t taken long for Sharpe to become a crucial part of the rotation, impressing head coach Chauncey Billups and his teammates with how coachable and purely talented he is offensively.\n\nSharpe’s 56 points in 111 minutes equates to 18.6 on a per-36 minute rate, making him a spark plug off the bench. His usage rate (20.6%) is right in the sweet spot for what the Blazers need – someone to help keep the bench afloat to avoid droughts, but not someone that will hijack possessions from their hyper-efficient guards.\n\nWith Sharpe on the floor, Portland currently has a plus-8.4 net rating, the highest of all their rotation players. It’s not all because of his impact, as we’ll discuss later, but that’s encouraging for a kid still trying to learn the professional game.\n\nFriday night against the Rockets, Sharpe had the home crowd in a frenzy early in the second quarter. Within 23 seconds, he made a perfectly-timed slot cut to throw down a vicious one-handed slam and finished a powerful alley-oop in transition:\n\nThe Moda Center crowd isn’t used to seeing such athleticism. With all of the built-up hype surrounding Sharpe’s name, dating back to his college recruitment, this has to feel joyous for him. He preserved himself for the NBA, and it’s crystal clear he made the right decision by not spending one second on an NCAA court. When you can be a top-10 pick, work with professional trainers, and play in a system that actually values spacing, your development is fast-tracked.\n\nSharpe’s explosion is the main reason he’s such a tantalizing player. He can operate (and thrive) at multiple speeds. It doesn’t always have to be in transition for his talent to leap off the screen. He can break down his man with a live dribble in halfcourt situations, using his long strides and shiftiness to maneuver his way around experienced defenders. Portland needed another wing to toe the line between chaos and control, which is exactly what we’re seeing.\n\nBlazers’ veterans, including the cornerstone of the franchise, continue to praise their 19-year-old rookie after standout performances.\n\nSharpe has appeared in all six games for the Blazers, recently starting in place of Damian Lillard, who is nursing a calf strain. He has only played 18.5 minutes per game thus far, including a matchup with Phoenix that only saw him get 12 minutes of action. But after Friday’s performance versus Houston, shooting 7-of-12 from the field and providing a spark of energy during his 29 minutes, Sharpe can probably expect more time in the coming weeks.\n\nWith his unique combination of size, speed, and craftiness, Sharpe is already proving to be exactly what Portland needed alongside this core. Possessing a tight handle and shot-creation qualities at 6’6” automatically deems you a valuable prospect in the NBA. His length gives Lillard and Anfernee Simons an outlet on perimeter, protecting them against highly-aggressive coverages that want to make those two guards play in a crowd.\n\nFor years, Portland was searching for a wing they could trust to make open shots – or put the ball on the floor and create for others – once their primary guards were trapped. With so much attention focusing on Lillard and McCollum (then ultimately Simons), teams could afford to ‘sell out’ against those high ball-screens and force others to beat them. More often than not, Portland would fail to execute.\n\nWith Sharpe, they may have found a long-term answer to those issues.\n\nFor a player lacking experience in a competitive setting, his court awareness is already – forgive me – sharper than most rookies in this class. He’s only had one training camp at the pro level, yet his timing and manner in which he makes himself available would indicate he’s a five-year veteran.\n\nHis answer for a defender ball-watching and not treating him like a shooter is to cut into the lane. Whether it’s a backdoor slash to give Lillard another passing option or cut right down the middle to help Nurkić on a post-up, he knows where to be:\n\nSharpe’s underrated trait is how often he gets downhill and puts pressure on the rim. Despite showing real signs of dynamic shooting, that’s not his only skill. And he’s not settling for bad shots or disrupting the offense.\n\nWhen the defense shuts off the first Portland drive here, he could’ve easily caught the ball on the perimeter and taken a jumper at the end of the shot clock. Instead, he’s already cutting by the time Nurkić passes him the ball, attacking a lazy stance and challenging the opposing big at the rim:\n\nBut he does understand when it’s necessary to be stationary on the perimeter. Not every play will allow for a cut, particularly if the goal is to create adequate room for your teammates running pick-and-roll at the top.\n\nHis shooting stroke looks pure. Coming out of the draft, I’m not sure teams expected him to be this good of an outside shooter.\n\nSharpe is 6-of-14 from deep (42.9%) to begin his rookie season. Six of those attempts have come from the corners, as Portland is trying to leverage his shooting threat to space the floor around Lillard and Simons.\n\nHe’s receiving quality looks in that role, primarily because defenders – like all of us – are still learning about Sharpe and his capabilities. When there isn’t much tape on a prospect, especially one that couldn’t play in summer league, it’s virtually impossible to scout their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nEarly in the season, opposing defenses haven’t respected his shooting to the degree it warrants. If Sharpe is planted in the weakside corner (first clip below), the low-man defender has abandoned that corner on a few occasions. Portland is sniffing out when those defenders over-help, hitting Sharpe in his shooting pocket for the most desired shot in basketball:\n\nBillups and his coaching staff have installed more off-ball movement and misdirection sets to spice up the offense. There’s more flavor to what the Blazers do now, versus just straight high pick-and-roll with their two electric guards.\n\nIt appears Sharpe will be a vital part of that moving forward, and his shooting touch should unlock more creativity. But in the early stages of his career, it’s important to keep things simple and let him get a feel for the league.\n\nOn the first possession below, Portland initiates the play with a modified Split action between Simons and Sharpe. As Sharpe curls and relocates to the weakside, Simons attacks his man off the dribble and occupies Sharpe’s man (Harrison Barnes). Once this triggers rotations, the Blazers keep the ball moving and reverse it to the weakside. That’s when Sharpe can illustrate his skill-set with a pump fake and step-back three:\n\nThe second possession highlights his poise, creating a shot by letting his defender fly by and not getting rushed.\n\nOut of 44 total attempts, only 31.8% of his shot diet has come from beyond the arc. If the shooting is this legit, Billups and the coaching staff should urge him to get more audacious with those pull-ups, especially in games they are short-handed.\n\nWhen the defense runs him off the line and opens a gap on the floor, Sharpe is decisive with his drives. The ability to maintain his balance while showing off impressive footwork is how he’ll create windows like this:\n\nAs he gets more time with the team’s player development and weight trainers, he’ll become stronger and embrace contact on drives. But considering his footwork is already looking polished for a 19-year-old, his understanding of timing and angles will always make him an exceptional rim finisher.\n\nIt will also be a luxury for Portland to have another quick ball-handler that can run standard pick-and-roll, just to give Lillard and Simons a break from those responsibilities. Something I’ll be looking for as the season progresses is how often the Sharpe and Jusuf Nurkić two-man game is utilized.\n\nOn this baseline out-of-bounds set to open the Rockets game, Sharpe comes off a zipper cut to receive the ball. He flows directly into a ball-screen with Nurkić and attacks Houston’s drop coverage with a pull-up two:\n\nHe’s only 2-of-8 on mid-range jumpers to begin the year, but this is a look he’s already comfortable taking. With his burst and elevation on those shots, he should be able to thrive in the mid-range without defenders being able to get a great contest.\n\nA huge part of Sharpe’s development over the next handful of years will center on his playmaking vision out of those ball-screens. In theory, his size and length should open passing angles (to weakside shooters) that Lillard and Simons inherently don’t have in those situations. Sharpe could double as a spacing threat in lineups starving for shooting and a secondary creator in other lineups that might lack some north-to-south flow.\n\nSo far, 70 of his 111 minutes have been shared with Simons, with only 25 spent next to Lillard.\n\nAlthough it’s not a large sample, the Blazers’ bench units with the Sharpe-Simons combination have looked extremely productive. Portland is outscoring teams by 10.2 points per 100 possessions in those 70 minutes, which includes a stellar 95.2 defensive rating. Think about that – with Simons being a smaller guard that doesn’t have a great defensive reputation and Sharpe being a raw rookie talent (first-year players are rarely good on defense), the Blazers are still getting stops at an elite level.\n\nNow, whether or not that continues is a different story. It’s early. A lot could factor into their strong defensive start, including opponents missing wide-open looks.\n\nAs for Sharpe’s individual defense, there are going to be growing pains throughout the year. He shows terrific instincts at times, such as knowing when to ‘dig down’ on post-ups to provide help for his teammates. He’s already forced a couple of turnovers this year, notably against LeBron James, by rotating over for a late double and poking the ball loose. What he’ll have to tone down is how frequently he leaves his feet on pump-fakes, whether it’s on jumpers or defending a drive. But again, he’s not supposed to be a positive-impact defender at this stage. The Blazers know they have to be patient.\n\nWhen Sharpe was available at No. 7 in the draft, everything about him was a mystery. Within a few games, we’re seeing how well he fits in with a team ready to make some noise in the Western Conference."
