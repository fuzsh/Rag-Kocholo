        "text": "PORTLAND Ore. (KPTV) - A new device that started as a college project meant to give visually impaired people a new way to experience sporting events was tested at a recent Portland Trail Blazers game.\n\nJerred Mace is a recent graduate from the University of Washington with big dreams and the CEO of OneCourt.\n\n“Our goal is make live sports more accessible to everyone,” Mace said. “To see fans in the stadium with this device, it’s crazy. I can’t believe it.”\n\nThe device gives people the ability to “feel” the game.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nMace got the idea a couple of years ago to help people experience live sports through real-time vibrations sent to the surface of the device. During the Blazers game, this meant mirroring movements on the court – but the surface is adaptable to other sports.\n\n“Things sighted people take for granted,” Mace said. “I think it makes them feel like they’re not missing out on anything and they can participate in the same way as everyone else.”\n\nAntyush Bollini is the cofounder and COO of OneCourt.\n\n“That is what enables to take that live-action and turn it into something felt in real-time,” Bollini said. “They’re able to feel every dribble, every bounce. Every shot’s that taken.”\n\nEric Alaniz hasn’t been able to see well since he was a child and is one of those fans - a Rip City faithful.\n\n“I have an eye condition called optic nerve atrophy,” Alaniz said. “So, I’ve never felt how the actual court felt. It’s pretty cool.”\n\nMatthew Gardner is the Trail Blazers’ senior director of customer insights.\n\n“Anytime that we can bring innovation to fan accessibility and make Rip City more accessible to fans in Oregon and Southwest Washington, that’s what we’re going to do and this is just one step we can take to be heading in that direction, making sure all fans – no matter how you take in the game – can enjoy the in-game experience,” Gardner said.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nMace said the design process requires a lot feedback and “co-design.”\n\n“We need people in the trenches with us working on this problem so everyone can enjoy the game together,” Mace said.\n\nThe device uses a combination of cameras, sensors and computers to track player information and their location on the court. It relays that data to the device.\n\nThe Blazers are the first NBA team to work with OneCourt as a pilot program, but Mace hopes the tech will become a permanent feature in NBA arenas.\n\n“Going forward, hopefully, it’s something that can help more of our fans enjoy our games,” Gardner said."
