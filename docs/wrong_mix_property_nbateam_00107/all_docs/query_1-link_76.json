        "text": "They also became the latest to employ a coach who has faced accusations of violence against women.\n\nBillups was accused of rape in 1997. Though the former floor general never faced criminal charges from the incident, the violent nature of the survivor's account paired with Portland's treatment of the matter has ignited controversy across the NBA.\n\nThe more Portland's front office, and general manager Neil Olshey in particular, reveals about the process that went into selecting Billups, the more it appears the Trail Blazers were disingenuous about their intentions for Hammon, who is widely expected to become the NBA's first woman head coach.\n\nPortland had a diverse list of candidates for its head-coach vacancy\n\nAfter parting ways with eight-year head coach Terry Stotts, the Trail Blazers reportedly considered a wide array of candidates to lead the franchise. Among the contenders were Brooklyn Nets assistant Mike D'Antoni, San Antonio Spurs vice president of basketball operations Brent Barry, and South Carolina women's basketball head coach Dawn Staley in addition to Billups and Hammon, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania.\n\nOver the week that followed, that group whittled down to three — D'Antoni, Billups, and Hammon, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Then, the list shrunk again; Billups and Hammon were the apparent finalists.\n\nNo woman had ever reached the last round of an NBA head-coaching search before. Between her standing as a finalist and Portland's inclusion of other women in its initial search, the team seemed to have taken a revolutionary approach to its hiring process.\n\nIt was an exciting moment for women — until it wasn't.\n\nThe Blazers hired an alleged rapist in Chauncey Billups\n\nWhen Billups was a rookie with the Boston Celtics in 1997, a woman accused him and his teammate, Ron Mercer, of assaulting her in the home of a third player, Antoine Walker. The account of the incident that follows may be disturbing for some readers.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAccording to court documents, the accuser, a woman known in the lawsuit as Jane Doe, told police that in a bedroom in Walker's home, three men — Billups, Mercer, and Michael Irvin — subjected her to \"a series of sexual acts, including sexual intercourse, without her consent and despite her attempted resistance.\"\n\nAccording to details from Jeff Benedict's book \"Out of Bounds: Inside the NBA's Culture of Rape, Violence, and Crime\" shared in Sports Illustrated, Doe alleged that she awoke the following morning \"naked amid used condoms and condom wrappers littered across the floor,\" with one of Walker's friends beside her. She sought medical attention later that day, which \"revealed bruises about Doe's body and injuries to her throat, cervix, and rectum, and she was diagnosed as suffering from shock.\"\n\nBillups insists that he did not go to Walker's condo that night, though he told police at the time that he received consensual oral sex from Doe in his car, according to court documents. Billups never faced criminal charges, though he and Mercer settled a civil case with Doe for \"an undisclosed sum\" more than two years later, per the Washington Post.\n\n'You're just going to have to take our word'\n\nThough Jody Allen — the chair of the franchise — reportedly believed Hammon was the best option to become her team's next head coach, the Trail Blazers ultimately opted for Billups. That decision was fueled by Olshey, who has a close personal relationship with the five-time NBA All-Star and favored him for the job.\n\nIn hiring any man over Hammon, the Blazers were sure to disappoint some fans by passing up the opportunity to break men's professional sports' hardest glass ceiling. But by anointing the former Detroit Pistons standout as Portland's commander in chief, they did not merely disappoint fans; they ignored, insulted, and silenced many survivors of assault and women in general.\n\nOlshey failed to allay concerns about Billups at a press conference announcing his hiring. According to Bleacher Report's Sean Highkin, Olshey offered very little information about the franchise's investigation into the 1997 incident beyond that the findings \"corroborated Chauncey's recollection of the events, that nothing non-consensual happened.\"\n\n\"With all sincerity, and you have my word,\" Olshey said, per Highkin, adding, \"we took the allegations very seriously, and we treated them with the gravity that they deserve.\"\n\nWhen pressed for details about how the team conducted the investigation, Olshey responded, \"that's proprietary.\"\n\n\"You're just going to have to take our word that we hired an experienced firm that ran an investigation that gave us the results we already discussed,\" he added.\n\nBillups, for his part, acknowledged during the press conference that the 1997 incident \"has shaped my life in many different ways.\" But when The Athletic's Jason Quick asked the new head coach to elaborate, a member of the team's public relations staff shut him down.\n\nWas Becky Hammon a serious candidate or just a distraction?\n\nDuring the press conference, Olshey also managed to put his foot in his mouth while addressing Hammon's candidacy for the head coaching position.\n\n\"We obviously admire Becky. She did a great job,\" Olshey said. \"Making it as far as the owner in the process isn't easy. She made it all the way to the ownership level, which is an endorsement.\"\n\nIt certainly wasn't received that way, with sports commentators calling the comments \"patronizing\" and \"gross\" on Twitter.\n\nHammon has seven seasons of assistant coaching experience under one of the most highly-regarded play-callers in the league in Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich. She is qualified to receive a final-round interview and speak to the owners. It's laughable to imply that merely reaching that point in the process was an accomplishment for a coach of Hammon's caliber — or it would be, had it not been suggested by the man who failed to hire her.\n\nBillups, meanwhile, has spent less than a season sitting on the Los Angeles Clippers' bench as an assistant behind longtime pal Ty Lue. But Olshey didn't seem to see his limited experience as an issue.\n\n\"There were definitely people that had a bigger body of work, more things we could point to, and we interviewed some of them,\" Olshey said Tuesday. \"We were looking for somebody that I know has natural gravitas, leadership skills... and we were willing to bet on the upside, quite honestly, instead of kind of knowing the known.\"\n\nAt best, this is bad optics. At worst, the engagement with Hammon was exploitative.\n\nThe Trail Blazers may have included Hammon in their search in good faith. They may have hoped she could leverage her experience from her time in San Antonio and her years as a WNBA All-Star to push a promising Portland squad to new heights. And it's possible that in the course of their search, they came upon a better candidate — one with \"gravitas.\"\n\nBut I suspect there was a more Machiavellian plan set in motion; the franchise pretended to seriously consider Hammon and strung her along to divert attention away from the allegations against their true top choice.\n\nLeveraging the potential of breaking the NBA's gender barrier to appear progressive publicly while ignoring and burying rape claims privately would be a despicable move. But there are other aspects of what went down in Portland that add insult to injury. Undermining Hammon's credibility by using her candidacy as bait is repugnant. So too is ignoring the countless survivors and women who have spoken out against Billups as a viable coaching hire.\n\nBut perhaps worst of all was the Blazers' arrogant assumption that they'd get away with their ruse: infantilizing the most qualified among us, elevating a problematic, less deserving man, and expecting women to be too stupid to notice.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers offered no further comment."
