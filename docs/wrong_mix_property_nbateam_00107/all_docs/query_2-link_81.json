        "text": "I am the National NBA Writer for the Washington Post, where my professional basketball coverage includes the “Post Up” weekly newsletter. I am also the author of Bubbleball: Inside The NBA’s Fight To Save A Season, which documented my 93-day stay inside the NBA bubble at Disney World during the 2019-20 season. Bubbleball can be ordered on Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.\n\nAdditionally, I am the co-host of the independent “Greatest Of All Talk” NBA podcast.\n\nPrior to joining The Post in 2018, I was a Senior Writer for Sports Illustrated, where I covered the NBA for six years. Before joining SI in 2012, I spent two years at CBSSports.com while also covering the Portland Trail Blazers for seven seasons at Blazersedge.com.\n\nI began writing about basketball with the self-published “Draft Kevin Durant” blog in 2007. In the decade-plus since, I have covered 12 straight NBA Finals, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and the NBA Bubble in Disney World, in addition to the NBA Draft, the NBA’s All-Star Weekend, the NCAA Tournament, Las Vegas Summer League, and USA Basketball events, among others.\n\nI am a graduate of the Writing Seminars at The Johns Hopkins University and a member of the Professional Basketball Writers Association, the Washington Post Guild, JHU’s Second Decade Society, the National Audubon Society, and the California State Parks Foundation. I was born in Portland, Oregon, attended Beaverton High School, and spent most of my life in the Pacific Northwest. I moved to Los Angeles, my current home, in 2015.\n\nThanks for stopping by. I’d love to hear from you.\n\nEmail & Media Requests: benjamin.golliver@gmail.com\n\nTwitter: @BenGolliver\n\nInstagram: @Ben.Golliver"
