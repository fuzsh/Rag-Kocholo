        "text": "Clingan will not play in Sunday's Summer League finale against the Rockets, Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle reports.\n\nClingan will be shut down for the final game of Summer League and shift his focus to the regular season. The UConn product slightly underwhelmed offensively during Summer League but shined on the defensive end. His presence defensively could be enough to garner him playing time once the regular season begins.\n\nMcGowens recorded 20 points (5-12 FG, 2-6 3Pt, 8-8 FT), two rebounds and two assists over 21 minutes during Monday's 97-95 Summer League win over the 76ers.\n\nMcGowens put up a team-high 20 points and managed to get to the charity stripe with ease. The Nebraska product put pen to paper on a two-way contract Thursday and is seemingly eager to prove that he can handle rotation minutes, though he'll need to further distinguish himself amongst a crowded backcourt. Shaedon Sharpe (abdomen), Kris Murray, Rayan Rupert and Justin Minaya are also in the mix to secure backup guard minutes behind Anfernee Simons (knee).\n\nClingan totaled eight points (4-11 FG, 0-1 3Pt), 11 rebounds, five assists and three blocks in 25 minutes during Monday's 97-95 Summer League win over the 76ers.\n\nClingan had plenty of chances in the paint but was unable to capitalize, hitting only 36.4 percent of his tries from the field. However, he continues to be a menace on the defensive end, swatting away three shots after a five-block performance Saturday against San Antonio. Clingan's battle for playing time will continue Tuesday against the Wizards.\n\nClingan produced four points (1-8 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-4 FT), 13 rebounds, one assist, one steal and five blocks in 27 minutes during Saturday's 83-77 Summer League loss to the Spurs.\n\nAfter being expected by many to be drafted among the first few picks, Clingan fell to No. 7 in the 2024 NBA Draft, and the Trail Blazers happily scooped him up. Clingan has a 7-foot-2 frame and is an elite shot blocker, but his path to playing time won't be easy with the likes of Deandre Ayton and Robert Williams standing in his way early on.\n\nMcGowens agreed to a two-way contract with the Trail Blazers on Thursday, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports.\n\nMcGowens spent the first two seasons of his career with the Hornets, but he was let go by Charlotte over the weekend. After performing well late in the California Classic Summer League for the Hornets, he will land a deal with the Trail Blazers that will allow him to move easily between the G League and parent club.\n\nAyton posted 19 points (8-12 FG, 3-4 FT), nine rebounds, three assists and one steal across 38 minutes in the Bahamas' 96-85 win over Finland on Tuesday.\n\nAyton missed the final game of the NBA regular-season due to a back injury, but he will almost certainly be back in time for the start of the 2024-25 season. The 25-year-old appeared in only 55 games the entirety of last season due to a litany of injuries. These included knee and elbow tendinitis, a hand sprain and the aforementioned back injury. However, his play for the Bahamas bodes well for his healthy return to training camp and beyond.\n\nCui and the Trail Blazers agreed to an Exhibit 10 contract on June 27, Jonathan Givony of ESPN.com reports.\n\nCui is a graduate of the NBA Global Academy and will join the Trail Blazers for training camp where he will fight for a roster spot. Cui is a 6-foot-8 wing who most recently played for Guangzhou in the Chinese CBA.\n\nMinaya and the Trail Blazers agreed to a two-way contract Monday, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports.\n\nMinaya had a two-way contract with the Trail Blazers last season and made 34 appearances in the NBA. In those games, Minaya averaged 1.8 points and 1.6 rebounds in 11.2 minutes.\n\nThe Trail Blazers exercised Banton's $2.2 million team option for the 2024-25 season Saturday, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports.\n\nBanton will return to Portland for his first full season with the Trail Blazers after he was acquired from the Celtics in Feb. 8. While Portland shut down several key contributors with injuries late last season, the 24-year-old stepped into a focal role for Portland, averaging 16.7 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 0.9 steals over 30 contests with the club. Though he played well enough to stick around in Portland in 2024-25 and may even have earned himself a rotation spot, Banton is still expected to see a steep role reduction if the Trail Blazers have the likes of Jerami Grant (hamstring), Shaedon Sharpe (abdomen) and Anfernee Simons (knee) available to begin the upcoming season."
