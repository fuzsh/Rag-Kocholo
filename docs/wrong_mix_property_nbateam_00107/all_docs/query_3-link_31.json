        "text": "Last time I saw Giles playing he was playing great, even some threes, playing tough defense AND quick enough to really run the court on fast breaks or defensively. If we (Blazers) have those athletic abilities especially at the 4, why not give him some game time? He may be an X Factor for whatever time heâs in the game! Try him at the 4 alongside our centers and see what\n\nhappens. Am an old Blazers fan since 1976 and have coached youth bball for 11 years.\n\nLove my Blazers...hurts to see them loose and loose their Fire and intensity but I firmly believe THEY can turn it around. ð\n\nI would love to be able to watch the games but theyâre never on televisionâ¦ and our local radio\n\nStation KLBM hasnât played a game yet this year! They told me there must be a problem and theyâre looking into it. Still nothing. Please Trailblazer organizationâ¦. Get after them and get our Blazers on our station! With COVID guidelinesâ¦ itâs the only entertainment we get!\n\nWhat can I say Iâve been a Portland fan forever! Ever since I was 7 years old and I had NBA stickers on my door. That Trailblazer emblem stood out to me and itâs been #BlazerGang since then! I am now 29 years old and I am a die hard Blazer fan so for this app to be this distinctive and distinguished it left me no choice to write a great review on this app!!! Keep doing whatever it is that youâre doing! Thanks for such a great app! #RipCity #BlazerFanSince97â"
