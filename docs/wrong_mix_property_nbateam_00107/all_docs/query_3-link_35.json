        "text": "A professional basketball team based in Portland, Ore., the Trail Blazers play in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They have won three conference titles (1977, 1990, 1992) and one NBA championship (1977). Their name is an allusion to the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which ended near the site of present-day Portland.\n\nThe Trail Blazers joined the league as an expansion team in 1970. The Blazers—a nickname commonly used by fans and media—finished last in their division in five of their first six seasons. One bright spot during those years was the play of forward-center Sidney Wicks, who was drafted by the team in 1971 and was named an All-Star in each of his first four NBA seasons.\n\nPortland experienced a stunning turnaround in 1976–77, which began with the franchise posting its first winning record (49–33) during the regular season. In the play-offs, the Blazers—featuring a front line of Bill Walton and Maurice Lucas, along with guard Lionel Hollins—beat the Chicago Bulls, Denver Nuggets, and Los Angeles Lakers to advance to the NBA finals. There they faced the Philadelphia 76ers, who won the first two games of the series before Portland stormed back to win the final four games and capture the NBA title. The Trail Blazers returned to the play-offs in each of the next four seasons, but each year they lost in the opening round.\n\nAfter missing the postseason in 1981–82, the Blazers made it back to the play-offs in 1982–83, the first of 21 consecutive play-off appearances for the team. In 1983 the Trail Blazers drafted guard Clyde Drexler, who would go on to play 12 seasons with the team and become the franchise’s all-time leading scorer and rebounder. The Blazers continued their play-off streak but advanced past the first round of the postseason just once in Drexler’s first six seasons in Portland. In 1989–90 the Trail Blazers—led by Drexler, point guard Terry Porter, and forward Jerome Kersey—won their first three play-off series to capture the Western Conference title. In the NBA finals the team was defeated by the Detroit Pistons. In the following season the Blazers posted a franchise-best 63–19 record but were eliminated by the Lakers in the conference finals. In 1991–92 Portland once again advanced to the NBA finals but lost to the Chicago Bulls. The Blazers then lost in the first round of the play-offs in six straight seasons from 1992–93 to 1997–98. Portland broke its streak in 1998–99, advancing to the conference finals only to be swept by the San Antonio Spurs. The following season saw the Blazers again reach the conference finals, where they lost a close seven-game series to the Lakers.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, the Blazers’ play-off appearance streak came to an end. The franchise entered into a rebuilding period that reached its low point in a last-place divisional finish in 2005–06. Behind the play of All-Star guard Brandon Roy, the Trail Blazers returned to the postseason in 2008–09."
