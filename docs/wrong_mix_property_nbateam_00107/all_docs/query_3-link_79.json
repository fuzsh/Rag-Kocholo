        "text": "A lot people were wondering what Deandre Ayton will do in the upcoming season after the Portland Trail Blazers selected Donovan Clingan in the draft. This prompted head coach Chauncey Billups to reveal how the two will be played on the court.\n\nAyton was selected with the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns. In his rookie season, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Ayton has established himself as a dominant interior presence in the NBA, utilizing his size, athleticism, and developing skill set to excel on both ends of the floor.\n\nHe has been a key part of the Phoenix Suns’ resurgence and will look to continue his growth and help the Trail Blazers moving forward. Ayton’s combination of talent and potential makes him one of the league’s most promising young big men.\n\nClingan, on the other hand, is a two-time NCAA champion who played center for the UConn Huskies. During his time playing college basketball, the 7’2″ big man averaged 13.0 points on 64 percent shooting from the field, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game. He joins Ayton and Robert Williams II as the Trail Blazers’ big men for the upcoming season.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers Coach Chauncey Billups Reveals Plan for Deandre Ayton After Drafting Donovan Clingan\n\nDuring the previous offseason, Ayton was traded to Portland and was projected to be their center of the future. The arrival of Clingan has led people to believe that the former Suns star will be moved during the offseason. In an article by Jason Quick for The Athletic, Billups detailed how the two will be played on the court for the Trail Blazers.\n\n“Billups on Saturday told The Athletic he intends to experiment next season with the 7-foot Ayton at power forward and the 7-foot-2 Clingan at center. He also said he continues to encourage Ayton to expand his steady midrange jumper to perhaps incorporate a 3-point shot,” Quick wrote.\n\nAs it stands, Ayton is hitting 45 percent of his shots 10 to 16 feet away from the basket last season. That number went up to 55 percent 16 feet to around the three-point line. However, the big man only shot 10 percent from deep during the previous campaign.\n\nIf Ayton remains consistent with his jumper and eventually extend it beyond the three-point line, he and Clingan will be successful in sharing the court. Otherwise, the Trail Blazers may have to move either one of their centers to free up some space in the coming months.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
