        "text": "ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the Portland Trail Blazers are filing a protest with the league office to challenge the result of their 111-109 loss to the OKC Thunder on Tuesday.\n\nThe Trail Blazers held a 109-108 lead in the closing seconds when Malcolm Brogdon got double teamed at halfcourt and picked up his dribble. Portland head coach Chauncey Billups tried to call a timeout but was unable to get the referee's attention.\n\nPortland was then called for a double dribble, and Billups was assessed two technicals and ejected.\n\n\"The first technical foul was issued due to contact while Chauncey was trying to express himself to the official,\" referee crew chief Bill Kennedy explained in a pool report. \"He makes contact with the official two times, and the result is a technical foul.\n\n\"The second technical foul was assessed due to the fact that Chauncey aggressively now tries to follow and pursue the official after the first technical foul was assessed.\"\n\nMore: Where would OKC Thunder's Jalen Williams, Chet Holmgren go in re-do of 2022 NBA Draft?\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander made one of the two technical free throws to tie the game with 15.6 seconds remaining, and OKC got possession.\n\nJalen Williams then sank the game-winning shot with two seconds left.\n\n\"The referee in the slot position was refereeing the double team that was right in front of him,\" Kennedy said. \"(It) makes it difficult for, number one, to hear and, number two, to see a coach request a timeout behind him.\n\n\"He is taught to referee the play until completion, which a double dribble happens. And he correctly calls the double dribble, and then pursuant (to that) the technical fouls come forward.\"\n\nMore: Ranking the OKC Thunder's top 10 wins from the first half of the 2023-24 NBA season\n\nWhen asked about the situation after the game, Billups expressed his frustration.\n\n\"It's just a tough situation,\" Billups said. \"We've got timeouts. Referees, usually, are prepared for that instance and that situation. I'm at halfcourt trying to call a timeout. It's just a frustrating play. My guys played too hard for that.\"\n\nAccording to NBA rules, Portland must file a written protest within 48 hours of the end of the game. It must also submit a $10,000 check, which will be refunded if the protest is successful.\n\nBoth Portland and OKC would then have five days to submit their evidence. After that, NBA commissioner Adam Silver has five days to issue a ruling."
