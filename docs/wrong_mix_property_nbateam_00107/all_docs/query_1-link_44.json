        "text": "Former Portland Trail Blazers legend Bill Walton has died of cancer. He was 71.\n\nWalton rose to fame as part of the team that brought Portland its only NBA Championship in 1977.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers issued a statement Monday afternoon:\n\nBill Walton was a true legend — an extraordinary player, talented broadcaster, and vital part of the Blazers organization. His mastery of the game not only established him as one of the greatest centers in history, but also led the Blazers to a championship in 1977, where he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player. But Bill was so much more than basketball, he was larger than life. His upbeat and vibrant personality will forever be remembered and cherished, and he will be deeply missed by our organization, Rip City and all who experienced him. Our love and condolences go to Bill’s wife, Lori and his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris.”\n\nAs a Trail Blazer, Walton was a two-time NBA All-Star (1977 and 1978) and led the Blazers to the NBA Finals during the historic championship run in 1977. During his career, Walton earned the NBA Most Valuable Player award in 1978, was selected All-NBA First Team that same year and All-NBA Second Team in 1977. He was named to the All-Defensive Team in back-to-back seasons (1977 and 1978) and was awarded the NBA Finals MVP in 1977 for the Trail Blazers. Inducted as a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993, Walton was also named to the Top 50 and Top 75 Anniversary Teams. His number 32 jersey was retired by the Trail Blazers in 1989. As a broadcaster, he brought the game to life with rich and lively commentary that connected fans to the game in exciting and memorable ways. Off the court, Walton was a friend, father, husband and community leader.\n\n“Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, chair of the Portland Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.”\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement:\n\n“Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships, and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.\n\nBut what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear, and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy, and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke, and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.”\n\nWalton was a larger-than-life figure in Portland. On game days, he would often ride his bicycle over the Steel Bridge to the Memorial Coliseum.\n\nIn addition to bringing the Blazers their only title in 1977, Walton brought a title to Boston in 1986.\n\nWalton was the 1st pick in the 1974 NBA Draft, drafted by Portland following a historic career playing for legendary coach John Wooden at UCLA.\n\nHis most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship.\n\n“One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game.\n\nWooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”\n\nThey kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages.\n\nUCLA won the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship in Walton's first three seasons in Westwood.\n\nIn his senior year, UCLA lost to North Carolina State in the semi-finals, breaking UCLA's streak of seven consecutive titles.\n\nWalton continued to stay in the spotlight after leaving professional basketball.\n\nWalton was a fixture on basketball broadcasts on ESPN, Pac-12 Networks, and other outlets over the years. Walton won an Emmy for his work.\n\n“It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game, and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality.\n\n“As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden posted on X stating, \"Bill Walton brought #RipCity our greatest on-the-court thrills by leading the Trail Blazers on a magical run to the title in 1977. And for decades after his playing days, he brought an entire nation his good nature on life and basketball. I will miss my friend Bill dearly.\"\n\nMike Barrett, the former TV play-by-play broadcaster for the Portland Trail Blazers says Bill put Portland in the sports spotlight. “He still put us on the map, he put us in the national conversation. I still have Sports Illustrated covers with him on the cover, and I’m like ‘That’s our guy!’”\n\nWhen the Blazers won the NBA Championship in 1977, it was celebrated all over the Northwest. “Not only did he bring Portland a title, but he just set the northwest on fire. And it wasn’t just Portland, it was region-wide,\" Barrett stated.\n\n“Although he spent the vast majority of his life in California, countless Oregonians regarded him as one of us. Along with the leadership role he played in bringing the Blazers the 1977 championship and turning Portland into \"Rip City,\" Bill Walton will long be remembered for his humor, his compassion, and for the sheer joy in which he embraced life,” said Kerry Tymchuk, Executive Director, Oregon Historical Society.\n\nKevin Calabro, the current TV play-by-play broadcaster for the Blazers, worked with Bill Walton. Calabro says Walton's game would still dominate in today's NBA. “At his size, when he was right physically, getting up and down the floor, vision, anticipation, knowing the game, being selfless, being a great teammate, extraordinary passer, shot blocker, scorer, could play power at the rim, could face up and shoot.”"
