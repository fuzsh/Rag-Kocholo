        "text": "The Blazer’s Edge Mailbag handles questions about the Portland Trail Blazers, but sometimes we get adjacent questions about the site, our history, or what have you. A few have accumulated in our inbox, so let’s cover some!\n\nHi Dave,\n\nBeen reading BE for forever, this is totally random but is the email blazer sub or blazers ub, and what does that mean?\n\nCheers, Seth\n\nWay back when, when I first started writing online, I ended up corresponding with the guy who ran The Oregonian’s Blazers blog, Eric Marentette. We became friends. He ended up going on vacation or to a conference or whatever it is that Erics do when they’re not posting Blazers material. He asked if I wanted to fill in while he was gone. I said, “Sure!” It was an honor.\n\nPeople needed a way to correspond with me, so I created a Gmail and titled it “Blazer Sub”, since I was subbing in for Eric, coming off the bench. That reduced to “blazersub” in email parlance, and there you go. I’ve kept it ever since. I don’t think anybody, including me, foresaw what this all would become, but I like the callback to simpler times that the email handle provides.\n\nDave,\n\nI have a question you probably won’t use but I’m going to ask it anyway. What makes you such an expert? Why are you answering mail and saying you know?\n\nRyan\n\nPoint of order: I almost never claim I “know” things. This is sports. Few people really know. We all offer observations, insights, and opinions. That’s what I do, less as a way to advance my own viewpoint and more as a way to open up discussion, giving others permission to do the same.\n\nAs to why me, I’ll default to the same answer sex/relationship columnist Dan Savage gives when asked this question: because you asked. I don’t suppose there’s anything inherent in me by position or makeup that puts me in this seat. But dozens of people submit questions every week and I respond as best I can. Since you ask me to, I do. Thanks for affirming the need and expertise by asking your own!\n\nDear Dave,\n\nWhat’s your favorite Blazers team of all time? I’ll take your answer off air.\n\nCrystal\n\nIt’s the one that broke my heart hardest, the 1990-91 squad that lost in the Western Conference Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in six. The Blazers won 63 games that year, the best regular-season record in franchise history. They were coming off a trip to the 1990 NBA Finals, yet somehow improved their roster, adding Danny Ainge and Cliff Robinson to the bench mix. They had everything: a superstar in Clyde Drexler, a strong and seamless starting lineup—Terry Porter, Jerome Kersey, Buck Williams, and Kevin Duckworth—around him, a versatile and veteran-laden bench.\n\nThe Blazers were destined to win it all that year. Watching them play was an amazing experience, a true tour de force in athletic, smash-mouth basketball. But they lost Game 1 of the WCF against an aging Magic Johnson and the Lakers, then spent the rest of the series trying to recover. They trailed in the fourth in the deciding Game 6, mustering a huge rally to take it to the final possession. When Porter’s mostly-open jumper spilled off the rim and Magic threw the ball into the air as time expired, I was crushed. It was hard to believe a whole season of success could fall off a cliff like that.\n\nI’m not sure I’ve ever recovered, but I still remember that team fondly and wistfully.\n\nDave,\n\nDo you think anyone of the current team would make a Blazers all-time roster, even as an honorable mention?\n\nKyle D\n\nLet me twist the question somewhat. Jerami Grant could play in multiple eras because of his versatility. Anfernee Simons’ scoring would get him a look anywhere. Shaedon Sharpe would be considered a worthwhile project because of his athleticism. Those three could find a place on any Blazers team. After that it gets dicey, but Malcolm Brogdon and Matisse Thybulle would be welcome also.\n\nThat doesn’t mean any of the above five would qualify for an All-Time Blazers team. Grant would come the closest. There’s stiff competition at power forward. It’d be easier if he was considered a small forward.\n\nDave,\n\nHow’s your health?\n\nLindsay\n\nThanks for asking, and to all who have asked. I’m doing ok, all things considered. I’m working, working out, doing the normal stuff in life. I just need more rest than I did before my incident. My voice and stamina are stronger than they were a month ago, though. Hopefully they’ll keep getting stronger yet.\n\nThanks for all your questions! Feel free to send them to blazersub@gmail.com and we’ll get to as many as we can!"
