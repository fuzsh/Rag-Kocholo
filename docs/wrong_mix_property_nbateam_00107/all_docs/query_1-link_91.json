        "text": "Jerami Grant was considered one of the top wings available in free agency this offseason, but the Portland Trail Blazers, who he played for last season, have taken him off the board. The Blazers and Grant have agreed to a massive 5-year, $160 million deal, according to various reports. That gives Grant one of the most lucrative free agent contracts this offseason to date.\n\nLast season was Grant's first with Portland after being traded there from Detroit. He averaged 20.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists 0.8 blocks and 0.8 steals per game while a career high 40.1% from three point range. He pairs with Damien Lillard to form a solid one-two combo in a deep Western Conference. Lillard's future is a bit up in the air, however, as there has been speculation he could be traded this offseason.\n\nGrant entered the NBA in 2014 out of Syracuse after being drafted in the second round of the draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. He quickly proved he belonged, becoming a consistent part of the rotation over two plus seasons. He then went to Oklahoma City, where he continued to improve his overall game. After a strong 2018-19 season when he averaged over 13 points per game, Grant went to the Denver for a season where he became a key part of the Nuggets run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe following offseason, Grant signed a large free agent contract with the Pistons.\n\nSUPPORT ALL SYRACUSE\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO ALLSYRACUSE.COM NOW TO GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE INSIDER CONTENT\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE FREE ALL SYRACUSE NEWSLETTER TO GET THE LATEST ORANGE UPDATES SENT TO YOUR INBOX"
