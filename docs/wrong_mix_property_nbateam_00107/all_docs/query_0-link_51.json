        "text": "[BENEFIT] When the Portland Trail Blazers traded talented-'n'-troubled forward Zach Randolph to the equally troubled New York Knicks on draft day, it was widely viewed as a win-win move. The Blazer brass got big ups for making good on its promise to put character before the win-loss column, and New York got a statistical bonanza who can take some of the media scrutiny off of Isiah Thomas' own legal troubles and general craziness.\n\nWW would like to thank the fine people of New York for taking Z-Bo off of our hands, putting one of the final nails in the \"Jail Blazer\" coffin (the verdict is still out on Darius Miles). And to pay our respects—er, show our support—in time for the Blazers' pre-season home opener Wednesday against the Clippers , we'd like to send care packages comprising all your dusty Zach Randolph bobbleheads, jerseys, trading cards and (ahem) paraphernalia to a host of the Big Apple's sports bars (and hopefully, we'll sneak a few into the Garden itself). It's our way of saying thank you to the organization that's bold enough to put a headcase like Stephon Marbury and a man-child like Randolph on the same team . After we ship the goods, WW will keep you updated—both in print and on WWire—on the whereabouts and well-being of the Zach Pack. Good luck, Zach, and thank God for New York City .\n\n1. Write a personalized note to the people of New York City (keep it clean, folks).\n\n2. Put your Zach in the box. Put your note in the box. (Do not put your dick in the box.)\n\n3. Either drop the box off at WW' s offices, or send to ZACH-OFF! c/o Willamette Week, 2220 NW Quimby St., Portland, OR 97210. Please include your name and email address with your return address so we can update you on the progress of the pledge drive.\n\n4. We'll send the Zach Pack to New York City, where our special correspondent will distribute the items and photograph them with their new owners. The results will be updated in WW and on WWire for your viewing enjoyment.
