        "text": "Won't play Sunday\n\nClingan will be shut down for the final game of Summer League and shift his focus to the regular season. The Uconn product left some to be desired offensively during Summer League but shined on the defensive end. His presence defensively could be enough to garner him playing time come the regular season.\n\nAdds 20 points off bench\n\nMcGowens put up a team-high 20 points and managed to get to the charity stripe with ease. The Nebraska product put pen to paper on a two-way contract Thursday and is seemingly eager to prove that he can handle rotation minutes, though he'll need to further distinguish himself amongst a crowded backcourt. Shaedon Sharpe (abdomen), Kris Murray, Rayan Rupert and Justin Minaya are also in the mix to secure backup guard minutes behind Anfernee Simons (knee).\n\nFlirts with double-double\n\nClingan had plenty of chances in the paint but was unable to capitalize, hitting only 36.4 percent of his tries from the field. However, he continues to be a menace on the defensive end, swatting away three shots after a five-block performance Saturday against San Antonio. Clingan's battle for playing time will continue Tuesday against the Wizards."
