Selection from the collective of sports books Kerry Eggers has written:

• Civil War Rivalry (2014). This is the Bible of one of the nation’s most enduring college football rivalries. Eggers interviewed more than 250 players, coaches, officials and representatives from Oregon State and Oregon. This is 527 pages of perspective you’ll get nowhere else.

• Jail Blazers (2018). From the days of J.R. Rider and Rasheed Wallace, to Ruben Patterson and Bonzi Wells, to Zach Randolph and Darius Miles, this is the story of a talented but troubled group through a decade of infamy in the City of Roses.

• Jerome Kersey, Overcoming the Odds (2021) brings to life one of Portland’s true sports heroes. For 11 seasons, Kersey was a driving force for the Trail Blazers and for decades an important piece of the community, until his untimely death from a pulmonary embolism in 2015 at age 52.

• Wherever You May Be … Now: The Bill Schonely Story (2022) is an update from the 1998 biography of the legendary Trail Blazer broadcaster, covering the final 25 years of the life of perhaps the most popular figure in Blazer history.
