        "text": "Vin Diesel was born Mark Sinclair in Alameda County, California, along with his fraternal twin brother, Paul Vincent. He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists' housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\".\n\nHis first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.\n\nFollowing high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called Multi-Facial (1995), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. Multi-Facial (1995) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.\n\nAfterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, Strays (1997). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. Steven Spielberg was impressed by Multi-Facial (1995) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in Der Soldat James Ryan (1998). Multi-Facial (1995) earned Vin more work, when the director of Der Gigant aus dem All (1999) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film Pitch Black - Planet der Finsternis (2000). The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.\n\nSince then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx - Triple X (2002), Der Babynator (2005), Fast & Furious - Neues Modell. Originalteile. (2009), Fast & Furious Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), and Fast & Furious 7 (2015). He also voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and starred in the lower-budgeted courtroom drama Find Me Guilty - Der Mafiaprozess (2006), the latter directed by Sidney Lumet.\n\nWith an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.\n\nFreeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including \"Easy Reader\", \"Mel Mounds\" and \"Count Dracula\" on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade - Der Kontrabulle (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica - Revolte hinter Gittern (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Der Augenzeuge (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Glitzernder Asphalt (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.\n\nHis star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in Fegefeuer der Eitelkeiten (1990), Robin Hood - König der Diebe (1991), and Im Glanz der Sonne (1992). Freeman's next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood's de-mythologized western Erbarmungslos (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! - Kampf um Freiheit (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.\n\nMore strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in Die Verurteilten (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Sieben (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Außer Kontrolle (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in ...Denn zum küssen sind sie da (1997).\n\nFurther praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute's black comedy Nurse Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Im netz der spinne (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama Der Anschlag (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired Dreamcatcher (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Bruce Allmächtig (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy Hawaii Crime Story (2004).\n\n2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman's on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy's judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg's Krieg der Welten (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.\n\nRoles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Lucky Number Slevin (2006), a second go-round as God in Evan Allmächtig (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck's directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone - Kein Kinderspiel (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit Das Beste kommt zum Schluss (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Wanted (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008).\n\nIn 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director's true-life drama Invictus - Unbezwungen (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.\n\nRecently, Freeman appeared in R.E.D. - Älter. Härter. Besser. (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner's The Magic of Belle Isle - Ein verzauberter Sommer (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Die Unfassbaren - Now You See Me (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.\n\nMr. T was born Laurence Tureaud on 21 May 1952, in the rough south side ghetto of Chicago. He is the second to youngest of twelve children (he has four sisters and seven brothers) and grew up in the housing projects. His father, Nathaniel Tureaud, left when Laurence was 5, and his mother raised the family on $87 a month welfare in a three-room apartment. Mr. T's brothers encouraged him to build up his body in order to survive in the area; he has commented, \"If you think I'm big, you should see my brothers!\" His mother is a religious woman who has had a strong influence on him. He says, \"Any man who don't love his momma can't be no friend of mine.\" He was an average student in school. \"Most of the time,\" he says, \"I stared out the windows, just daydreaming. I didn't study much because I have a photographic memory.\" Apart from one spell between 5th and 7th grades when he went a little astray -- playing hooky, cursing, acting tough, being disrespectful -- he was a well-behaved child (he worried about how his mother would feel if he ended up in jail, and stayed out of trouble). He attended Dunbar Vocational High School. He was a football star, studied martial arts, and was three times city wrestling champion. He won a scholarship to play football at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, but he was thrown out after a year.\n\nHe was involved in the world of pro wrestling in 1985-86 and 1994-95. Was Hulk Hogan's tag team partner at the first WrestleMania (1985), defeating the team of Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper on March 31, 1985. His feud with Piper continued into WrestleMania 2 (1986), when he defeated Piper in a boxing match by disqualification. Mr. T returned to the WWF as a special guest referee in 1987, then disappeared from the wrestling world. Seven years later, he reappeared as a special referee for a Hogan-Ric Flair match, in October 1994. He stayed with Hogan for a few matches before returning to obscurity.\n\nKeith David is a classically trained actor, winning 3 Emmys out of 6 nominations as well as being nominated for a Tony award. He starred in the recently concluded TV series \"Greenleaf\" for Oprah Winfrey's OWN network. Upcoming films include \"Horizon Line\" with Allison Williams (\"Get Out\") and \"Black As Night,\" for Amazon.\n\nIn \"Greenleaf\" Keith portrayed 'Bishop James Greenleaf', the charismatic and God-fearing leader of the Calvary Fellowship and the patriarch of the family. The series followed the unscrupulous world of the Greenleaf family, their scandalous secrets and lies, and their sprawling Memphis megachurch. The series was praised for its push and pull dynamic, its hypocrisy, and its compelling characters. Keith's stellar performance was best stated by The Hollywood Reporter, \"... Keith David ...is perfectly cast as Bishop Greenleaf. Whether he's playing to the congregation at the altar or getting conspiratorial in a smaller venue, this is an unusually great and meaty role for David.\"\n\nOn the big screen, Keith co-starred with Chadwick Boseman in \"21 Bridges\". Prior credits include \"Night School\" with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish and \"Tales from the Hood 2\". Additional titles include the Academy award-winning films \"Crash\" and \"Platoon.\" He is widely recognized for appearing in the highly-acclaimed films Disney's \"The Princess and the Frog\", \"Requiem for a Dream\", \"Men at Work\", \"They Live\", \"There's Something About Mary\", and \"The Thing.\"\n\nOther recent TV credits include an upcoming appearance on \"Creepshow,\" \"NCIS: New Orleans\", \"Blackish,\" MacGyver\", and \"Fresh Off the Boat\".

Other appearances include the \"Halo\" series (games 2, 3, and 5), the \"Saint's Row\" series (games 1, 2, and 4), as well as the \"Mass Effect\" series (games 1,2, and 3).\n\nBorn and raised in New York by his parents Lester and Dolores, Keith became interested in the arts at a very young age. After appearing in his school's production of \"The Wizard of Oz\", he knew this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. He enrolled in New York's High School of the Performing Arts and continued his studies at The Juilliard School. After graduation, he was immediately hired by Joseph Papp as an understudy for the role of Tullus Aufidius in William Shakespeare's \"Coriolanus.\" His work with Mr. Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival launched his incredible career.\n\nIn addition to his versatile acting and voiceover work, Keith is also a remarkable singer. He's has been touring in 2 shows, \"Too Marvelous for Words\", in which he portrays the legendary singer Nat King Cole, and a show about the incredible Blues singer Joe Williams, \"Here's to Life.\"\n\nTwitter: @ImKeithDavid Instagram: @SilverThroat Facebook: @ImKeithDavid\n\nHarrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (Nidelman), a radio actress, and Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an actor turned advertising executive. His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Der Chef (1967), Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981).\n\nFour years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Der einzige Zeuge (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Die Stunde der Patrioten (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in Auf der Flucht (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nFord is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.\n\nOn March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.\n\nAn actor, comedian and writer, Seth Rogen has come a long way from doing stand-up comedy as a teen.\n\nRogen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Sandy (Belogus), a social worker, and Mark Rogen, who worked for non-profits. His father is American-born and his mother is Canadian. He is of Russian Jewish descent. He attended Vancouver Talmud Torah Elementary School and Point Grey Secondary School (although he dropped out of high school to move to Los Angeles) and was known for the stand-up comedy he performed at Camp Miriam, a Habonim Dror camp. At sixteen, Rogen placed second in the 1998 Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest.\n\nSoon after that he landed his first role in Judd Apatow's short-lived but well regarded TV series Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999), taking on the role of Ken Miller. Though the show only lasted one season, it was the launching pad for many careers, including Rogen, Apatow, James Franco, and Jason Segel. This early work sharpened Rogen's keen improvisational skills, which he's used on many projects since.\n\nFollowing Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999), he participated in a few unsuccessful television projects, and then joined the American television version of Da Ali G Show (2000) as a writer during its second and last season, along with his childhood friend and writing partner Evan Goldberg. The writing team received an Emmy nomination.

Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in The Untouchables: Die Unbestechlichen (1987), stealing the thunder from the movie's principal star Kevin Costner. Connery was polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man of the Century.\"\n\nThomas \"Sean\" Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. His mother, Euphemia Maclean, was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He also had a brother, Neil Connery, a plasterer in Edinburgh, who was eight years younger. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional soccer player or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent decisions.\n\nDie blinde Spinne (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it was followed by several made-for-TV movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) as well as guest appearances on TV series, and also films such as Duell am Steuer (1957), Herz ohne Hoffnung (1958), Das Geheimnis der verwunschenen Höhle (1959) and Die Peitsche (1961). In 1962 he appeared in Der längste Tag (1962) with a host of other stars.\n\nHis big breakthrough came in 1962 when he landed the role of secret agent James Bond in James Bond 007 jagt Dr. No (1962). He played James Bond in six more films: Liebesgrüße aus Moskau (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Feuerball (1965), Man lebt nur zweimal (1967), Diamantenfieber (1971) and Sag Niemals Nie (1983).\n\nAfter and during the success of the Bond films, he maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), Ein Haufen toller Hunde (1965), Mord im Orient-Express (1974), Der Mann, der König sein wollte (1975), Der Wind und der Löwe (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986), Der Name der Rose (1986), Indiana Jones und der letzte Kreuzzug (1989), Jagd auf Roter Oktober (1990), Die Wiege der Sonne (1993), The Rock: Fels der Entscheidung (1996), Forrester - Gefunden! (2000) and Die Liga der außergewöhnlichen Gentlemen (2003).\n\nSean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had Sean's only child, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963. The couple announced their separation in February 1971 and filed for divorce 2½ years later. Sean then dated Jill St. John, Lana Wood, Magda Konopka and Carole Mallory. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they stayed married, despite Sean's well-documented love affair with Lynsey de Paul in the late '80s. Sean had three stepchildren through his marriage to Micheline, who was one year his senior. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and Jason's ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Connery, in 1997.\n\nSean Connery died at the age of 90 on October 31, 2020, in Nassau, the Bahamas, where he resided for many years."
