        "text": "'Ralph Breaks the Internet,' the sequel to the 2012 Oscar-nominated video-game-inspired film, follows arcade game characters Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman). Here's a guide to the famous voice cast.\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet, the sequel to the 2012 Oscar-nominated video game film, follows arcade game characters Ralph (John C. Reilly) and Vanellope (Sarah Silverman). After Vanellope’s game Sugar Rush breaks down, the pair venture into the internet with the guidance of Yesss, a trend-aholic algorithm, to retrieve a replacement part.\n\nOn their quest, the characters encounter two entirely different universes, including everything from Disney princesses to droids from Star Wars. Making cameos are the original voices of the Disney princesses, including Jodi Benson (Ariel), Paige O'Hara (Belle), Linda Larkin (Jasmine), Irene Bedard (Pocahontas), Anika Noni Rose (Tiana), Mandy Moore (Rapunzel), Kelly Macdonald (Merida), Auli'i Cravalho (Moana) and Kristen Bell (Anna), along with Anthony Daniels, the voice of Star Wars' C-3PO.\n\nAhead of the movie's Nov. 21 theatrical release, find out more about the voice cast below.\n\nJohn C. Reilly\n\nWreck-It Ralph's very own John C. Reilly returns to his title role. In the sequel, Ralph is responsible for helping Vanellope fix her game — even if it means venturing into the unknown. In his last animated film, O'Reilly voiced the Sing character of Eddie the sheep. He most recently appeared on the big screen in The Sisters Brothers.\n\nSarah Silverman\n\nSilverman plays a girl whose Candy Land-styled race-car game, Sugar Rush, breaks down. She enlists Ralph and Yess’ help to retrieve a replacement part or risk staying broken forever.\n\nTaraji P. Henson\n\nThe film’s directors, Rich Moore and Phil Johnston, describe Yesss, voiced by Taraji P. Henson, as “an algorithm: the heart and soul of a trend making site called Buzzaholic.” The Empire star has previously voice acted in 2016’s Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade as Ethel and 2013’s Madly Madagascar as Okapi.\n\nJane Lynch\n\nLynch returns as Hero's Duty Sergeant Calhoun, in the Wreck-it Ralph sequel. Previously, her character was part of Litwak's Arcade's newest game. The Glee star recently appeared in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\n\nKristen Bell\n\nThe Wreck-It Ralph sequel will feature every Disney princess in hilarious scene. Pixar/Disney unveiled a scene at the Disney fan convention D23, which showed a brief preview of what happens when all the princesses come together. In the clip, Ralph and Vanellope travel through the Internet, and encounter the Oh My Disney fan site. Bell reprises her role as Anna from Frozen; a sequel is in the works.\n\nIdina Menzel\n\nPlaying her role from Frozen, Elsa, Menzel's character meets Vanellope, and like the other princesses, is inspired by her casual style. The group changes out of their dresses into T-shirts and shorts, with Elsa's wearing a Nike-inspired shirt with the words \"Just let it go.\"\n\nGal Gadot\n\nThe Wonder Woman breakout makes her big screen voice-acting debut as Shank, a competitive driver in an online racing game called \"Slaughter Race.\" Gadot is currently filming the sequel to Wonder Woman, co-starring Chris Pine and Kristen Wiig and directed by Patty Jenkins.\n\nMandy Moore\n\nThe This Is Us star returns to breathe life into Rapunzel and her signature golden locks. She's continually reprised the role since 2017 for Tangled: The Series after originating the rebellious princess in 2010.\n\nAuli'i Cravalho\n\nLong time, no see — Cravalho returns as Disney's youngest animated princess two years after Moana launched the Hawaiian teen's star as an actress and singer. She's set to appear next in Jordan Peele's sci-fi anthology series, Weird City, for YouTube.\n\nMing-Na Wen\n\nWen has reprised her role as Disney's Chinese warrior-princess for many projects in the past, including several video games and the children's series Sofia the First. She'll be back in Ralph Breaks the Internet, before Yifei Liu takes over the role for Disney's live-action remake of Mulan in 2020.\n\nAnika Noni Rose\n\nRose returns as Disney's first (and only) African-American princess, Tiana, who first appeared in 2009's homage to hand-drawn animation, The Princess and the Frog. She recently appeared in the crime comedy Assassination Nation alongside fellow Disney star Bella Thorne.\n\nIrene Bedard\n\nBedard stepped back into the recording booth to reprise Disney's first American princess, whom the studio introduced in 1995's Pocahontas. The Native American actress recently appeared in the second season of HBO's hit sci-fi western Westworld.\n\nJodi Benson\n\nThe little mermaid jumps out of the sea and into the web for Ralph Breaks the Internet. Some of Benson's other Disney voice-acting credits include The Little Mermaid 2, The Little Mermaid TV series and Toy Story 2, 3 and 4 as Barbie.\n\nPaige O'Hara\n\nLike Wen, O'Hara has lent her voice to several shorts and video games as Belle, the book-smart villager princess she originated in 1991's Beauty and the Beast. Before her reappearance in Ralph Breaks the Internet, Harry Potter alumna Emma Watson took over the role for Disney's 2017 live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nLinda Larkin\n\nLarkin reprises her role as the spunky Princess Jasmine, whom she originated in 1992's Aladdin. English actress Naomi Scott will take over for Larkin as Jasmine alongside Mena Massoud and Will Smith for Disney's live-action remake of Aladdin in 2019.\n\nKelly Macdonald\n\nMacdonald brings back her trademark Scottish dialect as the fiery, curly-haired Merida, Pixar's sole princess. Though Merida has been Macdonald's only voice role in her decades-long career, she recently starred alongside Irrfin Khan in Puzzle.\n\nAlan Tudyk\n\nVeteran voice actor Tudyk takes on the role of KnowsMore, an overzealous search engine who is always ready to autocomplete any question or thought. More of his voice efforts for Disney include playing breakout robot K-2S0 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Krei in the movie and series version of Big Hero 6.\n\nEd O'Neill\n\nThe Modern Family star reprises his role as Mr. Stan Litwak, owner of Litwak's Family Fun Center and Arcade. O'Neill previously lent his voice to another Disney sequel, Finding Dory, and will join Cravalho in Peele's Weird City.\n\nAlfred Molina\n\nMolina voices Double Dan, the heroes' key into the dark web, but Ralph Breaks the Internet isn't even the English actors' latest voice acting credit. He's also set to star alongside Rosario Dawson, James Marsden, Thomas Middleditch and more in Henchmen as Baron Blackout.\n\nAli Wong\n\nWong joins Gadot's Shank as another character in \"Slaughter Race.\" She currently stars in the ABC sitcom American Housewife as Doris.\n\nJack McBrayer\n\nMcBrayer also crosses over to the web to reprise his role as Fix-It Felix Jr., the hero of the similarly-titled video game world of Wreck-It Ralph. The serial voice actor recently worked on Bob's Burgers and Big Mouth.\n\nPeter Cullen\n\nCullen is reprising his role as the beloved Eeyore, the Hundred Acre Woods' most disheartened resident. He'll later reprise another of his most famous voice roles as Optimus Prime in the latest Transformers installment, Bumblebee, starring Hailee Steinfeld.\n\nJennifer Hale\n\nHale has taken over for the original voice of Cinderella, Ilene Woods, for several past Disney projects, including Sofia the First, House of Mouse, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True and Cinderella 3.\n\nRebecca Wisocky\n\nWinsocky represents the popular shopping site as Ebay Elayne. She recently played Mrs. Chandler in the Paramount series Heathers.\n\nKate Higgins\n\nIn addition to Ralph Breaks the Internet, Higgins has also voiced the sleeping beauty for Sofia the First and the Kinect Disneyland Adventures video game. Mary Costa originated the role for 1954's Sleeping Beauty, while Elle Fanning portrayed the curious blonde in Maleficent. Fanning will return as Aurora for 2020's Maleficent 2."
