        "text": "There's a huge amount of excitement for X-Men: The Animated Series follow-up X-Men '97, no great surprise when any sort of continuation was once little more than a pipe dream for fans of the original show.\n\nWith Marvel Studios seemingly cooling off on what once looked set to be an entire slate of animated projects, it's unclear when we'll actually get to watch the series, though we did recently get a big update on that front. Now, it's been followed by an apparent voice cast reveal.\n\nThis comes our way from a listing on the official U.S. Copyright Office website unearthed by Toonado.com.\n\nIt's no secret that not every original cast member will return, and a few key changes to the ensemble are clearly being made for any number of reasons.\n\nIf accurate, Ray Chase replaces Norm Spencer as Cyclops, Jennifer Hale takes over from Catherine Disher as Jean Grey, Lenore Zann returns as Rogue, George Buza is back as Beast, Alyson Court will be replaced by Holly Chou as Jubilee, Alison Sealy-Smith reprises the role of Storm, Cal Dodd comes back to his most famous role as Wolverine, AJ LoCascio is the new Gambit, and David Hemblen is being swapped out for Matthew Waterson as Magneto.\n\nIn terms of other noteworthy new additions, Christopher Britton has been tapped to lend his voice to Mister Sinister, while Gui Agustini will play Roberto da Costa, a.k.a. Sunspot.\n\nX-Men '97 Head Writer Beau DeMayo, who has been single-handedly keeping fans updated with the show's progress, recently took to Twitter to debunk the validity of that recent synopsis.\n\nHowever, he didn't comment on the rumoured premiere date or this voice cast, so we're assuming they're legitimate."
