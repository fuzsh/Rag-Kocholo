        "text": "He is famous as the flamboyant wrestler Hulk Hogan. But today, Terry Gene Bollea was a subdued and sad-faced man as he testified in the Federal trial of his former employer, Vincent K. McMahon, the wrestling promoter charged with illegally providing steroids to the wrestler-performers in his World Wrestling Federation.\n\nGone were the screaming yellow muscle T-shirt and the manic persona of the charismatic Hulkster. Mr. Bollea, his long blond hair spilling over the collar of a dark business suit, answered questions somberly as the Government tried to show that Mr. McMahon's Titan Sports Corporation had illicitly provided him with anabolic steroids. Defense lawyers, in cross-examination, sought to show that Mr. Bollea's nearly 14-year use of the drugs had been an entirely personal action. Steroid Use Called Common\n\nProsecutors have charged that Mr. McMahon provided steroids to his wrestlers to build up their physiques and thus make them more appealing to audiences.\n\nUnder questioning by a prosecutor, Sean O'Shea, Mr. Bollea, who was testifying under immunity from prosecution, said that steroid use \"was fairly common\" among wrestlers working for the World Wrestling Federation in the 1980's. He said that while touring for the W.W.F., he would call Emily Feinberg, then Mr. McMahon's executive secretary, \"and ask her to place an order for me with Dr. Zahorian.\" George T. Zahorian is a Harrisburg, Pa., physician who has been convicted of illegally distributing steroids and who has been named as an unindicted co-conspirator in this case. Paycheck, Mail and Steroids\n\nMr. Bollea, who now wrestles on a rival circuit, Ted Turner's Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling, said that when the steroid orders arrived at Titan Sports headquarters in Stamford, Conn., he would \"pick them up along with my paycheck, fan mail or whatever.\"\n\nMr. Bollea said that he took anabolic steroids not only for body building but \"to heal injuries, to keep on going,\" but that he no longer uses the drugs.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Laura A. Brevetti, a lawyer for Mr. McMahon, sought to demonstrate that the steroids were not used or distributed illicitly.\n\n\"I believed it was legal because I had a prescription for it,\" said Mr. Bollea. He also said that Mr. McMahon never ordered him to take steroids and never purchased any steroids for him.\n\nA crowd of nearly 80 people, about 30 of them forced to stand, filled the small audience section of Judge Jacob Mishler's courtroom here. Many of the onlookers were pro wrestling devotees."
