        "text": "#20: Dane Cook\n\nComedian Dane Cook took the world by storm in the 2000s as one of the first performers to use MySpace to gain fame. He had some chances before that to act opposite Dennis Rodman in the movie “Simon Sez,” which showed off his habit of overacting. With increased attention for his comedy specials, Cook naturally received more opportunities to star in films. These included comedies such as “Employee of the Month” and “Good Luck Chuck,” which largely were considered lackluster rom-coms. The actor didn’t attract the same attention as his stage performances and was somewhat constrained by the scripts he was given. Controversies including accusations of joke theft followed him into the 2010s when his screen parts started to slow down.\n\n#19: Kim Kardashian\n\nKim Kardashian and her family have spent over a decade on the cover of tabloids, often earning the title “famous for being famous.” Sometimes people forget that there was a time when she was more involved with making films. These might not have been substantial, but projects like “Disaster Movie” didn’t inspire confidence in her as a commanding screen presence. She’s also worked with Tyler Perry in “Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor.” It’s another supporting role that doesn’t sell the celebrity as a natural actor, instead proving she’s more uninterested in her performance style. Kardashian largely focuses on her business ventures these days and steers clear of cinematic pursuits.\n\n#18: Neil Breen\n\nHe doesn’t quite fit into the mainstream, but Neil Breen has amassed a fanbase all his own for some outrageous acting. Breen is actually an architect and his film work represent a passionate hobby that’s been realized over the course of several movies. His efforts have garnered terrible reviews and that’s putting it mildly. The performer certainly shows that he’s an amateur, never being able to sell any script or direct himself in a proper fashion. This doesn’t even count his productions which feature a wide array of ineffective elements such as poor editing, sound, and casting choices. All this is to say, the artist needs to be seen to be believed.\n\n#17: Quentin Tarantino\n\nQuentin Tarantino is arguably the most famous writer/director working today, creating cinema that blends entertaining dialogue with exciting genre elements. His talents as a filmmaker don’t necessarily carry over into the acting realm. While he has a history of performing in some of his movies, they’re largely supporting roles that distract audiences. He doesn’t fit in with the tough guys in “Reservoir Dogs” or add much to his masterpiece “Pulp Fiction” other than some awkward line deliveries. His turn as an Australian in “Django Unchained” is definitely his least effective performance, taking away from the enjoyable film’s final act. After completing the 2012 western, he’s avoided spending much time in front of the camera.\n\n#16: Tara Reid\n\nFollowing roles in movies like “The Big Lebowski,” Tara Reid first established herself as a star in the first entry of the “American Pie” series. She often finds herself in shallow parts that fail to set her apart from any number of actresses in her generation. Reid's appearance in the “Sharknado” series provides some laughs at her expense, especially when she gets the chance to fumble her way through an action sequence. Her film career did receive a small boost from the return of her Vicky character in “American Reunion.” There doesn’t seem to be a significant comeback in her immediate future, but she's taken to lower-budget movies in the meantime.\n\n#15: Jessica Alba\n\nJessica Alba was almost everywhere in the 2000s, appearing in films that spanned multiple genres and put her on Hollywood's A-list. The actress was part of two \"Fantastic Four\" entries that received mixed reviews, with her work as Susan Storm being an example of her blander than engaging efforts. Her role in the comedy \"The Love Guru\" might have been a critical low point for her career. It was a notable misfire all around, including the fact that Alba isn't really known for her comedic abilities. The actress finally looked beyond her film work and started a massively successful business called The Honest Company.\n\n#14: Rob Schneider\n\nFollowing his exit from \"Saturday Night Live,\" Rob Schneider has often appeared in many supporting roles in Adam Sandler comedies. He often plays goofy characters that don't necessarily deserve their own film. With Schneider's solo efforts, he’s attempted leading parts that feel unsubstantial and lacking in the hilarity department. “The Animal” taps into his primal side, but doesn't give him much of a chance to shine. His other films like “The Hot Chick” and “Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo” have aged poorly and feature the performer in mediocre scripts. Contemporaries like Sandler find a way to play characters for an entire movie, but Schneider has largely been unable to provide a compelling or truly likable performance on his own.\n\n#13: M. Night Shyamalan\n\nM. Night Shyamalan is known as one of the more gifted and imaginative filmmakers of the late 1990s and early 2000s. He's made a wide array of horror films and thrillers that have been greatly acclaimed and/or successful. Shyamalan also starred in a number of his projects, in roles that many people find distracting or downright bad. If there is a definitive part of his movies that people don't love, it ends up being one of his cameos that feel somewhat self-aggrandizing and take away from the larger production. The director keeps the small roles coming without an end in sight, but at least he avoids playing the main character.\n\n#12: Jean-Claude Van Damme\n\nNobody would argue that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't tough. The Belgian fighter clearly proved himself as an entertaining brawler in many films, although he never really established himself as a serious actor. There's nothing wrong with this fact, but it has produced some mediocre acting work from him. Movies such as \"Bloodsport\" don't exactly contain an award-winning performance. In over-the-top adventures such as \"Street Fighter,\" Van Damme feels right at home as a guy who is not bound by the method or technique of any kind. His projects might be exciting, but they never convince the audience that the star is all that emotionally invested in the story.\n\n#11: Jaden Smith\n\nJaden Smith started acting at a young age, starring alongside his father Will in films of all kinds. It’s fair to say that he was much younger and less in control of his career than other actors on this list. This doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s off the hook either, but he does enter into the nepotism debate. He’s playing a regular kid without any kind of spark in various movies that include the remake of “The Karate Kid.” Some of the efforts with his dad seem as if he was dragged along, not necessarily invested in the experience. Later work such as “After Earth” captures him as an awkward teenager in a project that asks too much of him.\n\n#10: Taylor Lautner\n\nStarring as Jacob in the “Twilight” films, Taylor Lautner went from a working actor to a teen heartthrob almost overnight. Lautner’s turn as the werewolf spanned several sequels that didn’t receive great reviews. He was essentially just a pawn in a soap opera, never taken seriously as an actor during the height of his success. The performer spent the remaining 2010s trying to break out from the stigma of the series, with a mix of rom-coms and action flicks. In “Abduction,” he attempted to break out of the teen idol status and mostly felt out of place in more of a thrilling setting. His place in Hollywood was uncertain after he was dubbed as a physical presence rather than a nuanced artist.\n\n#9: Madonna\n\nRising through the 1980s as a certified pop star, Madonna was a force to be reckoned with on the Billboard charts. She’s tried different roles in movies over the years from concerts to fictional films. The singer even played a performer in “Dick Tracy,” in a part that wasn’t a huge stretch for her. It’s especially difficult to be hugely famous in one medium and then be convincing in another. Projects like “Swept Away” are hard to watch without being painfully aware that the vocalist is super famous and trying to become a character. Even her cameo in “Die Another Day” functions more as a parody than any sort of serious film appearance.\n\n#8: Shaquille O’Neal\n\nShaquille O’Neal spent the 1990s and 2000s dominating in the NBA, winning multiple championship rings for teams like the Los Angeles Lakers. He also ventured into music and movies that received ridicule at the time. With few exceptions, his star vehicles like “Kazaam” felt like a poor showcase of his charisma. O’Neal has a natural ability and showmanship on the court that never translated to the screen. Regardless of the genre, the player felt out of place in everything from superhero films to Adam Sandler comedies. He makes occasional appearances to this day, but usually at his own expense in a self-aware parody of his acting abilities.\n\n#7: Jamie Kennedy\n\nTaking a wide range of supporting roles in the 1990s, Jamie Kennedy came to prominence as a comedian and comic relief character in many films. His most popular role arrived with his appearances in the “Scream” series. After leaving the horror franchise, Kennedy spent the 2000s exploring comedy with mixed results. It could be argued that his stock in Hollywood dropped with “Son of the Mask.” The sequel received terrible reviews and the actor seemed to be miscast in a poor continuation of “The Mask,” unable to match Jim Carrey’s original energy or likability. Some people enjoy his work in “Malibu’s Most Wanted,” but the performer never quite had the comedic gravitas of a leading man.\n\n#6: Hulk Hogan\n\nFor most wrestling fans, Hulk Hogan represents an entire era of entertainment with his wild personality. His appearances in movies are definitely not held to the same standard. Next to his brief role in “Rocky III,” most of his other work attempts to either put him up as an action hero or as a friend to small children. Unsurprisingly, his chaotic persona in the ring doesn’t always make for the greatest use on screen. It also doesn’t quite work when he plays some kind of unconventional babysitter. Hogan’s roles in “Mr. Nanny” and other 1990s movies come off as an attempt to pander to younger audiences.\n\n#5: Tom Green\n\nTom Green is a unique comedy figure that defies normal exclamation points, with some believing him to be a genius that inspired all kinds of alternate and anti-comedy icons in the 2000s. Others feel that he's a bizarre and off-putting presence in any of his films. Many of his harshest critics cite “Freddy Got Fingered” as the nail in the coffin for his viable film career. While it wasn't the end for Green, the gross-out comedy defies the limits of good taste and was provocative in a way that many people found to be negative. His particular brand of humor and aggressive techniques have made some friends and enemies out of many audience members.\n\n#4: Pauly Shore\n\nPauly Shore splashed onto the comedy scene in the early 1990s with a string of hit films. His entire persona revolved around a stoner/surfer motif that many people found to be one-note. Movies like “Bio-Dome” and “Encino Man” saw success in their day, but haven't really made much of an impact past their initial release. Shore has a personality that can be grating to some and hilarious to others. The performer uses a unique vocal cry and delivery which he employs for every single one of his projects, never veering too far from a similar setup of playing dumb characters.\n\n#3: Paris Hilton\n\nIn the 2000s, hotel heiress Paris Hilton became a widely-known celebrity. This led to her near-ubiquitous presence in the entertainment industry, including a somewhat unconventional film career. Hilton starred in the horror remake \"House of Wax,\" playing one of the many victims in a largely forgettable role. The main problem with her acting is that she has a monotone quality and doesn't seem very interested in the material. She also starred in one of the worst movies of the decade entitled \"The Hottie and the Nottie.\" It tried to present her as a version of the blonde stereotype with some offensive jokes thrown into the mix. Most people would argue that her singing career was much more engaging than anything she did on film.\n\n#2: Steven Seagal\n\nAlong with some questionable connections to Vladimir Putin, actor Steven Seagal has made a handful of mistakes in his cinematic career. He might just beat us up for writing this, but we're pretty sure he's been eclipsed by much better action stars at every turn. Some of his acting sounds like whispering in several scenes that will make you turn up the volume. When he's trying to fight, he doesn't seem to bring much energy to the sequences themselves. His arrogance allegedly extended to behind-the-scenes stories as many people have acknowledged him as a difficult collaborator.\n\n#1: Tommy Wiseau\n\nTommy Wiseau is the director, writer, and lead actor in \"The Room.\" He's also become a cult figure for his work on the film, which remains a midnight-movie staple around the US. Wiseau plays Johnny in a role that's full of eccentric acting choices. His line deliveries are the stuff of legend, making viewers question their own sanity during some scenes. He famously walks out onto the roof in a legendary line that includes an unbelievable non sequitur. The entire experience inspired a book by co-star Greg Sestero, which described the bizarre tale of working with the performer. It's clear from each individual set piece that the man is making the most unique choice he can at any given moment."
