        "text": "So somehow during this mess, Lil Paunchy’s mom opens a portal for the kid to surfboard to earth, landing in a pool in HOLLYWOOD. Following this, Marduke and Zeus make a bet that the kid can’t last four days in Burbank. After nearly a decade and a half watching garbage like this, I have zero doubt hilarity will ensue.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for Paunchy to meet up with Curtis, and the two become friends thanks to Paunchy telling a dog to give the kid his skateboard back. I’d go into more detail, but a glance at the counter says I still have over an hour to go in this movie. If you really feel the need to know more about how a chubby kid from Mount Olympus talks to dogs, get the movie yourself.\n\nInstead, let me introduce you to Curtis’ arch nemesis:\n\nYes, ladies and germs, the primary antagonist (well, mortal antagonist) on display today is none other than NICK HOGAN.\n\nOr to be more exact, SPIKY HAIR NICK HOGAN!\n\nThis film appears to be a landing spot for all the Hogans, as Linda and Brooke also show up in cameos as well. Brooke is a singer (of course), and Linda is an office skank who just hangs out being skanky.\n\nBut the center stage is reserved for Spiky Nick, who is pummeled in short order by Paunchy after his attempts to bully Curtis. In an effort to repay him for his efforts, Curtis allows Paunchy to move in with him and his mom, Robin Givens. Yes, as in the former wife of Mike Tyson. In the meantime, Paunchy communicates with his dad via…well…the crapper.\n\nAnd I’m so not kidding.\n\nWell, it’s appropriate if nothing else.\n\nSo the kids go to school, and of course the school is closing, because, well, that’s what always happens in these stupid movies. Paunchy, of course, winds up on the track and field team, throwing discuss, javelin, whatever. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that somehow this leads to a meet where the school can reopen, because, again, that’s what always happens in these stupid movies.\n\nAnd considering that Big Show materializes as the rival schools’ new track coach, I’m betting I’m on the right path.\n\nWe also get a subplot wherein we learn that Zeus’ wife is in cahoots with Marduke. They want to force Paunchy to use his sword, which will force him to stay there and Zeus will also be forced to move to Burbank. I’d go back and rewind to try to decipher how all this works, but I’m too entranced by the fact that we learn of this plot in a convenience store where Show is devouring copious amounts of microwave burritos and roller dogs.\n\nAgain, not kidding.\n\nNow that he is on earth, eventually Paunchy loses his strength. This leads to him getting beat up by Spiky Nick. Zeus shows up and tells Paunchy to come back to Mount Olympus.\n\nPaunchy looks sad (of course) and says no.\n\nThe counter says there’s still 34 minutes left.\n\nFor the record, I also look sad. Not as sad as Paunchy, but sad nevertheless.\n\nMeanwhile, Robin Givens discovers that Paunchy is, in fact, Lil Hercules thanks to, no joke, NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR. This in a movie released in 2008. If she says she’s using a Compuserve account, all will be forgiven. She gives his sword to her new beau, MISTER REYNOLDS. No, it is not me. I, did, however, quiver with fear when Marduke screamed his/my name, demands the sword in a parking lot.\n\nThis somehow leads to my poor namesake falling off a roof as Zeus shows up and looks on in a bored manner. Thanks a lot, Hulk. Here’s hoping you’ll show a bit more concern if you see THIS Mr. Reynolds falling from the top of a building.\n\nA parking lot battle ensues, as Zeus and Marduke throw each other into whatever dilapidated jalopies the producers of the film could find at the local junkyard. This doesn’t last long, though, as somehow we’re transported into an inferno scene and the gods charging at each other. And you know how that ends.\n\nYep.\n\nIn a gloppy, messy, CGI explosion.\n\nI can only imagine how glorious that would have looked in 3D.\n\nNot very glorious at all, I am wagering.\n\nBut that still may be my favorite animated GIF I’ve made in the last 14 years.\n\nSo eventually we get the most hapless track meet you ever done seen. We get Paunchy jumping what appears to be about 18”, yet are told he’s leaped eleven feet.\n\nELEVEN FEET!\n\nDespite this feat of incredible athleticism, Spiky Nick jumps one whole inch further (amazingly somehow looking even more clumsy on his attempt). Just as all is about to be lost, Zeus’ wife shows up doing a dance and waving the sword. Now I’m not 100% sure, but…\n\n…I think she wants him to use his sword.\n\nAt least I’m pretty sure that’s the case. I may have missed a subtle nuance here though.\n\nSure enough, Paunchy grabs the magic sword, and embraces his destiny – but get this, he chooses to be MORTAL! Because he has friends now, you see. Friends that cause him to look just as sad as he has the whole movie.\n\nAt this point, even the narrator is sounding bored by the whole thing. Take a listen.\n\n“He won several events.”\n\nSEVERAL EVENTS!!!\n\nTHRILLING!\n\nSo it finally comes down to archery, and as you’d suspect, Paunchy wins. And even when he wins, yeah, he looks kinda sad.\n\nAnd pudgy.\n\nBUT WAIT!\n\nA new entrant has arrived – BABYLON HIGH!\n\nOr Elementary!\n\nOr Grade School!\n\nSeriously, I have no idea how old any of these kids are supposed to be.\n\nAnyway, the kid from Babylon is KINTARO.\n\nI’d note how he doesn’t have four arms or is half tiger, but I already used up my fighting game nerd quotient earlier with that idiotic Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game mention. Next time I’ll learn to better ration such comments.\n\nBefore Paunchy can face off with Kintaro, he first runs into Marduke. Despite now being mortal and having no super human powers, Paunchy picks the big guy up and throws him right at us.\n\nAgain, I ask: what did I, the viewer, do to deserve that?\n\nMore of the world’s least athletic, most boring track meet follows. And yes, lil Paunch wins, as Big Show explodes in a fit of rage.\n\nLiterally.\n\nThe movie then ends with the school closing (I guess, it was never that it was saved, so this movie even screwed that up) and with Paunchy and Zeus walking in the clouds. Just to add final insult to injury, Zeus asks, “WHO’S YOUR DADDY?” as he punches, yes, me, right in the face.\n\nEh, somehow that’s an appropriate ending.\n\nAnd an appropriate way to celebrate another birthday here at WrestleCrap.com!"
