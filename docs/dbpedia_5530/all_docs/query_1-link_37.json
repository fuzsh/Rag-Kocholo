        "text": "Wrestlemania\n\nMurray buys WrestleMania tickets to spend time with Barry and Adam, but he buys fake tickets and they can't get in; Beverly forms her own neighborhood watch group when the Frentas decide neighbor Jane Bales will be the watch captain.\n\nDivision Street\n\nTwo rival gangs are united by competing on the basketball court instead of on the street.\n\nBody Slam\n\nHulk Hogan asks his old friend B.A. for the A-Team's help against a mobster who is out to close down the youth center he's financing for no apparent reason.\n\nThe Trouble with Harry\n\nHulk Hogan comes to visit B.A. but the reunion is interrupted by a cry for help from a troubled youth with an alcoholic father, who is pursued by a crazy mobster.\n\nSleeper\n\nFeeling a little wired, Space Ghost asks professional wrestler Hulk Hogan to put him in a sleeper hold so that he can get some rest. Instead, Hogan recites an original haiku about Zorak. Slash from Guns 'N' Roses winds up the show with his usual gift for gab."
