        "text": "This month, news emerged that Netflix is turning Hulk Hogan's early years as a wrestler into a biopic starring Chris Hemsworth. And because it's focusing on his early career and a bit of the Golden Age of Wrestling, that also means no sex tape or Brooke Hogan's singing career or the whole Hogan (Bollea)/Gawker saga.\n\nThis week, in a chat with TMZ Sports, Ric Flair's wife came out of left field and yelled out that she wants Bradley Cooper to play Ric Flair in the biopic, and that's...not a bad idea. The Hulk Hogan biopic is assuredly not going to win an Oscar, but there is something really promising about a well-practiced \"Woo!\" coming from the method-acting repertoire of Bradley Cooper.\n\nCooper's involvement wouldn't be too farfetched either. His production studio is one of the partners helping to produce the film, so it's not like Cooper's so far removed from the process that it's out of the question. That's when it hit me: this could be the ensemble film of WWF superstardom, so why not go ahead and throw some names into the ring in case Netflix is still making some crucial decisions? Hemsworth is the closest anyone is to locked in, but the rest are still up for negotiation. And so let's speculate.\n\nRic Flair\n\nThe more I think about this, the more it seems that the only reasonable fit here would be Bradley Cooper. I mean, we've already seen that the guy is able to make weathered looking tan skin look better than most, so why not bleach that hair and get to it? Woo! Nature Boy, Bradley Cooper.\n\nMacho Man Randy Savage\n\nNo one was a bigger star in the late 70s/early 80s wrestling circuit than Macho Man Randy Savage. He's the one guy whose casting relies less on looks and more on the iconic voice. For that, we turn to Jeffrey Dean Morgan, whose work on The Walking Dead proves he might be able to conjure up that insane growl. As for the wig—we'll figure that out later.\n\nAndré the Giant\n\nTo be frank, this is an impossible casting because there are not a lot of 7-foot, 500 pound actors out there. But having an early-days retelling of Hogan's career wouldn't be complete without the legend that is André (or the infamous bodyslam that Hogan pulled off to beat him in a legendary match). If he can gain a ton of weight and grow about 14 inches, Javier Bardem wouldn't be a terrible choice to assume the ring.\n\nBob Backlund\n\nBob Backlund plays a big part in Hogan's early career—he and Hogan had a rivalry that lasted a while in the early 80s. If you look back at early pictures, Channing Tatum seems to be a close enough fit to step into the wrestling legend's shoes. He's already familiar with the world of wrestling-for-theater from Foxcatcher, even if it is more on the Olympics side of the mat. I'm certain he could pull off Backlund.\n\nThe Undertaker\n\nSure, the Undertaker didn't get his start until the early to mid-80s but it doesn't particularly mean that we should rule him out of showing up. It's also perfect for Jason Momoa, who could easily channel the insanely tall, somewhat terrifying powerhouse. Granted, he also started in WCW, which is not where Flair and Hogan were, but this is a dreamcast. Let me live. Did you see how many liberties Bohemian Rhapsody took?\n\nLinda Claridge (Hogan)\n\nShe may not be the most prolific of the list, but Hogan's first wife, whom he married in the 80s, is a must-have for this biopic. Though it's hard to say if there's a single dead ringer for the spot, Kristen Bell would be a good choice to tackle the role (and that aggressive hair).\n\nVince McMahon\n\nIf one guy could take credit for launching Hogan's career, it's the man who literally gave him the last name. When Hogan made his way over to the WWF, he was Terry Bollea. McMahon, the business mind behind the wrestling conglomerate, passed on the moniker of Hogan and the rest is history. McMahon is integral to the story, and no one plays smarmy better than Armie Hammer.\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nThe role wouldn't be huge, but if the biopic is going to be about Hogan's rise, then you can't gloss over his appearance in Rocky III when he fought Rocky Balboa as part of a charity event. A little behind-the-scenes insight to how Stallone and Hogan interacted would be pretty cool, and Miles Teller is a solid choice to fill the role of young Sly."
