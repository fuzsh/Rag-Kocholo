        "text": "Hulk Hogan has found the one!\n\nThe retired WWE star, whose real name is Terry Bollea, married Sky Daily in an intimate ceremony on Sept. 22, 2023, just two months after announcing their engagement. Hogan, who has been married twice previously, and Daily had been dating for over a year before he popped the question.\n\nAfter their nuptials, Hogan posted a video compilation of the special day on his Instagram, writing that his “new life starts now” in the caption.\n\nThe wrestler also hasn’t been shy in the past about posting his love for Daily. In June 2023, he shared a sweet picture of the two enjoying the beach together as they matched in neon yellow swimsuits.\n\n“Beach day with my Sky Baby, it always seems just perfect, like she’s always been here, Sky Baby 4Life One Love HH,” he wrote in the caption.\n\nBoth Hogan and Daily have children from past relationships. Hogan shares Brooke and Nick with his ex-wife Linda Hogan, while Daily has three children of her own — and Hogan gets along great with them, he told TMZ.\n\nSo who is Hulk Hogan’s wife? Here’s everything to know about Sky Daily and her relationship with the WWE Champion.\n\nShe is a yoga instructor\n\nDaily, who is 25 years younger than Hogan, works as a yoga instructor. While her Instagram is private, her bio previously stated that she worked in the fitness industry and also helped small businesses.\n\nShe has three children of her own\n\nHogan may be a father to two grown kids, but Daily also has children of her own — and introduced them to the “Hulkster” before the two wed.\n\nHogan later told TMZ that he had met all three and immediately got along well with them. They were later featured in Hogan’s wedding video, with Daily’s youngest daughter matching her mom in white for her special day.\n\nShe and Hogan met on a night out\n\nThe newlyweds met thanks to Daily’s friend, Sabrina Nova, as Hogan recalled while giving a speech at Nova’s wedding in July 2023.\n\nDaily was out with Nova one night when Hogan bought her friend group a drink and asked, \"Who's the blonde?\" referring to Daily. After he walked out of the bar and started heading home, Nova ran after him and banged on the window of his car before he could leave, telling him he should pursue a date with Daily and that “she’s a nice girl!”\n\n“It made me think twice about just ghosting and going home and never calling,” he said during his speech.\n\nThey were first spotted together at a Bret Michaels concert\n\nFans noted Hogan had a new girlfriend when pictures of the two attending a Bret Michaels concert in February 2022 surfaced online. He also posted a video of himself and Daily meeting the singer backstage on his Instagram, introducing Daily as his girlfriend.\n\nHogan was privately divorced from his second wife, Jennifer McDaniel, at the time, but was quick to clarify his fans' confusion on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\n\"Yo Maniacs just for the record,the Facebook and Instagram posts are of me and my girlfriend Sky,I am officially divorced, sorry I thought everyone already knew,love my Maniacs4Life,\" he wrote.\n\nHogan proposed a year after dating\n\nThough the two prefer to keep their relationship private, as they rarely post together, Hogan did reveal their engagement publicly in July 2023. In a since-deleted Instagram video of his speech at Nova's wedding, the WWE star shared that he had popped the question.\n\n“I asked Sky to marry me, and she was crazy enough to say yes, brother,” he said.\n\nHogan later confirmed the news to TMZ, sharing that he proposed at a restaurant in Tampa, Florida, and was “very nervous.”\n\nDays after they revealed their engagement, the happy couple were spotted dining at Latitude 28 in Clearwater, Florida, where Daily’s shiny ring was on display.\n\nThey got married in September 2023\n\nHogan and Daily officially tied the knot in Clearwater, Florida, just two months after announcing their engagement. The ceremony was intimate, with seemingly only Hogan and Daily’s children in attendance, per TMZ.\n\nIn photos obtained by the outlet, the bride wore a white strapless gown with a sweetheart neckline and a lace train, while Hogan posed in a simple black tuxedo and a black version of his signature head bandana.\n\nHogan's daughter, Brooke, chose to skip the special day, later explaining that it was for her \"healing and happiness.\"\n\n“For my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family, and am focusing on people and things that heal my heart and align with my own personal beliefs, goals and values,” Brooke wrote on Instagram. \"I wish him well. ❤️.\"\n\nHogan and Daily got baptized together\n\nIn December 2023, Hogan revealed that he and Daily had gotten baptized, sharing a video on Instagram from the ceremony at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Florida."
