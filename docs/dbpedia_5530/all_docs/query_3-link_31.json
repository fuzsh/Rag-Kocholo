        "text": "Roman Reigns has been world champion in WWE since 2020.\n\nReigns won the Universal title on August 30, 2020, pinning Braun Strowman in a triple threat match that also included the late Bray Wyatt. In April of 2022, Reigns defeated Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 38, giving him control of both world titles. After a victory in a four-way match at this past Saturday’s Royal Rumble, his reign is ongoing, and will extend, at the very least, until WrestleMania 40 this April.\n\nCarrying the title for over 1,240 days has placed Reigns in select company.\n\nThe reigns of Bruno Sammartino (2,803 days) and Bob Backlund (2,135 days) are both likely out of reach for Reigns, but Hulk Hogan’s longest run as champion is within reach. If he holds the belt until September, Reigns could pass Hogan’s longest title reign, which lasted for 1,474 days between 1984 and 1988.\n\nHogan has watched in awe as Reigns has continued to redefine pro wrestling. He is the biggest star in the industry, and his appearances are must-see, especially now that they are more infrequent than ever before.\n\n“It takes a really long time to be able to transition and pivot on a dime the way he does,” said Hogan. “That’s how he paints masterpieces you’ve never seen before. He’s working on a whole different level.”\n\nHogan worked with Reigns’ father, Sika Anoa’i. The two even wrestled a world title match during the fall of 1987 that aired on Saturday Night’s Main Event, a night when Hulkamania reigned supreme at Hersheypark Arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\n“Roman’s dad, Sika, he explained the ABCs of it all to him,” said Hogan. “Watch his matches and you can tell. You can see it in the way Roman creates emotion, understands how to make the crowd mad, and how he puts people on the edge of their seat calling for that comeback. Roman Reigns learned this all old-school from his dad, but he adapted to the newer era, too. He can do it all.”\n\nHogan was part of the Royal Rumble weekend. In addition to narrating the cold open for the Rumble, he also made a surprise appearance at a nearby event hosted by Eric Bischoff and Conrad Thompson.\n\nReigns’ fatal four-way match also included three very different opponents in Randy Orton, AJ Styles, and LA Knight. Hogan noted that one of the keys to Reigns’ enormous success is his ability to bring out the best in whomever he is wrestling–as well as amplify the intensity by changing levels midway through a match.\n\n“Roman is adaptable to whoever he is wrestling,” said Hogan. “That’s important. At any moment in time, he can switch gears on you. He’s amazing, and he’d fit in any era.”"
