Hogan enjoyed mainstream popularity in the 1980s and 90s as the all-American character Hulk Hogan in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), and as \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, the villainous nWo leader, in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). A regular pay-per-view headliner in both organizations, Hogan closed the respective premier annual events of the WWF and WCW, WrestleMania and Starrcade, on multiple occasions. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005. He was signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) from 2010 until 2013, where he was the on-screen General Manager.\n\nHulk Hogan is a 13-time world champion being a six-time WWF/E Champion and seven-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. He is the third longest combined reigning WWF Champion of all time (after Bruno Sammartino, and Bob Backlund), the longest-reigning champion of the 1980s, and holds two of the ten longest title runs in WWF/E history, having held the title for 1,474 days from 1984-1988 (the fourth longest reign of all time) and 364 days from 1989 to 1990 (the 9th longest reign of all time). He is also the longest-reigning WCW World Heavyweight Champion of all time, with a 469-day reign from 1994-1995. Hogan won the Royal Rumble in 1990 and 1991, making him the first man to win two consecutive Royal Rumbles.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Years (1977-1979)[]\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation (1979-1980)[]\n\nNew Japan Pro Wrestling (1980–1983, 1984–1985)[]\n\nAmerican Wrestling Association (1981–1983)[]\n\nReturn to World Wrestling Federation (1983-1993)[]\n\nThe Crowning of Hulkamania (1983-1984)[]\n\nWWF Champion (1984-1988)[]\n\nThe Mega Powers (1988-1989)[]\n\nWWF Championship Reigns (1989-1992)[]\n\nBrief Comeback (1993-1994)[]\n\nReturn to New Japan (1993–1994)[]\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1994-2000)[]\n\nEarly Run (1994-1996)[]\n\nNew World Order (1996-1998)[]\n\nReturn to WCW (1998-1999)[]\n\nConflicts with Vince Russo (1999-2000)[]\n\nReturn to World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment[]\n\nHollywood Hogan and Undisputed WWF/E Champion (2002)[]\n\nMr. America (2003)[]\n\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003)[]\n\nReturn to WWE (2005–2007)[]\n\nMemphis Wrestling and PMG Clash of Legends (2007)[]\n\nReturn to TNA Wrestling (2009-2013)[]\n\nDixie Carter's business partner (2009–2010)[]\n\nImmortal (2010–2011)[]\n\nGeneral Manager (2011–2013)[]\n\nReturn to WWE (2014)[]\n\nOn February 21, 2014, WWE announced that Hulk Hogan would be returning to WWE, and would serve as the host of WrestleMania XXX.\n\nWrestling Details[]\n\nFinishing Moves\n\nAxe Bomber (Crooked arm lariat) – NJPW; used as a signature move in WWF/E / WCW\n\nOverhead gutwrench backbreaker rack – 1979–1980\n\nRunning leg drop\n\nSignature Moves\n\nAtomic drop\n\nBig boot\n\nBody slam\n\nMultiple punches, sometimes followed by a wind-up punch\n\nRaking the opponent's eyes or back\n\nManagers\n\n\"Classy\" Freddie Blassie\n\nMiss Elizabeth\n\n\"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart\n\nNicknames\n\n\"The Fabulous\"\n\n\"The Incredible\"\n\n\"(The) Hulkster\"\n\n\"The Immortal One\"\n\n\"Hollywood\"\n\n\"The Unstoppable Force\"\n\nEntrance themes\n\n\"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor (AWA / WWF / TNA; Used at TNA house shows)\n\n\"Battlestar Galactica Theme\" by Maynard Ferguson (NJPW)\n\n\"Real American\" performed by Rick Derringer and composed by Jim Johnston (WWF/E)\n\n\"Ravishing (Instrumental)\" by Bonnie Tyler (WWF)\n\n\"American Made\" by The Wrestling Boot Band (WCW)\n\n\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience (WCW / WWF/E / NJPW)\n\n\"Rockhouse\" by Frank Shelley (WCW / WWF; Used while a part of the New World Order)\n\n\"Kevin Nash / Wolfpac Theme\" performed by C-Murder and composed by Jimmy Hart and H.
