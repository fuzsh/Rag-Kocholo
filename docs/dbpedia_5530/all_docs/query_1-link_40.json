        "text": "Hulk Hogan is perhaps the most famous of professional wrestlers, a patriotic superstar of the 1980s wrestling landscape who has remained in the spotlight since. His ultimate penis grill is one of the most destructive forces around, though the grill stopped working because of overuse.\n\nWhile the mid-2010s revelation of his racist outbursts has damaged his reputation, he still remains a pillar of YouTube Poop culture considering the hilarious injokes derived from him.\n\n{{#ev:youtube|cYbCZxmpkUI|320}}\n\nHogasm[edit]\n\nHulk Hogan can cause a powerful earth-rumbling ejaculation called a hogasm. This phenomena can cause your crotch to explode into an giant semen shower, destroying your pants in the process. It's rumored the ejaculation is secretly used to transport people, as it packs enough power to propel victims backwards to the moon. However, this has yet to be confirmed. Some people hate to be confronted by a occurrence of a hogasm, leading to unnecessary aggression. It's advised to treat them with care.\n\nTrivia[edit]\n\nHe stars in a cartoon.\n\nOccasionally makes mistakes in speeches.\n\nHe is the ONLY person who could battle Brock Samson and win.\n\nHis ultimate rival is apparently The Ultimate Warrior.\n\nWas a former wrestler in the WWF/WWE.\n\nOnce had his own reality TV show.\n\nAlso known as The Incredible Hulk Hogan.\n\nHe sometimes does voice acting for Robot Chicken.\n\nFrancine proposed that he wrestle against Arthur Read. Yes.\n\nHe returned to wrestling multiple times recently. Starring on TNA instead of the WWE.\n\nHe once fought against Rocky Balboa!\n\nThe Ultimate Warrior once wanted Hulk Hogan to knock out everyone on his plane and make the plane that he's on go into a complete nosedive!\n\nHulk Hogan once held a midget wrestling championship named the \"Micro Championship Wrestling Tournament\"...yeah.\n\nHogan gave praise to the Insane Clown Posse for still following him for all these years.\n\nHe made a sex tape, having many hogasm's in the process.\n\nHe was once the General Manager of TNA. Way to go Hulk!\n\nOnce owned a restaurant in 1995 called Pastamania. It was shut down in less than a year, however, when Gay Luigi ate all the merchandise.\n\nIn the '90s, he actually became a heel, co-founding the nWo and becoming Hollywood Hulk Hogan. Its too bad his ego and politicking ultimately helped kill the WCW.\n\nLook up \"Fingerpoke of Doom\" to see his equally as buff best bud Kevin Nash taking a fingerpoke to the chest like he was taking a Death Star to the everything.\n\nHe voice acted in Saints Row 3 as well!\n\nHe once wrote a song dedicated to a young fan of his who sadly died before he could attend a Hogan match. Said song...wasn't well composed, to put it mildly.\n\nOnce ran a promo where he said that he, along with Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner and Geoff Johns would run wild on Sinestro, Black Hand and Atrocitus. No really this is a thing that happened.\n\nHe once recorded a very tacky musical album, Hulk Rules. One of the songs, \"Hulkster in Heaven\", is a tribute to a young Hulkamaniac who sadly died of cancer. Though the song should be heartfelt, Hulkster bungles it with the tacky instrumentals and the lyrics being more about himself than the child.\n\nLikes[edit]\n\nSaying \"Brother\", \"Dude\" and \"Jack\"\n\nYellow/Red Uniforms\n\nWrestling\n\n{{#ev:youtube|cgeUD99185s|320}}\n\nHis Ultimate Grill\n\nKevin Nash\n\nEric Bischoff\n\nThe Yapapi Indian Strap Match\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps message board\n\nFailing objectives\n\nDislikes[edit]\n\nAnimal Cruelty\n\nVince McMahon\n\n\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage\n\nThe Ultimate Warrior\n\nThe fact that Bass (from the Dead or Alive games) looks just like him.\n\nBooker T\n\nBeing teleported to a cave he's never been to before.\n\nHis rapping career.\n\nGawker\n\nMidcarders\n\n\"Vanilla midgets\"\n\n{{#ev:youtube|rvEjjIWMlco|320}}A challenger approaches.\n\nHulkamaniacs[edit]\n\nSeductiveBaz\n\nConnerhawke\n\nmariomarioecw\n\nSuperYoshi\n\nTyrannosaurusReich\n\nESM\n\nSuper Macho Man\n\nBass\n\nBandit Keith\n\nEveryone\n\nGallery[edit]"
