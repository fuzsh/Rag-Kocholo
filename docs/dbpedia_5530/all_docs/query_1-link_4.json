Early in his career Bollea played the part of Thunderlips in Rocky III (1982). He also appeared in No Holds Barred (1989), before starring in the family films Suburban Commando (1991), Mr. Nanny (1993), Santa with Muscles (1996), and 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain (1998). He starred in his own television series, Thunder in Paradise, in 1994. He is the star of The Ultimate Weapon (1997), in which Brutus Beefcake also appears in a cameo.\n\nBollea also starred in a pair of television movies, originally intended as a pilot for an ongoing series for TNT, produced by Eric Bischoff. The movies, Shadow Warriors: Assault on Devil's Island and Shadow Warriors: Hunt for The Death Merchant, starred Hogan alongside Carl Weathers and Shannon Tweed as a freelance mercenary team. In 1995, he appeared on TBN's Kids Against Crime.\n\nBollea made cameo appearances in Muppets from Space, Gremlins 2: The New Batch (the theatrical cut) and Spy Hard as himself. Hogan was offered the role of Zeus in Little Hercules in 3D on an episode of Hogan Knows Best and was shown during the filming of the movie. Hogan also made two appearances on The A-Team (in 1985 and 1986), and along with Roddy Piper. Nick's favorite animated show, Captain Planet and the Planeteers, was another popular stop for Hogan's recognizable voice. He was the voice of BP, Sly Sludge's evil sidekick; his famous catchphrase was \"You're gonna pay at the pump, brother!\" He also had a vital role in the two-part episode of Suddenly Susan in 1999. In 2001, Hogan guest-starred on an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger, playing a reformed criminal now operating a Christian Community Center and helping Walker steer teenagers away from gangs. Hogan also appeared in 1992 commercials for Right Guard deodorant dressed in fine clothing and painting and his line \"anything less would be uncivilized\".\n\nHogan has become a busy voice actor in recent years making guest voice spots on Robot Chicken and American Dad! and as a main actor in the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim series China, IL.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role 1982 Rocky III Thunderlips 1983 Bimini Code Rick, Blond Henchman 1984 Goldie and the Bears Mac McKenna 1989 No Holds Barred Rip Thomas 1990 Gremlins 2: The New Batch Himself 1991 Suburban Commando Shep Ramsey 1993 Mr. Nanny Sean Armstrong 1996 The Secret Agent Club Ray Chase 1996 Santa with Muscles Blake 1997 The Ultimate Weapon Cutter 1998 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain Dave Dragon 1999 Muppets from Space Himself\n\nImages[]\n\n[]\n\nHulk Hogan at the Internet Movie Database\n\nHulk Hogan films\n\nRocky III (1982) · No Holds Barred (1989) · Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) · Suburban Commando (1991) · Mr. Nanny (1993) ·"
