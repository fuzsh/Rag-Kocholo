It’s feeding bad polls. It’s turning off more donors. It’s sustaining a media atmosphere where no matter what Biden does, he comes off looking like a failure.\n\nAnd for those who were hoping Biden would quit, the public and private pressure, several top Democrats worry, has been backfiring.\n\n“His last act will not be getting knocked down,” said one longtime Biden 2020 campaign aide of the family and the inner circle. “They won’t allow it.”\n\nEven several Democrats who want Biden to go acknowledge they’ve created a situation where he will never able to satisfy the “tests” skeptics have said he must pass to stay their nominee. They are buckling down harder, especially when the critiques are more based on vibes, like when Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin suggested in a session between top aides and Senate Democrats last week to “put him in a muscle shirt, like Reagan chopping wood,” according to one person briefed on the discussion.\n\nCNN’s conversations with two dozen Democratic officials, aides in the White House and the campaign reelection headquarters and supportive groups demonstrate just how dark and confused the situation has become even with Trump’s rambling and combative convention speech on Thursday night giving the Biden campaign glimmers of hope for the first time in weeks.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nIn pictures: The final day of the Republican National Convention\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, speaking at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night, formally accepted his party’s presidential nomination for a third straight election.\n\n“With faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States,” Trump said to applause.\n\nHere are some photos from CNN photographers on the ground. See more photo from the RNC.\n\nFact Check: Trump makes more than 20 false claims in RNC acceptance speech\n\nFormer President Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday with the most dishonest speech in the four-day Republican National Convention, making more than 20 false claims by CNN’s count.\n\nTrump has made many of these false claims before, some of them for years. They spanned topics including the economy, immigration, crime, foreign policy and elections.\n\nSome of them were total lies, others smaller exaggerations. Some were in his prepared text (like the claim that he left the Biden administration a world at peace), while he ad-libbed others (such as his lies that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election and that the US is experiencing the worst inflation it has ever had).\n\nHere are some of the claims CNN fact-checked Thursday:\n\nTrump’s misleading claim about North Korean missile launches during his presidency\n\nTrump’s claims of defeating ISIS in a “couple of months”\n\nTrump on the impact of immigration on Medicare and Social Security\n\nTrump’s exaggeration about gas prices\n\nTrump’s claims about military equipment left in Afghanistan\n\nTrump’s false claim that the ‘world was at peace’ during his administration\n\nRead all the fact checks.\n\n\"Republicans have no principles, Democrats have no spine,\" historian says\n\nPresidential historian Allan Lichtman on CNN Thursday night harshly criticized Democrats for so publicly casting doubt on President Joe Biden’s ability to serve a second term – a move the historian said is “making it much easier for Donald Trump to win.”\n\n“At the first sign of trouble they have publicly trashed their incumbent president. … Of course his poll numbers are going to go down if his own party is attacking him. Why would voters think they ought to support him?” Lichtman argued.\n\nIf Democrats are set on pushing Biden out, he said, the president should “resign the presidency for the good of the country.” Next, Democrats should nominate Vice President Kamala Harris to be the presidential candidate, allowing the party to maintain the advantage of running an incumbent, he said.\n\n“The feckless Democrats have been playing right into the hands of Donald Trump by creating all of this internal chaos within their party without a good plan.”\n\nAnalysis: Trump claims his triumph and Biden’s hopes begin to fade\n\nThousands of supporters chanted “fight, fight, fight” and pumped their fists Thursday night as Donald Trump basked in the love of the new Republican Party he built and that hails him as a superhero touched by God.\n\nStates away, Joe Biden sat isolated and sick in his Delaware beach house as the party he led to victory just four years ago turned on the 81-year-old president, and the possibility grew that a humiliating final chapter may be opening in his storied political life.\n\nTrump and Biden have been locked in a bitter political clash ever since Biden vowed to launch a battle for the soul of the nation when White supremacists marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, seven years ago.\n\nTheir fates diverged sharply Thursday.\n\nTrump accepted the nomination of a united party convinced it’s cruising to victory in November, while Democrats splintered, with some fearing that their president could lead them to a landslide defeat after a cataclysmic debate performance sent his reelection campaign into freefall three weeks ago.\n\nMany senior-ranking White House and campaign officials have come to believe the president must abandon his campaign for a second term.\n\n“People see and feel the walls closing in,” one senior Democrat said, CNN also reported.\n\nRead the full analysis.\n\nIn pictures: Colorful scenes from the last day of the RNC\n\nWisconsin cheeseheads, Texans with cowboy hats, all kinds of images of former President Donald Trump and many attendees wearing bandages on their right ears: It was a colorful scene on the final day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nHere are some photos from CNN photographers on the ground. See more photos from the RNC here.\n\nSee more photos from the RNC.\n\nFact Check: Trump falsely claims there is record inflation under Biden\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed Thursday at the Republican National Convention that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is false. The current inflation rate, 3% in June 2024, is nowhere near the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920.\n\nTrump could fairly say that the inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but it has since plummeted.\n\nFact Check: Trump’s misleading claim about North Korean missile launches during his presidency\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Thursday that he “got along with” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and “we stopped the missile launches from North Korea.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim that he “stopped the missile launches” from North Korea is misleading. While missile launches did pause from North Korea for a period of time during his administration, they started up again before he left office.\n\nA May 2019 launch of what was assessed to be a short-range ballistic missile was North Korea’s first since 2017, which was seen as a sign of growing frustration from Kim on the state of talks with the US.\n\nNorth Korea later launched two more missiles in July 2019, a month after Trump’s high-profile meeting with Kim in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.\n\nNorth Korea conducted four missile tests in 2020.\n\nFact Check: Trump's claims of defeating ISIS in “couple of months”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed in his speech at the Republican National Convention that “we defeated 100% of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was going to take five years… We did it in a matter of a couple of months.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim of having defeated ISIS in “a couple of months” isn’t true; the ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019.\n\nEven if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq in late December 2018, as he has suggested in past remarks, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later.\n\nTrump also gave himself too much credit for the defeat of the so-called caliphate, as he has before, when he said he defeated the terror group with no caveats or credit to anyone else.\n\nKurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015.\n\nAnalysis: Trump's lengthy rambling is \"first good thing that's happened to Democrats\" in weeks\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former senior advisor to President Barack Obama, noted Thursday night that former President Donald Trump spent a significant amount of his approximately 90-minute speech “riffing” off-script — a move that may work in Democrats’ favor.\n\n“This is the first good thing that’s happened to Democrats in the last three weeks,” Axelrod said on CNN after the speech.\n\nFact Check: Trump misleadingly claims federal judge ruled classified docs case \"unconstitutional\"\n\nDonald Trump said Thursday that the Florida federal judge overseeing the classified documents case against him dismissed the criminal charges against the former president, finding “that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional.”\n\nFacts first: Trump’s claim is misleading. District Judge Aileen Cannon wrote in her ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who was prosecuting the case, violated the Constitution. But Cannon specifically did not comment on the validity of the charges Trump was facing, or whether Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper.\n\nIn a 93-page ruling, Cannon said Smith’s appointment violated the Constitution. Cannon said that Smith’s position as special counsel “effectively usurps” Congress’ “important legislative authority,” because Congress should have the authority – not the head of the Justice Department – to appoint such an official.\n\nCannon also said that Smith’s office was being funded improperly.\n\nBut Cannon also specifically noted that she was not deciding any “other legal rights or claims” brought by Trump or his co-defendants in the case.\n\nThe judge also said that the Justice Department could potentially revive the case by funding the special counsel through different means. Prosecutors from outside the special counsel’s office could also refile the charges.\n\nFact Check: Trump biographical video includes false and misleading claims\n\nThe Republican National Convention played a biographical video about former President Donald Trump before he began his speech.\n\nThe video included several false and misleading claims:\n\nThe Trump tax cuts\n\nThe video featured a narrator making a claim that Trump, himself, frequently utters. The narrator said “the Trump tax cuts: largest in America’s history.”\n\nThis is false. Analyses have found that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. You can read a detailed fact check here.\n\nGlobal conflict under Trump\n\nThe video’s narrator also delivered a version of another claim Trump has made repeatedly, saying Trump’s “strength and resolve” produced “a stable world at peace.”\n\nThis claim about world peace under Trump is false, too. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021.\n\nUS troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia’s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa’s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico’s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine’s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021.\n\nAmericans’ incomes\n\nWhile attacking President Joe Biden’s handling of the economy, the video featured on-screen text that said “US incomes fall for third straight year,” attributing those words to a Wall Street Journal article in 2023. An image of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was shown on screen at the same time.\n\nThis combination of words and images is misleading. The video didn’t acknowledge that the first of the three straight years in which the Wall Street Journal article reported that inflation-adjusted median household income went down was 2020, when Trump was president. (The Covid-19 pandemic played a major role in the decline.)\n\nReal median household income fell from $78,250 in 2019 to $76,660 in 2020 (all under Trump), then edged down to $76,330 in 2021 (mostly under Biden) and fell more substantially to $74,580 in 2022 (all under Biden). Figures for 2023 and 2024-to-date are not available.\n\nFact check: Trump on the impact of immigration on Medicare and Social Security\n\nDuring his RNC speech, former President Donald Trump again said that Democrats are harming Social Security and Medicare by letting migrants into the US.\n\nFacts First: Trump is wrong. In fact, the opposite is true, particularly in the near term, multiple experts say. Many undocumented immigrants work, which means they pay much-needed payroll taxes, and this bolsters the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and extends their solvency. Immigrants who are working legally typically won’t collect benefits for many years. As for those who are undocumented, some are working under fake Social Security numbers, so they are paying payroll taxes but don’t qualify to collect benefits.\n\nThe Social Security Administration looked at the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security trust funds. It found that in 2010, earnings by unauthorized workers contributed roughly $12 billion on net to the entitlement program’s cash flow. The agency has not updated the analysis since, but this year’s Social Security trustees report noted that increasing average annual total net immigration by 100,000 people improves the entitlement program’s solvency.\n\n“We estimate that future years will experience a continuation of this positive impact on the trust funds,” said the report on unauthorized immigration.\n\nMeanwhile, unauthorized immigrants contributed more than $35 billion on net to Medicare’s trust fund between 2000 and 2011, extending the life of the trust fund by a year, according to a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.\n\n“Immigrants tend to be younger and employed, which increases the number of workers paying into the system,” said Gary Engelhardt, a Syracuse University economics professor. “Also, they have more children, which helps boost the future workforce that will pay payroll taxes.”\n\n“Immigrants are good for Social Security,” he said.\n\nHowever, undocumented immigrants who gain legal status that includes eligibility for future Social Security and Medicare benefits could ultimately be a drain to the system, according to Jason Richwine, a resident scholar at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration.\n\n“Illegal immigration unambiguously benefits the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, but amnesty (legalization) would reverse those gains and add extra costs,” Richwine wrote in a report last year.\n\nFact check: Trump on trade deal with China\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed that he struck a trade deal with China, requiring the country to purchase $50 billion worth of American products.\n\nFacts First: The claim that China bought $50 billion worth of American products as a result of a trade deal is false.\n\nTrump is referring to what is known as the Phase One deal he struck with Beijing in December 2019.\n\nWhile the deal required China to buy $50 billion worth of American agricultural products by the end of 2021 — Beijing did not live up to its commitment.\n\nUS agricultural exports to China recovered from the trade war but did not reach the levels in the Phase One commitments, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nFact Check: Trump exaggerates how much higher gas prices are right now\n\nFormer President Donald Trump described gas prices inaccurately during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday.\n\nHe said that “gas prices are up 60%.”\n\nFacts First: The average price of a regular gallon of gasoline nationwide is $3.51 as of Thursday, according to AAA. That’s up about 47% from the day President Joe Biden was inaugurated, when the average was $2.39, not 60% higher as Trump claimed.\n\nAlthough the United States has a strategic gasoline reserve, which can be tapped by the White House to ease upward pressure on prices, as Biden did in May, gas prices are still mostly determined by market forces, such as global petroleum production and consumer demand, not solely by the decisions of a sitting US president.\n\nBalloons shower RNC crowd as Trump's family joins him onstage\n\nBallons showered the crowd at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night after former President Donald Trump ended his GOP nomination acceptance speech.\n\nMoments before, former First Lady Melania Trump joined her husband onstage and took his hand.\n\nThe impassioned crowd erupted in cheers in an enthusiastic end to the four-day event.\n\nThe rest of Trump’s family, many of whom had been sitting in the VIP box just moments before, walked up to embrace Trump, including his children Ivanka, Eric, Don Jr., Tiffany, and several of their children and spouses.\n\nThe former president’s running mate, JD Vance, and his wife, Usha, also appeared onstage.\n\nFact Check: Trump falsely claims government hired 88,000 IRS agents\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, while recounting a conversation he had with a waitress worried about the taxes on her tips, claimed that the government recently hired 88,000 IRS agents to audit individuals.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act — which Congress passed in 2022 without any Republican votes — provided an $80 billion, 10-year investment to the IRS. The agency plans to hire tens of thousands of IRS employees with that money, but only some will be IRS agents who conduct audits and investigations.\n\nMany people will be hired for non-agent roles, such as customer service representatives. And a significant number of the hires are expected to fill the vacant posts left by retirements and other attrition, not take newly created positions.\n\nThe 88,000 figure comes from a 2021 Treasury Department report that estimated the IRS could hire 86,852 full-time employees — not solely enforcement agents — over the course of a decade with a nearly $80 billion investment.\n\nFact Check: Trump’s claim on treatment access for terminally ill patients before the \"Right to Try\" law\n\nFormer President Donald Trump touted the “Right to Try” law he signed in 2018 in his convention speech Thursday, which gave terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven’t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBefore the measure was passed, Trump claimed, terminally ill patients in the United States would have to go to foreign countries to seek experimental treatments or go home to die if they couldn’t afford it.\n\n“Sounds simple, but it’s not, and I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will – instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place – or if you have no money, going home and dying,” he said.\n\nFacts First: This is misleading. It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications – but the government almost always said yes.\n\nScott Gottlieb, who served as Trump’s FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own “expanded access” program.\n\n“Emergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,” Gottlieb testified.\n\nFact Check: Trump on US military equipment left in Afghanistan\n\nFormer President Donald Trump repeated his claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nTrump said, “And we also left $85 billion worth of military equipment.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nAs other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.\n\nFact Check: Trump falsely claims \"world was at peace\" during his administration\n\nDonald Trump claimed Thursday, as many others at the Republican National Convention have, that while he was president the world was at peace.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim about world peace under his presidency is false. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021.\n\nUS troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia’s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa’s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico’s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine’s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021.\n\nTrump is \"playing the greatest hits from 2016,” Biden campaign adviser says\n\nThe Biden campaign has been closely watching former President Donald Trump’s convention remarks Thursday evening – with a Biden campaign adviser characterizing the speech as “all about him.”\n\nDespite some predictions that Trump would moderate his tone and message in the aftermath of the assassination attempt, the adviser said, “He’s playing the greatest hits from 2016.”\n\nThey added, “He has not changed, he has not moderated, he has gotten worse.”\n\nBiden campaign rapid response director Ammar Moussa is also sharing real-time reactions to the remarks on social media platform X, quipping, “Lots of unity in this speech” and “Donald Trump can’t help himself.”\n\nTrump outlines key promises for second term\n\nFormer President Donald Trump laid out his promises for a second term in his speech at the Republican National Convention, including lowering the cost of groceries and gas, bringing back jobs, and securing the border.\n\nHe said the United States has “incompetent leadership” and claimed the “inflation crisis is making life unaffordable,” before slamming Biden’s border policies — two of Trump’s main campaign points.\n\nThe new RNC platform reflects Trump’s broader policy agenda on a range of issues as he continues to reshape the party in his third run for the White House. Trump said the platform is filled with “bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House.”\n\nInflation and the economy: To bring down prices, Trump said Republicans would cut energy costs that he claimed will “in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing, and all household goods.” The RNC platform also emphasizes reducing the national debt and calls to “Make America Affordable Again” and “end inflation.”\n\nJobs: Trump said he would also bring back auto jobs through taxes, tariffs and, specifically, not allowing auto manufacturing plants to be built in countries like Mexico and China. “The way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple — build it in America and only in America,” Trump said. “This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs and we will take over the auto industry again.”\n\nTax cuts: Trump said he would get rid of taxes on tips, and lower taxes in general. As president, he enacted a large tax cut: it gave corporations permanent tax breaks, but the tax cuts for workers expire after next year. He would have to work to extend his own earlier tax cuts or it would feel like Americans are getting a massive tax hike. “You’re paying too much. We’re going to reduce your taxes still further,” Trump said, adding that it would lead to “tremendous growth” that would pay off the national debt.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare: Trump said he would protect these programs. Both Trump and President Joe Biden have repeatedly vowed to protect Social Security, but neither has issued detailed proposals to address the beloved entitlement program’s looming insolvency.\n\nThe border: Trump slammed the Biden administration for ending policies he put in place during his first term. He said he would close the border “on day one” and finish building the wall on the US southern border. Trump said the platform also promises “to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.”\n\nYou can read the Republican National Committee platform with annotations here.\n\nCNN’s Zachary B. Wolf and Curt Merrill contributed reporting to this post.\n\nFact Check: Trump's false claim on US crime statistics\n\nFormer President Donald Trump claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that “our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim about a dramatic increase in the crime rate is false. Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime dropped significantly in the US in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities; violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020, President Donald Trump’s last calendar year in office.\n\nPreliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% national decline in murder and a roughly 6% national decline in overall reported violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime below 2020 levels. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and a roughly 15% decline in overall reported violent crime.\n\nThere are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data usually has some initial errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere.\n\nCrime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline “ever recorded.” And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also “crime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.”\n\nFact Check: Trump blames Biden administration for \"greatest invasion in history\"\n\nDuring his RNC speech, former President Donald Trump claimed that the Biden administration has done nothing to curb illegal immigration to the US.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim that the Biden administration is doing “nothing” is incorrect. Illegal crossings at the US border dropped in June and the Biden administration has imposed significant restrictions on asylum along with other measures to curb illegal immigration.\n\nArrests along the US southern border dropped 29% in June, according to new data released by US Customs and Border Protection, following the Biden administration’s order severely limiting asylum-seeker crossings.\n\n“Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,” CBP Acting Commissioner Troy A. Miller previously said in a statement.\n\nLast month, the Biden administration invoked an authority to shut off access to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally, a significant attempt to address one of the president’s biggest political vulnerabilities. It was the administration’s most dramatic move on the US southern border, using the same authority Trump tried to use in office.\n\nFact Check: Eric Trump's false claims about the economy and US global standing in 2016\n\nEric Trump told the crowd at the RNC on Thursday that the “economy was struggling, jobs were scarce” and the US had poor standing on the global stage when his father was elected president in 2016.\n\nFacts First: Eric Trump’s claims are false. When Donald Trump took office in 2017, he inherited a strong economy, including a robust labor market, and a nation that was viewed favorably on the global stage.\n\nIn 2016, the US added an average of nearly 194,000 jobs per month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In the two years before, those average gains were even higher: 226,000 in 2015 and nearly 250,000 in 2014.\n\nJob gains remained above historical averages in 2017 through 2019, with 177,000 jobs added on average per month.\n\nEric Trump’s claims that jobs were scarce in 2016 are not accurate. In fact, the US labor market experienced its longest expansion on record starting in 2010 and continuing until March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic crippled global economies, including that of the US.\n\nIn addition to inheriting a labor market in good shape, the economy was growing when Trump took office. Real gross domestic product — the widest measure of economic activity — typically grows between 2% and 3%, and it averaged 2.4% between 2014-2016 and then nearly 2.7% during the first three years of Trump’s presidency, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data.\n\nAlso, the US was well regarded internationally when Barack Obama left office, and those sentiments plunged at the beginning of Trump’s presidency, according to the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center.\n\nTrump mentions Biden by name, but says he'll only do it once\n\nFormer President Donald Trump mentioned his likely opponent, President Joe Biden, by name during his speech Thursday night, although he said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\nCNN reported earlier Thursday that Trump was not expected to say Biden’s name at all during his remarks, according to a source with knowledge.\n\nFact Check: Trump repeats misleading claim about oil drilling and gas prices\n\nAs he has done repeatedly on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that under a new Trump administration, the United States would “drill, baby, drill,” and “by doing that, we will lead to a large-scale decline in prices.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s frequent campaign claim that the US can lower gas prices by producing more domestic oil is misleading.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, US oil production has reached a new record this year, even surpassing output under Trump’s administration. The Energy Information Administration expects crude oil production to hit successive records this year and next, powered by an oil boom in the Permian Basin. As CNN has reported, the US currently produces more oil than any other country on the planet, at about half a million barrels per day more than the prior annual record set in 2019.\n\nPrices at the pump in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market and the US cannot be truly energy independent when it comes to gas prices, energy experts have told CNN.\n\nOil is a global commodity; the global price of oil determines US gas prices and it’s simply impossible to separate that price from shifting global dynamics like Russia’s war on Ukraine or OPEC’s recent decisions to cut oil production.\n\nAlso, the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces, McNally told CNN last year. McNally compared the light crude the US produces to champagne and the heavy crude it imports to coffee. US oil refineries are specifically built to separate out the “heavy and gunky” crude we consume, McNally said.\n\nTrump decries Democrats' \"partisan witch hunts\" against him\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump urged Democrats to drop the “partisan witch hunts” against him.\n\nAs an example, he noted that a Florida judge on Monday dismissed his classified documents case.\n\nThe judge found “that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional and the entire case was thrown out of court,” Trump said.\n\nHe also said the Democratic Party “should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy.”\n\nHe also noted the subpoenas that his family members had received from Congress.\n\n“They got subpoenaed more than any people, probably the history of the United States every week, they get another subpoena from the Democrats, crazy Nancy Pelosi,” he said. “They’ve got to stop that because they are destroying our country.”\n\nTrump said he had come out on top despite every impeachment and indictment against him. “The time that you have to spend — if they would devote that genius to helping our country, we’d have a much stronger and better country.”\n\nTrump observes moment of silence for Corey Comperatore, man killed at his Pennsylvania rally\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday asked to hold a moment of silence for Corey Comperatore, the man killed during the attempted assassination at a rally Saturday.\n\n“I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend, Corey,” Trump said during his remarks at the Republican National Convention.\n\n“There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for others, this is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours and this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This is what we need,” he said, telling attendees that tonight\n\nThe crowd chanted “Corey” and Trump at one point walked over to a firefighter uniform, representing Comperatore who was a firefighter, and kissed the protective helmet.\n\n“What a fine man he was,” he said about Comperatore, who he said “acted as a human shield” to protect his family from bullets.\n\nTrump said during his remarks that over the past few days, they have raised $6.3 million for the the families of the victims.\n\nTrump says he is running to be president \"for all of America\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he is running to be president for the entire county during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\nHe said he came to the podium in front of the crowd with a “message of confidence, strength and hope.”\n\nLee Greenwood performed “God Bless America” before Trump came out on stage. The firefighter jacket and helmet of the victim of the rally shooting, Corey Comperatore, on Saturday was brought on stage.\n\nIt is Trump’s first public speech since Saturday’s assassination attempt. He will formally accept the nomination to be his party’s presidential nominee after winning enough delegates at the start of the convention on Monday.\n\nThe former president’s speech is expected to be “very forward focused,” one of his top advisers, Chris LaCivita, said earlier today.\n\nTrump has been in the arena all week, watching remarks from his former primary rivals, allies and his running mate, JD Vance.\n\nWatch his speech in the video player above the page and follow instant analysis here.\n\nAllies of VP Harris are making calls to assess political environment “just in case,” source says\n\nAllies of Vice President Kamala Harris are making calls to assess the political environment “just in case,” according to a Democrat close to her, who emphasized that at the present moment, “there is no ‘in case’.”\n\nThis Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the calls from Harris allies include quiet conversations with Democratic convention delegates.\n\nThis source said the Harris calls are being made with the full knowledge of President Joe Biden’s inner circle and that her allies are making clear from the start of every conversation that she expects the president to stay in the race.\n\nThis and several other Democrats described increasing tensions within the party over what is seen as maneuvering by competing interests.\n\nReached for comment, Biden-Harris campaign spokesperson Brian Fallon told CNN:\n\nNOW: Trump arrives at RNC arena ahead of address later tonight\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has entered the Republican National Convention in its fourth and final night of programming.\n\nHe’s set to speak later tonight and formally accept the GOP presidential nomination for a third time.\n\nTrump is still wearing the bandage on his right ear.\n\nIn the box: Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Nevada Senate candidate Sam Brown were among those who greeted Trump when he entered the box at the arena.\n\nThe speech: Trump has said he scrapped his initial prepared remarks for the RNC and wrote a “whole different speech” after surviving an assassination attempt on Saturday in Pennsylvania. “This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different,” he told the Washington Examiner.\n\nOne of his top adviser, Chris LaCivita, said the speech will be “very forward focused,” while another source told CNN that Trump is not expected to say President Joe Biden’s name once during his remarks where he will accept his party’s presidential nomination.\n\nThe post was updated with more details on Trump’s arrival.\n\nFact Check: Pompeo’s false claim about spy balloons under Trump's administration\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday evening that under former President Donald Trump’s administration, “not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across” the US.\n\n“We’d begun on an honorable exit from Afghanistan, and not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States of America,” Pompeo said.\n\nFacts First: The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false.\n\nThree suspected Chinese spy balloons transited over the continental US during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after President Joe Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said in 2023 that a “domain awareness gap” allowed the balloons to travel undetected.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo highlights Trump's accomplishments in speech\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo highlighted what he considered former President Donald Trump’s accomplishments while serving under his administration.\n\nHe mentioned that there were no new American wars under Trump’s administration and noted the efforts made to close the US southern border.\n\nHe claimed that the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan prompted Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“It was that very weakness, that very weakness in Afghanistan that prompted [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s butchery in Ukraine. Last week we saw what it meant – a children’s hospital bombed, innocents killed. It did not have to be,” he added.\n\nRussia launched its massive invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, although it had occupied Crimea in 2014.\n\nThere has been little mention of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the RNC, as Trump and Vice President nominee JD Vance have previously argued for US aid to Ukraine to be scaled back.\n\nPompeo, who was a close ally of Trump’s during his administration, is the first person to have served as both director of the CIA and secretary state. He was previously a congressman representing Kansas’ 4th District but left office to join the Trump administration.\n\nCNN’s Kate Sullivan and Shania Shelton contributed reporting.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional comments from Pompeo.\n\nRepublicans attending RNC say Biden staying in the race helps them\n\nRepublicans attending the Republican National Convention on Thursday argued that President Joe Biden remaining in the race would only help Republicans win in November.\n\nCarolyn Bonkoski, an alternative delegate from Pennsylvania, told CNN that Biden is “so ruined, that I don’t think he stands a chance” against former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, Lynn Mowrey, of Kansas City, Kansas, said “it would be nice to know who we’re running against.”\n\n“I think that’s why we’re probably taking a more positive approach tonight, just because we don’t know who the opposing candidate is,” she told CNN.\n\nMowrey believes Vice President Kamala Harris would be easier to beat if she replaces Biden at the top of the ticket, because of her “lack of experience” and “the way she presents herself, she’s really not a serious person.”\n\nBonkoski felt the same, arguing that with Harris at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket, Republicans’ chances of winning in November “go up.”\n\nBiden’s top officials believe he must drop out as he becomes increasingly isolated, sources say\n\nPresident Joe Biden is more isolated than he has ever been, with many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials now privately believing that he must abandon his campaign for a second term – and soon.\n\nIn interviews with CNN, more than two dozen sources familiar with the dynamics inside the West Wing and the campaign said there is now widespread acceptance that Biden remaining in the 2024 race is wholly untenable.\n\nAnother top Democrat close to the White House described Biden as having become “exceptionally insulated and isolated” since the CNN debate on June 27. Multiple sources said some of the most senior advisers to Biden — including adviser Anita Dunn, attorney Bob Bauer and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon — faced the ire of the president’s family in the aftermath of the debate.\n\nThat has only had the effect of making Biden’s inner circle of advisers with free access to the president — which had already been famously small and impenetrable — even tighter.\n\nAfter the debate, a stunningly small number of his most loyal aides — chief among them, his decades-long advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti — and members of the Biden family appear dug in along with the president. Deputy White House Chief of Staff Annie Tomasini joins Donilon and Ricchetti in forming a protective bubble around the president.\n\nAnthony Bernal, chief of staff to Jill Biden, has grown even more powerful during the deepening crisis and has tamped down any signs of dissent, two sources say, reporting any naysayers to the first lady.\n\nIn response to questions about this story, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Biden is “proud of the well-rounded team he has built.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment on this story.\n\nMore than 1,000 Black female leaders and organizers sign letter supporting Biden\n\nMore than 1,000 Black female leaders and organizers from across the country have signed a letter in support of President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the open letter to Democratic leaders, they voice deep disappointment with what they describe as a “lack of unity” during a fractious period that has seen a growing number of high-profile Democrats call on the president to step aside in the 2024 race.\n\n“During the primary election process held across the country earlier this year, 14 million Americans cast ballots for President Biden and Vice President Harris. They are the duly elected democratic party nominees for the 2024 Presidential election,” the letter reads.\n\nFormer Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Actress Vivica A. Fox, and the first Black woman elected to the US Senate, Carol Moseley Braun, are among the list of signees.\n\nThe letter suggests there could be a potential showdown among different coalitions of the Democratic Party, with Black voters having routinely illustrated their steadfast support for Biden.\n\nA copy of the letter was shared with CNN by Melanie Campbell, chair of the Power of the Ballot Access Fund. News of the letter was first reported by The Hill.\n\nDemocrats warn of \"slow bleed\" of Biden fundraising dollars\n\nDemocrats are making two key arguments to Joe Biden’s inner circle as chaos continues in the Democratic party over the viability of the president’s reelection bid.\n\nFirst: The steady rise in the percentage of voters, including Democrats, who believe Biden is not fit for the job.\n\n“Who is in charge there?” said a top Democratic strategist who posed the question despite being close to several members of the president’s inner circle. “The latest BET interview was awful. Why are they doing this to him.”\n\nSecond: Trump is making substantial gains in the race at a time he is spending nothing on television ads.\n\nThe numbers there are stunning. The Biden campaign has spent $8.8 million on TV ads in the week from July 11 to July 18. The Trump campaign spent just $33,000 in that same time frame.\n\nOverall Democratic spending in this past week — the campaign and pro-Biden super PACs — totaled more than $11 million. Overall pro-Trump spending totaled $6.9 million.\n\nOne prominent Democrat described a “slow bleed” of Biden fundraising at a time Trump is using his convention to make giant fund-raising gains. The national and battleground polling is moving in Trump’s direction already, “and what will happen when Trump buries Biden with money?” this Democrat asked.\n\n“The post Republican convention polling is going to change the race,” this Democrat said. “That with the money metrics are the data point to look for.”\n\nSeveral people appealed to Melania Trump to speak at the convention, sources say\n\nWhen former first lady Melania Trump enters the Republican convention Thursday night, she won’t be doing so on stage as she did in 2016 and 2020. Though several people appealed to her to give a speech multiple times lately, she declined to do so, two sources familiar told CNN.\n\nThat breaks with a modern tradition at political conventions where the candidate’s spouse can showcase their softer side, typically in remarks devoid of politics but instead with a focus on the personal. Instead, Melania Trump is expected to accompany her husband in the VIP box at the back of the arena.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is expected to accept his party’s nomination tonight in a speech that is expected to part from his usual combative tone and appeal to national unity.\n\nTrump advisers shed light on how the assassination attempt has — and hasn’t — changed the former president\n\nThis will be the third Republican National Convention speech Donald Trump will give in his brief political career, and while advisers say the former president remains Trump, his campaign co-manager Chris Lacivita pointed to that experience as a core element in this moment.\n\nAnother adviser sharpened that point as it pertains to tonight’s remarks. “You don’t get shot in the head and not experience some kind of a change,” the adviser said.\n\nThat has been an animating feature of Trump’s rewrites and new drafts of what is expected to be a lengthy speech this evening.\n\nAs for whether he’ll stick to that script, the adviser just shrugged. “It’s Trump. That’s up to him in the moment.”\n\nMore Democratic lawmakers weigh in on Biden's candidacy\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Coons, the co-chair of the Biden-Harris campaign, is asking that President Joe Biden be given time to hear from people about his reelection campaign, and insists Biden is the best candidate to beat former President Donald Trump.\n\nCoons told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday afternoon that at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, “I’m confident that we will nominate the best candidate to take on, defeat Donald Trump. For me, that’s Joe Biden. For some of my colleagues they have different views.”\n\nIn the face of extreme pressure from many Democratic leaders and voters who believe Biden should step aside, Coons said, “Our president deserves the respect, the recognition of his incredible record of success, his 50 years in public service – to give him the time to hear from trusted partners and leaders, to hear from Democrats around the country and to make the path forward clear for the American people.”\n\nMoments later on CNN, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley, who has publicly called on Biden to leave the ticket, responded to Coons’ remarks.\n\n“You’re a good and loyal friend, and there’s a lot to be said for that, and it’s perverse to think it, but right now that loyalty is working against the future of our democracy,” Quigley said. “It is horribly sad. I would rather do anything else than work against a second Biden administration, but it can’t happen, it won’t happen.”\n\nThe lawmaker said he hopes Biden will “take the next couple days” and then “save democracy for us in time.”\n\nRead more comments from Democratic lawmakers today.\n\nTrump is prepared to face Harris if Biden drops out of the race, team says\n\nDonald Trump advisers privately say they want President Joe Biden to remain their Democratic opponent, and their actions attacking a potential Democratic shift say as much publicly.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they aren’t preparing for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSeveral close allies have made a point at leveling attacks at Harris during their speeches this week, something that was closely coordinated with the campaign.\n\nAnd Trump’s advisors make clear they are ready to tee off with Harris if Biden drops out — on policy, but also on her public assessments of Biden’s health and mental acuity.\n\nThat would immediately be deployed in ads, with Trump advisers carefully watching the Democratic disarray play out in the media.\n\nTrump is letting anticipation build as he promises a message of unity tonight\n\nWhen Donald Trump takes the stage in Milwaukee tonight, it’ll be his first time in front of a major crowd since he was nearly assassinated at his Pennsylvania rally Saturday night.\n\nThat’s by design, several sources familiar tell CNN, who say Trump has mostly stayed away from cameras to let the anticipation build.\n\nHis advisers and children have promised that the message will be vastly different than it would have been before the shooting. Trump was directly involved in rewriting it, as his political operation reworked the speeches of those who preceded him at the convention, personally reviewing them before they were loaded into the teleprompter.\n\nWhile many wanted to add references to the assassination attempt, several told CNN they were urged to stay on message and let Trump focus on that instead. Trump has been involved in orchestrating nearly every moment of the convention, down to who is speaking when.\n\nA source familiar tells CNN that Trump’s speech, which will close out the convention, is expected to last a little over an hour, though it could go longer given the applause lines.\n\nHe’s continued to work on it this afternoon.\n\nNOW: The final night of the RNC has begun. Here's a look at tonight's big speakers\n\nThe fourth and final night of programming for the Republican National Convention at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has commenced.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is expected to be the headline speaker tonight as he formally accepts the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nIt will be his first public speech since he survived the attempted assassination on Saturday at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nHere’s a look at other notable speakers scheduled for tonight:\n\nHis son Eric Trump\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump attorney Alina Hababa.\n\nRead the full list of speakers here.\n\nBiden in \"contemplative stage\" about the future of his candidacy while isolating in Rehoboth Beach\n\nPresident Joe Biden is in a “contemplative stage” as he isolates with Covid-19 in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and calls among Democrats grow for him to reconsider his re-election bid.\n\nA source familiar with the president’s mindset said that he is “thinking things through” and “deliberating” about how to proceed while in isolation. He’s reviewing polling, fundraising numbers and other data that paint a grim picture of his chances of succeeding against former President Donald Trump. He has privately acknowledged to others that there is a limited path, given the all the unfavorable data, the source said.\n\nThe source went on to say that this is a new moment in the campaign, where the view within Biden’s orbit about his political future has grown increasingly dim, leading some to now believe that Vice President Kamala Harris would fare better as the party’s nominee.\n\nIt’s unlikely the president will make any sort of announcement before the weekend, the source said, cautioning that anyone who thinks they know what Biden will ultimately do doesn’t actually know.\n\nMelania Trump and members of Trump family to attend RNC on Thursday, according to source\n\nThe Trump family is expected to attend the Republican National Convention on Thursday as Donald Trump accepts the GOP nomination for president, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n\nMelania Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are expected to attend, the source said. Trump’s sons Don Jr and Eric Trump have been present at the convention over the last few days.\n\nCNN previously reported that Melania Trump has maintained a low profile throughout her husband’s campaign, having attended just two public appearances since Trump launched his third presidential bid — the kickoff of his campaign in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home and a brief appearance in March when she accompanied Trump to vote in the Florida presidential primary.\n\nNew poll conducted after assassination attempt gives Trump a lead over Biden\n\nA new CBS News/YouGov poll finds former president Donald Trump leading President Joe Biden among likely voters nationally, 52% to 47%.\n\nThe poll was conducted Tuesday through Thursday, in the wake of the assassination attempt against Trump over the weekend and during the beginning of the Republican National Convention. The results mark the widest advantage yet for Trump in the CBS/YouGov poll, which had previously shown a consistently tight race between the two candidates.\n\nHead-to-head polling released earlier this month from other outlets ranged from showing an advantage for Trump to a near-even race.\n\nAfter being told that “after the debate, some Democratic officials reportedly said Joe Biden should step aside as the Democratic Party’s nominee for president in 2024,” 56% of registered voters say Biden should step aside and give another Democrat a chance to run, the poll found, with 44% saying he should continue running. But those numbers are reversed among Democratic registered voters, who say, 56% to 44%, that Biden should continue running.\n\nHow this poll was conducted: The CBS News/YouGov poll surveyed 2,247 registered voters on July 16-18, using a nationally representative online panel. Results among the full sample of registered voters and among the full sample of likely voters have a margin of error of +/- 2.7 percentage points. Results among likely voters in battleground states have a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points.\n\nWhat to expect on the final night of the RNC\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s first public remarks since Saturday’s assassination attempt. The official Republican Party presidential nomination. Kid Rock.\n\nThe final night of the Republican National Convention boasts a busy lineup. Here’s what to expect as the programming kicks off soon:\n\nTrump’s speech: The highlight of the final night of the RNC will be Trump’s speech.\n\n“Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now,” Trump told the Washington Examiner of his convention speech following the assassination attempt.\n\n“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” he said.\n\nHigh-profile Republican remarks: In addition to Trump, there are a number of other notable speakers, including Dana White, Tucker Carlson, Hulk Hogan, Mike Pompeo, Eric Trump and the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nA performance from Kid Rock: The musician and Trump ally is expected to perform tonight before Trump takes the stage, a source familiar with the schedule tells CNN.\n\nTrump is expected to come to the convention early tonight\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who will give the keynote address on the final night of the Republican National Convention, is expected to appear at the arena earlier than previous nights, a source familiar with the planning tells CNN.\n\nTrump is expected to arrive at the arena just before 8 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump not expected to say \"Biden\" once during his speech tonight\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is not expected to say President Joe Biden’s name once during his Republican National Convention remarks when he will accept the party’s nomination, according to a source with knowledge.\n\nOne of Trump’s top advisers, Chris LaCivita, said earlier Thursday that the former president’s speech will be “very forward focused.”\n\nCNN reported Monday that Trump, who has long believed he could be a target of political violence, has responded to Saturday’s harrowing events by calling for the country to come together. In a series of interviews on Sunday with conservative media, Trump said he threw out the searing speech he intended to deliver when he accepts the Republican Party’s nomination Thursday night.\n\n“The speech I was going to give was a real humdinger,” Trump told the Washington Examiner. “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now.”\n\nOhio governor says he knows type of person he would appoint to Vance's seat — but won't give names\n\nOhio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said he knows what he is looking for in the person he will appoint to fill Sen. JD Vance’s seat, but declined to say the names of anyone on his short list until after the election in November.\n\nVance was tapped to be former President Donald Trump’s running mate and officially accepted the nomination at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday. If Trump wins the presidential race, Vance will have to resign his Senate seat.\n\nDeWine, who served in the Senate for more than a decade, said he wants someone who will “go there and work, wants to make things happen, get things done.” He said he knows “what type (of) person” could accomplish that.\n\nThe governor also said he is looking for someone who will be willing to continue to campaign. The person he appoints will eventually have to run to win the seat.\n\n“I think we have a lot of good people, we really do. I just don’t want to get into the names yet,” he said.\n\nTop House Democrat Raskin privately encouraged Biden to reconsider re-election campaign\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, penned a deeply personal letter to President Joe Biden earlier this month privately encouraging the president that there is “no shame in taking a well-deserved bow” out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRaskin’s July 6 letter, first reported by the New York Times and obtained Thursday by CNN, offers rare insight into the delicate situation some of Biden’s top allies are navigating as an isolated Biden weighs his political future. Biden has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race.\n\nRaskin confirmed the letter’s authenticity in a statement shared with CNN, saying, “I wrote that letter to the president over the Fourth of July weekend. My point was that we needed a strategic internal discussion about how to move forward to decisively win the election, which is of immeasurable importance to the future of America. The letter expressed my profound affection for the president, my great concern for the future of the country and my confidence in the judgment he would make. None of those things has changed.”\n\nThe Maryland Democrat said that in the coming months, “We have an overriding obligation to defeat the forces of resurgent monarchy and oppression. Everything else pales in comparison to this struggle, even your magnificent policy achievements.”\n\nFor context: You can read the entire letter here\n\nTrump’s RNC speech will be “very forward focused,\" top adviser says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s speech that he’s set to deliver at the Republican National Convention will be “very forward focused,” according to one of his top advisers, Chris LaCivita.\n\nLaCivita would not divulge details about the speech and said it will continue to change throughout the day.\n\nLaCivita said the campaign had not raised security concerns, “because we have a phenomenal detail.”\n\nBut he said, “I was always worried about safety, just was. And unfortunately, it was something that played out in front of everybody.”\n\nLaCivita said he was not at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally on Saturday when the shooting took place.\n\nIowa couple who voted for Biden in 2020 tell the president: \"Let others take the wheel\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden is getting an earful about his decision to keep his re-election campaign alive — but he’s not just hearing from Democratic lawmakers. The White House is fielding a steady stream of letters, telephone calls and message from Americans, too, from voters like Terri and John Hale.\n\nThe Hales, longtime Democrats from Iowa who said they met Biden “many moons ago” and proudly voted for him in 2020, shared a 2-page letter they sent to the White House with CNN. Worried about the prospect of Donald Trump winning a second term, the Hales said they decided to voice their opinion directly with the president.\n\nA White House official said the president routinely receives correspondence from Americans with a range of viewpoints, including many on the wisdom of him seeking a second term. The official was looking into whether the opinions on this particular question have been tallied or shared with the president.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders and Elise Stefanik named chairs of Trump’s Women’s Leadership Coalition\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik have been named chairs of the Trump Women’s Leadership Coalition, according to two sources familiar.\n\nThe announcement came at a closed press Women for Trump event in Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\nThey both spoke at the Republican National Convention this week.\n\nHarris says Vance’s RNC speech was \"compelling,\" but not \"the full story\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Thursday said the story Ohio Sen. JD Vance told the crowd during his speech at the Republican National Convention the previous day was “compelling” but “not the full story.”\n\n“Frankly, what is very telling is what he did not talk about on that stage,” Harris said during a rally in North Carolina, referring to former President Donald Trump’s running mate.\n\n“He did not talk about Project 2025, their 900-page blueprint for a second Trump term,” Harris said. She added: “He did not talk about it because their plans are extreme.”\n\nShe also criticized Vance for his party’s stance on abortion, the economy, and the Republican Party’s call for unity in the wake of the attempt on Trump’s life last weekend.\n\n“You cannot claim to be for unity if you try to overturn a free and fair election and threatened to terminate the United States Constitution,” Harris added.\n\nRemember: Project 2025 is a policy blueprint for the next Republican president produced by a conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation. Trump has attempted to distance himself from the document, but at least 140 people who worked in his administration had a hand in its creation, a CNN review found.\n\nHarris will respond to Vance in remarks at campaign rally: \"You can’t pretend to stand for unity\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is about to deliver remarks weighing in directly on Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, a campaign official tells CNN, saying, “You can’t pretend to stand for unity when your agenda is as divisive and extreme as Trump.”\n\nThe vice president will use a campaign rally Fayetteville, North Carolina, to react to the speech Vance gave at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night. She’ll say people aren’t going to fall for Vance’s attempt to cast Trump as a fighter for the middle class, per a campaign aide.\n\nHarris will argue that Vance and Trump’s calls for unity do not hold up given their divisive agenda, and she’ll defend President Joe Biden as person who lives middle class values, the aide said.\n\nGOP senator says lawmakers followed Secret Service director at RNC to demand answers on Trump rally shooting\n\nGOP Sen. Kevin Cramer was one of four Republican senators who chased Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on the floor at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, shouting at her about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\nCramer told CNN’s Manu Raju that the lawmakers followed Cheatle because she refused to answer their questions about why Trump was allowed to go on stage at the event on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans have publicly criticized a briefing they received from Cheatle and FBI officials, saying it was “uninformative.”\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans have publicly criticized a briefing they received from Cheatle and FBI officials, saying it was “uninformative.”\n\n“There was a little built-up frustration going into that moment, because they she didn’t want to talk to us on the phone either when they did a quick briefing, where they told us very little that was new. And then, again, avoided that very same question that several of us tried to ask,” Cramer said.\n\nThe North Dakota Republican said the lawmakers specifically want to know why Trump was allowed on stage when law enforcement was aware of a suspicious person in the area.\n\nFollow live updates on the assassination attempt investigation here.\n\nWatch a clip of the tense interaction below:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nef23a5d3-a140-4a25-af28-420952f366c5.mp4\n\n00:30 - Source: cnn\n\nBiden is focused on getting better but remains \"up to speed\" on national security, White House says\n\nPresident Joe Biden is “focused on getting better” but is still being “kept up to speed” on national security matters, the White House said Thursday.\n\nNational security spokesperson John Kirby made the comment to reporters during a phone briefing, saying he didn’t have any specific briefings or schedule items to speak to, “but I do know that he’s being kept updated and up to speed as he normally would.”\n\nMeanwhile, an administration spokesperson said there’s still “every expectation” Biden’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go ahead in Washington next week.\n\nKirby said in his call with reporters that it was important to “make sure that that the President’s health and his recovery from Covid takes priority.” He said it was too early to know how that would impact the Netanyahu meeting.\n\nBiden campaign says he is fine after Covid-19 diagnosis as his \"I'm sick\" troll bears fundraising fruit\n\nFollowing President Joe Biden’s recent diagnosis with Covid-19, his campaign says he’s doing fine as they use social media to troll their supporters.\n\nBiden’s deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks on Thursday said the president has been doing fine, self-isolating in Delaware, and will continue to hold official meetings and campaign calls virtually.\n\nThe Biden campaign trolled supporters Wednesday evening in the moments after Biden was diagnosed with Covid-19. And the viral post (pun intended) was successful, the campaign said — a bright spot for the president’s embattled campaign.\n\nThree long minutes later, a second post followed up: “of Elon Musk and his rich buddies trying to buy this election. And if you agree, pitch in here,” linking to a fundraising page.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, more than 133 million accounts had viewed the original post and 18 million viewed its follow-up post. It was one of the best social media fundraising posts for the Biden campaign in more than a year, a campaign official said, second only to a post in the aftermath of former President Donald Trump’s conviction in a hush money trial.\n\nThe official declined to share how much the post raised. But the moment signals how the campaign is looking to less traditional, more creative means of reaching grassroots audiences at a time when big Democratic donors are holding back checks amid concerns about the viability of Biden’s candidacy."
