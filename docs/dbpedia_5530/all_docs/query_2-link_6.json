He later reprised the role for the animated series Sonic Underground in 1999.\n\n2. Fergie as Sally Brown from Peanuts\n\nBefore she was the vocalist for the Black Eyed Peas, Stacy âFergieâ Ferguson was a child star who appeared on the Disney Channel's Kids Incorporated.

He played the villain Unicron, a planet-sized Transformer hell-bent on ultimate power.\n\n4. Jessica Walter as Fran Sinclair from Dinosaurs\n\nDinosaurs premiered on ABC in 1991 and centered on a family of anthropomorphic dinos created using puppetry and animation. Before she played Lucille Bluth onÂ Arrested Development, Jessica Walter voiced matriarch Fran Sinclair. Puppeteer Kevin Clash, who was Elmo on Sesame Street, voiced the scene-stealing Baby Sinclair.\n\nThese days, Walter can also be heard as Malory Archer on FXâs animated series Archer.\n\n5.

He played both Dennisâ father, Henry Mitchell, and the next-door neighbor Mr. Wilson. Hartman left Dennis the Menace after one season to pursue SNL full-time.\n\nHartman also did voice work on cartoons such as DuckTales, Captain Planet and the Planeteers, and Darkwing Duck.

Throughout the series run, Ritter was nominated for four straight Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program between 2001 and 2004.\n\n10. Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant\n\nAt the start of his career in the '90s, Vin Diesel (whose real name is Mark Sinclair Vincent) took a role as the titular character in Brad Birdâs directorial debut,Â The Iron Giant. While undoubtedly a lead role, the animated robot only said a handful of words.\n\nVin Dieselâs voice can also be heard in Marvelâs Guardians of the Galaxy, coming out this summer. Diesel once again lends his voice to an unloquacious alien, the tree-like Groot.\n\n11. Earle Hyman as Panthro from ThunderCats\n\nWarner Bros.

Lending their voices to the crime-fighting duo Ace and Gary were none other than Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, respectively.\n\nIn 2011, Colbert and Carell re-teamed to star in a special live-action version of \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\" for a short film on SNL. Jon Hamm and Jimmy Fallon played Ace and Gary while Colbert and Carrell played the villains, Dr. Brainio and Bighead.\n\n14.

Throughout the years, he has taken a few supporting roles in movies like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, My Own Private Idaho, and Back To The Future Parts II and III.\n\nFlea also lent his voice talents to Nickelodeon'sÂ The Wild Thornberrys, playing Donnie Thornberry, and voiced the character in the show's film-length effortsÂ The Wild Thornberrys: The Origin of Donnie, The Wild Thornberrys Movie, and Rugrats Go Wild, a cross-over between Nickelodeonâs Rugrats and The Wild Thornberrys.\n\n16. LeVar Burton as Kwame from Captain Planet and the Planeteers\n\nLeVar Burton is a television icon after starring in shows like Reading Rainbow andÂ Star Trek: The Next Generation, but he has also lent his voice to a few cult animated series as well, like Batman: The Animated Series and Disneyâs Gargoyles.

Arsenio Hall as Winston Zeddemore from The Real Ghostbusters\n\nTwo years after the release of Ghostbusters, ABC aired a cartoon version of the hit movie. The Real Ghostbusters featured the same characters from its live-action counterpart, but with different voice actors in the roles. Before he landed his own late night talk show, Arsenio Hall played the role of Ghostbuster Winston Zeddemore during the first three seasons of the animated series.\n\nActor Ernie Hudson, who played Winston Zeddemore in both of the Ghostbusters movies and its video game, auditioned for the animated TV series but lost out to Arsenio.\n\n18. J.K. Simmons as the Yellow M&M\n\nActor J.K. Simmons has made a name for himself on the big and small screens with his performances as J.
