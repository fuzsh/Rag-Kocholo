Club, tips us off to a crime story from her pop-music beat - a minor scandal involving R&B star Rihanna, a selfie, some shady Thai gentlemen, and the cute (and legally protected) mammal known as the slow loris.\n\nA Drunken Bet Leads to an Airborne Stunt\n\nA History Lesson With Booze Â®\n\nIn 1956, someone bet New Jersey resident Thomas Fitzpatrick that he couldn't get to Washington Heights in Manhattan in fifteen minutes. He took drastic measures to prove his drinking buddy wrong. Twice.\n\nTough-as-Nails Heroes from Lee Child\n\nGuest List\n\nWith the *eighteenth* installment in the best-selling \"Jack Reacher\" thriller series hitting bookshelves this month, we asked the author to list a few fictional tough-guys who inspired his protagonist.\n\nStyle Advice and Shocking Revelations from Tim Gunn\n\nEtiquette\n\nThe emmy-winning \"Project Runway\" host, author, and educator ad-dresses issues of accessorizing and fashion victimhood, then reveals a surprising \"don't\" he almost did.\n\nDessert Chefs Take on Dinner\n\nMain Course\n\nThere's a growing trend across the country of pastry chefs striking out on their own to helm full restaurants. We caught up with Jordan Khan of Red Medicine to learn how dessert techniques inform all his dishes.\n\nHulk Hogan May Have Healing Powers\n\nEavesdropping\n\nBrad Neely created the cartoon series \"China, IL.\" He tells us a story about one particularly famous voice actor in his cast - former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nMargaret Atwood Laughs in the Face of Apocalypse\n\nGuest of Honor\n\nMargaret Atwood has published 21 novels, 11 non-fiction books, and 15 collections of poetry, including \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"The Blind Assassin.\" Her newest novel, \"MaddAddam\" is the conclusion of a dystopian trilogy that integrates her real-life environmental activism into her fictional world.\n\nA Soundtrack Like Sorbet: Subtle, Sophisticated, Sweet\n\nSoundtrack\n\nSinger and guitarist Steve Gunn makes us a sweet and sophisticated mix with a global influence.\n\nPlaylist: Episode 220\n\nPlaylist\n\nHeard something you liked?
