        "text": "*There’s a comic book epidemic sweeping my senior classes. It started a few weeks ago. I can trace the origins back to a single student (suspect zero, if you will) who has been bringing in his formidable collection of trades (collections of story arcs) and handing them out to whoever wants to read them.\n\nI stopped actively collecting/reading them in 2006. Comics are like drugs to me. Whenever I go to Jelly’s, I look at all the covers and realize I have no idea what’s going on in the current market and all I want to do is spend hours – nay, days! – trying to figure out exactly what’s going on. In keeping with the drug metaphor, I have already borrowed three collections and plowed through them just like the old days. I read them in a night, give them back, then ask if he has any more while I scratch my neck and look over my shoulder because of paranoia. You can’t trust me when I get into comics. Chores don’t get done. Quizzes don’t get graded. Daughters don’t get fed.\n\n*That this personal comic book renaissance should occur at the same time as my renewed interest in professional wrestling is nothing more than a coincidence, but I don’t think it’s completely random, either. Both have been life-long interests of mine, and the two intersected last night.\n\nI caught wind of the ESPN E:60 special on Scott Hall aka Razor Ramon by chance. I haven’t seen it yet, but I DVRd it so I can watch it later this week. I have however, seen the promo for it (it is among the most depressing things I have ever seen). So after I read a couple of hundred pages of graphic novel, I actually considered getting out of bed to watch the ESPN segment. Thankfully, reason won and I went to sleep at a (relatively) decent hour. Yet before I drifted off to sleep, I came to a conclusion about on-again/off-again love affair with both comics and wrestling. I think I have subconsciously known this for a long time, but those 20 minutes before drifting off to sleep allowed me to think about both. I had an epiphany of sorts.\n\nMy love for both is essentially rooted in basic elements that appeal to me: storytelling, characters, athleticism, competition, and the idea of being able to walk around wearing a massive golden belt that denotes supremacy. Both comic books and wrestling are fantasy only loosely tethered to the real world (The Avengers live in New York, professional wrestling was always a form of “reality television,” storyline scripted, action real). As a result, it doesn’t mean anything “real,” which in the most basic sense means that there are no true consequences.\n\n*Any attempt to break up my own life into “story arcs” would be a completely arbitrary process likely built around some key event. I could for example, say things like “THe College Years,” or “The High School Days” or be less specific and break apart my life into two clearly defined segments known as “The Pre-Lynnette Era” and the “Lynnette Era” – but only retrospectively.\n\nLike a story, lives have some semblance of plot in that there is the opportunity to reflect on the cause-and-effect relationships of events. I’ve been married for 5 years and change. That’s not a very long time in the scope of my life; it isn’t even half of my adult life. Yet that single decision has had an impact on just about every single decision I’ve made since that one fine day in July of 2006; in the simplest terms, being married means I have to consider the opinions and feelings of my partner (left, in the dress) in addition to how a decision might affect me. Madison added to that degree of difficulty.\n\nThe thing about characters in books or film or tv shows is that their story arcs are their lives. At the end of a series or story, the audience walks away generally knowing that the central conflict has been resolved, and we rarely care what will happen to the characters after that resolution. The assumption is that their lives go on – if they managed to survive the story arc – but what happens to them afterwards isn’t important. It isn’t a part of that singular narrative. Books and films and tv shows are tidy little boxes. Once we have consumed everything in that box, that’s that. Human lives aren’t like that. Sure, as far as my single friends who live the single lifestyle are concerned, Phil is all but dead and buried. But I’m not. Life goes on.\n\nThe stories found in comic books and professional wrestling are the somewhere in between. Story arcs in both realms have a beginning, middle, and end. Then a new one starts. Sometimes, the stories that came before don’t even affect current story lines (characters coming back from the dead, wrestlers who were mortal enemies 3 weeks ago are tag team partners this Monday). The beauty of both my beloved comic books and professional wrestling is that constant attention isn’t necessary. The stories might change, and the characters might shift in their alignment, but because neither is particular bogged down by years of cause-and-effect events, I could take a vacation from either and figure out what’s going on after a few minutes of reading or watching, and a few quick Google searches. The best part about comic books and professional wrestling is that consistently offer me the best of both worlds. Pages filled with the deeds and words of super heroes and rings filled with one-dimensional behemoths allow me to be nostalgic (due to the overall familiarity with the general experience itself), yet still anxious and excited (due to the unfamiliarity with the specific details of wherever I have “jumped on” again).\n\nIn my real human life, continuity is king. I have to pay constant attention because whatever I say or do carries the potential for consequences. Some, of course, are more dire than others. But comic books and pro wrestling? Since continuity doesn’t really matter, they can pull off the rare feat of being both always exactly the same and always completely different at concurrently.\n\n*Today was just one of them days, and I did my damnedest not to take it personal(ly). Our morning started with two staff members from Madison’s new school coming by the house to meet Madison answer any questions that Lynnette and I might have. Because I am a conspiracy theorist, I also assumed they were over to scope out our place, you know, to make sure that Madison is growing up in a safe and sanitary environment. That’s why I spent parts of Monday and Tuesday cleaning up the common areas. For those of you not in the know, that means roving around the house scouring the carpet looking for balls of fur from Abby’s disemboweled chew toys. Mostly, though, it means shoving all of Madison’s toys lying around the living room into an empty soda box, and tossing the newly not-empty soda box into Madison’s real room, as opposed to the master bedroom which she says is her room. It’s kind of like CM Punk’s WWE Championship belt vs. John Cena’s – you know what? Never mind. All I know is that if the two staff members from the school asked to see Madison’s room, there would have been 2 seconds of silence followed by 14 seconds of excuse-making followed by 3 seconds of touring followed by 4 minutes of note-writing. Lucky us.\n\nImmediately following the home visit, the three of us hit up Walmart to pick up the few school supplies that Madison needs for the school year. Sadly (as far as Madison is concerned), the plastic cubby box, three-ring binder, and spiral notebook did not come in purple. After garnering her items, we headed over to the movie section and I found these thought-provoking DVDs.\n\nBelieve me, I was very interested in the Transformers tv season on the far left. We’re talking about Hot Rod, the Autobot Matrix of Leadership, Megatron/Galvatron, Unicron’s head, etc. But I can never buy any of these DVDs because I already spent something like $30 on Season 1 years ago only to be shocked at how poor the animation was. The cause of this letdown is two-fold: 1) My fondness for the tv show is rooted in romanticized memories from my childhood, and 2) the animation for Transformers: The Movie was much better; I had seen that more recently and frequently and thus assumed the tv show looked like this. The second issue is a non-issue, movies are nearly always financed better than tv shows. The first issue, though, is something that really sucks the fun out of being an adult.\n\nIt’s true, the world is a much more open place to an adult, but in retrospect, perhaps it never feels that way. Here’s what I mean: As an adult, I can go to a strip bar if I want to, but I know that decision also comes with other consequences such as financial strain and the wrath of my stripper-phobic wife. As a child, I don’t have the right to patronize a titty bar – even if I want to – but on the other hand, I still believe that I could become a Major League Baseball player with a little more hard work. As a kid, I don’t have the life experience to know that Suburban Commando would probably suck, even if it featured the immortal Hulk Hogan. Childhood logic: Hulk Hogan is the best. Therefore, anything he does is awesome. So many years and hard-won lessons later, I know better than to watch The Chaperone no matter how hard those commercials during Raw stroke the movie. Aside: A few years ago, some of my students watched The Marine starring John Cena. Their review of the movie,” It was an hour-and-a-half of Cena jumping out of windows before the building exploded behind him.” Something like a year or two after that, I was flipping through the channels looking for something to watch. I stumbled upon The Marine and let it ride. I hadn’t watched for 5 minutes before Cena hurled himself through a pane of glass only to have the building behind him burst into a ball of flame. I COULD NOT stop laughing.\n\nWhile I sat at the computer watching today’s Mets game (I’m going to miss you, Carlos Beltran, but that’s another blog, another time), Madison set up her “red fish game” on the dinner table next to me. It took a few minutes for my brain to calibrate the audio filter – you know – to block the sound of mechanical winding out of my head. When the Mets game coverage hit a commercial, I turned around to watch Mad gone fishin’.\n\nI quickly grabbed my phone to snap this picture featuring Madison’s Michael Jordan-esque concentration (and tongue-wag). I watched her play (and cheat) this game for five minutes. She narrated everything she did during those five minutes, informing me that she had “caught a Mets fish” (the orange one), “put the fish back in his home,” because “he misses his mommy and daddy.” Whenever I watch Madison engage with mundane things like this, I am made happy and saddened at the same time. I am happy for her because she’s still so very young and therefore able to see the world as fresh and new and cool and as a place filled with infinite possibilities. I, on the other hand, sit on the couch and watch a preview for Conan the Barbarian starring Jason Momoa and understand that the reasons that remake can happen in 2011 are A) movies are aimed at young people, B) the audience for the original film series is no longer young, C) making a movie is much easier if there is existing source material. Then I think that I should like to see some kind of update of Ghostbusters or Big Trouble in Little China, but also know that I would hate it because they wouldn’t be making it for me, they’d be making it for the kids I try to teach sonnets to. The danger in trying to re-live and/or recreate the personal favorites of ones childhood is the destruction of those illusions that the nostalgic darlings of our formative years are awesome. I’m positive they were awesome, but alas, seeing those things in my head through the haze of an 23-year old preserves what would otherwise be sullied by the eyes of an adult.\n\nThe finishing touch to all of this philosophical meandering through space and time came courtesy of an epiphany I had while shopping at Costco this evening. Lynnette needed a specific item, and thusly Madison and I were obliged to join her at the greatest use of a warehouse not featuring half-pipes, a dilapidated taxi cab, and a secret room. We meandered through the aisles of the clothing area for a few moments before we stumbled across the aloha shirts pictured above. I asked Lynnette which was the ugliest (one of the criteria I take into account before purchasing an aloha shirt). Before she could answer, Madison announced that she had to use the bathroom. I was left alone to choose among the $7 shirts. In looking at the various styles and trying to figure out what size I’d be, a thought seized me: it didn’t matter which shirt was the ugliest. When Lynnette returned, I was still standing next to the shirts. “So what?” Lynnette asked. “Shit. I think I just realized something,” I said. “What?” “I’m too old to ironically wear anything ugly, aren’t I?” Lynnette was silent. “Because I’m at the age when people would actually consider-” and she cut me off with a “Yeah.” Ironically, unlike my former favorite kids’ shows, when I see a hideous polyester aloha shirt at Savers, I see it through the eyes of a 20-year old. It isn’t until I hold the shirt up against the bump of my stomach and imagine myself wearing it that my illusion of youth is shattered.\n\nYesterday was laundry day, and I spent today the day cleaning everything else that didn’t fit in the washing machine.\n\nOther than my mom, I don’t know anyone who derives pleasure from cleaning, so I try to run other things in the background to take my focus off of what I am doing. Yes, this technique lengthens the time it takes me to clean, but I feel like I enjoy it more. No, that’s not right. I feel like I hate it less. Today’s diversion was the Netflixing of “The Best of WCW Monday Nitro.” It wasn’t very good. It was just a bunch of footage from Nitro programs with intermittent narrating from Diamond Dallas Page, AKA DDP, AKA the guy who used to enter the arena to a horrible rip-off of Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” That’s one of the things I had forgotten about the WCW Nitro era: they had some really shitty music with absolutely no personality. Hulk Hogan walked into something that sounded like Hendrix’s “Voodoo Chile,” which served Mike Piazza better during his time as a Met. We can’t forget Chris Jericho’s anthem, which was a rip-off of “Evenflow” by Pearl Jam. That’s something WWE always had over WCW, the music (though my friend Brett loved the Harlem Heat and Eddie Guerrero’s music). Anyway, when it came time for lunch, I had actually accomplished very little. Madison made the call on Portuguese sausage for lunch, so we cooked some up. Madison made short work of her lunch, plowed through her Capri Sun, and left an oily paper plate in her wake.\n\nWhile I was cleaning things up a little – which in this case consisted of one of my favorite “tidying” techniques: moving things around and stacking them more neatly – I found an artifact from college. It’s the program from the Hawaii Club luau that took place my senior year. Obviously, I didn’t do any of the traditional dances, but I was in charge of writing (with my roommate Derek) the skits for the program.\n\nThe night before the luau, the entire club and other participants held a dress rehearsal in a smaller auditorium. It was supposed to be a full run-through, but Derek and I hadn’t completed writing the skits yet. It is just as likely that we hadn’t started yet. I had a memory of Marcie (Derek’s then-girlfriend) threatening us that night about the skits, but I always just assumed she was coming down on Derek and me because we were screwing around (warranted). Thanks to the 9-year old program, I was reminded that Marcie was technically responsible for the skits, and had farmed them out to Derek and I (how could she possibly trust the two of us?). Also, she was the Hawaii Club President. That would explain why she scolded and threatened us. I reminded Derek of this series of events and he replied, “Well, she was Dennis Martinez (MLB pitcher nicknamed “El Presidente.”). I’m pretty sure she gave us the ‘Philip Michael’ and ‘Derek Reid’ speeches, which scared us straight.” He’s right. I also recall both Derek and I telling her “No worry!” in really high-pitched voices, then making scared faces at each other when she walked off. Great f*cking times.\n\nMadison is pretty close with Lynnette. Because I spent the last two school years leaving at night to do work at Starbucks and the last two springs at baseball practice, Madison is used to me not being around. It’s sad, but it’s true. Her relationship with Lynnette informs her view on the relationships between everything else in the world. For example (like the photo above), whenever there are two of something and one is bigger than the other, the smaller one is always “baby _________________” (in this case, vacuum), and the larger one is always “mommy ____________” (vacuum). If I ask her “Where’s daddy ________________________?” Madison will always reply, “Oh, he went to work.” It’s funny and sad at the same time. It’s funny as she’s at the age when she’s applying her own personal truths to everything else, and those personal truths trump everything else. About a week ago, Lynnette and her parents tried to explain that “Mama” was Lynnette’s mom. Madison wouldn’t have it. She said, “No, that’s Mama. You’re (Lynnette) only Madison’s mom.” Last Sunday, Madison heard my dad call my mom “mom,” and the Goob immediately corrected my dad by telling him “That’s not mom, that’s Grammmma.” It’s funny because her logic is sound, but ridiculous. It’s sad because that’s the only way she can view the world. Sometimes when we’re out, she’ll hear a baby crying. Then she’ll see the baby being held by its father, and Madison will say “She doesn’t want the daddy, she misses her mommy.” It sucks because I know the reason she says this is because this explanation is a reflection of how she feels. All this makes me pretty sad. But then we played catch with the Wiffleball in the living room and she threw a rocket into my chest that fell to the floor. She looked at me and shouted “Catch it, Dad!” I wanted to punch her in the face. It wasn’t my fault. (At that range, she has to float the ball and give me a chance at catching it). Then she said, “It’s okay, dad, I’ll get it!” And we played for about 10 minutes while the vacuum and Swiffer sat motionless on the living room floor.\n\nThe cleaning did get done, though. I promise.\n\n*New York Congressman Anthony Weiner (nah, too easy) has a hobby: sending pictures of his crotch to women not his wife via the internet. After repeated denials, Weiner finally admitted to “sending similar pictures to six different women he met online over the past three years” yesterday.\n\nI don’t know Anthony Weiner, I don’t know anything about politics, and honestly, I don’t get it. Former NFL quarterback entrenched himself in intrigue for a similar offense by sending crotch shots to Jenn Sterger, a former employee of the New York Jets. To borrow from one of the greatest rock frontmen of all time, these two clowns give love a bad name.\n\nThe cliche goes that a picture is worth a thousand words, and I suppose in using that kind of logic, the picture message crotch shot must be more effective than any pick-up line, song, or conversation possibly could be. Let’s be fair, the poorly-lit, awkwardly taken photo of one’s penis with a substandard camera says so much without technically saying anything. It says “I’m into you.” It also says “I’m not joking around.” Metaphorically, it could be construed as romantic in the “Look, I don’t normally do this (not true in Weiner’s case), but I’m going to put myself out there. This is how I feel.” It’s entirely possible that taking a picture of your junk, then hitting “send” is just simpler and less time consuming than a conventional courtship. Why take a woman to dinner-or even coffee-when you don’t have to spend a dime spamming babes with profile shots of your Ultra Magnus? Well, if romance was dead before, it’s not been spat on, Hogan leg-dropped, buried, exhumed, and Hogan leg-dropped again. Personally, I’ve always been more of a “words” guy. I write a decent letter, I can put together a pretty solid mix tape filled that is devoid of a track with a 13 second clip of the sounds of people going at it. Maybe I’m not as creative as I like to think I am. I suppose George Michael’s “I Want Your Sex” as track 1 isn’t as specific as a photo of my schlong, but I do what I can. Thank you, Anthony Weiner for making me seem like a wholesome guy. And all I had to do was not take pictures of my dong and mass message people with it.\n\n*Speaking of men behaving badly (and dongs), baseball phenom Bryce Harper broke an unwritten rule of baseball this week by showing up an opponent twice on the same place. Reports say that Harper lingered in the batter’s box watching one of his homeruns, then blew a kiss at the pitcher on his way towards home plate. My own reaction was similar to the whispering match between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in Stepbrothers: when I first heard the story, the first thing I said was “You don’t say that!”\n\nReactions to Harper’s behavior are mixed, with most baseball fans (myself included) crying foul, while the opinions of ESPN’s analysts range from Bobby Valentine’s “no big deal,” to Keith Law’s “there’s likely more to the story than we know,” to Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt’s advice, “act like you’re used to hitting them (home runs)… tone it down, just play the game.”\n\nSchmidt later added that if Harper’s manager won’t police him, then the game itself will. By “police,” I assume Schmidt was talking about headshot fastballs, benches clearing, and Harper earning a reputation as selfish player. What Schmidt is also acknowledging is the fact that no one player is bigger than the game itself. Baseball has a way of humbling even its best. Bryce Harper has always been talented, and he’s always been young. Hopefully, he will learn from this experience the same way that Lightning McQueen was able to learn valuable life lessons by being stuck in Radiator Springs for a week. I am almost positive that his great skills have made it so that he’s never struggled for an extended period of time on the diamond. I would kill someone to know what that is like. But even I know that you don’t disrespect other players, and more importantly, you don’t disrespect the game.\n\n*Since we’re here and all, I figured I could go with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence or the Gloria Estefan. Either way, I guess. According to IMDB.com, Bad Boys 3 has a release date of 2015. One can safely assume that Jerry Bruckheimer isn’t concerned with the prognostication of the Mayans.\n\nIt seems like it would make sense considering Smith is already working up on the third film in the Men in Black series right now. Besides, I think the world is sadly bereft of buddy cop movies with awesome action sequences and multi-million dollar over-the-top explosions. Since Murtaugh and Riggs decided that they were too old for this shit, Martin and Will carried the torch until Michael Bay decided to move on to making films about robots while destroying my childhood in the process. Aside: I saw the Transformers 3 trailer during the NBA finals game yesterday and I have no idea what the movie is supposed to be about. That’s not a good sign. I always tell my students that if a two-hour movie is chopped down to a 30-second clip and you still can’t make heads or tails of the story, that probably means there isn’t much story there. I don’t know what the tendril thing taking down the tower was supposed to be, but I guess I’ll find out. Can Optimus Prime avoid dying in this one? Thanks. More recently, “Hawaii 5-0” has tried to take the buddy-cop genre to the small screen, and while the show is wildly popular, I don’t buy the banter between Scott Caan and Lynnette’s boyfriend, Alex O’Loughlin. Neither of them is the straight man, and neither is the comic relief. They’re both a little of both. That doesn’t work. One is always cool (Mel Gibson and Will Smith) and the other is always lame (Danny Glover and Martin Lawrence). Even The Hangover exploited this relationship dynamic. You could argue that O’Loughlin’s McGarrett is supposed to be the cool guy, but Caan’s Dano isn’t lame. They’re mostly the same guy.\n\nThat’s why despite not having anything in common at all really, my wife and I seem to work. She’s the cool one, and I am happy to be the lame comic relief. The spotlight can only shine brightly on one. That’s the only way it works. Ask LeBron and D-Wade.\n\n1. When Femme Nu was included in Hawaii 5-0, did they have to pay for the publicity and exposure? If so, did they pay with stacks of $1 bills?\n\n2. I’m almost positive that the reason everything costs so much in Hawaii is because the tax payers are funding the unbelievable technological resources and chic furnishings afforded the 5-0.\n\n3. Will the construction of the rail affect the complete lack of traffic on the show?\n\n4. Why the hell wasn’t I notified when they staged a fake comic book convention? I would have called in sick at work to show up in some kind of stupid costume and ogle women in even stupider costumes. Lynnette, if you’re reading this I meant ogle comic books.\n\n5. In the interest of fairness and harsh realism I immediately start the petition to have James Hong and Gerald Okamura guest star on the show in the same episode. It’s only fair. They could be old-school gangsters. I imagine a scene in which they are sitting at a large table in a large room surrounded by goons. Rival gang members arrive and the goons make a show to move. Hong waves them off and he and Okamura get up from their seats. The immediately kick ass. Sure, it might look like a Hulk Hogan/Ric Flair match (today, not 20 years ago), but it would be more believable. Just look at them.\n\n6. When the final confrontation between McGarrett and Wo Fat finally comes, will they do everyone a favor by having Mark Dacascos break out his capoeira? I mean they’ll already have the beach and tropical setting. They’re two pairs of white, baggy pants away from 1993. Zoom zoom.\n\n7. Would it be so hard for the writers to come up with another episode in which Grace Park has to get down to her underwear and/or a bikini again? I feel lied to. She was in both during the pilot and it led me to believe that this would be a regular occurrence. Shame on them. Can I get a bulletproof tube top? Let’s be fair, though. She rarely shows up in the show in any capacity. She’s pretty much McGarrett’s Uhura. She just calls him on the phone and tells him crap. That’s a serious misallocation of talent.\n\n8. How did Scott Caan get nominated for an Emmy? Daniel Dae Kim comes as close to “local” as I’ve ever seen a non-local star play. Kim ends sentences with words like “kid,” and he even does the thing where his voice trails off at the end of sentences. I understand the delicate balance: if they filled the show with true locals, 97% of the audience wouldn’t be able to understand them. That’s what makes Kim’s performance even more impressive, he can’t pass for moke-local, but he pulls off the “I’m-not-from-here-but-I’ve-been-here-long-enough-to-pick-up-subtle language-quirks-that-would-make-me-unrecognizable-to-my-friends-and-family-back-home” pretty damn well.\n\n9. Would it be so hard to include some random real places-and not just in passing-for crimes and lengthy scenes to take place? I would like to humbly suggest: finding a suspect in a viewing booth at Video Warehouse in Aiea, McGarrett playing on the Wrecking Crew at CORP during Monday nights, picking up the breakfast special at Mitsu-Ken in Kalihi, later going for dessert at Ice Garden in Aiea, the top floor of Dave and Busters’ on Wednesday Night (Dano looking for action), a shoot out in the Ocean Club followed by a high-speed chase which ends at Miki’s in Pearl City (Kono and Chin-Ho celebrate with teri-meatballs), and finally, they should do a 4-episode story arc during which would require the show to film at Damien from Monday’s through Fridays from 8:00-2:35 (at least), and of course, this would be a closed set. Shucks.\n\nMy friend Brett suggested that since it is Super Bowl week, Law and Order:SVU should do a “ripped from the headlines” story revolving around a professional quarterback named Reyn Boethlisberger who is accused by a young woman of unwanted sexual advances. Another of our friends, Brad, also got into it suggesting that the true culprit be revealed (you know, the traditional twist ending) as William Cowherd, a man possessed of a rather large chin.\n\nOf course, this is simply the very basic outline of the episode. Because I am an idiot gifted with a certain level of creativity, I will take it upon myself to cast and plot the episode here in this space. This is exactly the kind of nonsense that I feed off of.\n\nAs per the usual, any similarities to any persons living or dead is purely coincidental. And like Miss Cleo’s psychic services I will of course, be including existing cast members on SVU, but truth be told, I haven’t watched the show in so long that I have no idea who’s still on. I am going to include Richard Belzer because I’ve always liked him. I will also retain Ice T because of the comedy value of the opening credits in which all the other actors have human names like “Mariska Hargitay” which serve as a stark contrast for the picture of the erstwhile rapper with his name listed simply as “Ice T.” Also, Ice T maintains the street cred of this episode. Let’s do this.\n\nReyn Boethlisberger: Adam Sandler is the special guest star playing the lead role. I have selected Sandler because of his experience playing a quarter back in The Longest Yard and a linebacker in The Waterboy. Also, since this role is such a departure from anything he’s ever done, it would allow me to market the show and more specifically his appearance with something like “Adam Sandler… as you’ve never seen him before.” This could be new ground for Sandler. Instead of making different variations of the same insipid movie from now until eternity, this role could potentially demolish the stereotype that he’s willingly built for himself. Well, no, probably not, but I would still love to see Sandler attempt to play something other than a lovable idiot. I think “alleged rapist” is about as far as one could get from that. Also, it’s been a while since I’ve seen him do his gibberish routine (like during the business dinner scene in Billy Madison) and I would have him go into a lengthy version of it while on the stand in order to create his insanity defense.\n\nThe opening scene, the infamous “body discovered by unsuspecting innocents” or “we see a shady situation being set up, don’t actually see the crime, then day turns to night and we see the results of said scene the next morning,” will include an attractive-but not overly beautiful-young woman running down a street at night. She is nearly naked, wearing torn clothing. She is sobbing and her mascara is running almost as recklessly as she is. She runs into a sports cards store and starts screaming at the owner to help her. When the owner asks “What happened?” She says “He rapped me!” (an especially heinous crime) and points to a life-sized cardboard cut out of Boethlisberger. Fade to credits.\n\nWilliam Cowherd: A former coach of the alleged rapist and also a “person of interest” in the overall case. Many episodes feature the “initial suspect that falls away because of some kind of complication or twist roughly 13 minutes in,” and I envision Sgt. Slaughter in that role. Benson and Stabler track him down to a gym where he’s telling a few of the younger guys how he saved the world from Cobra-La with a little help from Cobra Commander after he had completed his transformation into a snake. He has the physical size to get into a broil with Stabler, and it would be high comedy to involve him a chase scene somehow.\n\nWhen I imagine him running down a Manhattan street in his black wrestling singlet with his whistle bouncing up and down on his chest I giggle to myself. I am giggling right now. When he is finally caught (21 seconds later), he will be thrown into that green brick room for interrogation. Stabler will initially start it, but Slaughter’s competitive nature won’t allow him to give any ground. Richard Belzer will then be brought in to the room. Because of the size advantage, Slaughter won’t perceive the sarcastic Belzer as a threat and will let slip that there were rumors of Boethlisberger’s questionable behavior even back when he was coaching (a few years ago). When Belzer squeezes, Cowherd/Slaughter points him in the direction of Boethlisberger’s current coach, Spike Tomlyn.\n\nSpike Tomlyn: Boethlisberger’s current coach is in the middle of running a practice when Belzer-with Ice T in tow-show up on the practice field. Belzer asks if he can have a minute of Tomlyn’s (played by Omar Epps, who spent zero time in make-up for this role) time to which he replies, “Yo, I’m in the middle of running a practice. We play the Baltimore Wire (since I can’t actually use the NFL, I figure I may as well throw out a reference to the best TV SHOW EVER) this Sunday. We don’t got Reyn. I can’t be messing with y’all.” Tomlyn then turns his back on the two officers.\n\n“Hey!” Ice T shouts. Tomlyn turns. Ice T raises a picture of the badly beaten victim and says, “You gonna have a pretty damn hard time trying to beat The Wire without your quarterback and the head coach. Bitch.” Tomlyn sighs. He waves for an assistant to take over supervision of the drills. “Alright…what do you want to know?” The conversation turns towards those rumors Cowherd had mentioned earlier. “How long has this been going on?” Belzer asks. “His rookie year?” Tomlyn shakes his head. “He was always this way…” He stares out onto the field and silently watches his players. He laughs softly, more to himself than anything. “Jerry Bradshaw.” Both detectives’ eyes widen. “The Hall of Famer?” Belzer says. “He was Reyn’s mentor. Taught Reyn everything he knows…not just football.”\n\nJerry Bradshaw: A Hall of Famer who now holds a job as a TV analyst, Bradshaw has called in sick to the set this morning, despite the network needing to tape pre-game segments. Like clockwork, as the two detectives walk out of the studio, a call comes in over the radio. Bradshaw is holed up in a seedy motel with a hostage-a young woman.\n\nIce T and Belzer meet Benson and Stabler on the scene and the camera pans to the fourth floor of the motel. A man shouts. A woman screams. Benson over the megaphone. Bradshaw appears in the window. He leans out over the sill, raises his right hand, rotates it several times next to his head before placing it next to his ear. He’s toying with them. “Whatcha gonna do, brother?” Bradshaw shouts. Benson tells him the motel is surrounded. Bradshaw’s next act of defiance is to tear his yellow and black t-shirt in half. A sniper takes a shot and misses. Barely.\n\nNext scene: stairwell adjacent to the door to the room Bradshaw is in. SWAT team in position. Stabler, Benson, and Belzer in vests, Ice T-leather jacket, no vest. That’s just how he rolls. “Jerry Bradshaw!” Benson shouts. “I’ve got a SWAT team out here. We’re going to come crashing down and make it hurt inside…the room.” Woman screams. A single shot. The scream is cut off. SWAT enters the room. Fade to black, automatic gunfire.\n\nFinal scene: Boethlisberger on practice field, walking towards the locker room. He’s been acquitted of all charges. As he walks near the stands, a young woman asks for his autograph. “How ’bout coffee instead?” he says. Fade to black.\n\nCreated by\n\nDick Wolf"
