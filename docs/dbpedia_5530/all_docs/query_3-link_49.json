        "text": "Speculating on the rumors surrounding pro wrestling is a favored pastime of many fans, perhaps second only to actually watching the matches. In this daily column, we take a look at the latest rumors being churned out by the pro wrestling rumor mill.\n\nImportant reminder: Rumors are just that — rumors. None of this has been confirmed as fact, it’s just circulating around the pro wrestling rumor mill. We track rumor accuracy in a weekly feature called Rumor Look Back you can find here. Remember, take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nRumors for the Day:\n\nAccording to WrestleVotes, sources say one idea discussed for the “impending return” of Roman Reigns is that he will claim to be “The Original Tribal Chief” in response to Solo Sikoa’s takeover of The Bloodline.\n\nThe Wrestling Observer Newsletter mentions that “most of those we heard from were sympathetic” towards Britt Baker after she was suspended by AEW following a backstage confrontation with MJF.\n\nWRKD Wrestling claims John Cena vs. GUNTHER is “currently penned in as a marquee PLE match” during Cena’s WWE retirement tour.\n\nPW Insider says “the word making the rounds in Hollywood” is there is “considerable steam” for making a movie named KILLING GAWKER, which is based on the Hulk Hogan vs. Gawker court case. It sounds like the idea is for Ben Affleck to be cast as Hulk Hogan, with Matt Damon playing the role of Peter Thiel.\n\nThe Observer says Kyle Fletcher was a late replacement for the angle with MJF on this week’s Dynamite. The person who AEW originally contacted for that spot is “a very big physically impressive wrestler” who “doesn’t work for the company and never has.” That wrestler could not commit to doing the two week program with MJF due to a scheduling conflict, so AEW went with Fletcher instead.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Masked Man Show, Jey Uso said his twin brother Jimmy “will be back soon” on WWE television."
