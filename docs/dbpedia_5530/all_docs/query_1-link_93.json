        "text": "Marvel superstar Chris Hemsworth has signed on to play professional wrestling icon Hulk Hogan in an upcoming project, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nDetails are scant at this stage, but the movie will reportedly focus on the early stages of Hogan’s epic career, which means the biopic may potentially leave out critical moments in wrestling history, such as the creation of the New World Order, or Hogan’s recent controversies.\n\nHemsworth is the only announced member of the cast so far, so the FTW staff did producers a favor by coming up with a list of the most important characters from the Hulkamania era, along with our casting suggestion for each role.\n\nThe Big Show as Andre The Giant\n\nIt seems entirely possible that the movie could climax with Hogan’s body slam of Andre The Giant at WrestleMania III, so getting this casting decision correct is crucial. “The Big Show” Paul Wight is the perfect choice. He’s got the same body type, tons of wrestling experience, and was even billed as Andre The Giant’s son early in his career.\n\nMichael Shannon as Vincent K. McMahon\n\nThis is a bit of an off-kilter choice, I realize. But Vince McMahon was and remains a cocky businessman who’s always teetering on the edge of losing control. Michael Shannon has made a career playing quietly assured straight men teetering on the edge of losing control. Slightly different, but I think Shannon can play up the cockiness for the role and have FUN with it. I smell an Oscar. – Nate Scott\n\nGerard Butler as Roddy Piper\n\nButler’s already got the look and the voice, he just needs to be able to match Piper’s epic promos.\n\nJoe Manganiello as Macho Man Randy Savage\n\nThe True Blood and Spider-Man actor does a great Macho Man impersonation, and he even shared the ring with Hulk Hogan on an episode of Raw in 2014.\n\nBrie Larson as Miss Elizabeth\n\nBrie Larson is probably too talented just to play a trophy wife, but if anyone can give that role depth and meaning, it’s her. – Hemal Jhaveri\n\nTony Shalhoub as Mean Gene Okerlund\n\nJust imagine Shalhoub in his “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” look. Now put a bald wig on him and maybe add 15 pounds. You see it, don’t you? Also the former “Monk” star can transform for any role, and I could see him speeding up his speech to match Mean Gene’s cadence. – Charles Curtis\n\nJohn Cena as The Ultimate Warrior\n\nCena will probably be bummed that he wasn’t cast to play Hogan after his excellent SNL impersonation, but he could potentially go over on Chris Hemsworth if the movie includes WrestleMania VI, where the Ultimate Warrior defeated Hogan in a classic champion vs. champion match.\n\nChanning Tatum as Sgt. Slaughter\n\nAnother classic WWE character who needs to show up in the background at some point. Slaughter, another top face in wrestling at the time, was overshadowed by Hogan at the height of his popularity, and eventually turned heel for a feud that resulted in a WrestleMania match.\n\nRusev as The Iron Sheik\n\nThe current WWE star is asking for any part he can get, and of the characters most likely to appear in a Hogan biopic, Iron Sheik is the best fit.\n\nThe Miz as Ric Flair\n\nHogan feuded with Flair early on in his WCW days, and won the World Heavyweight Championship in his very first WCW match against The Nature Boy.\n\nCharlie Day as Jimmy Hart\n\n“The Mouth of the South” briefly managed Hogan at the end of his stint in WWE, and followed him over to WCW. You need a wild card in this role, and Charlie Day’s already got the southern accent down.\n\nBig Cass as Kevin Nash\n\nKevin Nash is still in good enough shape to play himself, so that’s also an option.\n\nJon Bernthal as Scott Hall\n\nWho better to play The Bad Guy than Shane from The Walking Dead?\n\nKeanu Reeves as Sting\n\nWho else could play Sting?\n\nThe Rock as The Rock"
