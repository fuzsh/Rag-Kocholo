        "text": "Benji Gregory, who starred as a child in the hit television series “ALF” from 1986 to 1990, has died. He was 46.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his sister, Rebecca Pfaffinger, who said in an interview that Mr. Gregory and his service dog were found dead in his car on June 13 at a bank’s parking lot in Peoria, Ariz., and that the family did not announce the death sooner to take time to mourn. In a Facebook post, she added that he had fallen asleep in the vehicle and had died of heatstroke.\n\nMr. Gregory was known mainly for his role as Brian Tanner on “ALF,” an NBC sitcom about a suburban family that adopts a snout-nosed, Chewbacca-like “alien life form” (the basis of the character’s nickname) with the personality of a PG-rated insult comic. Brian is something like ALF’s younger sibling and best friend.\n\nWhen RadioShack attempted to relaunch its brand in 2014, it aired a Super Bowl commercial in which a store employee answers the phone; announces, “The ’80s called; they want their store back”; and then watches helplessly as Cliff from “Cheers,” Chucky, Hulk Hogan and ALF loot the shelves. In an ’80s-themed Delta in-flight safety video the same year, a sunglasses-wearing passenger applies an oxygen mask to himself first before fitting one around ALF’s snout.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
