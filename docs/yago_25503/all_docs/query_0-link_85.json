Rapture (rap'chur) 1. ecstatic joy or delight. 2. a state of extreme sexual ecstasy. 3. the feeling of being transported to another sphere of existence. 4. the experience of being spirited away to Heaven just before the Apocalypse. Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny star in this provocative and haunting film about a lonely, sex-obsessed telephone operator who discovers faith--and where that faith leads--The Rapture.",

[Full review in Spanish]\n\nJanuary 4, 2023\n\nIt's one of the most terrifying of religious films; an astounding synthesis of style and subject, it merges the meticulously practical and the terrifyingly visionary with a breathtaking audacity.\n\nOctober 30, 2020\n\nIt is all original, interesting, sympathetic and not at all moving.\n\nAugust 30, 2018\n\nOne of the strangest little films of 1991.\n\nApril 10, 2018\n\nThe Rapture is far from perfect, but it's a riveting act of provocation.\n\nFebruary 7, 2018"
