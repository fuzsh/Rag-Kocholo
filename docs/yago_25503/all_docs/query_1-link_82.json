        "text": "I’m a big apocalypse fan. I mean, I hope I’m not around if or when the whole thing goes down, but I find those sorts of stories to be endlessly fascinating. Whether it’s global warming or Mayan predictions, the notion of the end and of how people deal with it just gets my brain humming.\n\nOne of the most interesting concepts to me is that of the Rapture – the idea that all those who accept Jesus Christ as their lord and saviour leave all their earthly possessions behind and are accepted into heaven, right before the arrival of the Anti-Christ. It’s all Book of Revelations type stuff, and make for some interesting stories, such as the Left Behind series of books (even though they get REALLY preachy). I often discuss the Rapture with an atheist-scientist friend of mine, who himself admits that should something like it occur, he’d be hard pressed to find a scientific explanation. I love winning that discussion.\n\nSo, yes, I’m a huge sucker for these sorts of stories, and crave a great film that draws upon it for a story. Sadly, Rapture-Palooza is not that great film.\n\nFind out why after the jump!\n\nHere’s the truth – I stopped watching this film, staring Craig Robinson as the Anti-Christ and the almost always charming Anna Kendrick as our protagonist, Lindsay. In Rapture-Palooza, the Rapture has indeed occurred and the Anti-Christ has taken over the world. It’s supposed to be a comedy, but I don’t actually think there’s anything funny about the End Times. It doesn’t exactly scream comedy; and maybe it could be funny, except that would mean you would have to have a funny script. Which Rapture-Palooza doesn’t have – it has a litany of curse words in place of dialogue, and absolutely obvious attempts at “comedy”. Even Kendrick couldn’t deliver her lines and performances without looking horribly bored and wondering, how did I get involved in this film?\n\nSo the Queen and I quit after about 30 minutes or so, maybe 35 minutes. It was simply horrible. So, this is really a review of those minutes that were stolen from my life. Because, when it comes to the audience Rapture-Palooza is after, I’m the demo! I wanted to watch this movie, I wanted to enjoy it. But when a Rapture/Apocalypse-holic like myself has to turn the film off and go to bed, you know you have failed something awful."
