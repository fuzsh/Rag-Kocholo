        "text": "The Left Behind series of end times novels is one of the most successful literary franchises in modern Christian publishing. It lays out the dominant evangelical eschatology (i.e. study of the end times) in political thriller genre. In fact, it was so successful that it became a film franchise as well. And who better to play the young journalist in the series, Buck Williams, than Kirk Cameron? He was the right age, had the acting chops, and the name recognition that sent a signal that these would be real movies, not an amateur effort. Alas, despite Kirk’s participation, the franchise did not persevere to the end but was cut short after three films - perhaps for the sake of the elect. An attempt at revivification with Nicolas Cage at the helm did not enrapture audiences.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the films or the books, you are probably familiar with the basics of the story: The 'rapture', a sudden disappearance of Christians around the globe, sets in motion a series of physical, social, geopolitical, and spiritual disasters. A political-religious leader, 'the anti-Christ', becomes the leader of a world government and the head of a syncretistic world religion… Nuclear war in the Holy Land… Theology ripped from the headlines… The good guys lose, the bad guys win... Then history ends with the Second Coming.\n\nFor modern American evangelicals, this account of the end of history, known as dispensational premillennialism, pretty much comes as the default setting on their spiritual software. It's so pervasive that most evangelicals I've talked to about it don't even know there's another view. To the degree that there are disagreements, they are between a pre-tribulational and a post-tribulational rapture (in short hand: Does the rapture occur before or after all the bad stuff?) and perhaps a bit of wrangling over whether it's going to happen pretty soon or very soon. It's a quirk of history that a system of theology which basically didn't appear until the late 1800s and was seen by most of Christendom as a highly suspicious newcomer happened to get aligned with some high-profile evangelists and with a cultural mood among fundamentalists of pessimism. This has helped move it to near monopoly status in the world of Christian pop-culture.\n\nI noticed that Kirk Cameron, who described himself as 'the Left Behind guy', seemed to be sending out signals of cultural optimism. The famous dictum from a radio preacher that 'you don't polish the brass on a sinking ship' didn't seem to jibe with Cameron's message of hope as presented in his Revive Us theatrical events. So in a recent interview I asked him if he had left behind Left Behind.\n\nHis answer: \"I don't see anything in the Scriptures saying that defeat was inevitable.\" Wow. That’s big. In my spiritual experience, when you join up, you get your Four Spiritual Laws, your 'Sinners Prayer' and then your prophecy secret decoder ring. And in no version of that prophecy story is defeat for the Church anything but inevitable: Anti-Christ, 666, computer chips in the hand (or the forehead for amputees), global government, mushroom clouds over Israel, the end. If all that is inevitable then what would be the point of trying to 'disciple the nations'? The nations are doomed to be the disciples of a blood-thirsty global tyrant. As Kirk put it, this version of the story gives Christians pretty much one job, \"Get my kids and neighbors into the life boat and rescue them from the sinking ship.\"\n\nIn contrast to this truncated version of the Gospel, Cameron maintains that it is the job of the Church, \"…to push back darkness and stop corruption and disciple nations with the power that raised Him from the dead in a kingdom which wins; it doesn't lose. Greater is He who is within us than he that is in the world.\" In other words, go ahead and polish the brass. Swab the decks, scrape the hull, stoke the coal, grab the wheel and full-steam ahead. This ship is going forward, not down.\n\nCameron lays out the idea that there have been a plurality of schools of eschatology over the centuries and that Christians should be aware of that before defaulting to one in particular. And no matter which one you land on, don’t use it as an excuse for cultural paralysis and world-aversion. Earlier generations of Christians worked together to free slaves, not just to evangelize them. They polished the tarnished brass of Christendom which had somehow allowed itself to be stained with the blood of human chattel.\n\nI'm not going to take sides in the eschatological debates. I make a practice never to pontificate on any topic that already has one of those 'Four Views' books. But I am a strong advocate of opening up that conversation so that Christians can choose wisely among alternative views rather than just accepting the one which happens to have been held by televangelists with the biggest megaphones. That seems to be what Cameron is asking for: consider an alternative view and don't let eschatology paralyze you."
