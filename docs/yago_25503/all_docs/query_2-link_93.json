        "text": "We’ve discussed it before, but let’s quickly reiterate: Intellectual Property (IP) is where it’s at for Hollywood, but when you can’t really make a sequel about a classic drama that has a lot of vintage IP—like “The Godfather” which just turned 50 recently—another avenue is making a movie or series about the making of a classic film. Take Paramount+’s “The Offer,” their mini-series about making “The Godfather.”\n\nREAD MORE: The American Dream Of ‘The Godfather’ At 50\n\nAnd yes, director Francis Ford Coppola is a big part of that story, but the tale Paramount is really telling is the entire behind-the-scenes picture which in many ways centers more on the producers that helped bring it to the screen.\n\n“The Offer”—a play on the iconic “show him an offer he can’t refuse” line from “The Godfather” series stars Miles Teller as producer Albert S. Ruddy, Matthew Goode as producer Robert Evans, Juno Temple as Ruddy’s assistant Bettye McCartt, Giovanni Ribisi as Italian crime boss Joe Colombo who didn’t want the movie to happen because he thought it was terrible for the Italian community, Dan Fogler as Francis Ford Coppola, Burn Gorman as former Paramount chief Charles Bluhdorn, Colin Hanks as Barry Lapidus, a Gulf & Western executive with a lot of power over Paramount Pictures, and Patrick Gallo as Mario Puzo, the author of “The Godfather” novel. Who plays Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, etc? Actors like Justin Chambers and Anthony Ippolito, both of whom aren’t exactly household names, but that’s almost beside the point because they’re only one element of a much bigger picture.\n\nREAD MORE: Welcome The New Trend Of ‘Prestige IP’: Studios Are Mining Their Vaults To Keep Franchises Going\n\nFrom Paramount Television Studios, the 10-episode event series is written and executive produced by Nikki Toscano (“Hunters”), who serves as showrunner, and created and written by Oscar- and Emmy-nominated writer Michael Tolkin (“Escape at Dannemora,” “The Player”). In addition to Tolkin and Toscano, two-time Oscar winner Albert S. Ruddy (“Million Dollar Baby,” “The Longest Yard,” “Hogan’s Heroes”), Miles Teller, Russell Rothberg, and Leslie Greif, who also developed the series, serve as executive producers alongside Dexter Fletcher (“Rocketman”), who also directed the first block of the series.\n\n“The Offer” will premiere on April 28, on Paramount+ subscribers in the U.S. The first three episodes of the 10-episode-long series will be available to stream at launch. Following the premiere, the remaining seven episodes will be available to stream weekly on Thursdays. Watch the new trailer below."
