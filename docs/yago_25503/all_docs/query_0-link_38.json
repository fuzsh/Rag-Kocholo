You're in pain, instead of doing heroin, you're doing God.\n\nSharon, don't you understand what's going on? The world's a disaster. We have no power to make it better. You hate your job; you hate your life; but you want to feel special. Instead of letting me do that, you're rushing off to something that's not even there.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nVic: You fell in love!\n\nSharon: Yes.\n\nVic: Wait 'til he finds out about you.\n\nSharon: Oh, he knows all about me.\n\nVic: Is he as bad a boy as I am?\n\nSharon: I think you should meet him.\n\nVic: You told him about me?\n\nSharon: I told you. He knows everything.\n\nVic: He's rich, right, he's some rich guy and you fell for some line of his.\n\nSharon: You could love him too, Vic.\n\nVic: You fell for some rich homosexual!\n\n[doubles up laughing]\n\nSharon: He's the Lord Jesus Christ, Vic. He's the Son of God.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nThe Rapture (film) quotes at the Internet Movie Database\n\nThe Rapture (film) at Rotten Tomatoes"
