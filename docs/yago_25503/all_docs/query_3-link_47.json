The film, which reboots intrigue in the series, comes as interest in eschatology reaches a fever pitch.\n\nThe actor pointed to current events when asked why he believes end times themes pique so much interest, highlighting growing “hate and divisiveness” and other cultural chaos.\n\nBring Charisma magazine home with a subscription today! {eoa}"
