        "text": "The making of the The Godfather, widely praised as one of the all-time great American films, is recounted in the Paramount+ series The Offer.\n\nTold from the perspective of producer Albert S. Ruddy, portrayed by Miles Teller, the series counts Michael Tolkin (Escape at Dannemora) as series creator, with direction from Dexter Fletcher (Rocketman). It’s an in-depth look at the turbulent path to creating The Godfather, the 1972 Paramount Pictures film that won three Oscars, including best actor for Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, and recently celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nAhead of The Offer premiering April 28 on Paramount+, check out photos of the stars opposite their real-life counterparts, including Dan Fogler as director Francis Ford Coppola, Anthony Ippolito as Al Pacino and Grey’s Anatomy alum Justin Chambers as Brando."
