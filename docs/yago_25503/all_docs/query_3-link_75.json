        "text": "\"Left Behind,\" a movie based on Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye's rapture-themed book series, will hit theaters on Oct. 3, Dave McNary at Variety reports.\n\nThe film, which is a reboot of the \"Left Behind\" movie released 14 years ago, includes big-name stars such as Nicolas Cage, Chad Michael Murray and Jordin Sparks.\n\nCage says he accepted the lead role in \"Left Behind\" because it was \"challenging and unusual\" for him. He wants the film to spark conversation. \"My greatest hope ... is that it works as something that people will be entertained and thrilled by, but they'll also go home and they'll have conversations with their family and they'll ask 'do you think this could happen or couldn't happen' and it'll inspire discussions and closeness,\" Cage says in Variety's article.\n\n\"Left Behind\" writer and producer Paul LaLonde says he decided to reboot the movie because he thinks it can be \"bigger and better\" and reach a wider group of viewers, according to Billy Hallowell at The Blaze.\n\nLaLonde believes \"Left Behind\" will be different than other religious films because of its production value. He says religious audiences will enjoy the transparency of the message. \"I think a lot of the core Christian audience ... (is) going to be surprised at the clarity with which we presented the rapture,\" he says in Blaze's article. \"I think people are expecting it to be completely buried and barely mentioned.\"\n\nThe movie was filmed on a $16 million budget from August to October 2013 in Louisiana, according to the \"Left Behind\" film website. The events in the movie take place after the rapture occurs (causing righteous Christian believers to disappear) and follows the stories of a group of individuals who are left in a turbulent world.\n\n\"Left Behind\" will be shown on about 1,800 screens. Filmmakers plan to create sequels to the new movie.%3Cimg%20src%3D%22http%3A//beacon.deseretconnect.com/beacon.gif%3Fcid%3D159242%26pid%3D46%22%20/%3E"
