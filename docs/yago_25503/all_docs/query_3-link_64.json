        "text": "Not to be confused with the similarly named computer game, Left Behind 3: Rise of the Antichrist.\n\nLeft Behind: Rise of the Antichrist is a 2023 Christian thriller film based on Left Behind by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, the first book in the Left Behind book series. It is a direct sequel to Left Behind (2014) with an entirely different cast. It was directed by Kevin Sorbo and theatrically released as a limited four-day on January 26th, 2023 to select theaters as part of Fathom Events. The film stars Kevin Sorbo, Neal McDonough, and Corbin Bernsen.\n\nPlot[]\n\nWhen millions of people suddenly vanished in the Rapture, the world was plunged into a state of emergency. Financial markets collapsed, governments toppled and a worldwide lock down ensued.\n\nNow, six months later, people are just beginning to recover from the trauma. So when a so-called ‘expert’ claims that a second wave of vanishings is imminent, news anchor Cameron ‘Buck’ Williams (Greg Perrow) sets out to disprove her theory. Against the wishes of his boss, Steve Plank (Corbin Bernsen), and his network, Buck teams up with hacker Dirk Burton (Stafford Perry) and together they stumble onto a conspiracy to take control of the global money supply led by billionaire media magnate Jonathon Stonagal (Neal McDonough).\n\nAt the same time, Buck’s girlfriend Chloe Steele (Sarah Fisher) and her father, Rayford Steele (Kevin Sorbo), are on a very different journey. Ray believes that his wife’s disappearance was, in fact, the Rapture, but what does that mean? What can he do now, and how can he convince Chloe? Desperate for answers in a world where Biblical Truth has been censored and vilified, Ray finally finds the answers he is looking for in the last place he would have expected to find them.\n\nCast[]\n\nKevin Sorbo as Rayford Steele, Sr.\n\nGreg Perrow as Cameron Williams\n\nSarah Fisher as Chloe Steele\n\nKathryn Kohut as Hattie Durham\n\nCharles Andrew Payne as Bruce Barnes\n\nMark Bellamy as Vernon Billings\n\nNeal McDonough as Jonathan Stonagal\n\nBailey Chase as Nicolae Carpathia\n\nCorbin Bernsen as Steve Plank\n\nDavid LeReaney as Chaim Rosenzweig\n\nSam Sorbo as Amanda White\n\nBraeden Sorbo as Connor\n\nStafford Perry as Dirk Burton\n\nLinda Kee as Ivy Gold\n\nPaul Cowling as Joshua Todd-Cothran\n\nShawna Pliva McGill as Ana Quintero\n\nJesse Lipscombe as Ted Tossel\n\nProduction[]\n\nFilming was expected to begin in Autumn 2015 for a tentative release in 2016 as a Indiegogo fundraiser was made to raise money for the film, but it only raised $80,699 of a $500,000 goal with 534 contributors. However, a 2nd fundraiser started on July 22nd on the Left Behind Movie website.\n\nIn 2017, producer Paul Lalonde announced on the film's Facebook page that he has purchased the rights to all 16 books of the series. He explained that he had been \"handicapped\" to the first two books in the series and will now be able to finally tell the story with a plan for a series of 7 films covering the books in their entirety.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAfter nine years since the 2014 film, this is the longest period for a direct sequel. This will be seven years after Vanished which was more of an alternate perspective remake which might potentially receive its own sequels.\n\nIvy Gold is a character who was created for the original film trilogy and is based on the book’s Alice Nelson.\n\nThis movie takes place 6 months after the rapture.\n\nDespite the similar title to the third book, Nicolae: The Rise of Antichrist, this film is an adaption of the first book, Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days.\n\n[]"
