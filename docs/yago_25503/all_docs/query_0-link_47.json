        "text": "American screenwriter, novelist, and director (born 1950)\n\nMichael L. Tolkin (born October 17, 1950) is an American screenwriter, novelist, and director. He has written numerous screenplays, including The Player (1992), which he adapted from his own 1988 novel of the same name,[2] and for which he received the Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay (1993) and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He later wrote a follow-up to the novel, titled The Return of the Player, which was published in 2006.[3]\n\nIn 2018, Tolkin served as co-creator of the miniseries Escape at Dannemora with Brett Johnson.[4] The series was based on the real-life 2015 Clinton Correctional Facility escape that led to a massive manhunt for two escaped convicts in upstate New York. In 2022, he served as creator of the miniseries The Offer, which centered on the development of the 1972 film The Godfather.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nTolkin was born to a Romanian-Jewish and Ukrainian-Jewish family[5][6] in New York City, the son of Edith (née Leibovitch), a studio executive and film industry lawyer, and the late comedy writer Mel Tolkin.[7][8]\n\nHe is a 1974 graduate of Middlebury College.[1]\n\nTolkin lives in Los Angeles with his wife, author Wendy Mogel.
