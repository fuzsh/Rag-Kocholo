        "text": "Christian writers and filmmakers have created various interpretations of the end times, and although Christians should not depend on a movie as Gospel truth, films do inspire us to think, study, and investigate the scriptures for ourselves. This list of rapture movies about the end times will help you explore important biblical themes and imagine what the biblical end times might look like.\n\nSubscribe to the Pure Flix Insider: Where Faith and Entertainment Connect\n\nOne of the most well-known events in the end times is the “Rapture.” The Rapture is a prophetic event that is perhaps most widely known as the belief that God will supernaturally rescue Christians before the Tribulation period, a time characterized by chaos and destruction that unfolds as the end times kicks into high gear. Its theological elements make it a prime event for depiction on the big screen.\n\nThis idea of a so-called “pre-Tribulation Rapture” (a Rapture before the Tribulation period) is a widely accepted belief in many evangelical circles — but not everyone agrees that it’s a biblical slam-dunk. Some theologians and pastors flatly reject the idea that Jesus will usher believers off of the Earth before the Tribulation period, though, regardless of where Christians stand on the Rapture, the vast majority believe in a still-unfulfilled event known as the Second Coming — a time when Christ is expected to return to battle the Antichrist and establish His kingdom.\n\nIf you have questions about the rapture and the end times, you can explore the following list of powerful end times and rapture movies (plus: we have a helpful end-times theology guide you can download).\n\nRapture Movies to Stream Today\n\nThe Moment After\n\nThis is one of the end of the world movies you don't want to miss.
