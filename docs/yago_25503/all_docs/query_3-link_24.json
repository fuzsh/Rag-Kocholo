A fantastic piece of cinema, and definitely one of Martin Scorsese's most underrated works, in my view.\n\nI would also recommend the TV mini-series REVELATIONS, too, which you can see more about here. Although it's labelled as Season 1, it was only ever meant to be a 6-part mini-series. But it's enjoyably thrilling, with some intelligent plot points.\n\nPooch\n\n— As an Amazon Associate, AVForums earns from qualifying purchases —\n\nquarry2006\n\nProminent Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 24, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n4,499\n\nReaction score\n\n470\n\nPoints\n\n662\n\nSep 9, 2012\n\n#23\n\nThere is no book of revelations.
