        "text": "Book by Tim LaHaye\n\nThe Rapture: In the Twinkling of an Eye/Countdown to the Earth's Last Days is the 3rd prequel novel in the Left Behind series, written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins in 2006 and published by Tyndale House.[1] This book is the final of the three prequels and covers events leading up to the first book Left Behind. The narrative of the novel The Rapture includes events that take place during the first chapters of Left Behind and provides a backdrop story for the book Left Behind. The book was released on Tuesday, June 6, 2006 (6/6/6), which is the Number of the Beast, a concept that plays a large part later in the series. It takes place from 14 months before to the day of the Rapture. For the week of June 19, 2006, Publishers Weekly ranked it the 10th best selling book in the U.S.[1]\n\nThe stage is set as Nicolae Carpathia ruthlessly eliminates any obstacles in his rise to power. Pan-Con Airlines Captain Rayford Steele prepares for a flight to London with beautiful flight attendant Hattie Durham. Because of his wife's newfound faith, Rayford looks forward to time—and the possibilities—with Hattie.\n\nJournalist Cameron \"Buck\" Williams is in Israel when the Arab countries attack, and he experiences for himself the power of God when fire rains down from the sky, destroying the attackers. Even more, not a single casualty is reported in all of Israel. Buck cannot deny Chicago bureau chief Lucinda Washington's insistence that the event was prophesied in Ezekiel 38,39 and clearly of the supernatural, though he dares not consider the personal ramifications. Meanwhile, Nicolae Carpathia eliminates any obstacles in his path to power. As the newly appointed President of Romania, Nicolae is invited to speak before the UN.\n\nWithout warning, millions disappear and are inducted into Heaven, and believers from all over space and time reunite in the house of God, as prophesied in 1 Thessalonians 4:15–17. The Judgment Seat of Christ takes place and the saints of the ages are rewarded for their perseverance with crowns from Christ himself. They are followed into Heaven, where they see the glory prepared for them by the Lord. On Earth, some realize what has happened, what they have lost, what they have missed, and the world plunges into chaos as drivers, pilots, and pedestrians of all occupations go missing. Rayford's first officer, Chris Smith, is among the first to commit suicide in the wake of the disappearances and the ensuing chaos. Pastor Bruce Barnes is among those left behind, and the young pastor knows that the disappearances signal the beginning of the Tribulation.\n\nCaptain Rayford Steele\n\nChloe Steele\n\nCameron \"Buck\" Williams\n\nPastor Bruce Barnes\n\nSteve Plank\n\nAbdullah Ababneh aka Abdullah Smith\n\nPresident Nicolae Carpathia\n\nLeon Fortunato\n\nHattie Durham\n\nLoretta, mentioned as an older church secretary\n\nGerald Fitzhugh, the President of the United States\n\nGheorghe Vasile, the President of Romania\n\nAmanda White, Rayford's second wife she will appear in Tribulation Force\n\nChris Smith, The Co-pilot with Rayford the night of the Rapture\n\nJesus Christ\n\nRaymie Steele\n\nIrene Steele\n\nLucinda Washington\n\nPastor Vernon Billings"
