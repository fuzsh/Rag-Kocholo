        "text": "An unexpectedly serious investigation into spiritual malaise and religious fanaticism, The Rapture has difficulty walking the line between profundity and pretentiousness. Film nevertheless stands as a singular feature debut for writer-director Michael Tolkin, who demonstrates more talent than judgment.\n\nMimi Rogers plays Sharon, a beautiful young woman with no direction. She lives on the sexual edge in LA with her amoral b.f. (Patrick Bauchau), and in one of their group gropes meets Randy (David Duchovny).\n\nHer hot affair with him pushes her to peer into the spiritual abyss, which leads her to the Bible, prayer and ultimate acceptance of the Lord. Six years later, now a fervently devout married couple, Sharon and Randy are raising their daughter in the belief that the end is nigh. Sharon absconds with her daughter to the desert, where she awaits the rapture, the ultimate fulfillment of her religious beliefs that will unite her with her husband and God.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCenterscreen throughout, Rogers reduces everyone else in range to pawns and delivers one of those soul-baring turns that is both impressive and almost too much. Also notable is Bojan Bazelliâ€™s luminous lensing."
