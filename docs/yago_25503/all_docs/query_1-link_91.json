        "text": "What if the world follows the events of The Bible and “the end” does appear? That is the premise of Rapture-Palooza, a dark comedy depicting what happens after The Rapture and the lives and events of those who were not saved. Sounds like a great premise. Here’s the problem – the execution was so amateurish that it was cringingly painful to watch.\n\nRapture-Palooza has an all-star cast – Anna Kendrick, Ken Jeong as God, Craig Robinson as the Anti-Christ, Rob Corddry, John Michael Higgins, and Ana Gasteyer of Saturday Night Live. This should be a funny, funny film.\n\nBut it simply wasn’t.\n\nI love a great cynical take on the world we live in. I welcome a brave new interpretation of how human beings can carry on without religion. But like most things in this world, someone has great ideas, then the lack of experience, ingenuity, intuition and luck crash at the execution.\n\nThe film starts out with a man in a purple suit and a man in a white suit floating on their backs in a hot tub. Knowing that this will transition into a flashback with narration, it was Amateur City before it got started.\n\nI rested assured that since Anna Kendrick (Lindsey) is taking us through this journey, this shouldn’t be a problem.\n\nBut it was.\n\nThe entire cast felt as if they did this during the break of other more important and relevant projects. So The Rapture appears and sucked the souls from these humans to Heaven, some directly with them still sitting on the toilet. Those left are confused as the world is now tormented by grasshoppers with human heads condemning the humans, and English speaking crows cursing at them. Ana Gasteyer (Lindsey’s mother) was the only person in Lindsey’s family saved, but was sent back down to earth because of her constant judging of other people. That’s a funny premise – it is. Just thinking about it makes me laugh.\n\nBut it wasn’t funny while watching it. Lindsey carries on her merry little way with her boyfriend Ben, as they endured the occasional blood rain and flaming rocks falling from the sky. They got so used to these events they simply knew how to go stand under the doorway as if they were Californians in their daily routine of what happens when a tremor hits.\n\nSoon the anti-Christ appears, and he refers to himself as The Beast (Craig Robinson). The only funny part here is that Robinson is also in another film about the apocalypse which will open next week called This is The End.\n\nThe Beast curses constantly; treats women as if he was THE player. He meets Lindsey and wants her to be his wife.\n\nAs preposterous as it sounds, this does makes sense since this beast was as horny as it gets, and it was revealed that Lindsey was also a virgin. But the way the beast carried on throughout the film, Lindsey is absolutely implausible to be the one human to eventually doom his plans. This is Anna Kendrick, as Anna Kendrick, without any other special effects, make-up, or anything “revealing” to her character Lindsey. And this is Craig Robinson, who even composed a song all about the booty, as forward and crass as a dog gets. Let’s at least make the situation semi-believable.\n\nSo somehow we are forced to believe the beast will court Lindsey to bear his evil spawn. Of course Lindsey is appalled. Instead of saying “no”, she and Ben came up with a plan to kill The Beast and save humanity.\n\nDon’t get too excited; my description is much, much more exciting than what actually happens.\n\nTheir plan was to drug the beast and cage him in a kennel they’ve built in their backyard. ?! They would drug the guards and lured the protectors with weed.\n\nJust as ridiculous as the plan sounds, Jesus appears from the sky and Ben accidentally shoots him to death, disrupting the inevitable Second Coming and the show-down between Jesus and the devil. So God appears in Jesus’s place, played by Ken Jeong.\n\nAgain, this sounds fantastic on paper. Watching it, it was like a first reading from rehearsal with absolutely no real direction.\n\nSo God dukes it out with the devil but the two both die from electrocution in a hot tub.\n\nWow, I can imagine the eyes that lit up during the pitch before this project was green-lit.\n\nSo Lindsey and Ben, and the rest of the world, are now left to carry on without religion, and “just live”.\n\nI loved this premise. I had full intention of this being one of the rare gems of 2013. But the direction here completely took the script backwards as there were no real connections between the characters. I didn’t feel the connection between Lindsey and Ben. The two sort of just went through the motions. I didn’t feel the connection between the beast and his evil insanity to take over mankind. Ultimately, there was no real urgency for Lindsey and Ben to save the world because the world they existed in seems quite OK for everybody.\n\nKendrick was monotone the entire film through. Robinson, on the other hand, had two gears; calm/delight and loud/curse. There were funny moments here and there, but never truly enveloped for us to accept the premise and revel in all the great visuals that were simply could-have-beens.\n\nRapture-Palooza could have been saved with a progressive soundtrack; there wasn’t. It could have been visually stunning even without the budget; it wasn’t. The cast could have propelled the director with an out-of-the-ordinary performance since they’ve already committed to the project; they didn’t."
