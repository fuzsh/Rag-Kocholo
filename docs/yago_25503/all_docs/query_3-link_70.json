        "text": "Eschatological fiction has become very popular and influential the past decade, particularly the very successful Left Behind series of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. This literature infiltrates its readers, of whom many are Pentecostal, with a theological position and worldview, which does not seem in line with our biblical perception. It urges us to re-think our dispensational heritage and develop an eschatology that is compatible with our Pentecostal identity.\n\nThe editors of The Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2007-, http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/36686) have kindly allowed me to post the complete text of the entries for which I wrote the Islamic component. This is a very interesting scholarly project in which every entry contains multiple perspectives."
