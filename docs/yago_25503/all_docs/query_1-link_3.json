        "text": "A telephone operator lives an empty, amoral life. She and her boyfriend spend their evenings picking up other couples for group sex. But she begins to notice little things - things that point to something far greater than the life she knows. There are the two men who come to her apartment, preaching God; the conversation she overhears between her co-workers; and even a strange, mystical tattoo on the back of a woman joining one of the sex sessions. Eventually, a crisis of faith that nearly ends in suicide leads to her spiritual awakening instead. But later she learns that even after finding God, it's possible to lose Him again.â€”J. Spurlin\n\nSharon, a young Los Angeles woman, engages in a swinging, libidinous lifestyle. She comes into contact with an unnamed Christian sect that advises her the Rapture is imminent based on their interpretations of strange dreams experienced by congregants.\n\nIn time, Sharon comes to accept this belief herself and becomes a born-again Christian. She then starts living a pious life, eventually marrying and having a daughter, Mary. When her husband Randy is killed in a senseless murder, however, she begins to question the benevolence of God. She believes God has called her to go to the desert to wait for the Rapture, and instead of leaving her daughter safely with friends, she decides Mary must come with her. Foster, a police officer, is concerned for their well-being after they are reduced to stealing food while they wait, but Sharon is insistent that the end is near.\n\nSharon begins to despair after a period of time, and at her daughter's urging, decides to hasten their ascendance to Heaven. She kills Mary with a gunshot but is unable to take her own life afterwards, afraid she will be condemned as having killed herself. She confesses to Foster what she had done and is jailed.\n\nAfter an apparition of Mary (accompanied by two angels) appears in the night, the Rapture occurs. While Sharon sits in her cell early the next morning, a loud trumpet blast is heard all over the world, signaling the start of the Rapture. Later on, Sharon and Foster, after driving out into the desert, are both raptured to a Purgatory-like landscape. Foster, who had been an atheist his whole life, accepts God and is allowed entrance to Heaven, but Sharon blames God for Mary's death, even though God did not tell her to take Mary with her to the desert, and she cannot renounce her anger at what she sees as God's cruelty. Mary pleads with her to accept God back into her heart so she can join her and Randy in Heaven, but Sharon refuses, choosing to remain alone in the purgatory-like landscape for eternity."
