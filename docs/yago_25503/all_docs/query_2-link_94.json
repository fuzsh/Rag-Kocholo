        "text": "QUOTE:\n\nOh, how I loved Breakfast on Pluto! I had really wanted to see this when it came out. Even thought about going to a movie theater to do so. But didn't. Just a beautiful film with the added benefit of having two (count 'em -- TWO) Van Morrison songs in the soundtrack. Cillian Murphy is one beautiful actor! I loved that face before seeing any of his work and only having read some interviews. This is the first of his films I've seen but I will be keeping an eye on him. Wonderful to see Stephen Rea again even if he has visibly aged. Eek. Love that guy. All the supporting actors were splendid, the writing top-notch, the cinematography, music, makeup and costumes also fantastic. It did what a great film should do. Kept you wondering -- what's gonna happen next? And then, like all truly great films should do but rarely accomplish, it even has a good ending!\n\n***** Five stars -- 2 thumbs up -- A+\n\nSusan"
