        "text": "There are films which amuse and delight. And there are films which inspire, frighten and impress. And then, there is The Godfather, the 1972 crime film masterpiece, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, co-written by Coppola and Mario Puzo, on whose best-selling novel the film was based.\n\nThe film is close to unique in cinema history, a high benchmark shared by only a handful of masterpieces. Its cast included Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Richard Castellano, playing various members of the Corleone mafia family, their friends and rivals. It gave birth to a trilogy, though it is the original which remains truly unequalled.\n\nBritish actor Matthew Goode first saw The Godfather on video in his late teens, “actually rented from a local video shop in Clifton Mary,” he says, laughing. The actor grew up nearby, in Exeter, in south-west England. Almost 30 years later he has come full circle with that moment, with a starring role in The Offer, the dramatisation of the making of the film, a story almost as big as the film itself.\n\n“I fell in love with The Godfather immediately because I’d never seen anything shot like that before,” Goode says. “It’s pretty different to Predator, you know what I mean? And it gave me my appreciation for directors of photography, who I genuinely think are masters of the dark arts.\n\n“We’re very lucky to have it in that [single-film] format, and we’re very lucky that Coppola carved a different story out of the book,” Goode says. “The book was fine, the book is good, the book is readable, but the movie is something artistically on a different level. I can say that comfortably because I know that Mario has now passed away, and he’s not coming for me.”\n\nThe miniseries stars Goode as producer Robert Evans, Miles Teller as producer Albert S. Ruddy, Juno Temple as Ruddy’s assistant Bettye McCartt, Dan Fogler as writer/director Francis Ford Coppola, Patrick Gallo as novelist Mario Puzo, Burn Gorman as Gulf and Western owner Charles Bluhdorn, Colin Hanks as studio executive Barry Lapidus and Giovanni Ribisi as real-life crime family patriarch Joe Colombo.\n\nThe idea of creating historical narratives for television which contain fictional elements is not new. The Crown has been the subject of some criticism recently because of the way it smudges historical detail to suit the story. A more recent example, The Thing about Pam, went the opposite way and stuck to fact. The Offer is pure Hollywood, but Goode says the series is true to its promise.\n\n“I know that there have been questions about other series that have done this sort of thing, particularly when some people are still alive, but this was fact-checked to within an inch of its life and there’s very, very many sources that will be able to go, oh, that did happen,” Goode says.\n\n“Obviously, we’re not making a documentary, and so you’ll find that there are always, within this, those sorts of dramatisations,” Goode adds. “You’ll have composite characters, for example, Colin Hanks’ character was several naysayers, rather than just the one person who was Charlie Bluhdorn’s right-hand man, but ostensibly, it’s as close as we could get it.”\n\nIn tackling the role of Robert Evans, Hollywood offered Goode a multitude of people, still alive, who knew and worked with the man. But Goode was particularly struck by something Evans himself was famous for reminding people. “It’s like Bob would always say, there are three versions to anything. There’s your version, there’s my version and there’s the truth,” he says.\n\nMost intimidating, Goode says, was capturing Evans’ physicality and voice. “He has such a unique timbre and cadence, and that’s fascinating and terrifying at the same time because you’re like, if I don’t get this right, I’m going to get laughed off the screen.\n\n“Then luckily there was a day I was with Dexter [Fletcher, the director] and he’s like, you should be scared, but it’s a great story, it’s well written, we chose you because we think you can do the job, and then he just went, imagine how scared Anthony Ippolito is, he’s playing Al Pacino. And I was like, well, that does put it into perspective, a little bit.”\n\nAs a British-born actor Goode, like the Australian television audience who will watch The Offer, has a very specific perception of director Dexter Fletcher. Correctly identified as an actor/director, Fletcher’s earliest acting roles were playing Spike Thomson in the teen series Press Gang and Baby Face in the 1976 film Bugsy Malone, opposite then-kid stars Scott Baio and Jodie Foster.\n\n“He does everything, he’s doing the voiceover for McDonald’s, I can’t escape the man, he’s on the radio in my car,” says Goode, laughing. “He has a gift, he has a superpower and that is that he can spin plates. He can put his foot into every world. I’m so looking forward to working with him again if I’m lucky.\n\n“Dexter is a brilliant actor, he gets actors, he likes actors which is something because sometimes you work with a director, and you go, no, you shouldn’t be doing this job,” Goode says. “He’s just very, very smart, and I think, as you say, he’s been in this world, intoxicated by it and in love with it, since he was six years old.”\n\nFletcher set up the project, and directed its first two episodes. He was supposed to return for the final two, but a scheduling clash meant he could not. “And we mourned the loss of him, we wanted to finish this project for him because he gave us all this confidence,” Goode says.\n\n“We adored him. Everyone adored him, and I’ve never been on a set where everyone would say that because he treats everyone with the greatest of respect,” Goode says. “But it’s also how it should be on set. I’m completely in love with the man, I must say, and also his wife Dalia [Ibelhauptaitė, the opera and film director and playwright].“\n\nThe screenplay of The Offer was written by Michael Tolkin, the novelist. It is true, Goode agrees, that Tolkin’s work as a novelist sets him up well to bring to the screen the story of a novel as dense and epic as The Godfather. But Goode singles out one of Tolkin’s credits as being particularly critical in capturing the energy behind-the-scenes of the film.\n\nTolkin wrote both the book and screenplay of The Player, Robert Altman’s critically acclaimed 1992 satirical comedy, about a studio executive who kills an aspiring screenwriter. The film is largely noteworthy as being packed with Hollywood in-jokes.\n\n“So if anyone was going to be able to tell a Hollywood story and get it all in, it would be him,” Goode says. “It’s not like it’s just a stream of consciousness, I think it’s the amount of research that novelists undertake before they start writing. And it does take someone who can deal with the epic nature of the story, but also tie these little threads together. There’s a little bit of genius from the writers [Tolkin, Russell Rothberg, Nikki Toscano and others] and the dialogue is delicious.”\n\nFor Goode, himself, whose credits include The Good Wife, Downton Abbey (both the television series and film), The Crown and A Discovery of Witches, The Offer has left an indelible mark on the canvas.\n\n“I think when I started out, I was trying for this one way to do this, and I was quite blinkered, but the older I’ve gotten, and Dexter did ask me to do this occasionally, I like to try more things,” Goode says. “So rather than it be a line drawing, it’s now getting a bit more Jackson Pollock, so I am a little braver with my choices. In the end, though, I am just trying to please the director, that’s all I’m trying to do.”\n\nThe Offer airs on April 29 on Paramount+.\n\nA cultural guide to going out and loving your city.
