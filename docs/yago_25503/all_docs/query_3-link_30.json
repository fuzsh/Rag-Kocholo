        "text": "Like many readers, I often have issues with the thriller as a genre. By virtue of the fact that it has to be plot-driven, any detailed characterisations and psychology can get in the way of the visceral need to keep the action moving. Consequently, while we may admire the complex plotting and unlikely twists, we can often feel intellectually shortchanged by genre fiction in which so many of the characters are scarcely even one-dimensional.\n\nIt takes a considerable degree of writing skill to draw personalities that we care about, and yet keep the storyline in satisfactory transit. Liz Jensen does an excellent job here, while mapping out a generally convincing and scary environmental disaster in the not-too-distant future. I tend to be a bit cavalier on such issues, but was moved to think about them more earnestly after this book (the serious intent that underpins The Rapture is enforced by an author's note at the end).\n\nIf you're used to formidable protagonists who swagger confidently past a series of bad guys and calamities, then Gabrielle Fox, the novel's heroine, will come as a refreshing change. She is as vulnerable as it gets, having been paralysed in a car crash that left her boyfriend and their unborn child dead and Gabrielle in a wheelchair. She had a certain amount of culpability for the accident, and understandably gives herself a very hard time. Her professional background makes her even more inclined to pick at the scabs on her psychic wounds - as a psychotherapist, she is the ultimate physician who cannot heal herself.\n\nJust in case the fates hadn't handed her enough jeopardy, Gabrielle decides to make a life-changing move from London to the coastal town of Hadport. Her relocation sees her employed at a secure unit for problem teenagers, where she will look after 16-year-old devil child and modern-day Nostradamus, Bethany Krall. Bethany has been incarcerated there since stabbing her Evangelical Christian mother to death with a screwdriver. From the moment I read that revelation, I suspect I liked Bethany much more than I was supposed to, and in a strange way she emerges as the moral centre of this eco-thriller. Her predictions come into sharper focus after a healthy zap of ECT. \"Give me the volts!\" is her repeated mantra.\n\nBethany, the archetypal world-hating teenager, is dismissive of Gabrielle, referring to her as \"Wheels\" and caustically disdaining her psychobabble and all her attempts to bond. She teases Gabrielle with a cheerful malevolence, having already broken the spirit of her luckless predecessor, rather mischievously named Joy. But Bethany needs Gabrielle, as she wants the therapist to get her out of the institution, believing that it will soon be submerged under several feet of water. And when Bethany's predictions of natural disasters across the world sequentially come to pass, Gabrielle senses more than the rantings of a disturbed goth teen given to making the odd lucky punt after Googling science and meteorological websites.\n\nIn any thriller, you know right from the start that the protagonist is going to come through - it's just one of the rules of the game. The considerable achievement of The Rapture is to render its heroine so susceptible to physical or mental harm, and place her in such repeated peril, that you're never quite confident until the last page that victory will be grasped. When it happens, it's with a grim and realistic caveat which shows that the author really means business. In the meantime, battling for her own survival as she tries to unravel the enigma of Bethany, while also opening herself up again to the possibility and pain of real love, Gabrielle takes some punishing psychological (and physical) beatings.\n\nHowever, help is at hand, as she makes common cause with the breast-fixated Inverness physicist Fraser Melville, who shows her that being paralysed from the waist down does not preclude a decent sex life. If Fraser can't make Gabrielle's legs move, the next best thing is to make the Earth move under her, while taking time out from bedroom duties to assemble a team of scientists, pundits and seers to investigate Bethany's claims that the planet will soon literally be moving under us all, with a forthcoming Armageddon. This, Bethany predicts, will make the 2004 Asian tsunami seem like a ripple in the Serpentine. Meanwhile the unfortunate Joy, stricken by a terminal disease, is further demented by the notion that Bethany isn't merely predicting these events, but causing them.\n\nThe book is beautifully structured. All the elements - including the love story, Joy the stalker, the car trip in which Gabrielle, Fraser and Bethany morph into an apocalyptic nuclear family, and the crazy denouement, which culminates in a nail-biting escape from the Olympic Stadium filled with Evangelical Christians (where are those lions when you need them most?) - are introduced at exactly the right time.\n\nWould-be thriller writers should certainly pick up The Rapture; it's a masterclass on how to write an engaging thriller about a relevant contemporary issue while still respecting the reader's brain cells. If you enjoy the genre, you'll be gripped - and even if it's not to your taste, the chances are you'll still find this book offers some fine rewards."
