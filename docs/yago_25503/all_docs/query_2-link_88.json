        "text": "The Godfather producer Al Ruddy is the focus of this story, and series creator Michael Tolkin spent time interviewing Ruddy before starting work on The Offer. In fact, 92-year-old Ruddy serves as an executive producer on the show.\n\n“What sealed it for me was when Al said, ‘Every day of making The Godfather was the worst day in my life,’ and that told me we had a show,” Tolkin said. “For every character in the film, getting it made or stopping it from being made was at the core of their actions, and it was a matter of life and death to them. So that’s not a gangster story, that’s a human story. That’s what gave the book and the movie so much power. Everyone is fighting for their existence.”\n\nGulf+Western executive Charles Bluhdorn was called \"The Mad Austrian of Wall Street.\" Born in Vienna, Austria, he immigrated to New York at age 16, and climbed his way up the corporate ladder. He was chairman of Gulf and Western, Paramount's parent company, as they made The Godfather, and decisions ultimately laid with him. He died of a heart attack at age 56 in 1983. The Godfather Part III is dedicated to him.\n\nJoseph Colombo Sr. was the boss (er, the Godfather?) of the Colombo Crime Family—one of the infamous Five Families of the Italian American mafia in New York. He created the Italian-American Civil Rights League in 1970, and was the representative of the Five Families who met with Ruddy around the production of the Godfather.\n\nWhen Ruddy agreed to remove any mentions of \"mafia\" from the script, Colombo offered his full support. During the filming of The Godfather, he was shot at a rally and paralyzed. He died seven years later at age 54."
