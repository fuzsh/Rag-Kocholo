        "text": "Jonathan Barlow Lee, son of playwright Robert E. Lee, and production manager for the Mark Taper Forum for the past 28 years, will share personal anecdotes about growing up while the plays of Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee were being created, and will discuss and share designs, plans and renderings of the premiere productions of Auntie Mame and several other Lawrence and Lee plays.\n\nJonathan Barlow Lee has been the production manager for more than 150 plays at Center Theatre Group’s Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, including the first full production of both Parts 1 and 2 of Angels in America, Deaf West’s Big River (performed in American Sign Language), and the world premiere productions of many plays from August Wilson’s “Century Cycle.” Previously, his work as a stage manager included the original productions of Zoot Suit as well as Children of a Lesser God – at the Taper and on Broadway, and the interactive audience experience, Tamara. He directed an international touring company of “Children,” and staged a 30th anniversary revival of that play for Deaf West Theatre in Los Angeles. He has taught stage management at the University of Southern California, and on behalf of Center Theatre Group he oversaw the 2008 renovation of the Taper."
