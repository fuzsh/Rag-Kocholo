        "text": "''I AM bloodied but unbowed, and all I can tell you is I'm coming home,'' Angela Lansbury said over the phone from Philadelphia, where ''Mame'' has cut short its pre-Broadway run. The revival of the musical, which Miss Lansbury originated with memorable success in 1966, will begin previews at the Gershwin Theater next Wednesday and open July 24.\n\n''Mame'' was to arrive in New York in November, after five weeks in Philadelphia and a month in Boston. But business was so disappointing when the musical opened last week that Mitch Leigh, the producer, made a quick decision to change course.\n\n''I just can't believe it,'' said Miss Lansbury, who won a Tony Award for her portrayal of the flamboyant, eccentric Mame. ''It's an anathema to find ourselves in this predicament. All I can tell you is, 'Mame' is a show stopper. It always was. Believe me, darling, it still is.''\n\nMiss Lansbury, who played Mame on Broadway for two years and later starred in two touring productions of the musical, described this revival as a loving re-creation of the original, which was based on the novel ''Auntie Mame'' by Patrick Dennis and the play of the same title by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. The book is by Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Lee, and the music and lyrics are by Jerry Herman.\n\n''We are coming in with no advance sales,'' Miss Lansbury said. ''We have to pray a lot.'' ''Damn it all,'' she added, ''it's a great, great vehicle for me. I can wear it as easily today as I did 17 years ago.'' Miss Lansbury was 41 years old the first time she played Mame. ''We haven't changed one tune or one dance step. This is something a woman of my age needs to do - to prove that I can still do it. I don't think it is necessary to pack it up and do character roles. Theater is magic. I believe I can spin a web of magic and make people believe I have turned the clock back.''\n\nThe news that Peter Brook's innovative version of ''Carmen'' will open Oct. 24 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater is cause for celebration, for the theater will be lighted for the first time in two years. But the Beaumont's problems are far from solved. Fundamental questions remain: When will the theater begin producing its own shows again? And what will be its artistic policy?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
