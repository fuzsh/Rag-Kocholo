        "text": "So who do you know who could “coax the blues right out of the horn?” or “charm the husk right off of the corn?” And do so con brio, even after losing her wealth in a stock market crash?\n\nAnd who, after living a single, devil-may-care life of self-indulgence, would appreciate having an orphaned young relative take up residence?\n\nProbably no one other than Mame Dennis, that indomitable and ebullient eccentric who is the title character of the classic Broadway hit musical “Mame,” which opens March 7 and performs through March 26 at Riverside Theatre’s Stark Stage.\n\n“Mame” opened on Broadway in 1966 with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. Angela Lansbury played the starring role, after Mary Martin turned it down. The musical, based on the book and play “Auntie Mame,” had more than 1,500 Broadway performances and is considered one of the most successful musicals of all time.\n\nAn updated 1974 movie version starred Lucille Ball as Mame with Bea Arthur and Robert Preston.\n\nRiverside Theatre’s production of “Mame” is directed and choreographed by James Brennan, who just completed the same duties for the Noel Coward play “Private Lives.” His frequent — and heralded — work at Riverside Theatre probably qualifies him for part-time Vero Beach residency.\n\nUnflappable\n\nPatterned after a real-life auntie, originally written about by Patrick Dennis, the musical’s Mame is a carefree and wealthy New Yorker who suddenly finds herself caring for her orphaned 10-year-old nephew Patrick.\n\nShe imparts her motto to her young charge: “Life is a banquet and most are starving to death.” She and her entourage partake in an almost gluttonous zeal for fun, and the here and now.\n\nMame might be fiddling while Rome burns but who can fault her unflagging optimism, which eventually rubs off on less positive individuals?\n\nHer attempts to find work after the stock market crash are comedic failures but she remains undaunted and unflappable. Perhaps the gods of fate do smile more favorably on those who try and try again.\n\nStar power\n\nThe show’s stars Michele Ragusa (Mame Dennis) and George Dvorksy (Beauregard Jackson), took a morning hiatus from rehearsals to talk a bit about the show. The talented pair — with impressive Broadway, television and recording credits — have previously worked together and with Brennan.\n\nDvorsky is making his Riverside Theatre debut and Ragusa starred last year as Dolly Levi in the Riverside Theatre production of “Hello Dolly.”\n\nWhen asked what it’s like to play parts made nearly iconic by the stars of yesteryear, Ragusa and Dvorsky had slightly different thoughts.\n\n“Like with ‘Hello Dolly,’ I never watched the musical. I also never saw ‘Auntie Mame.’ I didn’t feel I had to be someone else,” Ragusa said.\n\nDvorsky said that, with the input of a director, he brings his own interpretation to a role but “Some things you must pay homage to. Let the audience ‘see’ what the Robert Preston role was but also let them see new things.”\n\nOptimism\n\nRagusa and Dvorsky agreed that Brennan — a former Broadway star in his own right — is a dream to work with.\n\n“Jimmy Brennan never loses his cool or gets his feathers ruffled. And he has the best laugh in the world,” Ragusa said.\n\nDvorsky recalls, “On the first day of rehearsals, Jim said, ‘I’m the director and boy, can I cast well!’”\n\nBoth actors love the show’s themes of humor and optimism.\n\n“(Mame’s) zest for life embraces everything. I love that about her. She leaps on the raft and goes for the ride,” Ragusa said.\n\n“In the song ‘We Need a Little Christmas,’ it shows: if it moves you, do it. Make lemons into lemonade,” Dvorsky said. “The glass is always half full and you need a sense of humor about life — especially in the theater.”\n\nRagusa gave a little “spoiler alert” regarding what she and Dvorsky said are amazing sets (thanks to Riverside Theatre frequent set designer Cliff Simon) and the costuming.\n\n“Wait until you see the show. There are 18 costume changes for Mame. And I am privileged and honored to have among them a hat and coat that were Ms. Lansbury’s. I’m so excited,” Ragusa said."
