        "text": "Welcome back to my 'And the Tony Almost Went to...' series, where I take a deep dive into a show that was the (likely) runner-up in the Best Musical race of any previous Tony Awards year. 55 years ago tonight marked the opening of a new Broadway musical by Jerome Lawrence, Robert E. Lee, and Jerry Herman. Today, we'll be looking back at this very show as well as its success at the Tonys.\n\nBased on Jerome Lawrence & Robert E. Lee's 1956 stage play, Auntie Mame, as well as Edward Everett Tanner III (under the pseudonym of Patrick Dennis)'s 1955 novel of that same title, Mame is set in New York City over the course of many years from the Great Depression to World War II. The story begins when wealthy, eccentric socialite Mame Dennis suddenly becomes the legal guardian of her nephew, Patrick Dennis, following the death of her brother. Mame ends up embracing the challenge as she introduces Patrick to all of life's wonders through a series of adventures.\n\nThe stage adaptation of Auntie Mame originally opened on October 31st, 1956 at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway with Rosalind Russell starring as the title character. A little over two years later, a feature film adaptation with Russell reprising her role was released in movie theaters nationwide, which ended up getting nominated for 6 Academy Awards (including Best Picture). The overall success of the play made everyone involved with it immediately think of the idea of doing a musical adaptation. Unlike the nonmusical film which had a screenplay penned by Betty Comden & Adolph Green, Jerome Lawrence & Robert E. Lee wrote the book for the musical themselves, adapting it from their play, with Jerry Herman writing the score.\n\nMame opened on May 24th, 1966 at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. The original cast included Angela Lansbury as Mame Dennis, Bea Arthur as Vera Charles, Jane Connell as Agnes Gooch, William Waterman as Dwight Babcock, Frankie Michaels as Young Patrick Dennis, Charles Baswell as Beauregard Burnside, Jerry Lanning as Patrick Dennis, Margaret Hall as Sally Cato, George Coe as M. Lindsay Woolsey, Sab Shimono as Ito, Randy Kirby as Junior Babcock, and Diane Coupé as Pegeen Ryan.\n\nThe production received 8 Tony Award nominations for Best Musical, Best Lead Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury)*, Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Frankie Michaels)*, Best Featured Actress in a Musical (Bea Arthur)*, Best Direction of a Musical (Gene Saks), Best Original Score (Jerry Herman), Best Choreography (Onna White), and Best Scenic Design (William & Jean Eckart).\n\n*denotes an award it won.\n\nYet, despite becoming a hit, it wasn't the only one of those in town to have debuted during the 1965-66 Broadway season."
