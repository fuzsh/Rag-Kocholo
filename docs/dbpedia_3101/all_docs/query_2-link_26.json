        "text": "Marion Tanner, self-described as ''the ultimate Greenwich Village eccentric'' and the apparent model for the madcap fictional character Auntie Mame, died here yesterday. She was 94 years old and had suffered a stroke two months ago.\n\nShe died in the Village Nursing Home at 607 Hudson Street where she had lived in recent years.\n\nKnown as one of Greenwich Village's most colorful inhabitants, Miss Tanner, in 1927, bought a red brick house at 72 Bank Street, and for many years it was a haven and salon for struggling artists, writers, freethinkers, radicals and a wide spectrum of what Miss Tanner sometimes called ''Bohemian types.''\n\nBut by the early 1960's, after she had been immortalized in ''Auntie Mame'' - the novel written by her nephew, Edward Everett Tanner 3d, using the pen name Patrick Dennis - Miss Tanner had turned her home into a boarding house and sanctuary for often nonpaying ''visitors.'' These included drunken derelicts, shopping-bag ladies and others she considered less fortunate than herself.\n\nAlthough Miss Tanner was regarded as a Lady Bountiful by those who sought and were given the warmth of her hearth and her heart, in the view of some of her neighbors she and her house were nuisances.\n\nUnable to Make Payments\n\nIn 1964 she could no longer make her mortgage payments, and the house was sold. As a young deputy sheriff was evicting her he remarked to a reporter: ''She's an amazing woman. There's no place left in our society for a person like her. It's too bad. In an earlier time she might have been a saint.''\n\nAt that point Mr. Tanner was no longer telling interviewers that his Aunt Marion was the model for Auntie Mame, whose wacky adventures were chroncicled in the book that was on best-seller lists for more than two years in the mid-50's and formed the basis for a Broadway comedy, a movie and then a Broadway musical which itself became a movie.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
