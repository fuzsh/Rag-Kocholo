        "text": "‘Mame’\n\nBased on “Auntie Mame,” a 1955 novel by Patrick Dennis, “Mame” can be compared to another Depression-era comedy, “Annie,” although the genders of its key characters are reversed. In “Annie,” Daddy Warbucks, a powerful and wealthy businessman, has his hobnobbing lifestyle upended by an 11-year-old orphan girl, while in “Mame,” Mame Dennis has her nightly ritzy parties waylaid by her young nephew.\n\nSanta Susana High School’s production of the show could not have been done without the collaborative efforts of drama teacher Melissa Albertson and senior Hannah Nawroth, who took the reins after both of Albertson’s parents passed away during the show’s production. Nawroth, who wants to be a theater major in college next year, saved the show by also handling blocking and costuming and serving as prop master.\n\nIn “ Mame,” free- spirited bohemian Mame Dennis tries to climb out of the Depression and at the same time shepherd her 10-year-old nephew, Patrick, through life’s travails. This is the basic plot of the hit 1966 Broadway musical that acted as a vehicle for its bigger-than-life star, Angela Lansbury. Originally written with Judy Garland in mind, the show demands a star who can dominate the stage with power and panache.\n\nIt’s a tall order for any high school theater group, but Santa Susana passed that test with flying colors, thanks chiefly to its ultra talented star, Nia Colemon.\n\nAs “Mame,” Colemon is amazingly poised and sure of herself, quite rare in someone so young. She has taken on other roles for big-voiced divas, such as Mother Abbess (“The Sound of Music”) and the title character in “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nBut Colemon fits Mame to a “T,” splendidly gowned, with a commanding presence and a strong, dramatic and shimmering voice not unlike that of Edith Piaf. It’s almost as if she’s been acting for 20 years—that’s how well-suited for the stage this young spitfi re is.\n\nMatching Mame with an impressive stage presence is senior Natasha Sill, who plays dorky nanny- in- law Agnes Gooch. Sill proves to be a marvelous comedian and almost steals the show from Colemon.\n\nA funny subplot involves Mame and her partner-in-crime, fellow socialite Vera Charles (Natalia Vivino), who try to convert Gooch, like Eliza Doolittle, from a mouse into a lady. (The roles of Gooch and Vera are double-cast, with Rachel Goldman and Grace Lewis rotating with Sill and Vivino.)\n\nAlthough Vera Charles is usually played by actresses with a lower vocal range (Bea Arthur played the role on Broadway), Vivino displays a gorgeous soprano voice in songs such as “It’s Today” and “Bosom Buddies.”\n\nMichael C. Kennedy, al- ready a familiar young face around town, does a solid job as Mame’s nephew Patrick. He was previously seen in two productions of “The Sound of Music” as well as “The King and I” and others. Shoshana Micon is very funny as Mame’s servant, Ito, and gets many laughs with her stereotyped mangled Japanese accent.\n\nHolden Streetly plays Dwight Babcock, a walking aneurysmwaiting to- happen. When he tangles with Mame, fireworks explode. Forrest Holt plays Mame’s aristocratic husband, Beauregard Pickett Burnside, whose Georgia plantation is actually named Peckerwood. In a smaller role, Shannon Smith impresses as Beauregard Burnside’s bullfrog-like mother.\n\nOther key roles are played by Alexis Salazar (M. Lindsay Woolsey), Trevor Newton (the older Patrick), and Isabella Moore (Gloria Upson). Kathryn Kuby led the all- student orchestra, while the excellent choreography was designed by Karen Giles-Buell and Rachel Goldman.\n\nBut Colemon fits\n\nMame to a “T,” splendidly gowned, with a commanding presence and a strong, dramatic and shimmering voice not unlike that of\n\nEdith Piaf"
