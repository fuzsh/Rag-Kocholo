        "text": "A showcase for the spectacular talents of Russell, who made the play a Broadway hit. Eccentric, colorful Mame Dennis adopts an orphan boy, exposing him to all manner of extravagant and bizarre characters in the 1920s and 1930s. The film is a trifle overlong and episodic, but Russell is supported in high style by a talented cast. Look for many amusing 1950s art direction and costume touches that are unusual. For once Hollywood agreed that Broadway's casting couldn't be improved; Russell's way with words, her rhythms, speed, and timing are irreplacably, impeccably right."
