        "text": "I discovered Auntie Mame: An Irreverent Escapade (reissued 2001) some years ago. I know it was when I worked for an independent bookstore, so it was between the years 2003-06. I am pretty sure I’d seen the movie before then, perhaps on TCM or something, but I had never thought to look for a Mame book until it appeared in my bookstore, and I snapped it right up. I was raised on a literary diet of children’s books from the 1940s and ’50s so the tone appealed immediately. I recently discovered the sequel to Auntie Mame, Around the World with Auntie Mame (reissued 2003), which again I had never thought to look for until I saw it used, so I snapped that right up too, which has inspired my current interest in all things Mame.\n\n“But who is Mame?” I hear you ask. Edward Everett Tanner III (his fascinating bio is here) wrote the book as one of his pseudonyms, Patrick Dennis, who was orphaned at 10 in 1928 and adopted by his wealthy, eccentric aunt Mame. Mame, who lives life to the fullest and rejects conformity, etc., adopts Patrick in 1928, and shows him the exciting city life, countered by boring Mr. Babcock, who was named guardian of Patrick’s finances. Not long into their time together, the stock market falls and all of her money is gone. She tries a series of unsuccessful jobs to make money until, while working as an inefficient Macy’s clerk during the holiday rush, she meets and falls in love with a rich oil man from the South, Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside, and becomes Mrs. Burnside. While on a world tour, he falls to his death, and she is widowed. Patrick, meanwhile, has been spending his teen years at a boarding school before going off to college, and they are reunited when he is 19. He has fallen in with the boring Babcocks, and become engaged to a thoroughly boring snob from CT, Gloria Upson (whose family house in CT is called “Upson Downs”! Get it? Ups and Downs! Isn’t that just TOP DRAWER?). Mame does her best to expose the fiance and her family’s snottiness as only she can, and Patrick realizes the error of his ways. Mame may be crazy, but she’s family! This basic summary leaves out all the funny parts, but there are many, trust me. (See below for Mame’s takedown of ditzy Gloria.)\n\nOriginally published in 1955, the book became an oddball bestseller (on the list for 100+ weeks), inspiring multiple adaptations to stage, screen, and TV. The best, full-stop, was the stage and later movie version, “Auntie Mame,” (play, 1957; movie, 1958) starring Rosalind Russell (reviving her faltering career) and written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. The book’s sequel was published in 1957 and dedicated to Russell, as she really did embody Mame absolutely. However, Mame continued to hold an allure for actresses of a certain age, or beyond it, and the musical “Mame,” written by Lawrence and Lee with songs by Jerry Herman, starred Angela Lansbury in 1966, reviving her career as well (with Bea Arthur as Mame’s theater star friend and drinking buddy Vera Charles- both Lansbury and Arthur won Tonies for their roles). Lucille Ball appeared in the movie version of the musical in 1974 (the studio decided against Lansbury, for which she never forgave them), in which Bea Arthur reprised her version of Vera. The stage versions of “Auntie Mame” and “Mame” have attracted scads of actresses over the years, including Greer Garson, Elaine Stritch (who I bet was amazing), Celeste Holm, Gypsy Rose Lee (why not?), Susan Hayward, and Carol Lawrence, among many (MANY) others.\n\nI have now seen both the movie “Auntie Mame” and the 1974 “Mame” musical. Russell = Mame. The movie itself is a bit silly, but then so is the book, so it fits. It also adheres closer to the book than the musical, which makes some odd adjustments that prove more annoying than useful. It must be said that both movies make polite use of Vaseline on the lens in closeups of their stars, but Lucille Ball is practically cloudy for all the softening that must go on to make her look a Mameish mid-40s when she was at the time in her 60s. The musical was not a success, either as it was being made or in terms of the box office, and it shows. It’s an awkward movie. Lucille Ball is Lucille Ball, and Mame is not Lucille Ball. She apparently felt that Russell had based her Mame on Lucy Ricardo, and so put up some of her own money to get the movie made with her in the lead (hence Lansbury’s removal). Bea Arthur remained as Vera because her husband, who’d directed the Broadway version, was also directing the movie.\n\nBy this point in musical history, at least as far as my own experience has showed me, musicals in the Rodgers-and-Hammerstein style were old-fashioned and were being replaced by either Webber bombastickery or Sondheim wordiness. “Mame” tried to inspire a return to the R&H mode, and it failed. I don’t know how it did on the stage, perhaps the live aspect makes it better (I would’ve loved to see Bea Arthur live), but the songs are silly and boring, and though I am perfectly ok with people randomly bursting into song and choreographed dance, even I can tell when a number falls flat. Most, if not all, of “Mame’s” numbers fizzle. The one song of lasting influence is “We Need a Little Christmas,” which had the luck of being a song about a perennial holiday, but there’s nothing of “Almost Like Being in Love” or “The Street Where You Live” or “Oklahoma” in it or any of the other songs. Plus, it is worth mentioning that the lovely but unsuitable Robert Preston is Beauregard Burnside, and when he meets Mame in Macy’s for the first time, he says he has a trouble and needs her help. I don’t think I’m the only one who wondered if the trouble began with a capital T and rhymed with P, which as we all know stands for pool. This film is entirely miscast, except for Bea Arthur, who is always awesome.\n\nAh, but “Auntie Mame”… much, much better. Written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, part of MGM’s Freed Unit responsible for classics like “Singin’ in the Rain,” “On the Town,” and “The Band Wagon.” They were librettists as well as screenwriters, so it is interesting that when “Auntie Mame” was made into a musical, they weren’t the ones to think of it. Imagine how much better written it would have been. “Auntie Mame” is just a much more enjoyable movie. It’s true that the direction is a bit doofy (the fadeouts to focus on Russell at the end of every “scene” are unnecessary), but more of the book makes it into the film, especially some supporting characters who get unsatisfactorily combined in “Mame.” God bless Lucy for wanting to put her stamp on the character, but come on. No. Rosalind Russell FTW.\n\nDennis insisted Mame was not based on anyone real, just a “distillation and a moonbeam and nothing more!” (Jordan 172) His aunt, however, claimed she was the true Mame. Despite what sounds like a number of Mameish qualities (opening her doors to artists and “transients,” acting off-Broadway, getting a degree at Smith), Dennis’s aunt was more of a pain than a support, as Mame is repeatedly proven to be in her own madcap way. Dennis’s aunt instead became “publicity-mad” in wanting to be known as the “real Mame.” Nor, apparently, did she have Mame’s fabulous sense of fashion- and without that, you really don’t have Mame. Dennis was an interesting character himself, whose success and family life masked his unhappy second life as a gay man. He eventually had a breakdown before leaving his family for a man, and he died as a butler in Florida in the 1970s.\n\nThis must go in the category of “who knew?”: An Italian reissue of Auntie Mame in 2009 became an enormous hit, and no one knows why! A literary critic, Goffredo Fofi asks,\n\n“Is it because we all sense this great need for likeable and non-conformist aunts and uncles in the face of the current conformism of vulgarity?” Or is the opposite true, “that the success of Auntie Mame is part of the great collective lie of national likeableness that Italians recite every day?”\n\nI don’t know, but both are depressing. ‘Auntie Mame’ Prevails as Improbably Best Seller in Italian Market, NY Times, January 28, 2010. I missed that the first time around. Apparently the Italians are looking to make it a movie to capitalize on the Mameamania, starring Tilda Swinton! Huh. Says the Italian editor for Adelphi Press, which published the reissue:\n\n“People read the book and say ‘Auntie Mame’ is me,” said Mr. Codignola. “You’d be surprised how often I hear this from women who are not particularly sparkling or elegant. They say: I can’t understand how this man who lived 50 years ago was able to write about me.”\n\nHA! Yes yes yes, I love this.\n\nIn sum: I thoroughly suggest you read the books, watch the Russell movie, and appreciate Patrick Dennis’s awesome wit. Mame is great.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\n“But Darling, I’m Your Auntie Mame!”: The Amazing History of the World’s Favorite Madcap Aunt, by R.T. Jordan.
