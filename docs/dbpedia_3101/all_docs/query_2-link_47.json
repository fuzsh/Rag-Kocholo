        "text": "“Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death!” That’s the motto of Mame Dennis, one of musical theatre’s all-time greatest heroines, in this brassy, tuneful, hilarious and touching adaptation of Patrick Dennis’s bestseller, Auntie Mame. Jerry Herman’s celebrated score includes the rousing title number, plus “Open a New Window,” “If He Walked into My Life,” “We Need a Little Christmas,” and “That’s How Young I Feel.”\n\nMame is a happy happening. She is well-to-do, lives in New York at the peak of the 1920’s, and is surprised by a “wonderful present”: an orphan 10 year old nephew named Patrick. Who needs his aunt, and this is something new for Mame – to be needed. It changes her life. It brings her into sharp conflict with her best friend, Vera Charles, a multi-martini grande dame of the legitimate theatre… for Vera can’t stand children. Mame, who was about to marry, doesn’t think she’ll have time for marriage – “I’ll be too busy being a mother!” The boy’s nanny, Agnes Gooch, doesn’t approve of those irrepressible things, which go on in Mame’s apartment, and yet she inevitably falls under her spell. With the balloon burst of the Depression, Mame loses all her money, and she loses jobs as quickly as she finds them. In a brief adventure as a manicurist, she meets Beau – a wealthy scion of the South. He takes Mame to his plantation for the begrudging approval of his family. Of course, Beau proposes – in the bouncing title song, which sings the praises of “Mame!” There’s only one problem as the curtain falls on the first act: young Patrick, is afraid he has lost his “Best Girl.”"
