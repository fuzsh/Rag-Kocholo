        "text": "Over the years, Barbra Streisand's name has been attached to many film projects. This page at Barbra Archives attempts to round up all the rumors and timelines surrounding some of the significant projects Streisand is (or was—or rumored to be) involved with. The movies are discussed from 1968 to current.\n\nAs soon as Barbra was in Hollywood filming Funny Girl (part of a three-picture deal with producer Ray Stark) the columns printed that she would star in Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie — a drama-with-music film from Gavin Lambert's script. This film was never made.\n\n“I was offered They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?,” Streisand told Elle magazine in 2011, “but you had to dance through the whole movie—I got tired just reading the script. I was offered Klute, but I was seeing someone at the time and didn’t want to work. I was offered Julia, but I was editing A Star Is Born. As I say to Jane Fonda, ‘I’m responsible for your career.’ Because I turned down those movies and she got them and she was wonderful in them.”\n\nAs early as 1969, Streisand wanted to play the famous French actress Sarah Bernhardt. She told Look magazine that, “Yeah, I think it's inevitable that I'll play Sarah, but there's nothing in the works yet. I can wear my hair in the frizziest look, and you know Bernhardt acted Hamlet, not Ophelia, and so will I. It's little things like these that influence me to do a part.”\n\nWhile filming On A Clear Day, Streisand reportedly received an offer to play Bernhardt from the Rank Organization for a payday of $1.5 million against 5% of the world gross.\n\nAround 1971, director Ken Russell discussed making a bio film with Barbra Streisand called The Legend of Sarah. Russell worked on a screenplay and corresponded with Streisand about the project, who would co-produce the film through her First Artists company. Barbra told columnist Joyce Haber, “I think that Russell handles biography very well. Women In Love was nearly biographical ... So I called Ken in England about this project. He liked the idea and we've concluded the arrangement.” The film never came together, although the prospect of melding Ken Russell's outrageous style with Streisand's was compelling.\n\nIn December 1972, Swedish director Ingmar Bergman (The Seventh Seal, Fanny and Alexander) told the press he was in discussions with Barbra Streisand to appear as Hanna Glavari in a film adaptation of Lehar’s operetta The Merry Widow. This isn't as far-fetched as it sounds — Bergman and Streisand met in 1971 when her husband, Elliott Gould, was in Sweden filming Bergman's The Touch.\n\nSvensk Filmindustri and Dino De Laurentiis announced they would produce the movie. Bergman apparently approached Stephen Sondheim to rewrite the book and lyrics of the operetta. The film was budgeted at $6.5 million, but Sweden at the time had very high inflation and De Laurentiis had financing problems.\n\nStreisand told Cosmopolitan magazine, “I was supposed to do The Merry Widow with Ingmar Bergman. He wrote the script. I read it and liked the first half. I asked him to rewrite. He refused, so I refused to do the film.” The project fell apart due to lack of funding and was never filmed. However, in 1987, The Merry Widow rumors resurfaced, with Placido Domingo named as Streisand's leading man by the press.\n\nAfter Merry Widow, Streisand was involved in a film called Love Sounds with director Jack Clayton. It was written by Joanna Crawford who told Barbara Blaine it was about “a woman who gets divorced and doesn't know how to handle her life. She’s a window dresser and although it's about a woman deserted, it was supposed to be a light satiric film, the kind that Streisand does so well,” she said. Crawford explained that Jon Peters got involved — “They wanted [the character] to be a professor or a newspaper reporter. So they abandoned the project ...”\n\nAnd sometime between 1973 and 1974, Streisand hired Funny Girl lyricist Bob Merrill to adapt Mary Rodgers’ book, Freaky Friday into a movie. Rodgers is the daughter of Richard, and Streisand never made that film. But Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster did in 1976 — it was a comedy about a mother and daughter who switch bodies for a day.\n\nIn 1977, Streisand and John Travolta were attached to a film called Fancy Hardware. Written by A.J. Carothers, it was put together in 1972 as a project for Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw, but that version fell apart. Travolta would have played a womanizing salesman in the 1930s and Streisand would be an ahead-of-her-time feminist.\n\nStreisand circled the film version of Stanley Mann’s novel Third Time Lucky for years after it was published in 1978. Streisand would portray the novel’s former actress and mother who suffers from psychological problems. When an ardent fan calls on her, the woman begins a unique love affair. “When my son Jason was four,” Streisand recalled, “I remember talking to him about a movie I’d like to [make] called Third Time Lucky. In the film, there was this relationship between a mom and her son. The son is trying to be stoic and help his mom. He burns himself cooking something for her and doesn’t cry. I wanted her to say to him, ‘Why aren’t you crying? You should cry! This hurts, doesn’t it? You can cry.’”\n\nStreisand tried to make Third Time Lucky into the 1990s.\n\nAnother film that Streisand circled for a while in 1979 was a love story set in Washington, D.C. and based on her big hit with Neil Diamond, “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers.” According to reports at the time, Streisand had hired Gerald Ayres to write the script about a woman lawyer. “Washington is a beautiful place to se a love story, and it's gone virtually unnoticed,” Ayres said.\n\nBarbra was involved for a brief time in 1981 with The White Hotel, based on the novel by D.M. Thomas (about an opera singer who turns to Sigmund Freud for treatment of psychosomatic pain and visions that she would die during the Holocaust). According to Thomas (who wrote a book about Hollywood's stymied attempts to bring his novel to the screen called Bleak Hotel: The Hollywood Saga of The White Hotel):\n\nBernardo Bertolucci told me, years later, that Streisand had invited him to her Hollywood mansion to discuss the film over dinner. Gold dinner service, butler, the works. She said: “Bernardo, there’s just one thing bothering me: how are we going to deal with all the sex?” “Well, Barbra, I have this idea for glass fibre optics to enter the woman’s vagina.” A moment’s silence, then: “Let me show you the house.” And she never spoke of The White Hotel to him again.\n\nThen in 1984, Streisand looked at a film called Triangle, an adaptation of Leon Stein's novel about Triangle Shirtwaist Company. “It was a helluva story,” said its screenwriter, Herb Gardner. “150 young seamstresses trapped on the tenth floor of a factory building in SoHo — their bosses had locked the door to keep the union organizers out ... they left those poor girls to die.”\n\nStreisand would have starred as the leader of the workers; Fonda would have portrayed the labor organizer.\n\n“Barbra and Jane and I would meet and talk for hours ... the combined energy of those two superstars gave me shortness of breath!” Gardner said. “I worked on a script for over two years and in the end the girls passed. Barbra was all caught up with Yentl,” he offered. Fonda went on to develop a fictionalized movie of the Karen Silkwood story.\n\nStreisand's interest in a biopic about Life magazine photographer Margaret Bourke-White project goes back to 1986, when she developed the property with producer Linda Yellen as a starring vehicle for Streisand, which she would direct as well. Linda was the co-writer of Skinny and Cat based on the lives of Margaret Bourke-White and author Erskine Caldwell, who wrote Tobacco Road.\n\nIn 1988 Barbra told the St. Petersburg Times that “I don't know at this stage,” whether she would commit to the movie.\n\nHowever, Yellen and Streisand worked on the property even after a TV movie with Farrah Faucet as Bourke-White aired in 1989 — “It wasn't well-reviewed and it wasn't the same story we will tell,” Yellen said. “Margaret will be better served in our story, which will show the broad dimensions of her life and illustrate the big leaps she took personally and professionally.” (Streisand mentioned directing the Bourke-White story in June 2012, but said she still needed to acquire financing for the film.)\n\nIn 2013, Deadline reported that Barbra Streisand will direct her version of the Margaret Bourke-White/Erskine Caldwell love story. Deadline stated that “casting is underway with an eye to shoot before the end of the year. Streisand is currently overseeing the screenplay for the project. She had previously sought to film the story, but that production did not come to fruition. This is a new take.”\n\nBehind the scenes, Deadline said “Mark Manuel’s Kilburn Media will finance the film and Aldamisa will handle worldwide sales. Aldamisa’s president of international sales & acquisitions, Nadine de Barros, will serve as a producer.”\n\nA few days later, Roger Friedman gives more details: Colin Firth and Cate Blanchett were cast in “Skinny and Cat.” But then producer Linda Yellen took the project (and the rights to her screenplay) to Lagniappe Films, without Streisand.\n\nAccording to Friedman, the announcement Deadline made was for Streisand to direct a new script (not “Skinny and Cat”) based on Bourke-White and Erskine, which she began developing. Unfortunately, her new script would not legally be able to use any source material from that original Linda Yellen screenplay.\n\nStreisand, however, was having trouble financing the picture. \"This is hard to raise money for?\" Streisand said. \"I'm just in shock. Hollywood has changed so much. It's about a woman ahead of her time. It's just a fascinating story that is very relevant to today. I may have to pick up the phone again.\"\n\nIn Spring 2013 behind-the-scenes details seemed to shift on this project. Deadline reported “casting is underway with an eye to shoot before the end of the year. Streisand is currently overseeing the screenplay for the project. She had previously sought to film the story, but that production did not come to fruition. This is a new take.”\n\nMarcus Pelegrin and Edward Evans have written an entirely new script on the Bourke-White subject, with Streisand's Yentl producer Rusty Lemorande on board in a production role, too.\n\nThe biggest rumor (and one that never seemed to go away for years) was that Streisand would/should/could play Norma Desmond in the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical of Sunset Boulevard. Streisand fans seem to split down the middle about whether Streisand should play Norma. Of course, there's a whole contingency who believe Lloyd Webber's musical only has two or three good songs, and that it never transcended the exceptional, original film with Gloria Swanson.\n\nVariety's review of the 1993 show said: “...as re-conceived by Lloyd Webber with book and lyrics by the first-time creative team of Don Black and Christopher Hampton, this Sunset works overtime to pay homage to the film — the story is virtually identical, as is much of the dialogue — without finding its own voice.”\n\nReportedly, at the opening night party in London, Billy Wilder (the original movie's director) confessed his true opinion of the show: “It's my movie in a permanent long shot.”\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber spoke about the status of Sunset in 2008: “The film has been delayed entirely because Paramount, which owns the original film, is not keen on it being made,” he said. “Many people have wanted to play the role [of Norma] — the latest is Barbra Streisand.” Glenn Close? “Glenn has absolutely wanted to play it, Meryl [Streep] has wanted to play it and none of us can get past this wall. I don't think they get the idea of a musical at all.”\n\nStreisand herself talked about Sunset Boulevard in 2009 while promoting her album, Love is the Answer. “Well it [the Sunset movie] actually was happening for a while, and I turned it down twice. And it's a hard one, because it was a great movie. I thought she was a little over-the-top, Gloria Swanson. He was very good, William Holden. It would need work for the film, a lot of work, I think, ya know...”\n\nAnd, again, in 2016 when Glenn Close was about to open in London in a revival of Sunset, its writer Christopher Hampton brought up the movie version again — with Close starring. “We’ve just had a series of talks with Paramount,” he told the Evening Standard, “so everything is in place and hopefully we can get it done while Glenn is in London.”\n\nTo date .... there has been no film of Sunset Boulevard.\n\nMame was a 1966 Broadway musical starring Angela Lansbury with music by Jerry Herman (Hello, Dolly!). The musical was based on the 1956 Broadway hit and 1958 movie Auntie Mame, which starred Rosalind Russell. All versions were adapted from Patrick Dennis’ original 1955 novel, Auntie Mame. In 1974 Lucille Ball appeared in a movie version of the musical, which was mostly disliked. About the 1974 musical, composer Jerry Herman said, “The movie was totally unsatisfying. Lucille Ball turned in a hard-working performance, but she couldn't sing, she couldn't dance. She was a clown. And Mame is an elegant sophisticate.”\n\nProducing team Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, working for Disney, had a couple of network television ratings successes with their productions of the musicals Cinderella (1997) and Annie (1999). At the time, producer Craig Zadan told the New York Times, “What's happened is that Disney and ABC have said to us: ‘You have the first Sunday in November every year,’” Mr. Zadan said. “That's our slot. It's our goal to get a new musical ready every summer.”\n\nMeron and Zadan contemplated The Music Man, The Wiz or Mame as their next project. By November 1999, Disney, Storyline Entertainment (Meron & Zadan) and Barwood Films (Barbra Streisand’s production company) had partnered to develop Mame. “Barbra [Streisand] is a producer at this point,” Neil Meron said. “We haven't done casting yet. That will depend on the script.”\n\nLowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (Parenthood and City Slickers) were hired to write the Mame teleplay and delivered their draft on August 31, 1999. Streisand reportedly read a February 2000 draft and asked for a rewrite with more of an emphasis on the original Auntie Mame. Screenwriter Peter Tolan (Analyze This) took over writing Mame at this point.\n\nTolan’s screenplay cut out two of Jerry Herman’s songs. The first to go was “Saint Bridgette,” sung by the character Agnes Gooch at the top of the show. “It’s a wonderful reveal on stage, but we didn’t need it in this version,” Tolan said.\n\nPeter Tolan also excised “That’s How Young I Feel” – a big dance number sung by Mame and the chorus – and explained that since he was “writing this for Miss Streisand at the time, … I was guessing that she would probably say, ‘That’s not a sentiment that I want to express as the character,’” Tolan said. “Also, in that scene you’ve already got, ‘If He Walked into My Life.’ I felt musically, that covered it.”\n\n[Note: “If He Walked into My Life” is the big ballad in Mame by Jerry Herman and would have been sung beautifully by Streisand.]\n\nRob Marshall (Chicago, Nine) was attached to the project as its director. He thought Mame was “a role for Streisand – and how many roles are there for her? I know she has a reputation [for being difficult], but she was unbelievably relaxed and open.”\n\nStreisand, however, decided not to star in the project.\n\n“So then they went to Cher,” Rob Marshall explained. “I met with her. She's lovely and wanted to do it.”\n\nIn August 2000, Jerry Herman was a Cher-as-Mame fan, too. “I think [Cher] is the best idea since sliced bread. I want her to play Mame so badly. I have never worked with Cher and I would love to. I pray every night that she'll say yes.”\n\nMarshall dropped out of the project by 2001, however.\n\nBy 2004, Herman had inked stage deals on several of his musicals, including Mame. “That's sort of on hold, the TV movie,” Herman told Playbill. “I think we all want to do it legitimately one more time and then we'll worry about filming it. I want to see it on the stage again.”\n\nIn 2007, Herman said \"I'd love to do one perfect Mame. I think the show deserves it. It's the most difficult thing in the world. It's a star vehicle and created as one. I'd use Catherine Zeta-Jones. She'd be sensational. She's a real dancer and a real singer. She's a lady. And Mame needs to be a lady, more than anything else.”\n\nStreisand delivered the opening remarks at a 1993 all-star reading of Kramer’s play at the Roundabout Theater. That night, Kramer said, “[Barbra]'s so passionate about it. It's hard not to be moved by her passion. She's really, I don't know, she's just so much bigger than life. It's an exceptional experience to be working with her. Everyone predicted we would be at loggerheads. We're both obsessive people. But that's why we get along so well. She cares so much about the subject.”\n\nAt this point, Streisand had budgeted the film with Columbia Pictures and was determined to cast Ralph Fiennes as Ned Weeks. Fiennes was scheduled to play Hamlet in London, though. “So do I postpone this?” Barbra asked. “I think [Fiennes is] the best young actor of our time.”\n\nMeanwhile, Larry Kramer told Vanity Fair what it was like working with Streisand on the project: “She'll challenge you on every word; she'll act out the words,” he said of Barbra. “That fine-tuning—as a writer, you either love it or hate it. It's the way I work myself, especially on my novel, so I love it.”\n\nStreisand fought with Kramer: “We did have a fight about a subject I refer to in my introduction to the song 'Somewhere' in the concert, about how boring life would be if we were all the same,” she said. “To me, a perfect world would be a place in which we appreciate each other's differences. We're equal, but we're not the same. In the play, Larry has this scene with his brother in which he says, ‘I’m the same as you. Just say it.' I don't believe it! His brother is heterosexual, he's homosexual. They're equal in the eyes of God and the law, but they're not the same! So I can't put that in my movie, because I don't believe it.”\n\nKramer disagreed and felt neither eye color nor sexual preference should define people’s differences. “If one is born with blue eyes and one with brown eyes, are the two the same as people?” Kramer explained, “I could never make her understand, and after a while I just gave up.”\n\nIn 1994, some critics said Kramer’s play and Streisand’s film were already past their prime and dated. Streisand said, “I see it as a movie about everybody's right to love, and therefore it is for me a love story set against the AIDS epidemic. Like The Way We Were was set against the McCarthy period.”\n\nBut Streisand angered Kramer again in 1994 when she committed to a national concert tour instead of filming The Normal Heart.\n\nIn 1996, Columbia/Tri-Star Pictures had budgeted The Normal Heart at $32 million and Streisand wanted Kenneth Branagh to star as Ned Weeks. “I had wanted certain actors to be in it,” Streisand said, “one said he would do it, but the schedule was off. It was at a time when I had just bought my new house and was trying to design it. I didn't want to be here for construction, so I thought, I'm going to do The Mirror Has Two Faces!\"\n\n“I really felt I was being ill-used,” Larry Kramer said. “She was always telling me how much this project meant to her and how we’ve got to get it out there fast and how important it is for people with AIDS, but then she always seemed to have these other things that came in the way.”\n\nStreisand, however, showed sensitivity when she issued a statement to the press about no longer working with Kramer on The Normal Heart: “I am painfully aware of the ticking clock. Therefore, I am stepping aside.”\n\nAt this point, director John Schlesinger took over and various actors got involved, including Anthony Edwards (from TV’s E.R.), Annette Benning, and Sharon Stone.\n\nSince no film materialized, in 2001 Streisand was still working on raising finances to direct the movie version of Kramer’s play.\n\nIn 2008, Streisand signed with Hollywood talent agency, Endeavor, signaling that she would still be active in her film career. While being honored at The Kennedy Center, Streisand mentioned that she’d still like to direct The Normal Heart, but worried about balancing directing with her personal life. “I've never really been, you know, married during a directorial time in my life,\" she said. “How do you, you know, balance the personal?\"\n\nStreisand’s passion for The Normal Heart was rekindled by 2009. In an interview about the Yentl DVD, Streisand said “I've been working on [The Normal Heart] since I saw the play in 1985 and then did a screenplay in 1995. I've been trying to get it made.” Streisand said this time she would not act. “I look forward to not being in my next movie – just directing. I really care much more about the other actors' performance than I do my own.”\n\nShe told the Associate Press that she hoped to obtain the rights to Larry Kramer's play and that she’d talked to some “interesting cast members” that she did not identify.\n\nIt was Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts that Streisand attracted to the project. But by August 2010, the whole thing unraveled, with Larry Kramer once again speaking badly about Streisand to the media.\n\nStreisand set the record straight when she posted a Truth Alert on her official website in May 2011 that addressed the history of working with Kramer on The Normal Heart. In it she said:\n\nWhen I saw the play in 1985 I was very moved and immediately contacted Larry to acquire the rights. I worked for ten years, without pay, trying to get it made. After going through several drafts with Larry, I hired a writer to develop a screenplay that was faithful to Larry’s play, adapting it to make it more cinematic. But Larry refused to accept any revisions and insisted we use his screenplay. I couldn’t get any studio to commit to his version. Many fine actors were ready to commit to our version, but Larry would not allow it.\n\nWhen Larry now says I rewrote the script in order to make the woman doctor the star, marginalizing the gay characters, he is rewriting history. My objective was not to be in this movie. I only wanted to direct it and I was willing to play the doctor only if that would help get it made.\n\nEventually, when it became clear that we couldn’t raise the money to do it as a film, I thought, all right, we’ll do it on TV. At least it would reach a wide audience. But even HBO would only pay Larry $250,000 for the rights, and he would not let it go forward for anything less than $1,000,000. No studio was willing to move on it, considering the controversial subject matter and the burden of that cost.\n\nAfter ten years, the rights reverted back to Larry. But even when I had no contractual involvement, I still persisted in pressing to get The Normal Heart made, purely because I believed in the project. As my producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron can confirm, I thought that if we could get a great cast together, maybe a studio would finally finance it and we could persuade Larry to let us do it. I offered the part of the doctor to Julia Roberts because I thought she would be terrific, and when she turned us down, we approached another actress. I also asked Mark Ruffalo and Bradley Cooper to be in it, and Bradley Cooper immediately said yes to my version of the screenplay. By the way, this is not to say that it wouldn’t have been rewritten again. The work is never done until the movie is released.\n\nI think it’s unfair to blame me for the movie not getting made. After all, Larry has had the rights for the last 15 years and he couldn’t get it made, either. Those are the facts, and none of this is news to Larry.\n\nMore recently, he sent me a note before giving the project to another director, asking me again if I wanted to direct it—but only with his screenplay. As a filmmaker, I couldn’t have my hands tied like that. What if I needed to make changes? What if I needed to have something rewritten? Sadly, I turned his offer down and wished him well.\n\nIt’s been very hard for me to find a piece that I feel as passionate about. I will always believe in Larry’s play and its powerful theme about everyone’s right to love.\n\nIt should be noted that one Streisand fan managed to read Kramer's 2007 Normal Heart screenplay—this was probably Kramer's latest draft before Streisand had to turn him down. Reportedly, Kramer's screenplay was very un-cinematic. The fan says it was written “with long, preachy scenes presented in a static, overtly theatrical way... it's really nothing more than the play dressed up in screenplay form.”\n\nWhat's ironic is that Streisand knows what she's talking about here: a good play does not necessarily make a good movie ... There are cinematic issues to worry about, especially with a play that features long monologues.\n\nKramer's screenplay ended the dramatic AIDs story by having the camera pan down to W.H. Auden's poem, “September 1, 1939”—about the outbreak of World War II. The audience, therefore, would have to read a poem before the credits rolled.\n\nPerhaps Streisand was right to pass.\n\nWith a cast that includes Julia Roberts, Mark Ruffalo, Matt Bomer, Jim Parsons, Taylor Kitsch, and Joe Mantello, The Normal Heart was a 2014 HBO movie with Glee's Ryan Murphy directing."
