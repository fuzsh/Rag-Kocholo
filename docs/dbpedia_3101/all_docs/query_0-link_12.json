        "text": "Rosalind Russell broke her ankle in the first take of the scene where she comes flying down the stairs in the gown with the capri pants and shooting had to be delayed until she recovered.\n\nMorton DaCosta maintained a theatrical feel to the film's visual style throughout, including his choice to use the artistic touch of blacking out the set and fading out on Mame's face at the end of each scene. This technique was known, according to author Richard Tyler Jordan, as a \"Flanagan Fade,\" named after chief electrician at Warner Bros. Frank Flanagan, who came up with the unique flourish.\n\nPeggy Cass won the 1957 Tony Award (New York City) for Best Featured Actress in a Drama for \"Auntie Mame\" and recreated her role in the film version.\n\nReportedly, the character of Auntie Mame was based on Patrick Dennis's real-life aunt, Marian Tanner. A good-natured eccentric, who lived to be nearly one hundred years old, Ms. Tanner's advice to those seeking a more interesting, adventurous life was to never be afraid to try a new experience and to keep an open mind about everything and everybody."
