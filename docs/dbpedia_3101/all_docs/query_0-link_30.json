        "text": "Academy Award-winning actress Tilda Swinton is hoping to take on the iconic New York eccentric Auntie Mame in a new film, according to Vulture.com.\n\nSwinton, via email, reportedly asked Annie Mumolo (co-writer of Bridesmaids and Bad Moms) if she would be interested in penning a new adaptation of Patrick Dennis' 1955 novel. Mumolo told Vanity Fair, “She asked me, 'Have you read Auntie Mame? … Would you take a look at it? I want to see if you are interested in writing a modern-day adaptation.' I said yes, because you say yes to Tilda Swinton when she asks if you want to do something.”\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that Swinton and I Am Love director Luca Guadagnino were in the early stages of planning a remake of Auntie Mame, in which she would take on the leading role of Mame Dennis. Rosalind Russell famously created the role on stage in 1956 and repeated her work (with several members of the original Broadway cast) in the Academy Award-nominated 1958 film.\n\nBased on the 1955 novel by Dennis, Auntie Mame, about an orphaned boy’s unorthodox upbringing by his free-living but loving aunt, was swiftly adapted as a non-musical Broadway play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee in 1956. Morton Da Costa directed both the stage and film versions of the property. The latter had an adapted screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.\n\nJerry Herman turned the play into the 1966 Tony-nominated musical Mame, which starred Angela Lansbury. A 1974 film of the musical was released with Lucille Ball as Mame."
