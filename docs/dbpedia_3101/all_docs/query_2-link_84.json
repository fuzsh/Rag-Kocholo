        "text": "Bunny Bixler and I were in the semi-finals - the very semi-finals, mind you - of the ping-pong tournament at the club and this ghastly thing happened. We were both playing way over our heads and the score was 29-28. And we had this really terrific volley and I stepped back to get this really terrific shot. And I stepped on the ping-pong ball! I just squashed it to bits. And then Bunny and I ran to the closet of the game room to get another ping-pong ball and the closet was locked! Imagine? We had to call the whole thing off. Well, it was ghastly. Well, it was just ghastly.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nLaura \"Bunny\" Bixler\n\nFriends and family today paid tribute to New York socialite Laura “Bunny” Bixler following her death at the age of 75 from complications of jaw surgery.\n\nThe cooking-oil heiress was perhaps best known for her expose of the country club life of New York’s privileged young in the late 1950s. Her book: “Just Ghastly: What Happened At The Game-room Closet.” enjoyed surprising success when it came out in 1962. The book is held to be at least partially responsible for halting what many thought was a dangerous tendency toward inter-breeding among the social register’s top families.\n\nMuriel Puce said of her long-time friend: “Bunny never really got over that ping-pong ball incident at the club when we were all at the Upper Richmond Girl’s School. It kind of haunted her. And Gloria (Gloria “Little Glory” Upson) was forever telling the story, everywhere she went – every party! We were all sick of hearing about it.”\n\nBunny, who lived at her family’s apartment at Park Ave and 71st, succumbed to a massive heart attack while undergoing temporomandibular joint surgery last week. She had suffered chronic jaw pain for most of her life due to the clenched-teeth style of talking preferred by east coast debutantes.\n\nMourners described Bunny as “really, top drawer.”\n\nWHY do you keep writing about this piece of shit Lucille Ball movie? I've seen your other posts on this same movie in the past. Why is your dick so hard for this crappy movie when the 1958 one with Rosalind Russell is a true and forever classic? Lucille Ball should never have been given this part. She just wasn't good enough to play this character. As Lucy fans worldwide know Ball for her outrageous housewife gig for years and years, that doesn't mean she's a good or even great actress. Put her in an expensive period piece musical and old clothes and surround her with great actors and the movie would still turn out to be a piece of shit! As the old saying goes, \"you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\"\n\nScreenwriters Comden and Green came up with the hydraulic furniture and a few other things that weren't in the play. Stage authors Lawrence and Lee believed that Rosalind Russell prevented them from being hired by Warner Bros. to write the film script as payback. The egotistic Russell dearly wanted the producers to close the Broadway show when she left it to make the movie. She went as far as to leak \"inside info\" to the NY press that the show would have to close and never tour when she left it, as though it were bound to fail without her. Lawrence and Lee emphatically argued to the producers that, wonderful as she was, the play was good too and it would run without Russell. And so it did, first with Greer Garson then with Bea Lillie. Russell never forgave the writers for defending their own work in defiance of her vanity.\n\nTechnically, Roz did sing every note in GYPSY. She did not record any advance tracks (which would have forced her have to listen to her own inept singing in front of other people.) She went straight to the set and sang the songs live, croaking away as the cameras rolled. In pre-release publicity, she made much of the fact that she did her own singing. But the results were so intolerable that the filmmakers called in Lisa Kirk to dub most of Roz's vocals. She was forced to match Russell's scatter-shot approach, which accounts for the odd phrasing here and there from the usually meticulous Kirk. Of course, after selling the idea that she did her own singing, Russell never admitted that she had been dubbed after all.\n\n[quote]Was she that bad earlier in her career?\n\nRoz was a surprise casting choice as Sylvia in The Women. George Cukor had planned to go with Ilka Chase who created the role on Broadway. Russell had never comedy before but her audition for Cukor convinced him that she could pull it off. Although the movie established her as a comedienne, In her autobiography, Russell blames Cukor for the broadness of her performance. She claims she had intended to play the role in a more subdued and realistic manner (as was the fashion in movies when Roz wrote her book.) She says she had given Cukor several versions of how Sylvia might be played and it was he and not her who insisted she go as far over the top as she did.\n\nStill, the buzz during filming of The Women was that Roz was doing Oscar-worthy work in a Supporting Role. Russell waited until enough of her role had been filmed to suddenly demand that she receive star billing over the title of the movie, alongside Shearer and Crawford. Perhaps it was hubris on her part. Maybe she wanted to be considered for a best leading lady Oscar (which required billing over the title) but Cukor and MGM were firm in refusing her. Russell responded by calling out sick for days. She let the studio know that nothing would cause her to recover but star billing. Finally they relented and put her name above the title of the movie in the credits and all publicity - but only in smaller letters than Shearer and Crawford who were, along with Garbo, MGM's biggest female stars."
