Casper and the Angels: Stars & Frights features five frightening episodes starring the friendliest ghost of them all. Viewers will enjoy Casper's creepy capers in "Love at First Fright," "Prehistoric Hi-Jinx," "The Impossible Scream," "T.V. or Not T.V.," and "Count Fatula." A later incarnation of the popular 1950s animated series Casper the Friendly Ghost, the 1970s version, Casper and the Angels, had the little ghost on adventures with two female sidekicks in outer space. A ghost always more interested in making friends than haunting houses, Casper returned to network TV in the late '90s.
