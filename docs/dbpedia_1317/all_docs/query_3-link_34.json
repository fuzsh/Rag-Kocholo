They contain 3 Acts, meaning that one episode is about 6 months long.\n\nDespite being the biggest part of the VALORANT calendar, episodes don’t bring much more unique content than an Act would; large additions like agents, game modes, and maps are all released in Acts. A new episode does however have an effect on Competitive. Players will receive a buddy based on their highest Act Rank they achieved during the previous episode, and their ranks will receive a soft reset. Players must play 5 placement games at the start of a new episode before they are given a rank for it.[1]\n\nA new episode is also usually accompanied by a new cinematic that takes place within the lore of VALORANT.\n\nList of Episodes[]\n\nEpisode Splash Art Launch Date Episode 09: COLLISION June 25, 2024 Episode 08: DEFIANCE January 9, 2024 Episode 07: EVOLUTION June 27, 2023 Episode 06: REVELATION January 10, 2023 Episode 05: DIMENSION June 22, 2022 Episode 04: DISRUPTION January 11, 2022 Episode 03: REFLECTION June 22, 2021 Episode 02: FORMATION January 12, 2021 Episode 01: IGNITION June 2, 2020\n\nReferences[]"
