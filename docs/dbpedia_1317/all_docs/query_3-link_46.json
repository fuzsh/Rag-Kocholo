        "text": "The adventures of the Ingalls Family continue in Season Seven of “Little House on the Prairie.” The original episodes aired from September 22, 1980, to May 11, 1981.\n\nIn Season 7, change is in the air! Laura and Almanzo say, “I do.” Adam’s sight returns and he and Mary open a law practice. Laura begins teaching. Nellie’s pregnancy ignites a dispute. Albert’s love for Sylvia stirs rumors. The Ingalls consider adoption. These and many other exciting adventures continue through the seventh season of “Little House on the Prairie.”\n\nFor the first time since their original TV broadcast, all twenty-four Season 7 episodes are presented complete and uncut and newly restored and remastered for optimal picture and sound quality! In this ultimate Season 7 episode guide, you’ll relive all of the heartwarming adventures and learn some new facts along the way. Some of our favorite facts and tidbits come from Alison Arngrim’s autobiography and Melissa Gilbert’s memoir. Below is a complete index with links to the Season 7 episodes:\n\nSeason 7, Episode 1 – Laura Ingalls Wilder Pt. 1\n\nSeason 7, Episode 2 – Laura Ingalls Wilder Pt. 2\n\nSeason 7, Episode 3 – A New Beginning\n\nSeason 7, Episode 4 – Fight Team Fight!\n\nSeason 7, Episode 5 – The Silent Cry\n\nSeason 7, Episode 6 – Portrait of Love\n\nSeason 7, Episode 7 – Divorce, Walnut Grove Style\n\nSeason 7, Episode 8 – Dearest Albert, I’ll Miss You\n\nSeason 7, Episode 9 – The In-laws\n\nSeason 7, Episode 10 – To See the Light Pt. 1\n\nSeason 7, Episode 11 – To See the Light Pt. 2\n\nSeason 7, Episode 12 – Oleson Versus Oleson\n\nSeason 7, Episode 13 – Come, Let Us Reason Together\n\nSeason 7, Episode 14 – The Nephews\n\nSeason 7, Episode 15 – Make a Joyful Noise\n\nSeason 7, Episode 16 – Goodbye, Mrs. Wilder\n\nSeason 7, Episode 17 – Sylvia Pt. 1\n\nSeason 7, Episode 18 – Sylvia Pt. 2\n\nSeason 7, Episode 19 – Blind Justice\n\nSeason 7, Episode 20 – I Do, Again\n\nSeason 7, Episode 21 – The Lost Ones Pt. 1\n\nSeason 7, Episode 22 – The Lost Ones Pt. 2\n\nSeason 7, Episode 1 – Laura Ingalls Wilder Pt. 1\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nAlmanzo is eager to begin building a home for himself and his fiancé Laura on the piece of land he recently purchased. He hires his friend Harve Miller to assist him with his crop and to help take care of Eliza Jane’s house. Eliza Jane develops a fondness for Harve – feelings might not be mutual. Meanwhile, Laura is offered a teaching job at a faraway school.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nWhile talking to Laura about “giving up certain dreams,” when you get married, Caroline mentions that there were things she wanted to do, like continuing to teach. However, she couldn’t because she had her new married life to focus on. This doesn’t match up with what she told Mary in Season 3’s “I’ll Ride the Wind,” when she claimed that she didn’t remember the girl she was or the dreams she had before meeting Charles.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn the scene right after Harriet faints in Church, we see the congregation leaving. Eliza Jane is walking arm-in-arm with Harv. Given the way the small town of Walnut Grove typically is, it’s strange that nobody noticed this and thought it was odd that Eliza Jane suddenly had a beau. At the very least, you’d think that gossipmonger Harriet Oleson would have spread that information around as quickly as possible.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nThis season marks Laura’s decision to ditch her braids for good and wear her hair in a bun. It is also the first time little Carrie begins wearing braids. She always used to wear it down, like Mary, but now that Laura has grown up and has gotten rid of her braids, it appears that Carrie is stepping up as the Ingalls family’s little schoolgirl.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 2 – Laura Ingalls Wilder Pt. 2\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nAlmanzo’s dreams of building a home do not go as planned, forcing him to postpone the wedding until he can get back on his feet. Laura suggests an idea for them to earn some money, but it ultimately drives a wedge into their relationship.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nWhen Charles and Almanzo are eating together during lunch break, Charles tells him that positive means “wrong at the top of your voice.” This was the second time this expression was used on the show. The first instance was during Season 5’s “The Lake Kezia Monster” between Kezia and Reverend Alden.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAlbert and the rest of the kids are missing because Charles and Caroline had gone to visit Adam and Mary for their anniversary. Laura and Almanzo drove up to tell them they were getting married. They decided, spur of the moment, to get married right then.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nLaura says that school is out for the mid-year break, and she will begin teaching in Radner in a few weeks. This leads us to believe that it’s winter break. Laura and Almanzo get married on the same day that Laura was supposed to go to Radner to teach. The problem is that later in the episode, it is stated that Laura and Almanzo get married on Mary and Adam’s anniversary, which is on August 15, as stated in Season 5’s “The Wedding.” How could the wedding date be August 15 if the mid-year break is just ending?\n\nSeason 7, Episode 3 – A New Beginning\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nJonathan and Andy Garvey move to Sleepy Eye in a quest to rebuild their lives.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nRight before Patrick Labyorteaux (Andrew) gets assaulted, you can hear him whistling, “Oh! Susanna.” He also sang this song with Laura, Mary, and Carrie in Season 4’s “The Wolves” when they were in a frightening situation.\n\nDid you know?\n\nEven though it’s been a while since Alice Garvey died, this is the first time since that horrific Season 6 episode, “May We Make Them Proud,” that we see Jonathan and Andy talk about it and grieve together. In fact, when Alice died, Jonathan was very standoffish and didn’t do much to help his young son through the tragedy. This can be counted as the first time that they really let it all out.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 4 – Fight Team Fight!\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nA former football star settles back into his childhood town of Walnut Grove with his wife and son, and he shows an active interest in coaching the boys’ football team. Although his intentions are good, he ends up overexerting the kids with long practices and a philosophy that values winning at all costs.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nIn this episode, touchdowns are worth 6 points. But in Season 5’s “The Winoka Warriors,” touchdowns are only worth 2 points. Furthermore, this episode’s game allows field goals and extra points, which were not a part of the game in “The Winoka Warriors.”\n\nDid you know?\n\nWalnut Grove now has a boys’ football team, but Albert can be heard mentioning that it used to be fun when they did it last year. However, there was absolutely no indication that the town ever had a team before.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 5 – The Silent Cry\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nTwo young brothers, deserted by their parents and desperately trying to stay together, run away from the Sleepy Eye orphanage on the eve of the adoption that will separate them. They then find an unlikely ally in grumpy old handyman, Houston Lamb.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nIn the end, when Adam is talking to Houston, the old man hurries out. Adam turns and seems to follow him with his eyes. It’s brief, and Adam could have been using his hearing. Judge for yourself.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThis episode has the exact same storyline from Bonanza, Season 14 Episode 10, “The Sound of Sadness,” which was also written and directed by Michael Landon.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 6 – Portrait of Love\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nBelieving that she was abandoned at an orphanage as a child because she was losing her sight, blind artist Annie Crane angrily refuses her seriously ill birth mother’s request to meet her.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nThe passage Reverend Alden reads as his benediction is Psalm 1:1-2.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAnnie knows how to paint landscapes accurately because she went blind only as a toddler. But the portrait she paints of herself and her birth mother at the end is impossible: she has no idea what her birth mother looked like many years later, and no idea what she herself grew up to look like.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 7 – Divorce, Walnut Grove Style\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nNewlyweds Laura and Almanzo have been having some relatively harmless arguments lately, but it reaches a whole new level when Laura suspects that he’s cheating on her, then decides to leave him. Elsewhere, Charles is the proud owner of a beautiful new glass window, but installing it is a little more challenging than he anticipated.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nWhen Almanzo runs into Brenda Sue for the very first time, he gives her a perfectly normal, “Hello, how are you doing?” He goes on to say that he hasn’t seen her in months. It was clear that Brenda Sue was an unexpected out-of-town visitor in this episode. If an old friend walked up to you out of the blue after all that time, wouldn’t you be surprised to see them? The way Almanzo greeted her, you would have thought that he saw her every day of his life.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWhen Laura says to Brenda Sue, “No, you witch! I found out!” and pushes her down, you can see that Melissa Gilbert (Laura) is on the brink of laughter, but they cut the camera away from her face just in time.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nNotice the black, jagged imprints of dirt that are caked on Laura’s face when Caroline pulls her away from Brenda Sue after their fistfight. Those marks are much lighter and positioned differently in the next scene when Laura and Caroline are talking in the restaurant kitchen.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 8 – Dearest Albert, I’ll Miss You\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nTo sharpen writing skills and increase cultural awareness in her classroom, Laura arranges for her students to correspond with children from other areas. Albert connects immediately with his pen pal, but as it turns out, they are both going to unhealthy lengths to impress each other in their letters.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nMost people did not have a picture of themselves and almost never had copies made of the one picture they might have had. The Bartons may seem well-off, but even wealthy people didn’t typically have copies made. It is less realistic, then, that Leslie would be able to send a copy of a picture to Albert, or that Albert would be able to afford a picture of his “team” to send to her.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn this episode, the newly-married Laura becomes Walnut Grove’s latest teacher. However, women at that time were generally barred from teaching after marriage. In fact, the real Laura Ingalls Wilder never taught school again after marrying Almanzo on August 25, 1885. This TV series depicted many married women teaching: Laura, Alice Garvey, and even Harriet and Caroline for temporary periods of time. Miss Beadle, too, kept teaching for a while after she was married and pregnant.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nThis episode is set in the 1880s, and Leslie is apparently playing basketball. However, James Naismith didn’t invent the sport until 1893. The real Laura Ingalls Wilder would have been 26 years old.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 9 – The In-laws\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nCharles and Almanzo expand their business by delivering goods to Sleepy Eye. After arguing about the quickest way to get there, they decide to make it a race, which produces interesting results.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nSince the wager is to see who can get to Sleepy Eye the fastest, it seems that Charles won since he arrived first. He may not have gotten there by noon, but he did beat Almanzo. Why Charles had to buy Almanzo supper, then, is a mystery.\n\nFavorite Quote!\n\nKavendish: “Listen, if there was a shorter way to Sleepy Eye, why ain’t there no road?”\n\nCharles Ingalls: “You sound like my wife.”\n\nKavendish: “I’m surprised a man fellow like you could be married… to anybody with sense…”\n\nSeason 7, Episode 10 – To See the Light Pt. 1\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nA freak accident threatens Adam’s life, but when he wakes up, he realizes that his eyesight has returned. Everyone is thrilled for him, but Mary becomes concerned when he decides to abandon his teaching career and pursue another lifelong dream. Meanwhile, Harriet is determined to lose a few pounds after her son-law makes some negative comments about her weight.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nHarriet and Nels say they own their town’s telephone system. However, this was not possible in the 1880’s. Small towns did not have switchboards or telephone systems until after 1893 when Alexander Graham Bell’s patents expired.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWhen Harriet is in the pantry at the restaurant, she picks a doughnut up from a serving platter and puts her tongue on it before deciding against eating it. But instead of throwing it away, she puts it back on the plate of doughnuts in the pantry where it will inevitably be served to a customer.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nIn this episode, after Adam regains his sight, he is oblivious to Mary’s feelings for a long time. You would think he’d have more sensitivity about it. When the tables were turned in Season 5’s “The Enchanted Cottage” and Mary was the one who had a chance at getting her eyesight back, Adam had feelings of inadequacy about it.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 11 – To See the Light Pt. 2\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nAs his heart swells with hope for a law career, Adam heads to Minneapolis for the big exam, but nothing seems to go his way once he arrives there. Will achieving his dream prove to be more than he can handle after all? Back in Walnut Grove, Harriet struggles with her diet, and Nels believes that a visit from her thin, beautiful cousin Miriam will motivate her to stick with it.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nWhen Mary puts an emotional plea forward to the professor, it is very weak. If she had said that Adam was unable to attend due to circumstances beyond his control, such as the mugging and the illness, it would have been a better case.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn the final scene, Harriet tells Miriam that they will be having Waldorf Salad for lunch. This seems unlikely, since Waldorf Salad wasn’t invented until 1893.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 12 – Oleson Versus Oleson\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nA female activist arrives in Walnut Grove to encourage the men to share equal property rights with their wives. After getting into a huge fight about it with her husband, Harriet Oleson goes to live at the hotel. Matters worsen when Caroline decides to follow Harriet’s lead, setting off a firestorm that threatens even the town’s most close-knit families.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nIn the scene where all the men have gathered in the church, you see Mr. Foster holding his twin girls. Apparently, there is a stain on one of the dresses, so someone tells Mr. Foster that hot water will take the stain right out. Actually though, cold water removes stains whereas hot water only sets them.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn the scene where Charles is trying desperately to feed a crying Grace, listen closely for when he says, “Come on, please eat. Daddy made it. Pa made it.” It is very surprising that this made the final cut. The word “Daddy” was never used on the show; it was always Pa, Papa, or Father. Calling your father “Dad” or “Daddy” was not a common practice during that time period.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nWhen Laura wants Charles and Caroline to meet at the church to try to work out their dispute, she goes to her parents’ house and enters the barn while Charles is milking the cow. Charles wishes her a good morning. Laura asks Charles to meet Caroline at the church at 2:00 pm. Charles immediately quits in the middle of milking because he wants to get cleaned up. If Charles plans to meet Caroline at 2:00 pm, why is he in a hurry to wash up if it was still morning?\n\nSeason 7, Episode 13 – Come, Let Us Reason Together\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nWhen Percival’s parents Benjamin and Edna arrive for a visit, Harriet and Benjamin clash over their grandchild’s religious upbringing. Nellie’s joyous pregnancy is tainted by the acrimony, but the families eventually reach an unusual agreement.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nIn the scene where the Oleson’s, Nellie, Percival, and his parents are getting ready to sit down to dinner at the restaurant, Benjamin says: “Not pork chops, I hope?” And Percival says, “No, Papa. Baked ham.” It is against Jewish custom to have pork of any kind. That includes ham. Michael Landon, being Jewish himself, should have known that and changed the script to have them eat something else, like chicken.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWhen Alison Arngrim (Nellie) did a commentary for this episode on the Season 7 DVD set, she offered some interesting trivia. According to Jewish tradition, a new father does not have contact with the wife for 1-2 months, depending on whether the baby is a boy or girl. In this episode, we see Percival and Nellie snuggling and kissing shortly after the birth. Percival obviously isn’t following that custom.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 14 – The Nephews\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nWhile Almanzo is eager to start a family with Laura, she is not ready to give up her teaching career just yet. He is determined to change Laura’s mind, so he offers to care for his brother Royal’s two young sons while he and his wife are on vacation. This proves to be an unfortunate mistake.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nIn this episode, Royal has two sons and no daughters. A season and a half later, in Season 9’s “Times Are Changing,” Royal comes to Walnut Grove with one daughter and no sons. Almanzo says it’s been ten years since he last saw Royal, and Laura implies that she’s never met Royal before.\n\nDid you know?\n\nNotice the scene where the boys are throwing food at dinner, and Laura grabs them and takes them upstairs. When she first lunges at them, you can tell that Melissa Gilbert, who plays Laura, is laughing when she’s supposed to be furious.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nRoyal tries to bribe the boys to be good by offering them an Indian head nickel, which is a “buffalo nickel.” Those weren’t issued until 1913.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 15 – Make a Joyful Noise\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nFormer boxer Joe Kagan moves to Sleepy Eye and offers his assistance with the maintenance of the blind school while Adam and Houston are out of town. Joe is clearly in love with Hester Sue, but she refuses to get involved. Later, when she is unable to get through to a struggling student, Hester Sue questions her teaching abilities and ends up making some foolish choices.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nWhen Moses Gunn first appears as boxer Joe Kagan in Season 4’s “The Fighter,” Ketty Lester plays his long-suffering wife, Janie. Ms. Lester later debuts as Hester Sue Terhune in Season 5’s “Blind Journey” and plays this character for the remainder of the series.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAt the wedding, Hertzell, his best man, and the organist are all wearing suits from the early 1980s.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nWhen Hester Sue finds Joe Kagan painting her bedroom, she walks out without closing the door. Yet we hear the door slam.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 16 – Goodbye, Mrs. Wilder\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nLaura resigns from her teaching position when she is forced to integrate French and art appreciation into the curriculum. Mrs. Oleson takes over the position and begins to alter the classroom instruction, while Laura struggles to accept her role as a full-time housewife. The students, meanwhile, are frustrated with their new teacher and hatch a plan to get things back to normal.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nAt the beginning of this episode, Laura is teaching the students about New York City. She is describing the five separate boroughs and mentions that the Brooklyn Bridge is still under construction. Assuming this episode takes place in either 1884 or 1885, both of these descriptions are inaccurate. At that time, the bridge was already complete, and the five boroughs of New York hadn’t yet become merged.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAlbert is usually a top student, yet he makes a very poor showing in this episode. It’s more than reasonable to assume he just didn’t want to learn from Mrs. Oleson after she took over the class, but he also wasn’t even able to answer Laura’s questions early in the episode. Where’s the smart, doctor-bound Albert we know?\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nWhen Mrs. Oleson demands that the children wear uniforms, they all have them on Mrs. Oleson’s first day which is the same day after Laura quits. How do all those kids get those uniforms in less than 24 hours? It’s extremely unlikely that Mrs. Oleson would have stocked such a large quantity of school uniforms in the store. Second, according to Laura in an earlier scene, many of the school children come from “desperately poor families” yet they all have those expensive uniforms the very next day. In a class that large, it’s interesting that none of the parents objected to this.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 17 – Sylvia Pt. 1\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nAn attractive, yet painfully insecure teenage girl named Sylvia becomes the victim of a violent rapist. As she deals with her domineering father and attempts to keep her secret at school, Albert serves as an unexpected source of comfort for her. A romance soon blossoms and all is well until Sylvia is revealed to be pregnant.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nDoc Baker tells Sylvia’s father that she is pregnant even though that is a taboo word that was rarely spoken until after World War II.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIt is amazing how often they show the telephone being used. Realistically, farm communities at that time had no telephone service whatsoever. Even though the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, it was not legally recognized until the 1890s.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 18 – Sylvia Pt. 2\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nRumors fly around town that Albert is the father of Sylvia’s unborn child. Despite Mr. Webb’s threatening objections, the young couple continues to meet secretly and grow in their affection for one another. Albert becomes a source of solace in Sylvia’s life, but he is not able to protect her from the dangerous rapist, who cons an unsuspecting Albert into informing him of Sylvia’s whereabouts.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nCharles gets mad at Albert for talking about marrying Sylvia because Albert is only 14 years old. However in the Season 3 episode “I’ll Ride the Wind,” Charles says Mary can get married a year and a half from that point. She would only have been 15 years old. Charles does not mind Mary talking about marriage at age 13, but acts as if Albert is way too young at age 14.\n\nFavorite Quote!\n\nCaroline Ingalls: “Mrs. Oleson, on Sunday I will go to church. And I will ask God to forgive me for this.” [Picks up bread dough and slaps it on Mrs. Olseon’s face]\n\nCaroline Ingalls: “But to tell you the truth, I think the Good Lord would have done the same thing!”\n\nCaroline Ingalls: [to Nellie as she leaves the restaurant] “I’ll be back in 15 minutes. Make sure your mother’s gone.”\n\nSeason 7, Episode 19 – Blind Justice\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nAdam is thrilled to be a lawyer, but is unable to find a job. With no other options available, he decides to leave the blind school in Hester Sue’s hands, pack up with Mary, and become Walnut Grove’s very first lawyer. His first client is Edgar Mills, a man who seems to have swindled the townspeople into purchasing a worthless piece of land.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nAt the end of the episode, the judge reveals that Mrs. Oleson has offered Mrs. Mills a job should she choose to live in Walnut Grove, and Dr. Baker will provide for the family for as long as they live there. It would seem that either Mrs. Mills chose not to take him up on the offer, or did so for a very limited (and non-visible) time. We never saw anyone else working for the Oleson’s beside Caroline and Hester Sue.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nActress Barbara Collentine, who plays Edna Mills in this episode, is the wife of Richard Bull (Nels Oleson).\n\nSeason 7, Episode 20 – I Do, Again\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription\n\nPregnancy symptoms hit both Laura and her mother Caroline. It turns out Caroline is not pregnant at all but is beginning menopause, and she sinks into depression. Her husband and daughters desperately try to convince her that they love her for the person she is, not for the person she wanted to be. Finally, Charles proposes that he and Caroline renew their wedding vows.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nApparently, Laura is two months pregnant in this episode and its springtime. Caroline, who also believes that she’s pregnant, tells Doc Baker that she expects her baby will be due at the beginning of the new year, which is obviously January. But if you remember the birth of Laura’s baby in Season 8, it does not appear to be winter, as it should be, if Laura learns she is two months along in the spring.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Poulsen family house is clearly the same house that the Oleson’s live in. It’s pretty obvious when they are eating in the dining room, but they really give it away when Eunice and Myra Louise are upstairs with Caroline showing her the dress that she can wear when she renews her vows with Charles. It’s clear as day that the same set is used for Nels and Harriet’s bedroom is used here also.\n\nMore Trivia!\n\nIn this episode, Caroline is distraught to learn that she is “going through the change.” But strangely, in the Season 4 episode “A Most Precious Gift,” she mistakes her pregnancy for menopause and is very accepting of it. Why would she be significantly more upset now? Granted, she gets her hopes up too high about the possible pregnancy, and that probably contributes to her sadness. However, you’d think in that Season 4 episode, she’d be more upset about the idea of not being able to conceive anymore, especially since she (mistakenly) believes Charles will think less of her now that she is no longer fertile.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 21 – The Lost Ones Pt. 1\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nWhile making an out-of-town delivery, Albert and Charles meet and travel with the Cooper family. An accident occurs en route with the parents, and in the blink of an eye, their two young children are orphans. Unable to place them with any family members, and not in a position to adopt them himself, Charles is forced to hand them over to the state…until a spontaneous decision changes everything.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nWhen Charles, James, Cassandra, and Albert are praying at the Coopers’ graves, it is implied that Charles pulled them out of the rubble and dug them two graves with his bare hands. Yet Charles’ hands and clothes are completely spotless.\n\nDid you know?\n\nCharles says to Albert that the people at the Sleepy Eye orphanage seem nice. But in Season 7’s “Silent Cry,” there is a much different opinion about how the head of the orphanage doesn’t care about splitting up two brothers.\n\nSeason 7, Episode 22 – The Lost Ones Pt. 2\n\nBuy Now!\n\nDescription:\n\nJames and Cassandra go home with Charles and they adjust quickly with the Ingalls family and their new school. Just as they are beginning to thrive again, a pair of adoptive parents come along, but their ulterior motives may put the children in danger.\n\nFun Fact!\n\nWhen Carrie notices that Albert and Charles are home with James and Cassandra, she runs into the house screaming to her Ma that they’re back. You can hear her say, “Ma! Pa! They’re back!” But that wouldn’t make sense since Ma is the only one there. You have to really listen closely, though, because otherwise, you might not notice.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAt one point in this episode after Charles agrees to let the Tompkins adopt the children, Caroline (without saying it upfront) tries sweet-talking him into adopting them himself. Charles snaps back, “Do you think this isn’t hard for me?” He goes on to say that he has a hard enough time providing for his own children. The same conversation takes place between the couple in the Season 2 episode, “Remember Me, Part 2,” when Charles is in a similar predicament with the three Sanderson orphans.\n\nBack to the episode guide"
