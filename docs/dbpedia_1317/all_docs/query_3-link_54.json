        "text": "“S.W.A.T.” is back for one last ride. Inspired by the 1975 series and 2003 film of the same name, the action-packed CBS series stars Shemar Moore as former marine turned S.W.A.T. Sergeant Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson.\n\nHondo’s been leading his team through the streets of Los Angeles on the most dangerous, high-stakes missions in town since 2017 — until CBS announced the series was canceled and the Season 6 finale would be their last. But never doubt the power of the people… or Hondo’s leadership. Moore rallied fans on social media, and just days later, CBS reversed their decision and renewed “S.W.A.T.” for a seventh and final season.\n\nFor everything you need to know about how to watch “S.W.A.T” Season 7, read below:\n\nWhen does “S.W.A.T.” Season 7 premiere?\n\n“S.W.A.T.” returns to CBS on Friday, Feb. 16.\n\n“S.W.A.T.” Season 7 episode release schedule\n\nNew episodes will premiere on Fridays on CBS at 8:00-9:00 p.m. ET.\n\nCBS has revealed episode details for the first three episodes, which you can see below.
