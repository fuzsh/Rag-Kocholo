        "text": "Introducing The Chosen, Season 1, Ep 1: “I Have Called You By Name”\n\nLooking for a new TV show to binge (for free)? Interested in ancient Judeo-Christian history? Like to see old tales told in fresh, creative ways?\n\nThen you have to watch the sleeper hit called: The Chosen — a retelling of the stories of Jesus and the disciples as you’ve never seen it before.\n\nIn the first episode, we meet a demon-possessed woman, two brothers getting to the end of their rope, a social outcast with a “unique” job and condition, and a religious leader whose entire worldview is about to get shaken to the core.\n\nAnd in this article, I’ll be pulling apart this episode with background info and commentary on the craft/creativity side of this retelling.\n\nAbout The Chosen\n\nThe Chosen is not only entertaining and thought-provoking, it’s also a multi-season “binge-able” TV series based on the life of Christ and his disciples. It’s the biggest crowdfunded project in the history of TV crowdfunding, not just for faith-based projects, but ever (raising millions of dollars from tens of thousands of donors).\n\nWhat makes The Chosen unique is the show creators’ approach to the characters of Jesus and the disciples. In many gospel retellings, Jesus is portrayed as holier and more distant than “normal humans.”\n\nBut in The Chosen, both Jesus and his disciples are down-to-earth, relatable people: Jesus has a believable sense of humor and the disciples are seriously yet lovably flawed.\n\nAnd because this is a multi-episode, multi-season show, the show is able to explore some of the most intriguing stories in the gospels with much more time and care and depth.\n\nGranted, this is a retelling and many elements of the story are altered, as the show itself reminds viewers in the episode 1 disclaimer:\n\nBut what it has been able to do with the source material is nothing short of amazing.\n\nIn this review, I’ll be summarizing the episode (spoiler alert!) with some context and background information as needed. I’ll save the more lengthy background discussion for after the summary section.\n\nThen, at the end, for writers: I’ll take a look at some elements within the writing and storytelling to examine what makes the entire piece work so well.\n\nMAJOR SPOILER ALERT: Read this article AFTER you’ve seen the show, which you can watch for free at https://watch.angelstudios.com/thechosen\n\nThe show creators’ goal is to spread the word to a billion people around the world, so they decided to make the show free for anyone who would like to see it.\n\nIf you are able and would like to contribute financially so others who can’t afford to pay can still watch for free, you can pay it forward by buying clothes, books, and DVDs from their gift shop or via direct donation.\n\nSummary\n\nThe story begins on a night in Magdala, in 2 B.C., when a little girl approaches her father, who is coughing outside the tent.\n\nShe tells him she can’t sleep because she is scared. The child’s father takes her on his knee and comforts her with the words of Isaiah:\n\nBut now, this is what the Lord says —\n\nhe who created you, Jacob,\n\nhe who formed you, Israel:\n\n“Fear not, for I have redeemed you;\n\nI have summoned you by name; you are mine.” [emphasis added] Isaiah 43:1\n\n(Note: Pay attention to those last three words in the above Bible passage— they come back.)\n\nThe final shot of the scene ends on the little wooden doll that the child clutches in her hands as she sits in her father’s embrace.\n\nNext, the camera shifts to a bedraggled-looking woman who wakes up with a start and discovers blood all over her hands.\n\nBeside her on the wall is an older-looking wooden doll. The same doll that the child was holding in the earlier scene.\n\nIt’s the little girl from Scene 1, all grown up:\n\nOutside, a man screams for help, blood dripping down his face. As he stumbles into startled pedestrians and a Roman soldier who calls him a “filthy dog,” he cries that a demon-possessed woman tried to kill him.\n\nAnd at this dramatic moment, we cut to the opening credits:\n\nAs the cast and crews’ names appear on the screen, a crowd of gray fish swims slowly counterclockwise.\n\nBut one by one, 13 fish turn blue and begin swimming against the current, as a gospel-style opening song plays in the background, accompanied by electric guitars, percussion, and traditional-middle-eastern-sounding string instruments.\n\nThere is a quick shot of Matthew and Gaius in line to see Quintus, and then the camera takes us to Lillith as she follows the dove back to the city and returns to the tavern.\n\nA local man tries to harass her, but the tavern owner chases him off:\n\nLillith asks for more wine. The tavern owner protests that it won’t help her, but when Lillith says please, he acquiesces.\n\nBut when Lillith reaches for the wine, a Stranger’s hand covers hers. Lillith looks up and sees his face:\n\nLillith immediately has a headache, and rushes out of the tavern, wine cup in hand, but The Stranger follows. “Leave me alone!” she says. But he calls her name:\n\n“Mary!…Mary of Magdala.”\n\nLillith/Mary drops the cup she had in her hand and it shatters on the ground.\n\n“Who are you? How do you know my name?”\n\nThe Stranger answers with the words of Isaiah:\n\n“Thus says the Lord who created you\n\nAnd He who formed you\n\nFear not, for I have redeemed you\n\nI have called you by name\n\n…You are mine.”\n\nThen Jesus (because of course that’s who The Stranger is), puts his hands on Mary’s temples, and she bursts into tears. He gently pulls her to him and lets her cry into his chest:\n\nBackground\n\nAside from the words of Isaiah, almost nothing in this first episode comes directly from the Bible. But it’s all necessary to set up the rest of the story.\n\nIn this first episode, we meet Mary Magdalene (who spends most of the show under the alias “Lillith”), a traumatized, alcoholic, demon-possessed woman at her wits’ end.\n\nWe also see fiery Simon and his longsuffering brother Andrew, poor fishermen who are in danger of losing their house and livelihood to Rome’s heavy taxes.\n\nThen there’s Matthew, the tax collector, hated by all. And Nicodemus, the great teacher (rabbi) and Pharisee who chafes under the control of the Romans and wonders if there’s more to this “God thing” than he knows.\n\nAll of these people are in the actual gospels, but the show fleshes out their backstory and personality far more than the Bible text reveals.\n\nSo far, the show writers have done their best to stick either to the original Bible stories, or to what could be plausible, based on what we know from the Bible and other historical sources.\n\nObviously, in order to produce a multi-episode, multi-season show, we’ll need a lot more background material than the Bible mentions, and so far the show has done a really intriguing job filling in unknowns and even linking different characters’ stories together:\n\nMatthew is not just some random tax collector, he is Simon and Andrew’s tax collector. (Which will make their chemistry as future teammates a lot more interesting :D)\n\nThe Bible mentions that Jesus drove seven demons from Mary Magdalene, and that’s all it says about that. In this show, however, the writers have Nicodemus try (in vain) to help her first. He fails, but then Jesus finds Mary in a tavern and heals her.\n\nThe Bible never says how or why Mary became possessed, but the show gives a plausible backstory: the early loss of her beloved father, then rape by a Roman soldier contributed to Mary’s descent into alcoholism and demon possession.\n\nThroughout the show, there are a lot of references to biblical and historical people, places, and concepts— easter eggs for those who are familiar with the original text.\n\nBut in case anyone is reading this who would like to have some more context, here are a few notes:\n\nCapernaum near the Sea of Galilee\n\nThe name Capernaum means “Nahum’s village,” and it was a small fishing village located on the North side of the Sea of Galilee. It’s also the site of many of Jesus’ miracles, the center of his activities while he was among the Jews.\n\nPharisees, Essenes, Sadducees, Zealots, Random Preachers in the Wilderness\n\nWhen Quintus and Nicodemus meet, Quintus mentions multiple Jewish groups who all claim to follow the same One God. Here are the ones he spoke of:\n\nThe Pharisees were a Jewish group that believed in resurrection and in following Jewish rules and traditions of the fathers. They were known as legal experts, and were respected and powerful in their communities. Nicodemus is a Pharisee.\n\nThe Saduccees, unlike the Pharisees, were a Jewish sect that didn’t believe in the supernatural: resurrection, spirits, or angels. They also didn’t care for the oral traditions, only the written law. They were the party of the wealthier people in society.\n\nThe Essenes are most notable for withdrawing from society and public life. They believed most of what the Pharisees believed, but did so in their own mystic, monastic way.\n\nThe Zealots were a group that believed in overthrowing their Roman oppressors by any means necessary, including violence. They were aggressive in their opposition to Roman paganism/polytheism, and were considered by some to be terrorists.\n\nRandom preachers in the wilderness: This could be a nod to John the Baptist, perhaps, but at this time in history, Jesus was not the only one who claimed to be the Messiah. There were plenty of itinerant, charismatic men who used the suffering Jewish people’s desire for a Messiah to gather followers and set themselves up as leaders. Of course, all of them were eventually cut down, most likely killed by the Romans. But Quintus could’ve been talking about any one of these people.\n\nThe Jews and the Romans\n\nAs you probably already know, Rome conquered most of Western Europe before the empire collapsed.\n\nEvery time the Romans conquered a new place, they worked hard to assimilate the locals to the “Roman way.”\n\nBut the Jews were a stubborn folk and insisted on holding on to their beliefs and religious practices.\n\nIn other words: The Jews hated Rome for their paganism and violent subjugation. The Romans hated Jews for their obstinacy and “backwards” ways.\n\nTranslation: It was not a fun time to be living in Israel.\n\nRabbi\n\n“Rabbi” is a title given to Jewish religious teachers and leaders. Nicodemus and his fellow Pharisees would be considered “rabbis” to the rest of the “ordinary people.”\n\n“Your bug-eating friend”\n\nWhen Andrew protests at the idea of Simon fishing on the Sabbath, Simon asks if he’s going to tattle to his “bug-eating friend.”\n\nHe’s referring, of course, to John the Baptist, Jesus’ cousin, who spent much of his time in the desert, baptizing people in the Jordan River after telling them to repent of their sins.\n\nIn the Bible, John the Baptist was recorded to have worn clothes made of camel hair and eaten locusts and honey.\n\nJohn’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.\n\n— Matthew 3:4–6\n\nAnd Andrew was one of John’s followers before Andrew graduated to following Jesus:\n\nThe next day John was there again with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”\n\nWhen the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus…Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.\n\n— John 1:35–40\n\nHence, Simon’s reference to Andrew’s “bug-eating friend” 🙂\n\nLillith\n\nThe Bible never mentions Mary Magdalene being an alcoholic or using “Lillith” as an alias. Just that Jesus “cast seven demons from her.” No other details given. However, the fact that the show chooses to depict her in this way is at least possible.\n\nThe name Lillith comes from Judeo-Christian mythology. She is sometimes said to be a demon, sometimes “Adam’s first wife,” before Eve. This latter idea is not in the Bible, it’s attributed to Kabbalistic beliefs.\n\nSo “Lillith” is a fitting name for Mary’s pre-deliverance alias. A woman, possessed by demons, taking on the name of a demon.\n\nShabbat\n\n“Shabbat” is the Hebrew word for “Sabbath,” aka Saturday, the weekly day of rest on which no observant Jew does any work. Sabbath/Shabbat starts from Friday sundown and ends on Saturday sundown.\n\nDuring this time, religious Jews gather with family and friends for Shabbat dinner, for services at their local synagogue, and for worshipping and reflecting on God.\n\nSabbath observance is required in the Ten Commandments, in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. That’s why Nicodemus preached against working on the Sabbath, and why Andrew was upset that Simon was fishing on the Sabbath — working on Shabbat is not allowed.\n\nTax collectors\n\nIn the time when Romans controlled Judea, the place where the Jews lived (Israel), they collected taxes from the general public using tax collectors — local Jews who volunteered to extract money from their fellow citizens to pay the Roman government.\n\nThese tax collectors were doubly hated:\n\nFirst, because they willingly collaborated with the brutal Jewish oppressors, the Romans. Second, because tax collectors almost always cheated their fellow Jews, asking for more money than was required in order to line their own pockets.\n\nAnyone who became a tax collector was ostracized and rejected from “good society.” They were counted as dirty (or dirtier) than prostitutes and lepers, and loathed.\n\nThat’s why in the show you see (and will continue to see) Matthew insulted, ignored, looked down on, and attacked by locals.\n\nGraffiti: “Messiah will destroy the Romans”\n\nBefore Jesus revealed himself, the Jewish conception of the Messiah was that he would be a warrior who would free them from Roman occupation. This was what all the disciples thought, as well, which made Jesus’ actions all the more inscrutable to them.\n\nWhich is why, when Nicodemus goes to see Lillith/Mary for the first time, viewers see graffiti on the wall, translated as “Messiah will destroy the Romans.”\n\nTo this day, non-Messianic Jews continue to watch out for their Messiah, although they no longer see him as a Rome-defeating warrior.\n\nOkay, that’s about all for now. Moving on to thoughts on the storytelling itself:\n\nThoughts on Storytelling, Writing, & Craft\n\nTo be honest, I didn’t watch The Chosen from Episode One. I actually jumped in the middle, and then went back to the first episode.\n\nAnd at first, I admit I was a bit bored by the slow pacing. But there were a few jewels that kept me watching, aside from the motivation of curiosity at seeing a new adaptation of the familiar old stories.\n\n(And as I continued watching, the series just kept getting better and better. So if you’re like me, give the show a chance by watching at least a few episodes before passing judgment!)\n\nFor one, there’s the opening credits:\n\nIn a crowd of blase gray fish, 13 fish turn blue, one by one, and start swimming against the crowd. They represent, of course, Jesus and his 12 disciples.\n\nBut they also symbolize Christians from all places, of all times. As John writes in his gospel:\n\nIf you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.\n\n— John 15:19\n\nThose who follow Jesus will always be “swimming against the current,” so to speak. So it’s very fitting, that image of the handful of blue fish swimming against the pattern established by the majority gray fish.\n\nNot to mention the “nontraditional” music for the opening credits also signals that the show creators are trying to follow Isaiah 43:19 and “do something new.”\n\nIntriguing Characterization\n\nThen, I was immediately intrigued by the show’s portrayal of Matthew the tax collector.\n\nFrom the first few seconds of watching the actor’s portrayal of Matthew, I knew the show writers had decided to depict him as having autism. Which I found really unique and intriguing. Although I never visualized the real Matthew as being on the autism spectrum, it works, for this show.\n\nConsidering that Matthew was a tax collector, hated by all, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that the whole “nobody likes me” thing may have started from before he went into Roman employ.\n\nIt makes sense that someone who already finds it difficult to socialize with others would think it a good idea to take on a job that would make him a permanent outcast.\n\nAfter all, he’s already semi-rejected by society because his brain works differently, so a little more rejection can’t hurt much, right?\n\nIt’s fun to see how the show creators fill in the blanks based on the established Bible narrative. Given Matthew’s job, plus the way he wrote his gospel (methodical, starts with a genealogy), the idea that he may have been autistic is certainly plausible. And it adds depth and complexity to his character.\n\nShow, Don’t Tell\n\nThe show writers use a lot of “show, don’t tell,” to give you need-to-know information. For example:\n\nMatthew’s status is brilliantly illustrated by his conversation with the cart driver, who is upset at seeing him waste a pair of shoes, calls him “the biggest pile of dung in Capernaum,” and dumps him outside the market gates because he doesn’t want to be seen with an “evil” tax collector.\n\nAnd Simon’s impetuous personality and growing desperation is shown by his fighting, gambling, and impulsive decision to make a bargain with the Roman Quintus to turn in his fellow Jews.\n\nOf course, there are places where the show cuts out or combines details, or overdoes the background-information a tad, but it’s not overly distracting.\n\nCircular Storytelling & Symbolism\n\nFinally, I love the use of circular storytelling and symbolism:\n\nWe start with little Mary sitting on her father’s lap as he comforts her with the words of Isaiah, even as it’s obvious that his health is declining. The verse he chooses ends with the words, “you are mine.”\n\nIn that context, “you are mine” could be said to refer to Mary’s close relationship to a kindly father.\n\nLater, we know that Mary loses her father, takes on the alias Lillith, and gets abused by a Roman soldier. It’s implied that many others also hurt her (Rivka talks about how Lillith/Mary only “hurts those who hurt her first. Mostly”).\n\nWhen we see Mary, she is at the end of her rope, ready to jump off the cliff and end her misery.\n\nBut something makes her stop and go back to town, where she meets Jesus who speaks to her the same words her father gave her when she was a child:\n\n“You are mine.”\n\nMary lost her human father many years ago, but with Jesus’ appearance on the scene, she is reconciled to her Heavenly Father, to whom she belongs even more so than to the loving father of her childhood who taught her the words of the prophet Isaiah.\n\nAreas of Improvement?\n\nIf I were to critique this episode, I would just have a few light areas of improvement:\n\nFirst, the pacing is a little slow, although I can understand why — this first episode functions as a setup for a lot more interesting things coming down the pike.\n\n(Ex: There are a couple scenes of Nicodemus preaching against fishing on the Sabbath, which makes sense for what’s going to happen in coming episodes, but I admit I kind of fast forwarded mentally through those parts, heheh ;D)\n\nSecond, I’m not sure about the demon-possession portrayals. I think mostly they did a good job. I appreciate that there weren’t extreme dramatic CGI effects taking away from the storyline. And likely in real life, demon possession is really more low-key than Hollywood likes to portray it.\n\nI just felt that someone who is possessed by seven demons might be a bit more messed-up-looking than Mary appears to be — she’s mostly disheveled and weepy and depressed, with a little bit of off-screen screaming and blood. But then again, do I really want to see her scratching someone bloody in a demonic frenzy? Nah. Would probably hurt the PG ratings too. So on second thought, this part is fine.\n\nAnd finally: When you’re writing stories, you want to connect as many dots as you can, generally speaking, but sometimes you have to be careful not to overdo it…like the fact that Simon was fighting with his brothers-in-law, when it could have been everyone, but it’s useful for him to fight with Jehoshaphat and Abraham because then the show can introduce those characters AND show off Simon’s personality at the same time.\n\nSame with Eden fake-scolding Simon for fighting with her brothers. Their conversation was a useful vehicle for fleshing out these characters’ personalities and relationship, but it felt a little bit contrived.\n\nThese are little nitpicky things, however. Overall, it’s been a solid start to a promising series on Jesus and his disciples!\n\nMore to come…\n\nReminder\n\nWatch The Chosen for free on their website, or download the app at: https://watch.angelstudios.com/thechosen"
