        "text": "CASPER AND THE ANGELS - Casper the Friendly Ghost Franchise\n\nOriginal Production Animation Drawing\n\nfrom the 1979 Hanna Barbera Episode, \"The Space Pirate\"\n\nComes with a Charles Scott Gallery COA!\n\nNOTE: there is a slight vertical fold about 1/3 of the way from the left corner - it does not affect the image and is a light fold\n\nA great Animation Production drawing (hand-drawn by an animator) and actually used to make the cel seen on camera during this cartoon that aired over 40 years ago! It is of course from the Hanna Barbera version of Casper the Friendly Ghost, named \"Casper and the Angels.\" It was set in space of all things! And this is episode 3 (each episode was comprised of 2 half episodes so this is technically #6). Very slight yellowing from age, some handling. Measures approx 10.5\" x 12.5\". We'll include a Charles Scott Gallery COA.\n\nSHIPPING COST INCLUDES PRIORITY SHIPPING AND INSURANCE!\n\nFor more wonderful artwork, see our site at www.charlesscottgallery.com"
