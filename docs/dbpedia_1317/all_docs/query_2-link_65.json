Casper refuses to join them and decides to go trick-or-treating dressed as a real boy, but neighborhood kids see through his disguise and run away in fear. Casper is heartbroken until he meets a special group of orphans who accept him for who he is, a ghost. But their fun is soon spoiled as Hairy Scary and his ghostly crew interfere. Now it is up to Casper and his new friends to stop their ghastly games and save Halloween before it is too late. --Wikipedia",

        "text": "\"Halloween is the most when you play like a ghost and you're going trick-or-treat!\"\n\nAh! What a blast from the past and I remember watching this recorded on a VHS tape from a TV broadcast when I was really young. Every Halloween season with my grandparents we would watch this one.\n\nCasper is so cute with his little red hat and glasses trying to blend in. He really is the friendly ghost!\n\nI watched this on Boomerang.\n\nThis is from Hanna Barbera in 1979 and was one of 3 Hanna Barbera Casper Projects.\n\nMy favorite is Casper and the Angels which is a 26/13 episode series (depending on how you count) where Casper is the mascot to two lady space cops as they solve mysteries. This is not currently available, but should be. Boomerang, HBO Max, VOD, I'm not overly choosy, I just want it.\n\nThe next best one is Casper's First Christmas which features Yogi Bear and the Gang. This is what I had intended to watch when I pushed play. I forgot it was a Christmas special.\n\nCasper's Halloween Specail has downtrodden Casper teaming up with downtrodden orphans.\n\nAll of the HB Casper things feature Hairy Scarey, but none of them feature any of Casper's friends from Harvey Comics.\n\nBeyond the various Hanna Barbera sounds and whatnot, this isn't very fun."
