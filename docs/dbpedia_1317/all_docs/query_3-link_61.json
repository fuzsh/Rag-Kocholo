        "text": "One Piece is one of the most iconic manga and anime of all time. Eiichiro Oda’s work has sold more copies than any other work in the manga universe, including Dragon Ball, and its transcendence has attracted tens of millions of fans around the world. With more than 1000 episodes adapted by Toei Animation since 1999; added to its numerous movies, it is easy to consider that the anime can be complicated to watch. In this article, we will tell you in what order to watch the entire anime series.\n\nThe first thing we need to make clear is that the One Piece anime follows the chronological order of the manga. There are no major changes, and it is easy to see which arcs are canon (based on the manga) and which are filler arcs (original to the anime; not canon, you can delve deeper on the differences here). While Naruto had episodes that were part canon and part filler, One Piece does not. This is the right place if you want to watch the whole anime and skip all the filler.\n\nIf you’re new to One Piece or want to attempt the monumental task of rewatching everything the series has to offer, then you’ll want to know the proper order in which to do so. As you will see below, we divide the structure of the series into two big blocks: before the time jump and after the time jump, similar to Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z or Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. And don’t worry, we won’t go into any kind of spoilers.\n\nEast Blue Saga (episodes 1-61)\n\nArabasta Saga (episodes 62-135)\n\nSky Island Saga (episodes 136-206)\n\nWater 7 Saga (episodes 207-325)\n\nThriller Bark Saga (episodes 326-384)\n\nSummit War Saga (episodes 385-516)\n\nTime Skip to The Final Sea: The New World Saga\n\nFish-Man Island Saga (episodes 517-574)\n\nDressrosa Saga (episodes 575-746)\n\nFour Emperors Saga (episodes 747- Ongoing)\n\nAll One Piece movies: order and when to watch them"
