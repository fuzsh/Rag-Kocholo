As I have read a few chapters of the upcoming arc. Considering the first two episodes were action-packed, then it slows down to build up for all the action and war, that would happen in future. Able to see some long-gone comedic corny aspects of this show. People should be patient with the build-up and enjoy ... it before it becomes more violent and dark. (8/10)\n\nMusic :\n\nThis is something about the show that could not be criticised, the music has been amazing since the first episode of MHA. Only through Ost like You Say Run I might've heard on social media, I got into this show. (9.5/10)\n\nCharacters :\n\nMHA has some of the more interesting characters than these mainstream anime with high production. Side characters have part of their growth and considerate screen time makes you care about most of the Class-A Students (Mineta is an exception). Villains especially are amazing in this show with interesting backstories and their character growth and motivation. (8.5/10)\n\nAnimation :\n\nConsidering that an MHA movie is also in production. The season looked Identical to the manga if not better. Even with the moving aspects of a large amount of characters in a single frame, Bones is doing an amazing job of maintaining the quality in a short amount of time. Also, people should stop complaining about the blue sky, it has been here since season 1. (8/10)\n\nIn the end, this might be the second last season of this show.\n\nSo, I am excited about the upcoming episodes and might as well be patient with its production.\n\nLet bones cook.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nWe are in for a RIDE!\n\nProbably the best season is in front of us, and all the build up for all these years got us here.\n\nIf you made it here I d assume you either already love the show and will enjoy it, or are a masochist, in which case you will probably also enjoy it.\n\nThe people who write negative reviews after sitting through 6 seasons, just did not realize their kink yet...coz aint no way anybody sits through 6 seasons of something they do not enjoy, which by the way is 2700+ minutes. IF you invest this much time into anything out of ... your own will, you love it - accept it!\n\nSo to all who are here, this season is exactly what you have been signing up for - for years, ENJOY!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nMy Hero Academia is almost my first anime or series. I started watching this as a great Shounen anime, and I kind of agree, but not until season 5. After season 4, they completely lost the essence of what MHN was for; still, season 5 is manageable. Notwithstanding, after that, it just fell and fell into the deep, endless pit. If someone says, what is tragedy? My answer will be MHN. MHN is the true example of tragedy.\n\nAcademy and their lives with a Shounen vibe. That's the MHN I know or want to know. Reality is cruel; I can't expect it to always be on ... my side, even though this is too harsh. In the MHN, they totally forgot and drove in the exact opposite direction, which was to reach the disaster of the MHN. All for one, one for all, All Might replacement and villain society—all those are quite predictable and exciting ideas, because everyone could at least anticipate this much. So, I'm kind of excited for—what is the afterworld of All Might? How do they build a villain society with the same qualities as a hero society? This kind of story idea is pretty common in American comics, like What'll Happen After Superman Dead and Legion of Doom? Excitement is deserving, but it all goes in vain. They can't replace All Might, they can't form a decent society that is better than a hero society, and they even can't develop a proper antagonist like All for One. And academy life has completely disappeared, and now it's totally useless to talk about that, so fuck that. Midoriya, oh Lord, give him a ball to talk rather than cry, crybaby bastard. Plus, Tomura is all for one replacement: fuck, what a joke. Tomura is nothing but a pain-ass baby.\n\nThat's all. I dropped season 7 with 1 score, which is utter consolation.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nSpring 2024 Simulcast List [Update 6/10]\n\nIn this thread, you'll find a comprehensive list of television anime acquired for simulcast release during the Spring 2024 season.
