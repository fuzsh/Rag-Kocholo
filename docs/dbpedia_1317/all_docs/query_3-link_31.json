        "text": "Tonight on “The Amazing Race,” having experienced the U-turn in India, relationships are tested as teams take on their first self-drive leg in Germany. Also, teams rappel down a castle wall and use their taste buds to identify different mustards. This episode titled “Like Two Cats Fighting in a Car” airs Wednesday, November 8 (9:30-11:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS. Phil Keoghan hosts.\n\nCBS promised “the biggest season yet,” with 13 teams competing for the first time ever. We also see the return of commercial travel, no non-elimination legs, the express pass and a twist on the infamous U-Turn! Here are the teams still in contention: Malaina & Andrea (best friends), Steve & Anna Leigh (father/daughter), Morgan & Lena (sisters), Ashlie & Todd (married), Robbin & Chelsea (childhood friends), Greg & John (brothers), Rob & Corey (father/son) and Joel & Garrett (best friends). See the full cast in the gallery above. Follow our live blog recap of tonight’s episode below.\n\nSEE ‘The Amazing Race’s’ Liam and Yeremi on rickshaw nightmares and their estrangement before the race [WATCH]\n\n9:30 p.m. — Previously, on “The Amazing Race”! In episode 6, for the first time in history, the votes for a mandatory U-turn were in and Steve & Anna Leigh had to complete both detours in India, bundling up flowers and transporting building materials on rickshaws in the bustling streets of Jaipur. Following the Roadblock and Detour, brothers Greg & John leaped into first place while Liam & Yeremi were sent home after a few slow rickshaw rides. Let’s continue the race!\n\n9:35 p.m. — As the winners of the last leg of the race, Greg & John will head out first. Teams are flying over 4,000 miles from Jaipur, India to Frankfurt, Germany. When they get to the travel agent they realize there’s only one flight so their lead has just been squashed. It’s a even playing field. Ashlie & Todd are excited to head to Germany because they actually lived there for a while as Todd played professional basketball overseas. Robbin has also lived in Germany, so will this give her and Chelsea a leg up as well? They’re currently in last place, so they’re hoping so.\n\n9:45 p.m. — The teams have arrived in Frankfurt and race through the airport to the parking lot. They’ll be driving themselves on this leg, heading to a ferry that will take them upriver to the Burg Rheinstein, a 14th century castle where they’ll complete the Roadblock. It sounds easy enough, but multiple teams are having navigation issues and it’s causing friction. Finding their way and leading the pack are Ashlie & Todd, Joel & Garrett, Morgan & Lena and Steve & Anna Leigh. They get on the first ferry.\n\n10:00 p.m. — The next ferry holds Greg & John and Rob & Corey. They had some trouble finding their way, but there are still teams doing much worse. Robbin & Chelsea and Andrea & Malaina are completely lost. The first teams get to the Roadblock where one player must figure out how much “debt” they owe, pay the debt collector and then escape by rappelling down the castle walls. Morgan figures out the math first and leaves the other teams behind. After rappelling down the wall, Morgan joins her sister Lena and they open their next clue in first place. They must drive to the Gurzenich Koln to find their next clue. Meanwhile, Robbin & Chelsea arrive in seventh place and Chelsea has no time or energy to figure out this math. Wisely, she just keeps trying every number of coins until she guesses correctly. Way back in last place are Andrea & Malaina, who haven’t even found the ferry yet.\n\n10:05 p.m. — Andrea & Malaina have reached the ferry. The man who collects their coins says he hasn’t seen any other teams, so they hilariously think they’re in first place. They’re dead last…by a lot. Meanwhile, Robbin & Chelsea have caught up to Greg & John and decide to just follow them, hoping they know where they’re going. Meanwhile, teams in front have reached Cologne, but they’re completely lost. It’s difficult to navigate these streets and teams are growing frustrated. Steve & Anna Leigh and Morgan & Lena definitely fight the most. Despite leaving the castle behind, Greg & John had the best navigation skills and reach the clue box first. Since Robbin & Chelsea followed them, they’ve leaped from seventh to second place. For their next task, teams must participate in “Cologne’s Carnival,” riding a “horsecyle” and throwing roses to the crowd.\n\n10:15 p.m. — After enjoying their carnival experience Robbin & Chelsea and Greg & John hold their lead and will make their way by foot to the Hohenzollerbrucke to find their next clue. Meanwhile, other teams are finally beginning to figure out where to park and Ashlie & Todd arrive in third place, followed closely by Rob & Corey. Way at the back of the pack, Andrea & Malaina still haven’t found the castle. They approach strangers who tell them it’s 25km away. I don’t see how these two can ever catch up at this point. Up in front, Greg & John are first to reach the Roadblock. In “Who’s Feeling Locked In?” teams must find a marked “love lock” on the bridge and figure out the combination, which happens to be the number of Cologne’s favorite cologne, 4711. This bridge is HUGE and there are a lot of locks. Robbin and Greg get to work after asking strangers to Google Germany’s oldest cologne. They know the combo they need, now they just need to find a lock!\n\n10:30 p.m. — Greg found his lock first so he and John are officially in first place. They open their Detour clue. In “Just for Kicks,” teams have four shots to score 66 points on a soccer dart board. In “Matter of Taste,” teams must sample and identify nine different mustards by their German name. Greg & John decide to taste the mustard. Meanwhile, as Robbin continues searching for her lock on the bridge, Ashlie & Todd catch up to her. Robbin finally finds her lock and races past Ashlie. Ashlie tries to ask for help, but Robbin basically refuses. I would have to, I’m not sure why Ashlie’s offended. It’s a race! Meanwhile, Morgan & Lena and Joel & Garrett have finally figured out where the parking ramp is, so they’ll head to the carnival. They’re in a panic, fully unaware that Andrea & Malaina are just now reaching the castle everyone else was at a long time ago. To make matters worse, the best friends don’t even have the right coins to complete this task. They drive back to the ferry and the man working says he has no other coins, just Euros. It’s now evident that the reason he didn’t see another team earlier is because he’s not the right man and that wasn’t the right ferry. Yikes!\n\n10:45 p.m. — Leading the pack, Greg & John are tasting mustard alongside Robbin & Chelsea. Meanwhile, Ashlie & Todd take the other Detour, quickly realizing their soccer skills are’t up to par. They switch Detours and head to the mustard station. Rob & Corey see Ashlie & Todd struggle, but give soccer darts a go anyways. Greg & John have successfully tasted and identified nine mustards and receive their next clue. They’ll race to the next Pit Stop at Das Schokoladenmuseum, a chocolate museum. The last team to arrive will be eliminated. Meanwhile, Andrea & Malaina have finally reached the correct ferry. They’re so far behind that it seems like other teams have just forgotten about them. Joel & Garrett are certain they are actually the duo in last place.\n\n11:00 p.m. — Greg & John are the first team to reach Phil at the Pit Stop. As the winners of this leg of the race, they have won $4,000 each. Close behind them are Robbin & Chelsea. See below for the full order of results. While other teams are stressed about what place they’re in, nobody can imagine how far behind Andrea & Malaina are. One at a time, teams reach the Pit Stop. Joel & Garret, assuming they’re eliminated, have fun eating mustard and snacking on sausage. They casually jet off to the Pit Stop where they’re absolutely flabbergasted to find out they’re in seventh place. Meanwhile, Andrea & Malaina reach the carnival, but the party is over. Instead, Phil is standing there amidst the beaten down party decorations to tell them everyone else has finished and Andrea & Malaina have been eliminated from the race.\n\nLeg 7 results:\n\n1. Greg & John\n\n2. Robbin & Chelsea\n\n3. Ashlie & Todd\n\n4. Rob & Corey\n\n5. Steve & Anna Leigh\n\n6. Morgan & Lena\n\n7. Joel & Garrett\n\n8. Andrea & Malaina (eliminated)"
