        "text": "Kaiju No. 8 Episode 7 release date and time\n\nThe next episode is slated to be released Saturday, May 25, at 11 pm JST. However, the majority of international audiences will see a daytime release the same day. You can check out the exact schedule according to your time zone below.\n\nWhere to watch Kaiju No. 8 Episode 7?\n\nGiven its hype, the already popular anime series based on Shonen manga is available for streaming across various platformsâ€”Prime Video, Disney Plus, Netflix, and Crunchyroll. However, it is subject to regional availability. Kaiju No. 8 Episode 5 will first begin airing in Japan on local TV networks. The best platform for international audiences to stream the episodes online is Crunchyroll. The latest episode will be added to the website after a short delay.\n\nWhat to expect from Kaiju No. 8 Episode 7?\n\nIn the previous episode, fans saw Reno and Iharu potentially running into grave terror as they encountered Kaiju. With the episode ending in a cliffhanger, Episode 7 is likely to pick up right after and reveal their fate. As the series is set in its early stages, there is no solid tell-tale yet as to who or what will establish a fight with the threat. Speculative theories, however, suggest that someone in the Defense Force may grow suspicious of Kafka."
