        "text": "I’ve been in a constant limbo with American Horror Story: Delicate. One week, there’s an episode that makes me feel as though this season is aimless in it’s storyline, the lack of gore and horror is disappointing and, moreover, there’s no character arc. Then, they rope me right back in, like this week’s episode. Shall we get into it?\n\nEpisode seven, titled Ave Hestia, reinforced Anna’s (Emma Roberts) long lived hysteria. This episode was a switch up from this season’s usual as Anna or Siobhan (Kim Kardashian) weren’t in it, but we got a much needed backstory on Dex’s family and his previous wife Adeline. We learn that Adeline is a part of the Satanic “family,” a witch family, so to speak. This witchy girl gang includes all of this season’s usual suspects, Ivy (Cara Delevingne), Nicolette (Michaela Jaé Rodriguez), Sonia (Annabelle Dexter-Jones), and Talia (Juliana Canfield). This leads me to believe Siobhan was more recently inducted into the Witch's Hall of Fame. What was more interesting to me, and added a bit of intrigue to the story, is that Adeline is Sonia’s twin sister — and Adeline wanted out of the witch circle. I can’t blame her, it doesn’t seem like your average, supportive sisterhood and the snacks at their hangouts didn’t look too appetizing, if you catch my drift.\n\nIt’s important to note that this episode is the episode of flashbacks. When we flashback to 2013, we see a married Adeline and Dex (Matt Czuchry) and get more insight as to who they were as a couple. I wish Anna could join us in viewing these flashbacks, as her concerns of their relationship would be put to rest. In other words, their marriage sucked just as much as Anna and Dex’s. We do see that Adeline owns a restaurant and, as she’s closing up shop one night, she sees her sister Sonia, who she clearly has a strained and complicated relationship with. It seemed as though they were trying to mask the dialogue itself with the music, the creepy knife game, and the slow talk. You’re not completely out of the woods, AHS!\n\nSonia is there to essentially tell her the witches are not happy she tried to flee and they will do everything in their power to stop her from living a happy, free life. Throughout the episode, Adeline isn’t the only one experiencing the wrath from this cult. We get a glimpse of Dex’s parents relationship, which is in fact abusive and Satanic and a rather disgusting look into what his father does in his free time. I don’t want to give away too much, because if I had to experience the scene without any warning, you guys have to too. All in all, this episode gave us back all of the elements we’ve been longing for from the AHS world. If I took away anything from this episode, it’s that I am not feeling too great about Anna’s future with her baby and Dex… and Dex’s family needs some serious counseling.\n\nI don’t want to divulge too much of what happens at the end, but I’ll hint that Adeline did not perish from a car accident — in fact, it was quite the opposite. I was clutching my imaginary pearls at this episode’s brutal ending. AHS: Delicate has redeemed itself for now!\n\nIf you missed the insanity that is the Ave Hestia episode, AHS is streaming on Hulu."
