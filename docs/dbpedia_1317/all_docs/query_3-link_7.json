However, the number does not appear to match any of the characters. On closer inspection, the current numbers are the same except for the first two numbers that change.\n\nAt a quick glance, they appear to be dates... is that what they are? The day on which the episode occurs\n\nwhich would imply the story probably takes place in October of the year 2045?\n\nWhat is the significance of the numbers used for episode names?"
