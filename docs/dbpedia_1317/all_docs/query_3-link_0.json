It is the seventeenth episode overall.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nIt's a rainy day for a picnic, but when lucky number Seven appears, everything comes up rainbows.\n\nPlot[]\n\nOne, Two, Three, Four, Five and Six are at a picnic. One has an apple, Two has two bottles of orange juice, Three has three bananas, Four has four green containers, Five has five cupcakes with light blue frosting and Six has six indigo cups.\n\nUnfortunately, it starts to rain. Everyone covers their heads with their arms, But the picnic blanket slides away. Five asks if anyone's got an umbrella. One just happens to have one and brings it out. She attempts to share the umbrella with the Numberblocks by hopping onto them.\n\nOne jumps onto Two, then Three, then Four. Just before she lands on Five, she drops her umbrella, jumps over Five, and lands on Six. Six gasps as...\n\nSeven starts out with entirely violet blocks. Seven wonders if he's in heaven, to which Five responds that he's in Numberland. Seven thinks that's lucky. Suddenly, a rainbow appears and The Numberblocks are in awe. Seven's blocks turn multicoloured, surprising the Numberblocks. Seven wonders what happened, then sees a mirror. He counts the 7 rainbow-colored blocks and learns that he's all the colours of the rainbow; then the mirror creates another Seven.\n\nNumberblocks 1-6 meet Seven. Seven feels lucky to meet them, and he thinks he's the luckiest Numberblock in the world. He sings a song about being lucky. After the song, they continue the picnic. Seven has seven cupcakes with rainbow icing, and the Numberblocks all laugh.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nOne\n\nTwo\n\nThree\n\nFour\n\nFive\n\nSix\n\nSeven (debut)\n\nLyrics[]\n\nI'm lucky number Seven! I'm in a happy place...\n\nThe sun is always shining and there's always a smile upon my face!\n\nI see a penny and I pick it up, And all day long I have good luck.\n\nI'm lucky number Seven, And everything is falling into place...\n\nI'm lucky number Seven! And as you might have guessed...\n\nI always win the raffle!\n\nWith Seven on your side, You're Seven blessed!\n\nIn a pickle? You're in luck, I'll help you out when you get stuck.\n\nAnd if you stick with Seven, Everything will work out for the best.\n\nYay!\n\nRainbow time!\n\nRed!\n\nmy first block is the same as you.\n\nOrange!\n\nMy second block is the same as Two!\n\nYellow!\n\nMy third block is just like number Three.\n\nGreen!\n\nMy fourth is green, As you can see!\n\nBlue for Five. Indigo for Six. Violet is for Seven... Oh, That's Me!\n\nI've got seven rainbow-coloured blocks, That makes me unique.\n\nI've got seven pairs of pants and socks, One for each day of the week.\n\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.\n\nI've got seven golden tickets.\n\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven.\n\nAll my ducks are in a row.\n\nOne Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven.\n\nNothing's going to stop me, All my traffic lights are on go!\n\nI'm lucky number Seven, I'd like to chance my arm. In tricky situations, There's really no reason for alarm.\n\nI take problems in my stride, I've got fortune on my side. I'm lucky number Seven, We know with me I'll be your lucky charm.\n\nMath Magic[]\n\n6 + 1 = 7 (segment only)\n\n7 - 1 = 6 (segment only)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSong: I'm Lucky Number Seven\n\nWhen Seven first appears, all his blocks are violet.\n\nSeven is the biggest numberblock in this episode only.\n\nThis is the only time Seven is arranged horizontally in Ten out of Ten.\n\nThe instrumental version of the song can be heard in Seven's games in the game Numberblocks Make & Play.\n\nThe following objects in the game are from this episode:\n\nSeven's vocals.\n\nThe ducks.\n\n\"I see a penny and I pick it up, And all day long I have good luck.\" is a reference to the saying \"See a penny, pick it up, and all the day you'll have good luck.\" Through cameos, it is also the first appearance of coins.\n\nSeven absorbing a rainbow may be foreshadowing of his scene in Ten Again, where he blasts one and is later revealed to have made several.\n\nErrors[]"
