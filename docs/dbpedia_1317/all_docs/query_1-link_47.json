        "text": "Hanna-Barbera’s Casper and the Angels originally ran Saturday mornings on NBC from September, 1979 to May, 1980. 13, 30-minute episodes were produced.\n\nThe show brought Casper the Friendly Ghost into the 22nd Century and made him the guardian spectre for two motorcycle policewomen; Minnie and Maxie. As per usual, Casper was loath to scare anyone, so his bizarre ghost buddy, Harry Scary assisted with the work of frightening the villains.\n\nI have only the vaguest memories of this show. How about you? Were you a loyal viewer? You can catch the show’s intro below. Have an unforgettable Funshine Friday!\n\n‘Casper and the Angels’ Intro, 1979\n\nCasper and the Angels Wiki, IMDb"
