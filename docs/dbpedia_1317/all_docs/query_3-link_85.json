        "text": "The political battle for the Midwest is center stage Wednesday with dueling presidential campaign events. Minnesota Now heard reports from a Harris-Walz rally, attracting thousands and a smaller JD Vance campaign event, both in Eau Claire, Wis.\n\nMPR News host Cathy Wurzer took a deeper dive into Harris’ decision to choose Walz as a running mate and how it affects the ticket.\n\nMPR chief meteorologist Paul Huttner joined the show to recap some destructive storms that have made way for a calm weather pattern for the rest of the week.\n\nOne of the most plentiful meteor showers of the year is in full swing. The show covered how and where to watch.\n\nOur summer festival spotlight took us west to the Minnesota Garlic Festival in Hutchinson to learn about the unique traditions of celebrating the plant.\n\nThe Minnesota Music Minute was ‘Paranoid’ by Hippocampus and the Song of the Day was ‘Ain’t Spring for Me’ by Tim Emmons.\n\nUse the audio player above to listen to the full conversation."
