        "text": "Spoilers through Season 2 of 'The Flash' follow.\n\nIf only every episode of The Flash and Arrow were as good as last night's 'Legends of Today.\" The two shows are embarking on a two-part crossover extravaganza, of which this was merely part one. And it was absolutely terrific.\n\nRead my review of Part Two---Legends of Yesterday---here.\n\nMeet Vandal Savage, Hawkgirl, and Hawkman\n\nWe're introduced to Vandal Savage (Casper Crump) an immortal villain determined to find Kendra Saunders (Ciara Renee) who Cisco has just started dating. You'll recall that Cisco (sometimes called Vibe) has the power to \"vibe\" anyone with special powers. He saw a vision of Kendra with wings. Turns out, she's an immortal also---of sorts. She's also Hawkgirl, in this age of super heroes and super hero names.\n\nFor four-thousand years she's been killed and reborn, and in each life she's drawn to her soul mate---Hawkman---this time, Carter Hall.\n\nSo the stage is being set for a much more epic, epoch-spanning adventure of love and death, ageless tyrants and flying...angels? (Actually, the Hawkgirl/Hawkman mythology reminds me of the Will Smith film Hancock, which deals with a similar plot in a very different way.)\n\nTeam Flash turns to Team Arrow for help against Savage, and to protect Kendra. That's when Hawkman enters the scene and swoops her away to protect her. One thing leads to another and we learn all the above lore. I feel bad for Cisco, learning that his new girlfriend is destined for another. That's a rough break, though if anyone can take it well Cisco can.\n\nAction-Packed!\n\nAll of this is great story, interspersed with some terrific fight scenes. Savage makes several appearances and each battle is a lot of fun, but especially the fight in the cathedral where Savage finds the mythical Staff of Horus---which can shoot blue laser beams!\n\nThe only fight I rolled my eyes at was when Thea shoots Savage to kill and Oliver makes a big deal out of it. Neither of these shows can settle on a philosophy of killing that makes any lick of sense. It seems many people in Team Arrow routinely shoot to kill, including Oliver. But every now and then this is a big deal and Oliver makes a big fuss over it. I don't get it. Team Flash usually doesn't kill, but started off this season by killing a handful of meta-humans without batting an eye.\n\nI wish both shows would stop treating us like we don't notice or care about this very important issue, and just figure it out once and for all. If killing is against Team Arrow's credo, then Diggle and Laurel should stop shooting people to death with guns. If it isn't against the rules, then Oliver needs to stop worrying about Thea killing. If all it takes for her or Sara to reel in their bloodlust is a bit of killing, it seems like there are plenty of bad guys to put bullets or arrows into.\n\nIn any case, that's more of an issue I'm having with both shows writ large. This episode was largely problem-free for me. It was also hilarious.\n\nBoth Shows Are At Their Best When They're Funny\n\nWhen Merlyn/R'as al Ghul shows up for the second time out of the shadows in Oliver's hideout, Cisco blurts out \"Is that the only way he knows how to enter?\"\n\nWhen Oliver and Barry are handily beat by Savage, Barry says \"That's a tie, right?\"\n\nFelicity goes on a long rant about Oliver not trusting her ideas, the entire time not realizing she's on an open line where everyone (currently fighting Ghosts) can hear.\n\nLots of these great, funny lines and moments throughout. It's times like these that make both these shows so charming, that really underscore how great so many of these characters are.\n\nSpeed Serum\n\nThe secondary story-line takes place back in Central City, far from the Vandal Savage fight. In it, we are reminded once again of the importance of trust and communication.\n\nDr. Snow and Dr. Wells are working on making a speed serum to boost Barry's speed. They try to get Flash 2/Jay Garrick to take it, but he's having none of it for reasons of principle I can't quite understand. I'll be honest, Garrick is sort of annoying me at this point. He refuses to help, won't even bother to provide a second voice to counter Wells because he dislikes him so much, and huffs and puffs a lot without actually contributing. Come on Jay, you can do better.\n\nIn any case, Patty Spivot---still in the dark about Barry, Wells, etc.---spots Wells outside Star Labs and follows him inside, thinking he must be the bad guy he was from last season. When she mistakes a lab gun for the real thing, she shoots him on the spot. Because even though she's Joe's partner and Barry's girlfriend, they'd rather just keep her totally in the dark.\n\nAnd I understand the need to keep people in the dark until you can trust them, but I'm not sure why they all still feel they can't trust Patty. Even if they don't reveal Barry's identity just yet, they should probably clue her in a bit more on the broad strokes stuff. And while Barry certainly can't reveal his secret to every girl he goes out with, at some point---when things get serious---he probably should.\n\nSo Wells is shot, Joe sends Patty away, and Jay comes back and takes the speed serum so he can perform Flash-Surgery on the doctor and save his life. All is set right, but Garrick angrily insists on keeping the serum away from Barry. That might be a good idea, but Flash Two doesn't stick around long enough to argue his case or explain to his colleagues (or us viewers) why it's such a horrible idea. After all, as Wells argues, science is what's given all the meta-humans their power. For all we know, science is what's given all the mystical angels and demons, from Hawkgirl to Damien Dhark, their power, too. Just a science we can't comprehend.\n\nAnd finally we get the very last scene, where Oliver sees his old girlfriend in Central City's one and only relevant cafe. And not just his old girlfriend, but the one who got pregnant and then was paid a million bucks by Oliver's mom to pretend that she'd lost the child. There's a look on his face like he guesses that this young boy she's with is his son. Will he find out the truth tonight? Next week? This season? I hope so, though how this will change things for Green Arrow remains to be seen.\n\nAll told, a fantastic episode of The Flash. I can't wait to watch part two tonight on Arrow. What did you think of the first part of the crossover? Are you looking forward to Legends of Tomorrow?\n\n(All Photo Credits: The CW.)"
