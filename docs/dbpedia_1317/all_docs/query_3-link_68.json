        "text": "Targaryens are in the midst of a civil war and dragons finding their riders. House of the Dragon season two premiered on June 16, 2024 and HBO stretched out the season all summer. Let’s take a look at all the episode titles this season gave us.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nSpoilers ahead for all episodes of ‘House of the Dragon’ seasons one and two.\n\nEpisode 1: ‘A Son for a Son’\n\nThe premiere episode of season two is titled “A Son for a Son” and for good reason. For those of us who watched the finale of House of the Dragon season one, we saw the death of Lucerys Valeryon via his uncle Aemond Targaryen when Vhagar brutally crunched Arrax in half and (presumably) had Luke as a snack. It’s easy to see why Luke’s mother Rhaenyra Targaryen wants vengeance or why this episode is titled as it is. Honestly given the fan feedback, I think it should have been called “Blood and Cheese.”\n\nEpisode 2: ‘Rhaenyra the Cruel’\n\nWhen HOTD season two episode two aired, it was almost immediately clear why the episode is titled “Rhaenyra the Cruel”. As King Aegon’s council tries to face the grievous events at the end of episode two in which Jaehaerys Targaryen is beheaded, Otto Hightower suggests that the council use the event to cast political rancor on Rhaenyra. Not only is this accepted, but a public display of grief is architected and a horrid spectacle even our Queen Rhaenyra herself would never approve of takes place.\n\nEpisode 3: ‘The Burning Mill’\n\nAt the end of June 2024 we got “The Burning Mill”, the third episode in this second season of HOTD. The story opens with a Bracken versus Blackwood feud coming to a head on a disputed territory line in the Riverlands. If you’ve been following season two as closely as we have, we all know the Riverlands are a critical location for a queen to secure Westeros. So when the locals erupt into battle and death and burning mills down, the conflict between the greens and the blacks continued to heat up.\n\nEpisode 4: ‘The Red Dragon and the Gold’\n\nWe all had to experience this devastating and wild episode together as the war between the dragons begins in full force. Meleys, the red dragon that is bonded with Princess Rhaenys, goes to war and it’s a bloody exchange. In the heat of the of the moment, Aegon mounts his gold dragon Sunfyre and goes to join Ser Criston Cole and Dwayne Hightower on the battlefield at Rook’s Rest. Aegon, Sunfyre and Vhagar, whom Aemond Targaryen rides, team up against Meleys and Rhaenys. Both the Princess and her brave dragon engage with their fiercest courage, which is heartbreaking at the end of the episode. But isn’t breaking viewers’ hearts a classic Game of Thrones universe move?\n\nEpisode 5: ‘Regent’\n\nAfter the injuries and deaths at the Battle of Rook’s Rest in episode four of this season, the realm and all our favorite characters are reeling with grief and shock. We got to see dragons really fight and it was tough to see the sky puppies in battle. The real question is, how will the greens recover with Aegon injured and abed, since their entire strategy relied on his claim to the throne. Who will be the regent while Aegon is ill? You’ll have to watch the episode to find out.\n\nEpisode 6: ‘Smallfolk’\n\nIt’s not the first time the smallfolk have been used and abused by the Targaryen civil war, but the role of the everyday people in this episode is different. From the low-born Lady Mysaria on Dragonstone to our good girl Elinda doing the Queen’s work in King’s Landing, we see how important it is to win over the people. And it’s especially important for our Queen Rhaenyra to be able to do so, given how many of the smallfolk are about the be dragon riders.\n\nEpisode 7: ‘The Red Sowing’\n\nIt’s par for course in the Game of Thrones universe that the episode prior to the season finale is filled with fire and blood. “The Red Sowing” isn’t any different, as we get to meet Vermithor and see why he’s called the Bronze Fury. We also get to meet Silverwing and of course see the two new riders claim our beloved new dragons. And if you’ve watched this episode you’re probably saying, “Naejot mazis, Vermitos! Vermitos, lykiri!” to your pets all day now. Soon they’ll know High Valyrian.\n\nEpisode 8: ‘The Queen Who Ever Was”\n\nPhew. This was a tough episode to watch and I am not alone in thinking so. The incremental pace of House of the Dragon season two has had the audience wondering why writer Ryan Condal and the rest of the showrunners are choosing to stretch out the story. Despite one or two cool moments in this season’s last episode, it was less of a finale and more of a tribute to Bilbo Baggins from Lord of the Rings: Both Bilbo and the show feel stretched out like butter over too much bread. No battles, no real resolutions, and a few teasers for season three."
