Turner Origin and Meaning

The name Turner is a boy's name of English origin meaning "works with a lathe".

Turner is a name that's both preppy and painterly, recalling the exquisite watercolor seascapes of British painter J.M.W. Turner. An occupational name in the Taylor-Carter mold, Turner is a more distinctive choice than many of the usual suspects.

One first-name Turner namesake is Turner Catledge, the first Executive Editor of the New York Times, but for the most part its more notable bearers were surnamed Turner: Nat, the leader of a rebellion of enslaved people and subject of a William Styron novel; media mogul Ted; musicians Ike and Tina; and glamour girl Lana. In the movie Turner & Hooch, Tom Hanks was Det. Scott Turner and Hooch was the dog.
