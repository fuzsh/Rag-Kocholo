        "text": "Tina Turner facts: Real name, husband, children, songs and movies of the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll\n\nFrom Little Ann to the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll, Tina Turner is one of the greatest solo stars of all time.\n\nFew singers made their mark in the 20th century like Tina Turner.\n\nFrom her earliest days as Little Ann in Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm, through her time fronting the Ike & Tina Turner Revue and her years as a solo superstar, she stomped through the decades like a wrecking ball of talent and charisma.\n\nQUIZ: How much do you know about Tina Turner?\n\nTina Turner and Carole King inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nListen to the Gold 60s Live Playlist on Global Player\n\nIn 2021, she was finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist.\n\nThe same year, we also got the wonderful Tina documentary telling her life story.\n\nTragically, we said goodbye to the legendary artist, after she passed away aged 83 on May 24, 2023.\n\nWhere did Tina Turner grow up and what was her real name?\n\nTina Turner was born on November 26, 1939 to sharecropper dad Floyd Richard Bullock and mum Zelma Priscilla Currie in Brownsville, Tennessee, and grew up in the rural community of Nutbush.\n\nShe was apparently born Anna Mae Bullock, though Tina did also sign her contracts in the late 1970s as Martha Nell Bullock, leading to a bit of mystery about what her actual birth name is.\n\nHer parents moved to Knoxville to work at a defence facility during WWII, and Tina was separated from her sister Ruby and half-sister Evelyn.\n\nTina went to live with her dad's parents Alex and Roxanna, who were deacon and deaconess at the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nThe family was reunited after the war, all living together in Knoxville, then back to Nutbush, and Tina went to Flagg Grove Elementary School.\n\nHer mum left the family when Tina was 11, and her dad remarried two years later, sending Tina and her sisters off to live with her mum's mum Georgeanna Currie in Brownsville, where she attended Carver High School, and then eventually graduated from Sumner High School.\n\nHow did Tina Turner get into music?\n\nTina was a singer from a young age, singing in Nutbush's Spring Hill Baptist Church choir.\n\nShe was a high school cheerleader and basketball player, and juggled her school and social life with domestic work, before going on to work s a nurse's aide at Barnes-Jewish Hospital after graduation.\n\nIt was during her visit to the nightclubs of St Louis that Tina saw Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm at the Manhattan Club, and asked if she could sing with him.\n\nHe never got back to her, so she took matters into her own hand, grabbing the mic during an intermission in 1957 and singing BB King's 'You Know I Love You'.\n\nNaturally impressed, Ike got her to sing for the rest of the night and signed her up as his group's featured vocalist.\n\nThe following year she released her first single as the singer on Ike Turner's 'Boxtop', being credited as 'Little Ann'.\n\nHow did Tina Turner get the name Tina Turner?\n\nLet's get one thing straight. Ike Turner didn't invent Tina Turner. Tina Turner invented Tina Turner. It was her drive, her passion, her talent that made her a superstar.\n\nBut it was Ike who came up with the name.\n\nIke had written 'A Fool in Love' for Art Lassiter to sing with Little Ann on backing vocals. Art failed to show, and the young woman then known as Anna Mae Bullock stepped up to the mic.\n\nIke planned to zap her vocals and replace them with Art's later down the line, but St Louis DJ urged Ike to send the tape as was to Sue Records president Juggy Murray, who loved Anna's vocals and urged Ike to present her as the star she was clearly destined to be.\n\nInspired by comic Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, Ike renamed her Tina (rhymes with Sheena), added the proprietorial surname Turner, and even went as far as trademarking the name \"Tina Turner\", thinking he could always replace Anna Mae with another Tina Turner if she quit. As if.\n\n'A Fool in Love' went to number 2 in the R&B chart and 27 on the Billboard Hot 100, and Tina Turner was born.\n\nIn the wake of the single's success, Ike formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which was fronted by Tina, backed by the Kings of Rhythm and girl group The Ikettes, with Ike as bandleader.\n\nWhat were Ike & Tina Turner's biggest hits?\n\nBefore their disintegration in 1976, Ike & Tina Turner had an incredible amount of success both as live performers and recording artists. Their biggest hits included:\n\nA Fool in Love\n\nIt's Gonna Work Out Fine\n\nTra La La La La\n\nTell Her I'm Not Home\n\nRiver Deep â€“ Mountain High\n\nI'm Gonna Do All I Can (To Do Right by My Man)\n\nThe Hunter\n\nBold Soul Sister\n\nProud Mary\n\nOoh Poo Pah Doo\n\nNutbush City Limits\n\nWhen did Ike & Tina Turner get married and when did they split up?\n\nIke and Tina Turner got married in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1962, though it later emerged that at that time Ike was still legally married to Alice Bell, meaning that his marriage to Tina was arguably never valid.\n\nNevertheless, they were still common-law partners at the very least, until their relationship disintegrated in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe pair had a violent exchange on the way to the Dallas Statler Hilton on July 1, 1976 and Tina filed for divorce later that month, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalised on March 29, 1978.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Ike kept publishing royalties for both of their songs, though Tina kept her songwriting royalties and most importantly her stage name.\n\nIn her first autobiography in 1986 I, Tina: My Life Story, Tina revealed that Ike had physically abused her before and during their marriage.\n\nIke himself later admitted that he \"slapped\" Tina and \"punched her to the ground without thinking\", but incredibly claimed he \"never beat her\".\n\nWhat are Tina Turner's biggest solo hits?\n\nWhile she was successful with her then-husband Ike, it was only when she went solo that Tina Turner became a world-beating superstar. Some of her biggest hits were:\n\nWhat's Love Got to Do with It\n\nBetter Be Good to Me\n\nPrivate Dancer\n\nWe Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\n\nTypical Male\n\nWhat You Get Is What You See\n\nThe Best\n\nI Don't Wanna Fight\n\nGoldenEye\n\nOpen Arms\n\nWho has Tina Turner collaborated with?\n\nAs well as her personal and professional relationship with Ike Turner, Tina has also clocked up some significant collaborations with other top stars.\n\nShe and David Bowie recorded a cover of Iggy Pop's 'Tonight' (originally written by Iggy with Bowie), which was released as a single in 1984 and was the title track of Bowie's album of the same name.\n\nA year later she recorded 'It's Only Love' with Bryan Adams, and in 1987 she released 'Tearing Us Apart' with Eric Clapton. And she hooked up with Rod Stewart in 1990 for 'It Takes Two'.\n\nWhat films has Tina Turner starred in?\n\nAs well as popping up as herself in various early rock 'n' roll documentaries, Tina Turner also had a movie career with a few quirky but significant roles.\n\nShe played the Acid Queen in Ken Russell's 1975 adaptation of The Who's Tommy, before appearing in the ensemble of the Peter Frampton and Bee Gees-led 1978 flop Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie.\n\nTina had more success as Aunt Entity in the post-apocalyptic sequel Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in 1986, before appearing as the Major in the post-modern cult classic Arnie movie Last Action Hero in 1993.\n\nWho was Tina Turner married to, and how many children did she have?\n\nWhile its legal status is disputed because of Ike's previous marriage, Ike and Tina Turner wed in Tijuana, Mexico in 1962.\n\nShe gave birth to two sons. The first, Craig Raymond Turner, was from a relationship with Kings of Rhythm saxophone player Raymond Hill. Craig tragically died by suicide in 2018 at the age of 59.\n\nTina had her second son, Ronald 'Ronnie' Renelle Turner, with Ike in 1960. She also adopted two of Ike's sons from his previous relationships, Ike Jr and Michael Turner.\n\nIke and Tina Turner split in 1976 and their divorce was finalised two years later.\n\nWhen Tina went to DÃ¼sseldorf Airport in 1986, she met German music executive Erwin Bach, and the pair started a friendship which blossomed into a romantic relationship.\n\nAfter 27 years together, they decided to get married on the banks of Lake Zurich in KÃ¼snacht, Switzerland in July 2013.\n\nAnd in April 2017 after Tina Turner suffered kidney failure, Erwin gave her one hell of a gift â€“ one of his own kidneys that she had transplanted to save her life.\n\nWhen did Tina Turner give up her American citizenship?\n\nAs well as owning property around the world, Tina Turner has been living in the ChÃ¢teau Algonquin lake house in KÃ¼snacht, Switzerland since 1994.\n\nShe applied for Swiss citizenship in 2013, formally becoming a citizen on April 22, 2013, and giving up her US citizenship on October 24, 2013.\n\nSo if you're asked what Tina Turner's nationality was in a pub quiz, you'll know the answer is surprisingly \"Swiss\".\n\nWhat awards did Tina Turner win?\n\nThere simply isn't the space to list every single award Tina Turner won during her incredible career, but as well as all the MTV, AMA, Grammy, Billboard, Rolling Stone, Smash Hits and other music prizes, here are some of the very biggest highlights."
