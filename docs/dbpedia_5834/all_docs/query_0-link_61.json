        "text": "Tina Turner suffered more than most in her 83 years.\n\nThe Best songstress battled cancer, a stroke and kidney failure at the height of her career as well as living with a form of PTSD which stemmed from the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of her first husband, Ike Turner.\n\nBut her heartache didn’t stop there as Tina tragically lost a second child just months before her own death.\n\nThe tragic death of her son Ronnie, who was found dead outside his home in Los Angeles, was the latest in a string of horrific life events the singer suffered through.\n\nHer 62-year-old son who passed away in December after 'having a hard time breathing' and was 'found unresponsive by neighbours'.\n\nNo initial cause of death was revealed, but the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office later issued their findings.\n\nRonnie reportedly suffered 'complications from colon cancer', as well as 'atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease'.\n\nThe disease is a build-up of cholesterol plaque in the walls of arteries causing obstruction of blood flow, as reported by Page Six.\n\nSharing an emotional black and white portrait picture following his death, Tina appeared with her eyes firmly shut as she paid tribute to her \"beloved\" child.\n\n\"Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son,\" she penned alongside the picture.\n\nIt was the latest heartbreak for Tina in recent years. In 2018, the singer lost her other son Craig, after he died by suicide.\n\nAs she scattered his ashes of the coast of California back in 2018, she wrote: \"My saddest moment as a mother.\n\n\"On Thursday, July 19 2018, I said my final goodbye to my son, Craig Raymond Turner, when I gathered with family and friends to scatter his ashes off the coast of California.\n\n\"He was fifty-nine when he died so tragically, but he will always be my baby,\" she tweeted.\n\nTina gave birth to Craig when she was 18 years old – before her marriage to Ike Turner. After they wed, Ike adopted her son with Craig taking his surname.\n\nBut Craig's biological father was Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill, who was a member of Ike's band.\n\nRaymond and Tina – then known as Little Ann – were in a relationship in 1957 when she was just 17 and a new backing singer for Ike Turner’s band. Raymond died in 1996 from heart failure aged 62. Tina was married to Ike between 1962 and 1978.\n\n*If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.
