        "text": "Artist Information\n\nLeah Turner is the living version of a country song with a passion all its own. Her father, Don Turner, was a true-blue world champion rodeo star. In earlier days as a Coca Cola distributor, Don delivered a shipment to a deli where he first caught eyes with first generation Mexican American Susaña Galvan - a jewelry designer, artist and ballet dancer. From this American love story came a fiery Leah Turner, who first sat down to a piano at 3 years old and has since felt called to blend her Latin roots with the country music she creates - it was inevitable that all roads would eventually lead to Nashville. First discovered by GRAMMY Award-winning artist Kenny Loggins, who told her to pack up her stuff and move to L.A., Turner has partnered with multiple GRAMMY Award-winning producers Humberto Gatica and David Foster, and has toured or shared the stage with country stars Brad Paisley, Kenny Chesney, Jake Owen, Rascal Flatts, Cole Swindell, and more. Her debut single “Take the Keys,” released in 2013, quickly climbed to a Top 40 spot on the Billboard Country chart and accrued over 3 million streams on Spotify alone. An accomplished songwriter, Turner has had cuts with Cody Purvis (“Drinkin’ Terms” - Top 50 on the Billboard Country chart), Kristy Lamb (“Bad Habit” - No. 1 in Australia), and Academy Award-nominated actor Jeremy Renner (“Never Sorry” and “My Type” from his 2020 EP, The Medicine). With the release of her upcoming EP Lost in Translation (due out October 15), Turner is truly embracing her heritage - as witnessed in the project’s first single, “Once Upon a Time in Mexico.” “Country music has always had a love affair with the Hispanic culture,” says Turner. “I’m just the product of a good old-fashioned country song.”"
