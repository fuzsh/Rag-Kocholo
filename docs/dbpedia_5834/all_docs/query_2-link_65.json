        "text": "Baby names are an important cultural tradition across the world, and have been for thousands of years. Different cultures have a variety of ways to choose given names, so it’s only fitting that the nomenclature of a surname, or last name, is just as complex.\n\nFrom Smith to Sullivan, Sanders to Myers, and Reyes to Roberts, read on for the most popular family names found across the United States!\n\nThe History of Last Names\n\nSurnames, also known as family names, were first used during medieval times and usually referred to a person's occupation (i.e. Turner, Miller, Tailor, Potter, Weaver, Baker). These are called occupational names.\n\nSurnames could also come from places — a hint that a name comes from a place might be the endings -field, -ford, -brook, or -wood, for example. The original locative name of “Henry of the Marsh” might be shortened over the years to Henry Marsh.\n\nThe trend of naming people after the places that they come from goes beyond the English language, as many German, Dutch Norwegian, and Swedish last names end in -berg (which means mountain in those languages).\n\nPatronymics & Surnames\n\nA lot of these same principles apply in other languages, particularly when discussing the system of patronymic naming.\n\nThis was another common surname convention, which originated from a father's first name, and then \"son\" was added, as in Stevenson, Davidson, Robertson, or Richardson.\n\nAnd the same patronymic system carried over into foreign languages, as well. For example, those of Spanish descent have an interesting way to denote familial lines through the last name alone. In fact, the suffix \"-ez\" in Spanish names is a patronymic addition, akin to \"son\". In that tradition, Martínez then would be the descendant of Martín.\n\nBy the same principle, Iceland has patronymic and matronymic systems that include both “son” and “daughter” suffixes that help people identify familial lines, which have existed for centuries. For people using this system, Icelandic surnames are not solely predicated on family names, but on the first name of the father or mother of the child.\n\nAs such, you will find many Icelandic surnames ending in -son or -dóttir, translating respectively to “son of” or “daughter of”, connecting to the genitive form of the father or mother’s name preceding it. Some examples of this naming convention include a Viking settler of Vinland in North America, named Gudrid Thorbjarnardóttir; author of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”, Stieg Larsson; and the first female prime minister of Iceland in 2009, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir.\n\nWhere Do the Most Popular Last Names in America Come From?\n\nThe United States has long been a melting pot for various cultures from across the globe. As such, it should come as no surprise that the U.S. statistics for last names are influenced greatly by the number and ethnicity of the immigrants who have joined the ranks of Americans. From Scottish settlers to Portuguese migrants, America is full of diversity — including in terms of names.\n\nEthnicity, Immigration, and Surnames\n\nSome of the most influential ethnicities that have changed the fabric of American family names include Spanish, Portuguese, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, and English settlers who arrived on North American shores and brought their familial nomenclature with them.\n\nBecause these settlers were some of the first Europeans to arrive in the New World and would go on to populate much of the vast, unsettled country, their names have stuck around for centuries. Such surnames include Roberts, Lewis, Phillips, Edwards, Evans, Cooper, Hughes, Rogers, Bailey, Scott, and more.\n\nIn other places across the country — particularly in the southwest — Hispanic or Latino populations arrived with a completely different tradition of family names. These can include Chavez, Diaz, Ruiz, Cruz, Gutierrez, Mendoza, Jimenez, and many others.\n\nAnd across the west coast and Hawaii, you might find last names of Asian descent, including Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, or Japanese. Names rising in popularity over the past few decades include Nguyen, Lee, Zhang, Wong, and Kim.\n\nAmerican History and Last Names\n\nHistory is another factor in determining surnames. For example, during the period before the American Civil War when slave-owning was legal, many indentured people were forced to take on the names of those who purchased them, such as “Roberts”, “Jacobs”, or even last names that denoted skin color (like “White”, “Black”, or “Brown”).\n\nSimilarly, when the Native American populations were forced into residential schools or reservations, many had their identity stripped away by the state and the government. Indigenous peoples were made to take on “white” or Catholic names instead of the traditional ones they had carried for centuries.\n\nBut these ripple effects through history and immigration status have led to the country we have today and the last names that you, your friends and family, and your acquaintances are known by.\n\nWhat Is the Most Common Last Name in the U.S.?\n\nSo, depending on the history and the ethnic makeup of a particular state or county, the popularity of certain surnames will vary wildly. And it also depends on which year you take a look at!\n\nFor example, in the United States, Smith was the most popular surname in 1990 and retained that spot ten years later. Garcia jumped in popularity from the 18th-most-popular name in 1990 to the sixth-most-popular last name in 2010. Robinson was the 20th most popular name in 1990 but fell off the list, as Latino surnames become more common.\n\nBut now that we have briefly explored the origins of names, let’s take a look at 50 of the most popular and common last names in the United States.\n\nSURNAME RANK FREQUENCY (COUNT) PROPORTION PER 100,000 POPULATION SMITH 1 2,442,977 828.2 JOHNSON 2 1,932,812 655.2 WILLIAMS 3 1,625,252 551.0 BROWN 4 1,437,026 487.2 JONES 5 1,425,470 483.2 GARCIA 6 1,166,120 395.3 MILLER 7 1,161,437 393.7 DAVIS 8 1,116,357 378.5 RODRIGUEZ 9 1,094,924 371.2 MARTINEZ 10 1,060,159 359.4 HERNANDEZ 11 1,043,281 353.7 LOPEZ 12 874,523 296.5 GONZALEZ 13 841,025 285.1 WILSON 14 801,882 271.8 ANDERSON 15 784,404 265.9 THOMAS 16 756,142 256.3 TAYLOR 17 751,209 254.7 MOORE 18 724,374 245.6 JACKSON 19 708,099 240.1 MARTIN 20 702,625 238.2 LEE 21 693,023 234.9 PEREZ 22 681,645 231.1 THOMPSON 23 664,644 225.3 WHITE 24 660,491 223.9 HARRIS 25 624,252 211.6 SANCHEZ 26 612,752 207.7 CLARK 27 562,679 190.8 RAMIREZ 28 557,423 189.0 LEWIS 29 531,781 180.3 ROBINSON 30 529,821 179.6 WALKER 31 523,129 177.3 YOUNG 32 484,447 164.2 ALLEN 33 482,607 163.6 KING 34 465,422 157.8 WRIGHT 35 458,980 155.6 SCOTT 36 439,530 149.0 TORRES 37 437,813 148.4 NGUYEN 38 437,645 148.4 HILL 39 434,827 147.4 FLORES 40 433,969 147.1 GREEN 41 430,182 145.8 ADAMS 42 427,865 145.1 NELSON 43 424,958 144.1 BAKER 44 419,586 142.2 HALL 45 407,076 138.0 RIVERA 46 391,114 132.6 CAMPBELL 47 386,157 130.9 MITCHELL 48 384,486 130.3 CARTER 49 376,966 127.8 ROBERTS 50 376,774 127.7\n\nSource: Census Bureau, 2010 U.S. Census (latest update in U.S. Census Bureau Frequently Occurring Surnames).\n\nSumming Up Surnames\n\nDid you find your last name on any of these lists?
