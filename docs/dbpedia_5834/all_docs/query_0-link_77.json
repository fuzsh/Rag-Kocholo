        "text": "Music legend Tina Turner has died at the age of 83, with tributes pouring in from across the globe.\n\nThe Queen of Rock 'n' Roll has passed away at her home near Zurich in Switzerland following a long illness. A statement released this evening said she died 'peacefully', stating that the world had lost \"a music legend and a role model\".\n\nA private funeral is to be held for the performer born Anna Mae Bullock, who belted out hits including Simply the Best, What's Love Got to Do With It? and Proud Mary. Her funeral will be attended by family and close friends, the Mirror reports.\n\nREAD MORE: These Cheshire hospitals announce face mask rule changes\n\nA statement issued confirms she died \"peacefully\" at home and adds: \"With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model.\"\n\nTina was born on November 26 in 1939 in Nutbush, Tennessee, USA.She found fame in the late 1960s as the singer of the band Ike & Turner Revue but later went on to find fame as a solo artist.\n\nShe sold more than 180 million albums and won 12 Grammy Awards.\n\nShe sold out stadiums on tour around the world for over three decades as one of the hardest working women in show business.\n\nThe natural-born performer joked earlier this year that she is as famous for her legs as her voice.\n\nJust last year, Tina shared her sorrow with fans after the tragic death of her son Ronnie.\n\nSharing an emotional black and white portrait picture, Tina appeared with her eyes firmly shut as she paid tribute to her \"beloved\" child who was found dead outside his home in Los Angeles.\n\n\"Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son,\" she penned alongside the picture.\n\nIt was the latest heartbreak for Tina in recent years. In 2018, the singer lost her eldest son Craig, after he died by suicide.\n\nAs she scattered his ashes of the coast of California back in 2018, she wrote: \"My saddest moment as a mother.\n\n\"On Thursday, July 19 2018, I said my final goodbye to my son, Craig Raymond Turner, when I gathered with family and friends to scatter his ashes off the coast of California,\" she tweeted.\n\n\"He was fifty-nine when he died so tragically, but he will always be my baby.\"\n\nTina gave birth to Craig when she was 18 years old - before her marriage to Ike Turner. After they wed, Ike adopted her son with Craig taking his surname.\n\nBut Craig's biological father is Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill, who was a member of Ike's band.\n\nRaymond and Tina - then known as Little Ann - were in a relationship in 1957 when she was just 17 and a new backing singer for Ike Tuner’s band. Raymond died in 1996 from heart failure aged 62. Tina was married to Ike between 1962 and 1978.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Sign up for CheshireLive email direct to your inbox here\n\nREAD NEXT:"
