        "text": "Three decades before the #MeToo movement inspired an avalanche of men and women to publicly share their abuse stories, there was Tina Turner.\n\nIn 1981, Tina was trying to establish herself as a solo artist when she revealed the truth of her abusive marriage to Ike Turner. It was a difficult decision to speak publicly about the brutality she faced at the hands of her ex-husband, manager, and band partner at a time when abuse was not openly discussed. But it was also necessary for Tina’s career.\n\nHer 1978 divorce had left her broke, in debt for canceled Ike & Tina tour dates, and with sons to support. The public, at the time, did not understand why one of the most iconic music partnerships of the ’60s and ’70s had suddenly dissolved, and record companies were hesitant to sign her solo. So Tina set the record straight.\n\n“I wanted to stop people from thinking that Ike & Tina was so positive, that we were such a great team,” Tina tells Oscar-winning filmmakers Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin in the new HBO documentary Tina, which premieres March 27. “So I thought, if nothing else, at least people know.”\n\nIn the years after breaking that bombshell in People magazine, Tina shared more details of her marriage to Ike and the path that made her vulnerable to it—how she was born Annie Mae Bullock into an abusive house before being abandoned by her parents as a child. How Ike discovered her as a teenager, rechristened her Tina, and micromanaged every aspect of her career with the Ike & Tina duo—even withholding her finances. How he beat her with a shoe stretcher while she was pregnant and burned her with scalding coffee. How cocaine made Ike’s mood swings worse, and he took her to a brothel in Tijuana, Mexico, on the night of their wedding. The pain of Tina’s marriage to Ike has been revisited in the 1986 memoir I: Tina, the 1993 biographical film What’s Love Got to Do With It, and the 2018 Tina Turner Musical.\n\nBut the neat pop-culture narrative around Tina’s survival—that Tina left Ike and immediately triumphed in her solo career and survival—is not accurate. When Lindsay and Martin began working on the documentary, they learned that Tina opened up about the abuse during a forgotten period of her career when she was struggling to win over a record company on her own, and had resorted to Hollywood Squares appearances, Vegas ballrooms, and sad cabaret acts just to make ends meet.\n\n“We didn’t realize how long she was in Vegas during what we call the ‘Tina in the wilderness’ period—the cabaret days where she was really trying to carve out her new identity as a solo act,” said Martin.\n\n“That was a real revelation to us, because we immediately looked at the date of the People interview and we’re like, 1981?” said Lindsay. “Tina’s not a real public figure at that point…. That piqued our curiosity…. In diving into it, we realized that the motivation on Tina’s side was that she was having trouble getting the record industry to disassociate her from Ike. So she thought this would be an opportunity to tell the truth of her relationship with Ike as a means to kind of separate from him. The irony, obviously, being that that decision, in some ways, cemented her identity with Ike in a way that she was never able to really detach from.”\n\nLindsay and Martin’s documentary alternates stunning performance footage of Tina—singing and shaking in beads onstage—with vulnerable behind-the-scenes admissions. When the filmmakers met Tina in Geneva, they were interested in the icon’s relationship with this chapter of her history, her public persona, and the misleading lore of her survival story.\n\nSaid Lindsay, “The trauma [of abuse] doesn’t just go away—that’s something we wanted to communicate with this film…. In meeting Tina early on, we kind of became aware of the complicated relationship she has to her own story…. What is clear in talking to her is that she is making an active choice every day to continue to survive.”\n\nAware of how triggering it could be for Tina to revisit the Ike days, the filmmakers relied on audio from previous interviews to cover that period—interweaving the actual 1981 interview from People with other recollections Tina shared with journalist Kurt Loder.\n\n“We were able to use that stuff to really dive into the details of that time in her life without us needing current-day Tina to have to really tell us in kind of detail that time of her life,” said Lindsay. “Revisiting that time can be very traumatic for her. And it oftentimes comes up in dreams or nightmares, and it’s like she’s reliving that stuff for the first time again…. We were very aware that that is something that she is still dealing with.”\n\n“I think that was kind of a discovery for us, too, and a kind of shifting of our point of view—a lot of society holds up Tina as this symbol of resilience and strength and, ‘Oh, she got away from Ike and then went on and had this life,’” added Lindsay. “And a lot of the tellings of her story tend to end with her getting a number one single with ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It,’ as if everything is solved as a result of that.”\n\nAsked how much they considered the #MeToo narrative in Tina’s story, Martin said that the movement Tina predated was not really a factor.\n\n“Regardless of the era we’re in, it took her, and continues to take a lot of courage for her to kind of wake up and make the decisions to continue to survive,” said Martin. “This idea that her trauma is something that she’s actively continuing to process and she has to make a decision about every day for the betterment of her mental and emotional well-being…is something I find really admirable. And I find timeless from a storytelling standpoint.”\n\nWhere to Watch Tina:\n\nAll products featured on Vanity Fair are independently selected by our editors.
