        "text": "Tina Turner, the queen of rock’n’roll responsible for hits such as “What’s Love Got to Do with It”, has died aged 83.\n\nIn a statement shared on Wednesday (24 May), a representative for the “Proud Mary” singer announced that Turner had died at her home in Kusnacht near Zurich, Switzerland.\n\n“Tina Turner, the ‘Queen of rock’n’roll’ has died peacefully today at the age of 83 after a long illness in her home in Kusnacht near Zurich, Switzerland,” their statement read.\n\n“With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model... With her music and her inexhaustible vitality, Tina Turner thrilled millions of fans and inspired many artists of subsequent generations.”\n\nFollow The Independent’s live blog for updates.\n\nIn recent years, Turner had suffered from ill health, having been diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and having a kidney transplant in 2017. A private funeral ceremony will be attended by close friends and family, who have asked for privacy.\n\nBorn Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tennessee (her hometown would inspire her 1973 song “Nutbush City Limits”) in 1939, Turner had a successful career spanning over 60 years.\n\nThroughout her lengthy career, she earned eight Grammy Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time.\n\nDeveloping a love of singing performing in church choirs as a child, Turner’s career began when she met singer Ike Turner on the St Louis nightclub circuit in 1957. After convincing Ike to let her sing with him, she became a featured vocalist in his band.\n\nAround this time, Turner adopted the nickname “Tina”, with Ike adding his own surname so that he could replace her, should she leave. In 1960, Turner released her first single, “A Fool For Love”, to critical acclaim and medium chart success, and Ike formed the Ike and Tina Turner Revue.\n\nThe pair married in 1962 and released music together – and with Tina as a solo performer – in the mid-Sixties. However, everything changed when she began working with Phil Spector, producing the hit “River Deep, Mountain High” for his label. With a hit record under their belt, Ike and Tina supported the Rolling Stones on tour and gained celebrity fans in David Bowie, Cher and Elvis Presley.\n\nThe duo continued a successful streak throughout the Seventies. However, they split in 1976, with Tina later revealing that he had been violent and abusive, and had also cheated on her. In her 1986 book, she narrated a harrowing tale of abuse, including suffering a broken nose during the course of her marriage to Ike.\n\nWhen Ike died in December 2007, Tina’s spokeswoman was quoted as saying: “Tina is aware that Ike passed away earlier today. She has not had any contact with him in 35 years. No further comment will be made.”\n\nFollowing the split, which was finalised in 1978 and left Turner with just two cars and the rights to her stage name, she returned to releasing music as a solo performer.\n\nEven at the height of her career, however, Turner was performing for women in her audience, not to appear sexy to men.\n\nLooking back in a 2018 interview, she said: “We were a sisterhood: me, my dancers, and our audience, out there having a good time together... At my shows, I wanted wives, husbands, grandparents, children, friends, everyone, to have fun. And here’s something I always understood. If you appeal to the women in the audience, the men will follow.”\n\nHer famous track list over the years include “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)”, “What’s Love Got to Do With It”, “Private Dancer”, and “Let’s Stay Together”. Turner also performed the James Bond theme track for 1995’s GoldenEye, with a title track co-written by U2’s Bono and The Edge.\n\nOther notable duets throughout her career included performances with David Bowie and the Rolling Stones, the latter of whom she famously took to the stage with for the Live Aid Festival in Philadelphia in 1985.\n\nDuring the performance, Jagger famously decided to rip off Turner’s skirt on stage. In an interview last month, Turner admitted that she’d “always had a crush” on the Rolline Stones frontman.\n\nTurner’s 1986 autobiography, I, Tina, was adapted for the screen in 1993 as the biopic What’s Love Got To Do With It. Angela Bassett received an Oscar nomination for her performance as Turner.\n\nHowever, vocal powerhouse Turner also dabbled in acting herself, appearing alongside Mel Gibson in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in 1985, and Last Action Hero in 1993.\n\nSince 1994, Turner has lived in Switzerland with her long-time partner, German music executive Erwin Bach. The pair married in a civil ceremony in 2013.\n\nIn her second autobiography, 2018’s Tina Turner: My Love Story, she revealed that Bach saved her life by donating one of his kidneys.\n\nShe praised her husband in a rare interview in 2022, saying of their marriage: “It has enabled me to accept my mistakes and imperfections, to appreciate both the difficult times and the good times and the hurts of the past to let go. Accepting yourself as you are is true freedom.”\n\nTurner had four children. The oldest, Raymond Craig, she had with Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill. Turner gave birth to son Ronnie with Ike, and adopted two of his children from a previous relationship as his own.\n\nIn 2018, Craig died from apparent suicide aged 59. Then, in December last year, Ronnie died after being diagnosed with colon cancer. Discussing Ronnie’s death, Turner said that her son had “left the world far too early”.\n\nThe same year as Craig’s death, an Olivier-nominated musical based on his mother’s life, titled Tina – The Tina Turner Musical, opened on London’s West End in 2018.\n\nIn 2005, President George W Bush famously described Turner’s legs as “the most famous in showbusiness”, with reports suggesting she insured them for hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIn 2021, Turner sold the rights to her back catalogue after reaching an agreement with BMG for an undisclosed sum. In the deal, she signed over her share of her recordings, her music publishing writer’s share and her name, image and likeness.\n\nTurner’s solo works include 10 studio albums, two live albums, two soundtracks and five compilations, which together have sold more than 100 million records."
