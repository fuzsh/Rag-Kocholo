        "text": "Known as of the “greatest comebacks in rock and roll history,” Tina Tuner was the oldest female solo artist to get a number one song at age 44 and won 12 Grammy awards over the course of her career.\n\nWhile many know some of her popular tunes, not everyone is familiar with the story of her rise to fame. Born to Tennessee sharecroppers in 1939 as Anna Mae Bullock, her mother fled an abusive relationship with her father when Bullock was just 11 years old. Bullock moved between family members before returning to live with her mother in high school.\n\nShe met her future husband, Ike Turner, at a nightclub in St. Louis, when she was 17 years old. He was performing, and she eventually joined the act. Seeing promise in her voice, Ike Turner began to mentor her. After some time, she sold a single as the lead singer. She took on the name Tina as her success grew, and Ike Turner added his last name: Tina Tuner was born.\n\nShe catapulted into stardom. She sometimes performed as a solo artist and also as a duo. Ike and Tina Tuner married in 1962, toured for several years and appeared on many major television shows. By 1971, their version of “Proud Mary” topped the Billboard charts at No. 4. Their success continued for several more years.\n\nDespite their fame, there was trouble in their marriage. Ike Turner was violent, and Tina experienced ongoing physical and emotional abuse. He became erratic and addicted to drugs. In 1976, a fight between them led to Tina Turner fleeing in the night. She hid at a nearby hotel with only 36 cents and a Mobil gas credit card to her name. She divorced Ike Turner in 1978, taking only her name and two cars. For two years after their relationship ended, she played small clubs while she worked to pay off debts.\n\nAs time passed, she began to launch her solo career. She continued TV appearances and grew in popularity. She finally reached a No 1 hit with “What’s Love Got to Do with It” and won three Grammys. She again went on tour and began acting. In 1993, a semi-autobiographical film was made based on her life. The film earned two Oscar nominations.\n\nTurner continued to make music, explore acting, win awards and even write a few books into 2021. However, she had been ill for many years. On May 24, 2023, she passed away in Switzerland. Artists from around the world paid tribute."
