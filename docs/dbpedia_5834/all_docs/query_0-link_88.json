        "text": "Tina Turner has died at the age of 83 as tributes pour in for the legendary singer.\n\nThe iconic hitmaker died after suffering with a long illness at her home near Zurich in the heart of Switzerland.\n\nShe was diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and had a kidney transplant a year later.\n\nA statement announcing her death read: \"With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Foo Fighters announce new drummer in video teaser after Taylor Hawkins' tragic death\n\nHer official Instagram later announced: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Tina Turner.\n\n\"With her music and her boundless passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around the world and inspired the stars of tomorrow.\n\n\"Today we say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us all her greatest work: her music. All our heartfelt compassion goes out to her family. Tina, we will miss you dearly.\"\n\nIt is understood a private ceremony will be held for her close family and friends.\n\nWhat is your favourite Tina Turner song? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.\n\nThe Queen of Rock 'n' Roll was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939 in Nutbush, Tennessee, USA.\n\nShe found fame in the late 1960s when she became the lead singer of the band Ike & Turner Revue before she went on flourish as a solo artist.\n\nSome of her impressive hits include What's Love Got To Do With It, Private Dancer and The Best.\n\nThroughout her career she has sold more than 180million albums and won an impressive total of 12 Grammy Awards.\n\nShe sold out stadiums on tours around the world for over three decades as one of the hardest working women in showbusiness.\n\nThe iconic performer joked earlier this year that she is just as famous for her elegant legs as she is for her show-stopping voice.\n\nShe reportedly once insured her legs for a whopping £2million. The hitmaker explained that she only had her legs on show because it made it easier to dance which ultimately became part of her iconic style.\n\nTina previously said: \"When I was younger, I never felt confident about any part of my body, but with all the attention my legs received, I realised they must be OK!\"\n\nTurner retired from performing back in 2009 following her 50th anniversary tour, during which she performed 37 sold-out shows across North America, raking in almost $50 million (£40.3million).\n\nThe tour then took over Europe where she performed an additional 47 live dates - in total the singer was seen by more than one million concert-goers.\n\nJust last year, Tina shared her sorrow with fans following the death of her son Ronnie, who died at the age of 62 last December.\n\nSharing an emotional black and white snap, Tina appeared with her eyes shut as she paid tribute to her \"beloved\" child who was found dead outside his Los Angeles home.\n\nAt the time TMZ reported that he died after \"having a hard time breathing\" when he was reportedly found unresponsive by neighbours who attempted to revive him with no success.\n\nShe captioned the post: \"Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son.\"\n\nIt was the latest heartbreak for the chart-topper in recent years, after she lost her eldest son Craig in 2018 after he died by suicide.\n\nAfter scattering his ashes off the coast of California, she took to Instagram to share her heartache with her loyal legion of fans online.\n\nShe wrote: \"My saddest moment as a mother. On Thursday, Jul 19, 2018, I said my final goodbye to my son, Craig Raymond Turner, when I gathered with family and friends to scatter his ashes off the coast of California.\n\n\"He was fifty-nine when he died so tragically, but he will always be my baby.\"\n\nTina gave birth to Craig when she was just 18 years old, before she tied the knot to Ike Turner.\n\nAfter the couple tied the knot, Ike adopted her son and gave Craig his surname.\n\nFollowing the news, her famous friends and loyal fans have flooded to social media to pay tribute to the late icon.\n\nNaomi Campbell commented on her official message, writing: \"REST in Peace & Power THE QUEEN, LEGEND, ICON. There will never be another. Cherish my times with you.\"\n\nFormer basketball player Magic Johnson tweeted: \"Rest in peace to one of my favourite artists of all time, the legendary queen of rock 'n' roll Tina Turner.\n\n\"I've seen her many, many times and hands down, she gave one of the best live shows I've ever seen. She always gave you your money's worth.\"\n\nAlexandra Burke posted: \"RIP to the one and only Tina. There will never be anyone like you. Truly the greatest\" as Judi Love added: \"Omggg this is heartbreaking. Rest Well queen.\"\n\nPaddy McGuinness chimed in with: \"What a shock. Another great leaving us. When icons pass away it really resonates. RIP Tina Turner.\"\n\nStar Trek legend George Takei echoed: \"A true legend has passed. Tina Turner has died at the age of 83. She was our River Deep and out Mountain High, the Private Dancer in out hearts.\n\n\"She showed us that love really does have everything to do with it, and that we really did need another hero. And she was it. Rest now...\"\n\nFor more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters here.\n\nBut Craig's biological father is Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill, who was a member of Ike's band.\n\nRaymond and Tina - who was then known as Little Ann - were in a relationship in 1957 when she was just 17 and a backing singer for Ike Turner's band.\n\nRaymond died in 1996 from heart failure at the age of 62. Tina later married Ike in 1962 before they parted ways in 1978.\n\nBut the relationship turned abusive with the star eventually leaving him and went on to establish her successful solo career.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
