        "text": "Last names, also known as surnames, can tell us a lot about our family history and cultural identity. Our surnames can help us trace our family trees, but they can also tell us about the history of how people traveled across the world, built their communities, and contributed to society.\n\nIt turns out that there’s actually a lot to know about last names...including why some last names are more popular than others. (There’s more to it than you might think!) We’ll go over:\n\nThe history of how last names came to be\n\nWhy some last names are more common than others\n\nThe most common last names in the U.S.\n\nThe most common names in the world\n\nThere’s a lot to cover, so let’s get started!\n\nLast names are often passed down through family lines. But that's not the case for all cultures! Read on to learn more about the history of surnames.\n\nA Brief History of Last Names\n\nFirst of all, what is a last name? That’s not as simple a question as it might seem on the surface. Not all countries have a tradition of even using surnames, and most of those who do--looking at you, Europe--only adopted them in the late Middle Ages or afterwards.\n\nThe tradition of how a surname is assigned, and how it is passed from generation to generation, is complex. Not only does it vary between cultures, how we get our surnames has also shifted over time because of social changes.\n\nFor instance, in Anglophone (English-speaking) cultures, it is traditional for a woman to change her birth surname (the so-called “maiden name”) to her husband’s last name once she marries. This tradition decreased somewhat after the suffragette and feminist movements, and continues to decline significantly.\n\nIn contrast, the Minangkabau people from West Sumatra don't have familial last names at all. Instead, they have clan names which pass matrilineally. In other words, clan names are passed down to children from their mothers, not their fathers.\n\nAlso keep in mind that in many cultures and countries, surnames also are a relatively recent phenomenon. For example, the usage of last names as part of your legal identification in European culture only dates back to about the 15th century. Some places have adopted surnames even more recently. Turkey, for instance, only adopted the usage of surnames in 1934--by legal mandate!\n\nCultures that use last names usually use them to help identify a person’s ancestry, current community, or other culturally identifying characteristic. According to linguists and anthropologists, last names tend to fall broadly into about five categories:\n\nPatronymics (names that signify who your father was or ancestors were)\n\nOccupations (names that signify what job your ancestor had at one time)\n\nToponymics (names that signify where your ancestors once lived)\n\nNames that signify personal characteristics, such as appearance or personality traits\n\nNames that denote what clan, tribe, or patronage you or your ancestors belong to\n\nA surname can also be a combination of these categories (for instance Smith refers to the occupation of blacksmithing, the patronymic lineage of being descended from blacksmiths, and notion of being from the working class).\n\nIt’s also important to know that for some people, their last names point to a legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Subjugated peoples typically had the surname tradition of their conquerors imposed upon them. African slaves, for instance, came to the Americas without surnames and were often given the surnames of their owners. These last names may be part of a person’s lineage or identity today.\n\nWhy Are Certain Last Names Common?\n\nIt all comes down to imperialism and colonialism, in which some countries took over other people’s countries and lands in the name of their own government.\n\nIf you look at all the most common surname in the world, you’ll see that almost all of them are Anglophone (English-speaking), Hispanophone (Spanish-Speaking), Arabic (due to the spread of the religion of Islam) or Sinitic (from the many languages spoken in China). If you compare that to the history of imperialism and imperialist expansion, you’ll see that the most aggressive colonizers of other lands were the English, Spanish, Chinese, and Muslims.\n\nColonialism involves replacing a colonized territory’s culture with that of the colonizers. In many cases, that meant imposing the colonizer’s system of naming people on native and indigenous peoples living in their colonies. And sometimes, that meant literally changing people’s legal names to be more in line with the colonizer’s culture. And the more territory a country colonized, the more likely it was for their last names to spread--and become more common.\n\nSo when we look at the most common surnames in the world, we see a snapshot of world history in miniature! We see which people travelled, where they travelled to, and how they assimilated with--or subjugated--the people they met there.\n\nThe most common last name in the U.S. is \"Smith.\" If that's your surname, then you're a member of a pretty large group.\n\nWhat Is the Most Common Last Name in the U.S?\n\nYou’re probably wondering, “How common is my last name?” If so, check out the chart below of the 55 most common surnames in the U.S. We’ve also included the name’s place of origin and its general meaning.\n\nAlso, note that some of these names have multiple origins, such as the Anglophone name “Martin,” which appears here conflated with the Latin “Martín” and the French “Martin.” Likewise the Anglophone name “Lee” is conflated with the Korean “Lee” and the Chinese “Lee” or “Li.”\n\nName\n\nPlace of Origin\n\nMeaning\n\nSmith\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Blacksmith)\n\nJohnson\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of John)\n\nWilliams\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of William)\n\nBrown\n\nBritish Isles\n\nCharacteristic (Person with brown hair or dark complexion)\n\nJones\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of John)\n\nGarcía\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Gerald)\n\nMiller\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Mill-worker)\n\nDavis\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of David)\n\nRodríguez\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Rodrigo)\n\nMartínez\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Martin)\n\nHernández\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Hernan)\n\nLópez\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Lope)\n\nGonzález\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Gonzalo)\n\nWilson\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Will)\n\nAnderson\n\nBritish Isles, Nordic Countries\n\nPatronymic (Son of Andrew)\n\nThomas\n\nBritish Isles\n\nBiblical (St. Thomas the Apostle)\n\nTaylor\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Tailor)\n\nMoore\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPerson from the marshlands\n\nJackson\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Jack)\n\nMartin\n\nBritish Isles, Iberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Martin)\n\nLee\n\nKorea, China, British Isles\n\nClan name (Korea), Royal Dynasty (China), Person from the meadowlands (British Isles)\n\nPérez\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Pedro)\n\nThompson\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Thomas)\n\nWhite\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPerson with a fair complexion\n\nHarris\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Harry)\n\nSánchez\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Sancho)\n\nClark\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Secretary, clerk)\n\nRamírez\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPatronymic (Son of Ramiro)\n\nLewis\n\nBritish Isles\n\nfrom Latin Ludovicus, winner of an athletic game\n\nRobinson\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Robin/Robert)\n\nWalker\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Cloth-maker)\n\nYoung\n\nBritish Isles\n\n“The Younger,” (akin to Junior)\n\nAllen\n\nBritish Isles\n\nDisputed. Maybe “Little Rock (IE from an area associated with a small hill). Maybe “fair” or “handsome.”\n\nKing\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Ancestor was a courtier to the king or local leader, or was a leader himself)\n\nWright\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Builder)\n\nScott\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPerson from Scotland\n\nTorres\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPerson who lives in a tower\n\nNguyen\n\nVietnam\n\nMusical instrument\n\nHill\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPerson from the hill country\n\nFlores\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nFlowers\n\nGreen\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPerson who lived in the town square (village green)\n\nAdams\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Adam)\n\nNelson\n\nBritish Isles, Nordic Countries\n\nPatronymic (Son of Neil)\n\nBaker\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Baker)\n\nHall\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPerson who worked in the manor house (great hall)\n\nRivera\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPerson who lived on the riverbank\n\nCampbell\n\nBritish Isles\n\n“Crooked Mouth” (IE someone who spoke wryly or bravely)\n\nMitchell\n\nBritish Isles\n\nBiblical (St. Michael)\n\nCarter\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Transporter of goods)\n\nRoberts\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Robert)\n\nGómez\n\nIberian Peninsula\n\nPerson with Visigothic or Germanic ancestors (from the Old English word “Gome,” meaning “man.”)\n\nPhillips\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of Phillip)\n\nEvans\n\nBritish Isles\n\nPatronymic (Son of John, from the Welsh “Ifan”)\n\nTurner\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Lathe-worker, woodcarver)\n\nParker\n\nBritish Isles\n\nOccupation (Game-keeper, maintainer of parks)\n\nSo as of 2020, Smith is still the most common surname name in the U.S. (It has held this distinction since 1850).\n\nYou’ll probably notice that most of the common last names in the U.S. are Anglophone--i.e. British in origin--and they mostly preserve the 15th/16th-century tradition of occupational or patronymic names. That’s not super surprising because the U.S. is a former British colony! As colonizers, the British brought, and spread, their surnames and naming conventions throughout the US...and those names and systems are still in use today.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit: Hispanophone names are rising on the list of most common last names in the U.S. as immigration from Hispanic countries increases. Six of the top 20 names on this list of the 55 most common last names in the U.S. have Hispanic origins. That number was zero as recently as 1990!\n\nWhat Is The Most Common Last Name in the World?\n\nAs of 2018, the most common last name in the world is “Wang,” which means “prince.” About 92.8 million people in China have this name...which is roughly 15 percent of China’s population!\n\nAfter the Qin Dynasty fell in 206 BCE, many families adopted the last name “Wang.” This helped families disguise their true identities to avoid being assassinated by the new rulers of China...and it also helped make Wang the most common surname in the world!\n\nMost Common Surnames in the World\n\nNow that you know what the most common surname in the world is, let’s take a closer look at some other common last names around the world.\n\nWe’ve broken these into charts based on continent: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania. From there, we’ve listed the countries where that surname is most prevalent along with the surname’s meaning.\n\nAfrica’s Most Common Last Names\n\nAfrican surnames reflect a history of colonialism. For instance, you’ll see European surnames along the western coast, Arabic surnames in the north, and indigenous names in the less-accessible interior. The influence of Islam is notable, as all of Africa’s most common last names are Islamic in origin.\n\nName\n\nMost Common Countries\n\nMeaning\n\nMohamed/Mahamat\n\nChad, Comoros, Egypt\n\nIslamic Prophet\n\nAli\n\nLibya, Eritrea, Somalia\n\nIslamic Caliph\n\nAhmed\n\nEgypt, Nigeria, Sudan\n\nAnother name of Mohamed\n\nIbrahim\n\nEgypt, Nigeria, Sudan\n\nBiblical/Islamic Figure (Abraham)\n\nHassan\n\nEgypt, Nigeria, Sudan\n\nIslamic Caliph\n\nAsia’s Most Common Last Names\n\nThis list of the five most common last names in Asia shows the immense population of its biggest country. In fact, this list of the 5 most popular surnames in Asia is also a list of the five most common last names in the entire world.\n\nDevi and Singh, the most common surnames in India, are at numbers 6 and 9, respectively. The most common Japanese last names, Sato and Suzuki, are all the way down at numbers 195 and 202.\n\nName\n\nMost Common Countries\n\nMeaning\n\nWang\n\nChina, Taiwan, Thailand\n\nPrince\n\nLi\n\nChina, Taiwan, Hong Kong\n\nRoyal Dynasty\n\nZhang\n\nChina, Taiwan, Thailand\n\nClan name (descendants of Emperor Huang Di)\n\nChen\n\nChina, Taiwan, Singapore\n\nRoyal Dynasty\n\nLiu\n\nChina, Taiwan, Hong Kong\n\nClan name (descendants of Emperor Yao)\n\nEurope’s Most Common Last Names\n\nThis list of Europe’s most common last names will likely look familiar to you. Most of these names feature on the most common last names in U.S. lists, too.\n\nName\n\nMost Common Countries\n\nMeaning\n\nGarcía\n\nSpain\n\nPatronymic (Son of Gerald)\n\nMartin\n\nSpain, France, England\n\nPatronymic (Son of Martin)\n\nMüller\n\nGermany, Switzerland, Austria\n\nOccupation (miller)\n\nRodríguez\n\nSpain, Argentina\n\nPatronymic (Son of Rodrigo)\n\nFernández\n\nSpain, Argentina\n\nPatronymic (Son of Fernando)\n\nNorth America’s Most Common Last Names\n\nIf you are located in the United States, it might surprise you that there are no Anglophone names in the list of 5 most common last names in North America. Smith, the most common name in every Anglophone country in the world, is way down the list at number 9.\n\nWhy? Because North America isn’t just Canada, the United States, and Mexico--it also includes all the nations and dependent territories of the Caribbean and Central America (which is a geographic region rather than a continent), the majority of which were colonized by Spain.\n\nName\n\nMost Common Countries\n\nMeaning\n\nHernández\n\nMexico, US, Guatemala\n\nPatronymic (Son of Hernan)\n\nGarcía\n\nMexico, US, Guatemala\n\nPatronymic (Son of Gerald)\n\nMartínez\n\nMexico, US, Cuba\n\nPatronymic (Son of Martin)\n\nLópez\n\nMexico, Guatemala, US\n\nPatronymic (Son of Lope)\n\nGonzález\n\nMexico, US, Cuba\n\nPatronymic (Son of Gonzalo)\n\nSouth America’s Most Common Last Names\n\nPerhaps you are expecting to see these same Hispanophone names that are common in North America in South America, too? Nope. The most populous region of South America, Brazil, was colonized by the Portuguese. In fact, of the 430,000,000+ people in South America, almost half--about 213,000,000--live in Brazil.\n\nThis has resulted in almost all the most common last names in South America being Portuguese in origin. The most common Hispanic name in South America is Rodrigues, which is the 7th most common last name in South America.\n\nName\n\nMost Common Countries\n\nMeaning\n\nda Silva\n\nBrazil, Argentina\n\nPerson from the woodlands\n\ndos Santos\n\nBrazil, Argentina\n\nAll Saints\n\nPereira\n\nBrazil, Paraguay\n\nPerson who lives near a pear orchard\n\nFerreira\n\nBrazil, Paraguay\n\nOccupation (Blacksmith, iron-worker)\n\nAlves\n\nBrazil, Argentina\n\nPatronymic (Son of Alvaro)\n\nOceania’s Most Common Last Names\n\nOceania is the name for all the islands in the Pacific Ocean between Asia and North America. While it is one of the most ethnically diverse of all continents (839 languages are spoken in Papua New Guinea alone), it is also the least populous continent apart from Antarctica.\n\nOf the 43,000,000 people living in the region, about 30,000,000 of them are in Australia and New Zealand, and most of the rest of the region was also colonized by England, causing Anglophone names to be very prevalent in the list of most common last names in Oceania.\n\nThe list looks a bit different than the list of most common last names in the United States and England, however, as most of the tribal peoples had no tradition of surnames, so they developed a tradition of patronymic names based on the first names given to their ancestors. That’s why most of the most common surnames on this list are ones we would expect to be a first name rather than a last name.\n\nName\n\nMost Common Countries\n\nMeaning\n\nJohn\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nPatronymic (Descendant of John)\n\nSmith\n\nAustralia, New Zealand\n\nOccupation (Blacksmith)\n\nPeter\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nPatronymic (Descendant of Peter)\n\nThomas\n\nPapua New Guinea, Australia\n\nPatronymic (Descendant of Thomas)\n\nJames\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nPatronymic (Descendant of James)\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nAre you interested in last names because you’re a creative writer?
