        "text": "Hello there!\n\nThis is a special 'list by me and my buddy Oates. It spotlights a trailblazing woman who started as one-half of one of the most famous husband/wife duos in rock 'n' roll. After their tumultuous marriage turned to a messy (and public) divorce, this woman, who could've been washed up after her 40s, was given a second chance. Best part? A 1993 biographical film was made about her, starring Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne — and while she was still alive.\n\nShe was born Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tennessee in 1939. She sang in her choir, was active in high school athletics. In 1958, her life was changed forever when she met her future husband, Izear \"Ike\" Turner during a St. Louis nightclub performance with his band The Kings of Rhythm where she was handed a mic and told to sing into it. Turner was so impressed, he made her a backup singer until a twist of fate where a singer for a song Ike wrote called \"A Fool in Love\" didn't show for his recording session and gave the song to Bullock.\n\nIt would soon be a match made in heaven as she became the second half of The Ike & Tina Turner Revue. They were a dynamic married duo who churned out hits like \"River Deep, Mountain High\" and \"I've Been Loving You Too Long.\" In 1971, she would record the now iconic cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's hit \"Proud Mary.\" Their stage shows were energetic, raw and carnal. Bullock, of course, (at this point, taking her husband's surname and adopting the name, Tina) was the star with her long, sexy legs, her skimpy outfits, her hip-swaying moves, and her blatant in-your-face sex appeal.\n\nAs her marriage crumbled over reports of domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and mental cruelty, Tina had barely a career after the divorce, doing mostly Vegas shows and club dates. Aussie manager Roger Davies would scoop her up, make over her image and sign her to Capitol Records in 1982.\n\nHer comeback album Private Dancer was released in 1983. It didn't generate a lot of fire despite the release of her first comeback hit, a glossy, new wave cover version of the 1972 Al Green classic \"Let's Stay Together.\" Then, in the late summer of 1984, a sexy, mid-tempo ballad called \"What's Love Got to Do With It,\" a song she allegedly didn't want to record, made its steady climb up the Billboard Hot 100, reaching all the way to Number 1. She had officially, as is the repeated statement, come back.\n\nPrivate Dancer sold exceptionally well and spawned two major hits: \"Better Be Good to Me\" as well as the title track. The floodgates of success opened to include movie role offers. She was initially offered the role of Celie in the Steven Spielberg acclaimed drama The Color Purple, which she turned down. Her return to the big screen would be as a villain, Aunty Entity in the post-apocalyptic sequel-thriller Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in 1985. She embraced Buddhism and published her autobiography I, Tina with music journalist Kurt Loder which would become the basis for her autobiographical film What's Love Got to Do With It in 1993. Both stars, Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne, playing Ike and Tina Turner, would receive critical acclaim and Oscar nominations - a feat never duplicated for movies with an on-screen married couple.\n\nTurner broke through many musical barriers as she was one of but a few African-American women in rock 'n' roll who soared in all musical genres: Rock, Pop, New Wave, Hard Rock, and even Disco. She is still alive and well (thankfully) and living her golden years in Zurich, Switzerland with her husband.\n\nHere's my buddy Oates' list.\n\nCherry's Picks:\n\n5. \"Tearing Us Apart\" w/ Eric Clapton (1986)\n\nA punchy pop/rock duet between Turner and guitar god Clapton, produced by Phil Collins and a staple in many of Clapton's concerts.\n\n4. \"Typical Male\" (1986)\n\nAn out-of-the-box smash from her Break Every Rule album delineating her \"dalliance\" with her lawyer. Fun and snappy; a song that kept Turner's hit streak from drying up.\n\n3. \"We Don't Need Another Hero\" ('Thunderdome') (1985)\n\nThe title track from her Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome soundtrack is an anti-war song which makes great use of a children chorale in the end of the song. Her MTV video would even have her wearing her Aunty Entity costume from the film and having the kid choir backing her, along with snippets of the Mel Gibson action-thriller.\n\n2. \"Private Dancer\" (1985)\n\nSultry ballad written by Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler and tailor-made for Turner's sexy, leggy image. The song itself needs no real explanation. A stripper offering up a lap dance — \"a dancer for money.\"\n\n1. \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" (1984)\n\nThe alleged story was that Turner wasn't initally hot on recording this song as she felt it was too cynical, even for her. Roger Davies, her manager, convinced her otherwise and the rest — history. A classic ballad nonetheless with Turner's haunting vocals, the main hook. Earned her three Grammys in 1985.\n\nMy Picks:\n\n5. \"I Might Have Been Queen\" (1983)\n\nOne of her best records off of Private Dancer, and one I imagine based largely off of her Buddhist faith. A catchy, polished new wave/rock/pop tune dealing primarily with reincarnation.\n\n4. \"Two People\" (1987)\n\nA sweet-tempered R&B ballad that didn't have the success that \"Typical Male\" did after being released immediately after. It deserves a listen.\n\n3. \"Better Be Good to Me\" (1984)\n\nA funky rock/new wave track that showcases Turner's gorgeously mature and sexy side, both vocally and visually. Dig the leather get up in her popular MTV video. \"Hot!\" doesn't even describe it!\n\n2. \"We Don't Need Another Hero\" ('Thunderdome') (1985)\n\nA favorite of mine since its debut back in the summer of '85. I would recommend the lengthy six-minute album cut. Its children chorale hook is reminiscent of Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II.\" Gravely disappointed in the song's chart performance; should've gone all the way to Number 1. Had to settle it going to Number 2.\n\nOh, and was there any doubt?\n\n1. \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" (1984)\n\nHer signature smash hit. Her comeback single. Her only US Number 1. The spiked hair. Sexy, long legs walking through New York City in her classic video. Probably, heard over a billion times by me in over the past 30+ years. Hands down, a classic!\n\nUntil next time. Next one? It'll be a surprise!"
