        "text": "Turner History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nAustria\n\nEngland\n\nGermany\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nTurner is a name that came to England in the 11th century wave of migration that was set off by the Norman Conquest of 1066. Turner is a name for a lathe worker. The surname Turner was originally derived from the Old French verb tourneour, meaning to turn on a lathe. Such a craftsman would have fashioned basically cylindrical objects out of wood, metal, and bone. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Turner family\n\nThe surname Turner was first found in Oxfordshire in midland England but was found throughout England. \"It is well represented in the midlands, especially in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Staffordshire, and is also numerous in Lancashire.\" 2 Mark Antony Lower in his source Patronymica Britannica suggests that the name is all \"out of all proportion, to the number of persons engaged in the trade\" of the lathe. He argues that the family may have first appeared before the Conquest in a grant to the monastery of Croyland, in 1051, being signed, among others, by a Turnerus Capellanus. 3 Moreover, the family was also quite numerous in Scotland from early times.\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls list: Aylbricht le Turnur in London in 1271; Geoffrey le Turner in Cambridgeshire; and William le Tumor in Oxfordshire. The latter two listings were probably made in 1273. The Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 list Johannes Tumour, turnour. Ironically there are very few listings in the early rolls of the trade. Calendarium Rotulorum Originalium listed William le Tournour and Kirby's Quest listed Henry le Tornour in Somerset during the first year of Edward III reign. 4 1\n\nIn Scotland, \"a family of this name had possession of the estate of Ardwall in the parish of New Abbey for many generations.\" 5 Black continues Thomas dictus Tumour held land in Aberdeen in 1382; John Turnoure held land in Irvine in 1426; William Tumour, merchant of Scotland, had a safe conduct in England, 1473; William Turnoure is recorded in Edinburgh, 1482.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Turner family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Turner research. Another 187 words (13 lines of text) covering the years 1180, 1191, 1300, 1500, 1575, 1585, 1591, 1600, 1607, 1615, 1617, 1623, 1626, 1638, 1645, 1662, 1663, 1668, 1669, 1672, 1675, 1676, 1677, 1688, 1691, 1693, 1700, 1707, 1714, 1735 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Turner History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nTurner Spelling Variations\n\nBefore the advent of the printing press and the first dictionaries, the English language was not standardized. Sound was what guided spelling in the Middle Ages, so one person's name was often recorded under several variations during a single lifetime. Spelling variations were common, even among the names of the most literate people. Known variations of the Turner family name include Turner, Turnerus, Turnor, Turnour, Turnoure and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Turner family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nCyril Tourneur, Turnour or Turner (1575?-1626), English dramatist, born about 1575, probably a near relative and possibly the son of Captain Richard Turnor or Turner\n\nSir Timothy Turner SL JP (1585-1677), an English judge\n\nThomas Turner (1591-1672), an English Royalist churchman and Dean of Canterbury\n\nFrancis Turner D.D.

The passage was expensive and the ships were dark, crowded, and unsafe; however, those who made the voyage safely were encountered opportunities that were not available to them in their homeland. Many of the families that reached the New World at this time went on to make important contributions to the emerging nations of the United States and Canada.

By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 21\n\nTurner Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMr. Thomas Turner, (b. 1610), aged 25, British settler traveling aboard the ship \"Matthew\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 22\n\nMr. Mathew Turner, (b. 1589), aged 46, British settler traveling aboard the ship \"Paul of London\" arriving in St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 22\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Turner (post 1700) +\n\nSophie Turner (b. 1996), also known as Sophie Belinda Jonas, an English actress who made her acting debut as Sansa Stark in the HBO epic fantasy television series Game of Thrones (2011–2019), for which she received a Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2019\n\nNicholas Robert \"Nik\" Turner (1940-2022), English musician, best known as a member of space rock pioneers Hawkwind; he played saxophone and flute, as well as being a vocalist and composer\n\nFrancis Michael \"Mike\" Turner MBE (1934-2015), English cricketer who played for active Leicestershire from 1954 to 1959\n\nDerek \"Rocky\" Turner (1932-2015), English professional Rugby League World Cup winning footballer of the 1940s, '50s and '60s\n\nSir Arthur Francis Turner (1912-1991), English Knight and Admiral\n\nJohn Hastings Turner (1892-1956), English dramatist and novelist\n\nAndrew Turner, British broadcaster\n\nBrit Turner (1967-2024), American drummer for BlackBerry Smoke\n\nKyle Turner (1992-2023), Australian professional rugby league footballer who played as a second-row, lock and centre for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League (NRL)\n\nJames Bayard \"Jim\" Turner (1941-2023), American professional football placekicker in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for the New York Jets and the Denver Broncos\n\n...
