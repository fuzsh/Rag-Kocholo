        "text": "Famous couples in pop, rock, country and R&B music may have more money, talent, or luck than the rest of us, but when it comes to love and marriage, they struggle with exactly the same relationship issues as everyone else. Some might argue that their troubles are magnified by fortune and fame. Here are some of the famous musical couples that got married, some stayed married, some didn’t, but whilst there were married they made great music together!\n\nIke and Tina Turner — married from 1962 until 1976\n\nIke & Tina Turner were an American musical duo consisting of husband and wife Ike Turner and Tina Turner. From 1960 to 1976, they performed live as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, supported by Ike Turner’s band, the Kings of Rhythm and backing vocalists, the Ikettes. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue was regarded as “one of the most potent live acts on the R&B circuit”\n\nThe duo had a string of R&B hits with their early recordings “A Fool In Love”, “It’s Gonna Work Out Fine”, “I Idolize You”, “Poor Fool”, and “Tra La La La La”. The release of “River Deep — Mountain High” in 1966, followed by a tour of the UK with The Rolling Stones, increased their popularity in Europe.\n\nTheir later works are noted for interpretive soul-infused re-arrangements of rock songs such as “Come Together”, “Honky Tonk Woman” and “Proud Mary”, the latter of which won them a Grammy Award in 1972.\n\nIke & Tina Turner received the first Golden European Record Award for their international hit “Nutbush City Limits” in 1974. They released dozens of albums; their most successful by chart performance being “Workin’ Together”\n\nIn spite of their success, they had a tumultuous marriage and the duo split in 1976. Following their divorce, Tina went on to enjoy a highly successful solo career.\n\nIke & Tina Turner were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.They have two singles inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, “River Deep — Mountain High” and “Proud Mary”.Rolling Stone ranked them №2 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.\n\nIke died on December 12, 2007, at age 76, while Tina died on May 24, 2023 at age 83.\n\nJohn and Michelle Phillips — married from 1962 until 1969\n\nJohn and Michelle Phillips were half of the Mamas & the Papas, a folk-rock vocal-group which recorded and performed from 1965 to 1968. The group was a defining force in the music scene of the counterculture of the 1960s.\n\nFormed in New York City, the group consisted of Americans John Phillips, Cass Elliot, and Michelle Phillips and Canadian Denny Doherty. Their sound was based on vocal harmonies arranged by John Phillips, the songwriter, musician, and leader of the group, who adapted folk to the new beat style of the early 1960s.\n\nThe Mamas & the Papas released five studio albums and 17 singles over four years, six of which made the Billboard top 10, and has sold close to 40 million records worldwide. The band reunited briefly to record the album “People Like Us” in 1971 but had ceased touring and performing by that time.\n\nThey were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 for their contributions to the music industry, and they reunited for the second and final time to perform at the induction ceremony that year. Some of their most popular singles include “California Dreamin’”, “Monday, Monday” and “Dedicated to the One I Love”.\n\nSonny and Cher — married from 1964 until 1975\n\nSonny & Cher were an American pop and entertainment duo in the 1960s and 1970s. The couple started their career in the mid-1960s as R&B backing singers for record producer Phil Spector.\n\nThe pair first achieved fame with two hit songs in 1965, “Baby Don’t Go” and “I Got You Babe”. Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, they released three studio albums in the late 1960s, as well as the soundtrack recordings for two unsuccessful movies, Good Times and Chastity, with Cher contributing vocals to one cut, “Chastity’s Song (Band of Thieves)”\n\nIn 1972, after three years of silence, the couple returned to the studio and released two other albums under the MCA/Kapp Records label.\n\nIn the 1970s, they also positioned themselves as media personalities with two top ten TV shows in the US, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and The Sonny & Cher Show.\n\nThe couple’s career as a duo ended in 1975 following their divorce. In the decade they spent together, Sonny and Cher were nominated for two Grammy Awards and sold over 40 million records worldwide.\n\nRolling Stone ranked them №18 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.\n\nPerforming under her first name, Cher went on to a highly successful career as a solo singer and actress, while Sonny Bono was eventually elected to Congress as a Republican U.S. Representative from California.\n\nThe two performers were inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998, following Sonny’s death in a skiing accident.\n\nDelaney and Bonnie — married from 1967 until 1972\n\nDelaney & Bonnie Bramlett enjoyed roughly three years in the music spotlight, and are largely forgotten today. You won’t hear much of their music on the radio, except, perhaps, for “Never Ending Song of Love”, their highest-charting hit, which reached number 13 in the USA. Yet echoes of their music continued for years after their peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Musicians who played with them went on to appear on recordings by artists whose sales and popularity overshadowed Delaney & Bonnie’s. Eric Clapton’s time with them charted the direction of his career after Cream and Blind Faith and secured his place in rock royalty.\n\nDelaney Bramlett learned the guitar in his youth. He moved to Los Angeles in 1959, where he became a session musician. His most notable early work was as a member of the Shindogs, the house band for the ABC-TV series Shindig! (1964–66), which also included guitarist and keyboardist Leon Russell.\n\nHe was the first artist signed to Independence Records. His debut single “Guess I Must be Dreamin” was produced by Russell.\n\nBonnie O’Farrell, was an accomplished singer at an early age, performing when she was 14 years old with blues guitarist Albert King and in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue — the first white Ikette. She moved to Los Angeles in 1967 and met and married Bramlett later that year.\n\nBy late 1971, Delaney and Bonnie’s often tempestuous relationship began to show signs of strain. Bonnie described their relationship as abusive due to their cocaine addictions and they fought often. Their next album, “Country Life”, was rejected by Atco on grounds of poor quality, and Atco/Atlantic elected to sell Delaney and Bonnie’s recording contract, including this album’s master tapes, to CBS Records. Columbia released this album, in a different track sequence from that submitted to Atco, as “D&B Together” in March 1972. It was Delaney and Bonnie’s last album of new material. They divorced in 1972.\n\nJohn McVie and Christine Perfect — married from 1968 until 1976\n\nChristine Perfect was a member of several bands, notably Chicken Shack, in the mid-1960s British blues scene. John McVie is best known as a member of the rock bands John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers from 1964 to 1967 and Fleetwood Mac since 1967. His surname, combined with that of drummer Mick Fleetwood, was the source for the band’s name. He joined Fleetwood Mac shortly after its formation by guitarist Peter Green in 1967, replacing temporary bass guitarist Bob Brunning. McVie and Fleetwood are the only two members of the group to appear on every Fleetwood Mac release, and for over fifty years have been the group’s last remaining original (or almost original in McVie’s case) members.\n\nWhile on tour, Fleetwood Mac would often share venues with fellow blues band Chicken Shack. It was on one such occasion that McVie met his future wife, the lead singer and piano player of Chicken Shack, Christine Perfect. Following a brief romance of, it has been said, only two weeks, McVie and Perfect got married with Peter Green as best man.\n\nWith the couple being unable to spend much time together because of the constant touring with their bands, Christine (now McVie) quit Chicken Shack to become a housewife to spend more time with John. However, following the departure of Peter Green from Fleetwood Mac in 1970, McVie successfully persuaded Christine to join him in Fleetwood Mac.\n\nJohn and Christine McVie divorced in 1976, but continued working together professionally. During this time the band recorded the album Rumours, a major artistic and commercial success that borrowed its title from the turmoil in McVie’s and other band members’ marriages and relationships.\n\nShe remained with the band through many changes of line-up, writing songs and performing lead vocals before partially retiring in 1998. McVie was described as the prime mover behind some of Fleetwood Mac’s biggest hits and eight songs she wrote or co-wrote, including “Don’t Stop”, “Everywhere” and “Little Lies”, appeared on Fleetwood Mac’s 1988 Greatest Hits album.\n\nJohnny and June Carter Cash — married from 1968 until June’s death in 2003\n\nJohnny Cash met June of the famed Carter Family while on tour, and the two became infatuated with each other.\n\nIn 1968, thirteen years after they first met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, Cash proposed to June, during a live performance in London, Ontario. The couple married on March 1, 1968, in Franklin, Kentucky.\n\nThey had one child together, John Carter Cash, born March 3, 1970. He was the only son for both Johnny and June. In addition to having his four daughters and John Carter, Cash also became stepfather to Carlene and Rosie, June’s daughters from her first two marriages, to, respectively, honky-tonk singer Carl Smith, and former police officer, football player, and race-car driver Edwin “Rip” Nix.\n\nCash and Carter continued to work, raise their child, create music and tour together for 35 years until June’s death in May 2003. Throughout their marriage, June attempted to keep Cash off amphetamines, often taking his drugs and flushing them down the toilet.\n\nJune remained with him even throughout his multiple admissions for rehabilitation treatment and decades of drug addiction. After June’s death in May 2003, Cash believed that his only reason for living was his music; he died only four months later.\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono — married from 1969 until John’s murder in 1980\n\nThe pair first met in November 1966 at a London gallery, where Ono was preparing for an exhibition of her work. They instantaneously connected and began a whirlwind (and at times controversial) romance.\n\nLennon and Ono began a personal and artistic relationship in 1968, collaborating on several experimental releases.\n\nLess than three years later, on March 20, 1969, the couple married. In classic ’60s style, Ono donned a miniskirt and wide-brimmed hat for the occasion, while Lennon matched his bride by wearing a white blazer and shirt.\n\nSoon after, the couple embarked on their “bagism” period which included creating a series of lithographs that depicted the pair on their honeymoon. This was one of many collaborations that Lennon and Ono would ultimately undertake. Famously, the duo staged a series of unforgettable “bed-ins,” which were akin to the sit-in form of protest popular at the time.\n\nAfter their marriage in 1969, they decided their future endeavours would be credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The band featured a rotating line-up of musicians including Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, Billy Preston, Jim Keltner, Keith Moon, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends and Lennon’s former Beatles bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr.\n\nAfter Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, they collaborated with Elephant’s Memory under the name “Plastic Ono Elephant’s Memory Band”. Lennon’s collaborations continued under similar names until 1974.\n\nOno and Lennon went on to collaborate on a series of music projects. Their last album together released before his death was Double Fantasy, which came out in 1980, just three weeks before Lennon’s assassination. The album was greeted with rapt attention, as Lennon had previously been on a five-year professional hiatus in order to care for the couple’s son, Sean.\n\nPaul and Linda McCartney — married from 1969 until Linda’s death in 1998\n\nOn May 15, 1967, while on a photo assignment in London, Linda Eastman met Paul McCartney at the Bag O’Nails club, where Georgie Fame was performing. They met again four days later at the launch party for Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band at Brian Epstein’s house. When her assignment was completed, she flew back to New York City.\n\nThey got together again the following May in New York, while McCartney and John Lennon were there to inaugurate Apple Records. A few months after he returned to London, McCartney invited Linda to spend some time with him there. When she arrived, they went to his home, where they spent the evening.\n\nThey were married in a small civil ceremony at Marylebone Town Hall on March 12, 1969. British fans reacted negatively, partly because his marriage ended McCartney’s status as the last unattached Beatle. John Lennon married Yoko Ono a week later, and both women were perceived by fans as reasons for the group’s breakup.\n\nLennon at one point publicly criticised the way the press treated Linda: “She got the same kind of insults, hatred, absolute garbage thrown at her for no reason whatsoever other than she fell in love with Paul McCartney.”\n\nIn late 1969, Paul fell into a deep depression due to the Beatles’ pending breakup after John Lennon’s departure. He spent days in bed and drank excessively, wondering what to do with his life. McCartney later said that Linda helped him pull out of that crisis by praising his work as a songwriter and persuading him to continue writing and recording.\n\nAfter a few troubled months, Paul McCartney wrote “Maybe I’m Amazed” in Linda’s honour. He explained during an interview that the song was written “for me and Linda”, and that with the Beatles breaking up, “that was my feeling: Maybe I’m amazed at what’s going on … Maybe I’m a man and maybe you’re the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won’t you help me understand … Maybe I’m amazed at the way you pulled me out of time, hung me on the line, Maybe I’m amazed at the way I really need you.” He added that “every love song I write is for Linda.”\n\nHis marriage to Linda, viewed as such a disastrous misstep at the time, became by far the happiest and most durable in pop. Despite the immensity of his fame and wealth, the couple managed to lead a relatively normal domestic life and prevent their children from becoming the usual pampered, neglected, screwed-up rock-biz brats. If the public never quite warmed to Linda, thanks mainly to her militant vegetarianism and animal-rights activism, she was acknowledged to have been the right one for him, just as Yoko had been for John.\n\nDuring their 29-year marriage, the McCartney’s had four children: she brought her daughter Heather (whom Paul later formally adopted) from her first marriage, and together the couple had Mary (b. 1969), Stella (b. 1971), and James (b. 1977).\n\nThey sometimes went to his farmhouse retreat in the west of Scotland which he had originally purchased to “escape Beatlemania”. They both liked and needed time away from the city, and were equally attracted to natural surroundings. Linda recalled the setting: “Scotland was like nothing I’d ever lived in. It was the most beautiful land you have ever seen, way at the end of nowhere. To me it was the first feeling I’d ever had of civilisation dropped away … so different from all the hotels and limousines and the music business, so it was quite a relief”\n\nMcCartney began writing more of his songs away from the studio. He wrote the song “The Lovely Linda” for his debut solo album while they were staying in Scotland. In 1971, they recorded the album “Ram”\n\nAfter that album they went on to form Wings. This band released consisted seven studio albums, one live album, two compilation albums, 29 singles and 19 music videos. The band made their debut with “Wild Life” released in December 1971.\n\nLinda became Lady McCartney when her husband was knighted in 1997. Her brother, entertainment lawyer John Eastman, had represented McCartney since the Beatles’ breakup, until his death in 2022.\n\nStevie Wonder and Syretta — married from 1970 until 1972\n\nIn September 1970, at the age of 20, Stevie Wonder married Syreeta Wright, a songwriter and former Motown secretary. Wright and Wonder worked together on his next album, “Where I’m Coming From” Wonder writing the music, and Wright helping with the lyrics.\n\nThey were married at Bernette Baptist Church in Detroit. They honeymooned in Bermuda.\n\nThey co-wrote “Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I’m Yours” and “If You Really Loved Me” whilst Syreeta recorded “With You, I’m Born Again” with Billy Preston in 1979.\n\nSyreeta was married three times and had four children. Her first marriage, to long time collaborator Stevie Wonder, lasted 18 months, from September 1970 until 1972. In 1975, Wright married bassist Curtis Robertson Jr., with whom she had two children, Jamal Robertson (b. 1976) and Hodari Robertson (b. 1979). Wright and Robertson divorced in 1982.\n\nWright briefly lived in Ethiopia in the mid-1970s, where she worked as a Transcendental Meditation teacher. She eventually settled in Los Angeles, where she lived for the rest of her life.\n\nWright died in 2004 of congestive heart failure, a side effect of chemotherapy and radiation treatments she was receiving for breast and bone cancer. She was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery.\n\nWonder meanwhile, has also been married three times. After his marriage to Syreeta Wright ended with an amicable divorce in 1972 he remained single and concentrated on his music career, however from 2001 until 2012 he was married to fashion designer Kai Millard. In October 2009, Wonder and Millard separated; Wonder filed for divorce in August 2012. In 2017 he married Tomeeka Bracy.\n\nWonder has nine children with five women.Wonder’s first child’s name is not publicly known.They were born to Yolanda Simmons, whom Wonder met when she applied for a job as secretary for his publishing company. Simmons gave birth to Wonder’s daughter Aisha Morris on February 2, 1975. After Aisha was born, Wonder said “she was the one thing that I needed in my life and in my music for a long time”. Aisha was the inspiration for Wonder’s hit single “Isn’t She Lovely?” She is now a singer who has toured with her father and accompanied him on recordings, including his 2005 album “A Time to Love” Wonder and Simmons also had a son, Keita, in 1977.\n\nIn 1983, Wonder had a son named Mumtaz Morris with Melody McCulley. Wonder also has a daughter, Sophia, and a son, Kwame, with a woman whose identity has not been publicly disclosed. Wonder has two sons with second wife Kai Millard Morris. The elder is named Kailand who occasionally performs as a drummer on stage with his father. The younger son, Mandla Kadjay Carl Stevland Morris, was born on May 13, 2005 (his father’s 55th birthday).\n\nWonder’s ninth child, his second with Tomeeka Robyn Bracy, was born in December 2014, amid rumours that he would be the father to triplets. This turned out not to be the case, and the couple’s new daughter was given the name Nia, meaning “purpose” (one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa).\n\nAgnetha Faltskog and Björn Ulvaeus — married from 1971 until 1980\n\nAgnetha Fältskog and Björn Ulvaeus were 50% of the Swedish pop supergroup ABBA, who are one of the most popular and successful musical groups of all time, and are one of the best-selling music acts in the history of popular music.\n\nThey were married On 6 July 1971 and went on to have two children: Linda Elin Ulvaeus (born 23 February 1973) and Peter Christian Ulvaeus (born 4 December 1977). The couple announced their separation in January 1979, and their divorce was finalised in July 1980.\n\nABBA are among the best-selling music artists in history, with record sales estimated to be between 150 million to 385 million sold worldwide and the group were ranked 3rd best-selling singles artists in the United Kingdom with a total of 11.3 million singles sold by 3 November 2012.\n\nIn May 2023, ABBA were awarded the BRIT Billion Award which celebrates those who have surpassed the milestone of one billion UK streams in their career. ABBA were the first group from a non-English-speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, United States, Republic of Ireland, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. They are the best-selling Swedish band of all time and the best-selling band originating in continental Europe.\n\nABBA had eight consecutive number-one albums in the UK. The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin America and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish. ABBA were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, the first recording artists to receive this honour from outside an Anglophonic country.\n\nIn 2015, their song “Dancing Queen” was inducted into the Recording Academy’s Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2016, the group reunited and started working on a digital avatar concert tour. Newly recorded songs were announced in 2018. “Voyage”, their first new album in 40 years, was released on 5 November 2021 to positive critical reviews and strong sales in numerous countries.\n\nABBA Voyage, a concert residency featuring ABBA as virtual avatars, opened in May 2022 in London.\n\nCarly Simon and James Taylor — married from 1972 until 1983\n\nCarly Simon and James Taylor were two of the defining voices of the 1970s, topping the charts with both their individual work and their duets.\n\nYet while their music will leave a lasting legacy, the ‘golden’ couple’s romance lasted only a decade. The two singer-songwriters married in 1972, a year after their relationship began.\n\nThey have two children, Sarah “Sally” Maria Taylor (born January 7, 1974) and Benjamin “Ben” Simon Taylor (born January 22, 1977), both of whom are musicians and political activists. Simon and Taylor divorced in 1983.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1979, Simon sang backup vocals on the following James Taylor songs and studio albums: “One Man Parade” from One Man Dog “Rock ’n’ Roll Is Music Now”, “Let It All Fall Down”, “Me and My Guitar”, “Daddy’s Baby”, and “Ain’t No Song” from Walking Man . “How Sweet It Is” from Gorilla. “Shower the People”, “A Junkie’s Lament”, “Slow Burning Love”, and “Family Man” from In the Pocket .”Terra Nova” (which she co-wrote with Taylor) from JT. “B.S.U.R.” from Flag.\n\nThey divorced in 1983 and no longer speak.\n\nNick Ashford and Valerie Simpson — married from 1974 until Nick’s death in 2011\n\nAshford & Simpson were an American husband-and-wife songwriting, production, recording duo composed of Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson .\n\nThey met at Harlem’s White Rock Baptist Church in 1964. After having recorded unsuccessfully as a duo, they joined an aspiring solo artist and former member of The Ikettes, Joshie Jo Armstead, at the Scepter/Wand label, where their compositions were recorded by Ronnie Milsap, “Never Had It So Good”) and Maxine Brown, “One Step at a Time”, as well as The Shirelles, The Guess Who and Chuck Jackson. Another of the trio’s songs, “Let’s Go Get Stoned”, gave Ray Charles a number one U.S. R&B hit in 1966.\n\nThat same year, Ashford and Simpson joined Motown, where their best-known songs included “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough”, “You’re All I Need to Get By”, “Ain’t Nothing Like the Real Thing”, and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).”\n\nAshford and Simpson wrote many other hit songs, including Chaka Khan’s “I’m Every Woman” and “Is It Still Good to Ya?”, originally recorded by the duo in 1978 and covered by Teddy Pendergrass in 1980.\n\nAs performers, Ashford & Simpson’s best-known duets are “Solid” and “Found a Cure” . The duo were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002. They are also recipients of The Rhythm & Blues Foundation’s Pioneer Award, ASCAP Founders Award, and the Grammy Trustee Award. Rolling Stone ranked them №19 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.\n\nIn latter times, Ashford & Simpson recorded and toured sporadically, whilst in 1996, they opened a restaurant and live entertainment venue, Sugar Bar in New York City, with an open mic on Thursday nights, where performers included Queen Latifah, Vickie Natale and Felicia Collins.\n\nAshford & Simpson recorded the album “Been Found” with poet Maya Angelou in 1996. Around that time, they were also featured disc jockeys on New York radio station WRKS.\n\nOn August 16, 2006, Playbill Online reported that they were writing the score for a musical based on E. Lynn Harris’s novel Invisible Life. In January 2007, they, along with Tina Turner, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey, Sidney Poitier, director Spike Lee and comedian Chris Rock accompanied Oprah Winfrey when she opened her Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa.\n\nThey were given writing credit on Amy Winehouse’s 2007 CD Back to Black for the single “Tears Dry on Their Own”. The track is based on a sample of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s 1967 Motown hit “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough”.\n\nThey had begun performing their act in small, intimate venues, such as Feinstein’s at the Regency in New York and the Rrazz Room in San Francisco and in January 2009, they released a CD and DVD of their live performances titled “The Real Thing”\n\nOn June 22, 2009, they made a guest performance at a party at Tribeca Rooftop, New York, to celebrate Virgin Atlantic’s birthday party. They also made their first appearance in Tokyo, Japan, in November 2009, and performed eight shows in four days at Blue Note Tokyo.\n\nAt President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, Ashford and Simpson rewrote their song, “Solid”, as “Solid as Barack”. They dedicated it to him at his inaugural festivities.\n\nAshford died at the age of 70 in a New York City hospital on August 22, 2011, four days before Valerie Simpson’s 65th birthday, of complications from throat cancer. His publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said that he had undergone radiation therapy to treat his illness.\n\nDaryl Dragon and Toni Tennille — married from 1975 until 2014\n\nDaryl Dragon and Toni Tennille, known professionally as Captain & Tennille, were American recording artists whose primary success occurred in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1972, Toni Tennille was the co-writer of an ecology-themed musical, Mother Earth. At that time, Daryl Dragon (son of composer Carmen Dragon) was working as a keyboardist for the Beach Boys, where he got his stage name “Captain” because he wore a ship captain’s hat while performing.\n\nWhen Tennille’s show was preparing to move from San Francisco’s Marines Memorial Theatre to Southern California’s South Coast Repertory, a call was put out for a replacement keyboardist. Dragon was between tours when he heard about the opening, met Tennille in San Francisco to audition, and landed the gig.\n\nDragon later reciprocated by recommending Tennille to the Beach Boys when the band needed an additional keyboardist, and they hired her. She toured with them for a year, and has since been known as the Beach Boys’ one and only “Beach Girl.”\n\nRealising their collaborative potential when the tour was over, Tennille and Dragon began performing as a duo at the Smokehouse Restaurant in Encino, California. They started to become popular in the Los Angeles area, and their early version of the Tennille-penned “The Way I Want to Touch You” became popular on a local radio station. This led to a recording contract with A&M Records.\n\nTheir first hit single, a rendition of Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield’s “Love Will Keep Us Together”, reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart nine weeks after its 1975 debut, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a Gold disc by the RIAA on July 1, 1975. Tennille paid tribute to Sedaka in the recording when she sang the overdub “Sedaka is back” at the outro.\n\nThe duo successfully mined the Sedaka songbook a number of times over their career. Two of their other hit singles were the Sedaka co-writes “Lonely Night (Angel Face)” and “You Never Done It Like That”. Their Spanish recording of “Love Will Keep Us Together”, “Por Amor Viviremos”, also charted in 1975; it was the first time two versions of the same single charted simultaneously. Tennille and Dragon included renditions of several other Sedaka songs on their albums.\n\nTennille and Dragon married on November 11, 1975. A wedding date of Valentine’s Day 1974 had long been erroneously reported: On their television variety show, Tennille claimed they were married on Valentine’s Day, as did the February 14, 1976, edition of Casey Kasem’s American Top 40 radio show.\n\nThey have five albums certified gold or platinum and scored numerous hits on the US singles charts, the most enduring of which included “Love Will Keep Us Together”, “Do That to Me One More Time”, and “Muskrat Love”. They hosted their own television variety series on ABC in 1976–77.\n\nTennille filed for divorce from Dragon in the State of Arizona on January 16, 2014, after 39 years of marriage. Dragon was unaware of the termination of his marriage until he was served with the divorce papers. The divorce documents referenced health insurance or health issues and Tennille had written in her blog in 2010 that Dragon’s neurological condition, known as essential tremor, was characterised by such extreme tremors that he could no longer play keyboards. Dragon later stated that some of his health problems were the result of errors in dosing his medication.\n\nIn 2016, Toni Tennille, Tennille’s memoir was published. In it, Tennille painted an unflattering picture of Dragon and their years together, writing that he was controlling and emotionally distant. “I can say without exaggeration that he showed no physical affection for me during our very long marriage,” she wrote, claiming that the couple always slept in separate bedrooms.\n\nDragon and Tennille remained close friends until his death from complications of kidney failure on January 2, 2019, Tennille was at his side when he died.\n\nSuzi Quatro and Len Tuckey — married from 1976 until 1992\n\nSusan (Suzi) Quatro an American singer, bass guitarist, songwriter and actor, married Richard Leonard ‘Len’ Tuckey a Scottish musician, songwriter, composer and record producer in 1976.\n\nIn 1972 Tuckey joined Suzi Quatro’s backing band and came to worldwide prominence. In the 1970s the band had a string of singles that found success in Europe and Australia, with both “Can the Can” (1973) and “Devil Gate Drive” (1974) reaching №1 in several countries. He is credited as the co-writer of many of Quatro’s songs, including hits such as “Mama’s Boy”\n\nThey had two children together (Laura born in 1982 and Richard Leonard born in 1984), they were divorced in 1992.\n\nBenny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad — married from 1978 until 1981\n\nAnni-Frid Synni Lyngstad known simply as Frida, is a Norwegian-born Swedish singer who is best known as one of the founding members and lead singers of the pop band ABBA. She grew up in Torshälla, Sweden and started her first solo career there, as a jazz singer in 1967, through a talent competition called New Faces.\n\nGöran Bror Benny Andersson met Björn Ulvaeus in June 1966, and the two men started writing songs together, their first being “Isn’t It Easy To Say”, eventually recorded by the Hep Stars. He also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with Lasse Berghagen, with whom he wrote several songs and submitted “Hej, Clown” for the 1969 Melodifestivalen — the Swedish Eurovision Song Festival finals. The song finished in second place. During this contest, he met vocalist Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and they soon became a couple. . By 1971, they were living together, but did not marry until 6 October 1978, during the height of ABBA’s success. However, after only two years of marriage, they separated on 26 November 1980 and were divorced in 1981. Around the same time, his songwriting companion, Ulvaeus, met vocalist Agnetha Fältskog\n\nThe personal relationships and Andersson and Ulvaeus’ songwriting collaboration led quite naturally to the very close cooperation which the four friends had during the following years. Benny and Björn scored their first hits as songwriters in the spring of 1969: “Ljuva sextital” (a hit with Brita Borg) and “Speleman” (a hit for the Hep Stars). As the two couples began supporting each other during recording sessions, the sound of the women’s voices convinced the songwriters to model their ‘group’ on various MOR acts such as Blue Mink, Middle of the Road and Sweet. Thus, ABBA came to life.\n\nGloria and Emilio Estefan — married since 1978\n\nKnown far and wide as the “Queen of Latin Pop,” Gloria Estefan has sold over 45 million records to become the single most successful crossover performer in Latin-music history.\n\nIn an industry increasingly dominated by disposable artists and short-term careers, Gloria Estefan continues to thrive and firmly command the ardent praise of fans worldwide.\n\nAs a student at the University of Miami in 1975, Gloria joined a small-time local Cuban-American quartet called the Miami Latin Boys as an accompanist and occasional front singer where she blossomed into a polished and self-assured perfomer under the guidance of the group’s leader and keyboardist Emilio Estefan. A year and a half after she joined the band, the group was re-baptized Miami Sound Machine and began cutting albums. The band became a family affair when Gloria and Emilio married in 1978.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1983, Miami Sound Machine recorded four Spanish language albums of ballads, samba and pop songs. In 1985, the band broke through in a major way with the release of Primitive Love and it’s single “Conga.” The bouncy, percussion-heavy album was an instant success, becoming the first single to camp out on Billboard’s pop, dance, black and Latin charts concurrently. Gloria released her first solo album, “Cut Both Ways” in 1989. The fact that she has remained true to all facets of her bi-cultural heritage has brought her much glorification over the years, especially in Miami’s Cuban community where she is know fondly as “nuestra Glorita” (“our little Gloria”).\n\nOver the past 20 years, Emilio Estefan, Jr. has made a name for himself as the entrepreneur who heads up Estefan Enterprises, Inc. Along with managing the career of his superstar wife Gloria, with whom he developed their singular Latin/pop sound, Emilio has successfully delved into all segments of the music industry, ranging from production to publishing.\n\nKnown as the “godfather or the Miami sound,” Emilio was the first to envision the fusion of Latin music and rhythm with English lyrics that has become the hottest trend in music since the invention of jazz. In 1975, he formed a group called the Miami Latin Boys that performed traditional Cuban music with a contemporary flavour. The group’s popularity grew and they changed their name to Miami Sound Machine and added a female singer named Gloria Fajardo. By 1985 their song Conga had become an international smash hit and transformed the group’s lead singer — now Gloria Estefan, into the first Latin Female crossover superstar.\n\nThe group enjoyed further success with hits such as Rhythm is Gonna Get You and Anything for You. Gloria launched her solo career in 1989 and went on to sell more than 70 million albums worldwide while Emilio began exploring songwriting and producing, forming his own label, Crescent Moon Productions. He has worked with some of the top recording stars of our time including Jon Secada, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Albita, Ricky Martin, Will Smith, Shakira and Alejandro Fernandez.\n\nToday, Emilio Estefan is a five-time Grammy winner, a two-time Latin Grammy winner, the first-ever Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences’ Person of the Year, a two-time Cable Ace Award winner and the head of a diverse enterprise that includes writing, composing, record production, films, restaurants and a magazine.\n\nA jukebox musical, On Your Feet!, about the life of Gloria and Emilio Estefan premiered on Broadway November 5, 2015.\n\nGloria and Emilio Estefan live in Miami and have two grown children both active in the entertainment industry.\n\nBruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa — married since 1991\n\nIt’s a love that was born in the USA.\n\nBruce “The Boss” Springsteen and his wife of nearly three decades, Patti Scialfa, grew up in New Jersey, percolating in similar social circles until finally hitting the road together in the early ’80s for a tour that would live on today as the E Street Band’s best live shows ever.\n\nIn June 2021, Springsteen returned to Broadway for his show Springsteen on Broadway, which was the first show to open since New York’s theatre district shut down in March 2020. The Springsteen’s also has exciting personal news: Their daughter, Jessica, was named to the U.S. Olympic equestrian jumping team. She started riding at the age of four on the family’s farm in New Jersey, and now is ranked number 3 in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Springsteen, his wife is an essential part of the life he lives today. “Patti’s been at the centre of my life for the entire second half of my life and an enormous amount of guidance and inspiration and, you know, I can’t overstate it”\n\nThe two actually grew up only 10 miles away from each other. She was raised on the Jersey Shore. He grew up in Long Branch and found fame on the Asbury Park boardwalk. Scialfa knew Springsteen’s bandmates before she actually met The Boss himself.\n\nThe pair first met at a bar called The Stone Pony. Now known as “that place The Boss made famous in the ‘80s” it’s located in Asbury Park in Monmouth County, New Jersey. About the first time he remembers seeing Scialfa, Springsteen said, “She came out and played onstage with, it might have been Bobby Bandiera or, I forget which local band was playing. But she came out and played the Exciters’ hit ‘Tell Him,’ and she was very striking right from the beginning”\n\nWith a resume touting Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, Springsteen and his E Street Band invited Scialfa on the road as part of their Born in the USA tour. On opening night in 1984, The Boss had some advice for her. “I was wearing some kind of pastel kind of ribbony top,” she told Rolling Stone, “and Bruce goes, ‘Maybe you should wear something not as pretty” and so the flirtation began. Though Springsteen was married to actress Julianne Phillips at the time, nothing could keep the two lovebirds apart. The rest — as they say — is history.\n\nThe couple have melted hearts with their passionate duets. Before they married, the two often performed onstage together during the Born in the USA and Tunnel of Love Express tours. Years later, they’re still setting off sparks on the big stage.\n\nSpringsteen and Scialfa lived in New Jersey before moving to Los Angeles, where they decided to start a family. On June 8, 1991, Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends.\n\nIn a 1995 interview, Springsteen said, “I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, ‘Hey, what does it matter?’ But it does matter. It’s very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly — which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals — is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society’s acceptance of you … Patti and I both found that it did mean something.”\n\nA year before they married, Scialfa gave birth to Evan James. In 1991, they had Jessica Rae and then came Sam Ryan, born in 1994.\n\nSpringsteen recently went public revealing his enduring battle with his own mental health. According to Esquire, depression took a strong hold of him in his 60s. He described it as “an attack of what was called an ‘agitated depression.’ During this period, I was so profoundly uncomfortable in my own skin that I just wanted OUT. It feels dangerous and brings plenty of unwanted thoughts. … Demise and foreboding were all that awaited. Patti help me get through the depression, I’ll love her forever for that”\n\nKurt Cobain and Courtney Love — married from 1992 until Kurt’s death in 1994\n\nCourtney Love and Kurt Cobain formally met in a nightclub in Portland, Seattle, on 12 January 1990, but Love had apparently developed a crush on the Nirvana frontman after seeing him perform at a gig the year before.\n\nCobain appeared to dismiss Love’s advances at first, commenting “I was determined to be a bachelor for a few months, but I knew I liked Courtney so much right away that it was a really hard struggle to stay away from her for so many months”\n\nOn February 24, 1992, a few days after the conclusion of Nirvana’s “Pacific Rim” tour, Cobain and Love were married on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. Love wore a satin and lace dress once owned by Frances Farmer, and Cobain donned a Guatemalan purse and wore green pajamas, because he had been “too lazy to put on a tux.” Eight people were in attendance at the ceremony, including fellow Nirvana member Dave Grohl.\n\nLove said she was warned by the Sonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon that marrying Cobain would “destroy her life”; Love responded: “‘Whatever! I love him, and I want to be with him!’ … It wasn’t his fault. He wasn’t trying to do that”\n\nAt the time of their wedding, Courtney was already pregnant with daughter Frances who was born August 18, 1992. A sonogram was included in the artwork for Nirvana’s single, “Lithium.”\n\nIn a 1992 Vanity Fair article, Love admitted to a drug binge with Cobain in the early weeks of her pregnancy. At the time, she claimed that Vanity Fair had misquoted her. Love later admitted to using heroin before knowing she was pregnant. The couple were asked by the press if Frances was addicted to drugs at birth. The Los Angeles County Department of Children’s Services visited the Cobain’s days after Love gave birth and later took them to court, stating that their drug usage made them unfit parents.\n\nDuring Nirvana’s tour stop in Munich in 1994, Kurt was diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis. He was then sent to Rome for medical treatment, where he met wife Courtney Love. According to Love, she awoke to find Cobain had overdosed on Champagne and Rohypnol. The singer was then rushed to hospital, where he stayed for five days.\n\nAfter that incident, Cobain and Love had a domestic issue, whereby Love called the police to their Seattle home. Authorities confiscated three guns and some pills from Cobain, who had locked himself in a bedroom upstairs. According to Cobain, he wasn’t trying to take his own life, but was hiding from Courtney.\n\nLove and some of Cobain’s close friends then staged an intervention to convince Kurt to seek help for his drug use and depression. After some time, Kurt finally agreed to go to rehab in LA. Cobain then broke out of rehab and got a flight back to Seattle, but friends and family were unaware of his whereabouts.\n\nOn 8 April 1994, an electrician who was installing an alarm discovered Kurt’s body at his home on Lake Washington Boulevard.Later, the coroner report stated that Cobain had actually died on the 5 April.\n\nJack and Meg White — married from 1996 until 2000\n\nThe White Stripes were one of the biggest bands of the 2000s and their take on garage rock saw them achieve huge success, even headlining Glastonbury in 2005.\n\nWhen they first rose to fame, the couple famously portrayed themselves as brother and sister, but they were in fact husband and wife.\n\nOn 30 March 2001, the Detroit Free Press writer Christopher Walton uncovered one piece of information that caused a sensation. While Jack White continued with the story that his musical partner Meg was his sister, the reporter had been doing some digging…\n\nInstead of going to college, Meg decided she wanted to be a chef and began working at Memphis Smoke. This is where she met Jack and they began dating. Meg decided to learn the drums on a whim and Jack liked her fresh and simple style. They began playing together and played their first gig at the Gold Dollar in Detroit.\n\nMeg and Jack White were married before they formed a band. They may have concocted the siblings story as a gimmick when they formed the band in 1997, but they officially became Jack and Meg White a when they married a year before on 21 September 1996.\n\nJack is often thought of as the brains behind the operation and the architect of the whole band, but it was actually Meg — who was born Megan Martha White — who was responsible for their name. Jack, who was born John Anthony Gillis, changed his name legally to hers when they got married.\n\nAccording to folklore, The band was called The White Stripes as a nod to Meg’s penchant for peppermint sweets. Jack White is quoted as saying: “Meg loves peppermints, and we were going to call ourselves The Peppermints. But since our last name was White, we decided to call it The White Stripes. It revolved around this childish idea, the ideas kids have — because they are so much better than adult ideas, right?”\n\nBy the time the band had even released their breakout album White Blood Cells in 2001, they had already called it quits as husband and wife. They are said to have divorced in March 2000, almost a year before the third album hit the shops.\n\nAfter a long hiatus with no new releases, the duo reported that they were disbanding.\n\nTaking to their official website on 2 February 2011, they wrote: “The reason is not due to artistic differences or lack of wanting to continue, nor any health issues as both Meg and Jack are feeling fine and in good health. They added: “It’s for a myriad of reasons, but mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way.”\n\nTim McGraw and Faith Hill — married since 1996\n\nAs sweet as a love song! Faith Hill and Tim McGraw have one of the strongest relationships in the music industry — and their bond just keeps getting better.\n\nThe country singers first met at the New Faces Show in Nashville in late 1994. At the time, the “Breathe” singer had just finalised her divorce from Daniel Hill and McGraw was dating Kristine Donahue. Two years later, they joined each other on the road on the Spontaneous Combustion tour.\n\nAfter a whirlwind romance, they were married in October 1996 in his Louisiana home town. Later, McGraw looked back on the romantic moment he proposed to his soulmate on tour.\n\nWe were in the dressing room, here, June 26, 1996 and it was raining and stuff and we’d been on tour for a while together, and I joked around with her about getting married. And so I looked at her, grabbed her by the hand, and dropped forward [on my knees] onstage. She said, ‘We’re at a country music festival in a trailer house, and you’re asking me to marry you?’ And I said, ‘Yeah.’ So I went onstage … When I came back offstage, [I saw] a Sharpie with lipstick kisses all over it, saying, ‘Yes! I’m gonna be your wife”\n\nThe couple brought their love all across the country, and later, around the world, on their Soul2Soul tour. Between gigs, awards shows and recording hits, the pair welcomed three daughters: Grace in 1997, Maggie in 1998 and Aubrey in 2001.\n\nIn July 2010 After floods devastated their beloved Music City, McGraw and his wife led the Nashville Rising benefit concert and helped raise more than $2 million for people in middle Tennessee.\n\nIn June 2014, Seven years after getting sober, McGraw told Men’s Health magazine that his wife played a big role in his quitting drinking. “When your wife tells you it’s gone too far, that’s a big wake-up call,” McGraw explained. “That, and realising you’re gonna lose everything you have”\n\nIn March 2018 Tim McGraw collapsed on stage during a concert in Dublin, Ireland. Faith told the audience “Tim is fine. We’ve all been a little bit dehydrated traveling so much. He’s been super dehydrated, and I apologise but I made the decision that he cannot come back out on the stage” she said at the time. “So drink water, people, keep yourself hydrated.”\n\nWhen Faith’s father passed away in February 2019 at 88 yrs old. “He was the sweetest, kindest most gentle man I’ve ever known,” McGraw wrote via Instagram. “No man in my life has ever made such an impact on me as to how to be a human, a father and a friend … I’ll never, in 10 lifetimes, be able to live up to his example, but man, he has set a mark that all of us should strive for. His legacy will live on through the 3 beautiful souls he raised, Faith and her brothers, Steve and Wesley”\n\nElvis Costello and Diane Krall — Married in 2003\n\nDiana Jean Krall is a Canadian jazz pianist and singer known for her contralto vocals.

They begin dating when she was 19, after getting to know each other. “We were friends first for a year and a half before we went on any dates.

I really don’t believe that you will love the same thing when you’re 20 as you do at 30. So that was my rule: Before the age of 25, I would never get married. I feel like you have to get to know yourself, know what you want, spend some time by yourself, and be proud of who you are before you can share that with someone else.”\n\n“About two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time,” she said in 2013 “And I heard the heartbeat, which was the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life … Being pregnant was very much like falling in love. You are so open. You are so overjoyed. There’s no words that can express having a baby growing inside of you, so of course you want to scream it out and tell everyone. I flew back to New York to get my check up — and no heartbeat. Literally the week before I went to the doctor, everything was fine, but there was no heartbeat”\n\nBeyoncé reveals she is pregnant at the MTV VMAs in L.A., cradling what appeared to be a bump on the red carpet before telling the audience during her “Love on Top” performance, “I want you to stand up on your feet.

Five days later, video footage of Solange seemingly attacking Jay in an elevator at an after party leaks online. None of the parties involved have ever spoken out about what caused the altercation, but tabloids reported that Solange was upset with Jay over alleged cheating rumours.\n\nDays after the incident, the trio released a statement: “There has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologised to each other and we have moved forward as a united family. The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behaviour throughout that evening are simply false. At the end of the day families have problems and we’re no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We’ve put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same”\n\nIn August 2014 Solange addressed the incident, calling it ‘that thing.’ “What’s important is that my family and I are all good,” the singer said, “What we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that”\n\nBeyoncé releases her “***Flawless” remix featuring Nicki Minaj, seemingly nodding to the Met Gala incident with the new lyric: “Of course sometimes s — go down when it’s a billion dollars on the elevator”\n\nOn Aug. 24, JAY-Z and Blue Ivy take the stage at the MTV VMAs in L.A. to present Beyoncé with her Video Vanguard Award. “Thank you.

Good night!”\n\nBeyoncé’s Lemonade special airs on HBO and the album goes on sale after a mysterious, week-long promo campaign. The lyrics in songs like “Hold Up,” “Don’t Hurt Yourself” and “Sorry” hint at infidelity and a marriage in crisis, while “Sand Castles” and “All Night” are about redemption, forgiveness and a renewed bond. Critics and fans flooded social media with commentary on the visual album, many interpreting it to be autobiographical while others thought it a was a self-promotional creative endeavour.\n\nBeyoncé reveals she and JAY-Z are expecting twins on February 1st.”We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over,” she captioned a photo of herself cradling her baby bump. “We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. — The Carters.” Later that month, the couple attended both the Grammys and a pre-Oscars party, where the singer showed off her growing bump in multiple fitted ensembles.\n\nJAY-Z and Beyoncé celebrated nine years of marriage, with the mum-to-be sharing a series of photos and a sweet montage video — set to her song “Die With You” — to mark the occasion. “I don’t need air in my lungs. If I can’t sing your song,” one image read — showing the couple’s matching ring finger “IV” tattoos (Beyoncé was born on Sept. 4; JAY-Z on Dec. 4; they tied the knot on April 4).\n\nThat same month, the couple jetted off to Bora Bora for a South Pacific babymoon — likely their last big vacation before the twins arrive.

The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone’s face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself,” he told the outlet, revealing therapy helped him in tough times. “So, you know, most people don’t want to do that. You don’t want to look inside yourself. And so you walk away.”\n\nBeyoncé introduces twins Rumi and Sir on Instagram\n\nJAY-Z and Beyoncé kick off their On the Run II tour in Cardiff, England, on June 6.
