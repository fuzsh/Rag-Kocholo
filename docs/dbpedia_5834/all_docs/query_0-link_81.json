        "text": "Sometimes, some divorced wives continue to use their ex-husband's surnames for whatever reasons best known to them.\n\nThis may be due to some business transactions or vital documentation which they may have done with those names for which reasons they may still want to keep them.\n\nHowever speaking on the Home Affairs show, lawyer, and family life counselor, Kweku Yamoah Paintsil advised such women rather buy the names and use them if they feel so important to their brands and businesses.\n\nCiting the American-born and naturalized Swiss retired singer, dancer, and actress, Tina Turner, the astute lawyer emphasized that she faced a similar instance and had to buy her husband’s surname to maintain her brand.\n\nGenerally, he noted that if anyone including a former wife is using one’s name, the man can go to court to seek a common law remedy known as jactitation or an order to take his/her name off her.\n\nFurther to the above, lawyer Paintsil noted that it is illegal for a man who has contracted a registered customary marriage to marry another under the ordinance. According to him, such a man can only have customary marriages. Still, if he wants to convert one of them to the ordinance, he ought to dissolve all the other customary marriages.\n\nAlso, he noted that the wearing of wedding rings by couples has no legal essence of the marriage but rather trappings. As such he noted that such things are merely customary and that a man can give a spouse anything for signification including even rings and eye-glasses.\n\nSpeaking about whether a man can take an expensive ring back during divorce, he noted that the law presumes that such things as rings bought for women are tendered as gifts and thus not returnable.\n\nMoreover, lawyer Paintsil touched on how two Ghanaians abroad thus Saudi Arabia can marry in that country. He noted that in such an instance, the two would-be couples ought to go to the Ghana mission there for an arrangement to be made in the office in Ghana for a registered certificate to be issued to obtain a special license leading to a place being selected and an officer in the foreign mission being chosen to officiate the marriage."
