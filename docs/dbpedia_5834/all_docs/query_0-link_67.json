Let’s check out some details about this Grammy Hall of Fame tune.\n\nVideo Inspiration\n\nThe Lyrics\n\n“What’s Love Got to Do with It” by Tina Turner\n\nYou must understand how the touch of your hand Makes my pulse react That it's only the thrill of boy meetin' girl Opposites attract It's physical Only logical You must try to ignore that it means more than that Oh oh What's love got to do, got to do with it? What's love but a second hand emotion? What's love got to do, got to do with it? Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? It may seem to you that I'm acting confused When you're close to me If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace I've got cause to be There's a name for it There's a phrase that fits But whatever the reason you do it for me Oh oh What's love got to do, got to do with it? What's love but a second hand emotion? What's love got to do, got to do with it? Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? Huh I've been takin' on a new direction But I have to say I've been thinkin' about my own protection It scares me to feel this way Ho oh What's love got to do, got to do with it? What's love but a second hand emotion? What's love got to do, got to do with it? Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? Got to do, got to do with it What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion? What's love got to do, got to do with it? Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? Got to do Huh, got to do with it (What's love but a second hand emotion?) What's love got to do, got to do with it? Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? What's love? (Ooh, ooh) Got to do it Got to do it What's love? (But a second hand emotion?) Got to do Huh, got to do with it (What's love but a second hand emotion?) What's love got to do, got to do with it? Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken...\n\nAbout the Artist and the Song\n\nTina Turner, considered “The Queen of Rock an Roll” and one of the greatest singers of all time, was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Brownsville, Tennessee, the youngest of three daughters of Swiss parents Floyd Richard Bullock and his wife Zelma Priscilla (Currie) Bullock. Her father was an overseer for the sharecroppers on a farm in nearby Nutbush, Tennessee, where Tina recalled picking cotton with her family from a very young age. During her childhood, Anna Mae was separated from her sisters when their parents relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, to work at a World War II defense facility. She was sent to stay with her strict paternal grandparents, Alex and Roxanna Bullock, who were deacon and deaconess of a Baptist church in Nutbush. Once the war ended, the sisters were reunited with their parents in Knoxville.\n\nWhen Anna Mae was 11 years old, her mother left the family without warning and fled to St. Louis to escape her abusive husband. Two years later, Anna Mae’s father remarried and moved to Detroit, leaving the three girls with their maternal grandmother, Georgeanna Currie, in Brownsville. As a teen, Anna Mae was employed as a domestic worker for the Henderson family. She was in their home when she was notified that her half-sister and two of her cousins were killed in a car accident.\n\nDuring her childhood, Anna Mae sang in the church choir and in high school, she was a cheerleader and a basketball player, and “socialized every chance she got.” When Anna Mae was 16, her grandmother Currie died and she moved to live with her mother in St. Louis where she graduated from Sumner High School in 1958. Right after high school, Anna Mae was employed as a hospital nurse’s aide.\n\nDuring their teen years, Anna Mae and her sister began frequenting St. Louis nightclubs. She first saw Ike Turner perform in 1957 and she was so impressed with his talent that she asked if she could sing with his band despite knowing that few women had ever sung with him. He said he would call her but he lied so one night Anna Mae hijacked the microphone from the drummer during an intermission and sang a B.B. King blues ballad. Ike loved it so much that she became the featured vocalist with his band that night. During her early days with Ike, he taught her the finer points of voice control and performance.\n\nIn 1960, upon being urged to make Anna Mae the star of his show, Ike renamed her Tina because it rhymed with Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, his inspiration. He then added his last name to her stage persona and trademarked the name “Tina Turner” as a form of protection for him. If Anna Mae ever left him as previous singers had, he could simply replace her with another Tina Turner. (Hmm. I think that plan backfired for him.)\n\nAnna Mae Bullock was publicly introduced for the first time as Tina Turner in 1960 with her single “A Fool in Love.” It reached number 2 on the R&B charts and number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Ms. Turner was immediately set on a trajectory to success and musical superstardom.\n\nTina’s tumultuous relationship with Ike is heavily documented in news articles, stories, and books, so I will spare you the ugly details of that horror. She had two biological children. A son, Raymond Craig Hill, was born in 1958 to Tina and Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill. In 1960, she gave birth to her and Ike’s only child, Ronald Renelle Turner. Tina eventually adopted Ike’s two other children and raised them as her own. And Ike adopted Tina’s oldest son and changed his name to Craig Raymond Turner.\n\nWith a music career spanning more than 6 decades, there is so much written about this beloved woman that I simply cannot write a brief synopsis of her life. So I am not even going to try. You can go read more if you are interested. Just type “Tina Turner” into a Google search and you will find reading material for months!\n\nTina Turner died on May 24, 2023, in her home in Switzerland following years of poor health and illness. She was 83.\n\nNow let’s learn about the song, What’s Love Got to Do with It. The song was written by Graham Lyle and Terry Britten and recorded by Tina Turner in 1984 for her fifth studio album, Private Dancer. Released as a single by Capitol Records in May 1984, this song became the biggest selling single of her career. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2012, her third song to receive this honor. What’s Love Got to Do with It was ranked number 309 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list but was bumped to 134 in their 2021 updated list. The song has been described “three minutes and 48 seconds of pop perfection” by Mark Millan of The Daily Vault. Go ahead and have yourself a listen and you will hear what that pop perfection sounds like!\n\nAlbum Covers and Photo Inspiration\n\nAnd that’s all I have to share about this song. You are welcome to do your own research if you need more inspiration or if you are interested in learning more about the artist or the song. If you want to join us with your own outfit inspired by Tina Turner’s “What’s Love Got to Do with It”, we will be hosting a link party on our blogs on Monday, June 26, 2023, where you can share your post.
