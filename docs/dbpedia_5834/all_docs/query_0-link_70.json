        "text": "The news from Switzerland is bad. Tina Turner is dead.\n\nThe unstoppable singer breathed her last in Zurich on Wednesday, May 24, 2023. She was 83.\n\nPaying an early tribute to the Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll, fellow singer and songwriter Mick Jagger tweeted:\n\n“I’m so saddened by the passing of my wonderful friend Tina Turner. She was truly an enormously talented performer and singer. She was inspiring, warm, funny, and generous. She helped me so much when I was young and I will never forget her.”\n\nAs the news spread, President Joe Biden, former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton joined hundreds of thousands in paying rich tributes to the iconic superstar.\n\nCelebrating the incredible impact and memory of Tina Turner, Beyoncé said:\n\n“My Beloved Queen. I love you endlessly. I’m so grateful for your inspiration, and all the ways you have paved the way. You are strength and resilience. You are the epitome of power and passion.”\n\nBorn in a hospital in the segregated Tennessee, “like many of us, Tina’s story is simply a story initially of the force of circumstance and then, unlike most of us, of bold choice and, consequently, of freedom and happiness.”\n\nThe life of Anna Mae Bullock began on November 26, 1939, when she was born of Floyd and Zelma Bullock. Her mother would love her elder sister Ruby Alline Bullock more and this discrimination hurt Anna, and, the rest of her life, the scars stuck thick. Her parents separated in the early 1950s and her two grandmothers, maternal and paternal, raised her.\n\nThen a chance gave her break in Ike Turner’s Kings of Rhythm in 1957 and it gave her a new name in 1960 —Tina Turner—with a hit single “A Fool in Love”. Soon, with more successes, the duo, Ike and Tina, went on to become “one of the most formidable live acts in history”. The new name and fame led to some sporadic happy moments but soon segued into another seemingly never-ending torture in her life, culminating into 16 long abusive years of marital hell with Ike Turner.\n\nA journalist once said, “it seemed that, like most of us, her ‘Dantesque’ horoscope would never change and continue to remain the same for the rest of her life. But not for Tina.”\n\nOne ‘fine’ night in July 1976 in Dallas while on a musical tour, she walked out of the room of the hotel Statler Hilton, where Ike and she were staying, after a bloody fight. With just 36 cents and a Mobil credit card in the pocket, a battered face, and filthy and bloodstained clothes, she checked into, with the kindly assistance of the hotel manager, Ramada Inn, on the other side of the Interstate 30.\n\nWithin a month, she filed for divorce, which decree she got in 1978. Now, in debt, without a penny, without a roof over her head, with four kids, but choosing to cling to the surname Turner in her divorce settlement with Ike, thinking that it would be her ticket to success, Tina Turner at last was ‘free’. On the day of her divorce in 1978 she was 39, and a black woman, in the cutthroat competition of the music industry.\n\nWith extreme hard-work, some wise decisions, and help from unexpected quarters, Tina finally came into her own. One after the other solo musical hits came her way. So much so that David Bowie, the English Rock & Roll superstar became her fan.\n\nThereafter, she never looked back. In more than 50-years, she sold more than 200 million records and gave great performances all over the world. She got 12 Grammy Awards and was the first black artist and first female to be on the cover of Rolling Stone, which ranked her among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Hollywood Walk of Fame and St Louis Walk of Fame honoured her with stars. In 1991, she was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with Ike Turner. Her charm transcended her-self and she continued to inspire generations of stars: if there were no Tina, there wouldn’t be Beyoncé and Rihanna today.\n\nWhat sets her apart?\n\nSays Tina Turner in My Love Story: The Autobiography, ‘There’s always been an emotion in my voice because it reached back to the life I was living. Where there were tears on stage, it wasn’t Hollywood, it was real.’\n\nHappiness also came her way in 1986 when she met the German Erwin Bach, who came to pick her up at the airport for her European tour. She fell in love instantaneously and tied the knot first time in life out of her choice. Putting the ugly memories behind, she left America to live in Europe—renouncing her American citizenship and becoming a Swiss citizen.\n\nFame, name, wealth, and the hitherto elusive happiness, all came, but the years of trauma also now began taking their toll on her body: a stroke, rendering her numb in the lower body; vertigo, causing imbalance to the once ‘Dancing Queen’; renal failure (Bach gave her his kidney); PTSD, giving continuous nightmares like the veterans of wars, et al. To cap it all, her son Craig Turner was tragically found dead, aged 59, in 2018. A longtime practitioner of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, she fought all odds, physical and mental, and continued her odyssey with courage and fortitude, finally dying of long illness.\n\nLike “The poetry of earth”—Tina Turner—“is never dead”.\n\nThe author is a Retired DGP of Gujarat"
