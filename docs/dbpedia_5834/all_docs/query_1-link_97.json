The singer also has another son, 57-year-old Ronnie Turner.\n\nIn 2013 Tina tied the knot with long-term partner Erwin Bach.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, just hours before the sad news broke, Tina posed for pictures at the Giorgio Armani Prive Haute Couture Fall Winter 2018/2019 show in Paris.\n\nThe legendary singer, who is now a permanent Swiss resident, has lived with Erwin in Switzerland for many years and they were reported to have got engaged in April 2013.\n\nThey originally met in 1985 when Erwin worked as a record producer for music label EMI."
