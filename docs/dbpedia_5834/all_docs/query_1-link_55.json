        "text": "Ike History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nThe Viking settlers of ancient Scotland were the first to use the name Ike. It was a nickname for a hooked or crooked person. This nickname was originally derived from the Old Norse word haki which meant \"hook\" or \"something crooked.\" 1\n\nAlternatively, the name could have been a patronymic for \" the name of an ancestor as in 'the son of Hake.' \" 2\n\nAnd another source believes the name has the same origin as \"Haig and Haigh; from Haigh co. Lancaster or from Anglo-Saxon 'hagen,' a hay, hedge, meadow. \" 3\n\nEarly Origins of the Ike family\n\nThe surname Ike was first found in the county of Norfolk where Turkil Hako was listed there in Domesday Book 4. Later the Assize Rolls of Lincolnshire listed Leuiua filia Hacke as holding lands there in 1218 - a very rare entry for a female or \"daughter\" to hold lands at that time. Later again, Gilbert Hale was listed in the Feet of Fines of Staffordshire in 1257. 5\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 had the following entries as both a forename and surname: Hacca filius Pictavini; Peter filius Hake, Lincolnshire; Haco le Muner, Suffolk; and Hako Strek, Suffolk. 2\n\nEarly History of the Ike family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Ike research.

This is a result of the fact that there were no universal standards like dictionaries for scribes to judge by. The recorded spelling variations of the name Ike include Hake, Hakes, Hakke, Hacke and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Ike family\n\nNotable amongst the Clan from early times was Edward Hake, (fl. 1579), an English satirist who was patronized by the Earl of Leicester, known for his Newes out of Paules Churchyarde, A Trappe for Syr Monye, whi was first published in 1567. No copy of the 1567 edition is known; but the work was reprinted in 1579. \"From the dedication to the Earl of Leicester we learn that at this date Hake was under-steward...\n\nAnother 74 words (5 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Ike Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nIke migration to the United States +\n\nSettlers found farms all along the eastern part of what would become the United States and Canada.
