        "text": "TurnerOriginWord/nameMiddle EnglishDerivation\"one who works a lathe\"Region of originFrance, EnglandOther namesVariant form(s)Tuner, Turnor, Thurner, Tourner, Tournor[1]\n\nTurner is a common surname originating from Normandy, France, arriving in England after the Norman conquest with the earliest known records dated in the 12th century. It is the 28th-most common surname in the United Kingdom.[1][2]\n\nMost often it derives from an occupational name applied to a maker of small objects out of wood, metal or bone, by turning on a lathe (from Old French tornier, \"lathe\", ultimately from Latin).[3] In this sense it is analogous to the German surnames Drexel, Drechsler, Dressler, and Dreyer, Polish Tokarz, Finnish Sorvari, Russian Токарь (Tokarʼ) and related to English surnames such as Potter and Crocker.[4][5] Other occasional origins include Old French tournoieur, referring to someone either in charge of, or who participates in a tournament, and Turnhare, referring to a fast runner (one who can outrun a hare).[6]\n\nEarly recordings of this surname include Ralph le Turner in the late 12th century. The earliest recorded spelling of this family name dates from 1180 for \"Warner le Turnur\".[1]\n\nList of people with surname Turner\n\n[edit]\n\nCaptain Turner (disambiguation), various people\n\nCommon combinations of given name and surname \"Turner\"\n\n[edit]\n\nThese links lead to disambiguation pages\n\nLess common first names\n\n[edit]\n\nAdair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell (born 1955), British businessman and academic\n\nAfida Turner (born 1976), French media personality and singer\n\nAidan Turner (born 1983), Irish actor\n\nAugustus J.
