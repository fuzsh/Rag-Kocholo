        "text": "Each decade, the U.S. census bureau compiles the top last names in the United States. We have added origins and meanings to this list to give you a comprehensive collection of the top U.S. surnames. The background of the top surnames/last names in the United States are primarily English, Spanish, Celtic, and Asian. Surnames are more than mere identifiers; they are a reflection of the dynamic and ever-evolving story of America, where each name carries with it a unique story and contributes to the mosaic of the nation’s collective heritage.\n\nWhere do surnames come from?\n\nEnglish surnames can be occupational like Baker, Mason, and Thatcher. Or they can be patronymic, like Harrison (son of Harry), or geographical like describing the town or area where a family comes from. Spanish surnames can also be geographical like Medina (“From the City”), and patronymic like Perez (“Son of Pedro”).\n\nIn recent years, many parents are choosing last names as first names for their newborns. As the internet makes it easier to discover branches of our family trees, we can discover interesting surnames to honor our ancestry.\n\nWhat are the top surnames in the United States?\n\nIs your family name on the list?
