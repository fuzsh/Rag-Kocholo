The Concert for Bangladesh was the first major music benefit of its kind. Two sold out concerts at New York‚Äôs Madison Square Garden brought together an extraordinary assemblage of major artists collaborating for a common humanitarian goal ‚Äì setting the precedent that music could be used to serve a higher cause. #concertforbangladesh George Harrison said at the time: ‚ÄúThe musicians were great. I mean they completely put down their own egos to play together and to do something because the whole vibe of that concert was that it was something bigger than the lot of us.‚Äù Harrison organized the two groundbreaking concerts to direct global attention to the unfolding humanitarian crisis and raise funds for UNICEF‚Äôs work with the refugees. He assembled an all-star line-up of fellow artists including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, and, of course, Ravi Shankar. All net proceeds will go to the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF, continuing the legacy of supporting children in need around the world. ‚û°Ô∏è Stream the album here: https://lnkd.in/dFik-2qQ Read more: lnk.to/9WTnoiFz\n\nAs part of the be.queer LGBTIQ -plus- and allies at bertelsmann network, #BMG and sister companies RTL Group, Penguin Random House, Arvato, Arvato Systems, UFA, Riverty, TERRITORY, DK and Bertelsmann SE & Co.
