        "text": "well she can keep it if she wants. Its been her name for years. It also sounds better.\n\nlol @ the TT thing. She hasn't been through an ounce of what Tina has and is nowhere near as talented.\n\nShe'll change it if her managers tell her to.. as far as stories go, this one is a pretty non story. Are the Sun and her PR that desperate to keep her in the papers.\n\nAlso at least it isn't like Sheryl Gascgoine.\n\n0\n\nI know some people who reverted back to their maiden name but despite me not liking her, I still think that there's nothing wrong with sticking to Cole. And I'm not even talking about the fact that it sounds better or that Tweedy is associated with her assault. It's only that this has been her name for four years, that she has published a CD under this name and that she has been known on the X Factor as Cole. Reverting back to Tweedy would have seemed ridiculous and pathetic. It is only a name and it's not like Ashley has hit her or done worse things. And even in that case: It's not his name, it's also her name.\n\n0\n\nI don't honestly see what the fuss is about. Loads of women keep their married name when they divorce. Why? BECAUSE IT'S THEIR NAME!!! You don't borrow the name when you get married, it becomes yours. In the same way that you don't have to ask your ex's permission to keep it when you split up, because it's yours!\n\nAnd at the end of the day it might just be her 'stage name' as she already has an established career under the name 'Cole'. She can call herself what she likes on passports, bank accounts etc.\n\nI can totally understand some women wanting to change it back but if you don't want to - fine!\n\n0\n\nI think if you're no longer married to your husband, you shouldn't have his name. Just my opinion. I would never want to keep my married name if my husband cheated on me.\n\nCheryl's probably only doing it because she knows it sounds better. Obsessed with image - it's really vain. Though I agree that Cole sounds better than Tweedy. Hey, but if she changed it back to Tweedy her fans may wake up and realise that she's not some sort of goddess, just a chav that got lucky.\n\n0\n\nI think if you're no longer married to your husband, you shouldn't have his name. Just my opinion. I would never want to keep my married name if my husband cheated on me.\n\n.\n\nI know lots of older divorced women who keep theri married names. My mother in law for a start, she has been divorced over 20 years and never converted back to her maiden name. My friend's mum also did ths despite hating her ex-husband. It is very common.\n\nSaying that I never changed my name when I married so wouldn't be a problem for me.\n\n0\n\nI can understand keeping the name if kids are involved as keeping the same name as them might/would be important.\n\nMost people revert; Mel B/Mel G/Mel B, Gail Porter/Hipgrave/Porter\n\nWith Cheryl, I think it is more about her surname being Tweedy than anything - I would want to keep Cole too!\n\n0"
