        "text": "Beyoncé is, without a doubt, the female performer who has been most heavily influenced by Tina. From her high-energy choreography to her masterful performances onstage and her glamorous aesthetic, Queen Bey embodies the essence of Tina Turner.\n\nBeyoncé herself has been up front about how much the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll has influenced her image. As she put it during her 2005 tribute to Tina Turner at the Kennedy Center Awards, \"Every now and then, when I think of inspiration, I think of the two Tinas in my life — that’s my mother, Tina, and of course, the amazing Tina Turner.\" The duo even teamed up for a joint performance at the 2008 Grammys.\n\nAccording to Jennifer Lopez, she grew up listening to Tina Turner and considers her an inspiration. Which makes sense, considering that J.Lo is just as famous for her dancing as Tina is. Jennifer even posted a tribute to Tina on her Instagram page, wearing an outfit that was a throwback to a dress Tina wore in the '80s.\n\nBefore Tina was a mainstream success, Janis Joplin was her biggest fan. She would often go to see Ike & Tina Turner perform. Janis was greatly influenced by Tina's throaty belt and modeled her voice after her. When Tina heard Janis's new way of singing, she apparently said to her, \"Honey, you can’t continue to sing like that or you’ll have no voice.\"\n\nAfter seeing Tina in concert at a young age, Fergie was inspired to pursue a career in music herself. “I saw Tina Turner, second row, with my dad,” Fergie told Rolling Stone in 2006. “She pointed at me. That was big. I love how she was energetic and raw. Those early impressions tell you how things are supposed to be. I’ve taken a lot of that with me.”\n\nRihanna and Tina have a lot in common. Not only did they experience intimate partner abuse in the public eye, but they also rebuilt their careers to be stronger than ever when people doubted that. Not only that, but Rihanna has modeled her aesthetic after Tina's — especially when she sported a shaggy blonde mane in 2012.\n\nPink's career is what Tina's might have looked like if she came of age in the 21st century. Not only have both women shared the same manager (Roger Davies), but both women also fearlessly blended pop and rock to create immense mainstream success. They also built their stardom off the power of their vocals — something not all pop stars do.\n\nIf there's one thing Tina is, it's the patron saint to raspy-voiced singers. And who's more raspy-voiced than \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" singer Bonnie Tyler? \"Tina Turner was a big influence on me to become a singer,\" Bonnie has been quoted as saying. \"A role model and, in a way, she gave me back my confidence in choosing my material.\"\n\nThe Russian DJ and music producer says that Tina is her biggest musical influence. \"Nothing is embedded in my childhood memory as strongly as the unstoppable effervescence of Tina Turner, which she carried out on a pair of the strongest and most amazing legs in pop music,\" she told the Guardian in 2018. \"At times, it seems as if they are performing on their own.\""
