Ron DeSantis enters 2024 presidential race\n\nOn Wednesday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis officially announced his presidential bid to run for 2024. The announcement came just a day after South Carolina Senator Tim Scott launched his campaign, joining a GOP primary that already includes former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump.\n\nNYPD pleads for cell phone video before 2 boys disappeared in Harlem River\n\nThe NYPD made a public plea for anyone with cell video of the 14 minutes before two boys disappeared into the Harlem River on May 12 to come forward.\n\nAlfa Barrie, 11, and Garrett Warren, 13, died after falling into the river.\n\nFetty Wap sentenced to 6 years for drug conviction on Long Island\n\nFetty Wap was sentenced Wednesday to six years in prison for his role in a drug trafficking conspiracy that blanketed parts of Long Island and New Jersey in cocaine, heroin, fentanyl and crack.\n\nThe Paterson, New Jersey native, whose real name is William Junior Maxwell II apologized in court saying, \"I hope that the Long Island and New Jersey communities will forgive me for my actions and allow me to give back.\""
