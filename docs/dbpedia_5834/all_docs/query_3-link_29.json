        "text": "Crash bang wallop: Frank Turner has better reason than most to kickstart the new year with a euphoric punk-rock clatter. And that’s exactly what he did with brilliantly contrary and playfully snotty new track No Thank You For The Music, released on his 42nd birthday on 28th December. “It’s about the idea that it’s good to remind yourself every now and again that being part of underground culture means, among other things, being unpopular,” he explains cheerfully.\n\nSo, 2024 is a leap year. That means that this touring musicians’ touring musician – a road warrior who’s been out there, playing somewhere, since 1998 and who, after starting gigging when he was 16, didn’t go home for a decade – has one extra day to play with, and play on. And you know he’ll use it.\n\nMind you: Turner could have done with that calendrical wiggle-room when he was touring his last album, given that he celebrated 2022’s FTHC with an American jaunt that was epic even by his Stakhanovite standards: he and his band The Sleeping Souls did 50 states in 50 days.\n\n“The whole touring cycle for FTHC had a feeling of reinvigoration. A sense of coming out from under, both in terms of the pandemic and a rediscovery of the sense that what I do can be – or in fact should be – fun,” he says now of a long run lent wings by the Number One success of an album that joyously blasted a hardcore uproar (the clue was in the acronym)."
