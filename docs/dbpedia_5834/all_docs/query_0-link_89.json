        "text": "Tina Turner said her final farewell to her son Craig Turner today.\n\nHer eldest son turned a gun on himself earlier this month and soon after the 59 year old was found dead in his flat in Los Angeles.\n\nToday, Tina dropped a single red rose into the ocean as she shared her \"saddest moment as a mother\" with fans.\n\nWearing a dark grey suit jacket, the 78-year-old music legend turned her eyes to the waves as she scattered Craig's ashes off the coast of California.\n\n\"My saddest moment as a mother. On Thursday, July 19 2018, I said my final goodbye to my son, Craig Raymond Turner, when I gathered with family and friends to scatter his ashes off the coast of California,\" she tweeted.\n\n\"He was fifty-nine when he died so tragically, but he will always be my baby.\"\n\nTina, now 78, gave birth to Craig when she was 18 years old - before her marriage to Ike Turner.\n\nAfter they wed, Ike adopted her son with Craig taking his surname.\n\nBut Craig's biological father is Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill, who was a member of Ike's band.\n\nRaymond and Tina - then known as Little Ann - were in a relationship in 1957 when she was just 17 and a new backing singer for Ike Tuner’s band.\n\nRaymond died in 1996 from heart failure aged 62.\n\nTina was married to Ike between 1962 and 1978. The singer also has another son, 57-year-old Ronnie Turner.\n\nIn 2013 Tina tied the knot with long-term partner Erwin Bach.\n\nEarlier in the day that Craig died - just hours before the sad news broke - Tina posed for pictures at the Giorgio Armani Prive Haute Couture Fall Winter 2018/2019 show in Paris.\n\nThe legendary singer, who is now a permanent Swiss resident, has lived with Erwin in Switzerland for many years and they were reported to have got engaged in April 2013.\n\nThey originally met in 1985 when Erwin worked as a record producer for music label EMI."
