        "text": "Iconic vocalist Tina Turner has died at her home near Zurich, Switzerland after a long illness. The beloved “Queen of Rock ‘n’ Roll,” known for such hits as “The Best” and “What’s Love Got To Do With It” was 83. Turner’s death was confirmed on her official Facebook page in the statement shared below:\n\n“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Tina Turner. With her music and her boundless passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around the world and inspired the stars of tomorrow. Today we say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us all her greatest work: her music. All our heartfelt compassion goes out to her family. Tina, we will miss you dearly.”\n\nTina Turner’s British spokesperson noted the acclaimed singer died “peacefully” today, Wednesday, May 24. A private funeral service for close friends and family will be held soon.\n\nBorn Anna Mae Bullock in Brownsville, Tennessee on November 26, 1939, Turner came to fame as lead singer of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. She initially started with Ike Turner’s Kings of Rhythm in 1957 using the moniker Little Ann. In 1960, she began recording as Tina Turner with the release of “A Fool In Love,” a duet with Ike Turner. While she initially utilized the Turner surname to protect her spot in the Revue, Tina married Ike on November 26, 1962.\n\nIke & Tina Turner achieved modest success through 1965 constantly recording and touring the Chitlin’ Circuit. It was an appearance in the 1966 concert film The Big T.N.T. Show that led the pair to be signed by legendary producer Phil Spector to his Philles label. Their first single for the imprint, 1966’s “River Deep – Mountain High,” was a huge hit around the world though not in the U.S. However, it earned the duo a spot opening in the U.K. for The Rolling Stones in the fall of 1966. They achieved greater prominence at home when supporting The Stones U.S. Tour in 1969 as well as through multiple appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nAfter touring with The Rolling Stones, Ike & Tina Turner started infusing rock covers into their act. A cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary” was released in 1971 and peaked at the four-slot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the pair’s biggest hit. Additional hits followed over the next few years including “Ooh Poo Pah Doo,” “Up In Heah” and “Nutbush City Limits.”\n\nIke & Tina Turner explored spiritual music on the 1974 album The Gospel According To Ike & Tina, which scored them a Grammy nomination for Best Soul Gospel Performance. Behind the scenes, the pair was struggling as Ike was abusive towards Tina. The vocalist finally had enough and left Ike in 1976 with their divorce sealed in 1978.\n\nFollowing her split with Ike, Tina Turner focused on her solo career. She had one of rock’s greatest second acts with the advent of MTV. Tina Turner issued the album Private Dancer in 1984, which went platinum multiple times over and remains her best selling LP. The album contained “What’s Love Got To Do With It,” her first and only song to top the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, “What’s Love Got To Do With It” won the Grammy Award for Record Of The Year in 1985.\n\nBack on top, Tina Turner was a huge draw in concert throughout the late ’80s and into her retirement from the road two decades later. “Better Be Good To Me,” “The Best,” “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome),” “I Don’t Wanna Fight” and “GoldenEye” were among hits put out by Tina during the comeback stage of her career.\n\nTina Turner was also a talented actress. She played The Acid Queen in the 1975 film version of The Who’s Tommy. Turner went on to appear in such movies as Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and Last Action Hero. In 1993, the biopic What’s Love Got To Do With It — based on her 1986 autobiography I, Tina: My Life Story — was a massive success both commercially and criticially. Her story was also the basis of the Broadway musical Tina.\n\nTurner leaves behind a legacy as one of the best-selling recording artists of all-time. She was inducted with Ike into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 1991 and as a solo artist in 2021. Tina scored 12 Grammy Awards and retired from the road after embarking on Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour from October 1, 2008 through May 5, 2009. The trek was one of the top-grossing tours of the decade."
