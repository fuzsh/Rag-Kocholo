This surname may have become confused with Toner. In North America it is also very common among African Americans.2: English: occasionally perhaps a nickname from Middle English turn-hare a compound of Middle English tournen ‘to turn direct steer’ + hare ‘hare’ a name for someone in charge of the greyhounds in hare coursing or an exaggerated compliment for someone who could run fast. See also Turnbull.3: English: perhaps also from Middle English t(o)urn(e)our ‘jouster one who takes part in a tournament’ (Old French tornoieor tournoieur).4: South German (rarely Türner): occupational name for a guard in a tower or a topographic name from an agent derivative of Middle High German turn ‘tower’. Compare Thurner.5: South German (rarely Türner): habitational name for someone from any of various places called Thurn for example in Austria.

This surname is also found in France (Vosges Alsace and Lorraine).

Seaman 1781 in IGI (Gosport Hants) and with Ann Seyman 1824 in IGI (Shoreditch Middx). However the change of vowel and stress in the final syllable is difficult to explain. The 1232 given name might be a medieval copyist's error for Middle English Seman the personal name that lies behind Seaman.\n\nSober : 1: English (Durham): nickname for a person of moderate habits or a teetotaler from Middle English sobre ‘sober moderate temperate’.
