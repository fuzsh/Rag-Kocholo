        "text": "Legendary singer Tina Turner has died at the age of 83.\n\nThe Queen of Rock 'n' Roll died after a long illness at her home in Küsnacht near Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nTina's spokesman confirmed she died \"peacefully\" at home and added: \"With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model. With her music and her inexhaustible vitality, Tina Turner thrilled millions of fans and inspired many artists of subsequent generations.”\n\nHer official Instagram added: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Tina Turner. With her music and her boundless passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around the world and inspired the stars of tomorrow.\n\n\"Today we say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us all her greatest work: her music. All our heartfelt compassion goes out to her family. Tina, we will miss you dearly.\"\n\nRoger Davies, the singer’s manager of 30 years, paid tribute to the star, saying: “Tina was a unique and remarkable force of nature with her strength, incredible energy and immense talent.\n\n“From the first day I met her in 1980, she believed in herself completely when few others did at that time.\n\n“It was a privilege and an honour to have been a close friend as well as her manager for more than 30 years. I will miss her deeply.”\n\nRead More\n\nFollowing the news, music fans rushed to social media to pay tribute to the icon.\n\nNaomi Campbell commented: \"REST in Peace & Power THE QUEEN , LEGEND, ICON . There will never be another. Cherish my times with you.\"\n\nBernice King, the daughter of civil rights activist Martin Luther King, simply wrote, “Goodnight, Queen”.\n\nCanadian Bryan Adams, a friend of Tina’s, tweeted: \"My condolences to Erwin and Tina's family.\n\n\"I'll be forever grateful for the time we spent together on tour, in the studio and as friends.\n\n\"Thank you for being the inspiration to millions of people around the world for speaking your truth and giving us the gift of your voice. It's Only Love, and that's all.\"\n\nAlexandra Burke posted: \"RIP to the one and only Tina. There will never be anyone like you. truly the greatest!\"\n\nTributes not only came from the world of entertainment.\n\nThe White House also shared a statement as spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre described the singer's death as \"incredibly sad news\".\n\nShe said Turner's death was a massive loss to the communities who loved her and the music industry.\n\nEven NASA made an emotional post.\n\nThe space agency tweeted: “Simply the best. Music legend Tina Turner sparkled across the stage and into millions of hearts as the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll.\n\n“Her legacy will forever live among the stars.”\n\nTina suffered from illness for years and was diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and had a kidney transplant a year later.\n\nA private funeral ceremony will be held for close friends and family.\n\nTina was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26 in 1939 in Nutbush, Tennessee, USA.\n\nShe found fame in the late 1960s as the singer of the band Ike & Turner Revue but later went on to find fame as a solo artist.\n\nDuring a career spanning more than 60 years she sold more than 180 million albums and won 12 Grammy Awards.\n\nHer biggest hits include 'What's Love Got To Do With It', 'Private Dancer', 'I Don’t Wanna Lose You', 'Proud Mary' and 'The Best'.\n\nShe sold out stadiums on tour around the world for over three decades as one of the hardest working women in show business.\n\nThe natural-born performer joked earlier this year that she is as famous for her legs as her voice. She reportedly once insured her legs for £2 million.\n\nThe hitmaker explained how she only had her legs on show because it made it much easier to dance, but that it ultimately became part of her iconic style.\n\n“When I was younger I never felt confident about any part of my body, but with all the attention my legs received, I realised they must be OK!” she said.\n\nTurner retired from performing in 2009 following a 50th anniversary tour, during which she played 37 sold-out shows across North America, netting almost $50 million (£40.3 million).\n\nThe tour then moved on to Europe, where Turner played an additional 47 live dates - in total, the singer was seen by more than one million concert-goers.\n\nHer autobiography, I, Tina, was turned into the 1993 film What’s Love Got To Do With It, dramatising the mother-of-two’s famously turbulent relationship with Ike Turner.\n\nTurner was abandoned by her mother aged just 11 and years later she met fellow musician Ike, who she was with for 16 years until 1976.\n\nBut the relationship was abusive and Turner eventually left Ike and went on to forge a successful solo career.\n\nThe movie adaptation saw Angela Bassett nominated for an Oscar for her performance as Tina in the biopic.\n\nJust last year, Tina shared her sorrow with fans after the tragic death of her son Ronnie.\n\nSharing an emotional black and white portrait picture, Tina appeared with her eyes firmly shut as she paid tribute to her \"beloved\" child who was found dead outside his home in Los Angeles.\n\nHis death was later confirmed to be in relation to \"complications from colon cancer\" and \"atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\", according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office.\n\n\"Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son,\" she penned alongside the picture.\n\nIt was the latest heartbreak for Tina in recent years. In 2018, the singer lost her eldest son Craig, after he died by suicide.\n\nAs she scattered his ashes of the coast of California back in 2018, she wrote: \"My saddest moment as a mother.\n\n\"On Thursday, July 19 2018, I said my final goodbye to my son, Craig Raymond Turner, when I gathered with family and friends to scatter his ashes off the coast of California,\" she tweeted.\n\n\"He was fifty-nine when he died so tragically, but he will always be my baby.\"\n\nTina gave birth to Craig when she was 18 years old - before her marriage to Ike Turner. After they wed, Ike adopted her son with Craig taking his surname.\n\nBut Craig's biological father is Kings of Rhythm saxophonist Raymond Hill, who was a member of Ike's band.\n\nRaymond and Tina - then known as Little Ann - were in a relationship in 1957 when she was just 17 and a new backing singer for Ike Turner’s band. Raymond died in 1996 from heart failure aged 62.\n\nTina, widely referred to as the Queen of Rock and Roll, wed her long-time German beau, the music executive Erwin Bach, in a Swiss civil ceremony in 2013 and lived in Switzerland with him since 1994.\n\nIt was the second marriage for the music star, who was previously married to musician Ike from 1962 to 1978.\n\nIn her 1986 book, the singer narrated a harrowing story of abuse, including a broken nose during her marriage to Ike.\n\nHe died in December 2007, and Tina’s spokeswoman at the time was quoted as saying: “Tina is aware that Ike passed away earlier today. She has not had any contact with him in 35 years. No further comment will be made.”\n\nPreviously she opened up about her abusive relationship saying she had forgiven Ike.\n\nThe legendary singer spoke about her brutal union in a feature-length documentary in which she looked back on her career.\n\nWhile reflecting on her life and upbringing, she said: “It wasn’t a good life. The good did not balance the bad.\n\n“I had an abusive life - there’s no other way to tell the story. It’s a reality. It’s a truth. That’s what you’ve got, so you have to accept it.”\n\nShe told how after a childhood filled with cruelty and violence, it explained why she seemed to accept the mental and physical torture she put up with from Ike.\n\nDuring their marriage, she was reborn into global singing star Tina Turner, leaving behind her birth name of Anna Mae Bullock.\n\nFor three decades, she and Ike delivered a string of global hits, but away from the stage, it was the hits with his fists that caused long-lasting damage.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1976, after years of beatings and psychological torture, that she finally dared to leave.\n\nShe admitted it was because they had a son, Ronnie, and she adopted two of Ike’s children, Ike Jr and Michael, from his previous relationship that she had stayed for so long.\n\nTina said it would take her decades to overcome the relationship before she finally found peace with the life he subjected her to.\n\nThe Steamy Windows legend said: “For a long time, I did hate Ike, I have to say that. But then, after he died, I really realised that he was an ill person. He did get me started, and he was good to me in the beginning. So I have some good thoughts. Maybe it was a good thing that I met him that I don’t know.\n\n“It hurts to have to remember those times, but at a certain stage, forgiveness takes over; forgiving means not having to hold on.\n\n“It was letting go because it only hurts you. By not forgiving, you suffer because you think about it over and over. And for what?”\n\nTina would later find happiness with her second husband, Bach.\n\nShe met the German, who was 16 years her junior when the American visited Europe.\n\nThe singer was 46, and he was 30, although they didn’t marry until eight years ago.\n\nSpeaking of Erwin, she said: “He had the prettiest face. It was like, ‘Where did he come from?’ He was so good-looking. My heart went ba-bum. It means that a soul has met.\n\n“When he found out that I liked him, he came to America, and we were in Nashville, and I said to him, ‘When you come to LA, I want you to make love to me.\n\n“I thought that I could say that because I was a free woman, I didn’t have a boyfriend, I liked him.\n\n“There was nothing wrong with it; it was just sex. And he looked at me as if he didn’t believe what he was hearing.”\n\nOnly last month, Tina reflected on her life in British Vogue and revealed her ultimate secret to a “life well-lived.”\n\n“What does well-lived mean?” she asked. “My life has been full, but with lots of sad times that I now forgive and strive to forget.\n\n“Maybe that’s the answer: to keep moving forward, to let go and aim to fill your life with love.\n\n\"That is where I am now, and I am grateful.”"
