Turner: What does the surname Turner mean?

The last name Turner has English origins and is an occupational surname derived from the Old French word "torneour," which translates to "lathe" or "one who works with a lathe." A lathe is a tool that shapes wood, metal, or other material. Therefore, the surname Turner is typically associated with individuals who were originally wood-turners or metal-turners by profession. During medieval times, the work of a turner was considered highly skilled artisan labor. The surname symbolizes the craft and mastery of the bearer's ancestors in working with wood or metal lathes. It is worth noting that the use of surnames was not widely prevalent until the Norman Conquest in 1066, and occupational surnames like Turner became more common in the centuries following this event. Today, it is a widespread surname in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other English-speaking countries.
