        "text": "Overview\n\nKasson is a somewhat small city located in the state of Minnesota. With a population of 6,996 people and just one neighborhood, Kasson is the 127th largest community in Minnesota.\n\nOccupations and Workforce\n\nUnlike some cities, Kasson isn’t mainly white- or blue-collar. Instead, the most prevalent occupations for people in Kasson are a mix of both white- and blue-collar jobs. Overall, Kasson is a city of professionals, sales and office workers, and service providers. There are especially a lot of people living in Kasson who work in healthcare (14.41%), office and administrative support (11.07%), and teaching (9.18%).\n\nAlso of interest is that Kasson has more people living here who work in computers and math than 95% of the places in the US.\n\nA relatively large number of people in Kasson telecommute to their jobs. Overall, about 7.62% of the workforce works from home. While this may seem like a small number, as a fraction of the total workforce it ranks among the highest in the country. These workers are often telecommuters who work in knowledge-based, white-collar professions. For example, Silicon Valley has large numbers of people who telecommute. Other at-home workers may be self-employed people who operate small businesses out of their homes.\n\nSetting & Lifestyle\n\nKasson is a good choice for families with children because of several factors. Many other families with children live here, making it a place where both parents and children are more likely to develop social ties with other families. The city’s good public school district and large population of college-educated adults provide an environment conducive to academic success. Many people own their own single-family homes, providing areas for children to play and stability in the community. Finally, Kasson’s overall crime rate is lower than average for the country.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe population of Kasson is very well educated relative to most cities and towns in the nation, where the average community has 21.84% of its adult population holding a 4-year degree or higher: 36.91% of adults in Kasson have a bachelor's degree or even advanced degree.\n\nThe per capita income in Kasson in 2022 was $41,838, which is upper middle income relative to Minnesota and the nation. This equates to an annual income of $167,352 for a family of four. However, Kasson contains both very wealthy and poor people as well.\n\nThe people who call Kasson home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. The greatest number of Kasson residents report their race to be White, followed by Black or African-American. Important ancestries of people in Kasson include German, Norwegian, Irish, English, and Swedish.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Kasson is English. Other important languages spoken here include Spanish and Polish.\n\nThe Neighbors\n\nHow wealthy a neighborhood is, from very wealthy, to middle income, to low income is very formative with regard to the personality and character of a neighborhood. Equally important is the rate of people, particularly children, who live below the federal poverty line. In some wealthy gated communities, the areas immediately surrounding can have high rates of childhood poverty, which indicates other social issues. NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals both aspects of income and poverty for this neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the neighborhood in Kasson are upper-middle income, making it an above average income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis reveals that this neighborhood has a higher income than 69.3% of the neighborhoods in America. In addition, 0.8% of the children seventeen and under living in this neighborhood are living below the federal poverty line, which is a lower rate of childhood poverty than is found in 79.4% of America's neighborhoods.\n\nThe old saying \"you are what you eat\" is true. But it is also true that you are what you do for a living. The types of occupations your neighbors have shape their character, and together as a group, their collective occupations shape the culture of a place.\n\nIn the neighborhood, 42.1% of the working population is employed in executive, management, and professional occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is manufacturing and laborer occupations, with 25.6% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants (16.2%), and 14.7% in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is the shared learned behavior of peoples. Undeniably, different ethnicities and ancestries have different cultural traditions, and as a result, neighborhoods with concentrations of residents of one or another ethnicities or ancestries will express those cultures. It is what makes the North End in Boston so fun to visit for the Italian restaurants, bakeries, culture, and charm, and similarly, why people enjoy visiting Chinatown in San Francisco.\n\nIn the neighborhood in Kasson, MN, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as German (34.7%). There are also a number of people of Norwegian ancestry (19.5%), and residents who report Irish roots (11.5%), and some of the residents are also of Swedish ancestry (5.8%), along with some English ancestry residents (5.7%), among others.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nEven if your neighborhood is walkable, you may still have to drive to your place of work. Some neighborhoods are located where many can get to work in just a few minutes, while others are located such that most residents have a long and arduous commute. The greatest number of commuters in neighborhood spend between 15 and 30 minutes commuting one-way to work (48.0% of working residents), which is shorter than the time spent commuting to work for most Americans.\n\nHere most residents (78.5%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors to get to work (14.2%) . In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
