This also applies to nonresident riders. The focus of the DNR ATV Education Program is to provide an education course that reduces the rate of accidents, injuries, property damage, and fatalities, while at the same time promoting the development of environmental stewards by educating our students about environmental concerns, energy conservation and proper maintenance of ATVs, and promoting the practice of only riding in legal areas and with landowner permission. ATVCourse.com The DNR has collaborated with Fresh Air Educators to make an online certification offering available for the ATV Education Program. State-specific information regarding riding opportunities, laws, and regulations is a component of the course.\n\nThis is a managed course which features interactive exercises for students as well as narrated content to assist with different learning styles. The study guide is free to all users, as well as Chapter 1 of the course. In order to progress past Chapter 1, students will be required to register for the course. The course fee is $34.95, which includes the $5 DNR fee for the education certificate. Students must pass a chapter quiz in order to progress to the next chapter and must pass a final exam with 80% accuracy to earn their certificate. There is no riding component for this course.\n\nTopics covered by the course include, but are not limited to, parts of the machine and how they work, riding positions and when to use them, safety gear, personal responsibility, and conservation principles.\n\nUpon successful completion of the course, students will be able to download their ATV Education Certificate and be ready to hit the trails. Students must be 12 or older to earn their ATV education certificate through ATVCourse.com.\n\nThe Department may authorize the holding of organized special events at the designated OHV parks as defined in Iowa Code Chapter 321I.
