        "text": "Above, John Vogel displays one of his specialty party breads behind the counter of Vogels' European Bakery that he and his wife, Sami, operate in Dodge Center. At left, a welder at McNeilus Truck and Manufacturing Inc. is illuminated by his torch as he works on one of the ready-mix trucks the company produces. By ALETA CAPELLE Special to Successful Business f any single factor dominates the personality of Dodge Center's economy, it is, without question, industry.\n\nEmployees of the city's various industries commute to Dodge Center from a radius of 60 miles, says Jerry Fahning, a city councilman who works largely in economic development areas.\n\nDodge Center took a long, hard look at its personality just two years ago, in a survey that investigated the needs of the city's residents as well as commuters to the city.\n\nThe result showed affordable housing as one of the city's most pressing needs.\n\nIt was a survey the city took seriously.\n\nAs a result, the city established an economic development task force under the direct control of the City Council.\n\nOne outgrowth of the task force was an effort to bring the city Star City recognition. The city continues work on its one- and five-year plans and has begun to set up a development corporation. By late summer, the city should be prepared to apply for Star City designation, Fahning says.\n\nThe city also continues to work on solving its housing problem, both through seeking new housing and through updating the current housing stock.\n\nA community development director is already on city staff to work on housing development and business development.\n\nDodge Center is located 75 miles south of Minneapolis/St. Paul and about 20 miles west of Rochester. Situated on U.S. 14 and Minnesota 56, it has rail line service and a small municipal airport. It is 25 miles from Interstate 90 and 20 miles from Interstate 35.\n\nThe city's population was listed at 1,821 in a 1987 estimate.\n\nDodge Center is located, logically, in the center of Dodge County. Incorporated in 1872, the town grew along the railroad line while other communities died when the railroad went elsewhere.\n\nTo date, the picture is bright.\n\nFahning says five or six city businesses are currently working on expansion projects, though he declined to identify those businesses until plans are complete.\n\nThe expansions would include building expansions as well as added employees, he says.\n\nOther expansions are already under way in the city, he says.\n\nMcNeilus Truck and Manufacturing Inc., already a nationwide distributor in the ready-mix truck industry, has announced it is moving into the refuse packer industry.\n\nLate last year, the firm announced a $750,000 expansion set for next spring for garbage truck body manufacturing and for mounting them on truck chassis.\n\nA community profile of Dodge Center prepared a year ago by the Minnesota Department of Transportation listed 283 employees at McNeilus Truck. At that number, the firm was easily the city's largest employer.\n\nBut in December, the firm listed 385 workers, or 60 percent of the company's 635-member work force.\n\nThe firm's related operations include the manufacture of batching and mixing plants which can be moved and erected on construction sites. They are made at Dodge Center as well.\n\nThe firm currently is building a $1.2 million addition containing five moving floors for production and other advanced automation. Workers will mount the rotating mixers on truck frames at the 37,000-square-foot facility.\n\nThe city's second-largest employer is Owatonna Canning Co., with 90 employees.\n\nEnergy Economics, a natural gas meter repair and rebuilding firm, is another continuously growing firm, Fahning says. The firm is the city's third-largest employer with 65 workers.\n\nRoss Designers and Manufacture, the city's fourth-largest employer, with 60 employees, is a metal fabricator. The firm's primary market is supplying materials for McNeilus Truck and Manufacturing.\n\nMcNeilus Steel, a wholesale steel distributor, is the city's fifth-largest employer, with 52 employees.\n\nJerome Foods, a producer of turkey products, is the sixth-largest employer, with 40 workers.\n\nWINCOR, a commerical launderer, contracts with hospitals in a wide area, and is the city's seventh-largest employer, with 25 workers.\n\nDodge Center is unusual among small towns in that many local residents are not aware of the work performed at many local industries, Fahning says.\n\nLin's Used Iron, a firm that collects used iron and prepares it for other uses or sells it for other uses, is the city's eighth-largest employer, with 15 workers.\n\nThe local Cargill grain elevator and the Greenway Co-op fertilizer and farm chemical depot in town demonstrate the city's connection to agriculture. Center Supply also deals is agriculture equipment.\n\nMcNeilus Auto and Truck Parts is a vehicle parts recycling firm.\n\nDickie Equipment refurbishes used concrete mixer trucks, and represents another spin-off business of the city's largest industry, McNeilus Truck.\n\nSouthern Minnesota Machinery Sales provides commercial industrial and shop equipment.\n\nOutside the industrial sector, Dodge Center is home to Lowell's Auto, a used car sales firm.\n\nThe city also boasts nine churches, a relatively large number for its population.\n\nThe city is currently without a physician, but is in search of one, despite its proximity to a Mayo Clinic branch office just five miles away in Kasson. Vogl's European Bakery also calls Dodge Center home. The business supplies a variety of European baked goods to Rochester, and is looking at expanding into the Twin Cities market. The franchising of small bakeries elsewhere also is being studied.\n\nThe city also supports one grocery and three quick-stop businesses.\n\nJust outside the city is Fairview Nursing Home, a Dodge County facility.\n\nFairview is near the city's nine-hole golf course. Dodge Center also has a swimming pool."
