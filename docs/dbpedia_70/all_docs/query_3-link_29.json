For example, many types of non-ACA-compliant plans, such as short-term plans or association health plans as well as some student health plans, don’t cover maternity benefits. Some young adults staying on a parent’s health plan have not had their maternity care costs covered, because the ACA only mandates maternity care coverage for primary beneficiaries, not for their children. In addition, the ACA’s 10 essential health benefits that insurers must cover, which include maternity care, apply only to individual marketplace insurance plans and small-group plans — but not employers with more than 50 workers.\n\n31.
