        "text": "The Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit is a free online curriculum developed for use by educators and health professionals in providing tobacco-specific prevention education to middle and high school students. A set of lessons focused on e-cigarette/vaping prevention education specifically is called the Be Vape Free curriculum. The aims of this study are to determine: (1) whether the Be Vape Free curriculum is effective in increasing middle and high school students' resistance to using tobacco and in decreasing positive attitudes towards and intentions to use e-cigarettes; (2) whether the Curriculum is effective in changing middle and high school students' actual use of tobacco; and (3) Examine heterogenous treatment effects identifying groups that benefit the most and those who do not benefit at all from the intervention.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial. For more information, please contact David C Cash, (415) 250 - 7054.\n\nView full details\n\nTobacco companies have developed and implemented advertising and marketing efforts to reduce perceptions of harm associated with tobacco use, increase perceptions that tobacco is socially acceptable, and ultimately encourage and sustain use of tobacco.1-5 These marketing strategies have particularly focused on changing perceptions and increasing tobacco use among adolescents and young adults. There are gaps in the science concerning: 1) how perceptions influence tobacco use among adolescents and young adults, including changes in patterns of tobacco use from initiation to regular use, cessation, relapse, product switching, or dual use; 2) the role of pro- and anti-tobacco messages on perceptions of new tobacco products such as e-cigarettes, small cigars (little cigars and cigarillos), smokeless tobacco, snus, dissolvables, compressed tobacco, and emerging products that come on the market during the course of this research; and 3) the specific mechanisms by which marketing messages change tobacco-related perceptions, perceived acceptability of the product, and tobacco use behaviors. Prospective, longitudinal studies using frequent assessments and comprehensive measures of tobacco use, perceptions, and marketing are needed in order to provide specific scientific evidence about how marketing shapes decisions to use and stop using different tobacco products. This information will inform FDA regulation of the marketing and promotion of conventional, new and emerging tobacco products. This study fills gap in the science base by developing and testing a novel, comprehensive model concerning the relationships among pro- and anti-tobacco marketing messages, perceptions of tobacco risks and benefits, perceived product acceptability, and patterns of tobacco use among adolescents and young adults. We will address these gaps, and develop and test our model by accomplishing three specific aims. Using a longitudinal cohort design with a sample of 1,000 ninth graders followed through high school and another sample of 1,000 young adults followed for five years: Aim 1: Determine adolescents’ and young adults’ perceptions of risk for disease, addiction, and death; acceptability; and benefits of using conventional, new, and emerging tobacco products that come on the market during the course of this research. Aim 2: Determine the predictive relationships among perceptions of tobacco-related risks, benefits, and acceptability of tobacco products, and the onset, continuation, cessation, relapse, switching, and dual use of tobacco products. Aim 3: Identify contextual factors (exposure to pro-tobacco media, anti-tobacco media, warning labels, and smoking images in the media and on the Internet) that influence perceptions of risks, benefits, acceptability, and subsequent tobacco use.\n\nLocation\n\nCalifornia\n\nWith initial funding from TRDRP and CDE, and additional funding from CVS Health Foundation, we have developed The Tobacco Prevention Toolkit (tobaccopreventiontoolkit.stanford.edu). This Toolkit is free and available online, accessible to anyone who wishes to use it. The goals of the Toolkit are for middle and high school students to: (a) understand basic information about tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, hookah, cigars, and smokeless and the harm they cause; (b) gain awareness of strategies manufacturers of tobacco products employ to increase use among adolescents through flavors and deceptive and creative marketing strategies; and (c) gain skills to refuse experimentation and use of all tobacco products.\n\nThe Toolkit contains information on the history of and trends in tobacco use, immediate and long-term health risks of each tobacco product, effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction, the appeal of tobacco including flavors and marketing, poly tobacco use, and ways to resist using tobacco. The Toolkit has six modules containing a set of lessons with interactive activities ranging from the history of tobacco to industry manipulation tactics to resistance skills activities. The six modules are: (1) The Addiction Module, which focuses on biological, physiological, and psychological aspects and behavioral consequences of nicotine addiction. (2) The E-Cigarette/Vapes Module, which contains the latest information countering misperceptions about e-cigarettes, information on the anatomy of the various e-cigarette/vape products, advertising and marketing schemes to entice new and/or young users, flavors and ingredients, third-hand effects, and health outcomes. (3) The Hookah and Cigar/Cigarillo Module, which contains the latest information countering misperceptions about hookah and cigars, information on the anatomy of hookah and cigar products, advertising and marketing schemes to entice new and/or young users, flavors, ingredients, and health outcomes. (4) The Smokeless Tobacco Module, which contains the latest information countering misperceptions about smokeless tobacco, information on advertising and marketing schemes to entice new and/or young users, flavors, ingredients, and health outcomes. (5) The Positive Youth Development (PYD) Module, which provides a description of PYD, in-depth information about PYD strategies, sample activities, and resources. (6) The School Policies Module, which provides schools with tools necessary to develop, promote, and maintain a tobacco-free campus and resources to disseminate policies and procedures to parents/guardians and encourage them to participate in tobacco prevention efforts at home. The Toolkit also contains training materials, teacher crash courses, fact sheets, resources, and the latest information and activities countering common myths and misperceptions about different tobacco products. Activities were designed to deliver content and materials in an engaging and interactive manner. In addition to the activities, there are numerous exercises, PowerPoint presentations with teacher notes, and associated Kahoot! quizzes (Kahoot! is a free online game-based learning platform) throughout, so teachers can assess learning and retention.\n\nLocation\n\nCalifornia\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Co-use of tobacco and cannabis is common. However, few studies have examined the temporal sequencing through which individuals initiate co-use, and how these patterns vary across age. This study addresses this gap by examining the specific products and temporal sequencing through which adolescents, young adults, and adults initiate co-use of tobacco and cannabis. Among adolescents, young adults, and adults who co-used tobacco and cannabis in the past 30days, we examined (a) whether tobacco or cannabis was used first in their lifetime and (b) which specific tobacco or cannabis product (e.g., nicotine e-cigarettes, cannabis edibles) was the first used.METHODS: Data were from a cross-sectional national survey (N=6,131, 13-40years old) in which participants reported ever use, past-30-day-use, and order of use for 17 different tobacco and cannabis products. Results were analyzed overall and by age group (13-20; 21-24; 25-40).RESULTS: 38.4% of participants reported use of both tobacco and cannabis in the past 30days. Among these participants, 70.9% used tobacco first in their lifetime (66.6%<21; 71.7% 21-24; 76.6%>24). Approximately 60% of participants who initiated co-use with tobacco reported nicotine e-cigarettes as their first tobacco product (63.3%<21; 66.7% 21-24; 49.6%>24).CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants who used both tobacco and cannabis used tobacco first in their lifetime, and nicotine e-cigarettes were the most common form of tobacco initiation, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Findings emphasize the need for co-use prevention programs to target common products of initiation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2024.108105\n\nView details for PubMedID 39047653\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study identifies brands of nicotine pouches used in 2021, just before the surge in popularity of Zyn use.METHODS: We conducted a national, cross-sectional online survey of a general U.S. population (November to December 2021; N = 6131; age 13-40) via Qualtrics panels. Descriptive analyses and chi-squared tests (alpha = 0.05) were performed to assess ever and past-30-day use of nicotine pouch brands across adolescents (13-20), young adults (21-24), and adults (25-40), and to assess frequency of popular brands used among peers.RESULTS: The top brands ever used were Zyn (overall: 30.9%; adolescents: 31.9%; young adults: 33.2%; adults: 28.3%) and Lyft (overall: 28.8%; adolescents: 28.4%; young adults: 32.9%; adults: 26.3%), with no differences in ever-use by age group (p's > 0.095). The top brands used in the past-30-days were Zyn (overall: 26.4%; adolescents: 24.5%; young adults: 24.3%; adults: 30.0%) and Rush (overall: 24.2%; adolescents: 21.0%; young adults: 22.7%; adults: 28.6%). Adults (vs. adolescents, young adults) were more likely to report past-30-day use of Lyft (p = 0.004). Participants indicated Zyn (18.5%) and Lyft (18.2%) to be the most popular brands among peers.CONCLUSIONS: Even in 2021, Zyn was the most popular brand of nicotine pouches. Findings will help regulate and reduce impact of marketing of Zyn.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ypmed.2024.108068\n\nView details for PubMedID 39002807\n\nAbstract\n\nResearch is limited regarding adolescents' and young adults' (AYA) patterns, methods of, and reasons for cigarette or e-cigarette cessation. Further, while adults may try to use e-cigarettes to quit combustible cigarettes, little is known about how adults then quit e-cigarettes. This study utilizes a national, cross-sectional online survey of 6131 diverse participants aged 13-40 years to examine reasons for quitting e-cigarettes or cigarettes, quit methods, and quit attempt outcomes among AYAs and adults. In our sample, 3137 (51.2%) had ever used an e-cigarette, of whom 2310 (37.7%) were aged 13-24 years and 827 (13.5%) were 25-40 years old; 2387 (38.9%) had ever used a combustible cigarette (1440 [23.5%] were 13-24 years old and 947 [15.4%] were 25-40 years old). Among e-cigarette ever-users, 39.4% of 13-24-year-olds intended to quit in the next 6 months, and 36.9% had a serious plan for quitting in the next 30 days; 25.2% wanted to decrease the amount they used while 34.8% wanted to quit completely. Similar rates were found among e-cigarette ever users aged 25-40 years, as well as past 30-day e-cigarette users, cigarette ever-users, and past 30-day cigarette users across all ages. \"Cold turkey\" (41.0%) followed by \"tried to cut down slowly by vaping/smoking less often or fewer puffs\" (25.5%) was the most common quit method among e-cigarette ever-users and cigarette ever-users of all ages. Further study of effective tobacco cessation methods to help both AYAs and adults successfully quit nicotine, whether from cigarettes or e-cigarettes, is urgently needed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2023.107918\n\nView details for PubMedID 38070362\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite increasing use of cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and related health effects among youth, few studies have reported their effects on eyes.To examine the frequency and severity of ocular symptoms (ocular discomfort, pain, burning, itching, redness, dryness, glare, blurriness, strain, and headaches) in young e-cigarette and cigarette users.In an observational cross-sectional study, a survey conducted in May 6 to 14, 2020, asked participants about use (ever, past 30 days, and past 7 days) of e-cigarettes and cigarettes. The participants included US individuals aged 13 to 24 years.Associations between vision-related outcomes (general vision, severity/frequency of ocular symptoms) and tobacco use were analyzed using weighted multivariable logistic regressions, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, contact lens use, and other combustible use.There were 2168 never users, 2183 ever users, 1092 past 30-day users, and 919 past 7-day users of e-cigarettes; 55.9% of e-cigarette ever users also used cigarettes (dual users). Of the 4351 respondents, 63.8% identified as female, and mean (SD) age was 19.1 (2.9) years. Between 1.1% and 3.9% of ever dual users reported severe to very severe ocular symptoms; between 0.9% and 4.3% reported daily symptoms, which was higher than the proportion of symptoms in e-cigarette- or cigarette-only users. Past 7-day dual users had more severe itching (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.37; 95% CI, 1.36-4.13; P = .002), redness (AOR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.50-4.46; P = .001), dryness (AOR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.64-5.08; P < .001), glare (AOR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.50-4.35; P = .001), blurriness (AOR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.36-4.50; P = .003), headaches (AOR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.34-4.00; P = .003); and more frequent pain (AOR, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.09-5.68; P < .001), burning (AOR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.86-5.09; P < .001), and redness (AOR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.69-4.36; P < .001) than all other participants. Past 30-day dual users had more severe dryness (AOR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.61-4.36; P < .001) and more frequent pain (AOR, 3.33; 95% CI, 2.12-5.21; P < .001) than all other participants. Ever dual users experienced more severe dryness (AOR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.05-2.43; P = .03) and blurriness (AOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21-2.64; P = .003) and more frequent pain (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.13-2.53; P = .01) and blurriness (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.13-2.36; P = .009) than never users.In this cross-sectional US study, adolescents and young adult users of both e-cigarettes and cigarettes had a higher likelihood of experiencing severe and frequent ocular symptoms, with past 7-day users reporting more symptoms than past 30-day users or ever users. These findings provide additional reasons for users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes to reduce their tobacco use to possibly prevent or minimize ocular symptoms.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2023.3852\n\nView details for PubMedID 37651129\n\nAbstract\n\nUnited States Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to the US Food and Drug Administration, proposing a claim that switching to Copenhagen snuff fine cut from cigarettes reduces lung cancer risk. This claim could affect adolescents' smokeless tobacco perceptions and its use.Students (N = 592; mean age: 15.3 years; 46% male; 32% nonHispanic White; 8% smokeless tobacco ever-users) at seven California high schools were randomized within a survey to view a Copenhagen snuff image, either with or without the proposed reduced risk claim. Participants were then asked about the harm of smokeless tobacco and their willingness to try Copenhagen snuff if a friend offered. Postimage harm rating and willingness were compared between image groups overall, stratified by past 30-day tobacco use (87% of tobacco users were e-cigarette users), and adjusted for participant characteristics using multivariable regression.Participants who viewed the claim were less likely to perceive smokeless tobacco to cause \"a lot\" of harm (56% vs. 64%; p = .03), including after statistical adjustment (risk ratio [RR]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.94), and with a numerically stronger effect among tobacco users (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.86). The claim did not increase willingness overall (17% vs. 20%; p = .41) but did increase willingness among tobacco users (RR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.67).Brief exposure to a reduced-risk claim decreased adolescents' smokeless tobacco harm perceptions and increased willingness to try among tobacco users. The Food and Drug Administration order permitting this claim could increase some adolescents' susceptibility to smokeless tobacco, particularly those already using other tobacco products like e-cigarettes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2023.04.025\n\nView details for PubMedID 37294249\n\nAbstract\n\nEducational programs that address adolescents' misperceptions of e-cigarette harms and benefits and increase refusal skills play an important role in preventing initiation and use. This study evaluates changes in adolescents' e-cigarette perceptions, knowledge, refusal skills, and intentions to use following a real-world implementation of a school-based vaping-prevention curriculum. Study participants were 357 9th-12th grade students from one high school in Kentucky, United States who participated in a 60-minute vaping prevention curriculum from the Stanford REACH Lab's Tobacco Prevention Toolkit. Participants completed pre- and post-program assessments regarding their e-cigarette knowledge, perceptions, refusal skills, and intentions to use e-cigarettes. Matched paired t-tests and McNemar tests of paired proportions were applied to assess changes in study outcomes. Following the curriculum, participants indicated statistically significant changes on all 15 survey items related to e-cigarette perceptions (p's < 0.05). Participants demonstrated improved knowledge that e-cigarettes deliver nicotine in the form of an aerosol (p <.001), reported that if a friend offered them a vape it would be easier to say no (p <.001), and indicated they would be less likely to take the vape (p <.001) after receiving the curriculum. Other survey items related to knowledge, refusal skills, and intentions did not demonstrate significant changes. Overall, participation in a single session vaping-prevention curriculum was associated with several positive changes in high school students' e-cigarettes knowledge, perceptions, refusal skills, and intentions. Future evaluations should examine how such changes affect long-term trajectories of e-cigarette use.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.pmedr.2023.102184\n\nView details for PubMedID 37223577\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10201847\n\nAbstract\n\nIMPORTANCE: Oral nicotine products such as pouches, lozenges, tablets, gums, and toothpicks are gaining popularity, especially among adolescents and young adults, with increased marketing.OBJECTIVE: To estimate use patterns of oral nicotine products and likelihood of buying and liking products based on marketing, using a large group of adolescents, young adults, and adults.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional, online survey among U.S. participants (n=6,131; ages 13-40years) was conducted in November-December 2021.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ever, past-30-day, and past-7-day use, behaviors, and flavors of oral nicotine products. Liking marketing and likelihood of buying specific oral nicotine products (Zyn pouches and Lucy gum) from marketing.RESULTS: Our sample included 2,025 (33.0%) ever-users, 1,191 (19.4%) past-30-day users, and 998 (16.3%) past-7-day users of any oral nicotine product. Use patterns by age (in years): ever-users (<21: 816 (22.3%); 21-40: 1,209 (48.9%)); past-30-day users (<21: 458 (12.5%); 21-40: 733 (29.7%)); and past-7-day users (<21: 383 (10.5%); 21-40: 615 (24.9%)). Across products, 10-18% of participants reported using nicotine strength ranging from 6-10mg. Fruit, sweet/dessert, alcohol, coffee, and mint were the most used flavors. When shown marketing, ever-users liked and were likely to buy Zyn pouches compared to never users, and participants under 21years felt equally targeted by Lucy and Zyn marketing. Liking Zyn marketing even a little bit compared to not at all increased the likelihood of buying Zyn pouches across age groups. After observing marketing, participants<21years were more likely to buy Zyn if they perceived marketing to contain messages about good tasting flavors (AOR 1.43, 1.09-1.87; 0.009) and helping to feel comfortable in social situations (AOR 1.38, 1.02-1.87; 0.033), and were more likely to buy Lucy if they felt it could be used anywhere (AOR 1.57, 1.05-2.33; 0.026).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a foundation for estimating use, behaviors, flavors, and marketing influence of oral nicotine products in the US and globally. Adolescent and young adult use of oral nicotine products and likelihood of buying products when exposed to marketing highlights the need for expanded tobacco use surveillance, marketing regulations, and counter marketing and educational efforts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2023.107632\n\nView details for PubMedID 36731224\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: National surveillance assessing use of novel oral tobacco products (OTPs; nicotine pouches, lozenges, and gums not approved for tobacco cessation) among adolescents and young adults is limited. Objectives: To assess OTP behaviors in a sample of adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users, including use prevalence, dual/poly use with other products, and associated demographics. Methods: A national (United States) cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2021 among 2253 participants (ages 14-20; 65% female) who ever used e-cigarettes ≥3 times. Demographics, lifetime use, and past 30-day use of 10 tobacco and cannabis products, including novel and conventional (chew, moist snuff, or snus) OTPs was assessed. Analysis was descriptive, examining use prevalence (lifetime and past 30-day) of each product, including by demographics and other product use. Results: Nearly 44% reported ever using any OTP, with nicotine pouches being the most commonly ever used (29%) and used in the past month (11%). Novel OTP use was more common among older participants (18-20 years), male participants, and past 30-day users of e-cigarettes, combustible tobacco, and conventional oral tobacco. However, female participants and combustible tobacco non-users were over twice and 4-times as likely, respectively, to use novel OTPs than conventional OTPs. Nearly 73% of past 30-day conventional OTP users were past 30-day novel OTP users. Conclusion: Novel OTP use was prevalent among adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users. Compared to conventional OTPs, novel OTPs likely have greater appeal to females and combustible tobacco non-users. Action to restrict access and reduce interest in OTPs is needed to prevent use among this population.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1080/10826084.2022.2161314\n\nView details for PubMedID 36645845\n\nAbstract\n\nE-cigarettes, the most popular tobacco product among adolescents, vary widely in design and nicotine composition; thus, different devices may have different addictive potential. However, few studies examine levels of nicotine dependence across devices among adolescent and young adult (AYA) e-cigarette users. To assess the extent of nicotine dependence among US AYA (ages 13-24) by e-cigarette device type, we conducted a large, national, cross-sectional survey (n = 4351) and used the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) to assess levels of nicotine dependence among those who had used disposable, pod-based, and/or mods/other e-cigarette devices in the past 30 days. We also examined HONC scores among those who had used combustible cigarettes in the past 30 days, whether with or without using e-cigarettes. Patterns of nicotine dependence were comparable across those who had used a combustible cigarette and/or e-cigarette in the past 30 days, with 91.4% of combustible cigarette users, 80.7% of disposable e-cigarette users, 83.1% of pod-based e-cigarette users, and 82.5% of mods/other e-cigarette users showing signs of nicotine dependence, as measured by endorsing at least one HONC symptom. This pattern persisted when analyses were restricted to e-cigarette only users, with more than 70% of all e-cigarette only past-30-day users endorsing at least one HONC symptom, across all types of devices. A thorough understanding of the extent and presentation of nicotine dependence among AYA will help researchers, public health officials, and clinicians recognize and manage AYA nicotine dependence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/ijerph19105846\n\nView details for PubMedID 35627381\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Nonnicotine e-cigarettes contain chemicals, flavorants, and solvents that have known health harms and/or have not been proven safe for inhalation.Objective: To evaluate nonnicotine e-cigarette use patterns, including common flavors, brands, and ingredients.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included a convenience sample of US residents aged 13 to 40 years who completed an online survey in November and December 2021. Quota sampling was used for an equal proportion of participants aged 13 to 17 years, 18 to 20 years, and 21 to 40 years, balanced for sex, race, and ethnicity per the latest US Census.Main Outcomes and Measures: Nonnicotine e-cigarette use (ever, past 30- and past 7-day, number of times used, time taken to finish); co-use with nicotine e-cigarettes; age at first try; and flavors, brands, and ingredients used.Results: Overall, 6131 participants (mean [SD] age, 21.9 [6.8] years; range, 13-40 years; 3454 [56.3%] identifying as female) completed the survey (55.1% completion rate). Among all participants, 1590 (25.9%) had ever used a nonnicotine e-cigarette, 1021 (16.7%) used one in the past 30 days, and 760 (12.4%) used one in the past 7 days. By age group, 227 of 1630 participants aged 13 to 17 years (13.9%), 497 of 2033 participants aged 18 to 20 years (24.4%), 399 of 1041 participants aged 21 to 24 years (38.3%), and 467 of 1427 participants aged 25 to 40 years (32.7%) had ever used nonnicotine e-cigarettes. Among 1590 participants who had ever used a nonnicotine e-cigarette, 549 (34.5%) had used one more than 10 times; 1017 (63.9%) finished 1 nonnicotine e-cigarette in less than 1 week. Co-use of nonnicotine with nicotine e-cigarettes was reported by 1155 participants (18.8%), 1363 (22.2%) exclusively used nicotine e-cigarettes, and 431 (7.0%) exclusively used nonnicotine e-cigarettes. Most-used flavors were sweet, dessert, or candy (578 [36.3%]); fruit (532 [33.4%]); and mint or menthol (321 [20.2%]); similar flavor patterns were observed for the top 2 flavors among those who used nonnicotine e-cigarettes in the past 30 days, followed by combinations of coffee, alcohol, flower, plant, and mint or menthol flavors by age group. Participants most reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (587 [36.9%]), cannabidiol (537 [33.7%]), melatonin (438 [27.5%]), caffeine (428 [26.9%]), and essential oils (364 [22.9%]) in their nonnicotine e-cigarettes.Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of adolescents, young adults, and adults, a sizeable proportion reported having used nonnicotine e-cigarettes and co-using them with nicotine e-cigarettes. Surveillance studies should further assess nonnicotine e-cigarette use patterns and regulations, and prevention should be developed to address youth appeal, unsubstantiated health claims, and possible health harms.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.16194\n\nView details for PubMedID 35612852\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: As of September 2020, more than 300 state and local jurisdictions restrict the sales of flavored tobacco, with some including menthol.AIMS: o evaluate the impact of local ordinances restricting the sale of flavored tobacco, we surveyed Californians regarding policy support and perceived access to flavored tobacco.METHODS: In 2019, we conducted an online survey of 3,075 California youth and young adults recruited via social media, about half of whom lived in a policy jurisdiction. Logistic regressions assessed differences on propensity score-weighted outcomes, policy support, and perceived access.RESULTS: Most respondents indicated agreement with almost all policy support statements. Although policy respondents were less likely than rest-of-California respondents to report perceived difficulty in buying flavored cigars, flavored vape users in policy jurisdictions were more likely than those in the rest of California to report perceived difficulty in buying flavored e-liquid. Regardless of jurisdiction, certain priority subgroups were significantly more likely to report perceived difficulty in accessing flavored cigars, flavored vaping products, flavored e-liquid, and menthol cigarettes.DISCUSSION: With some exceptions, these findings demonstrate that among vape users in policy jurisdictions and priority subgroups, there is a higher likelihood of reporting perceived difficulty to access flavored tobacco products.CONCLUSIONS: Findings might be an early indication of shifts in social norms about flavored tobacco products in California, which could gain traction as local sales restriction ordinances proliferate throughout the state and a statewide flavored-tobacco sales restriction goes into effect.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/10901981211027520\n\nView details for PubMedID 34399591\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Stay-at-home policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt adolescents' substance use and physical activity.Objective: To compare adolescents' substance use and physical activity behaviors before and after stay-at-home restrictions.Design, Setting, and Participants: Ongoing prospective cohort study of tobacco use behaviors among ninth- and tenth-grade students enrolled at 8 public high schools in Northern California from March 2019 to February 2020 and followed up from September 2019 to September 2020. Race/ethnicity was self-classified from investigator-provided categories and collected owing to racial/ethnic differences in tobacco and substance use.Exposures: In California, a COVID-19 statewide stay-at-home order was imposed March 19, 2020. In this study, 521 six-month follow-up responses were completed before the order and 485 were completed after the order.Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of substance use (ie, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes, other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol) and physical activity (active ≥5 days/week) was compared at baseline and follow-up. A difference-in-difference approach was used to assess whether changes from baseline to 6-month follow-up varied if follow-up occurred after the stay-at-home order, adjusting for baseline behaviors and characteristics. All models were weighted for losses to follow-up using the inverse probability method. Weights were derived from a logistic regression model for having a follow-up response (dependent variable), as predicted by baseline characteristics and behaviors.Results: Of 1423 adolescents enrolled at baseline, 1006 completed 6-month follow-up (623 [62%] were female, and 492 [49%] were non-Hispanic White). e-Cigarette use declined from baseline to 6-month follow-up completed before the stay-at-home order (17.3% [89 of 515] to 11.3% [58 of 515]; McNemar chi2=13.54; exact P<.001) and 6-month follow-up completed after the stay-at-home order (19.9% [96 of 482] to 10.8% [52 of 482]; McNemar chi2=26.16; exact P<.001), but the extent of decline did not differ statistically between groups responding before vs after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.47-1.52; P=.58). In contrast, being physically active was unchanged from baseline if follow-up was before the order (53.7% [279 of 520] to 52.9% [275 of 520]; McNemar chi2=0.09; exact P=.82) but declined sharply from baseline if follow-up was after the order (54.0% [261 of 483] to 38.1% [184 of 483]; McNemar chi2=30.72; exact P<.001), indicating a pronounced difference in change from baseline after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69; P<.001). Overall in the cohort, reported use of other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol did not differ meaningfully before and after the order.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort, a reduction in e-cigarette use occurred independently of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but persistent cannabis and alcohol use suggest continued need for youth substance use prevention and cessation support. Declining physical activity during the pandemic is a health concern.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0541\n\nView details for PubMedID 33938922\n\nAbstract\n\nHealth behavior theorists and prevention researchers use a variety of measures of adolescent and young adult (AYA) risk and benefit perceptions to predict tobacco-use and marijuana-use behaviors. However, studies have not examined whether and how perception measures that ask about likelihood of more general outcomes such as \"harm\" versus ask about specific risk or benefit outcomes compare or whether they differentially predict AYA willingness to use if one of your best friends were to offer it and intentions to use in the next year; and if these measures have differential ability to predict actual use of tobacco and marijuana. We used data from a prospective cohort of California AYAs to create and test new scales to measure perceptions of specific health and social outcomes related to risks (e.g., smell bad) and benefits (e.g., look cool) related to tobacco and marijuana, and then addressed three questions: (1) Whether and how measures of perceptions of specific social and health risks and benefits (for our purposes \"specific measures\") and measures of perceived general harm are differentially associated with measures of willingness, social norms, and intentions to use? (2) Are specific versus general measures differentially associated with and predictive of tobacco and cannabis use behavior? (3) Are specific perceptions measures differentially predictive of behavior compared to measures of willingness, social norms, and behavioral intentions? Our results demonstrate that to better predict AYA tobacco and marijuana use, measures that address general outcomes, such as harmfulness, as well as willingness and behavioral intention should be used. We also found that measures of specific perceived risks (short-term, long-term, social) and benefits were unrelated and correlated differently with different products. For example, adolescents perceived both risks and benefits from using products like e-cigarettes, and perceived greater risk from smokeless tobacco compared to combustible cigarettes. These findings indicate that measures of specific perceived social and health outcomes can be useful to discern nuanced differences in motivation for using different substances. Study implications are important for survey dimension-reduction and assessing relationships among perceptions, motivations, and use of tobacco and marijuana products.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1057/s41599-021-00765-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 34435190\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8382238\n\nAbstract\n\nEmerging tobacco products, especially e-cigarettes, present a challenge for educators tasked with providing adolescent tobacco prevention education, as they typically have insufficient time to stay uptodate with the latest information on all tobacco products. To equip educators to implement e-cigarette and other prevention materials, we developed a novel, experiential training of the Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, comprising three components: (1) information session, (2) website navigation demonstration, and (3) hands-on curriculum demonstration allowing educators to present and practice Toolkit lessons.We evaluated this experiential training using a post-training survey, conducted with 486 participants (75% female) from 21 separate trainings. Surveys included demographic questions, training evaluation questions, and 4 open-ended questions administered via Qualtrics. Quantitative data were analyzed for frequencies via R statistical software. Qualitative data were analyzed using grounded theory.Training participants overwhelmingly agreed or strongly agreed that their knowledge of e-cigarettes increased as a result of the training; they were satisfied with the overall training; and they indicated intention to use the Toolkit in the future. Participants favored the enthusiastic presenters, the information about e-cigarettes, the website navigation, and the curriculum demonstration features of the training. Participants requested more time for various components of the training, more in-depth information about e-cigarettes, and more direction for Toolkit implementation.This novel, experiential training increased educator-reported knowledge of tobacco products and was overwhelmingly well-received, suggesting that such training can be important for effective dissemination of other e-cigarette prevention and intervention curricula.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106858\n\nView details for PubMedID 33640832\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Understanding patterns of e-cigarette use and access during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is important because e-cigarettes may put users at risk for more severe respiratory effects and other health problems.Objective: To examine whether underage youth and young adults who ever used e-cigarettes self-reported changes in access and use of e-cigarettes since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Design, Setting, and Participants: A national, cross-sectional online survey study was conducted from May 6 to May 14, 2020. This sample of 4351 participants aged 13 to 24 years across the US included 2167 e-cigarette ever-users. Quota sampling was used to balance for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 50% having ever used e-cigarettes.Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in e-cigarette use (increase, decrease, quit, no change, and switch to another product) and access to e-cigarettes (easier or harder, and change in point-of-purchase) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic began, reasons for change, number of times e-cigarettes were used, nicotine dependence, and sociodemographic data.Results: This study focused on 2167 e-cigarette ever-users among 4351 participants who completed the survey. Among 2167 e-cigarette users, a total of 1442 were younger than 21 years and 725 were aged 21 years or older; 1397 were female (64.5%) and 438 identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (20.2%). The survey completion rate was 40%. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, 1198 of 2125 e-cigarette users (56.4%) changed their use: 388 individuals (32.4%) quit, 422 individuals (35.3%) reduced the amount of nicotine, 211 individuals (17.6%) increased nicotine use, 94 individuals (7.8%) increased cannabis use, and 82 individuals (6.9%) switched to other products. Participants reported that not being able to go to vape shops and product unavailability were the reasons accessing e-cigarettes was difficult after the pandemic began. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, individuals reported purchasing from alternative retail stores (disposables, 150 of 632 [23.7%]; pod-based, 144 of 797 [18.1%]; and other e-cigarette, 125 of 560 [22.3%], ie, between 18.1% and 23.7%), purchasing online instead of retail (disposables, 115 of 632 [18.2%]; pod-based, 156 of 797 [19.6%]; and other e-cigarette, 111 of 560 [19.8%], ie, between 18.2% to 19.8%), and shifted to retail instead of online (disposables, 11 of 632 [1.7%]; pod-based, 17 of 797 [2.0%]; and other e-cigarette, 13 of 560 [2.3%], ie, between 1.7%-2.3%). Other individuals reported no change: from retail stores (disposables 262 of 632 [41.5%]; pod-based 344 of 797 [43.2%]; and other e-cigarette, 223 of 560 [39.8%], ie, between 39.8% and 43.2%) and online (disposables 94 of 632 [14.9%]; pod-based 136 of 797 [17.1%]; and other e-cigarette, 88 of 560 [15.8%], ie, between 14.9% and 17.1%). Underage youth reported e-cigarette deliveries from vape shops and/or dealers or friends who received such deliveries, and 63 of 229 (27.5%) self-reported accessing e-cigarettes without age verification. e-Cigarette users were 52% less likely to quit or reduce their use if they previously used e-cigarettes between 11 and 99 times (adjusted odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.78), 68% less likely to quit if they previously used e-cigarettes more than 100 times (adjusted odds ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.20-0.51), and 51% were less likely to quit if they were nicotine dependent (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.70).Conclusions and Relevance: During the COVID-19 pandemic, youth e-cigarette users reported changes in e-cigarette use, point-of-purchase, and ability to purchase e-cigarettes without age verification. The US Food and Drug Administration and local policy makers may find these data useful to inform policies to prevent e-cigarette sales to underage youth.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.27572\n\nView details for PubMedID 33270127\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVES: With the increasing popularity of electronic cigarettes and legalization of recreational marijuana, messaging from websites and social media is shaping product perceptions and use. Quantitative research on the aesthetic appeal of these advertisements from the adolescent and young adult perspective is lacking. We evaluated (1) how adolescents and young adults perceived tobacco and marijuana messaging online and through social media platforms and (2) interactive behaviors related to these messages.METHODS: We interviewed 24 participants from the Tobacco Perceptions Study, a longitudinal study of adolescents' and young adults' (aged 17-21) tobacco-related perceptions and tobacco use. We collected qualitative data from October 2017 through February 2018, through individual semi-structured interviews, on participants' experiences and interactions with online tobacco and marijuana advertisements and the advertisements' appeal. Two analysts recorded, transcribed, and coded interviews.RESULTS: Themes that emerged from the interviews focused on the direct appeal of online messaging to adolescents and young adults; the value of trusting the source; the role of general attitudes and personal decision-making related to using tobacco and/or marijuana; the appeal of messaging that includes colors, interesting packaging, and appealing flavors; and the preference of messages communicated by young people and influencers rather than by industry.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the need for increased regulation of social media messaging and marketing of tobacco and marijuana, with a particular focus on regulating social media, paid influencers, and marketing that appeals to adolescents and young adults. The findings also suggest the importance of prevention programs addressing the role of social media in influencing the use of tobacco and marijuana.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/0033354920947399\n\nView details for PubMedID 32791026\n\nAbstract\n\nThe rate of adolescent and young adult (AYA) e-cigarette usage has increased in recent years, possibly due to the introduction of sleek new e-cigarette devices such as JUUL. This study analyzed data from 400 California AYA to examine trends in e-cigarette usage by device type (disposables, large-size rechargeables, vape/hookah pens, JUUL/pod-based). Participants were asked about their ever, past 30-day, and past 7-day use of e-cigarettes; their usual e-cigarette device used; and co-use of devices in seven surveys administered approximately biannually from 2014 to 2018. During this time period, total e-cigarette ever-usage in our cohort increased linearly from 14.1% to 46.2% (ptrend<0.001). JUUL/pod-based e-cigarette ever-usage increased from 14.9% to 22.5% in just six months in 2018. Furthermore, a majority of new e-cigarette users at the time of the survey endorsed using JUUL/pod-based devices (58.3% in Wave 6, 73.0% in Wave 7). With newer device options, AYA were also increasingly less likely to endorse older models such as disposables (19.1% to 6.9% from 2014 to 2018, ptrend<0.01) and rechargeables (69.1% to 26.2% from 2014 to 2018, ptrend<0.001) as their usual e-cigarette device. Participants who used JUUL/pod-based only as their usual device were more likely to endorse using only JUUL/pod-based devices during follow-up survey (70%), and none switched to a new device completely. Overall, this study provides a snapshot of how AYA's e-cigarette preferences appear to respond to new devices entering the market.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106459\n\nView details for PubMedID 32388394\n\nAbstract\n\nThe aim of the study was to describe young adult use and perceptions of different brands of pod-based electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and compare with earlier types of non-pod-based e-cigarettes (e.g., mods and tanks).Data were collected from January to March 2019 and derive from the final wave of a cohort study recruited in 2013-2014 using a convenience sample from 10 large California high schools with racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations. A total of 445 participants completed an online survey (mean age = 20.1 years [SD = 1.66], 64.8% female [n = 278], 38.8% white [n = 161], 23.9% each for Asian and \"more than one race\" [n = 99], 13.5% other [n = 56], and 36.9% Hispanic [n = 160]). The main outcomes were description of and reasons to use pods, perceived nicotine content, and use patterns.Although <25% of participants reported smoking cigarettes and using non-pod-based e-cigarettes, >25% reported ever use of JUUL. Similarly, <33% of cigarette smokers and non-pod-based e-cigarette users reported use in the past 30 days, and >50% of JUUL ever users did. The most agreed upon reason (58%) for using pods was because they are \"easy to hide.\" About half of pod users \"do not know\" if they mix brands of e-juice and pods, the nicotine concentration in their e-juice cartridges, nor time to finish a cartridge. Of the 50% of participants who shared their pod, 23 (15%) did \"sometimes,\" 20 (13%) \"always,\" and 16 (11% each) \"about half the time\" or \"often.\" There was no consensus about how to refer to different brands of pods.Our findings indicate young adults harbor confusion about pod-based e-cigarettes, including nicotine content, usage patterns, and labeling, and that pod use is largely because of the ease with which they can \"stealth\" vape. The findings suggest needed regulation and education about these products.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.01.017\n\nView details for PubMedID 32192827\n\nAbstract\n\nPhilip Morris International (PMI) is seeking Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) authorisation to market IQOS as a modified risk tobacco product and to make marketing claims of reduced risk and reduced exposure. Such claims may be misunderstood by youth, thereby increasing their risk for tobacco initiation.To assess youth (mean age 19.3, SD=1.7) understanding and perceptions of PMI's proposed consumer marketing claims of reduced risk and reduced exposure, we embedded a randomised controlled experiment into a survey of 450 California youth (April to August 2018). Participants were randomised to see 'reduced exposure', 'reduced risk' or neither claim. Perceptions of IQOS-related health risks and general harm and understanding of the term 'switching completely' as used in PMI's proposed claims were compared.Mean expectancies to experience specific health risks did not differ by claim exposure. The reduced exposure group's perceptions of general harm did not differ from those of controls nor from the reduced risk group. The reduced risk group had the largest proportion who perceived IQOS as moderately/less harmful (n=78, 52%); controls the largest proportion perceiving IQOS as quite/extremely harmful (n=91, 63%). While 71% of the sample understood the term 'switch completely' correctly as used in the reduced risk (n=194, 71%) and reduced exposure (n=206, 72%) claims, more than 1 in 4 did not.FDA and other regulators must use caution when considering allowing claims of reduced risk or reduced exposure to appear on retail tobacco packaging. Youth misunderstand such claims, and misperceptions of harm are known to lead to tobacco-use initiation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055318\n\nView details for PubMedID 32029537\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Limited research among adolescents and young adults (AYA) has assessed tobacco and marijuana co-use in light of specific products. We examined the patterns of past 30-day co-use of tobacco and marijuana products, and the product-specific associations among past 30-day use of these substances.METHODS: Data from three school-based convenience samples of California AYA (aged 15-22) (Sample 1 = 3008; Sample 2 = 1419; Sample 3 = 466) were collected during 2016-2017. Proportions of past 30-day co-use of tobacco (e-cigarettes, cigarettes, hookah, cigars) and marijuana (combustible, vaporized, edible, blunt) were estimated. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations between use of each tobacco and marijuana product for individual samples, then the pooled analysis calculated combined ORs.RESULTS: In the three samples, 7.3-11.3% of participants reported past 30-day co-use. Combinations of e-cigarettes or cigarettes and combustible marijuana were the most common co-use patterns. Past 30-day use of e-cigarettes or cigarettes (vs. non-use) increased the odds of past 30-day use of all marijuana products [e-cigarettes: ORs (95%CI) ranging from 2.5 (1.7, 3.2) for edible marijuana to 4.0 (2.8, 5.2) for combustible marijuana; cigarettes: from 3.2 (2.1, 4.2) for vaporized marijuana to 5.5 (3.8, 7.3) for combustible marijuana]. Past 30-day use of hookah or cigars was positively associated with past 30-day use of three of four marijuana products, except for hookah and vaporized marijuana, and for cigars and combustible marijuana.CONCLUSIONS: Given various co-use patterns and significant associations among tobacco and marijuana products, interventions targeting AYA should address co-use across the full spectrum of specific products for both substances.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2019.106053\n\nView details for PubMedID 31357072\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Use of alternative tobacco products (ATPs) such as electronic cigarettes, chewing tobacco, pipes, cigars, cigarillos, little cigars, and hookah is rapidly increasing. Although marketing restrictions exist for cigarettes, marketing of ATPs is not yet fully regulated, and studies have not assessed the association between ownership of ATP promotional materials and subsequent ATP or cigarette initiation among adolescents and young adults.Objective: To estimate the association between marketing receptivity measured at baseline and ATP and any tobacco initiation 1 year later, including cigarettes, among adolescents and young adults.Design, Setting, and Participants: Longitudinal cohort study of adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 19 years recruited at high schools in California from July 2014 to October 2015, with follow-up 1 year later. Data were analyzed from January to March 2018.Exposures: Ownership of ATP-specific promotional material and ownership of any tobacco promotional materials (eg, samples, coupons, branded caps, t-shirts, or posters) assessed in wave 1.Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were (1) ATP initiation and (2) either ATP or cigarette initiation in wave 2.Results: Of 757 participants (mean [SD] age at wave 1, 16.1 [1.1] years; 481 [63.5%] female; 166 [21.9%] Asian or Pacific Islander, 202 [26.7%] white, and 276 [36.4%] Latino), 129 (17.0%) initiated ATP use and 141 (18.6%) initiated ATP or cigarette use 1 year later. In unadjusted models, wave 2 ATP initiation was found to be significantly associated with wave 1 ownership of ATP promotional materials (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.26-3.97). After adjustment for wave 1 demographic covariates, the association between ownership of ATP promotional material and ATP initiation 1 year later yielded similar results (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.16-3.91). Results of models assessing a combined outcome variable of either ATP or cigarette ever use were not statistically significant.Conclusions and Relevance: Ownership of ATP promotional materials was associated with subsequent initiation of ATPs. The results of this study are consistent with the suggestion that current marketing restrictions for cigarettes, including restrictions of the distribution of samples, coupons, and other promotional material, should extend to ATPs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.4006\n\nView details for PubMedID 31099874\n\nAbstract\n\nThe rise of noncigarette, alternative tobacco product (ATP) use among adolescents may be due in part to an increase in retail availability of ATPs. We examined whether proximity and density of tobacco retailers near students' homes are associated with a higher likelihood of initiating ATP use over time.Using data from 728 adolescents (aged 13-19 years at baseline) residing in 191 different neighborhoods and attending 10 different California high schools, longitudinal multilevel and cross-classified random effect models evaluated individual-level, neighborhood-level, and school-level risk factors for ATP initiation after 1 year. Covariates were obtained from the American Community Survey and the California Department of Education.The sample was predominantly female (63.5%) and was racially and ethnically diverse. Approximately one third of participants (32.5%) reported ever ATP use at baseline, with 106 (14.5%) initiating ATP use within 1 year. The mean number of tobacco retailers per square mile within a tract was 5.66 (standard deviation = 6.3), and the average distance from each participant's residence to the nearest tobacco retailer was .61 miles (standard deviation = .4). Living in neighborhoods with greater tobacco retailer density at baseline was associated with higher odds of ATP initiation (odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.07-2.12), controlling for individual and school factors.Tobacco retailers clustered in students' home neighborhood may be an environmental influence on adolescents' ATP use. Policy efforts to reduce adolescent ATP use should aim to reduce the density of tobacco retailers and limit the proximity of tobacco retailers near adolescents' homes and schools.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.09.004\n\nView details for PubMedID 31784411\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Beginning in the 1960s in the USA and globally since 1998, tobacco companies have beenaggressively promoting heated tobacco products (HTP). In 2016, Philip Morris International (PMI) applied to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking authorisation to market their IQOS HTP system and flavoured 'HeatSticks' in the USA as a modified-risk tobacco product (MRTP).METHODS: We systematically evaluated the publicly available data PMI submitted to FDA in its MRTP application to determine whether PMI's IQOS product meets the US Tobacco Control Act's standard for MRTP claims. We examined whether PMI provided sufficient data showing tobacco users will not initiate with IQOS, that youth will not misperceive the MRTP-related claims being made concerning IQOS, and how youth perceive health risks associated with IQOS.RESULTS: PMI's own studies failed to provide evidence that youth, including non-users and former users, will not find IQOS appealing, will not initiate use of IQOS and will not perceive these products as risk-free. Further, PMI did not refer to independent studies conducted among adolescents which could influence their conclusions. Finally, their studies suffered from design and implementation flaws and cannot be relied on to support the proffered claims.CONCLUSION: PMI's own data and available evidence from scientific studies conducted independent of the tobacco industry regarding how novel tobacco products are currently being marketed suggest that introduction of IQOS will result in adolescent and young adult non-users initiating tobacco use with IQOS and could also increase poly-use of IQOS along with other tobacco products.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30352843\n\nAbstract\n\nElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are the most commonly used tobacco product among adolescents and young adults, and the new pod-based e-cigarette devices may put adolescents and young adults at increased risk for polytobacco use and nicotine dependence.To build an evidence base for perceptions of risk from and use of pod-based e-cigarettes among adolescents and young adults.In a survey study, a cross-sectional analysis was performed of data collected from April 6 to June 20, 2018, from 445 California adolescents and young adults as part of an ongoing prospective cohort study designed to measure the use and perceptions of tobacco products.Use of pod-based e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cigarettes.Ever use, past 7-day use, and past 30-day use and co-use of pod-based e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cigarettes; use of flavors and nicotine in pod-based e-cigarettes and e-cigarettes; and associated perceptions of risks, benefits, and nicotine dependence.Among 445 adolescents and young adults (280 females, 140 males, 6 transgender individuals, and 19 missing data; mean [SD] age, 19.3 [1.7] years) who completed wave 6 of the ongoing prospective cohort study, ever use information was provided by 437 respondents, of which 68 (15.6%) reported use of pod-based e-cigarettes, 133 (30.4%) reported use of e-cigarettes, and 106 (24.3%) reported use of cigarettes. The mean (SD) number of days that pod-based e-cigarettes were used in the past 7 days was 1.5 (2.4) and in the past 30 days was 6.7 (10.0). The mean (SD) number of days that other e-cigarettes were used in the past 7 days was 0.8 (1.8) and in the past 30 days was 3.2 (7.4). The mean (SD) number of days that cigarettes were used in the past 7 days was 0.7 (1.8) and in the past 30 days was 3.0 (7.6). Among ever users of pod-based e-cigarettes, 18 (26.5%) reported their first e-liquid was flavored menthol or mint and 19 (27.9%) reported fruit (vs 13 [9.8%] and 50 [37.6%] for other e-cigarettes). The mean perceived chance of experiencing social risks and short-term and long-term health risks from the use of either pod-based e-cigarettes or other e-cigarettes was 40% and did not differ statistically by e-cigarette type. Among 34 adolescents and young adults reporting any loss of autonomy from nicotine, there was no difference in mean (SD) Hooked On Nicotine Checklist scores between those using pod-based e-cigarettes (2.59 [3.14]) and other e-cigarettes (2.32 [2.55]).Use by adolescents and young adults of newer types of e-cigarettes such as pod-based systems is increasing rapidly, and adolescents and young adults report corresponding misperceptions and lack of knowledge about these products. Rapid innovation by e-cigarette manufacturers suggests that public health and prevention efforts appear to be needed to include messages targeting components common to all current and emerging e-cigarette products to increase knowledge and decrease misperceptions, with the goal to try to ultimately reduce e-cigarette use among adolescents and young adults.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.3535\n\nView details for PubMedID 30646249\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6324423\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: E-cigarettes are the most popular tobacco product among adolescents and young adults (\"AYA\") and are available in many flavors. The e-cigarette industry argues that flavors are not meant to appeal to youth, yet no study has asked youth what age group they think ads for flavored e-liquids are targeting. We asked AYA which age group they thought ads for flavored e-liquids targeted.METHODS: In 2016 as part of a larger survey, a random sample of 255 youth from across California (62.4% female, mean age = 17.5, SD = 1.7) viewed eight ads, presented in randomized order, for fruit-, dessert-, alcohol-, and coffee-flavored e-liquids and indicated the age group they thought the ads targeted: younger, same age, a little older, or much older than them. Population means and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using bootstrapping (100,000 replicate samples).RESULTS: Most participants (93.7%) indicated the cupcake man flavor ad targeted an audience of people younger than they. Over half felt ads for smoothy (68.2%), cherry (63.9%), vanilla cupcake (58%), and caramel cappuccino (50.4%) targeted their age and for no flavor ad did most feel the primary target age group was much older.CONCLUSIONS: Youth believe ads for flavored e-liquids target individuals about their age, not older adults. Findings support the need to regulate flavored e-liquids and associated ads to reduce youth appeal, which ultimately could reduce youth use of e-cigarettes.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30314868\n\nAbstract\n\nMeasuring perceptions associated with e-cigarette use can provide valuable information to help explain why youth and adults initiate and continue to use e-cigarettes. However, given the complexity of e-cigarette devices and their continuing evolution, measures of perceptions of this product have varied greatly. Our goal, as members of the working group on e-cigarette measurement within the Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science (TCORS) network, is to provide guidance to researchers developing surveys concerning e-cigarette perceptions. We surveyed the 14 TCORS sites and received and reviewed 371 e-cigarette perception items from seven sites. We categorized the items based on types of perceptions asked, and identified measurement approaches that could enhance data validity and approaches that researchers may consider avoiding. The committee provides suggestions in four areas: (1) perceptions of benefits, (2) harm perceptions, (3) addiction perceptions, and (4) perceptions of social norms. Across these 4 areas, the most appropriate way to assess e-cigarette perceptions depends largely on study aims. The type and number of items used to examine e-cigarette perceptions will also vary depending on respondents' e-cigarette experience (i.e., user vs. non-user), level of experience (e.g., experimental vs. established), type of e-cigarette device (e.g., cig-a-like, mod), and age. Continuous formative work is critical to adequately capture perceptions in response to the rapidly changing e-cigarette landscape. Most important, it is imperative to consider the unique perceptual aspects of e-cigarettes, building on the conventional cigarette literature as appropriate, but not relying on existing conventional cigarette perception items without adjustment.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29175027\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5807230\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: While evidence suggests positive opinions of smokers are associated with tobacco use, research exploring adolescents' opinions of e-cigarette users is nascent. We hypothesized that adolescents harbor positive opinions of e-cigarette users, and that these opinions will be more positive among adolescents willing to try or who have used e-cigarettes.METHODS: Participants were 578 U.S. adolescents (ages 14 to 20) recruited from ten California schools. An online survey assessed their attitudes toward and opinions of adolescents who use e-cigarettes in 2015-2016. Analyses examined whether these variables were associated with willingness to try and use (ever vs. never) of e-cigarettes.RESULTS: The majority (61%) of participants had negative overall opinions toward adolescent e-cigarette users. Few participants ascribed positive traits (i.e., sexy, cool, clean, smart, and healthy) to e-cigarette users. Participants who were willing to try or had used e-cigarettes endorsed positive traits more than those unwilling to try and never-users (all p < .01). Participants sometimes endorsed negative traits (i.e., unattractive, trashy, immature, disgusting, and inconsiderate) to describe e-cigarette users. Unwilling and never-users viewed negative traits as more descriptive of e-cigarette users than willing or ever-users (all p < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents generally had somewhat negative opinions of other adolescents who use e-cigarettes. Building on adolescents' negativity toward adolescent e-cigarette users may be a productive direction for prevention efforts, and clinicians can play an important role by keeping apprised of the products their adolescent patients are using and providing information on health effects to support negative opinions or dissuade formation of more positive ones.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30403731\n\nAbstract\n\nE-cigarette use has dramatically increased. While studies have examined adolescents' attitudes towards smoking, few have extended this research to adolescents' attitudes towards e-cigarettes. The goal of this study was to examine adolescents' attitudes regarding e-cigarette ingredients, safety, addictive properties, social norms, accessibility, price, and regulation; and determine whether attitudes differ by past cigarette/e-cigarette use. Participants were 786 9th and 12th graders from California (63.21% females; mean age=16.10years [SD=1.6]; 26.61% White, 21.98% Asian/Pacific Islander, 29.82% Hispanic, and 21.59% other). Results indicated that 19.05% of participants believed smoke from e-cigarettes is water; 23.03% believed e-cigarettes aren't a tobacco product; 40.36% considered e-cigarettes to be for cessation, and 43.13% felt they were safer than cigarettes. Participants felt it was more acceptable to use e-cigarettes indoors and outdoors compared to cigarettes (p<0.0001), 23.13% felt raising e-cigarette taxes is a bad idea, 63.95% thought e-cigarettes were easier to get than cigarettes, 54.42% felt e-cigarettes cost too much, 64.33% felt the age for buying e-cigarettes should be raised, and 64.37% favored e-cigarette regulation. Adolescents who used e-cigarettes and/or cigarettes had significantly more favorable e-cigarette attitudes than non-users. This study indicates that adolescents are aware of some of the risks of e-cigarettes, although many harbor misperceptions and hold more favorable attitudes towards e-cigarettes than cigarettes. Of concern is the relationship between favorable e-cigarette attitudes and use. Findings suggest the need to provide adolescents with correct information about e-cigarette ingredients, risks, and the insufficient evidence of their role in cigarette cessation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.10.019\n\nView details for PubMedID 27773711\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite consistent declines in rates of cigarette use among adolescents in the last five years, rates of marijuana use have remained constant, with marijuana being the most widely used illegal drug among adolescents. More work is needed to understand how social norms, perceived risks and benefits, and social media messaging impact use of marijuana. This study compared perceptions and social norms related to marijuana, blunts and cigarettes. Additionally, we assessed how perceptions related to social norms, risks and benefits, and exposure to pro- versus anti-marijuana messaging is related to use. Participants were 786 adolescents from Southern and Northern California (36.7% male, 63.21% females; mean age=16.1years; SD=1.6). Participants came from diverse ethnic backgrounds, with 207 (26.61%) White, 171 (21.98%) Asian/Pacific Islander, 232 (29.82%) Hispanic, and 168 (21.59%) other. Results indicated that marijuana and blunts were consistently perceived as more socially acceptable and less risky than cigarettes (p<0.01). Participants who reported that their friends used marijuana had a 27% greater odds of using marijuana themselves. Further, seeing messages about the good things or benefits of marijuana use was associated with a 6% greater odds of use [OR 1.06 (CI 1.00, 1.12)]. This study's findings offer a number of important public health implications, particularly as states move towards legalization of marijuana for recreational use. As this occurs, states need to take adolescents' perceptions of risks, benefits, social norms, and peer influences into account as they implement strategies to reduce youth use of marijuana and blunts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ypmed.2016.10.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 27746339\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study assesses perceptions of overall harm, short-term health and social risks, long-term health risks, and benefits associated with various tobacco products including conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, chew, and hookah. This study also assesses whether and how perceptions differ by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and previous experience with tobacco.A total of 722 high school students completed an online survey, answering questions about their use and perceptions of a variety of tobacco products. Differences in perceptions across products were assessed using a generalized estimation equation with an exchangeable correlation structure.Adolescents rated the various tobacco products as conferring significantly different levels of risks and benefits. Generally, adolescents rated cigarettes as most risky, followed by cigars and chew, with hookah and e-cigarettes rated as least risky. Adolescents rated hookah followed by cigarettes and e-cigarettes as most likely to make them look cool or fit in and cigars and chew as least likely to confer these benefits. There were interaction effects by age and use, with older adolescents and those with tobacco experience holding lower perceptions of risk. There were no significant interaction effects by race/ethnicity or gender.Given the significant differences in adolescents' perceptions of risks and benefits of using different tobacco products and research showing the predictive relationship between perceptions and behavior, there is a need for comprehensive messaging that discusses risks of all tobacco products, particularly hookah and e-cigarettes. There is also a need to address perceived benefits of tobacco products, especially hookah and e-cigarettes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.01.012\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000375158600010\n\nView details for PubMedID 27107909\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite evidence that adolescents become addicted to nicotine even after limited use, adolescents believe they can experiment with or smoke cigarettes for a few years and easily quit. The goal of this study was to examine adolescents' understanding of the definition and process of nicotine addiction using a mixed-methods approach.Method A total of 367 adolescents with and without smoking experience rated the perceived risk for addiction, still being a smoker in 5 years, and ability to quit smoking. A subsample of adolescents (N= 41) were interviewed about their conceptualization and understanding of nicotine addiction. Within-participants analyses of variance were conducted to assess differences in perceptions of addiction across the three scenarios; thematic analyses of interviews were conducted to assess adolescents' understanding of addiction.Results Adolescents rated their perceived risk for addiction, still being a smoker in 5 years, and ability to quit as significantly different from one another for three different scenarios (F= 7.81, 47.78, and 70.27, respectively;p< .001). Seven themes describing how youth conceptualize and understand addiction emerged from the interview data, including skepticism and uncertainty about addiction, how smoking makes a person feel, and family and friends' experiences.While adolescents have received the message that cigarettes are addictive, they are uncertain regarding the definition of addiction and have not recognized that addiction means experiencing difficulty quitting and continuing to smoke longer than expected. Findings suggest the need for comprehensive messaging regarding nicotine addiction in educational, clinical, and intervention settings and for product warning messages aimed at reducing and preventing tobacco use.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/1090198115598985\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000373699600006\n\nView details for PubMedID 26293459\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough rates of adolescent cigarette use have remained constant or decreased, rates of marijuana and e-cigarette use are rising. Knowledge and perceptions of risks and benefits of tobacco products impact adolescents' decisions to use these products. However, little is known regarding adolescents' knowledge and perceptions of risks of e-cigarettes and marijuana nor how these perceptions are formed. This study uses qualitative techniques to assess and compare adolescents' perceptions of the risks and benefits of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and marijuana.Twenty-four adolescents (nine females and 15 males) from Northern California participated in six small-group discussions. Adolescents were asked what good or bad things might happen from using these products. To assess how perceptions and knowledge of risks and benefits were formed, participants were asked where and from whom they had learned about these products.Adolescents described negative consequences of cigarette use but were much less sure regarding risks of marijuana and e-cigarette use. Conversely, they described few benefits of cigarettes but described a number of benefits of e-cigarette and marijuana use. Adolescents described learning about these products from the media, from family and friends, and from the school environment.Adolescents have learned from multiple sources about risks of using cigarettes, but they receive much less and often incorrect information regarding marijuana and e-cigarettes, likely resulting in their positive and often ambivalent perceptions of marijuana and e-cigarettes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.04.002\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000358262900011\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4515157\n\nAbstract\n\nLittle research has examined the extent to which adolescents directly attempt to influence friends' smoking. This study examines adolescents' reported actions to promote or deter friends' smoking, and whether actions vary by adolescents' smoking experience.Data were collected between 2001 and 2004 at four time points across the 9th and 10th grades from an ethnically diverse school-based sample (N = 395; 53% female).Deterrence of smoking was reported by a greater percentage of adolescents than was promotion of smoking, both among those who had ever smoked and never smoked. By the end of the study, over 45% of ever smokers and less than 5% of never smokers had promoted smoking among friends. In contrast, over 70% of ever smokers and roughly 40% of never smokers had deterred smoking. Among adolescents who had ever smoked, positive consequences of smoking by fall of 10th grade predicted attempts to promote smoking by the end of 10th grade (OR = 4.37, p < .05). To a lesser extent, negative consequences of smoking predicted attempts to deter smoking (OR = 2.60, p < .08). These effects were independent of the opposite type of smoking consequences, level of personal smoking experience, having close friends who smoked, prior attempts to influence friends' behavior, and smoker's gender.Models of peer influence should account for both positive and negative influence of adolescents on friends' health behavior. Adolescents who have engaged in risk-taking and experienced negative consequences may be a resource in designing and delivering interventions; future research should evaluate their ability to change friends' behavior.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2013.06.022\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000327481300016\n\nView details for PubMedID 23945053\n\nAbstract\n\nAdolescents' decisions to have sex may be based on a priori boundaries placed on sex. This study addresses: (1) to what extent adolescents set vaginal sexual boundaries; (2) the types of sexual boundaries most and least likely to be endorsed; and (3) to what extent sexual boundaries vary by sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual experience.A cross-sectional study of 518 students attending 10th grade. Survey measures queried about demographics, ever having sex, and existence of sexual boundaries (e.g., being in love, having an attractive partner) that must be in place before having vaginal sex.The most frequently endorsed boundaries were maturity, commitment, trust, love, and marriage. These boundaries were more frequently endorsed than having a safer-sex method. Compared with females, males were more likely to choose boundaries based on partner attractiveness (p < .001) and avoiding trouble (p < .04). Compared with Asians and Pacific Islanders, whites were more likely to endorse wanting to be a certain age to have sex (p < .01 and p < .05, respectively); Asians and Pacific Islanders were more likely to choose sexual boundaries based on marriage (p's < .05). Adolescents who were sexually experienced were more likely than inexperienced adolescents to endorse boundaries related to relationship characteristics and partner attractiveness (OR = 2.5), and less likely to endorse boundaries related to feeling mature (OR = .34) and waiting until marriage (OR = .34).Identifying adolescents' sexual boundaries should help healthcare professionals better understand under what circumstances adolescents are more or less likely to have sex; and this information should ultimately inform the development of new interventions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2013.01.004\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000320768200014\n\nView details for PubMedID 23481297\n\nAbstract\n\nStudies have demonstrated that clinical- and research-based definitions of who a smoker is and what constitutes smoking often differ from adolescent-derived definitions, which can be problematic for effective intervention and prevention efforts. We investigated how adolescents define different smoker types (nonsmoker, smoker, regular smoker, addicted smoker, heavy smoker, experimental smoker, casual smoker, and social smoker) using multiple indicators of smoking behaviors, including frequency, amount, place, and length of time cigarette smoking, and whether differences exist by smoking experience.Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze data from a cohort of adolescents (N = 372) in northern California.We found differences in how adolescents characterized smoker types based on their own smoking experience. Ever-smokers tended to have a greater flexibility in determining what constituted nonsmoking and heavy smoking, while never-smokers had much narrower definitions. Results also indicated that adolescents may mistakenly associate nicotine addiction with a high frequency and amount of cigarette use as 74.3% characterized an addicted smoker as having smoked for a few years or more. In addition, there was a considerable amount of overlap in definitions between different smoker types, particularly among the smoker-regular smoker, addicted smoker-heavy smoker, and casual smoker-social smoker pairs.Health communication strategies for youth smoking prevention need to address the wide variability and overlap in how adolescents define different smoker types. Greater attention should be directed to understanding the nuances of how adolescents define smoking in order to maximize the effectiveness of youth-centered smoking prevention and cessation messages.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/ntr/ntr169\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000296352300013\n\nView details for PubMedID 21849408\n\nAbstract\n\nPrevious studies suggest that earlier cigarette smoking initiation in adolescence predicts greater cigarette consumption later in adolescence or adulthood. Results from these studies have been used to inform interventions for adolescent smoking. However, previous studies suffer from several important methodological limitations. The objective of the present study was to address these limitations by longitudinally and prospectively examining whether and how age of initiation of smoking among adolescents predicts cigarette consumption by age 16 or 17. Participants completed an in-class survey every 6 months for 2-3 school years. Participants included 395 adolescents (Mean age=14 years at baseline; 53.2% female) from two public high schools in Northern California (Schools A and B) who completed self-report measures of smoking initiation, number of friends who smoke, and number of whole cigarettes smoked by the final survey time point. Adolescents who were older when they first smoked one whole cigarette were 5.3 to 14.6 times more likely in School A and 2.9 to 4.3 times more likely in School B to have smoked a greater number of cigarettes by age 16 or 17. Results suggested that earlier smoking initiation may not lead to heavier cigarette consumption later in time, as has been previously shown. There may be a period of heightened vulnerability in mid- or late adolescence where smoking experimentation is more likely to lead to greater cigarette consumption. Targeting prevention efforts to adolescents aged 14 to 17 years may further reduce smoking initiation among youth, thus limiting subsequent smoking-related morbidity and mortality in adulthood.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11121-011-0209-6\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000293708700003\n\nView details for PubMedID 21384136\n\nAbstract\n\nTo directly test whether perceptions of second-hand smoke risks deter adolescent smoking initiation.A longitudinal survey design was utilized in this study. Baseline surveys measuring perceptions of tobacco-related risks and smoking behaviors were administered to 395 high school students, with three follow-up assessments every 6 months.Perceptions of personal second-hand smoke risks and parental second-hand smoke risks significantly deterred adolescent smoking initiation. Perceptions of personal second-hand smoke risks reduced the odds of smoking by a factor of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.42-0.94) for each quartile increase in perceptions of personal second-hand smoke risks. Adolescents who provided the highest estimates of risks for personal second-hand smoke were 0.25 as likely to smoke as adolescents who provided the lowest estimates of risk. Perceptions of parental second-hand smoke risks reduced the odds of smoking by a factor of 0.64 (95% CI=0.43-0.93) for each quartile increase. Adolescents who perceived the highest estimates of risks associated with parental second-hand smoke were 0.26 as likely to smoke in the future compared to adolescents who provided the lowest estimates of risk. These effects are over three times as large as a smoking peer's influence on a nonsmoking adolescents' risk for smoking initiation, odds ratio [OR]=1.18 (95% CI=1.02-1.35).Adolescent perceptions of risks of second-hand smoke are strongly associated with smoking initiation. Encouraging adolescents to express their objections to second-hand smoke, as well as encouraging parents to create smoke-free homes, may be powerful tobacco control strategies against adolescent smoking.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.04.022\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000272460300013\n\nView details for PubMedID 19931835\n\nAbstract\n\nIntertemporal tradeoffs characterize the decision to use drugs: pleasure now traded off against the possibility of pain later. Traditional approaches have examined whether individuals use drugs because they either seek immediate benefit or fail to appreciate long-term risk. We asked whether risk taking might also result from failing to appreciate benefits. We refer to this as risk in the benefits (RIBs), an understanding that one's first drug experience can be so good, that a person may not want (or be able) to stop, putting him/her on a path that leads directly to addiction.In total, 304 participants, 160 adolescents and 144 young adults, participated in a longitudinal study on marijuana use and other risky health behaviors.The failure to perceive the RIBs of marijuana use led to increased risk taking 1 year later within 3 different health behaviors: alcohol, tobacco, and sexual risk-taking. Greater appreciation of RIBs predicted significantly less future risk taking over-and-above all the traditional cognitive and behavioral predictors, and RIBs were the only significant cognitive predictor when all were included in 1 model. RIBs also partially mediated the relationship between past and future risk taking, over and above the strongest predictors of risk taking.Failing to appreciate the impact of short-term benefits within the context of long-term risk increased future risk taking. Interventions that enhance the salience of RIBs may represent a new approach to reducing the likelihood that individuals will take risks with their health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/0272989X08323918\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000265110000004\n\nView details for PubMedID 18836059\n\nAbstract\n\nThe present study examined whether adolescents' initial consequences of sexual activity differ according to type of sexual activity and gender.Surveys were administered to 618 adolescents recruited from 2 public high schools in the autumn of ninth grade (2002) and at 6-month intervals until the spring of tenth grade (2004). Analyses were limited to the 275 adolescents (44%) who reported engaging in oral sex and/or vaginal sex at any assessment. Participants were 14 years of age at study entry, 56% female, and of diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds.In comparison with adolescents who engaged in oral sex and/or vaginal sex, adolescents who engaged only in oral sex were less likely to report experiencing a pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection, feeling guilty or used, having their relationship become worse, and getting into trouble with their parents as a result of sex. Adolescents who engaged only in oral sex were also less likely to report experiencing pleasure, feeling good about themselves, and having their relationship become better as a result of sex. Boys were more likely than girls to report feeling good about themselves, experiencing popularity, and experiencing a pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection as a result of sex, whereas girls were more likely than boys to report feeling bad about themselves and feeling used.Adolescents experience a range of social and emotional consequences after having sex. Our findings have implications for clinical practice and public health campaigns targeted toward youth.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1542/peds.2006-1727\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000243942000001\n\nView details for PubMedID 17272611\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite studies indicating that a significant proportion of adolescents are having oral sex, the focus of most empirical studies and intervention efforts concerning adolescent sexuality have focused on vaginal intercourse. This narrow focus has created a void in our understanding of adolescents' perceptions of oral sex. This study is the first to investigate adolescents' perceptions of the health, social, and emotional consequences associated with having oral sex as compared with vaginal sex, as well as whether adolescents view oral sex as more acceptable and more prevalent than vaginal sex.Participants were 580 ethnically diverse ninth-grade adolescents (mean age: 14.54; 58% female) who participated in a longitudinal study on the relationship between risk and benefit perceptions and sexual activity. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that inquired about their sexual experiences and percent chance of experiencing outcomes from, attitudes toward, and perceived prevalence of oral versus vaginal sex among adolescents.More study participants reported having had oral sex (19.6%) than vaginal sex (13.5%), and more participants intended to have oral sex in the next 6 months (31.5%) than vaginal sex (26.3%). Adolescents evaluated oral sex as significantly less risky than vaginal sex on health, social, and emotional consequences. Adolescents also believed that oral sex is more acceptable than vaginal sex for adolescents their own age in both dating and nondating situations, oral sex is less of a threat to their values and beliefs, and more of their peers will have oral sex than vaginal sex in the near future.Given that adolescents perceive oral sex as less risky, more prevalent, and more acceptable than vaginal sex, it stands to reason that adolescents are more likely to engage in oral sex. It is important that health care providers and others who work with youths recognize adolescents' views about oral sex and broaden their clinical preventive services to include screening, counseling, and education about oral sex.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1542/peds.2004-2108\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000228107900022\n\nView details for PubMedID 15805354\n\nAbstract\n\nLight cigarettes have been marketed by the tobacco industry as being a healthier smoking choice, a safe alternative to cessation, and a first step toward quitting smoking altogether. Research, however, has failed to show a reduction in smoking-related health risks, an increase in rates of smoking cessation, a decrease in the amount of carbon monoxide or tar released, or a reduction in the rates of cardiovascular disease or lung cancer associated with light cigarette use, compared with regular cigarette use. Nevertheless, more than one-half of adolescent smokers in the United States smoke light cigarettes. This study is the first to investigate adolescents' perception of the risks associated with smoking light cigarettes, as well as adolescents' attitudes and knowledge about the delivery of tar and nicotine, health risks, social effects, addiction potential, and ease of cessation with light cigarettes, compared with regular cigarettes.Participants were 267 adolescents (mean age: 14.0 years) who completed a self-administered questionnaire during class time. After reading scenarios in which they imagined that they smoked regular or light cigarettes, participants estimated the chances that they would personally experience 7 smoking-related health risks and 3 addiction risks. Participants also responded to 14 items concerning their attitudes and knowledge about light cigarettes versus regular cigarettes.Participants thought that they would be significantly less likely to get lung cancer, have a heart attack, die from a smoking-related disease, get a bad cough, have trouble breathing, and get wrinkles when smoking light cigarettes, compared with regular cigarettes, for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, when participants were asked how long it would take to become addicted to the 2 cigarette types, they thought it would take significantly longer to become addicted to light versus regular cigarettes. Adolescents also thought that their chances of being able to quit smoking were higher with light versus regular cigarettes. Similarly, when participants were asked how easy it would be to quit smoking the 2 cigarette types, they thought it would be significantly easier for them to quit smoking light cigarettes than regular cigarettes. Adolescents agreed or strongly agreed that regular cigarettes deliver more tar than light cigarettes and that light cigarettes deliver less nicotine than regular cigarettes.Overall, the results of this study show that adolescents hold misperceptions in both their personal risk estimates and their general attitudes about the health risks, addictive properties, and ease of cessation associated with light cigarettes. With a variety of light and ultralight cigarettes on the market, adolescents are led to think that there is a progression of safety levels to choose from when deciding which cigarettes to smoke. This illusion of control over health outcomes contributes to an underestimation of risks associated with smoking light cigarettes and supports these misperceptions. These results are of concern, given evidence suggesting that, if adolescents think they are less vulnerable to smoking-related health risks (ie, lung cancer), then they are more likely to initiate smoking. Furthermore, there is evidence that adolescents are not fully aware of the addictive nature of cigarettes and therefore think that they can experiment with smoking during adolescence without becoming addicted or experiencing any health consequences. The data presented here support concerns regarding smoking addiction; adolescents might be even more inclined to smoke light cigarettes to delay addiction. Without correct information about light cigarettes, adolescents are unable to make informed decisions about their smoking behaviors. The findings presented here strongly suggest that health care practitioners need to talk to their adolescent clients not only about the overall risks of smoking but also about the specific risks associated with smoking light cigarettes and other tobacco varieties, including the potential for addiction and long-term health consequences. Information shared with adolescents about light cigarettes, both individually by health care practitioners and at the population level via counter-advertising campaigns, may be successful in changing current misperceptions, and ultimately light cigarette smoking patterns, among youth.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1542/peds.2004-0893\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000224242200008\n\nView details for PubMedID 15466070\n\nAbstract\n\nExplanations of adolescent smoking often make reference to adolescents' beliefs that they are invulnerable to harm. However, empirical examination of whether adolescents do acknowledge risks. Further, few studies have considered perceived benefits in adolescents' behavioral decisions. This study examined perceived smoking-related physical and social risks and benefits between adolescents who have vs. have not smoked and do vs. do not intend to smoke.Three hundred and ninety-five students (mean age = 14.0) completed a survey concerning their smoking experiences, intentions, and perceived risks and benefits of smoking.Adolescent smokers and those who intend to smoke estimated their chance of experiencing a smoking-related negative outcome as less likely than did nonsmokers and non-intenders. Smokers and intenders also reported the chance of addiction as less likely than did others. In contrast, adolescent smokers and intenders perceived the chance of experiencing a smoking-related benefit as more likely than did nonsmokers and non-intenders.The data suggest that rather than solely focusing on health risks as a way to deter adolescent smoking, the role of perceived social risks and benefits in adolescents' smoking may be an additional critical focus for intervention. In addition, efforts should be made to increase adolescents' awareness of the addictive nature of cigarettes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ypmed.2004.02.017\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000223760000016\n\nView details for PubMedID 15313096\n\nAbstract\n\nTo determine whether pediatricians in managed care settings adhere to national guidelines concerning the provision of clinical preventive services.Surveys were mailed between September 1996 and April 1997 to all pediatricians practicing in a California group-model health maintenance organization. The survey asked pediatricians about their screening and education practices on 34 recommended services and the actions taken with adolescent patients who have engaged in risk behavior.The response rate was 66.2% (N = 366). Pediatricians, on average, screened 92% of their adolescent patients for immunization status and blood pressure; 85% for school performance; 60% to 80% for obesity, sexual intercourse, cigarette use, alcohol use, drug use, and seat belt and helmet use; 30% to 47% for access to handguns, suicide, eating disorders, depression, and driving after drinking alcohol; fewer than 20% for use of smokeless tobacco, sexual orientation, sexual and physical abuse, and riding a bike or swimming after drinking alcohol; and 26% to 41% for close friends' engagement in risk behavior. Pediatricians' assessment and education with adolescent patients who screened positive for risk behavior was particularly low. Female physicians, physicians who saw a greater proportion of older adolescents, and recent medical school graduates were more likely to provide preventive services.Pediatricians in this health maintenance organization provide preventive services to adolescent patients at rates below recommendations but at rates greater than physicians in other practice settings. Improvement is especially needed in the areas that contribute most to adolescent mortality and for patients who screen positive for a risk behavior.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000085193100010\n\nView details for PubMedID 10665605\n\nAbstract\n\nFew studies examine the relationship between depression and use of specific tobacco and/or cannabis products among adolescents, young adults, and adults. We determined whether the odds of depression are greater among those who used specific tobacco and/or cannabis products and among co-users of tobacco and cannabis.Cross-sectional online survey of a national convenience sample of 13-40-year-olds (N = 6,038). The survey included depression screening and past 30-day use of specific tobacco and cannabis products (cigarettes; e-cigarettes, vaped cannabis, little cigars, cigarillos, cigars, hookah, chewing tobacco, smoked cannabis, edible cannabis, blunts). Analyses correspond to the total sample, and 13-17-, 18-24-, and 25-40-year-olds.Among 5,281 individuals who responded to the depression screener and nine product use questions, 1,803 (34.1 %) reported co-use of at least one tobacco product and one cannabis product in the past 30 days. Past 30-day co-use was associated with higher likelihood of screening positive for depression compared to past 30-day use of tobacco-only (aOR = 1.32, 1.06-1.65; 0.006) or cannabis-only (aOR = 1.94, 1.28-2.94; <0.001). Screening positive for depression was more likely among those who reported past 30-day use of e-cigarettes (aOR = 1.56; 1.35-1.80; <0.001), cigarettes (aOR = 1.24, 1.04-1.48; 0.016), chewed tobacco (aOR = 1.91, 1.51-2.42; <0.001), and blunts (aOR = 1.22, 1.00-1.48; 0.053) compared to those who did not report past 30-day use of these products. Among the 2,223 individuals who screened positive for depression, the most used two-product combination was nicotine e-cigarettes and smoked cannabis (614 individuals, 27.6 %).Screening positive for depression was more likely among past 30-day co-users versus past 30-day users of tobacco-only or cannabis-only. Findings suggest that prevention programs for depression and substance use address tobacco and cannabis co-use.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2024.108076\n\nView details for PubMedID 38838604\n\nAbstract\n\nSociodemographic differences in e-cigarette use have been documented; however, disparities in use of specific e-cigarette types with various ingredients have yet to be thoroughly investigated. This study examines ever- and past-30-day-use of nicotine, cannabis, and non-nicotine e-cigarette device types by sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and financial comfort.Data were drawn from a 2021 national cross-sectional survey of adolescents, young adults, and adults (N = 6131, ages 13-40 years old). Participants reported ever and past-30-day-use of (1) disposable nicotine e-cigarettes, (2) pod/cartridge-based nicotine e-cigarettes, (3) \"other\" nicotine e-cigarettes, (4) non-nicotine e-cigarettes, (5) e-cigarettes with THC, and (6) e-cigarettes with CBD. We constructed summary tables for each e-cigarette device type in which percentages of ever and past-30-day-use were calculated by birth year category and sociodemographic variables: (a) sex, (b) sexual orientation, (c) race/ethnicity, and (d) financial comf"
