        "text": "Moms for Liberty, which describes itself as a parental rights group, is using recent changes to a long-standing federal anti-discrimination law to gain more members.\n\nAnd its New Jersey organizers say that is working. One chapter has doubled its membership, organizers say, and the group is adding local chapters across the state.\n\nTitle IX is a federal law that protects people from discrimination based on sex in federally funded K-12 schools, colleges and universities. It has given women athletes the right to equal opportunity in sports and includes rules for how schools should handle sexual harassment and assault complaints.\n\nPrevious versions of the law did not explicitly define sex, although the law has been interpreted to include gender identity and sexual orientation. New Biden administration changes clearly protect people from discrimination based on these characteristics.\n\nThe federal changes to Title IX have prompted legal challenges from Republican-led states and conservative groups including Moms for Liberty. In one lawsuit out of Kansas, the U.S. Department of Education is temporarily prevented from enforcing the new regulations in four states and in certain schools attended by children of members of the three groups, including Moms for Liberty, that sued to block the law.\n\nThere are Moms for Liberty chapters in 10 of New Jersey’s 21 counties. The national organization announced new chapters in Camden, Hudson, Sussex and Union counties on June 4.\n\nMoms for Liberty has been using this temporary ruling to encourage people to join their local chapters and add their child’s school to the list of places where the U.S. Education Department cannot enforce the new regulations. Even though the Education Department cannot enforce the law, districts must continue to comply with state anti-bullying and anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBTQ+ students.\n\nMore on Moms for Liberty membership surge\n\n“Regardless of whether or not Moms for Liberty targets a particular district, the district is legally obligated to remain a safe space for LGBTQ+ students and families under the Law Against Discrimination,” said Aaron Potenza, a policy consultant at Garden State Equality, the LGBTQ+ advocacy organization.\n\nCall to action\n\nThe Morris County chapter chair of Moms for Liberty shared an Instagram graphic that reads, “ACT NOW! Join Moms for Liberty to protect your children from Biden’s radical overhaul of Title IX.” The Bergen County Moms for Liberty chapter posted on Instagram, “If you are not a member yet, sign up now to protect your child and their whole school!”\n\nThe Bergen County chapter, the state’s largest, had doubled in membership to more than 1,000 at the end of July, according to chapter chair Alex Bougher.\n\nIn Morris County, chapter chair Kristen Cobo said her group has 577 members and has been growing steadily. The biggest membership increases since the chapter’s launch in 2021 have been around the time of mask requirements in schools, changes to state sex-education standards and now, Title IX, she said.\n\n“It’s very clear that parents step up and want to get involved when their autonomy to determine what’s best for their own kids is threatened by that government overreach,” Cobo said. “So when Title IX changes were announced, parents were rightfully upset and said, ‘What can I do?’”\n\nThere are Moms for Liberty chapters in 10 of New Jersey’s 21 counties. The national organization announced new chapters in Camden, Hudson, Sussex and Union counties on June 4. Of the new chapters, only Camden has a website that lists chapter leadership. The Facebook groups of the new chapters are small compared to some other New Jersey chapters, with just one member in Union, five in Hudson, 28 in Camden and 66 in Sussex as of Aug. 1. Members of the Facebook groups are not necessarily voting members of the organization, and they might not fully reflect the size of each chapter.\n\nThe Sussex County chapter hosted a kickoff event in June with Bill Spadea, a Republican candidate for governor in 2025. Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) also attended the event. Candidates endorsed by Moms for Liberty also serve on school boards in some New Jersey school districts.\n\nProtections in NJ\n\nMoms for Liberty’s mission is to defend parental rights at all levels of government, according to the national organization’s website. The national organization takes the position that there are “only two genders based on biological sex,” which denies the existence of transgender and nonbinary people.\n\nAt school board meetings across New Jersey, LGBTQ+ students and allies have called similar messaging from Moms for Liberty and other parental rights groups harmful.\n\n“While NJ school districts are required to follow the Law Against Discrimination, agitation by groups seeking to erase protections for LGBTQ+ young people can create a hostile environment that may leave vulnerable youth feeling unsafe and perhaps unsure of their legal rights,” said Potenza of Garden State Equality.\n\nIn New Jersey, students have protections from discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation. The state’s harassment, intimidation and bullying law is also among the nation’s strongest and protects students based on any distinguishing characteristic.\n\nState Attorney General Matt Platkin is co-leading a national effort to defend Title IX’s protections for students.\n\nMost school districts in New Jersey have also implemented guidance from the state Department of Education that enumerates certain protections for transgender students. The policy, commonly known as 5756, directs schools to accept a student’s asserted gender identity and pronouns. It also states that students are entitled to use the restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nLGBTQ+ students and advocates have said this policy is important to students’ well-being and educational success. Some school boards have repealed the policy, particularly boards where a majority of members believe the district should be required to tell parents if their child changes their name or pronouns at school, even if disclosure is against the child’s wishes for reasons such as safety.\n\nThe big picture\n\nAttorney General Matt Platkin has maintained that New Jersey’s anti-discrimination law must be followed, even in districts without Policy 5756 or where the federal Department of Education is enjoined from enforcing the updated Title IX regulations.\n\nPlatkin is co-leading a national effort to defend Title IX’s protections for students. Platkin has filed briefs in six lawsuits that are attempting to stop the U.S. Department of Education’s final regulations. The new protections would make a bigger difference for LGBTQ+ students in states that do not already have strong anti-discrimination laws on the books.\n\nThe changes went into effect on Aug. 1, but the U.S. Department of Education cannot enforce the new regulations in 26 states and select schools in others. The initial list of New Jersey schools included St. Peter’s Preparatory School in Jersey City and Livingston High School. A second list submitted on July 26 included an additional 35 K-12 schools.\n\nThe Moms for Liberty chairs from Bergen and Morris counties said they added their children’s schools to the list of districts where the U.S. Department of Education cannot enforce the final Title IX regulations. Bougher of the Bergen County chapter said choice is important to Moms for Liberty, so members must opt in to have their child’s school included.\n\nEven in those districts, New Jersey students will continue to be protected under the state’s anti-discrimination and anti-bullying laws. David Rubin, an attorney whose law firm represents around 90 New Jersey school districts, said while the injunction in the Kansas lawsuit stops the U.S. Department of Education from enforcing Title IX in certain schools, it does not stop districts from complying with the new regulations.\n\n“My advice to my districts is, and perhaps even in districts where there are these chapters, is to comply with the new rule because there’s not going to be much of a difference anyway,” Rubin said. “Under our old rule, under the HIB [harassment, intimidation and bullying] statute, we were obligated to be protecting kids in those categories anyway and to do otherwise would be violating their rights under state law.”"
