        "text": "Dodge County is a beautiful county full of rich farmland. Even though it is primarily rural and has a relatively small population, the county boasts many viable businesses in its communities and on its rural properties.\n\nBesides the robust farming enterprises, these businesses include the McNelius companies in Dodge Center, the grain elevators with million-bushel silos in Hayfield and Kasson, health clinics, an airport, grocery stores, gyms, restaurants, retail outlets, beauty salons, bars; the list is as extensive as any urban community’s.\n\nThere are also many opportunities for businesses headquartered on farms besides or along with raising crops and livestock.\n\nLimited rural businesses are home occupations operated out of accessory structures, with certain limitations. Agritourism is a type of business that allows people to visit a farm for recreation, entertainment, education, or certain other activities. Events could include for example, everything from participating in farming activities to viewing natural attractions, to harvesting your own food.\n\nAgritourism Tourism Products could be sold to the public which might include livestock or products raised on the farm. The person that oversees these activities might be an Agritourism Professional and could be paid for their role in the business.\n\nThe Green Shack Educates, Creates, and Inspires Dodge County\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nGretta Becay\n\nThe Green Shack is located at 20658 County Highway 34, just north of Dodge Center, MN. It is locally owned and family-operated by Brittany and Zach Wilcox.\n\nBrittany explained, “Our vision for our farm and business, The Green Shack, was simple. We wanted to educate and inspire our community. We know there is a strong desire from the public to be more ‘hands on’ and creative with their free time, and to learn more about what they can do to help their local environment. We offer a wide variety of classes, both educational and hands on, to help people achieve these goals.”\n\nBrittany explained that the business also offers products for sale including farm-fresh eggs, honey, various plants, recycled glass planters, goat milk soap, live animals - depending on the season – goats, chickens, and other poultry. The business also offers custom metal working, woodworking, and artwork.\n\nBrittany said, “We strongly encourage people to visit and tour our farm. We incorporate organic and all-natural practices into our business, so people can see how we carry these practices out when we care for our plants and animals. We are very conscious of the land and our animals, and we don’t like to have any products or by-products go to waste. So, we incorporate animal products like goats’ milk and beeswax into some of the other items we offer for sale or for use in our classes.”\n\nBrittany loves to talk plants and plant care. She has a degree in horticulture.\n\n“We know that while many people enjoy gardening, they are also a little intimidated by it,” she said.\n\n“We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn about plant care and grow their own food or just beautiful flowers if they choose to do so. To encourage our community to do that, we offer plant and garden care classes, as well as ‘make ‘n’ take parties’ because we want every gardener to have a successful and abundant garden!”\n\nBrittany explained further, “Our farm also has a woodshop, kiln, and blacksmithing forge. While we welcome people who want to use this space for classes and creation, please contact us to set up an appointment. From there, we can brainstorm and create projects that you are interested in completing yourself, but don’t have the space or resources available to you at your own home. We are here for you to help you get these projects done!”\n\nBrittany says, “We are excited to educate our community through farm tours, products we sell, parties we host and classes we offer. Please contact us for more information. We look forward to working with you!”\n\nHours for the Green Shack are: Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday by appointment. Please stay updated on the Facebook page.\n\nFor more information, the business website is http://thegreenshack.net/ ,the phone number is (507) 633-3100, and the email address is bwilcox@thegreenshack.net.\n\nScanlan’s Red Barn Learning Farm is Hosting Pumpkin Season - Hayfield - October 5, 2023\n\nDue North Coffee Shop - November 21, 2022\n\nHidden Pines Bar and Grill Offers Delicious Cuisine - October 27, 2022\n\nSmiling Moose – Coffee Shop and Gifts - March 29, 2022\n\n*Click the image above for jobs with Dodge County."
