        "text": "LEADERSHIP\n\nTheodore Roosevelt once said, “The best executive is the one who has enough sense to pick good men to do what he wants done, and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it.”\n\nAs Sheriff, I believe it’s important to lead with a positive reinforcement-based leadership style that edifies and fully utilizes the knowledge and strengths of our staff to help with the day-to-day duties and decision making. Our staff, in every department, brings to the table years of experience, both inside and outside law enforcement. The men and women who serve the Sheriff’s Office and this community deserve a positive, enthusiastic, supportive Sheriff’s Administration that allows them to do what they do best without micro-managing, while leading with an impartial compass for what’s right and what’s wrong. I firmly believe this leadership style that we’ve adopted has greatly benefited both our staff and the people we serve.\n\nLeadership isn’t about how far you advance yourself, it’s all about how far you advance others. We regularly praise and credit our amazing team of men and women who serve day and night - both with the public and internally throughout the year, as well as during our annual Awards Banquet each year. It’s been very exciting to see, with the right tools and encouragement, our team working together and accomplishing some pretty major goals and improvements over the past three years. It’s been even more exciting to see our employees learning and growing – developing into our future leaders. For me, that’s probably one of the greatest experiences as Sheriff – to be in a position to help those who are willing to work hard and grow develop into our future leaders.\n\nLeadership is really all about producing more leaders, not more followers.\n\nThis positive leadership philosophy has proven effective over the past three years – evident by the number of our employees who have been recognized state-wide for their work and achievements:\n\nCaptain Ryer Anderson – Minnesota Sheriff’s Association Supervisor of the Year\n\nInvestigator Jeff Brumfield – LELS Annual Lou Jeska Award\n\nSergeant Rich Allee – Minnesota Sheriff’s Association Service Award\n\nMelissa Bublitz / Records Dept – PLEAA Excellence in Service Award\n\nThis past week, at the Homeland Security and Emergency Management Governors Conference, our PSAP/Emergency Management Director Matt Maas was awarded the annual Emergency Management Director of the Year award.\n\nWhile there are many accomplishments throughout the year by many of our staff, these are just a few great examples of staff going above and beyond and being recognized inside and outside of our office for their efforts – evidence that our style of leadership works here in Dodge County.\n\nWe are excited to learn, improve, and strengthen our staff and it’s abilities in 2018 – to continue to provide Dodge County the level and quality of law enforcement services you’ve come to expect from our office.\n\nThank you for the opportunity, your confidence, and your trust.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n* return to column index\n\nIT’S CHRISTMAS……\n\nWhile you and your family celebrate the holidays together at home, we are patrolling your neighborhoods – checking your property, your yard, your streets, looking for anything or anyone out of place. We are the ones that venture into the dark, not knowing what if anything awaits us, often to protect many of you we have never even met.\n\nYou spend the evening with your family warm and safe indoors, many enjoying a few drinks in front of a warm fireplace. We’re outside trying to stay warm, dealing with the winter elements - freezing rain, snow, sometimes dangerous road conditions, or maybe even a blizzard. We’re out there waiting for our 911 Dispatchers to advise us when someone else in the county needs our help.\n\nYou’ve got your kids with you, maybe grandkids, also grandparents, aunts and uncles, etc. The whole family is together for this joyous occasion. Our families are spending another holiday without us. This was our year to work. Hopefully we make the rotation next year so we can take time off for them. They understand we make these sacrifices to help keep our communities safe, to help people in need, and to do our little part to make our communities a better place for them to live in. They understand our sacrifices are also their sacrifices.\n\nYour Christmas Eve dinner is ready, a feast the whole family has pitched in to help with. The smell of turkey, ham, and warm pie fill the air, those smells that make us think of Christmas’s past. The house also smells of fresh pine from the real Christmas tree in the living room. We’ve been busy tonight so we haven’t had a chance to get much for a meal - chips and a pop at the local gas station, maybe a piece of pizza or pre-made sandwich. Later we’ll stop in to check on our gas station attendants who are also sacrificing on Christmas. We’ll refill our coffee cups and continue our patrols thru the night.\n\nYou’ve finally got the kids to settle down for the night, all excited about presents and that visit from Santa overnight. Everyone’s tucked in for a warm night’s sleep. If we are lucky enough to live in the zone we work in, we’ll try and stop by to say goodnight to the kids. If we’re too busy, we’ll just have to call when we can. We’ll wish them Merry Christmas over the phone and say goodnight to the kids. Hopefully we can call before they go to bed.\n\nYour kids are in bed and now its adult time - you sit and play cards, games, and visit with family and loved ones reminiscing about the highlights from your evening and all the great memories of past Christmas celebrations in your home. While patrolling your neighborhoods, we all have those homes that stir up old memories as well. The crash we worked a few months ago where we pulled a child from the wreckage who didn’t make it. It’s hard to forget the reaction we got when we walked into that home to tell those parents that their child was gone – or the emotional feeling of just wanting to go home and hug our kids and tell them that we love them. We worry about those parents tonight. We think about that incident every time we drive by that house – a memory we’d love to forget - but can’t. We hope and pray we don’t get another crash like that tonight on Christmas.\n\nYour kids wake you up early, all excited about opening Santa’s presents and celebrating Christmas Day. You’re rested and ready to share this amazing day with your family. We’ve been asleep for an hour or two before our kids are waking us up excited about opening Santa’s presents and celebrating Christmas Day. We finally finished our shift a few hours earlier after a busy evening and quietly sneaked into our homes around 5am. We took off our uniform, grabbed a quick snack from last night’s big meal, and headed to bed trying not to wake up the kids or our spouse. We’ll go downstairs now and see the kids open their gifts, while trying not to think about some of the things that we saw last night. Then it’s back to bed for a better part of Christmas Day. We’ll go back to work at 6pm and do it all over again.\n\nInspite all of the sacrifices many of us will make this Christmas, and some of the anti-law enforcement rhetoric we endure from the main stream media and other radical groups, we remain very proud of this profession that we love. We’re proud of our uniform, we’re proud of our badge, and we’re extremely proud of our flag. We couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Helping you is our calling, it’s our passion, and it’s truly what motivates us.\n\nThe intent of this column is not to make you feel sorry for law enforcement and public safety, it’s simply to remind you of some of the many sacrifices these men and women make for our communities – especially during the holidays.\n\nIt’s also important to think about the sacrifices made by all our Public Safety Partners serving our communities over the holidays – our 911 Dispatchers working to keep everyone safe, our local Ambulance and Fire Department members (many who are volunteers) working side by side with us on emergency calls, and the medical professionals saving lives at our area hospitals. Don’t forget our local tow companies who are also out there helping us day and night. How about the convenience store attendants around the county who are also there to make sure you and Public Safety has everything we need during the holiday – fuel, hot coffee, snacks, etc.\n\nhis Christmas, if you see your local law enforcement or public safety professionals out working the streets, take a minute to thank them for their service and sacrifice. Your “thank you” means a lot to all of them, especially during the holidays.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n* return to column index\n\nHAPPY THANKSGIVING\n\nFollowing the Mayflower’s arrival at Plymouth Rock on December 11th, 1620, the Pilgrims suffered the loss of nearly half of their original 102 colonists. With the help of local Indians, the remaining pilgrims were able to survive a cold and bitter winter – and produced a very bountiful harvest that next summer. They held a traditional 3 day English harvest festival, in which both the colonists and natives united in thanks….most scholars believe this is how our Thanksgiving Holiday started.\n\nFor many of us, the Thanksgiving celebration includes huge feasts, long weekends, parades, football, and family gatherings.\n\nUnfortunately, for many other families, this time of year is not as festive. While we enjoy a pretty strong economy in this area, especially under the bubble of the Mayo Clinic, there are many families still struggling to make ends meet. Struggles that often include financial challenges that sometimes make it hard to put a meal on the table or clothing on their kids, some dealing with major health battles, some further burdened by chemical dependency challenges - both drugs and alcohol.\n\nThis year, as you give thanks for the blessings you and your family enjoy, please consider doing your part to help others this next year. Consider volunteering with an area service group or charitable organization here in Dodge County. We have several organizations dedicated to help families like these who are struggling. You can either volunteer and/or donate to great local organizations like the Masonic Lodge, Legion Auxiliary, SE MN Red Cross, and Salvation Army to name a few. Mission 22 is another great organization that works with veteran and public safety suicide prevention. Shop with a Cop in Kasson. There are other great community service organizations like the Lions who volunteer tons of hours throughout the year to community projects. Also groups like the Shriner’s who work to raise money each year for the Children’s Hospital, or the KM Care and Share Auction held annually in Kasson each year that helps raise money to assist people with food, clothing, utilities, and others in times of need. The Dodge County Food Shelf is another organization that needs your support. Our Schools also have many organizations you can become a part of to help better our community. There are so many great local organizations here in Dodge County that could use your help and support to help those in need!\n\nHere at the Sheriff’s Office, we are heavily involved in the Toys for Tots program this time of year. Toys for Tots is a program that was founded in 1947 by the United States Marine Corps Reserve which distributes toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas. Last year we sorted over 20,000 toys and delivered them throughout SE MN. Our first goal at the Sheriff’s Office is to make sure no child in Dodge County goes without a few nice gifts under the tree this Christmas. We then help neighboring communities fill their orders including delivering a bunch of toys to Santa Anonymous and to the Children’s Floor at St Mary’s Hospital in Rochester. We will start collecting new unwrapped toys this week at the Sheriff’s Office in Mantorville.\n\nThis week when you sit down and celebrate Thanksgiving with your family and friends, and you give thanks for all the blessings you’ve enjoyed throughout the year – please say a prayer for those struggling this holiday season and consider donating and/or volunteering a little bit of your time to one of the many great charitable organizations in our area. Together we can help continue to make Dodge County a great place to live and raise our families.\n\nThank you, and Happy Thanksgiving everyone.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nWHAT DOES THE FLAG MEAN TO ME - Oct 2017\n\nFreedom, Honor, Pride, Sacrifice, Love of Country…….\n\nFor many, the flag stirs up many memories, memorials, feelings and emotions. The flag means different things to different people – in different walks of life.\n\nI was asked to speak last week at the Field of Flags Ceremony in Mantorville. The topic – “What does the flag mean to me?”\n\nFor me, the flag represents our amazing law enforcement officers who, day and night, work tirelessly to make our communities safer for our friends, our families, and our children. It reminds me of our Dispatchers, the unseen heroes behind the mic, really the backbone of law enforcement. It also reminds me of our many Sheriff’s Posse volunteers who serve side by side with our deputies – serving and protecting.\n\nThe flag reminds me of all the law enforcement officers we’ve lost this year killed in the line of duty – As of September 7th, Line of Duty deaths in the United States total 88 for the year. It saddens and humbles me to think about their sacrifice – and it reminds me to do everything I can to help make sure our men and women have all the tools, training, and support to ensure that they stay safe day and night while they work to keep our communities safe.\n\nIt reminds me of the four officers we’ve lost in the Line of Duty here in Dodge County in the 162 years since JB Hubbell was appointed as our county’s first Sheriff.\n\nHayfield City Marshal Oly Havey – End of Watch December 30th 1905 – shot and killed confronting an armed burglar at the Dalen and Alrick Store on Main Street in Hayfield.\n\nClaremont Police Chief Greg Lange – End of Watch July 5th 1988 – shot and killed while trying to save a young lady’s life during a domestic argument in Claremont just a few hundred feet from his home.\n\nHayfield Police Chief Douglas Claassen – End of Watch March 13th 1999 – died as a result of injuries he suffered during an assault.\n\nDodge County Sheriff’s Captain Loring Guenther – End of Watch Sept 10, 2013 – died as a result of a heart attack.\n\nSeeing the flag brings me back to the memory of Chief Deputy Mike Leonhardt presenting the flag to Loring’s wife Deb at his funeral.\n\nThe flag reminds us of the sacrifices these men made, while also reminding us of the great memories many of us have of them – memories shared by family and friends.\n\nThe flag reminds me of Sheriff Bill Weber who blessed me with the opportunity to serve as a new young deputy under him in 2002 – helping me start my journey here with the Sheriff’s Office.\n\nThe flag makes me think of the many relatives of mine who served our country proudly in the armed services, like my Uncle PFC Harry Erickson who served as a medic in the bloody Battle of the Bulge on Christmas of 1944.\n\nMy Great great Grandfather Ezekiel Rose who was shot and injured serving in the civil war.\n\nMy grandfather Emil Asleson who served as a special deputy with the Divide County Sheriff’s Office in North Dakota in the 40’s.\n\nThe flag makes me think of my father Bob Rose, who served with the Kasson Police Department from 1968 to 1979, then was hired by Sheriff Ernie Vanderhyde here at the Sheriff’s Office where he continued to serve part-time until he retired in 2000.\n\nThe flag reminds me of many amazing people who have influenced me and made my life better.\n\nThe flag represents the amazing men and women who serve our community as paramedics or EMTs – some who are paid, many who are volunteers. It reminds me of the 10 paramedics/EMT’s who have died in the line of duty so far this year.\n\nThe flag represents the dozens of volunteer fireman in our county that risk their lives and volunteer their time to help protect the citizens of Dodge County. Fireman that VOLUNTEER to risk their lives for us! It represents the 66 fire fighters that have died in the line of duty so far this year in the US.\n\nThe flag reminds me of all the brave men and women who have sacrificed both here and abroad serving in our armed forces, many who’ve paid the ultimate sacrifice to help keep us free. The flag represents the families of those military hero’s; the parents, spouses, and children of those who spent time away from their families risking all to ensure the freedoms we enjoy today.\n\nThe American flag is a symbol not only of hardiness, valor, purity, innocence, vigilance, perseverance and Justice; it is a symbol of freedom. Freedom that has been fought so hard for over decades. Freedom that has cost this country and the families within so much, and yet it’s still a beacon to those wishing they had the freedom that our country has.\n\nWe fly this flag proudly outside our offices, military buildings, schools, public institutions, and our homes. It rests against walls and is draped carefully across caskets, honoring those who’ve given their lives defending it. It’s a symbol of freedom, of hope, and of our nation.\n\nI encourage you, if you haven’t already, to talk to your kids, your grandkids, your family, and your friends about the flag. Talk about what it means to you and what it means to them. Talk to them about always respecting the flag, and remind them of all those who have sacrificed for it and of those who continue to sacrifice for us.\n\nTo me the flag represents the very best our country has to offer – those willing to put it all on the line, both here and abroad - to help keep America great, to help keep America safe, and to help keep American Free.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n* return to column index\n\nREMEMBERING LORING.....\n\nHe was a young 25 year old rookie from Crystal Minnesota and a newcomer to SE Minnesota when he was hired at the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office. While Loring didn’t grow up in Dodge County, you never would have known it by the ownership and pride he showed every day he put on the uniform and served our county. His smile, his sense of humor, and his sense of right and wrong were infectious. He soon became a favorite at the Sheriff’s Office, with the public, and with our deputies. He was the guy that everyone wanted to be around, always the life of the party.\n\nA few years into his career, after quickly developing life-long friends at the Sheriff’s Office, he married his best friend Deb at a small country church in Dodge County, right across the street from the hobby farm he would later purchase with Deb.\n\nLoring came to the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office at a time when we were at a crossroads – he was the new young kid on the block; enthusiastic, positive, full of new ideas and the ambition to make them happen. Loring was perfect for a department that had fallen behind the bigger surrounding agencies with bigger budgets, better equipment, training, and technology. Like many of the smaller area agencies, Dodge had become a department that many young deputies would come and use as a stepping stone to get some experience and move on to larger higher paying agencies.\n\nOne of Loring’s many goals was to change that pattern, envisioning the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office as being current, progressive, and technology driven….one that young officers would want to come to work for and spend their careers here!\n\nLoring was one of those guys who always strived to do the right thing and could care less who knew about it or recognized his involvement. This characteristic was seen year after year as he worked tirelessly to better our community, and better our Sheriff’s Office, always being an instrumental part in accomplishing many of the great improvement we've seen over the years, yet crediting everyone else for getting it done. His positive, enthusiastic personality helped him quickly move up the ranks as a field training officer, firearms instructor, Training Sergeant, and finally as Captain, the third highest ranking officer in the county. From self-defense, to firearms training, he also shared his law enforcement training experience by teaching law enforcement students at Rochester Community and Technical College for many years. In addition to all his responsibilities with the Sheriff's Office he was also active every year volunteering for the local Toys for Tots program, a program he felt very strongly about.\n\nCo-workers describe Loring as being someone who would do anything for you, a strong, kind, thoughtful, and humble leader. He was a true leader by example in every way, and was respected by all who had contact with him. – he was one that believed the purpose of life was to be useful, honorable, compassionate, and to make a difference.\n\nIn law enforcement, we’re taught how to deal with the stress of working the streets – problem solving, dealing with domestics, assaults, car crashes, fatalities, etc. We’re taught how to deal with this in school, in skills, and on the job. We’re taught how to recognize the signs of this type of stress and we’re given the resources to get the help we need to deal with it. While our training focuses on the daily stress we deal with out in the field, there is unfortunately little emphasis put on the challenges of stress within the workplace; stress with subordinates or co-workers, maybe the stress of a workplace with administrative challenges, or maybe conflicts directly with management.\n\nWith all of Loring’s talents, his management and supervisory experience, his amazing personality, his law enforcement knowledge and experience, his experience training new deputies, with all the years of patrol dealing with domestics, assaults, car crashes, and fatalities, Loring’s biggest challenge was dealing with workplace stress. Dealing with an administration he felt shared none of the leadership philosophies that Loring built his career on and truly believed in. Loring felt a responsibility to protect staff that he believed were being targeted and treated unfairly. Loring felt a responsibility to counsel everyone that was having problems with the workplace stress – problems that effected the health of many, and unfortunately in some cases effected their families, and their marriages.\n\nLoring felt strong about this responsibility because we were his family, his law enforcement family, and he would do anything he could to protect us. Unfortunately, while Loring was always great at counseling others, he wasn’t one to talk about his own problems.\n\nWhile he used to talk to his wife Deb and some of his close friends at the office about the stresses he was struggling with, at one point late in the summer of 2013, he stopped talking to anyone about work. One can only assume, knowing how protective he was of everyone, that he just didn’t want to burden anyone. What we didn’t know is in addition to an unknown onset to coronary artery disease, Loring had developed an enlarged heart, one the coroner indicated was likely the result of acute daily stress. While we suspect Loring may have been experiencing warning signs to these conditions for a while, it’s likely that he probably wrote them off to just being symptoms of stress from work. It was also likely that he didn’t want to burden anyone with these symptoms, which is probably why he adopted such an aggressive workout routine that he did every day after work – trying to manage the stress on his own.\n\nFour years ago today - on the evening of September 10th 2013, at 43 years young, shortly after returning home from work, Loring died of a massive heart attack.\n\nIf Loring were here today he would want us to talk about managing stress. Not only the stress of the job, but the importance of managing and dealing with workplace stress. How vitally important it is to make sure you watch out for yourself, your fellow deputies and officers. Watch for warning signs of high stress; changes in eating patterns, increased smoking or drinking, changes in attendance, loss of motivation and confidence, negative or depressed feelings. If you or your co-workers are showing any of these signs, encourage them to talk to someone. To get checked out! Unfortunately, none of us knew the degree of stress Loring was dealing with. After Loring died, several in our office re-evaluated their health and went to their family doctors, some were ok - but there were a handful that had medical issues like anxiety and high blood pressure that needed to be treated, for most – these symptoms previously undiagnosed. Some were treated with medicine, some treated with counseling. We’re supposed to be tough, we’re cops, we should be able to handle the stress. It’s a tough for some to admit when they can’t. I was one of those guys – I ended up doing both counseling and medication to get things under control.\n\nWhat kind of work environment are you working in? What kind of working environment are you encouraging and supporting for your staff? The stress, s out on the street might not be the only serious stress your staff is struggling with? If you are a Sheriff, a Chief, or part of a Command Staff, you have a responsibility to provide a positive, healthy, supportive work environment for your staff – our job already comes with enough stress! As leaders we shouldn’t compound this by creating undue stress in the office.\n\nSo far this year, we've lost 90 officers in the Line of Duty throughout the United States, including 9 who died of heart attacks. The stress of this job also contributes to well over 100 cop suicides a year in this country.\n\nAs we all know, workplace stress is by no means limited to just law enforcement - literally every line of work out there can be adversely affected by workplace stress. Hopefully by sharing Loring's story, we can help others dealing with stress at work to take it seriously, and to get checked out if you or a co-worker of yours is showing signs of problems related to stress. Also, if you supervise staff, we hope Loring's message reminds you that your actions can not only affect your staff's performance, but also your staff's health. Your position comes with a great deal of responsibility, far beyond your company's bottom line.\n\nThank you for taking these few minutes to help us remember Loring. He was an amazing leader, mentor and friend who taught us so much in his short time here, and unfortunately left us way too soon. It's heroes like Loring who serve as constant reminders to us that it’s not the years in your life that count, it’s the life in your years that count.\n\nThank you for taking these few minutes to help us remember Loring today.\n\nNEVER FORGOTTEN.......\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nMINISTERS WANTED - July 2017\n\nWith every call, every day, law enforcement officers are faced with potentially dangerous life threatening situations. The officer may have to make split-second decisions that are just and right – but often times very difficult. Many times after these events take place, the officer has a need to express his or her frustrations and problems to someone who fully understands the circumstances of the law enforcement world. An officer may need to discuss his/her problems with someone who understands what (s)he is up against, yet is detached enough not to be emotionally involved or in a position that might affect the officer’s career.\n\nFor law enforcement officers, trusting someone enough to confide in them about issues at work is probably one of the toughest things for us to do – we are supposed to be strong, non-emotional, and bullet proof. We are supposed to be “robot like” when dealing with people in crisis. No one career, in my opinion, is confronted with more situations that can demoralize and create extreme emotional and mental burdens than law enforcement.\n\nAfter looking at and dealing with a handful of devastating incidents over the past couple of years, and seeing that we really are lacking with this type of internal support system for our staff, the agencies that serve with us, and the victims we are there to help - I started researching the idea of starting a Sheriff’s Chaplain Program here in Dodge County. Our local law enforcement officers, dispatchers, and first responders are out there day and night, 24/7 to help and protect us – we need to make sure they are taken care of too.\n\nToday, more than ever, our local law enforcement agencies need a resource for guidance, counseling and assistance to their officers, their families, and their communities. Also, the burden these officers take on can tremendously affect the officer’s family too – often the forgotten victims. The officer’s own clergy person or religious advisor, although trained in the ministry, likely doesn’t have a good understanding of the particular problems law enforcement officers face. In such cases, this is where a chaplain could listen with empathy, advise calmly, and offer assistance when such assistance is appropriate. The chaplains are not there to proselytize (unless asked for religious advice or guidance), just to be an understanding ear and provide support and guidance with an open heart and mind.\n\nThe need for this type of support also holds true for the dozens of fireman, first responders, and medical emergency staff that responds and serves alongside our officers every day.\n\nOver the past several months I’ve been meeting with a number of area ministers who are interested in being involved in a local chaplain program here. We’ve brought in a handful of speakers and have looked at model programs from other city and county agencies.\n\nHere is an example of just a few areas where a Chaplain could assist:\n\n• Participate in a ride-along program with patrol officers\n\n• Respond to all major disasters such as fires, collapse of buildings, explosions, mass casualty events, unusual industrial accidents, and similar situations\n\n• Assists officer with making death notifications\n\n• Assist with suicide incidents\n\n• Provide assistance to victims\n\n• Serve as a member of the Crisis Response Team\n\n• Visit sick and injured officers and departmental personnel at home or at the hospital\n\n• Provide answers for religious questions (does not proselytize)\n\n• Offers prayers at special occasions such as recruit graduations, award ceremonies, etc.\n\n• Counsel members of the law enforcement community, sworn and non-sworn, as well as their families\n\nWe currently have a number of ministers in the area who have expressed interest in being involved in this new program. We would like to reach out to the rest of our ministers here in Dodge County to see if we have others who may be interested. The more support we have from the different communities we serve, the more effective this program will be.\n\nIf you are a minister with at least 5 years of experience and the willingness to be available to respond to any situation where a chaplain’s presence may be needed, we would like to hear from you as we move forward and look for additional partners for this program. Please email me your contact information and level of interest at scott.rose@co.dodge.mn.us so I can add you to our list.\n\nIf you are interested in supporting a program like this in our community, I would be interested in hearing from you too!\n\nThanks everyone for your input, your interest, and your show of support for this new program! I am excited about getting started and really think our community will benefit from it!\n\nKeep watching our Facebook page (@DCSOSheriff) and website (www.dodgecountysheriffmn.com) for future updates!\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nSAFETY TIPS FOR THE FAIR - July 2017\n\nSummer here in Dodge County is filled with fun events and festivals for family’s young and old. Out of all of our summer events, the Dodge County Fair is by far the biggest event and busiest for our staff. It’s an event I look forward to every year – I’ve been attending the Dodge County Fair since I was a kid growing up in Kasson. The fair is a great place for everyone in the family, but please make sure to take steps to keep it a safe and fun experience for everyone.\n\nPlease lock your vehicles and never leave valuables in them while enjoying the fair. If you must leave items in the vehicle, make sure they aren’t visible from the window.\n\nBe careful to make sure everyone is safe crossing the street. This is the worst week of the year for traffic in Kasson. With all the distractions the fair crowd and traffic brings, don’t assume that the car coming down the road sees you and your kids. Always keep your kids close and use intersections and crosswalks to get across the street.\n\nWhile at the fair, parents and caregivers need to remember to keep a close eye on their children. With everything there is to see at the fair, getting separated in a large crowd can happen very easily and can be very stressful for your family, your kids, and for law enforcement. If your kids are venturing to areas of the fairgrounds without you, have a planned meeting spot for everyone to meet at the end of the day. Make sure your kids know where and how to find a deputy if they get separated from you\n\nWe will have deputies in several areas of the fair again this year. We’ll be patrolling the midway, the exhibit areas, and the grandstands. We’ll have two areas where you can find deputies if you need assistance – the Sheriff’s Building (front of the bathroom building) at the main entrance of the fair, and our Emergency Command RV that will be parked southeast of the Four Seasons Arena building. If you go to one of those locations and don’t find law enforcement, call our dispatch at 635-6200 and ask for a deputy to respond to your location.\n\nMake sure to stay hydrated. We’ve had some warm and humid fair weeks in the past. This can be dangerous to young and old if you aren’t drinking enough water and staying hydrated. We will have cold drinking water at both of our locations available to the public.\n\nIf you are allergic to bees – make sure you have your medication with you. In the last few years we’ve had a handful of bee stings that have required medical attention. If you or any of your kids are allergic to bee stings, make sure you have the proper medication with you in the event you encounter any bees at the fair.\n\nAmusement Ride Safety. Going on the amusement rides at the fair can be very exciting for people of all ages. No matter what your age make sure you remember safety. Make sure to read all the posted rules and instructions before going on. It is not a bad idea to watch the ride while in motion before going on to make sure you understand what will happen. Always obey the height, weight and age restrictions. Sneaking someone on who does not meet the requirements is very dangerous and can result in serious injury.\n\nSafety in the animal buildings. Visiting the animals is a must at the fair. The animal exhibits are also a very important area to keep safety in mind. Good hand-washing hygiene is a must around animals. There are several hand-washing stations available near the barns. Wash your hands both before and after being around animals even if you are not touching them. Handwashing stations will be available outside the buildings. If you are with young children around the animals, make sure that they do not get too close to the animals and do not stick their fingers, feet, or anything else in cages. That could not only be harmful to them, but also the animals.\n\nBe sure to have a sober driver. Alcohol is served at all the grand stand events as well as in the beer garden. We want everyone to come to the fair and have a great time, but if you plan on drinking alcohol please have a plan for a sober driver.\n\nThese tips should not only be remembered at the Dodge County Fair, but any of the summer festivals you plan on attending with your family and friends this year. The Dodge County Fair is a great place for family and friends to gather and there is always a ton of things to see and do. Having safety in mind can help make it a fun and safe experience for all!\n\nEnjoy the fair everyone! Hope to see you there!\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n* return to column index\n\nMEMORIAL DAY SPEECH - MAY 29TH, 2017\n\nI read an article this weekend written by a Gold Star Spouse entitled “When every day is Memorial Day”. This young lady explains how she used to be the one who would said “Happy Memorial Day” because at the time she didn’t know any better. She was like many other Americans - excited about getting ready for this long weekend, excited about vacation plans, hoping for good weather, and getting those last minute BBQ plans put together. This was until the day she answered her door to Military Personnel notifying her that her husband had been killed. He was an Army helicopter pilot, served 2 tours in Iraq and 2 tours in Afghanistan. The meaning of Memorial Day forever changed that day for her and her family.\n\nShe said WE SHOULD enjoy our off times. That WE SHOULD enjoy this time with friends & family. BUT, while we enjoy the freMEMORIAL DAY SPEECH - MAY 29TH, 2017edoms we celebrate here in the United States with family and friends this Memorial Day weekend, she encourages all to make the choice to incorporate the true meaning of Memorial Day somewhere into our celebrations.\n\nWe need to remember that some gave all, and their loved ones experience the cost of freedom, in every moment, of every day. These grandparents, parents, husbands, wives, kids and grandkids who lost their loved ones while serving our country; for these folks who are our family, friends, our neighbors, our co-workers Every Day is Memorial Day, and this weekend is especially difficult for these families.\n\nMemorial Day originated as Decoration Day after the American Civil War in 1868. On the first Decoration Day, General James Garfield made a speech at Arlington National Cemetery, and 5,000 participants decorated the graves of 20,000 Union and Confederate Soldiers buried there. The Civil War, which ended in the spring of 1865, claimed more lives than any conflict in US history and required the establishment of the country’s first national cemeteries.\n\nThis past few weeks you may have noticed people around our county selling and displaying their red poppies. These poppies are made by veterans to honor fellow veterans and remember those lost – your donations assist disabled and hospitalized veterans, many from our community. After World War I, the poppy flourished in Europe and quickly became a symbol of the sacrifices made by Americans and allied service members around the world. Soldiers returning from WWI brought home the flowers in memory of the barren landscape transformed by the sudden growth of wild red poppies among the newly dug graves - unforgettably described in a memorial poem by Canadian Lt. Col. John McCrae:\n\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow between the crosses, row on row,\n\nThat mark our place….\n\nand in the sky… the larks still bravely singing fly… scarce heard amid the guns below.\n\nWe are the dead: Short days ago, We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n\nLoved and were loved: and now we lie In Flanders fields!\n\nTake up our quarrel with the foe\n\nTo you, from failing hands, we throw the torch….\n\nbe yours to hold it high - If ye break faith with us who die,\n\nWe shall not sleep, though poppies grow\n\nIn Flanders Fields\n\nSaturday my family held our annual cemetery tour to honor our ROSE family heritage and remember those who’ve past, and we talk every year about a number of relatives of ours who served this country proudly in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and others. I’m proud to say, while I didn’t serve in the military, I have a number of relatives who served our country proudly. None prouder than my Uncle Harry.\n\nPrivate First Class Harry Lee Erickson, grew up in Chatfield and was drafted at age 20 in 1943 during WWII. He had initially been selected for the Army’s Specialized Training Program for engineering yet he ended up on the front lines as a medic later participating in 4 major campaigns; on the battlefields in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany – including the bloody Battle of the Bulge on Christmas 1944. He served alongside his best friend and fellow medic, Bert Taylor.\n\nTogether they saw unspeakable tragedy and carnage, and saved hundreds of lives. His Paperwork associated with his Bronze Star medal, one of many medals he was awarded for his service, cited “At one point, at dusk, where other medical soldiers and even tanks would not venture, PFC Harry Erickson drove his “peep” (they referred to Jeeps as Peeps) to give first aid and evacuate three of our men, who were seriously wounded, despite information received that there were enemy tanks lurking in the vicinity.” Uncle Harry said he got to where he could recognize the sounds of the German Tanks versus ours, and he could hear them approaching as he drove in to help those three men – yet he continued without regard to his own safety.\n\nHe recalled hearing mines go off in the mine fields, waiting for the screams, then for the calls for a medic, and then being the one to charge off into that mine field to attend to the wounded – often with unspeakable injuries.\n\nWe looked at a picture of him in his Jeep on Saturday – noticing he had no red cross or medic emblem on his helmet. He had said that he didn’t like wearing the medic helmet because for a time the Germans were targeting the medics as they tended to our wounded. He recalled going into battle areas to retrieve the wounded – hearing bullets hitting the ground around him and whizzing by his head – even though code of conduct in war stated soldiers were not to shoot at those tending to the wounded in combat zones.\n\nOne day Uncle Harry recalled walking to the outdoor field kitchen, and the winter winds had uncovered frozen soldier’s bodies in the snow – some of these bodies were visible as you walked by. He was asked by his supervisor to go out and move the bodies away from view…his supervisors concerned that this view would affect the moral of the of the soldiers there – not considering Uncle Harry’s moral at the time.\n\nMy Uncle Harry and his buddy Bert Taylor were amazing soldiers, they were American heroes. Uncle Harry made it back after the war. His best friend Bert Taylor did not – leaving behind a wife and twin boys he had only seen once while on a brief Army furlough.\n\nUncle Harry struggled with severe PTSD and constant nightmares following the war. He would often sleep walk at night stating he was looking for his hole (referring to his foxhole). He struggled most on anniversary days with the memories he simply wanted to forget – like Christmas which is when the Battle of the Bulge took place.\n\nMy Uncle Harry is buried at Ft Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis – his request was that he be buried among his fellow veterans. His Best friend, Private First Class Albert E. Taylor, died in Germany and is buried in Ardennes American Cemetery in Belgium. Bert never made it home – and Uncle Harry never got over the loss of his friend. Uncle Harry carried Bert’s picture in his wallet until he died.\n\nFor Uncle Harry, Every day was Memorial Day. Remembering all those he saw lose their lives fighting for our freedom – especially remembering his best friend Bert Taylor, who never made it back to the states.\n\nMany would argue that changing the calendar date of Memorial Day each year to create a three day weekend has undermined the very meaning of Memorial Day. Has this three day kickoff to summer, as Memorial Day weekend is often referred to, contributed to the general public’s often nonchalant observance of Memorial Day? Probably!\n\nSo what can we do to better honor the fallen?\n\n- Visit local or national cemetery’s and search out those who were Medal of Honor recipients.\n\n- Volunteer with your local Veterans Groups\n\n- Pause at 3pm for one minute today for the National Moment of Remembrance to honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. At 3pm today a wreath will be laid before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n- Educate yourself on Memorial Day and what it really means.\n\nVisit a war memorial, war monument, or military museum\n\nBuy and wear that red poppy\n\nTalk to your kids about what today means\n\nWe share these things with you to remind you that there are people who move along every day that are carrying the weight of their loss - the loss of loved ones who died for our freedom. I ask you to remember their sons and daughters, their husbands and wives, sisters, brothers, fathers, and mothers lost. I ask you to remember their friends like Uncle Harry’s friend Bert Taylor.\n\nUse this Memorial Day to do something, even something small, to honor the fallen. Teach your kids about it. Then go for a bike ride, take your kids to the park, eat a burger and a hot dog, laugh until you cry, kiss your sweetheart - celebrate and appreciate your freedoms. Too many died young in service of our country. Too many didn’t get the luxury of growing old.\n\nRemember, for many….Every Day is Memorial Day.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nPEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY IS MAY 15TH\n\nIn 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designated May 15th as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as Police Week. That weekend, tens of thousands of law enforcement officers from around the world will converge on Washington DC to participate in a number of planned events which honor those that have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nWhen President Kennedy signed this proclamation, we had 155 men and women who had died in the Line of Duty here in Minnesota. Fast forward to today, we’ve had 277 Minnesota Line of Duty deaths.\n\nThis past year we’ve been fortunate enough here in Dodge County to be involved in a couple of important initiatives related to this important day….\n\nHAYFIELD POLICE CHIEF DOUG CLAASSEN\n\nAfter finding out “The Rest of the Story” with Hayfield Police Chief Douglas Claassen and his Line of Duty death in 1999, we were able to successfully get his name added to the Minnesota Law Enforcement Association’s Line of Duty Memorial, SE Minnesota’s LEMA Memorial, the national Officer Down Memorial Page, and finally engraved forever on the National Law Enforcement Memorial Wall in Washington DC. With the help of many organizations including National COPS, MN COPS, MN100 Club, Hayfield American Legion, and Hayfield Chamber of Commerce – we were able to assist the Claassen family to cover all expenses to fly their family to Washington DC to see Chief Claassen formally added to the national wall during Memorial Week. Chief Claassen is also now memorialized on a plaque in the courthouse annex. His badge is also displayed on the memorial graphics on all of our patrol squads. We will never forget his service and sacrifice.\n\nLEMA SPECIALTY PLATES\n\nWe’ve been working with Kasson resident Roger Berge, Senator Dave Senjem, and Representative Duane Quam on a bill proposal for a Minnesota specialty License plate to support the Minnesota Law Enforcement Memorial Association (LEMA). Many attempts over the past several years to gain support at the Senate and House level for a LEMA license plate have fallen on deaf ears at the capitol. This same group tried to promote this bill last year testifying before the Senate and it failed early on to get passed. We tried again this year and with a great deal of effort between Roger Berge and Senator Senjem, this bill looks like it will finally be passed. We’ll put out more information this month, but this will be the first law enforcement license plate in Minnesota and will directly benefit LEMA and surviving families of Line of Duty death victims. We couldn’t be more proud to be involved in this huge accomplishment – an accomplishment that never would have happened without Roger Berge and Senator Senjem!\n\nThis Sunday May 14th the annual Standing of the Memorial Guard at the Peace Officers Memorial on the Minnesota State Capitol grounds will commence at 7pm. Officers from all over Minnesota will travel to St. Paul where they will stand in silent vigil for 20 minutes shifts. This is done to keep alive the memories of the 277 fallen law enforcement officer in Minnesota who have lost their lives while protecting their communities. This list includes four from our county; Hayfield Marshal Ole Havey, Claremont Police Chief Greg Lange, Hayfield Police Chief Doug Claassen, and Dodge County Sheriff’s Captain Loring Guenther. This vigil will continue throughout the night and until the following day when the officers will complete the standing of the guard at 7pm Monday night. We will then honor all law enforcement officers who have given their lives in the line of duty in Minnesota and nationwide with a candlelight service there at the memorial.\n\nOn May 15th, I ask that you to please remember these great men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice to help keep our county, our state, and our country safe. It’s also just as important to remember the families of the fallen, on this day and always, to show them your support and appreciation. While every day can certainly be a challenge for the family and friends of the fallen, this can be an especially tough week.\n\nRemember, to fully appreciate the heroes of the present, we must recognize our heroes of the past.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nHEROIN & FENTANYL - A LETHAL COMBINATION\n\nMarch 2017\n\nOn March 3rd we charged a young man from Rochester for 2nd degree and 3rd degree murder for selling Heroin laced with Fentanyl to another young man in Dodge Center – who died from an overdose. The message we want to send is clear – if you sell drugs in our county, we’ll come after you. If you sell drugs in our county and someone dies because of it – we’ll use every resource we have to find you and prosecute you to the fullest extent.\n\nWhile 2016 numbers aren’t available yet, 2015 numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate more than 50,000 people died from drug overdoses. These numbers have skyrocketed with the increased use of heroin and prescription opioid pain killers.\n\nHeroin deaths rose 23% to nearly 13,000 – higher than the number of gun homicides nationwide. Deaths from opioids, including fentanyl, rose 73%.\n\nFentanyl is a powerful synthetic opiate analgesic used to treat patients with severe pain or manage pain after surgery. Fentanyl is a synthetic cousin to heroin, and it is deadly. On the left in this picture is a lethal dose of heroin, equivalent to about 30 milligrams; on the right is a 3 milligram dose of fentanyl, enough to kill an adult. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine and can be 30 to 50 times stronger than heroin.\n\nIt works by binding to the brain's opiate receptors to drive up dopamine levels and produce a state of euphoria and relaxation. The National Institute on Drug Abuse notes that cutting fentanyl with street-sold heroin amplifies its potency and potential danger. Effects can include drowsiness, respiratory depression and arrest, nausea, confusion, constipation, unconsciousness, coma and death.\n\nDrug users often don’t know when their heroin is laced with fentanyl, so when they inject their usual quantity of heroin, they can inadvertently take a fatal dose. While dealers try to include fentanyl to improve potency, their measuring equipment usually isn’t fine-tuned enough to ensure they stay below the lethal levels that could cause the user to overdose. The other problem is the fentanyl sold on the street is almost always made in a clandestine lab – much of it reportedly coming from China. It is much less pure than the pharmaceutical version and thus its effect on the body can be more unpredictable.\n\nAnother alarming discovery is in some parts of the country, dealers are marketing OxyContin and other prescription pain killer pills that are actually fentanyl laced pills – fake prescription pills manufactured in somebody’s basement or warehouse. Some addicts use prescription pain killers because they believe they are safe. Just because it looks like a legitimate prescription pill, doesn’t mean it is anymore.\n\nWith the dangerous potency of fentanyl, and the increased use of it in illegal drug sales across the country, if you are using heroin or prescription pills bought on the street – you are playing Russian roulette with your life!\n\nMany overdoses from opioids like heroin, and prescription pills like morphine and oxy end in the subject’s breathing slowing down and eventually stopping. It can be very hard to wake them up from this state. Narcan (naloxone) is an opiate antidote that blocks the effects of the drug, helping the subject start breathing again. Dodge Center Ambulance Service is now carrying Narcan on their ambulances to help us combat this terrible drug.\n\nIf you know someone who is using heroin or fentanyl, it’s only a matter of time before they overdose or worse. You need to get them help – whatever it takes. You can call your local law enforcement and talk to them about your concerns and get suggestions. If you have any information regarding someone selling and drugs – especially prescriptions, heroin and/or fentanyl – please contact law enforcement right away. You may likely save someone’s life reporting it. As always – remember you can remain anonymous.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to coumn index\n\nWHY NOW AFTER 40 YEARS?\n\nFeb 2017\n\nSome wonder….why now? This month we honored a fallen officer who had never been formally recognized for his service and sacrifice - who's death was deemed a line of duty death, yet he was never recognized for it. His injury occured during an assault in 1977 ultimately resulting in his death in 1999. Why was this so important nearly 40 years after the incident, and 18 years following his death? Why was it so important that we took the time to formally honor Hayfield Police (and part-time Dodge County Deputy) Chief Doug Claassen for his service and his sacrifice?\n\nNearly 1,500 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty during the past 10 years. That’s an average of nearly one death every 60 hours – 142 law enforcement heroes paid the ultimate sacrifice last year. Nearly 60,000 assaults against law enforcement are reported annually, resulting in around 15,000 injures every year. Assaults like the incident where Doug was injured in 1977.\n\nHere in SE Minnesota, 140 brave men and women have died while serving to keep our communities safe.\n\nIn Dodge County we’ve had 4 line of Duty deaths since the County was formed (2 in Hayfield, 1 in Claremont, and 1 in the County). Most greater Minnesota counties have zero, one, or two Line of Duty deaths in their history. Unfortunately we’ve suffered more losses than most, especially in Hayfield. Why? Nobody knows. What we do know is that we can never forget the service a sacrifice of these great men.\n\nLaw enforcement officers and their families are part of a unique culture. There is no other profession in our society that serves quite the same role, or faces quite the same risks as a matter of course in their everyday work life. This culture also creates a unique set of challenges for the families of these men and women. Law Enforcement officers work nights, weekends, and holidays. They miss special family dates – birthdays, anniversaries, school events, band concerts, choir concerts, sporting events, etc. They are on heightened alert daily and need to be on guard and watch their backs both at work and off-duty with their families. Their kids may get teased or worse at school and must know to watch their backs as well. Officers work under the public microscope every day and know that the actions they take in a split second will be arm-chair quarterbacked by many – lawyers, media, and community. They understand they will be held to a higher standard than others both on and off duty – which in turn means their kids are held to a higher standard as well. For many, this career will not likely pay enough for them to avoid needing a part-time job to raise a family and make ends meet – so not only do they miss many special family events in order to protect you and me, they also must spend time away from family to simply help pay the bills. These are truly amazing and giving people!\n\nEvery day or night when these men and women go to work, they hug their families and tell them they love them knowing that every time they go out the door with that badge – they may be injured or killed in the Line of Duty. While this stress can wear on the officer, it most certainly wears on the families watching him or her go out that door each day. I know that first hand growing up with a father who was in law enforcement.\n\nWhen an officer is hurt, or dies as a result of violence, the ripple effect it causes can be traumatic – for the officer, for the officer’s family, for his/her fellow officers, and for the communities they serve.\n\nThe Claassen family lived and sacrificed everyday Doug served Hayfield and this county, sacrifices the family made in order to do their part to help keep our community safe. Then Doug was injured. The Claassen family lived and sacrificed for years with the debilitating effects of his spinal cord injury until he passed away in 1999.\n\nFor fallen Law Enforcement Officer’s surviving families, their sacrifice never ends. It’s important for us as a society, to always honor all fallen officers for their service to our communities, and to recognize their families for their sacrifice. We need to be there to support the families of the fallen - always. We need to make sure they know the appreciation we have for them, that we will always be there to support them, and ensure for them that their loved one’s sacrifice will never be forgotten. Its families like these, with the sacrifices they’ve made, that make Dodge County such an amazing place to live. It’s important for the Havey, Lange, Claassen, and Guenther families to know their husband, grandson, son, father, grandfather, and/or uncle was a hero! We owe it to these families to make sure these men’s service and sacrifice, as well as all the sacrifices their families have made for our community, both before and after their death, are NEVER FORGOTTEN.\n\nThat’s why!\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nTRAINING / A METHOD TO OUR MADNESS\n\nJan 2017\n\nRecently, we’ve done some training that has gained local media attention: The Active Shooter Training we did in the Dodge County Courthouse in December, and the Simulation Training (shoot/no shoot scenarios) that we did last week. The majority of responses we heard about our efforts were very positive. However, I also heard a few critical of our training – that we should focus on more realistic training for our area, on crisis intervention training, or training on mental illness response.\n\nWhile we certainly appreciate hearing the positive comments, I think it’s also important we respond to those questioning our efforts. First of all, let’s address the “realistic” comment. …\n\nIn our Active Shooter training we focused on the challenges of responding to a mass shooting (4+ victims injured or killed excluding the subject/suspect/perpetrator, one location). In the first 15 days of 2017 there were 13 Mass Shooting incidents recorded nationwide – from Winstonville Mississippi (population 191) to Chicago Illinois, an average of nearly one a day.\n\nRecently, we’ve had officer involved shootings in Mankato, Austin, Fillmore County, and here in Dodge County in Hayfield. So to suggest that officer involved shootings aren’t realistic here in SE Minnesota is unfortunately not true. In 2016, there were 16 fatal officer-involved shootings in Minnesota. While these numbers are a far cry from the numbers seen in states like Illinois, they are still concerning for everyone. When you look at the facts, you’ll see it’s training like this that can help prevent fatal officer-involved shootings.\n\nLet’s address the comment regarding our needing to focus more on mental illness response. In Simulation Training we put our deputies in real life scenarios to learn how to safely respond to high stress situations, often where mental illness is a factor, and where weapons may be involved. More importantly we focus on alternative techniques and options available to de-escalate and avoid having to shoot a suspect – with communication and/or less lethal force options. Our deputy’s most important tool or weapon isn’t found on their duty belt, it’s between their ears - their communication skillset. We call it “verbal judo” - using one's words to prevent, de-escalate, or end an attempted assault or attack. The simulator provides our deputies realistic training where we can coach them on verbal de-escalation, while also training on how to respond when there is either no time for “verbal judo”, when it may be ineffective, or simply when use of force is necessary to protect the deputy or others involved or in the area.\n\nDo we send our deputies to Crisis Intervention Training to learn how to deal with Mental illness – sure we do. But this training puts our men and women in situations where they have to make split second decisions, deciding how to best react and end a volatile and dangerous situation. You don’t get this kind of training in a book, classroom, or table top discussion. This gives us and our deputies an opportunity to see how they handle stressful situations like this first hand.\n\nToo often we see emotional responses to law enforcement tactics and training without any facts to back them up. We recently observed how our Active Shooter Training, which included multiple agency response tactics, incident command training, and mass casualty recovery - really helped in our response to the McNeilus explosion in Dodge Center.\n\nBefore you so quickly criticize law enforcement, a profession often twisted and misrepresented in the main stream media and in Hollywood, I suggest a better alternative might be to educate yourself first - talk with your local law enforcement and ask questions, sit in on training that you question, participate in a ride-along, etc. Our tactics and training tools that are most often criticized may someday save your life.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n* return to column index\n\nTWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS\n\nDec 2016\n\nIt’s Christmas Eve. While you and your family celebrate the holidays together at home with relatives, we are patrolling your neighborhood tonight – checking your property, your yard, your streets, looking for anything or anyone out of place. We are the ones that venture into the dark, not knowing what if anything awaits us, often to protect many of you we have never even met.\n\nYou spend the evening with your family warm and safe indoors, many enjoying a few drinks in front of a warm fireplace. We’re outside trying to stay warm, dealing with the winter elements - freezing rain, snow, sometimes dangerous road conditions, or maybe even a blizzard. We’re out there waiting for our 911 Dispatchers to advise us when someone else in the county needs our help.\n\nYou’ve got your kids with you, maybe grandkids, also grandparents, aunts and uncles, etc. The whole family is together for this joyous occasion. Our families are spending another holiday without us. This was our year to work. Hopefully we make the rotation next year so we can take time off for them. They understand we make these sacrifices to help keep our communities safe, to help people in need, and to do our little part to make our communities a better place for them to live in. They understand our sacrifices are also their sacrifices.\n\nYour Christmas Eve dinner is ready. All the family has pitched in to make a huge holiday feast for everyone there. The smell of Turkey, Ham, and warm pie fill the air, those smells that make us think of Christmas’s past. The house also smells of fresh pine from the real Christmas tree in the living room. We’ve been busy tonight so we haven’t had a chance to get much for a meal - chips and a pop at the local gas station, maybe a piece of pizza or pre-made sandwich. Later we’ll stop in to check on our gas station attendants who are also sacrificing on Christmas. We’ll refill our coffee cups and continue our patrols thru the night.\n\nYou’ve finally got the kids to settle down for the night, all excited about presents and that visit from Santa overnight. Everyone’s tucked in for a warm night’s sleep. If we are lucky enough to live in the zone we work in, we’ll try and stop by to say goodnight to the kids. If we’re too busy, we’ll just have to call when we can. We’ll wish them Merry Christmas over the phone and say goodnight to the kids. Hopefully we can call before they go to bed.\n\nYour kids are in bed and now its adult time - you sit and play cards, games, and visit with family and loved ones reminiscing about the night you just had and memories of Christmas past. We’re patrolling your neighborhoods while thinking about a crash we worked a few months ago where we pulled two kids from the wreckage, two that didn’t make it. It’s hard to forget that reaction we get when we have to tell parents their kids are gone – or the emotional feeling of just wanting to go home and hug our kids and tell them that we love them. We worry about those parents tonight. We hope and pray we don’t get another crash like that tonight on Christmas.\n\nYour kids wake you up early, all excited about opening Santa’s presents and celebrating Christmas Day. You’re rested and ready to share this amazing day with your family. We’ve been asleep for an hour or two before our kids are waking us up excited about opening Santa’s presents and celebrating Christmas Day. We finally finished our shift a few hours earlier after a busy evening and quietly sneaked into our homes around 5am. We took off our uniforms, grabbed a quick snack from last night’s big meal, and headed to bed trying not to wake up the kids or our spouse. We’ll go downstairs now and see the kids open their gifts, while trying not to think about some of the things that we saw last night. Then it’s back to bed for a better part of Christmas Day. We’ll go back to work at 6pm and do it all over again.\n\nInspite all of the sacrifices many of us will make this Christmas, and the anti-law enforcement rhetoric we endure from the main stream media and other radical groups, we remain very proud of this profession that we love. We’re proud of our uniform, we’re proud of our badge, and we’re extremely proud of our flag. We couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Helping you is our calling, it’s our passion, and it’s truly what motivates us.\n\nThe intent of this column is not to make you feel sorry for law enforcement, it’s simply to remind you of some of the sacrifices these men and women make for our communities. Hopefully it also makes you think about the sacrifices made by all our public safety partners serving our communities over the holidays – our 911 Dispatchers working to keep everyone safe, our local Ambulance and Fire Department members (many who are volunteers) working side by side with us on emergency calls, and the medical professionals saving lives at our area hospitals. Don’t forget our local tow companies who are also out there helping us day and night. This Christmas, if you see your local law enforcement or public safety professionals out working the streets, take a minute to thank them for their service and sacrifice. Your “thank you” means a lot to all of them, especially during the holidays.\n\nreturn to column index\n\nIF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING!\n\nNov 2016\n\nWhen it comes to protecting our county and the communities within it, we are only as good as the information we have to work with. In other words, the more information we can gather on illegal or suspicious activities within our county, the better we can serve you. Which is why I often sound like a broken record when I say, “I’d rather you call our office 20 times and have all of them be false alarms, versus you not calling one time resulting in someone getting victimized or worse.”\n\nMany of the major cases we have solved over the years have been done in part by the information provided by the public. We’ve also prevented many crimes by responding to suspicious vehicle or circumstances reports called in by watchful citizens.\n\nPublic Safety is not only our responsibility as law enforcement, it’s also your responsibility as citizens. If you see suspicious activity, please call it in. YOU CAN ALWAYS REMAIN ANONYMOUS. Some activity called in by the public include:\n\nDriving Conduct – Many DWI arrests are the result of watchful motorists willing to call in erratic or dangerous driving. This saves lives.\n\nSuspicious Vehicles – Only you will recognize unusual traffic or vehicles in your neighborhood, vehicles that don’t belong, vehicles you don’t recognize as local. We’ve arrested a number of people based on these calls; people who were about to victimize someone, people who had already burglarized properties or otherwise victimized your neighbors. You could prevent your family or your neighbor’s family from becoming victims.\n\nSuspicious Activity – You are the first one that will recognize suspicious activity in your neighborhood. We’ve had citizens call in suspicious activity in homes or properties that should be empty. Maybe the property belonged to a snowbird, or someone who works nights or away from home. These calls have resulted in arrests where we’ve caught burglars, or stopped or prevented burglaries.\n\nThreats – When someone is threatening to do harm to a family member, employer, or school, they often talk about it or give clues based on their behavior, social media posts, threats, etc. Usually there are indicators – these indicators are often only noticed by those close to them. Your phone call could save many lives in this scenario – including the life of your friend or family member.\n\nNarcotics Activity – If you see properties or areas in your community that have unusual traffic that comes and goes in part of your neighborhood, or to a home or apartment in your neighborhood – call it in. Report it. If you are aware of drug activity, hear someone talking about use or problems with drugs, see concerning posts on social media – report it! Your phone call may save that person’s life.\n\nA number of the recent terrorism and mass shooting incidents in our country and abroad all had pre-incident indicators – often suspicious activity that was never reported.\n\nFortunately, we have great people here in Dodge County. Great people who take great ownership in their communities – citizens who are willing to call in this type of activity. The easiest rule of thumb to live by is this – if something concerns you enough to make you wonder if you should call us – CALL US!! As I said before, we’d rather respond to false alarms all night to avoid missing an opportunity to help someone!\n\nIf it’s activity that is going on right now, call our Dispatch Center at 507-635-6200 and report it. If it’s ongoing activity, observations, or concerns that you have you can contact us a number of ways:\n\nCall us 507-635-6200 or 911 for Emergencies\n\nFacebook message us on our page @DCSOSheriff\n\nMessage us on Twitter @DCSOSheriff\n\nMessage us on our website at: http://www.co.dodge.mn.us/departments/investigations_unit.php\n\n(Follow us on Twitter and “like” our Facebook page to get the latest information from our office.)\n\nIf you see something, say something!!! Be a part of the solution! As I said before, public safety is all of our responsibility. By working together, we can all work to continue to make Dodge County an amazing community to raise our families.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call me at the office or email me at scott.rose@co.dodge.mn.us. Thank you!\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\nreturn to column index\n\nCOMMUNITY RELATIONS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\nOct 2016\n\nElection Day is right around the corner, and if you are like my wife Rosie, the end can’t come soon enough. While I’m somewhat of a political junkie and enjoy watching the process, I am also tiring of the nation coverage and ready to move on. Fortunately we aren’t in an election year here at the Sheriff’s Office so we can focus on 2017 and beyond.\n\nOne major topic of discussion during this political year has been law enforcement and community relations, more specifically minority relations. Unfortunately, these discussions are often clouded by the politics of a few organizations who have been given a platform by the nation media to convey their negative anti-law enforcement rhetoric, often inciting unrest and violence towards law enforcement officers.\n\nWith all the negative national press regarding law enforcement, and the false narrative that systematic racism exists within all law enforcement agencies, it’s more important than ever for us to continue to work towards improving communications with EVERYONE in the communities we serve - regardless of color, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. This means promoting positive one-on-one contact with the public thru community policing efforts and local events. It means continuing our School Resource Officer programs in all three school districts in the county. It means continuing to educate kids with our DARE program in all three school districts. It means being involved in charitable events that support our local community. It means supporting our volunteer Fire Departments and Ambulance Services at their various fund raisers and community programs. It means continuing to improve communications with the public - using tools like Code Red, Facebook, Twitter, and our great local newspapers. It means continuing to educate our staff on issues that are important to our community; minority relations, mental health challenges, addiction, and proactive and positive policing strategies. While we don’t face a lot of the complex challenges that the bigger communities face, that doesn’t make these issues any less important to our staff.\n\nCommunication is key to successful policing. My door is always open to any of our county residents interested in discussing issues or concerns within our community. While I always love hearing the positives from the public regarding our staff and their work, it’s equally important that county residents are comfortable enough to come in and share any criticisms or concerns they have about us as well. If I’m not in due to my schedule, Chief Deputy Leonhardt or Captain Anderson would also be happy to talk with you. If they aren’t available, ask for the Sergeant on duty. If you have questions specific to your community, stop and talk to the patrol deputy working your area. If your question is related to something in the schools, talk to our School Resource Officers. Our goal is for the public to be comfortable enough to approach any of our staff regarding their concerns.\n\nThe first step in making sure we are providing the quality of law enforcement our community has come to expect is to continue to build strong relations with EVERYONE in our community - so we can work together to solve problems and issues that affect all of us.\n\nThe greatest measure of our success is the public’s satisfaction. This is not something we take lightly and will continue to work every day to improve. Please let us know if you have any suggestions, questions, or concerns.\n\nMake sure you get out and vote on Tuesday November 8th!!\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\nreturn to column index\n\nQ&A WITH POST BULLETIN REGARDING \"I WAS CALLED A RACIST TODAY\" COLUMN\n\nAug 2016\n\nWhat prompted you to write this piece? Why did you feel that this was the proper forum to address this subject? I think it’s important to remind our communities here in Dodge County the quality of Deputies we have here serving and the high standards we hold them to. Utilizing the local county newspapers is a great way to reach the citizens of our county.\n\nAs a public elected official, do you feel that your piece may alienate members of the minority communities that live in your county that you serve? Could you explain? As a public elected official, I believe it’s my responsibility to share beliefs and stories like this in an effort to reach out to those we serve to reinforce the fact that we have a diverse group of men and women who are committed to equally serving everyone in our community, regardless of color. It’s equally important to reinforce the fact that the negative anti-law enforcement rhetoric that we’ve endured in our state and nationwide is not an accurate reflection of law enforcement in our county.\n\nWas this piece written as a stance from the sheriff or as an individual? I think my columns are a combination of both. My stances as Sheriff are in great part due to my upbringing, core beliefs, experiences, training, and leadership philosophy.\n\nWas this the first instance that anyone from your office encountered a comment like this in the area? Were there ever incidents in race relations during your time within Dodge County? I rarely ever hear about any racial comments like this made towards our deputies – that’s why it got my attention. I don’t recall any “incidents” of race relations here in Dodge County since I’ve been here.\n\nAs the head of the Sheriff’s Office, what responsibilities do you have in a situation such as this where a deputy is called a racist? What particularly about this incident caused you to write this piece? Have law enforcement not dealt with any other situation where a suspect was insulting an officer? We are very fortunate to live and work in a community that is very supportive of law enforcement. When I hear about comments like this it’s my responsibility as Sheriff to review any allegations to ensure our staff handled the incident in a professional and respectful manner – to ensure allegations like these against our men and women are unfounded – or respond appropriately if something was handled improperly.\n\nAre there any plans to train your office in race relations? Do you feel that is necessary? Race relations are often incorporated into various trainings that we currently participate in.\n\nThere was this particular sentence in your piece that stated “Today I’m sad to say that I find myself being more guarded and cautious dealing with someone who is African-American, not because they are black, but because I worry now that they now assume I am racist because of my badge.” Do you feel that you are able to perform your duty as sheriff in protecting all residents in your county if you hold that particular feeling toward a community? Why do you feel that way, and what has changed in your perception of the black community? I believe an important part of addressing racial concerns in our communities is being honest on both sides. It’s important for us in law enforcement to better understand the concerns minority groups have in our communities. We recognize that here in Minnesota and nationwide, minority groups have many valid concerns that our law enforcement and our communities should be discussing. It’s also equally important for us to be honest about the impact and actions of some of these groups have on the men and women who serve in law enforcement. My statement was bluntly honest – I find myself questioning now when I have contact with someone in our community who is African American – do they assume I’m racist because of my badge? Prior to Black Lives Matter, this connection never crossed my mind. I still don’t judge anyone by the color of their skin and never will - I equally hope they won’t judge me because I wear a badge. While I recognize that there are many involved with organizations like Black Lives Matter that truly want to make a difference with minority relations, these groups often fail to call out inappropriate or illegal behavior within their protests causing more harm than good – overshadowing their good intentions. It’s my responsibility as Sheriff to ensure we continue to maintain good minority relations within our community and respond to all incidents equally and appropriately – and to take action if they are not. It’s also my responsibility to back up our staff and call out any allegations against our agency when they’re determined to be unfounded.\n\nDodge County statistically is comprised of 97.2 percent white people, and 0.7 percent African American according to the most recent U.S. Census numbers. Do you think it’s fair to compare the issues of Dodge County where there is little ethnic diversity to incidents that have occurred in larger metropolitan areas such as St. Paul where racial diversity is higher? While I recognize there are incidents of racism within law enforcement that need to be addressed throughout the country, I believe it’s dangerous when leaders in our state and national governments, along with organizations like Black Lives Matter, suggest (without facts to back it up) that systematic racism is a widespread problem within all law enforcement agencies nationwide – this only fuels anti-law enforcement rhetoric and behavior that negatively affects all of us in this profession – regardless of the size or the diversity of our communities.\n\nAs a public elected official, do you feel that your piece may alienate members of the minority communities that live in your county that you serve? Could you explain? As a public elected official, I believe it’s my responsibility to share beliefs and stories like this in an effort to reach out to those we serve to reinforce the fact that we have a diverse group of men and women who are committed to equally serving everyone in our community, regardless of color. It’s equally important to reinforce the fact that the negative anti-law enforcement rhetoric that we’ve endured in our state and nationwide is not an accurate reflection of law enforcement in our county.\n\nHave you ever reached out to the local chapter of Black Lives Matter organization or have been reached out to from them to start a conversation about their organization and movement? Would you ever consider doing so? I have no interest in meeting with BLM about race relations in our county. My office door is always open to discuss any issues and/or concerns with those living in the communities we serve. I believe we can best address local concerns with local citizens who have a vested interest in our county.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n* return to column index\n\nI WAS CALLED A RACIST TODAY\n\nAugust 2016\n\nI had a Deputy walk in my office last week and tell me, “I was called a racist today on a traffic stop!” With everything going on in our state and nationwide, that obviously got my attention. He continued to explain how he had done a traffic stop and wrote the gentleman a ticket for not having a valid driver’s license. Apparently because of these actions, the driver (who was African American) accused him of being racist. Really?\n\nFor those of you that don’t know my background, I grew up in Dodge County and attended K-12th grade in Kasson. My father was a career long teacher and a deputy while my mom stayed home and raised me and three brothers. Growing up here, the only non-white students I can really remember were the foreign exchange students. We weren’t very diverse in the 70’s and early 80’s here in Dodge. As kids, we all really enjoyed these students – learning about their new culture while sharing ours. I still keep in contact with some today via Facebook.\n\nWhen I went to broadcasting school in Phoenix Arizona I met my first openly gay friend, a fellow broadcasting student. While I didn’t pretend to understand what he was going thru, I did stick up for him when others picked on him. When I moved to my first broadcasting job in SE Nebraska in 1988, I became friends with the radio station’s consultant who was from Memphis Tennessee. Leon and I ended up being roommates there and have been lifelong friends since. Leon was a large black man with a big heart and even bigger smile. I learned so much from that man while working for that company, both about the radio business and about people.\n\nAs an adult I now have relatives that are African American, South African, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Canadian, European, and Australian. I have relatives that are straight, and I have relatives that are gay. In my career in law enforcement, I’ve had the opportunity to work with great people from all backgrounds – I’ve worked with deputies and officers that are Mexican, African American, Haitian, and Asian, male, female, homosexual, and lesbian. I love my family and my law enforcement family – and I enjoy the diversity we have. I love learning about history and of different cultures. I’m sure our deputies and other staff have stories very similar to mine.\n\nThe blanket label of racism that some groups are placing on law enforcement nationwide has proven dangerous and divisive. It frustrates me to no end that someone may assume that because I wear a badge, I’m racist? They couldn’t be further from the truth, which is usually the case with career law enforcement officers – especially with our staff. While I know there are many involved with good intentions, movements like Black Lives Matter lose any credibility with law enforcement when they stand silent while officers are murdered and groups riot cities and destroy businesses in the name of BLM. While their movement was started to address racism, when they turn a blind eye to violence against cops it does nothing more than fuel race tensions within the law enforcement community. With their actions, or lack of action in many instances, they’ve in essence become part of the problem, not the solution. For example, prior to BLM, I don’t recall ever thinking about black people differently when dealing with them as a deputy. Today, I’m sad to say that I find myself being more guarded and cautious when dealing with someone who is African American while in uniform – not because they are black - but because I worry now that they now assume I am racist because of my badge. Is this the BLM affect? How is this helping race relations? Sadly, regardless of good intentions, I fear organizations like BLM are only making things worse. Shooting related deaths for law enforcement officers is up 78% compared to this same time last year. In the past few weeks we’ve suffered mass shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge where officers were targeted simply because they were cops – five died in Dallas and three in Baton Rouge with many more injured.\n\nI wish I could tell you I have the answers on how to fix this, but I don’t. I get so frustrated watching the national news and seeing many of our leaders, state and national, choosing politics over peace officers. I can tell you that we have an amazing group of men and women serving in this county. While we’ve been fortunate enough not to have any issues since I’ve been here, we do not and will not tolerate any semblance of racism within our organization. That I can tell you with utmost confidence.\n\nIf you are stopped and get a ticket from one of our deputies for driving with an invalid driver’s license, or any other crime for that matter – you got the ticket or were charged because you broke the law. Period. Not because of the color of your skin. That I can also tell you with utmost confidence.\n\nThanks to all who’ve shown our staff your support over these past weeks and months. Even the smallest gesture of appreciation means a lot to our men and women who serve.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n* return to column index\n\nRESPONSE TO THE DALLAS ATTACKS\n\nJuly 2016\n\nShocked, saddened, concerned, frustrated, and angry. These are some of the expressions I saw in our office last week after the Dallas Shootings. Last Thursday America witnessed one of the most deadly ambush and assassinations of law enforcement officers in US History.\n\nWe have a system of justice in this country - a system that we must give a chance to work. In today’s society, cases like those in Baton Rouge and Falcon Heights involving law enforcement are often judged within hours of the incident - emotional responses formed from social media posts and/or cell phone video long before all the facts of these cases are known. This rush to judgement without the facts is dangerous, fueling incidents like we experienced in Dallas last Thursday, and with the violent protests over the weekend. Our Governor’s response to the Falcon Heights incident is a perfect example of this. His comments implied the St. Anthony officer’s actions were driven by his being racist, further suggesting by his statements that we are faced with the issue that this kind of racism exists within law enforcement here in Minnesota. Our President’s emotional response cited incidents like ours in Falcon Heights are symptomatic of broader problems within law enforcement. All this before few if any facts had been released about these incidents. What happened to these officers’ right to due process? What happened to our leaderships’ responsibility to remain impartial and unbiased? Its statements like these from our leaders that further fuels the anti-law enforcement movement we are facing in this country, making our jobs even more dangerous than it already is – evident by the information released indicating the shooter in Dallas was angered by the incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota this week. Statements, in my opinion, that were irresponsible and very disappointing.\n\nThe emotional response to incidents like Baton Rouge and Falcon Heights continue to shed a very dark light on our profession – events sensationalized by national media when in reality, they are highlighting the bad decisions made by a fraction of a percentage of nearly 1,000,000 dedicated law enforcement officers nationwide - law enforcement officers that have taken on responsibilities and risks in their respective communities that most would never consider. With incidents like Ferguson for example, we often see victims’ families and friends, along with organizations like Black Lives Matter, politicizing these emotional responses nationwide thru social and main stream media within hours of the incident – while law enforcement may need days and weeks to gather all the facts and respond. Facts that often show the officer was reasonable and/or appropriate in his/her actions long after they’ve been convicted guilty by public opinion.\n\nIf I sound a little defensive, it’s because I take great offense when the media and some of our state and national leadership politicize incidents like these - painting our national law enforcement as cold, calculated, racist, uncaring, trigger happy cops. Minnesota has some of the best trained law enforcement in the country – one of the few states requiring a law enforcement degree to be licensed.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, here locally in Dodge County we have an amazing team of men and women serving our community. For example, their dedication evident by the quality and numbers of public comments and commendations warranting Supervisory Letters of Appreciation that we award each year. These are letters are presented to Deputies by their supervisors when they go above and beyond the call, and when the public reaches out to recognize exceptional staff with comments like:\n\n“Your Deputies, Dispatchers, and 1st responders involved my medical emergency were the most compassionate, caring and professional people I’ve ever dealt with….”\n\n“We really appreciate you always stopping in and chatting with staff and customers. We’ve noticed our customers are also becoming more comfortable with the Sheriff’s Office….”\n\n“The kids really appreciated that you took the time to stop and interact and get to know them. These children now have a high respect for you….”\n\nI could not be more proud of the men and women who serve the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office. We recognize here in Dodge County our primary mission is helping people. A mission best accomplished by an agency full of men and women willing to take true ownership in the communities they’re sworn to serve and protect. With this belief we are working hard to continue to hire and maintain staff with that same mentality and ethic. The community’s satisfaction with our staff and our services is the single greatest measure of our success. We will continue to remain positive and professional while proactively and aggressively addressing the problems and challenges our communities face here in Dodge County.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the Dallas Officers who were injured and killed last week.\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nLOGAN'S MESSAGE\n\nJune 2016\n\nYour son is a senior in High School, some of the best years of his life. He is doing very well in school, he’s active in his community, and he’s planning on going into the Marines in the fall. You’ve got a graduation to plan. A Grad Party to get ready for. Your son, who has also been serving as a volunteer fire fighter, has decided to do his senior project on the dangers of distracted or impaired driving. Things couldn’t be better. It’s going to be a great year.\n\nThen you get that phone call….your son is gone.\n\nThe Maas Family in Dodge Center lived this nightmare this year when their son Logan was killed in a car accident last winter. He was not wearing his seatbelt – which would have saved his life.\n\nThe effects of his loss could be seen throughout Triton High School on Sunday June 5th, graduation day. His classmates wore an orange cord in his memory and released orange balloons after the ceremony. His diploma and orange cord were presented to Matt and Julie, his parents. His absence was felt by everyone.\n\nAs the Maas family goes thru the grieving process trying to figure out how to move on with their lives without Logan, one fact is very clear to them – Logan would want them to use his story to remind everyone the importance of seatbelt use. He would want his story to be used to help save lives.\n\nIn 2015, Logan and 90 other unbelted motorists lost their lives on Minnesota Roads. While we have a 94 percent compliance for front seatbelts, we obviously still have a lot of work to do.\n\nLogan was a rear passenger in the vehicle he was riding in. In Minnesota, the seatbelt law is a primary offense, meaning drivers and passengers in all seating positions – including the back seats – must be buckled up or in the correct child restraint:\n\n- All children must be in a child restraint until they are 4’9” tall, or at least age 8\n\n- Newborns to at least 1 year old and 20 pounds must be in a rear facing child seat\n\n- Age 2 until around age 4 should be in a forward facing child seat\n\n- After outgrowing forward facing harness restraints, booster seats should be used\n\nLaw enforcement will be out in force this summer looking for seat belt violators. Drivers will be ticketed for unbelted passengers ages 14 and under. Unbelted passengers age 15 and older will be ticketed directly. We’ve heard all the excuses……\n\nI buckle up most of the time, but not if I am just going a few blocks to the store.\n\nFACT: The majority of motor vehicle crashes occur within 25 miles of home in areas where the speed limit is 40mph or less. A crash at only 12 mph can be fatal.\n\nWe’ll never have a crash – I’m a good driver.\n\nFACT: Good drivers can be hit by bad drivers, distracted drivers, intoxicated drivers, aggressive or inattentive drivers. Wildlife or other sudden hazards may be impossible to avoid.\n\nMy baby was crying, so I was holding her. I could protect her in a crash.\n\nFACT: In a 30 mph crash, a 10 pound baby can suddenly be ripped from a belted adult’s arms with a force of over 300 pounds and launched into the dashboard or windshield. No matter how strong you are, you cannot hold onto a baby in a crash.\n\nI knew someone who died in a car crash because they were wearing their seatbelt.\n\nFACT: If someone wearing their seatbelt dies in a crash, it certainly wasn’t because they were buckled up. The crash was most likely so severe and devastating that only not being in that car at that moment would have prevented a fatality.\n\nThis summer will be a busy one for family and friends – outings with friends, family vacations, working hard and playing hard. Sit down and talk with your family and kids about the importance of seatbelt use and be sure to lead by example and always wear your seatbelt.\n\nLogan’s message: Protect yourself and your family by buckling up – every seat, every time.\n\nPass it on!\n\nYour Sheriff,\n\nScott\n\n*return to column index\n\nWHY WE DO THIS JOB\n\nMay 2016\n\nLaw Enforcement has certainly seen some drastic changes in the past decade or two, even more so in the last few years. Our honorable profession, in many areas of the country, has gone from respected to resented, from thanked to threatened. While this fortunately isn’t an accurate reflection of our county – it is a potential reality our officers and deputies risk every day with every call.\n\nIn the mid 80’s law enforcement agencies like Rochester were getting nearly 400 applicants when they posted for open positions, in the 90’s there were usually over 200 applicants. Today, they may get only 50 applicants for just a handful of openings.\n\nWe’re now seeing officers and families make the decision to change careers due to the current climate and national sentiment by some towards law enforcement – many of these resignations fueled by incidents like Ferguson and others that followed. For example, Colorado Springs Police Department had over 50 resignations last year. Many of those officers, and their families, cited the job had just become too risky.\n\nNearly 1,500 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty during the past 10 years – an average of one death every 60 hours, with 117 killed in the line of duty last year. Nearly 60,000 assaults against law enforcement are reported annually, resulting in around 15,000 injuries.\n\nLaw Enforcement must be willing to work nights, weekends, and holidays. Must be willing to miss special family dates – birthdays, anniversaries, school events, etc. They must be willing to always run towards the threat often risking their lives for people they often don’t even know. They have to be willing to be on heightened alert daily due to the violence against law enforcement nationwide – they need to be on guard and watch their backs both at work and off-duty with their families. Officers need to accept that their families will deal with a tremendous amount of stress with all the negative publicity towards law enforcement. Their kids may likely get teased or worse at school and must know to watch their backs too. Officers must be available at a moment’s notice for emergencies. They must be willing to work under the public microscope every day and know that the actions they take in a split second will be arm-chair quarterbacked by many – lawyers, media, and community. They must understand that they will be held to a higher standard than others both on and off duty. Finally, officers need to know the job will not likely pay enough for them to avoid needing a part-time job to raise a family and make ends meet.\n\nSo the question is – Why do people still sign up for this?\n\nWhile law enforcement in our area and around the state and country will share various reasons for becoming an officer, the common answer is that they genuinely care about people, and want to help people in need. These are the men and women that are successful and survive in this profession. Most have a strong sense of community, and right and wrong. Most also have a strong sense of community. They are truly amazing people!\n\nWe e"
