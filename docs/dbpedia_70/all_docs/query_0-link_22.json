Though not as common, STDs can also be transmitted through intimate physical contact such as heavy petting.\n\nSTDs do not always cause symptoms, or they may only cause mild symptoms. This makes it very possible to have an infection and not know it. Therefore, if you are sexually active it is important to get tested at least once a year. You will find the most common types of STD and STI testing below.\n\nHIV - HIV is a sexually transmitted disease (that can be spread outside of sexual contact) known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is the virus that causes AIDS and interferes with the body's ability to fight infections.\n\nHerpes 1 and 2 - Herpes is an infection caused by HSV (herpes simplex virus). This virus affects the external genital, anal region, mucosal surfaces and skin in other parts of the body. There are two types of herpes simplex viruses: HSV-1 9 herpes type 1, or oral herpes) and HSV-2 (herpes type 2, or genital herpes).\n\nGonorrhea - Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted disease that can cause infections in the genitals, rectum and throat for both men and women. If untreated it can cause serious health issues, however, if it is caught in time it can be cured with the right medicine.\n\nChlamydia - Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease that may not show symptoms. However, those that do show symptoms may experience genital pain and discharge from the vagina or penis. If left untreated it can cause damaging effects to the woman's reproductive system.\n\nSyphilis - Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that develops in different stages. The first stage involves a painless sore on the genitals, rectum or mouth. After that initial sore heals, the second stage is a rash. Then, there are no symptoms until years later which is the final stage - damaged brain, nerves, eyes and/or heart.\n\nMany STDs can be easily cured with medication, so you can just finish your treatment and get on with your life. And even though some STDs can't be cured, there are lots of ways to treat your symptoms and prevent you from giving your STD to anyone you have sex with.\n\nPeople with STDs can be in relationships, have sex, and live totally normal lives. Most people get an STD at least once, and millions are living with STDs now. Having an STD is nothing to feel ashamed of, and it doesn't mean you're \"dirty\" or a bad person , it just means you're a pretty normal human who got an infection. The reality is that STDs can happen to anybody who's ever been sexual with someone, which is almost everybody on earth. And a few STDs can be spread in non-sexual ways, too.\n\nAccredited Drug Testing can schedule your STD test at an Dodge Center, Minnesota testing facility in a confidential, friendly and professional manner.
