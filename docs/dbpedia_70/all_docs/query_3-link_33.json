        "text": "ATCHISON STATE FISHING LAKE - Last Updated: 7/2/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method & Location Black Crappie Fair up to 0.9 lbs For best luck, try a jig and minnow next to rocky areas along the shoreline or near brush piles. Fish may be caught shallower on warm, sunny days. Bluegill Fair to Good up to 0.5 lbs Bluegill can be caught with a nightcrawler under a bobber near brushpiles. Channel Catfish Fair up to 7.7 lbs Channel catfish can be caught from shore using cut shad, dough balls, or chunks of worm. Largemouth Bass Fair to Good up to 2.0 lbs Spinnerbaits or plastics worked around brush piles and rocks. Redear Sunfish Fair up to 0.75 lbs. Redear can be caught jigging a chunk of worm near shoreline structure.

Please do not disturb the plantings.\n\nIf you have information that you would like to contribute to this fishing report, contact Nick Kramer at nick.kramer@ks.gov\n\nCENTRALIA CITY LAKE - Last Updated: 7/2/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method, Location Channel Catfish Good Up to 20 pounds The lake has maintained a great channel cat fishery for over ten years. The 2023 fall sample recorded that the number of channel catfish continue to remain at a high level with fairly good numbers of fish over 20 inches. However, growth of channel catfish has slowed down due to the high numbers of smaller fish so I encourage you to harvest fish less than 24 inches. The creel limit at the lake is 10 channel catfish per day and there is no length based restrictions. Good luck. White Bass Good 1/2 to 1 lb. The most recent fish sampling shows that the white bass population is doing well with the most fish over 12 inches ever recorded at the lake. The size structure is good with a bunch of fish from 11 to 12 inches long and 7% of the ones sampled were over 15 inches. The is no daily creel limit and some harvest would be good for the overall fishery. Wiper Slow Up to 26\" A low population of wipers are maintained with stockings of small fish to help manage the white bass and gizzard shad populations. Recent stockings have not had good survival and wiper numbers have since fallen (which explains the high numbers of white bass right now). Wiper creel limit is 2 per day. Crappie Fair 1/2 to 1 pound \"Crappie aren't what they used to be\" is what I frequently here from anglers about this lake. Such statements are supported by the fish sampling data collected over the last few years as crappie numbers are not at the highs seen from 2013 to 2020 when crappie fishing was hot. Part of this regression is due to competition with much higher numbers of white bass (please feel free to harvest some of them) and partly due to a shift in the population from white crappie to the slower growing black crappie - in the 2023 sample 12% of black crappie were over 8 inches compared to 77% of the white crappie. I assume this will settle back in the next couple of years but either way I would still call this a good crappie lake. No recent reports. Saugeye Fair 2 to 8 lbs. Saugeye are doing well. The fall 2023 fish sampling effort produced the most saugeye in 6 years. Of those fish collected, 20% were over the 18 inch minimum length limit, which is the lowest percentage recorded in 15 years. However, 49% of the fish were 15 to 18 inches long so there are a bunch of upcomers in the system. Largemouth Bass Slow 1/2 to 5 pounds The lake has low numbers of largemouth bass. The 2024 spring sample recorded that 64% of the bass were over 15\". Best places are the rock piers, standing timber and around the West boat ramp. Bass are covered by an 18 inch minimum length limit. General Comments Centralia Lake is a 400 acre lake that is noted for good channel cat, saugeye and crappie fishing. The lake facilities include multiple ramps, picnic tables, plenty of camping pads and many sites with electricity. Centralia is enrolled in the CFAP program, which means a City permit is not required for fishing visits. Perry Reservoir has zebra mussels and with Centralia Lake being close it is at high risk. Please, always clean your boat when moving to different water bodies.\n\nCLINTON RESERVOIR - Last Updated: 7/2/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method, and Location\n\nZebra Mussels are present at Clinton Reservoir\n\nBe sure to CLEAN, DRAIN and DRY all equipment that comes in contact with the water to keep from spreading them to another lake.\n\nCurrent Fishing Conditions Walleye/Saugeye/Sauger Good 15-18 inches Walleye can be found on mudflats or near river channels in 10-20ft. Nightcrawlers rigged with bottom bouncers or jigs with plastics are producing bites. Crappie Good up to 15 inches Crappie can be found on brush piles and timber in deeper water 15 - 25 ft. Jig and small plastics or minnows will produce bites. Largemouth/Smallmouth Bass Good 1-5 lbs Smallmouth Bass can be found on deeper, rock structures. Crayfish imitations will produce bites. Largemouth Bass can be found in flooded terrestrial vegetation. General Comments\n\nNEW BLUE CATFISH REGULATIONS\n\n10 fish daily creel limit, only 1 fish 30\" or longer\n\nFisheries biologists continue to study Kansas blue catfish and the research is showing reservoirs with lower population densities exhibit the best growth rates which equates to greater numbers of larger fish available to anglers. Growth rates of blue catfish are variable across Kansas. Time required for a blue catfish to reach 30 inches is as short as 8 years at Tuttle Creek Reservoir to as long as 14 years at El Dorado Reservoir. Due to the time required to grow to larger sizes, these older and larger fish are quite valuable. Angler harvest is necessary to provide desired densities and harvest should be focused upon smaller blue catfish, especially those in the 18 to 25 inch range while releasing the larger fish to fight again.\n\nWater Level and Discharge: The most recent water level conditions can be found at the following website:\n\nhttps://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/Locations/District-Lakes/Clinton-Lake/Daily-Lake-Info-2/\n\nInvasive Species:\n\nBe sure to Clean, Drain, and Dry your boat when you leave to prevent the spread of Zebra mussels. Do not transport live bait captured from Clinton Reservoir.\n\nFish Habitat:\n\n20 Crappie jacks were placed near Bloomington West Park and should provide good habitat for shore fishing.\n\nDOUGLAS COUNTY-LONE STAR LAKE - Last Updated: 7/12/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Bait, methods, location Channel Catfish Good up to 10lbs Catfish can be caught using stink bait, worms, or cut bait. Largemouth Bass Good up to 6 lbs Bass can be found near aquatic vegetation edges. Larger bass will be on the outside weed lines. Soft plastic baits will produce bites. Topwater baits fished during dawn and dusk can be effective. Bluegill/Redear Sunfish Good Up to 10 inches Sunfish can be found near aquatic vegetation. Bigger sunfish will be on the outside weed line. Worms and small lures will produce bites. Crappie Fair up to 12 inches Crappie can be caught on deep weed edges and brush piles. Minnows and small jigs will produce bites White Bass/Wiper Good up to 8lbs In late evening or early morning, look for white bass chasing shad schools and breaking the surface. Cast top water baits to the schools. General Comments\n\nInvasive Species:\n\nEurasian Water-Milfoil. Lake users should clean, drain, and dry fishing equipment and boats to prevent the spread.\n\nStocking:\n\n30,000 Wiper fry were stocked in May 2024. Wiper provide predatory control on Gizzard Shad. Too many shad can reduce survival of young of year sportfish species that compete for similar resources.\n\n4,875 Channel Catfish were stocked in October 2023.\n\nMost recent fisheries surveys:\n\nBass and sunfish populations were surveyed in May 2024. Both populations are healthy and reproduce naturally.

Others have targeted these fish trolling along the creek channel in the mid-part of the lake. White Bass Fair up to 2.5 lbs. Cast a jig along the rocks or along the dam to target them. Some anglers have been catching a good number of nice sized fish. General Comments\n\nWe will be conducting a creel survey at Banner Creek between March 1 and October 31, 2024. You may be approached by creel clerk and asked about your catch.\n\nThe lake is low, please use caution when boating. The north and south boat ramps have been extended with gravel.\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this fishing report, contact Nick Kramer at nick.kramer@ks.gov\n\nThe locations of fish habitat placed in this lake can be found here\n\nJEFFREY ENERGY CENTER - MAKE-UP LAKE - Last Updated: 6/18/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method, and Location Black Bass Slow 1 to 5 pounds The lake has traditionally had a good smallmouth bass population, but the current population abundance is well below the historical norm. Hopefully, the population rebounds in the near future. The corners of the dam and along the East bank are the best places for smallmouth. The lake has very few largemouth bass. Crappie Fair 1/2 to 1 pound Modest numbers of crappie with 24% 10 inches or bigger. There is a brushpile just south of the fishing dock. Catfish Fair to Good 1/2 to 6 pounds The lake has supported a good channel catfish harvest rate through the years. The southwest corner of the lake and the northern 2 coves tend to be good spots. The lake has a low level blue catfish population with most below 20 inches. The lake is home to some big flathead. If the inlet is flowing, then good fishing can be found there for all three species. Walleye and Sauger Fair 1 to 5 pounds The 2023 fall gill netting and electrofishing samples show the number of walleye is below normal yet most of them are over the 15-inch minimum length limit. Sauger were introduced into the lake in 2021 and have done well so far. The 2023 data shows sauger are already out performing walleye in this lake and growing quickly with 65% exceeding the 15-inch minimum length limit. The two species (walleye & sauger) are combined in KS regulations and an angler can harvest a combined total of 2 per day at the Jeffrey Lakes. Anglers doing fairly well recently. White Bass Fair to Good 1/2 to 2 pounds White bass numbers are suppressed for the second year in a row and fishing success in 2024 will likely not meet the highs this lake is known for but anglers have been doing well this spring catching them. Wipers Fair to Good Up to 12 pounds Wiper numbers are below normal with 69% of the fish collected last fall were less than 20 inches. Fishing for them has been good recently. General Comments\n\nAnglers need to check into the Jeffrey Energy Center Guard House located north of St. Mary's, then west off K-63 Hwy. You can call the Guard House to check on availability at (785) 456-6149. The Jeffrey Energy Center allows 30 anglers to fish at any one time. If the inlet is flowing, then good fishing can usually be found there.\n\nMake-Up Lake has zebra mussels which makes the lake designated as a Aquatic Nuisance Species water. It is illegal to transport alive fish from ANS designated waters. To help prevent the spread of invasive species, please CLEAN, DRAIN & DRY all equipment when changing water bodies and dump your bait.\n\nJEFFREY ENERGY CENTER AUX. LAKE - Last Updated: 6/27/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method, and Location Black Bass Fair 1 to 4 lbs\n\nThe smallmouth bass population is on the rebound. The 2024 sample showed the best smallmouth bass numbers in 8 years with a decent size structure as 45% of the fish were over 14\" and 7% was over 17\". The dam is a great spot to start looking for smallmouth.\n\nThe lake has maintained a moderate to low level largemouth bass population through the years. The 2024 sample shows the population has improved recently, yet is still at a low level. The East bank, South cove, and around the island are usually the best largemouth spots.\n\nWhite Bass Fair Up to 3 lbs The lake has been maintaining a great white bass fishery but the recent sample shows that their abundance has fallen down to modest numbers with most of the fish being young & small. Wiper Good Up to 12 lbs The 2023 wiper numbers are well above average due to high survival from the 2022 stocking. The majority are still small with 71% of the fish collected in October 2023 were less than 16 inches. Fair numbers of bigger wiper are available with 13% from 16\" to 20\" and 16% from 20\" to 24\". Wiper fishing has been great so far this spring! Walleye and Sauger Fair Up to 5 lbs Walleye are maintained through regular stockings and the current population is slightly above average with 83% of the walleye collected being 15 inches or larger. The lake is also home to an emerging sauger population that is growing quickly with 34% of the sauger collected in fall of 2023 were over 15 inches. Walleye and sauger are grouped together in KS regulations and a total of 2 per day can be harvested at the Jeffrey Lakes if they are over the 15-inch minimum length limit. Anglers have been doing well for both species this spring. Crappie Fair Up to 1.5 lbs Crappie numbers have never been robust at this lake but they have been doing better the last few years. The most recent sample had an excellent size structure as 34% was over 12 inches. There is some habitat cubes along the dock and a big brush pile along the point just North of the boat ramp. General Comments\n\nAnglers need to check into the Jeffrey Energy Center Guard House located north of St. Mary's, then west off K-63 Hwy. You can call the Guard House to check on availability at (785) 456-6149. The Jeffrey Energy Center allows 30 anglers to fish at any one time.\n\nAuxiliary Lake has zebra mussels which makes the lake designated as a Aquatic Nuisance Species water.

Bigger sunfish will be on the outside weed line. Worms and small lures will produce bites Walleye/Saugeye Fair up to 20 inches Fish can be found on mudflats or near river channels in 10-20ft. Nightcrawlers rigged with bottom bouncers or jigs with plastics are producing bites. Channel Catfish Good 0.5-10 lbs Catfish can be caught using stink bait, worms, or cut bait. Largemouth/Smallmouth Bass Good Up to 5 lbs. Largemouth Bass can be found near aquatic vegetation edges. Larger bass will be on the outside weed lines. Soft plastic baits will produce bites. Topwater baits fished during dawn and dusk can be effective. Smallmouth can be found on rocky shorelines and steep drop offs. Crayfish imitations will produce bites. White Bass/Wiper Good up to 10 lbs. In late evening or early morning, look for white bass chasing shad schools and breaking the surface. Cast top water baits to the schools. Crappie Fair up to 12 inches Crappie can be caught on deep weed edges and brush piles. Minnows and small jigs will produce bites Trout Poor up to 5lbs Trout can be caught on powerbait, spoons, or rooster tails. Trout Season will run from December 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024. A trout license is required to possess trout during the trout season. After March 31, anyone with a valid fishing license may harvest up to 5 trout/day. General Comments\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nUrban Catfish stocking.

Great place to take a kid with worms and a bobber. Channel Catfish Slow 3/4 to 5 pounds The lake has a low level catfish population. Crappie Fair 1/2 to 1 pound Crappie abundance has been stable the last few years with most 8 to 10 inches long. Largemouth Bass Fair 1/2 to 5 pounds The lake is known for being a good spot for catch and release bass fishing. The 2024 annual sampling effort showed that population has expanded with abundance at a seven year high. This has resulted in the size structure being on the small side with only 16% of the fish over 12 inches. You can catch them pretty much anywhere at this lake. General Comments This small 24 acre lake is similar to pond fishing. The lake is known for catch and release of largemouth bass and harvest of nice bluegill. The lake's channel catfish are protected by a 15 inch minimum length limit.\n\nPOTTAWATOMIE STATE FISHING LAKE NO. 2 - Last Updated: 7/2/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method, and Location Black Bass Fair 1/2 to 4 pounds The 2024 sample records that the black bass population has been holding steady for some time now, with good numbers of largemouth bass and a moderate smallmouth bass population. Channel Catfish Good 3/4 to 5 pounds The lake is in the Urban Stocking Program which provides regular stockings of 12 to 18 inch channel catfish. The third stocking of the year was on June 12th when the lake received 675 pounds of channel catfish. So far the lake has received 3,045 channel catfish in 2024. Best baits tend to be worms or commercial catfish baits. Channel catfish creel at the lake is 5 per day. Crappie Fair 1/4 to 1 pound The lake has supported a decent crappie population through time. The current population is doing ok with slightly below average numbers of fish over 10 inches and a few really big crappie as well. There is some habitat structures just out from the boat ramp dock and under the buoy. Bluegill and Redear Sunfish Fair less than pound The lake has struggled to grow sunfish to a size large enough that anglers want to keep for frying. The population receives high angling pressure from both panfish anglers and from anglers targeting sunfish to use for catfish bait. To hopefully continue to please both angler bases and help increase the overall size structure of sunfish, the lake is being implemented with a special sunfish regulation starting in 2019. This new slot limit requires the release of sunfish species from 6 to 9 inches. The creel limit of fish over 9 inches is five per day and there is still unlimited daily harvest of fish less than 6 inches. This regulation change will be evaluated over time to verify if it will continue into the future.

Fair numbers of 14 to 16 inch saugeye. There is no length based regulations at Rocky Ford for saugeye or walleye. General Comments\n\nRocky Ford , a river fishery, is located just south of the Tuttle Creek Dam on the Big Blue River. Anglers have the opportunity to harvest fishes generally associated with moving water. Saugeye, white bass, the catfishes, drum, crappie and carp can be harvested.

Johnson County fishing/trout permits are available through Johnson County Parks and Recreation District and other select vendors.\n\nWater temperatures should be near 85-86 degrees this weekend\n\nSHAWNEE STATE FISHING LAKE - Last Updated: 7/2/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method, and Location Largemouth Bass Good 1/2 to 6 pounds The lake has provided very good fishing for largemouth bass. The population experienced some rapid expansion a few years age which slowed overall bass growth and reduced the average size of fish. Things are starting to return to normal as the 2024 spring electrofishing sample showed that 54% of the bass were over 12\". Crappie Fair 1/2 to 1 pound The crappie fishery is doing well. The October 2023 fish sampling showed the number of crappie is down but the size is up with 88% over 10 inches. Channel Catfish Good 1/2 - 4 pounds The lake is in the Urban Stocking Program and is regularly stocked with 12 to 18 inch channel catfish which leads to good catch rates of fish in that size range. The third stocking of 2024 went in on May 31st when 700 pounds of channel catfish were released into the lake. The recently stocked fish usually like all the traditional catfish baits but dough baits or worms tends to do the best. Channel catfish daily limit is 5. General Comments\n\nLocated north of Silver Lake, Shawnee State Fishing Lake is the site of good catch and release largemouth bass fishing. The lake is also noted for channel catfish harvest since the lake receives frequent stockings of harvestable sized catfish from March through September. The Jeffrey Energy Center Lakes and Perry Reservoir both have zebra mussels and with Shawnee State Lake being close it is at high risk. Please, always clean your boat when moving to different water bodies.\n\nFish habitat GPS coordinates Decimal Degrees Degrees Minutes East end of dam cedar trees 39.200351 -95.801881 N 39 12.021 W 95 48.113 West end of dam cedar trees 39.200640 -95.805438 N 39 12.038 W 95 48.326 Out from ramp brush pile 39.201053 -95.801924 N 39 12.063 W 95 48.115\n\nTUTTLE CREEK - Last Updated: 7/2/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method, and Location Crappie Fair 1/2 to 2 pounds The lake has provided excellent crappie fishing the last few years due to good spawning success and robust summer growth. The 2023 fall sample shows that numbers of crappie over 10-inches is still above the long-term average for the lake. In addition, the 2023 spawn was very successful in producing another strong year-class of crappie. Can be found in standing timber around about 10' down. White Bass Fair 1/2 to 2 pounds White bass numbers have been low due to limited spawning success for most of the last decade. The species did produce a robust spawn in 2021 which has helped bolster the fishery as the 2023 sample had the most white bass over 12-inches in nine years. I wouldn't call the fishery good yet but it is much improved and hopefully this trend will continue. Channel Catfish Fair Good numbers of 24-28\" fish with fair numbers of bigger ones.\n\nThe lake and the connected river system has maintained a good channel catfish population through the history of the lake and has been one of the best places around to catch channel cats over 8 pounds. The fishery was underperforming from 2013 to 2020 but has rebounded and been doing well the last three years. The 2023 sample recorded that 19% of the channel catfish were above 24-inches, which is the highest percentage seen in a decade. Fishing in the upper end of the lake and the river tends to be the most consistent spots for channel cats.\n\nK-State is conducting a study to track fish movements and there are a few channel catfish with a purple tag in their back - please release all fish with a purple tag.\n\nBlue Catfish Fair to Good Lots of fish from 20\" to 30\" and seeing a few fish getting over 40 pounds\n\nBlue catfish are finally well established in the lake and population expansion has slowed down. The lake will likely never have as high numbers of blue cats as other KS lakes but this allows for good growth and a plus size range of fish. Summer sampling in 2023 showed that 61% of the blue catfish were from 20-inches to 30-inches and 19% were over 30-inches. Fresh cut bait or fresh shad is the best baits, near drop-offs this time of year.\n\nNew harvest regulations for blue catfish starting in 2022: 10 fish daily creel limit which may include only one fish 30 inches or longer.\n\nPlease check any blue catfish for a yellow or orange tag in its back as we have been tagging fish to collect more information on the species in Tuttle Creek Lake. It is up to you if you wish to release the fish or harvest it (if legally applicable), but please report the tag number and the general location of the catch to (620) 342-0658 or ely.sprenkle@ks.gov We also have a few fish with a purple tag that have a transmitter for tracking their movements, PLEASE RELEASE FISH WITH A PURPLE TAG. A big THANK YOU to all who report their catch!\n\nLargemouth Bass Slow to Fair 1 to 5 pounds Coves in southern third of the Reservoir have some locally good largemouth bass populations. The McIntyre Cove area tends to produce the best fishing with Carnahan Cove second best. Saugeye Fair Up to 6 pounds\n\nThe last two years has been good saugeye fishing at Tuttle Creek. The 2023 fall gill net sample produced the most saugeye in a decade with 38% of those fish over the 15\" minimum length limit. No recent reports.\n\nSince saugeye like to leave Tuttle Creek through the dam downstream, some of the best opportunities to harvest saugeye is in the River Pond or Rocky Ford or at the \"tubes\". Great shoreline access at all of these spots and fish are regularly being caught year-round.\n\nK-State is conducting a study to track fish movements and there are a few saugeye with a purple tag in their back - please release all fish with a purple tag.\n\nGeneral Comments\n\nWater level are on the rise and has made fishing challenging lately with some floating debris.\n\nYou can check current water conditions HERE\n\nTuttle Creek has zebra mussels which makes the lake, the River Pond and Rocky Ford designated as Aquatic Nuisance Species waters.

Fish have moved deeper with the warm water. Look for fish in deeper structure and at Rea Bridge. Minnows and small plastic jigs have been working best. Channel Catfish Good 16-24\" Catfishing is good. Look for catfish to be more actively feeding during the evening and after dark. Also target the windward side of the lake for best results. Shad sides are the preferred bait. Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass Fair 12-20\" Largemouth bass fishing has slowed. Look for largemouth to be near deeper structure with the warm water. Smallmouth bass will be near rocky shorelines and the dam. Jigs have been working best. Bluegill and Redears Fair 5-7\" Bluegill and redear fishing has been fair. Bluegill and redear can be found near any submerged vegetation and woody structure. Worms under a bobber are working best. General Comments Release all Largemouth Bass 15-21\" in Length, daily creel remains 5/day.\n\nBONE CREEK RESERVOIR - Last Updated: 8/6/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method & Location Bluegill & Redear Sunfish Good 4-8 inches 7-9-inch bluegill and redear sunfish were observed in the shallows less than 4' of water in between the shoreline and the aquatic vegetation edge. Anglers should focus their efforts along the shoreline in depths less than 6' deep near submerged trees and edges of aquatic vegetation. Areas to pursue will be on the north and south ends of the dam, coves, and rocky habitats. A bobber and worm, fly rod with small flies, and 1/16 ounce jig with a twister tail will be good baits to try. Channel catfish Good 15-36 inches Anglers have reported channel catfish being caught in the coves and creek arms. Anglers from the shoreline should focus on the coves, both the north and south side of the dam, west end, and the handicap access on the south side of the lake near the boat ramp. Prepared baits, worms, cut or live bait will be good baits to try. Anglers from boats should focus on flats and near rock habitat. Cut and live bait are good baits to try. Black Crappie Fair 8-14 inches Anglers reported catching crappie 6'-10' of water from 10-14 inches. Anglers should focus on submerged trees that are in 15-20' that are in close proximity to depth changes, or creek channels, during all times of the year. Live minnows under a bobber, spinners, or 1/8-1/16 ounch jigs with twister tails will all be good options. Fall sampling indicated a successful spawn and strong 2023 year class of Age-0 (2-3\"), another 2022 year class of Age-1 crappie (9-9.5\"), as well as crappie up to 14\". Black Crappie are growing to 9.5 inches at the end of their second growing season, whereas in 2012, it took 6 years to reach 10-inches in Bone Creek. Largemouth bass Good\n\n23% 8-12\"\n\n26% 12-15\"\n\n51% 15-20\"\n\nLargemouth bass can be found lakewide in a variety of habitats that are available at Bone Creek. Recent electrofishing surveys for Largemouth Bass indicated a more balanced population of fish from 4-inches to 20-inches being observed. Each year class from 2016 to 2023 were observed during this effort. The population has improved in the last four years with recruitment being observed and strong year classes each in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. Anglers should focus on the edges of vegetation that can be found along the shoreline and coves, as well as along the bank in vegetation and flooded terrestrial vegetation with the lake levels reaching full pool. There is an abundance of submerged trees in a range of depths that will also hold fish. The water clarity will affect fishing, depending on time of day, so don't hesitate to fish the trees that can be found in deeper water. Casting swimbaits, jigs, jerkbaits, and spinnerbaits will be your best bet. Don't hesitate to throw the classic \"ned rig\" in the summertime when fish will be deeper and provide a chance at a strike.\n\nTo bolster the current population and recruitment of Largemouth Bass at Bone Creek, the KDWP fisheries biologist has increased stocking efforts of Largemouth Bass. In 2019, 218, 377 (fry) were stocked when a hatchery surplus was available. In 2021, 13,500 phase II advanced fingerling Largemouth Bass were stocked. In April 2022, 260,000 (fry) were stocked when a hatchery surplus was available. In June 2022, 25,000 advanced fingerling Largemouth Bass were stocked. In June 2023, 25,000 advanced fingerling Largemouth Bass were stocked. During the week of and on June 4, 2024, 27,000 advanced fingerling Largemouth Bass were stocked into flooded habitat and aquatic vegetation. In total, 569,774 largemouth bass have been stocked since 2018.\n\nThe KDWP fisheries biologist plans to request 27,000 phase II advanced fingerling Largemouth Bass in upcoming years to help bolster year classes and recruitment of Largemouth Bass. This is being evaluated with genetic fin clips to assess stock contribution. In addition to, it was proposed and passed to move from a 13-18\" slot length limit to an 18\" minimum length limit to protect the stocked fingerlings and naturally spawned Largemouth Bass to preferred lengths for bass anglers. This went into effect on January 1, 2022.\n\nSaugeye Good 19-26 inches\n\nSaugeye can be found on flats of 10-14 ft that is near deeper water of 20 feet and deeper at this time of the year. Any depth changes, or structure, will hold fish and can be caught by a variety of methods, such as trolling or vertical jigging. Anglers have reported catching saugeye near the dam on the east side of the lake on swimbaits, jigheads with plastics, and trolling crankbaits.\n\nThe minimum length for Saugeye at Bone Creek is 18 inches and a daily creel of 5 fish per day!\n\nGeneral Comments\n\nWater Temperature: 86° F, August 6, 2024\n\nBe sure to Clean, Drain, and Dry your boat, bait buckets, and recreational watercraft before and after launching your boat.

Use spinners, plastic baits, crankbaits. Some fish are in deeper water breaks. Bluegill/redear sunfish Good all sizes Its spawning time. Nice redear sunfish are available by slow fishing along the piers with jig, worm under a float. Walleye/Saugeye Slow varies Fish drop offs and at the head of the inflow areas using crank baits, jigs and or minnow Channel Catfish Excellent 12-22 inches Use just about any catfish bait, cut bait, stink baits, chicken liver, worms, the fish feeders are ON. After hard rains fish the south end where the water comes in. Fish the creek mouth where the fresh water comes in and the fish are stacked up. We recently restocked channel catfish so the density is really high. Remember the length limit is 15 inches and the creel limit is 2 per person Crappie Poor 8 - 12 inches and up Try using minnows, jigs under a 5ft float, along the piers. General Comments\n\nZebra Mussels have recently been found in Hillsdale Lake, and Linn Valley, Linn County, (Private Lake Development), we'd like to remind you to \" Clean, drain and dry\"\n\nThe water level is full and ready to fish. Recently several hundred trees were placed in the lake to improve fish habitat.\n\nShoreline fishing can be good in deeper water around the lake. Fish attracting habitat have been placed along the shoreline to attract fish and improve shoreline angling. This lake produces some nice crappie each year. Recent sampling indicates that there are many good crappie to catch. The bass population at this impoundment consists of spotted and largemouth bass. Spotted bass tend to hang near rocks and the dam, whereas on the south end of the lake your more likely to catch only largemouth bass.\n\nCOFFEY COUNTY LAKE - Last Updated: 7/26/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Methods, Locations largemouth bass Slow 8 in to 21 inches Vibrating jigs, spinnerbaits, crankbaits, swimbaits or jerkbaits fished around structure. Flutter spoons or large plastic worms rigged on shaky heads fished off of points and ledges. Quality fish are present but numbers remain low. walleye Fair 14-25 inches Fish should be on rocky points, humps, or drop offs. Fish can be caught with jig and plastic, crankbaits, or drifting a jig and crawler on bottom bouncers channel catfish/blue catfish Good 1/2-5 lbs, Blues up to 50lbs. Various prepared baits, liver, and worms usually good for channel catfish lakewide. Using fresh cut bait such as shad or carp usually is best for blue catfish. Fishing wind blown banks or up in the riprap should be productive or try creek channel swings and humps. Don't be afraid to fish shallow water for both species. smallmouth bass Slow-Fair 10-20 inches Throwing small shad imitators like compact spinnerbaits or crankbaits. Crayfish imitating baits should also work. Ned rigs or drop shots are great techniques to use for smallmouth. Fishing these baits around the deeper rip rap banks or rocky points are probably the best spots. Recent sampling continues to show a lower density population. white bass/Wipers Good up to 5lbs. Using small shad imitating baits such as small crankbaits, bucktail jigs, slab spoons, or twister tail grubs fished on wind blown points or rocky banks near deep water. Small topwater poppers will work around the same areas as fish are feeding on shad. Vertical jigging a spoon or jigging rap is an excellent technique once you find a big school. crappie Fair 11-15 inches Crappie will be out in deeper water near structure such as standing timber or creek channel bends and dropoffs. Using jig and plastics or minnows should work. General Comments\n\nEntrance gate phone number is 620-364-2475 call for lake conditions\n\nFishing near the warm water outlet during the fall and winter can be very productive for multiple species.\n\nA large brush pile was created north of the boat ramp in the old creek channel and is marked with a fish attractor buoy. There were also several trees sunk at the end of the hot water dike and should be easily marked on your locator. These spots should be really good in the fall and winter months.\n\nZEBRA MUSSELS have been confirmed in Coffey County Lake! Please help stop the spread. Clean, Drain, and Dry your boat and livewell after leaving this lake. It is illegal to transport live fish, bait, and water from this lake.\n\nCRAWFORD STATE FISHING LAKE - Last Updated: 8/6/2024 Print\n\nSpecies Rating Size Baits, Method &Location Bluegill / Redear sunfish Good 4-8\" Bluegill can be caught using a bobber and worm, 1/16-1/32 ounce jighead, and a fly rod and small fly. Locations to try would be near the swim beach in the northwest corner, main lake coves, and marina cove. Saugeye Fair 18-21\" The fall sample indicated a low-density, high-quality population of saugeye up to 21\". A variety of ways to target saugeye are trolling with swimbaits and Rapalas, or vertical jigging. Anglers can also find saugeye up shallow in the fall, winter, and spring when water temperatures are cooler and where they can be found feeding on the flats and shallow habitat. Wiper (White bass x Striped Bass hybrid) Fair 18-24\" Wiper have been stocked in Crawford State Lake and provide a quality sportfish for anglers to target. Wipers are pelagic, or open water, predators lurking in deeper water during the day, but come up shallow to feed in the morning, evening, and during the night. Some baits to try would be jerkbaits, swimbaits, jigs, and live bait. Trolling and vertical jigging over schools of gizzard shad may yield a fish, or two. The fall sample indicated good numbers above the 18\" minimum length limit and a quality population for anglers to utilize. Channel catfish Good 16-24\" Channel catfish can be found throughout all portions of the lake. Anglers can target in coves on the upper end of the lake, especially during periods of inflow, main lake where submerged trees and Georgia Cubes have been placed, and jetties and docks that can be fished from shore. Prepared baits, gizzard shad, live bait, and chicken liver are all popular baits that anglers might give a try. Flathead catfish Good All sizes Flathead catfish can be found in deep water next to submerged trees and structure. Live bait, such as green sunfish, and artificial lures are two types of fishing to try. There have been reports of flathead catfish being caught up to 30 lbs. Crappie Good 6-10\" The crappie population has a slightly improved size structure with fish sampled up to 12\". There is a 2021 year class of Black Crappie that are reaching lengths up to 12 inches, a 2022 year class of Black Crappie that are up to 9 inches, and another 2023 year class of Black Crappi"
