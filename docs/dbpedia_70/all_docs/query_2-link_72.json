        "text": "So the Dodge Journey has the \"pop up\" door lock indicator, which I believe are mechanically connected to the lock, like in the \"good old days\", so this may have been a case of the driver panicking. And all cars these days release the lock when you pull on the handle, but I don't know if it is a mechanical or electronic interface, probably varies highly by make and model. I need to take a closer look at my own cars. You would think FMVSS would require you to be able to unlock the door without power, but I seem to recall Teslas having a similar issue when the 12V battery goes out.\n\nWhy would this be just limited to Dodge Journey's, or is it? Could this also apply to a lot of other vehicles, particularly newer EV's if there is no actual mechanical linkage between the inside door handle and the door latching mechanism?\n\nIt seems like such a basic safety consideration and in emergencies, there certainly should be some kind of an actual mechanical linkage to be able to open the doors from inside, because you can't always depend on that there will be electrical power.\n\nI found this article about other vehicles and how to open the doors from the inside in emergencies.\n\nIn other words, you really need to be familiar with your vehicle and how to open the doors in case of an emergency.\n\nThe owner’s manual for the Audi E-Tron says its doors can be opened mechanically by pulling the handle “forcefully” and “beyond its noticeable resistance” twice.\n\nFor BMW vehicles, a manual door release is located below the unlock button, near the storage pocket.\n\nIn the Chevrolet Corvette and the discontinued Cadillac XLR, both from General Motors, the emergency door releases are on the floor between the doors and the sills of the car. Pull up the lever and the door will open. “If an owner is having an issue with their electronic door latches, they should consult their local Chevrolet dealer,” a spokesperson told CR.\n\nIn the Ford Mustang Mach-E, there’s a manual door release inside the door armrest. Pull it back and the door will open.\n\nIn the Genesis G90, pull the emergency open lever under the door pocket twice to open the door.\n\nThe Lexus Digital Latch can be overridden by pulling the door lever toward you twice instead of pushing it once. A Lexus spokesperson told CR that all four doors have an override.\n\nThe Lincoln Continental has an emergency door release lever at the front of the storage pocket at the bottom of the door.\n\nLucid says to pull the interior handle even further to release the door manually. This may take some effort.\n\nMaserati has an emergency release handle inside the front door pocket, below the door handle.\n\nHow to Escape Your Car If the Electronic Door Handle Fails - Consumer Reports\n\nFrom Tesla to Lexus, more and more vehicles have doors with an electronic button instead of a manual latch. Consumer Reports lets you know how to open them in an emergency."
