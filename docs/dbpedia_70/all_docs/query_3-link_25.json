        "text": "If you have health insurance, it's best to first contact your insurance provider. Many insurance providers offer price estimates for your out-of-pocket costs based on your plan's specific benefits. Also, your insurance provider may be able to estimate the cost for all your care – including hospital, physician and other associated charges. Your insurance provider may also have information to help you compare price and quality measures for all the healthcare providers available in your plan.\n\nUnityPoint Health personalized out-of-pocket cost estimates (price estimates) are available based on your specific planned services and insurance plan. To request a cost estimate, call (833) 23-PRICE. You may also submit an online estimate request.\n\nUnityPoint Health – Meriter Patients: Call (608) 417-5030 for a cost estimate or submit an online estimate request.\n\nWe’re committed to providing you with information about your estimated out-of-pocket cost as you make healthcare decisions. UnityPoint Health has agreements with many insurance companies that determine the amount we’re paid. Our financial clearance teams will verify your insurance coverage and benefits, including your plan's required co-payments, deductible cost, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket cost specified in your plan. We can also discuss your payment options.\n\nSelf-service cost estimates (price estimates) for many common non-emergency procedures and services are now available. UnityPoint Health has a new user-friendly tool to help estimate your likely out-of-pocket costs for many common healthcare procedures (for example, abdominal surgery, joint surgery, obstetric care) and services (such as CT, MRI or ultrasound imaging or laboratory services). The tool is available as part of MyUnityPoint, our patient portal.\n\nHaving a general idea of your costs for a variety of common healthcare procedures and services (such as medical imaging and laboratory costs) through a self-service tool may be useful to you as you plan for upcoming non-emergency care. This self-service price estimating tool is available 24/7.\n\nIf you’re not insured or think you'll need help paying your bill, please call (844)-849-1260.\n\nUnityPoint Health has financial assistance policies to assist patients who cannot pay for some or all of their care. Our financial counselors can also help determine if you’re eligible for other coverage or benefits.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require hospitals to provide a listing of their current standard charges, including a description for the item or service associated with each charge, for every item and service provided by the hospital. CMS additionally requires hospitals to list their standard charges by Diagnosis-Related Group (DRGs).\n\nUnityPoint Health supports the intent of these requirements and the need to provide accessible information to patients about the cost of healthcare services. However, it's important to note these numbers do not represent what patients may truly owe after a hospital stay or other service.\n\nA hospital's charges are based on its unique range of services, adoption of new medical technologies, government funding level, patient demographics and other local and regional factors. There’s also a difference between \"charges\" and \"costs\".\n\nCharges are the full retail price for hospital or hospital outpatient services.\n\nThe discount price is a lower rate that may be negotiated with payers (\"contractual rate\" or \"allowable rate\") or with patients (\"self-pay discounts\").\n\nThe final patient cost is the patient's financial responsibility (your cost for services based on your benefit coverage and the discounted price).\n\nThe charges shown below do not represent payments or any specific/individual patient responsibility. Your financial responsibility will vary depending on your health insurance plan. Also, fees for doctor services or anesthesia administration aren’t reflected in this list and will be billed separately by your doctor.\n\nPlease view the charge information for your local hospital below.\n\nWhen you receive emergency care or are treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you’re now protected from surprise billing or balance billing.\n\n\"Out-of-network\" means providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan. Out-of-network providers may be permitted to bill you for the difference between what your plan agreed to pay and the full amount charged for a service. This is called \"balance billing.” This amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward your annual out-of-pocket limit.\n\n\"Surprise billing\" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can't control who’s involved in your care — like when you have an emergency, or when you schedule a visit at an in-network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network provider.\n\nPlease review the document below, in English or Spanish, to learn more about how you’re protected from surprise medical bills and who to contact if you believe you've been wrongly billed.\n\nYour Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills (English and Spanish)"
