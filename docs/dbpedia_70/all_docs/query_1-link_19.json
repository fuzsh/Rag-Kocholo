People of Hispanic or Latino origin account for 15.79% of the cityâ€™s residents. Important ancestries of people in Dodge Center include German, Norwegian, Irish, English, and Swedish.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Dodge Center is English. Other important languages spoken here include Spanish and Tagalog.\n\nThe Neighbors\n\nThere are two complementary measures for understanding the income of a neighborhood's residents: the average and the extremes. While a neighborhood may be relatively wealthy overall, it is equally important to understand the rate of people - particularly children - who are living at or below the federal poverty line, which is extremely low income. Some neighborhoods with a lower average income may actually have a lower childhood poverty rate than another with a higher average income, and this helps us understand the conditions and character of a neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the neighborhood in Dodge Center are upper-middle income, making it an above average income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis reveals that this neighborhood has a higher income than 69.1% of the neighborhoods in America. In addition, 9.8% of the children seventeen and under living in this neighborhood are living below the federal poverty line, which is a lower rate of childhood poverty than is found in 51.2% of America's neighborhoods.\n\nWhat we choose to do for a living reflects who we are. Each neighborhood has a different mix of occupations represented, and together these tell you about the neighborhood and help you understand if this neighborhood may fit your lifestyle.\n\nIn the neighborhood, 32.6% of the working population is employed in manufacturing and laborer occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is executive, management, and professional occupations, with 31.6% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants (17.1%), and 16.7% in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is the shared learned behavior of peoples. Undeniably, different ethnicities and ancestries have different cultural traditions, and as a result, neighborhoods with concentrations of residents of one or another ethnicities or ancestries will express those cultures. It is what makes the North End in Boston so fun to visit for the Italian restaurants, bakeries, culture, and charm, and similarly, why people enjoy visiting Chinatown in San Francisco.\n\nIn the neighborhood in Dodge Center, MN, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as German (37.7%). There are also a number of people of Norwegian ancestry (20.1%), and residents who report Mexican roots (11.0%), and some of the residents are also of Irish ancestry (5.7%), along with some English ancestry residents (5.2%), among others.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nEven if your neighborhood is walkable, you may still have to drive to your place of work. Some neighborhoods are located where many can get to work in just a few minutes, while others are located such that most residents have a long and arduous commute. The greatest number of commuters in neighborhood spend under 15 minutes commuting one-way to work (34.1% of working residents), one of the shortest commutes across America.\n\nHere most residents (76.5%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors to get to work (13.2%) . In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
