        "text": "The Regional Traffic Counts Database is SEMCOG's central repository for traffic counts in the Southeast Michigan region. Traffic counts in this database were collected and provided to SEMCOG by county road commissions, local communities in Southeast Michigan, the Michigan Department of Transportation, and by consultants specializing in traffic data collection. Each count was taken during a continuous 24-hour period. The initial search results show the most recent Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) for the given location for the stated year. AADT are traffic volumes that are adjusted by a month and day of week factor to account for seasonal variations in traffic. By clicking on a AADT hyperlink, you will leave SEMCOGâ€™s website and will be directed to a more detailed report containing the AADT, Raw Traffic Count, and other information.\n\nSeasonal adjustment factors are used to calculate average annual daily traffic (AADT) from short duration vehicle counts. These seasonal factors were developed using the Permanent Traffic Recorders (PTR) located in Southeast Michigan. The factors were averaged from each of these locations, thus resulting in adjustment factors by year and month for each day of the week. These adjustment factors can be applied to the raw counts in Southeast Michigan. An estimated AADT is produced by multiplying the factors times the raw counts. Click seasonal adjustment factors to download the factors."
