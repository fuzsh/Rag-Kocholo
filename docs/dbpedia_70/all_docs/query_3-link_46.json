        "text": "Summary\n\nThe most deadly tornado to ever strike within the borders of the state of Oklahoma occurred on Wednesday, April 9, 1947 in the city of Woodward. The Woodward tornadic storm began in the Texas Panhandle during the afternoon of April 9, 1947, and produced at least six tornadoes along a 220 mile path that stretched from White Deer, TX (northeast of Amarillo) to St. Leo, KS (west of Wichita).\n\nThe tornado that would strike Woodward began near Canadian, TX. Moving northeast, it continued on the ground continuously for about 100 miles, ending in Woods County, Oklahoma, west of Alva. The tornado was massive, up to 1.8 miles wide, and traveled at forward speeds of about 50 miles per hour. It first struck Glazier and Higgins in the Texas Panhandle, devastating both towns and producing at least 69 fatalities in Texas before crossing into Oklahoma. In Ellis County, Oklahoma, the tornado did not strike any towns, passing to the southeast of Shattuck, Gage, and Fargo. Even though no towns were struck, nearly 60 farms and ranches were destroyed and 8 people were killed with 42 more injured. Moving into Woodward County, one death was reported near Tangier.\n\nThe violent tornado (F5 on the Fujita Scale) unleashed its worst destruction on Woodward, striking the city without warning at 8:42 pm. Over 100 city blocks on the west and north sides of the city were destroyed with lesser damage in the southeast portion of the town. Confusion and fires reigned in the aftermath with over 1000 homes and businesses destroyed, at least 107 people killed in and around Woodward, and nearly 1000 additional injuries. Normal communications between Woodward and the outside world were not restored for some time and there was great uncertainty as to victim status. In fact, the bodies of three children were never identified, and one child who survived the tornado was lost and never reunited with her family. Help for Woodward came from many places, including units from as far away as Oklahoma City and Wichita. Beyond Woodward, the tornado lost some intensity, but still destroyed 36 homes and injured 30 people in Woods County before ending.\n\nIn all, at least 116 lives were lost in Oklahoma on that fateful night. Never before or since has a tornado been so costly to human life in the Sooner State. Because of the Woodward tornado and other devastating tornadoes in the late 1940's and early 1950's, and because of new technologies available after World War II, the Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) began a tornado watch and warning program in 1953. During the last five decades, the warning system composed of the National Weather Service, local civil preparedness agencies, and the media has continued to mature and provide better and better information to citizens to help them protect themselves from tornadoes. Because of the strengths of the warning system, tornado death tolls in Oklahoma, and nationwide, have dropped considerably with each passing decade and, hopefully, will continue to decrease.\"\n\nNow with Doppler radar coverage of Woodward from Norman, Dodge City, and an Air Force AFB NEXRAD located northwest of Enid in Alfalfa County...Woodward is better protected than it ever has been. Doppler radar technology has dramatically improved the warning process...and it is probable that a storm like the Woodward tornado of 1947 would be warned on well in advance by the National Weather Service.\n\n- Donald W. Burgess, formerly with the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL)\n\nOriginal U.S. Weather Bureau Summary for the April 9, 1947 Woodward, OK Tornado\n\nNote: The original summary for the April 9, 1947 Woodward tornado was based upon a four-day investigation of the tornado damage in the Texas Panhandle and northwestern Oklahoma by three U.S. Weather Bureau (USWB) meteorologists. These meteorologists were: Vernon W. Schaad, MIC (Meteorologist in Charge) at the USWB office at Fort Worth, TX; J. R. Lloyd, MIC at the USWB office in Kansas City, MO; and Henry C. Winburn, MIC at the USWB office in Amarillo, TX. This narrative was part of the monthly climate summary for Oklahoma for April 1947 and has been repoduced below.\n\nBased upon their investigation and initial research, the Woodward tornado was originally thought to have a path length of 221 miles through the Texas Panhandle, northwestern Oklahoma, and southern Kansas. However, independent research conducted by both Don Burgess of the NSSL and Tom Grazulis of the Tornado Project indicated that it may have been the second tornado in a series of at least 6 tornadoes.\n\nThe Woodward Tornado of April 9, 1947\n\nThis tornado was considered to be the longest, widest, and most destructive ever to have occurred in this section of the country. The tornado ripped through three states in a 221 mile long path, leaving in its wake 169 killed, 980 injured, and a property damage of about $9,700,000.\n\nThe tornado originated about 5:42 p. m. CST, April 9, 1947, 1-2 miles SE of White Deer, Texas. The storm moved northeastward, passing 5 mi. NW of Pampa at 6:05 p. m., 3 mi. NW of Canadian, through Glazier about 7:22 p. m., and through Higgins, about 7:45 p. m. It entered Ellis Co., Oklahoma, about 8:00. p. m., following a path which took it 4 mi. SE of Shattuck, 4 mi. NW of Arnett, 3 mi SE of Gage at 8:13 p, m., and 2 miles SE of Fargo. Moving into Woodward Co., the storm struck Woodward at 8:43 p. m. From Woodward the tornado continued its northeastward course through Woodward and Woods Counties, finally leaving Oklahoma about 10:00 p. m., not far from Hardtner, Kansas. Between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p. m., CST, the tornado passed through Barber Co., Kansas, and into Kingman Co., where it dissipated after causing some damage at St. Leo, 6 miles north of Nashville, Kansas. The rate of forward movement, 42 mi. per hr. The width of the path was 250 yds. near White Deer, 1.5 mi. at Higgins, 1.8 mi. at Woodward, and 1.0 mi. from Woods Co. to the point of dissipation.\n\nThe area affected by the tornado, during the period prior to the onset of the storm, was in the apex of the warm sector of a low pressure system centered in southern Colorado at 6:30 p.m. CST, April 9; the center moving to near Wichita by 12:30 a. m., April 10. On the 6:30 p. m. map, a cold front was indicated as extending SSW from the center along the western edge of the Texas Panhandle. By midnight the front had moved eastward, and was indicated as a cold front aloft through central Kansas, through Enid, Okla., just west of Fort Sill, and to a point south of Big Spring, Texas. Southerly, gusty surface winds, 30-40 mph, with low clouds were noted in the area. Winds aloft at Amarillo at 4:00 p. m. were southerly from 53 to 61 mph at levels from 4 to 7 thousand feet MSL.\n\nFew reports were received from persons actually observing the tornado cloud due to fog, low clouds, and darkness. Observers saw the tornado as it formed near White Deer, and the Weather Bureau observer at Pampa noted the cloud when it was north of his station. The roar of the tornado as it passed 3-5 mi. to the south could be heard at the Gage station. Near Gage the funnel shaped cloud was seen during lightning flashes. The tornado caused marked dips in the barograph traces at both Pampa and Gage. The cooperative observer at Arnett, 4 mi. to the south at the storm path, heard the tornado roaring but was unable to see it because of the low clouds. Observers at Woodward reported hearing the tornado, comparing its sound to the roar of a fast freight or express train.\n\nLoss of 1ife totaled 169; 101 being killed in Oklahoma and 68 in Texas. According to the American Red Cross 95 persons lost their lives at Woodward and 6 in Ellis Co. In Glazier, 17 were killed and in Higgins 51. 782 injured were counted in Oklahoma and 198 in Texas. The Red Cross reported a total of 626 houses destroyed and 920 damaged as follows: Oklahoma, Woodward Co., 430 destroyed, 650 damaged; Ellis Co., 52 destroyed, 133 damaged; Woods Co., 25 destroyed, 20 damaged; Texas: Lipscomb Co., 83 destroyed, 116 damaged; Hemphill Co., 36 destroyed and 1 damaged.\n\nThe tornado struck Woodward in the early part of the night, when numerous families or members of families were away from home. Many returned to find their homes completely destroyed or badly damaged. Some families, like that of the local Weather Observer, escaped injury by taking refuge in their storm cellars. Miraculous escapes were many, while in other cases most if not all members of the family were either killed or injured. Confusion among separated families was rampant. Weather conditions added to the misery or the homeless and the task of relief workers as temperatures dropped into the 30s and 40s and cold rain changed to snow on the 12th and l3th.\n\nTotal property damage for the three States was estimated at $9,700,000. Losses to property were principally to buildings, although many livestock, fences, telegraph wires, automobiles, and farm machinery were destroyed. Damage estimates by County Agents in Oklahoma were: Woodward Co., $6,608,750; Ellis Co., 1,264,000; and Woods Co., $150,000; making the total loss in Oklahoma around 8,022,750. Total property damage was estimated at $1,505,000 in Texas, and $200,000 in Kansas.\n\nFires broke out in a number of places, and were difficult to control due to loss of water supply and lack of help. Persons were mostly concerned with taking care of the dead and injured. A downpour of rain for about 15 minutes shortly after the storm moved on helped suppress the fires at Woodward. The tornado destroyed the equipment for the local weather station, but the amount of rainfall was estimated by the observer at 0.50 inch. Rain and snow on the 12-13th added to damage of property remaining unprotected.\n\nIn Woodward over a hundred city blocks were demolished. Practically all of Higgins and Glazier were destroyed. For the entire storm between 4,000 and 4,000 buildings of all kinds, including homes, were either destroyed or damaged.\n\nWeather Bureau Officials, Messrs. Lloyd, Schaad, and Winburn, who investigated the tornado, indicated that the path of the tornado at Woodward measured 1.8 mi. wide, one of the widest tornado paths of record. Measurements of the distance from the right hand edge of the tornado, where structural damage began, to the center of the core of the tornado was 1.1 mi. From the center of the core to the left hand edge of the zone of destruction was determined at 0.7 mi. On the extreme right hand edge of the zone of destruction the debris lay almost parallel to the path of the tornado. Moving in toward the center of the core, directly across the path of the tornado, the angle at which the debris lay gradually shifted, as the forward ends of trees, boards, etc., were inclined more to the left. At the right hand edge of the core the debris lay due north-south; and in the core itself, the debris was in a tangled masa with the bulk of it at right angles or nearly right angles to the path.
