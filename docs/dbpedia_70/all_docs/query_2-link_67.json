        "text": "For years, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has been renowned in the market for its elegant design and capable performance. By mixing luxury with adventure, they appeal to road trip seekers and trend setters alike. Jeep began a new trend with the release of its Grand Cherokee L in 2021. This larger counterpart to the beloved Grand Cherokee adds a third row, offering more space and additional carrying capacity. Below we will dive into the differences between these two models, focusing on exterior, interior space, and the car seat tilt feature. Our goal at Jeff Belzer’s is to provide you with the information needed to make an informed decision based on your needs and lifestyle. Let’s get into it!\n\nExterior:\n\nInterior Space:\n\nCar Seat Tilt:\n\nThis feature is for you, moms, dads, and families! With second row bucket seats, the Grand Cherokee L comes standard with a car seat friendly tilt. When you have a car seat installed on a seat, it can be difficult to maneuver around to the third row. Not with this vehicle! When a car seat is installed on the bucket seat, all you do is press and hold the latch on the back of the seat and pull forward. The seat will smoothly slide forward and tilt while doing so, allowing passengers to easily climb in the back without compromising the integrity of the car seat. Genius! Another great feature for families that is offered with the Grand Cherokee L is the rear seat monitoring camera. On your infortainment system screen, you can see an overhead view of what is going on behind you both in the second and third row. You can even zoom in to check how your passengers are doing. All of this can be done without having to turn around or try to look in your rearview mirror with this amazing feature!\n\nWe have looked at the main differences between the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Grand Cherokee L. The exterior looks similar to one another, but the Grand Cherokee L adds 11 inches of length with the addition of the third row. The Grand Cherokee seats 5, but the Grand Cherokee L can seat 6 or 7 depending on whether you want a second row bench seat or bucket seats. And don’t forget about the car seat tilt and rear seat monitoring camera! So, which Jeep Grand Cherokee is right for you? Come visit us at our New Prague or Roseville locations to compare for yourself! Regardless of which you choose, you’ll be sure to get around in comfort and style, both synonymous with the Jeep name. Follow us on Facebook. Instagram, or YouTube to see more vehicle walk-arounds and comparisons."
