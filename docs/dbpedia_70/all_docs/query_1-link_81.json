        "text": "HAYFIELD. EVEN THE NAME sounds rural. Hay. Field.\n\nThis Dodge County farming community of around 1,300 reminds me of my hometown, Vesta, a much smaller town of around 330 on the southwestern Minnesota prairie.\n\nBoth are rooted in agriculture, most visually evident in the local grain elevators.\n\nBut it was the discovery of seemingly abandoned vintage grain wagons in Hayfield that drew my primary personal interest. I remember such wagons brimming with corn and soybeans. I remember hiding inside these empty cavities as my siblings and I played out the 1960s TV westerns we watched. Such memories.\n\nToday I am drawn to explore small towns because they connect me to my past, to the place and the people that shaped me.\n\nThere’s something about a rural community that weaves people together through the commonality of living in the same intimate space. Lives crisscross in school hallways, in post offices, inside churches, at the bank, outside the grain elevator…in grocery stores (if a small town still has one, and Hayfield does).\n\nMost often, but not always, community pride runs strong. I see that in volunteer fire departments; in local Legions that, despite dwindling membership, remain open; in annual community festivals; and Friday night steak fries. Bingo, too.\n\nAnd, especially, in the schools, if a small town is still fortunate enough to have its own school. And Hayfield does.\n\nTELL ME: How do you define a small town and do you have a favorite?\n\n© Copyright 2016 Audrey Kletscher Helbling\n\nSMALL TOWNS INTRIGUE ME. Each possesses a unique character.\n\nFor that reason, and because I favor rural more than urban, my husband and I purposely detour off highways, park our vehicle along Main Streets and explore.\n\nOften we are the only ones walking about, especially since our stops are typically on Sunday afternoons.\n\nHowever, even on a recent Monday morning visit to Hayfield, population 1,300, southwest of Rochester in Dodge County, the downtown was quiet enough that I didn’t have to worry about standing in the middle of the street to take photos.\n\nAnd Hayfield offers plenty of photo ops, beginning with the welcome sign just off Minnesota State Highway 56. The “Where People Make Progress” slogan puzzled me, until I read this explanation on the city’s website:\n\nOur community has had many projects which have been accomplished by grants, donations and countless volunteer hours.\n\nExamples of that progress include the local pool, ball diamonds, the library, Meals on Wheels…\n\nThe annual community celebration of Hey Days, slated for July 26 – 28, also involves countless hours of volunteerism. That’s the thing about small towns. People don’t necessarily sit and wait for someone else to do something. They just do it.\n\nI bet volunteers planned, raised funds for and helped build the veterans’ memorial park next to First Presbyterian Church at the end of the business district. It’s one of the most impressive memorials we’ve seen.\n\nThat memorial is definitely worth a trip into town as is the church. We found the door unlocked and so let ourselves into this beautiful sanctuary. I’m pretty certain the guy working on a school bus at the bus garage was watching us.\n\nAcross the street, the font and paintings on the former Herald newspaper office, now a home, caught my eye. The newspaper is now merged as the Star Herald based in nearby Dodge Center.\n\nNext door I tried the door of the library, only to find it locked.\n\nYes, when I explore small towns, I’ll always try the doors. Always.\n\n© Copyright 2013 Audrey Kletscher Helbling"
