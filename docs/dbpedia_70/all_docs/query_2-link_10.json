        "text": "\"Dodge City\" redirects here. For the town, see Dodge City, Alabama. For other uses, see Dodge City (disambiguation).\n\nCity and County seat in Kansas, United States\n\nDodge City is a city in and the county seat of Ford County, Kansas, United States.[1] As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 27,788.[6][7] It was named after nearby Fort Dodge, which was named in honor of Grenville Dodge. The city is known in American culture for its history as a wild frontier town of the Old West.[8][9][10]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: History of Kansas\n\nThe first settlement in the area that became Dodge City was Fort Mann, built by civilians in 1847. At that time, the territory was part of Mexico, and the fort was built to provide protection for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail. Fort Mann collapsed in 1848 after an attack by Natives. In 1850, the U.S. Army arrived to provide protection in the region and constructed Fort Atkinson on the old Fort Mann site. The army abandoned Fort Atkinson in 1853. Military forces on the Santa Fe Trail were re-established farther north and east at Fort Larned in 1859, but the area remained vacant around what would become Dodge City until the end of the Civil War. In April 1865, the American Frontier Wars in the West began heating up, and the army constructed Fort Dodge to assist Fort Larned in providing protection on the Santa Fe Trail. Fort Dodge remained in operation until 1882.[citation needed]\n\nThe town of Dodge City can trace its origins to 1871, when rancher Henry J. Sitler built a sod house west of Fort Dodge to oversee his cattle operations in the region, conveniently located near the Santa Fe Trail and Arkansas River, and Sitler's house quickly became a stopping point for travelers. Others saw the commercial potential of the region with the Santa Fe Railroad rapidly approaching from the east. In 1872, Dodge City was staked out on the 100th meridian and the legal western boundary of the Fort Dodge reservation. The town site was platted and George M. Hoover established the first bar in a tent to serve thirsty soldiers from Fort Dodge. The railroad arrived in September to find a town ready and waiting for business. The early settlers in Dodge City traded in buffalo bones and hides and provided a civilian community for Fort Dodge. With the arrival of the railroad, Dodge City soon became involved in the cattle trade.\n\nThe idea of driving Texas Longhorn cattle from Texas to railheads in Kansas originated in the late 1850s,[11] but was cut short by the Civil War. In 1866, the first Texas cattle started arriving in Baxter Springs in southeastern Kansas by way of the Shawnee Trail. Texas Longhorn cattle carried a tick that spread Texas cattle fever, among other breeds of cattle. Alarmed Kansas farmers persuaded the Kansas State Legislature to establish a quarantine line in central Kansas. The quarantine prohibited Texas Longhorns from the heavily settled, eastern portion of the state.[12]\n\nWith the cattle trade forced west, Texas Longhorns began moving north along the Chisholm Trail. In 1867, the main cowtown was Abilene, Kansas. Profits were high, and other towns quickly joined in the cattle boom: Newton in 1871, Ellsworth in 1872, and Wichita in 1872. In 1876, however, the Kansas State Legislature responded to pressure from farmers settling in central Kansas and once again shifted the quarantine line westward, which essentially eliminated Abilene and the other cowtowns from the cattle trade. With no place else to go, Dodge City suddenly became the \"queen of the cow towns.\"[13]\n\nA new route known as the Great Western Cattle Trail or Western Trail branched off from the Chisholm Trail to lead cattle into Dodge City. Dodge City became a boomtown, with thousands of cattle passing annually through its stockyards. The peak years of the cattle trade in Dodge City were from 1883 to 1884, and during that time the town grew tremendously. In 1880, Dodge City got a new competitor for the cattle trade from the border town of Caldwell. For a few years, the competition between the towns was fierce, but enough cattle were available for both towns to prosper.[citation needed]\n\nDodge City became known as a true frontier settlement of the Old West. Dodge City had more gunfighters working at one time or another than any other town in the West, many of whom participated in the Dodge City War of 1883. It had saloons, gambling halls, and brothels, including the Long Branch Saloon and China Doll brothel.[14] For a time in 1884, Dodge City had a bullfighting ring where Mexican bullfighters would put on a show with specially chosen Longhorn bulls. As more agricultural settlers moved into western Kansas, pressure increased on the Kansas State Legislature to do something about splenic fever, known today as anthrax. Consequently, in 1885, the quarantine line was extended across the state and the Western Trail was all but shut down.\n\nBy the mid-1880s, Dodge City began working to change its image away from that of a violent western town and towards that of a more peaceful and civilized location. In 1878, for example, the bodies in the notorious \"Boot Hill\" cemetery were moved to the newly established Prairie Grove Cemetery, and a new schoolhouse was built on Boot Hill.[15] In 1907 Andrew Carnegie donated money for the construction of a new public library in Dodge City.\n\nDodge City was also a significant hub for racing for many years, and it held the first World Championship 300 Mile Motorcycle Race on July 4, 1914.[16] Notable attendees included William Harley and Walter Davidson, who adopted the \"hog\" as a mascot after one of their riders, Ray Weishaar, brought a piglet from his farm with him to the race. Motorcycle races continued in Dodge City into the 1950s, and attracted significant talent throughout this time, though Dodge's prominence as a hub for motorcycle racing would gradually fade over time.[17] Dodge City was also a site for automobile races, with racers such as Carroll Shelby taking part in the events.[18]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge City lies on the Arkansas River in the High Plains region of the Great Plains.[19] The city sits above one of the world's largest underground water systems, the Ogallala Aquifer,[20] and is 25 miles (40 km) from the eastern edge of the Hugoton Natural Gas Area.[citation needed] Located at the intersection of U. S. Routes 50, 56 and 283 in southwestern Kansas, Dodge City is 151 mi (243 km) west of Wichita, 199 mi (320 km) northeast of Amarillo, and 301 mi (484 km) southeast of Denver.[19][21]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 14.55 square miles (37.68 km2), of which 14.44 square miles (37.40 km2) is land and 0.11 square miles (0.28 km2) is water.[22]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge City lies at the intersection of North America's semi-arid (Köppen BSk) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) zones,[23] with hot summers, highly variable winters, both warm and very cold periods, and low to moderate humidity and precipitation throughout the year; it is part of USDA Hardiness zone 6b.[24] Areas to the west are drier and more strongly semi-arid. Severe weather, including tornadoes, is common in the area, especially in the spring months. Dodge City is often cited as the windiest city in the United States with an average speed of 13.9 mph (22.4 km/h), which results in occasional blizzards in the winter, even when snowfall does not accumulate much.[25] On average, January is the coldest month, July is the hottest month, and June is the wettest month.[26]\n\nThe high temperature reaches or exceeds 90 °F (32.2 °C) an average of 71 days a year and reaches or exceeds 100 °F (37.8 °C) an average of 14 days a year; the last year that failed to reach 100 °F (37.8 °C) was 1958.[27] The minimum temperature falls to or below 0 °F (−18 °C) an average of 2.1 days a year.[28] The highest officially recorded temperature was 111 °F (44 °C) on June 27, 2012, while the lowest temperature officially recorded was −26 °F (−32 °C) on February 12, 1899.[27] The record cold daily maximum is −13 °F (−25 °C) on January 13, 1875, and conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) last set June 13, 2022.[27]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1880996—18901,76377.0%19001,94210.2%19103,21465.5%19205,06157.5%193010,05998.8%19408,487−15.6%195011,26232.7%196013,52020.0%197014,1274.5%198018,00127.4%199021,12917.4%200025,17619.2%201027,3408.6%202027,7881.6%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2020 United States census counted 27,788 people, 9,000 households, and 6,399 families in Dodge City.[29][30] The population density was 1,888.3 per square mile (729.1/km2).

Cargill Meat Solutions and National Beef both operate large facilities in the city.[41] The city also hosts farm implement manufacturing and serves as a supply center for area agriculture. Livestock-raising is a major activity while wheat and sorghum are the area's main crops.[10] In addition, a local tourism industry, including a casino resort, has developed to capitalize on Dodge City's history as an Old West cowtown.[42] The service sector accounts for much of the rest of the local economy.[41]\n\nAs of 2010, 70.9% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force. 0.3% was in the armed forces, and 70.5% was in the civilian labor force with 66.9% being employed and 3.6% unemployed.

The three industries employing the largest percentages of the working civilian labor force were: manufacturing (33.0%); educational services, health care, and social assistance (18.1%); and retail trade (9.4%).[40]\n\nThe cost of living in Dodge City is relatively low; compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the city is 79.3.[43] As of 2010, the median home value in the city was $83,300, the median selected monthly owner cost was $1,013 for housing units with a mortgage and $450 for those without, and the median gross rent was $571.[40]\n\nIn late 2023, Hilmar Cheese is scheduled to open a new $550 million cheese and whey protein processing plant in Dodge City.[44]\n\nTop employers\n\n[edit]\n\nCargill Meat Solutions and National Beef are the two largest employers. Other major employers include local government, schools, retail stores, and health care providers.[41]\n\nLargest employers (100+ Employees)[45] Employer Employees National Beef Packing Company 2,950 Cargill Meat Solutions 2,700 Unified School District #443 1,292 Wal-Mart Super Center 400 Western Plains Medical Complex 295 Boot Hill Casino & Resort 288 Dodge City Community College 284 Ford County Government 263 City of Dodge City 238 CrustBuster/Speed King, Inc. 150 Dillon's Super Store 140 Dodge City Medical Center 125 Kansas Soldiers' Home 115 Arrowhead West, Inc. 101\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge City has a commission-manager form of government.[46] The city commission consists of five members who serve either two-year or four-year terms, depending on the number of votes they receive. Every year, the commission selects one commissioner to serve as mayor and another to serve as vice-mayor.[47] The commission meets on the first and third Mondays of each month.[46] Appointed by the commission, the city manager leads the city administration, executes the commission's policies, and develops operational programs to meet the city's needs.[48]\n\nAs the county seat, Dodge City is the administrative center of Ford County. The county courthouse is located downtown, and all departments of the county government base their operations in the city.[49]\n\nDodge City lies within Kansas's 1st U.S. Congressional District. For the purposes of representation in the Kansas Legislature, the city is located in the 38th district of the Kansas Senate and the 115th and 119th districts of the Kansas House of Representatives.[46]\n\nDodge City was criticized by Johnny Dunlap, Ford County Democratic Party's chairman, for only having one polling place for 13,000 voters. For the 2018 election, it was moved outside the city limits one mile from the nearest bus stop.[50] While the county provided transportation, voters had to arrange for it in advance.[51] A lawsuit over the issue was dismissed after Debbie Cox, the county clerk, agreed to open two polling places in the next election.[52]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary education\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge City USD 443 public school district serves over 6,000 students and operates 14 schools in the city, including one early childhood center, eight elementary schools, two middle schools, one high school, and one alternative school.[53]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Dodge City oversees one Catholic school in the city: Sacred Heart Cathedral School (Pre-K-8).[54]\n\nColleges and universities\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge City Community College (DCCC), a two-year public college with approximately 2,000 students, is located in the northwestern part of the city.[55][56] From 1952 to 1993, Dodge City was also home to St. Mary of the Plains College, a private, four-year Catholic liberal arts college.[57] Newman University, a Catholic university based in Wichita, now operates a branch campus on St. Mary of the Plains' former grounds.[58]\n\nLibraries\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge City Public Library, located north of downtown, is the city's main library. A member of the Southwest Kansas Library System, it has a collection of approximately 123,000 volumes, and it circulates more than 189,000 items annually.[59] It was founded as a Carnegie library in 1905 and moved to its current facility in 1981.[60] The library offers several services to the public, including computer classes, public internet access, and programs for children and adults.[61] Another library in the city is the DCCC Library, which holds more than 30,000 volumes and serves as a federal depository library.[62][63]\n\nInfrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally a stop on the Santa Fe Trail, Dodge City was later located on the National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, which followed the trail's path in western Kansas upon its establishment in 1912.[64] Currently, four U.S. Highways meet in Dodge City: U.S. Route 50, U.S. Route 56, U.S. Route 283, and U.S. Route 400.

The Boot Hill Museum, located downtown, contains thousands of artifacts and a variety of exhibits portraying the culture of the city's early years. The museum's larger exhibits include: Front Street, a partial reconstruction of downtown Dodge City as it existed in 1876; the Long Branch Saloon and the Long Branch Variety Show; the Saratoga Saloon; the Hardesty House, a period-typical home built in 1879; the city's original Boot Hill Cemetery; and the Kansas Cowboy Hall of Fame.[110][111] The Santa Fe Trail Remains, located 9 miles (14 km) west of the city, are preserved wagon tracks from a section of the Santa Fe Trail.[111] The Ford County Historical Society maintains the Mueller-Schmidt House, called the \"Home of Stone.\" Built from area limestone in 1881, it is the oldest building in the city still standing at its original site.[112] Other historical landmarks include: El Capitan, a life-sized bronze sculpture of a Texas Longhorn steer built to commemorate the cattle drives that once ended in the city; a bronze statue of famous Dodge City lawman Wyatt Earp; and the Santa Fe Depot, the largest extant train depot in Kansas.[113][114]\n\nTo capitalize on this heritage, the city promotes its downtown business district as historic Old Dodge City complete with Western-themed tourist attractions, shops, and restaurants.[115] Visitors can tour the district by trolley or by taking the Dodge City Trail of Fame walking tour.[116][117] The state of Kansas operates the similarly themed Boot Hill Casino & Resort on the west side of the city – when it opened for business in December 2009, Boot Hill became the first state-owned casino in the United States.[118][119]\n\nDodge City Civic Center and United Wireless Arena are the city's two main indoor event venues. The Civic Center, built in 1954, is a 2,800-seat multipurpose facility that has hosted a variety of events, including concerts and sporting events.[120][121] United Wireless Arena, opened in 2011, is a 5,500-seat multipurpose arena located next to the Boot Hill Casino on the west side of the city. Owned by the City of Dodge City and Ford County, the arena complex includes the 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) Magouirk Conference Center.[122]\n\nOther sites of interest in the city include the Dodge City Zoo and the Kansas Teachers' Hall of Fame. The Zoo is located in Wright Park and is home to more than 45 animals.[123] Located downtown, the Kansas Teachers' Hall of Fame hosts exhibits on education in Kansas and claims to be the first of its kind in the United States.[124]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are 33 Christian churches in and around Dodge City.[125] The Roman Catholic Diocese of Dodge City is based in the city. Established in 1951, it comprises 28 Kansas counties, roughly the southwestern quarter of the state.[126] The city is home to the diocese's current cathedral as well as its former cathedral, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe and Sacred Heart Cathedral, respectively.[127] Also headquartered in the city is the Dodge City District of the United Methodist Church, which consists of 22 counties in southwestern Kansas.[128]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nDodge City Community College's athletic teams, the Dodge City Conquistadors (or \"Conqs\" for short), compete in several sports in the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference (KJCCC).[129]\n\nBeyond DCCC sports, Dodge City also hosts amateur baseball and professional motorsports. The Dodge City Athletics, nicknamed the \"A's\", are a collegiate summer baseball team in the Jayhawk Collegiate League of the National Baseball Congress.[130] Both the A's and the DCCC Conquistadors baseball team use Cavalier Field, located on the former St. Mary of the Plains College campus, as their home field.[131] Dodge City Raceway Park, located immediately south of the city, is a 3/8-mile dirt track that hosts midget and sprint car racing from April through October. Past events at the park have included National Sprint Tour and World of Outlaws races.[132] The Western Kansas Dirt Riders, a motocross team, race at Tumbleweed Raceway adjacent to the Raceway Park.[133]\n\nIn the past, Dodge City hosted college football and professional basketball as well. From 1970 to 1980, the annual Boot Hill Bowl post-season college football game was played in Dodge City. The bowl was sanctioned by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and featured schools such as Washburn University and Emporia State University. The last game was played on November 21, 1980.[134] From 2000 to 2007, the city was home to a minor league professional basketball team, the Dodge City Legend of the United States Basketball League.[135]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the idiom, see Wiktionary:get out of Dodge.\n\nStarting in the 1870s, the violent episodes of early Dodge City history, particularly the exploits of Wyatt Earp, attracted national media attention. National news coverage of the 1883 Dodge City War civil strife fueled public perceptions of frontier turmoil and established Dodge City as the \"Sodom of the West\" in the public consciousness. Gunfighters and lawmen such as Earp and his brothers and partners became celebrities, and sensationalized versions of their activities entered period popular culture as the subject of dime novels. Over time, the level and scale of the violence in early Dodge City were significantly embellished, becoming the stuff of legend. This trend continued into the 20th century, particularly after the 1931 publication of Stuart N. Lake's book Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. Regarded in American folklore as the quintessential rough and rowdy Old West frontier town, Dodge City served as the setting for numerous works of Western-themed media, including later popular films and television series.[136]\n\nDodge City was the setting of the long-running radio and television series Gunsmoke. The series followed the adventures of fictional U.S. Marshal Matt Dillon portrayed on radio by William Conrad and then on television by James Arness, as he dealt with gunfighters, cattle rustlers, gamblers and other criminals while enforcing the law in the frontier town. The radio lasted from 1952 to 1961 while the television series ran from 1955 to 1975, on the CBS television network, and was one of the longest-running prime-time TV dramas in American history. The show proved to be culturally influential and promoted the legend of Dodge City's Old West era. It also served as the source of the idiom \"get [the hell] out of Dodge\", which means to leave a dangerous area quickly.[137] In honor of the series, the city government changed the name of Walnut Street, one of its downtown streets, to Gunsmoke Street, in 1959.[138]\n\nThe city has also been a setting for a number of films and television series dramatizing the career of Wyatt Earp. These include several seasons of the series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp starring Hugh O'Brian on the ABC television network from 1955 to 1961, and the films Winchester '73 (1950), with James Stewart Masterson of Kansas (1954), with George Montgomery, Cheyenne Autumn (1964), featuring Richard Widmark, James Stewart and Edward G. Robinson and directed by John Ford and Wyatt Earp (1994) with Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman. In the 1939 film Dodge City the fictional lawman Wade Hatton, played by Errol Flynn, was modeled on Earp.[139]\n\nIn the television series Smallville, Metropolis is said to be southwest of Dodge City with Smallville, \"Superman\" / Clark Kent's childhood and adolescent residence, located 200 miles (320 km) west of Wichita.[140]\n\nMore recently, Dodge City served as a setting for the 2005 multi-platform video game Gun.[141]\n\nThe Bruce Springsteen song “If I Was The Priest,” on his 2020 album Letter to You, refers to the main character being “needed tonight up in Dodge City.”\n\nDodge City is prominently featured in Ken Burns PBS documentary The American Buffalo that premiered on October 16, 2023.\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nNumerous figures of the American Old West lived in Dodge City during its period as a frontier cowtown. These included, most notably, lawmen Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson as well as gunfighter Doc Holliday.[142] Other notable natives and residents have included Vaudeville actor and comedian Eddie Foy Sr., wrestler Sputnik Monroe,[143] and actor Dennis Hopper.\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nReconstructed shops on Front Street at the Boot Hill Museum (2010)\n\nHanging Tree at the Boot Hill Cemetery (1972)\n\nGraves at Museum (1959)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nJones Plummer Trail\n\nMurder trial of seven Cheyenne (1879)\n\nNational Old Trails Road\n\nSanta Fe Trail\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nKansas portal\n\nSee also: List of books about Kansas, including historical information about its counties and cities\n\nBritz, Kevin (October 1, 2003). \" 'Boot Hill Burlesque': The Frontier Cemetery as Tourist Attraction in Tombstone, Arizona, and Dodge City, Kansas\".
