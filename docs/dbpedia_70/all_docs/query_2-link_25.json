        "text": "Iowa Fishing Regulations\n\nIowa residents and nonresidents who are required to have a fishing license must pay the Trout Fee to fish for or possess trout. Exception: Children under 16 may possess or fish for trout without having paid the Trout Fee if they fish with a properly licensed adult who has paid the Trout Fee and together they limit their catch to the one person daily limit of five (5) trout. Children under 16 can pay their own Trout Fee, which allows them to fish without a properly licensed adult and keep their own daily limit (5).\n\nAnnual Fishing License: Resident - $22, Nonresident - $48; Trout Fee: Resident - $14.50, Nonresident - $17.50. Shorter term license options are available - see options on the Fishing Licenses & Laws webpage or page 2 of the Iowa Fishing Regulations.\n\nBuy Your Fishing Licenses Online\n\nSeason: All waters - Continuous\n\nLength Limits: None, except a 14-inch minimum length limit applies to all trout in Spring Branch, from the spring source to County Hwy. D5X as posted, and on brown trout only in portions of Bloody Run Creek where posted.\n\nDaily Bag & Possession: All waters - Combined daily of 5 and possession of 10.\n\nCatch & Release Only Streams: Trout caught from the posted portion of these streams must be released alive immediately:\n\nHewett and Ensign Creeks\n\nMcLoud Run\n\nSouth Pine Creek (Brook Trout only)\n\nWaterloo Creek\n\nFrench Creek (Brown Trout only)\n\nWest Branch French Creek (Brown Trout only)\n\nCasey Springs (Brook Trout only)\n\nFalcon Springs (Brook Trout only)\n\nPine Spring Creek (Brook Trout only)\n\nArtificial Lure Only Streams: Artificial lure means lures that do not contain or have applied to them any natural or human-made substance designed to attract fish by the sense of taste or smell.\n\nIn the posted areas of:\n\nBloody Run Creek\n\nCasey Springs\n\nEnsign Creek\n\nFalcon Springs\n\nFrench Creek\n\nHewett Creek\n\nMcLoud Run\n\nPine Spring Creek\n\nSouth Pine Creek\n\nSpring Branch\n\nWaterloo Creek\n\nWild Trout Streams Open to Public Fishing\n\nIowa trout streams are on both public and private lands. Private lands open to public fishing will be marked with grey “Open for Public Fishing” or white “Public Fishing Only” signs. Public-owned fishing areas are typically well-marked with green “Public Hunting” or brown “Park” signs.\n\nThe Iowa DNR buys conservation easements along some streams from willing landowners to provide public trout fishing on privately-owned land. Angler Conservation Easements along private trout streams protect water resources, restore fish habitat and provide public fishing. These easements are an important partnership with participating landowners.\n\nOver 20 miles of Northeast Iowa trout streams are conserved by easements. Your cooperation helps protect these “Trout Trails” and allow the public to fish as guests of the landowner.\n\nThe stream bottoms of Iowa trout streams are privately-owned, except when surrounding lands are publicly-owned. If the stream access does not have a public fishing sign, assume that it is private property. You need permission from the landowner to fish areas that are not posted as open for public access.\n\nWhat do I need to catch trout in a community lake or pond?\n\nThe trout are very active and eager to bite when they come off of the hatchery truck. A small hook with a nightcrawler or corn under a small bobber, or small spinners such as a Panther Martin or Mepps is all you need to get in on the fun.\n\nThere are several ways to catch rainbow trout in community ponds and lakes during the winter.\n\nIf you are fishing through the ice, fish for trout just like you would for bluegill and crappie. A teardrop jig tipped with a waxworm under a small bobber works great. You could also use something flashy like a Super Duper, Little Cecil or a small jigging spoon with a blade on it to attract the fish.\n\nIf you are fishing open water, cast several lure types with ultralight gear including a small jig and twister, in-line spinner such as a Panther Martin, or small stick baits such as a floating Rapala. You can also fish with a bobber, small split shot and a worm on a small hook.\n\nFind more tips for catching trout on our How to Fish for Trout webpage.\n\nFishing license and trout fee\n\nCommunity trout stockings are supported by the sales of the trout fee. You need a valid fishing license and pay the trout fee to fish for or possess trout. The daily limit is five trout per licensed angler with a possession limit of 10. Children age 15 or younger can fish for trout without a fishing license and trout fee if they are with a properly licensed adult, but they must limit their combined catch to the adult’s daily limit of five trout. The child can buy a trout fee which will allow them to catch their own limit. Once you pay your trout fee, you can fish for trout all year long at any of the community trout lakes or ponds (see list above) and Northeast Iowa trout streams.\n\nWild Trout Streams Open to Public Fishing\n\nOver the past twenty-five years there has been a dramatic increase in northeast Iowa streams that support populations of trout fully-sustained through natural reproduction. More than 95 streams in Iowa have some level of natural reproduction and provide opportunities for anglers to pursue wild trout.\n\nWild trout populations have increased with improved fish production techniques and trout genetics, land-use change in critical watersheds, targeted trout habitat improvement, and increased quantity of coldwater habitat suitable for trout.\n\nBrown trout are the most common wild trout in Iowa streams with wild brook trout less common. Rainbow trout rarely reproduce in Iowa streams, but they are frequently stocked as hatchery-produced fish.\n\nWidespread brown trout reproduction in Iowa streams has reduced the importance of stocking to maintain these fisheries. Today, brown trout are not stocked in northeast Iowa streams due to the successful reproduction of wild browns.\n\nCurrent wild trout restoration stocking is focused on increasing the number of native brook trout populations in northeast Iowa. Brook trout eggs are collected from wild Iowa populations with preferred genetic composition and hatched at the Manchester Fish Hatchery to be stocked in watersheds with high-quality coldwater streams.\n\nWild brown trout and wild brook trout populations are closely monitored and managed for optimal fishing opportunity using stream habitat improvement, watershed management, angler access improvement, environmental protection, and harvest regulations. Public fishing access is available on most of the best wild trout streams in Iowa. Landowner permission is required for fishing trout streams sections without public access.\n\nFisheries staff play an active role in trout stream projects to improve and maintain quality water and habitat that benefit both trout and trout anglers. Successful water quality improvement projects are led by groups and communities that partner with the DNR to create and implement long-term plans to improve the land and water. Using conservation practices on the land upstream is key to help stop sediment, nutrients and bacteria from entering into the stream.\n\nSeveral projects are currently ongoing in Northeast Iowa. The longest running project was implemented in 2000 on the Upper Iowa River. It continues to secure funding for additional tributaries within its watershed and on the immediate corridor.\n\nWatershed improvement projects have helped many trout streams by changing the way water flows through them. Bank stabilization projects occur on public and private owned properties. Cutbanks are stabilized by bank shaping, armoring with rock, seeding, willow stake planting and cedar tree or root-wad revetments.\n\nLandowners who want to improve the habitat in their trout streams should contact the Decorah or Manchester fish management biologist for help with project plans and potential funding sources.\n\nKids (15 years and younger) have their own trout fishing ponds at Big Spring Hatchery and the Bellevue Fishing Station along the Mississippi River. These ponds offer a safe and easy spot for families with young or beginner anglers to learn the basics of fishing, with an excellent chance to reel in their first trout and earn a first fish award. A limited number of fishing poles and basic tackle is available for kids to use, but don't forget the night crawlers! On most years, the Bellevue Kids Pond is not fishable from late spring though the summer months due to excessive aquatic vegetation.\n\nAll kids must be with a properly licensed adult (fishing license + trout fee). There is a 2 trout limit per day, which includes trout caught and released. Artificial tackle is recommended for kids planning to catch and release fish."
