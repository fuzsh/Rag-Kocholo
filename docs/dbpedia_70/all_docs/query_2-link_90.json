        "text": "FCA US is recalling some vehicles to correct their service and owner’s manuals, and inspect and replace their wheel studs, as needed. Affected are certain model-year 2012-2021 Ram 3500 heavy-duty pickups, and 4500 and 5500 cab-chassis vehicles.\n\nRoutine customer data analysis led to an FCA US investigation that discovered certain service and owner’s manuals contain incorrect lug-nut torque instructions. Accordingly, the corresponding vehicles may have had their lug nuts over-torqued, a condition that could compromise studs and lead to wheel separation.\n\nThere is no component defect and torque applied during vehicle assembly is within specification, so the recall condition may only be present in vehicles that have been subject to wheel-removal as part of a service or upfit procedure. The Company is unaware of any related injuries or accidents.\n\nDealers are currently in possession of correct service instructions, and production vehicles are now being delivered with updated owner’s manuals. The campaign is limited to vehicles equipped with dual rear wheels and flanged lug nuts.\n\nFCA US will advise affected customers when service becomes available.\n\nFCA US is recalling some older-model vehicles in the U.S. to replace the airbag covers on their steering wheels.\n\nAn FCA investigation discovered these vehicles are equipped with certain clips, no longer in use, that may — over time — loosen and separate from the plastic emblems they are meant to secure. Should this happen and there is a driver-side air bag deployment, the clips and/or plastic emblems may act as projectiles.\n\nThe recall is limited to model-year 2007-2011 Dodge Nitro SUVs, and model-year 2008-2010 Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans.\n\nWhat you need to know: In the interim, FCA strongly advises against tampering with the emblems, which are located in the center of the vehicles’ steering wheels. The airbags associated with this campaign are not from Takata.\n\nThe recall number is W09. The repair for this recall is now available. Please visit your local dealership for an appointment.\n\nFCA US is voluntarily recalling 2013 – 2016 Dodge Darts sedans equipped with automatic transmissions to replace their shift cable bushings.\n\nThe FCA campaign number is V34.\n\nAn FCA US investigation discovered certain vehicles are equipped with a cable bushing that may degrade after prolonged exposure to high ambient heat and humidity. Should degradation occur, it may prohibit the driver from shifting gears.\n\nThe Company is unaware of any related injuries or collisions, but such circumstances raise the risk of unintended vehicle movement. Therefore, customers are reminded to follow the vehicle’s operating instructions before exiting the vehicle. These instructions include shutting off the engine and engaging the parking brake.\n\nIn the extremely rare event that the cable bushing becomes disconnected while driving, brake function remains, which helps preserve driver-control.\n\nVINs are currently searchable on our recalls.mopar.com website.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nParts are now readily available to perform repairs. Owner notifications will mail in September to all affected owners.\n\nWhen the owner notification is received, any authorized Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge or RAM dealer can repair affected vehicles, free of charge.\n\nFCA US LLC is recalling heavy-duty trucks in the U.S. to address a potential steering-linkage issue.\n\nAn FCA US investigation discovered a specific steering-linkage configuration on certain vehicles may separate over time. If this were to occur, the driver may experience steering loss.\n\nThe FCA campaign number for this safety recall is V06.\n\nThe Company is aware of one potentially related injury and eight potentially related accidents.\n\nThe recall population is limited to model-year 2013-2018 Ram 3500 pickups and model-year 2014-2018 Ram 2500 pickups and 3500 chassis cabs.\n\nVINs are currently searchable on our recalls.mopar.com website.\n\nThe redesigned-for-2019 Ram 1500, North American International Auto Show and Motor Trend Truck of the Year Award Winner, is not affected by this safety recall.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nA remedy is currently available to fix all trucks affected by this safety recall. This remedy will include your dealer inspecting the steering linkage configuration and possibly welding or replacing the drag link assembly.\n\nWhen the owner notification is received, any authorized Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge or RAM dealer can inspect and repair affected vehicles, free of charge.\n\nAfter the recall is performed, owners are still able to have an alignment completed by following an approved alignment procedure.\n\nToe Adjustment with Welded Drag Link\n\nFCA US LLC is voluntarily recalling U.S.-market pickup trucks to upgrade their tailgate locking mechanisms. The power locking mechanisms in the tailgates of certain pickups may break over time. If this were to happen, the vehicle's tailgate may unlatch.\n\nThe FCA campaign numbers for these safety recalls is U74 and V44.\n\nThe recalls affect certain Ram 1500, 2500 and 3500 pickups from model years 2013 through 2017 and select 2018 vehicles. Trucks equipped with manual tailgate locks are not included in these campaigns.\n\nVINs are currently searchable on our recalls.mopar.com website.\n\nThe redesigned-for-2019 Ram 1500, North American International Auto Show and Motor Trend Truck of the Year Award Winner, is not affected by these safety recalls. Its tailgate mechanism benefits from a new design that delivers enhanced functionality, such as lift-assist.\n\nA remedy is currently available to fix tailgate latch assemblies affected by these recalls. Once the notifications are received, any authorized Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge or RAM dealer can repair affected vehicles, free of charge.\n\nFCA US is unaware of any related injuries or accidents.\n\nIn the interim, FCA US reminds owners that all loose cargo should be secured while driving, as stated in the operating manuals of the affected vehicles.\n\nFurther, FCA US pickups offer alternate features to accommodate load security, such as tie-down rings, cleats, high-friction bed-liners, bulkhead dividers, and bed-extenders.\n\nParts to remedy ALL FCA US vehicles included in ALL active safety campaigns related to driver and/or passenger airbag inflators manufactured by Takata Corporation are now available.\n\nAdditionally, front passenger airbag inflators are now available for Safety Recall V01\n\nUpon receiving notification, affected owners should contact their dealer to schedule an appointment for their free repair.\n\nIf affected owners are seeking to have their vehicle repaired before receiving this notification, they can contact their Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep® or RAM dealer to inquire about part availability, and can have their vehicle repaired. All FCA US dealers have access to parts to repair all vehicles included in active safety campaigns related to driver and/or passenger airbag inflators manufactured due by Takata Corporation.\n\nIf you require assistance in scheduling an appointment for this FREE repair, please call 833-585-0144."
