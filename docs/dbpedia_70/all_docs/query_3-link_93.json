        "text": "Moving out of state can be stressful and figuring out a way to transport your car to a new state can be even more complicated, if you don’t have a plan. Lucky for you, after reading our expert tips, you will have a plan and be educated on all of your car shipping options. Whether you choose to drive the car yourself, enlist the help of a family member or hire a professional auto transport company, we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything you need to know to successfully ship a car across state lines.\n\nSmart Ways to Ship a Car to Another State\n\nHire an auto transport company\n\nTransport your car with a moving company\n\nHitch your car to a moving truck\n\nHire a professional driver\n\nDrive it yourself\n\nShip your car by train\n\nShip your car by boat\n\nHire an auto transport company\n\nThe most stress-free route to ship a car to another state is to find a reputable car shipping company and let them handle all the heavy lifting. Get at least three car shipping quotes to compare shipping prices and offerings from different service providers to ensure you find the best car shipping companies for your needs and budget.\n\nThere are a lot of great auto shippers in the auto transport industry. Always be sure that the company you choose to work with can check off the following boxes:\n\nMust be licensed and insured for interstate moves. To verify licensure, visit the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s website and look up a company’s U.S. DOT number. (Note that any company listed on our directory has already been screened for license and insurance.)\n\nThey have a good rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).\n\nGood online reviews.\n\nGet started with a visit to our car shipping quotes feature.\n\nTransport your car with a moving company\n\nAre you using a full-service moving company for your interstate move? They may be able to move your car(s) too. When you’re getting a quote for your interstate move, ask if they offer vehicle transportation services. Even if they don’t offer the service themselves, they may be able to connect you with an auto transport service.\n\nHitch your car to a moving truck\n\nIf you’re driving a moving truck to your destination, you may be able to hitch your car to the back using a tow dolly or car trailer. Check with your truck rental company to see if it’s something they allow (if they do, most will also rent out the equipment you need). Do note that this will add more of a challenge to your drive in terms of mobility, so if you’re already uncomfortable about hauling a big moving truck, you may not want to deal with a car trailer too.\n\nHire a professional driver\n\nConcierge transportation companies (also called professional driving companies) allow you to hire a driver to make the trek for you in your car. Many of them will even take your pet along and will stop for potty breaks along the way. This is a pricey option—and it will put miles on your car—but it may be a good way to go. Of course, if you hire a professional driver, always go through a driving company. Concierge transportation companies pre-vet their drivers and have the move covered by insurance.\n\nDrive it yourself\n\nWhile certainly the most time-consuming, this option allows you to have total control over your car’s move. If you’re moving a short distance, then this is certainly the easiest and cheapest option. If you’re moving out of state and/or across the country, this isn’t going to be easy – but it can be done. Those up for a road trip should consider this inexpensive alternative to hiring an auto transporter.\n\nYou might also consider asking friends or family members to drive the car. This will end up being more affordable than hiring a professional driver, but you want to make sure this person will be covered by your insurance and that they are a reliable driver. Overall, we don’t recommend this option, but it is an option if you’re in a pinch.\n\nCar transport by train\n\nAmtrak’s trains are capable of transporting everything from sedans and vans to SUVs to motorcycles. Those moving along the East Coast between Washington, D.C., and Orlando, Florida, can load their car onto the Amtrak Auto Train to be transported to their destination.\n\nCar transport by boat\n\nWhile this is mostly reserved for international car shipping, you can still ship your car by boat domestically, too. Just like moving your car by train, this isn’t the most common method to move your car, but it could be right under certain circumstances. (For example, if you’re moving to Hawaii or Alaska.)\n\nTips for getting your car ready for interstate transport\n\nTo ensure your transport goes off without a hitch, prep your car before it hits the road. A professional auto transport company you work with will generally go over the specifics that you need to do before pick-up, but be prepared to do these tasks either way:\n\nCheck your fuel gauge and ensure that it is no more than one-quarter full.\n\nEmpty all items from your car. The company you hire may require your car to be empty or may just have a set weight limit.\n\nRemove all valuables, including those documents in the glove compartment and standalone GPS devices.\n\nCheck your car’s tires to ensure that they are inflated and in good condition.\n\nCheck your car’s battery to ensure that it is fully charged.\n\nTo be safe, it’s also a good idea to check your car closely for any existing damage and to photograph it from all angles. That way, if it incurs any damage on the road, you will have proof that it was not pre-existing and can go through the appropriate insurance channels to be reimbursed.\n\nHow to save money when you ship a car to another state using professional car shipping services\n\nChoose an open-air carrier transport. This option will leave your car exposed to the elements, but it’s the most cost-effective option.\n\nBe flexible with car shipping drop-off and pickup dates. Auto transport companies will typically have some flexibility in letting you pick your dates, but if you can swing it, be open to staying flexible on the dates.\n\nGet multiple quotes. Get free auto transport quotes and a quick look at reputable companies in our auto transport center.\n\nFAQs about vehicle shipping\n\nKeep reading to find answers to the most commonly asked questions about shipping cars using an auto transport company.\n\nHow do I ship a car to another state?\n\nIf you’re not driving a car yourself or hitching it to the moving truck you’re driving, you can use a professional auto shipping company to move it for you either in an open-air or enclosed carrier. Other car transport services include using a professional driver to drive it for you and shipping your car by boat or train. The last two are less common, with limited options.\n\nHow much does it cost to ship a car to another state?\n\nIf you’re using a professional car shipping company, there are a lot of factors that make up the total cost to ship a car to another state, though average car shipping costs are about $600-$1,000 for a four-door sedan and $800-$1,070 for a small van, pickup, or SUV (based on a New York to California move). You’re more likely to hit the lower end of the range if you move in the off-season winter months. Likewise, expect to spend more if you’re moving in the summer.\n\nOther factors that will affect the total cost of shipping a car to another state include:\n\nThe size and weight of your car. The bigger and heavier your car is, the more it’s going to cost to move.\n\nThe distance of your move. As you would probably expect, long-distance moves cost more due to increased labor charges, fuel charges, and tolls.\n\nThe make and model of your car. The type of vehicle and specifics of your car do factor in when it comes to the total cost. Expect to spend to transport a luxury or classic car. Those types of cars will require more individualized attention from the shipping service.\n\nThe time of year you’re moving. You’ll spend more to transport a car to another state if you’re moving in the summer than in the winter. There’s a higher demand for auto shipping services at that time.\n\nThe type of transport you choose. Costs vary depending on whether you opt for an enclosed or open-air carrier. We’ll get into more detail on those below.\n\nAn important additional cost to consider is insurance. All legitimate auto transport companies must carry insurance, but it may not be sufficient for your needs—especially if your car is very valuable. Check with your existing auto insurance policyholder to see if your plan covers long-distance shipping, or consider purchasing supplemental insurance that will protect your car in the event something happens on the road.\n\nEnclosed transport vs. open-air transport\n\nA big cost determinant will be the type of transport method you choose—i.e., an enclosed carrier or an open-air carrier. Open-air carriers tend to be the most popular shipping method since they run cheaper than enclosed carry transports, but there are a few variables to keep in mind aside from just cost.\n\nOpen-air carriers\n\nYou’ve likely seen a lot of open-air carry transport vehicles on the road. Typically, they hold about nine to 10 cars on two separate levels, each car safely secured to the base so it doesn’t move around.\n\nThese types of carriers are more readily available, which is part of the reason that they’re the more affordable option. Having your car completely visible during the entire trip is also an advantage in that it allows the driver to notice any signs of damage immediately. That being said, open-air carriers mean that your car is exposed to the elements during transport, including any inclement weather. This makes it more susceptible to damage in the first place.\n\nAnother notable aspect of open-air transport is timing. Because open air carriers transport nearly a dozen vehicles at a time, they’re usually making multiple stops on their trips. This can push back your vehicle’s delivery date and may also mean that your car is dropped off at a central hub in your area instead of directly at your door. Inquire about delivery specifics when sourcing quotes so that you don’t inadvertently sign up to get your car a week or two after you expect to.\n\nEnclosed carriers\n\nIf you want your car to be completely protected during the shipping process, you’ll want to go for an enclosed carrier, though it will cost you more. Enclosed carriers have a few big advantages that warrant the price hike, including a lack of exposure to outside elements and higher overall security. And many times, there are only about three to five vehicles on the carrier at a time, which means you get your car back faster.\n\nThe biggest con, of course, is the price tag. According to A-1 Auto Transport, shipping your car on an enclosed carrier costs about an additional $0.25 to $0.50 per mile, which adds up quickly if you’re sending your car across the country. If you’re worried about exposure to the elements or are shipping a luxury or classic car, it’s worth looking into.\n\nWhat is the cheapest way to ship a car to another state?\n\nThe cheapest way to move a car, in most cases, is to drive it yourself. But if you hire a professional car shipping company, costs depend on the car’s size, weight, the distance of the move, the time of year you’re moving, and other factors. But, typically, the cheapest way is by an open-air carrier.\n\nWhat factors impact the cost of shipping a car to another state?\n\nThe cost of auto transport when using an auto transport company typically depends on several important factors, including the time of year (the demand is higher in the spring and summer months), the size, weight, the make and the model of your car (for example, a luxury car will cost more to transport), the distance traveled, the type of auto transport, the level of service (door-to-door service transport rates will cost more than picking up your car from a specific delivery location), and any added insurance cost.\n\nCan I ship personal items in my car to another state?\n\nNo. The car transport company is not a moving company and doesn’t have a license for this type of service. Plus, its insurance policy covers your vehicle only, not your belongings inside it.\n\nCan I have a full gas tank?\n\nIt’s preferable that you only have one-fourth of fuel in the tank, as it adds to the car’s overall weight.\n\nShould I use an enclosed car carrier to ship a car to another state?\n\nIt’s safer than the open-air carrier but also more expensive. If you are shipping a vintage, luxury or rare car, or your car has sentimental value across state lines, then opt for the better protection of the enclosed carrier.\n\nWhat kind of paperwork is needed by the car shipping company?\n\nTypically, two documents. The bill of lading and the insurance terms and conditions. You might also get asked for things like your ID and title and registration, but it’s not legally required to ship a car.\n\nHow can I prepare my car for transport?\n\nCheck that your car’s tank is no more than one-quarter full, remove all personal belongings (especially valuables), check your car’s tires and battery, disable the alarm, wash your car (that way, any damage will be more visible at the before-and-after inspections), and give your key to the carrier.\n\nHow does auto transport insurance coverage work?\n\nThe carrier must have auto transport insurance that will cover your car (but not your belongings inside it) during loading, transport and unloading. You can also purchase additional insurance if there’s a need for it. You don’t need your personal car insurance to ship your car, but you need it to drive it away and in case you need to file a claim.\n\nResources"
