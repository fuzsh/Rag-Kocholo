        "text": "Dodge Center, MN (KROC-AM News)- An employee was killed in a mishap at a southeast Minnesota manufacturing plant Monday morning.\n\nSee Also: Minnesota Toddler ID'D as Victim of Fatal Crash That Closed Hwy. 52\n\nThe deadly incident was reported around 10 a.m. Employees attempted to save their co-worker but he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nA news release issued Tuesday morning by the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office says the workplace fatality occurred at Con-Tech Manufacturing, which builds concrete mixers, at 65740 Hwy. 56 in Dodge Center.\n\nEmployees at the plant told deputies that 63-year-old Teofilo Gonzalez of Brownsdale was cutting a crossbeam support on a dolly that was supporting a 5000-pound mixer drum.\n\nThe dolly failed, which caused the mixer to come down on Gonzalez. Employees used a forklift to lift the drum off Gonzalez and began CPR.\n\nThe Dodge County Ambulance arrived at the scene shortly before 10:30 a.m. and pronounced the 10-year Con-Tech employee dead, the news release says.\n\nDodge County Chaplins also responded to the scene to assist with family notification and support co-workers and first responders who were called to the scene.\n\nDodge County Sheriff’s Deputies, Dodge County Ambulance, and Dodge Center Fire Department were the first responders on scene. Officials also requested Mayo 1, but the helicopter was unable to fly due to weather conditions, the news release says.\n\nThe Southern Minnesota Regional Medical Examiner is assisting with the death investigation. The Dodge County Sheriff’s Office says Con-Tech will report the fatal mishap to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nMore Minnesota News:"
