        "text": "Wow! My group had so much fun here. The variety of games and different difficulty settings made the experience very personal and adaptable. We especially enjoyed Lasers. The staff was super friendly and helpful in explaining how the games worked. The lockers made it very easy to store any belongings. Another cool aspect is the wristbands, which allow players to track their points during the games. I was impressed by how easy it was to move room to room. We will definitely be returning in the future!\n\n- Sarah Kirtland\n\nThis place is incredible! We went with a group of friends for my wifeâ€™s birthday and we all had a blast! All the games are unique and interactive! Make sure you wear clothes that you can be active in because you'll definitely work up a sweat!\n\n- Zac Brown\n\nWe took a large group (17 people) here for New Year's, ranging in age from 12-50. Everyone had a great time...the games were physically challenging but accessible, and each group/team found their favorites that they wanted to Level Up in. Be prepared to sweat and have a fun time together. Highly recommend, and look forward to returning for another go sometime soon.\n\n- Shawn Wilkie\n\nThis. Place. Is. Freaking. Awesome. I had so much fun. [...] The Laser room was my favorite, having to dip duck dive and dodge to get to the other side. I want to do this every weekend!!\n\n- Audrey McGraw"
