Hover over or click on chart elements to learn more about specific data points and, where they appear, use buttons to filter charts by course.\n\nNote: Data included in this story may differ slightly from that in other published reports due to certain data decisions. More information.\n\nPreschool\n\nParticipation in high-quality early learning programs, such as center-based preschool, improves school readiness and may have long-term educational benefits.4 Studies have found that ELs gain more from their preschool experiences than their non-EL peers.5 Participation in preschool also provides early exposure to English, which in turn may lower the age at which full proficiency is achieved. Reaching proficiency prior to first grade has been shown to reduce or eliminate reading and math achievement gaps between ELs and non-ELs.6\n\nIn these analyses, “access to preschool” is defined as going to school (enrollment) in a district that provided preschool programs or services. Given the available national-level data, the analysis is limited to students in schools with preschool or early elementary grades (any of grades preschool through grade 2). It does not include students in schools that include only upper elementary, middle, or high school grades.\n\nThe analyses below primarily use data from the 2015–16 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to explore ELs’ access to and enrollment in fee-based or free public preschool, including access to and enrollment in full-day and part-day preschool.7\n\nAlgebra I is a “gatekeeper” math course that students must pass to be prepared for higher-level math courses. Sixty-five percent of ELs had access to Algebra I in grade 8 (defined as attending a school that offered the course in grade 8). However, only 2 percent of ELs enrolled in Algebra I. In comparison, 72 percent of non-ELs were in schools that offered Algebra I in grade 8, and 7 percent enrolled in the course. A similar pattern was found for advanced math and science courses. A majority of ELs and non-ELs were in high schools that offered physics (81 and 85 percent), chemistry (88 and 92 percent), or calculus (75 and 79 percent). However, low percentages of each group enrolled in the courses, with ELs at lower rates than their non-EL peers.\n\nStudents in schools that do not offer Algebra I or advanced math or science courses do not have the opportunity to take these courses. Schools with high concentrations of EL students were less likely than schools with low concentrations to offer these courses.b For example, 48 percent of schools with grade 8 and a high concentration of ELs offered Algebra I compared with 70 percent of schools with a low concentration of ELs. About 58 percent of all schools with those grades offered this subject.\n\nThe pattern was the same for high schools offering physics, chemistry, or calculus.\n\nAlthough ELs accounted for 7 percent of students enrolled in schools that offered Algebra I in grade 8, they accounted for only 3 percent of students enrolled in the course. The pattern was similar for advanced math and science courses. For example, in high schools that offered calculus, ELs accounted for 5 percent of school enrollment but 1 percent of students enrolled in the course.\n\nWrap Up\n\nPreschool, rigorous coursework, and dual credit programs may improve the readiness of students for key phases of the education pipeline. While public preschool programs were widely available to ELs through their school districts, preschool-aged EL children enrolled in preschool at a lower rate than their non-EL peers. ELs were underrepresented in districts that provided preschool only for a fee, which may suggest that cost is a barrier to preschool.\n\nEL high school students had broad access to Algebra I and advanced math and science courses, but were less likely to enroll in these courses than non-ELs. ELs also were less represented among students enrolled in these courses than expected given their representation in school as a whole. This analysis did not explore whether such factors as lack of course prerequisites contributed to ELs’ lower enrollment in these courses. Yet, we do know that access to Algebra I and advanced math and science courses was uneven across high schools. High schools with high percentages of ELs offered these courses at lower rates than high schools with lower EL percentages. Access to dual credit programs across high schools followed a similar pattern.\n\nOverall Notes\n\nData in this story represent the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe charts are interactive. Hover over or click on chart elements to learn more about specific data points and, where they appear, use buttons to filter charts by course.\n\nFigure and source notes throughout the story identify the data sources used. With the exception of the EDFacts data used to estimate the EL preschool-age population, all data used in this story are publicly available.\n\nData used in this story may differ slightly from that in other published reports due to the removal of data from schools with data-quality concerns. This includes schools with missing, partial, and internally inconsistent data (e.g., more ELs than total students or more students enrolled in a course than enrolled in a school).\n\nDefinitions\n\nPreschool, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, includes preschool programs and services for children ages 3 through 5.\n\nFull-day preschool is a program that a child attends each weekday for approximately six hours or more.\n\nPreschool-aged children include children enrolled in preschool as well as children not enrolled in preschool. This story estimates the size of this population using the number of children enrolled in grades 1 or 2.\n\nHigh school, as used in this story, is a school that includes any of grades 9 through 12. For some of these schools, enrollment may include students in lower grades.\n\nAlgebra I, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of properties and operations of the real number system; evaluating rational algebraic expressions; solving and graphing first-degree equations and inequalities; translating word problems into equations; operations with and factoring of polynomials; and solving simple quadratic equations. Algebra I is a foundation course leading to higher-level mathematics courses, including geometry and Algebra II. The analyses in the story include only Algebra I courses for middle school students and Algebra I enrollment for students in grade 8. Algebra I enrollment for students in grade 7 is not available disaggregated by EL status.\n\nCalculus, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of derivatives, differentiation, integration, the definite and indefinite integral, and applications of calculus. Typically, students have previously attained knowledge of precalculus topics (some combination of trigonometry, elementary functions, analytic geometry, and math analysis). The CRDC data for calculus courses are for students in grades 9 through 12.\n\nChemistry, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes studying the composition, properties, and reactions of substances. These courses typically explore such concepts as the behaviors of solids, liquids, and gases; acid/base and oxidation/reduction reactions; and atomic structure. Chemical formulas and equations and nuclear reactions are also studied. The CRDC data for chemistry courses are for students in grades 9 through 12.\n\nPhysics, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that involves the study of the forces and laws of nature affecting matter, such as equilibrium, motion, momentum, and the relationships between matter and energy. The study of physics includes examination of sound, light, and magnetic and electric phenomena. The CRDC data for physics courses are for students in grades 9 through 12.\n\nEnrollment in schools with the relevant grades includes all students enrolled in the school, excluding those enrolled in preschool.\n\nDual credit programs, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, provide opportunities for students still in high school to take college-level courses offered by colleges and earn concurrent credit toward a high school diploma and a college degree. These programs are for high school-enrolled students who are academically prepared to enroll in college and are interested in taking on additional coursework. For example, students who want to study subjects not offered at their high school may seek supplemental education at colleges nearby. Dual credit programs do not include the Advanced Placement (AP) program or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The collection of these data was new for 2013–14. It includes only those schools with students in grades 9 through 12.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 U.S. Department of Education, ED Data Express, 2015–16 state-level data for Percent Proficient on the State Assessment in Math (grades 4, 8, high school) and Regulatory Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate.
