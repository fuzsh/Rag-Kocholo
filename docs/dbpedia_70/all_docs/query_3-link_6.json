        "text": "Ashland Township\n\nSource: History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties, H. H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884) Chapter XIX; transcribed by Larry Lakey\n\nIs commonly described as No. 106 North Range, 17 West, contains 36 full Sections of 640 acres each; its north boundary line at Dodge Center is the Geographical center of the county. This township is bounded on the north by Wasioja, on the south by Hayfield, on the east by Canisteo, on west by Ripley. The northwestern part of the Township is drained by Griswold's Creek and another small stream called Mokey Run, which the former empties into, and from these into the Zumbro River which flows through the extreme northwest corner of the township. The surface of the township is level, no bluffs or hills anywhere to break the view. With the exception of two sections of timber land in the northwest corner of the township, the land is prairie. The history of Ashland Township since the first white man settled there is one that undoubtedly, will be of interest to the majority of its present inhabitants and the people of Dodge County. The first man to build a house inside the present limits of Ashland Township was W. H. Parmerlee. It was a log cabin, located on the northeast quarter of section 5 half a mile northeast of his present residence. Mr. Parmerlee came to Ashland from Iowa in the spring, June, 1854, in company with Henry Hull and Geo. Thuet.\n\nThey took claims on section 5 and went to work making preparations for raising crops the coming year. This was the extent of the work done the first year, as no other settlers had yet arrived. The summer of 1855, marked a change, in increase of population, an era in the history of the town. A company from Winona composed of William Windom (our late Senator) Thomas Wilson, D. S. Norton, M. W. Sargeant, S. B. Sheardown, G. W. Townsend, and others, had a town platted and surveyed and buildings erected thereon. The village was located in the southwest corner of the township and embraced twenty acres of what is now Ripley Township. A log hotel was built by Lewis Hewitt. G. W. Townsend built and stocked a store.\n\nIn the meantime a large number of settlers had arrived and chosen locations either on the village plat or on the vacant farming lands near by. In the spring of 1856 Webster and Somers built and put in operation a steam saw mill which added greatly to the facilities for building. A school house was built by the Town Site Company and Miss Mary Wright engaged as teacher. This was the first school in the township. The religious services were held in this building by Rev. W. C. Shepard.\n\nIn 1856 a post office was established and Robt. Moffitt appointed Postmaster. The first survey of the Winona and St. Peter R. R was made through this town in the summer of 1856 which gave new impetus to all branches of business. But the setting off of the western tier of towns to Steele County crushed the hopes of the town proprietors and when the general financial crash of 1858 came on, Ashland like many other western towns, succumbed to the pressure and passed into history as an unrealized hope.\n\nThe first birth in Ashland was that of John Lidd, son of James and Martha Lidd, in the fall of 1855. The Zumbro River runs across the northwest corner of the township but affords no power for driving machinery. There are neither shops, stores or hotels in the township. There are about 125 voters and 600 inhabitants. The town record is as follows: on the 18th of May, 1858, the first town meeting was held in Ashland at the house of Robert Moffitt at which time the following officers were elected.\n\nThe first burial in the town was the wife of R. B. Miller who died in Ripley but was buried in Ashland Township, June 17th, 1857. The first to \"commit matrimony\" was Dr. G. W. Townsend, as the party of the first part, and Mary Hewit, party of the second part. The doctor is now a resident of Steele County, where he is highly appreciated for the good stories he tells of the days before the wah.\n\nThe first school district organized was in June 1858 now known as district thirty-eight.\n\nSupervisors Chairman, R.

The entire amount of personal property is assessed at $41,761.\n\nIn round numbers there were about 15,000 bushels each of wheat, barley and oats raised in the town last year, and but 278 of corn; of other crops there were 4,730 of potatoes, 196 of flax seed, 2,107 of timothy seed, 424 clover seed. There were two tons of wool clipped, twenty-three tons of butter and 3,000 lbs., of cheese made. There are in the town horses of all ages valued at $16,588, milch cows number 434 and valued at $2000.\n\nThe soil of this township is well adapted to general farming and the spontaneous growth of grass, valuable for hay, is immense. The soil for depth and strength is not surpassed by any other township in the county. The surface mould is usually from twenty-four to thirty inches deep, with a clay subsoil. Some of this land has been in constant cultivation for twenty years without any fertilizing material having been used and still it produces good crops.\n\nThere is only one church edifice in Ashland Township. The German Evangelical built in November, 1877. It is in the northeast part of the town on Section 12; its cost was about $3,500. This church numbers some 50 members; the first pastor was Rev. Geo. Von Eshien and the present pastor is the Rev. Geo. Yahn.\n\nThere are two Cemeteries in the township, the one on Section 12 owned by the congregation of the German church, the other on Section 8 is the property of the Seventh Day Baptists. In the last named there has been some thirty burials since it was laid out eighteen years ago. At present this denomination bury at Dodge Center where their church is located.\n\nThe township is provided with roads as good as are generally found in a prairie country which is as level as this.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe people have always shown a readiness to supply their children with good educational facilities. The township has eight district schools; section 6, district 39, section 9, district 38, section 10, district 37, section 16, district 40, section 23, district 41, section 30, district 43, section 27, district 60. These school houses are all neat substantial buildings. As good schools, and as efficient teachers minister to the wants of the young as are to be found in the country.\n\nThe Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad is located through the township entering from the north on section 3 and running straight through the township on the quarter line passing out on section 34 where there is to be a station.\n\nCanisteo Township\n\nSource: History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties, H. H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884) Chapter XVIII; transcribed by Cheryl Quinn\n\nLying next south of Mantorville and adjoining Salem, in Olmsted County, this was one of the earliest settled towns. A most inviting prospect it offered the settler. Two small branches of the north fork of the south Zumbro unite near the eastern border of section 23, and their banks are well bordered with timber. In the northeastern part of the township are numerous fine springs, whose waters find mutual outlet through a brook flowing southeastward and entering the Zumbro in Salem. This locality has been known ever since it was settled as Union Springs. The prairies bordering these streams are as handsome as one could desire to see, and are now dotted with many dwellings, fields and artificial groves.\n\nDuring the summer of 1854, Andrew Christofferson, Jacob Helgerson, Ole Benson and Levi Evenson made selections of land and some small improvements. The first brought his family, and continued to reside on section 26 till his death, which occurred in 1879. The others spent the following winter with friends in Salem, but are now each residents of the township.\n\nIn 1855 came Hans and Conrad Boysen, natives of Denmark, and both still resident in the county. Knut Erickson (now deceased), Jacob Hanson, John Brandickson and Botel Larson, Norwegians, also, took up their residence here during this year, and probably some others.\n\nThere were probably no American residents till 1856, when the town was almost wholly settled up. Among those who came this year and still reside here are Jacob Walradt, John Sherer, William Sparrow, William Angus, Adrianes Mastenbroek, Charles Van Allen, Toliff Hellickson, Ole Monson and Hans Kittleson. Among the pioneers of this year now deceased, may be named Daniel Kimball, Elijah Hallett, George W. Gleason, Ephraim Mattox, John Currier and Kittle Oleson. G. C. Joslyn now resides in Kasson. Several have migrated farther west, including Matthew Keller, John W. Stoel, Charles Wadleigh and Ulysses Crosby.\n\nThe pioneers of this region endured as great privations as those of any locality in the new west. It is related of one family, that after the great hailstorm on 1858, the only subsistence for a few days was furnished by greens in which the chief ingredient was pigweed. Notwithstanding the robust appetites of youth, the children in some cases seemed to feel their deprivation keenly. On one occasion, a youngster was sent to call his father from the field to partake of a very frugal meal. On coming within hailing distance, the urchin shouted, \"Come, Father! Come to nothing!\"\n\nIn the spring of 1856, Charles Russell made a claim on section 12. While he was gone to Winona to file his claim to the land, George Axlier (known as \"Dutch George\") proceeded to appropriate the location for his own use. He took the cabin that Russell had built and moved it to another part of the quarter section, where he set it up on his own account. On Russell's return he proceeded with the aid of his neighbors, Charles Van Allen and Henry Keller, to drive the intruder off. Axlier met them at first on friendly terms, and invited them to come inside and arrange a settlement. Finding there could be no settlement except in his immediate with he pretended to acquiesce and led the way to the outside. Here he seized an axe and attempted to drive Russell before him, but one of the others presented a pistol at Axlier's head, and he concluded to abandon his 'claim' to the land then and there. This was the only attempt at warfare over claims.\n\nThe little god the bow and arrow came early to reside in the township, and the 4th of December, 1856, witnessed one of his triumphs in the nuptials of Charles Van Allen and Barbara Keller. This couple now reside in an elegant mansion on section 14, surrounded by every comfort,-the reward of their preserving battle with the difficulties of pioneer life. While breaking up his present fine farm, Mr. Van Allen, had no money to buy boots, and so tramped through the hazel brush barefooted. His first team of oxen was earned by splitting rails and other labors on the farms of his neighbors.\n\nAnother couple to assume the matrimonial yoke this year was found in the persons of Levi Evenson and Esther Kittleson, who were joined by Esquire E. P. Waterman at Mantorville on the 20th of March. They now reside on Mrs. Evenson's original pre-emption, on section 27.\n\nOn the 20th of September, 1856, a son was born to Andrew Christofferson. He now resides on section 27, and is known as Severt E. Anderson. The population was quite largely increased by natural augmentation in 1857. On the 23rd of May, this year, a daughter was born to John Currier. She was christened Mary, and is now the wife of Frank T. Moore, residing at Red Bird, Nebraska. July 4th, Charles C., a son of G.W. Gleason, was born to Mr. and Mrs. Van Allen, and died thirteen months after.\n\nThe earliest death was probably that of Anna, daughter of Knut Erickson, born 25 August 1857, and died when eleven weeks old. John Currier died of consumption about May, 1858, and September 30th, of the same year, saw the demise of Ella Van Allen, mentioned above.\n\nEDUCATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS\n\nAttention was early given to the education of youth and to the service of God. Messrs. Jacob Walradt and Matthew Keller purchased, with ten dollars from their own pockets, a log cabin standing in the timber near the Zumbro, in the spring of 1857. With the assistance of several neighbors it was moved to the northeast corner of section 11, and there set up to be used for school purposes. The record of county commissioners' proceedings shows that on the 8th of April, this year, district 23 was formed, embracing sections 1,2, 11 and 12, and the east half of three and 10, Canisteo. M. Keller was appointed clerk to call a meeting and organize said district. Miss Emma Webb was employed as teacher, and a school was maintained in the summer. Thomas Van Allen was engaged to train the young during the following winter. A substantial stone school house now stands in this district, which is known as No. 31. The building is on section 12.\n\nSimultaneously with the mapping of the district 23 by the commissioners, No. 24 was also blocked out, and embraced the west half of sections 3 and 10, the east half of 6 and 7, and all of the sections between, viz.: 4, 5, 8 and 9. James H Gilleland was made clerk. As nearly as can now be learned, the first school maintained in this district was under the tutelage of Miss Mary A Johnson, and its sessions were held in a claim shanty on Gilleland's farm, on section 4. This was probably in 1858, and some authorities say 1859. The district is now numbered 32, and has a school house on the southwest corner of section 3.\n\nIt is impossible to learn at this time, with certainty, where or when the first religious services was held in town. Sometime during the summer of 1857, a Methodist clergyman preached at the house of Ephraim Mattox, in the northwestern part of the town. In August of this year, Rev. J. M. Rogers, pastor of the Pine Island circuit, preached in Matthew Keller's house, on section12. Revs. E. R. Lathrop and Thomas P. Moore also held services in the town about the same time. The latter dwelt at High Forest, and began preaching at Union Springs in September 1858. He organized a class, and continued to preach here for two years. The services were held in the school house on section 11, and he frequently walked from High Forest on Sunday morning and built his own fire on arrival. He afterward ministered at Mantorville and Pine Island, building churches at both those points. Rev. Richard Chambers, a free will Baptist, held services in Gilleland's house in 1857 or 1858.\n\nA Sunday school was organized at Union Springs school house in the fall of 1858, with over thirty pupils and Jacob Michael as superintendent. Afterwards, Mrs. Aaron Walrath became superintendent, and the meetings were held at her house. A building belonging to Mr. Keller, and used for a granary was also occupied for religious services.\n\nNo church edifice was ever erected in the town, and there is now no religious body wholly resident therein. The South Zumbro Lutheran Church, in the town of Salem, is only separated from Canisteo by the county line road, and many of its communicants dwell here. This society was organized in 1867 by Rev. Orsten hanson, with sixteen families in membership. Next year Rev. Ole A. Bergh took charge, and has so since continued. The church, a frame building 30x40x18 feet in size, was built in 1868, at a cost of over one thousand dollars. The society now includes 43 families, or 185 persons.\n\nPOLITICAL\n\nThe first election held in this township-then call Zumbro precinct-was held in October 1856, in accordance with arrangements made by the county commissioners. Matthew Keller was chosen justice of the peace; Jacob Walradt, constable and J. H. Gilleland, road supervisor. These were the only officers elected at that time, and continued in power until the state organization, 1858.\n\nOn the 11th of May in the last-named year, the legal voers of the town came together at the house of Ole Monson to elect township officers. The precinct was now called Canisteo precinct in honor of Canisteo, New York-the former home of many of its citizens. At this election, John S. Bardwell was made moderator, and Daniel Kimball clerk. It was voted for town expenses, and strict rules were adopted as to the restriction of stock. The following officers were chosen for the ensuing year: Matthew Keller, chairman, and William angus and Oliver D. Helgerson, associate supervisors; Daniel Kimball clerk; Hans C. Boysen, assessor; Ole Ambers, collector; John S. Bardwell and M Keller justices; William Bardwell and H. C. Boysen, constables; William Angus, overseer of the poor.\n\nThe second town election was held at the same place as the first on the 5th of April, 1859, and the town was then divided into six road districts. Following are the principal officers elected since 1858:\n\nYear Chairman Associate Supervisor Town Clerk 1859 Wm.L Evans O.D. Helgerson An Halverson Daniel Kimball 1860 J.H. Gilleland O.D.

Candee Hans Kittleson John Angus\n\nFor many years the town cast a democratic vote on strict political questions, but now gives a republican majority. At the presidential election in 1880, the republican electors received 127 votes, while the democratic had 30. In the gubernatorial contest of 1883, Hubbard, republican, received 72 votes, and Bierman, democrat, 60.\n\nStrong efforts were made during the civil war to prevent a draft of men from this town, and but one man was every drawn in this way. At a meeting of the town board, held February 20th, 1864, a majority vote decided to pay $150 to each volunteer enrolled to the credit of Canisteo before 1 March following. A special town meeting was held April 4th 1865, at which a tax of $4,605 was voted to pay bounties to volunteers.\n\nA draft was made in the spring of the same year, but only one person was called upon to serve-the close of the war having abolished the need of further recruits to the army. The list of names at this time is as follows: C. B. Cotton, Myron Gleason, Jerry Wheeler, Ole Monson, William R. Powers, John Johnson, Juel Juelson, Ole Beaver, Ole Benson, Jr., Ole Oleson, John G. Chase, John Sherer, Ole Evenson, Nehemiah Thomas, Andrew Halverson, Elling Anderson.\n\nA post office was established in 1858, with the name of Union Springs. Jacob Walradt was made postmaster, his commission bearing date 11 October. He was succeeded by Matthew Keller, in the spring of 1861, on the accession of President Lincoln, and the office continued at Keller's house until its discontinuance in 1867.\n\nCanisteo post office was established 1 July 1876. It was located at the store of Andrew Johnson, on section 28, and he was appointed postmaster. This is the only store ever erected or maintained in the town. In the fall of the same year, Ole Oleson Hols bought the store and was appointed postmaster, continuing to this time.\n\nTRAGEDIES\n\nA strange coincidence is the occurrence of two suicides near Union Springs, in this township-the later case being aggravated by an accompanying murder. In 1858 a young man named David Wetherwax was on a visit of exploration to this region. He appeared cheerful, and had no known cause for melancholy, being well supplied with means. In November he hung-himself on the farm of David Michael, on section 12. The motive for his rash act is still unknown.\n\nOn the 20th of April, 1884, William Loffelmaker took his own life with a pistol, having first shot his wife, Hattie, a daughter of David Michael. The double tragedy occurred at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Loffelmaker, on a portion of the Michael farm inherited by the wife. The location is just across the county life from Canisteo, in Salem Township. The mother and other relatives of the murdered woman reside in this county, and have the sympathy of the community. The facts above related are in accordance with the verdict of the coroner's jury after viewing the bodies. Both were dead when found, about 5 p.m., and no motive for the deed can be conjectured except that continued ill-health of the suicide.\n\nSTATISTICAL\n\nThe population of Canisteo Township in 1860 included 192 males and 168 females-a total of 360. Ten years later it had more than doubled, reaching 880, and in 1880 the population was 914.\n\nIn 1860, the total valuation of taxable property was $38,851. In 1864, the assessor listed 21,307 acres, which he valued at $68,877 besides a valuation on structures of $200. Personal property was valued at $7,746, and the total thus reached $76,833.\n\nThe amount of improved lands in 1883 had increased to 23,030; and their value, with structures, was placed at $289,930, being an average per acre of $12.58. Personal property was assessed to 183 individuals, at $62849, and the total basis of taxation stood at $352,779.\n\nThe number of births and deaths recorded by the town clerks since the close of 1873-at which time the record seems to have been commenced-is as follows, 1874 to 1883 inclusive:\n\nBirths 30 28 28 22 32 20 25 18 29 Deaths 12 5 8 5 10 8 8 10 14\n\nClaremont Township\n\nSource: History of Winona, Olmsted & Dodge Counties, H. H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884) transcribed by Sandi King.\n\nThis Township, which is situated on the western side of the county and bounded on the north by Ellington, east by Wasioja, south by Ripley and west by Steele County; was first settled by a colony of New Hampshire people, and the name it bears as well as the name of the line along which they settled, \"Claremont Street,\" was given in commemoration of the town from which they came Claremont, New Hampshire. No more thrifty, intelligent people ever sought a home in the western wilds than these New Hampshire gaukees, and along no road in Dodge County can be seen more evidence of prosperity and well repaid industry than along the well-known \"Claremont Street.\" With the exception of this street, which runs through the town from east to west one and one-half miles south of the town line, the township is rather sparsely settled. This is due both to the fact that the soil in other portions is more variable in its fertility-much of it having a clayey subsoil and only slight elevation-and to the further fact that much of it is owned by non-residents. There are, however, many good farms scattered over the township. In the north-west corner of the town and lying partly in Steele County, is Rice Lake, a beautiful sheet of water by whose side a village was platted at an early day. It died in infancy, however, as did several of the villages of Dodge County. South-east of the lake on section 7, a small creek arises, called the Rice Lake branch of the Zumbro, It flows in an easterly direction south of Claremont Street, a short distance, and joins the South Middle Fork of the Zumbro, on section 14, in Wasioja township. Another small stream arising on section 21 Claremont, flows north and empties into the first named creek just south of H. M. Newhalls', on section 10. In early times this township was almost entirely devoid of trees except in the south-eastern part where there was and still is a considerable growth of timber along the South Middle Fork of Zumbro, which flowing northerly from Manchester and Prince Lakes in Ripley enters Claremont on section 33. It runs north about half-way across this section and then making a turn eastward crosses sections 34 and 5, and again enters the township of Ripley from section 36, near the south-east corner of Claremont.\n\nAt an early period, however, the settlers on the prairie began setting out trees, so that for several years now fine groves of soft maple and other trees give shade and break the force of the severe winds that in winter sweep across the open country. As an instance of the difficulties in the way of obtaining trees, Mr. Newhall relates that in 1862 he brought small cottonwoods to be transplanted across the Mississippi River in a skiff.\n\nEarly Settlement\n\nUpon one of the last days of April, 1854, Alonzo G. Way, of Clayton County, Iowa, accompanied by Judge Crary, of the same county, each mounted upon a trusty horse, started on a trip to the north for the purpose of inspecting the newly fledged territory of Minnesota and of selecting a location for future settlement. The precise road they took cannot be determined, but while crossing the open prairie some twenty miles north of Claremont, they most unexpectedly came upon a well beaten track or road leading westerly as far as the eye could reach. Upon inspection the marks of wheels and of iron-shod horse convinced them that they were near or upon the road to one of the trading posts that had for some time been established by adventurous spirits in different parts of the territory for traffic with the natives. They determined to follow the road and doing so came just as the sun was sinking behind the expanding leaves of the \"big wood\" upon the bluffs that overlook the mingling of the waters of the Cannon and Straight Rivers. There upon the level plain before them lay an Indian town with its tepees, ponies, children and dogs; but in the midst they descried a large frame house, with white painted walls and green window shutters. This, upon descending the bluffs and crossing the river, they found was the abode of that old Indian trader and hunter, Alexander Faribault. Next morning they started south, and following the valley of the Straight River, came to where the village of Medford now stands. They then crossed the timber to the east and came upon the newly erected log cabin of a man named Albin. From him they learned that to the south-east there lay a heavy body of timber surrounding a lake of considerable size. Toward this they bent their steps, and upon the fourth day of May, 1854, first beheld the clear, sparkling waters of Rice Lake and inspected the heavy timber which lined its northern shores. They made their camp and passed the night beneath the shadows of the giant trees and, for many years there might be seen upon the white blazed side of a huge oak tree as a memento of that visit the inscription: \"A. G. Way, May 5th, 1854.\"\n\nHere then was the first claim mark made by civilized man in the \"western slice\" of Dodge County a slice which was afterwards given away and now forms a part of Steele County, Minnesota. On the morrow the travelers resumed their march and skirting the north shore of the lake passed over the ground since occupied by the village of Rice Lake thence through the fine burr oak groves to the east of the lake and entered the beautiful valley along which \"Claremont street\" now runs near where the residence of Mrs. Clark now stands. They forded the stream near where the road from Mr. Kidders to the station now crosses and following the old Indian trail which passed diagonally across the prairie they crossed the ridge to the south from which they had a fine view of the valley and of the surrounding ridges. They passed on to the southeast through the timber on the Wasioja River through the towns of Ashland, Canisteo and Vernon and thence homeward through northern Iowa to their place of starting.\n\nOn arriving at home Mr. Way left his farm and business in the care of Mr. O. B. Kidder who had come west early in the spring of 1854, and started for his native State for the purpose of organizing a company or colony to take possession of and settle his newly found domains. He arrived in Claremont, New Hampshire, about the last of June and soon secured the co-operation of several young men who were willing to exchange the tread mill of a manufacturing town for free air and boundless independence of the western prairies. Among those who were ready to start immediately were Geo. O. Way, Geo. Hitchcock, B. L. Quimby, H. M. Newhall and O. F. Way while several others would start as soon as their business interests could be accommodated to the change. Mr. Way accompanied by his brother O. F. Way returned to Iowa about the second week in July. Arrived there they immediately commenced preparations for the journey to the north and early in September the white canvas covers were fitted to the wagons and provisions, tools and traps sufficient for their needs were loaded in. A cow was tied behind, the oxen were yoked in front and the \"prairie schooner\" was ready for its voyage to the north. The party consisted of A. G. Way, O. B. Kidder his son Geo. B. Kidder and O. F. Way. On the 15th of September they entered the little town of Mantorville which then contained three houses. Here the teams were left in charge of O. F. Way while the other three started to look up the valley and lake whose image had remained undimmed in the mind of Mr. Way. Their fears that the land of promise might be appropriated by other immigrants were allayed as they found it as it had been left four months before. The next day they returned to Mantorville and upon the morning of the 18th of September, 1854, they started for their final destination and ere the sun went down that day there might have been seen in a burr oak grove just east of Rice Lake the white covers of two emigrant wagons while grouped around the fire whose smoke mingled with the foliage of the trees were the four hardy men whose journey we have followed to its close.\n\nTo show how completely wild was the country to which they had come it need only be mentioned that as the trains were entering the grove there appeared about half a mile away across the creek a herd of some thirty elk feeding in peace and contentedness utterly unconscious of the near proximity of their unwelcome visitors. The next morning when the men arose and looked toward the creek they saw standing on the bank what appeared to be a horse with some kind of a vehicle attached and wading about in the water a man evidently in trouble, so hastening to his assistance they found \"old man Wells\" the companion and assistant of Faribault. He had been following the herd of elk for some days and having secured as much of venison and hides as his one Indian pony could draw had started for his home in Faribault. In attempting to cross the creek whose banks were rather high and abrupt his cart had capsized and now all his plunder of venison hides, knives, guns, etc., lay soaking in the water. While helping the ole hunter gather his traps together they tried to obtain some information of the surrounding country, but like all his class he was reticent and unwilling to talk. Among other things Alonzo Way said to him, \"There are not many springs in the country are there\" meaning of course springs of water to which Yankee statement with interrogatory attachment, the old man after some hesitancy grunted out \"wa'al, if there ar'nt many springs you'll find there's winters enuff.\" After getting his load in place the old hunter kindly gave the boys a generous piece of venison and slowly plodded his way homeward.\n\nThe immigrants now selected their claims and began preparations for their winter which the hunter prophet had foretold. Two of the party O. F. Way and Geo. B. Kidder at once staked out claims, Way on section eight and Kidder on section nine about two miles east of Rice Lake and Mr. Kidder plowed the first furrow in the township. About forty tons of hay were stacked, a cabin ten by twelve erected and such other work done as was necessary, and now Alonzo Way, O. B. and Geo. Kidder started for Iowa to finish harvesting their crops there, leaving O. F. Way, then a boy in his 'teens with a dog a gun and a cow to hold the fort. In about a week, however, his fears of passing Indians and the lonesomeness in his isolated condition were relieved by the arrival of another immigrant wagon slowing coming from Mantorville in which were Geo. O. Way and wife and Geo. Hitchcock. They had reached Iowa from the east after the others had left for Minnesota and hastily collecting together their \"household goods\" had started on after. They missed the returning teams as they took different roads and reaching Mantorville they inquired the way to the new settlement. Although the day had partly passed, impatience to reach their destination urged them forward. They, however, were compelled by darkness to camp on the way and so the oxen were unhitched the cow milked and they laid themselves down to sleep. But \"tired nature's sweet restorer balmy sleep\" was a stranger to the spot whereon they lay. A thirst as strong and as hopeless as that of \"Tantalus\" tormented them. They drained the jug. They aroused the poor old cow and drained from her the last drop of lacteal fluid she could yield, but still they could not sleep. Drink they must have. Like the \"Tramps abroad\" who shivered for a whole night within half a mile of shelter, they thirsted in utter ignorance that just over the ridge in the darkness was a little stream laughing, if water does laugh, at their discomfiture. In desperation they search the baggage. Hurrah! their hands grasp a bottle. They shake it. It rattles. Its contents are liquid without a doubt. One draws the cork and eagerly raises it to his lips swallows a draught and while tears (of joy and gratitude perhaps but tears anyway) roll down his cheeks hands it to his companion who drinks and also weeps. 'Twas a touching scene and the parties were greatly affected-probably with the reflection that nearly all of their \"peppersauce,\" and good peppersauce too, was gone. The next morning an hour's ride brought them to the cabin of Way and Kidder and Mrs. Way the first white woman to tread the soil of the beautiful valley sprang lightly to the ground. In a few weeks those who had gone to Iowa returned with supplies for the winter and a little later H. M. Newhall and B. M. Quimby joined them in the little cabin. Eight men in that one room 10x12 with its cook stove its beds and boxes and barrels, and Mrs. Way as housewife and cook. She remained until the commencement of winter when she returned to Iowa. They busied themselves in building cabins and getting ready for future work upon the land. During the winter about the 1st of February, Mr. Kidder and A. G. Way returned to Iowa and soon came back to stay with Mrs. Geo. O. Way and Mrs. Kidder and family as houses were now built to receive them. Early in the spring of 1855 there arrived from the east L. J. Mann, H. W. Hubbard and Walter Newton who took claims along the creek in the order named. Soon came J. H. Clark and John Gorham one from Texas and one from Massachusetts. Then came Nathan Waldo. Clark and Gorham took claims west of those already occupied and toward Rice Lake. The settlements around Rice Lake were also commenced that same summer by the arrival of A. B. Tiffany, Joseph Ward, John Merrill and J. B. Nichols. Last of these settlers came E. F. Way a brother of the others of that name whose introduction to the Minnesota climate and soil was as damp as that of his brother and Mr. Hitchcock's was dry. Starting from Oronoco to which place he had come by stage he set forth for Mantorville afoot but ere one half the distance was accomplished the sun had gone down and lost in the woods he concluded to stay where he was for the night. The festive musquito and all of his uncles his cousins and his aunts joined in an evening song to lull him to rest, but ere the night had passed a terrible thunder shower awoke him with its vivid flashes of lightning and pouring torrents. Twice the next day was he saturated with \"gentle\" showers but as night was drawing near he reached the haven of refuge and his future home. Other parts of the town were settled in the year 1856 mostly. Mrs. Carwright and her family arrived this year and at present four of her sons are residents of the same neighborhood in the eastern part of the town. In the southwestern corner of the town are settled a number of German families and around Claremont Station there are a good many Scotch. They are distinguished with few exceptions by all of the thrift, close economy, and exclusive attention to their own interests that characterize this nationality. The first death to occur in this township was that of Mrs. Arvilla Waldo the wife of Nathan Waldo, who died May 23d, 1858.\n\nThe first child born was a son-Horace M. Way, born to George O. and Sarah A. Way, on the 4th of July, 1855. For quite a long time the log house built by O. B. Kidder was used as a tavern, and for a while was the only one between Mantorville and Owatonna. The road was travelled largely, as it was the stage route between the towns mentioned, and the log \"hotel\" had good custom. A post office was established at an early day, and George Hitchcock appointed postmaster. The office was kept in the house of George O. Way. T.G. Patch, B. L. Quimby, H. M. Newhall, J. H. Jacoby, I. A. Collins, and George O. Way each served as postmasters. The office was changed from the street to Claremont Station when the Winona & St. Peter Railroad was built. There is also at the present time a post office near Rice Lake, bearing the name of the lake, kept by J. B. Nichols. D. P. True at an early day opend a store a short distance from O. B. Kidder's. It may also be mentioned that nearly all of the settlers on the street accomodated travellers and the stages to a greater or less extent during these early times. To H. M. Newhall belongs the honor of making the first chair manufactured in the county; - it is still preserved.\n\nRice Lake Village\n\nThe first house built on the site of this embryo city was a log one, and was erected by Ambrose B. Tiffany in 1855. It was used as a hotel; additions also were built to it. S E. Mosher built a small frame house in the fall of 1856 which was also used as a public house, and when hopes of future greatness of Rice Lake City were buoyant a gentleman-John D. Williams, from New York City-built an addition to this building, and called it the Rice Lake House. It was torn down in 1883. In 1856 a blacksmith shop was put in operation in the same vicinity by David Hunter. Another one was soon afterwards built by Harmon Ogden. Steven L. Willson opened a general merchandise store, and in 1857 platted the city of Rice Lake.\n\nIt was situated on section 6, a little north of the lake. The plat was recorded November 11th, 1857. He soon sold out to Nichols and Co., now resident parties who made an addition recorded August 26th, 1858, of land lying in the southwest quarter of section 6, Tp. 107, range 18, and in the southeast quarter of section 1, Tp. 107, range 19, west of fifth principal meridian. Another addition was recorded September 3rd, 1857, of southwest quarter of southeast quarter of section 31, Tp. 108, range 18. A post office was established there about 1858. The store of Willson's, of which we have spoken, was the second building in town, and in time gave way to a two-story frame structure that was used as a store for some time. J. P. Gurr, who went there in 1864, kept it for awhile, and afterwards put up a building of his own. When the railroad went to the south, however, he removed to Claremont Station, and Rice Lake ceased to be a trading point. Elder Shepard, the pioneer preacher of Dodge County, organized a Baptist Church at this point of about thirteen members. In 1858, a school house was erected, but the first school had been taught by Mrs. John Merrill in her own house in the summer of 1857.\n\nOrganization\n\nClaremont Township was organized May 11th, 1858, the first town meeting being held at the house of Mr. O. B. Kidder. Nathan Waldo was elected moderator, and L. F. Thompson clerk. The following town officers were elected:\n\nSupervisors-H.W. Hubbard, Chairman; John D. Williams, A. J. Whiting.\n\nTown Clerk-George Hitchcock.\n\nAssessor-J. B. Nichols.\n\nOverseer of the Poor-E. F. Way.\n\nCollector-Peter J. Houck.\n\nJustices-Nathan Waldo, J. H. Clark.\n\nConstables-O. W.

Charles Shedd.\n\nFor a time meetings were held in school houses, but at length a tasty church building was erected near the eastern end of Claremont Street, and dedicated July 21st, 1878, Rev. Dr. Cobb preaching the sermon. Elder Shedd, to whose efforts the Congregational Churches of Dodge County owe much of their prosperity, was present, and gave interesting historical reminiscences. At its organization the members were, T. J. Hunt, Henry Stevens, Mrs. Dorothy Stevens, Mrs. Elizabeth Patch, Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, Truman Patch, Mrs. Truman Patch, Mrs. E. Beckwith. Since that time the number has been increased in all to 60, of whom, however, sixteen have been either dismissed or taken to their last home. The church has been connected with that of Dodge Center, and has always been ministered to by the same pastor, toward whose salary it contributes. In the sketch of the Congregational Church will be found the names of its various pastors. The church building is valued at about $1,800.\n\nRegular Baptist.-The Baptist Church on Claremont Street was organized about the year 1875. Those who have served it as pastors are, Rev. M. House, Rev. E. P. Dye, and its present pastor, E. Westcott, since January, 1879. It has always worshiped with the congregational brethren in harmony and good friendship, each holding a service on alternate Lord's days, and all engaging in a union Sunday school.\n\nClaremont Village\n\nThe village owed its origin and first boom to the railroad company, or rather to H. C. Atkins, the superintendent of the company, As soon as the road was built and cars began to run thereon, a warehouse was brought from Winona and put up-the same now owned by John Edmond-and parties began buying wheat for the Railroad Company. John McCoy was their first agent. A town site was surveyed in July, 1866, of south half of north-west quarter and north half of south-west quarter of section 28, township 107, range 18, by H. C. Atkins, and the construction of an immense elevator begun the same fall. This building, when finished, had a capacity of 80,000 bushels and cost $37,500. Building began about the same time, and besides the dwelling house erected by Charles Riddle, two stores were built and stocked, the first by J. H. Jacoby and the next by Marshall Brothers. This second store was stocked by James King. It is the building now occupied by James Edmond as an agricultural implement store.\n\nThe Postoffice of Claremont street was removed to the new station and J. H. Jacoby appointed Postmaster.\n\nIn the early spring of 1867, William McLaughlin put up a hotel building. He before this time had handled lumber for Laird & Norton, of Winona. During the summer, also Youman Bros, and Hodgins put into the town a very large stock of lumber. J. H. Jacoby was their agent.\n\nThree other stores were added this spring, 1867; one was built by George Hoffman and Orlo Way; another by William Hubbard, and the third by J. P. Gurr, who put up quite a large building and stocked it partly with goods brought from Rice Lake, where he had been trading. His stock of goods was the most extensive which had so far been offered for sale, comprising hardware, dry goods, groceries, etc. He also engaged in buying wheat to some extent; also shipped farmers' produce, etc.\n\nThe hubbard store was rented to Hoffman & Way, who put groceries in stock. A blacksmith shop was built in the spring by Thomas Russell. Two others were added to the place soon, one by ______Gifford; the other by Joshua Fairbank.\n\nA school was taught this summer by Miss Grinnell of Fairbault, Rice County, in the old warehouse building. Religious services were held at the same place by the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists and United Brethren.\n\nDaniel Crane started a shoe shop. Everything looked favorable for the future of Claremont until Dodge Center was started, and Atkins, the patron of Claremont, succeeded by Stewart who became interested in the growth of Dodge Center. No additions were made to the mercantile establishments or dwellings of the village after 1870 worth noting, and in fact several buildings were moved away. But the good crop of 1877 put new life into all the arteries of trade and the business of Claremont increased considerably. About 1875, however, a joint stock company was organized, composed mostly of farmers, which was known as the Claremont Flouring and Mill Company. John Edmond was President and David Downey the first miller. Claremont is not situated near to any stream, nor in the timber, but it is finely located for wind. Nothing impedes the movements of heaven's gentle breezes and no wonder that the worthy denizens of Claremont and vicinity should conceive the idea of utilizing their advantages by constructing a wind-mill and compel the winds so frolicsome with barns, haystacks and fields of grain, to settle down to the sober business of grinding wheat and corn. At any rate about 1874 or 5, the mill was built at a cost of about $11,000. The serial engine or wind-wheel was sixty feet in diameter.\n\nFor some time the mill was rented, but in time it passed from the hands of the joint stock company into the possession of J. G. Briggs and Charles Gallup who own and operate it at present, The \"big\" elevator burned on the 23rd of November, 1878. At this time it was owned by Van Dusen & Co., who soon erected on its site the present elevator building. In 1879 D. C. Fairbank built an elevator which he still owns and operates, In 1878 H. C. Rand began a large brick block which was completed the next year. He put a good stock of general merchandise in when the building was finished. Richard Rockwell erected a hardware store in 1878 and stocked it. The building is now occupied by _____ Thuett. In 1879 Ross & Keefe opened a furniture store. In 1880 Henry Bielenberg built a brick store and filled it with general merchandise. The Catholic Church was built in 1881. No school house was erected in the village until about 1878, when the present commodious one was built. Up to this time the schools were kept either in the warehouse where Miss Grinnell taught, or in the hall above J. Edmond's store. A Presbyterian church is the only religious organization in town with the exception of the Catholic. This church was organized in 1867 or 8 by Rev. Sheldon Jackson or by George Ainslee. The present church edifice, worth about $1,000, was secured through the labors of Rev. J. L. Gage, the pastor of the church at the time it was erected. The people of the village irrespective of denominational sympathies, subscribed liberally and some aid was received from the Church Erection Board. Services are now held each Sabbath by the Presbyterians, but the church has been used at various times by other denominations. The church has as nearly as can be learned between forty and sixty members. The brevity and incompleteness of this sketch of the Presbyterian church is due to our inability to secure the necessary information or access to the records.\n\nThe village of Claremont was incorporated as such by a special act of the Legislature, approved March 11, 1878. The territory so incorporated being all of section 28, town 107 north, range 18 west of fifth principal meridian. The first election under its charter was held April 1st. 1878. Following is a list of officers elected up to date: April 1, 1878-\n\nPresident-John Edmond.\n\nRecorder-George Thuett.\n\nTreasurer-H. Bielenberg.\n\nMarshal-C. M. Martin.\n\nJustice-C.

Publishers (1884)} Transcribed by Brenda Becker\n\nConcord township is the middle of the three townships that lie in the northern tier of Dodge County. It is bounded on the north by Goodhue County, east by Milton, south by Wasioja and west by Ellington township. It is the best agricultural township in Dodge county; is almost entirely composed of high rolling prairie, and, although now well covered with groves which have been set out for ornamentation and windbreaks by its inhabitants, in early times was devoid of timber except in the north east corner and along the river. The north middle fork of the Zumbro enters the township from the west in two creeks, which unite on section seven and flows northeasterly, crossing the line into Milton on section 24. Another stream, Milliken creek, flows along the southern border of the township in an easterly direction, crossing sections 31-2-3-4-5 and 36. There is hardly any waste land in the town, and its reputation as a good farming town is beyond dispute.\n\nEARLY SETTLEMENT.\n\nOn the 5th of April 1854, a company of explorers from Iowa and Pennsylvania came up from Mantorville, where they had camped the night previous, to Concord. Some of the party staked out claims, and upon the 15th they cut logs and built a house for James M. Sumner. This was the first habitation within the limits of Dodge county. On the following day, however, two more were erected on the present site of Mantorvile. Mr. Sumner and M. B. Dolson were the only ones to take claims here at this time. Dolson built no house, but simply staked out his claim and returned to Iowa for his family, with whom he arrived on the 12th of May. A temporary shelter was found in Sumner's house and on the 14th a son was born to Mrs. Dolson, and was in due time christened Morris.\n\nThis was the first birth in the county. Mr. Dolson immediately began breaking, preparatory to putting in a crop. He planted potatoes, corn, etc., and this was the first farming done in the county.\n\nHis claim was on section 15, and Sumner's on section 23, where the village of Concord is now. There was a beautiful grove of native oaks where Sumner's house stood, and for some time the place was known as Sumner's grove.\n\nIn May, A. N. Smith arrived, staked out a claim and built a house. His wife and her two boys H. A. and Albert came in October; Henry Putnam came with them. Putnam was afflicted, like many frontiermen, with ague. As an instance of the precocity of the youthful intellect of Minnesota, it is related that the younger of these lads said to his mamma when he saw the invalid taking his medicine, \"Ma, give me some of that brandy, I's 'e just as cold as Put.- J. P. Rions came September 20th, made a claim on section 22 and cut and hauled logs for a house. He returned east for his family and reached Minnesota again the following spring. C. F. Hathaway came with Smith and Putnam, made a claim on section 25, and with the latter, occupied the former's claim during his absence through the summer. Wm. Churchill also made a claim in the northeast corner of the town, built a shanty and broke several acres of ground but did not settle upon it. Most of the settlers had laid in a store of provisions for the winter, but in some cases they were poorly supplied.\n\nMr. A. N. Smith had teams hauling provisions from Dubuque, but they were delayed by stress of weather. He had sold off his own stock to less fortunate neighbors until his larder was nearly exhausted. He accordingly took his gun and started after game. He tramped all day and saw nothing, till just at night, when he succeeded in killing a fine buck. The wolves were out in full force, and he dared not attempt to cross the prairie with his game, so he built a fire and camped on the creek over night.\n\nThe next day his trains laden with supplies arrived. The spring and summer of 1855 brought quite an influx of settlers, among whom were Sylvester Ford, M. H. Le Monyon, N. A Britt, George Strok, H. Andrews, Sam'l Read, and others. Mr. Britt took the claim upon which Churchill had made improvements the year before, but as he had vacated it and left it untenanted for over nine months, Britt considered he had a legal right to it. He accordingly ploughed and planted the ground and removed his family to the house. He moved in on Friday, and on Sunday Wm. Churchill in company with his brother Isaiah, called to talk about the claim. They had made a previous demand upon him to vacate the claim which he refused to obey. After a time spent in conversation Britt accompanied by the two Churchills went out to look at his horse. As they passed over a little creek near the house Wm. Churchill grappled with Britt, threw him to the ground and called on his brother to bring a rope, which they had in readiness. Mrs. Britt seeing her husband set upon by two men ran to his assistance, but being a slender woman and in feeble health she could offer no effectual aid, and she soon saw him bound and hurried away. The agonized wife followed as rapidly as was possible, carrying her little girl of three years in her arms, two other girls, five and seven years of age, followed her footsteps. Nearly all of that day she searched for her husband, but without success, and as night approached, fatigued and almost broken hearted, she returned to her desolate home. After giving her little children some supper she made up a bundle and prepared to spend the night in the woods, as she dared not stay in the house. When she was ready to start, two men Wm. Fry and a Mr. Wilson, entered the house.\n\nThey were strangers to her but friends, and heralded the coming of her husband, whom she soon saw approaching.\n\nIt appears that the Churchill's had taken Britt to a grove of timber where, by threats of instant death should he refuse, they had forced him to make them a bill of sale of all his personal property and an agreement to quit the claim. Several lawsuits were the result of this operation, which ended, however, in Britt's retaining the claim. In March, 1855, Samuel Reed and Thomas Johnson visited Dodge County, and on their return to Alamakee County, Iowa, gave such glowing accounts of the country that other members of their families determined to visit and perhaps settle in it. Accordingly, in the spring of 1856, Mr. Reed and his family, Logan Johnson and David Tyson-a son-in-law of Thomas Johnson- started from Iowa with two breaking teams of oxen, six yoke in each team. They arrived in Concord upon the 4th of June, and began operations at once. Samuel Reed located upon the southwest quarter of section 7, Milton, but his sons settled in Concord-George T. on section 12, Morris E. on section 12 also(the southeast quarter); William M. on section 13. Josiah D., the eldest son, did not come until 1857. He then obtained 80 acres of his father's on section 13. Johnson settled on section 12, and Tyson on section 11, where he put up a house. Here a part of the party lived, and the others stayed at the house of Samuel Reed, in Milton. Mr. Tyson's wife died in the May following, and he sold his claim and returned to Iowa, selling his claim through M. Wray, who came that spring, to O. H. Everts, who still occupies it.\n\nAll of the Reed family are gone from Concord at the present time, except Morris E., who still resides, a prosperous farmer, upon the claim he originally pre-empted.\n\nOn the 14th of June, this same year, came Eliphalet Bean, with his family, and settled on section 8. His brother John took a claim on section 7. His father, John K. Bean, settled upon the same section. Lyman Fuller had taken a claim the year before on section 8. Mr. Bean lived in his wagon during the summer, but hauled enough lumber from Red Wing to build in the fall. He put up the first granary in the township. A painful event occurred this winter, which was a terribly severe one. Just before Christmas, the wife of Lyman Fuller, while on her way home with an ox team, got out to go afoot for a short distance. For what reason it is impossible to tell, she took a different road from the one the team followed, and which it went on home. She wandered until at length she sank and was found in the cold snow- a shroud for her eternal sleep.\n\nThe southern portion of Concord was settled largely by a colony from Lowell, Massachusetts. The party received its impetus from Isaac Milliken, who visited Minnesota in 1855. Sixteen young men started from Lowell in the spring of 1856, and from Dubuque started afoot across the country for Minnesota. Nine reached Dodge county, several of whom are still residents here. On section 34, A. B. woods and a brother, D. L. Woods, found their homes, and reside on the original claims yet. The others who settled in the near vicinity were Isaac Milliken, Josiah Shaw, Henry Hasey, D. E. Sawyer, David Dow, Aphas B. Russ and ---- . Cheney. The last soon sold to M. D. Underwood, who became a well-known citizen of the county.\n\nAll of this party, with the exception A. B. woods, were married men at the time, and of course, their wives came as soon as accommodations could be provided for them. For the first summer, however, they ran a couple of genuine bachelor frontier establishments-one on A. B. Woods place, and the other on M. D. Underwood's, and fed on pancakes ad libitum. Snakes, it is said were remarkably thick at that time. A. B. Woods killed sixty-six at one butchery. Now, a rattlesnake bite is, without doubt, both uncomfortable and dangerous. So the settlers kept plenty of antidote medicine at hand. About two gallons for each man was considered the necessary quantity to be held in reserve. Deer were plenty, and during the winters the settlers labored diligently to thin their number. A. B. Woods and Mr. Hasey started one day on a little hunting trip, but as it began to snow and night was approaching, they concluded they might as well give up the chase and return home. So they started, and by daylight next morning found themselves beyond Rice Lake, sixteen miles away.\n\nThey had lots of exercise before they got home, as the snow was about two feet deep, and they had also developed pretty good appetites. The northwest corner of the town was settled by James and Robert Cain, in 1857. The town plat of Concord was surveyed between May 30th and June 7th, 1856, and occupied a part of the west half of section 23. It was put on record by Hammond and Wright, and T. J. Lowry, B. S. Cooks, James M. Sumner, T. G. Ingraham, and E. Williams were also interested in the town site.\n\nThe location was a desirable one, and a good water power on the Zumbro River, near at hand, made the future prospect all the more promising.\n\nMessrs. Cook and Ingraham built a store and stocked it with general merchandise. The same building is now occupied for the same purpose by W. G. Avery. Mr. Sumner built a commodious house and opened it as a hotel. It was the first and only hotel in Concord, and for many years was kept by J. P. Rions. L. S. Rossiter is the present landlord. In 1856 John South built a flouring mill in Eagle Valley, two miles above the village, which is still in operation-as a feed mill, however- and it is upon the only improved water power in town.\n\nS. S. Worthing built a blacksmith shop in the summer of 1855. The first store in town was started by Hammond and Wright in the fall of 1855. The next blacksmith shop was put in by L. P. Hill. J. M. Sumner became the first postmaster, and J. P. Rions was 'Route Agent' on the line between Mantorville and Concord. He made forty trips, afoot, for one dollar a trip. It once happened that two strangers arrived in Mantorville wishing to go to Concord. They were told the mail would go as soon as the eastern mail arrived. So they waited to go with it. Rions, throwing the bag over his shoulder, told them to come on and they could have a free ride on the Foot & Walker Line. This called for a treat, but, strange to say, Shrober-the 'host' at Mantorville - had no whisky. It is hard to believe, but we must rely upon the veracity of the old settlers.\n\nIn 1857, Blakesley and Norman built a steam saw mill which added greatly to the convenience of the settlers. Lyman Berry started a boot and shoe shop. In 1866, Orcutt & Co. started a wagon shop, which is now operated by T. J. Dikes.\n\nThe first school was taught in a little building near where the Christian Church now stands, in May and June, 1855. Miss Cornelia Grems, of Milton, was the teacher. No religious services were held until the summer of 1856, when the Rev. J. M. Rogers, a M. E. clergyman, held services in the school house. The village has remained about the same as in early times. Usually, two stores have shared the trade, but three have been in operation at the same time. The people of Concord are industrious, intelligent and independent. No liquor has ever been sold in this place, and the moral and religious element stand forth pre-eminent. The first marriage of parties living in Concord was that of John Hart and Amanda Orcutt, and it occurred in the fall of 1855. The first death was that of a child of Mr. C. Amalong, which lived but a few hours after its birth.\n\nThe township was organized May 11th, 1858, the first election being held in the house of J. M. Sumner.

It has, from its earliest beginning, been one of the recognized powers for good in the immediate neighborhood of its location, having, in the last few years, greatly enlarged its field of usefulness, until at the present writing (A.D., 1884) it is the strongest and most influential body of Christians in the township-if not in the county.\n\nFrom a very small beginning, it has passed through many vicissitudes in reaching its present prosperous condition. It has, in its time, experienced some of the severest seasons of adversity, and also has enjoyed its reaping times of prosperity.\n\nSomething more than a quarter of a century ago, and soon after this country began to be settled, the little settlement of pioneers located near Fair Point were called together on the occasion of the death of a little child of Benjamin Woodward, one of the early settlers in that neighborhood. D. M. Haggard, then a young man residing there, a disciple-but not a preacher at that time-was requested by the parents of the deceased child to conduct a brief religious service at the funeral. He complied as best he could. This seems to have been the cause of first introducing the idea of holding religious meetings in the community. They were continued from house to house, led by D. M. Haggard, and resulted in an organization of a Church of Disciples, composed of a few brethren and sisters, residing, some in Goodhue, and some in Dodge County. Ten persons had their names enrolled, and these constituted the nucleus of the Church of Christ, now at Concord. This little organization was effected in the house of Benjamin Woodward, March 14th, 1858.\n\nNames enrolled: D. M. Haggard, elder; L.P. Hill, deacon; Mary Haggard, Christine Hill, Benj. Woodward, Hannah A. Woodward, Redding Woodward, T. B. Haggard, E. Tilden, and Elizabeth Tunks. In 1859 the place of meeting for the congregation was changed from the neighborhood at Fair Point to Eagle Valley. The first meeting of importance was held by Walter Morris in the dwelling house of Austin Tilden, which meeting resulted in gaining several additions to the little band, and placing it upon stronger grounds in various respects.\n\nIn 1860 the community joined together and erected a log house at Eagle Valley, to be used for church and school purposes. This afforded a permanent place for the meetings of the church, where they were continued regularly until the old log house gave out, and was succeeded by a neat frame. This the church continued to use till they moved into their present commodious building.\n\nDuring all these years the congregation had been ministered to by a number of preachers. At different times prosperous revival meetings cheered them on to new activities. Charles Levan, in 1859, held a series of meetings in the school house in the village of Concord, with good results. D. M. Haggard (who, since first mentioned, became a prominent preacher), was the first pastor for the congregation.\n\nThe following-named persons have ministered to the church at different times in their order: D. M. Haggard, Charles Levan, Walter Morris, Charles Rowe, T. T. VanDolah, A. P. Frost (first as traveling evangelist), R. B. Hunt, Samuel P. Johnson, D. M. Miles, James McGuire, John Truax, A. P. Frost, and J. M. McReynolds. This brings us to January 1st, 1884.\n\nMuch of the time during these years, the church was without regular preaching, being taught by the eldership, to whose efficiency the congregation owes much for its permanency at present. Much praise is due to A. Tilden and M. Wray, who have served the church with constancy and fidelity, from a very early period to the present time. The Sunday School, under the efficient management of its various superintendents, has been, and is still, a mighty auxiliary to the work of the church- a large proportion of the members in latter years coming down from the Sunday School.\n\nBut it was not until the completion and dedication of their present commodious house of worship in the village of Concord, that the church came out in habiliments worthy the sacrificing devotion of the true and the tried. Few can appreciate this wonderful achievement. Few in numbers, none rich in purse, but fully alive to the necessity, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, harmoniously, determinately, did they-devoutly asking God's blessing to go with them-set to work; and under the skillful management of a judicious building committee, presided over by M. Wray, and seconded by the hearty co-operation and liberal contributions of the brethren within-and many friends from without-the work of building the new edifice was pushed forward without hindrance to final completion-at a cost reaching nearly $3,000.\n\nAt the suggestion of John Truax, pastor W. H. Rogers, of Minneapolis, was invited to assist in the dedicatory services, January 1, 1879, all remaining indebtedness (only $150.00) being provided for, the house was duly set apart to the service of Almighty God. W. H. Rogers continued several weeks in a series of interesting revival meetings, resulting in over forty accessions to the church. Since this, the church has enjoyed almost uninterrupted prosperity-now numbering over 150 communicants, with a prosperous Sunday-school of an average attendance of about 120. Dr. C. P. Gibson, Superintendent, S. J. Sherwood, Assistant, and a full corps of competent teachers, are in charge of this work.\n\nPresent officers of the church: A. Tilden and M. Wray, Elders; John Truax, temporary Pastor; A. Myers, C. Spreiter, Jos. Barns, S. J. Sherwood and Dr. C. P. Gibson, Deacons.\n\nSince the organization of the church, up to the present, there have been some six hundred names on the church register.\n\nThe Baptist Church of Concord was organized in 1863. The constituent members were E. Wescott, W. C. Taylor, S. W. Pierce, G. Durfey, E. W. Wescott, G. I. Pierce, their wives, and C. R. Wescott, Susan F. Wescott, Sarah A. Orcutt, Italia Orcutt, Lavinia Ford and E. Stedman. Rev. E. Wescott was chosen pastor, and W. C. Taylor, Deacon E. W. Wescott, Clerk.\n\nIn 1866, E. Wescott was followed as pastor by Rev. V. B. Conklin. In 1870, however, Rev. E. Wescott became again the pastor and during this period of his service the present church edifice was built, at an expense of nearly $2,000. The different pastors of the church from 1877-when Rev. E. Wescott's labors with them ceased for a time-were in succession: Revs. E. P. Dye, W. C. Woodruff, R. H. Shaftoe and G. D. Ballentine. E. Wescott again resumed service in 1883.\n\nThis church has had the common experience in the vicissitudes of life, but is vigorous and harmonious. Its services are regularly maintained and it has a membership of over fifty persons. A good Sabbath-school is maintained in connection with it.\n\nThe Wesleyan Methodist Church of West Concord was organized by Rev. D. F. Shepardson on the 15th of April, 1877, with a membership of twenty-six. Three persons have since joined, and seven have been granted letters of dismissal. The services have been held in the school-house of District No. 9, in West Concord once in two weeks. A Union Sabbath-school is held at the same place each Sabbath. Those who have served this church as pastors, named in succession, are: Revs. Robert Hardy, Charles Cox, James Knapinberger, Clark Norton, -----Rhodes and George Reeves.\n\nWashington Lodge, No. 38, A. F. & A. M.-This Lodge was organized at Wasija originally and maintained a good working organization there for several years. In March, 1878, their hall in Wasioja village was burned to the ground and all their books, records, etc., were destroyed. It therefore, is impossible to give the list of officers for the period preceding this catastrophe.\n\nAt that time several members had been dismissed to form a Lodge in Dodge Center. The others removed their Lodge to Concord, where it still is. The officers of 1877 before the destruction of the hall, were: --\n\nS. S. Hitchcock, W. M.\n\nW. H. Vinton, S. W.\n\nLeonard Spreiter, J. W.\n\nH. C. Sheldon, Secretary.\n\nThe officers from 1879 are -\n\n1879\n\nM. G. Peters, W.M.\n\nH. C. Sheldon, S. W.\n\nF. W. Benjamin, J.

H. Hill & Co. Publishers (1884); transcribed by Sheila Gruver\n\nIn 1866, during the summer, the Winona & St. Peter Railroad was built from Kasson westward through Dodge county. The first station actually located west of Kasson, was Claremont; but the question of a depot at some intermediate point, was agitated considerably. In the woods near the railroad bridge across the south Middle Fork of the Zumbro, lived A.B. Wellman, Onias Hall and others, who made efforts for its location in that vicinity, where once the town of Hallowell had been begun, but the steepness of the grade, on either side of the stream, rendered the project impossible. Accordingly, in the summer of 1867, Wellman and Hall bought 80 acres of land of Eli B. Ayars on section 34 in the township of Wasioja with the understanding between them and Atkins the Superintendent of the road that a depot should be located thereon. Nothing was done, however, during the season toward the development of the town, except the moving in of a dwelling house by Samuel Geer, from Sacramento, and another building by J. J. Mattocks, which was used for a hotel. In the fall D. C. Fairbank, of Waupun, Wisconsin, became interested in the project and took a half interest in the town plat, only partially surveyed at the time, with Wellman and Hall. A side track was put in and he erected a small grain warehouse upon it, in which R. B. Nims acted as station agent for A. A. Fairbank, a brother and agent of D. C. Fairbank, and who at that time was located at Rochester. Late this fall, also the town proprietors build a two story building (the one now occupied as a hardware store by Charles), in which R. B. Miller, of Mantorville, put a large stock of goods. C. H. Crandall first sold goods in this store, but in the spring of 1868, his place was taken by D. A. Shaw. He built a store for himself and stocked it. It was afterward destroyed by fire.\n\nThe man who had the honor of first selling goods in Dodge Center was D. L. Tyler, who came from the town of Ashland and put up a shanty probably in the early spring of 1867 upon the corner now occupied by the Underwood block. He bought his goods at Wasioja, Mantorville or Kasson, as the condition of the market demanded, and freighted them to his establishment on his back in a satchel. He used to flag the trains occasionally before a permanent station was established, and was appointed Postmaster in the summer or fall of 1867. He also built an addition to his store in the spring of 1868. In the fall of 1867, a blacksmith shop was started by D. L. Franklin and a stock of lumber offered for sale by S. P. Kinney. With the opening of spring in 1868, building operations were resumed and several additions made to the business facilities of the place. Albert Palmerlee, who had previously traded some in a small shanty erected a good sized grocery store and stocked it, H.A. Vickery built a furniture store. The store which Kraff erected has already been mentioned and Shaw and Campbell built a grain warehouse north of where Dr. Garverâs house now stands.\n\nS. P. Kinney bought the house of J. J. Mattocks, re-built it and made additions and used it for a hotel. In the summer of 1870 he obtained the patronage of the railroad company, of which __ Stewart was now the superintendent, and who, with other officers of the road had become interested in property matters in and about Dodge Center, and for several years had the railway eating house in addition to his ordinary hotel business. The house had an excellent reputation and large patronage. Mr. Kinney also, in the summer of 1868, together with John Fulton and Onias Hall, built another store and filled it with hardware. The lumber trade was carried on after a short time by John Gill, who, in the spring of 1868 had put in some capital with Kinney in the business.\n\nJ. Rusha had a shoe shop in connection with his dwelling.\n\nIn 1869 N. M. Vance added a drug store to the business of the town. The first doctor to permanently locate in the place was Dr. S. L. Ranson, who is a physician there at the present time. He came to Dodge Center in 1870 and during the next year with Thuett Brothers built a block, one store of which he occupied as a drug store, and in the other Thuett Brothers put a large stock of hardware.\n\nIn the winter of 1868-9 A. N. Smith and M. D. Underwood moved into the village from Concord township, and bought the interest of A. B. Wellman in the town site, also the grain warehouse in which Shaw and Campbell first bought wheat, and the station which had been in D. C. Fairbanks warehouse was now changed to theirs, and a small addition was made to the building for that purpose.\n\nA. N. Smith was agent for a short time, but was succeeded by M. D. Underwood, who retained the position for several years. The present depot was built in 1871. In the spring of 1869, in the month of March, the town proprietors, D. C. Fairbanks, Onias Hall, A. N. Smith, and M. D. Underwood completed the survey of the village of Dodge Center plat, and it was recorded in July, 1869. The territory embraced was the north half of southwest quarter of section 34, town 107, range 17, west. To this an addition was made by Eli B. Ayars of a part of south half of southwest quarter of section 34, and recorded August 20th, 1875.\n\nFairbank and Stewart had before this made a survey on section 33 on June 24th, 1874, of an addition which was placed on record the 23rd of October, 1874. For several years now the development of Dodge Center was quite rapid. As its name indicates, it is situated very near the geographical center of the county, and has no rival in the shipping trade except Kasson, which is about six miles east. The good will and practical aid of the railroad for some time gave it a strong impetus. It became for a time the only shipping point of much importance in the county, and one of the best on the line of the railroad. It still retains its pre-eminence as a shipping point for grain and stock. Its largest elevator, which is owned by D. C. Fairbank, was transported in part by him from Cambria, Wisconsin, in 1872.\n\nIn 1874, M. R. Dresbach and others, under the name of Nims, Dresbach & Co., built a warehouse and elevator which, after it became the sole property of M. R. Dresbach he sold to A. E. Robbins. It is at present owned by D. C. Fairbank, and used by him for a warehouse. When the depot was built the warehouse in which the station had been located was bought by A. L. Wellman, and in part removed farther west upon the side track. It was afterwards bought by Van Dusen & Co., and an addition built about 1876. In 1874 a large brick block was built by M. D. Underwood and Levi Leighton on the north side of Main Street. In 1875 T.J. Hunt erected the brick building in which his drug store and the post office are at present kept, and Thuett Brothers built their brick hardware store in 1877.\n\nIn 1874 O. H. Benton opened the first law office in the village and also took editorial charge of the Dodge Center Press, the pioneer paper of the place.\n\nThe village of Dodge Center was incorporated as such by a special act of legislature approved February 29th, 1872, and thereby made a municipal corporation with all of the powers and privileges incident thereto. The territory included under this act is the east half of section 33, and all of section 34, township 107, rang(e) 17. This act was amended February 11th 1874, and again by an act approved March 9th, 1878, by which all previous legislation in relation to the matter was repealed.\n\nA fire which destroyed several thousand dollarsâ worth of property occurred in 1875, on the north side of Main Street, but the buildings then destroyed have been replaced by others. The town has also suffered from some severe wind storms, but not so much as to disturb for a long time its equilibrium.\n\nIts schools for the last three years have been under the operation of the High School law of this state, and will graduate their first class in 1885. A school house in which religious meetings were held at an early day was moved in from the country. A hall above Vanceâs store also served for some time as a place for public gatherings. A bank was established by C. Hardin & Son in 1873. In 1879 the whole business was taken in charge by D. S. Hardin, who was succeeded by Parsons Brothers in October, 1881, the present bankers of the town.\n\nThe village was organized under its charter February 20th, 1874. At an election held in Palmerleeâs Hall, ninety-one votes were polled, and the following officers were elected:\n\nPresident ---- C. D. Tuthill.\n\nTrustees ---- W. A. Patterson, J. C. Campbell, and Daniel Lockwood.\n\nRecorder ---- M. D. Underwood\n\nJustice of the Peace ---- C. D. Tuthill.\n\nConstable ---- J. E. Gettman.\n\nThere were also fifty-six votes against licensing the sale of intoxicants to thirty-one for. Following is a list of the officers of the village to the present time:\n\nPresident. Trustees. Recorder. Justice.\n\n1875 - D. S. Hardin, L. B. Nims, A. F. Lesher, T. J. Hunt, C. H. Benton, L. B. Nims,\n\n1876 - D. S. Hardin, A. F. Lesher, H. C. Sikes, A. L. Wellman, C. H. Benton, L.

Phillips.\n\nOn Nov. 14th, 1874 appeared Dodge Centerâs first newspaper, under the title of (the) The Dodge Center Press. It was founded by J. A. Haines and C. H. Benton, under the name of Haines & Co., Benton had editorial charge and filled that position until January 30th, 1875.\n\nHaines then run (sic) the paper alone for about a month, when Jesse D. Carr became his partner.\n\nThe next fall Haines sold his interest to Carr, who assumed sole management during the following winter. In May, 1866, O. H. Phillips bought a half interest, and in July purchased the remainder.\n\nHe run (sic) the paper for the next three years. E. R. Patrick was however associated with him about one year of this time. In April, 1879, he sold to J. M. Miles, who continued the publication of the paper for about eleven months, and removed it to Brookings, D.T. The town was then without a paper for a short time, but in June, 1880, R. McNeill started The Dodge Center Index, which was bought October 11th, 1883, by O. H. Phillips, its present editor and publisher.\n\nRelief Lodge No. 108, A.F. and A.M. â This lodge was organized in Dodge Center, March 10th, 1873, under a dispensation from the grand lodge of the State. The petitioners for dispensation were; A. L. Wellman, M. D. Underwood, John Gill, Jr., G. Bentliff, B. M. Owen, A. S. Parlmerlee, Isaac Ellston, D. L. Franklin, O. H. Phillips, S. P. Kinney, E. K.

Coleman. These petitioners were then members of various lodges in Minnesota and Wisconsin. A charter was granted and numbered 108 upon January 14th, 1874.\n\nThe result of an election of officers under the charter was as follows: A. L. Wellman, W.M.; A. P. Hall, S.W.; F. W. Evarts, J.W.\n\nAt no time in its history has the lodge been as prosperous as under the dispensation, having at the time of receiving its charter a membership of about forty-five. At the present time however there are fifty-eight members, and the lodge is in good working condition. Following is a list of officers since 1875.\n\n1875 - A. L. Wellman, W.M.; D. L. Franklin, S.W.; J. D. Gettman, J.W.\n\n1876 - A. L. Wellman, W.M.; O. H. Phillips, S.W.; J. E. Gettman, J.W.\n\n1877 - O. H. Phillips, W.M.; J. E. Gettman, W.M.; G. W. Ballard, J.W.\n\n1878 - J. E.

Franklinâs blacksmith shop, the same building that is now occupied by Crail. In 1874, when the Underwood & Leighton block was erected a hall was arranged for their especial benefit in view of a permanent occupancy. When, however, Wescott & Steer purchased the building a question arose in regard to rent, and the lodge crossed the way and fitted up a hall on the other side of the building, which they occupy at present. Although, not a large room, it is well furnished.\n\nLeader Lodge No. 41, I.O.O.F. â this lodge of Dodge Center, Minn., was instituted May 22nd, 1873 by the meeting of the grand masters of the State, with a number of members of lodges from Owatonna and Rochester, Minn.

From thence the lodge was removed to a room over the store occupied by W. E. Fairbank, on the corner of Main and Prospect Streets, thence to over the store occupied by R. G. Hill.\n\nThey then took up their present quarters in the brick block, erected by Underwood & Leighton, where they have a large and finely furnished hall. The membership is now fifty-six, and the lodge is one of the best in Southern Minnesota.\n\nSummit Lodge No. 25, A.O.U.W. â This lodge was organized at Dodge Center, September 5th, 1877, by the initiation of fifteen charter members, by district deputy P.M.W.A.

Large accessions however have been received from time to time, and the membership at present is about thirty. The meetings have usually been held in Odd Fellows hall in Dodge Center. The membership is scattered over the western and central parts of the county, and is composed largely of the farming population.\n\nThe lodge is in a healthy condition, and is constantly making additions to its members.\n\nCHURCHES.\n\nCongregational Church of Dodge Centre. â In 1851 (November 16th), the first church of their denomination in Minnesota was organized at what is now Minneapolis and this remained the only one until 1853 when Cottage Grove and Excelsior joined the list and in turn these three were the only ones until 1855 when three more were added, and in 1856 seven more, in 1858 three, and to these in 1859 nine more, two of these last being the churches at Mantorville and Wasioja; this first being about three months the eldest. The first meeting looking to the organization of the church in Wasioja was held May 22d, 1858 in the house of Mr. Campbell at which a committee consisting of Rev. Charles Shedd, Dr. J. A. Garver and Moses Gallup were appointed to draft a confession of faith and covenant which was duly reported and adopted at a subsequent meeting in the house of Moses Gallup, June 5th. The following day being Sunday the church was organized with six members conditionally until letters of dismissal should be received form their former churches. June 19th another meeting was held at which Silas Beckwith of Claremont was elected deacon and the following persons handed in their letters from their respective churches; J. A. Garver and wife from 3d Presbyterian Church of Oxford, Ohio. Charles E. Gallup from 1st Congregational Church Voluntown, Connecticut; Mrs. Tabitha L. Gallup 1st Congregational Church, Plainfield, Vermont; Mrs. Mary Campbell, 1st Presbyterian Church, Dubuque, Iowa; Mrs. C. S. Doud, Congregational Church, Vergennes, Vermont; S. S. Beckwith and wife Owatonna Circuit M.E. Church.\n\nThese early records are in the hand writing of Dr. J. A. Garver first clerk of the church and written in a book evidently not designed for that especial purpose containing many business and professional memorandums.\n\nJuly 4th, 1858, Mrs. L. S. Rossiter and Wm. Spaulding were added to the membership on profession of faith making the member at that time ten. The total membership in the twenty-five years has been seventy of whom ten have died in fellowship with the church and twenty-nine were dismissed by letters to other churches. The present membership is twenty-four. Rev. Father Shedd continued as pastor until 1875. He was succeeded by Rev. L. Loring during whose six months pastorate it was voted to remove the church to Dodge Center assuming its present name.\n\nThe society was legally incorporated June 10th, 1870, with D. A. Armstrong, J. C. Gettys, C. E. Gallup, Wm. Garrison, T. J. Hunt and H. A. Vickery as its first trustees. Rev. Francis McCracken was pastor from August, 1875 to August, 1877, Rev. A. J. Drake (under whose determined efforts the present fine church edifice was erected, dedicated Jan. 19th, 1879) from September, 1877 to October, 1880. The pulpit has been occupied by the present incumbent Rev. A. H. Tebetts since 1880. The places of worship have been many and various. First in private dwellings then in the old Wasioja school house to the east of that village (now Henry Fleeners dwelling) in town hall. The seminary and the Baptist Church, at Dodge Center in the M.E. Church. S.D.B. Church and finally in its own permanent house now happily free from all incumbrances of debt.\n\nThe church edifice referred to is a fine brick structure well furnished inside and at the present (1884) is being adorned with a good spire.\n\nRegular Baptist Church. â Was organized in 1874 with nearly twenty members under the labors of Rev. Walter Ross who served them till 1877, when Rev. E. Wescott preached for them half of the term until 1879. During this time a fine church building was erected an ornament to the town.\n\nThen Rev. J. N. Annis served for about a year. This church building went down a perfect wreck at the time of the first cyclone in 1880. The members having largely moved away to Dakota and elsewhere the organization was then dissolved, those of the members remaining seeking homes in other churches.\n\nThe Seventh Day Baptist Church of Dodge Center. â In the year 1856 three families of Seventh Day Baptists came to Dodge County and located in the southern part of the town of Wasioja. The next summer they were joined by a few others, and the following season by still others. After due notice, on the fourth day of June, 1859, under the leader ship of Eld. Phineas Crandall a meeting was held of all of this faith to organize a church.\n\nThe meeting was held at the house of B.F. Bond about one mile north east of where Dodge Center now is. The church was organized with eleven members, N.M. Burdick was chosen deacon, B.F. Bond, clerk. The membership was increased quite frequently by those joining who came from eastern homes to locate here, and also by baptism.\n\nEld. Phineas Crandall was for a time located with this little church as missionary pastor. Later he went from here to occupy another missionary field in Freeborn County, and the church was left without a pastor for some time, during which they were visited by Elders O. P. Hull, of Milton, Wisconsin, and A. B. Burdick, of Rhode Island, as missionaries. They were also occasionally supplied by Eld. Shepard, of Wasioja a First Day Baptist.\n\nIn September, 1861, the church invited S. R. Wheeler one of its members who was preparing for the ministry to improve his talent in preaching, which invitation he accepted. Later Brother Wheeler finished this preparation for his ch"
