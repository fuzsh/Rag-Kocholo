        "text": "MISSION\n\nWe design, build, deliver and maintain ships, submarines and systems reliably, on-time and on-cost for the United States Navy.\n\nEXPAND THE ADVANTAGE\n\nFor as long as we’ve been a Nation, our Navy has played a key role in protecting the world’s maritime system. Today, traditional and non-traditional forces threaten our safety both at home and abroad. Our technical and tactical advantage over our adversaries is being challenged as technology advances at a rapid pace. Every campaign requires a clearly stated and shared objective and vision. The overarching objective and vision of the NAVSEA Campaign is to expand the U.S. Navy’s maritime advantage over our adversaries through our people, products, and services.\n\nABOUT NAVSEA\n\nThe Naval Sea Systems Command is comprised of command staff, headquarters directorates, affiliated Program Executive Offices (PEOs) and numerous field activities. Together, we engineer, build, buy and maintain ships, submarines and combat systems that meet the Fleet's current and future operational requirements.\n\nNaval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is the largest of the Navy's six systems commands. With a fiscal year budget of approximately $36 billion, NAVSEA accounts for nearly one quarter of the Navy's entire budget.\n\nWith a force of 86,886 (as of 1 Oct 2023) civilian and military personnel, NAVSEA engineers, builds, buys and maintains the Navy's ships and submarines and their combat systems.\n\nTo accomplish this, NAVSEA manages 150 acquisition programs and manages foreign military sales cases that include billions of dollars in annual military sales to partner nations.\n\nThe origin of NAVSEA dates to 1794, when Commodore John Barry was charged to oversee the construction of a 44-gun frigate and ensure that all business \"harmonized and conformed\" to the public's interest.\n\nToday, the NAVSEA organization has 42 activities. NAVSEA strives to be an efficient provider of defense resources for the nation, and it plays an important role in the Navy Enterprise. As a Provider Command, it has the responsibility of directing resource sponsors into the proper mix of manpower and resources to properly equip the fleet.\n\nNAVSEA has the further responsibility of establishing and enforcing technical authority in combat system design and operation. These technical standards use the organization's technical expertise to ensure systems are engineered effectively, and that they operate safely and reliably.\n\nTHE FORCE BEHIND THE FLEET\n\nOur Nation’s greatest asset is its people and their ability to design and develop innovative solutions to meet any challenge. NAVSEA’s dedicated workforce is the key to our Navy being ready to fight and win. We are the Force Behind the Fleet!\n\nThe Force Behind the Fleet is comprised of two foundational Lines of Effort: the Design for Talented People and the Design for a High Velocity Learning Environment. Mission success and our full performance potential is dependent on these design efforts.\n\n▪ The Design for Talented People will promote an environment where employees are valued, empowered, and motivated, while being provided the opportunities to learn, grow, and develop both personally and professionally. In this environment, we both seek and value diversity in all its forms.\n\n▪ The Design for a High Velocity Learning Environment will provide communication and education on the principles and concepts of High Velocity Learning and will support knowledge sharing, innovation, and collaboration across the NAVSEA Enterprise."
