        "text": "Although media reports and rumors often give the impression that certain breeds of dog are more likely to bite, there is little scientific evidence to support those claims. It is more important to focus on things that we know increase the chance of a bite occurring.\n\nCarefully select your pet. Don’t get a puppy on impulse. Before and after selection, your veterinarian is your best source for information about behavior, health and suitability.\n\nSocialize your pet so he/she feels at ease around people and other animals. Gradually expose your puppy to a variety of situations under controlled circumstances; continue that exposure on a regular basis as your dog gets older. Don’t put your dog in a position where he/she feels threatened or teased.\n\nTake extra care with young children. If you have a dog and young children, always supervise their interaction with dogs, including your own dogs. Carefully manage the introduction of a child or a new dog to your household. Consider delaying acquiring a new dog until your children are over the age of four.\n\nTrain your dog. The basic commands “sit,” “stay,” “no,” and “come” can be incorporated into fun activities that build a bond of obedience and trust between pets and people. Avoid highly excitable games like wrestling or tug-of-war. Use a leash in public to ensure you are able to control your dog.\n\nKeep your dog healthy. Have your dog vaccinated against rabies and preventable infectious diseases. Parasite control and overall health care are important because how your dog feels directly affects how it behaves. Dogs in pain are more likely to bite, so have painful conditions such as arthritis, or injuries addressed by your veterinarian.\n\nBe a responsible pet owner. Obey leash laws. If you have a fenced yard, make sure the gates are secure. Walk and exercise your dog regularly to keep it healthy and provide mental stimulation. Studies of dog bite events suggest that it may be beneficial to spay or neuter your dog; discuss these procedures with your veterinarian.\n\nBe alert. Recognize when your dog is stressed, uncomfortable, or showing signs of aggression, and be prepared to prevent escalation of the situation. Remove your dog from situations that could increase the risk of biting. If your dog shows signs of fear or aggression that seem unprovoked or potentially dangerous, consult a veterinarian to determine the cause and seek treatment.\n\nPreventing dog bites to delivery personnel\n\nMake sure your dog is secured in a separate room, create, or fenced area.\n\nPlace visible signs on your door or your property to warn delivery personnel about the presence of a dog.\n\nIf possible, notify delivery services about your dog and any special instructions for delivering packages to your home.\n\nRegularly monitor your dog's behavior and consult with a veterinarian if you notice any signs of aggression.\n\nWe all know that dogs can’t talk to us, so they use their own vocalizations, body gestures and postures to express themselves. They rely on these types of communication to let people and other dogs know their emotions, especially if they feel stressed, frightened or threatened. They hope that the gestures will work to calm the situation and keep them out of trouble.\n\nWe can’t always read a dog’s body language accurately. Dogs, just like people, have their own, unique personalities, and they don’t all express themselves in the same way. One dog wagging its tail might mean that the animal is happy to see you or wants to play. The same gesture in another dog might mean that it’s anxious or nervous.\n\nSometimes, dogs will yawn, put their ears back or raise a paw if they are feeling worried. As the dog gets more concerned about the situation it’s in, its behavior will change. For example, if a dog tucks its tail under its belly or leg, lies down with a leg up or stiffens its body and stares at you, it could be trying to tell you that it’s frightened or threatened. When the dog reacts by growling, snapping or biting, it’s telling you that it wants to be left alone – Right now!\n\nRemember, we can’t predict whether a dog will bite or not based on its size and breed. Always focus on the behavior of the animal.\n\nAsk yourself a question next time you’re around a dog and want to play with it: Does the dog seem like it wants to be with you? If the dog is relaxed and friendly, and seems happy to see you, it’s probably in a good, playful mood and will welcome your attention. If the dog won’t look at you or is avoiding you by walking or turning away, it’s probably best to let it go on its way and leave it alone. If it seems tense and nervous, or seems to be staring at you, you’ll want to stay away.\n\nIf it’s not your dog, always rely on its owner to help you understand the pet’s mood. Always, always ask the owner’s permission before you attempt to pet a dog you don’t know."
