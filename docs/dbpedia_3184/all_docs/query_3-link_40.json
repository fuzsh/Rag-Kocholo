I hear this every time from strangers, friends and people around me. And as much as my job is fun and flexible,there are some challenges we face as a mobile massage therapist and today I'll be discussing some of them. 📌Logistics and Travel:Constant travel requires carrying all necessary equipment and navigating traffic and parking, making efficient scheduling crucial. 📌Safety and Security:Ensuring personal safety is vital. Client screening, using verified booking platforms, and having a check-in system with a trusted contact are essential measures. 📌Client Comfort and Environment: Adapting to different environments to provide a consistent, high-quality experience requires clear communication with clients about their space and needs. 📌Managing Work-Life Balance: The flexibility of mobile work can blur personal and professional boundaries. Setting limits and maintaining a healthy balance is important. 📌Physical Demands: Transporting and setting up equipment adds to the physical demands of massage therapy, requiring good self-care to prevent fatigue and injury. 📌Building a Client Base: Marketing and maintaining a steady client base can be challenging without a fixed location, necessitating continuous promotion and a strong local presence. 📌Professional Boundaries:Addressing inappropriate advances is crucial. Establishing clear boundaries, communicating policies, and maintaining professional conduct ensure a safe, respectful environment. Despite these challenges, being a mobile massage therapist is incredibly rewarding. The flexibility, strong client relationships, and providing comfort in clients' homes make it all worthwhile. I hope to connect with you all and answer questions you all have concerning the massage field #massagetherapy #reapers30daysconsistencychallenge #holisticandwellness #relaxation\n\n🏡✨ Transform Your Home, Transform Your Life! ✨🔨 At TADQ, we believe your home should be a haven of comfort, independence, and joy!

Sure, they get bookings but it’s been sporadic and not as consistent as they’d like. ✅ Lack of strategy for how to get consistent clients. They’re doing a lot of things and consuming a lot of information , but everything is piece of meal and there’s no solid, clear strategy of what they should do and when. ✅ They Don't have a unique selling proposition or technique so it’s difficult to stand out and clients don’t have a compelling reason to choose them over the competition. When that's the case it’s hard to make consistent income. The Sought After Massage Therapist 1:1 Program solves ALL of these problems. Instead of wondering where your next client is coming from,you can have the confidence that comes from being sought after and having client seeking your services and coming back again and again to you.

Welcome to Today's Workplace Safety Awareness on Noise Hazards. I'm your host, Safety Queen, I'm excited to share this important information with you 😊 Noise hazards are a common occupational hazard that can cause permanent hearing damage, tinnitus (ringing in ears), and other health problems. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can also lead to cardiovascular disease, anxiety, and depression. In this video, we will explore the risks of noise hazards, their effects on employees, and the importance of implementing effective noise reduction measures in the workplace. The Risks of Noise Hazards: - Permanent hearing damage - Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) - Cardiovascular disease - Anxiety and depression - Decreased productivity and focus - Increased risk of accidents and injuries *Common Sources of Noise Hazards:* - Machinery and equipment - Power tools and generators - Music and audio equipment - Sirens and alarms - Vehicle traffic and construction Effects of Noise Hazards on Employees: - Hearing loss and tinnitus - Decreased quality of life - Increased stress and anxiety - Decreased job satisfaction and productivity - Increased risk of accidents and injuries *Implementing Noise Reduction Measures:* - Conduct regular noise assessments - Implement engineering controls (e.g., soundproofing, noise-reducing equipment) - Provide personal protective equipment (PPE) such as earplugs and earmuffs Conclusion: Noise hazards are a significant threat to employee health and safety. By understanding the risks and implementing effective noise reduction measures, we can create a safer and healthier work environment. 👉Remember hearing loss is often permanent and irreversible, so it's crucial to take proactive steps to protect your hearing and the hearing of those around you👍 #safety #safetyfirst #safetyawareness #safetyqueenp #workplacesafety #noisehazard #constructionsafety #safetyprofessionals #safetyalways N.B : For all your safety gears, contact us Wattsapp: +234 7038686805 Email: akpuprecious@gmail.com We supply quality 👌\n\n🔊 Did you know industrial hygiene protects worker hearing? 🛡️ Industrial hygiene is crucial for identifying and controlling workplace hazards, especially when it comes to protecting worker hearing. Here's how it helps safeguard our precious sense of hearing! 🙌 1️⃣ Noise assessments: Industrial hygienists measure sound levels in different work areas to identify excessive noise. This helps implement control measures to reduce exposure and prevent hearing damage. 2️⃣ Engineering controls: Industrial hygienists work with engineers to design and implement controls that minimize noise levels. This includes sound barriers, mufflers, or enclosures to isolate noisy machinery and equipment. 3️⃣ Administrative controls: Industrial hygienists establish policies and procedures to limit workers' exposure to excessive noise. This includes scheduling breaks in quieter areas, rotating employees, and providing hearing protection devices. 4️⃣ Personal protective equipment (PPE): Industrial hygienists ensure appropriate hearing protection devices, like earplugs or earmuffs, are available and used correctly. They also conduct training sessions to educate employees on the importance of using PPE consistently. 5️⃣ Monitoring and compliance: Industrial hygienists regularly monitor noise levels to ensure compliance with safety regulations. Routine inspections and assessments help identify potential issues and take prompt action. Protecting worker hearing is essential for their well-being. Prioritizing industrial hygiene practices creates a safer and healthier work environment for everyone. Let's work together to ensure our workers can enjoy their jobs without compromising their hearing health! 🎧💪 #IndustrialHygiene #WorkerSafety #ProtectHearing #SafetyFirst\n\nThere are so many facets to Health and Safety I'm not surprised people get a bit lost with it all. Luckily, that's what I set Maltby Professional Services for - to help employers get it right. I team up with professionals in different fields to bring my clients' knowledge and information on various aspects of Health and Safety at work. One of the key areas I find people forget about when it comes to H&S is noise exposure. Adam Chell at Sevenoaks Hearing wrote this article for us to help our clients better understand the risk of noise exposure and determine whether the Noise at Work Regulations apply to them. As always, if you have any questions, please do get in touch. #noiserisk #noisepollution #healthandsafety #healthandsafetyatwork #hearing #decibels #noiselevels\n\n“Hearing Wizard gives us the opportunity to do this, by offering a great service and excellent customer service”. Delighted to receive feedback from another happy customer in food! We understand that clients running a multi-shift operation find it difficult to schedule occupational health tests without impacting on production… …which is why we designed Hearing Wizard to fit in with your business - whether your staff are working in an office, on the factory floor, on a production line, on a building site, on stage or behind a bar or working remotely or at home. Workers test themselves in any suitably quiet environment, improving access to hearing screening whilst also reducing disruption and opportunity costs associated with taking staff off task. And as your workers test themselves they can conduct their hearing test at 3am as easily as 3pm, if that fits best. We use a unique combination of cloud-based technology with a simple tablet handset interface, so that hearing testing is easy, standardised, high quality, fast and flexible to the needs of your organisation and workers. Meanwhile, in the case that staff are referred, our new referrals service makes complying with the guidelines (L108) simpler and – yes – saves time and money. If you would like to find out more about how we can help simplify occupational hearing testing for your business please get in touch!
