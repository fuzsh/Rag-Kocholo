Can we load programs to the external drive? IE: The new drive may be labeled \"F\". and the programs loaded to that drive would be configured to\" F:/Program Files/ etc ....\n\nThats the $200 question !!\n\nThanks for your kind assistance !!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nRon\n\ndbailey\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #3 · p.1 #3 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nRon,\n\nI have a removable internal drive bay. I have one hardrive dedicated inside the computer and the removable drive has all my photos and important stuff. You can run programs from the drive also.\n\nThe nice things about this setup are, you have a backup, can remove the drive anytime and put in a safe place, and it's much faster since it runs off the motherboard and not a seperate card. It's really like a nice partition on you're drive which you should have anyway. I would recommend partioning you're drive and keeping the important stuff seperate from the programs.\n\nThe removable drive bay takes standard internal IDE hard drives which can be swapped from the bay anytime. Or you can buy spare bays for the removable slot.\n\ncheers.\n\ntazo\n\nOffline\n\n    \n\n[X]\n\np.1 #4 · p.1 #4 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nI have two hard drives in my pc tower..\n\none 60 gb for all my photos/multimedia... and then a 40 gig for windows and programs...\n\nthat way if windows craps out which it invariably does at some point, my photos/music/movies etc are all safe.\n\nI would go with 2 internal drives.. one for ur photos and one for windows & programs.\n\ndaniel\n\ngervaise\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #5 · p.1 #5 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nRon, the value of an external drive is that it is not affected by crashes of the internal drives, even if you have two. I recently had a crash of my expensive 4 drive RAID 10 array and lost some pictures on it in files that got corrupted. Such a RAID set up is not supposed to be corruptable and should be repairable, it was not.\n\nFortunately I also backed them up on my external, slower large hard drive and thereby saved the ones I would have lost. (I also back them up a third place on DVD and CDs) Never trust a computer !!\n\nYou can also take your external drive off premises if you are away and concerned about fire or theft, something not easily done with an internal. They are a bit slower, but if you get a firewire version from Maxtor or Western Digital they are almost as fast as internal drives.\n\n-Gerry\n\nAJ Nadershahi\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #7 · p.1 #7 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nIs this on a Windows platform or Mac?\n\nWith a PC platform installing programs on your computer means random configuration and application files are dropped all over the machine, (Windows is one of the messiest and most mis-managed systems I've ever seen.)\n\nSo installing programs to an external drive that may be unplugged could cause problems on the computer. Use it only for storing files and images and for backup. Also, trying to start or run an application from an external drive will have very noticeable performance issues.\n\nhiepng\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #8 · p.1 #8 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nI always use external hard drive to backup data. I bought a usb/firewire enclosure and some internal hard drives, and put the internal hard drive in the enclosure. It is total the same as an external.\n\nThe good thing about the enclosure is that it will work with all hard drives, CD, DVD drives, and those internal drives must cheaper than the external ones. (it functions the same as removable internal drive bay, but is is external)\n\nDoug Quance\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #9 · p.1 #9 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nI would also recommend checking out the hot-swap drive bays.\n\nI just installed two serial ATA 10K drives in my system. One is for the system drive, and the other is for current editing material and Photoshop scratch disk.\n\nThat leaves my other drives for other needs... like one for a ghost of the system drive, and a raid array for temporary storage before burning to DVD, and another for export.\n\nThere are some new externals that have just come out that are supposed to be fast enough to perform real time video editing, so that might be an option as well.\n\nKyle Yates\n\nOffline\n\n    \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #10 · p.1 #10 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nWindows seems to have a problem if programs are installed to other than drive C. Even if the install program allows you to select another drive there are all sorts of \"System type\" files that have to go in the same directory as the OS system itself -- again on drive C for Windows.\n\nLinux or other decent OS'es don't seem to have this problem and you can copy your HOME directory to any disk you like.\n\nFor Windows use the external drive for DATA, backups, OS disk image files, photoshop work space and the like. It's quite good to have say an image file of your Windows partition (Drive C) saved on the external drive so if you hose up Windows --- Too easily done -- (I've lost count over the number of Windows re-installs I've done over the years) -- you can recover Windows again without a re-install. Drive Image, Ghost or Acronis True Image will recover an average Windows Image in around 10-15 minutes from a USB 2 disk.\n\nThese days you can get a decent 300 GB Maxtor USB2 / Firewire disk for around USD 280. This is around the capacity of 85 DVD's and MUCH MUCH faster.\n\nRonR\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #11 · p.1 #11 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nWow, I thought I had this all sorted out this morning. And I come back from a days work at the salt mine ---- and now there may be conflicts.\n\nYes, this is a windows machine we are talking about. Has anyone else tried installing programs on anything other than the \"C\" drive.\n\nThanks for your continuing support !!!!!!!!!!!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nRon\n\nlurple\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n[X]\n\np.1 #12 · p.1 #12 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nI never install my applications on my C: drive. They always go to my D: drive which is for applications only. E: and on are for various types of data.\n\nMy setup (hard drives) is:\n\nC: is a 36 GB 10K Raptor SATA with Windows and my primary Photoshop scratch disk.\n\nD: and E: are logical drives on a WD 180 GB 7200 RPM drive with D: being for applications and E: for data and a secondary Photoshop scratch area (that has never been hit as far as I can tell).\n\nF: and G: are logical drives on a Hitachi 160 GB 7200 RPM drive mostly for data, backup, and the Windows paging file. 2 External FireWire drives for archiving my important data (which also goes to DVD, I am a bit anal retentive about this ).\n\nAlong with the 2GB of RAM it seems to keep Photoshop (and therefore me) relatively happy.\n\nWaldenL\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #13 · p.1 #13 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\nRon,\n\nI've installed programs on probably every drive letter from C to Z -- and they work fine. However, kyle has a valid point, some (many?) programs install \"system\" type things that go into the system folder, there's no way around that. FWIW, your system drive doesn't _have_ to be C, I have one machine where windows itself runs from G:\\Windows, there is no C drive on that machine. However, convention is C.\n\nGiven your scenario, I'd reverse what you're thinking. Leave the C drive for programs and everyone else's stuff and use a second drive for your photos. I agree that you should go internal if you don't need the portability that an external gives you.\n\n-Walden\n\nWaldenL\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #14 · p.1 #14 · External Hardrive Question !!\n\ngervaise wrote:\n\nRon, the value of an external drive is that it is not affected by crashes of the internal drives, even if you have two.

The only way you can loose data on that due to a drive failure is if you loose TWO drives at the same time. Are you sure the array is configured correctly?\n\n-Walden"
