Take the Woodburn Exit and head east on Hwy. 214 0.6 mi. to Boones Ferry Rd., north on Boones Ferry about 1.2 miles, and west on Crosby Rd. 0.3 mi. Just before the Interstate overpass, turn north onto Edwin Road, which parallels the expressway for 0.6 mi. and dead-ends at a gate about 50 yards from the pond. Park at the locked gate and walk in.\n\nHave a little more than 60 minutes?\n\nIf so, you can visit the alpine lakes east of Portland: Timothy and Trillium lakes (off Hwy. 26, Mt. Hood), Lake Harriett (PGE park) and Timber Lake are worth the trip."
