        "text": "\"The first time I did it was because I thought it would be fun and I'd have a global audience,\" Gervais said Friday at the TV Critics press tour, two days before he takes up emcee duties for the third time in a row. \"The second time I did it was because I thought I could improve, which I think I did. Then I read in the press that I would never get invited back, so I did it a third time to annoy them.\"\n\nGervais said he doesn't worry about the backlash he might get. \"What's the worst that could happen?\" he said. \"I end my career once a week, if you read the press,\" he said. \"I don't care what people think.\"\n\nI talked to Gervais about how he's able to take on taboo subjects and get away with it. His extensive answers will be part of an article we'll have for you around Feb. 19, the debut date of his brilliant new HBO sitcom, \"Life's Too Short,\" starring dwarf actor Warwick Davis."
