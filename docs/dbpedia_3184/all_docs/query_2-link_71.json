        "text": "LVolz\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n: Off\n\np.1 #3 · p.1 #3 · Paper and ink epson pigment printers\n\nHendrik,\n\nI was just about to post a separate message about my experiences with the 2200, but part of what I wanted to report answers your question, so here it goes:\n\n1) The printer produces very sharp results. The 1440 resolution is excellent and you'd have to look very closely to see the quality differences in the 2880 mode.\n\n2) Do not believe Epson's claims of faster print times. An 8x10 @ 1440 takes about 4 minutes on my systems. An 8x10 @ 720 on their older printers (1270, 1280, etc.) takes about 4 minutes on my systems. The 720 resolution on the 2200 is a useless draft mode, so the result is that you can can print twice the resolution (1440) in the same time; you cannot print the same old resolution (720) in half the time (well, you can, but the results are ugly at best). Because we run a fast-turnaround, production-based operation, print times were important to us, and to that end these printers did not help as much as we were hoping.\n\n3) When we first got our printers, we were unable to get ink (especially light magenta) for almost 3 weeks. It now appears that Epson has fillied the pipeline and most inks are readilly available.\n\n4) The color is very brilliant EXCEPT . . .\n\nIf you use the default setting for the printer, it is very likely that you will see a magenta cast all across your prints. You will also notice that the printer consumes light magenta ink at an alarming rate (probably what caused the worldwide shortage of light magenta ink a few months ago). There has been much discussion on almost every digital photography forum on the internet, including this one, about how to deal with the magenta cast.\n\nMy crude but fairly effective solution is to set the Print Mode in the driver to CUSTOM, COLOR CONTROL, and dial back magenta 5-7 units. FWIW, I've contacted Epson about this issue several times and in their latest correspondence, they called my experiences with the printer \"both unfortunate and unusual.\" They're either lying or completely ignorant if they think we're buying that explanation.\n\nRegards,\n\nLeo\n\ngervaise\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #4 · p.1 #4 · Paper and ink epson pigment printers\n\nHendrik, I thoroughly disagree with Leo's comments as to speed and the magenta cast problems. The speed is a function of memory, the interface you use and your computer settings. I routinuely print 8 x 10s in under 3 minutes and just did a 10 x 16 2880dpi watercolor paper print in about 7.5 minutes. Both these would have taken twice that long on the 1280 I have and used for many months before the 2200.\n\nThe magenta cast problem has been endlessly discussed on dpreview and elsewhere and is a function of the color management settings. In most cases it is because of poor calibration, use of wrong profiles, and most often the fact that the profiles are doubled by being set twice once in the Epson software and the other in the PS setting. To solve them is beyond your questions.\n\nAs to papers, I have found that the luster produces the best photo type prints and the velvet fine art and radiant white watercolor using the matte black ink are absolutely stunning. The pastel - watercolor appearance of these prints almost brings tears to the eyes of people who see them. Whatever you do, don't try to use up your ColorLife paper with the 2200 as it is a disaster. I also find the photoblack ink and the premium semigloss works well. I would urge that until you get your profiles and color management working that you stick with the Epson papers listed on their and Atlex.com websites for this printer. Other papers work but you have to know what you are doing.\n\nLeo is correct that the printer does use a lot of light magenta ink and a lot of black, but that is a function of RGB style printing conversions to the necessary CMYK printing done by the printer. I don't claim to understand that problem, but have read a lot about why extra magenta is needed to make RGB files print properly.\n\nOverall you will love the results if you can master the color management issues inherent in a quality printer and working with PS6 and 7. I finally got seven books on PS and color management and now get pretty good prints the first time.\n\nChuck Coyne\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #5 · p.1 #5 · Paper and ink epson pigment printers\n\nHendrik,\n\nMy personal experience using the Epson 2200 (for 3 months now) is one of pure delight. However, my results right out of the box were mixed. It all comes down to the proper color management. Once I had my monitor calibrated and started using a custom profile for each type of paper, I had consistently excellent results with my prints. I purchased custom profiles from www.profilecity.com and my prints are very close to what is displayed on my monitor.\n\nMy favorite paper is the Epson Premium Luster which I purchase online at The Epson Store www.epson.com. As far as speed goes I diffenately see a slight improvement over my old Epson 1280 printing the same size prints using the same computer hardware. Best of luck with your new printer.\n\nLVolz\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n: Off\n\np.1 #7 · p.1 #7 · Paper and ink epson pigment printers\n\nGervaise,\n\nI don't think you disagree with me as much as you said you do. I did say that using the default settings would cause foul printing. You said color management was needed. That, to me, certainly transcends default settings. What I meant to convey was that, without some amount of effort in learning and applying color management, the results can be disappointing. This was just a different experience than I was used to having with Epson products.\n\nRegarding the print times, I would certainly like to know more about your computer setups. Here we have 1000 MHz P-III and 1.6 GHz P-IV processors. None of our computers have less than 512 MB of RAM. Right now, our 2200 and 7500 printers are connected via USB 2.0 ports. I'm willing to switch to FireWire to get more speed. How much additional processor speed/RAM are you suggesting? Are there any specific computer settings you recommend? As I mentioned in my note to Hendrik, we run a fast-turnaround operation. A gain of more than 1 minute per 8x10 print would be an appreciable savings for us. Thanks for any info you might have.\n\nRegards,\n\nLeo\n\ngervaise\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #9 · p.1 #9 · Paper and ink epson pigment printers\n\nLeo, glad I better understand your comments since I love this printer. I would strongly suggest you get an Adaptec Firewire PCI card and use the Epson 2200 firewire port. Firewire seems to be significantly faster on my Dell dual CPU 866mz machine with 1 gig of Rambus memory than the USB1 or USB2 that I tried. I also find that working thru a USB hub either does not work or slows things. The firewire adapter is only about $49 at Fry's or on line. I now have four firewire ports (two on each card) and they do not interfere with one another like USB interupts seem to.\n\nFor some reason the different papers and profiles seem to make some difference in speed. For example Luster prints faster than Enhanced Matte or Velvet Fine Art even at the same DPI and identical size. I think maybe it is that the Matte black takes longer for some reason.\n\nI usually print direct from PS7 and have allocated 720megs to it, so it seems to buffer and print faster than Qimage for example. Dont know if these ideas help, but I also find things run faster if I restart the machine, open PS7 and print, without other programs running. I suspect MS XP Professional like all MS software has memory leaks. Let me know if this helps.

It is my pleasure to\n\nrespond to your inquiry.\n\nPlease try the following the steps to improve your output from this\n\nprinter.\n\n1. In Photoshop 7 select File and Print with Preview.\n\n2. You should see a check mark beside Show More Options and Color\n\nManagement should be selected in the drop down menu.\n\n3. The Source Space selection we do not usually need to change.\n\n4. Bring up the Drop Down Menu for Print Space Profile and Select \" Epson\n\nStylus Photo 2100/2200 \" and the Intent should be \" Perceptual \"\n\n5. Then click on the Print One, or Print Button\n\n6. In the Print window select either Setup, or Printing Preferences (If you\n\nhad to select Setup, Select Printing Preferences after that).\n\n7. In the Main Tab Click on Custom and then click on the Advanced Tab\n\n8. In the Advances Settings Menu, Media Type should be Enhanced Matte Paper\n\n(Use this setting if you are printing on Matte, Luster, or Premium Glossy\n\npapers)\n\n9. Ink should be set to Color\n\n10. Set the Print Quality to what ever you require\n\n11. Color Management should be set to Color Controls, and the Gamma should\n\nbe 1.8\n\n12. Epson Natural Color should be unchecked\n\n13. Mode should be Automatic\n\nOnce you have these settings selected click OK, then OK again and Print. At\n\nthis point your image quality should be improved.\n\nLVolz\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n: Off\n\np.1 #13 · p.1 #13 · Paper and ink epson pigment printers\n\nHendrik,\n\nI have no idea if Epson's offerings in Europe differ from those in the US, but I do know the following for sure:\n\nEpson Premium Luster Photo Paper, Premium Semigloss Photo Paper, Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper, Glossy Paper Photo Weight are all available in the US and are all different according to the specifications listed on Epson's web site -- different basis weights, different thicknesses, different base materials, different opacities, different brightnesses, etc.\n\nWhile Premium Luster and Premium Semigloss are visually and texturally very similar, it is my understanding that P.Luster will work with pigmented or dye-based inks; P.Semigloss works only with dye inks, so would not be recommended for use in the 2200. A similar situation exists between Premium Glossy (pigment or dye) and Glossy Photo Weight (dye only).\n\nI hope this clears it up. Epson, through their naming scheme for their products, have certainly not made media selection an easy process. At our shop, we use Premium Luster exclusively. We are very happy with the output from the 2200's and get very few complaints from our customers.\n\nLeo\n\nLVolz\n\nOffline\n\n\n\n: Off\n\np.1 #16 · p.1 #16 · Paper and ink epson pigment printers\n\nI do have a FireWire adapter sitting here on my desk, and hadn't gotten around to installing it. Since I had USB 2.0 support built into this machine, and since USB 2.0 is theoretically faster than FireWire I figured that would be the way to go. I should have known better. And, yes, we also have similar problems with the USB-connected devices kicking each other off-line, not remembering their port numbers, etc. and Windows hemmorhaging system resources as programs have been opened and closed.\n\nI've pushed the PS7 available memory to the max (580MB on my personal machine), so we'll see how fast it gets when I get the FireWire hooked up later today. Thanks, again, for your help.\n\nLeo"
