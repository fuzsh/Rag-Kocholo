        "meta_description": "Anhedonia EP by Thor Rixon, released 22 March 2024\n\n1. Beautiful Day w/ Lazarusman\n2. Fill This Room With Fire\n3. Beautiful Day (DUB)\n\nanhedonia /ˌ anhɪˈdəʊnɪə/\r\nnoun: anhedonia\r\nThe inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable activities.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Day (w/ Lazarusman):\r\n“It’s peculiar when the day is extremely wonderful- the sun is out, the grass is green, the birds are singing and the whole\r\nscene is just perfect… but you aren’t. Our mental states &amp; anxieties have a way of crippling us no matter the weather,\r\nand this is to say, it’s okay to feel sad on a beautiful day because you may feel great on a horrible day. The thing we\r\nshould always be grateful for is that we are here to enjoy another day.\r\nOn the day of recording, I decided to walk a far distance in Berlin to reach Thor’s studio and during this walk, I mused\r\nabout what a gloomy day it was, but I didn’t feel gloomy at all I felt great but in tandem, I remembered days when the\r\nday was enjoyable, but I felt terrible. I imagined that people feel that way regularly and I guess this song is an ode to\r\nthose moments and those feelings.”\r\n-\r\nLazarusman\r\n\r\nFill This Room with Fire:\r\nFill This Room With Fire is the antithesis of ‘Beautiful Day’ in the sense that it captures the feeling of elation in a chaotic\r\nspace. The song started as a lazy afternoon sketch on an MPC during a warm summer in Cape Town, South Africa,\r\nwhich then was recorded and expanded on for months afterwards. The end result is a deep dance track that builds and\r\nfades and flows with many peaks and valleys, getting bigger with each cycle to a crescendo that feels large yet\r\nrestrained. The only lyrics of the song ‘Fill This Room With Fire’ were added towards the end of the production process\r\nwhen the composition reached a point where the elements of the track worked together to ignite a dance floor, or in\r\nother words, fill a room with fire.",
