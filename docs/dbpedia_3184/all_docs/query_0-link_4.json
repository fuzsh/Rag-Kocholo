        "text": "WingedPower\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #20 · p.1 #20 · HDD partition for swap files\n\nI was under the impression that JBOD is essentially Raid-0 (stripping across disks w/o redundancy or parity protection)? Basicaly, if you lose a disk, then you lose all the data in the JBOD setup.\n\nIf you were going to add a bunch of disks together, but want to retain the most storage, go with a RAID-5 setup. You sacrifice the capacity of one disk in the bunch, but your data can survive 1 disk failure.\n\nCommonly used RAID\n\nRAID-0 :\n\n- Concatenation of disk space, with or without striping across disks.\n\n- No safety. Losing one disk means losing the entire RAID-0 volume.\n\n- Use 100% of available disk space on all disks. (minus that used for filesystem/etc)\n\n- Generally, fast. But less reliable.\n\n- 1 or more disks. Limit based on your controller card or OS/software.\n\nRAID-1 :\n\n- Mirroring. 2 disks of the same size store the same data.\n\n- Very reliable. You can lose one disk in the pair and still have a copy of your data.\n\n- Writing is slowed, because of the double work. Reading is sped up, because of 2 sources for reading.\n\n- More reliable since you can withstand the loss of one disk.\n\n- Only half of the available disk space of the disks used.\n\n- 2+ disks, in pairs(simple configuration)\n\nRAID-10 or RAID-1+0 :\n\n- Several Mirrored disk pairs which are then striped. So basically, at least four disks are setup as 2 RAID-1 mirrored pairs for redundancy, then those RAID-1 volumes are concatenated together and striped.\n\n- You get the benefit of stripping, so your writing speed should be about the same as RAID-0, but you get the mirroring, so your reading speed is greater like RAID-1.\n\n- You can lose up to 1 disk per mirrored pair. If you lose 2 disks, from 2 different RAID-1 parings, then your data is still safe. If you lose 2 disks from the same pair, then you will lose all data in the RAID-0 striping.\n\n- You only get 1/2 of the storage available on the disks put into the system.\n\n- There is a different form which does mirroring on top of striped disks. Performance is about the same, but the recovery time is much longer.\n\nRAID-5 :\n\n- Contatenation with parity striping. You have at least 3 disks, more commonly 5 disks. One disk's worth of information is used for parity information(checksums, error-correcting info).\n\n- Because the error correction information is created every time you write to the disk, there is a performance penalty for write actions(speed only, if using hardware RAID-5. speed and CPU load if using software RAID-5)\n\n- You can suffer the loss of 1 disk in the RAID-5 volume. That disk needs to be rebuilt the first chance you get. Losing 2 disks in a volume will result in the loss of all data in that volume.\n\n- Your available storage is however much storage in all drives combined, minus the capacity of one drive. All drives need to be equal sizes.\n\nThere are variations to how people do the RAIDing. Some people layer on on kind of RAID ontop of another. Ie, RAID-5 on top of several RAID-1 volumes to allow for the survival of losing 2 disks.\n\nRAID-10 is popular since you get very good performance and get redundancy. But the cost goes into the number of disks you need to put into the equation. Since you sacrifice the same amount of storage as you would with a normal RAID-1 pairing, you get speed along with RAID-1 security.\n\nRAID-0 is popular for the raw performance. It' fast. Gamers and digital video editors use this on some setups. But it is risky and should never be used for archiving data.\n\nRAID-5 is commonly used for bulk storage where some protection is required, but performance isn't a priority.\n\nGiven the option and funds, a RAID-10 is the way to go. You get very good performance and data protection. The only issue is needing to buy more disks and controller cards.\n\nWing."
