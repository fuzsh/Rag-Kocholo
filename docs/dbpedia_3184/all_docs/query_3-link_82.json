        "text": "Jerry Seinfeld invented the comedy maxim: No learning, no hugging. But for the past ten years, Ricky Gervais has been the greatest disciple of that truth. He invented an awkward and frequently vicious comedy in The Office, and his side projects since then have consistently been hilarious and nasty. His new show, Derek, now on Netflix, is a radical departure — it's a show that actually attempts to ground itself in kindness. And it's the first unmitigated flop of Gervais's career. And I find that fact sad, because it would be great if nice comedy could be funny. Apparently, it can't.\n\nYou have to say this: Nobody but Gervais would have the guts to try and get laughs from a mentally handicapped worker at an old folks home. Sweet but simple, Derek has friends around the home, Kev and Dougie, with which there is a little occasionally hostile banter, but the core relationships are almost entirely gentle and supportive and caring. Derek is in love with the home's manager, Hannah, but he also loves all the old people in the home, and feels terrible tenderness toward them when one of them dies. He is always explaining to the camera what his favorite things are, which is the opposite of what you find in most comedy, where the characters almost exclusively point out what they hate.\n\nIt is unfortunately very dull indeed to watch all this niceness. You know that part toward the end of Modern Family episodes where they turn to the \"lesson\" of the show, after they've finished their jokes in the first 18 minutes? Derek is like the end bit of Modern Family but it lasts a full half-hour. I always turn that part off.\n\nSuch bland sentimentality is the opposite of what we've come to expect from Gervais. He's been great, so far, because he's been so unrepentantly mean. Gervais entered American consciousness by making fun of celebrity awards shows at the Golden Globes. Celebrities are an easy target of course. Angelina Jolie can go home to her private island to cry into a pillow stuffed with the feathers of Resplendent Quetzals. In England, Gervais found it trickier to defend his use of the word \"mong,\" basically the plummy equivalent of \"tard.\" He later apologized, but the scandal must have lingered long enough to produce Derek. It definitely feels like a show created for Gervais to prove he isn't an asshole.\n\nFor what it's worth, the show works on that level. I'm pretty sure Ricky Gervais isn't an asshole, at least not all the time. On the other hand, he's much funnier when he is. I can't stop laughing at this clip of him making fun of Karl Pilkington's family reminiscences. You won't find any moment even remotely that good in Derek. And yet I find it hard to criticize the show. Not only is Derek compassionate, it's also truly original. I've never seen anything like it. The fact that it's boring to me is disappointing more than anything — What's wrong with me, and everybody else, that I laugh at cruelty, and that I can't laugh at kindness and compassion? Is that my fault or Gervais's?\n\nPLUS: Read More Stephen Marche on The Culture Blog >>"
