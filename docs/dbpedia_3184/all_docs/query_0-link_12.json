        "text": "Last weekend I accomplished a goal Iâ€™ve been chasing for a while â€“ qualifying for the Boston Marathon. A top runner in the country in high school, I had big dreams when I joined the #2 ranked cross country program in the US (University of Arkansas). Sadly, the work ethic that helped me succeed in high school (running 70 miles each week), led to an early retirement at the end of my junior year (after 13 stress fractures and surgery on each leg for compartment syndrome). Unexpectedly, I had the opportunity to run for University of Missouri during graduate school but was quickly injured again. Any running dreams were on hold for many years. My love of running remained, but I ran a few times a week for enjoyment and stress relief as I built a career and a family. Finally, at age 44 and as a mom of three, I finished my first marathon (NYC!) in 2019. I under-fueled and was disappointed in my time, so ran the Seattle Marathon three weeks later (not recommended ðŸ˜‰). I was excited to qualify for Boston during that race. Unfortunately, too many people had faster qualifying times, so I didnâ€™t earn a spot. Then, COVID, which disrupted everything. And, also created the opportunity for me to help build a company, Truveta. Soâ€¦finally, last year, I was training again for the London Marathon and ended up running it with one healthy hamstring after an unfortunate hamstring tear. In the fall, I ran the Chicago Marathon and nearly qualified, despite having tendonitis in my hip. I share this history as context as to why this qualification â€“ at the unheralded Super Marathon near Seattle â€“ was so special. This time, I beat my qualifying time by over 7 minutes â€“ Iâ€™m hopeful it is enough to get me in the race when decisions are made in September. This is a lot of running talk â€“ but as always, I love to find the lessons learned. This time: âœ¨ There is a lot of joy to be found in the journey â€“ While London and Chicago didnâ€™t go as planned, I loved the experience of these major marathons. Similarly, I didnâ€™t expect my best race would find me on a mountain trail in the Pacific Northwest. Along the way, I enjoyed a lot of miles with immense gratitude for health. âœ¨ Just keep going â€“ The Super Marathon is kind of wild because you run through a pitch black tunnel from miles 5 â€“ 8 (with a flashlight). I face-planted near the end of the tunnel and landed hard on my left side. I thought about quitting â€“ and again at mile 20 when I was exhausted â€“ but I knew the finish would be so sweet if I could make it. âœ¨ Preparation and learning pays off â€“ Like most things in life, marathon running benefits from research. I under-estimated this in my first marathons. Knowing how to hydrate, manage electrolytes, properly fuel, and strength train to prevent injuries are just a few of the things I needed to prioritize, study, and learn. Finally, itâ€™s always the right time to chase a big dream thatâ€™s meaningful to you."
