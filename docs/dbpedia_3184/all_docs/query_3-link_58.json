        "text": "This flat, easy walking, paved trail follows the old towpath of the Columbia Canalâ€”which had a brief career in the 19th century, but became obsolete because of the railroads. From the parking area, follow the paved walkway past the Visitor's Center and cross the Columbia Canal on the footbridge. Turn right to enjoy a walk/ride atop the levee separating the canal from the Congaree and Broad Rivers. You will pass an amphitheater, a picnic shelter, and several overlooks with benches, which provide a place to stop a minute and enjoy the sounds of birds. During the springtime you may also see spider lilies on rocky shoals of the river. This Three Rivers Greenway trail ends at the canal diversion dam, which provides a miniature impersonation of Niagara Falls after heavy rains. On your return, you can vary your walk by descending a stairway and following the lower paved section along the river. Although there is stairway at each end of this section, there is ramp at the Broad River Overpass.\n\nThe trail will eventually connect to EdVenture. There is a boardwalk section already completed (known as Bicentennial Park) with stellar views of the Gervais Street Bridge and Congaree River. Columbia's Riverfront Park is a component of the Palmetto Trail.\n\nHours: Dawn to dusk\n\nDirections:\n\nFrom downtown Columbia: Drive west to Huger Street and turn toward Interstate 26. At Laurel Street turn left (west). Laurel dead-ends into the parking area for Riverfront Park."
