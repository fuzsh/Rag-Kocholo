        "text": "Essential Info\n\nIs this trip for you?\n\nThis trip is graded Activity Level 5 (Challenging). For more information on our trip gradings please visit the Activity Level Guidelines page. If you have any queries about the difficulty of the trip please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nSome of the days are indeed challenging with up to 5,250ft (1,600m) of ascent and, on other days, similar descents. On some days, when we cross glacial moraine, the terrain is rough and loose underfoot. There are also some steep sections with chains and ladders that are technically simple but not suitable for anyone who suffers from vertigo. The cumulated fatigue of hard trekking for two weeks should not be underestimated. As this is a group trip, you need to be confident your fitness will allow you to enjoyably walk at a consistent and steady pace that matches the group average, therefore allowing the group to finish the day at a reasonable time. You will also enjoy the trek a great deal more if your fitness allows you to walk the route in relative ease.\n\nThere is one qualified International Mountain Leader (IML) that accompanies the group throughout and it is their decision if you accompany the group on any particular day. For safety reasons, the group leader may also change their walking style from one where everyone walks at their own pace to one where the group walks together at the speed of the slowest, depending on the conditions, weather and visibility. This scenery on this trip is stunning and may well be the best walking you have ever done, but it is important to be prepared and have a high level of walking fitness and stamina.\n\nWhile camping, the support leader will put up your tent; in the morning, you will be expected to pack away your own tent (these are modern pop-up tents that are very easy and quick to fold away and pack) and the whole group generally helps to load the support vehicle on the days when we move camp. After breakfast and on the nights when we eat in camp, expect to help with the washing up.\n\nIf you are unable to walk during the itinerary and want to opt out of a day, please note: this can sometimes be a little tricky. To reach the next point, you need to take a public bus or train (which run at limited times) or taxi (which can be expensive in more remote locations). Our support vehicle is not suitable for taking passengers, so please be aware of this when deciding to book this trip. If you miss a part of the itinerary, any extra transport, hotel and food cost will be at your expense.\n\nAll ascents, descents and distances listed have been measured by our local partner using satellite-based mapping software. Please note, GPS measuring devices can give differing results, especially in mountainous terrain and on winding paths. Measurements stated throughout these Trip Notes are given to help you understand the types of terrain and distances you will encounter. Timings stated include lunch and photo stops and will vary depending on the pace of your group.\n\nPlease note: It is essential you have helicopter evacuation cover for this trip.\n\nFollowing a review of all our trips we have categorised this trip as generally not suitable for persons of reduced mobility. However if you are a regular traveller on such trips, please contact customer services to discuss the trip and your personal condition.\n\nJoining Instructions\n\nKey information\n\nStart campsite: Camping Les Marmottes, 140 Chem. des Doux, 74400 Chamonix-Mont-Blanc\n\nPhone: +336 13 41 12 50\n\nRecommended arrival time: You can arrive at any time today. There will be a welcome briefing in the afternoon, but if you miss it the leader will update you separately\n\nAirport: Geneva (GVA)\n\nGetting to the start campsite\n\nThe start campsite is approximately a 1hr 15min drive from the airport. Your options for this journey are:\n\nTake an Exodus transfer\n\nExodus provides one group arrival transfer from the airport, which is timed to coincide with the arrival of a chosen flight from London, UK. You may join this transfer at no extra cost, provided you can be at the airport before the transfer leaves. Speak to your sales representative for the group arrival transfer times or to arrange a private transfer.\n\nMake your own way\n\nYou can reach the start campsite relatively easily by public transport. You can book a bus transfer with a local company at least a week before your departure date. A shared transfer will cost approximately €50 one way if booked in advance with our partner Mountain Drop-offs. Book on their website (www.mountaindropoffs.com) and quote the promotional code EXOCHX for an approximate €5 discount. Discounted rates apply to transfers between 17 June and 17 September.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to take a train from Geneva to Chamonix via Saint-Gervais-les-Bains; you can then take the TER train to Gare de Les Bossons and the campsite is a short walk away. Tickets to Chamonix and onwards to Gare de Les Bossons must be purchased locally at Geneva railway station. Train seats to Geneva can only be booked three months before your departure date. Our sales representative will be happy to book a seat for you in cooperation with Rail Europe.\n\nIf you would like further information on joining this trip, please speak to your sales representative.\n\nCatching your return flight\n\nAirport transfers on departure day are not included, but we will help you to book the best-value option (most probably the train) when you are on trip. You will need to pay for this departure transfer locally in cash. We can’t guarantee what the price will be, as it varies based on the time of year and availability, but it should be in the region of 55-80 Swiss francs (€57-€83) per person. Alternatively, you can book the train yourself at www.sbb.ch/en/home.html. The departure railway station is Täsch and we use the 6.25am train. A minibus transfer will be organised to take the group to the railway station in time for the train’s departure.\n\nFull joining instructions including local emergency numbers will be sent to you as part of our Final Joining Instructions. If you do not receive these at least a week before departure, or require them earlier please contact our office or your travel agent.\n\nLocation start: Les Bossons\n\nLocation end: Randa\n\nVaccinations and Health\n\nFrance\n\nThere are no required vaccinations. However, you may want to consider vaccinations for tetanus, rabies and tick-borne encephalitis. Please confirm with your doctor or travel clinic.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nThere are no required vaccinations. However, you may want to consider vaccinations for tetanus, rabies and tick-borne encephalitis. Please confirm with your doctor or travel clinic.\n\nVisa\n\nFrance\n\nTravellers from the UK, US and EU normally do not need a visa to enter France. Please note, visa requirements often change and it is your responsibility to obtain any required visas for this trip. Therefore, we recommend that you check with the nearest embassy or consulate of your chosen destination(s), including any countries you may be transiting or transferring through.\n\nSome local governments provide guidance on what visas their citizens need. To help, we’ve gathered a selection of useful links below.\n\n• Australia: www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/france\n\n• Canada: www.travel.gc.ca/destinations/france\n\n• United Kingdom: www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/france/entry-requirements\n\n• USA: www.travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/France.html\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTravellers from the UK, US and EU normally do not need a visa to enter Switzerland.

The restaurant and hut/inn meals, which are prepared for us, are usually arranged as a ‘menu’ for the whole group and, as they are based on special negotiations made by us, represent better value than eating independently. On free days 9 and 14, dinner is not included and needs to be bought locally. Please note, should flight times change to arrive earlier, or depart later, additional meals will not be included. Please also note that no refund will be given for meals not taken or taken other than where designated.\n\nTypical meals\n\nBreakfast: Usually consists of coffee, tea, cereal, yoghurt, fresh fruit, bread and conserves.\n\nLunch: Picnic-style lunches will normally include bread, cold meat, cheese, sometimes boiled eggs or tinned fish, fresh salad and fresh fruit. You may wish to bring (or purchase locally) snack bars for an extra energy boost during the day.\n\nEvening meal: Whether in camp or in a nearby restaurant, we endeavour to make dinner something to look forward to. Each day there will be a freshly prepared menu for the whole group consisting of:\n\nA soup, salad or similar\n\nA main course of meat, fish or vegetarian option served with a selection of vegetables and carbohydrates\n\nA dessert\n\nBeer, wine, bottled water, coffee, tea or other drinks are not included in the price of evening meals taken in restaurants. Coffee and tea are included with the evening meal when we eat in camp, and beer and wine are also available for purchase at a modest cost.\n\nVegetarians: We happily cater for vegetarians – please inform us at the time of booking.\n\nVegans: If you adhere to a vegan diet, you may find the variety of food offered to be limited, since veganism is relatively uncommon in this region.\n\nThe feedback we receive for the food we serve is great but please be aware that facilities and practicality forces us, and the restaurants we use, to put our efforts into making one excellent group meal with a vegetarian option. Of course, any allergies will be respected.\n\nWeather\n\nExpect fair weather from late June to early October, but all mountain ranges create their own weather patterns and the Alps are no exception. It can and does rain and it can be surprisingly cold at times, especially on the high passes.\n\nExpected daytime temperatures are:\n\n15C-25C (59F-77F) in the valleys, although it can sometimes reach 30C (86F) in July/August\n\n5C-15C (41F-59F) on the passes, though it will feel colder if wet and windy\n\n5C-15C (41F-59F) in the valley at night, possibly a little lower early and late in the season.\n\nThere is always the possibility of lying snow, especially in the early season, and snowfall even in August and September when we may find new snow on the passes. Please be aware that on late-season treks (September) the days are shorter and we need to make early starts to make the most of the available daylight.\n\nCamping, mountain huts and village inn\n\nThe accommodation on this walking trip in the Alps includes 11 nights of camping, two nights in mountain huts and one night in a village inn.\n\nCamp nights\n\nStunning mountain settings, communal living and a chance to switch off. For many, our camp nights are a highlight of the trip − sharing an after-trek drink with newly made friends as the sun sets over a glaciated mountain is the perfect way to enjoy the great outdoors, after all.\n\nMost of the campsites we use are modern with hot showers and electricity. Many have a bar and wifi, plus a lounge or sitting area. We provide a large communal tent (if we do not use the campsite communal area), where we eat at tables with benches and have an unlimited tea and coffee station, plus a camp bar.\n\nAccompanying you throughout the trek is a dedicated camp support leader who takes care of the logistics and catering. Your tent is put up for you each night; in the morning, you should take it down, put your bag in the back of the van and wash your own breakfast dish. On four nights out of 14, you will also be asked to join a washing team and help with the dishes that night. A 20-minute job. Otherwise, you are free to relax and take in the beauty of the Alps.\n\nCamping equipment\n\nAll our equipment is bought with comfort and practicality in mind, and we hope it represents a higher quality than most individuals would buy for themselves.\n\nTents: Spend 11 nights camping in roomy three-person tents, but with a maximum of two people per tent. We use waterproof dome tents incorporating an 82in x 82in (210cm x 210cm) inner tent with a sewn-in ground sheet and a supplementary 90in x 27in (230cm x 70cm) covered porch that is an ideal place to leave your walking boots and poles etc. Packing them away should take no more than five minutes. Single tents are available for a small additional cost as are camping mats and sleeping bags with liner and pillow.\n\nCamp mats: Our air-and-foam camping mats are full-length, comfortable to sleep on and provide excellent insulation from the ground.\n\nSleeping bags: These have a synthetic filling, as opposed to feathers, with a three-quarter-length zip and are rated for good warmth.\n\nWorth knowing\n\nTwo remote campsites are a little more basic than average and do not have showers.\n\nThermal mattress hire: £36 – please request in advance with your sales representative.\n\nSleeping bag hire, pillow and liner: £73 – please request in advance with your sales representative."
