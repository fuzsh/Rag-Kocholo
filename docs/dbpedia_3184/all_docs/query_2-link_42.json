        "text": "Each month, your Neighboring Food Co-ops feature our region’s artisan cheesemakers by offering a specially selected cheese at a great price. Look for the “Cave to Co-op” sign in the cheese section at your local food co-op. To find one near you, visit www.nfca.coop/members.\n\nThis Month’s Selection:\n\nBOSTON POST GOAT CHEDDAR, BOSTON POST DAIRY, ENOSBURG FALLS, VT\n\nBoston Post Dairy is located on the Gervais Family Farm, a family run farm in northern Vermont owned and operated by Robert and Giselle Gervaise and 12 of their 15 children. The Gervaise family has been farming the property since 1962 when they began with 35 Jersey cows and 220 acres of land. Today they milk over 1,800 cows and grow 3,100 acres of corn and hay.\n\nIn 2013 their farm was given the prestigious Vermont Dairy Farm of the Year award that yearly honors an outstanding, efficiently managed dairy enterprise that sets a strong example for other farmers to follow. Farms are evaluated on a number of criteria including production records; herd, pasture, and crop management; environmental practices; contributions to agriculture and the local community and overall excellence in dairying.\n\nBoston Post Dairy is operated by their four daughters and named after the old road that runs through the property. The Dairy is home to 70 dairy goats and 80 dairy cows. They make cheeses from goat milk, cow milk, and a blend of goat and cow milk.\n\nBoston Post Goat Cheddar is made with their Vermont farmstead goat milk and handcrafted in small batches. It has a smooth creamy texture and a sweet nutty flavor with a tangy finish.\n\nCheck out these recipes using this lovely goat cheddar.\n\nWinter Salad\n\nserves 4-6, pre-heat oven to 400°F\n\nIngredients\n\n1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into ½ inch pieces\n\n2 cloves of garlic, minced\n\n3 Tbs extra-virgin olive oil\n\nsalt and pepper\n\n2 Tbs balsamic vinegar\n\n1 tsp maple syrup\n\n2 tsp Dijon mustard\n\n8 cups baby spinach, chopped\n\n1 medium firm apple\n\n6 oz.
