        "text": "2023-24 Gervais School Board Focus:\n\nThe board identified the following standards as focus areas for the coming year:\n\nStandard 2 Community Engagement\n\nThe Board recognizes that all members of the community are stakeholders in the success of their schools.\n\nThe Board engages the community using a reciprocal advocacy process that creates and sustains\n\nmeaningful conversations, system connections, and feedback loops across the breadth of their\n\ncommunity. The Board supports collaborative partnerships and new types and levels of community\n\nparticipation in schools.\n\nStandard 10 Innovation and Creativity\n\nThe Board encourages innovation and creativity as assets to the process of development and change, leading to new types of thinking and better ways of meeting student needs. The Board supports innovation and creativity that support district vision, values, and goals throughout the organization; engages collaborative partnerships; and encourages dialogue, new ideas, and differing perspectives.\n\n2023-24 Gervais School Board Goals:\n\nGoal 1: The board will focus on actions and services which increase opportunities for community engagement and communications between the school board and residents of the Gervais School District community.\n\nStrategies:\n\nThe board will work with a consultant and the Willamette ESD to identify and select options for additional communication to residents. The board will assess the effectiveness of each option implemented and adjust as necessary.\n\nThe board will identify and participate in opportunities for community engagement that provides platforms for board members to discuss issues facing the district and receive feedback which will be brought back to the board and shared during the “Board Focus” segment of regular school board meetings.\n\nThe district is in year 3 of the strategic plan which has included the same four goals with performance indicators and measures changing each year to reflect “next steps” necessary to work towards achievement of the goals. The school board has used the strategic plan to guide its work during the last three years.\n\nGoal 2: The board will use the four goals found in the strategic plan to center all policy decisions and budgeting priorities for the purpose of supporting the accomplishment of these goals.\n\nStrategies:"
