        "text": "Babyface is seeking joint custody of his daughter.\n\nThe 62-year-old star — whose real name is Kenneth Edmonds — and Nicole Pantenburg announced earlier this month they had split after seven years of marriage and now the “Every Time I Close My Eyes” singer has filed a response to his estranged wife’s divorce petition.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by The Blast, Babyface is seeking joint custody of 12-year-old Peyton and is willing to pay both spousal and child support to his wife.\n\nHowever, he also requested the court recognized the couple’s prenuptial agreement when making financial awards as the document already states how much Nicole should receive in the event of a split.\n\nThe document added: “Separate property assets and debts per Prenuptial Agreement.”\n\nIn the filing, the producer lists the former couple’s date of separation as October 15th, 2020.\n\nThe pair announced earlier this month they had decided to go for their separate ways but would continue to put their children first.\n\nBabyface and the former “Moesha” actress — who got together in 2007 and married seven years later — issued a joint statement which read: “After much thought and with great sadness, we have decided to end our marriage. We continue to care and have respect for one another and share eternal love for our daughter and her well-being. We ask for personal privacy for ourselves and our daughter as we navigate these new steps as a family.”\n\nBabyface was previously married to Tracey Edmonds, the mother of his sons Brandon and Dylan, from 1992 to 2005.\n\nThe “Never Keeping Secrets” hitmaker has spoken of how much he cherishes his children in the past."
