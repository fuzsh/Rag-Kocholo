        "text": "Kenneth Brian Edmonds found a way around his shyness growing up by writing his emotions into songs. He was also practicing on guitar and keyboard at the time and, a few decades later, he was world famous as Babyface (his professional nickname).\n\nBeyond being a well-decorated crooner with 11 Grammy Awards, Babyface is also the writer and producer of over 26 R&B hits. producers of all time.\n\nBabyface Bio (Age)\n\nThe American singer was born on April 10, 1959, in Indianapolis, Indiana, and named Kenneth Brian Edmonds by his African-American parents – Marvin (father) and Barbara Edmonds (mother), a pharmaceutical plant production operator.\n\nEdmunds’ family struggled when their father passed away after a battle with lung cancer. He was then in eighth grade at North Central High School in Indianapolis and was already writing songs to help him overcome his shyness. Seeing his mother’s difficulties in caring for the family, Edmonds began to aspire to a career in music.\n\nHe worked with Bootsy Collins in his early days as a singer and also got his nickname “Babyface” from the American musician. His youthful appearance earned him the name. Babyface also worked with the band known as Manchild, performing as a guitarist and also playing keyboards in the light-funk and R&B band known as Deele. The latter group introduced him to his future partner – drummer Antonio “LA” Reid. They remained in the Deele group until their departure in 1988. The duo embarked on writing and producing together and recorded numerous successes.\n\nHis hit Slow Jam which he wrote for the R&B group Midnight Star received rave reviews in 1983. This song was part of the No Parking on the Dance Floor album which received double platinum. . Slow Jam also received a lot of radio airplay, and more than three decades after its release, it can still be heard on the radio.\n\nSo far in her productive career, Babyface has eight studio albums and six collaborative albums with bands and solo artists. The latest of its collaborative offerings, launched on February 4, 2014, has become a cherished reward. The dubbed album Amour, Mariage et Divorce was made with Toni Braxton.\n\nIn 2009, Soda Pop Records was launched by the star under which he signed R&B superstars K-Ci & JoJo. Along with singing, writing and producing music, Babyface also started performing. He made a guest appearance and also guest-starred on an episode of Beverly Hills, 90210. He also collaborated with his ex-wife Tracey Edmonds in the creation of the Edmonds Entertainment group, through which they produced films like Soul Food (1997) and Josie and the Pussycats (2001) to critical acclaim. Other productions were also made under the stable.\n\nNet value\n\nFor an artist of his caliber, it’s hardly a surprise that people are extremely interested in knowing the exact extent of the wealth he has made from his career as a musician and other pursuits in the entertainment industry.\n\nUnfortunately, the quest to find out how rich Babyface is has led to various figures being quoted which can hardly be proven as his net worth. Although several sources have put the total value of the man’s wealth at $80 million, a handful of others believe it is much larger than that and has risen to $170 million.\n\nHis family – wife and children\n\nThe legendary crooner has been married three times. His first attempt at marriage was to a woman simply identified as Denise. The details of this marriage – when it started and ended – have not been made public, probably because it happened when he was still very young.\n\nTracey Edmonds came into her life in 1990 during auditions for one of her music videos. Their relationship turned into a marriage which was officially sealed on September 5, 1992. Unfortunately, the union will not be happy as Tracey filed for divorce in 2005 due to irreconcilable differences. It was after thirteen years of living together as man and wife.\n\nBabyface soon found love again in 2007 in the arm of his backup dancer Nicole “Nikki” Pantenburg. They made their union official on May 17, 2014 at a wedding ceremony and have been together ever since.\n\nFrom his last two marriages, Babyface is a father of three, one daughter and two sons. His sons Brandon and Dylan are from his marriage to Tracy. In 2008, while still a couple, Babyface and Nicole welcomed a daughter, Payton.\n\nBabyface Brothers\n\nBabyface has two brothers, Kevon and Melvin Edmunds, also in the spotlight.\n\nAs Babyface progressed through the music industry on his own, his brothers teamed up with Keith Mitchell to launch After 7, an R&B group founded in 1987.\n\nThe talented trio are remembered for hits from the late 1980s and 1990s, like Ready or Not, and Nights Like That. They delivered well until Melvin bowed his bow in the early 2000s, handing his place in the band to his son, Jason Edmonds."
