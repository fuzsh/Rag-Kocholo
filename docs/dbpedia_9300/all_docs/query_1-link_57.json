It’s like nothing else matters.\"\n\nThe students and staff choir performed for Edmonds, who is in Indianapolis for NBA All-Star Weekend. He will perform \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the All-Star game on Feb. 18.\n\nKenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds: NBA All-Star performer Babyface has his own stretch of highway."
