        "text": "Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds is performing at the 2023 Super Bowl!\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning legendary R&B singer-songwriter and producer is singing “America the Beautiful” at the big game, where the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs will be going head-to-head on Sunday (February 12), starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nFans may be wondering about Babyface‘s relationship status, and whether he’s married and has children.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\nBabyface has been married twice: he first wed Tracey Edmonds in 1992, and they had two children together, Brandon Edmonds and Dylan Michael Edmonds. They were married for 13 years, before splitting up after Tracey filed for divorce due to irreconcilable differences in October of 2005.\n\nIn 2014, Babyface married his second wife Nicole Pantenburg. They had one child together, Peyton Nicole Edmonds, in 2008. After seven years of marriage, the two split in 2021.\n\nBabyface, 64, is now dating Rika Tischendorf, a 33-year-old German model-turned GM of Babyface Entertainment, who he recently referred to as his partner when asked about the title of his new album Girls Night Out at the 2023 Grammys.\n\n“Actually to be honest, it wasn’t my idea. It was my partner Rika‘s, who produced the whole album. She came up with the whole concept. We started messing with it… work[ed] with younger artists, and it ended up working out cool,” he said."
