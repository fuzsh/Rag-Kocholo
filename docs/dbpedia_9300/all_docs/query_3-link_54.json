        "text": "As Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds rode through campus Thursday, he was reminded of the times he came to Indiana University as a young man. As a high school student in the mid-1970s he performed at college parties. The Indianapolis native recalled being awestruck by the campus and imagined how fun it would have been to be an IU student.\n\nEdmonds went on to have an incredibly successful career in the music industry, winning 11 Grammy Awards, co-founding LaFace Records and working with everyone from Whitney Houston to Madonna. But he never went to college.\n\n“So to be here today to get an honorary doctorate,” he said from the stage of the IU Auditorium, “you know it’s humbling, it’s an amazing feeling, and I just can’t help but think of my mom and how proud she would be.”\n\nHonorary degrees recognize people of great integrity who have made profound and enduring contributions to their field, said Lauren Robel, provost of IU’s Bloomington campus. Edmonds’ accomplishments, summarized during introductory remarks by Robel and IU President Michael McRobbie, certainly fit that description.\n\nEdmonds was named producer of the year at the Grammy Awards three years in a row beginning in 1995. He has produced and co-written songs for such artists as Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Pink, Beyonce and Aretha Franklin. Hits include Eric Clapton’s “Change the World,” Boyz II Men’s “I’ll Make Love to you” and Madonna’s “Take a Bow.” He produced the score for biopic “The Bobby Brown Story” on BET and has more than 200 top 10 R&B, as well as more than 50 top 10 pop hits on his resume.\n\nThe path to that epic career began when Edmonds was in sixth grade. He found himself overcome with emotion at a Jackson Five concert.\n\n“I knew that I wanted to have something to do with that,” he said.\n\nEdmonds showed his determination two years later when the Jackson Five returned to Indianapolis.\n\nHe read in a newspaper that a man named Charles Williams was promoting the concert. Edmonds then called every Charles Williams in the Indianapolis phone book until he found the right one. Pretending to be his English teacher, Edmonds convinced Williams it would be a wonderful idea to allow an eighth-grade reporter to interview the Jackson Five.\n\nMeeting the Jackson Five was part of a long list of memorable experiences songwriter, musician and music producer Daryl Simmons credited Edmonds with facilitating. Simmons said he was able to travel the world, visit the White House, dine with a president and work with a queen because of his friendship with Edmonds.\n\nThrough his relationship with Edmonds, Simmons got to visit Eddie Murphy’s house, see Prince’s Purple Rain motorcycle and meet Oprah Winfrey.\n\n“Oh, and I held her Prada shoes while she and Kenny danced,” he said.\n\nThrough all that, Edmonds has been the same, selfless person he was when Simmons met him as a kid in Indianapolis.\n\n“Thank you for letting me stand on your shoulders for 47 years,” Simmons said. “Congratulations, doctor Edmonds.”"
