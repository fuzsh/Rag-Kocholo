I don’t think you could hurt me Once I leather up my skin If anything I might be stronger of mind Stronger of mind Last night I peeled back my skin while shaving my legs Pressed my lips to the bloody red muscle and sucked out the dregs I wanted to taste what you do that keeps you on me Maybe suck out the poison, feel some kind of free Instead I just learned that I taste like shit I don’t know anyone else who would stay here But how could I mind such a sweet waste of my time? I don’t think you could hurt me Once I leather up my skin If anything I might stronger of mind I don’t know anyone else who could love me So how could I hate such a sweet waste of my mind? I don’t think you could hurt me Once I give you everything If anything I could be stronger of mind Stronger of mind Stronger of mind\n\n2.\n\nHiccup 01:45\n\nGave you the time that you wanted To sit alone in your room and whine about me Still in all that time you somehow thought The whole world’s not about me Guess I'm not the only sun in your solar system System, system, system, system, system, system Fine alright I’m sorry I kissed him Who are you anyway? I don’t need you anyway I don’t wanna be your friend Pseudo-fucking-ephedrine Don’t cry puppy start barking Roll onto your back and wait for the scratch You don’t seem so angry When you’re kicking your feet and sitting in my lap Call me baby Don’t tell me to grow up I’ve been crazy lately Don’t fucking tell me to grow up Don’t say you’re sorry Just go fuck yourself Go fuck yourself Go fuck yourself Are your eyes swollen also Can they see fine? Can they blink fine? Or are they itchy hot and red? Oh it’s not a big deal Don’t even worry it’s not you it’s me I’d sooner fuck you than be dead Just call me baby One day I’ll grow up I’m acting fucking crazy Maybe I’ll never grow up Don’t say you’re sorry Just go fuck yourself Go fuck yourself Go fuck yourself Go fuck yourself and die\n\n3.\n\nGetting Sick 02:06\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nTown Clown 03:39\n\n6.\n\nEnema 01:24\n\n7.\n\nawesome party, reprise! 04:12\n\n8.\n\nSeafood 02:32\n\n9.\n\nwire mother 01:57\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\nTeeth 03:46\n\nYou took me to the place you skinned your knees When you were nine years old Told me how your mother never grew up But boy she sure grew old And she did it fast They say cheap houses aren’t built to last And I'll say okay It’s easier that way Even though Ms. Robinson did pray It seems her time was wasted Tell me again about God up in his good heaven Sweetest wine I've tasted And when the fire comes I’ll be the first to burn When the water comes I’ll be the first to drown I am my father’s only daughter I am all I have to offer I am my father’s only daughter You are swimming in clear water When you felt the sting of the blade Did you taste my teeth? When you fell from the edge Were you thinking of me? When you scratched the infested pit in your stomach Did you know it was me? It was me who dug it When you stay up at night Are you scared of my ghost? When you love her Did you know you love me the most? When you pull at the bloody red ropes of your guts Do you think of me sweetly, the cut of my touch?"
