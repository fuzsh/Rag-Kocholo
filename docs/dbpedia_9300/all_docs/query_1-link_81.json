        "text": "We Help You Hire, Book and Produce a Babyface Performance\n\nCelebrity Direct Inc. will help you select, book and hire Babyface to perform at your corporate event, non-profit event or private performance.\n\nWe are always uniquely positioned as your advocate throughout the hiring process and we won’t let you overpay.\n\nContact us for availability, price and other production details at:\n\n212-521-4115 Tell Us About Your Event\n\n__________\n\nBabyface Songs\n\n“When Can I See You”\n\n“How Come How Long”\n\n“Never Keeping Secrets”\n\n“What If”\n\n“Soon As I Get Home”\n\n__________\n\nBabyface Bio\n\nThe 11-time Grammy Award winner channels the magic of his storied career with Return of the Tender Lover (Def Jam, December 4, 2015). Featuring nine new original songs, Babyface’s first solo album in seven years is a nod to his RIAA triple-platinum album Tender Lover. That 1989 definitive breakthrough spun off four R&B/pop crossover hits, including the R&B No. 1’s “It’s No Crime” and “Tender Lover” plus “Whip Appeal” and “My Kinda Girl.”\n\nAs do the rest of the songs comprising Return of the Tender Lover. The soulful yet sophisticated mid-tempo “Exceptional,” the bright and breezy “Walking on Air” featuring El DeBarge and the sumptuous ballad “Our Love” quintessentially capture the newer grooves percolating throughout the album. On the upbeat declaration of love, “I Want You,” Babyface reunites with After 7, the R&B group comprised of his brothers Melvin and Kevon Edmonds.\n\nMusic has always come first for Babyface. It’s the backbone of an award-winning, multi-faceted pop/urban career that includes the consecutive multi-platinum landmark albums Tender Lover, For the Cool in You (including such signature hits as “Never Keeping Secrets” and “When Can I See You”) and The Day (“Every Time I Close My Eyes”). As co-founder with L.A. Reid of LaFace Records in 1989, Babyface nurtured the careers of such megastars as TLC, OutKast, Usher and Toni Braxton.\n\nParalleling those achievements is Babyface’s extensive songwriting and production credits from the ‘90s forward. He has produced and written/co-written hits for everyone from Whitney Houston, Eric Clapton and Michael Jackson to Boyz II Men, Mariah Carey, P!nk and Beyoncé, among countless others. That hit list boasts such smashes as Madonna’s “Take a Bow,” Clapton’s “Change the World,” and Boyz II Men’s “I’ll Make Love to You.” His most recent productions include collaborations with Bruno Mars, Kat Graham, Johnny Mathis, Music for the new Adam Sandler film & BET’s “New Edition Story”, Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Ledisi, Colbie Caillat, Jennifer Hudson, Ariana Grande, After 7, and Toni Braxton.\n\nThe prolific music man counts more than 200 top 10 R&B and over 50 top 10 pop hits (including 16 No. 1’s). In turn, those stats have generated cumulative single and album sales of more than 500 million units worldwide. And that’s not counting the numerous awards that Babyface has received. A triumphant first tour of South Africa with Braxton this year yielded a double-platinum award for the duo’s Love, Marriage & Divorce (featuring the urban AC No. 1 “Hurt You”). This brought Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds his 11th Grammy a win for best R&B album. That latest accolade joins a host of other honors, including the Soul Train Music Awards, BMI Awards, NAACP Image Awards, American Music Awards, BET Walk of Fame Award, and receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013.\n\n__________\n\nContact Babyface Manager or Agent | You May Ask?\n\nHow can I hire Babyface for a corporate event, non-profit or charity event or private performance?
