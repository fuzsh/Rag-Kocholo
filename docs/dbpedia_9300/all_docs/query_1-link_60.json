        "text": "Babyface rose to the top of the music world in the late 1980s and 1990s as a solo act as well as one of the leading songwriters and producers of that era. Born Kenneth Edmonds, he received the nickname \"Babyface\" from legendary performer Bootsy Collins when he played in Collins' band, according to AllMusic. He went on to score such hits on Billboard's Hot 100 as \"When I Can See You,\" \"Every Time I Close My Eyes,\" and \"Whip Appeal.\" Babyface also helped other musical artists achieve greatness in the 1990s, producing Whitney Houston's smash single \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" and Boyz II Men's \"End of the Road\" (via E Online).\n\nEven though it's been a while since his days of making number one hits, Babyface remains a vital force on the music scene to this day. He released the album \"Love, Marriage & Divorce\" in 2014, which won him the Grammy Award for best R&B album. For this acclaimed collaborative album, Babyface reunited with singer Toni Braxton.\n\nIn 2015, Babyface put out his own album, \"Return of the Tender Lover,\" which received warm reviews and featured appearances by such R&B acts as El DeBarge and After 7, per Rolling Stone magazine. He continues to work steadily behind the scenes as a producer. He helped out on Ariana Grande's debut album, \"Truly Yours\" (2013), as well as her holiday EP \"Christmas Kisses.\" More recently, he served as an executive producer on Tori Kelly's 2020 Christmas album. As a songwriter, Babyface again worked with Toni Braxton on the 2020 song \"Do It.\"\n\nBabyface took a break from the music world to take a turn on the dance floor as a contestant on \"Dancing with the Stars\" in 2016, per IMDb. He continues to tour extensively as well. Outside of performing, Babyface supports numerous charities, including the Children's Diabetes Foundation, Stand Up for Cancer, and Keep Memory Alive, according to his official site.\n\nIn his personal life, Babyface has experienced some challenges. He and his second wife, Nicole Pantenburg, announced plans to divorce in July 2021, according to E Online. The couple has one child together, daughter Peyton. Babyface also has two sons, Brandon and Dylan, from his marriage to Tracey Edmonds."
