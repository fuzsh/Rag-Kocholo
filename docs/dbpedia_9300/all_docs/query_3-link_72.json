        "text": "For a singer-songwriter whose youthful good looks earned him his nickname (courtesy of legendary bassist Bootsy Collins), Kenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds spent a lot of time behind the producer's curtain making other artists famous. He doesn't need to work anymore, meaning his new Vegas gig is a labor of love rather than commerce. The question remains, how does Edmonds represent a sprawling career when so much of his artistry has benefitted others? The answer from the fans who will consider catching Edmonds live in Las Vegas nothing short of a religious experience is \"Who cares?\"\n\nHe has enough hits (\"Whip Appeal,\" \"Tender Lover\" and \"Every Time I Close My Eyes\") to dedicate a set to his own output, but this is also the writer of seminal quiet storm track \"Slow Jam\" by Midnight Star and The Whispers' \"Rock Steady.\" Aside from launching the careers of Pebbles, Toni Braxton and TLC, Edmonds and LaFace Records partner L.A. Reid created classics for innumerable artists.\n\nExpect Edmonds to strap on a guitar and deliver renditions of compositions meant for Bobby Brown (\"Don't Be Cruel\"), Boys II Men (\"End of the Road\") and Johnny Gill (\"My, My, My\"), among others, during a night of inspired Babyface music and R&B history.\n\nThe Mirage, 7:30 p.m. Jan. 17-19, starting at $29.99 plus tax and fees, 16+. 702.792.7777"
