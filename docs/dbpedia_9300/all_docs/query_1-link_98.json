        "text": "Singer, songwriter, producer, musical powerhouse—the multi-talented, GRAMMY® winning Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds created the soundtrack of the ‘90s and 2000s. All of your favorite songs of the era were touched by Babyface in some way, as he nurtured the careers of artists including TLC, OutKast, Usher and Toni Braxton, and produced and wrote hits for Whitney Houston (“Exhale (Shoop Shoop)”), Madonna (“Take a Bow”), Boyz II Men (“I’ll Make Love to You”) and Mariah Carey (“We Belong Together”). After last year’s record-setting Instagram Verzuz battle with Teddy Riley, Babyface is bringing his iconic sound to a new generation—and to NJPAC."
