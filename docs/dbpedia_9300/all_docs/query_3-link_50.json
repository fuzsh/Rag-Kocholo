        "text": "Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds has written the soundtrack of our lives.\n\nAs the founder of LaFace Records — a label that has launched the careers of Usher, TLC, and Toni Braxton — Edmonds knew how to spot quality talent, nurture it, and help it grow.\n\nAnd as a singer-songwriter of his own, Babyface has written some of the most romantic songs of the 20th and 21st centuries. From “When Can I See You Again” to “Nobody Knows It But Me,” to “Every Time I Close My Eyes,” he’s known how to hit people right in the feels with each recorded note.\n\nNaturally, with this level of talent, it’s no wonder that he’s earned a most impressive $200 million net worth, per Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nBut the benefactors of his impressive net worth are his three children — two sons and a daughter — who are following in their father’s footsteps with careers in the entertainment industry of their own.\n\nLet’s take a look at how Babyface’s talents have passed on to the next generation.\n\nEditorial note: The net worth listed in this piece is a speculative estimate drawn from a variety of online sources.\n\nDylan Edmonds\n\nLittle is known about Dylan Edmonds’ life, as he tends to keep his private life private. However, he did appear in a few episodes with his mother, Tracey, and her new husband, Deion Sanders, on their reality show, “Deion’s Family Playbook.”\n\nAdditionally, according to his LinkedIn page, he worked as a production assistant on “Games People Play” and for his father’s Edmonds Productions. He also served as a co-producer for the Netflix film, “End of the Road.”\n\nHe is set to graduate Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, NY, in 2023.\n\nBrandon Edmonds\n\nLike his father, Brandon Edmonds is getting into the production game. However, he’s serving as a producer on films and television shows. According to his IMDb page, Brandon Edmonds was the co-producer of “Games People Play,” and he’s also serving as the co-producer for the upcoming production, “End of the Road.”\n\nHis LinkedIn page confirms that he works with his brother, Brandon, on these productions.\n\nPeyton Edmonds\n\nPeyton Edmonds is the youngest child of Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, and she’s starting to make her way in the entertainment industry, like her father."
