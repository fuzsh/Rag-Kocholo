        "text": "BABY Face Nelson took his place as one of the most ruthless gangster's of the 20th Century when his life was ended in a shower of bullets at only 25.\n\nThe stone-cold killer and heist extraordinaire in only a few short years became the FBI's \"Public Enemy No. 1\" as they tracked his robbing, thieving and killing all over America.\n\nWho was Baby Face Nelson?\n\nBaby Face Nelson, whose real name was Lester J. Gillis was born on December 6, 1908 in Chicago.\n\nHe went down in history as one of the greatest bank robberies and most ruthless killers, particularly of FBI agents, in history.\n\nAccording to the FBI: \"Despite his boyish looks (thus the nickname), Nelson was a callous killer with a violent temper.\"\n\nWhat crimes did he commit?\n\nHis life of crime started early and forcefully. Nelson joined a youth gang at 13 and played about stealing tires and cars before moving onto to bootlegging and armed robbery.\n\nHe was in and out of boy's homes for his teenage crimes and in 1920, he raided the home of a wealthy magazine owner and walked away with jewellery worth $3million today.\n\nA few other run-ins with the law and he wound up behind bars a couple times before escaping in 1932.\n\nIncreasingly hardened, the criminal headed out on the road and teamed up with other notorious outlaws and gangsters, including John Paul Chase, Homer Van Meter and John Dillinger.\n\nAlthough, according to the FBI: \"Baby Face Nelson, was far too ruthless and reckless for even those hardened gangsters.\"\n\nIn 1934 with his team of outlaws, they embarked on a rampage of lethal robberies up and down the US.\n\nHis exploits earnt him the name Baby Face for his boyish looks and short height, but he was said to be the most murderous of them all.\n\n\"Where outlaws such as Pretty Boy Floyd and the Barkers would kill to protect themselves when cornered, Nelson went out of his way to murder â€” he loved it,\" writes historian Jay Robert Nash in his book Bloodletters and Badmen.\n\nIn April, 1934 the FBI eventually tracked the outlaws down in Wisconsin and in a bloody, but failed attempt to capture them, two were killed and the whole gang escaped.\n\nAmerica was gripped and hefty awards were put out for their whereabouts.\n\nThe robberies continued and more law enforcement officers were killed before Dillinger was shot and killed in July, 1934.\n\nDillinger's death came only two months after the gunning down of fellow notorious criminals Bonnie and Clyde, but the FBI was still focused on Baby Face.\n\nThe day after Dillinger's death and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover declared Nelson to be \"Public Enemy No. 1.\"\n\nWhen did Baby Face Nelson die?\n\nOn November 27, 1934 two FBI agents spotted Nelson and Chase in a stolen car in Illinois.\n\nAn armed car chase down a highway ensued and a wild shoot-out left both agents dead and Nelson fighting for his life.\n\nHe died later that day from his injuries."
