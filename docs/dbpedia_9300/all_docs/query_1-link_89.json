        "text": "Description\n\nThis catalog features royalties generated by legendary singer and producer Babyface along with other R&B artists. In the last 12 months, this collection has earned $12,977 of income.\n\nFour songs from Babyface's 2015 album Return of the Tender Lover anchor this catalog — accounting for 81% of historic earnings. Return of the Tender Lover is Babyface's tenth studio album, paying homage to his classic 1989 album, Tender Lover. The album was also Babyface's first solo album of new studio material in 10 years. Return of the Tender Lover peaked at No. 39 on the Billboard 200 and No. 5 Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\n“We've Got Love” was the lead single from the album and is the catalog's biggest earner with 47% of royalties. Along with “We've Got Love” is the title “Exceptional,” which brings in 33% of revenue. Rounding out the Babyface tracks included in the auction are “Something Bout You\" and \"Our Love.\"\n\nThis collection also contains the songs “Brokenhearted” from pop duo Kalin and Miles, “L.A.N.C.E” featuring June's Diary and “Perfect” performed by Christian hip-hop artist Tedashii.\n\nKey Drivers\n\n1.) Likely the most interesting aspect of this catalog is Babyface himself. Known for his skills not only as a singer, he's also a multifaceted musician, songwriter and record producer. He has written and produced more than 20 No. 1 R&B hits throughout his career and amassed 11 Grammy Awards.\n\n2.) Since the majority of earnings come from Babyface's recent album, Return of the Tender Lover, it's no surprise that radio is the largest source of revenue. Radio earnings account for 70% of this catalog's earnings to-date. Although the radio income is beginning to level off, these royalties are still coming in.\n\nSongs that experience significant radio play often build a foundation of streaming and other types of income as the radio royalties begin to slow down. Streaming accounts for 13% of the catalog's royalties thus far. Streaming royalties are on the rise worldwide.

Babyface has a tour on the books beginning in January through early March 2018. Since Return of the Tender Lover is Babyface's latest release, a tour can help draw interest to the album from new listeners and reengage existing fans. Finally, Babyface is said to be currently working on a new solo album, which can also bring interest and awareness to an artist's back catalog.\n\nWhat is being sold?\n\n100% of the seller's interest in the songwriter's & publisher's share of public performance royalties attributable to the seller's catalog of musical work. See the “Financials” tab for a full track list.\n\nHow does this asset make money?\n\nEvery time “We've Got Love” or any song in this catalog, is played on the radio, Sirius XM, Spotify, or any other type of public performance, you earn royalties.
