        "text": "22/5/2024 - 18h - WED - Traces of Memory - Krakow Philharmonic Concert Hall\n\nWilliams – Goldenthal – Penderecki – Komasa – Kroke\n\n30 years of Schindler’s List and 70 years of Elliot Goldenthal\n\nThe Traces of Memory concert programme stems from the cultures of Poland and the United States, including the Jewish tradition that links both countries. It was inspired by two anniversaries: The 30th anniversary of the Polish release of Schindler’s List, with unforgettable score by John Williams, and the 70th birthday of Academy Award-winning composer Elliot Goldenthal. The concert will also feature works by Krzysztof Penderecki, Antoni Komasa-Łazarkiewicz and the legendary band Kroke. The concert is organised in cooperation with the Krakow Philharmonic and the United States Consulate in Krakow, which has been a part of the city for 50 years.\n\nThe first part of the concert will focus on the 30th anniversary of the release of Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List. The story of an entrepreneur who saved more than a thousand Jews from the threat of the Third Reich, continues to move the audiences to the core and still asks the same universal questions. We cannot overlook John Williams‘ score, which plays a major role in this piece. The composer explored the heritage of Ashkenazi Jews, viewing it through the lens of his unique sensibility.\n\nIn addition to a suite from Schindler’s List, this part will also feature a performance by Kroke, which is also celebrating its 30th birthday. Back in the 1990s, Kroke members were seen as true pioneers, discovering Krakow’s forgotten klezmer traditions. Their talent caught the attention of Steven Spielberg himself, who invited them to a ceremony held for those, who survived thanks to Oskar Schindler’s list. This was a watershed moment in the history of the band, which has since continued to explore the immense variety of sounds and surprise the audiences with improvisations.\n\nWar in Europe is not a thing of the past – that is why the programme also prominently features a suite by Antoni Komasa-Łazarkiewicz written for In the Rearview. A Polish-French-Ukrainian documentary directed by Maciej Hamela tells the story of the first days of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the fate of millions of refugees. The composer was inspired by the poetry of Lina Kostenko, which he discovered while working on a score for the 2022 Composers4Ukraine event.\n\nThe second part of the concert will be devoted to celebrating Elliot Goldenthal‘s 70th birthday. The Jewish-American composer is renowned as one of the most prominent musicians in the world – his accolades include an Oscar, a Golden Globe and a World Soundtrack Award, among many other awards. The composer will take part in the performance of his Symphony No. 3, illustrating Barbara Sadowska’s poems – her notes and scribbles from the days of martial law in Poland, when the communist regime tried to put a stop to the democratic processes. Goldenthal, who was one of the guests of the FMF back in the day, became friends with Krzysztof Penderecki. To highlight the creative dialogue between the prominent composers, our programme features Ciaccona in memoria del Giovanni Paolo II.\n\nThe solemn concert, performed by the excellent Krakow Philharmonic Orchestra led by Alexander Humala, will highlight the American-Polish friendship and the message of the value of peace and joint security efforts.\n\nProgramme:\n\nPart I\n\nThe Best of Kroke\n\nAntoni Komasa-Łazarkiewcz – Skrzydła from In the Rearview\n\nJohn Williams – Three Pieces from „Schindler’s List”\n\nI.

The International Gala will serve a unique opportunity to discover works by outstanding composers of the middle generation. Daniel Pemberton, Martin Phipps, Rob Simonsen, and Anthony Willis are already enjoying well-deserved respect in the industry. It is time for their scores to delight the FMF audiences, thanks to excellent performances by Sinfonietta Cracovia.\n\nOne of the highlights of the upcoming FMF will be an international gala showcasing some of the most outstanding personalities of the film music world: Daniel Pemberton and Martin Phipps from the United Kingdom, Rob Simonsen from the United States, and Anthony Willis from Australia. Each of them is an established composer with an impressive portfolio and an ability to create unique musical worlds.\n\nThe listeners will have the opportunity to dive into the monumental flute part from Darren Aronofsky’s The Whale, the haunting themes from Saltburn and Promising Young Woman, the royal sounds heard on the score to the award-winning Napoleon, and a poignant song from Trial of the Chicago 7. The dynamic score to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse filled to the brim with electronic effects is sure to provide all listeners with some thrills. Celebrating Elliot Goldenthal’s 70th birthday, we will also recall the Grand Gothic Suite, whose premiere at the FMF in 2014 won the hearts of fans. The quality of the performance will be ensured by Sinfonietta Cracovia and its musicians led by Dirk Brossé – a conductor who already made a name for himself among the attendees of the previous FMF editions.\n\nProgramme:\n\nDaniel Pemberton – Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, The Trial of the Chicago 7, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword\n\nRob Simonsen – The Whale, Fast Colour, The Age of Adaline\n\nAnthony Willis – Saltburn, Promising Young Woman, M3GAN, How To Train Your Dragon: Homecoming\n\nMartin Phipps – Napoleon, The Crown\n\nElliot Goldenthal – Grand Gothic Suite\n\nPerformers:\n\nSinfonietta Cracovia\n\nDirk Brossé – conductor\n\nSpecial guests:\n\nDaniel Pemberton\n\nMartin Phipps\n\nRob Simonsen\n\nAnthony Willis\n\nElliot Goldenthal\n\nJulie Taymor\n\nThe public task is financed from the budget of the City of Kraków.\n\nTickets (100-160 PLN / 23-37 €):\n\nhttps://kbfbilety.krakow.pl/wydarzenia/international-gala-individuals\n\nhttps://fmf.fm/programme/international-gala-individuals-1\n\n25/5/2024 - 19h - SAT - Polish Gala - Modern roots - ICE Krakow\n\nLucewicz – Napiórkowski – Reikowski – Rogiewicz – Rostkowski – Syrewicz\n\n1670, Peasants, Bejbis, Blacktail, 30 Door Key, Forgotten Love – every single one of these movies owes its unique character to its score. This evening, we will be joined by some of the most talented composers to dive into the sources of our traditions, while taking advantage of the opportunities opened up by new media. This is going to be a great celebration of Polish music!\n\nWhat are Polish firm, TV series and video game scores like these days? The most interesting among them serve as a testament to the virtuosity and imagination of our composers. The FMF has been supporting and promoting the Polish film music industry for more than seventeen years. As we proudly watch it grow, we give the floor to the people, whose careers are picking up speed just now.\n\nOne of the most important trends of this day and age is the search for inspiration in Slavic folk music. That’s why the concert programme features a suite by Łukasz “L.U.C.” Rostkowski from The Peasants, which saw tremendous box office success, as well as the mesmerizing score from Blacktail, which brought Arkadiusz Reikowski a Digital Dragons Award (Best Polish Game Audio). It will also include Paweł Lucewicz‘s poetic soundtrack for Netflix’s take on Forgotten Love. All of these scores combine the sound of strong white voices and traditional instruments with the power of a symphony orchestra.\n\nThe evening will culminate with the 2023 Polish Soundtrack of the Year Award ceremony – as always, the concert will be opened by last year’s winner – Marek Napiórkowski. Together with outstanding jazz artists, he will showcase pieces from Bejbis. In addition, we will hear a composition by the winner of the FMF Young Talent Award competition.\n\nThe concert will also feature a tribute to the doyen of Polish composers – Stanisław Syrewicz, whose career started with writing the music for the first Polish-British TV co-production Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson in 1980. He composed scores for more than a hundred films, including works by such prominent directors as John Frankenheimer, Ken Russell, Jerzy Skolimowski and Andrzej Żuławski. His score for Stalin brought him the prestigious ACE Award, while the soundtrack to The Choir TV series remained the top classical music record in the UK and Australia for weeks, resulting in the Gold Record Award. The Polish Music Gala will feature songs from 30 Door Key and The Clandestine Marriage.\n\nThe evening will see many outstanding musicians performing on one stage. The pieces from Forgotten Love will be performed by the SVAHY trio, accompanied on bass flute by Katarzyna Gacek-Dudek. The Polish-Ukrainian Zazula ensemble will join forces with Bart Pałyga to present songs from Blacktail, and the impressive score from The Peasants will be presented by Łukasz “L.U.C.” Rostkowski and the Rebel Babel Film Orchestra. The musicians will be accompanied by the outstanding Krakow Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Katarzyna Tomala-Jedynak.\n\nProgramme:\n\nPart I\n\nMarek Napiórkowski – Bejbis\n\nStanisław Syrewicz – 30 Door Key, Clandestine Marriage\n\nPolish Soundtrack of the Year Awards Ceremony\n\nJerzy Rogiewicz – 1670\n\nPart II\n\nArkadiusz Reikowski – Blacktail\n\nPaweł Lucewicz – Forgotten Love\n\nYoung Talent Award ceremony, performance of the winning score\n\nŁukasz „L.U.C.” Rostkowski – Peasants\n\nPerformers:\n\nBejbis\n\nDorota Miśkiewicz – vocals\n\nMarek Napiórkowski – guitar\n\nHenryk Miśkiewicz – saxophone\n\nMichał Tokaj – piano\n\nRobert Kubiszyn – double bass\n\nPaweł Dobrowolski – drums\n\nForgotten Love\n\nSVAHY\n\nKatarzyna Gacek-Dudek – ethnic bass flute\n\nBlacktail\n\nZazula\n\nBart Pałyga – vocals, ethnic instruments\n\nClandestine Marriage\n\nAgnieszka Przekupień – vocal\n\nPeasants\n\nŁukasz “L.U.C.” Rostkowski\n\nRebel Babel Film Orchestra\n\nKrakow Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nKatarzyna Tomala-Jedynak – Conductor\n\nThe public task is financed from the budget of the City of Kraków.\n\nTickets (100-140 PLN / 23-33 €):\n\nhttps://kbfbilety.krakow.pl/wydarzenia/polish-gala-modern-roots-1670-bejbis-blacktail-chlopi-ferdydurke-znachor\n\nhttps://fmf.fm/programme/polish-gala-modern-roots-1\n\n26/5/2024 - 12h & 15h - SUN - John Williams for Three - Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha – Schindler’s List – Star Wars\n\nFlute, piano and cello – the chamber ensemble will shine a new light on John Williams’ repertoire, showcasing pieces from The Witches of Eastwick, Dracula, Star Wars, Hook, Schindler’s List and Memoirs of a Geisha, as well as many others.\n\nJohn Williams is not only one of several of the most famous and respected film music composers worldwide, but also a cornerstone of American culture – as a composer, conductor and pianist.

Join us for the European premiere of the Disney. The Lion King – Live in Concert event!\n\nBeautiful animations, universal message and brilliant songs by Hans Zimmer, Elton John and Tim Rice are just some of the pieces that make up the whole brilliant picture and combined made The Lion King a worldwide phenomenon and a timeless classic. This 1994 Disney production remains one of the biggest successes in the studio’s history spanning over a hundred years. The story of Simba, who needs to grow up with the help of his newfound friends, and take back what once belonged to him, continues to enjoy great popularity around the world.
