        "text": "Although urea can be an effective adjuvant to foliar sprays, we examined effects of additional surfactants on urea penetration through leaf cuticles along with the effect of urea with and without surfactants on net gas exchange of leaves of 'Marsh' grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) trees budded to Carrizo citrange (C. sinensis L. Osbeck x Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.) rootstock. Various combinations of urea, a nonionic surfactant (X-77), and an organosilicone surfactant (L-77), were applied to grapefruit leaves and also to isolated adaxial cuticles. When compared to X-77, L-77 exhibited superior surfactant features with smaller contact angles of droplets deposited on a teflon slide. Both L-77 and X-77 initially increased penetration rate of urea through cuticles, but the effect of X-77 was sustained for a longer period of time. The total amount of urea which penetrated within a 4-day period, however, was similar after addition of either surfactant. Solutions of either urea, urea + L-77, urea + X-77, or L-77 alone decreased net assimilation of CO 2 (A CO2) for 4 to 24 hours after spraying onto grapefruit leaves. A solution of X-77 alone had no effect on A CO2 over the 4-day period. Although reductions in A CO2 were similar following sprays of urea formulated with two different surfactants, the underlying mechanisms may not have been the same. For the urea + X-77 treatment, X-77 increased the inhibitory effects of urea on A CO2 indirectly by increasing penetration of urea into leaves. For the urea + L-77 formulation, effects of L-77 on A CO2 were 2-fold, direct by inhibiting A CO2 and indirect by increasing urea penetration. One hour after application, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of leaf surfaces treated with X-77 revealed that they were heavily coated with the residue of the surfactant, whereas leaves treated with L-77 looked similar to nontreated leaves with no apparent residues on their surfaces. The amount of X-77 residue on the leaves was lower 24 hours after application than after 1 hour as observed by SEM. organosilicone surfactants has been attributed to their ability to increase the spread of droplets by lowering surface tension (Schönherr and Bukovac, 1972). Nonionic surfactants can increase cuticular penetration of an active ingredient (AI) through complex interac-tions between the AI, surfactants, and leaf surfaces (Sharma et al., 1996; Stock and Holloway, 1993). Some adjuvants can enhance uptake of certain substances but retard the uptake of others (Swietlik and Faust, 1984). There is also evidence of species-specific effects of adjuvants on uptake of some AI that must depend on specific cuticular characteristics (Field et al., 1992; Gaskin and Stevens, 1993). Although the organosilicone surfactant, L-77, facilitated foliar uptake of Fe into chlorotic grape-fruit leaves, this surfactant induced disruption of cells in beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) root tissue (Neumann and Prinz, 1974). In addition, L-77 can induce negative effects on citrus fruit color development (Greenberg et al., 1987). Thus, there is the question whether surfactants alone can have physiological effects on plant tissues. This study was undertaken to determine effects of two types of surfactants, X-77 and L-77, on penetration of urea into grapefruit leaves. We also evaluated net CO 2 assimilation (A CO2) following foliar sprays of urea with and without these surfactants as an indicator of short-term physiological responses of leaves to these spray treatments.\n\nTo gain insight into salinity tolerance of citrus, we studied growth, leaf, and root Cl- concentrations and physiological responses of 5-month-old seedlings of the citrus rootstock Carrizo citrange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. · Poncirus trifoliate L.) grown in a greenhouse in three different substrates: Candler sand soil, Floridana sandy clay soil, or a commercial soilless peat/perlite/vermiculite potting media. Plants were kept well- watered with a complete nutrient solution plus either no salt (control) or 50 mM NaCl for 9 weeks. Without salinity, substrate type did not affect total plant growth although there were differences in shoot/root dry weight ratio and mineral nutrient relationships attributable to substrate. Predawn leaf water potential, midday CO2 assimilation, and leaf water use efficiency were highest in seedlings grown in the soilless peat. The salt treatment decreased leaf and root growth, reduced leaf Ca2+, and increased leaf K+ concentration in all the three substrates. Overall, plant growth was negatively related to leaf Cl-. Leaf growth reductions were least in Candler-grown seedlings and greatest in FloridanasoilasCl-concentrationswere lowestinCandlersandandhighestinFloridana soil. Leaf Na+ was also highest in Floridana seedlings. In contrast to salt ions in leaves, roots of salinized seedlings in Candler sand had the highest Na+ and Cl- concentration. Salinity reduced net gas exchange of leaves similarly in all three substrates. Salinity reduced both leaf water potential and osmotic potential such that leaf turgor was increased. Thus, salinity-induced reductions in growth and net gas exchange were not the result of loss of turgor but more likely resulting from toxic ion accumulation in leaves. Based on the relative rankings of leaf growth and leaf Cl- concentrations, Carrizo seedlings from Candler sand had the highest salt tolerance and those grown in Floridana soil had the lowest salt tolerance. Substrate type should be considered when character- izing plant growth and physiological responses to salinity.\n\n(15)Nitrogen uptake, allocation, and leaching losses from soil were quantified during spring, for 4-year-old bearing 'Redblush' grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi Macf,) trees on root stocks that impart contrasting growth rates. Nine trees on either the fast-growing 'Volkamer' lemon (VL) (C. volkameriana Ten & Pasq,) or nine on the slower-growing sour orange (SO) (C. aurantium L.) rootstocks were established in drainage lysimeters filled with Candler fine sand and fertilized with 30 split applications of N, totaling 76, 140, or 336 g.year(-1) per tree. A single application of double-labeled ammonium nitrate ((Np4N3)-Np-15-N-15, 20% enriched) was applied at each rate to replicate trees, in late April, Leaves, fibrous roots, soil, and leachates were intensively sampled from each treatment over the next 29 days, to determine the fate of the (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 application. Newly developing spring leaves and fruit formed dominant competitive sinks for N-15, accounting for between 40% and 70% of the total N-15 taken up by the various treatments. Large fruit loads intercepted up to 20% of this N-15, at the expense of spring flush development, to the detriment of overall tree N status in low-N frees. Nitrogen supply at less than the currently recommended yearly rate of 380 g/tree exceeded the requirements of 4-year-old grapefruit trees on SO rootstock; however, larger trees an VL rootstock took up the majority of N-15 from this rate over the 29-day period, Nitrogen-use efficiency declined with increasing N rate, irrespective of rootstock, The residual amounts of N-15 remaining in the soil profile under SO trees after this time represented a significant N leaching potential from these sandy soils. Therefore, under these conditions, present N recommendations appear adequate for rootstocks that impart relatively fast growth rates to Citrus trees, but seem excessive for trees on slower-growing rootstock species.\n\nWe investigated effects of salinity on the growth and net gas exchange of CO2 and water vapour in leaves of 2-year-old ‘Sunburst’ mandarin [(Citrus reticulata Blanco)×(Citrus paradisi Macf.×C. reticulata)] trees grafted on either Cleopatra mandarin (C. reticulata) or Carrizo citrange (Citrus sinensis L. Osb.×Poncirus trifoliata L.) rootstocks. Trees were grown in a greenhouse and watered with a complete nutrient solution containing 0, 30, 60 or 90 mM NaCl. After 6 weeks of treatment, tree growth, net gas exchange of leaves, leaf chlorophyll and mineral nutrient concentration were measured. Salinity decreased growth and net gas exchange of leaves on all trees. Cleopatra roots accumulated higher concentrations of Cl− and Na+ than Carrizo roots but ‘Sunburst’ leaves on Cleopatra accumulated less Cl− and Na+ and had higher CO2 exchange rates than those on Carrizo. This corresponded to higher concentrations of leaf N and chlorophyll in leaves of trees on Cleopatra than on Carrizo. Salinity increased N and decreased K+ contents in roots of both rootstocks. Salinity increased N and decreased K+ concentrations in leaves of trees on Cleopatra but not in trees on Carrizo. Salinity also increased Ca2+ concentration and reduced Mg2+ in leaves on Cleopatra. The lower Cl− and Na+ concentration in leaves of ‘Sunburst’ grafted on Cleopatra than on Carrizo, suggests that the salinity tolerance of Cleopatra is associated with ion sequestration in roots with less transport to leaves.\n\nFour-year-old 'Redblush' grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) trees on either the relatively fast-growing rootstock 'Volkamer' lemon (VL) (C. volkameriana Ten. & Pasq.) or on the slower-growing rootstock sour orange (SO) (C. aurantium L.) were transplanted into 7.9-m3 drainage lysimeter tanks filled with native Candler sand, irrigated similarly, and fertilized at three N rates during 2.5 years. After 6 months, effects of N application rate and rootstock on tree growth, evapotranspiration, fruit yield, N uptake, and leaching were measured during the following 2 years. When trees were 5 years old, low, medium, and high N application rates averaged about 79,180, or 543 g N/tree per year and about 126,455, or 868 g N/tree during the following year. Recommended rates average about 558 g N/tree per year. A lysimeter tank with no tree and additional trees growing outside lysimeters received the medium N treatment. Nitrogen concentration in the drainage water increased with N rate and exceeded 10 mg·liter-1 for trees receiving the high rates and also for the no tree tank, Leachale N concentration and total N recovered was greater from trees on SO than from those on VL. Average N uptake efficiency of medium N rate trees on VL was 68% of the applied N and 61% for trees on SO. Nitrogen uptake efficiency decreased with increased N application rates. Trees outside lysimeters had lower leaf N and fruit yield than lysimeter trees. Overall, canopy volume and leaf N concentration increased with N rate, but there was no effect of N rate on fibrous root dry weight. Fruit yield of trees on SO was not affected by N rate but higher N resulted in greater yield for trees on VL. Rootstock had no effect on leaf N concentration, but trees on VL developed larger canopies, had greater fibrous root dry weight, used more water, and yielded more fruit than trees on SO. Based on growth, fruit yield and N leaching loses, currently recommended N rates were appropriate for trees on the more vigorous VL rootstock but were 22% to 69% too high for trees on SO."
