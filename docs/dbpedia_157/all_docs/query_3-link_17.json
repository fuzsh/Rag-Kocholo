        "text": "Author Wojciech Nowicki Shares His New Novel Salki\n\nThe Kosciuszko Foundation in Washington DC invites you\n\nto a book discussion\n\n\"It all blends here unexpectedly: that past and memory with the present\n\nand space. . . . At times, your skin will crawl with pleasure from reading.\"\n\n— Andrzej Stasiuk\n\nLying in bed in Gotland after a writer's conference, thinking about his compulsive desire to travel—and the uncomfortable tensions this desire creates—the narrator of Salki starts recounting tragic stories of his family's past, detailing their lives, struggles, and fears in twentieth-century Eastern Europe. In these pieces, he investigates various \"salkis\"—attic rooms where memories and memorabilia are stored—real and metaphorical, investigating old documents to better understand the violence of recent times.\n\nWinner of the prestigious Gdynia Literary Award for Essay, Salki is in the tradition of the works of W. G. Sebald and Ryszard Kapuściński, utilizing techniques of Polish reportage in creating a landscape of memory that is moving and historically powerful.\n\nMORE INFORMATION >> VIEW EVENT PHOTOS >>\n\nPiano Recital by Tony Hall\n\npast_events\n\nFourth Annual Polish Day at the Kosciuszko Foundation\n\nPOLISH DAY- A COMMUNITY CELEBRATION!\n\nPlease join us on Saturday, July 15th\n\nNOON - 4 PM\n\nCelebrate the Spirit of Poland!\n\nMusic, games, trivia, art exhibit and more!\n\nTraditional Polish lunch will be served\n\nFollowed by a Jazz Concert featuring\n\nKuba Cichocki's Audubon Lab Experiment\n\n4-5 PM\n\n(suggested donation for the concert $15)\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nMark the Year of Kosciuszko!\n\nUNESCO declared 2017 the Year of Kosciuszko to recognize the contributions made by the freedom fighter to both the\n\nUnited States and Poland.\n\nKosciuszko was a brilliant military leader and engineer, but did you know that he was also a composer, artist and an advocate of social justice?\n\nJoin us as we celebrate the life and work of a true Renaissance Man!\n\nWe will finish the day with a jazz concert by a Polish jazz musician.\n\nKuba Cichocki's Audubon Lab Experiment\n\nA 4-piece electric jazz band based in New York City, their sound includes jazz, funk, R&B, Latin, rock and experimental fusion elements.\n\nTheir music explores free improvisation and combines multiple genres to create intellectually stimulating music.

She then studied graphic design and photography in Paris, finding yet other ways of expressing her views of the world. Agata's artistic photography and portraits are in many private collections in USA and UK.\n\nStudying at the London College of Fashion, Agata discovered her current passion in visual arts -- making textiles. She took it a step further at the KLC London School of Interior Design, exploring ways of applying textiles in interiors.\n\nAgata brings the ancient techniques of felting work into interior design. Through her creations of wool art wall hangings, she brings the softness of wool and the freshness of outdoor landscapes into interior spaces.\n\nAgata specializes in designing unique interiors with personal touch. She often integrates artistic photography portraits of her clients and felted art pieces into specific spaces. Her felt art pieces -- wall hangings, wool sculptures, fashionable felted bags and vessels, and felted pillow cases -- are always hand-made, and are a part of many luxury interiors around the Adriatic Sea, UK, Poland, and USA.\n\nAgata has recently moved back to Washington, DC, where she had previously showed her felt art pieces at the Textiles Museum.\n\n\"I love looking at the practical ways of applying art to our lives. My art is a journey through the layers of nature and the psyche -- into our emotional core, which, like the ocean bottom, remains unexplored virgin territory.\"\n\nMeet the Author: John Feffer and his new dystopian novel Splinterlands\n\nJoin us for a Book Party\n\nJohn Feffer: Splinterlands\n\nSaturday, December 3, 2016\n\n5-7pm\n\nBooks will be available for sale.\n\nMORE INFORMATION >>\n\nAnnual Gala Dinner 2016\n\nAnnual Kosciuszko Foundation's Washington, D.C.

He displayed a growing interest in the piano and, training under private tutors and in masterclasses, obtained a Fellowship from the Trinity College of London in 2000.\n\nThe piano took a hiatus as Michael decided to pursue a university degree in the sciences (biotechnology and psychology) in his native Canada, followed by a first career in banking in Hong Kong. He then moved to Europe to obtain a Master's in Business. Settling down in Paris, where he currently works as a strategy and management consultant in the Life Sciences sector, Michael discovered the world of amateur pianists and renewed his passion for the piano.\n\nSince then, he has won top prizes in international piano competitions for amateurs (Chopin Warsaw, Boston, Washington D.C. 2015, Colorado Springs 2011, Paris 2010) and has been regularly invited to perform solo recitals and concertos in Europe and North America. Michael particularly enjoys dialogues with living composers and other creative arts, frequently juxtaposing new creations with the classical repertoire and initiating collaborative projects with visual artists, photographers and poets. In 2014, he premiered 'Tableaux Kitsch' by the Norwegian composer Martin Romberg. Equally an avid chamber musician, Michael regularly plays with professional musician friends from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, l'Orchestre national d'Île-de-France, and the Philharmonia Orchestra.\n\n♫♫♫\n\nPROGRAM\n\nCHOPIN SWING & LATIN SWANK\n\nChopin : Mazurka Op. 59 no. 1\n\nGuastavino : Bailecito\n\nChopin : Mazurka Op. 41 no. 1\n\nMompou : Canción y Danza no. 1\n\nChopin : Mazurka Op. 24 no. 2\n\nGinastera : Milonga Op. 3\n\nChopin : Mazurka Op. 30 no. 4\n\nde Falla : Danza ritual del fuego\n\nMORE INFORMATION >> VIEW EVENT PHOTOS >>\n\nInternet Security Workshop\n\nJoin us for an Internet Security Workshop presented by\n\nJonathan Siudmak,\n\na Federal Technical Specialist at IBM.\n\nThe workshop will last an hour with additional time for questions\n\n(feel free to bring your computers for tech support).\n\nThis workshop was made possible by a community grant from IBM.\n\nThis is a free event.\n\nMeeting with author Izabela Wagner\n\nSOCIOLOGY OF EXCELLENCE - CAREER OF PROFESSIONAL ELITES\n\n\"PRODUCING EXCELLENCE.

Why are these stories important, who is telling them, and above all, who is afraid of women's stories? Feminism is frequently denounced as a public enemy in Poland. Agressive political campaigns against feminism have made the \"ideology of gender\" an important issue. Some in Poland see gender not as a cultural construct, but a dangerous weapon in the culture wars. This growing conflict affects various areas of public life, including research, education and social policy. Is the conflict over the question of gender, or is it a question of power and influence?\n\nMORE INFORMATION >>\n\nPolish Soprano Malgorzata Kellis in concert\n\nMay 9, 2015 at 6:00pm\n\nPolish Soprano Malgorzata Kellis\n\nin concert\n\nTICKETS:\n\n$20 for KF Members\n\n$25 for General Audience\n\nMORE INFORMATION >>\n\nPolish Beer Tasting\n\nWe will start the evening with a short presentation about the different kinds of Polish Beer.\n\nCost:\n\n$20 for KF Members\n\n$25 for non-members\n\nAdmission includes beer tasting as well as delicious snacks\n\nSpace is limited.\n\nRSVP: bbernhardt@thekf.org\n\nMORE INFORMATION >>\n\nKUPINSKI GUITAR DUO\n\nAN EVENING OF CLASSICAL GUITAR PRESENTED BY\n\nKUPINSKI GUITAR DUO:\n\nEWA JABLCZYNSKA & DARIUSZ KUPINSKI\n\nTICKETS:\n\n$20 KF MEMBERS\n\n$25 GENERAL AUDIENCE\n\nRSVP: Barbara Bernhardt at bbernhardt@thekf.org\n\nMORE INFORMATION >>\n\nPod Gorkę\n\nThe Kosciuszko Foundation i Towarzystwo Teatralne:Pod Gorkę\n\nZaprasza Panstwa na niezapomniany patriotyczno-historyczno-liryczny wieczor z aktorem Stanislawem Gorka.\n\nMORE INFORMATION >> VIEW EVENT PHOTOS >>\n\nPĄCZKI DAY!

WE WILL INFORM YOU ABOUT THE NEW DATES SOON.\n\nPlease join us for a discussion about the current situation in Ukraine, with the Defense Attache at the Polish Embassy in the United States,\n\nGeneral Jaroslaw Strozyk\n\nSince the beginning of Euromaidan protests that sprung up last fall in Kyiv and throughout Ukraine, the Poles have been exceptionally active in supporting Ukraine. Polish government leaders have advocated for the Ukrainian cause in European Union and NATO leadership bodies.\n\nMainstream and especially independent media reporters have attracted the Polish public's attention to Ukrainian events, with social networks again playing a key role. Scores of Polish observers have reported from the Maidan in Kyiv, from other Ukrainian cities and the Crimean peninsula.\n\nPolish minority organizations in Ukraine also have endorsed the fight for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and warned against any attempts to sow discord between the Ukrainians and the Poles at this time. Some Polish NGOs have established permanent presence in Ukraine.\n\nIn Poland, many civic organizations and local government institutions provided emergency assistance to Ukrainians. As a result, many Ukrainian Euromaidan participants consider the Poles to be their greatest allies abroad. Overall, the sense of friendship between Poland and Ukraine is now stronger than... perhaps ever, despite horrible events in our past. It has been reported that the newly elected Ukrainian president's first international trip will be to Poland, for the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the breakthrough elections which ended communism in Poland.\n\nMORE INFORMATION >> VIEW EVENT PHOTOS >>\n\nPOLISH LANGUAGE AND CULTURE CLASSES - FALL SEMESTER\n\nFall Semester of Polish Language and Culture Classes will start on Monday, September 15th.\n\nThere will be 4 sections of Polish language instruction:\n\nBeginners I will meet on Thursdays (09/18 - 12/18)\n\nBeginners I continuation will meet on Wednesdays (09/17 - 12/17)\n\nBeginners II will meet on Mondays (09/15 - 12/15)\n\nIntermediate / Advanced section will meet on Tuesdays (09/16 - 12/16)\n\nFor more information please visit:\n\nor email Barbara Bernhardt at:\n\nThank you!\n\nPiano Recital of Krystian Tkaczewski\n\nThe KF is pleased to welcome award winning pianist Krystian Tkaczewski.\n\nMr. Tkaczewski is the founder of the Chopin International Piano Competition in Hartford, CT and has served as a judge for piano competitions from Budapest to Osaka.\n\nMr. Tkaczewski will be playing selections by Chopin and Tchaikovsky (detailed description of the program will follow).\n\nMORE INFORMATION >>\n\nLet's Talk About Poland\n\nPlease join us for another conversation about Poland:\n\n\"So what do you think of Poland?\" - From multicultural city to monocultural city: An American researcher on his four months in Łódź\n\nMORE INFORMATION >>\n\nWashington International Piano Art Council Fall Piano Concert Series #1\n\nFeatured Pianist:Mr. John Gardecki, WIPAC\n\nArtist in Resident\n\nA second generation Polish American, John was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland.

Red Army Red is set in Eastern Bloc Poland where she spent seven years of her childhood and adolescence. The book explores the tensions, humor, and ironies one finds when stuck between opposing ideologies in a changing world and when Poland lurched seemingly overnight from a censored, hardship-ridden society to a free market economy. Red Army Red delivers a nuanced view of momentous historical events that have been depicted in poetry almost exclusively by European writers.

Over two years they explored 23 rivers, 13 of which had never been run before. Most famously, they completed the first descent of Colca River that carves the world's deepest canyon –Colca Canyon in Peru. The Colca is twice as deep as the Grand Canyon with the walls rise to heights of 3200-4200 meters. This achievement earned Piotr a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nIn 1986 Piotr Chmielinski became the first (and so far the only) man in the world to conquer all 7000+ km of Amazon River in a kayak. His whole expedition was later featured in US bestseller Running the Amazon by Joe Kane. Piotr was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for a second time.\n\nChmielinski graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow and is now an owner of HP Environmental – a consulting firm specializing in chemical and microbiological analysis of air and water pollution. Piotr is also a founder of Canoandes foundation dedicated to promoting geographical exploration among young people.\n\nRSVP: 202-785-2320 or thekfdc@gmail.com\n\nShanty - Songs of the Sea\n\nKick the sailing season off right with Krzysztof Malinowski, of Polish sea music fame.
