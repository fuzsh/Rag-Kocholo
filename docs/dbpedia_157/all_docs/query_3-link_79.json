Supported by a series advisory board of accomplished Polonists and Polish-Americanists, the Polish and Polish-American Studies Series has been made possible through generous financial assistance from the Polish American Historical Association and that organization’s Stanley Kulczycki Publication Fund, the Stanislaus A. Blejwas Endowed Chair in Polish and Polish American Studies at Central Connecticut State University, and the Kosciuszko Foundation, and through institutional support from Wayne State University and Ohio University Press. The series has also benefited from the warm encouragement of a number of other persons, including Gillian Berchowitz, M. B. B. Biskupski, the late Stanislaus A. Blejwas, Thomas Duszak, Mary Erdmans, Anna Jaroszy´nska-Kirchmann, Brian McCook, James S. Pula, and Thaddeus Radzilowski, and from the able assistance of the staff of Ohio University Press. The series also has received generous assistance from a growing list of series supporters, including the benefactor Thomas Duszak, the contributor George Bobinski, and additional friends of the series including Alfred Bialobrzeski, William Galush, John A. and Pauline A. Garstka, Jonathan Huener, Grazyna Kozaczka, Neal Pease, and Maria Ziemianek. The moral and material support from all of these institutions and individuals is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nJohn J. Bukowczyk\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nBack in the last century, I had the idea to stray from the beaten track and to write a book exploring absences and asymmetries in the available knowledge on Polish drama. I had just published a study of a major playwright, Tadeusz Różewicz, but for the new book I turned elsewhere—away from celebrated masterworks and canonized aesthetics. Over the course of the next decade, my project grew to a rather different monograph. Although the heart of this book is still drama, its overall subject has become more complex and multilayered: how dramatic writing has engaged with the problem of gendered dichotomies and the puzzle of transgressive patriotism. As I tracked the less familiar traditions of Polish drama and theatre, pored over a wealth of fascinating material ranging from parliamentary speeches to polemical pamphlets and verse broadsides, puzzled over the crossing paths of patriotism and transgression, and struggled to make sense of changing and often contradictory gender expectations, I had a lot of help along the way.\n\nWhen I was just beginning research for my project, I was lucky enough to have many long, wonderful conversations with the late Roman Kaleta of Wrocław University, who enthusiastically supported my decision to take roads less traveled in Polish studies. He extolled the riches of the Ossolineum Library in Wrocław and introduced me to its staff and resources. He also shared his immense knowledge of the Polish Enlightenment and responded with delight rather than dismay to the idea that his archival research could be extended to shed new light on the problem of gender in eighteenth-century Poland. Although I disagree with him on some interpretive points, his work on textual misfits, contentious issues, and uncomfortable topics shunned by others was indispensable to my project. My admiration for and intellectual debt to his scholarship will be readily apparent.\n\nDobrochna Ratajczakowa, a faculty member at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna´n and beyond much doubt the most distinguished scholar of Polish drama and theatre, provided a generous and inspiring exchange during the many years it took to research this book. The discussions we had about neglected dramatic genres, overlooked classics, and forgotten blockbusters led me to explore new perspectives on a field I thought I knew quite well. I also benefited from the conversations with the late Jadwiga Maurer, my long-ago mentor at the University of Kansas and a leading scholar in the field of Mickiewicz studies, from whom I received sage advice at crucial moments and insights that stuck with me for years. She heartily endorsed my project and kept me on track by inquiring every now and then if this was going to be the day for starting my voyage to the post office to send off the manuscript.\n\nMany colleagues and friends—Adam Basak, Monika Blige, Jerzy Daniel, Maria Dębicz, Janusz Degler, Elwira Grossman, Leokadia Kaczy´nska, Andrzej Karcz, Dariusz Kosi´nski, Anna Truszkowska Małecka, Elżbieta Małecka, Michael Mikoś, the late Krystyna Ruta-Rutkowska, Ewa Szyma´nska, and Anna Zacharska—sent me hard-to-find materials. The late Bogdan Czaykowski shared his collection of photocopies from the Czerwony Sztandar, a Soviet collaborationist newspaper published in Polish in Lwów (Lviv) during World War II. Equally generous were those colleagues who read parts or all of the manuscript and gave me feedback that was always valuable: Sibelan Forrester, Oleh Ilnytzkyj, and the anonymous readers for Ohio University Press. I thank them all.\n\nThen there are the archivists and librarians, ever a scholar’s guides. I did most of the research for this book over the course of many summers in the Ossolineum Library. I also worked in the Jagiellonian University Library in Kraków, the library of the Kraków branch of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, theatre archives in Kraków, Warsaw, and Wrocław, and the Memorial Library at the University of Wisconsin in Madison where I teach. At all these libraries and archives, staff members responded to my numerous queries and requests with unfailing patience and promptness, even when all I had were vague and misspelled references (I think his last name might have been Theatralski, a priest, perhaps, who wrote sometime in the eighteenth century). I cannot thank them warmly enough for offering a congenial atmosphere in which to work and for providing me with so much courteous and expert assistance. I am particularly indebted to George Andrew Spencer, Bibliographer for Russian, East European, and Central Asian Studies at the Memorial Library, and Grażyna Rolak of the Early Imprints Department at the Ossolineum Library for helping me track down some rare and obscure pamphlets from the eighteenth century. I was also fortunate to be able to obtain scanned copies of other eighteenth-century materials thanks to the generosity of Elżbieta Bylinowa, Dorota Krauze, Wanda Staszkiewicz, and Elżbieta Zygmuntowicz of the Warsaw University Library, while Robert Davis of Columbia University’s Butler Library promptly sent me a scanned article whose existence I discovered only at the last minute.\n\nI was privileged to try out different parts of my argument at several academic institutions. The conference The Question of the ‘Other’ in Polish Literature and Culture and a follow-up seminar, both of which Elwira Grossman organized at the University of Glasgow in April 1999, provided welcoming forums for the discussion of my work in its early stages. I am very grateful to Dr. Grossman, as I am to the colleagues who invited me to present excerpts from my project in one of the many shapes it inhabited in its slow progress to publication: David Goldfarb for the Slavic Department at Barnard College, Bill Johnston for the Polish Studies Center at Indiana University, Pia Kleber and Tamara Trojanowska for the University College Drama Program at the University of Toronto, Robert Pynsent for the School of Slavonic and East European Studies at University College London, and Richard Rudolph for the Center for Austrian Studies at the University of Minnesota. I am grateful especially for the opportunities these invitations afforded me to interact with audience members who sharpened my ideas and analyses with their comments and who raised more questions than I could possibly answer at the time. I hope that they will find in this book testimony to how much I valued their suggestions.\n\nFunding for my research came from several institutions, but their resources often originate with the thousands of donors and taxpayers who contribute to endowments and research programs. I would like to thank these many anonymous benefactors who made my work possible. I began the research that led to this book while holding fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. Travel grants from the International Research and Exchanges Board facilitated my archival work in Poland. At the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the Graduate School, the William F. Vilas Fellowship Fund, and the Center for Research on Gender and Women provided further financial support. A sabbatical enabled me to revisit the archives once my argument was in place.\n\nMy thanks also go to Gillian Berchowitz, director of Ohio University Press, and John Bukowczyk, editor of the Ohio University Press Polish and Polish-American Studies Series, for their interest and encouragement. I am indebted as well to the staff of the acquisitions department, who wrestled with my computer files with patience and ingenuity, and to managing editor Nancy Basmajian, who provided gracious assistance in the work involved in preparing this book for publication.\n\nMuch of the manuscript was handwritten, though not (as some of my colleagues suspected) with a quill pen. Although I had no research assistants—I have this stubborn conviction that reading the sources with my own eyes is the only way—Thomas Tabatowski performed much appreciated wizardry on my computer when I set out to type the handwritten sections.\n\nDuring my research trips to Wrocław, the late Halina Dzieduszycka and the late Wojciech Dzieduszycki opened their home and their personal library to me. I am deeply grateful for their hospitality. I owe a special debt to Dr. Heather Potter of the Ophthalmology Department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who enabled me to see my project, literally, afresh.\n\nThen there are countless debts that can hardly be put into words. They are due to my family—my most persevering intellectual colleagues, my severest critics, and my firmest supporters. This book is for them.\n\n|||\n\nEarlier versions of short sections of this book were published in Canadian Slavonic Papers / Revue canadienne des slavistes, Indiana Slavic Studies, and Theatre Journal. Some of the material in chapter 4 originally appeared in Engendering Slavic Literatures, edited by Pamela Chester and Sibelan Forrester (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996), as an article entitled The Daughters of Emilia Plater. Chapter 5 derives some material from two articles: Taming a Transgressive National Hero: Tadeusz Kościuszko and Nineteenth-Century Polish Drama, published in The Great Tradition and Its Legacy: The Evolution of Dramatic and Musical Theater in Austria and Central Europe, edited by Michael Cherlin, Halina Filipowicz, and Richard L. Rudolph (New York: Berghahn Books, 2003), and Othering the Kościuszko Uprising: Women as Problem in Polish Insurgent Discourse, published in Studies in Language, Literature, and Cultural Mythology in Poland: Investigating The Other, edited by Elwira M. Grossman (Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 2002). All of these materials have undergone many sea changes: they have been reconceptualized, augmented with new research, rewritten, and integrated into the book’s larger argument.\n\nAs anyone who peruses my endnotes will discover, I have learned a great deal from those who preceded me. If I have failed to acknowledge my indebtedness in a particular case, it is inadvertently, and I ask indulgence. All translations are my own unless otherwise noted. I try to maintain gender- neutral language as far as possible, but it is sometimes evident that when the writers I discuss say he, they do not mean he or she. In these cases, I have felt obliged to follow their usage in order to avoid altering their sense.\n\nAll the customary caveats apply, which is to say that I have on occasion resisted excellent advice with my own readings of textual evidence.\n\nCompass Points: A Prologue\n\nWe live so fully enclosed in the circle of nationalism that we can hardly see beyond it.\n\n—John H. Schaar, Legitimacy in the Modern State\n\nIf words are also deeds, as Ludwig Wittgenstein’s aphorism reminds us, it is appropriate (and necessary) to give an account not merely of what plays are saying but of what they are doing in propounding their arguments.[1]Accordingly, one way to approach plays is to consider them as rhetorical performances in which stances are tried out for reasons that cannot be taken for granted at the outset. The challenge of such analysis and interpretation is compounded, on the one hand, by the Derridean interrogation of the transparency of language and, on the other, by the many forms of censorship that act on playwrights. With these points in mind, I propose to examine a rich array of plays by many authors, from Franciszek Dionizy Kniaźnin’s The Spartan Mother (Matka Spartanka), staged by Izabela Czartoryska in 1786, to Anna Bojarska’s The Polish Lesson (Lekcja polskiego), directed by Andrzej Wajda in 1988.\n\nIt may be helpful to know that The Spartan Mother features in Margaret R. Hunt’s magisterial monograph, Women in Eighteenth-Century Europe, as one of the heavily politicized cultural interventions into the central debates of its time and place.[2]It may be intriguing to discover that Władysław Ludwik Anczyc’s Kościuszko at Racławice (Kościuszko pod Racławicami, 1880), a source of frustration to modern critics, has made it to a list of the fifteen best plays ever written in the Polish language.[3]And it may be gratifying to find that my selection also includes a classic of Polish political satire: The Return of the Deputy (Powrót posła, 1791) by Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, one of the most conspicuous stars of the Warsaw literary scene in the early 1790s. With this play, he made a major contribution to a vigorous exchange of rhetorical fire during what his contemporaries called the Polish Revolution of 1788–92.[4]The completion of The Return of the Deputy in November 1790 coincided with the publication in London, also in November 1790, of Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France and Mary Wollstonecraft’s rebuttal to Burke, A Vindication of the Rights of Men. While Burke denounced the upheavals taking place in France and depicted revolutionists as violators of royalty and womanhood, Niemcewicz, like Wollstonecraft, declared sympathy for the French Revolution. Performed with deliberate polemical intent at the Warsaw National Theatre in January 1791, The Return of the Deputy proved to be a bombshell with immediate and far-reaching political repercussions. Because its inflammatory content attracted massive attention, ranging from over-the-top enthusiasm to outrage and indignation, it would not be extravagant to say that few plays and theatrical performances anywhere and at any time had more direct or suggestive impact on their original audiences than the 1791 production of Niemcewicz’s drama. However, much of the textual territory I want to explore remains uncharted in scholarship, even though many of the plays I propose to discuss, and not just The Spartan Mother or The Return of the Deputy, were successful at claiming a prominent place in public life in the past.\n\nIn Benjamin Bennett’s pivotal phrase, the dramatic genre is the memory and the conscience of literature.[5]I take this phrase to mean that one of the most significant achievements of dramatic writing is its ability to make plausible and convincing a broad range of conflicting conceptions and beliefs. To gain a fuller view of Polish drama and its engagement with political disagreement and conflict, I set out to recover a wide variety of plays, including those that have been sidelined or neglected in scholarly commentary. I began with the mid-eighteenth century when a demand for plays in print rose sharply in Poland, partly because of a rapid growth of the reading public, partly because of changes in reading habits, and partly because Enlightenment pedagogues and politicians enlisted drama as a forum for public debate. It also helps to recognize that residents of large areas of the country had only sporadic access to theatrical performance. It should not be particularly surprising, then, that plays were predominantly part of a burgeoning print culture. While some playwrights wrote explicitly for the stage, many others took advantage of the explosion of print culture and wrote with a readership in mind. Booksellers’ advertisements, lending library records, inventories of private collections, and other sources of evidence, however fragmentary and frustrating, permit us to track in bold outlines the reading public’s fascination with drama, which at times surpassed interest in the novel.[6]The surging demand for plays made dramatic literature a lucrative business for printers and booksellers. For example, Pierre Dufour, one of the largest printer-booksellers in Enlightenment Poland, brought out more than thirty plays between 1775 and 1779. His drama- publishing project was so successful that he launched a series entitled The Polish Theatre (Teatr Polski) in 1779. Over the next fifteen years, he published fifty-six volumes of The Polish Theatre, each volume consisting of up to five plays.[7]\n\nEnjoying a large readership, the dramatic genre became a major venue through which the public was socialized into certain modes of belief and certain value orientations. This historical phenomenon, however, has eluded sustained investigation in Polish studies. To be sure, the work of leading playwrights and theatre practitioners has been extensively discussed, and the existing secondary literature contains a great deal of valuable scholarship on their achievements. But despite strong interest in Polish theatre and drama, a substantial body of material has yet to be fully acknowledged, examined, and documented.\n\nAdmittedly, it is almost impossible to resist the temptation to consider only those authors who for various reasons have entered the canon of academic culture and to leave out of consideration those who have failed to establish enduring reputations even though they developed a high profile in their own time as writers and public intellectuals. Although such oversights may be innocent, the almost exclusive focus on more familiar texts in the usual channels of scholarly commentary and curricular inclusion has had the effect of de-emphasizing the diversity of cultural practice in the past as well as generating some misleading epistemological assumptions. For example, it has nearly become an article of faith that a distinctively modern Polish culture emerged only in the Romantic era or that Poland’s paradigmatic National Symbolic was forged single-handedly by Romantic poets such as Adam Mickiewicz.[8]Likewise, a Polish version of the myth of maternal virtue, known as the myth of the Polish mother, is presumed to have originated during Romanticism, in reaction to Poland’s loss of independence in 1795 and necessarily via the cult of the Virgin Mary.[9]Such misapprehensions, sanctified by an earlier generation of commentators, have had remarkable staying power.\n\nIn response to these challenges, I turn to an archive of dramatic writing that has rarely been studied. I would like to retrieve this archive not only in the sense of dusty manuscripts and crumbling volumes that for the most part sleep undisturbed in libraries but also in the sense invoked by Michel Foucault when he sought to direct historical inquiry away from individual works to the discursive structures that support them.[10]I share Arlette Farge’s sense that the archives are always explosive.[11]They offer alternatives to generally accepted views and interpretations, complicating attempts at theorizing solely on the basis of established classics and other well-known materials. My purpose here is to make a case for the need to reevaluate the contribution made to Poland’s cultural history by what might be called the other traditions of Polish drama and theatre—a plethora of material that, regardless of the popular or elite status of individual works, falls outside the purview of dominant critical paradigms and thus remains poorly understood. I have been inspired in part by John Ashbery’s efforts to recover the less familiar traditions of American and English poetry. In one of his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures, presented at Harvard University in 1989–90, Ashbery said: I myself value Schubert more than Pound or Eliot.[12]He meant David Schubert, not Franz Schubert, and one can imagine some members of his audience gasping.\n\nTaking account of an overlooked or undervalued archive of dramatic writing, along with its vision of the thoughtways, interests, and desires of the public, has considerable implications for the widely accepted claim that the role of drama and theatre in the civic life of Polish society has been both vigorous and important. In Poland, according to this claim, plays and performances have repeatedly opened up possibilities of resistance and redress, thus confirming that drama and theatre can constitute a platform of activist and interventionist engagement, inspired by movements for political and social change. To put this another way, had the political role of drama and theatre been negligible in Poland, the level of concern it created among the authorities would be impossible to explain satisfactorily. I do not contest that the twists and turns of modern Polish history have strengthened the traditional significance of the stage as a magnification mirror for the circumstances that lie outside or that theatre and drama have enjoyed remarkable cultural authority in Polish society. But I argue that the engagement of Polish drama and theatre with politics cannot be explained solely through celebrated masterworks and canonized aesthetics. To allow a more complex picture, it is necessary to find room for the ignored spinster aunts and odd bachelor uncles of the nuclear family. They, too, participated in the broader dialogue on the social and political commitments of theatre and drama and had a hand in the shaping of idea(l)s and beliefs—sometimes even more insistently or subversively than their more acclaimed and more richly furnished relatives.\n\nGiven the sheer volume of plays that make up the other traditions, it is impossible to imagine any attempt to convey a sense of their range and depth without sacrificing one to the other. Rather than provide a general overview, then, I want to concentrate on a few topics only, chief among them an idea/phenomenon whose meaning is in dispute: patriotism.\n\nFor some users of the term, patriotism is synonymous with communitarian solidarity and a concern for the public good; for others, it is interchangeable with oppressive collectivism, crusading chauvinism, blindness to the darker aspects of the national past, sensitivity to slights to the national honor, and belligerent huffing by wavers of the national flag. Those for whom human life is communal to its roots might admire patriotism because it can lift individuals out of their narrow preoccupations and selfish interests; others will regard it with fear and loathing as a cloak of deceit and an armor of righteousness put on by cynical politicians intent on securing their goals.[13]While one person might say that patriotism is one of the important associative relationships that people develop and as such supplies the strong common identification that is necessary for a democratic political community to function, another will dismiss patriotism as nationalism’s bloody brother, each characterized by exaggerated love for one’s own collectivity combined with more or less contempt and hostility toward outsiders.[14]The conflict of opinion about patriotism has been best summarized by Alasdair MacIntyre: At one end is the view, taken for granted by almost everyone in the nineteenth century, . . . that ‘patriotism’ names a virtue. At the other end is the contrasting view, expressed with sometimes shocking clarity in the nineteen sixties, that ‘patriotism’ names a vice.[15]\n\nAlthough patriotism is a relatively new term that came into general use for the first time in the eighteenth century, the conception of allegiance to patria dates back to Greek and Roman antiquity.[16]Despite its long history, however, patriotism has rarely been the object of in-depth exploration in scholarship. In particular, only a handful of studies has considered it in relation to the circumstances of a specific time and place.[17]Moreover, although gender norms, or prescriptive standards of masculinity and femininity, have shaped assumptions about patriotic responsibilities, the interaction between patriotism and gender has scarcely been touched upon in existing scholarly accounts.[18]Admittedly, gender sometimes seems to be erased or invisible in patriotic discourse; on other occasions, however, it can be hypervisible as when the skills and qualities of women are celebrated over those of men (or vice versa). But invisible or hypervisible, gender can offer a lens through which to read how concepts of patriotism are constructed.\n\nIn the past, commentators tended to treat the concept of patriotism as timeless, monolithic, and self-evident. As Dustin Griffin points out, even those scholars who gave extensive attention to the subject of patriotism largely . . . regarded it in unproblematic terms, as a ‘universal’ emotion, constant across time and space.[19]Given this general consensus, it would be reasonable to suppose that patriotism comes in a single, unambiguous form: love of patria. But to accept this assumption is to overlook the fact that while the term patria has outlived the old, classical world, its meaning has been far from stable.[20]Any attempt to understand patriotism inevitably and inescapably leads to the questions: What exactly is the patria that patriots claim to love? Are they lovers of patria in the sense of a geographic area, a polity, or a set of values and ideals? Is the object of their loyalty and devotion a community of their fellow citizens or (to invoke the ancient Stoics’ understanding of patria) the universal society to which all humans belong?[21]And if patria refers to the patriots’ native country, do they love their homeland as it is, as it once was, or as it might be?[22]\n\nTo compound the problem, the equation of the patriot with the dutiful son (or daughter) and patriotic obligations with the bonds of filial affection has become so ubiquitous that it seems almost indelicate to invoke John Adams who, in a series of essays published in the Boston Gazette in 1765, argued that those who seek separation from the mother country are not necessarily unpatriotic.[23]To compound the problem even further, Richard Price, who worked with a political club called the London Revolution Society, the revolution being that of 1688, made a historic case for a patriotism that contains strong universalist, even cosmopolitan strains. Price’s A Discourse on the Love of Our Country (1789), best remembered today as the burning speech that provoked Burke’s wrath in Reflections on the Revolution in France, begins with three crucial caveats. First, our country should not be understood in a purely geographical sense, but should be regarded as a corporate community of persons bound together by the same civil polity and protected by the same laws. Second, the love of our country does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government. Third, the love of our country should not be confused with that spirit of rivalship and ambition which has been common among nations. Patriots should love their country ardently but not exclusively; while performing the duty they owe to their country, they should also accept wider responsibilities as citizens of the world and in so doing take care to maintain a just regard to the rights of other countries.[24]Price’s idea of patriotism, in other words, rejects compatriot partiality or the widely and deeply held belief that we are permitted to show greater concern for compatriots than for strangers. In Price’s view, being a patriot entails a moral obligation to, and solidarity with, all other human beings, who should be viewed as fellow citizens.\n\nIn recent scholarly literature, patriotism finds little favor.[25]Its critics consider the whole idea/phenomenon of patriotism as tired and passé. An odd relic of a bygone epoch, a stiffly unattractive, embarrassing, even offensive anachronism, it has nothing to offer to a much needed ethic for global citizenship. Or to be more precise, the era of globalization in which we are living, and particularly the erosion of national barriers through the rapid expansion of new communication technologies and transnational cultural networks, makes the notion of patriotic allegiance and obligation untenable. Yet there are also those commentators who recognize, on the contrary, that patriotism is far from becoming a useless fossil of a lost world. To them, the continuing appeal of patriotism is a cause for concern. The reasons for this concern are not hard to identify. While the emotional pull of patriotism in the sense of attachment to one’s homeland, its people, and its cultural heritage (to mention only the most obvious forms) remains strong in the age of globalization and the attendant logic of placelessness, it is not unusual to see patriotic affection appropriated for the promotion of the our country, right or wrong idea, absorbed into chauvinist enthusiasms and exhortations, exploited for the veneration of the nation, or engaged to pay dividends for the politics of nationalism.[26]Terminologically, the slide of patriotism into nationalism is facilitated by a consistent tendency in the anglophone world \"to sentimentalize the state by calling it the nation.\"[27]As the term patriotism is reconceptualized as a mild, euphemistic alternative to ‘nationalism,’ ‘national pride’ or ‘national loyalty,’ and the exclusionist rhetoric of the nation is dressed up as patriotic conviction, those who oppose chauvinist fervor and xenophobic bigotry are stigmatized as unpardonably disloyal.[28]\n\nConsidering that patriotism has often carried with it both racism and xenophobia, that patriotic sentiments are routinely co-opted for chauvinism and jingoism, and that the terms patriotism and nationalism are used interchangeably, it is hardly surprising that many commentators respond to patriotism at best with embarrassment and at worst with downright hostility.[29]In 1946, Merle Curti defined patriotism as love of country, pride in it, and readiness to make sacrifices for what is considered its best interest; as such, he noted briefly, it is related to nationalism.[30]Fifty years later, George Kateb identified patriotism as a dangerous, potentially lethal form of group membership and allegiance, driven by narcissistic commitment emanating from love of one’s country:\n\nHow can one love such a mottled or hybrid entity as a country, particularly when, as in a democracy, the country’s people are (always by imputation and sometimes in fact) directly and indirectly responsible for the country’s wicked policies? . . . One does and sometimes should love persons beyond good and evil, so to speak; but to love a country, an abstract entity capable of so much harm, especially to those outside, to those who are not fellow-patriots, but rather patriots of their own, if they are patriots at all—that is an unacceptable idea. . . . The evil done in the world by nationalism and patriotism, commonly abetted by racism or ethnocentrism, and often by religion as well, is immense.[31]\n\nKateb conceded that patriotism may be mobilized for a good cause, but he darkly warned that much more easily, it may be mobilized for an unjust one.[32]\n\nThe fact that a 2001 law, which gives the US government wide new powers to bypass fundamental civil liberties such as due process of law and protection from unwarranted searches and seizures, is named the Patriot Act has not boosted the reputation of patriotism. And the reputation of literature on patriotic themes has for decades been quite low because this body of writing is typically (and not unjustifiably) associated with stirring exhortations and panegyrical effusions. That said, I was intrigued to find, for instance, that The Patriot’s Calendar, published in London in the 1790s, contained both the Magna Carta and the Marseillaise.[33]Studies such as Albert Goodwin’s The Friends of Liberty: The English Democratic Movement in the Age of the French Revolution reminded me that the eighteenth-century roots of the term patriotism were in the defense of citizens’ rights, the struggle against outrages of centralized power, and the fight against corruption in government. Accordingly, radical reformers in Britain between 1790 and 1850 viewed themselves, initially at least, not as Chartists or Dissenters, socialists or trade-unionists, but as ‘patriots’ defending a familiar set of patriot concerns—liberty, property, and constitutional rights.[34]Focused on the opposition to the increasingly centralized state and the growing capitalist economic order, their patriot cause was \"internationalist in its leanings.\"[35]Thus, the patriot of The Patriot’s Calendar stood for political equality, popular sovereignty, and social justice, rather than simply a romantic attachment to country.\n\nPublications such as The Patriot’s Calendar inspired my decision to revisit the concept of patriotism and to explore its equivocal and, at times, ambiguous meanings. Clearly, the perplexities and paradoxes that inhere in the question of patriotic beliefs, idea(l)s, allegiances, motives, intentions, aspirations, and commitments invite closer scrutiny. To be sure, there is no lack of commentaries arguing that patriotism welds together a strong sense of national identity with identification around a sense of the common good. But is this the only possible way to understand patriotism? Aren’t a sense of national identity and a sense of the common good distinct and even in tension for some patriots? And isn’t it reductive to link the exercise of patriotism to prideful admiration for the greatness of one’s country rather than to the acknowledgment of its weaknesses?\n\nTo say that patriotism is a highly contentious yet oddly slippery category would be an understatement. This book begins with the recognition that patriotism is a notoriously promiscuous concept that seems to depend on a timeless conjunction of love and duty but carries multivalent meanings that have seldom been the object of a sustained analysis. Combining archival research with historical contextualization and critical theory, Taking Liberties is an attempt to elaborate a fresh approach to a complicated, contradictory, and often confusing idea/phenomenon known as patriotism. The core of my argument is that the porousness or elasticity of the concept of patriotism allows it to connect, converge, and cross-pollinate with other discourses and practices in unpredictable, even heretical ways. Through a series of engagements with the work of writers such as Kniaźnin and Bojarska, this study tracks some of the unorthodox interactions, exemplified here by the interplay between patriotism and transgression of social or customary norms, and it examines how and to what ends playwrights have grappled, either directly or obliquely, with a puzzling, seemingly absurd nexus between patriotic commitment and transgressive nonconformity. Although my project is situated in a particular historical context and steeped in local knowledge, its reach extends beyond its immediate subject and scholarly discipline. I hope to show that battles waged over the meaning and practice of patriotism; clashes between competing views of patriotic idea(l)s, principles, and concerns; controversies over proper and improper forms of rebellious insubordination; and attempts to distinguish the true patriot from the false not only illuminate the strong dependence of patriotism on local time and circumstance but also constitute rich terrain for investigating some of the broader issues—such as cultural memory and authority—that are at the center of debates in the humanities.[36]\n\nThis project began as an exploration of a vast trove of material bequeathed by those prolific generations between the mid-eighteenth and early twentieth centuries, contracted to focus on the 1880s and 1890s, and, finally, expanded to encompass the period between the mid-1780s and the late 1980s. I start, unconventionally, with Kniaźnin’s The Spartan Mother, staged as a lavish private theatrical at an aristocratic court in June 1786, and end with Lech Wałęsa’s public extravaganza-cum-masquerade, performed al fresco, on the site of an eighteenth-century battle, in May 1989. I made the decision to devote more chapters to the eighteenth century after I realized that the efforts in scholarship to locate the foundations of modern Polish culture in the Romantic period and to use Romanticism as a grid for conceptualizing the engagement of Polish literature with politics have been so successful that, paradoxically, they have diminished an entire era: the Enlightenment. The paradox (or the irony) here is that, for generation after generation, Polish political commentators have drawn their fundamental concepts and analogies from the tumultuous history of Enlightenment Poland and taught their lessons by referring to it.[37]Clearly, Poland’s long eighteenth century has had an even longer afterlife, even though the hermetic view of the Polish Romantic age, of which Maria Janion has been the leading magus for many years, encourages us to believe that there was an irrevocable break between the Enlightenment and Romanticism in Poland. At a time when the Enlightenment continues to be one of the most debated themes of contemporary intellectual discourse,[38]a reductive and misleading dichotomy—a conventional opposition of an Enlightenment of unoriginality, rationality, emotional restraint, and decorum versus a Romanticism of aesthetic daring, sublime emotionality, heroic individualism, and edgy, threshold-crossing subjects—dominates the thinking about Polish culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Nowadays the meaning of the Polish Enlightenment has shrunk and narrowed so much that its cultural history appears uncontroversial, unproblematic, even boring. It is not particularly surprising, then, that the Enlightenment has become one of the most neglected periods in the poststructuralist discourse of Polish literary and cultural studies.[39]This neglect is unfortunate. For example, the fixation on the rationality of the Enlightenment misrepresents trends in eighteenth-century moral philosophy that resorted to the sway of the passions, the language of sentiment and feelings, and the heightened appreciation of sensibility. Moreover, although masculinity and femininity were key categories of Enlightenment thought, we know surprisingly little about the Polish Enlightenment’s debate about gender.\n\nI had planned to conclude this book with the last theatre season before World War I, but I decided to include more twentieth-century plays after I discovered, on one of my (all too) many furloughs from work on my project, Stefan Otwinowski’s Easter (Wielkanoc). Drafted in 1943 and published by the Central Commission of Polish Jews in 1946, Easter is the earliest attempt in any language to depict the 1943 uprising in the Warsaw ghetto through the medium of drama. A wealth of scholarship has expanded our knowledge of literary and theatrical representations of the Holocaust, but when I set out to do research on Easter, I found that it had received scant critical attention. In the play, historical figures find modern counterparts, and events both past and present jostle one another. This in itself is not exceptional, but what still stands out is a puzzling conflation of the Jewish uprising of 1943 and the Polish insurrection of 1794. This conflation startled me, first by its seeming absurdity, then by its possible implications. I could not proceed with my project until I was clear in my mind about what the 1794 insurgency was doing in a play about the resistance of the Warsaw ghetto. Easter was an invitation to search for missing pieces of the puzzle, hidden in libraries. I found myself dealing with gaps, omissions, tense silences, censored traumas, buried anxieties, haunting shadow themes, thickening layers of significance, endlessly multiplying connotations, and no clear sense of closure. Madness may lie in that direction, but so too might a richer sense of Polish cultural history.\n\nIn a book that enables the other traditions of Polish drama and theatre to emerge from the shadows of condescension and neglect so that complications and contradictions of patriotic discourse can be examined, it is impossible to avoid the question: Why take up this topic now?\n\nOne reason is that in the age of boundless opportunities for global connectivity, transnational cultural traffic, and intensified hybridization it is still axiomatic that patriotism and allegiance to one’s nation go together and that patriots should look to the well-being of their own nation and defend its core interests.[40]As the magic of national we-identities continues to hold sway in the ostensibly globalized postmodern culture, patriotic commitments are typically explained within a nationalist paradigm, and concepts such as cosmopolitan patriotism are viewed as a contradiction in terms.[41]"
