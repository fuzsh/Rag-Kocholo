        "text": "The Orchestra of the Capital Royal City of Krakow Sinfonietta Cracovia is one of the leading chamber orchestras in Poland. It stands out thanks to the performance versatility it offers.\n\nSinfonietta successfully translates the chamber music precision and flexibility of the sound for the symphonic ensemble. This is why it is praised for the performances of contemporary music in its various forms (from avant-garde to film music).\n\nThe Orchestra of the Capital Royal City of Krakow Sinfonietta Cracovia is one of the leading chamber ensembles in Poland. The character of the Orchestra is defined by the performance versatility, precision and flexibility which is successfully transferred to a symphonic ensemble. Sinfonietta Cracovia is praised for its performances of contemporary music in its various forms (from avant-garde to film music). In search for new forms, it becomes involved in numerous projects promoting new music and works of Polish composers. It is famous for its interpretations of the works of Krzysztof Penderecki, the mentor and patron of many of the Orchestra’s projects.\n\nAs a municipal cultural institution, Sinfonietta Cracovia daily participates in creating the cultural offer for Krakow residents and visitors from outside the city. At the same time, it builds its prestige and artistic potential through cooperation with international festivals, and by inviting the stars of the most important musical centres to joint collaborative projects. The Orchestra regularly participates in international concert tours, promoting Polish music abroad (from China, to Europe, to the United States), in phonographic projects and recordings for film and television.\n\nKatarzyna Tomala-Jedynak\n\nfirst conductor / artistic director\n\ntomala@sinfonietta.pl\n\nGraduate of Symphonic and Orchestra Conducting at the Karol Lipiński Academy of Music (2013) and post-graduate studies in the management of cultural institutions at the Wroclaw University of Economics and Business (2019). She honed her conducting skills during masterclasses with Jin Wang, Jorma Panula, Sian Edwards, Mark Heron, Tadeusz Strugała,Gabriela Chmura, and Rafał Delekta. Her repertoire includes symphonic, chamber music, opera, operetta, ballet, as well as film music and musicals. In the 2014/2015 season she was the resident conductor of the Beethoven Academy Orchestra (within the programme of the Institute of Music and Dance). In 2015, she began regular cooperation with Teatr Wielki in Poznan. In 2017. she was among the five international scholarship holders of the prestigious Dartington International Summer School programme. In 2021, she received the Jan Kiepura Theatre Music Award in the category “best conductor”. Moreover, she conducted numerous ensembles in Poland and abroad, collaborating with eminent soloists and leading festivals. One of the major aspects of the artist’s activities is popularization of classical music and taking part in educational projects that promote participation in cultural life.\n\nAleksander Dębicz is one of the most versatile pianists and composers. A native of Poland, he has toured both at home and abroad in numerous countries and has 4 albums and numerous compositions to his name. Dębicz’s unique style includes improvisations on original music, often combining this with the repertoire of classic masters. His original works are innovative, wide ranging in style and unforgettable. In his work, he has been showing a passion for film art for many years and it is in this direction that he is currently pursuing. He is know for is recordings (especially for “Warner Classics”) and unconventional performances, such as the Gramophone Classical Music Awards Winners’ Lockdown Charity Gala, where they performed their collaboration “Stay at Home” which received an effusive review in The Times.\n\nMy first album, “Cinematic Piano”, opened up new artistic paths for me. Some of them fascinated me from the start even though I cannot name them. As an abstract art, music can – and sometimes even should – get off the beaten track, regardless of whether it is rooted in classical genres, jazz, or film. “Sideways” has been an attempt to continue my journey, learn new things and develop. – Aleksander Dębicz\n\nThe piece „Sideways” comes from the latest album by Aleksander Dębicz under the same title, which consists his compositions for larger instrumental ensembles, but also interpretations of two classical composers – Bach and Gershwin. For the Kilar|Glass tour in the USA, Aleksander Dębicz also arranged and composed a new material especially dedicated to Sinfonietta Cracovia.\n\nSIDEWAYS linkfire: https://debicz.lnk.to/Sideways"
