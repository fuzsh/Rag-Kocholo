        "text": "This presentation is aimed at discussing the role of the person names in the monetary legend present on coins of Cyrene during the IV c. BC. Some irregularities in the analysis of die links, reuse of dies to produce coins in the name of more than one person and the absence of names on dies linked to emissions with name point that these names do not follow a succession of magistrates charged at regular intervals and reinforce the hypothesis that these are related to people who donated metal for the monetary production of the polis. Crossing numismatic and epigraphic sources emerge the names are related to aristocratic Cyreneans that assumed important political and military charges during the century and many of them – or their families – participated as benefactors in an important urbanistic restructuring of the Sanctuary of Apollo and the other sectors of the city."
