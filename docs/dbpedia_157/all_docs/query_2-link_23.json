Roots can overgrow the geotextile and thus obtain access to water. The objective of the experiment was to determine the effect of the geocomposite on the growth of container-grown Brunnera macrophylla. The geocomposite was used as a multi-compound fertilizer (Insol ® U) carrier and compared with soluble fertilizer (SF) and controlled-release fertilizer (CRF). The doses of fertilizers were calculated to cover the equal N supply: 0.36 and 0.72 g plant −1. The geocomposite positively influenced the plant traits after 8 and 16 weeks of cultivation. The number of leaves increased by 42% and 60% and the biomass of the above-ground parts of plants increased by 260% and 340% in comparison to plants treated with other fertilizers. The effect of the fertilization rate on plants was weakly pronounced, but a positive influence of a higher dose and the GC combined on all the examined traits of Siberian bugloss plants was detected.\n\nImpact of mulching on growth essential oil composition and its biological activity in Monarda didyma L\n\nDecember 2018\n\n·\n\n125 Reads\n\n·\n\n24 Citations\n\nIndustrial Crops and Products\n\nKatarzyna Wróblewska\n\n·\n\nAntoni Szumny\n\n·\n\nBarbara Żarowska\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nSaskia Fabian\n\nThe primary focus was the determination of the yield and chemical composition of essential oils of honey balm (Monarda didyma L.) leaves and flowers as affected by using modern water-retention systems in the form of synthetic mulches: polypropylene non-woven textile compared with fabric and additionally supplemented with the geocomposite. The leaves were harvested for six months during subsequent plant development stages, through juvenile and generative to cessation of growth. Used in experiments, synthetic mulches contributed to reduced growth, fresh weight and flowering of Monarda 'Scorpio' plants. But these were not affected by the application of geocomposite. Twenty-nine constituents found in the green tissue samples of Monarda 'Scorpio' turn out to be mainly terpenoids with linalool (pure (R)-(-) isomer), p-cymene, thymol and thymol methyl ether as main compounds. The different chemical composition was represented by the flowers essential oil which possesses p-cymene and terpinolene (above 80%) as main compounds. Monarda 'Scorpio' oil revealed the strong antimicrobial activity and completely inhibited the growth of Candida albicans yeast as well as Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria in a concentration of 0.01%. In the other tested bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli), elongation of the lag phase was determined or effectiveness at only higher (0.1%) concentrations of essential oil. Proven in our experiments, antimicrobial activity of Monarda 'Scorpio' EO was higher than that described in European Pharmacopoeia for used in herbal medicine sage, and comparable to the effectiveness of oregano.\n\nGeocomposite use in container nursery production of selected ornamental shrubs\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n·\n\n26 Reads\n\n·\n\n3 Citations\n\nActa Horticulturae\n\nMagdalena Pancerz\n\n·\n\nPrzemysław Bąbelewski\n\n·\n\nR. Dębicz\n\nGeocomposite, which is an innovative technology of superabsorbent material (hydrogels) occurring in a form of openwork discs closed in black agrotextile, reduces the negative impact of soil/substrate on the absorption capacity of hydrogel with simultaneous reduction of the negative impact of the hydrogel on the physical soil/substrate parameters. The aim of this research was to assess the influence of geocomposite use with different fertilizers and their doses (3 g Osmocote Plus 3-4M, 1.5 g Osmocote Plus 3-4M, 3×1 g YaraMila Complex) on biomass production of Prunus pumila var. depressa (Pursh) Bean and Diervilla lonicera Mill. cultivated in containers in an unheated foil tunnel. Fresh and dry biomass of both species was higher with the use of geocomposite, which did not affect root/shoot ratios for either taxa. For both species, fresh and dry shoots weight was the highest with 3 g Osmocote. The highest fresh and dry root weights and root/shoot ratios of Prunus was noted in 1.5 g Osmocote, while the fertilization had no effect on total weight of this plant. Diervilla obtained the highest fresh and dry root and total weight with 3 g Osmocote. The highest fresh and dry root/shoot ratio was noted in 1.5 g Osmocote. For both species, the highest fresh and dry biomasses were achieved by the use of geocomposite in combination with 3 g Osmocote fertilizer. The lowest fresh and dry shoot weights were obtained by both species with 1.5 g Osmocote fertilization without the use of geocomposite. The lowest fresh and dry root/shoot ratios occurred in treatments using 3 g of Osmocote without geocomposite application. The results of this research show that geocomposite use in container nursery production of ornamental shrubs had a positive influence on shoot and root growth. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The two-factorial experiment with three ornamental plant taxa Gazania rigens ‘Kiss Yellow’, Salvia farinacea ‘Fairy Queen’ and Verbena ‘Obsession Lilac’ was conducted in the years 2012-2013. The first factor was foliar application of Si in form of ortho-silicic acid stabilized with choline (YaraVita Actisil) at the concentrations of 60, 120 and 180 mg·dm⁻³, while the second was soil application of multinutrient fertilizer (Insol U) at the concentrations of 0.25% and 0.50%. Biometric measurements of plants were carried out at the beginning of flowering. The laboratory analyses included the determination of the content of P, K, Ca, Mg and Si as well as chlorophyll content in the leaves. Silicon had a beneficial influence on a majority of the analysed morphological features. Plants reacted best to high silicon doses (120 and 180 mg·dm⁻³). Particularly beneficial effects were noted with respect to improved flowering of all analysed plant taxa and to the vegetative development of Salvia and Gazania. Insol U supplementation noticeably improved the flowering of Verbena.\n\nInfluence of different cultivation factors on biometric features of North American hackberry (Celtis occidentalis L.)\n\nJanuary 2017\n\n·\n\n34 Reads\n\n·\n\n1 Citation\n\nPrzemysław Bąbelewski\n\n·\n\nMagdalena Pancerz\n\n·\n\nR.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods for nursery production of this species. The aim of this research was to determine the effect of fertilization and different methods of cultivation in rows with simultaneous use of geocomposite on the growth of North American hackberry in nursery production. Mechanical fallow in rows ha the most preferably influence, while living mulch with perennial ryegrass had rather negative impact on tested biometric features of North American hackberry. There was found a positive correlation between biometric features and foliar N content, as well as negative correlation between biometric features and soil salinity.\n\nInfluence of foliar treatment with silicon contained in the Actisil Hydro Plus preparation on the growth, flowering and chemical composition of Gazania rigens (L.)

It also influences the formation of morphological traits of plants. The aim of our research was to determine the influence of silicon contained in the Actisil preparation on the growth and blooming of Gazania rigens, Salvia farinacea and Verbena hybrida, which are commonly cultivated in flowerbeds and on balconies. A two-factor experiment consisted of the foliar application of a solution of silicon in the following concentrations: 0 mg dm-3, 120 mg dm-3and 240 mg dm-3. The application was performed 2, 4 and 6 times at one-week intervals. Biometric measurements were carried out at the beginning of the blooming of plants. The laboratory analyses included determinations of P, K, Mg, Ca, Si and the chlorophyll content in leaves. Beneficial influence of silicon on most of the morphological traits of the analysed species was demonstrated. Plants responded the best to two or four treatments with the silicon solution of a concentration of 120 mg dm-3, with an increase in the values of the analysed morphological traits. The application of silicon did not significantly modify the content of mineral elements in the dry weight of leaves. The application of silicon to Gazania rigens led to an increase in the content of this element in leaves as well as to an elevated chlorophyll content. © 2016, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

Cytokinins are considered as auxin antagonists in adventitious root formation, but their role in this process depends on a number of factors, such as concentration and the phase of treatment. Regardless of their role in rhizogenesis, cytokinins stimulate lateral shoot development. The aim of the experiment was to determine the effect of BA applied in different time of rooting and its cooperation with NAA on Portulaca cuttings and subsequent growth of plants. Stem cuttings of Portulaca umbraticola were treated with BA or BA and NAA in different concentrations and time of BA application (0; 2 and 5 days after placing in medium). BA, administered at the beginning of rooting, negatively influenced percentage of rooted cuttings, while applied two days later stimulated rooting. BA positively determined lateral shoot length and number on cuttings. Application of BA with NAA stimulated root development, but negatively affected the axillary shoot outgrowth. Considering the effect of BA treatment on rooting and branching of Portulaca cuttings the most advantages combinations occurred to be BA applied after 2 days of rooting.\n\nThe effect of silicon foliar application on the development of Season ornamental plants. Part II: Argyranthemum frutescens 'Blazer Rose', Xerochrysum bracteatum 'Gold', Osteospermum ecklonis 'Grande Pink Blush' and Gaura lindheimeri 'Corinas Choice'\n\nDecember 2012\n\n·\n\n333 Reads\n\n·\n\n10 Citations\n\nActa Agrobotanica\n\nKatarzyna Wróblewska\n\n·\n\nRegina Dębicz\n\nRecent research has proved that supplementary application of silicon, involved in plant tolerance against many stress factors, positively influences plant development improving the quality of ornamental plants. A two-factorial experiment involved four cultivars of ornamental plants: Argyranthemum frutescens 'Blazer Rose', Xerochrysum bracteatum 'Gold', Osteospermum ecklonis 'Grande Pink Blush', and Gaura lindheimeri 'Corinas Choice' The first experimental factor was the concentration of Actisil preparation being an equivalent of 60, 120, and 180 mg Si×dm-3, applied three times by spraying, while the second one was the type of medium: peat substrate and peat substrate with sand. Actisil had a beneficial effect on the number of lateral shoots in all plants. The highest number of buds and inflorescences was determined in Xerochrysum and Osteospermum plants sprayed with 0.3% Actisil, and 0.2% Actisil in case of Argyranthemum and Gaura. The effect of medium type on plant growth depended on plant species. Argyranthemum and Osteospermum plants cultivated in the medium with sand showed inhibited growth, although medium type did not affect the growth of Xerochrysum."
