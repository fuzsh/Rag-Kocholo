        "text": "Associated with the Silesian musical circle, Jan Edmund Jurkowski played a significant role in the history of post-war guitar music in Poland. His activity as a teacher, music event organiser and designer of string instruments (as the creator of the eight-string Polish guitar) is widely known, as it has been repeatedly discussed in various publications. What is less common is the knowledge of his creative work, which – while not very prolific (14 preserved compositions and 3 compilations) – occupies a prominent place in the development of Polish guitar literature. The present text offers an insight into his creative legacy, both in terms of pieces intended for the guitar as well as performing ensembles consisting of different instruments, presenting it against the backdrop of other guitar composers working in Poland after the II World War. It demonstrates the importance of his achievements as a composer in the history of Polish guitar music, for he was the first guitarist in Poland to receive formal education in the field of composition.\n\nThe article discusses the notion of Polish music, the possibilities of defining that notion, establishing its scope and listing specific problems related to it. For about 150 years, writers on Polish music have expressed the conviction that it has its own distinctive stylistic and expressive character. Studies concerning the specific qualities of Polish national style after WWII have naturally linked up to Polish music history, mainly that of the 19th century. The new political and cultural situation in Poland after 1989 calls, however, for a change of perspective. We must take into account the present-day cultural situation, in which boundaries are blurred, while supra-national structures and global thinking are beginning to dominate. The paper attempts to define Polish music as a notion in contemporary discourse on history, to examine the resonance of that category, and to point to artistic phenomena which this notion may be said to describe. I will list and analyse the criteria t...\n\nAs we take a look at the history of Polish music, we can see, that the tendencies popular in Western Europe in the beginning of the 20 th century, e.g. impressionism, expressionism or dodecaphony, were developed much more lately. This was mostly because of the political situation in Poland but also because of sentimentalism to the Romantic Era and audience's conservatism. However, there were many excellent examples of the approach to modernism in Polish composers' works. The author of this paper examines two of them. The first one can be seen in a composition by Karol Szymanowski entitled Mity, Op. 30 (1915) for violin and piano, in which the composer created a new musical style-violin impressionism. The second one is seen in a musical piece by Ludomir Michał Rogowski, Caprices (1922?) for viola, soprano or clarinet and piano, in which the composer tried to break the rules of classical harmony by usage of, as he said, \"natural\" scales. The aim of the article is to show a new approach to musical material by the aforementioned composers that is-their way of modernizing Polish music.\n\nAfter the WW2 Poland was included into the Soviet zone of political control. The cultural policy of the communist party was soon to shadow the musical life in Poland. But the first years after 1945 was the time of an enormous activity in recreating-after the war pounding-the structures for musical organisations and building the shapes for musical life in the country. Already in 1945 there were created such institutions as Polish Music Publishers (PWM Edition) and the Polish Composers' Union-both to have a great impact on the artistic musical life for the following decades. Especially the years up to 1948 were of particular importance for creating institutions and for presenting important musical works. But together with tightening the political control, symbolised by imposing the doctrine of socialist realism in music (1949), the situation became much more difficult: composers lost their independence and the country plunged into the cultural isolation which lasted until the political thaw in 1956. The article aims to show the strategies that Polish composers took in the first years after WW2 to create both the organisational frames for their existence, and to compose ambitious and original music. The crucial time of \"sinking into socialist realism\" is presented using selected source materials-mainly the correspondence and speeches by the composer and music critic,\n\nThe article is intended to characterise and summarise the main activities of the Musicological Section of the Polish Composers’ Union. Since the beginning (the addition of the Musicological Section to the Polish Composers’ Union took place offi cially during the 4th General Assembly of the PCU, held between 20 and 22 November 1948 in Warsaw) one of its basic objectives has been to disseminate Polish scholars’ musical research. This objective is constantly pursued through two inter-related main activities, such as conferences and publishing projects. The most important research of Polish musicologists and music theorists is presented at the annual Musicological Conferences of the PCU, organised quite regularly since 1966. There have been 47 such events so far, not counting unnumbered. In the publishing fi eld, the first official journal of the Section was Kwartalnik Muzyczny, revived in 1948–1950, which had an important pre-war tradition. After a long break, its function was taken over by the periodicals launched in 2004— Polski Rocznik Muzykologiczny and Musicology Today. The journals also serve as a platform for the publication of selected conference papers. In addition, the periodicals are to disseminate the results of Polish scholars’ studies in English, which may help to highlight their international relevance.\n\nMany volumes have already been written about the Polishness of Chopin’s music and about his influence on composers of various nationalities active in the Romantic and later periods. In this text the author looks at how Chopin was viewed by 20th-century Polish composers regarding two aspects: 1) how they interpreted his music in the context of its links to Polishness and 2) whether and how they took on his musical concepts in their own oeuvres. This will allow to shed some light on the reception and resonance (to use the terminology of Mieczysław Tomaszewski, a distinguished expert on Chopin and 20th-century Polish music) of the figure and music of Chopin in Polish music of the previous century. There will be examined an extremely patriotic public speech given by Paderewski in 1910, as well as Szymanowski’s opinions from the 1920s. Moreover, the politically driven celebrations of Chopin Year in 1949 will be recalled. The special attention will be put on the musical genres associated ...\n\nThe present article discusses the guitar pieces of the Silesian composer Edward Bogusławski His artistic achievements in the field of classical guitar include only three compositions, which prove that that his treatment of the instrument was very comprehensive; he employed it in composing orchestral music (in the form of Concerto per chitarra e orchestra), chamber music (Trio per flauto, oboe e chitarra) as well as solo pieces (Musica per chitarra solo). I shall also present the importance of Bogusławski s guitar works for the development of Polish guitar literature. Moreover, this article attempts to outline the importance and role of Boguslawski s guitar pieces in the context of the development of Polish guitar music.\n\nIn this article, the author tries to present the issue of blank spots in the history of Polishmusic since 1794 (the world premiere of Cud mniemany, czyli Krakowiacy i Górale [The supposedmirtacle, or Cracovians and highlanders] composed by Jan Stefani to the libretto of Wojciech Bogusławski is regarded as a symbolic beginning of national style in Polish music) up to the end of the SecondWorld War. It was a great period in history when Poland twice did not exist as a state (between1795 and 1918 and between 1939 and 1945).At the beginning the attention is drawn to the Polish music in the nineteenth century. Author describes new discoveries such as the Second Piano Quintet in E flat Major (with double bassinstead of second cello) by Józef Nowakowski (Chopin’s friend), and String Quartets op. 1 and monumentaloratorio Passio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi by Józef Elsner who was Chopin’s teacher in the Conservatory of Music in Warsaw (Elsner’s Passio discovered at the end of the twentieth ce...\n\nDescriptive instrumental works composed in nineteenth-century Poland do not easily fit classification as consumer music, as they fulfilled important patriotic and commemorative functions. While these pieces, like descriptive works composed elsewhere, employ topical gestures and melodic quotations, in the Polish works, patriotic songs are used intertextually to construct coherent historical or allegorical narratives of the nation through music. In Jankiel’s “Concert of Concerts,” an excerpt from the epic poem Pan Tadeusz, the poet Adam Mickiewicz describes a performance of such musical narrative of events in Polish history. Thus Mickiewicz apotheosized the then-popular descriptive pieces and inspired future compositions in the same genre. These pieces cross generic boundaries and interact in unexpected ways with the canonic repertory, offering insights into compositional techniques and strategies used by composers such as Fryderyk Chopin and illuminating modes of listening familiar to their audiences.narrative of events in Polish history.

These pieces cross generic boundaries and interact in unexpected ways with the canonic repertory, offering insights into compositional techniques and strategies used by composers such as Fryderyk Chopin and illuminating modes of listening familiar to their audiences.\n\nAdam Mickiewicz’s 1834 epic poem in twelve books Pan Tadeusz culminates formally in a great musical ekphrasis (XII, 619-767). Jankiel, the Jewish cymbalom virtuoso, acts as the bard’s alter-ego in narrating through the highly expressive sounds of his improvisation; this very feature — narrativization of pure musical structure — becomes conversely a powerful means of musicalization of narration. Subtle phenomenology of the experience of musical sound, in its aesthetic and collective aspects, is entwined with contextual understanding of the music’s subversive political messages. By showing the workings of this complex strategy of cross sense-investment I hope to shed some new light on Mickiewicz’s intermedial achievement, which goes far beyond the clichéd Romantic musicophilia or acritical programmatic attitude."
