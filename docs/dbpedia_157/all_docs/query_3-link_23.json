        "text": "Cuca Roseta is one of the most revered and respected fado voices.\n\nThe fado singer, who has released seven albums signed by some of the world's most prestigious producers, has enjoyed artistic success all over the globe to great acclaim from the media and the public. The upcoming International Women's Day is a perfect opportunity to take a woman close to your heart to a top-notch concert. Women's fado in excellent company, Cuca Roseta will be the main star on the stage!\n\nHer debut album was produced by Gustavo Santaolalla, a prestigious producer and holder of several Grammy and Oscar awards. Never before had anyone among fado singers achieved so much credibility and attracted the interest of a producer of such fame.\n\nCuca Roseta was the first to succeed. The success of her album, of the same name, was so great that it quickly made her one of the most important fado singers of modern times. After Gustavo Santaolalla, Nelson Motta, a prominent Brazilian producer, also succumbed to Cuca Roseta's talent and produced Riu's album, which revolutionized her career, crossing her singing with artists such as Bryan Adams, Jorge Drexler, Ivan Lins and many others.\n\nCuca Roseta has performed on most important stages in more than 40 countries around the world. During her career, she has shared musical moments with Julio Iglesias, Djavan David Bisbal and many others. Cuca Roseta has also had the honor of being the only artist to sing for Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, and has been invited to sing for the monarchs of Spain in both Portugal and Madrid, as well as the monarchs of Sweden.\n\nMore recently, Cuca Roseta has confirmed her artistry to a wider audience by presenting a remarkable work: an album in tribute to Amália Rodrigues, Amália por Cuca Roseta, which received great critical acclaim.\n\nCuca Roseta is much more than a voice. She is unique and has a brilliant, distinctive way of singing that makes us hold our breath. Cuca takes us on an intense and fascinating journey into the soul. Cuca Roseta is a surprising and dazzling fado voice in its purest form. A fado with all the truth it should have and that necessarily deserves to be heard.\n\nCuca Roseta is at the same time one of the juror in the television program Got Talent Portugal, which promotes and highlights the artistic and musical talents of her native country.\n\nThe concert at the NOSPR in Katowice is a must-see for all music lovers, not only those who appreciate fado in particular. We recommend and invite you to attend."
