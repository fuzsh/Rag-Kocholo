        "text": "Sustainability emphasises the importance of increasing the resource efficiency of infrastructure. The usage of geosynthetic materials in civil and environmental engineering can significantly influence sustainability at the planning and design stages of infrastructure construction projects. They are used in many different applications in construction and environmental engineering, as they provide a better and longer performance and less costly solutions than traditional materials (such as sand, gravel, concrete and cement). Additional benefits can be achieved by combining geosynthetics with various recycled materials as substitutes for high-quality natural materials. In this paper, the importance of sustainability in geosynthetics-based solutions is discussed. The possibilities of using geosynthetics in sustainable development have been analysed and the benefits resulting from their application, such as the reduction in carbon footprint and release of greenhouse gases and saving water and other natural resources, have been assessed. Innovative solutions that support mitigation measures, adaptation to climate change and achievement of sustainable development goals have been presented.\n\nIn recent years, a dynamic increase in environmental pollution with textile waste has been observed. Natural textile waste has great potential for environmental applications. This work identifies potential ways of sustainably managing natural textile waste, which is problematic waste from sheep farming or the cultivation of fibrous plants. On the basis of textile waste, an innovative technology was developed to support water saving and plant vegetation- biodegradable water-absorbing geocomposites (BioWAGs). The major objective of this study was to determine BioWAG effectiveness under field conditions. The paper analyses the effect of BioWAGs on the increments in fresh and dry matter, the development of the root system, and the relative water content (RWC) of selected grass species. The conducted research confirmed the high efficiency of the developed technology. The BioWAGs increased the fresh mass of grass shoots by 230-420% and the root system by 130-200% compared with the control group. The study proved that BioWAGs are a highly effective technology that supports plant vegetation and saves water. Thanks to the reuse of waste materials, the developed technology is compatible with the assumptions of the circular economy and the goals of sustainable development.\n\nAdopting environmentally friendly or green technology and incorporating new alternative substrates for a sustainable agricultural industry has garnered the attention of numerous researchers. Although super absorbent hydrogels have exhibited great potential, natural hydrogel-based absorbents have gained more interest due to their environmentally safe properties. The sources for the novel green polymer are easily obtained from agricultural wastes, such as polysaccharides, agarose, chitosan, and mucilage, with zero to minimal cost. The polymer also offers several attributes, including water usage and cost efficiencies, versatile application, and increasing plant growth. Furthermore, the polymer can act as a carrier agent and aid in improving the properties of planting mediums. The present review focuses on natural and chemical hydrogel-based polymers. It discusses their potential application in sustainable agriculture and the conservation of ecosystems by providing balanced protection for seeds, plants, and soil. Future perspectives based on previous investigations are also presented.\n\nSoil amendments are substances added to the soil for moisture increment or physicochemical soil process enhancement. This study aimed to assess the water conservation efficiency of available organic soil amendments like bentonite, attapulgite, biochar and inorganics like superabsorbent polymer, and nonwoven geotextile in relation to the newly developed water absorbing geocomposite (WAG) and its biodegradable version (bioWAG). Soil amendments were mixed with loamy sand soil, placed in 7.5 dm3 pots, then watered and dried in controlled laboratory conditions during 22-day long drying cycles (pot experiment). Soil moisture was recorded in three locations, and matric potential was recorded in one location during the drying process. The conducted research has confirmed that the addition of any examined soil amendment in the amount of 0.7% increased soil moisture, compared to control, depending on measurement depth in the soil profile and evaporation stage. The application of WAG as a soil amendment resulted in higher soil moisture in the centre and bottom layers, by 5.4 percent point (p.p.) and 6.4 p.p. on day 4 and by 4.5 p.p. and 8.8 p.p. on day 7, respectively, relative to the control samples. Additionally, an experiment in a pressure plate extractor was conducted to ensure the reliability of the obtained results. Soil density and porosity were also recorded. Samples containing WAG had water holding capacity at a value of −10 kPa higher than samples with biochar, attapulgite, bentonite, bioWAG and control by 3.6, 2.1, 5.7, 1 and 4.5 percentage points, respectively. Only samples containing superabsorbent polymers and samples with nonwoven geotextiles had water holding capacity at a value of −10 kPa higher than WAG, by 14.3 and 0.1 percentage points, respectively. Significant changes were noted in samples amended with superabsorbent polymers resulting in a 90% soil sample porosity and bulk density decrease from 1.70 g∙cm−3 to 1.14 g∙cm−3. It was thus concluded that the water absorbing geocomposite is an advanced and most efficient solution for water retention in soil.\n\nDue to the growing awareness and the need to reduce the environmental impact of textiles, there is a pressing rationale to use natural materials or fibres in environmental engineering. One solution to achieve energy sustainability is to develop sustainable technologies to gradually replace non-renewable fossil fuels. One of technology is water-absorbing geocomposite (WAG). WAG is an innovative technology that supports water management and the vegetation of plants and is used, among others, in environmental engineering and agriculture. WAG can be produced in biodegradable WAG version, which is also environmentally friendly. The paper provides an evaluation of the influence of time of installation and biodegradation on the mechanical, hydraulic, and chemical properties of used textiles. The biodegradation of geotextiles was analyzed in real time, and their parameters were determined after one vegetation season. Needle-punched nonwovens made from wool and linen or reinforced by jute mesh were biodegraded already after the first vegetation season. Significantly better mechanical properties were observed in nonwovens produced from the same materials, but reinforced by seams. All types of geotextiles were characterised by sufficient resistance to biodegradation that allowed maintaining vegetation and proper operation of WAG at least for one vegetation season. Biodegradable geotextiles installed in soil provide instantaneous protection, and their gradual discomposure fosters plant vegetation.\n\nSuperabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are used in agriculture and environmental engineering to increase soil water retention. Under such conditions, the swelling pressure of the SAP in soil affects water absorption by SAP, and soil structure. The paper presents the results of swelling pressure of three cross-linked copolymers of acrylamide and potassium acrylate mixed at the ratios of 0.3%, 0.5% and 1.0% with coarse sand and loamy sand. The highest values of swelling pressure were obtained for the 1% proportion, for coarse sand (79.53 kPa) and loamy sand (78.23 kPa). The time required to reach 90% of swelling pressure for each type of SAP differs. Samples of coarse sand mixed with SAP K2 in all concentrations reached 90% of total swelling pressure in 100 min, while the loamy sand mixtures needed only about 60 min. The results were the basis for developing a model for swelling pressure of the superabsorbent and soil mixtures, which is a fully stochastic model. The conducted research demonstrated that the course of pressure increase depends on the available pore capacity and the grain size distribution of SAPs. The obtained results and the proposed model may be applied everywhere where mixtures of SAPs and soils are used to improve plant vegetation conditions.\n\nClimate change induces droughts that are becoming more intensive and more frequent than ever before. Most of the available forecast tools predict a further significant increase in the risk of drought, which indicates the need to prepare solutions to mitigate its effects. Growing water scarcity is now one of the world's leading challenges. In agriculture and environmental engineering, in order to increase soil water retention, soil additives are used. In this study, the influence of a newly developed water absorbing geocomposite (WAG) on soil water retention and soil matric potential was analyzed. WAG is a special element made from geotextile which is wrapped around a synthetic skeleton with a superabsorbent polymer placed inside. To describe WAG's influence on soil water retention and soil matric potential, coarse sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam soils were used. WAG in the form of a mat was used in the study as a treatment. Three kinds of samples were prepared for every soil type. Control samples and samples with WAG treatment placed at depths of 10 cm and 20 cm were examined in a test container of 105 × 70 × 50 cm dimensions. The samples had been watered and drained, and afterwards, the soil surface was heated by lamps of 1100 W total power constantly for 72 h. Soil matric potential was measured by Irrometer field tensiometers at three depths. Soil moisture content was recorded at six depths: of 5, 9, 15, 19, 25, and 30 cm under the top of the soil surface with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurement devices. The values of soil moisture content and soil matric potential were collected in one-minute steps, and analyzed in 24-h-long time steps: 24, 48, and 72 h. The samples with the WAG treatment lost more water than the control samples. Similarly, lower soil matric potential was noted in the samples with the WAG than in the control samples. However, after taking into account the water retained in the WAG, it appeared that the samples with the WAG had more water easily available for plants than the control samples. It was found that the mechanism of a capillary barrier affected higher water loss from soil layers above those where the WAG had been placed. The obtained results of water loss depend on the soil type used in the profile."
