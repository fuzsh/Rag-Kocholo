        "text": "Over 40 years ago, MTV ushered in a new era of music consumption with the release of The Buggle's hit song, \"Video Killed the Radio Star\". With major shifts in the investment environment, we think #privateequity is facing its own MTV moment. Learn more below about how #LPs should assess their portfolios' positioning and the previously overlooked options that they may need to consider. #3DReset https://okt.to/OKzLNB\n\n#Drake is challenging rappers to showcase their skills over instrumentals from #ScaryHours3ðŸ‘€ - Releasing an instrumental album, like Drake's 'Scary Hours 3,' is a smart move both financially and culturally. It's set to boost streaming revenue, with instrumental tracks appealing to a wider audience, especially younger creatives. This not only keeps the album relevant for various uses, from content creation to background music, but also shows that Drake is always finding new ways to keep fans interested and attract new ones. - Drake's lasting success in music isn't just about talent; it's about his calculated business/cultural moves. This reinforces that he's in it for the long haul and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. ðŸ“Š - #popculture #personalbranding #musicbusiness #hiphopculture #businessstrategy\n\nHave you noticed the emerging trend of artists delaying their streaming release dates and opting to release LPs and CDs first? This approach isn't limited to small, DIY artistsâ€”even major artists are adopting this strategy and seeing substantial financial gains. This shift is so significant that Billboard recently covered it, prompting Disc Makers CEO Tony van Veen to explore the topic in todayâ€™s video. He discusses: â€¢ The rationale behind delaying digital releases in favor of physical products â€¢ Seven key benefits for artists and their fans â€¢ The evolving landscape of album release strategies â€¢ Best practices for optimizing your LP/CD/streaming release schedule If youâ€™re looking to maximize the impact of your next album release, this video is a must-watch. https://lnkd.in/emsB9Tny #indiemusic #musicbusiness #musiclife #indiemusician #musicbiz #discmakers #spotify #newrelease\n\nEverybody knows how little artists get paid from streaming. The major chunk of revenue for an artist is currently coming from live shows. However, live performance is not an easy job either; it involves a lot of effort, expenses, and arrangements. Studies show that almost 15% to 20% of any artist's fans are willing to pay for exclusive content such as pre-releases, unreleased songs, BTS footage, private parties, and more. We call them superfans. That's where FanFliQ comes into play. FanFliQ connects artists and fans in a very unique way. It's time to go direct: artists, fans, and FanFliQ. I am talking to a lot of artists, management companies, and labels. Would love to connect! Let's shake up the industry! #fanfliq #music #musicians #artists #label #musiclabel #musicindustry #artistmanagement\n\nI sometimes hear people talk about how streaming services like Spotify are unfair to artists. The main argument is that they don't pay enough. To supplement this argument occasionally you hear people speak about the yesteryears of selling physical albums. Let's be pragmatic. The days of standing outside Best Buy or a record store to get an album are over. We have a generation of muscians who are turning of age whom don't have the experience of buying a physical album. In my opinion our focus is how can we make revenue for our music brands. There are thousands of ways. Why are we stuck in the past? Why are we spending so much energy on something that benefits less than 1% of muscians monetarily in streaming? I'd like to have a discussion. Chime in with your thoughts in the comments. #musicbusiness #musicstreaming #musicindustry #muscians #musicislife\n\n#djs and #producers have to monetize through having a direct relationship with their audience. Iâ€™m talking about the 1000 true fans approach. Or even better the 100 true fans approach! We need to adopt the practices of the gaming industry. Use your music, remixes, mashups as the bait to start to capture a wide audience. And from there you need to segment your audience into casual listeners, regular fans and super fans. Your music is no longer the golden ticket! Itâ€™s the bait to reel people in. What else are you offering to your fans and super fans that want to support you as a creator? You can offer exclusive merchandise, experiences, or even behind the scenes content that the causal listener will not have access to unless they want to (& thatâ€™s where the money resides). The super fan needs to see that value and as a creator you have to provide that value. Itâ€™s more than the music. Itâ€™s about how you market your entire brand as a #creator, #artist , #musician, #dj or #producer.\n\nI sometimes hear people talk about how streaming services like Spotify are unfair to artists.

The days of radio play and music videos on television leading audiences to new music, movies, and shows have been replaced by social media, streaming services, and independent creators. While the entertainment industry has gone through some of its biggest challenges in the past decade, artists and creators continue to create. And if popularity on MTV isnâ€™t the avenue for more success and attention, then the artist will find another way to be seen and heard. Al Shipley and Andrew Unterberger have compiled a list for Billboard of the 20 hottest shows for music syncs right now. The list provides a wide variety of show genres, different networks and streamers, and an eclectic mix of music. Tunespotter is continually expanding our library of the best music sync moments from the most popular shows, as well as movies, commercials, games, and more. What is your favorite music sync moment from this list of shows? #search #discovery #movies #television #music #tvmusic #filmmusic #socialmedia"
