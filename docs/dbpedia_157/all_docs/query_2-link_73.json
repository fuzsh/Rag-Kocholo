Traced Overhead\n\nThomas Ad√®s was born in London in 1971. Renowned as both composer and performer, he works regularly with the world‚Äôs leading orchestras, opera companies and festivals.\n\nHis compositions include three operas : the most recent of which The Exterminating Angel premiered at the 2016 Salzburg Festival and subsequently has been performed at the Metropolitan Opera, New York and the Royal Opera House, London all conducted by the composer\n\nThis modern impressionist piece takes its meaning and relevance from the title. There was a most remarkable variety of dynamics and articulation as well as many colors and textures in the piece. Much musically pregnant use of silence as a block of sound\n\nFranz Schubert (1797‚Äí1828)\n\nPiano sonata in E flat major, D. 568 (1825)\n\nAllegro moderato\n\nKholodenko gave the work a soft and expressively tender opening. The L√§ndler dances were charming, a lively Austrian folk dance form predominantly performed by couples. Kholodenko always plays in a manner full of musical meaning. Here we were given the strong Viennese sense of early nineteenth century colour, elegance and refinement. A great deal of detail was perceived and revealed in this interpretation with Schubertian songs everywhere!\n\nAndante molto\n\nA gently reflective movement played piano by Kholodenko True musical speech emerged through the careful and eloquent phrasing by the pianist. There was philosophical depth present here in abundance.\n\nMenuetto: Allegretto -Trio\n\nAgain we experienced a charming Viennese flavour to this music as if visiting charming and civilised Demel patisserie and traditional coffee house with a cultured friend, a cultural and culinary institution since 1786. Kholodenko gave us charming affectation without deep philosophy yet retaining much grace and refinement.\n\nAllegro moderato\n\nThe Allegro moderato opening was replete with childish simplicity. So innocent in expression with a few drifting clouds hinting at mortality. Charming melodies expressed by Kholodenko with poetic elegance and poignant emotion. The rural refinement gave one the impression of a pastoral excursion in the Vienna woods accompanied by the Schubertian soul.\n\nI found the sonata an affecting understated performance, that of a sensitive artist with all the modest gestures of integrity and truth one might expect from a great musician.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFranz Schubert (1797‚Äí1828) Drei Klavierst√ºcke (3 Pieces for the piano) D.946 (1828)\n\nSchubert did not arrange these late works as a set. This was done by Brahms in 1868. These intimate works are revelations of the state of Schubert's soul from the last year of his life (1828). They are lyrical pieces where the expressiveness has been extremely concentrated.\n\nI felt Kholodenko in the E flat minor - Allegro assai gave us what can only be described as 'perfect Schubert' as the turbulence was expressively offset by extended song-like lyricism. He approached them all as an affirmation of life and the energy, transparent and polyphonic.\n\nIn No. 2 in E flat major again his dynamic balance was deeply expressive. The work was lyrical and full of expressive content, the opening theme reminiscent of a Venetian barcarolle. His awareness of Schubert songs is evident throughout. The emotional disturbance, the perturbation created within the piece and the listener's heart was seriously threatening in character. His eloquent phrasing and sense of structure highlighted Schubert 's tempestuously fluctuating emotional life as his final hour approached.\n\nThe blithe C major Allegro third piece was lively and cheerful in character, somewhat Bohemian, a wanderer in a landscape of mercurial moods. A section of curious immobility is enclosed in the work in a period of static and repetitive rhythm..\n\nCarl Vine (ur. 1954 r.) Sonata No. 1\n\nVine is an Australian composer of contemporary classical music. Of great interest to me, as a teenager, he was fascinated with the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen which inspired a period of Modernism, which he explored until the mid-1980s. I also became deeply involved with this music in my early twenties travelling to the Stockhausen New Music Courses in K√∂ln in 1968.\n\nFrom 1975 he has worked as a freelance pianist and composer with a variety of theatre and dance companies, and ensembles. Vine's catalogue includes eight symphonies, twelve concertos, music for film, television and theatre, electronic music and numerous chamber works. From 2000 until 2019 Vine was the Artistic Director of the eminent chamber presenter Musica Viva Australia. Within that role he was also Artistic Director of the Huntington Estate Music Festival from 2006, and of the Musica Viva Festival (Sydney) from 2008.\n\nIn 2005 he was awarded the Don Banks Music Award. In the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours List, Vine was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), \"for distinguished service to the performing arts as a composer, conductor, academic and artistic director, and to the support and mentoring of emerging performers.\" Vine currently lectures in composition and orchestration at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.\n\nThis work had remarkable rhythm and the sheer texture of the staccato sound was arresting. The work is extraordinarily demanding of the virtuosity of the performer. Kholodenko dominated the work with his transcendental keyboard technique. At times the sound he extracted from the composition and piano sounded like electronic music in the left hand rather conventional cascades of notes. Demanding on the listener !\n\nThe minimalist Bagatelle by the Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov that the great artist Vadym Kholodenko played as an appropriate encore, given the current murderous days, could not have made a greater contrast.\n\nFRIDAY, 12 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 4.00 PM\n\nPiano recital\n\nALIM BEISEMBAYEV First Prize at the Leeds International Piano Competition in 2021\n\nJoseph Haydn (1732‚Äì1809)\n\nVariations in F minor \"Un piccolo divertimento\", Hob. XVII:6 (1793)\n\nHe brought to the work a fine tone reminiscent of a string of pearls displayed on a fashionable aristocratic neck in a Viennese salon. His command of the classical style was so pure it gave me such refined pleasure. I really cannot imagine a finer performance of this work.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770‚Äì1827)\n\nPiano sonata, Op. 111 (1821‚Äì1822)\n\nMaestoso ‚Äì Allegro con brio ed appasionato\n\nArietta: Adagio molto semplice cantabile\n\nThe Maestoso - Allegro can brio ed appassionato was grand in scale and rather over emotional in declamation I felt. I prefer are more introverted and philosophical Beethoven at a less virtuosic tempo. I conceive this movement as noble in stance and tempo. E.T.A. Hoffmann refers to this exploration as the monumental in Beethoven, a composer who 'carves his essential being from the inner kingdom of tones, and reigns over it as its absolute ruler.'\n\n'Here it comes!' as Wendell Kretchmar excitedly exclaims at the beginning of his lecture on the sonata in Thomas Mann's Dr. Faustus. In the Arietta ‚Äì Adagio molto semplice e cantabile Beethoven achieves immense significance from the slenderest of means, an innocent fragment perhaps taken from a trite waltz by Diabelli is transformed. The innocence of its life is transfigured by a multitude of vicissitudes and variations into a sweeping chiaroscuro painting, a landscape of human spiritual aspiration and at times physical existence, revealed from beneath the mysterious veil of reality that cloaks us all. As magical a musical prefiguring and revelation as the appearance of the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' was for the victory of Napoleon at the Battle of the Three Emperors in 1805. There was a marvellous sense of fatal inevitability in the conclusion with heavenly long trills metaphysical in character - as a whole it made a magnificent impact. A brief celestial flight of the soul followed as if released from the shackles of existence.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äí1849)\n\n24 Preludes, Op. 28 (1938‚Äì1839)\n\nNo. 1 in C major No. 2 in A minor No. 3 in G major No. 4 in E minor No. 5 in D major No. 6 in B minor No. 7 in A major No. 8 in F sharp minor No. 9 in E major No. 10 in C sharp minor No. 11 in B major No. 12 in G sharp minor No. 13 in F sharp major No. 14 in E flat minor No. 15 in D flat major No. 16 in B flat minor No. 17 in A flat major No. 18 in F minor No. 19 in E flat major No. 20 in C minor No. 21 in B flat major No. 22 in G minor No. 23 in F major No. 24 in D minor\n\nI cannot in this limited space appraise each prelude save to say Beisembayev has a personal voice of a superb pianist, a virtuoso performance of a set that Chopin would never have considered performing as a whole. Each prelude, however brief, seems to me to contain entire universe of reference and life experience in essence.\n\nAn excellent Scarlatti sonata with great style and panache. A rather too much impactful La Chasse by Liszt in the created refinement of this musical environment. His technique in evoking snow flurries was breathtaking.\n\nWisdom from the Vanessa Latarche Masterclasses\n\nThis renowned pedagogue and pianist is Head of Keyboard and Fellow of the Royal College of Music in London. This is in addition to her illustrious concert career, possession of many international awards and valued jury service on many piano competitions of world importance. Her pupils have won renowned piano competitions including Alim Beisembayev who was awarded First Prize at the Leeds 2021 Competition.\n\n'Embrace the Piano' Vanessa Latarche\n\nWorking on the Brahms Variations on a Theme of Paganini Op.35 Book 1 with Julia ≈Åozowska\n\nI made some short notes during this class so please read them in this way and not as an academic exegesis. I would like to cover all the Masterclasses in detail but time does not permit this. The participants all play at an extremely high level of musical and pianistic accomplishment which is recognized by both the audience and professors.\n\nVanessa made the point to Julia that it was better physically to practice early in the day. One is bright and physically aware in the morning. One is more emotionally aware in the evening. A most interesting observation.\n\nShe felt each variation should be distinct in its character and the pianist should communicate a feeling of capriciousness and light touch which increases the fascination for the audience. She felt the shape of a musical phrase should be reflected in the shape of the hand and that the pianist should not bend deeply over the keyboard but sit back\n\nConcerning trills, they should be played in sections and not one long homogeneous trill. In order to highlight the different voices in polyphony, variation in voice dynamics is effective. Communicate a sense of confidence which is achieved through textual security.\n\nHold the reins and take charge! Support your body posture and remain under control. Physically, playing the piano makes demands on the legs so use and develop your core strength. Don't waste energy in creating facial grimaces.\n\nIf you make an error simply move on - it is already in the past!\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nVanessa Latarche and Krzyrztof Wierci≈Ñski working on the Chopin Nocturne in B major Op.62 No.1 and the Chopin Scherzo in B flat minor Op.31\n\nIn musical performance 'go inside the work' and do not simply think 'on top'\n\nIn this session there was much discussion of the use of the pedal. A great deal of sensitive feeling comes through the foot. She felt that the performance of the Nocturne was 'too private' and that we as listeners were 'not allowed in'. She felt the performance should be far more open and fresh without 'secrets'. I found this a fascinating observation.\n\nWe then moved onto tone production which is so important in creating the atmosphere that surrounds a Chopin Nocturne. The centre of the tone is vital in the creation of a golden tone. Connected to this she then examined the ambiguity of the voicing of some Chopin pedal markings on a modern as opposed to a period instrument. Voicing or pedal change ?\n\nShe felt that playing with a singer was most beneficial for pianists as they must offer the singer detailed support.\n\nConcerning the Scherzo, she observed that the notes of any musical work 'need to lift off the page'. The opening triplet as an existential, even diabolical question. At the time of composition this work must have been deeply shocking and revolutionary. Frederick Niecks quotes Robert Schumann who wrote of the Chopin Scherzos (the Italian word scherzo meaning 'joke') 'How is 'gravity' to clothe itself if 'jest' goes about in dark veils?'. She advised utilizing a degree of capriciousness to create the emotional ambiguity often present at the centre of Chopin's energetic despair. Think horizontally not vertically and harmonically in cantabile and chorale sections.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nVanessa Latarche working with Filip Michalak on the\n\nSchumann Sonata No. 1 in F sharp minor Op.11\n\nVanessa Latarche examined the first movement of the Schumann F sharp minor Sonata Op.11 in this Masterclass. She began by telling us that the sonata was based on the nature of love. Schumann told his wife Clara that in light of their cruel enforced separation, the sonata was 'a solitary outcry for you from my heart ... in which your theme appears in every possible shape'. He published it anonymously as 'Pianoforte Sonata, dedicated to Clara by Florestan and Eusebius'.\n\nThe first movement is marked: Un poco adagio - Allegro vivace. She told us the story behind the sonata as she considers the personal, historical and cultural context of musical works vital to the fullest understanding and interpretation of them. Piano pedagogues and professors all differ in their approach to the same piece, emphasizing simply technical aspects, sound production or visualizing extra-musical associations which are also so important to complete penetration and understanding. She indicated the intertwining of 'Clara's theme' within the musical fabric. 'Never drop onto a note before you are ready' she advised.\n\nShe felt the opening does not immediately proclaim 'this is a sonata' but is an introduction which opened new 'romantic' expressive territory for the composer. She emphasized the two voices of the LH and RH contained within the dramatic and passionate opening theme. She felt that the pianist must know exactly what is in the score and to maintain control of the different voices and their utterance. 'Listen to yourself'.\n\nVanessa also felt that an enhanced sense of colour was of great importance for the different voices and delineation of the characters of Florestan and Eusebius - the variation in colour was vital to the creation of an expressive sound texture. She felt that Filip too often said the same thing in the same way. He was reminded 'to play with taste'. She felt he could have made more of the embedded polyphony which of course came from Schumann's adoration of Bach. She also highlighted the 'slight craziness' of Schumann and his whimsical, mercurially changing nature.\n\nThe second movement of the sonata Aria: Senza passione ma espressivo was lamentably only just begun in this class due to time constraints. Vanessa explained that the movement expressed a different and far deeper view of love. The love of Eusebius - the other more alluring aspect of our doppelg√§nger composer. The touch should be increasingly refined to match the tenderness and yearning contained in this movement.\n\nThis Masterclass I attended by Vanessa Latarche was a revelation in so many ways, a class that 'opened the doors of perception'. Such an engaging, encouraging, deeply musical, enthusiastic and affectionate personality one meets so rarely in life. How fortunate to be a pupil of hers and have her as a musical guide!\n\nTHURSDAY, 11 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 8.00 PM\n\nChamber concert\n\nMARCIN ZDUNIK (cello) ALEKSANDER DƒòBICZ (piano)\n\nI\n\nJan Sebastian Bach (1685‚Äí1750)\n\nChorale preludes and improvisations\n\n1. Improvisation 1\n\n2. Von Gott will ich nicht lassen, BWV 658\n\n3. Improvisation 2\n\n4. O Lamm Gottes unschuldig, BWV 656\n\n5. Improvisation 3\n\n6. Nun komm der Heiden Heiland, BWV 659\n\n7. Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend, BWV 665\n\n8. Improvisation 4\n\n9. Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 645\n\nArranged by Marcin Zdunik and Aleksander Dƒôbicz\n\nThese improvisations were especially interesting intellectually rather than significantly musically uplifting and inspiring. However hearing such familiar vocal Bach works transcribed for instrumental performance was a rare and rewarding experience and another lesson in Bach's extraordinary genius and universality\n\nII\n\nMarcin ZDUNIK (b. 1987) / Aleksander DƒòBICZ (b. 1988)\n\nImprovised sonata, Op. 0, No. 0\n\nI felt that the pianist Dƒôbicz could have been slightly more subtle as an instrumentalist, although the cellist Zdunik is clearly an outstanding musician. This work was based on a traditional four movement sonata. The melodies were attractive rather than the harmonic transitions and invention. The final movement was attractively lively. So far the most successful of the improvisations. However I could not help asking myself what was the musical direction and what were the instrumentalists saying with these improvisations, apart from their intrinsic musical interest as variations on familiar material.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nIII\n\nMarcin ZDUNIK / Aleksander DƒòBICZ\n\n4 Intermezzi\n\n1. Der Lachs\n\nA pleasant, entirely traditionally harmonic composition\n\n2. Clara\n\nA delightful, rather light salon piece but none the worse for that...\n\n3. Mathilde\n\nA charming musical portrait\n\n4. Sp√≥≈∫niony Pierrot\n\nA sad clown ?\n\nThese were all purely traditional harmonic compositions of significant lyrical beauty.\n\nThe Chopin Manor at Duszniki\n\nIV\n\nImpromptu. Chopin Improvised\n\n1. Prelude in C major, Op. 28 No. 1\n\n2. Nocturne in F minor, Op. 55 No. 1\n\n3. Nocturne in B major, Op. 9 No. 3\n\n4. Prelude in G sharp minor, Op. 28 No. 12\n\n5. Nocturne in F major, Op. 15 No. 1\n\n6. Mazurek in A minor, Op. 17 No. 4\n\n7. Mazurek in D major, Op. 33 No. 2\n\nThere were some tasteful improvisations here even with bucolic humour at times (the Nocturne in B major). The Prelude in G sharp minor was agitated and certainly virtuosic. The Nocturne in F major rather attractively elegiac with a feeling of 'jazzy' Chopin. The Mazurka in A minor was rather lugubrious in its opening. I found some difficulty in tracing the Chopin at the heart of it.\n\nBoth are clearly fine improvisatory musicians. The Mazurka in D major revealed Zdunik to be musically and inventively brilliant in addition to being virtuosic in his remarkable execution. This work was most lively with a true folkloric character.\n\nThey were rather wildly received and applauded which surprised me. Perhaps I am missing something!\n\nAs a first encore, a jazz fine improvisation on a rather melancholic theme from Porgy and Bess and the second encore to conclude, was an up tempo, impressive jazz improvisation but I am not sure what this piece was...\n\nTHURSDAY, 11 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 4.00 PM\n\nPiano recital\n\nKYOHEI SORITA\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äí1849)\n\nRondo √† la Mazur, Op. 5 (1825‚Äì1826)\n\nMazurka de Chopin (1911) Edward Oku≈Ñ (1872-1945)\n\nThis piece was written when Chopin was 16. He dedicated it to the Countess Alexandrine de Moriolles, the daughter of the Comte de Moriolles, who was the tutor to the adopted son of the Grand Duke Constantine, Governor of Warsaw. This rather unpleasant individual often requested Chopin to play for him at the Belvedere Palace. Unable to sleep, on winter nights he would ostentatiously send a sleigh drawn by four-horses harnessed abreast in the Russian style to collect the young pianist from his home. Schumann first heard the Rondo √† la mazur in 1836, and he called it 'lovely, enthusiastic and full of grace. He who does not yet know Chopin had best begin the acquaintance with this piece'.\n\nSorita gave this a charming rendition but slightly lacking in period feel and affectation. I tended to feel the presence of learned, rather conventional emotional expressive gestures rather than spontaneous reactions to the musical context. There is charm, style, √©lan and panache in this work which could be brought to the fore with a light touch to create le climat de Chopin. Here we have as a young, carefree, Polish adolescent with character and personality plus, wit, humour, theatrics - a young man striving to please with his massively precocious talent.\n\n3 Mazurkas, Op. 56 (1843‚Äì1844) in B major in C major in C minor\n\nThe mazurka is the quintessential expression of the Polish national and ethnic identity. Any approach to them is bound to cause comment, sometimes dismissive, sometimes abrasive but never indifferent or detached. One should examine the nature of dancing in Warsaw during the time of Chopin. Almost half of his music is actually dance music of one sort or another and a large proportion of the rest of his compositions contain dances.\n\nDancing was a passion especially during carnival from Epiphany to Ash Wednesday. It was an opulent time, generating a great deal of commercial business, no less than in Vienna or Paris. Dancing - waltzes, polonaises, mazurkas - were a vital part of Warsaw social life, closely woven into the fabric of the city. There was veritable 'Mazurka Fever' in Europe and Russia at this time. The dancers were not restricted to noble families - the intelligentsia and bourgeoisie also took part in the passion.\n\nChopin's experience of dance, as a refined gentleman of exquisite manners, would have been predominantly urban ballroom dancing with some experience of peasant hijinks during his summer holidays in ≈ªelazowa Wola, Szafania and elsewhere. Poland was mainly an agricultural society in the early nineteenth century. At this time Warsaw was an extraordinary melange of cultures. Magnificent magnate palaces shared muddy unpaved streets with dilapidated townhouses, szlachta farms, filthy hovels and teeming markets. By 1812 the Napoleonic campaigns had financially crippled the Duchy of Warsaw. Chopin spent his formative years during this turbulent political period and the family often escaped the capital to the refuge of the Mazovian countryside at ≈ªelazowa Wola. Here the fields are alive with birdsong, butterflies and wildflowers. On summer nights the piano was placed in the garden and Chopin would improvise eloquent melodies that floated through the orchards and across the river to the listening villagers gathered beyond.\n\nOf course he was a perfect mimic, actor, practical joker and enthusiastic dancer as a young man, tremendously high-spirited. He once wrote a verse describing how he spent a wild night, half of which was dancing and the other half playing pranks and dances on the piano for his friends. They had great fun! One of his friends took to the floor pretending to be a sheep! On one occasion he even sprained his ankle he was dancing so vigorously! He would play with gusto and 'start thundering out mazurkas, waltzes and polkas'. When tired and wanting to dance, he would pass the piano over to 'a humbler replacement'. Is it surprising his teacher J√≥zef Elzner and his doctors advised a period of 'rehab' at Duszniki Zdr√≥j to preserve his health which had already begun to show the first signs of failing? This advice may not have been the best for him or his sister Emilia and Ludwika Skarbek, as reinfection was always a strong possibility there. Both were dead not long after their return from the so-called 'cure'.\n\nMany of his mazurkas would have come to life on the dance floor as improvisations. Perhaps only later were they committed to the more permanent art form on paper under the influence and advice of the Polish folklorist and composer Oskar Kolberg. Chopin floated between popular and art music quite effortlessly.\n\nGeorge Sand wrote in Les Ma√Ætres Sonneurs (The Master Pipers) 'He gave us the finest dances in the world....so attractive and easy to dance to that we seemed to fly through the air.'\n\nNo. 1 in B major\n\nSorita was idiomatic within its harmonically adventurous and fragmented nature. The mazurka rhythm was clear.\n\nNo. 2 in C major\n\nFerdynand Hoesick described this mazurka that has such a rustic dance feel as follows: ‚ÄòThe basses bellow, the strings go hell for leather, the lads dance with the lasses and they all but wreck the inn‚Äô. I felt Sorita could have been less controlled, more spontaneous, more boisterous and rumbustious!\n\nNo. 3 in C minor\n\nI always felt this mazurka as not based in reality but in nostalgic dream and memories. I felt Sorita was most successful in this mazurka, a fragile, refined work which drifts over the Mazovian plain on a summer breeze, fading away to nothing as an autumn leaf falls into a stream and drifts...\n\nBallade in F major, Op. 38 (1839)\n\nIt opened with captivating childish innocence and adorable simplicity of melody. This was followed by explosive passions of the grim reality of war or love, the suffering, the feast of the tigers of experience followed a naive lack of knowledge of the world. I have always felt this work to be traversing the emotional landscape of a broken love affair. Technically in terms of articulation, tone and touch his performance was formidably impressive with occasional lapses of deeper expressiveness as dynamic exaggerations tended to rear their ugly heads. I felt the dynamic contrasts could have been moderated. A convincing, almost operatic, performance of this tragic narrative of a broken life. By definition, authentic passion cannot be controlled.\n\nLargo in E flat major (1847)\n\nI am not fond of this work despite the affecting melody, A Prayer for Poland, but see it mainly but it was clearly of importance to Fryderyk Chopin. In this work, dated to 6 July 1838 (the year is uncertain) Chopin refers to or is based on Jan Nepomucen Kaszewski‚Äôs original 1816 melody for the hymn Bo≈ºe c√≥s Polskƒô (A Prayer to God to save Poland). It made an imaginative harmonic transition to the Polonaise attacca.\n\nPolonaise in A flat major, Op. 53 (1842‚Äì1843)\n\nSorita opened this familiar work in a conventionally noble and heroic style which is all one should ask perhaps. All the Chopin polonaises, regardless of when they were written, are connected by the supreme idea of the polonaise-the most important Polish national dance. The polonaise developed in Poland long before Chopin's time, and since the Baroque era it had been a fashionable society dance at many European courts. The most eminent composers frequently wrote polonaises, including Bach, Teleman, Beethoven and Weber.\n\nThe nineteenth-century poet and critic Kazimierz Brodzi≈Ñski wrote :\n\nThe polonaise breathes and paints the whole national character; the music of this dance, while admitting much art, combines something martial with a sweetness marked by the simplicity of manners of an agricultural people . . . Our fathers danced it with a marvellous ability and a gravity full of nobleness; the dancer, making gliding steps with energy, but without skips, and caressing his moustache, varied his movements by the position of his sabre, of his cap, and of his tucked-up coat sleeves, distinctive signs of a free man and a warlike citizen.\n\nI felt however as the work progressed Sorita was transforming it into merely a virtuoso 'pianistic' display rather than a felt expressive work of Polish resistance, pride and valiance. The heroics were slightly overdone but then how does any young pianist resist such an irresistible temptation in playing such this rousing work of Chopin. He knows and feels that it is deeply affecting his audience, especially now in a time of war where so much of Chopin's ≈ºal and passionate resistance to Russian oppression has become so intensely relevant.\n\nCharge of Pozna≈Ñ cavalry during November Uprising (1830)\n\nJuliusz Kossak (1824-1899)\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFranz Schubert(1797‚Äì1828)\n\nPiano sonata in A major D.959 (1828)\n\nThe late sonatas were written during the last prolific months of Schubert's all too brief life, this one in 1828, mere months before his death. His sonatas were neglected until the twentieth century as they were thought to be inferior to those of Beethoven. Of course they possess the unique voice of a musical genius. Beethoven had died the previous year and in some ways Schubert felt he had inherited his mantle. As Alfred Brendel has pointed out, the three late sonatas (a sonata trilogy in fact), are closely connected motivically and tonally.\n\nAllegro\n\nThe opening suggests chamber music for strings so I felt his rather heavy approach was not really suitable here, even if the movement was greatly affected by the writing of Beethoven. I feel a session playing this Schubert movement on a period instrument would be most instructive concerning overall sonority to be aimed at on a modern Steinway.\n\nAndantino\n\nSurely this bleak, immortal movement in F sharp minor is the pivot of the sonata on which the whole structure revolves. The mesmeric main theme reminds one of Schubert's Heine songs and Der Leiermann from Winterreise. The melancholic contemplation, even obsession, is ever present. The dynamic contrasts should not be overdone even if Sorita possesses such a fine fingers, tone and refined touch. Such dynamic variations would simply not be possible on an instrument of Schubert's day. His musical conception was modified by the sound palette at his disposal.\n\nScherzo Allegro vivace -Trio: Un poco pi√π lento\n\nAlfred Brendel found a parallel with this movement and the painting The Third of May, 1808 by Francisco Goya, where the brutality of the firing squad and the defenseless human target are contrasted. I felt this movement was attractively articulated by Sorita with its slight detach√©. The movement was light and elegant, perfectly in keeping with Schubert's vision and forcibly uplifting his mood to escape the slough of despond. One must never forget that everything in Schubert is song.\n\nRondo Allegretto - Presto\n\nThe Beethovenian Rondo. Allegretto had a far more positive life outlook than that depicted in the bleak Andantino. Sorita was at times eloquent of the existential uncertainties laid before the passionate, almost desperate grasp at life suffusing the Coda.\n\nI hope with personal maturity and a deeper identification with the tragic life of Schubert, together with the nostalgic yet masculine sonority he was aiming to produce, that this massively gifted pianist will penetrate further into the spiritual core of this uniquely troubled composer.\n\nEncores:\n\nFirst of all a delightful Grieg Wedding Day at Troldhaugen. Balanced, light, energetic and joyfully dancing. Then the deeply felt Brahms Intermezzo in A major Op.118 No.2. Finally a Grande valse brillante by Chopin that was uplifted by perfect waltz rhythm, sparkling articulation, most elegant and stylish in approach with refined touch and tone. This interpretation could not be bettered! These qualities in Chopin waltzes are so rare among young pianists.\n\nWEDNESDAY, 10 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR\n\n8.00 PM\n\nPiano recital\n\nALEXANDER GAVRYLYUK\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770‚Äí1827)\n\nPiano Sonata in C sharp minor \"Moonlight\", Op. 27 No. 2 (1802)\n\nThe Elbe in Moonlight\n\nJohann Christian Dahl (1788-1857)\n\nA fascinating performance of this familiar sonata full of the dynamic, mood and tempo contrasts that Beethoven clearly intended. In fact the work became so well known it irritated Beethoven as he felt it overshadowed his other later, more profound musical statements.\n\nAdagio sostenuto\n\nThis movement is marked senza sordini (without dampers) and una corda (the hammer moving across via the action by means of a pedal to strike one string rather than three). This would have been sonically possible on the early pianos of Beethoven's time (not today) such as the Graf and would have endowed the movement with a rather disembodied, mysterious and haunted atmosphere. Moonlight possibly but not the sweet blurred impressionistic romance given the movement on a modern piano. Clouds darkly pass with pain over the face of this moon.\n\nI felt Gavrylyuk understood this perfectly well in his expressive rendering of the movement. Berlioz wrote of the Adagio that it 'is one of those poems that human language does not know how to qualify.' He further defined the piece: 'The left hand softly displays large chords of a solemn, sad character, and the length of these allows the vibrations of the piano to extend gradually over each one of them.' He chose the correct alla breve time signature which prevents the movement descending into cloying sentiment. Many pianists play this movement with indulgent emotion.\n\nAllegretto Trio\n\nA statement of innocence - light, graceful and untroubled. Gavrylyuk adopted a moderate tempo with just a touch of poetic melancholy hovering.\n\nPresto agitato\n\nHere Gavrylyuk approached the Presto agitato with an almost frightening ferocity, an almost suicidal tempo (an act Beethoven actually contemplated during clinical depression). This conception is entirely in keeping with the highly emotional, neurotically agitated conception that pullulated in the brain of Beethoven. Gavrylyuk expressed a towering power and articulated exuberance the like of which I have never heard from any pianist before in this movement. An unforgettable and a truly individual voice exploded before us in this Presto. The motivic energy he summoned was irresistible and became incandescent with the heat of velocity generated from expressed internal passions of the highest rhythmic energy. The dynamic variation he utilized was theatrical and intensely dramatic.\n\nOne of the great performances of this much performed sonata.\n\nRobert Schumann (1810‚Äì1856)\n\nScenes from Childhood (Kinderszenen), Op. 15 (1838)\n\nI shall write my impressions in note form as longer analysis is inappropriate in a brief review of this kind.\n\nOf Foreign Lands and Peoples\n\nChaming and childlike in its innocence\n\nA Curious Story\n\nThe childish curiosity was winningly clear\n\nBlind Man's Bluff\n\nI could feel the essence of the exciting game and the internal 'blind' force\n\nPleading Child\n\nThe harmonic and plangent harmonic transitions gave us that unique feeling children express when taken over by a desperate desire for something\n\nHappy Enough\n\nRather too adult and exaggerated for the qualification 'happy enough' - a slight tinge of regret or negative reflection in the title?\n\nAn Important Event\n\nAlso rather heavy enjoyment for a child I thought!\n\nDreaming\n\nSuch a lyrical piece performed with great sensitivity and beauty by Gavrylyuk. No sentimental dwelling on emotion or mawkish indulgence\n\nAt the Fireside\n\nA domestic feeling of being 'At Home' perfectly captured\n\nKnight of the Hobbyhorse\n\nRather strenuous riding for a mere hobbyhorse in a nursery I felt\n\nAlmost Too Serious\n\nYes, a mood wonderfully expressed\n\nFrightening Child\n\nFalling Asleep\n\nA charming depiction of the internal process of a child falling asleep. Children fall asleep then fight it and suddenly wake and return to the somnolent groves. The piece is a marvellous depiction of this process which Gavrylyuk understood.\n\nThe Poet Speaks\n\nAnd so to conclude a poet penetrates childhood consciousness, music and lyrical meaning. 'The fewer the notes the more difficult to play'\n\nA fine performance of this work by a pianist who understands children so well\n\nFerenc Liszt (1811‚Äì1886)\n\nVenezia e Napoli: Tarantella S.162 (1859)\n\nThe virtuosic Tarantella is from the collection Venezia e Napoli (published 1861), a revised version of earlier pieces which he issued as a supplement to his Ann√©es de p√®lerinage: Deuxi√®me ann√©e devoted to his musical impressions of Italy. The work is based on dance melodies by the Neapolitan editor and music publisher Guillaume-Louis Cottrau (1797-1847).\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir The Bay of Naples (1882)\n\nThe English author Sacheverell Sitwell (1897-1988) in his fine book on Liszt, amusingly writes:\n\n'In any case, the Tarantella is a delightful epitome of the warn Italian south, not to be taken too seriously, except by the pianist who may have wrestle with its appalling difficulties. For this, perhaps the most arduous of all the pieces in the Ann√©es de p√®lerinage: Deuxi√®me ann√©e (supplement), is essentially a concert finale and belongs to that class of Liszt's works which seems calculated to leave the executant paralyzed, or struck down with tetanus, at the close of his performance.' (p. 72)\n\nGavrylyuk gave us a simply a spectacular performance with the blazing pyrotechnics that has had us on our feet here for many years. A kaleidoscopic spectrum of contrasting colours, phrasing, dynamics and tonal textures. These musical qualities were enhanced by stylish gestures of immense theatricality. Nineteenth century romantic Latin love and lyrical passions were here depicted at white heat.\n\nThe sounds he produced fell like stars and pearls around us! Duration and dynamically matched repeated notes a la Horowitz, a pianist he adored. The audience at Duszniki leaped to their feet erupting into wild applause and cheering. Glittering virtuosity from the golden age of pianism, communicated as an artistic quality in its own right, something we have largely forgotten. The heart raced and sheer excitement filled the psyche.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äì1849)\n\nNocturne in D flat major, Op. 27 No. 2 (1835)\n\nHugo Leichtentritt was a German musicologist and composer who called the cantilena that opens the work ‚Äòachingly beautiful‚Äô. I felt Gavrylyuk did not penetrate sufficiently the soul of this nocturne in approaching it rather too aggressively on this occasion. When he performed it in 2015 at Duszniki I wrote: The bel canto and cantabile nature of the Chopin Nocturne in D-flat major Op.27 No.2 was similarly brought off with poetry and sweet melancholy - 'Parting is such sweet sorrow...' On this occasion I felt his apassionato could have been a little more subtle and expressing more of a feeling of improvisation and emotional discovery.\n\nAndr√© Gide in his Notes on Chopin, perceptively described music of this genre:\n\n‚Äò[Chopin] seemed to be constantly seeking, inventing, discovering his thought little by little. This kind of charming hesitation, of surprise and delight, ceases to be possible if the work is presented to us, no longer in a state of successive formation, but as an already perfect, precise and objective whole.'\n\n[Andr√© Gide, Notes on Chopin, tr. Bernard Frechtman (New York, 1949), p.21].\n\nPolonaise in A major, Op. 40 No. 1 (1838‚Äì1839)\n\nChopin took this polonaise with him from Majorca to Paris. In Paris he prepared the manuscript for publication, joining it with the Polonaise in C minor conceived in the waves of melancholy that beset him in Valldemossa.\n\nIn 1837, Heinrich Heine famously commented ‚ÄòPoland gave him a chivalrous soul and the suffering of its history‚Äô. The A major Polonaise could be said to contain his ‚Äòchivalrous soul‚Äô, and the C minor Polonaise the historical suffering of the Polish nation.\n\nGavrylyuk captured the military atmosphere and sense of Polish national defiance brilliantly. Was he thinking of his own beleaguered nation of Ukraine? Few pianists manage this convincingly. The military character was solid, unremitting and irresistible. The strong military rhythm expressed power and life and his roaring tremolos surely a military snare drum. A fine, utterly persuasive performance which too often fails and is rarely performed in recital.\n\nJohannes Brahms (1833‚Äì1897)\n\nIntermezzi Op. 117 (1892)\n\nNo. 2 in B flat minor\n\nNo. 3 in C sharp minor\n\nBrahms in 1897\n\nThe Three Intermezzi Op 117 are products of the final phase of Brahms‚Äôs creativity and possess the nostalgia for the fading of high summer and the advent of autumn. They are the first group in the profound poetry contained in the short piano pieces that he composed in 1892‚Äì3. They were published in four collections, Opp 116 to 119.\n\nLike the quartets they were written very much with Clara Schumann in mind, for she was the first pianist to see them; but their moods are suffused with philosophical acceptance of seasonal change, that every love has its span of life and limited duration, even the forty years of love and friendship with Clara. Op 117 can be considered a triptych of lullabies. All three of these pieces seem to have had some secret significance for him: they were, he told his friend Rudolf von der Leyen, ‚Äòthree lullabies for my sorrows‚Äô. Eduard Hanslick described these brief autumnal works as 'monologues' of a 'thoroughly personal and subjective character‚Ä¶pensive, graceful, dreamy, resigned, and elegiac.'\n\nTo the Intermezzo No: 2 in B-flat minor Gavrylyuk brought the love yearning of a mature man when the emotions of love have calmed to a calm acceptance, a feeling beyond the passions of youthful doubt and anguished sufferance. There is a brief flaring up of the smouldering embers before they return to the warm, trusted glow of a settled fire. Beautifully controlled tone, touch, dynamics and colour.\n\nThe emotional landscape of the Intermezzo No 3 in C-sharp minor is clear from Brahms's emotive choice of key. Here Gavrylyuk brought an expressive but not cloying masculine strength typical of Brahms as I imagine him, even during this melancholic change of life season and spiritual reflection. He painted an emotional landscape in strong colours that possessed much philosophical depth. This dark work of chiaroscuro beauty is believed to be an unacknowledged setting of another of the German philosopher, theologian, poet, and literary critic Johann Gottfried Herder's translation of Scottish poems, a love-lament beginning ‚ÄòOh woe! Oh woe, deep in the valley ‚Ä¶‚Äô\n\nCamille Saint Sa√´ns (1835‚Äì1921) / Ferenc Liszt (1811‚Äì1886) / Vladimir Horowitz (1903‚Äì1989)\n\nDanse Macabre, Op. 40\n\nThe piece was actually was conceived in 1872 as an art song for voice and piano with a French text by the poet Henri Cazalis. In 1874, the composer expanded and reworked the piece into a tone poem, replacing the vocal line with a solo violin part. Shortly after the premiere, the piece was transcribed into a piano arrangement by Liszt who knew Saint-Sa√´ns well. The composition was again later transcribed for piano by Vladimir Horowitz.\n\nI cannot help but feel Gavrylyuk chose this work only partly for piano virtuosic reasons, although he adores Horowitz and approaches his keyboard genius at times. he may have also chosen it but possibly as a not overly serious response to the Covid 19 pandemic which has beset the world and brought mass deaths so much closer and agonized the lives of millions. The cultural impact of mass outbreaks of disease, of pandemics, are not fleeting or temporary. The effect can endure past the initial stages of outbreak, in its deep etching upon the culture and society. This can be seen in the artworks and motifs of Danse Macabre as people attempted to cope with the death surrounding them.\n\nHis beginning was an overwhelming and truly macabre declaration as if a funeral bell was tolling. The crescendos he conjured from the piano were beyond credibility. Pandemonium erupted within his fiery and grim imagination and swept all before it.\n\nA tidal wave of enthusiastic approbation followed his recital.\n\nHis first encore was the Andante second movement from the italian Concerto of Bach. I was unsure of his second encore. His third encore was the Chopin Etude in E-flat minor Op.10 No.6. His final encore was an affecting piece of 'forbidden' Russian music (in view of the Ukrainian war), the magnificent Vocalise by Rachmaninoff arranged for solo piano.\n\nWEDNESDAY 10 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 4.00 PM\n\nPiano recital\n\nAIMI KOBAYASHI\n\nChopin\n\nNocturne in C-sharp minor Op. posth\n\nHer refined and elegant touch and tone were evident from the outset of the recital. There was a seamless and affecting flow of nostalgic emotion, so important to communicate in Chopin. A deeply and sensitively performed account that that unaccountably moved me less than I had hoped.\n\nNocturne in F-sharp minor Op.48 No.2\n\nThe atmosphere is created by the first two bars followed by the most affecting melody. Tomaszewski writes 'the impression might be that it will last forever.'\n\n‚ÄòWhat is most exquisite and most individual in Chopin‚Äôs art, wherein it differs most wonderfully from all others,‚Äô noted Andr√© Gide ‚ÄòI see in just that non-interruption of the phrase; the insensible, the imperceptible gliding from one melodic proposition to another, which leaves or gives to a number of his compositions the fluid appearance of streams.‚Äô A characteristic of Chopin during the 1840s, in his last, reflective, post-Romantic phase. This is the source of Wagner‚Äôs unendliche Melodie Tomaszewski reveals with his unparalleled Chopinesque perceptions.\n\nKobayashi sang poignantly as if in an opera and took us into dramatic realms of operatic soundscape. The seminal influence of Bach on Chopin was made clear in her harmonic transitions. She cultivated this nocturne into a grand work and brought the piece off persuasively well. The F sharp minor endless cantabile song was romantically ardent and poetic. The conclusion was as tender and eloquent as a dream.\n\nFantasie-Impromptu C-sharp minor Op.66\n\nThe Fantaisie Impromptu in C sharp minor Op. 66 (1834) requires a high degree of virtuosity to make it into a charming and convincing work. Kobayashi lightly gestured the eloquent polyphony with wonderful control over the cascading notes, a discipline over the tumbling water source of Vistula in the mountains. The middle section with the famous slow, reflective nocturne, was expressively touching. It flowed at a moderato cantabile tempo, weaving a sotto voce melody in D flat major. She made a grand work of this familiar piece using the rich colour palette of the Shigeru Kawai instrument, the emotional structure fluid and unsettlingly meaningful in a musical sense. A virtuosic conclusion with nostalgic reminiscences.\n\nJohannes Brahms (1833‚Äì1897)\n\nClara Schumann wrote in her diary after receiving the pieces Op. 118 and Op. 119\n\n'It really is marvelous how things pour from him; it is wonderful how he combines passion and tenderness in the smallest of spaces.\n\nFour Pieces for piano, Op. 119 (1893)\n\nIntermezzo in B minor\n\nThis Intermezzo was more a study in sound than a heart yearning for love. It could have been more beautifully unsettled, full of the reflective anguish of past unrequited love, moments of anger and resistance followed by final resignation. In this work moments of Arcadian bliss are followed by happy memories of calm refection cultivated in the consoling refuge of age.\n\nIntermezzo in E minor\n\nI am not sure Kobayashi yet understands the tender dislocation within the Brahms heart. Again I was looking to feel more yearning here, the hopeless desires of maturity that still smoulder in the embers of memory. Does the sun ever emerge from behind the shadowing clouds? Sometimes yes .....\n\nIntermezzo in C major\n\nI can only describe the mood of the Intermezzo in C major with the opening stanza of a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nTo a Skylark\n\nHail to thee blithe spirit!\n\nBird thou never wert-\n\nThat from heaven or near it\n\nPourest thy full heart\n\nIn profuse strains of unpremeditated art.\n\nI felt this interpretation could have been more joyous, the magical leap of the heart as it unexpectedly catches sight of beloved!\n\nRhapsody in E flat major\n\nThis work could have expressed more nobility and gravitas. Just look at the magnificent head and countenance of the older Brahms! Imagine the emotions of aged and at times frustrated experience, like a great storm settling in the soul, resting philosophically yet still powerfully in the heart of this unsurpassed artist of the creative intellect.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äí1849)\n\nScherzo in B minor, Op. 20 (1834‚Äì1835)\n\nA dramatic opening that heralded a virtuoso pianistic approach to playing the work. Kobayashi interpreted this Chopin Scherzo with immense dynamic contrasts. A degree of great nervous agitation created something of the atmosphere of an 'infernal banquet' required by this dark 'joke' (as the word 'scherzo' is supposed to mean in Italian). However, the lyrical central section (based on the Polish Christmas Carol Lulajze Jezuniu) was perhaps not quite understood deeply and ardently enough in its deep Polish national significance. Her overwhelming keyboard facility tended to mask a sufficient degree of subtlety of sensibility and heartfelt expression. The return of 'the infernal' after the carol was more expressively grand than psychically demented as I believe it is. The extreme contrasts in mood are extraordinary in this most psychotically revealing work of Chopin.\n\nScherzo in B flat minor, Op. 31 (1836‚Äì1837)\n\nHere we had a great narrative drama, an eruption of dramatic force that lead almost to its own destruction. The work is a perfect example of 'Chopinian dynamic romanticism'. Chopin as a teacher was rarely satisfied with the opening triplet 'question' as he felt it should be uttered. Is this a question by Hamlet with a tempestuous but ambiguous answer ?\n\nKobayashi opened the work with penetrating existentialism and a question that must be answered. She presented the piece as heroic and the narrative of a grand destiny. Although slightly rushed at times, she offered us an exciting performance with great forward impetus. Her lyrical cantabile Trio was affecting until we were rudely transported out of the sweet garden back into the crucible of demolishing power by the formidable coda.\n\nGiovanni Domenico Tiepolo - Carnival Scene (1754-55)\n\nScherzo in C sharp minor, Op. 39 (1839)\n\nThis scherzo opens in a 'Gothic', almost grotesque manner to become a fine and noble account approaching immense grandeur. Dedicated to his muscular pupil Adolf Gutman, this was last work the composer sketched during the Majorca sojourn and in the fraught atmosphere of the monastery at Valldemossa. The religiosity of the chorale was answered with not particularly meaningful jeu perl√© cascades of notes, paste diamonds falling on crystal. The sotto voce transition to the minor was haunting and existentially tragic in the face of the abyss of death. Chopin was ill at the time which interrupted and perhaps affected the writing. ‚Äò‚Ä¶questions or cries are hurled into an empty, hollow space ‚Äì presto con fuoco.‚Äô (Tomaszewski).\n\nScherzo in E major, Op. 54 (1842‚Äì1843)\n\nThis is a rarely performed scherzo. This work is not dramatic in the demonic sense of the three previous scherzi, but lighter in ambience. The outer sections are a strange exercise in rather joke-filled fun with a darkly concealed centre of passionate grotesquerie dependent on the accentuation of rhythmic detail. The work mysteriously encloses a deeply felt and ardent nocturne in the form of a longing love poem, suffused with a sense of loss.\n\nPlayfulness with hints of seriousness and gravity underlie the exuberant mood of this scherzo. The emotional ambiguities that run like a vein though the work were given expression. The central section (lento, then sostenuto) in place of the Trio, gives one the impression so often with Chopin, of the ardent, reflective nature of distant love. Kobayashi was poignant in the beautiful cantabile. Kobayashi was far more successful expressively here than in the other scherzi with a truly haunting cantabile. She explored and sang this operatic dream world and movingly expressed the complexity of these labyrinthine emotions. The 'triumph and the will' infused the passionate last chords that closed the work.\n\nHeinrich Heine, a German poet who idolized Chopin, asked himself in a letter from Paris: ‚ÄòWhat is music?‚Äô He answered ‚ÄòIt is a marvel. It has a place between thought and what is seen; it is a dim mediator between spirit and matter, allied to and differing from both; it is spirit wanting the measure of time and matter which can dispense with space.‚Äô\n\nEncores:\n\n1.

The introduction was calm and reflective followed by a triumphal account overall with much ≈ºal, anger and resentment.The chorale section was considered and deeply affecting making the re-emergence of emotional tumult all the more powerful with even more ≈ºal than on the first occasion, more urgency and building to the climacteric. She introduced an heroic tone and emotional intensity as the work progressed. The conclusion came as the expression of exhaustion of passionate emotions and a sense of resigned despair. A remarkable and formidable performance of this masterpiece.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äí1849)\n\nNocturne in C sharp minor, Op. 27 No. 1 (1835)\n\nPresented as a sensitive narrative of love\n\nRobert Schumann (1810‚Äì1856)\n\nDavidsbundlert√§nze, Op. 6 (1837)\n\nShe created a beautiful opening for this challenging work, the remarkable masterpiece Davidsb√ºndlert√§nze (Dances of the League of David), Op. 6 (1837). This is a set of 18 pieces and one of the great works of Western Romantic piano literature. The Davidsb√ºndler (League of David) was a music society founded by Schumann in his literary musings. The League itself was inspired by real or imagined literary societies such as those created by E.T.A Hoffmann. The major theme was based on a mazurka by Clara Wieck and was inspired by his love of her and hope for their union ('many wedding thoughts') which permeates all the works of this period. Her presence is rather subliminal throughout the whole cycle.\n\nLiterature and music had a symbiotic relationship for Schumann and was a source of the unique qualities of his genius. He was famous at this time as a perceptive music critic, even over knowledge of him as a composer. He considered music criticism, extra-musical criticism, to be an art form in itself. In this work it is clear he was gaining in musical self-confidence as a composer with his increasing attraction to the public. The masks of Carnaval are stripped away and the poet's face here revealed.\n\nThe pieces are not really dances but musical 'dialogues' concerning contemporary music that take place between Florestan (rasch-quick or hasty) and Eusebius (innig-intimate). Schumann created these characters to represent the active and passive aspects of his personality. The enigmatic description of No.9 reads 'Here Florestan stopped, and his lips trembled sorrowfully.' I cannot analyse here each of the eighteen movements of the work, although I would dearly love to do this. Save to say, Mun gave an energetic, electrical performance of Florestan, together with the other side of the human coin, the tender, 'feminine' cantabile that depicted the gentle lyricism of Eusibius. She captured much of the poetic, mercurial, impetuous, whimsical and lyrical aspects of Schumann's nature whilst preserving the unity of this cycle that allows us to experience ‚Äòmusic as landscape‚Äô (Charles Rosen).\n\nLebhaftInnig\n\nMit Humor\n\nUngeduldig\n\nEinfach\n\nSehr rasch\n\nNicht schnell\n\nFrisch\n\nLebhaft\n\nBalladenm√§√üig ‚Äì sehr rasch\n\nEinfach\n\nMit Humor\n\nWild und lustig\n\nZart und singend\n\nFrisch\n\nMit gutem Humor\n\nWie aus der Ferne\n\nNicht schnell\n\nHer encore:\n\n1.

There is \"inventive\" semiquaver passagework. A pleasant beginning but an unusual one because of its polyphonic complexity.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791)\n\nMozart's Vienna 1785\n\nPublished by Artaria in 1784, interestingly in 2014, Hungarian librarian Bal√°zs Mikusi discovered four pages of Mozart's original score (autograph) of the sonata in Budapest's National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library. Until then, only the last page of the autograph had been known to have survived.\n\nPiano sonata in A major, K.331 (1781‚Äì1784)\n\nAndante grazioso - Tema con variazione\n\nMenuetto ‚Äì Trio\n\nAlla Turca. Allegretto\n\nI found his presentation of this sonata stylistically pure and completely charming, elegant, refined and graceful with just the right degree of tasteful affectation. Fine judicious use of the pedal and semi-detach√© articulation. The choice of tempo for the Alla Turca seemed beautifully balanced with uplifting energy and life, sparkling and a quite delightful slightly detached left hand articulation.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770‚Äì1827)\n\nPiano Sonata in E major, Op. 109 (1820)\n\nVivace ma non troppo, sempre legato ‚Äì Adagio espressivo\n\nPrestissimo\n\nGesangvoll, mit innigster Empfindung. Andante molto cantabile ed espressivo\n\nThis sonata was composed in 1820 when Beethoven was completely deaf and suffering ill-health. However, it is an especially lyrical work. Clearly a fine performance, stylistically pure, the work is a profound personal statement by Beethoven which gives an impression of internal life.\n\nThe reflective parts of the Adagio espressivo are of the deepest philosophical introspection which I felt he succeeded in penetrating from the outset an a most soulful and expressive manner. Here was a song full of nostalgic yearning for lost affections. The staccato sections provided a marvellous contrast of sound texture and mood. The sonata breaks nearly all the rules of traditional sonata form.\n\nThe Prestissimo emerged as an immaculate yet irresistible force of glowing tone and sparkling articulation. We were presented with the expression of divine nostalgic laments, regrets in life, the meditative preoccupations and loss of love leading to an ultimate resignation under the stronger force of destiny. His staccato articulation throughout was very fine with much colour and nuance relieving the granite.\n\nBeethoven for me sometimes requires the communication of a feeling of the struggle of human inadequacy against unflinching fate, the anger that this can be generated in the heart and soul when intense lyricism has been experienced, lost and then remembered with yearning. Beethoven for me requires what one might term the condiments of human imperfection, some temperamental roughness and not classical perfection.\n\nThis tougher, more masculine and intellectual approach became clear in the theme and six variations, each with a different character and partly contrapuntal texture, contained within the final movement Gesangvoll, mit innigster Empfindung Andante molto cantabile ed espressivo. The writing veers between moments of lyrical cantabile and the severely declamatory. The driving rhythmic energy of the fifth variation gives the impression, at least to begin with, of a complex, many-voiced chorale-like fugue. Son built an eloquent conclusion from a peak of powerful armour that resolved into quiet resignation at the conclusion. Beethoven‚Äôs approach to the variation form at the conclusion is far freer here than in his previous sonatas.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äí1849)\n\nThe Pleyel pianino at Valldemossa on which Chopin may have composed the\n\nC minor polonaise Op.40 No.2\n\nPolonaise in C minor, Op. 40 No. 2 (1838‚Äì1839)\n\nSon adopted a noble, tragic tempo in this great polonaise with in the Trio, a tragic and sublime, nostalgic sung cantilena. Cruel and brutal destiny hovers overs it and reality erupts once again to destroy the dream.\n\nThe polonaise is believed to have been composed in the dark atmosphere of the Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa. It would be difficult to find an alternative to the definition advanced by the writer, historian and musicologist Ferdynand Hoesick who wrote of the ‚Äògloomy mood‚Äô that emanates from this music, of its melancholy and ‚Äòtragic loftiness‚Äô.\n\nDedicated to Julian Fontana, Chopin wrote: ‚ÄòYou have an answer to your honest and genuine letter in the second Polonaise. It‚Äôs not my fault that I‚Äôm like that poisonous mushroom [‚Ä¶] I know I‚Äôve been of no use to anyone ‚Äì but then I‚Äôve been of precious little use to myself‚Äô.\n\n4 Mazurkas, Op. 24 (1833‚Äì1835)\n\nG minor\n\nC major\n\nA flat major\n\nB flat minor\n\nWaltz in F minor, Op. 70 No. 2 (1841‚Äì1842)\n\nWaltz in A minor, Op. posth. (1847‚Äì1849)\n\nWaltz in A flat major, Op. 34 No. 1 (1835)\n\n3 Ecossaises, Op. 72 (1829‚Äì1830)\n\nD major\n\nG major\n\nD flat major\n\nI could of course examine the performance of each in turn but of the performance of these works of Chopin I am left with absolutely nothing left to say. They seemed to me to express most of what I deeply feel concerning the music of Chopin in his Waltzes, Mazurkas and the sheer civilized charm and grace in his performance of the three Ecossaises.\n\nTarantella in A flat major, Op. 43 (1841)\n\nDancing the Tarantella\n\n'I hope I‚Äôll not write anything worse in a hurry‚Äô ‚Äì Chopin‚Äôs rather unflattering assessment of the Tarantella. Shortly after arriving in Nohant, Chopin wrote to Julian Fontana with the manuscript of the Tarantella (to be copied): ‚ÄòTake a look at the Recueil of Rossini songs [‚Ä¶] where the Tarantella (en la) appears. I don‚Äôt know if it was written in 6/8 or 2/8. Both versions are in use, but I‚Äôd prefer it to be like the Rossini‚Äô\n\nIt did have some feeling of frenzy from the growing effects of the poisonous tarantula bite but for me lacked the characteristic joyfulness and gaiety of the Italian dance. I thought Son could have given us a more convincing rhythmic account of the victim of a poisonous spider bite (by the Tarantula) and the growth of the insidious, destructive chemical circulating in the blood. Traditionally the victim became well and truly beside himself, increasingly and madly so by the triumphant conclusion.\n\nPolonaise in A flat major, Op. 53\n\nThis performance of the famous work was in many degrees faultless in its majestic nobility and fierce resentful anger. It was clearly the result of the accumulation of many, many years of intimate familiarity with the score, the performance, the teaching, the associative moods and imagery as well as the hearing of this masterpiece (in the espaces imaginaires). Incontrovertibly a political and musical revolutionary demonstration against invasion, territorial hegemony and brutal invasion of one's homeland. More appropriate now than in times of peace and a fine choice by Son to conclude, expressing human significance on many levels of deep musical association.\n\nMONDAY\n\n8 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 4.00 PM\n\nPiano recital\n\nDMYTRO CHONI\n\nJohannes Brahms (1833‚Äì1897)\n\n2 Rhapsodies, Op. 79 (1879)\n\nNo. 1 in B minor\n\nNo. 2 in G minor\n\nBrahms wrote these attractive Rhapsodies in his maturity during his summer stay on the shores of the attractive Lake W√∂rthersee in Austria, Carinthia's largest lake. I felt the performance spoilt by too exaggerated dynamic contrasts - a fault in so many of the young prize-winners one hears today. This could be a result of the relatively small internal volume of the dworek.\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äì1849)\n\n√âtude in A minor, Op. 25 No. 11 (1835‚Äì1837)\n\nA highly accomplished and promising performance from a young pianist with great future potential.\n\nFerenc Liszt (1811‚Äì1886)\n\nApr√®s une lecture du Dante: Fantasia quasi Sonata S. 161/7 (1849)\n\nThe Liszt Dante Sonata which always makes my hair stand on end no matter how it is played. For me it is the absolute apex of Romantic expression, a magnificent musical structure second only to his Sonata in B minor expressing a true fear of death and the Christian horror of losing the throw of dice and being thrown into the Inferno. Perhaps one must be a true believer to enter this piece and have at home a skull on the mantle as a momento mori of what is in store for all of us. Dante and Milton combine here in terrifying substance....\n\nChoni showed great passionate energy in this work and conviction in his strong sense of structure. He made excellent use of expressive silence, as important in music as sound. There was an engaging sense of forward momentum in the narrative emotion of the work. The contrast of reflective lyricism was effective and full of attractive details and moments of song. I felt Choni was possessed of great natural musical gifts. Overall there was a feeling of existential anxiety in this performance, perfectly appropriate to Liszt's intentions. Glowing and threatening landscapes of the musical mind.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nClaude Debussy (1862‚Äì1918)\n\nEt la lune descend sur le temple qui f√ªt (Images II) (1907)\n\nHe accomplished a beautiful impressionistic 'image' of this painting 'And the moon descends on the temple that was...'\n\nL‚ÄôIsle joyeuse (1904)\n\nThe Jersey coastline\n\nL'Isle joyeuse written on the island of Jersey when in a state of heightened emotion - the composer was joyfully embracing a passionate love affair in the summer of 1904 with Emma Bardac, the wife of a rich and prominent banker. His wife, 'Lilly' attempted suicide after Debussy wrote to her telling her the marriage was over. The ensuing scandal was to alienate Debussy from many of his friends, whilst Bardac was disowned by her family. They were eventually married in 1908. Much of La Mer was written on the island. Choni gave us an impressionistic account of the pieces, maintaining an attractive quality of a summer afternoon's improvisation but also passionate. The expression of the dynamic expression of sensual joy was youthfully impressive!\n\nDebussy and Emma Bardac on Jersey\n\nValentin Silvestrov (born 1937)\n\n3 Bagatelles, Op. 1 (2005)\n\nI do not write new music.

Ginastera‚Äôs intention for the piece was to capture the spirit of Argentine folk music without relying on explicit quotations from existing folk songs.\n\nAllegro marcato\n\nI found this movement exciting but rather too long and unrelenting in its forceful rhythmic projection\n\nPresto misterioso\n\nI really did not hear a great deal of what OI might consider 'mysterious' in any conventional sense.\n\nAdagio molto appasionato\n\nHere was contained Latin passion, but the passions of the dreaming night. Somnambulistic rather after all passion spent\n\nRuvido ed ostinato\n\nPercussively quite unsettled\n\nEncores:\n\nAn absolutely delightful Soiree de Vienne Concert Paraphrase after Johann Strauss Op.56 by Arthur Gr√ºnfeld (1852-1924)\n\nValentin Silvestrov Bagatelle 1 XIII/II\n\nA most varied and interesting programme that is showing great promise as a discriminating musician and pianist\n\nAn original 17th century door-case in Duszniki Zdroj\n\nMasterclass Aleksander Gavrylyuk\n\n9.30 am Monday August 8th 2022\n\nThe masterclasses at Duszniki are always of the greatest interest but I can only attend a few as I am writing performance reviews which of course take time and thought.\n\nAnna Golka who provides the brilliant, indispensable simultaneous translation from professorial musicological English into Polish at the Duszniki Masterclasses\n\nThe session on 8th August began with Julia Lozowska working with Prof. Gavrylyuk on the formidable Brahms Variations on a Theme of Paganini Op.35. he spoke of the importance of the 'inner beauty' of the work, theinner process and filling the internal spaces with inner energy. He indicated there was always apurpose behind the music and one must envisage from a space at the beginning into which the piece moves. He emphasized theelectricitywhich lies behind the notes and referred to 'a restless search for the light'.\n\nJulia Lozowska working with Prof. Gavrylyuk on the BrahmsVariations on a Theme of Paganini Op.35\n\nPedalling the BrahmsVariations on a Theme of Paganini Op.35\n\nIn his session with Jozef Domzal he worked on the ChopinPolonaise-FantasieOp.61.He warned that with Chopin it is tempting to emotionally exaggerate the content. He indicated how many gestures in this music resemble phrases written for cello. He also warned that the substantial bass on the modern concert grand can become too substantial and overwhelm Chopin.\n\n'The left hand has its own lifeline - do not forget!'There are many inner polyphonic movements in Chopin that require presentation as well as the obvious melodic lines.\n\nMuch of his advice focused on the physical aspects of performance, the vital need to relax from the shoulder and exercises to improve the muscular memory and the brain's trainable ability to activate muscles. He drew attention to the large and small muscles in the arm and hand, especially the thumb. He indicated how the larger muscles are specific for an increase in the speed of finger and an increase the hand dexterity. The smaller muscles, however intensively practiced, will not achieve this ability. He advised not spending excessive time practicing which Chopin also advised in his own teaching. Again he emphasized 'The inner process is the soul of the music.'\n\nProf. Gavrylyuk working with Jozef Domzal on the ChopinPolonaise-FantaisieOp.61\n\nElucidating the function of the muscles of the thumb and their vital role\n\n'Allow the music to lead the process rather than imposing your personality upon it. You should be the conduit for the music.'\n\nIn the Masterclass session I attended, he finally worked on a number of the Chopin Preludes with Aleksandra Dƒôbek. The first thing I noticed about her playing was the beautiful tone she produced and her refinement of touch. These aspects are rarely cultivated today but were emphasized as being of predominant importance for Chopin in his teaching and also for the great modern pedagogue Heinrich Neuhaus who devoted a long chapter to the cultivation of tone in his book The Art of Piano Playing. Aleksandra has also studied the period piano such as the Pleyel and harpsichord. I feel these are vital complements to a student's approach to performing Chopin 'authentically' with appropriate expressiveness on the modern Steinway or any instrumental development known as the modern 'concert grand piano'.\n\n'Allow the music to lead' Gavrylyuk advised and in one particular case he advised her concerning the musical interpretation of Chopin with the comment: 'If you exclaim impulsively 'I love you' it remains natural in the expression of love, otherwise if prepared and over-cultivated it becomes forced and unnatural.'\n\nThe truth of this reminded me forcibly of the marriage proposal by the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer in the nursery at Windsor Castle on 3 February 1981. \"We had this ghastly interview the day we announced our engagement,\" she said, \"And this ridiculous [reporter] said, ‚ÄòAre you in love?‚Äô I thought, what a thick question. So I said, ‚ÄòYes, of course, we are,‚Äô and Charles turned round and said, ‚ÄòWhatever love means.‚Äô And that threw me completely. I thought, what a strange answer. It traumatized me.\" (Diana: in her Own Words National Geographic Documentaries film 1991) We now know the consequences of that rather unnatural declaration.\n\nProf Gavrylyuk with Aleksandra Dƒôbek\n\nDealing with the so-called 'Raindrop' Prelude Op.28 No.15 he referred to the many and varied ways of opening this extraordinarily famous work. He did not refer to the fraught situation of its composition in Valldemossa, a haunting monastery he resided in with George Sand. The concentration was mainly on 'arches of sound', melodic line and how in performance the more simple the melody the more difficult it is to play with such exposed subtlety. Again concentrating on physical aspects, he demonstrated how to place arm weight on the note you wish to emphasize, where the other notes become weightless.\n\nAt one point, he played the LH and she played the RH and slower to hear the internal details.\n\nSUNDAY 7 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 8.00 PM\n\nPiano duo\n\nLUCAS & ARTHUR JUSSEN\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791)\n\nSonata for 2 pianos in D major, K.448 (1781)\n\nA great shout greeted their entrance onto the stage - familiarity and anticipation for great entertainment in store.\n\nAllegro con spirito\n\nThis rather rare work was composed in the galant style when Mozart was only 25 - close to the age of these two young, lively Dutchmen. Certainly this was a spirited beginning which continued with exuberant energy. I could not help imagining that Mozart may well have loved the irresistible forward impetus of this movement. A fine co-ordinated sound and quite uncanny, almost symbiotic ability, to combine their forces in perfect cohesion.\n\nAndante\n\nA charming and civilized consolation to the travails of existence in 2022. Once more a feeling of perfect synchronization on the levels of sound and feeling, although the brothers are not twins. the phrasing was particularly revealing of musical meaning.\n\nAllegro molto\n\nA lively movement once again with reminiscences of Mozart's Rondo alla Turca\n\nFranz Schubert (1797‚Äì1828)\n\nRondo for piano 4 hands (Grande Rondeau) in A major, D.951 (1828)\n\nA Schubertiade (1897) by Julius Schmid\n\nThis work from 1828 was considered by Alfred Einstein in his book Schubert as 'the apotheosis of all Schubert's compositions for four hands.' (p.282). Compositions for four hands are by their very nature considered sociable in a cultural context. The Schubertiade was a social event perfectly compatible with piano music for four hands. During Schubert's lifetime, these events were generally informal, unadvertised gatherings, held at private homes.The work has also been described as 'leisurely' and 'easygoing' and this duo communicated this almost carefree and gracious attitude within the music in their remarkably charismatic social communication. Schubertian yearning makes a subterranean appearance.\n\nFranz Schubert (1797-1828)\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äì1849)\n\nRondo in C major for 2 pianos, Op. 73 (1828)\n\nWith Elsner, composition studies began with the polonaise, but it was immediately followed by rondos and variations (Tomaszewski)\n\nIn 1825 the fifteen year old Chopin wrote and published his first rondo. He was composing as a young man in the glittering and Hummel-influenced, modish style brillant. These early works (along with others) are utterly delightful, graceful and charming to my mind and do not deserve to be downgraded by 'serious commentators' as simply youthful, virtuosic pieces demonstrating the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô aspect of his compositional training in Warsaw. They are being presently being resuscitated.\n\nThis 1828 Rondo in the version for two pianos demonstrated once again the extraordinary audience communication and synchronization of this family duo. The virtuosic display element subverted elegance and refinement in the musical writing at times. I found the cantabile and figurative writing quite wonderful in Chopin's youthful attachment to extrovert display at the keyboard. This was taken full advantage of by the spontaneous character and electrical energy of these two artists. A highly entertaining and musical performance that lifted the spirits out of the 'slough of despond' into which the planet has fallen! Wild audience response!\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFranz Schubert (1797‚Äì1828)\n\nAllegro in A minor D.947 Lebenssturme (Storms of Life)\n\nThis work is a sonata-form movement which opened in orchestral-like Beethovenian fashion (Schubert adored the ground Beethoven walked upon). I found the duo was seduced into rather over-declamatory effects on occasion but then again it is a 'love storm' in the Alps and not set entirely on a placid moonlit lagoon in Venice. However, we are transported into a rather visionary, even diaphanous texture for a time until the rather long, customary closing section, which again is 'sociable' in the best four-handed sense. One musical brain was clearly in finely balanced electro-chemical function.\n\nClaude Debussy (1862‚Äì1918)\n\n6 √âpigraphes Antiques for piano 4 hand (1914‚Äì1915)\n\nBackground: Claude Debussy standing in the drawing room at Pierre Lou√øs house\n\nNational Library of France, RES-VM EST-3 (11)\n\nI was not familiar with this work but on such a sociable moment of four-handed compositions I felt I must take advantage and listened carefully. This suite was Debussy's only completed composition in 1914. A great deal of the music is taken from the musical accompaniments he had written in 1901 for his friend Pierre Lou√øs (1870‚Äì1925). He was a French poet and writer, most renowned for lesbian and classical themes in some of his writings. He is known as a writer who sought to 'express pagan sensuality with stylistic perfection'\n\nOne of the less erotic photographs taken by Pierre Lou√øs (1870‚Äì1925)\n\nPour invoquer Pan, dieu du vent d'√©t√© (To invoke Pan, god of the summer wind)\n\nPlayed with a beautiful and affecting lyricism\n\nPour un tombeau sans nom (For a nameless tomb)\n\nDark and impressionistic lugubriousness\n\nPour que la nuit soit propice (In order that the night be propitious)\n\nThey conjured up haunting, internal, imaginative visions of the night\n\nPour la danseuse aux crotales (For the dancer with crotales)\n\nThis was highly energetic playing and the duo created the image of dancers clashing with their small brass percussion discs (about 10 cm in diameter)\n\nPour l'√©gyptienne (For the Egyptian woman)\n\nI felt a certain stasis and mystery of the sphinx in their performance - rather an inaccessible female quality in the Egypt of the day\n\nPour remercier la pluie au matin (To thank the morning rain)\n\nWith their astounding virtuosity they recreated the memory and sound of the morning rain that Debussy composed so realistically. Quite affecting if one loves the natural world to distraction.\n\nMaurice Ravel (1875‚Äì1937)\n\nLa valse version for 2 pianos\n\nCOURT BALL AT THE HOFBURG\n\nA waltz in the public ballroom of the Imperial Palace, Vienna. Watercolor by Wilhelm Gause 1900. Emperor Francis Joseph is on the far right\n\nDiaghilev had requested a four-hand reduction of the original orchestral score. Reports say that Stravinsky when he heard Ravel perform this with Marcelle Meyer in this version, he quietly left the room without a word so amazed was he. Ravel however would not admit to the work being an expression of the profound disillusionment in Europe following the immeasurable human losses and cruel maiming of the Great War. However one must recall in Thomas Mann‚Äôs Dr. Faustus that the composer Adrian Leverk√ºhn, although isolated from the clamour and destruction of the cannons of war, composed the most profound expression of it in his composition Apocalypsis cum Figuris by a type of metaphysical osmosis. Ravel‚Äôs note to the score gives one an insight to his intentions:\n\n'Through rifts in swirling clouds, couples are glimpsed waltzing. As the clouds disperse little by little, one sees an immense hall peopled with a whirling crowd. The scene becomes progressively brighter. The light from chandeliers bursts forth at fortissimo (letter B in the score). An Imperial Court, around 1855.'\n\nRavel described his composition as a ‚Äòwhirl of destiny‚Äô ‚Äì his concept was that the work impressionistically begins with clouds that slowly disperse to reveal a whiling crowd of dancers in the Imperial Court of Vienna in 1855. The Houston Symphony Orchestra programme note for the orchestral version performed in 2018 poses the question: Is this a Dance of Death or Delight ? I feel the question encapsulates perfectly the ambiguity inherent in this disturbing work. A composer can sometimes be a barometer that unconsciously registers the movements of history.\n\nThe duo opened this work with a sound that was inescapably an ominous premonition of war. The two concert grands began to sound like distant and often not so distant cannons. The recalled waltz rhythm of the beginning of this trance was idiomatic, stylish and understated. The sound created by this remarkable duo is rich and full and yet not breaking through the sound ceiling of their instruments (although the ceiling of the dworek may well have suffered stress!).\n\nThe sense of threat was ever present as the overwhelming energy of the whirling and bursts of light from the chandeliers built into a sound edifice, the like of which was like nothing I have ever heard in my life. The glissandos that sliced through the monumental, energetic sound towards the conclusion was like the merciless cut of a Polish sabre on horseback. A rhapsodic ending with cannons was breathtaking in the extreme.\n\nThe tumultuous standing ovation and cheers gave rise to three appropriate encores by Bizet from his piece for four hands entitled Jeux D'enfants. : La Toupie (The Spinning Top) La Poup√©e (The Doll) and Le Bal (The Ball),\n\nThis was followed by I think their own arrangement of classical standard melodies we could all recognize beneath the ornamentation. Finally a Siloti/Bach transcription.\n\nA remarkable and memorable evening of astonishing natural keyboard gifts. Classical music performed for the sheer musical entertainment value and wish to give unadulterated pleasure to the audience without the sacrifice of interpretative musicality of a high order.\n\nSUNDAY, 7 AUGUST\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 4.00 PM\n\nPiano recital\n\nJUAN P√âREZ FLORIST√ÅN\n\nFirst Prize at the 16th Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition Tel Aviv 2021\n\nFryderyk Chopin (1810‚Äí1849)\n\n24 Preludes, Op. 28 (1838‚Äì1839)\n\nEven if Chopin had not written anything but the preludes, he would have deserved immortality anyway.\n\nAnton Rubinstein\n\nThese poetic preludes are similar to those of a great contemporary poet that rock the soul in golden dreams and raise it to ideal regions.\n\nFranz Liszt\n\nEach of them is a prelude to a meditation [‚Ä¶] Music that eludes the world of matter and allows us to free ourselves from it.\n\nAndr√© Gide\n\nIn January 1839, after his Pleyel pianino had arrived from Paris, Chopin wrote to Julian Fontana ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll soon receive the Preludes and the Ballade‚Äô. And a few days after, when sending the manuscript of the Preludes: ‚ÄòIn a couple of weeks, you‚Äôll receive the Ballade, Polonaises and Scherzo.' So their conception took place in the atmosphere of a haunted monastery, threatened by untamed nature.\n\nIt would of course have been impossible for Chopin to have ever considered performing this complete radical cycle in his own musical and cultural environment (not least because of the brevity of many of the pieces). It is unlikely ever to have even occurred to him to do this, the way programmes were designed piecemeal at the time. I tend to feel the performance of them as a cycle is of course possible but not entirely justified. In some of his programmes and others of the period, a few preludes are scattered randomly through them like diamond dust. Each piece contains within it entire worlds and destinies of the human spirit and deserves individual attention rather than being a brick in a monumental edifice.\n\nIt is now well established by structuralists and Bach scholars as a complete and symmetrical work, a masterpiece of integrated yet unrelated ‚Äòfragments‚Äô (in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century sense of that aesthetic term). Each prelude can of course stand on its own as a perfect miniature landscape of emotional feeling and tonal climate. But ‚ÄòWhy Preludes? Preludes to what?‚Äô Andr√© Gide asked rather gratuitously. One possible explanation is that the idea of 'preluding' as an improvisational activity in the same key for a short time before a large keyboard work was to be performed was well established in Chopin's day but has been abandoned in modern times.\n\nThe Preludes surely extend the prescient Chopin remark 'I indicate, it's up to the listener to complete the picture'.\n\nI felt Florist√°n gave us a fine, virtuoso pianistic account of this popular cycle. He had clearly conceived of them as an integrated group of emotional landscapes. However, for me rather predictably straightforward without what one might term, an 'individual voice'. I will make only a brief comment on some of them as an analysis in detail of all might try your patience although each masterpiece deserves the deepest attention. There was insufficient hint of the haunted nature of some preludes, haunted by the ghosts of Valldemossa and the demons that inhabit our lives. The metaphysical underside of these works, the dark realities and contrasts in emotional turbulence were somewhat left untouched by the brilliant playing.\n\nNo. 1 in C major\n\nNo. 2 in A minor - few pianists plumb the utter despair in the face of the great reality of death, ultimately faced alone by each of us, that suffuses this spare, desolate masterpiece. Florist√°n was unsettling but ...\n\nNo. 3 in G major - a joyful respite\n\nNo. 4 in E minor No. 5 in D major No. 6 in B minor No. 7 in A major - all satisfyingly performed but I was yearning for more individuality, taking me beyond the printed score\n\nNo. 8 in F sharp minor - a brilliant account of this prelude\n\nNo. 9 in E major No. 10 in C sharp minor No. 11 in B major No. 12 in G sharp minor\n\nNo. 13 in F sharp major - the bel canto was alluring and beautiful\n\nNo. 14 in E flat minor No. 15 in D flat major No. 16 in B flat minor No. 17 in A flat major No. 18 in F minor\n\nNo. 19 in E flat major No. 20 in C minor No. 21 in B flat major No. 22 in G minor No. 23 in F major\n\nNo. 24 in D minor - I think with this work, the heavy hammer of irreversible destiny falls on deeply disturbed emotions that hinge on an awareness and premonition of death. To achieve this requires a particular vision not given to many, but a profound thought preoccupying Chopin.\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nFerenc Liszt (1811‚Äì1886)\n\nAnn√©es de P√®lerinage. Deuxi√®me ann√©es. \"Italie\" S. 161 (1838‚Äì1839)\n\nSposalizio\n\nSposalizio della Vergine (The Marriage of the Virgin) Raphael 1504\n\nFranz Liszt composed Sposalizio, which translates to Marriage in Italian, after being inspired by Raphael's painting the Marriage of the Virgin of 1504. Beginning Andante with the indication dolce the work develops into a variety of wedding march which concludes in a rand climax in difficult octaves. As too often with this pianist (and others) the relatively small Dworek found it difficult to accommodate to the almost oppressive dynamic inflation.\n\nIl pensieroso\n\nThis work (1838-1839) was inspired by the idealized introspective and melancholy Michelangelo sculpture that the Italian carved for the tombstone of Lorenzo de Medici, Duke of Urbino. The sculpture inspired many great artists over the centuries from the epic poem by John Milton to the British/American Painter Thomas Cole's painting Il pensieroso dating from 1845. Michelangelo depicts Lorenzo as an intellectual man lost in deep in thought. The seriousness of the sculpture gives rise to a rather gloomy musical work. I remained unsure why Florist√°n chose this work for his recital.\n\nRichard Wagner (1813‚Äì1883) /Ferenc Liszt (1811‚Äì1886)\n\nIsoldes Liebestod, S. 447\n\nRogelio de Egusquiza (1845-1915) Tristan and Iseult (1910)\n\nThis Spanish painter, known for his friendship with Richard Wagner, helped make his works familiar in Spain\n\nOne must not forget the constraints of instruments that brought about such transcriptions and the extraordinary service the selfless Liszt performed for keyboard players in the nineteenth century who were without ready access to an organ or the services of an orchestra. We are indeed richly endowed today and tend to forget this when maligning the great Ferenc for his generous transcriptions of everything under the sun.\n\nI felt this was a rather exaggerated musical performance by the Spanish pianist on the level of the psyche, embracing the fulfillment or 'peaceful release' offered by death, carried unresisting on the cresting wave of metaphysical and passionate love. Certainly the incandescent passions and travails of Latin Spanish love were well in evidence. The building of the erotic curve in a smooth, sensually rising line to the orgasmic climacteric, the apotheosis of the metaphysical symbiosis of love/death that Wagner embraces, is a tremendously demanding pianistic task to express, to discipline and to communicate effectively as he managed to do.\n\nWagner's debt to the harmonic adventurism of Liszt, the Tristan chord, is never in doubt to my mind. The work is a musical and personal challenge to depict this merging of the lovers in death, situated predominantly and 'deep darkly' in the mind of Wagner. The contrasts Florist√°n extracted and expressed were rather too extreme in range for me but perhaps after all is said and done, the heat of 'Spanish love', its transfiguration and expression through music depends on the filter of personal experience.\n\nFranz Schubert (1797‚Äì1828)\n\nWanderer Fantasy, Op. 15, D.760 (1822)\n\nAllegro con fuoco ma non troppo\n\nAdagio\n\nPresto\n\nAllegro\n\nThis work the composer based on his song Der Wanderer. This was a competent account of the Fantasy but I yearned for a more melodic and expressive legato line on some occasions. He stayed pretty well at the same dynamic which I found rather tiring. So many opportunities for poetry and expressiveness were missed and the conception of the work came across to me at least as rather prosaic.\n\nI felt he Florist√°n unfortunately had limited understanding of this work. Much of his playing could be described in the words of C.P.E Bach in his Versuch √ºber die wahre Art das Klavier zu spielen 1753 (Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments)\n\n‚ÄòThey overwhelm our hearing without satisfying it and stun the mind without moving it.‚Äô\n\nThe opening indicated he would be approaching this remarkably variegated work as purely a virtuoso piano piece. The dynamics only occasionally fell below forte or fortissimo except in the more lyrical, reflective central sections with rather rushed phrasing. However the ‚Äòinterpretation‚Äô, such as it was, for me displayed extraordinarily limited understanding of Schubert‚Äôs intentions in this piece ‚Äì the operatic nature of ‚ÄòThe Wanderer‚Äô passing thorough varied landscapes and the joyful and bitter experiences of life on his great journey through it. He wrote the work in 1822 only six years before his premature death. The work is surely a keyboard version of what might have been another great Schubert song cycle. The main theme in a hardly festive C-sharp minor actually taken from his song Der Wanderer. Perhaps far more background research on such a great work should be done before performance.\n\nI once heard the great pianist Alexander Melnikov at the Chopin i jego Europa Festival in Warsaw give a brilliant account of this work on a Conrad Graf piano which illuminated the shifting landscape and fluctuating moods in an unprecedented manner perfectly suited to Schubert. Conrad Graf (1782-1851) was an Austrian-German piano maker whose instruments were used by Beethoven, Chopin, Schubert and Clara Schumann among others. They were capable of extraordinary sonority and special effects.\n\nSchubert once wrote 'Happiness is where you are not...' and explaining that the 'Romantic soul is never happy where he is...' Schubert had an inferiority complex concerning Beethoven. The work is marked by grace, grandeur and nobility. At times unsettled, it would calm into glorious song full of human emotion. For me there is far too much use of this work as a showy virtuosic account.\n\nEncores:\n\nThe Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera (1916-1983)\n\nTwo Danzas Argentinas (Argentine Dances) Op. 2 from a set of three dances for solo piano written in 1937\n\nNo: 2 Danza de la moza donosa (Dance of the Donosa Girl) and No: 3 Danza del gaucho matrero (Dance of the Outlaw Cowboy) has directions such as furiosamente (furiously), violente (violent), mordento (biting), and salvaggio (wild). Here Ginastera left us in no doubt as how to perform this third dance.\n\nBoth were splendidly performed, No:3 simply astounding in its rhythmic insistence.\n\nSATURDAY, 6 AUGUST 2022\n\nCHOPIN MANOR 8.00 PM\n\nChamber concert\n\nRAFA≈Å BLECHACZ (piano)\n\nBOMSORI KIM (violin)\n\nClaude Debussy (1862‚Äì1918)\n\nViolin sonata in G minor (1917)\n\nClaude Debussy (1862‚Äì1918) was already suffering with the cancer which prematurely ended his life, when he began to compose his Violin Sonata in G minor, L140. He began to sketch the work in 1916 and completed it the following year. It was to be his final composition. He wrote rather self-effacingly 'It represents an example of what may be produced by a sick man in time of war‚Äô In this sonata he wished to be rather anti-German by emphasizing his national background by signing the score ‚ÄòClaude Debussy‚Äîmusicien fran√ßais‚Äô.\n\nThe first moment of sound of Bomsori Kim's magnificent violin (a 1774 Giovanni Battista Guadagnini instrument) revealed a profound richness of tone that can imitate a viola. The tension between the body of this brilliant South Korean violinist and her instrument produces a sound that was sheer musical magic.\n\nThe violinist‚Äôs chosen repertoire reflects her desire to communicate with her audiences through her instrument‚Äôs expressive voice: 'I‚Äôm not a loud person ‚Äì I usually don‚Äôt talk much in everyday life,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs why I love playing the violin, because I can speak and communicate through music. I‚Äôve loved singing and ballet since I was a small child and am always moved by hearing voices and watching dancers. I wanted to bring that special spir"
