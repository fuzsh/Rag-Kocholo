        "text": "SOURCE: “Różewicz at Seventy: Rebirth of a Survivor,” in Polish Review, Vol. XXXIX, No. 2, 1994, pp. 195–211.\n\n[In the following essay, Sokoloski reassesses Różewicz's work as the writer enters a new phase in his career upon turning seventy.]\n\nThe year 1991 marked Tadeusz Różewicz's seventieth birthday. In retrospect, it is clear that the occasion not only inaugurated an important renewal of interest in his works but, more significantly, may well have inspired a new phase in his writing. In May of that year, the University of Ottawa staged an international symposium devoted to Slavic Drama, a substantial portion of which dealt with problems of Różewicz's dramaturgy.1 In November, another major conference, devoted exclusively to Różewicz's art, was held at the University of Poznań.2 A month earlier, Różewicz received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wrocław.3 Literary periodicals, both in Poland and abroad, among others Dialog,4Teatr [Theater],5Notatnik Teatralny [Theatrical Notebook],6Odra [The Oder],7 and Slavic and East European Arts,8 published exclusive or partial theme issues. Two monographic works have appeared: Walka o oddech: o pisarstwie Tadeusza Różewicza [A Struggle for Breath: On the Writings of Tadeusz Różewicz] by Polish scholar Tadeusz Drewnowski,9 and A Laboratory of Impure Forms: The Plays of Tadeusz Różewicz by American scholar Halina Filipowicz.10 A volume of English translations of Różewicz's poetry was published by Adam Czerniawski.11 Różewicz himself in the last two years has come out with two books: Płaskorzeźba [Bas-relief],12 a collection of his poetry, and Nasz starszy brat [Our Older Brother],13 a compilation of poetry by his deceased brother, Janusz, which he personally edited and introduced. In addition, he has published a publicistic tract, “Sztuka nienapisana” [“The Unwritten Work”].14 A number of new individual poems have also been appearing in Twórczość [Creativity]15 and Odra;16 this author was recently informed in conversations with Różewicz that several more are to follow. Finally, the Teatr Polski [Polish Theater] of Wrocław staged three highly innovative productions of Różewicz's Pułapka [The Trap], Złowiony [Caught] and Kartoteka [The Card Index], the last under the author's personal direction.\n\nFor a number of reasons, these occurrences were long overdue. In a career spanning almost fifty years, Różewicz has exercised an important if not always congenial presence in Polish letters. During the preceding decade, however, but for the irregular publication of some individual poems, he had virtually withdrawn from art. The productivity that characterized his writing since the beginning of the post-Second World War period had virtually come to a halt. It is significant, therefore, that Różewicz's “silence” has ended. It is also meaningful that in Poland critical attitudes, often extreme in regard to Różewicz so as to deflect analysis into non-artistic concerns, have to an extent begun to change. A reassessment of Różewicz's contribution has long been advocated by scholars.17\n\nIt is ironic that an artist so consummately concerned with matters of artistic form has engendered such controversy as a result of his art's content (or lack thereof). The irony can partially be explained by the complex nature of Różewicz as an artist and a private individual, a dilemma which few Polish writers have been spared. The problem, however, is more involved and undoubtedly has its basis in difficulties relating to Różewicz's artistic contribution per se. That a reassessment of the author and his art against all of the above factors is presently underway, is clearly a step in the right direction.\n\nIn many ways, Różewicz is an enigma. Despite his considerable reputation nationally and internationally (he has received numerous distinctions and has been translated and performed in more than thirty languages, including Arabic and Chinese), he shuns the public eye and fiercely defends his private life, maintaining a Spartan lifestyle in a modest second-floor apartment in Wrocław. The erstwhile “classic” of Polish postwar literature is simultaneously the model of the “anonymous man,” as much a part of quotidian reality as the mothers of school-age children who, encouraged by his published telephone number, often call for assistance—and are given it—regarding the “correct” interpretation of his writings. Descended from a generation “contaminated by death,” Różewicz nonetheless retains a remarkable sense of humor that he unabashedly displays in a conducive social setting, not to mention in his creative writing. For all the criticism leveled at him by the literary establishment, the Roman Catholic Church, and, at times, even the larger reading public, his best critic—perhaps as an antidote—remains himself: his auto-ironic stance, often veiled in his humor, is unmistakable.\n\nHis private self is in many ways at odds with the artistic persona, and in Poland where a problematic relationship has always traditionally defined the two, this factor has likely contributed to much misunderstanding. In Różewicz, the two elements are irreconcilable. For all the care he displays in the artistic formulation of his works, once created, they are often viewed with detachment, more often with indifference. Were it not for some well-intentioned individuals close to Różewicz, it is likely that much of his literary archive would have long ago been lost.18 The further removed temporally from his work, the more reluctant the author is to speak of it in detail. His dislike of interviews is well known, and on the rare occasions he does speak of his art, whether informally or in writing, his comments are often contradictory and even self-parodistic. An incorrigible outsider, he has steadfastly avoided “camps,” “establishments” and institutions, literary and otherwise. Such a stance has inevitably invited opposition, given that the various demarcation lines have always been strongly drawn for him. Being apolitical is itself a political act.\n\nIt is Różewicz's writings, however, which remain the most problematic issue. Broadly speaking, Różewicz has sought to obliterate all formal boundaries of traditional art in the interest of creating forms anew. His poetry and drama often define each other, as certain aspects of one are more easily understood with reference to the other. Similarly, his eye is that of a painter manqué insofar as the visual often supplants verbal constructs in his poetry and plays. Dispossessed of a sense of cultural validation by the events of World War II, he metaphorically proclaims “the death of poetry” while at the same time exploring meta-poetically all means possible to revive a linguistic code that has been debased by reality, yet remains inextricably tied to it. Various individual attempts to “label” Różewicz have undoubtedly yielded valuable insights into his art, yet have failed by their very nature to encompass the contradictions at the basis of his artistic strategy—a fragmentary, volatile, and highly synthetic use of autonomous forms. Numerous appelations, ranging from “modernist,” “cubist,” “existentialist,” “postmodern,” even “classic,” are all duly justified, yet ultimately insufficient. Terms and epithets such as “anti-poetry,” “absolute transparency,” “reductivist,” “collage,” “happening,” “nonrepresentational,” “poetic drama,” “theatricalization of poetry,” and “non-consequential theater” have all only limited application. Forms are further blurred generically in his writings to the extent that he struggles, as it were, not to write verses or plays, creating instead poems devoid of “poetry” and dramatic texts that stubbornly resist transcription and performance. Language and art often turn inward in his works, the result being that his poems and plays at times constitute an unending dialog with themselves and past traditions, often characterized by confusing orgies of intertextual quotation, self-quotation and deliberate misquotation.\n\nThough always subordinate to his formal concerns, Różewicz's themes are no less perplexing. What initially seem indisputable transparencies often prove on closer reading to be opaque and many-layered; otherwise innocuous words like “beginning” (początek), “end” (koniec), “return” (powrót), “light” (światło), “shadow” (cień), and “nothing/Nothing” (nic/Nic) are all mots à clé which relate to a much larger sequencing of complex philosophical dimensions. Personages such as “Hero” (Bohater), “Old Woman” (Stara kobieta) and “Anonymous” (Anonim), reappearing throughout his dramas and verses, all function in similar fashion. In a broad sense, one can speak of pervasive and unwavering thematic motifs that inform all of Różewicz's writings (cultural disinheritance, demythologizing), yet at the same time one may also trace an historical evolution and expansion of certain key concerns. The immediate postwar period (1946–1958), for example, was characterized by Różewicz's introduction of a new verse form (the so-called “Różewicz Variant” [Wiersz różewiczowski] that enabled writers to deal artistically with the war experience and effectively “create poetry after Auschwitz.” The period has been well-documented by critics and remains somewhat less problematic. The succeeding period, roughly from 1960–1981, saw the expression of a number of larger more universal concerns in his work: the rapid growth of mass culture and the ensuing suppression of the individual, the search for a secular form of ethical/spiritual legitimacy to replace outmoded models (“Nothing”), the effects of consumerism, the place of art and the artist in a changing society, ecological concerns. In his effort to denounce the old and formulate the new, it was during this middle phase that Różewicz introduced some of his most radical postulations (especially in regard to dramatic form, but also in his poetry), while at the same time incurring the wrath of some of his most formidable critics. Conversely, the term “tragic nihilism” (nihilizm tragiczny) perhaps most aptly categorized what was perceived by many as Różewicz's artistic impotence during this time. While much of the criticism ensued, Różewicz's reaction (1982–1991) was silence.\n\nToday, the whole “Różewicz affair,” as it has been described by one observer,19 insofar as it involves the need for criticism to adopt an effective and meaningful approach to an important contemporary writer, seems to have come full circle. A welcome sign in this process is the above-mentioned work by Halina Filipowicz.\n\nAn American Slavist of Polish origin, Filipowicz in her book proposes a solution to the “affair” above all by providing perspectives on Różewicz's dramatic art that are not only fresh and extremely well-informed, but also “pure” in respect to the author's conscious decision to situate her comments exclusively within the text. In effect, to let art by art. Her conclusions give much cause for thought.20\n\nThe result is a thorough exegesis, rich in bibliographical detail, that proceeds linearly on the basis of a historical-interpretive approach across Różewicz's entire dramatic canon. Each chapter reinforces the point that Różewicz's strategy is deliberately and consistently conceptual in nature, emphasizing more the process and perceived goal, rather than the mere product. The author's individual plays are segregated according to chapter headings: “Subverting a Heroic Myth” (Dead and Buried, The Card Index, Spaghetti and the Sword); “Dismantling Domestic Drama” (The Laocoon Group, He Left Home, On All Fours); “A Postmodern Trilogy” (The Interrupted Act, Birth Rate, The Guards); “Our Little Stabilization” (The Witnesses, The Old Woman Broods); and “Drama Born of Literature” (A Funeral Polish Style, Departure of a Hunger Artist, The Trap, White Marriage). The synthetic approach which Filipowicz pursues, attempting to isolate and then inter-relate the disparate forms and themes found in Różewicz's dramas, breaks important new ground for further critical analysis.\n\nIn the opening chapter, “Różewicz's Dramaturgy: Context and Method,” Filipowicz describes the essence and objective of Różewicz's art as “the urge to represent experience … and … the limit that literacy conventions place on experience” (p. 5). The definition is apt and attests to Różewicz's importance as a leading contemporary writer much preoccupied with the relationship between textual and actual reality, a central post-modernist concern. This affinity, which is clearly enunciated by Filipowicz in the chapter “A Postmodern Trilogy,” is one of the most meaningful observations of the book. More importantly, however, it advances a conclusion that is implied, though not specifically stated.\n\nA central theme of Różewicz's art is the limiting of experience by language. His subsequent elaboration of this idea, however, also points to a fundamental crisis of contemporary post-modernist thought: language that turns inward to discover new truths about reality leads inadvertently to the cul-de-sac of mimesis, for the state of reality it depicts is no more than a mirror image of itself, one that is fragmentary, self-referential, “de-constructed.” Despite a contrary artistic strategy insofar as the post-modern deliberately exposes fictive methodologies, as opposed to hiding them as realism had done, the results are in the end one and the same. Though mutually in conflict, art and reality are inextricably linked. What separates Różewicz from other post-modernist writers in this regard is the fact that his strategy, while appearing to undermine and subvert obsolete values thereby “de-constructing” from them “new” ones, is in reality a radical attempt to create a wholly new form of moral and spiritual sanction with no recourse whatsoever to previous models, all of which for him had ceased to exist long ago. The creation, or “pre- construction” perhaps, of an all-embracing ethical/spiritual Leviathan from seemingly worthless non-referential “impure forms,” a “sacrum novum” that ignores even de-constructed models of former ideological or metaphysical coordinates, is what in fact comprise Różewicz's notion of “Nothing” (Nic). The basis for such a new ordering, Różewicz would argue, is to be conceived and formulated entirely from within the individual.\n\nThus, for all of Różewicz's enormous “play-giarizing” of both himself and other writers, I would argue that his larger intent is more pre-creative than subversively re-creative (which Filipowicz also does, though in another context, p. 29), and that to this extent Różewicz has perhaps transcended even post-modernism. I strongly suspect that Różewicz's period of silence in the eighties was in no small way the result of the magnitude of the task he had set himself. Filipowicz's work is an indispensable tool for locating this task in the larger confines of Różewicz's “oeuvre.”\n\nPłaskorzeźba, containing twenty-six poems that had been individually published in various journals during Różewicz's “silence,” are as the title implies, poems conceived from the other side of poetry. The collection is both a farewell to poetry and a proclamation of poetry in various forms, many of which have been seen before in Różewicz but are here more fully developed and formulated. Poetry about poetry. Poetry beyond poetry. Poetry of “Nothing.” Poetry of silence.\n\nThat the collection represents an important transitional stage for Różewicz is implied by the novel physical format of the edition. Despite the enormous financial difficulties facing publishers of “serious” literature in Poland today, Wydawnictwo Dolnośląskie produced a somewhat extravagant 136-page volume that is conceptually brilliant. The glossed front and back hard covers create the illusion of a single slab of gray marble with Różewicz's name and the title carved in bold Roman cursives. Opening the volume, one sees four photographs of the poet on opposite sides of both inner flaps: the front two show a passive, contemplative poet seated at his work desk, head in hand, and standing before a rubbish heap, hat in hand; the back two show a more engaged poet seated again at his desk, his hand reaching for something, and at the same rubbish heap, carrying more rubbish to place on the pile. His hat is worn, two pigeons observe from a distance. The poems in the volume are printed in the same cursive style accompanied by all of the author's handwritten drafts, complete with corrections and instructions, appearing opposite the published versions. Several graphics by the noted Polish artist Jerzy Tchórzewski are reproduced throughout, along with a drawing by the author entitled “The Poet as Optimist, the Poet as Pessimist.”\n\nPłaskorzeźba is more than simply a volume of poetry; it would seem that the book itself is trying to say something. Is the cover a tombstone? Is Różewicz announcing metaphorically once again “The Death of Poetry?” Does “the death of poetry” mean literally its death? Or does it imply, as it did in his controversial article of 1966,21 its death and rebirth, conceived in meta-poetic terms? Does the drama played out by the four pictures of Różewicz suggest a poet no longer silent and inactive? Do the imperfect handwritten versions of the poems placed alongside their published counterparts suggest that the real poems of the volume are somewhere in between? Is the poet pessimistic or optimistic? Finally, is it significant that the poet entitled the publicistic tract that preceded this volume “The Unwritten Work”? And is it significant that in the work that followed, Our Older Brother, the poet returned to the most painful period of his private life, the war? The “Beginning,” the period in which his mature artistic life began? At this juncture, it is perhaps too early to answer all of these questions?\n\nThe opening poem of the collection, “Bez” [“Without”], recapitulates the foundations of Różewicz's artistic and philosophical past, his loss of all ethical pre-determinants and the subsequent angst. The theme is again repeated in “Einst hab ich die Muse gefragt …”:\n\nnajwiększym wydarzeniem w życiu człowieka są narodziny i śmierć Boga ….. życie bez boga jest możliwe życie bez boga jest niemożliwe\n\n(“Bez,” 1–4, 14–15)\n\nthe greatest events in a man's life are the birth and death of God ….. life without god is possible life without god is impossible\n\n(“Without”)\n\nlecz ten co przyszedł po Końcu nie otrzymał odpowiedzi ….. odarty przez czarnego anioła z wiary nadziei miłości znalazłem się na drodze pustej ciemnej wyziębionej\n\n(“Einst hab ich die Muse gefragt …” 3–5, 15–19)\n\nbut he who came after the End received no answer ….. torn by a dark angel from faith hope love I found myself on a road made empty dark no longer warm\n\nFor Różewicz, the destruction of all moral and cultural coordinates also implied the end of poetry, insofar as it was able to inform reality. This ubiquitous theme in his verse reappears in Plaskorzeźba, and the impotency of poetic language is emphasized:\n\njałowa siła zacienia obszary języka\n\nw kącie na gazecie leżą rozgotowane wiersze lingwistyczne dydaktyczne patriotyczne religijne i inne\n\n(“więc jednak żyje się pisząc wiersze za długo?”, 1–8)\n\na hollow force darkens areas of language on newsprint in the corner overcooked verses linguistic ones tendentious patriotic religious ones and more lie\n\n(“Can one live too long writing verse?” 1–8)\n\nmarnieje religia filozofia sztuka\n\nmaleją naturalne zasoby języka\n\nto co zostało wystarczy jeszcze dla felietonistów z “Tygodnika Powszechnego” i “Polityka” dla dziennikarzy kapłanów urzędników\n\n(“Wygasnięcic Absolutu niszczy …” 1–10)\n\nreligion philosophy art are perishing\n\nthe natural store of language grows small\n\nwhat remains serves columnists of “Universal Weekly” and “Politics” journalists priests administrators\n\n(“The Disappearance of an Absolute destroys …” 1–10)\n\nIn his plays, Różewicz often focuses on the difficulties of dramatic creation, at times even on the impossibilities. In Płaskorzeźba, the same attitude is revealed in respect to poetry. In the opening line of “jeszcze próba” [“further attempt at a poem”], he rhetorically asks whether his poem will be successful, then proceeds to illustrate why it cannot. In an indirect allusion to “The Unwritten Work” mentioned above, he muses on the value of poetry that results in failed efforts, as in “Biedny August von Goethe” [“Poor August von Goethe”], or poetry that never materializes because the poet is more absorbed in the necessary, albeit distracting, process of reading, as in “Czytanie książek” [“Reading Books”]. “Poemat równoczesny” [“Contemporaneous Poem”] and “Kredowe koło” [“Circle of Chalk”] are varying considerations on the theme of linear and fluid time in poetry. In one of his more personal efforts, “rozmowa z Przyjacielem” [“Conversation with a Friend”], he delves into a form of magic realism and contemplates poetic conception from the life beyond.\n\nRealizing the constraints imposed on poetry by language, he offers formal solutions by alluding to a number of radical non-verbal possibilities, including silence, infinity, meaninglessness, formlessness, even outright resignation:\n\npoezja nie zawsze przybiera formę wiersza\n\npo pięćdziesięciu latach pisania poezja może się objawić poecie w kształcie drzewa odlatującego ptaka światła\n\nprzybiera kształt ust gnieżdzi się w milczeniu albo żyje w poecie pozbawiona formy i treści\n\n(“poezja nie zawsze …”)\n\npoetry needn't always take the form of a poem\n\nafter fifty years poetry may appear to the poet shaped like a tree a departing bird a light\n\nit takes the shape of lips nests in silence\n\nor lives in the poet unformed meaningless\n\n(“poetry needn't always …”)\n\nna początku jest słowo wielka radość tworzenia\n\npo końcu wiersza zaczyna się nieskończoność\n\n(“na początku …” 1–6)\n\nin the beginning is the word the great joy of creation\n\nat the end of the poem infinity begins\n\n(“in the beginning …” 1–6)\n\ndawniej czuwałem w każdej chwili mogła mnie napaść poezja biegłem do utraty tchu za obrazem który się poruszył\n\nteraz pozwalam wierszom uciekać ode mnie marnieć zapominać zamierać\n\nżadnego ruchu w stronę realizacji\n\n(“teraz”)\n\nbefore I felt\n\nthat any moment poetry might assail me I ran til breathless after any image that moved\n\nnow I let poems escape me fade vanish be forgotten\n\nwith no movement toward realization\n\n(“now”)\n\ntrzeba mieć odwagę aby napisać coś takiego piękno jest prawdą prawda jest piękną\n\nprzecież to słynna formuła Keatsa uśmiechnął się do mnie pobłażliwie znawca\n\ntrzeba przyznać że Keats miał odwagę ale lepiej gdyby tego nie powiedział\n\n(“co⋅ takiego”)\n\nbeauty is truth truth is beauty it takes courage to write such thoughts\n\nwhy, that was Keats' famous formula The expert gave me a knowing smile\n\nthere's no doubt Keats was courageous still I wish he'd never said it\n\n(“the very thought”)\n\nThe most complex poem on poetry in the entire collection is undoubtedly “Poemat autystyczny” [“Autistic Poem”]. The verse is also a generic hybrid that combines a meta-poetic subject with elements drawn from the form of the dramatic monologue and literary interview, all parodied and subjected to distortions and reductions in the temporal, spatial and linguistic spheres. The poem, which is placed second-to-last in the collection, seems to indicate the direction in which Różewicz's verse is leading: to a state of maximal compression with reference exclusively to the banality and hollowness of everyday—to nothing (“Nothing”?). It concludes as follows:\n\n—dlaczego nie zabiera pan głosu\n\npoeta milczy poeta idzie\n\nświat zredukowany jest zawsze bardziej skupiony\n\nzredukowany do samego siebie siedzę na dworcu kolejowym\n\nna czym koncentrujemy naszą uwagę? na niczym Św. Jan od Krzyża niezmącony spokój domu Św. Teresa z Awili nie ma mistycznego uniesienia bez umysłowej pustki Kartezjusz (otworzył okno) spodziewał się ujrzeć ludzi zdążających ulicami chapeaux et manteaux: rien de plus\n\n—why don't you speak\n\nthe poet is silent the poet goes\n\na world made smaller is always more dense\n\ncondensed to myself I sit in a railway station\n\nto what do we turn our attention to nothing St. John of the Cross the unbroken peace of home St. Teresa of Avila there is no mystical rapture without intellectual void Descartes (opening his window) looked to see people pacing the streets chapeaux et manteaux rien de plus\n\nAs in most collections of Różewicz's poetry, a disparity of themes is apparent. In Płaskorzeźba, three noteworthy poems in this regard are “czarne plamy şͣ biale …” [“black spots are white …”], “Myrmekologia” [“Myrmecology”] and “Świnobicie” [“On the Killing of Pigs”]. The first is a powerful anti-war tract conceived in the spirit as “Dezerterzy” [“Deserters”], also written and published in the eighties (though why this excellent poem was not included in Płaskorzeźba is unknown); the latter two deal with cruelty toward animals and were likely inspired by Różewicz's reading of Wittgenstein.\n\nEdward Czerwiński, an American Slavist, devoted an entire issue of Slavic and East European Arts to English translations (his own) of Różewicz's recent poetry. The compilation, subtitled “Bas-relief and Other Poems,” includes all of the poems contained in Płaskorzeźba, along with several others from earlier periods, including “Złowiony” [“Caught”] and “Duszyczka” [“Animula”]. Also provided is a short judicious introduction. Unfortunately, Czerwiński's translations are marred by a number of infelicities, in fact too many to be discussed in detail in this article. A disturbing number of editorial oversights also hamper the edition.\n\nThe errors begin on the table of contents. Listed on page 30 is a poem supposedly entitled “living poetry touched him.” The “poem” is, in fact, part of another poem, “Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland,” which is listed on the previous page.\n\nLapses also often occur in relation to the spacing on the page of certain parts of poems. It is evident from Różewicz's handwritten drafts that the physical appearance of a poem is of tantamount importance. While translators may take license, as do poets, in certain instances it would seem that this is not the case in Bas-relief and Other Poems. For instance, in the poem “black spots are white,” the key refrain “a child was born / with four legs / a calf was born / with two wings” (lines 26–29), is not separated from the lines that follow, although Różewicz's manuscript clearly indicates that it should be. The same error is made in the concluding two lines of this poem, and in the final two lines of “The Chalk Circle.” Conversely, a space is unjustifiably inserted between lines 34–35 of “Pig Sticking.” An important error occurs in the title of the poem “Kredowe koło.” In the original, Różewicz has inserted a short inscription, “Przepisalem dnia 7 lutego 1988 roku” [I re-wrote this on February 7, 1988], as an appended piece of information. In the English translation, Czerwiński has made the inscription a part of the title proper, rather than relegating it to a more inconspicuous position. On page 44 (line 5), “Casanova” becoming “Gasanova” is symptomatic of annoying misprints that appear in several places.\n\nGenerally, Czerwiński's translations are literally correct, although several clear mistranslations do occur. On page 19, he renders “coś podobnego” as “something like that,” although it is evident from the poem that Różewicz is using this title in its idiomatic sense of “Imagine that!” or “The very thought!” On page 20, “co ze sobą zabrać / na tamten brzeg” clumsily appears as “what to take with you / on that other shore” instead of “what's one to take / to that other shore.” Two lines later in the same poem, the Polish original “więc to już / wszystko / mamo” incorrectly appears as the incomprehensible “then it's time / everything / mama” instead of perhaps “then, that's / all / mother.” On page 21, it would appear that the translator has not understood the phrase “przez zoila” (line 3), which he renders as “by zoilean” (?). The Polish term refers to an overzealous and unfair critic, coined after such a personage in antiquity named Zoilos. A more apt rendering might be: “by some Zoilos.” In the three lines that follow, it is clear from the sense that “krwawi / z języka / spada” cannot be translated as “bleeds / from the tongue / falls,” but rather as “bleeds / falls / from the tongue.” On page 22 (line 13), the original “miłość” becomes “live” rather than “love.” In “To Peter” (p. 48), the Polish “w kraju i zagranicą” becomes “in the country and abroad” (line 30), rather than “at home and abroad.” Later in the same poem (p. 49), the incomprehensible “pono ironic” is used to translate the Polish “pono ironiczny,” which might be better served by “pseudo-ironic” or “how nearly ironic.” On page 51, the penultimate line of the poem appears as “you can write to Lea now,” translated from the Polish “możesz już pisać na Lea.” The translator has in fact mistaken a street for a person. A correct rendering would be: “you can now write to me on Leo street,” the street referring to an address Różewicz once shared with Kornel Filipowicz (and Wisława Szymborska, who also appears in the poem) while residing in Cracow. On page 52, “strawiłem życie” oddly appears as “I consumed my life” rather than perhaps “I wasted away my life.” A little later in the same poem (line 44), a “cricket” rather than a “grasshopper” is used to translate “konik polny.” Again in the same poem (line 17), a twelve-year-old playmate (“dwunastoletni kolega”) suddenly becomes eight years older and appears as a “twenty-year old friend.”\n\nAnother irritating aspect found in the translations is a penchant to lapse into a colloquial idiom, and at times even into slang. Also, a number of stilted passages were noticed. In the otherwise lofty and reverent poem “bez” [“without”], the Polish “a może pokarałeś mnie / małego ciemnego za upor” unfortunately becomes “or maybe You punished me / a little greenhorn (!) for my stubbornness” (p. 15, lines 32–33). Similarly, “a więc to tylko tyle” comes across as “and so only so much” (p. 20, line 11), rather than perhaps “there's no more, then” or “then, that's all there is.” Occasionally, bad English creeps in, as “pozbawiono … / … instynktu życia” becomes “people were deprived … / … of the instinct of (!) life” (p. 26, lines 6–7). On the first line of page 28, the otherwise innocuous “czy wiersz się uda” appears as the swank-sounding “will the poem pan out.” On the same page (lines 7–8), the Polish “wiersz … / … do nieba wzięty” evokes a strange image when in English it becomes “a poem … / … elated (!) to the sky.” A wrong tense suggested by a faux ami in Polish results in inelegant-sounding English, as in “For several months now / my friend / Kornel Filipowicz / is (!) in that other world” (p. 50, lines 1–4).\n\nA number of revisions to the translations would provide a welcome contribution to the growing amount of primary sources in foreign languages.\n\nTo conclude: it is important at this juncture that recent events have raised several new and pressing questions. More significantly, the availability of new materials, primary and secondary, argue convincingly for more innovative perspectives on Różewicz and his work. One need only compare the pessimism of his concluding words of his “post factum” to the poem “przerwana rozmowa” [“interrupted conversation”], written in 1989: “I'm now sixty-nine years old. The time for farewells is at hand.” (Mam 69 lat. Nadchodzi czas pożegnań.), to the renewed vigor, and characteristic wink, that Różewicz the artist expressed in the opening of his “Unwritten Work,” two years later, to speculate that Różewicz and his art have entered a new phase:\n\nNew art is created by discovering new form, new expression, new language and syntax—not by venting noble declarations, promulgating otherwise legitimate political views, signing letters and protest forms, or by professing to be filled with the noblest of human and humanistic sentiments. A committed artist is an artist committed to the struggle for new form … content is everyone's birthright. … We often hear today that anyone can be an artist or poet, that everything passes for poetry. Yes, all is poetry—except bad verse.22\n\nIt is comforting to know that his most recent poem to date, composed on June 20, 1993, and still unpublished, begins and ends in the following manner:\n\nOd jutra się zmienię Taki od jutra …. bo mamy już pierwsze dni lata 1993 roku a ja … (ale to już moja tajemnica).\n\nStarting tomorrow I'll change Yes, starting tomorrow …. for it's already the first part of summer 1993 and I … (but let that be my secret)(23)\n\nAs inevitably happens in respect to Różewicz, the discussion must remain open. …\n\nNotes\n\nSee A.
