The focus is solely on nature and its enormity.\n\nNatural vistas, whether experienced in her home country or on her extensive travels, are an infinite source of inspiration for Dounis. The result is that some paintings can easily be associated with familiar Mediterranean landscapes, others are inspired by Nordic or other faraway scenes.\n\nReverie, curated by Charlene Vella, is open until the end of November.\n\nMemory by Jo Dounis\n\nArt exhibition in aid of Id-Dar tal-Providenza\n\nAn exhibition featuring paintings, sculptures and ceramics donated by Maltese and foreign artists is open at the Parliament building in Valletta.\n\nThese artworks will be eventually auctioned online as part of the Festa ta’ Ġenerożità, an annual celebration in aid of Id-Dar tal-Providenza.\n\nThe exhibition runs until November 30. The public can visit from Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm and on the weekend between 9am and 12.30pm. One has to present their ID card.\n\nThe catalogue of all the works of art and more information on the auction are available on www.dtpauction.com or www.belgraviaauctions.com.\n\nThe Festa ta Ġenerożità will take place at the home’s Siġġiewi car park on January 1 and everyone is invited to attend.\n\nSome of the works on display at the Parliament foyer.

The iconography and imagery from the primordial period are reinterpreted by Bonaci and her curatorial team, with the artworks in dialogue with artefacts from the period as well as other contemporary objects.\n\nBonaci also draws from her personal experience of family bonding, femininity, recent social history, child bearing and motherhood presenting a dialogue between past and present.\n\nThe exhibition, curated by Sarah Chircop and supported by Arts Council Malta, runs until December 2. A curatorial walk and publication launch will be held on November 15.\n\nAn artwork by Rebecca Bonaci on display at Spazju Kreattiv.\n\nFroġa / Farrago\n\nSebastian Tanti Burlò is exhibition a collection of oil paintings at Sliema’s R Gallery.\n\nThe artist is known for his political cartoons in the Times of Malta but here he swaps his pen for the brush while retaining his unapologetic social commentary, a flair for the absurd, satirical strokes and an underlying subversive narrative. Nature, journalism and the world’s issues are represented in this exhibition.\n\nThe tragicomical is investigated through an ideal romantisation of our country and how society has evolved, together with comments on world issues that trouble the world at large.\n\nThe exhibition, hosted at R Gallery of 26, Tignè Street, Sliema, runs until December 3. For more information, read this Times of Malta review.\n\nDaphne's Garden No. 3 by Sebastian Tanti Burlò\n\nEye Sea You\n\nOne of Trevor Diacono's works\n\nArtist Trevor Diacono is presenting his latest collection of works at Il-Kamra ta' Fuq in Mqabba.\n\nDiacono comes from a family of artists that includes his grandfather Victor Diacono, one of Malta’s foremost 20th-century sculptors, and his uncle, Andrew Diacono, a name that needs no introduction among local art aficionados.\n\nThe artist claims that he sees his journey “as a continuous, often tormenting pursuit to translate the intangible depths of emotion and perception into tangible, three-dimensional form”.\n\nHe pusues his artistic family’s legacy that explores the caricatural in society and beyond. In this exhibition, he carries this on in his sculptures of fish, humanising them with their witty titles. The underlying theme is the marine, including even undulating waves.\n\nEye Sea You, curated by Melanie Erixon, is on from November 11 until December 3.\n\nPathos\n\nChris Ebejer is presenting a new collection of works in various media that include terracotta, bronze porcelain and marble at MUŻA in Valletta.\n\nThe artist's source of inspiration is mythology and gods, and the Mediterranean spirit. The figurative sculptures, as well as the reliefs, are the result of long hours of deep thought.\n\nThe sculptor worked on these works both in Malta and Italy, the latter of which is where he spends long periods of time working in bronze and marble.\n\nPathos runs until December 10. Entrance is free and opening hours are Monday to Sunday from 10am to 6pm.\n\nA sculpture by Chris Ebejer\n\nEmotions of the Spirit\n\nA collection of 28 works by Ivan Grixti is open for visitors at Level O, SkyParks Business Centre, MIA, Luqa, until the end of December.\n\nWorks include several portraits, including a self-portrait, that of homeless men and of Pope Benedict.

Other exhibits include a batch of royal teaware items that were unearthed in 1987 at the ancient Buddhist Famen Temple in northwest Shaanxi and a modern reprinted thread-bound edition of The Classic of Tea, considered to be the first known monograph on tea in the world, written by Lu Yu between 760 CE and 762 CE, during the Tang Dynasty.\n\nOne may visit the exhibition, which will remain open until the end of this year at the China Cultural Centre, 173, Melita Street, Valletta. The centre is open Monday to Friday from 9.30am to noon, and from 1.30 to 4pm. Entrance is free. Reservation is advised for group visits at events2023ccc@gmail.com.\n\nFare Convito: The Archaeology of Banqueting in Hospitaller Malta (16th to 18th century)\n\nA range of maiolica and porcelain vessels, used both for display and for serving food during formal banquets in Hospitaller Malta, is being exhibited at the Romegas Hall, National Museum of Archaeology, until the end of December.\n\nThe exhibition, entitled Fare Convito: The Archaeology of Banqueting in Hospitaller Malta (16th to 18th century), delves deeply into how food, art and politics came together in the ritual of baroque banqueting – the formal and communal sharing of food and drink – between the 16th and the 18th century in Malta.\n\nDuring that period, under the Order of St John, Malta imported many aspects of the European dining culture, mainly from Renaissance Italy and from Rococo France. An especially striking feature was the Convito – the formal banquet – which provided a theatrical backdrop for political discussion and intrigue.\n\nThey include two late Renaissance plates belonging to Cardinal Farnese’s famous credenza, a Chinese Ming porcelain import to Malta, important examples of South Italian heraldic plates, and a wide range of French and North Italian faience, including examples in the Rococo style of Moustier.\n\nAdmission is free. The exhibition will move to the Inquisitor’s Palace in Vittoriosa from January until March 2024. A booklet will be available for sale at both exhibitions.\n\nwhatson@timesofmalta.com"
