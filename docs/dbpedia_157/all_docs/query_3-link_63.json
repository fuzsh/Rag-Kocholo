        "text": "The Vienna Boys' Choir is the world's most famous boys' choir. Its roots trace back to 1498 (!), and among the choir's former members, you'll find classical giants like Mozart, Haydn, and Franz Schubert. Now, the choir is making a rare guest appearance at the Concert Hall, featuring Swedish music!\n\nThe diverse programme showcases many facets of the choir, with much of the music specially arranged for this occasion. Before the interval, the classical dominates with music by Purcell, Mozart, Schubert, Verdi, and Orff, among others. And, of course, there's the quintessential Viennese with both Strauss waltzes and a polka.\n\nAfter the interval, there are also some Swedish elements, such as Gabriella's Song from the film As It Is in Heaven, and ABBA's Mamma Mia and Thank You for the Music. Perhaps not what one might expect from the Vienna Boys' Choir! This part also includes jazz, musicals, and even Italian crooning – Volare (actually titled Nel blu dipinto di blu) and O Sole Mio!\n\nTickets go on sale 22 August 2024 11:00"
