This time I decided to combine the roles of a composer, pianist and producer and the vast majority of this music - with the exception of grand piano part - I have recorded at my new home studio. I invited amazing musicians - with whom I collaborate the most and who became my close friends: countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński, guitarist Łukasz Kuropaczewski, cellist Marcin Zdunik, folk flutist Michał Żak and horn player Konrad Gołda. The pieces of „Magnolia” are cinematic and the whole album has a soundtrack structure. As a producer, my approach to these compositions is manifested by the use of various modern post-production techniques. Some pieces I wrote in a way that one musician performs several parts. E.g. in „Cedar Tree” Jakub Józef Orliński sings several layers, forming the whole vocal ensemble.\n\nAleksander Dębicz"
