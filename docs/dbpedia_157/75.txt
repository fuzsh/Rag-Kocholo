Jakub Józef Orlínski

The Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orlínski turns halls upside down. He only graduated from New York's Juilliard School in 2017, and since then his international career has taken off. Baroque music has stolen his heart, he is a welcome guest at many early music companies, but when he can, Orlínski enjoys break dancing or appears in commercials for well-known fashion brands. His debut in Het Concertgebouw was in 2022.

#LetsBaRock with piano, bass and drums

For his performance in the Main Hall, Jakub Józef Orlínski collaborates with pianist and arranger Aleksander Dębicz. Together they bring the most beautiful baroque repertoire to 'a completely new level'. Well-known arias are given a 21st century pop twist. That's why Orlínski and Dębicz are joined by two of the best musicians from the Polish pop scene: drummer Marcin Ułanowski and bassist Wojciech Gumiński. The four of them take the audience into the 'new baroque' during #LetsBaRock . Purcell's 'Music for a while', Monteverdi's 'Oblivion soave' and Handel's 'Pena tiranna' like you've never heard them before!
