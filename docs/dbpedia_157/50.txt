Join us for the piano recital by ALEKSANDER DĘBICZ, one of Poland’s most versatile pianists and composers. The recital will feature the artist’s compositions and improvisations on works by F. Chopin.

Alexander Dębicz’s two main points of departure are improvisation and his original music, which he frequently combines with the works of old classical masters. His love of film music, reflected for years in his output, marks a key direction in his current activity as a composer.

His 2015 debut album Cinematic Piano (Warner Classics) featured a cycle of 12 original pieces inspired by films. Since then, Dębicz has composed music for films, radio dramas, and theatrical spectacles, establishing collaborations with, among others, Warsaw’s Polish and Jewish Theatres and Cracow’s Słowacki Theatre. His music for the Polish Radio drama Anna Karenina (dir. Katarzyna Michałkiewicz) was awarded at the Two Theatres Festival in 2019.
