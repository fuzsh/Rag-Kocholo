‘Together Forever on Wheels’ incorporates two of Gillie and Marc’s most popular sculpture themes, Rabbitwoman and Dogman, Vespas, and coffee.

Since they met while travelling, adventure and exploring have been a huge inspiration in their work. The artists have a soft spot for Vespas because it gives them an excuse to hold tightly to one another.

Rabbitwoman takes the lead on the bike while Dogman gets cosy in the sidecar next to her, trusting her to take him somewhere incredible. With a seat on the back of the bike, this sculpture is interactive, allowing the public to jump on and be part of Rabbitwoman and Dogman’s next adventure.

This amazing sculpture has been installed in major cities across the world to show love and acceptance and is part of the ‘Travel Everywhere With Love’ project.
