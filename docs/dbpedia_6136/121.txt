Meet Vinsen Faris, our Chief Executive Officer |email | LinkedIn

For Vinsen, making a difference is as simple as that. A giver at heart, Vinsen deeply believes in giving back. Every day at Meals on Wheels, Vinsen knows that they are helping to make a positive difference in people’s lives. With a degree from the University of Texas at Arlington and a rich experience in the food service and hospitality field, he learned the importance of customer service and satisfaction and has been prepped for a lifelong journey in the 'people' business.

In his free time, Vinsen loves to read or simply be outdoors. His family has a place in Llano County where they can stomp through the woods, walk in the pasture, or read a book on the back porch. There’s no better R&R. And when it comes to favorite Meals on Wheels dishes, the cornbread chili bowl is Vinsen's absolute favorite. From the slightly spicy chili to the slight sweetness of the cornbread, it doesn’t get any better!

If you could have dinner with any historical figure and share your favorite meal together, who would it be and what would you eat?

TR with some BBQ, including brisket, pork sausage, chicken, and cabrito. Maybe eat on the ground near the campfire!

Meet Forrest Myane, our Chief Strategy and Development Officer | email | LinkedIn

Forrest grew up with a mom who ran a nonprofit, so she didn't know there were other career options! She loves working at Meals on Wheels because, no matter what happens in the day, they fed thousands of seniors who may not have another option for food, and that is always rewarding. Forrest's degree in Radio, Television, and Film comes in handy as she figures out the best ways to communicate with community partners.

Forrest has had the privilege of working at several incredible San Antonio organizations, including Christian Assistance Ministries, Autism Community Network, and the Witte Museum. In her free time, she loves to cook, bake, and read. When she's not chasing her toddler around, she enjoys tackling projects around the house and sewing clothes for herself and her daughter.

Forrest's favorite Meals on Wheels dish is the chili and cornbread bowl (Spoiler Alert: you’ll be seeing this meal pop up as you read more!)

If you could have a baking competition with any celebrity chef, who would it be and what dish would you challenge them with?

After discussing strategy and the logistics behind choosing a great baker or a beginner, Forrest decided to challenge Claire Saffitz, primarily as “an opportunity to learn and improve on her skills”. The pastry she would want to do is laminated dough (a.k.a. a croissant).

Would you rather have a retirement fund that paid out in gourmet meals or one that provided an endless supply of your favorite dessert?

I would say gourmet meals because they are different and unexpected every time/experience, in contrast to my favorite dessert (ice cream). I love ice cream, but an endless supply can hurt with no self-control at times!
