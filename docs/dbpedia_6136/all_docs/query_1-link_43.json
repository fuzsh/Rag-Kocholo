        "text": "Situated at the southern end of Vancouver Island, Victoria, British Columbia is not only the capital of Canada’s westernmost province, it’s the oldest city in the entire Pacific Northwest. This is a city where old-world charm meets coastal culture, where sustainability sits at the heart of the community, and where locals work to preserve what makes this city beautiful. Join me as I meet with the people and businesses that make Victoria a Place to Love.\n\nAcknowledgement: We would also like to take a moment to express our gratitude to lək̓ʷəŋən-speaking people of the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations for allowing us to be guests on your land.\n\nDid you know Victoria is home to the oldest Chinatown in Canada and the second oldest in all of North America (just behind San Francisco)? The neighborhood grew in the 1800s as miners moved from California to British Columbia once gold was discovered in Fraser Canyon. It’s known for its maze of colorful alleyways; the most famous being Fan Tan Alley. I was joined by Charlayne Thornton-Joe of the Chinese-Canadian Museum as we walked along Canada’s narrowest street and she told me about its current state.\n\nNormally, I like to go for a run or a walk to get acclimated to a new destination. But when a city is known for its bike-friendliness, I just have to explore on two wheels. It’s true what they say – it’s impossible to be unhappy on a bike! And because of all its sustainability efforts, Victoria has become one of the most cyclist-friendly cities in the world. Richard Bell of The Pedaler Bike Tours and Rental Shop took me around the city’s highlights while explaining all the other ways Victoria focuses on reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nWhat better dish to get when you’re by the sea than a classic fish and chips combo? Located in Victoria James Bay, no one does it better or fresher than Finest at Sea. As Chef Anna Hunt explains, all their seafood is as fresh as it gets. They have their own fleet of boats that catch the fish sustainably and freeze them within the hour. Chef Anna recommended getting the lingcod option, and you’ll have to see if she was right!\n\nFinest at Sea also sells a variety of wild caught British Columbian seafood if you want to bring some back for your next dinner. And, yes, American viewers, you can bring back seafood. According to the USDA, our Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service does not regulate the importing of seafood. Just make sure you declare it at customs.\n\nReady to get lost in wonderland? Head to the gorgeous Butchart Gardens for a little while. Over a century ago, couple Robert and Jennie Butchart moved to Victoria to build a limestone cement plant. After almost a decade, Jennie began to plan a stunning garden that would replace the now exhausted limestone deposits. Her first success is now known as the Sunken Garden. Over the next two decades, she’d add more gardens like the Japanese Garden and the Rose Garden, creating a grander masterpiece. It was their grandson who’d open the gardens up, making it the magical place anyone can visit today.\n\nWant perhaps the coolest souvenir ever to bring home? Head right over to Puzzle Lab. Now, I know what you’re thinking – how on earth is a puzzle the coolest souvenir to bring back? Hear me out. Puzzle Lab founders, Tinka Robev and Andrew Azzopardi, are not just making your run of the mill 1000-piece puzzles. First they curate artwork from local Canadian artists who will receive a royalty on all puzzles sold. They then print the art work on birch or maple plywood before Andrew goes to work creating unique patterns for future puzzle enthusiasts to solve. And his designs are nothing like you’ve seen before. They use chili peppers to let you know how difficult they’ll be to solve!\n\nWhen you come all this way to the Pacific Northwest, you’ve got to try some whale watching. I could witness a whale in action a hundred times and still find it breathtaking! In Victoria, your go-to guide should be Eagle Wing Tours. This local, family-run company takes guests out to the Salish Sea and focuses on both wildlife education and operating in the most environmentally friendly way possible. They’ve become industry leaders on conservation and as one of the owners, Brett Soberg, told me, they’ve donated over $1 million dollars to 29 different organizations.\n\nNothing says sustainability quite like a good farm-to-table restaurant, and 10 Acres Bistro takes their label seriously. Everything they serve comes right from their 10 Acres Farm, whether it’s seasonal crops or livestock. They strive to prove just how bountiful Victoria is. Vegetables are grown from heirloom seeds found from small Canadian seed businesses. Their orchards are planted with all sorts of fruits and nuts, and they focus on fostering bees who help pollinate their fruit trees and flowers. Even their livestock are ethically raised and fed. I had a chance to see just how well this ethos translates to the plate when I sat down with sous chef Katrina Archibald to sample some of their bistro dishes. A must try? Their asparagus!\n\nCanada has a long tradition of grand railway hotels, and the Fairmont Empress in all its Châteauesque glory is one of them. Opened in 1908 in Victoria’s Inner Harbor, it’s one of the oldest hotels in the city and looks more like a castle than a hotel. True to its luxurious nature, it’s become famous for its afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge. However, if you’d like something a little more adult, come for their sunset sips. Be sure to try the Empress Drink. The bluish tint comes from the butterfly pea blossom in the gin."
