        "text": "Weâve been creating cars with the mission of evoking joy and inspiring Big Love for over 60 years. Decades later, that passion has only grown to new heights.\n\nThe MINI Paul Smith\n\nOne car, lots of stripes. The legendary Paul Smith obliged with a MINI that matched his sense of simplicity, while delivering an exciting and vibrant MINI Cooper design for the 40th anniversary of the creation of the very first MINI in 1999.\n\nA MINI Cooper S Limousine\n\nWeâre used to MINIs turning heads, but very few of our special models shot to the front pages like the MINI Cooper S Limousine, also known as the MINI Cooper S XXL did in 2004. The whirlpool in the back was just one of the crazy things about this extravagant 6.3-metre limousine.\n\nThe MINI Ice Cream Van\n\nThe MINI Ice Cream Van is affectionately called the Batmobile Mini by many, although it delivers icy goodness instead of justice. It was created from the classic Mini Pickup â with just the roof and back removed â and took its design inspiration from the 1960âs Batman television show.\n\nMr.Bean's MINI\n\nThere are few cars that are as perfect for their owners as the classic MINI is for Mr. Bean. On TV and in films, the two have been together through many memorable adventures. But did you know that Mr. Bean has had more than one MINI? Or that his first was orange?\n\nThe MINI ACV 30\n\nAlso known as the big \"what if\". In the middle of the 1990s, designers and decision-makers sat down to choose how the MINI for the next century would look. Looking at it today, you probably couldnât even imagine the ACV 30 as the new MINI. But youâd be surprised just how big of an influence it still has on our brand to this day.\n\nThe MINI Wildgoose\n\nThere have been many unique MINIs that have altered the base car in some way, but none more so than the cult classic MINI Wildgoose. This small motorhome gave a new meaning to the phrase âcreative use of spaceâ and allowed passengers to experience new horizons.\n\nThe MINI David Bowie\n\nThere isnât much we could say about David Bowie that hasnât already been said. He was an artist who continually defined and redefined himself and challenged social and cultural expectations. âReflect Yourselfâ - that was the idea David Bowie had when he wrapped a classic Mini Cooper in chrome for our 40th birthday.\n\nThe Italian Job\n\nWhen you need a high-speed chase through a busy city with cars that donât just turn up the excitement but turn on the style, you go for the MINI. It was like that in the original The Italian Job, as well as its modern remake. Check out how these cars became the real stars of the movie, and all the magic that went into making the action happen.\n\nJoin our mailing list for all the latest MINI news, offers, and buzz. And donât worryâwe wonât share your information with anyone else."
