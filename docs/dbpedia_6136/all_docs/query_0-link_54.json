        "text": "In 2019, we launched the Mockingbird Single Stroller, which rapidly became one of the most award-winning full-size models on the market. One request we frequently heard, though, was from parents with two stroller-age children: \"I'd love to be able to add a 2nd seat!\" So after months of interviews and a meticulous design & engineering process, we created the Mockingbird Single-to-Double Stroller, a version of our original stroller that can expand to two seats.\n\nTo check which stroller model you have, you can look at the product sticker on your stroller frame (it's located above the basket, on the left side of the metal frame when facing the back of the stroller). It will read \"Mockingbird Stroller\" if it's a Single Stroller and \"Mockingbird Double Stroller\" if it's a Single-to-Double Stroller.\n\nMockingbird strollers will be ready for you from the moment your child is born, all the way through the last day of their stroller years. We have three modes of compatibility for an infant (listed below), and then once your baby is able to sit up by themselves (usually around 6-7 months), they'll be ready for the toddler seat, which they can use all the way up through 50 lbs.\n\nInfant-compatible modes:\n\nUse our Car Seat Adapter to connect your infant car seat to our Stroller\n\nUse our Carriage in place of the stroller seat\n\nAdd the Infant Seat Insert into the Stroller's toddler seat and fully recline the seat to provide the necessary support for an infant\n\nIf using the Mockingbird Single-to-Double Stroller with two toddler seats at the same time, the weight recommendation is up to 45 lb in each seat.\n\nThe Mockingbird Single-to-Double Stroller is about 27 lbs in single mode and 35 lbs in double mode including the frame, seat, wheels, canopy, and basket. It measures about 25.5” at its widest point (wheel to wheel), 40” tall (from wheels to handlebar), and 33” long (from front to back wheel). When folded, the stroller is 34” tall (with the footrest rotated parallel to the floor), 25.5” wide (from wheel to wheel), and 18” deep.\n\nThe Mockingbird Single Stroller is 27 lbs including the frame, seat, wheels, canopy, and basket. It measures about 25.5” at its widest point (wheel to wheel), 41\" tall (from wheels to handlebar), and 30.5\" long (from front to back wheel). When folded, the stroller is 33.5” tall (with the footrest rotated parallel to the floor), 25.5” wide (from wheel to wheel), and 16” deep.\n\nThe Mockingbird Single Stroller is not available at Target, but the Mockingbird Single-to-Double Stroller is available on Target.com and at most Target locations nationwide for an in-store demo. To find the Target closest to you that carries Mockingbird, you can use our location finder or call your local Target and ask a store representative.\n\nLike everything we do, our product materials are selected with safety, functionality, and durability in mind. Our stroller frame is built with anodized aluminum to support a smooth and secure ride. Our handlebar features a leatherette grip and contains no animal by-products (which is true of all Mockingbird products). Our seat and basket are made of heavy-duty nylon, perfect for easy cleanup of any mess (and yes, there will be cleanups!)."
