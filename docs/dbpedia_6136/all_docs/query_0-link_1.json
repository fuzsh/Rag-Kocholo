The artists have a soft spot for Vespas because it gives them an excuse to hold tightly to one another.\n\nRabbitwoman takes the lead on the bike while Dogman gets cosy in the sidecar next to her, trusting her to take him somewhere incredible. With a seat on the back of the bike, this sculpture is interactive, allowing the public to jump on and be part of Rabbitwoman and Dogman’s next adventure.\n\nThis amazing sculpture has been installed in major cities across the world to show love and acceptance and is part of the ‘Travel Everywhere With Love’ project."
