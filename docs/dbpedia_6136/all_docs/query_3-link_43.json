        "text": "What do the Jhumur songs of the workers of the tea plantations of Assam tell us about memory, history, identity, migration, resistance and much more? The paper ‘Axom Deshor Bagisare Sowali- The Girl from the Tea Gardens of Assam’ studies the Jhumur songs as oral histories of the various communities and tribes brought to Assam by the colonial project of growing tea. It traces the history of migration of tea plantation labour and the narratives of the tea plantation workers of Assam and their histories and cultures that can be seen in Jhumur songs. The paper explores how memory, history and identity are kept alive through Jhumur songs of the tea plantation workers. To augment local labour, the tea estates brought in, through coercion and inducement, workers from Nepal and tribal migrant labour from the Chota Nagpur region. One of the responses of the variegated cultural groups plucking, pruning, laboring, living together under the policing nazar were the Jhumur songs performed in autumn seasons or for festivals. The paper engages with the different aspects of the workers life revealed in the songs - on feeling alienated, being exploited and ceding complete control of their lives to the plantation management. The paper also traces the gendered cultural politics in the history of migration of the tea plantation worker and analyses the social, economic and political forces and dynamics that produce the fractured positionality of women tea plantation workers in Assam. While the women are treated as docile /invisible in the Jhumur songs her memory is resilient, and the songs are implacable in recording loss, memories of ‘home’ and privations of daily plantation life.\n\nThis article focuses on vernacular travel writings on America and Europe by Swami Satyadev ‘Parivrajak’ (1879–1961), one of the first persons to systematically write travelogues in Hindi. I argue that Parivrajak’s travel literature was part of a colonised nation’s attempt to reclaim a space of freedom, forged through the carving of ‘perfect masculine bodies’, which embodied his ideals of beauty and pleasure. It was a performative, political act that inscribed gendered landscapes with a dialogue between East and West, slavery and freedom. The Hindu male’s subaltern masculinity had to be overcome through diverse means, all of which metaphorically interacted to shape Parivrajak’s writings.\n\nThis case study of Raj tourism is based on a postcolonial discourse of nostalgia that applies the language of tourism to the \"Old Talk\" of Empire when Britain once ruled the waves. Various facets of Raj tourism are semiotically explored in relation to the correspondence between motivation and promotion in order to more fully appreciate the process of understanding tourism itself. Typical areas of cultural communication that are inductively analyzed range from journalese to brochurese and include inter alia the popular press, imperial travel by train, and other forms of touring, as well as televised and film representations in such reality shows as the Marigold Hotel. In this way, the glories of the past can be better grasped as contributing to the comforting reprojection of empire on an uncertain future in a post-Brexit world."
