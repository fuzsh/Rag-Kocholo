        "text": "Where are your Oscar-worthy Lancashire film and TV locations?\n\nMorecambe Bay has played a starring role over the years in some well-known films and TV productions – did you catch any of these – or are there any others you’re aware of? We’d love to hear from you on Facebook or Twitter !\n\nBrief Encounter (1945) was filmed at Carnforth Station – visit this familiar station and even have a nostalgic cup of tea in the lovingly recreated Refreshment Rooms. Ian McKellen’s Richard III (1995) used Steam Town in Carnforth as its military HQ, a museum now sadly closed.\n\nThe Music Hall in The Entertainer (1960) was Morecambe’s Alhambra – now a performance and event venue.\n\nSunset Across the Bay was a 1975 Alan Bennett TV play which followed a retired couple who move from Leeds to the seaside resort of Morecambe. And Bennett’s All Day On The Sands (1975) featured mismatched holidaymakers trying to enjoy a visit to Morecambe.\n\nPoirot used the amazing setting of The Midland Hotel with Morecambe posing as ‘Whitcombe’ in its Double Sin Episode in 1990.\n\nPossession (2002) is a romantic mystery drama starring Gwyneth Paltrow and featuring graceful Leighton Hall, home of the world-renowned Gillow family.\n\nThe Ruby in the Smoke (2006), a gripping tale starring Billie Piper and Julie Walters, was filmed at the interesting former port of Sunderland Point.\n\nTurn Back Time (2012) was filmed in Morecambe’s Albert Road – modern day families being whisked back in time to the 1900s to experience a real taste of Edwardian seaside life. And showcasing antiques from the 1900s and before, Flog It! filmed at The Platform in Morecambe in 2015.\n\nBoth Michael Portillo’s Great Railway Journeys and Channel 4’s Great Canal Journeys (2018) have recognised the beauty of travelling in style and discovering the secrets and stories of this district at a slower pace.\n\nThe Bay is a specially-commissioned crime drama, set in and around Morecambe. Series 3 is currently screening.\n\nQuestion Time. Morecambe’s fantastic Platform events venue played host to the political television programme Question Time, on 27/01/2022. You can catch up on this episode on the BBC website.\n\nThe Radfords – 22 Kids and Counting. The Radford family live in Morecambe and run a local bakery. They first appeared on the 2012 Channel 4 documentary television programme 15 Kids and Counting. Subsequent annual updates focused on the last year in the Radford household; the Current Series, 22 Kids and Counting, is airing from 5 January 2022 on Channel 5.\n\nAnd of course, this list wouldn’t be complete without Eric Morecambe and partner Ernie Wise! The story of their fledgling career was filmed in Morecambe in 2011 for the TV film Eric and Ernie.\n\nThis beloved comedian still holds court over the Morecambe seafront – be sure to pay him a visit…"
