        "text": "Slumber under twinkling night skies, share a s’more around the campfire, and make memories that last a lifetime on a camping trip in New York State! Ever thought of embarking on a camping adventure but don’t know where to start? We’ve got you covered! From choosing the perfect campground to packing the right gear, here’s everything you need to know about camping in the Empire State.\n\nChoose your accommodation\n\nTent, RV, cabin, cottage, or luxurious glamping accommodation? No matter what you choose, there’s a shelter for every kind of camper. A good set-up should keep you safe and be simple to use. Tents are great options for beginners because of how portable, adaptable, and affordable they are, but be sure to consider weather and group abilities. Certain outfitters such as Basecamp Brooklyn also offer tent rentals, perfect for first-timers. Similar to tents, RVs offer a lot of flexibility, but without the need to assemble. See if an RV is right for you with a rental from RV Shares, offering travel trailers, fifth wheels, and motorhome RVs. Cabins and cottages are perfect for those still wanting to experience New York’s great outdoors without sacrificing modern comforts such as electricity, tables, chairs, beds, a stove, and refrigerator. Rentals can be found at public and private campgrounds in all corners of the state; be sure to reserve in advance, as they tend to book quickly. Take your camping experience to the next level and go glamping! Glampsites such as Ithaca Firelight Camps, Boheme Retreats, or Huttopia Adirondacks feature plush beds, luxe tents, and more.\n\nPrograms and rewards\n\nMake the most out of your trip! Each summer, the DEC provides free first-time camper weekends for New York residents. If you’ve never camped before, this is a great opportunity to try it out before purchasing any gear. Plus, you’ll receive a camping 101 lesson from an expert and have the opportunity to learn how to fish, hike, paddle, and more. Locations range from the dazzling North South Lake Campground in the Catskills to the shores of Lake Champlain at Ausable Point Campground. The sweepstakes usually open mid-June and participants are chosen at random. Whether you’re a camping pro or just pitching your first tent, get rewarded for camping with the New York State Parks loyalty program! Enroll in the program and earn 10 points for every dollar you spend on overnight accommodations at all New York State Parks Campgrounds.
