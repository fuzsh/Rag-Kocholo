        "text": "Victoria Machin and her family have been enjoying being able to pick up and go whenever they choose; whether it’s a quick trip to the shops or a family day out exploring the countryside near their home in Aberdare, South Wales. This newfound freedom is thanks to their new wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV), the Peugeot Horizon™ from Allied Mobility.\n\nSimplicity on the Horizon\n\nVictoria lives with her husband Paul and four-year-old twins, Samuel and Richard. Samuel has Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus and is a full-time wheelchair user. Until recently, the family relied on Paul’s standard car to get around and helping Samuel into it proved to be a time-consuming affair. It required Victoria to lift him into the vehicle and then spend time dismantling his chair to store in the boot each time they left the house. Knowing that this would become more difficult as Samuel got older, the family decided that a WAV would ensure flexibility and freedom for the future, as well as easing the strain.\n\nVictoria says: “As Samuel grows, I realise I won’t be able to lift him out of his chair as well as I do now so having an accessible car that I can wheel him into easily and make sure he’s secure has been a lifesaver.”\n\nA Whole New (Mobility) World\n\nNew to the world of mobility vehicles, the Machin family attended a ‘Kidz to Adultz’ event, where Allied Mobility were exhibiting, to explore different options. After browsing the range of vehicles, Horizon™ piqued Victoria’s interest and after finding out more, she thought it would be ideal for the whole family. Its low gradient EasyGlide™ ramp meant that Victoria could wheel Sam into the vehicle safely and the spacious layout gave plenty of room for the family to comfortably travel together. What’s more, the process of getting their first WAV from Allied Mobility was surprisingly easy.\n\nVictoria explains: “Everything just came together. From getting information and advice from Paul, our mobility advisor, to the WAV being delivered right to our front door, everyone was so helpful and friendly.”\n\nFamily Freedom\n\nSince taking delivery of their very first wheelchair accessible vehicle, life has opened up for the Machin family. Getting ready to go on trips is now quick and easy and Victoria and the twins can sit back and enjoy the drive."
