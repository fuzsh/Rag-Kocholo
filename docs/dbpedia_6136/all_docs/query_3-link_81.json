        "text": "Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) issued a flurry of warnings to residents after a thunderstorm flew through the province's capital Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn an alert issued at 1:15 p.m., ECCC said it was tracking a severe thunderstorm capable for producing strong wind gusts (up to 90km/h), toonie sized hail and heavy rain.\n\nAt the time of the warning, the system was located from 10 kilometres southwest of Deer Valley to nine kilometres north of Breiercrest and was moving east at 75km/h.\n\n“Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles,” the warning read.\n\nDownload the CTV News app to get breaking news alerts sent to your device\n\nThe entire southeast portion of Saskatchewan remained under a thunderstorm watch Tuesday afternoon. The watch extends from Lake Diefenbaker all the way to Gainsborough – extending as far north as Yorkton.\n\nAs of 4:30 p.m., the system had crossed the majority of the province, passing throught the Midale, Estevan area. ECCC forecasts claimed the system was still capable of producing 100km/h winds and toonie sized hail.\n\nAir quality issues persist\n\nWhile the south faces inclement weather and rain, northern Saskatchewan remains under an air quality advisory.\n\nWildfire smoke is expected to cause very poor air quality and reduced visibility for a large swath of northern Sask. extending from Buffalo Narrows in the northwest to Cumberland House in the southeast.\n\nAir Quality Health Index (AQHI) values for Tuesday afternoon remained low Tuesday afternoon – with 2 and 3’s being recorded. However, ECCC forecasted that by Tuesday night, Prince Albert would be experienced an AQHI value of 10 or very high risk."
