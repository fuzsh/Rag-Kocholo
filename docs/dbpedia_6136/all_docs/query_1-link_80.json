        "text": "Lifting the curtain on some of the season's most exciting new releases.\n\nKatia and Maurice Krafft traveled the world together chasing volcanoes. In Fire of Love, a National Geographic documentary up for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature on March 12, director Sara Dosa collages footage taken by the couple over their decades-long careers as volcanologists into an astoundingly charming, globetrotting epic.\n\nOpening credits identify the film’s stars not just as the couple but also the volcanoes Mauna Loa (Hawaii), Nyiragongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Krafla (Iceland), St. Helens (Washington), and Una Una (Indonesia), among many more. The Kraffts’ final itinerary takes them from Martinique to Paris to Japan, where they die in the 1991 eruption of Mount Unzen. Katia and Maurice’s meticulous documentation of their adventures—the volcanoes themselves, the surrounding cities before and after eruptions, the locals—is a gift, even more so upon realizing you get to see it all on the big screen.\n\nWhile sifting through the Kraffts’ home movies—290 hours of stunningly restored 16mm film, taken in part to encourage governments to develop evacuation plans in the case of an eruption—Dosa was struck by the profundity of the couple’s loneliness, as well as by what it would transform into over the course of their lives. Raised in postwar France (Katia was born in 1942, Maurice in 1946), each of their childhoods were spent in the rubble. “It was atrocity that first attracted them to volcanos,” says Dosa, “They were lonely. The world felt unsafe. They looked away from humanity and into the natural world. Volcanic eruptions forever re-shape the Earth, they are so grandiose and impactful and beyond manmade, and this was attractive to both of them.”\n\nIn the below conversation, Dosa reflects on how seeing the world gave way to better understanding it—for both her and the Kraffts—the beauty of people and of the natural world, and how each volcano boasts a temperament of its own.\n\nOften when a volcano was about to blow, Katia and Maurice received a telegram from a friend in the area alerting them. How did they build these relationships?\n\nAt the beginning of their career in the late ‘60s, they had a band of fellow volcanologists and cinematographers—Swiss Army-type friends. But into the ’70s, many of those friends wanted to plant roots in France. At the same time, Katia and Maurice were meeting people who had these “living relationships” with volcanoes, people who lived on or at the base of volcanoes, people who intimately understood how volcanoes work from a cultural and generational knowledge perspective, as well as a scientific perspective. They realized, “Oh, we can develop these meaningful friendships with families that have lived in this place or that place for hundreds of years, that also better equip us with knowledge of these volcanoes.”\n\nLocal people were in turn intrigued by this delightful French couple, and they would want to come along for the ride. These friendships were so critical to their work, and those were the friends who would call them on a moment's notice when they would start to notice that their seismometers were shaking, or the air itself was feeling more sulfuric. They would get on the phone and tell Katia and Maurice to come on over.\n\nDid you yourself visit any volcanoes, either before, during, or after making this film?\n\nI did have an artists’ residency in Iceland at the beginning of our editing period, and many members of the team were able to join me. I visited the Fagradalsfjall volcano twice. Ragnar Unnarsson is an amazing guide and he took us up the first time, and the second time I was able to lead the way. This is an effusive volcano, it was being monitored by our science advisor Clive Oppenheimer. We call them “red volcanoes” in Fire of Love, they are the volcanoes with more predictable lava flows. It was erupting at that time, which was unlike anything I’d ever seen before. Seeing that further conjured my empathy for Katia and Maurice—I was hypnotized by the lava. The footage we were working with had no synced sound and so there I was able to actually hear the bangs and hisses.\n\nOnce the film came out and we were touring the festival circuit, we went to Sundance Asia in Jakarta. We took a day trip up to Anak Krakatau, which has one of my favorite scenes in Fire of Love. Getting to see it for myself forever changed me. Katia and Maurice compare seeing volcanoes to witnessing the birth of the world 4.6 billion years ago. Our guide told us that he could feel it in his bones when the volcano was about to erupt, and I was inclined to believe him. You do develop a molecular relationship with the place that you live. To get there, we started at a small fishing village and approached via boat. The view matched Katia and Maurice’s own images. The air was so saturated with sulfur and we ascended with great anticipation up this mountain of black ash and lava boulders. It wasn’t magmatic at the time but there were these ghostly fumaroles coming up at the lip of the crater, this stew of creation.\n\nWhat is it about Indonesia that's particularly fascinating?\n\nIndonesia has the highest concentration of active volcanoes on the planet at around 130, and the people have deep relationships with these dangerous but life-giving forces. Volcanic ash is extremely fertile and there are thriving agricultural trades due to the volcanism of the area, yet at the same time there’s a catastrophic eruption every few years that kills people. There were moments that made our hearts swell there because people in our audience had known Katia and Maurice—including a woman who they stayed with when Galunggung erupted in 1984.\n\nVolcanoes are everywhere—found across tundras, islands, tropics. How did you set about presenting them?\n\nWe wanted to construct a scientifically accurate personality for each of the volcanoes that was true to how Katia and Maurice perceived them. Our sound editors had to reconstruct the sounds in post. With Anak Kraketau, we used geothermally accurate archival sounds, but because Katia and Maurice thought of this particular volcano as being monstrous, we wove dinosaur sound effects into the soundscape. We really tried to do that sort of thing with each volcano, to bring in a feeling of ontology to communicate that these are living forces.\n\nCan you introduce us to a few more of these personalities?\n\nThey felt betrayed by Nyiragongo. On their first visit, it was a place of absolute love. They were mesmerized by that crater. They stayed there for two weeks on their first visit, camping inside the mouth, and had their first brush with death when lava rushed them out of nowhere. It’s frightening, but they emerge unscathed. Katia says about it, “Curiosity is greater than fear.” It taught them about the unpredictability, they reconciled a lot of their fears of volcanoes right there. And then in 1977, when the crater emptied out upon the surrounding landscape and killed hundreds of people, that was devastating to them. They thought they understood this being, and here it was sowing death all around.\n\nItaly's volcanoes were their training wheels–Mount Etna for Katia and Stromboli for Maurice, percussive places with volcanic bombs raining from the sky. Some of my favorite language from their writings is about them—Maurice had a trip to Stromboli when he was a student and he writes about dancing out of the way of the projectiles, so this sense of absolute danger becomes one of play. In my head, when I think about Etna and Stromboli I see these sparks. We wanted to match volcanic imagery with love."
