A UNIQUE armoured Rolls Royce that appeared in two hit movies is on sale for just £32,000 - which is £10k less than the price of the average UK car.

The historic set of wheels featured in the film Michael Collins, starring Liam Neeson, as well as Empire of the Sun, a 1987 war movie directed by Steven Spielberg.

According to the listing, the bizarre motor is "based on a 1931 Vauxhall WHG Truck" and is the closest "thing you'll get to a real Rolls Royce Armoured car".

The car boasts a "working turret and armoured front doors, screen and side windows".

Motorists eager to drive the armoured Rolls Royce will have to fork out £32,000 - which is £10,000 less than the average price of a car in the UK.

It had been restored with the drivers able to operate the armoured doors from their seats.

The eBay listing added that this "is probably the best reproduction Rolls Royce around".

It has also been fitted with indicators and rear/brake lights, making it safe to drive on UK roads.

The listing added: "She has an original horn and Lucas 'King of the road' lights as well as a Bedford 6 cylinder petrol engine and box."

The inside of the armoured Rolls Royce is said to be "very authentic", giving motorists that Hollywood feel when driving this unique car around.

The car comes with a "Reproduction Vickers machine gun and ammo included".

It has undergone an MOT and is Tax-free, meaning those wanting to get their hands on the unique car will be able to drive it around straight after purchasing it.

"She has been lovingly cared for and runs very well but I haven't used her this year," the listing added.

"You'll never see one like her again and her movie pedigree makes her unique.

Located in Norfolk, the buyer would be responsible for transport, according to the listing.

It comes after petrolheads learnt that they could pick up an exotic-looking sports car that somewhat resembles a Lamborghini for under £9,000.
