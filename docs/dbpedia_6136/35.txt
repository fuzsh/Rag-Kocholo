Blue Orangatang love handle wheels

I was very surprised how much difference it made changing to these from the stock carver wheels on my Surfskate. I still wanted a soft wheel for a bit of forgiveness on rougher surfaces but I wanted something a bit smaller and easier to pick up speed on. These are a great Surfskate / longboard wheel. I would encourage everyone to look at reviews etc. but ultimately get a few set of wheels and try them out as personal preference and where you use them make what you like very different for different people. Overall though these wheels are a great upgrade to the stock Carver’s (which aren’t bad) but these are more fun and bring a bigger smile to my face every time I get out on them.

My love handles

Love shopping with these guys They are full of knowledge and always very helpful The wheels are brilliant I have only used for cruising around on so far, but they roll really well, go over most cracks and take out a lot of vibration Hope that helps!!
