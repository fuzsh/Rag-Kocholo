        "text": "Devastating and Beautiful Opera With Madama Butterfly Tickets\n\nRediscover one of the most famous tales of love and betrayal as Madama Butterfly returns to the Metropolitan Opera House. Anthony Minghella’s revival of Puccini’s masterpiece is a feast for the senses, with cinematic imagery meeting a sweeping score. One of the most enduring stories and lead female figures in opera, this is an unmissable, pioneering production.\n\nWhat is Madama Butterfly about?\n\nMadama Butterfly, often fashioned in English as Madam Butterfly, is the tragic story of a young Japanese girl named Cio Cio San, who falls in unrequited love with a U.S. naval officer, Pinkerton. The pair marry and she believes it will be a permanent, loving arrangement - but he leaves whilst she is pregnant and she must wait for his return.\n\nWritten by Giacomo Puccini, with an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, the Madama Butterfly opera is based on John Luther Long’s 1898 short story \"Madame Butterfly\". It has been performed across the globe and inspired shows including Schönberg and Boublil's musical Miss Saigon. With its far-reaching themes of sexual and cultural imperialism, betrayal and unrequited love, it is one of the most famous tales not just in opera, but in art and literature as a whole.\n\nMet Opera Madama Butterfly Cast\n\nSopranos Aleksandra Kurzak, Eleonora Buratto, and Asmik Grigorian (in her Met debut) share the role of Cio-Cio-San, which is one of the most iconic and devastating in the entire operatic canon. Tenors Matthew Polenzani and Jonathan Tetelman co-star as Pinkerton; mezzo-sopranos Elizabeth DeShong and Eve Gigliotti share the role of Suzuki, and baritone Davide Luciano and Lucas Meachem perform as the American consul Sharpless.\n\nAnthony Minghella’s Madama Butterfly\n\nBAFTA and Academy Award winner Anthony Minghella’s (Truly Madly Deeply; The English Patient) staging of Puccini’s devastating opera is conducted by Xian Zhang in her Met debut. This was the late Minghella’s operatic directorial debut, opening with the English National Opera in 2006. He won the Olivier Award for Best New Opera Production, and his vision for the story remains hugely influential almost twenty years later.\n\nAmongst its many striking features, Minghella’s interpretation stands out for drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese theater with stagecraft, bold and vibrant colors, and traditional bunraku puppetry.\n\nDon’t Miss Tickets for Madama Butterfly at the Met Opera\n\nThis stunning staging of one of the greatest operas of all time is a modern classic, and one that inspires awe and heartbreak no matter how many times you see it. Don’t miss the return of Anthony Minghella’s landmark Madama Butterfly in New York this year."
