        "text": "Nagasaki, 1913\n\nAct I\n\nLieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton of the U.S. Navy, amused by certain Japanese customs and determined to enjoy the pleasures of any country in which he finds himself stationed, has arranged through Goro, a marriage broker, to wed a young Japanese geisha named Cio-Cio San, whose nickname is Madama Butterfly. Pinkerton intends to marry in Japanese fashion for 999 years, but with a monthly escape clause. The American Consul, Sharpless, tries to dissuade Pinkerton, as he senses the bride believes the marriage will be binding. Pinkerton brushes aside the Consul’s concerns and orders Goro to summon the bridal company.\n\nButterfly appears with her relatives and friends. Following introductions, the marriage contract is drawn, witnessed, and signed. As the crowd toasts the couple’s happiness, Cio-Cio San’s name is ominously shouted by her uncle, a fanatical Buddhist monk. He curses Butterfly for rejecting her faith in order to marry the American. Pinkerton confronts him while her relative renounce the young girl. Pinkerton, touched by her weeping and anguish, consoles her as the evening descends.\n\nAct II\n\nThree years have passed since Pinkerton sailed away, leaving Butterfly with the promise that he would return when the red-breasted robins nested again. Suzuki is skeptical of his return and expresses concern that their money is almost gone. Butterfly angrily upbraids Suzuki and sings of the day when her husband will return to her.\n\nGoro and Sharpless arrive. Sharpless has received a letter from Pinkerton, and attempts to read it to her, but she interrupts, asking about the frequency of robins nesting in America, as they have nested in Japan three times since Pinkerton’s departure. The Consul cannot answer. Goro attempts to interest her again in Prince Yamadori, a rich gentleman who loves her, but Butterfly declares proudly that she is already married. Goro informs her that by Japanese law, she is divorced, as her husband has left her. She declares herself judged only by the laws of the United States, and Yamadori departs sadly. Sharpless attempts again to read her the letter, but cannot continue. He finally asks what she would do if Pinkerton never returned. After a moment of shock, she replies that she would prefer to die. Suddenly, she shows her child to Sharpless, who, surprised, agrees that he resembles an American baby. She informs him that the child is named Sorrow, but that her husband, when he hears about the child, will quickly return, and the baby will be renamed Joy. Sharpless promises her that Pinkerton will be told and leaves. Soon after, a distant cannon announces the arrival of Pinkerton’s warship, the Abraham Lincoln. Butterfly ecstatic with anticipation, hurries to prepare for her beloved’s arrival, strewing the house with flowers. Butterfly, Suzuki, and the child peer out into the deepening darkness, waiting the arrival of Pinkerton. As night comes, first the child, then Suzuki fall asleep, but Butterfly, rigid and silent, holds her vigil.\n\nAct III\n\nSuzuki and the child are sleeping, but Butterfly has remained awake, watching and waiting. As the sun rises, Suzuki convinces Butterfly to rest and promises to awaken her when Pinkerton arrives.\n\nSharpless arrives with Pinkerton, accompanied by a woman. Suzuki’s suspicions are quickly confirmed as she discovers that the woman is Pinkerton’s wife, Kate. They have come to take his son back to America. As Suzuki mourns, Sharpless tries to convince her to accept Kate, and Pinkerton begins to comprehend the full measure of pain and anguish for which he alone is responsible. He cannot remain to face the unsuspecting Butterfly and leaves Sharpless to settle the matter.\n\nButterfly awakens, seeking her husband, but instead confronts Sharpless and Kate Pinkerton. Butterfly, dazed, offers Kate best wishes for happiness, and says that if Pinkerton comes back in a half hour, she will give him the child. Sharpless and Kate retreat, while Butterfly takes her father’s knife bearing the inscription, “To die with honor when one can no longer live with honor,” and prepares to commit suicide. Her child runs to her, and she bids him farewell, asking that he not forget her.\n\n“Madama Butterfly and the Limits of Artistic Realism”\n\nby Matthew Leone\n\nMusicology Ph.D. Candidate\n\nFrom early twentieth-century critics to modern biographers, “realism” is one of the most common labels applied to Puccini’s operas, and different authors have identified various forms of realism in these works—psychological, visual, historical, musical, and many others. The realism of Puccini’s 1904 opera Madama Butterfly, however, presents a special set of problems, particularly in confronting the opera’s portrayal of the Far East. On the one hand, Puccini and his collaborators went to considerable lengths to depict Japan and its culture as authentically as possible. In this regard, when compared to many works by Puccini’s contemporaries, Madama Butterfly represents a more nuanced, accurate, and perhaps—to our sensibilities, at least—respectful portrayal of early twentieth-century Japan. On the other hand, Puccini’s opera also reflects numerous nineteenth-century European misperceptions and stereotypes of Japan’s culture and people, as well as the biases of Puccini’s source material, and the composer’s own artistic motivations. When considering Madama Butterfly’s depiction of Japan, we may benefit from keeping in mind one of Oscar Wilde’s artistic axioms: “No great artist ever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would cease to be an artist.”\n\nIn their initial research for the opera, Puccini and his team immersed themselves in various facets of Japanese culture. The costume designer Giuseppe Palanti consulted a wide sampling of publications on Japanese fashion and architecture, and although theFrench stage designer Albert Carré was unable to visit Japan in his research, he scoured the wealthy Parisian suburbs for authentic replicas of Japanese bridges and gardens while designing the Paris production. Puccini took even greater initiative in representing Japan realistically, and as was typical for him, his concerns encompassed multiple aspects of the opera. In 1902, he consulted the well-regarded geisha and actress Kawakami Sadayakko to discuss nuances of speaking and body language in Japan. Later that same year, Oyama Hisako (the wife of the Japanese minister in Rome) sang various traditional Japanese melodies for him, provided him with phonograph records of Japanese tunes, and even offered advice on character names.\n\nDespite these aspirations, there are still many limits to Madama Butterfly’s realism. Perhaps most notable, the two main literary sources for the opera’s libretto—John Luther Long’s novella “Madame Butterfly,” and David Belasco’s staged drama based on the novella—contain a cluttered mixture of factual details and erroneous myths about Japan and its culture. While details such as the houses of paper and wood, the marriage contract, and even Butterfly’s method of suicide are roughly plausible, the depictions of Japanese religious practices contain numerous errors. At an even broader level, however, Long and Belasco’s vision of Japan, carried over into Puccini’s opera, also reflected a romanticized perception of the country found in countless European paintings, musical works, and literature of the late nineteenth century. Such artworks imagined Japan as a peaceful, naive land of innocent geishas, mysterious rituals, and unspoiled natural wonders, far removed from European modernity. As prominent as this perception was, though, it was hardly nuanced or realistic. By 1904, when Butterfly first appeared on the opera stage, Japan was already a burgeoning industrial and military power, having drawn some of its inspiration, paradoxically enough, from Europe’s own industrial and imperialist history.\n\nBeyond the questionable source material and these general misconceptions, though, perhaps the biggest foil to Madama Butterfly’s realism is the very fact that it is indeed an opera first and foremost. For all their efforts at authenticity, Puccini and his team still placed considerable priority on creating a dramatically successful and emotionally compelling opera within the conventions of the genre. For instance, Puccini wove almost a dozen authentic Japanese melodies into his score, but he often used them as traditional operatic leitmotifs to represent characters and events. The tune “Suiryo-Bushi” (“Melody of Supposition”) is one such example. Heard clearly in Butterfly’s Act II aria “Che tua madre,” and again at the close of the opera, this common Japanese popular song from the 1880s becomes, in Puccini’s hands, a grandiose gesture associated specifically with Butterfly’s suicide and death.\n\nIn addition to using borrowed Japanese tunes as leitmotifs, Madama Butterfly also exemplifies Puccini’s own artistic interests and creative decisions, which often prioritized the dramatic portrayal of the plot and characters over questions of realism. Especially notable is Puccini’s fascination with visual atmosphere and lighting, which were major concerns for opera composers in general by the early 1900s. Inspired by Belasco’s play and its revolutionary use of stage lighting, Puccini actively sought to create visually arresting moments in his opera that enhanced both the plot’s dramatic content and the characters’ emotional states. Among the numerous examples in Madama Butterfly, Pinkerton and Butterfly’s duet at the close of Act I, along with the “humming chorus” and vigil scene in Act II, are especially gripping in their use of subtle lighting changes to signal, respectively, the transition from sunset into night, and from night into dawn. Finally, if Puccini’s correspondence with his librettists and publishers is any indication, one simple question seems to have plagued them more than any other in their three years of work on the opera: would Madama Butterfly be more dramatically effective in three acts, or two? Ultimately, theatrical concerns were more important to them than paper and wood houses.\n\nIf nothing else, Madama Butterfly reveals that realism in artistic works can be greatly nuanced. As we have seen, it is generally not enough to ask if the artwork is merely “realistic,” or a literal representation of real life. Regardless of medium or genre, even realistic artworks depict people, places, and ideas according to the perspectives of their creators, and within the boundaries of artistic conventions. Hints of authenticity mesh with dramatization and invention, and even mundane objects, like Butterfly’s fan or Pinkerton’s whiskey, can acquire special meanings. Yet it is perhaps this very blend of realism, perception, and dramatization that makes artworks such as Madama Butterfly as emotionally powerful and meaningful as they are. Like virtually any other work of art, Madama Butterfly presents us with its own vision of real-life people and events, and attributes such as the opera’s emotional content and characterization have the potential to transcend questions of which details are accurate or inaccurate. Taken on its own terms, then, the tragedy of Butterfly’s love and death can be just as real to us as any trinket in Butterfly’s house—and perhaps even more real and of greater importance than whatever details Puccini and his collaborators may have mishandled.\n\nArthur Fagen has been professor of orchestral conducting at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music since 2008, where he is currently chair of the Orchestral Conducting Department.
