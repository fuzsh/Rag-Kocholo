        "text": "\"I have a vision of the Orient...\" says Rene Gallimard in David Henry Hwang's M Butterfly. Based on Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly where beautiful geisha CioCio San gives her life for the tall American she fell in love with - M Butterfly reverses the idea and tells tale of a man so deluded by his perception that he could not see his affections were being given to a Chinese spy, and a male one at that. Yet I too, when I have a vision of the Orient, appear to be given something of a delusion - in the form of Matt Damon, Keanu Reeves and Cate Blanchett. All respectable actors (Bill and Ted notwithstanding), but not Asian either. When questioned about \"The Great Wall\" (where Matt Damon saves China) Mr D has been rather down about the bad publicity calling it a \"f***ing bummer\".\n\nIt's not quite yellowface, which is thankfully getting rarer - but let me just say I know companies who would recoil at blackfacing yet still produce their version of Avenue Q with a yellowfaced Christmas Eve (with an accent bordering on racism if she were to do it in the street) - and don't get me started on Bloody Mary in South Pacific!\n\nThat's a \"f***ing bummer\".\n\nThen there's that little rumour of Disney's Live Action Mulan. Allegedly a first draft of the script introduces a Caucasian merchant as Mulan's love interest who - saves China. This is despite Disney claiming their story was closer to the Ballad. As someone who has performed the Ballad, there's no love interest at all! Mulan does it because her brother is too small and her father is too old. It is a tale of cultural filial piety that most young Chinese girls not only look up to, but in some ways are required to respect.\n\nThat's a \"f***ing bummer\".\n\nGrowing up as a British Born Chinese girl in Hastings (who speaks with the most perfect RP), I had no Asian role model to look up to. I barely had Asian school friends! As such I curled my hair the Western way, dressed as my friends, and wondered why I still felt different. Even now, although I am lucky to get my media work as \"myself\" (as a TV Psychologist as well as a radio host), I dabble in acting and even yesterday when a friend of mine put me in touch with someone casting for a short film, my immediate thought was - unless it's specified \"Chinese\" - they don't want me.\n\nThat's a \"f***ing bummer\" too...I should at least get rejected on talent/age/weight like the rest of my peers!\n\nI am of course a strong advocate of a greater representation of East and SE Asian actors in film and TV, but my reasoning goes deeper than that. Even now I still find it hard to find someone (unless in London or the States) who sells foundation to suit my complexion, and knows how to cut my hair properly! I was speaking to a black actress on set the other day and she said \"It's not just about getting minorities on screen, but it is knowing how to dress them when they are there.\" Hair and Make-Up still tends to practice with a Caucasian palette.\n\nYes, despite all of the above, things are changing - it was a phenomenal SE/E Asian cast in the revival of Miss Saigon, there are breakthrough actors such as Lucy Liu, Gemma Chan, BD Wong - all of whom are playing \"colour blind\" roles, and I have been extremely lucky that my own media platform has been because of me - take me as I am. But films such as \"The Great Wall\" and if Disney gets the live action Mulan wrong, are no help to the cause both in offering opportunity and the myth they are propagating.\n\n...and it is a myth. One of the greatest \"love stories\" is the (Asian) devotion of Madame Butterfly to her white knight...the thing is, in the original book while she is about to draw her sword, her maid pinches her son who starts to scream. This makes Butterfly rethink her action and she lives. Not only that she takes a big step into her empowered future with her son.\n\nIt's a bit too late for The Great Wall - but Disney, please do right by Mulan.\n\nWe appreciate you are (arguably) doing us a favour by making a mainstream E/SE Asian Film, and we appreciate you are going to give us a number of opportunities within the roles (and you do have a policy of ethnic minority casting) - so with it tell the real story - it's not only going to empower us...it will truly reflect us.\n\nAudrey Tang (MBPsS) is also a member of the International Positive Psychology Association. She embeds positive psychology techniques in her executive training and coaching, she is the guest expert (positive psychology) on The Chrissy B Show Sky203, and her book \"Be A Great Manager - Now\" focuses on interpersonal strength and pro-active leadership and is available on Amazon. ...oh, and she doesn't usually use the word \"f***ing\" quite so much.\n\nFor more about Audrey and her training programmes: www.draudreyt.com"
