        "text": "The Vietnam War, homosexual extramarital affairs, and the Japanese geisha. These three seemingly unrelated phenomena all collide when reviewing the multiple artistic endeavors that sprouted out of Giacomo Puccini’s Madama Butterfly (1904). This opera, based on the 1898 short story by John Luther Long, tells the tragic story of a young Japanese geisha and her American naval officer lover, who fathers her child before returning home. As one of the most frequently performed operas, Madama Butterfly has interested a variety of artists, spawning a long list of adaptations from an assortment of mediums including plays, musicals, movies, comic books, and even rock band albums. Two of these works, David Henry Hwang’s M. Butterfly (1988) and Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg’s Miss Saigon (1989), are of particular interest for retelling the story of Puccini’s opera in unique ways through different theatrical mediums. Both shows opened, and also had revivals, around the same time. In fact, in the fall of 2017, one could see both Miss Saigon and M. Butterfly on Broadway and then travel just a few blocks to the Metropolitan Opera to see Puccini’s masterpiece that started it all 113 years earlier. However, this original masterpiece has been scolded, by scholars and laymen alike, for perpetuating stereotypes of Asian women as weak, submissive, hyper-sexualized, and enchantingly exotic. Regardless, it remains one of the most commonly performed operas and has spawned successful artistic endeavors such as Miss Saigon and M. Butterfly. In this paper I hope to examine these two adaptations and their 2017 productions against Puccini’s original work in order to elicit a greater understanding about the possibilities and practices of adapting problematic storylines for contemporary audiences."
