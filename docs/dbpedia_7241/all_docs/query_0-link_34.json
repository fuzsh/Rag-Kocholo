        "text": "Variants:\n\nLoose Leaves:\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood [1938] {1}, directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, and the numerous other Robin Hood films, including for example Robin and Marian [1976] {73} directed by Richard Lester, all derive from English folklore about the eponymous character; while they variably make use of literary works, the major adaptations such as the 1938 film do not credit them; that said, Howard Pyle's The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood [1883] ~1~ has been highly influential on most modern versions of the tale.\n\nThe Beauty and the Beast fairly tale [1740] ~2~, written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve, has produced numerous movie adaptations: notably, Jean Cocteau's La Belle et la Bête [1946] {2}; Lev Atamanov's Alen'kij Cvetoče (The Scarlet Flower) [1952] {3}; Disney's animated Beauty and the Beast [1991] {4}; Christophe Gans's La Belle et la Bête [2014] {5} ; and Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast [2017] {6}.\n\nOther films based on fairy tales include: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs [1937] {7}, from the Brothers Grimm tale 'Schneewittchen' [1812] ~3~; The Little Mermaid [1989] {8} from the Hans Christian Andersen story, 'Den Lille Havfrue' [1837] ~4~; Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Red Shoes [1948] {9}, from Andersen's 'De Røde Sko' [1845] ~5~; Frozen [2013] {10}, from Andersen's 'Snedronningen' ('The Snow Queen') [1844] ~6~; and Cinderella [1950] {11} and Sleeping Beauty [1959] {12}, both based on Charles Perrault tales ('Cendrillon' [1697] ~7~ and 'La Belle au Bois Dormant' [1697] ~8~, respectively).\n\nThe second category of literary works fitting into this vague category are works left unfinished, either later completed by other authors or not. Raymond Chandler's Poodle Springs ~164~ for decades existed only in the form of the four chapters that the author had finished by the time he died, published in Raymond Chandler Speaking [1962]. Robert B Parker completed the novel, published in 1989. In turn, Bob Rafelson directed an adaptation for H B O also called Poodle Springs [1998] {74}.\n\nWhat Came First:\n\nJohn Luther Long's short story, 'Madame Butterfly' [1898] ~25~ was based partially on the Pierre Loti novel, Madame Chrysanthème ~27~, and in turn was adapted by David Belasco as Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan ~26~, a play first performed in 1900. All of these works inspired the Giacomo Puccini opera Madama Butterfly. Both works in turn led to the films: Madame Butterfly [1915] {30}, directed by Sidney Olcott; Madame Butterfly [1932], directed by Marion Gering {28}; and Madame Butterfly [1954] {29}, directed by Carmine Galloneamong numerous other, looser adaptations.\n\nBesides the famous film adaptation of L Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz noted above, that film also inspired the play, The Wiz: The Super Soul Musical \"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" [1975] ~9~ by Charlie Smalls and William F Brown; and the resulting film, The Wiz [1978] {13}, directed by Sidney Lumet.\n\nJ M Barrie's play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up [1904] ~10~ was adapted by Barrie as a novel, Peter and Wendy [1911] ~11~; and both works in turn have been adapted numerous times since, in print, on stage, and on screen; Disney's Peter Pan [1953] {14} not least among them.\n\nMurray Bennett and Joan Alison's play, Everbody Comes to Rick's ~12~, had not been performed when it was was adapted for the screen as Casablanca [1942] {15}.\n\nGraham Greene wrote the screenplay for The Third Man [1949] {16}, but had also written a novella version to prepare for writing the script; the novella ~13~ was published the year after the movie.\n\nArthur Miller's 1950 version of Henrik Ibsen's En Folkefiende (An Enemy of the People) [1882] ~14~ was the basis for the 1978 film {17} directed by George Schaefer.\n\nFrederick Knott's play, Dial M for Murder ~15~, was performed live on B B C television in 1952 (a teleplay, that is, not a television feature film but a play performed live and broadcast simultaneously, as was common in the early years of television) before premiering on stage in London that same year. In turn, it was adapted {18} by Alfred Hitchcock in 1954.\n\nMarty [1955] {19} was also originally a teleplay ~16~, as an episode of The Philco Television Playhouse, 24 May 1953. Paddy Chayefsky wrote both.\n\nIra Levin's play, No Time for Sergeants ~43~ became a teleplay for The United States Steel Hour; a Broadway play; a 1958 film {67}; and a 1964 television series ^1^.\n\nThe novel, 2001: A Space Odyssey [1968] ~17~ by Arthur C Clarke, and the film, 2001: A Space Odyssey [1968] {20}, directed by Stanley Kubrick, were developed in tandem, the novel published soon after the film was released. Both were credited for the screenplay; while Kubrick apparently worked with Clarke on the novel, only the latter was credited.\n\nJerzy Kosinski's novel, Being There [1970] ~18~, basis for the Hal Ashby film of the same name [1979] {21}, has been accused of plagiarizing the Polish novel, The Career of Nikodem Dyzma ~19~, by Tadeusz Doega-Mostowicz.\n\nJames Fogle's novel, Drugstore Cowboy [1990] ~204~, had not yet been published when the film, Drugstore Cowboy [1989] {80}, directed by Gus Van Sant was released.\n\nCarl Sagan's Contact [1985] ~20~ began as a screenplay, co-written with Ann Druyan in 1979; became a novel when a film was not made; and was finally adapted for the cinema as Contact [1997] {22}.\n\nA rough draft of the story, 'Memento Mori' [2001] ~21~, by Jonathan Nolan, was the basis for the screenplay of the film Memento [2000] {23}, written and directed by his brother, Christopher Nolan, but the film came out before the story was published.\n\nBruce Wagner wrote the screenplay for David Cronenberg's Maps to the Stars [2014] {24} and a novel ~22~ based on that script, entitled Dead Stars, published in 2012 after the film's production had temporarily come to a halt.\n\nTarell Alvin McCraney's unpublished play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue ~23~, written in 2003, was adapted by Barry Jenkins as Moonlight [2016] {25}.\n\nUnlike Woody Allen and Catherine Breillat, both arguably best defined as filmmakers who also write, two others, Marcel Pagnol and Alain Robbe-Grillet, are better described as writers and filmmakers equally. Robbe-Grillet for the most part has kept his novels and movies separate. Marcel Pagnol did not. He adapted his own film, Manon des Sources [1952] {26}, as one of two parts of a novel, L'Eau des Collines [1963] ~24~, the other part being Jean de Florette. That novel was later adapted into two films, Jean de Florette [1986] {70} and Manon des Sources [1986] {27}, both directed by Claude Berri.\n\nInterlocking Parts:\n\nThe Henry James novel The Turn of the Screw [1898] ~162~ became a play called The Innocents [1950] ~163~, written by William Archibald. When that play was adapted for the cinema, also entitled The Innocents [1961] {72}, director Jack Clayton asked Truman Capote to re-do Archibald's script, the final result being significantly more like the novel than the play.\n\nHelen Keller's autobiography The Story of My Life ~28~ was turned into a 1957 episode of Playhouse 90, entitled The Miracle Worker; which was in turn adapted by its author, William Gibson, into a play [1959] ~29~ and a film {31}. Further film versions, both made for T V, followed in 1979 {32} and 2000 {33}.\n\nAlthough ostensibly based on its subject's autobiography, Seven Pillars of Wisdom [1926] ~30~, Lawrence of Arabia [1962] {34} incorporates information from other sources.\n\nZoe Akins's play The Greeks Had a Word for It [1930] ~31~ was adapted as The Greeks Had a Word for Them [1932] {35}; both inspired the play, Three Blind Mice ~32~, by Stephen Powys (a pseudonym for Virginia de Lanty, wife of the playwright Guy Bolton, though the pseudonym was used for works that they co-authored and, supposedly, in this case for a week by Bolton alone), and the 1938 film of the same name {68} directed by William A Seiter. The film, How to Marry a Millionaire [1953] {36}, directed by Jean Negulesco, was based both on Akins's play and the Dale Eunson/ Katherine Albert play, Loco ~33~. Three Blind Mice, the play, was also adapted as Three Little Girls in Blue [1946] {81}, directed by H Bruce Humberstone. Slightly less convoluted is the fate of Akins's then-unpublished play, Morning Glory ~34~, adapted as the film {37} of the same name; then remade as Stage Struck [1958] {38}, directed by Sidney Lumet.\n\nRoger Corman's The Masque of the Red Death [1964] {39} is based on both the story of the same name [1845] ~35~ and 'Hop-Frog' [1849] ~36~, both written by Edgar Allan Poe. The later version of The Masque of the Red Death [1989] {40}, directed by Larry Band, is only based on the story of the same name.\n\nThe Heroes of Telemark [1965] {41}, directed by Anthony Mann, is based on both a memoir, Skis Against the Atom [1954] ~37~, written by Knut Haukelid, and a novel based on the events depicted in the memoir: But for These Men ~38~, by John Drummond.\n\nIn the realm of musical theatre, the links among films and plays, and the material they are both based on, at times gets too intricate to be defined in one-to-one relationships: for example, Cabaret [1972] {42}, the film, was based on Cabaret [1966] ~39~, the musical, which was based on the play, I Am a Camera [1951] ~40~, as was the film, I Am a Camera [1955] {43}; all of them being based on the Christopher Isherwood novel, Goodbye to Berlin [1939] ~41~. More recently, another Christopher Isherwood novel, A Single Man [1964] ~54~ became a film of the same name [2009] {69}, directed by Tom Ford.\n\nPorgy and Bess is another example. Originally, a novel ~159~ called Porgy [1925] by DuBose Heyward that was adapted by the author as a play ~160~ that premiered in 1927. The opera [1935] composed by George Gerswhin with a libretto by Heyward followed. A film {71} directed by Otto Preminger flopped, whereas Miles Davis and Gil Evans's album of new arrangements of the musical materialreleased the same yearwas a success and has only grown in stature since. (Operas are not included in the tally of literary works, only musicals; following standard definition of the two forms. The film is included only because it is based on an opera that was based on a novel and play. A film based only on an operaor, for that matter, a song or any other musical compositionwould not be included.)\n\nParts of Wholes:\n\nMarcel Proust's seven-volume À la Recherche du Temps Perdu ~42~ has been adapted once in its entirety [2011] {44} directed by Nina Companéez; and three of its volumes have had their own filmic adaptation: Un Amour de Swann {45}, directed by Volker Schlöndorff, of the first volume, Du Côté de Chez Swann; Chantal Ackerman's La Captive {46}, of the fifth volume, La Prisonnière; and Le Temps Retrouvé {47}, directed by Raül Ruiz, of the seventh volume of the same name.\n\nChimes at Midnight [1965] {48}, directed by Orson Welles, incorporates portions of William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1; Henry IV, Part 2; Richard II; Henry V; and The Merry Wives of Windsor ~44-48~.\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum ~49~, a 1962 play based loosely on the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus, namely Pseudolus ~50~, Miles Gloriosus ~51~, and Mostellaria ~52~, became the 1966 film {49} directed by Richard Lester.\n\nTwo noteworthy films adapting portions of the Bible ~53~: The Bible: In the Beginning... [1966] {50}; and Il Vangelo Secondo Matteo [1964] {51}.\n\nSeries From a Whole:\n\nAmong the television series adapting literary works: Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz ^2^ based on the Alfred Döblin novel of the same name [1929] ~183~; the series, Peyton Place ^3^, based on the Grace Metalious novel of the same name [1956] ~55~ that novel had already been adapted for the cinema [1957] {52}; The Flying Nun ^4^, based on Tere Ríos's novel The Fifteenth Pelican [1966] ~184~; Roots ^5^ and Roots: The Next Generations ^6^, based on Alex Haley's Roots: The Saga of an American Family [1976] ~185~; The Women of Brewster Place ^7^, based on Gloria Naylor's novel of the same name [1982] ~186~; and the soap opera version of José Marqia de Eça de Queirós's Os Maias: Episódios da Vida Romântica [1888] ~187~, simply titled Os Maias ^8^, produced in 2001 by the Brazilian network Rede Globo, directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho. In the non-fictionexcuse me, veritableworld, David Simon's Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets [1991] ~188~ became Homicide: Life on the Street ^9^.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation, the Public Broadcasting Service (P B S), and other T V films and series of \"classic\" literature have became ubiquitous, whether as stand-alone productions or as part of a larger program. (By the way, a two-part production gets counted here as a feature and would be included in the tables. Anything of three episodes or more counts here as a series and is noted in this section of the page.) A good example of a B B C series is the eight-part version ^10^ of Charles Dickens's Bleak House [1985] ~189~.\n\nAs television has become more prestigious, more novels that perhaps would have been adapted again as feature films instead are being adapted as series. Besides the film adaptation included in the tables above, James M. Cain's Mildred Pierce has been adapted as five-part T V series ^32^ directed by Todd Payne. And, in addition to the two film adaptations noted above, The Haunting of Hill House was adapted as a 10-episode series ^33^ of the same name\n\nSeries and Series:\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel by Emma Orczy (Baroness Orczy), was originally a play, performed 1903 in an early version before its revised version became a success in 1905 on the West End. It is remembered more as a novel, that version published in 1905 as well. Sequels and off-shoots followed, a total of 17 books, the last in 1940 ~165-182~. Among the numerous theatrical, cinematic, radio, and television adaptations of these works: The Scarlet Pimpernel [1934], directed by Harold Young, and \"Pimpernel\" Smith [1941], directed by Leslie Howard (both of these films starred Howard); Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel [1937], the sequel to the '34 film (but starring Barry K Barnes as the titular character); The Elusive Pimpernel [1950] directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The Scarlet Pimpernel [1982] directed by Clive Donner {75-79}. More recently, a musical adaptation was written by Nan Knighton ~161~.\n\nIn addition, the B.B.C has aired several series based on characters from series of mystery novels: e.g. The Inspector Alleyn Mysteries [1990, 1993-4] ^24^ adapting nine novels by Ngaio Marsh ~74-82~; The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries [1998-2000] ^25^ adapating five novels by Gladys Mitchell ~83-87~; Wallander [2008-16] ^26^ adapting 11 Henning Mankell novels ~88-98~. Granada offered a decade-long run of Sherlock Holmes ^27^ series in the 1980's and early '90's, generally considered as a single show, adapting a total of 39 stories and two novels ~99-139~. More recently, the B B C's Sherlock ^28^ sets some of the stories and novels in Twenty-First-Century England. Agatha Christie's Miss Marple character has birthed numerous films and series in the U.K and the U.S, perhaps most significantly the B.B.C's Miss Marple series ^29^, which adapted all 12 of the novels ~140-151~. In the States we also had Father Dowling Mysteries [1987, 1989-91], more loosely based on its literary precusor, a series of novels by Ralph McInerny.\n\nIn a similar vein, the character Fantômas, the subject of numerous novels written by Marcel Allain and Pierre Souvestre, in turn became the subject of numerous film and T V adaptations, notably those directed by Louis Feuillade in the silent era and André Hunebelle in the 1960's.\n\nAgatha Christie's novel, Murder on the Orient Express ~56~, has been adapted numerous times for both the cinema and T V, most prominently Sidney Lumet's 1974 film {53}.\n\nUnsurprisingly, series of novels lead to T V series, just as we've seen series of novels (such as the James Bond titles) leading to series of films: notably, Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House novels, or, rather, the third (Little House on the Prarie [1935] ~152~) and fourth (On the Banks of Plum Creek [1937] ~153~) of the series, and the T V series, The Little House on a Prairie [1974-82] ^30^; George R R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire ~154-158~ and Game of Thrones [2011- ] ^31^, with the T V series having notably out-paced the author's own progress on his ongoing series; elements of all five of the novels published so far have been included in the show.\n\nSome authors' work produces series and films equally well. Robert Ludlum's trilogy of Jason Bourne novels: The Bourne Identity [1980] ~57~; The Bourne Supremacy [1986]; and The Bourne Ultimatum [1990] produced films: The Bourne Identity [1988], a two-part T V movie {54}; and The Bourne Identity [2002] {55}, the first of the Matt Damon-featured franchisethe third film in the series, The Bourne Ultimatum {56} is loosely based on the novel of the same name ~58~, while two other films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Legacy by most accounts merely take the name of the accompanying novel but not the story (The Bourne Legacy novel being one of numerous novels, all written by Eric Van Lustbader, continuing the original trilogy)while his novel The Apocalypse Watch [1995] ~190~ led to a mini-series [1997] ^11^. Earlier, The Osterman Weekend [1972] ~59~ had led to a film of the same name [1983] {57} directed by Sam Peckinpah, as did The Holcroft Covenant [1978] ~60~: the film of the same name [1985] {58} directed by John Frankenheimer.\n\nA bit less convoluted.... Patrick Hamilton's Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky trilogy of novels [1929-34] ~61, 62, 63~ has birthed both a film, Bitter Harvest {59}, and a B B C series ^12^.\n\nElmore Leonard's fictional character, U.S Marshall Raylan Givens, the subject of the novels Pronto [1993] ~191~, Riding the Gap [1995] ~192~, and the story 'Fire in the Hole' ~193~, became the subject of his own T.V series, Justified ^13^. In turn, Leonard wrote another novel, Raylan [2012] ~194~, based on the series.\n\nBesides the numerous adaptations of his work (many more beyond what's listed above here), several Stephen King novels gave rise to T.V mini-series: ~195~ Salem's Lot ^14^; ~196~ It ^15^; ~197~ The Tommyknockers ^16^; and ~198~ The Stand ^17^.\n\nWell before the recent feature-film version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, that novel was adapted for a mini-series: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy [1979], directed by John Irvin.\n\nIn addition to the three works noted above, the Robert Daley novel To Kill a Cop [1976] ~199~ was turned into a T V mini-series of the same name and a 13-episode series, ^18^ Eischied.\n\nLarry McMurty would get a special section above if the most popular of the many adaptations of his works had not been a T V mini-series, Lonesome Dove [1989] ^19^, based on the novel [1985] of the same name ~200~ (in turn, there were sequel mini-series based on the novel's sequels: Streets of Laredo; Dead Man's Walk; Comanche Moon ~200-202~ ^20, 21, 22^). That said, the most acclaimed of adaptations of his work surely remains The Last Picture Show [1971] {60}, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, and based on the novel of the same name [1966] ~64~. Terms of Endearment [1983] {61}, directed by James L Brooks and based on the novel of the same name [1975] ~65~, ranks highly as well. The Last Picture Show had a sequel, both novel [1987] ~66~ and film [1990] {62}: Texasville; as did Terms of Endearment: again both novel [1992] ~67~ and film [1996] {63}: The Evening Star. More films: Hud [1963] {64}, based on Horseman, Pass By [1961] ~68~; Lovin' Molly [1974] {65}, directed by Sidney Lumet, based on Leaving Cheyenne [1962] ~69~; and another T V mini-series: Buffalo Girls [1995] ^23^, based on the novel of the same name [1990] ~203~.\n\nLess Is More:\n\nThough filmmakers tend to make more from less (series from single novels) or at least (most?) more from more (series from series of novels), they can also make single films based on series of novels: the first-fourth of the eight Mary Poppins novels ~70, 71, 72, 73~ got turned into one film, Mary Poppins [1964] {66}. A series of books by Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir, The Destroyer, birthed only a single film, Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins [1985]. Further movies never came to be, though a television pilot, picking up where the film left off, made it to air.\n\nBut More Is Still More Too:\n\nWhile the category of novelizations of films and T.V series is a gargantuan one (see: Doctor Who) more compelling perhaps are novels based or expanding upon films and T.V series. Star Wars clearly became the leader in this regard in the early 1990's as several novelists, notably Timothy Zahn, offered their own take on what happened after the events depicted in the original trilogy. More compelling still, Twin Peaks has given rise to four novels that arguably play important roles in understanding the \"entire mystery\": The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer [1990] by Jennifer Lynch and My Life, My Tapes: The Autobiography of F B I Special Agent Dale Cooper [1991] by Scott Frost, both written during the show's first run, and Mark Frost's The Secret History of Twin Peaks [2016], published before the new series, and Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier [2017] coming soon after the new series concluded. Less significantly, Twin Peaks: An Access Guide to the Town [1991], by Gregg Almquist, is a parody of local tourist guides; and an audio-only \"book\" by Scott Frost, \"Diane...\" The Twin Peaks Tapes of Agent Cooper [1990], overlaps with the T.V series to an extent, perhaps also My Life, My Tapes (either way the content that is exclusive to it could presumably be incorporated into a new version of My Life, My Tapes). All of these books overlap to some extent with the two series but, like the Star Wars sequels and prequels, are not adaptations."
