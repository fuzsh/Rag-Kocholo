Published since 1878, Public Health Reports (PHR) is the official journal of the office of the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Public Health Service. PHR is published by SAGE Publishing Inc. through an agreement with the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH).

This peer-reviewed public health journal features bimonthly articles on public health practice, research, training, and writing. The oldest public health journal in US, PHR has covered throughout its history various important public health issues of the day. Explore the journal’s article collections on the health harms of racism and emerging viral pandemics as well as a 2010 special issue on 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics. PHR’s entire output since 1878 has been digitalized and is available on PubMed. It is summarized in the 2006 collection of commentaries by contemporary public health leaders highlighting the journal’s most impactful historic contributions and in the 2008 editorial celebrating the journal’s 140-year anniversary.

Information about the journal’s more recent content and publishing trends can be found in the Year in Review series of editorials. In 2021, PHR announced a call for submissions on COVID-19 and started a collection of articles on the public health response to the pandemic.

PHR also publishes "Surgeon General's Perspectives," in which the U.S. Surgeon General discusses important national public health issues.
