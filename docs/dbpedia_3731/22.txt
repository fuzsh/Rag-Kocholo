The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research examines the organization, financing, delivery and outcomes of behavioral health services (e.g., alcohol, drug abuse and mental disorders), providing practical and empirical contributions to, and explaining the implications for, the broader behavioral health field, particularly in the United States (U.S.).

Manuscripts from international authors are welcome provided submissions include relevancy to the U.S. population. Additionally, authors should develop an implications section that highlights the broader or overarching effects of their findings on behavioral health care, including within the U.S.

Published quarterly, each peer-reviewed issue includes an overview of contemporary concerns and recent developments in behavioral health policy and management; specifically, research articles, policy perspectives, commentaries, brief reports and book reviews.

This Journal is the official publication of the National Council for Mental Wellbeing.
