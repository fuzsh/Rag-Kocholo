        "text": "Synergi-Leeds, a partnership between the NHS, Public Health, and the local community and voluntary sectors (VCS), was named Mental Health Innovation of the Year at the awards ceremony on 16 November 2023.\n\nThe national HSJ Awards recognise outstanding contributions to healthcare across the country. This year they received a record-breaking 1,456 entries, and Synergi-Leeds was among the 223 projects and individuals to reach the final shortlist.\n\nThe Synergi-Leeds Partnership is a citywide approach to tackling ethnic inequalities in mental health. It began in 2017 as a collaboration between Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Leeds City Council’s Public Health team and other VCS services. It has since evolved into an ever-growing statutory and voluntary sector organisation network.\n\nInitially supported by the Synergi Collaborative Centre and latterly by Words of Colour, the partnership uses co-produced ‘Creative Spaces Events’ to champion the voices of people with lived experience, challenge prejudices, and galvanise people to act. There is also an all-age grants programme which financially supports grassroots projects.\n\nTheir focus has been to tackle the long-standing issue of the overrepresentation of people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities admitted to crisis mental health services or detained under the Mental Health Act. Statistics show Black people are more than four times as likely as white people to be detained under the Mental Health Act, and people from Black and Minority Ethnic groups are overrepresented in inpatient and crisis services, are less likely to have support from a GP before their admissions and are less likely to be referred for psychological therapies (also known as talking therapies).\n\nSharon Prince, consultant psychologist at the Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services in Leeds, said: “We’re absolutely delighted the Synergi partnership has won such a prestigious award. There is now a growing network of health, social care and third sector organisations helping to reduce ethnic inequalities in mental health.\n\n“This award is dedicated to Heather Nelson, chief executive of the Leeds Black Health Initiative, who sadly passed away in July 2023 and championed Synergi-Leeds from the start. Her commitment and passion to address ethnic inequalities in a creative and innovative way was inspirational to us all.”\n\nThe HSJ Awards judges said: “Synergi-Leeds Partnership is an innovative and ambitious citywide approach to tackling ethnic inequalities in mental health. The partnership’s growing network of statutory and voluntary sector organisations instrumentally supports one of the Leeds All-Age Mental Health Strategy priorities, reducing the overrepresentation of people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities admitted in crisis.\n\n“The Network adopts a whole system, life course approach, using co-produced Creative Spaces Events to centre the voices of people with lived experience and engage attendees through creative approaches, challenging prejudices and galvanising individuals to act.\n\n“Synergi also has an all-age grants programme supporting grassroots projects. The judges were impressed by the passion and enthusiasm displayed by this team. It’s clear that this programme is well organised and is achieving positive outcomes, demonstrating an exemplary use of the voice of lived experience.”\n\nImpact\n\nThe Synergi Leeds team were instrumental in key statutory and third sector organisations across the health and care sector to become signatories to the National Synergi Pledge, focusing on commitments to reduce ethnic inequalities in mental health. They have supported conversations which explicitly focus on racial equity for the citizens of Leeds with regard to mental health.\n\n“Synergi is a powerful piece of work that has influenced the senior leadership in Leeds, including myself.” (Jim Barwick, Chief executive of Leeds GP Confederation.)\n\n“As a provider of mental health services and a member of Synergi, we signed the Pledge and are committed to becoming more anti-racist and, as a consequence, have developed specific training for our employees and Trustees”. (Sinead Cregan, Director of Development and Innovation, Inspire North.)\n\nThe National Synergi Collaborative co-founding agency Words of Colour, the immersive Change Agency, produced and directed a 60-minute documentary on the work in Leeds. Watch it on YouTube.\n\nIn the first year of the grants’ programme, 800 people directly benefited, and over 5,000 people were engaged with projects in various ways, of which 3,600 were from minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\nMore about the HSJ Awards\n\nThe most coveted accolade in UK healthcare, the HSJ Awards, is the largest annual benchmarking and recognition programme for the health sector. Over the last 40 years, the awards have been celebrating healthcare excellence through huge political, technological and financial challenges within the sector.\n\nThrough a rigorous, fair and transparent judging process the awards produce a roll call of the best organisations, teams and people in the NHS and the wider health sector.\n\nWinners were announced during the awards ceremony at Evolution London on 16 November 2023.
