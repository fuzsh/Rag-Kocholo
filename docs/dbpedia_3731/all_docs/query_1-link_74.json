        "text": "Posted by Devon Partnership Trust in #ProudofDPT, News on 15th August, 2023\n\nWe are delighted to announce that our South West Provider Collaborative (SWPC) has been shortlisted in the category of Reducing Healthcare Inequalities for Children and Young People at this year’s HSJ Awards, recognising an outstanding contribution to healthcare and securing a place at the prestigious awards ceremony later this year.\n\nA ‘record-breaking’ 1,456 entries have been received for this year’s Awards, with 223 projects and individuals reaching the final shortlist, making it the biggest awards programme in the award’s 43-year history. The high volume and exceptional quality of applications once again reflects the impressive levels of innovation and care continually being developed within the UK’s healthcare networks.\n\nFollowing the judging process, our SWPC was shortlisted with its entry ‘Transforming access to, and experiences of, specialised mental health care for children and young people in the South West’, standing out as a real ‘success story’ worthy of a prized place on the panel’s shortlist.\n\nDr Jason Fee, SWPC Medical Director said: “This really is fantastic news! Being shortlisted in a year when the competition was so tough, with an unprecedented volume of entries from so many other equally deserving Trusts and individuals, is a huge boost for our team.”\n\n“Whatever the result ‘on the night’, we already feel like winners and are so proud to have the opportunity to share our learning with colleagues from across the entire sector.”\n\nThe selected winners will be announced during the awards ceremony at Evolution London on 16 November 2023."
