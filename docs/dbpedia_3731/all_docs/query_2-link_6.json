        "text": "Some thoughts in National Health Executive following our recent collaboration with the Social Market Foundation. Five themes tend to dominate public discussion about the NHS: money, clinical workforce, tech (including new medicines), malpractice and reorganisation. Yet, the evidence points to the critical role that management and leadership plays in all of them: value for money, making the best use of clinical staff whilst developing them, implementing new tech approaches, maintaining safe processes and ethical behaviour, and managing organisational change effectively. We found significant concerns about the quality of leadership in the NHS with 27% of managers saying their trust or other NHS workplace was not effectively led. If the NHS is to get through a very demanding period, focusing in on the quality of management and leadership is a very high priority. In fact, it's one of the key investments to deliver a fast return on investment in the form of better patient care. Chartered Management Institute #leadership #management #policy #management #health #care #NHS\n\nWhat are the top strategic priorities within NHS Trusts? On the 15th, 16th and 17th April 2024 the Healthcare Strategy Forum will bring together over 150 CIOs, CCIOs and other senior thought leaders from across the NHS to network, share best practice and find innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the sector. Insights into NHS organisations have revealed that ‚Äòimproving patient experience and safety‚Äô is the current top strategic priority for healthcare decision makers across the country. Additional priorities include ‚Äòmodernisation of service delivery models‚Äô and ‚Äòdeveloping programmes and initiatives for improving quality of care‚Äô.

However, the current configuration of healthcare systems leads to lack of collaboration and lack of trust and goodwill. These issues, which affect healthcare culture and outcomes, are not deliberate. They have arisen insidiously. These systems now need conscious examination. We can do better and we need to. I discuss these issues in 'From Hurting to Healing - Delivering Love to Medicine and Healthcare' All comments and opinions on this topic are welcomed. Listening to each other is how change commences. #healthcareadministration #healthcareleadership #organisationalculture\n\nIt‚Äôs great to see the West Yorkshire Health and Care Partnership featured in the NHS Confederation's ‚ÄòImproving health and care at scale‚Äô report by Sir Chris Ham published today in partnership with The Health Foundation. Our West Yorkshire Innovation Hub is mentioned as an example of collaborative work, demonstrating how our partnership seamlessly integrates staff into the system. Being embedded into the ICS allows for us to be aligned with local strategic priorities in order to spread and adopt good practice innovation that meets the needs of the population at scale. üì¢ https://lnkd.in/eScViUcP üì¢ #healthinnovation #healthtech #integratedcare #healthinequalities #healthsystems\n\nHospitals and health systems are increasingly turning to interim leadership as a strategic necessity, notes Brian Krehbiel in talking with Kelly Gooch of Becker's Healthcare. Organizations are finding they don't have the \"bench strength\" they've had in the past and so use interims to keep teams and initiatives moving forward, Brian says. Interims can also address some of the monumental challenges hospitals and health systems face today.
