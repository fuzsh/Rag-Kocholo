        "text": "Submission Checklist\n\nPlease:\n\nRead the Aims & Scope to gain an overview and assess if your manuscript is suitable for this journal;\n\nUse the Microsoft Word template or LaTeX template or Free Format Submission to prepare your manuscript;\n\nMake sure that issues about publication ethics, research ethics, copyright, authorship, figure formats, data and references format have been appropriately considered;\n\nEnsure that all authors have approved the content of the submitted manuscript and confirm that they read the Instructions for Authors.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to add a biography (optional) to the submission and post it to SciProfiles.\n\nManuscript Submission Overview\n\nTypes of Publications\n\nFull experimental details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. Healthcare requires that authors publish all experimental controls and make full datasets available where possible (see the guidelines on Supplementary Materials and references to unpublished data).\n\nManuscripts submitted to Healthcare should neither be published previously nor be under consideration for publication in another journal. The main article types are listed below and a comprehensive list of article types can be found here—please note that not all article types are available for all disciplines.\n\nArticle: These are original research manuscripts. The work should report scientifically sound experiments and provide a substantial amount of new information. The article should include the most recent and relevant references in the field. The structure should include an Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusions (optional) sections.\n\nReview: Reviews of the literature provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature in a field of study and identify current gaps or problems. Healthcare welcomes various types of reviews, such as narrative, scoping, systematic, umbrella, and mixed-methods reviews. Each type of review has a specific purpose, methodology, and reporting standard.\n\nNarrative reviews do not need a specific protocol, but they should still have a clear rationale and objective. They should conduct adequate literature searches, and critically and constructively evaluate the literature. They should also provide recommendations for future research. They should not present any new, unpublished data.\n\nSystematic, scoping, and umbrella reviews conduct a detailed investigation of previous research on a given topic using clearly defined review question(s) and methods to identify, select, evaluate, analyze, and report aggregated evidence on a specific topic. These types of reviews should follow the PRISMA checklist (https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020-statement) strictly and include a completed PRISMA flow diagram as part of the main text or Supplementary Materials. Templates for the flow diagram can be downloaded from the PRISMA website. We strongly recommend authors to register their detailed protocols before data extraction starts in a public registry such as PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/). Authors must include a statement about following the PRISMA guidelines and registration information (if available) in the Methods section.\n\nAdditionally, scoping, systematic, umbrella, and mixed-methods reviews should perform comprehensive literature searches that include at least one American database (e.g., PubMed and Web of Science) and at least one European database (e.g., Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library). Authors should use relevant databases that match the topic and scope of their research question. They should also describe the search strategy, selection criteria, data extraction, quality assessment, and synthesis methods in detail.\n\nAll review papers should have the following structure: Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusions.\n\nSubmission Process\n\nManuscripts for Healthcare should be submitted online at susy.mdpi.com. The submitting author, who is generally the corresponding author, is responsible for the manuscript during the submission and peer review process. The submitting author must ensure that all eligible co-authors have been included in the author list (read the criteria to qualify for authorship) and that they have all read and approved the submitted version of the manuscript. To submit your manuscript, register and log in to the submission website. Once you have registered, click here to go to the submission form for Healthcare. All co-authors can see the manuscript details in the submission system, if they register and log in using the e-mail address provided during manuscript submission.\n\nAccepted File Formats\n\nAuthors are encouraged to use the Microsoft Word template or LaTeX template to prepare their manuscript. Using the template file will substantially shorten the time to complete copy-editing and publication of accepted manuscripts. The total amount of data for all files must not exceed 120 MB. If this is a problem, please contact the Editorial Office [email protected]. Accepted file formats are:\n\nMicrosoft Word: Manuscripts prepared in Microsoft Word must be converted into a single file before submission. When preparing manuscripts in Microsoft Word, we encourage you to use the Healthcare Microsoft Word template file. Please insert your graphics (schemes, figures, etc.) in the main text after the paragraph of its first citation.\n\nLaTeX: Manuscripts prepared in LaTeX must be collated into one ZIP folder (including all source files and images, so that the Editorial Office can recompile the submitted PDF). When preparing manuscripts in LaTeX, we encourage you to use the Healthcare LaTeX template files. You can now also use the online application writeLaTeX to submit articles directly to Healthcare. The MDPI LaTeX template file should be selected from the writeLaTeX template gallery.\n\nSupplementary files: May be any format, but it is recommended that you use common, non-proprietary formats where possible (see below for further details).\n\nDisclaimer: Usage of these templates is exclusively intended for submission to the journal for peer review, and strictly limited to this purpose and it cannot be used for posting online on preprint servers or other websites.\n\nFree Format Submission\n\nHealthcare now accepts free format submission:\n\nWe do not have strict formatting requirements, but all manuscripts must contain the required sections: Author Information, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials & Methods, Results, Conclusions, Figures and Tables with Captions, Funding Information, Author Contributions, Conflict of Interest and other Ethics Statements. Check the Journal Instructions for Authors for more details.\n\nYour references may be in any style, provided that you use the consistent formatting throughout. It is essential to include author(s) name(s), journal or book title, article or chapter title (where required), year of publication, volume and issue (where appropriate) and pagination. DOI numbers (Digital Object Identifier) are not mandatory but highly encouraged. The bibliography software package EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley, Reference Manager are recommended.\n\nWhen your manuscript reaches the revision stage, you will be requested to format the manuscript according to the journal guidelines.\n\nCover Letter\n\nA cover letter must be included with each manuscript submission. It should be concise and explain why the content of the paper is significant, placing the findings in the context of existing work. It should explain why the manuscript fits the scope of the journal.\n\nAny prior submissions of the manuscript to MDPI journals must be acknowledged. If this is the case, it is strongly recommended that the previous manuscript ID is provided in the submission system, which will ease your current submission process. The names of proposed and excluded reviewers should be provided in the submission system, not in the cover letter.\n\nAll cover letters are required to include the following statements:\n\nWe confirm that neither the manuscript nor any parts of its content are currently under consideration for publication with or published in another journal.\n\nAll authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to Healthcare.\n\nAuthor Identification\n\nAuthors are encouraged to add a biography (300–1500 characters) to the submission and upload it to SciProfiles. This should be a single paragraph and should contain the following points:\n\nAuthors’ full names followed by current positions;\n\nEducation background including institution information and year of graduation (type and level of degree received);\n\nWork experience;\n\nCurrent and previous research interests;\n\nMemberships of professional societies and awards received.\n\nIf a manuscript is accepted for publication, we will add an icon linking to your online ORCID profile in the final version of the published paper.\n\nAuthor Affiliation\n\nAll authors should list their current affiliation and the affiliation where most research was carried out for the preparation of their manuscript. We recommend adding as primary the affiliation where most of the research was conducted or supported, but please check with your institution for any contractual agreement requirements.\n\nIt is very important that author names and affiliations are correct. Incorrect information can mean a lack of proper attribution or incorrect citation and can even lead to problems with promotion or funding. After the publication of an article, updates or corrections to the author’s address or affiliation may not be permitted.\n\nIndependent Researcher\n\nIf one or all the authors are not currently affiliated with a university, institution or company, or have not been during the development of the manuscript, they should list themselves as an “Independent Researcher”.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nManuscript Preparation\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nResearch manuscripts should comprise:\n\nFront matter: Title, Author list, Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords.\n\nResearch manuscript sections: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions (optional).\n\nBack matter: Supplementary Materials, Acknowledgments, Author Contributions, Conflicts of Interest, References.\n\nReview manuscripts should comprise:\n\nFront matter: Title, Author list, Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords.\n\nReview sections: a literature review organized logically within specific sections and subsections (optional).\n\nBack matter: Acknowledgments, Author Contributions, Conflicts of Interest, References.\n\nThe template file can be also used to prepare the front and back matter of your review manuscript. It is not necessary to follow the remaining structure.\n\nStructured reviews and meta-analyses should use the same structure as research articles and should ensure they conform to the PRISMA guidelines.\n\nCase reports should include a succinct introduction about the general medical condition or relevant symptoms that will be discussed in the case report; the case presentation including all of the relevant de-identified demographic and descriptive information about the patient(s), and a description of the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome; a discussion providing context and any necessary explanation of specific treatment decisions; a conclusion briefly outlining the take-home message and the lessons learned.\n\nGraphical Abstract:\n\nA graphical abstract (GA) is an image that appears alongside the text abstract in the Table of Contents. In addition to summarizing the content, it should represent the topic of the article in an attention-grabbing way. Moreover, it should not be exactly the same as the Figure in the paper or just a simple superposition of several subfigures. Note that the GA must be original and unpublished artwork. Any postage stamps, currency from any country, or trademarked items should not be included in it.\n\nThe GA should be a high-quality illustration or diagram in any of the following formats: PNG, JPEG, or TIFF. Written text in a GA should be clear and easy to read, using one of the following fonts: Times, Arial, Courier, Helvetica, Ubuntu or Calibri.\n\nThe minimum required size for the GA is 560 × 1100 pixels (height × width). The size should be of high quality in order to reproduce well.\n\nAcronyms/Abbreviations/Initialisms should be defined the first time they appear in each of three sections: the abstract; the main text; the first figure or table. When defined for the first time, the acronym/abbreviation/initialism should be added in parentheses after the written-out form.\n\nSI Units (International System of Units) should be used. Imperial, US customary and other units should be converted to SI units whenever possible.\n\nAccession numbers of RNA, DNA and protein sequences used in the manuscript should be provided in the Materials and Methods section.

Archived websites should be cited using the link provided as follows:\n\n10. Title of Site. URL (archived on Day Month Year).\n\nSee the Reference List and Citations Guide for more detailed information.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nPreparing Figures, Schemes and Tables\n\nHealthcare can publish multimedia files in articles or as supplementary materials. Please contact the editorial office for further information.\n\nAll Figures, Schemes and Tables should be inserted into the main text close to their first citation and must be numbered following their number of appearance (Figure 1, Scheme 1, Figure 2, Scheme 2, Table 1, etc.).\n\nAll Figures, Schemes and Tables should have a short explanatory title and caption.\n\nAll table columns should have an explanatory heading. To facilitate the copy-editing of larger tables, smaller fonts may be used, but no less than 8 pt. in size. Authors should use the Table option of Microsoft Word to create tables.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to prepare figures and schemes in color (RGB at 8-bit per channel). There is no additional cost for publishing full color graphics.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nOriginal Images Requirements\n\nTo ensure the integrity and scientific validity of digital images, the Editorial Office reserves the right to request original, uncropped, and unadjusted images upon submission. Original images must be provided as Supplementary Material files at a sufficiently high resolution (a minimum of 1000 pixels in width/height, or a resolution of 300 dpi or higher) or a link where original unprocessed images were deposited at the time of initial submission. Preferred formats for microscopy images (light and electron microscopy e.g., TEM, SEM, Cryo-EM, etc.) are TIFF, PNG, GIF, and EPS. Failing to provide original images before the final decision might result in the rejection of the paper, and the issue may be raised with the authors' institutions.\n\nDigital images within the manuscript submitted should be minimally processed. A certain degree of image processing is acceptable for publication, but the final image must correctly represent the original data and conform to community standards. Please note that electron microscopy images submitted with a manuscript should be presented in full, without cropping the image, and with all the relevant details clearly visible.\n\nWhere cropped images are shown in figures, a full scan of the entire original image(s) must be submitted as part of the Supplementary Material. Where control images are re-used for illustrative purposes, this must be clearly declared in the figure legend. If any form of image processing is legitimately required for the interpretation of the data, the software and the enhancement technique used must be declared in the methods section of the manuscript. Image grouping and splicing must be clearly stated in the manuscript and the figure text.\n\nThe use of software filters to improve image quality is not recommended. Slight adjustments to contrast settings, brightness, intensity, color, etc., are generally acceptable but must be applied equally to the entire image. Excessive image manipulations that are specific to one area of an image and are not performed on other areas are considered part of a non-ethical practice of image processing, as this emphasizes experimental data relative to the control.\n\nImages gathered at different times or from different locations should not be combined into a single image unless it is stated that the resultant image is a product of time-averaged data or a time lapse sequence. If juxtaposing images are essential, the borders should be clearly demarcated in the figure and described in the legend.\n\nWe encourage the inclusion of the following with the final revised version of the manuscript for publication:\n\nIn the Methods section, specify the type of equipment (microscopes/objective lenses, cameras, detectors, filter model, and batch number), the acquisition software used, and the magnification or the scale bar in the figure caption. Although we appreciate that there is some variation between instruments, equipment settings for critical measurements should also be listed.\n\nWe encourage the deposition of unprocessed image files in a publicly available database (a link to the downloadable table from data availability instructions should be shared here) (including relevant metadata for acquisition information, including time and space resolution data (xyzt and pixel dimensions); image bit depth; experimental conditions such as temperature and imaging medium; and fluorochromes (excitation and emission wavelengths or ranges, filters, and dichroic beam splitters) if any).\n\nProcessing software should be named in the Methods section and any manipulations should be indicated in the relevant figure legends (such as type of deconvolution, three-dimensional reconstructions, surface and volume rendering, “gamma changes”, filtering, thresholding, and projection).\n\nComprehensive guidelines on data management and the ethical handling of digital images can obtained from The Office of Research Integrity: http://ori.hhs.gov/images/ddblock/data.pdf\n\nMDPI is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics and takes the responsibility to uphold strict ethical policies and standards very seriously.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nSupplementary Materials, Data Deposit and Software Source Code\n\nMDPI Research Data Policies\n\nMDPI is committed to supporting open scientific exchange and enabling our authors to achieve best practices in sharing and archiving research data. We encourage all authors of articles published in MDPI journals to share their research data including, but not limited to protocols, analytic methods, raw data, processed data, code, software, algorithms, and study material. The data should be FAIR – findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable – so that other researchers can locate and use the data.\n\nWe recommend that data and code should be deposited in a trusted repository that will allow for maximum reuse (see the Data Preservation section below). If this is not possible, authors are encouraged to share the specific reason in the Data Availability Statement and make this material available upon request to interested researchers. In addition, research materials necessary to enable the reproduction of an experiment should be indicated in the Materials and Methods section. Individual journal guidelines can be found at the journal ‘Instructions for Authors’ page. Data sharing policies concern the minimal dataset that supports the central findings of a published study. Generated data should be publicly available and cited in accordance with journal guidelines.\n\nMDPI data policies are informed by TOP Guidelines.\n\nWhere ethical, legal, or privacy issues are present, data should not be shared. The authors should clarify the availability status of the data upon submission and make any limitations or exceptions clear in the Data Availability Statement. Authors should ensure that the data shared is in accordance with consent provided by participants on the use of confidential data. Authors should ensure that the publication of such data does not compromise the anonymity of the participants or breach local data protection laws.\n\nIn situations where access is restricted to protect confidential or proprietary information, authors will be requested to clearly explain the restrictions on the dataset and make the data available upon request, with permission for the purposes of peer review.\n\nMDPI recognizes that some institutions and funding agencies only require the retention of research data for a finite period after a project’s completion or publication. However, there are no such limits specified within the MDPI Data Availability Policy and, therefore, we encourage the authors to archive their research data through appropriate data repositories or provide us with minimal datasets within Supplementary Material.\n\nData availability statements\n\nData availability statements are required for all articles published with MDPI. During the peer review and editorial decision process, authors can be asked to share existing datasets or raw data that have been analyzed in the manuscript, and whether they will be made available to other researchers following publication. Authors will also be asked for the details of any existing datasets that have been analyzed in the manuscript.\n\nBelow are the recommended Data Availability Statements:\n\nData availability status Recommended Data Availability Statement Data available in a publicly accessible repository The original data presented in the study are openly available in [repository name, e.g., FigShare] at [DOI/URL] or [reference/accession number]. Data available on request due to restrictions (e.g., privacy, legal or ethical reasons) The data presented in this study are available on request from the corresponding author due to (specify the reason for the restriction). 3rd Party Data Restrictions apply to the availability of these data. Data were obtained from [third party] and are available [from the authors/at URL] with the permission of [third party]. Embargo on data due to commercial restrictions The data that support the findings will be available in [repository name] at [URL / DOI link] following an embargo from the date of publication to allow for commercialization of research findings. Restrictions apply to the datasets The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because [include reason, e.g., the data are part of an ongoing study or due to technical/ time limitations]. Requests to access the datasets should be directed to [text input]. Data derived from public domain resources The data presented in this study are available in [repository name] at [URL/DOI], reference number [reference number]. These data were derived from the following resources available in the public domain: [list resources and URLs] Data sharing is not applicable (only appropriate if no new data is generated or the article describes entirely theoretical research No new data were created or analyzed in this study. Data sharing is not applicable to this article Data is contained within the article or supplementary material The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. Dataset available on request from the authors The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors on request.\n\nData preservation\n\nMDPI acknowledges that researchers, institutions, journals, and data repositories have a shared responsibility to ensure long-term data preservation, and MDPI encourages authors to select data repositories with this goal in mind.\n\nMDPI encourages authors to commit to preserving their datasets on their laboratory or institutional servers, for at least five years after publication. If, during that time, the repository to which the data were originally submitted disappears or experiences data loss, we may ask the authors to upload the data to another repository and publish a correction or update to the original publication.\n\nIf authors remove their data from the original public repository or change access criteria in a manner that is inconsistent with the publication, we may ask authors to notify the editorial office as soon as possible.\n\nHow to choose an appropriate data repository\n\nMDPI encourages the submission of data to community-recognized data repositories where possible. We recommend the authors visit re3data.org or fairsharing.org to help identify registered and certified data repositories relevant to their subject area if no community resource is available. If the authors’ institution has its generalist data repository this can be used to host authors’ data as long as the repository can mint DataCite DOIs, and allows for data to be shared under open terms of use (for example the CC0 waiver).\n\nData repository criteria\n\nThe following criteria should be considered when selecting an appropriate repository, ensuring that platforms:\n\nEnsure long-term persistence and preservation of datasets in their published form;\n\nProvide stable identifiers for submitted datasets (DOIs in most cases);\n\nAllow public access to data without barriers, such as logins or paywalls;\n\nSupport open licenses (CC0 and CC-BY, or their equivalents, are required in most cases);\n\nProvide confidential review of submitted datasets without the requirement for reviewers to provide identifying information.\n\nData citation\n\nAuthors are encouraged to formally cite any datasets stored in external repositories that are mentioned within their manuscript, including the main datasets that are the focus of the submission, as well as any other datasets that have been used in the work. For previously published datasets, authors should cite both the related research articles and the datasets themselves. Appropriate citation of data is checked and enforced by Journal Editorial staff before publication.\n\nComputer Code and Software\n\nFor work where novel computer code was developed, authors should release the code either by depositing in a recognized, public repository or uploading as supplementary information to the publication. The name and version of all software used should be clearly indicated.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nAdditional data and files can be uploaded as \"Supplementary Files\" during the manuscript submission process. The supplementary files will also be available to the referees as part of the peer review process. Any file format is acceptable, however we recommend that common, non-proprietary formats are used where possible. For more information on supplementary materials, please refer to https://www.mdpi.com/authors/layout#_bookmark83.\n\nUnpublished Data\n\nRestrictions on data availability should be noted during submission and in the manuscript. \"Data not shown\" should be avoided: authors are encouraged to publish all observations related to the submitted manuscript as Supplementary Material. \"Unpublished data\" intended for publication in a manuscript that is either planned, \"in preparation\" or \"submitted\" but not yet accepted, should be cited in the text and a reference should be added in the References section. \"Personal Communication\" should also be cited in the text and reference added in the References section. (see also the MDPI reference list and citations style guide).\n\nRemote Hosting and Large Data Sets\n\nData may be deposited with specialized service providers or institutional/subject repositories, preferably those that use the DataCite mechanism. Large data sets and files greater than 60 MB must be deposited in this way. For a list of other repositories specialized in scientific and experimental data, please consult databib.org or re3data.org. The data repository name, link to the data set (URL) and accession number, doi or handle number of the data set must be provided in the paper. The journal Data also accepts submissions of data set papers.\n\nDeposition of Sequences and Expression Data\n\nNew sequence information must be deposited to the appropriate database prior to submission of the manuscript. Accession numbers provided by the database should be included in the submitted manuscript. Manuscripts will not be published until the accession number is provided.\n\nNew nucleic acid sequences must be deposited into an acceptable repository such as GenBank, EMBL, or DDBJ. Sequences should be submitted to only one database.\n\nNew high throughput sequencing (HTS) datasets (RNA-seq, ChIP-Seq, degradome analysis, …) must be deposited either in the GEO database or in the NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive.\n\nNew microarray data must be deposited either in the GEO or the ArrayExpress databases.The \"Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment\" (MIAME) guidelines published by the Microarray Gene Expression Data Society must be followed.\n\nNew protein sequences obtained by protein sequencing must be submitted to UniProt (submission tool SPIN).\n\nAll sequence names and the accession numbers provided by the databases should be provided in the Materials and Methods section of the article.\n\nReferences in Supplementary Files\n\nCitations and References in Supplementary files are permitted provided that they also appear in the reference list of the main text.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nResearch and Publication Ethics\n\nResearch Ethics\n\nResearch Involving Human Subjects\n\nWhen reporting on research that involves human subjects, human material, human tissues, or human data, authors must declare that the investigations were carried out following the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 (https://www.wma.net/what-we-do/medical-ethics/declaration-of-helsinki/), revised in 2013. According to point 23 of this declaration, an approval from the local institutional review board (IRB) or other appropriate ethics committee must be obtained before undertaking the research to confirm the study meets national and international guidelines. As a minimum, a statement including the project identification code, date of approval, and name of the ethics committee or institutional review board must be stated in Section ‘Institutional Review Board Statement’ of the article.\n\nExample of an ethical statement: \"All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of XXX (Project identification code).\"\n\nFor non-interventional studies (e.g. surveys, questionnaires, social media research), all participants must be fully informed if the anonymity is assured, why the research is being conducted, how their data will be used and if there are any risks associated. As with all research involving humans, ethical approval from an appropriate ethics committee must be obtained prior to conducting the study. If ethical approval is not required, authors must either provide an exemption from the ethics committee or are encouraged to cite the local or national legislation that indicates ethics approval is not required for this type of study. Where a study has been granted exemption, the name of the ethics committee which provided this should be stated in Section ‘Institutional Review Board Statement’ with a full explanation regarding why ethical approval was not required.\n\nA written informed consent for publication must be obtained from participating patients. Data relating to individual participants must be described in detail, but private information identifying participants need not be included unless the identifiable materials are of relevance to the research (for example, photographs of participants’ faces that show a particular symptom). Patients’ initials or other personal identifiers must not appear in any images. For manuscripts that include any case details, personal information, and/or images of patients, authors must obtain signed informed consent for publication from patients (or their relatives/guardians) before submitting to an MDPI journal. Patient details must be anonymized as far as possible, e.g., do not mention specific age, ethnicity, or occupation where they are not relevant to the conclusions. A template permission form is available to download. A blank version of the form used to obtain permission (without the patient names or signature) must be uploaded with your submission. Editors reserve the right to reject any submission that does not meet these requirements.\n\nYou may refer to our sample form and provide an appropriate form after consulting with your affiliated institution. For the purposes of publishing in MDPI journals, a consent, permission, or release form should include unlimited permission for publication in all formats (including print, electronic, and online), in sublicensed and reprinted versions (including translations and derived works), and in other works and products under open access license. To respect patients’ and any other individual’s privacy, please do not send signed forms. The journal reserves the right to ask authors to provide signed forms if necessary.\n\nIf the study reports research involving vulnerable groups, an additional check may be performed. The submitted manuscript will be scrutinized by the editorial office and upon request, documentary evidence (blank consent forms and any related discussion documents from the ethics board) must be supplied. Additionally, when studies describe groups by race, ethnicity, gender, disability, disease, etc., explanation regarding why such categorization was needed must be clearly stated in the article.\n\nEthical Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Research\n\nThe editors will require that the benefits potentially derived from any research causing harm to animals are significant in relation to any cost endured by animals, and that procedures followed are unlikely to cause offense to the majority of readers. Authors should particularly ensure that their research complies with the commonly-accepted '3Rs [1]':\n\nReplacement of animals by alternatives wherever possible,\n\nReduction in number of animals used, and\n\nRefinement of experimental conditions and procedures to minimize the harm to animals.\n\nAuthors must include details on housing, husbandry and pain management in their manuscript.\n\nFor further guidance authors should refer to the Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Used in Scientific Procedures [2], American Association for Laboratory Animal Science [3] or European Animal Research Association [4].\n\nIf national legislation requires it, studies involving vertebrates or higher invertebrates must only be carried out after obtaining approval from the appropriate ethics committee. As a minimum, the project identification code, date of approval and name of the ethics committee or institutional review board should be stated in Section ‘Institutional Review Board Statement’. Research procedures must be carried out in accordance with national and institutional regulations. Statements on animal welfare should confirm that the study complied with all relevant legislation. Clinical studies involving animals and interventions outside of routine care require ethics committee oversight as per the American Veterinary Medical Association. If the study involved client-owned animals, informed client consent must be obtained and certified in the manuscript report of the research. Owners must be fully informed if there are any risks associated with the procedures and that the research will be published. If available, a high standard of veterinary care must be provided. Authors are responsible for correctness of the statements provided in the manuscript.\n\nIf ethical approval is not required by national laws, authors must provide an exemption from the ethics committee, if one is available. Where a study has been granted exemption, the name of the ethics committee that provided this should be stated in Section ‘Institutional Review Board Statement’ with a full explanation on why the ethical approval was not required.\n\nIf no animal ethics committee is available to review applications, authors should be aware that the ethics of their research will be evaluated by reviewers and editors. Authors should provide a statement justifying the work from an ethical perspective, using the same utilitarian framework that is used by ethics committees. Authors may be asked to provide this even if they have received ethical approval.\n\nMDPI endorses the ARRIVE guidelines (arriveguidelines.org/) for reporting experiments using live animals. Authors and reviewers must use the ARRIVE guidelines as a checklist, which can be found at https://arriveguidelines.org/sites/arrive/files/documents/ARRIVE%20Compliance%20Questionnaire.pdf. Editors reserve the right to ask for the checklist and to reject submissions that do not adhere to these guidelines, to reject submissions based on ethical or animal welfare concerns or if the procedure described does not appear to be justified by the value of the work presented.\n\nNSW Department of Primary Industries and Animal Research Review Panel.

Available online: https://www.eara.eu/animal-research-law\n\nResearch Involving Cell Lines\n\nMethods sections for submissions reporting on research with cell lines should state the origin of any cell lines. For established cell lines the provenance should be stated and references must also be given to either a published paper or to a commercial source. If previously unpublished de novo cell lines were used, including those gifted from another laboratory, details of institutional review board or ethics committee approval must be given, and confirmation of written informed consent must be provided if the line is of human origin.\n\nAn example of Ethical Statements:\n\nThe HCT116 cell line was obtained from XXXX. The MLH1+ cell line was provided by XXXXX, Ltd. The DLD-1 cell line was obtained from Dr. XXXX. The DR-GFP and SA-GFP reporter plasmids were obtained from Dr. XXX and the Rad51K133A expression vector was obtained from Dr. XXXX.\n\nResearch Involving Plants\n\nExperimental research on plants (either cultivated or wild) including collection of plant material, must comply with institutional, national, or international guidelines. We recommend that authors comply with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n\nFor each submitted manuscript supporting genetic information and origin must be provided. For research manuscripts involving rare and non-model plants (other than, e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, Oryza sativa, or many other typical model plants), voucher specimens must be deposited in an accessible herbarium or museum. Vouchers may be requested for review by future investigators to verify the identity of the material used in the study (especially if taxonomic rearrangements occur in the future). They should include details of the populations sampled on the site of collection (GPS coordinates), date of collection, and document the part(s) used in the study where appropriate. For rare, threatened or endangered species this can be waived but it is necessary for the author to describe this in the cover letter.\n\nEditors reserve the rights to reject any submission that does not meet these requirements.\n\nAn example of Ethical Statements:\n\nTorenia fournieri plants were used in this study. White-flowered Crown White (CrW) and violet-flowered Crown Violet (CrV) cultivars selected from ‘Crown Mix’ (XXX Company, City, Country) were kindly provided by Dr. XXX (XXX Institute, City, Country).\n\nArabidopis mutant lines (SALKxxxx, SAILxxxx,…) were kindly provided by Dr. XXX, institute, city, country).\n\nClinical Trials Registration\n\nRegistration\n\nMDPI follows the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines which require and recommend registration of clinical trials in a public trials registry at or before the time of first patient enrollment as a condition of consideration for publication.\n\nPurely observational studies do not require registration. A clinical trial not only refers to studies that take place in a hospital or involve pharmaceuticals, but also refer to all studies which involve participant randomization and group classification in the context of the intervention under assessment.\n\nAuthors are strongly encouraged to pre-register clinical trials with an international clinical trials register and cite a reference to the registration in the Methods section. Suitable databases include clinicaltrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register and those listed by the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.\n\nApproval to conduct a study from an independent local, regional, or national review body is not equivalent to prospective clinical trial registration. MDPI reserves the right to decline any paper without trial registration for further peer review. However, if the study protocol has been published before the enrolment, the registration can be waived with correct citation of the published protocol.\n\nCONSORT Statement\n\nMDPI requires a completed CONSORT 2010 checklist and flow diagram as a condition of submission when reporting the results of a randomized trial. Templates for these can be found here or on the CONSORT website (http://www.consort-statement.org) which also describes several CONSORT checklist extensions for different designs and types of data beyond two group parallel trials. At minimum, your article should report the content addressed by each item of the checklist.\n\nDual Use Research of Concern\n\nMDPI follows the practical framework defined in Guidance for Editors: Research, Audit and Service Evaluations and introduced by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Research that could pose a significant threat, with broad potential consequences to public health or national security, should be clearly indicated in the manuscript, and potential dual-use research of concern should be explained in the cover letter upon submission. Potential areas of concern include but are not limited to biosecurity, nuclear and chemical threats, and research with a military purpose or application, etc. For these manuscripts to be considered for peer review, the benefits to the general public or public health must outweigh the risks. The authors have a responsibility to comply with relevant national and international laws.\n\nSex and Gender in Research\n\nWe encourage our authors to follow the ‘Sex and Gender Equity in Research – SAGER – guidelines’ and to include sex and gender considerations where relevant. Authors should use the terms sex (biological attribute) and gender (shaped by social and cultural circumstances) carefully in order to avoid confusing both terms. Article titles and/or abstracts should indicate clearly what sex(es) the study applies to. Authors should also describe in the background, whether sex and/or gender differences may be expected; report how sex and/or gender were accounted for in the design of the study; provide disaggregated data by sex and/or gender, where appropriate; and discuss respective results. If a sex and/or gender analysis was not conducted, the rationale should be given in the Discussion. We suggest that our authors consult the full guidelines before submission.\n\nBorders and Territories\n\nPotential disputes over borders and territories may have particular relevance for authors in describing their research or in an author or editor correspondence address, and should be respected. Content decisions are an editorial matter and where there is a potential or perceived dispute or complaint, the editorial team will attempt to find a resolution that satisfies parties involved.\n\nMDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nPublication Ethics Statement\n\nHealthcare is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). We fully adhere to its Code of Conduct and to its Best Practice Guidelines.\n\nThe editors of this journal enforce a rigorous peer review process together with strict ethical policies and standards to ensure to add high quality scientific works to the field of scholarly publication. Unfortunately, cases of plagiarism, data falsification, image manipulation, inappropriate authorship credit, and the like, do arise. The editors of Healthcare take such publishing ethics issues very seriously and are trained to proceed in such cases with a zero tolerance policy.\n\nAuthors wishing to publish their papers in Healthcare must abide to the following:\n\nAny facts that might be perceived as a possible conflict of interest of the author(s) must be disclosed in the paper prior to submission.\n\nAuthors should accurately present their research findings and include an objective discussion of the significance of their findings.\n\nData and methods used in the research need to be presented in sufficient detail in the paper, so that other researchers can replicate the work.\n\nRaw data should preferably be publicly deposited by the authors before submission of their manuscript. Authors need to at least have the raw data readily available for presentation to the referees and the editors of the journal, if requested. Authors need to ensure appropriate measures are taken so that raw data is retained in full for a reasonable time after publication.\n\nSimultaneous submission of manuscripts to more than one journal is not tolerated.\n\nThe journal accepts exact translations of previously published work. All submissions of translations must conform with our policies on translations.\n\nIf errors and inaccuracies are found by the authors after publication of their paper, they need to be promptly communicated to the editors of this journal so that appropriate actions can be taken. Please refer to our policy regarding Updating Published Papers.\n\nYour manuscript should not contain any information that has already been published. If you include already published figures or images, please obtain the necessary permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CC-BY license. For further information, see the Rights and Permissions page.\n\nPlagiarism, data fabrication and image manipulation are not tolerated.\n\nPlagiarism is not acceptable in Healthcare submissions.\n\nPlagiarism includes copying text, ideas, images, or data from another source, even from your own publications, without giving any credit to the original source.\n\nReuse of text that is copied from another source must be between quotes and the original source must be cited. If a study's design or the manuscript's structure or language has been inspired by previous works, these works must be explicitly cited.\n\nAll MDPI submissions are checked for plagiarism using the industry standard software iThenticate. If plagiarism is detected during the peer review process, the manuscript may be rejected. If plagiarism is detected after publication, an investigation will take place and action taken in accordance with our policies.\n\nImage files must not be manipulated or adjusted in any way that could lead to misinterpretation of the information provided by the original image.\n\nIrregular manipulation includes: 1) introduction, enhancement, moving, or removing features from the original image; 2) grouping of images that should obviously be presented separately (e.g., from different parts of the same gel, or from different gels); or 3) modifying the contrast, brightness or color balance to obscure, eliminate or enhance some information.\n\nIf irregular image manipulation is identified and confirmed during the peer review process, we may reject the manuscript. If irregular image manipulation is identified and confirmed after publication, we may correct or retract the paper.\n\nOur in-house editors will investigate any allegations of publication misconduct and may contact the authors' institutions or funders if necessary. If evidence of misconduct is found, appropriate action will be taken to correct or retract the publication. Authors are expected to comply with the best ethical publication practices when publishing with MDPI.\n\nCitation Policy\n\nAuthors should ensure that where material is taken from other sources (including their own published writing) the source is clearly cited and that where appropriate permission is obtained.\n\nAuthors should not engage in excessive self-citation of their own work.\n\nAuthors should not copy references from other publications if they have not read the cited work.\n\nAuthors should not preferentially cite their own or their friends’, peers’, or institution’s publications.\n\nAuthors should not cite advertisements or advertorial material.\n\nIn accordance with COPE guidelines, we expect that “original wording taken directly from publications by other researchers should appear in quotation marks with the appropriate citations.” This condition also applies to an author’s own work. COPE have produced a discussion document on citation manipulation with recommendations for best practice.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nReviewer Suggestions\n\nDuring the submission process, please suggest three potential reviewers with the appropriate expertise to review the manuscript. The editors will not necessarily approach these referees. Please provide detailed contact information (address, homepage, phone, e-mail address). The proposed referees should neither be current collaborators of the co-authors nor have published with any of the co-authors of the manuscript within the last three years. Proposed reviewers should be from different institutions to the authors. You may identify appropriate Editorial Board members of the journal as potential reviewers. You may suggest reviewers from among the authors that you frequently cite in your paper. For detailed information regarding the qualifications and responsibilities of the reviewers, please visit https://www.mdpi.com/reviewers.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nExtensive English Editing\n\nIt is the authors’ responsibility to submit their work in correct English. The APC includes only minor English editing, conducted by native English speakers. The APC does not include extensive English editing. If extensive editing is required, your paper could be returned to you at the English editing stage of the publication process. This could delay the publication of your work. You may have your work reviewed by an experienced English-speaking colleague or use a paid language-editing service before submitting your paper for publication. We offer rapid English editing, completed in 1 day, here: Author Services.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nPreprints and Conference Papers\n\nHealthcare accepts submissions that have previously been made available as preprints provided that they have not undergone peer review. A preprint is a draft version of a paper made available online before submission to a journal.\n\nMDPI operates Preprints, a preprint server to which submitted papers can be uploaded directly after completing journal submission. Note that Preprints operates independently of the journal and posting a preprint does not affect the peer review process. Check the Preprints instructions for authors for further information.\n\nExpanded and high-quality conference papers can be considered as articles if they fulfill the following requirements: (1) the paper should be expanded to the size of a research article; (2) the conference paper should be cited and noted on the first page of the paper; (3) if the authors do not hold the copyright of the published conference paper, authors should seek the appropriate permission from the copyright holder; (4) authors are asked to disclose that it is conference paper in their cover letter and include a statement on what has been changed compared to the original conference paper. Healthcare does not publish pilot studies or studies with inadequate statistical power.\n\nUnpublished conference papers that do not meet the above conditions are recommended to be submitted to the Proceedings Series journals.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nAuthorship\n\nMDPI follows the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines which state that, in order to qualify for authorship of a manuscript, the following criteria should be observed:\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND\n\nDrafting the work or reviewing it critically for important intellectual content; AND\n\nFinal approval of the version to be published; AND\n\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nThose who contributed to the work but do not qualify for authorship should be listed in the acknowledgments. More detailed guidance on authorship is given by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE).\n\nAny change to the author list should be approved by all authors including any who have been removed from the list. The corresponding author should act as a point of contact between the editor and the other authors and should keep co-authors informed and involve them in major decisions about the publication. We reserve the right to request confirmation that all authors meet the authorship conditions.\n\nFor more details about authorship please check MDPI ethics website.\n\nEditorial Independence\n\nLack of Interference with Editorial Decisions\n\nEditorial independence is of utmost importance and MDPI does not interfere with editorial decisions. All articles published by MDPI are peer reviewed and assessed by our independent editorial boards, and MDPI staff are not involved in decisions to accept manuscripts. When making an editorial decision, we expect the academic editor to make their decision based only upon:\n\nThe suitability of selected reviewers;\n\nAdequacy of reviewer comments and author response;\n\nOverall scientific quality of the paper.\n\nIn all of our journals, in every aspect of operation, MDPI policies are informed by the mission to make science and research findings open and accessible as widely and rapidly as possible.\n\nEditors and Editorial Staff as Authors\n\nEditorial staff or editors shall not be involved in processing their own academic work. Submissions authored by editorial staff/editors will be assigned to at least two independent outside reviewers. Decisions will be made by other Editorial Board Members who do not have a conflict of interest with the author. Journal staff are not involved in the processing of their own work submitted to any MDPI journals.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nAccording to The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, “Authors should avoid entering into agreements with study sponsors, both for-profit and non-profit, that interfere with authors’ access to all of the study’s data or that interfere with their ability to analyze and interpret the data and to prepare and publish manuscripts independently when and where they choose.”\n\nAll authors must disclose all relationships or interests that could inappropriately influence or bias their work. Examples of potential conflicts of interest include but are not limited to financial interests (such as membership, employment, consultancies, stocks/shares ownership, honoraria, grants or other funding, paid expert testimonies and patent-licensing arrangements) and non-financial interests (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, personal beliefs).\n\nAuthors can disclose potential conflicts of interest via the online submission system during the submission process. Declarations regarding conflicts of interest can also be collected via the MDPI disclosure form. The corresponding author must include a summary statement in the manuscript in a separate section “Conflicts of Interest” placed just before the reference list. The statement should reflect all the collected potential conflicts of interest disclosures in the form.\n\nSee below for examples of disclosures:\n\nConflicts of Interest: Author A has received research grants from Company A. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from Company X and owns stocks in Company Y. Author C has been involved as a consultant and expert witness in Company Z. Author D is the inventor of patent X.\n\nIf no conflicts exist, the authors should state:\n\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nEditorial Procedures and Peer Review\n\nPre-check\n\nImmediately after submission, the journal’s Managing Editor will perform the technical pre-check to assess:\n\nOverall suitability of the manuscript to the journal/section/Special Issue;\n\nManuscript adherence to high-quality research and ethical standards;\n\nStandards of rigor to qualify for further review.\n\nThe academic editor (i.e., the Editor-in-Chief in the case of regular submissions, the Guest Editor in the case of Special Issue submissions, or an Editorial Board member in the case of a conflict of interest and of regular submissions if the Editor-in-Chief allows) will be notified of the submission and invited to perform an editorial pre-check. During the editorial pre-check phase, the academic editor will assess the suitability of the submission with respect to the scope of the journal, as well as the overall scientific soundness of the manuscript, including the relevance of the references and the correctness of the applied methodology. Academic editors can decide to reject the manuscript, request revisions before peer review, or continue with the peer review process and recommend suitable reviewers.\n\nPeer Review\n\nOnce a manuscript passes the initial checks, it will be assigned to at least two independent experts for peer review. A single-blind review is applied, where authors' identities are known to reviewers. Peer review comments are confidential and will only be disclosed with the express agreement of the reviewer.\n\nIn the case of regular submissions, in-house assistant editors will invite experts, including recommendations by an academic editor. These experts may also include Editorial Board Members and Guest Editors of the journal. Potential reviewers suggested by the authors may also be considered. Reviewers should not have published with any of the co-authors during the past three years and should not currently work or collaborate with any of the institutions of the co-authors of the submitted manuscript. For more details about potential conflicts of interest, please check here, https://www.mdpi.com/reviewers#_bookmark9.\n\nOptional Open Peer Review\n\nThe journal operates optional open peer review: Authors are given the option for all review reports and editorial decisions to be published alongside their manuscript. In addition, reviewers can sign their review, i.e., identify themselves in the published review reports. Authors can alter their choice for open peer review at any time before publication, but once the paper has been published changes will only be made at the discretion of the Publisher and Editor-in-Chief. We encourage authors to take advantage of this opportunity as proof of the rigorous process employed in publishing their research. To guarantee impartial refereeing, the names of referees will be revealed only if the referees agree to do so, and after a paper has been accepted for publication.\n\nEditorial Decision and Revision\n\nAll the articles, reviews and communications published in MDPI journals go through the peer review process and receive at least two reviews. The in-house editor will communicate the decision of the academic editor, which will be one of the following:\n\nAccept after Minor Revisions:\n\nThe paper is in principle accepted after revision based on the reviewer’s comments. Authors are given five days for minor revisions.\n\nReconsider after Major Revisions:\n\nThe acceptance of the manuscript would depend on the revisions. The author needs to provide a point by point response or provide a rebuttal if some of the reviewer’s comments cannot be revised. A maximum of two rounds of major revision per manuscript is normally provided. Authors will be asked to resubmit the revised paper within a suitable time frame, and the revised version will be returned to the reviewer for further comments. If the required revision time is estimated to be longer than 2 months, we will recommend that authors withdraw their manuscript before resubmitting so as to avoid unnecessary time pressure and to ensure that all manuscripts are sufficiently revised.\n\nReject and Encourage Resubmission:\n\nIf additional experiments are needed to support the conclusions, the manuscript will be rejected and the authors will be encouraged to re-submit the paper once further experiments have been conducted.\n\nReject:\n\nThe article has serious flaws, and/or makes no original significant contribution. No offer of resubmission to the journal is provided.\n\nAll reviewer comments should be responded to in a point-by-point fashion. Where the authors disagree with a reviewer, they must provide a clear response.\n\nAuthor Appeals\n\nAuthors may appeal a rejection by sending an e-mail to the Editorial Office of the journal. The appeal must provide a detailed justification, including point-by-point responses to the reviewers' and/or Editor's comments using an appeal form. Appeals can only be submitted following a “reject and decline resubmission” decision and should be submitted within three months from the decision date. Failure to meet these criteria will result in the appeal not being considered further. The Managing Editor will forward the manuscript and related information (including the identities of the referees) to a designated Editorial Board Member. The Academic Editor being consulted will be asked to provide an advisory recommendation on the manuscript and may recommend acceptance, further peer review, or uphold the original rejection decision. This decision will then be validated by the Editor-in-Chief. A reject decision at this stage is final and cannot be reversed.\n\nProduction and Publication\n\nOnce accepted, the manuscript will undergo professional copy-editing, English editing, proofreading by the authors, final corrections, pagination, and, publication on the www.mdpi.com website.\n\nPlease read detailed Editorial Process here.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nTransfer Service\n\nA manuscript transfer provides you with a convenient method of resubmitting your manuscript file and any reviewer comments to another journal within our publishing portfolio.\n\nWe are committed to helping authors find the right home for their research, and we will provide authors with guidance and technical support through all stages of the transfer process. Authors will be able to choose to transfer in the following two situations:\n\n1. Select alternative journals on submission.\n\nWe now ask all authors to select up to three alternate journals during the submission process. The suggested alternative journals will be ordered according to the authors’ preference. If a paper is evaluated as out of scope by the first-choice journal, it will be transferred to the first alternative journal automatically. If the first alternative journal also rejects the paper because it is out of scope, it will be transferred to the second alternative journal automatically, and so on.\n\nThe information below applies for the transfer of manuscripts when your paper is rejected and automatically transferred to your selected alternative journal.\n\nNote: If you did not select an alternative journal during submission, the below does not apply.\n\nHow do I select an alternative journal?\n\nAuthors can use our Journal Finder tool to identify suitable journals in our portfolio. We suggest you select alternative journals based on the scope and subject area of your manuscript.\n\nAll of our journals are listed here, and you can find out more about each journal by clicking through to the journal homepage.\n\nDo I have to pay to transfer my manuscript?\n\nNo, there is no direct fee for transferring your manuscript.\n\nOpen access publication fees\n\nIf you transfer your manuscript to another open access (OA) journal you will be charged an Article Processing Charge (APC) if your article is accepted for publication. The APC for each journal can be found on the individual journal’s website. For more information about APCs, please see here.\n\n2. Authors are encouraged to transfer manuscripts to other MDPI journals.\n\nIf the submitted journal cannot process this manuscript, but other MDPI journals can process it or the academic editor encourages authors to transfer the manuscript to other MDPI journals after revisions, authors will receive an email including the recommended journals. Authors can click on the link in the email to transfer or resubmit according to their own wishes.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nPromoting Equity, Diversity and Inclusiveness within MDPI Journals\n\nOur Managing Editors encourage the Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors to appoint diverse expert Editorial Boards. This is also reflective in our multi-national and inclusive workplace. We are proud to create equal opportunities without regard to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, religion, or socio-economic status. There is no place for discrimination in our workplace and editors of MDPI journals are to uphold these principles in high regard.\n\n[Return to top]\n\nResource Identification Initiative\n\nTo improve the reproducibility of scientific research, the Resource Identification Initiative aims to provide unique persistent identifiers for key biological resources, including antibodies, cell lines, model organisms and tools.\n\nWe encourage authors to include unique identifiers - RRIDs- provided by the Resource Identification Portal in the dedicated section of the manuscript.\n\nTo help authors quickly find the correct identifiers for their materials, there is a single website where all resource types can be found and a ‘cite this’ button next to each resource, that contains a proper citation text that should be included in the methods section of the manuscript."
