        "text": "From 1974 to the present day the NHS has been in an almost continuous state of what some call redisorganisation. The Labour Government realised in about 2006 that structural reorganisation was largely futile but the Coalition government – though claiming to oppose Top-down Reorganisation in the Coalition Agreement -seem determined to make their own mistakes . This Reform of the National Health Service Chronology is a work in progress!\n\nReorganisations generally claim as their objectives:\n\ndesign around the patient\n\ndevolved responsibility\n\nclinical leadership\n\nbetter integrated care\n\nbetter quality of care\n\nless bureaucracy/management/costs\n\nSadly there is little evidence that structural change has produced any of these benefits, although few changes were left in place long enough for anyone to be able to tell what effect they had. As Charles Webster pointed out as long ago as 1998 the pace of change got faster and faster. Alan Maynard, Sir Iain Chalmers and others produced A surrealistic mega-analysis of redisorganization theories. There is lots of evidence that restructuring has quite prolonged negative effects, most of which are underestimated because they are difficult to measure. See the academic analysis of History and public-management reform by Tony Cutler, Triumph of Hope over Experience by Nigel Edwards, the Health Reform Evaluation Programme, A Short and Partial History of Reform of the NHS in England, Ten years of health reform: from market, to plan, to market again? Kieran Walshe 2007 and The Department of Health and the Civil Service: from Whitehall to Department of Delivery to where? Scott Greer and Holly Jarman.\n\nThe urge to reform is concentrated in England. The rest of the UK has been relatively stable since devolution: see divergent health policies inside the UK and Inspiration, Ideology, Evidence and the National Health Service David Hands 2010\n\nThe chronological table below is confined to reforms which actually happened and the documents which they relate to directly. It only attempts to include matters relating to health care. If you want more on public health see A Chronology of State Medicine, Public Health, Welfare and Related Services in Britain: 1066 – 1999. Reports calling for, analysing, or opposing, change may be found on our history page. Dates of events are approximate – change takes time and it is often difficult to decide which date is most appropriate, especially as it is sometimes unclear when a change which was announced actually came into effect. This table does not include anything said to be in the nature of a pilot project or an experiment.\n\nReform of the National Health Service Chronology\n\nThe Nuffield Trust have produced a very nice illustrated interactive timeline and Geoffrey Rivett a more comprehensive National Health Service History. Charles Webster did an excellent lecture on NHS reorganisation in 1998.\n\nYear\n\nEvents\n\nLegislation and documentation\n\n2017 2016 2015 Devolution of the NHS in Greater Manchester.

Community services split off from PCTs 2010 Coalition government promises they will stop the top-down reorganisations of the NHS that have got in the way of patient care. They then proceed to plan a reorganisation “so large it can been seen from Outer Space”. Equity and excellence: liberating the NHS 2009 NHS complaints system reformed again. Healthcare Commission replaced by Care Quality Commission. PCTs separate themselves into commissioning and providing arms. NHS Constitution 2008 Alan Johnson commits himself to avoiding structural reorganisation – but turns his attention to Primary Care, which escaped most of the previous reorganisations.
