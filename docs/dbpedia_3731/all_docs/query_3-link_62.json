        "text": "Family Medicine, an official journal of the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, aims to publish high-quality, original scholarship about education in family medicine and primary care. The journal publishes original research, systematic reviews, narrative essays, and policy analyses relevant to the discipline of family medicine, particularly focusing on primary care medical education, health workforce policy, and health services research. The journal does not publish clinical review articles.\n\nFamily Medicine is committed to advancing efforts toward inclusion and antiracism in all journal-related activities. We endeavor to eliminate bias and racism in our editorial process and published content.\n\nRead the full diversity statement.\n\nSubmit Issue Cover Art for Family Medicine\n\nInterested in submitting a photograph, painting, or artwork for consideration for a future Family Medicine issue cover? Send the high-quality digital image to tbrazelton@stfm.org.\n\nE-ISSN: 1938-3800\n\nCall For Papers—\n\nRecruit, Mentor, and Promote a Diverse Family Medicine Workforce.\n\nSubmission deadline: August 15\n\nFamily Medicine seeks submissions for a theme issue on recruiting, mentoring, and promoting a diverse family medicine workforce. Family medicine is one of the most gender and racially diverse specialties, yet the discipline lags behind the general population in diversity, particularly in academic settings. Yet a diverse workforce is paramount to the health of patients and communities and success within organizations. Therefore our goal is to collect high-quality articles on pathway programs, recruitment initiatives, and meaningful retention and promotion strategies aimed to diversify the family medicine workforce. Original research and brief reports are welcome. FM Focus submissions must have high yield, concise information that will be published as an infographic. Narrative essay submissions should share original stories from the perspective of students, residents, faculty members, or practicing physicians.\n\nCall For Papers—\n\nGlobal Family Medicine Education Theme Issue Call for Papers\n\nSubmission deadline: November 15\n\nFamily Medicine seeks submissions for its upcoming theme issue on models of family medicine education around the world.\n\nRegardless of location, global family medicine educational programs face many similar challenges. Whether based in settings where family medicine is a novel specialty, or in areas where family medicine is long-established, faculty and academic units often struggle to advocate for appropriate resources and political support to remain viable and community responsive. Additionally, there are many challenges (ex: climate change and planetary health, burnout, and retention) for which we face a common need to innovate in order to ensure adequate family medicine education regardless of our country or region.\n\nFor this theme issue, Family Medicine welcomes submissions that focus on successful efforts to advocate for family medicine education and training within local and global health systems; impact assessment of family medicine on populations served; barriers to family medicine training and evidence-based solutions to navigating those barriers; and creative partnership approaches to strengthen training between education programs located across international borders.\n\nOriginal research and brief reports are welcome. Narrative essay submissions should share original stories from the perspective of students, residents, faculty members, or practicing physicians. FM Focus submissions must have high yield, concise information that will be published as an infographic. Word limits and structure for the above manuscripts should follow those detailed in our author instructions.\n\nWe specifically encourage submission by family medicine educators based outside of the United States."
