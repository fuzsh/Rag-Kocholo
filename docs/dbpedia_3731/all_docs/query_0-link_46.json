It has been published independently since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Known variously as Batratskaia Pravda (Батрацкая правда, Batratskaya Truth, March-June 1925), Krest’ianskii put’ (Крестьянский путь, Peasant Path, 1925-1927), and Sovetskaia Kirgiziia (Советская Киргизия, Soviet Kyrgyzstan, 1927-1991), at its peak the newspaper claimed a circulation of 123,000 copies and was the most important media organization disseminating the Communist party’s official stances and directives.

From the beginning, he stamped the highest office with his wildly individualistic character, feuding bitterly not only with enemies but his own cabinet, calling for sweeping reforms in government, and committing to a strong union while at the same time effectively terminating the Bank of the United States. This fully annotated and searchable XML-based archive collects Jackson’s papers in one powerful online resource and is interoperable with Rotunda editions covering the most important personages of the nation’s early history. - Publisher\n\nAndrew Johnson's career is notable for more than his impeachment, with much to tell us about Civil War-era politics and the complexity of Reconstruction, through a trajectory that is one of the most compelling, and strange, in presidential history. This digital edition of Johnson’s papers collects the complete contents of the print edition’s sixteen volumes, is fully searchable, and is interoperable with other titles in the Antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction collection. – Publisher\n\nDigital edition of Grant's papers, based on the original letterpress edition edited by John Y. Simon.

Marszalek. These materials contain thousands of letters written by Ulysses S. Grant (1837-1885), and to him; his military and presidential documents; and a small number of photographs."
