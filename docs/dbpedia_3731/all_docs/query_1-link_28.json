Submassive (intermediate-risk) PE accounts for 40% of this burden. However, the optimal treatment pathway for this population remains complex and ill-defined. Catheter-directed interventions (CDIs) have shown promise in directly impacting morbidity and mortality while demonstrating a favorable success rate, safety profile, and decreased length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit and hospital. This retrospective review included 22 patients (50% female) with submassive PE who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT). A total of 45% had a contraindication to thrombolytics, the mean pulmonary embolism severity index was 127, 36% had saddle PE, the average decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was 7.2 mmHg following MT, the average LOS was 6.9 days, the 30-day mortality rate was 9%, the major adverse event (MAE) rate was 9%, and the readmission rate was 13.6%. A total of 82% had successful removal of thrombus during MT with no major bleeding complications, intracranial hemorrhage events, or device-related deaths. Acknowledging the limitation of our small sample size, our data indicate that MT in the intermediate-high-risk submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) cohort resulted in a decreased hospital length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality compared to standard anticoagulation therapy alone.

Objective: To determine the resistance profile of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) strains isolated in sepsis cases diagnosed at the Infectious Diseases Clinic in Craiova, Romania. Methods: The bacteria responsible for sepsis cases were identified using the Vitek 2 Systems version 06.01, which was then employed to assess their antimicrobial susceptibility (Global CLSI and Phenotypic 2017). Results: We have identified 989 patients diagnosed with bacterial sepsis. Among these, 953 cases were caused by Gram-negative rods, with 415 attributed to E. coli and 278 to K. pneumoniae. High levels of resistance to ampicillin were recorded for E. coli strains isolated in sepsis cases (64.6%); adding sulbactam lowers the level of resistance to 41.8%. Resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins varied between 7.47 and 14.6% and another 3.41 to 11.1% are dose-dependent susceptibility strains. Resistance to carbapenems (i.e., ertapenem, meropenem) is low—2.18–2.42%. More than 95% of the tested K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to ampicillin and adding sulbactam as a β-lactamase inhibitor only halves that level. Resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins varied between 20.7% and 22.5%; resistance levels for K. pneumoniae were notably higher than those for E. coli. Over 95% of K. pneumoniae strains showed resistance to ampicillin, and resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins varied between 20.7% and 22.5%. Additionally, K. pneumoniae exhibited higher resistance to carbapenems (13.7–19.5%) compared to E. coli (2.18–2.42%). Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance levels are generally lower than continental and national data, except for ampicillin and carbapenems (meropenem and ertapenem). K. pneumoniae strains are significantly more resistant than E. coli strains.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI) according to weight status and to evaluate the associations between CI, weight status and comorbid conditions in adults of 55 years and older. The Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) was used. Logistic regressions were performed. Overall, 415 individuals were included. The mean age was 75.7 ± 10.1 years, and the mean BMI was 26.2 ± 6.9 kg/m2. The prevalence of CI was 20.7% in the whole study group and 31%, 24.8%, 17.7% and 10.2% in underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese individuals, respectively; p < 0.004. The low folate, vitamin D and prealbumin levels were more frequently found in individuals with CI compared with those without CI. Compared with the obese individuals, a higher odds ratio of prevalent CI was noted for underweight individuals OR 3.89 (95% CI 1.54–9.80); p = 0.004. Additionally, male gender, older age, stroke, having three or more comorbid conditions and findings of undernutrition were significantly associated with CI. Being underweight was associated with an increased risk of CI. Prevention strategies including the monitoring of nutritional status may help to prevent cognitive decline and promote healthy aging.

Purpose: To identify which attributes patients openly evoke as being great care experiences, using an open appreciative inquiry during the inpatient rehabilitation stay. Methods: Qualitative secondary analysis of appreciative patient comments during a bedside patient experience rounding facilitated by a neutral party was performed. Two independent analysts employed an inductive, summative form of content analysis. Results: Among 150 patients rounded, 122 provided categorizable appreciative accounts. Over two-thirds of the patients (67.2%) focused on “staff attributes” in their great-experience accounts. Those attributes were mostly interpersonal such as being “attentive & caring—beyond clinical duty” and being “encouraging (but not too hard) & reassuring”. These interpersonal staff attributes were reported with words showing deep levels of personal significance or patient appreciation. Beyond staff attributes, the perceived quality of “patient care” (31.1%) and opportunities for “leisure and social activities” (9.0%) were also frequently evoked. Amenities like food or customer service were the least evoked, rarely so as an exclusive attribute (0.8% for each). Conclusions: The human(e) factor, especially the interpersonal qualities of staff, emerged as greatly appreciated from the patient experience perspective during inpatient rehabilitation. These experiences help identify which person-centered attributes of care might be further developed and sustained.

This study aims to explore the long-term impacts of the pandemic on proactive self-management behaviors and outcomes that consider contextual and environmental factors, such as family and work dynamics. (2) Methods: In this mixed-method study, data were collected from 418 participants using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), followed by 16 individual interviews. (3) Results: The prevalence of depression was 37.1%, that of anxiety was 59.1%, and that of insomnia was 66.3%. Significant differences were observed in anxiety by age (p = 0.02), while individuals with other comorbidities were more likely to report insomnia (p = 0.3). Overall, various challenges during the pandemic have exacerbated emotional distress and complicated self-care routines and adherence to healthy lifestyles. (5) Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes to adopt alternative health-management methods, such as self-care, proactive initiatives, and daily challenges. Enhancing proactiveness, awareness, and an understanding of individuals’ needs is crucial for alleviating stress, controlling disease, and preparing for potential future health crises in the wake of the pandemic’s long-term effects.

However, the association of SDM with healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcomes among multimorbid individuals is not well understood. This study sought to evaluate the association of SDM with healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcomes among United States (US) adults with multimorbidity. Data were collected from the 2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for this cross-sectional study. Eligible participants were US adults with two or more comorbidities. The predictor variable was SDM (optimal versus not optimal). The outcome variables were healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcomes. Logistic regression models, adjusted for demographic characteristics, assessed associations with SDM for each healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcome variable. The analysis maintained the complex survey data and was weighted to produce nationally representative estimates. Individuals who reported optimal SDM in adjusted analyses utilized more healthcare resources compared to those who reported not optimal SDM. Individuals with optimal SDM had more than one outpatient visit (odds ratio OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03–1.47), emergency room visit (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.17–2.06), and inpatient discharge (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.05–1.96). Additionally, these individuals had higher odds of reporting limitations in their ability to work or engage in other activities due to their physical health in the past four weeks (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.01–1.60). This study indicated evidence of increased healthcare resource utilization among patients who participate in SDM with their providers, which should be explored in future studies.

The proper care for diabetes depends on how well patients observe guidelines and prescriptions; consequently, patient education is critical. Poor learning may cause bad treatment and complications or other problems related to the disease. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate patients’ knowledge of diabetes, assigning a knowledge (K) score out of 100, and investigate the possible impact of educating patients, through general means or via healthcare professionals, on patient knowledge of diabetes control demonstrated in the absence/presence of diabetic complications. Methods: This multi-center interview-based cross-sectional study used a questionnaire in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. This study was conducted on adults with diabetes who were aged 15–80. We used the Michigan Diabetic Knowledge Test (MDKT) to assess the knowledge of patients with diabetes. Results: This study included 364 participants. The gender distribution was 48.33% male and 51.67% female. Most of them had type 2 diabetes (T2DM) without insulin (48.63%), followed by those with T2DM on insulin (36.26%), and patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) (15.11%). Patients with T2DM had significantly higher K scores than patients with type 1. Additionally, T2DM non-insulin patients’ k-scores significantly exceeded those with T1DM. General and healthcare education both helped increase patients’ K-scores. Mostly, patients with diabetes without any complications had significantly higher knowledge compared to those having them. Lastly, regardless of whether the education was delivered by general or professional means, the effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels was not significant. Conclusions: Our study revealed that patients with T2DM exhibited higher knowledge than patients with T1DM. Furthermore, receiving education, whether by a healthcare professional or by general means, improved the knowledge levels of patients with T2DM but not patients with T1DM. Regarding diabetes complications, it was found that those with a higher level of knowledge had fewer complications. However, no evidence receiving education influenced the levels of HbA1C, neither in patients with T1DM nor T2DM.

MBS has been effectively applied across diverse patient demographics, including varying ages, genders, body mass indexes, and comorbidity statuses. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature review of published retrospective cohort studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and literature reviews from inception to 2024, reporting outcomes of MBS using databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Springer Link. Results: MBS is a safe and efficient therapeutic option for patients with obesity and associated medical conditions (mortality rate 0.03–0.2%; complication rates 0.4–1%). The favorable safety profile of MBS in the short-, mid-, and long-term offers the potential to treat patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, chronic anticoagulation, neoplastic disease, and end-organ failure without increased morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: In conclusion, the future of MBS lies in the ongoing innovation and adapted therapeutic strategies along with the integration of a variety of other techniques for managing obesity. Careful preoperative assessments, coupled with a multidisciplinary approach, remain essential to ensure optimal surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction after MBS.

However, more research on this issue must be carried out in the country. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of WPB and how individual factors among nurses contribute to different experiences of WPB in clinical settings. Methods: This cross-sectional quantitative study occurred among registered nurses in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was used, and nurses filled it out via a Google survey that included sociodemographic details such as age, gender, education, and the WBS to gauge the prevalence of workplace bullying in hospital settings. Results: Of 416 nurses, 58.7% were aged between 31 and 40, and 76.9% were women. The prevalence of WPB was found to be 54.8%. WPB was higher among middle-aged nurses, men, charge/managerial nurses, nurses with higher education, those with 3 to 6 years of experience, and those working in specialty units. Conclusions: More than half of the nurses had experienced WPB at some point. Middle-aged nurses, especially men with higher education and more experience in specialty units, were the most common victims of WPB compared to other registered nurses.

Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being used as a cognitive intervention tool, with significant effectiveness demonstrated in different types of populations. Methods: This pilot study aims to investigate the impact of a cognitive training program utilizing VR on young adults diagnosed with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDDs). The participants (N = 15) served as their own control group and were assessed three times: weeks 0, 8, and 16, with a rest period (0–8 weeks) and an intervention period (8–16 weeks). The assessments included measures of cognitive function provided by E-Prime® (Version 3). Results: Overall, an improvement in working memory and inhibitory control was found after the intervention, but not in sustained attention. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training holds promise as an effective intervention for enhancing cognitive abilities in young adults with intellectual developmental disabilities. This study provides a foundation for future investigations into VR’s role in cognitive rehabilitation and its potential to support daily living skills and overall quality of life for individuals with IDDs. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects and broader applicability of VR interventions.

The aim of this study is to investigate reasons for non-participation and perceptions of CCS using self-sampling methods among under-screened women in Flanders. Individual interviews with 15 underscreened women aged 30–64 years were conducted. During the interviews, participants were given the opportunity to try out a urine and vaginal self-sampling kit. Thematic analysis was based on Ajzen’s model of the Theory of Planned Behavior. The results showed that 14 out of 15 participants were more likely to participate in CCS if they had the option to self-sample. One of the main findings was a lack of knowledge on different aspects of cervical cancer. Most women had a positive attitude toward cancer screening and primary prevention such as HPV vaccination. Subjective norms were influenced by healthcare professionals, peers, and organized government initiatives. Informational, organizational, contextual, and emotional factors were mentioned as barriers as well as facilitators for participation. Additionally, high self-efficacy was considered to make self-sampling more convenient. All women showed the intention to use at least one method of self-sampling. We can conclude that women who do not participate in CCS would be more motivated to participate using self-sampling methods. Adequate education and guidance should be provided.

In children, the application of robotic surgery is limited, meaning safety and efficacy is still to be assessed. This report is the first one worldwide that describes inguinal hernia repair in children using the Senhance® Surgical System (SSS®). The aim of this matched cohort study is to assess safety and feasibility of robot-assisted IHR (RIHR) in children, compared to conventional laparoscopic IHR (LIHR). Patients and methods: This pilot study included 26 consecutive patients between 3 months and 8 years old who underwent RIHR (31 IH’s) with the SSS® between 2020 and 2024. These cases were matched based on gender, age, and unilateral or bilateral IH, with 26 patients (32 IH’s) who underwent conventional LIHR. Results: There was a significant difference in total anesthesia time, which is most likely due to the extra time needed to dock the robot in the RIHR cases. No significant difference was seen in surgical time. One recurrence (3.2%) was diagnosed in both groups. One patient in the LIHR group was readmitted on the day of discharge due to a hemorrhage. No intervention was necessary, and the patient was discharged 1 day later. Discussion: In this pilot study, the use of the robotic system was safe and feasible. More experience, further improvement of the system for use in very small children, and investigation in a larger sample size with long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate efficacy.

(2) Methods: Demographic data were collected by 56 subjects who were asked to fill out the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Expectations for Treatment Scale (ETS). All patients received one single cervical manipulation, and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured before and immediately after the manipulation with a digital algometer. (3) Results: A total of 56 patients participated. Most subjects (62.5%) had high treatment expectations according to the ETS scale. Statistically significant increases in PPTs were noted both locally and in remote areas (p < 0.05), with 37.5–48.2% of participants showing clinically significant changes in pain perception. However, no statistically significant correlation was found between high treatment expectations and increased PPTs (p > 0.05). (4) Conclusions: Although a significant reduction in pain perception was observed, it did not correlate with patients’ treatment expectations. Future research for further investigation of this hypothesis by comparing real versus sham treatment and exploring additional mechanisms affecting changes in PPTs after cervical manipulations in this population will contribute to a better understanding of the research question.

Autonomic nervous system (ANS) alterations can occur at phases of migraine attack. This study investigates patterns of ANS changes during the pre-ictal night of migraine, utilizing wearable biosensor technology in ten individuals. Various physiological, activity-based, and signal processing metrics were examined to train predictive models and understand the relationship between specific features and migraine occurrences. Data were filtered based on specified criteria for nocturnal sleep, and analysis frames ranging from 5 to 120 min were used to improve the diversity of the training sample and investigate the impact of analysis frame duration on feature significance and migraine prediction. Several models, including XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), HistGradientBoosting (Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting), Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, were trained on unbalanced data and using cost-sensitive learning with a 5:1 ratio. To evaluate the changes in features during pre-migraine nights and nights before migraine-free days, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The results showed that the features of electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and accelerometer exhibited the highest F-statistic values and the most significant p-values in the 5 and 10 min frames, which makes them particularly useful for the early detection of migraines. The generalized prediction model using XGBoost and a 5 min analysis frame achieved 0.806 for accuracy, 0.638 for precision, 0.595 for recall, and 0.607 for F1-score. Despite identifying distinguishing features between pre-migraine and migraine-free nights, the performance of the current model suggests the need for further improvements for clinical application.

The World Health Organization calls for integrating obesity care into existing chronic disease management programs within primary healthcare services. This scoping review aimed to examine registered nurses’ roles in the primary healthcare management of individuals with obesity. A scoping review was conducted using the Johanna Briggs Institute methodology framework. Thematic analysis was used to identify and categorize nurses’ roles in primary healthcare obesity management of adults. Of 1142 documents included in this review, 15 papers met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis yielded the following six themes representing nurses’ major roles: patient-centred care, patient assessments, therapeutic interventions, care management, patient education, and professional development. This review identified that the literature on nurses’ roles primarily described their focus on lifestyle interventions (mainly nutrition and physical activity), anthropometric measurements, health planning, goal setting, supportive care, monitoring progress, and arranging follow-up. The Discussion highlights the importance of determining RN knowledge gaps and biases. More research is required to determine the need for additional RN pre-and or post-education related to obesity as a complex chronic disease.

One of these modern approaches is machine learning (ML), an advanced form of statistics broadly defined as the application of complex algorithms. ML provides innovative methods for detecting patterns in complex datasets. This enables the identification of correlations or the prediction of specific events. These capabilities are especially valuable for multifactorial phenomena, such as those found in mental health and forensic psychiatry. ML also allows for the quantification of the quality of the emerging statistical model. The present study aims to examine various sociodemographic variables in order to detect differences in a sample of 370 offender patients and 370 non-offender patients, all with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, through discriminative model building using ML. In total, 48 variables were tested. Out of seven algorithms, gradient boosting emerged as the most suitable for the dataset. The discriminative model finally included three variables (regarding country of birth, residence status, and educational status) and yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.65, meaning that the statistical discrimination of offender and non-offender patients based purely on the sociodemographic variables is rather poor.

TikTok was searched using the hashtags “#carpaltunnelexercises”, “#carpaltunnelremedies”, “#carpaltunnelrehab”, and “#physicaltherapyforcarpaltunnel”. The engagement indicators were documented and the video content quality was assessed using the DISCERN, CTEES, JAMA, and GQS grading scales. There were 101 videos included, which accumulated 20,985,730 views. The videos received 1,460,953 likes, 15,723 comments, 243,245 favorites, and 159,923 shares. Healthcare professionals were responsible for 72% of the video uploads, whereas general users contributed 28%. More healthcare professionals’ videos were graded as “poor” (79%) compared to general users (21%). General users received slightly more video grades of “very poor” (52%) than healthcare professionals (48%). For the DISCERN grading, the videos by healthcare professionals were significantly better than those by general users in terms of reliability, achieving aims, and relevancy. They were also superior in the overall composition of the health information derived from the total DISCERN score. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups when using the CTEES, JAMA, and GQS grading scales. Overall, despite the emergence of TikTok as a medical information tool, the quality and educational value of the carpal tunnel syndrome exercise videos were poor. Full article\n\n►▼ Show Figures"
