Additionally, authors should develop an implications section that highlights the broader or overarching effects of their findings on behavioral health care, including within the U.S.\n\nPublished quarterly, each peer-reviewed issue includes an overview of contemporary concerns and recent developments in behavioral health policy and management; specifically, research articles, policy perspectives, commentaries, brief reports and book reviews.\n\nThis Journal is the official publication of the National Council for Mental Wellbeing."
