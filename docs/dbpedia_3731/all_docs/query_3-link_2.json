Around 40 per cent of subscribers access HSJ on a mobile device.\n\nWe have invested in our expert team. Only a small proportion of our award winning news and analysis is ever published in the fortnightly magazine.\n\nI am unhappy about the price increase\n\nThe price is changing for several reasons:\n\nThe government requires us to charge VAT. VAT makes up themajority of the price increase. This money goes to the UK Treasury, not HSJ.\n\nWe haven’t raised prices for some time and need to cover some of the rising costs.\n\nWe now produce much more content than we did since the last cost increase – significantly increasing the value of the service.\n\nWe have invested in our expert team.\n\nPlease could you explain the VAT in detail\n\nIn the UK, VAT is not charged on news/data if it is delivered in a print format; but it is charged at 20 per cent when the same information is delivered digitally. This is a peculiarity of UK VAT law. HSJ does not profit from this. If you claim the cost of your HSJ subscription on business expenses then your employer will be able to claim the VAT back.\n\nIf you would like a receipt to claim your subscription back through business expenses, then please call 020 8955 7055. Lines are open Monday to Friday (8am-9.30pm) and Saturday (8am-4pm).\n\nAlternatively, email customerservices@hsj.co.uk\n\nI am unhappy that you are removing my magazine\n\nThe majority of our customers tell us that they no longer need a print magazine, and would prefer we invest the cost of print and delivery of a magazine into the digital products and services we provide. We have launched a number of new services to support this:\n\nOur Expert Briefing newsletters, covering nine topics and regions, deliver analysis and insight to your inbox, every week.\n\nBe confident that you are up to date every week with HSJ Catch Up, a summary of the most significant events and why they matter.\n\nNever miss a big story with breaking news alerts.\n\nAccess content at your convenience, anytime, anywhere on any device with the improved hsj.co.uk.\n\nStay ahead in your sector via in-depth coverage from our expanded team of HSJ experts.\n\nBe informed wherever you are with the HSJ app.\n\nMuch of our most valuable content has never appeared in print - such as our interactive map of the 44 STP plans.\n\nHow do I sign up for Expert Briefings?\n\nVisit www.hsj.co.uk/my-account/newsletters and sign in with your username and password\n\nSelect the expert briefings you wish to receive\n\nScroll down the page and click on submit\n\nExpert BriefingsFrequencyWhy you should read it\n\nI like to read a magazine in a condensed summary\n\nWe understand that you have less time during the day to keep up to date on the key issues taking place in the NHS landscape. We have listened to your feedback and have developed HSJ Catch Up, a weekly briefing, designed to help you keep up with the most significant stories affecting healthcare policy and practice that you might have missed.\n\nHSJ Catch Up is sent every Friday and will brief you on the biggest stories of the week, so you are never in the dark.\n\nVisit www.hsj.co.uk/newsletters and sign in with your username and password\n\nSelect HSJ Catch Up\n\nScroll down the page and click on submit\n\nI’ve heard/know about this but I still like the magazine. I want to cancel my subscription now\n\nWe really value our subscribers and we do not want to lose any customers. Please call 020 8955 7055 to discuss your subscription.\n\nWill I receive confirmation that my existing subscription has been cancelled?\n\nYes you will receive a confirmation within 24 hours of your subscription being cancelled as well as confirmation of the new digital package.\n\nAccessing hsj.co.uk\n\nHow do I access content online?\n\nIn order to access all the subscriber-only content online, simply log in with your existing username and password. If you’re a new customer, you can subscribe here– you will then have full access to the website and app. If you encounter any problems, please email customerservices@hsj.co.uk or call 020 8955 7055.\n\nI am having problems accessing subscriber-only content online.\n\nIf you are unable to access subscriber-only content, we suggest you try the following:\n\nFirst, check that you are the named subscriber. If you are not and wish for the login details to be changed to your email address, please arrange for the named subscriber to contact us directly with their subscription number. Please email customerservices@hsj.co.uk or call 020 8955 7055.\n\nRefresh your account by logging in and out again. This should ensure that your subscription details are up to date.\n\nCheck if your subscription has lapsed.

How do I find it?\n\nWhen signing in, you will find a ‘forgotten password’ link under the password box. Click on this and fill in the email address you used when registering on the site. We will then email your password to you within a few minutes. If you are still having problems, or you do not receive an email, please emailcustomerservices@hsj.co.uk or call 020 8955 7055.\n\nWhy do I see an error page when I log in to hsj.co.uk?\n\nYour browser might be out of date – hsj.co.uk cannot be viewed on older versions of some browsers. The latest versions of most browsers are available here https://updatemybrowser.org/\n\nWhy do I have to type in my login details every time I use HSJ on my mobile?\n\nYou may need to update your phone’s software. Our Android services are optimised for devices running 4.0.3 or later and iOS services are optimized for 7.0 or later. hsj.co.uk is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n\nIf your phone says an update is available, tap Install Now. You might also need to enable cookies on your phone’s browser.\n\nWhy do I have to enter my login details every time I want to use HSJ on a laptop or desktop\n\nFor hsj.co.uk to remember you, you need to ensure you have cookies enabled on your browser.\n\nCan I change the email address and the password I use to access online content?\n\nYes. Please log in with your current details, and change your email address within account settings.

For subscription options please click here.\n\nWhy do I need cookies enabled?\n\nWe use cookies to help the website remember who you are and to give you access to all the features on our site.

All you need to do is click on ‘accept’.\n\nTaking out a subscription\n\nI would like to take out a subscription. Where can I find out more information?\n\nTo find out more about our subscription options, please click here.\n\nIf you need any assistance or any more information, please email customerservices@hsj.co.uk or call 020 8955 7055.\n\nAre my credit card details secure if I subscribe online?\n\nYes. All the information you provide is encrypted using the industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology.\n\nWhat’s the benefit of paying by direct debit?\n\nDirect debit is a continuous payment method available in the UK that means that you do not need to remember to renew your subscription each year. You will be in complete control of your subscription and can often spread the cost over the year.\n\nMy company needs an invoice to pay for the subscription. How can I get one?\n\nWe can arrange to send you an invoice. Please contact our subscriptions hotline.\n\nCan I pay in a currency other than pound sterling?\n\nWe accept cheque payments in most currencies. If you are paying by credit card, your payment will be processed in sterling at a recent rate of exchange, which may therefore be different to the sterling published price.\n\nCan I order more than one subscription?\n\nYes you can buy up to nine subscriptions here.\n\nIf you wish to buy a corporate subscription for a larger group please contact the corporate subscriptions team for details: hsj.membership@wilmingtonhealthcare.com\n\nWhat do you do with my personal information?\n\nPlease see our privacy policy for more for information.\n\nHow can I access the HSJ tablet app?\n\nTo access the tablet app you need to subscribe to to HSJ.

You can also renew online by logging in to your My Account page. If you wish to renew at any other time, please call us on 020 8955 7055.\n\nCan I cancel my subscription?\n\nWe hope you are delighted with your subscription. However, if you are dissatisfied in any way within the first 30 days of your subscription, please contact our subscriptions hotline and we will refund the cost of the remaining months left on your online subscription.\n\nI signed up to receive your free e-newsletters but I am not receiving them.\n\nPlease check you have provided us with your correct email address.
