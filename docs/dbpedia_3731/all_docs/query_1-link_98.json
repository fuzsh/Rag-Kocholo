Now many GP practices have embraced them, finding them invaluable in helping patients with non-medical needs, and the profession’s role has been recognised in the NHS long-term workforce plan”.\n\nMs Melam founded and leads the professional membership organisation for link workers, with the aim of supporting continued professional development. She has established an annual social prescribing link worker day, designed to celebrate and showcase the value of such staff.\n\nYou can see the full article if you have a free HSJ subscription here.\n\nReacting to the award, Chief Executive of National Association of Link Workers (NALW) Christiana Melam said:\n\n“I am deeply honoured and grateful to be recognised by the Health Service Journal (HSJ) for the third consecutive year. This recognition underscores the indispensable role of social prescribing link workers within the healthcare system. I am proud to have played a part in advancing this profession and will continue to champion its vital role. My heartfelt thanks to the NALW team, our dedicated members, and all our supporters for their contributions to this collective journey.\n\nAbout the Powerlist\n\nThe top 50 Black, Asian and minority ethnic powerlist seeks to measure positive power and influence in the English NHS and health policy in the 12 months following the judging date (so in this case from July 2023 to June 2024)."
