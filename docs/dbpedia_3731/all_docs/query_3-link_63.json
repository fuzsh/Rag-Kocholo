We include articles on all global health topics, including but not limited to family planning, reproductive health, maternal and child health, water and sanitation, nutrition, and communicable and noncommunicable diseases. The journal embraces an interdisciplinary approach and covers a range of cross-cutting issues such as gender, quality improvement, logistics, and supply chain management. Read about specific article types.\n\nGHSP is currently indexed by PubMed, PubMed Central, MEDLINE, Scopus, and EBSCO, USAID’s Development Experience Clearinghouse, Google Scholar, and the Directory of Open Access Journals.\n\nImpact Factor\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice has an Impact Factor of 3.409 (2021 Journal Citation Reports®, Web of Science Group 2022.\n\nNo Author Fees\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice does not charge any fees to authors to submit or publish articles in our journal.\n\nOpen Access Policy\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice applies the Creative Commons Attribution License to all articles that we publish. Under this license, authors retain ownership of copyright for their articles or they can transfer copyright to their institution, but authors allow anyone without permission to copy, distribute, transmit, and/or adapt articles, so long as the original authors and source are cited.\n\nTypes of Articles\n\nWe consider the following article types, but we will consider ideas for other article types as well. Please consult the guidelines provided for each article type and the Style and Formatting Guidelines to prepare your article for submission. The word limits listed below are general guidelines, not including abstract, tables, figures, and references.\n\nReminder: Manuscripts should not be under consideration or published in other journals or scholarly publications, such as textbooks. Prior documentation in project briefs or reports is acceptable, although normally it will be expected that the journal article will be developed beyond the technical report, for example with regard to engaging with the existing published literature, analysis, interpretation or programmatic implications.\n\nViewpoints. Opinion-based essays offering the perspectives of an author(s) on significant public health issues in an insightful way. 1,500–2,500 words.\n\nCommentaries. Analysis pieces that present a new or unique perspective on important public health issues that may also include personal opinion, as well as debate-style articles. Statements and assertions should be supported with evidence. 2,500–3,500 words.\n\nOriginal Articles. Research-based or systematically documented experiential knowledge gained from implementation and management of health programs. 3,500 –5,500 words.\n\nProgram Case Study: Discuss the development or implementation of a program, policy, or intervention that addressed a specific public health issue in a country and its significant or promising impact on health outcomes. May include preliminary qualitative or quantitative data or other findings that are currently available. Include a timeline of important development dates, if applicable. Case studies are not merely descriptive, but also analytical, drawing inferences from the available evidence, generating insight, and communicating key implications for others facing similar challenges. For an example see \"Juntos: a support program for families impacted by congenital Zika syndrome in Brazil.\" 3,500–5,500 words.\n\nField Action Reports. Reporting on experience and observations during program implementation, which could be relevant to others in different countries. For an example, see “Successful use of tablet personal computers and wireless technologies for the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey.” 2,000–3,000 words\n\nReviews. Critical reviews of studies, including meta-analytic, narrative, realist, scoping, qualitative, and umbrella reviews. These may be structured similarly to Original Articles. 3,500–5,500 words.\n\nMethodologies. Although GHSP does not publish articles on the methodology for upcoming research activities, we do publish articles on methodology issues related to systems, policy, and implementation. For example, an article could report innovative approaches to analyzing and evaluating health programs and their effects, such as a new way to conduct a survey. 2,000–4,000 words.\n\nShort Reports. Brief pieces contributing to policy and practice. 3,000 words.\n\nTechnical Notes. Concise articles on current issues related to the scientific/technical aspects of global health research or programming. 1,000–1,500 words.\n\nInnovations. Succinct articles on new techniques, technologies, or scientific advances in the global health field. See: \"Dedicated inserter facilitates immediate postpartum IUD insertion.\" 500–1,000 words.\n\nLetters to the Editor. Discuss articles published recently in GHSP. 500–1,000 words.\n\nBack to Top\n\nStyle and Formatting Guidelines\n\nWriting for Our Audience\n\nWhen preparing your manuscript to GHSP, please ensure that your manuscript:\n\nKeeps our key intended audience of public health practitioners in mind. What are the practical implications of the work documented in your paper for decision makers focused on health programs and services?\n\nClearly articulates 2-3 essential points for the reader to take away in the key messages, including the most important findings and the implications of these findings.\n\nProvides sufficient detail about key program elements.\n\nHow the intervention was implemented?\n\nWhether an intervention or program was a success?\n\nCharacteristics of the setting the reader needs to understand the conditions that are necessary for success?\n\nWhat factors appear to account for the observed success/failures?\n\nFor example, in addition to reporting the impact of a communication program on child undernutrition:\n\nWhat details are important to know about the communication program itself?\n\nHow was the program delivered?\n\nWhat were the important characteristics of the population or setting that may be relevant to observed performance?\n\nFor “lessons learned,” will findings be relevant to the reader's setting or context?​\n\nFormatting Text\n\nUse U.S. English spelling.\n\nAll text should be in 12-point Times New Roman font and double-spaced.\n\nUse a single space at the end of each sentence.\n\nUse a comma before the final \"and\" or \"or\" in a list of terms.\n\nInsert page numbers.\n\nDo not use line numbers; these will be inserted by our intake system.\n\nAll numbers, including numbers less than 10, should be written as numerals in the text.\n\nDo not use footnotes or endnotes for references in the text. Avoid, if possible, using footnotes to elaborate on the text.\n\nGHSP refers to the AMA Manual of Style (11th edition), published by the American Medical Association and Oxford University Press.\n\nWe do not set explicit limits on the length of papers submitted, but we encourage authors to be concise to reach our audience effectively. In some cases, providing more detail in appendices may be appropriate.\n\nTitle Page\n\nThe title page MUST include all of the following information:\n\nConcise full title (20 words or fewer).\n\nInclude the study design type, if applicable, for example, “a prospective cohort study,” or “a case-control study.”\n\nInclude the city and/or country name in the title, if applicable.\n\nShort title: (10 words or fewer)\n\nAuthor names and respective institutional affiliations and their locations (city, country). Do not include educational degrees or position titles.\n\nNotes: Author names should be listed only on the title page to ensure anonymity during peer review.\n\nIf there is more than one first author, please indicate that.\n\nIf the corresponding author will change after publication, please indicate that.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFunding statement\n\nCompeting interests\n\nMain Body\n\nThe main body of the manuscript should include:\n\nTitle\n\nAbstract: Limited to 300 words. Can be structured in IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) format or unstructured.\n\nTeaser Key Message: In 1 or 2 short sentences, succinctly summarize the essential message of your paper including the significance for action.\n\nDetailed Key Messages: All manuscripts must include key messages that detail the essential points of their manuscript.\n\nFor viewpoints, commentaries, and innovation articles: Include “Key Messages” which further details the major points of the article in 1-3 bulleted items.\n\nFor original articles, reviews, field action reports, short reports, technical notes, and methodologies: Summarize Key Findings and major points of the article in 1-3 bulleted items and list the Key Implications of the article that are directed toward specific public health audience segments (e.g., Policy makers should… Program managers… National stakeholders…\n\nThe main text can be structured in different ways, especially for papers reporting on program implementation issues. The conventional IMRAD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) for scientific articles, or variations of it, may be appropriate. For program implementation articles, an additional heading for “Program Description” (including details of how the program was implemented) may be inserted after the Introduction. Subheadings are encouraged to better orient the reader to the content.\n\nIllustrations, Figures, and Photos\n\nResolution of photos should be approximately 300 dpi (dots per inch), and line or halftone figures and illustrations should be approximately 600 dpi.\n\nFor the initial submission, each item should be embedded in the manuscript.\n\nFor a revised submission (after peer review), each illustration and figure should be a separate file. Submission of original and editable files is highly encouraged. The quality of the files received will affect time taken to prepare the figures for publication.\n\nNumber each illustration and figure separately and include a short title. Cite each in the text in consecutive numerical order.\n\nPhotos should have a short caption describing the action in the photo, name of the photographer and organization (if applicable), and year the photo was taken.\n\nTables\n\nTables should have a number, include a descriptive title, and be cited in the text in consecutive numerical order.\n\nFor the initial submission, each table should be embedded in the manuscript.\n\nFor a revised submission (after peer review), tables should be in a separate file.\n\nReferences\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice follows the American Medical Association (AMA) (11th edition) reference style.

We believe one of our roles is to guide the author through the peer review process. In addition to sending comments from individual peer reviewers to authors, we also consolidate comments from all the reviewers and submit a summary of key issues that the Journal wants the authors to focus on during the revision stage (when appropriate). This helps authors take the guesswork out of interpreting what could sometimes be conflicting feedback from reviewers.\n\nEach paper submitted to Global Health: Science and Practice will be screened by our editorial staff, within 6-8 weeks of submission. Original Articles, Reviews/Meta-Analyses, Field Action Reports, Technical Notes, and Methodological papers that are considered appropriate for the Journal will then typically be sent to at least 2 peer reviewers; Commentaries and Viewpoints to at least 1 peer reviewer. We will consider authors' suggestions for reviewers to invite and those to exclude. Stories From the Field and Letters to the Editor will be reviewed by our editorial staff.\n\nThe role of peer reviewers is to recommend acceptance–either with or without revision or resubmission–or rejection of papers. In the case of discordant reviews, the Editors may seek review by an additional expert. The Editors make the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection taking into account reviewers’ recommendations. We aim to issue a final decision on all articles within 16 weeks of submission but due to increased manuscript volume and reviewer shortages due to COVID, that is not always possible.\n\nPublication of articles by Global Health: Science and Practice is dependent primarily on their rigor, clarity, and potential impact, as judged by peer reviewers and the Journal Editors. Main criteria on which peer reviewers will assess the paper include:\n\nImportance and relevance of the topic\n\nOriginality of the work that adds value to the existing body of knowledge\n\nSubstance\n\nSound study (or program) design and methodology (or implementation)\n\nSound use of evidence\n\nCompelling conclusions that are actionable and based on the evidence presented\n\nPresentation and clarity of writing\n\nPapers will be sent to a statistician for additional review if necessary based on recommendations from the reviewers and Journal Editors.\n\nAuthors can formally appeal an editorial decision, in which case the Journal Editors will review the decision in accordance with the procedures outlined in the COPE Code of Conduct for Editors.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDiversity and Voice Policy\n\nGHSP recognizes the value in having diverse voices and perspectives represented in our journal, including diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, and geography. In global health program work and publishing, power structures have placed certain players in a position to claim more decision making authority and credit than others. These and other power asymmetries, including imbalances caused by institutional and personal authority, have resulted in work that is less likely to contribute to improved well-being and strengthened institutions worldwide. At GHSP, we seek to increase the inclusion of voices and perspectives from low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) in global health work and published material arising from such work.\n\nGHSP is taking the following active measures to improve this situation:\n\nGHSP is increasing the diversity of our staff, editorial board, associate editors, and peer reviewers.\n\nGHSP is committed to ensuring that perspectives from authors based in LMICs are appropriately reflected in the articles we publish. To that end:\n\nWe particularly welcome articles from authors based in LMICs.\n\nWe encourage all those who conduct research, evaluations, or implement programs in LMICs to include in-country stakeholders in meaningful ways to contribute to the research and work; ultimately, we expect this to be reflected in the authorship of articles coming out of this work.\n\nWe welcome articles that showcase programs, methods, or approaches that engage local-country counterparts substantively; promote diversity and inclusion; respect the local context; and foster and support locally-driven solutions.\n\nFor any articles submitted to GHSP that report results from research or program experience in a given country that lack authors based in that country, the authors need to explain the reasons for this in the cover letter accompanying the submission.\n\nBack to Top\n\nEthical and Responsible Publication Principles and Policies\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice is committed to meeting and upholding established ethical publication policies and practices at all stages of the publication process, drawing on standards and guidelines set by industry associations, namely the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), the World Association of Medical Editors, and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).\n\nAuthorship\n\nAll authors should meet all 4 of the ICMJE Recommendations criteria for authorship:\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work.\n\nDrafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content.\n\nFinal approval of the version to be published.\n\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nAuthors should ensure that all authors listed on the paper meet all ICJME 4 criteria above and that any individuals who meet these criteria have not been excluded from authorship.\n\nAuthors should submit a statement that details authors’ and other individuals’ contributions to the planning, implementation, research, or writing of the work in the article.\n\nAuthors should acknowledge any individuals who do not meet the criteria for authorship but who have contributed to the programming, research, evaluation, analysis, or other aspects of the manuscript preparation in the Acknowledgments section.\n\nIf authors report results from research or program experience in a specific country, authors based in that country should be included if they meet the criteria. If no in-country authors are included, the authors need to explain the reasons for this exclusion in the cover letter accompanying the submission.\n\nEthics\n\nAuthors should ensure that research was conducted in an ethical and responsible manner, that it was sound and properly executed, and that appropriate methods of data analysis and display were used.\n\nResearch involving human subjects or animals should be conducted according to appropriate ethical standards (i.e., the Declaration of Helsinki).\n\nEvery article that is submitted should include a statement that the researchers obtained ethics approval from the name of the ethics committee institutional review board.\n\nIn some circumstances it may be acceptable for authors to get retrospective ethics approval to publish monitoring or evaluation data collected as part of project efforts (i.e., not strictly research data); in any case, the author needs to explain how data collection conformed to international standards including, if applicable, how informed consent was obtained.\n\nEvery article should include a statement that all participants gave their informed consent before participating, how consent was obtained, and measures to ensure that privacy and confidentiality of personal information were maintained.\n\nReporting Guidelines\n\nAuthors should follow reporting guidelines applicable to the type of research, such as the CONSORT statement for reporting of randomized controlled trials, PRISMA for reporting of systematic reviews, and the mERA checklist for reporting of health interventions using mobile phones. For a full list of reporting guidelines, please refer to the EQUATOR website.\n\nAuthors should disclose sources of research funding and the role of the research funder or sponsor in the research design, execution, analysis, interpretation, and reporting.\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nAuthors should disclose relevant financial and nonfinancial interests and relationships that might be considered likely to affect the interpretation of the findings, in accordance with the ICMJE unified disclosure form.\n\nAll declared competing interests, or a statement indicating that there are no competing interests if appropriate, will be listed at the end of GHSP published articles.\n\nCorrections\n\nWe give ample opportunity for authors to review the manuscript after copyediting and after layout. We ask that authors use this opportunity to make any corrections to wording, ensure accuracy of information, and clarify meaning.\n\nAuthors should alert editors if they discover an error in any submitted, accepted, or published article and should cooperate with the editors in issuing corrections or retractions when required.\n\nFor minor corrections that do not affect the technical or scientific understanding of the article (such as wording preference, typos, etc.), the correction is only made at the discretion of the editors.\n\nFor substantive errors, GHSP will issue corrigenda (author’s error) and errata (publisher’s error). We will publish corrections to published articles as soon as possible and to retract the article if the error renders the work invalid. GHSP may charge a nominal fee for issuing the correction.\n\nFor Advanced Access articles, corrections will be posted online to replace the original version.\n\nFor published articles in an issue, a new version of the article will be posted online with a Corrigendum appearing in the following issue.\n\nEditors' Responsibilities\n\nEditors will seek to ensure the quality of articles that are published in GHSP and to make fair and unbiased decisions about what is to be published in GHSP. The Editor-in-Chief of GHSP has editorial freedom and full authority over the editorial content of the journal and the timing of publication of that content.\n\nEditors encourage authors to engage and collaborate with authors of diverse backgrounds, in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, and geography.\n\nEditors encourage and ask authors who are implementing programs or conducting research in low- and middle-income countries to engage stakeholders from those countries in meaningful ways in the decision making, planning, implementation, and research.\n\nGHSP believes an anonymous review process promotes the best quality publications and strives to protect that anonymity for that reason as well as to protect the sensitivities of authors and reviewers. Hence, we strive:\n\nEditors will protect the confidentiality of authors’ materials during peer review and remind reviewers to do so as well.\n\nEditors will protect reviewers’ identities unless a reviewer wishes for her/his name to be disclosed.\n\nEditors will conduct fair and appropriate peer review.\n\nEditors ensure the integrity of published articles by investigating any serious concerns about the conduct, validity, or reporting of academic work raised by authors, reviewers, readers, or others while also providing authors a reasonable opportunity to respond to any complaints.\n\nEditors encourage scholarly debate by providing readers the opportunity to post comments online about published articles and/or to submit formal letters to the editor.\n\nEditors recuse themselves from any discussions or decisions concerning submitted manuscripts on which they are authors or if, for any other reason, they may be seen to have a conflict of interest.\n\nReviewers\n\nTo agree to review only those manuscripts for which they have expertise in the subject.\n\nTo respond in a reasonable time frame.\n\nTo respect the confidentiality of the peer review process.\n\nTo declare all potential conflicting interests.\n\nTo be objective and constructive in their reviews.\n\nProcedures for Dealing With Alleged Scientific Misconduct\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice recognizes our role in protecting the integrity of the public scientific record and will do so by sharing reasonable concerns with authorities who can conduct such an investigation. Examples of scientific misconduct include but are not limited to falsification of data, plagiarism, and improprieties of authorship (such as inclusion of individuals as authors who have not made a definite contribution to the work published or misrepresentation of the same material as original in more than one publication).\n\nAll serious allegations of misconduct will be referred to the Editor-In-Chief, who will review the circumstances in consultation with the deputy editors. Initial fact-finding will usually include a request to all the involved parties to state their case and explain the circumstances in writing. In questions of research misconduct centering on methods or technical issues, the Editor-In-Chief may confidentially consult experts who are blinded to the identity of the individuals, or if the allegation is against an editor, an outside editor expert.\n\nWhen allegations concern authors, the peer review and publication process for the manuscript in question will be halted while the process above is carried out. The inquiry will be completed even if the authors withdraw their paper. In the case of allegations against reviewers or editors, those reviewers or editors will be replaced in the peer review process while the matter is investigated.\n\nGHSP subscribes to the principles underlying the COPE guidelines and will use as guidance the COPE flowcharts of suggested actions for specific allegations. If our inquiry concludes in an unsatisfactory response, the Editor-in-Chief will refer the matter to the authors’ institutions or other appropriate bodies. In rare cases, the Editor-in-Chief may decide to retract a published article if he/she is convinced that serious misconduct has happened.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCopyright Statement\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice applies the Creative Commons Attribution License to all articles that we publish. Under this license, authors retain ownership of copyright for their articles or they can transfer copyright to their institution, but authors allow anyone without permission to copy, distribute, transmit, and/or adapt articles, so long as the original authors and source are cited.\n\nBack to Top\n\nArchiving Policy\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice preserves access to the journal content via PubMedCentral in the event the journal is no longer published.\n\nBack to Top\n\nArticle Level Metrics\n\nGlobal Health: Science and Practice provides information about the article usage on the \"Info and Metrics\" tab of each article.\n\nBack to Top\n\nResources for Writing Journal Articles\n\nWe will do as much as we can to provide editorial support to authors whose primary language is not English. For authors with little experience in publishing journal articles, please consult other resources that provide guidance on how to write journal articles. For example:\n\nAuthorAid, based at the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP), provides free mentoring, resources, and training to support researchers in developing countries to publish their work.\n\nThe European Association of Science Editors (EASE) produces and updates annually the EASE Guidelines for Authors and Translators of Scientific Articles, which is currently available in 20 languages. It provides simple advice for writing journal articles that are complete, concise, and clear, as well as practical tips for junior authors.\n\nSciDev.Net produced the following relevant practical guides: How do I submit a paper to a scientific journal? and How do I write a scientific paper?\n\nThe World Health Organization’s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean produced A Practical Guide for Health Researchers, which includes helpful sections on writing and publishing a scientific paper.\n\nThe ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals provides some general guidance on how to prepare research-based journal articles.\n\nThe Global Health eLearning Center course Journal Manuscript Development for Global Health provides an easy-to-navigate tutorial on preparing research and program-based journal articles.\n\nBack to Top"
