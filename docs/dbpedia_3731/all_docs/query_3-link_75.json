        "text": "Prior to submission, please carefully read and follow the submission guidelines detailed below. Manuscripts that do not conform to the submission guidelines may be returned without review.\n\nSubmission\n\nPsychological Services® uses a software system to screen submitted content for similarity with other published content. The system compares each submitted manuscript against a database of 25+ million scholarly publications, as well as content appearing on the open web.\n\nThis allows APA to check submissions for potential overlap with material previously published in scholarly journals (e.g., lifted or republished material). A similarity report will be generated by the system and provided to the Psychological Services Editorial office for review immediately upon submission.\n\nTo submit to the editorial office of Lisa K. Kearney, please submit manuscripts electronically through the Manuscript Submission Portal in Microsoft Word (.docx) or LaTex (.tex) as a zip file with an accompanied Portable Document Format (.pdf) of the manuscript file.\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual). APA Style and Grammar Guidelines for the 7th edition are available.\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nAuthors should keep a copy of the manuscript to guard against loss. Please provide full contact information—authors' addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and fax numbers—for use by the editorial office and later by the production office.\n\nGeneral correspondence may be directed to the editorial office.\n\nManuscripts\n\nAll manuscripts must include on separate pages:\n\na title page with the author's name and affiliation at the time the research was done\n\nauthor notes, which include acknowledgments of support, changes of affiliation since the research was done, and the name and address of the author to whom correspondence should be sent\n\nan abstract containing a maximum of 250 words, followed, below it, by up to five keywords or brief phrases to assist in indexing\n\nNumber all pages serially, including these pages, the text, references, acknowledgments, tables, and figure captions.\n\nInclude in a cover letter assurances that the manuscript is not under review elsewhere and that the primary data have not been published previously nor accepted for publication.\n\nMasked review policy\n\nManuscripts will be subject to masked review.\n\nAuthors' names and affiliations should appear only on the separate title page and separate author footnotes page if any; authors should not be identified anywhere else in the manuscript. Authors should make every effort to see that the manuscript itself contains no clues to their identities. If a study has been pre-registered, please create and add an anonymized link to the repository for peer review.\n\nIt is acceptable for authors to suggest individuals qualified to do the reviewing.\n\nThis journal is participating in the STM Peer Review Taxonomy Pilot. This pilot aims to identify and standardize definitions and terminology in peer review practices across publishers to help make the peer review process for articles and journals more transparent, and enable the community to better assess and compare peer review practices between different journals. More information is available online.\n\nThe following summary describes the peer review process for this journal:\n\nidentity transparency: double anonymized\n\nreviewer interacts with: editor\n\nreview information published: none\n\nManuscript preparation\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual).\n\nReview APA's Journal Manuscript Preparation Guidelines before submitting your article.\n\nDouble-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the Manual. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the APA Style website.\n\nIf submitting a brief report, the manuscript should be prepared in line with the guidelines for full-length articles, yet should not exceed 15 pages.\n\nCommentaries\n\nPsychological Services will consider commentaries on articles previously published in this journal. Comments will be sent out for external review and must meet a high threshold for publication.\n\nComments will be evaluated based on how accurately and fairly they represent the target article, the importance of the comment in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the target article, and the clarity, conciseness, and tone of the writing. External reviewers will include individuals not associated with the target article as well as the corresponding author of the target article.\n\nOnly brief comments will be considered. A brief comment is written in response to a single article previously published in Psychological Services. The primary purpose is to provide a meaningful insight, concern, alternative interpretation, clarification, or critical analysis. The comment should provide a richer and more comprehensive understanding of a methodological, conceptual, or interpretation issue that significantly adds to the literature.\n\nBrief comments should not exceed 265 lines of text including references. This limit does not include the title page, abstract, or author notes.\n\nThe title of a brief comment should include a subtitle reflecting the actual title and year of publication of the article that engendered the comment. For example— \"The importance of focusing on external validity: A brief comment on Testing the Efficacy of Two Differing Types of Stress Management Interventions for the Treatment of Essential Hypertension (Jones & Smith, 2012).\"\n\nBrief comments must be submitted in a timely manner, no later than six months after publication of the original article.\n\nUpon acceptance of a brief comment, the author(s) of the original paper would be invited to submit a response; if the authors' response is acceptable, both the brief comment and response would be published together. Such responses to a brief comment also should not exceed 265 lines of text including references.\n\nBelow are additional instructions regarding the preparation of display equations, computer code, and tables.\n\nDisplay equations\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor 3.0 (built into pre-2007 versions of Word) to construct your equations, rather than the equation support that is built into Word 2007 and Word 2010. Equations composed with the built-in Word 2007/Word 2010 equation support are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors.\n\nTo construct your equations with MathType or Equation Editor 3.0:\n\nGo to the Text section of the Insert tab and select Object.\n\nSelect MathType or Equation Editor 3.0 in the drop-down menu.\n\nIf you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.\n\nUse Equation Editor 3.0 or MathType only for equations or for formulas that cannot be produced as Word text using the Times or Symbol font.\n\nComputer code\n\nBecause altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.\n\nIn online supplemental material\n\nWe request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit Supplementing Your Article With Online Material.\n\nIn the text of the article\n\nIf you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.\n\nTables\n\nUse Word's insert table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.\n\nAcademic writing and English language editing services\n\nAuthors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several vendors that offer discounts to APA authors.\n\nPlease note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.\n\nUse of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.\n\nSubmitting supplemental materials\n\nAPA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the APA PsycArticles® database. Please see Supplementing Your Article With Online Material for more details.\n\nAbstract and keywords\n\nAll manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.\n\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion in Psychological Services\n\nPsychological Services is committed to improving equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in scientific research, in line with the APA Publishing EDI framework and APA’s trio of 2021 resolutions to address systemic racism in psychology. Please review our journal EDI statement for more details.\n\nThe journal encourages submissions which extend beyond Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic samples (Henrich, et al., 2010). The journal welcomes submissions which feature Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) and other historically marginalized sample populations. The journal particularly welcomes submissions which feature collaborative research models (e.g., community-based participatory research; see Collins, et al., 2018) and study designs that address heterogeneity within diverse samples. Studies focused exclusively on BIPOC and other historically excluded populations are also welcome.\n\nAuthor contribution statements using CRediT\n\nThe APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) stipulates that \"authorship encompasses…not only persons who do the writing but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study.\" In the spirit of transparency and openness, Psychological Services has adopted the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) to describe each author's individual contributions to the work. CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and detailed description of their diverse contributions to a manuscript.\n\nSubmitting authors must identify the contributions of all authors at initial submission according to the CRediT taxonomy. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the CRediT designations will be published as an author contributions statement in the author note of the final article. All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission.\n\nAuthors can claim credit for more than one contributor role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author. Not all roles will be applicable to a particular scholarly work.\n\nPublic significance statement\n\nAs part of the submission of any article to Psychological Services, authors should include a public significance statement of 1-3 sentences (approximately 30-70 words in length) beneath the abstract. This statement is to provide a brief summary of the paper's significance for a broad audience, including policy makers, public media, and the public. It should also be written for the audience of our journal, which includes psychologists in public sector settings, serving as clinicians, administrators, and/or researchers.\n\nWithin the statement, please include the main findings of your paper in approachable language and describe how the findings are important to policy makers, public media, psychologists in public sector settings, and the public. Avoid the use of psychological jargon and technical language and make sure the statement is understandable without the context of the abstract, as these statements may be utilized separately in social media platforms. The statement should not be a sentence or two taken directly out of the submitted manuscript but should be a statement which is informative and useful for any reader.\n\nWhen a paper is published, the public significance statement will be placed in a box beneath the abstract and will be placed in the table of contents and the journal's web page. Additional guidance on the development of such statements is available in the Guidance for Translational Abstracts and Public Significance Statements.\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the references section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal article\n\nMcCauley, S.
