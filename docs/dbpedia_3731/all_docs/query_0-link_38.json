It might well be worthwhile promoting a discourse such as that which has emerged around embarrassment. By DAVID DIBOSA\n\nMarch 1st, 2021 — Rosa Mercedes / 02\n\n02\n\n\"Lie,\" \"fraud,\" \"perpetrator,\" \"victim,\" \"forgery,\" \"deception,\" \"censorship,\" \"deprivation of liberty,\" \"betrayal,\" \"violence,\" and, yes, \"conspiracy\" — these are not arbitrarily chosen expressions of everyday culture, but juridifying terms used for rhetorical weaponization in all parts of the political sphere.

BY ISOBEL WOHL\n\nJanuary 4th, 2021 — Rosa Mercedes / 02\n\n02\n\nHowever, it’s okay to have Game Night once in a while, because it allows us to socialize. Using wrinkles to toggle dry light. By DEATH CLASS\n\nNovember 13th, 2020 — Rosa Mercedes / 02\n\n02\n\nThe production of knowledge, fake news, has no source, no center. There is no author. By VLADIMIR MILADINOVIĆ and STEPHENIE YOUNG\n\nSeptember 30th, 2020 — Rosa Mercedes / 02\n\n02\n\n“The game on TV is Tom and Jerry, the game in the EU is refugees and the police.” By NIKA AUTOR\n\nSeptember 17th, 2020 — Rosa Mercedes / 02\n\n02\n\nThe current crisis is making many of us increasingly amenable to other forms of more mundane automation.
