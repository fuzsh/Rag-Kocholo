        "text": "Read Jack Serle's latest HSJi Review, which talks about how a succession of trusts have seen their maternity services rated as “inadequate” by the Care Quality Commission.\n\nThe latest national audit of perinatal services shows neonatal mortality is increasing. Locally, 34 per cent of NHS maternity services are rated as “red”, meaning they are reporting mortality rates at least 5 per cent higher than their peer groups. Read the full article here.\n\nLatest investigations\n\nHertfordshire and West Essex ICS\n\nLeadership is atypically stable at the Hertfordshire and West Essex Integrated Care System. The new medium-term plan sets out five priorities for the rest of the decade. Local health and care partnerships are to be given limited decision-making powers. The system is among the worst performers against the four-hour accident and emergency target. Emergency departments are struggling with space constraints. Urgent care centre for patients in mental health crisis is being expanded, and 999 callers are being triaged to community services. The ICS has been struggling with community paediatric waits. A combined service for Hertfordshire aims to address these challenges. The system needs to bring down the forecast £44.9m deficit. Service reduction options are being explored. Health Services Laboratories has been chosen as the pathology service provider.\n\nCamden and Islington Foundation Trust\n\nThe trust is due to merge with a neighbouring provider this autumn. The merger plans are being scrutinised by NHS England. The merged organisation will seek to reduce variation in service quality. There is a focus on improving the effectiveness of community services. There is concern over the underperformance of memory services. A recovery plan is being put in place. C&IFT and Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust are working to control the length of stay among adult acute patients. There’s a focus on removing barriers to discharge. The trust opened two new mental health facilities in 2024. It must find a new home for the dialysis unit.\n\nBarts Health Trust\n\nThe trust is prioritising bringing down the elective waits, with paediatric dentistry a particular focus. Barts is dependent on mutual aid from other NHS bodies and the use of private sector. Charity has bought surgical robots for use in the trust’s theatres. It is undertaking an innovative scheme to address health inequalities in cancer. Questions have arisen over the partnership with BHRUT after the departure of the shared chair. Work on sharing back-office functions will continue but moves to combine more clinical services are less certain. The trust has set an ambitious 5 per cent savings programme which includes a substantial headcount reduction. It is hoping for a go-ahead on the Whipps Cross rebuild soon.\n\nData\n\nLast week the following data points were updated:"
