        "text": "Authors who are considering the likelihood of submitting a paper to the Journal are recommended to pay close attention to the following information:\n\nWhen asked to indicate the type of article to submit, the most common choice is “Original Research Article,” which is defined below along with other types. Typically, that article subsequently may lead reviewers to recommend that the paper be rejected for publication or reclassified as either a Research Note or a Potential Patterns manuscript.\n\nHence, authors are encouraged to give thoughtful consideration beforehand regarding whether their papers initially should be submitted in the Original Research Article category. Even if these items are not rejected and authors subsequently are asked instead to consider having manuscripts reclassified, the latter step entails added time and effort for both authors and reviewers.\n\nSome examples of why decisions are made either to reject for publication or undergo a reclassification of the type of paper are:\n\n-Insufficient sample size.\n\n-Concepts are introduced, but not addressed in the analysis section. Also, the Discussion section fails to follow logically from the Analysis section.\n\n-Adequate information is lacking about the study design.\n\n-Authors' main points are difficult to unravel to determine and there is not enough supporting data to support these points.\n\n-Demographic data on study participants are insufficient, which can affect generalizability of the findings.\n\n-A study may have significant conceptual, methodological, and statistical deficiencies in all areas: sampling process, methodology, statistical analyses, and interpretations. Also, not enough information is provided to answer the \"so what\" about the research question. Nonetheless, the topic may be of interest to readers, warranting a conversion of the paper from a research perspective to a Commentary that has much less of a quantitative focus.\n\n-Nowhere in the manuscript is there any indication that the model has been piloted, tested, and validated. No data are presented.\n\n-The Methods section must state more clearly the inclusion criteria for the study sample.\n\n-Terminology using common and familiar concepts needs to be provided for readers who represent a wide range of health professions. For example, jargon used in a particular discipline will be unfamiliar to individuals who are in different disciplines.\n\nManuscript Review Process\n\nInitial Evaluation: When a manuscript is received in the office of the Journal of Allied Health, it is sent to two or three reviewers who are either members of the Editorial Board or Peer Reviewers. With a one-month turnaround time to complete the review, they can suggest one of four categories:\n\nPublish as is,\n\nPublish with minor revisions,\n\nPublish with major revisions, or\n\nDo not publish\n\nRevisions and Editing: If there is a disagreement, the Editor makes the decision as to whether the review should continue. If the decision puts the manuscript in the publishable category, the reviewers’ comments are sent to the author for revision. Authors also are given a one-month turnaround time to make revisions.\n\nThe revised manuscript is returned to the same reviewers, along with all critiques of the manuscript. Again, they are given a one-month turnaround time for further review.\n\nThis process is continued until a final decision is made as to whether or not to publish the manuscript. Once accepted, it is placed in the queue for publication."
