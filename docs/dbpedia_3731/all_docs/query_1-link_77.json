HSJ Award teaser video\n\nIt is to our excitement to announce, that Coventry & Warwickshire ICS won the Performance Recovery Award, for improving the Physical Health of People with Severe Mental Illness in Coventry and Warwickshire. A huge congratulations to everyone and to our SMI (Serious Mental Illness) team who has made a massive impact on increasing the numbers and quality of health checks available to people with severe mental illness in Coventry and Warwickshire. This has been achieved through collaborative and innovative working with our local partners and patients.\n\nCoventry and Warwickshire have created a system-wide offer, which is in place to deliver high-quality annual physical health checks and support for people with serious mental illness. The incredible numbers and figures have been shared, with the successful partnership across several organisations with experts with experience. The percentage of people on the SML register receiving physical health checks went from 10.3 percent in Q1 2021 – 2022 to an amazing 67.8 percent in Q4 2022-2023 – which was above the target of 63.37 percent.\n\nWell done to everyone who has made an impact in increasing the number of people receiving help with SMI. But a special well done to Sarah, Brogan, and the rest of our SMI team!\n\nFor more information can be found on our LinkedIn post\n\nHSJ Awards 2023: Performance Recovery Award"
