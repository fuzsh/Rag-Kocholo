        "text": "It’s been several decades since the Atari 2600 has been a hot-selling video game console during the holiday season, but it might be once again thanks to the launch of the new Atari 2600+ in November 2023.\n\nVideo game developer/publisher PLAION and Atari have announced that the 2600+ — a modern-day, faithful re-creation of the classic four-switch version of the 2600 that was released in 1980 — will be launching worldwide on Friday, Nov. 17, 2023. It is available to pre-order for $129.99 (U.S.).\n\nThe Atari 2600+ build upon the original machine with what it calls “modern quality of life features,” including an HDMI out (which is very convenient, as anyone who has experienced the challenge of trying to hook up an old Atari 2600, with its old-fashioned switch box, to a modern television, recognizes), USB power and multiple screen resolutions.\n\nThis console is also smaller, designed at 80% of the original’s size, to better accommodate today’s living spaces.\n\nThe Atari 2600+ is backward-compatible with old Atari 2600 and 7800 games\n\nIn addition to reviving the look of the original console, complete with the metal switches and wood grain panel, the 2600+ also includes a faithful replica of the CX40+ joystick, which has been re-created with the same size and layout as the original. A standalone CX-40 joystick will retail for $24.99.\n\nThe cartridge slot of the 2600+ is backward-compatible with hundreds of original games for the Atari 2600 and the Atari 7800.\n\nIf you don’t have any of those still lying around, the 2600+ will launch with a cartridge featuring 10 classic Atari 2600 games: Adventure, Combat, Dodge ‘Em, Haunted House, Maze Craze, Missile Command, RealSports Volleyball, Surround, Video Pinball and Yars’ Revenge.\n\nSold separately is a CX-30 paddle controller with a 4-in-1 multi-game cartridge featuring paddle-based titles (Breakout, Canyon Bomber, Night Driver and Video Olympics) that will retail for $39.99.\n\nAdditional launch titles for the Atari 2600+, including cartridges for Berzerk Enhanced Edition and Mr. Run and Jump, will be available for $29.99.\n\nYou can learn a little more in this teaser:\n\n“Preserving classic games is a priority for Atari, and the release of the Atari 2600+ will make the hundreds of Atari 2600 and 7800 games that have been released over the last 50 years universally accessible,” said Atari Chairman and CEO, Wade Rosen. “PLAION’s approach to a quality recreation of iconic Atari hardware made them the perfect partner to bring the Atari 2600+ to market.”\n\n“We’re excited to be working with Atari to bring back the Atari 2600 and help meet the growing consumer demand for retro hardware,” said at Ben Jones, commercial director of retro for PLAION (ASIDE: I’d love to be a “director of retro” someplace!).\n\n“For gamers who remember the thrill of playing arcade games at home for the very first time, the Atari 2600+ will take you right back. For everyone else, the offer is one of timeless fun and the chance to experience a golden age of video games in a way that could only come from Atari.”\n\nFor more information or to pre-order, visit this link."
