        "text": "Gamers can hark back to the early days of gaming with a retro gaming system that’s 15 percent off at Amazon. The Atari 2600+ – which is exclusive to Amazon – is an “updated and enhanced” version of the “iconic” Atari 2600 from 1980.\n\nShoppers can pick up the old-school system for £85, £14.99 of its usual price tag. The Atari 2600+ is designed to look and feel like the original 4-switch Atari 2600. It comes complete with a CX40+ joystick controller that has been recreated with the same size and layout as the original 2600 joystick, so gamers can relive the experiences from the simpler days of home console video gaming.\n\nThis modern version also plays Atari 7800 games, has a widescreen mode and easily connects to a modern TV thanks to its HDMI port. The bundle also includes a 10-in-1 game cartridge packed with classic Atari titles like Combat, Dodge ‘Em, Missile Command, Realsports Volleyball and Video Pinball.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoppers can get a free Samsung Galaxy S24 phone worth £999 by updating their TV\n\nREAD MORE: Fallout season two update as show becomes second most-watched ever on Amazon Prime Video\n\nShoppers can also pick up a range of extra games on Amazon, including Mr. Run and Jump and Berzerk. It’s fair to say Amazon customers have been impressed with the Atari console, which currently boasts 4.5 stars out of 5 after 229 ratings – 162 of which are five-star.\n\nOne satisfied shopper said: “This is a time machine! Is it worth the money? I’m going to say yes. Especially if you want the retro gaming experience.”\n\nAnother added: “Excellent little console that has shown some excellent attention to detail. HDMI connectivity and runs off of a phone charger. It will also play just about all of the old original cartridges too, this is a big plus for me as I have several. Joystick feels identical to the originals and is definitely not just some flimsy plastic knock off.”\n\nA third said: “Nostalgia heaven. A wonderful replica of the original Atari VCS. So easy to use on a modern smart TV allowing you to play those favourite childhood games that have sat waiting in the attic for this device to come along. The simplicity, fun and addictive nature of the Atari favourites is a joy. For anyone that played on the original Atari console, just owning this brings a smile to your face.”\n\nHowever, some customers were frustrated that the Atari does not include a power adapter and just a USB cable that can be connected straight to a smart TV or used with other main plugs. “This doesn’t come with a power adapter. Ensure you have a suitable USB/USB-C charger,” one customer said."
