Win Win!\n\nDon't try and get crafty by using an automatic RF switch (i.e. one that does not physically have to be switched between the \"TV\" and \"game\" position), like an automatic one from a NES.\n\nThese will not work for the 2600/7800, as the signal is not strong enough to trigger the switch completely.\n\nThe coax to RCA adapters work really well, and I don't think you can get any simpler for best quality. But the only issue with that is you cannot plug your cable into your TV. I have used RF to composite converters (demodulator) in the past. That way, you can convert the RF signal to a standard yellow composite jack and keep your cable input open. Bad side-- not the cheapest ~$70\n\nThese give a better picture than switch boxes:\n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/ATARI-2600-...040?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c1f14dff8\n\nI don't know anything about this seller, I just liked their funny picture showing how to hook it up. I include these with the 2600's we sell.\n\nYeah, I always preferred using the F-Type Coax to RCA connecters when I had to use RF connections.\n\nWorks with all the systems 16 bit and earlier except maybe the model 2 genesis.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I didn't notice how bad the video of the RF switches were back in the day. I never noticed all the lines and interference until I started using better equipment.\n\nThese give a better picture than switch boxes:\n\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/ATARI-2600-...040?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c1f14dff8\n\nI don't know anything about this seller, I just liked their funny picture showing how to hook it up. I include these with the 2600's we sell.\n\nthat's what i use. the picture isn't bad, i'd just like to see if i can clean it up and try to make as good as it does on a crt tv without modding it. i had heard somewhere that the tv/game switchboxes produced a better pic than the coax-rca adapter does, so that's why i was wondering about that."
