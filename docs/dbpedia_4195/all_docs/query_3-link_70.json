        "text": "When I got back into gaming a few years ago, I started with the Atari 7800 and collected mostly 7800 carts. Lately, I have had the desire to re-build my Atari 2600 collection. Back in the early eighties, I had a number of Activision games and always enjoyed their colorful boxes and cartridges. Unfortunately, the labels on Activision carts typically develop ‘anti-plaque’ and most haven’t held up well. In fact, even if you can find a ‘new in the box’ Activision game, the cart label will typically not look very good.\n\nWith multiple multi-carts available for the 2600, collecting carts is more about having something cool to look at, more so than any kind of necessity. Given the condition of most Activision cart labels, this really wasn’t all that appealing…until recently. Last week, I obtained some replacement Activision labels from Phil Boland (pboland on AtariAge) and replaced the labels on several of my carts.\n\nThis is a great project, even for someone new to the hobby. I started by using a hair dryer to slightly warm up the glue and loosen the cart label, being careful not to get the cart too warm. With a little heat, most labels will come off easily, but I did have one come off in small pieces. I then used a wet wipe and a paper towel with a little rubbing alcohol to remove the remaining glue residue from the cart shell.\n\nWhile the label was off, I carefully opened the cart and cleaned the circuit board and the inside of the cart shell. To clean the inside of the cart, I used a Q-tip and a little more rubbing alcohol. Then I reassembled the cart, being careful not to tighten the screws too much. Remembering that the 35+ year old plastic could be brittle, I didn’t want damage the cart shell. Now all that was left to do, was apply the new label. I took my time to make sure that the label was aligned correctly and started from one end and bent it around the corner of the shell.\n\nPhil’s labels stick really well and look great. Now my Activision carts look awesome and as colorful as they were back in the eighties. They should be good for another twenty years!!!\n\n@Atarigameguy\n\nP.S. Please note that Phil’s labels are perfect, just poor lighting in the last photo"
