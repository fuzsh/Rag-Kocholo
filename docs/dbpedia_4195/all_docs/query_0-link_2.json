        "text": "The Atari 2600 is a home video game console released in September 1977. Sears licensed the console and many games from Atari, Inc., selling them under different names. Three cartridges were Sears exclusives.\n\nThe list contains 517 games, divided into three sections:\n\nGames published by Atari and Sears\n\nGames published by third parties\n\nHobbyist-developed games after the system was discontinued.\n\nThe console was released with nine cartridges: Air-Sea Battle, Basic Math, Blackjack, Combat, Indy 500, Star Ship, Street Racer, Surround and Video Olympics.\n\nThe final licensed Atari 2600 games released in North America were Ikari Warriors, MotoRodeo, Sentinel, and Xenophobe in early 1991,[1] and the final licensed games released in Europe were Klax and Acid Drop in 1990 and 1992 respectively.\n\nGames published by Atari and Sears\n\n[edit]\n\nAll 127 of the initial era of Atari 2600 games (between the console's launch in 1977 and the summer of 1980) were developed and manufactured by Atari, Inc. These games were published by Atari, and many were also licensed to Sears, which released these games under its Tele-Games brand, often with different titles.[2] Sears's Tele-Games brand was unrelated to the company Telegames, which also produced cartridges for the Atari 2600 (mostly re-issues of M Network games.)[3]\n\nThree games were also produced by Atari Inc. for Sears as exclusive releases under the Tele-Games brand: Steeplechase, Stellar Track, and Submarine Commander.[2]\n\nAtari title Sears title Designer or programmer Year\n\nNotes 32 in 1 - 1988 A multi-genre cartridge.
