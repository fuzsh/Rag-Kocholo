        "text": "Look! I’ts a topic! Let’s discuss all things about Atari!\n\nI can’t let @Sushi get away with his two threads about consoles that nobody knows. So here we can talk about the best console ever: The Atari VCS also known as the Atari 2600. Think about such beautiful games like E.T. Pac Man, Q*Bert, Circus Games, Pong or Demon Attack!\n\nAnd you can still play it on your computer!\n\nLet’s see if we can convert @Sushi to become a Atari boy after all\n\nThe only actual Atari I played myself was at the house of one of my mother´s patients. I also inherited his entire MOTU collection.\n\nI remember playing Asteroids, Donkey Kong and maybe a few others. I´m not sure if it was a 2600 or one of the later ones, though.\n\nThe weird thing is that I don´t remeber being put off by Donkey Kong not looking like an ape at all. I think I had known the game from the C64 version already by that time.\n\nPlaying Asteroids was fun, though. I was in no way put off by the simplicity of the system even though I was already used to the C64, the NES and the Arcade Cabinets in the restaurants.\n\nI used to love that game on NES. My memory could be distorted, but I seemed to remember it went back and forth as you climbed the ladders to the next platform. So left to right, then right to left, etc.\n\nI used to really like looking at the enlarged pixels on the box of that game. Then try to recreate it on my Etch-a-sketch Animator:"
