        "text": "I'm seeing the black, wood grain, 4 switch, 6 switch - so many different versions.\n\nWhat's the best version to buy?\n\nOr should I be looking at 5200s or 7800s? Were they backwards compatible?\n\nI briefly had a wood grain 2600 as a kid that I got new in 1983. My dad owned a 7-11 store in Los Angeles and they had some promotion that allowed him to get one free for me. I had it a short time and then lost track of what happened to the Atari systems. When I got back into console gaming, NES was king.\n\nSomeone school me.\n\natari\n\nIf you want the real classic, heavy duty unit find a 6 switch.\n\nI like the atari juniors (the small black ones)\n\n5200 are fun but not the same.\n\n7800s are fun and play most 2600 games and the controllers are pretty nice.\n\nAlso you may want to look at the video mods for the atari 2600s. They do make the picture a LOT better.\n\nI recently got back into Atari. I still have my original 4 switch woody 2600 I've had since it was new. It needed some repair and I fixed it mostly but the right joystick port wasn't perfect. I came across a great deal on ebay for a light sixer (six switch version) so I snatched that up. The big reason why the 6 switch is a better console to have is because the difficulty switches are the same metal large switches as the others and located on top. This makes changing them or visually checking to see their position so much easier. On the 4 switch models they are located on the back and are small slider switches which is a little cumbersome. Given that, my advice is to get a Heavy sixer if you can, and if not get a cheaper and easier to find light sixer. I also highly recommend the svideo mod from Electronicsentamentalities and the pause mode from AtariAge. I did both on mine and they are so worth it. The picture is light years better than the stock RF output.\n\nThanks guys - I ended up buying a modded 2600 4 switch woody with S-Video and RCA outs for audio on eBay. Can't wait to play it - will be hooking it up to a Sony PVM 19\".\n\nGood choice. There is an SD card cartridge out there and a lot of homebrew activity.\n\nA 7800 is fun, but the 2600 (aka VCS) is where it's at. I have both. The VCS gets more love. Also, the 5200 is a giant pile of crap. (IMO IMO IMO there are allegedly guys that like that machine) I owned one, restored it, restored the DOA controllers got it working 100%--and found it boring. Read the history of the 5200... it's quite fascinating. But the thing is a giant monolithic POC even today and is best viewed under glass and on display. If you play it you will just want to throw it away. But let me tell you how I really feel...\n\nAnyway, you may want to get a 7800 down the line but both the 5200/7800 libraries are heavily armed with classic titles from the arcade that are best played... as arcade games which is how I got into this damn hobby in the first place. The consoles never did the arcade games justice.\n\nI've only done brief research and couldn't find the answer to this: When they say the 7800 is \"backwards compatible\" what do they mean exactly. I mean obviously it can play 2600 games, but is it using the same chip as the 2600 to play those games? Is it emulation? Is it better than say a flashback? Anybody who has or can point to that info would be greatly appreciated.\n\nGet a 7800 they are backwards compatible with 2600 and there are a lot of great 7800 games especially the home brews you can get from the store at AtariAge.com"
