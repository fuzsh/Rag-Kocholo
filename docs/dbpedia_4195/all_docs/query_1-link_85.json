        "text": "I first owned an Atari 7800 after the system was already being soundly crushed by the NES and was therefore cheap. At the time I only had a couple of games for it and considered it a slightly souped-up 2600. That didn't stop me from amassing a decent collection years later. I also came across my second Atari 7800 while living in an apartment. I was taking out the trash and another tenant who was moving out felt kind enough to leave the system and games stacked outside the dumpster. I wish I could say that was the first dumpster system I owned.\n\nIt's an inexpensive retro system to buy games for thanks to unpopularity and overproduction. Most of my collection came from a dollar store in 1992. They had new Atari 7800 games stacked about 20 feet high. Recently I went on a binge where I finally started playing some of these games, I know what a crazy idea. I found the games were quite a bit better than I remembered, especially the arcade games. It got me thinking that maybe, for certain games, the Atari 7800 could challenge the NES for 8-bit supremacy.\n\nThe key word there is \"certain\". The Atari 7800 library never came close to having a Metroid, Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, or Super Mario Bros. quality game. It did really well in the arcade conversion department though so that's where we'll make these two systems face off.\n\nAt the end of the day though, this is a just an attempt to get some cheap hits for my site. For whatever reason the Sega Master System vs. NES grudge match I did generates a bunch of traffic so I figure people must really like looking at side-by-side comparisons of games. I know I do at least. Of course, I don't run ads on this site so I don't know why I care if anyone visits? I should definitely get my head checked out sometime.\n\nAnd the winner is..\n\nI have the final score at 5-10 in favor of the NES. It could just as easily be 6-9 though I'm still not fully committed to the Joust decision. Dig Dug and Xenophobe are close too so if someone else scored this 7-8 I wouldn't argue. There's no easy path to victory for the 7800 as 6 games (DK, DK Jr, Mario Bros, Double Dragon, Rampage, Ikari Warriors) are completely lop-sided.\n\nHowever it's scored, this is a strong showing for the 7800. This re-affirmed to me that it was a great console for arcade ports. That's not a bad legacy for the system, I feel the same way about the 32X and Saturn. This is all without including arcade ports like Food Fight that didn't have an NES equivalent. An overall \"which system is better for arcade ports\" battle could easily go to the 7800 when all the Atari games not released on the NES are included.\n\nI know this is going to sound weird, but if you want to have an authentic '80s gaming experience you don't play arcade ROMZ - you play arcade ports because far more hours of gaming went into them. Sure, everyone played a net hour or two of Pac Man in the arcade. But everyone, I mean everyone, played 40+ hours of a home version. That's why arcade ports fascinate me. This is what people put far more time into.\n\nSo this was fun. I don't know if I'll do another of these anytime soon. On the last one of these I did I said Turbografx-16 CD vs Sega CD would be next. Let's just say I started on it and ran into some issues. I don't know what's next or when but I doubt this will be the last installment of Grudge Match.\n\nRelated\n\nAll source code and software on this site is distributed under The MIT License (copyright 2000-2024 Hugues Johnson) unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll other content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll opinions on this site reflect my personal views and do not represent views of my current, or any former, employer.\n\nSite theme is based on Bootstrap licensed under The MIT License.
