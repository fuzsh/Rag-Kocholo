Main building 1196 Borregas Ave. In this Atari Corp. building was Atari Purchasing, Engineering, Engineering Prototype lab, Sales, Accounting, Marketing, Legal and other Atari departments.\n\nAdam P. of of WI \"I just wanted to say thanks for the quick email replies and the great service. I was very surprised when I received what I ordered from you 2 days after I ordered it. The composite video mod works great! It's a world of difference compared to the RF video/audio.\" Adam ordered one of Bests 7800 Composite Video Upgrade Kits. \"If I ever need anything else Atari related, you can be sure I'll come to you first. Thanks again!\"\n\nIn the Atari Engineering section we came across a single Modified US Atari 7800 console. It got put into a box and stored onto one of the thousands and thousands of Pallets of Atari goods we put into our San Jose Warehouse over the years. We recently finally broke down one of those Pallets of Atari items from the Atari Corp building and again found the Engineering 7800 console. To us this 7800 looked like an Atari Engineers modified 7800 with a Composite Video mod installed console. This Modified stock Atari 7800 motherboard had two Engineering mods installed. The 7800 Composite Video Mod and the Euro 7800 Operating Chip mod upgrades. See the past this Composite Video Upgrade for more information on this second 7800 OS Chip mod.\n\nBest Electronics has Engineered two upgrades to the Atari Engineers original Composite Video design by enhancing the Video display with a sharper Composite Video Display with improved color display and color saturation. The Best second 7800 CV upgrade to the original design, is for the 7800 Game Cartridges that have a Pokey sound chip within the game cartridge. This Pokey 7800 game cartridge based sound output was missing from the original Atari Engineers CV design.\n\nThis 7800 Composite Video mod is relative easy mod to do. It requires, removing (unsoldering the internal 7800 RF Modulator), removing some 7800 motherboard components, adding some new components, cutting and lifting up some soldered in 7800 motherboard components. But there are no permanent 7800 Motherboard trace cuts or modifications to the 7800 motherboard which can not be reversed should this composite video Mod not work for you. Compared to other more expensive 7800 Composite video upgrades, the Atari Engineering version does not require any cutting, drilling, or modifying of the Atari 7800 top or bottom plastic cases. Because you will remove the Atari 7800 internal RF Modulator in this 7800 upgrade, you will no longer be able to connect up your Atari 7800 to your TV thru the normal RF cable to the rear Coax TV input / TV Switch box.\n\n7800 Upgrade requirements\n\nGeneral Electronics Skill level of this 7800 Composite Video mod is a 3 to 4 range out of 1 (Never picked up a soldering Iron) to 10 Electronics expert. The hardest part of this 7800 Composite upgrade is having the proper skill level and tools to unsolder and remove the Atari 7800 Internal RF Modulator without damaging the 7800 Motherboard Traces.\n\nAtari made several different versions of the Atari 7800 motherboards of the production life of the 7800 consoles.\n\nUS Atari 7800 Motherboard component layout\n\nThis Atari Engineering 7800 Composite Video mod is based on the US 7800 Motherboard PCB part number CO25233-XXX / CA025234 which was used in the bulk of the US 7800 console production run. It has not been tested or installed on the PAL / Euro version Atari 7800 Motherboard PCB numbers CO70856 Rev. X and C300633-XXX\n\nThe quick way you can tell you if you have the US 7800 Motherboard, check to the left of the Atari 7800 right angle Power jack on the Atari 7800 Motherboard. If you find a MJE 210 Transistor next to the 7800 Power Jack, you have a US 7800 motherboard.\n\nItems required for this 7800 Composite Video Modification.\n\nGeneral Soldering: 25 Watt Soldering Iron\n\nRF Modulator Unsoldering: 35 Watt Soldering Iron\n\nSolder\n\nNeedle Nose Pliers\n\nSmall pair of Diagonal cutters\n\nFlat blade Screwdriver\n\nA good Solder Sucker or a lot of Solder Wick\n\nThe abilty to follow written installation instructions with pictures.\n\nThis upgrade is so simple no schematics / prints are supplied. You should be able to solder and unsolder, read Resistor color codes and read the silk screen component locations on the Atari 7800 Motherboard\n\nAbout 1 to 2 hours installation time.\n\nItems Supplied with the Best 7800 Composite Video Modification\n\nA 12 page written set of Installation instructions with 10 color pictures\n\nAll Electronic Components required for this 7800 Composite Video Mod.\n\nSet of 6ft Composite Video and Audio cables with Gold Plated connects modified for installation onto the 7800 motherboard\n\n1 Plastic tie wrap (to strap down/strain relief) the Composite video cables to the 7800 Motherboard.\n\nA New set of 7800 Case shorter screws.\n\nBest 7800 Composite Video Upgrade Kit CB103130 $20.00\n\nBest Atari 7800 Tech tip: If you are considering doing this 7800 Composite Video mod or Euro 7800 OS Upgrade, you should also consider ordering at least two new replacement 7800 On/Off and Game Start/Reset switches ($1.50 each). On all Atari 7800 consoles made, the 7800 switches have a Very high failure rate and should automatically be replaced if you go inside your 7800 console. The cheaper made switches used on most 7800 Motherboards are basically ticking time booms. Because of these poor designed push button switches, when the 7800 motherboards were wave soldered, all of the acids, rosins and chemicals (all heated to very high melting / flash points) used during the wave solder process (normally chemically washed off the bottom of the 7800 PCB boards in a down line wave solder process), leaked into each 7800 switch thru small openings in the bottom of the 7800 switches. With enough time (10 to 15 years after the 7800 motherboards were 1st produced) the all of the 7800 internal switch contacts have been damaged or corroded internally. An old Atari 7800 PCB switch may look new on the outside of the switch, but inside because of the left over chemicals and acids are just ticking time booms that will all 100% fail.\n\nThe New Atari 7800 switches we have in stock are the better Japanese made Alps brand switches. Just about all of the 7800 Motherboards made use Taiwan or China made cheaper 7800 push button switches.\n\nAtari 7800 console rubber foot set (4) CB103158 $1.50\n\nJames A. of CO \"The European chip mod I bought for the 7800 last time was a great project, by the way.\" James upgraded his Atari US / NTSC 7800 with Best 7800 EURO Upgrade Kit below. This Best Upgrade kit replaces the stock Atari 7800 OS ROM with the upgraded Atari Engineering 7800 Euro version. This 7800 Upgrade ROM removes the normal Atari 7800 delay Color Rainbow window and allows any 7800 game to instantly boot up / play. It also installs a complete internal Atari 7800 Asteroids Game as the default game when no 2600 or 7800 game cartridge is installed in the 7800 console.\n\nAaron L. of TX Aaron wanted work on this ailing Atari 7800 console. So he ordered from Best Electronics, New Atari 7800 replacement switches, Bests 7800 Composite Video upgrade Kit and Bests 7800 Euro OS upgrade Kit. The new 7800 switches made Aaron's hard to turn on old 7800 console, act like it was brand new 7800 again. The second 7800 upgrade Aaron did, the Best 7800 Composite Video mod went very well for Aaron and he was very happy with the 1st two 7800 upgrades he did. But Aaron run into a problem with the 3rd 7800 Euro OS upgrade he was trying to install on his 7800 console. Several Atari Information tips and Atari trouble shooting tips and E-Mails from our Atari 30+ Super Tech:\n\nAtari Engineering 7800 Euro Operating System Upgrade Mod for US 7800 Consoles!\n\nGeneral Information\n\nAtari Engineering released two versions of the Atari 7800 Operating System chips. The US version has the known 7800 boot up / delay screen with the Atari Logo / color bars, before the inserted Atari 7800 game cartridge screen appears. The Euro 7800 OS chip / 7800 Euro Consoles have a build in Atari 7800 Asteroids game (turn on your 7800 with no game cartridge inserted and 7800 Asteroids would be the default game) and will instantly start any 7800 game (no more Atari 7800 Logo delay screen) when a 7800 game cartridge was installed. Both versions of the Atari 7800 OS chips both instantly start up all 2600 Game Cartridges. This Atari Euro 7800 upgrade chip will also allow you to play more of the Atari 7800 PAL Games that will not normally / properly run on the NTSC / US version Atari 7800 consoles. Some Atari 7800 PAL Games require a PAL 7800 MARIA chip and will not run on a US 7800 motherboard modified with the Best 7800 OS EURO upgrade.\n\nWhen Best Electronics cleared out Atari Engineering department we found several Atari Engineering samples of US 7800 consoles modified with a Universal PAL / US upgrade version 7800 OS chip. This Atari Engineering Enhanced / Hybrid / Universal Atari 7800 OS Upgrade chip can be installed in any US / NTSC 7800 console and will give you the same above upgraded features as Atari Euro version 7800 consoles produced. To Install / Upgrade in a US 7800 console, requires some soldering, additional I.C. chip, trace cutting and an extra wire jumper added to a US 7800 Motherboard.\n\n7800 Upgrade requirements\n\nGeneral Electronics Skill level of this 7800 Composite Video mod is a 2 to 3 range out of 1 (Never picked up a soldering Iron) to 10 Electronics expert. You should have the abilty to follow written instructions, cut a 7800 motherboard trace, Solder, Unsolder components and piggy back an I.C. on top of another.\n\nItems required for this 7800 Euro Operating Modification\n\nGeneral Soldering: 25 Watt Soldering Iron\n\nSolder\n\nNeedle Nose Pliers\n\nXacto knife\n\nSmall pair of Diagonal cutters\n\nVOM Meter\n\nPhillips Screwdriver\n\nA good Solder Sucker or a lot of Solder Wick\n\nThe abilty to follow written installation instructions\n\nThe ability to read chip pin numbers\n\nThis upgrade is so simple no schematics / prints are supplied.\n\nAbout 1/2 to 1 hour installation time.\n\nItems Supplied with the Best 7800 OS Upgrade Modification\n\n8 page Installation Instructions with 9 color photos\n\nNew 7800 OS chip\n\nJumper wire\n\nNew 7800 28 pin OS I.C.
