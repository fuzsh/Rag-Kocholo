        "text": "If you’re a fan of retro gaming, you might have heard of the Atari 2600+, a modern day faithful recreation of the classic console that was released in November 20231. Well, I’m here to tell you my story of how I got one, and how I discovered a hidden feature that made me feel like a kid again.\n\nA little background\n\nIt all started back in October, or maybe even late September, when I received an e-mail from Amazon saying that I could pre-order the Atari 2600+ for $129.99, and that it would arrive in January. I was intrigued by the idea of playing my old Atari 2600 cartridges on a new system that had HDMI output, widescreen mode, and a light-up Atari logo. So I placed the pre-order without hesitation, and then forgot about it, thinking I had plenty of time before I would see it.\n\nFast forward to December, and I got a notification that my Atari 2600+ had shipped and was on its way. I was excited, but also a bit nervous. Would it live up to my expectations? Would it work with my old cartridges? Would it look good on my HD TV? I decided to record a video of me unboxing and testing the system, so I could share my genuine reactions with you, my loyal readers and viewers.\n\nWhen the package arrived, I was impressed by how faithful the Atari 2600+ looked to the original console. It had the same fake wood grain, the same four switches (though I kinda hoped they would have gone with the Heavy-Sixer look), and even the same cartridge slot... It also came with a CX40+ Joystick controller and a 10-in-1 game cartridge that featured some of Atari’s most famous games, like Adventure, Combat, and Missile Command2.\n\nI plugged the system into my TV using the HDMI cable and the USB power adapter that were included in the box. I turned on the power switch, and the Atari logo lit up with a barely noticeable glow. I inserted the 10-in-1 cartridge, and selected Adventure from the menu. The game loaded instantly, and I was greeted by the familiar sound of the dragon roaring. I moved the joystick, and the square-shaped hero moved across the screen. It looked crisp and clear, and the colors were vibrant. I felt a wave of nostalgia wash over me.\n\nI played Adventure for a while, exploring the mazes, finding the keys, and avoiding the dragons. I also tried some of the other games on the cartridge, like Dodge ‘Em, Haunted House, and Yars’ Revenge. They all played smoothly and flawlessly, just like I remembered. I was having a blast.\n\nMy “realization”\n\nBut then, I noticed something while I was looking at the guts of the console. There were 4 extra contacts for the cartridges. That was definitely an Atari 7800 cartridge slot. I was puzzled. What did that mean? I looked at the box, and the manual, and the Amazon listing. None of them mentioned anything about the Atari 7800. Was this a secret feature? A hidden bonus? A mistake?\n\nI decided to find out. I grabbed one of my old Atari 7800 cartridges, Pole Position II, and inserted it into the console. I flipped the power switch. To my surprise and delight, the game booted up, and I saw the familiar title screen. I couldn’t believe it. The Atari 2600+ was compatible with the Atari 7800 games as well!\n\nI was overjoyed. I had no idea that this was possible. I had just doubled the library of games that I could play on the system. As I was trying to capture my honest reactions, I kept the footage, and posted the video.\n\nReading the comments…\n\nWithin an hour, someone had commented that it was an advertised feature. I quickly grabbed my phone and searched for more information about this feature. I found out that it was announced on the Atari website, but not on the Amazon listing, and that it was one of the enhancements that the Atari 2600+ had over the original console. I felt silly for not checking the Atari website before, but I also felt lucky for discovering this feature by accident.\n\nIt didn’t really matter to me once it was pointed out. You got my full and true reaction based on the information I had at the time. Call it willful ignorance if you want, but it brought some pure joy to my life!\n\nI wanted to play Pole Position II right away, but there was one problem. I didn’t have any working Atari 7800 controllers. The CX40+ Joystick controller that came with the system was only compatible with the Atari 2600 games. I needed a different controller for the Atari 7800 games, one that had two buttons and a directional pad. I searched online, and found out that these controllers were hard to find, and expensive to buy. I was disappointed, but not discouraged. I decided to make it my mission to find some working Atari 7800 controllers, so I could play all the games that I wanted on the Atari 2600+.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how I became an Atari 2600+ fan. I think this system is a great way to enjoy the classic games from the past, with a modern twist. It’s easy to set up, fun to play, and full of surprises. If you’re a retro gamer, or just curious about the history of gaming, I highly recommend getting one. You won’t regret it.\n\nBut don’t take my word for it. Watch my video below, where I show you the unboxing, the testing, and the discovery of the Atari 7800 compatibility. See for yourself how awesome the Atari 2600+ is, and how excited I was to find out about it. And if you have any tips on where to find some Atari 7800 controllers, please let me know in the comments. I’m still looking for them."
