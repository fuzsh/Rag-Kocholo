        "text": "Syd Bolton runs a PC museum in Canada and has a huge video game collection with more than 6,000 games. The museum has thousand of boxed PC games and dozens of computers covering the whole history of PC's. I had a chance to interview Syd about his museum and get some photos of the collection as well.\n\nXbox and Xbox 360 games. All complete with box and instructions.\n\nA Vectrex System with tons of vintage games behind it.\n\nArcade games in the tiny cabinets\n\nTons of Playstation 2 games.\n\nVideo game memorabilia and signed pictures of a couple G4 hosts\n\nThank you Syd for answering these questions for us about your video game collection and Personal Computer Museum.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nI live in Brantford, Ontario, Canada and have all my life. Brantford was a\n\nprimary home to Alexendar Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone and\n\nhome to the first long distance phone call (between Brantford, Ontario and\n\nParis, Ontario, only a few miles away).\n\nHow did you get into video game collecting?\n\nGrowing up I bought myself a computer because I knew I could play games on\n\nit AND learn programming. However, a buddy of mine had an Atari 2600 and I\n\nwill admit I was jealous. I loved going over to his place to play Pitfall!\n\nand some of the other great classics. In time, I started collecting\n\ncomputers and because people thought I was into \"that sort of thing\" one day\n\nsomebody brought me an Atari 2600 with 20 games for $20. At first, I'm\n\nthinking \"what the heck do I want this for?\" but as soon as I saw Pitfall!,\n\nthe good memories started flooding back. I said \"Yes, I want this!\" and\n\npicked it up. I realized I could amass a pretty good collection quickly and\n\ninexpensively by placing ads in local newspapers as \"Wanted to buy: video\n\ngame systems\". I just got hooked on it and then wanted everything because I\n\ncan't just seem to do something part way. It's my greatest strength and\n\nweakness. I think my collections could be stronger on more rare titles if it\n\nwasn't for the fact that I focus on \"anything I don't have\". Most collectors\n\nconcentrate on one or a few systems. With me, I have weeks or months (or\n\nyears) where I focus on one but then my attention shifts.\n\nHow many games do you own? How many systems?\n\nIt's a bit of a tough question. I know I have over 6,000 console games but\n\nI'm still in the process of cataloging all of them. When it comes to\n\noriginal, boxed computer software games I'd have to estimate several\n\nthousand. With systems, I basically own the majority of consoles released in\n\nNorth America. I have the early originals like the Magnavox Odyssey 1, the\n\nFairchild Channel F and of course multiple variants of the Atari 2600. In\n\naddition to all the \"standard\" consoles I've also got some odder items like\n\nthe Amiga CD32 (and CDTV), the Leisure Vision (a version of the Arcadia\n\n2001) and even a Tandyvision One (Intellivision compatible).\n\nWhat are your favorite items in your collection?\n\nLately my Pac-Man table has been the coolest and favorite thing but it's\n\nvery difficult to choose. Sometimes the favorite things are the ones that\n\npeople find interesting like the mini arcade games I have (the Frogger and\n\nPac-Man ones for example) and I have a very extensive Dragon's Lair\n\ncollection that I'm proud of. My PS2 collection, which currently has over\n\n1222 individual titles in it is the proudest thing I have.\n\nTell me more about the video game and personal computer museum you run?\n\nSo I started collecting computers when I was 12 -- which was just over 25\n\nyears ago. I had 3 of them, which for the time was pretty unusual (I had a\n\nVIC-20, a Commodore 64 and an Apple II clone that I built myself). I really\n\ndidn't have any gaming systems until I turned 16, when someone offered me an\n\nAtari 2600 for $20 with a bunch of games. At first, I was like \"why the heck\n\nwould I want this? It's old now and crappy\" but then I saw Pitfall! sitting\n\nthere. I remembered loving going over to my buddy's house and playing his\n\n2600 (he had everything back then, it seemed). I had opted on getting a\n\ncomputer instead of Atari because I could play games AND learn how to\n\nprogram. Turns out I made the right decision, as I am still programming\n\ntoday and make my living from it.\n\nAre most items part of your personal collection or the museum collection?\n\nAll of the computers and software that started out as mine are now the\n\nproperty of the museum. It's too difficult to separate what was mine versus\n\nall of the generous donations we've received over the years. The video\n\ngames, however, are all mine. However, I am going to loan them to the museum\n\nwhen we get a bigger building and have the space to display everything. That\n\nis the main focus right now, getting consistent funding and a larger\n\nfacility.\n\nWhat is the most expensive game you own?\n\nWell you know that Steel Battalion for the Xbox is up there but the value of\n\nsome of the others I'm not too sure of. I never really worried about getting\n\nsome of the more super expensive individual titles because I would rather\n\nspend the money on building a broader collection overall. I have a ton of\n\nPS2 RPG's that I know will grow in value over time so that is probably my\n\nmost expensive area of collecting.\n\nWhat is the most rare game you own?\n\nAgain, defining rare is tough here. I have several Atari 2600 games that I\n\ntreasure for their difficulty in obtaining like Chase the Chuckwagon, Condor\n\nAttack and Gas Hog. But when showing my collection to the average person,\n\nI'm going to point out things like my shrink-wrapped Pitfall! for the 2600\n\nand sealed Pac-Man because it's something they might actually recognize.\n\nNewer games that I'm proud to own that are getting really hard to find\n\ninclude Marvel vs. Capcom 2 (both Xbox and PS2) but I also know that rare\n\ndoesn't necessarily mean valuable.\n\nWhy start a gaming museum?\n\nGaming is one of those areas where most people play a game and then get rid\n\nof it at some point. To be able to go back and look at that game, even just\n\nthe box cover and hold that in your hands, brings back a flood of positive\n\nmemories for people. It's this sense of joy, that I see all the time in\n\npeople that is the primary reason for doing this. It was much more difficult\n\nand much more expensive to game in the \"early days\" and so people spent more\n\ntime on it, they received more joy from it (even when the games weren't\n\nnearly as good as some are today). It's that personal sense of\n\naccomplishment that people have and love revisiting years later that makes\n\nthe difference. It's also important, from an educational standpoint, to\n\npreserve this stuff. Companies that have come and gone and the people behind\n\nthem all deserve to be remembered for their contributions.\n\nHow much have you spent over the years on your collection?\n\nThat's a tough one because I didn't really keep track of it before like I do\n\nnow. Clearly, it's a small fortune. I would say more than $100k and less\n\nthan $250k? I'm a fairly frugal shopper when it comes to games (one has to\n\nbe). I don't like buying used on the newer stuff because I know it hurts the\n\nindustry, so when it's a big game title that I know I will play right away\n\nI'll buy it new to support the developers and publishers. Obviously, on\n\nolder stuff I don't have a choice but to buy used or trade.\n\nWhat do you want to add to your collection but haven't been able to find?\n\nObviously I'd love to get a hold of Panzer Dragoon Saga on the Saturn. I\n\ncertainly have had the opportunity, I just have a hard time spending that\n\nmuch on one game when I know I can get an armload of other games for the\n\nsame money (the biggest problem with being an 'everything' collector). On\n\nthe Playstation, I'd love to get my hands on Suikoden II and Tactics Ogre.\n\nAnd of course, on the older stuff, Bounty Bob on the Atari 5200 would be a\n\nmust have because I also love that game!\n\nAny interesting stories about how you got some items in the collection?\n\nSeveral years ago, I printed out a Nintendo NES rarity list and noticed these \"Aladdin\" game carts were on it. This was when the web was still\n\nfairly new and eBay was not a strong place to sell goods (around 1995 I\n\nthink). I had never seen one of these carts before but noted the \"ER+\"\n\nrating in the list. I went to a flea market type place about an hour's drive\n\nfrom my home. I walked into this one area where this guy had a bunch of\n\nvideo games and I was not sure what these were--turns out they were boxed\n\nAladdin carts. They had a price of $10 each. I asked for the manager,\n\nbecause once I realized what they were I was going to try and make a deal.\n\nThey said he was back the following weekend. So, I bought a set of what I\n\ncould find, at $10 each (there were the six separate games) and went home.\n\nThe following weekend I came back and found the owner and asked him if I\n\nbought every single one of those games he had - how much they would be. He\n\nhummed and hawed and said \"Well...umm...listen, I gotta get at least three\n\nbucks for each of them\". Putting on my best poker face, I sighed and said\n\n\"that's ok I guess\". Meanwhile, I'm jumping up and down on the inside. Keep\n\nin mind - this was also in Canadian funds! Even better, as we were packing\n\nup the games he comes from out back and says \"Oh, I found some more!\" and I\n\nsee over ten sets of the Aladdin cartridge itself with the pack-in game.\n\nTrying to hide my excitement, I asked how much for those. \"Oh, same price!\".\n\nAll told, I ended up walking away with over 15 complete sets of Aladdin\n\ndecks with the seven games. I kept two sets for myself and sold the rest for\n\n$125 US a set. Being fair of course. Later, with the extras I had of the\n\nsingle games I managed to sell some for as much as $45 each on eBay once it\n\nbecame more popular. I am not sure how much of my game collection that\n\ntransaction financed, but I can tell you that it was one of the best scores\n\nI've had in collecting.\n\nThank you Syd. If I'm ever up in Canada again, I will be sure to stop by and see your museum and personal collection. The museum is open to the public too so anyone else can see this collection too, be sure to look up the visiting hours though first because they change frequently."
