The Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply the Atari 7800, is a video game console re-released by Atari Corporation in January 1986. The original release had occurred two years earlier under Atari Inc. The 7800 had originally been designed to replace Atari Inc.'s Atari 5200 in 1984, but was temporarily shelved due to the sale of the company after the video game crash.

In January 1986, the 7800 was again released and would compete that year with the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Master System. It had simple digital joysticks; it was almost fully backward-compatible with the Atari 2600; and it was considered affordable at a price of US$140.

Physically it continues in the same style as the Atari 2600 Jr, and has only an RF out for connecting to a TV, there are two controller ports, and expansion port, cartridge slot.

The machine had much improved graphics capabilities over its predecessors, but used the same soundchip as the 2600.

The software library was not extensive and contained updated versions of such Atari classics such as Ms Pacman, Food Fight and Pole Position, as well as home micro classics like Rescue on Fractalus and Ballblazer.

The machine could not compete in sales terms with Nintendo and Sega in the US, but still sold well in its own right. In the UK it was sold for many years in Toys'r'Us and Argos at around the Â£80 mark.
