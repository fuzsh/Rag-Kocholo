Atari 7800

The Atari 7800 (a.k.a. ProSystem) is a home videogame console developed by Atari. It was released in 1986. It is the successor to both the Atari 2600 and 5200.

It was capable of running Atari 2600 games, making it the first backwards compatible home console.

In an attempt to curb the flood of low-quality games that caused the NA videogame crash previously, the cartridges had to be digitally signed by Atari to function on the console.
