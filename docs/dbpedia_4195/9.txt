Atari Joypad

Similar to an NES controller, this Atari-made gamepad was the pack-in for the 7800 when it was sold in Europe. Although rare in the US, they are not hard to find in Europe. However, they were sold separately in very small quantities in their own box, and this is very hard to find.

Most pics I find of the Atari 7800 console I have on this theme is with that one. I have the one you mentioned thou.
