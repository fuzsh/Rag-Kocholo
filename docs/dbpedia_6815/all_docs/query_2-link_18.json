        "text": "The Spring Forward Trash Challenge - 31/93 - 78. A movie that features someone who has passed away\n\nIronically, perhaps, this long-thought-lost film has been resurrected, and a nice digi-print screened today at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival (who supported the restoration of the Italian print found by the Cineteca Milano - ace accompanists Stephen Horne and Frank Bockius were on hand to provide a fleet, oneiric, and whimsical score). It's an event even for cinephiles who don't enjoy old dark house mysteries, though for us the thing is a godsend.\n\nI mean okay, the title menace is a gorilla so the main flavor of it is gonna be weird. And things lean toward wacky about halfway through when…\n\nThat gorilla is so cute I love him. The print was sourced from Italy so the intertitles are in Italian. The all-caps title card at the front portending IL GORILLA got the audience on board from the jump. I wish Alice was more of an entity (not the least of which because it’s a dude bonanza) — when the big G finally carries the fainted lady, he walks around the room for a while as if unsure what to do, before placing her gingerly on the bed and going on his way. “I refuse to play to your expectations of my species,” says Il Gorilla, which made it seem like an in-joke ahead of the fact. Fortunately, our expectations would be favored…\n\nA comedy mystery silent film, long considered lost, now shown in pristine 2k. CineCitta did a lovely restoration job on this, allowing the audience to appreciate this silly romp with a surprisingly sharp and striking visual flair, full of gothic ambience and Hitchcock-like camera movements and angles. Early in the film, we see an iconic image of a murderous gorilla’s shadow being cast over an entire miniature cityscape, a model so art-deco and expressionistic, it almost reminds you of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. The film is full of funny, striking contrasting shots like that. Shots that are both silly but also surprisingly cinematic. I was also impressed by how much detail went into the gorilla suit itself. A lot of care…"
