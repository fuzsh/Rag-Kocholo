        "text": "Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nVisit the prediction pages for the respective ceremonies via the links below:\n\nOSCARS | EMMYS | GRAMMYS | TONYS\n\nWeekly Commentary (Updated Aug. 7, 2024): The early buzz for possible awards contenders is beginning to heat up, with Telluride, Venice, and Toronto on the horizon.\n\nTelluride is sure to bring major awards hopefuls. One of the significant entries is Focus Features’ thriller “Conclave” (a Canadian premiere at TIFF), directed by Edward Berger (“All Quiet on the Western Front”). Amazon MGM’s “Nickel Boys,” an adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s acclaimed novel by writer and director RaMell Ross, is also expected to have its world premiere in Colorado.\n\nNetflix has at least two presumed awards juggernauts that will excite attendees: “The Piano Lesson,” the latest adaptation of the August Wilson play from debut director Malcolm Washington and starring John David Washington, Samuel L. Jackson and Danielle Deadwyler. Moreover, “Emilia Pérez,” by legendary auteur Jacques Audiard, winner of the best actress Cannes prize for its four stars Karla Sofía Gascón, Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez, and Adriana Paz.\n\nThis week’s projection updates include a first look at the best supporting actor race, which features overdue veterans such as Samuel L. Jackson (“The Piano Lesson”), Edward Norton (“A Complete Unknown”), and Stanley Tucci (“Conclave”).\n\nPlease remember, all this conjecture is early, so we remain open and await more movies to drop during the awards circuit. The race is only beginning.\n\nTop 3 projected nominated leaders (films): “Emilia Pérez” (11); “A Complete Unknown” and “Gladiator II” (10); “Blitz,” “Dune: Part Two” and “Joker: Folie à Deux” (7)\n\nTop 3 projected nominated leaders (studios): Netflix (19); Warner Bros. (16); Searchlight Pictures (11)\n\nThe 97th Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 2. All movie listings, titles, distributors, and credited artisans are not final and are subject to change."
