        "text": "Tom sadly died aged 33\n\nA week after Tom Parker was laid to rest at his memorial service, his widow Kelsey Parker has taken to social media to share a heartbreaking poem about grief.\n\nMum-of-two Kelsey, who married The Wanted singer Tom back in 2018, shared words from Donna Ashworth's poem titled 'I Wish I Knew', as she tries to come to terms with the devastating loss.\n\nThe poem read: 'Grief may feel like the dying of the soul while the body still lives, but you are alive my friend.\n\n'And they are not, nor do they want you to be with them just yet. They very much want you to live.\n\n'Do not fear the grief you feel, it‚Äôs just love thrashing around, looking for somewhere to go. So give it somewhere to go.'\n\nAfter losing his battle with a brain tumour, Kelsey announced the devastating news of Tom's passing on Wednesday 30th March, writing online: 'It is with the heaviest of hearts that we confirm Tom passed away peacefully earlier today with all of his family by his side. Our hearts are broken, Tom was the centre of our world and we can‚Äôt imagine life without his infectious smile and energetic presence. We are truly thankful for the outpouring of love and support and ask that we all unite to ensure Tom‚Äôs light continues to shine for his beautiful children. Thank you to everyone who has supported in his care throughout, he fought until the very end. I‚Äôm forever proud of you ‚ù§Ô∏èüí´‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è'. (sic)\n\nThe 33-year-old later set up a GoFundMe page in memory of Tom, in order to raise money for charities close to Tom's heart, which has since hit nearly ¬£65,000.\n\nTom's friends and family attended his memorial service in Petts Wood, Kent last week, where fans lined the streets to pay their respects and watch the service on the big screen, after being encouraged to attend by Kelsey.\n\nRemembering the famous faces who've sadly died in 2022:\n\nTom's The Wanted band mates Max George, Siva Kaneswaran, Nathan Sykes and Jay McGuiness have since announced they are releasing an acoustic version of the band's track 'Gold Forever', which was played at his memorial service.\n\nThe boys told fans: 'We created a very special acoustic version of Gold Forever to be played at Tom‚Äôs memorial service. The reaction to the song was beautiful. We have decided to release the song publicly with ALL proceeds going to @thebraintumourcharity Download link is in our bio üôè‚ù§Ô∏è'.\n\nAll proceeds from the single will go to The Brain Tumour Charity.\n\nOur thoughts are with Tom's family and friends at this sad time.‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nNow read:\n\nThe Wanted release a special acoustic version of 'Gold Forever' played at Tom Parker's memorial service\n\nEverything you wanted to know about The Wanted\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
