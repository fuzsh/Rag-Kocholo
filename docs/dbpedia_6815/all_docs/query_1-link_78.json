As the law now stands it is expressly provided under bill of the Senate Finance Committee under- sub-division (c) of Section 9 of the Act of last SeptemThe takes to alter the present method so that instead of collecting the tax at the source of the income there will be substituted the requirement of supplying (to the Government) information at the source. The effect would be, in the great majority of cases, payment income from the corporations issuing the bonds to the individual owning them, and thus to deprive investors, who have bought bonds containing the so-called tax-free covenant for the express purpose of securing immunity from the income tax, of the benefits which the tax-free covenant was intended to confer. The Federal income tax, as we now know it in this country, is of very recent origin dating only from 1913 but for a score of years before that attempts had been made to levy such a tax, and before the adoption of the income tax amendment to the United States Constitution endowing Congress with specific authority to levy an income tax. Congress had been balked at least once in the attempt to impose the in buying corporate therefore, Investors, tax. to shift the of — — bonds, sought to secure protection against the possibility of Congress sooner or later being legally enCorporations on their titled to impose the tax. part sought to make their new bond issues attractive in the eyes of investors by inserting the tax-free covenant that is, by covenanting to assume any tax of that kind.

The language of the tax-free covenant in the case of the bond issues of all the more prominent corporWe may take for illusations is closely identical. tration the covenant as expressed in the general mortgage 4s of the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railway. These bonds were issued in 1895, at the very time when the need of a tax-exemption feature had been pressed upon public notice through the attempt to carry into effect an income tax provision under the Tariff Act of 1894. The language of the — as follows: \"Both the principal bond are payable without deducand tion for any tax or taxes which the Railway Company may be required to pay, or to retain therefrom, by any present or future law of the United States or of any State or Territory thereof, the Railway Company hereby agreeing to pay such tax or taxes.\" In Atchison bonds is interest of this to be found in all the large railroad mortgages, with few exceptions, substance, a similar covenant is put out between 1894 or 1895 and the time in 1913 when Congress enacted an income tax law under the new Income Tax Amendment to the Federal Con- stitution. Study of the language here quoted will make it evident why it makes a big difference whether in levying an income tax the law makes it incumbent upon the corporation to pay the tax by collecting at the source of the income, or^merely requires informa- ber that the amount of the normal tax \"shall be withheld * * * * from income de- and rived from interest upon bonds and mortgages or deducted deeds of trust or other similar obligations of corporations,\" no matter what the amount of the interest, be it large or small. The bill of the Senate Finance Committee would change this, and collect, not from the company, but from the owner. On the other hand, the company would still be required to withhold the amount of the tax in cases where the interest is paid to non-resident aliens, the reason for the distinction obviously being that these non-residents, being outside of the country, cannot be reached by our Government after the money has once been paid over to them. It does not seem right that there should be discrimination between the foreign owner and the American owner by giving to one the benefit of the tax-free covenant and denying it to the other. Nor does it appear altogether square for Congress to make itself a party to legislation which would in effect nullify the tax-free covenant as far as any class of owners is concerned. Of course, the tax is becoming increasingly burdensome to the corporations. At first only 1%, it was last September doubled, and made 2%, and now it is again to be doubled and made 4%. Should the war last much longer it is conceivable that it may again be doubled, and then doubled once more. But while this makes the burden heavier and still heavier, and in the case of the railroads, at least, almost insufferable, the converse is also true that is to say, the importance and value of the tax-free covenant to the bond owner for the same reason correspondingly increases, rendering all the stronger the argument that Congress having once provided for a certain method of collecting on the income derived from corporate bonds, should not now alter the method and disturb the equities as between the two parties to the agreement. There is much force in the contention of the Investment Bankers' Association (we print the resolutions on the subject adopted by the Board of Governors of the Association on page 336 of the current issue of this publication) that the action contemplated, if persisted in, \"will discredit corporate securities in the eyes of investors who have purchased them, relying on the covenants they contained and on the recognition of such covenants by the existing United States laws, and will have a seriously detrimental effect on the credit position of all corporations without regard to whether or not they intend to maintain good faith toward the holders of their securities.\" With railroad expenses mounting up so seriously in other directions, it would obviously be a welcome — added and growing income tax burden (which is in addition to the tax on net profits which the carriers are obliged to pay, the same as all other corporations), but railbenefit for carriers to secure relief from this July THE CHRONICLE 28 1917.] road credit is already so seriously impaired as a result of the long period of adversity with which the railroads have had to contend, that any attempt to nullify, even by indirection, the tax-free covenant in their bond issues must tend still further to impair their credit, leaving them the losers anyway in the It will be best for all parties, in our estimation, end. if nothing be done that can even impliedly be considered a violation of good faith on the part of Con- and the corporations in the observance of the letter and spirit of the tax-free covenants of corgress porate bonds. After a formal conference in Paris attended by distinguished representatives of the Entente Powers a declaration was adopted unanimously on Thursday agreeing to continue the struggle until the war aims had been attained. The declaration follows: Allied Powers, more closely united than ever for the defense of the peoples' rights, particularly in the Balkan peninsula, are resolved not to lay down arms until they have attained the end which, in their to render impossible a eyes, dominates all others return of the criminal aggression such as that wherefor the Central Powers bear the responsibility.\" \"The — 315 No attempt is made by the British papers to minimize the disastrous effect of the Russian situation. The Petrograd correspondent of the London \"Morning Post\" describes the defeat as \"an appalling blow\" and tells how the Russian army that ran away was easily the finest equipped the nation had yet put into the field. There seems slight encouragement to hope that any sufficient recuperation will be possible to render Russian support of real value for a considerable period. All that can be hoped is that the Dictator will display sufficient control to be able to offer, enough resistance to make it possible to keep the Eastern armies of the Central Powers from being released completely to the Western front On the latter there have been many savage attacks \\vith some moderate It is degree of success to the Germans this week. obvious that a new offensive campaign has been started with a view of forcing a decision if possible before our own troops become available in important numbers.

Further reference to Bonar Law's statements will be found on page 329. That there are to be for the present, at least, no further important changes in the British Ministry, by a vote of confidence of 301 to 102 which the Government obtained in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The vote was in the form of the defeat of an amendment to the Corn Production Bill, which the Ministers had announced their intention of treating as a test vote. The result was all the more significant since the bill as a whole is heartily disliked by a large section of Parliament, as well as of the public. Walter Runciman and others strongly denounced the 25 shillings ($6 25) minimum wage for farm wages as miserably inadequate. The Government's position, as explained by the Attorney-General, was that the Government was fixing a minimum which would prevent the farm laborers from being exploited and that there was -nothing in the bill to prevent the Wages Board from giving a higher wage where it was justified. The Wardle amendment, which was the one in question, sought to increase this minimum to 25^30s. weekly. Rowland E. Prothero, President of the Board of Agriculture, announced that if the amendment were pressed to a division, the Government would stand or fall by the result, with all the necessary conseMr. Prothero said the average wage in quences. 1909 and 1910 was 17 shillings and 10 pence, and the increase to 25 would mean that, during the operation of the bill, the farmers would have to pay in increased is indicated The largest war credit yet asked by the British Government, namely £650,000,000 ($3,250,000,000) wages £59,455,000.

An interesting sidelight of the war's effect on the world's financial markets as shown by the steady decline of exchange abroad, is revealed in an article recently published in the Lausanne \"Gazette,\" at Geneva, and received by cable, which says: \"Not since the War of Secession has the American dollar fallen so low. It was quoted here to-day at 4 francs 46 centimes, while before the war it stood at 5.12. One hundred rubles, which were worth 266 francs before the war, are now quoted at 99 francs. One hundred marks are worth less than half their value, while 100 Austrian crowns were quoted at 39.80 francs. For the first time in history the Italian lire is worth more than the mark. The steady decline in the value of money began a month ago and is continuing.\" A despatch from Copenhagen under date of July 24 also states that American exchange dropped to-day to 341, a new low record, about 10% below parity.

Perhaps at no ti me since the war began has the situation been so full of bewildering contradictions and perplexities, or the course of events, immediate or remote, so difficult to forecast. One reason for this confusion, even of expert judgment, lies in the fact that nothing in the summer campaign of 1917 has occurred according to the expected program. The Anglo-French drive in the west, begun under the most promising auspices, has for many weeks come virtually to a halt. The German submarine cam- their people in for a subjection. was the ruling sovereigns of Europe who in that period were eventually forced to join hands for the In framfinal overthrow of their ambitious rival. ing judgment, therefore, as to what should be the outcome, under the circumstances of war conducted by the European peoples, we have no modern precedent to guide us. Yet the events of the past few weeks indicate strongly that the people of Germany, of Russia, perhaps of Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey, paign, which, so the leaders told the Reichstag, was will have the chief hand in the eventual solution. to bring England to the verge of economic collapse The difficulty which attends conjecture as to the within three months, has failed of its purpose. The probable course of events lies in our ignorance of Italian offensive on the Austrian front has ceased; the real public sentiment in those States. it is weeks since any news of important operations This is notably true of Russia. We had learned, has been cabled from that quarter. The German even before this week's extraordinary news of the move on Saloniki a favorite prediction, earlier in army's retreat in defiance of orders, and the Kerensky — —has not It the year, of even the Allied military critics dictatorship at Petrograd, that a powerful popular materialized at all.

Not one of these momentous occurrences -probably not even the anarchy in Russia can be said to have as yet distinctly influenced the progress of the campaign and the immediate prospects of terminating tion. No created by them has none the such information as to the real condition of things in the Austrian army, for example, has come through to us. Yet the course of several recent Austrian campaigns has strongly suggested a spirit of dissatisfaction with the war and of unwillingness Austria's battalions being so largely to continue it. recruited from subject populations of Slavic race, such a tendency would be far more logical with them even than with the Russian troops. The enormous capture of prisoners by Brussiloff in his 1916 campaign supplemented by General Scott's description of the instantaneous surrender of Austrian regiments in mass on the first of the recent forward that which now moves — — the conflict. Such periods of uncertainty and confusion are not by any means uncommon in protracted wars. The accompanying incidents have not always been similar in character, but the perplexity over the outlook less been as great as Occasions of this sort were notably frequent in the Napoleonic wars, though the form they then assumed was dictated by the intrigues of autocratic rulers or by the absolute military defeat of one belligerent Power by is antagonist. The Russian Emperor actually changed sides twice in the course of the twelve years' fighting after the rupture of the Peace of Amiens; the Austrian exists. Emperor changed smaller German sides three or four times. The States fought in one campaign under Napoleon, in another against him. Nothing has happened in this way in the present war, and for that the explanation seems to be that, taking the nations as a whole, the war is now much more a war of peoples than of sovereigns. But that fact, instead of clarifying the outlook, actually In line with Napoleonic precedent, obscures it. Belgium would long ago have made peace with Ger- many and Serbia with Austria. Italy might have withdrawn from the coalition of Entente Allies.

It make and that in the end the people might be argued that, since the tendency will towards increased popular control pervades every European country, the people of the Entente States are as likely to force a peace based upon Germany's official terms as are the people of the Central States In to force acceptance of their enemy's conditions. a measure, this may be the case; it may result in a radical readjustment of the Allied Powers' program regarding, for the instance, dismemberment of But the amounting peace negotiations to surrender could be forced by their probability^ that people on the Western allied Governments is vastly reduced by two essential facts of the situation. France and England; the Ministries represent the people, and Russia is Democracy already rules in near the goal of a similar representative Government. Perhaps even more important, the crime of Imperial Germany against Belgium, and of Imperial Austria against Serbia, not only remains unrepented, but a powerful faction in both countries is known to demand that the fruits of this subjugation of small free States be retained through compulsory vassalage or annexation.

It ought not to be necessary to say such elementary things to the ordinary business and goes beyond even the savage instinct of the animal to protect its own, when reprisal is demanded in kind. By every law of the eternal spiritual the mothers of England, though this bloody cross be laid upon them, must suffer, but call for no like deeds.

On behalf of the Merchants' a wide range of ratio between the capital employed and the business done and profits earned, both in different, lines and in different concerns in the same line. To devise a scheme which shall be just and equitable upon everybody in levying an excess profits tax (at least, without cramming it with exceptions and exemptions) is not our task, nor are we sure that anybody is equal to it. The framer of this scheme seems to have been thinking less about securing the most equitable and least burdensome tax than of making sure that nobody should be able to escape. Assuming that a tax of this character is to be laid, the basis proposed by Mr, White does not seem to make any distinct culty, there is THE CHRONICLE 324 [Vol. 105.

All their energy has been directed to that end. The result is, that an ever increasing volume of the notes is being got in circulation, and that that is hailed as the greatest achievement of the Federal Reserve Act. The law provides that \"whenever Federal Reserve notes issued through one Federal Reserve bank shall be received by another Federal Reserve bank, they shall be promptly- returned for credit or redemption to the Federal Reserve bank through which they were originally issued, or \" (as now changed) \"upon direction of such^Federal Reserve bank they^shall^be JuLi 28 THE CHRONICLE 1917.1 forwarded direct to the Treasurer of the United It is also provided that \"no States to be retired.\" Federal Reserve bank shall pay out notes issued through another under penalty of a tax of 10% upon But no attempt the face value of notes so paid out.\" retirement of the notes. The is made to force a districts are large, covering a wide area of territory, so the 10% penalty has no effect beyond confining the notes of the different Reserve banks to their own district. As fast as the notes come nary- course, in the different districts, in, in bread or wheat, either on production or consumption. But shading away from this prime necessity, it has been proposed to lay a consumption tax on coffee and sugar, respectively classed as a luxury and a necessity. Lying out beyond coffee in the class of beverages are whiskey, beer and wine. As foods these articles would rank in the order of wine, beer and whiskey, if the last be admitted into the family of foods which would be strenuously denied by many. Whiskey and beer consume grains in the making and thus diminish the food supply. How many bushels are thus employed is a matter of widely varying estimate. Advocates of proper conservation of the food supply, declaring alcoholic liquors to be the ordi- they are paid out again. In the New York district the capacity for the absorption of new issues of notes appears endless.

In current transactions nothing is met with now except these Preserve notes. They are not, however, allowed to accumulate in the hands of the banks. They are paid out over the counter with the greatest freedom, and every means taken to get rid of them except to present them for redemption. The latter would be an embarrassing step to take and would mean the direct antagonizing of the course of the Reserve authorities, while the prevailing belief evidently is that these should be assisted in the carrying out of their plans which there is no inclination to question and which in some vague way it is hoped must prove beneficial. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to levy a tax on the notes. This would be more effective in getting the notes back home than anything else, but the Board has never deemed it advisable to impose When addressed in the matter about fifteen months ago, the Board said that it had not been deemed necessary to force the retirement of the notes ''since the amount in circulation is no larger than is needed for the volume of business now being done by the banks.\" At present with the volume of outstanding notes more than double what it was when this inquiry was addressed to the Board, the same views evidently still prevail, and this illustrates unmistakably the policy of expansion that is being pursued with respect to these note issues. such a tax. WAR-TIME PROHIBITION, A COMPLICATED QUESTION. one of the unfortunate conditions of lawat this time that complications inevitably arise. Practice invades theory, and theory hampers practice. Not only is the economic life of the people affected, but the social life as well. Congress sets out to raise an enormous tax. The entire gamut. of production is canvassed in search of articles that will yield a revenue. In not a single instance can a large levy be laid without affecting that particular industry and its interdependent allies. Scarcity and high prices stimulate production. But a direct tax has the opposite effect, and if it goes beyond the It is making 335 i' manufacture. And it is not unjust to say that to these may be added a large class of the population who go beyond this and would do away with liquors upon moral grounds and are willing that they shall be taxed out of existence. Difficulties immediately arise. Both State and National Governments have always been willing to derive revenue from both manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, whatever the percentage of alcohol they may contain. Classed as luxuries the States and the nation have taken no* positive grounds on the moral question involved as far as taxation is concerned. And municipalities have been content, by means of the licensing system, to derive a very large revenue from the sale. Where prohibition of manufacture and sale has been enacted it has been done by the voters on moral grounds. Thus, under normal prices whiskey which admittedly can be manufactured at a cost of from twentyfive to thirty cents a gallon, for a long time bore an internal revenue tax of one dollar and fifteen cents a gallon, collected with great severity under the bonded warehouse system. In a State containing large brewery interests four cents a gallon was placed upon beer. While for many years prior to the war it was an open charge that many small municipal governments were actually sustained by the annual license tax upon saloons. And in so far as whiskey tends to produce crime the -indictment has often been made that these various governments were thus in league with the devil. And there can be little doubt that in many instances when all the taxes are added together ©n the making and selling of whiskey, especially, the governments have been taking about all the \"traffic\" would and could bear. Estimates made upon the proposed increase indicate a prohibitive tax and a \"bone-dry\" country when present stocks are exhausted, whether laid upon whiskey alone, or upon wine and beer as well.. The complication assumes two unrelated phases. The social question of the evils arising from the consumption of alcoholic drinks is distinctive. It is a disputed question. Whether alcohol is food or poison, whether it is wholly inimical to health or sometimes efficacious in certain diseases, finds adMany herents- even in .the medical profession. persons believe that temperate use of liquors is an individual right. Many believe that the protection of the home and family demands stringent probecomes prohibitive. That overindulgence works increasing hibition. With an estimated need for larger quantities of harm in a state of war is a valid argument against foodstuffs, occasioning a probable continuance of general sale. But the law against the sale to soldiers high prices, taxes on consumption are resorted to in uniform and in proscribed areas around army last of all.
