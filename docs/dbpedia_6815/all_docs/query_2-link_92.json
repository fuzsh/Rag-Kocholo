During the July 4 episode of The Talk, Kelsey Grammer, who played the titular character on the NBC hit between 1993 and 2004, teased what fans can expect when the revival eventually hits Paramount+.\n\n\"We're in the final stages of the final script for the first episode of Frasier, and it looks pretty good,\" he shared. \"I've had a couple of runs through it, and I cried. So, you know, I'm happy.\"\n\nSo, when can we actually expect the new episodes? According to Kelsey, production might tentatively begin this fall."
