        "text": "Bottle Location\n\nWhen Curly asks for the bottle, the bartender places the bottle next to Curly, but in the next shot, it's suddenly next to Moe.\n\nCrew Member's Hand Seen\n\nWhen Larry tosses up the $5 gold piece, a crew member's hand can be seen at the far top right of the screen tossing up the change.\n\nCurly's Open Shirt\n\nWhen Moe asks Decker \"Got a $5 gold piece?, Curly's shirt is unbuttoned, but it's buttoned suddenly in the next shot.\n\nEcho\n\nAfter Decker says \"Thieves, huh?, you can hear an echo of that line.\n\nGentleman Cut\n\nThere is a noticeable cut in the film when Nell announces the Stooges as \"Gentleman.\" Moe looks to his left and starts to acknowledge Curly, then there is a cut and Moe is glanced to his right. Perhaps there was a forgotten line or the cameraman forgot to stop the filming.\n\nMissing Part\n\nWhen the ropes that Moe and Larry are tied to break, in the background you can see Decker unconscious with a drum busted over his head, yet they never showed how that happened.\n\nMysterious Black Eye\n\nDuring Curly's first wild \"Moe, Larry, the Cheese! outburst, he pushes Hyden Zeke's back into the wall, knocking him unconscious. Then a minute later when Zeke comes back to, he has a black eye, but Curly didn't even hit him in the eye.\n\nNo explanation\n\nWhen the Stooges bow down to Nell, Moe bops Curly on the head, then all of a sudden, it cuts to Larry holding his face in disgust as Moe glares at him with a mean face as if he hit Larry, yet they didn't show it.\n\nNumber Changing Back and Forth\n\nAfter Decker shoots two people who won't pay for their drinks, the bartender goes to a chalk board that says \"Decker: 115 - Opponents: 0, then he erases the \"5 in \"115 and puts in a \"7, making it \"117. However, a while later in the film when the Stooges ask the bartender for drink, the camera shows a close-up of the bartender and behind him, you can see the chalkboard and the number is suddenly back to \"115.\n\nReal Eyepoke\n\nWhen Moe says \"Take it easy, Butterfingers! and pokes Curly in the eyes, it looks like he really hit Curly's eyes (as opposed to poking his eyebrows like it's normally done).\n\nStanding Ovation?\n\nAs the boys arrive in the bar & stiff the bartender for their drinks, Decker is seen to stand up to confront them. But as the camera angle changes, & although he already stood up once, Decker is seen to stand up again as the boys move farther away from the bar & he confronts them.\n\nSwitching Hands\n\nWhen the Stooges are looking at the picture of the detective's wife, Curly has a pipe in his right hand, but in the next shot, it's in his left hand suddenly.\n\nVisible Wires\n\nYou can see the wires holding Moe and Larry up as they're being hung by a rope.\n\nCoin-shooting\n\nDuring a coin-shooting sequence, when somebody flips a coin in the air, a Stooge shoots it and it turns into a whole bunch of pennies.\n\nAlso used in: OUT WEST · PALS AND GALS\n\nGoes Berserk After Hears/Sees/Smells Something\n\nCurly or Curly-Joe goes bonkers every time he hears the song Pop Goes the Weasel and starts punching out everything within reach, and only stopping the music will settle him down ... OR ... Curly goes insane whenever he sees a mouse, and only a mouthful of cheese will settle him down ... OR ... Curly goes nuts whenever he smells \"Wild Hyacinth\" perfume and only tickling his feet will settle him down ... OR ... Curly goes crazy every time he sees a tassel, and only rubbing it on his chin will calm him down.\n\nAlso used in: PUNCH DRUNKS · GRIPS, GRUNTS, AND GROANS · TASSELS IN THE AIR · THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE\n\nIt's on the House\n\nWhen the Stooges are asked by a waiter/bartender to pay for their drinks, they respond with \"It's a tin roof\" (or something similar.) The waiter gets confused and asks \"What do you mean?\", followed by the Stooges responding \"It's a tin roof -- it's 'on the house'!\"\n\nAlso used in: A MERRY MIX-UP · ROCKIN' IN THE ROCKIES\n\nPainted-on eyelids\n\nA Stooge has opened eyes painted on his eyelids while he's sleeping so it looks like he's awake.\n\nAlso used in: SLAPHAPPY SLEUTHS\n\nTwo men in one coat\n\nA thug has has one arm in one arm of his coat and a Stooge has an arm in the other side. As another thug tries to beat up the Stooge in the process, the Stooge punches the thug, then spins around as the thug tries to punch him, causing the thug to accidentally punch the other thug caught in the coat. This goes on an on until the two thugs are eventually knocked out.\n\nAlso used in: CALLING ALL CURS · CRASH GOES THE HASH · SLAPHAPPY SLEUTHS\n\nYou see this heel?\n\nWhen a Stooge is asked if he's a good detective, he responds \"You this this heel? I ran that down!\"\n\nAlso used in: SLAPHAPPY SLEUTHS\n\nYou'll never know...\n\nThe Stooges break out singing \"You'll never know, just what tears are...\"\n\nAlso used in: HALF SHOT SHOOTERS · A DUCKING THEY DID GO · SOUP TO NUTS · BEER AND PRETZELS · DANCING LADY · FUGITIVE LOVERS"
