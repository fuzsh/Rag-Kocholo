According to a HR news item, Withers, who was signed by Fox originally for $125 a week, was making $200 a week until This Is the Life was completed, after which her contract was to be readjusted to give her more per week reflecting her growing popularity. According to a DV news item, Withers came up with the final title for the film. FD lists Ralf Harolde, Nick Lucas, Fritzi Brunette, and Jayne Hovig as additional cast members, but their participation has not been confirmed by any other source. According to the pressbook for the film, this marked Harry C. Bradley's 3,000th role as a clergyman. The pressbook also noted that \"the largest number of juvenile actors and actresses ever to be used in a motion picture -- 260 in all -- were employed\" in the film, and that David Buttolph, who conducted orchestras on coast-to-coast radio shows, made his motion picture debut as musical director in this film. Fox produced a film with the same title in 1917, and there have been at least two other films with this title, a 1933 British film and a 1944 Universal film, but none are based on the same source as this film.\n\nLess\n\nGeraldine Revier, a famous child performer, would like to live like other children, but she is forced to play five shows daily and spend her free time alone in hotel rooms by her demanding Aunt Diane and conniving and philandering Uncle Ed.

After an altercation with four tramps results in the wagon being burned, the four come upon a church outing, and Gerry, after getting a bloodied nose from a fight during a baseball game, exclaims that she never had so much fun. The next day, Michael sneaks into a barn to get some milk for Gerry, and he is caught by Helen Davis, who lives on the ranch with her mother. Holding Michael and Gerry at bay with a shotgun, Helen calls the police after realizing that Gerry is a girl and recognizing her from her picture in a newspaper. Michael then explains to Helen about overhearing the scheme of Gerry's uncle and aunt, and to save Gerry, gives himself up to the police as a wanted man. Helen's mother hires the professor and Sticky to help at the ranch, where they keep Gerry hidden. After two weeks, they receive a letter from Michael, who says that he has been convicted and is trying to raise money for a lawyer to reopen the investigation. To help, Gerry performs in a singing and dancing act backed by Mrs. Davis at a fair's midway, as Helen plays the piano, the professor hawks customers and Sticky sells tickets. Diane and Ed, looking for a replacement for Gerry, see the act and grab her. After Michael is released from the penitentiary because another man has confessed after efforts to help Michael were made by detectives hired with money that Gerry sent, Micheal goes to Denver and, impersonating a special investigator, interrogates Diane and Ed. With Helen posing as his secretary, the professor as a judge, Sticky as a bailiff and Mrs. Davis as a social worker, Michael coerces Diane and Ed into signing a confession. Gerry is extremely excited to learn that she is going back to the ranch and jumps on Michael's back saying \"This is the life,\" as she kisses his neck.\n\nLess"
