        "text": "Simon Morgan\n\nWhen basic physics dashed Simon’s boyhood dream of floating in a luminous anti-gravity jumpsuit high above the continent, he turned his eye to the world of video production. And he’s never looked back. Or down.\n\nAfter graduating (with distinction) from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology Radio and Television Program, Simon went on to produce, direct, and serve as Director of Photography on hundreds of corporate, government and commercial productions. All while wearing regular, down-to-earth clothes — which he knits for himself.\n\nDespite his humble nature, Simon’s not above accepting awards. He won prizes for Best Promotional Video and Best Motivational Production respectively at the 2010 and 2012 Alberta Film and Television Festivals. In 2012 he won three ACE (Advertising Club of Edmonton) Awards including Best Video Production and also received two ACE Awards of Distinction for video production in 2013. He still looks back with particular fondness on his single greatest achievement: his Participant ribbon in Grade One.\n\nIt’s not all work for Simon. He fancies himself a modest talent at soccer (or “football”, as he so quaintly puts it), enjoys spending time with his children (“kids”), and has been known to put back a pint (“gallon”) or two of beer while staring wistfully at the sky.\n\nFred Keating\n\nWriter. Actor. Producer. Director. Thrice-decorated, twice-attacked lion tamer.\n\nEven if that last credit’s a bit of a stretch, Fred is skilled and fearless, an award-winning filmmaker with more accomplishments than you can shake a whip at. Since 1984 Fred’s been telling stories, both in front of and behind the camera, for the motion picture industry, private companies, and provincial and federal government departments. He’s racked up more than 78 movie credits on IMDB — although Simon is always quick to point out that most of Fred’s scenes end up on the cutting room floor. He’s a voting member of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television and the Writer’s Guild of Canada. In 2003 Fred received the David Billington Award in recognition of his many contributions to Alberta’s production community, and in 2005 was honoured with The Centennial Medal for his work in Alberta-based media projects.\n\nFurther cementing his courageous reputation, Fred has proven his fortitude over the past (too many to count) years by demonstrating his ability to work in close surroundings with cunning, instinctive beasts: the Lindisfarne team.\n\nSheena Wheadon\n\nAsk Sheena why she’s known as the “Godmother of Taxidermy” and she’ll politely change the subject and explain that making videos has always come naturally to her.\n\nAt the age of ten, Sheena produced her first in a long series of Spice Girls tribute videos. Ever since achieving this audio-visual tour-de-force, Sheena has known: a life in production is all she wants (All she really, really wants!). Her passion for storytelling using pictures led to her enrollment at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology Radio &amp; Television Arts Program, and soon after graduation young Sheena got with her friends here at Lindisfarne.\n\nNow fully grown, Sheena focuses her extensive producing and directing skills on meeting – and exceeding – her clients’ needs. And though she’d never admit it, her skill at managing those needs makes her a respected asset, both on location and throughout the entire production process. Her technical knowledge of production and post-production matters has been pivotal to serving Lindisfarne’s client base. Amazingly, Sheena has been able to acquire all this valuable expertise while possessing an incredible skill: the ability to silently move her ears back and forth.\n\nHaving previously made her home in exotic locales such as Port Hawkesbury Nova Scotia, Burlington Ontario, and Temiscaming Quebec, Sheena now resides at an undisclosed location somewhere in Edmonton. Don’t ask.\n\nKelsey van Moorsel\n\nIf there’s a board game where the object is to grow up, travel, learn, and get all kinds of experience while advancing to higher levels of skill and success, then Kelsey van Moorsel is the winner of that game. And it should be named after her, too. Born in Taber, Kelsey grew up in L.A. (okay, Lethbridge, Alberta – the traveling part starts later) and Red Deer. As a young girl she wanted to be a detective, but later had a Clue she might want to roll the dice and take a Risk on something different in Life. And that’s how Kelsey began the untrivial pursuit of her dream: to be a player in the entertainment industry.\n\nAfter getting her certification in Communications at Red Deer College, Kelsey made her move to Toronto, where she enrolled in Ryerson University’s Radio and Television Arts program. In the middle of all that Kelsey traveled in New Zealand and Australia, where she continued to hone her television production skills. In 2010 she joined a Toronto-based talent agent for writers, actors, and directors. After eight and a half years in Toronto, Kelsey has circled the board and returned to Alberta, where her latest winning move is capturing our hearts as the newest member of the Lindisfarne team.\n\nAs a former talent agent, Kelsey has a few talents of her own. For one, she can drive a forklift. In her world, Extreme Organization is a sport. And we defy you to find anyone better at lyric retention (she knows all hundred and fifty-eight verses of the Forklift Safety Song, including: “Stay on level ground so there’s no slipping, Stack your load so there’s no tipping…”). When she isn’t hard at work, Kelsey can be found swimming, traveling, camping, reading, and – of course – playing video and board games.\n\nAnthony (Andy) Goertz\n\nWhen Anthony Goertz was a wee lad, his parents wondered where his Scottish accent came from. “A sparkling imagination,” said some. “Dissociative identity disorder,” said others. “An air of mystery,” said Anthony, convincing no one. Whatever the case, it was accompanied by a deep love of making movies, a quality which has stubbornly refused to leave ever since (though, thankfully, the accent has).\n\nThroughout his youth, Anthony honed his skills behind and in front of the camera, making mockumentaries, music videos, and short films that have garnered awards and praise from his adoring fan. Now technically an adult, Anthony is Lindisfarne’s newest team member. He’s also a member of the Director’s Guild of Canada, a board member at the Documentary Organization of Canada, and his award-winning film “The Line,” about Edmonton’s waste workers, has screened at film festivals around the world.\n\nWhen he’s not dreaming of movies, he can be found drawing, biking, or portraying Qhorin Sandwalker, chaotic good monk, librarian at the Archive of the Cobalt Soul, with a cohort of nerds in an Edmonton basement."
