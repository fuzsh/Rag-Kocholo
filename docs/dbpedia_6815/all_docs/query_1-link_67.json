        "text": "Graphene is extracted from graphite and is made up of pure carbon.\n\nIt is 200 times more resistant than steel and five times lighter than aluminum.\n\nIt conducts electricity better than any other material at room temperature.\n\nIt is thought that graphene could boost the useful life of batteries by 10 per cent.\n\nGraphene can also detect cancer cells in the early stages of the disease.\n\nThe material was first discovered when Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov were 'playing' with graphite at the University of Manchester in 2004.\n\nEdinburgh: November 4 (unchanged)\n\nBahrain: November 15 (from September 15); second daily service from January 1\n\nKuwait: November 15 (from September 16)\n\nMumbai: January 1 (from October 27)\n\nAhmedabad: January 1 (from October 27)\n\nColombo: January 2 (from January 1)\n\nMuscat: March 1 (from December 1)\n\nLyon: March 1 (from December 1)\n\nBologna: March 1 (from December 1)\n\nSource: Emirates\n\nTransplants from the deceased have been carried out in hospitals across the globe for decades, but in some countries in the Middle East, including the UAE, the practise was banned until relatively recently.\n\nOpinion has been divided as to whether organ donations from a deceased person is permissible in Islam.\n\nThe body is viewed as sacred, during and after death, thus prohibiting cremation and tattoos.\n\nOne school of thought viewed the removal of organs after death as equally impermissible.\n\nThat view has largely changed, and among scholars and indeed many in society, to be seen as permissible to save another life.\n\nThe flights\n\nEmirates and Etihad fly to Johannesburg or Cape Town daily. Flights cost from about Dh3,325, with a flying time of 8hours and 15 minutes. From there, fly South African Airlines or Air Namibia to Namibia’s Windhoek Hosea Kutako International Airport, for about Dh850. Flying time is 2 hours.\n\nThe stay\n\nWilderness Little Kulala offers stays from £460 (Dh2,135) per person, per night. It is one of seven Wilderness Safari lodges in Namibia; www.wilderness-safaris.com.\n\nSkeleton Coast Safaris’ four-day adventure involves joining a very small group in a private plane, flying to some of the remotest areas in the world, with each night spent at a different camp. It costs from US$8,335.30 (Dh30,611); www.skeletoncoastsafaris.com"
