        "meta_description": "Cyrus Townsend, father of Alice, is mysteriously slain in his home and suspicion centers on Arthur Marsden, his secretary and Alice's sweetheart. The circumstances of the murder are similar to those of numerous unsolved killings believed to have been perpetrated by a gorilla. As Alice, Marsden, and Stevens (a friend of Cyrus) are gathered in the library, a note warns them to leave the house before midnight. Later, they are terrified by the unexpected arrival of Mulligan and Garrity, two callous detectives sent to solve the mystery; subsequently, persons suddenly vanish, strange noises are heard, and lights go off and on. While searching for each other, the detectives discover a gorilla on the premises; a sailor confesses to being the gorilla; but Marsden, who reveals himself also to be a detective, leads them to Stevens, the true culprit.",

        "text": "The 3 Jan 1927 FD announced The Gorilla as a forthcoming feature from independent production company Asher-Small-Rogers, based on Ralph Spence’s 1925 play of the same name. Paul Schofield had been hired to write the adaption at that time, but he did not remain with the project. The following day, FD reported that Asher-Small-Rogers would produce the film for First National Pictures, Inc., as the second of a three-picture deal with the company, the first of which was McFadden’s Flats (1927, see entry).\n\nOn 25 Feb 1927, Motion Picture News named Alfred Santell as the director and noted an expected production start date in Mar 1927. However, the 27 May 1927 issue reported an anticipated Jun 1927 start of filming, and announced the casting of co-leads Charles Murray and George Sidney.\n\nAlthough the 5 Jul 1927 FD announced that principal photography would begin on 1 Aug 1927, and the 10 Aug 1927 Var stated that filming began on 9 Aug 1927, several news items throughout Aug 1927 indicated that production had not yet begun.

The 18 Sep 1927 and 11 Nov 1927 FD named Henry Johnson and Gene Towne as comedy writers on the film, and the 6 Oct 1927 issue listed Eddie Adams as the film editor.\n\nBy early Oct 1927, production was nearly completed, according to the 5 Oct 1927 FD. The 16 Oct 1927 edition reported that titling was currently underway by Sidney Lazarus.\n\nAccording to the 19 Oct 1927 Var, producer Edward Small “decided that additional scenes had to be made” after Santell completed filming, but Santell had begun another production. Edward F. Cline was hired to direct the additional scenes.\n\nThe 4 Nov 1927 Motion Picture News announced that the editing and titling had been completed the previous week, and a Nov 1927 release was anticipated.\n\nThe 28 Oct 1927 Motion Picture News printed conflicting national release dates of 13 Nov 1927 and 15 Nov 1927. The 11 Nov 1927 issue stated that the film would premiere simultaneously in three cities on 5 Nov 1927 in Cleveland and Toledo, OH, and St. Louis, MS. On 15 Nov 1927, FD noted a west coast premiere scheduled for 17 Nov 1927 at the Million Dollar Theatre in Los Angeles, CA. Finally, the New York opening was held on 21 Nov 1927 at the Mark Strand Theatre, according to that day’s FD.\n\nThe 2 Nov 1927 Var and the 18 Nov 1927 FD announced that Asher-Small-Rogers had dissolved their partnership with the completion of the follow-up film to The Gorilla, Ladies’ Night in a Turkish Bath (1928, see entry). The production company had been established in 1924 specifically to produce films for Corrine Griffith for First National. Following Griffith’s departure from First National, Asher-Small-Rogers made four films including The Gorilla, the aforementioned McFadden’s Flats and Ladies’ Night in a Turkish Bath, and The Cohens and Kellys (1926, see entry).\n\nThe 13 Nov 1927 FD deemed the picture a “winner,” stating that “the thrills and the laughs in ‘The Gorilla’ will send the audience into an uproar.”\n\nSpence's play was remade as a “talkie” by First National in 1930, with a new cast and crew, with the exception of Walter Pidgeon, who appeared in both pictures as different characters. The story was adapted again by Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. in 1939, directed by Allan Dwan and starring the Ritz Brothers. Both pictures were also called The Gorilla (see entries).\n\nA 95-minute version of Alfred Santell's The Gorilla, recently discovered at the Cineteca Milano in Italy, was screened at the 2024 San Francisco Silent Film Festival on 14 April 2024.\n\nLess"
