Finally the Washington correspondent of the \"World\" of this city yesterday stated that there was \"a strong probability of a proclamation by President Wilson placing the country and its possessions under martial law as a necessary step toward the suppression of attacks on munition plants and Government property.\" Just think of it—the whole country under martial law! At the same time, in arranging for the prosecution of the war, we deal with billions with the freedom that an individual who has never known care or want dispenses pocket money. It is, of course, important that our financial arrangements should be broad and comprehensive and adequate for all needs, but the putting out, as proposed, of $7,000,000,000 of Government obligations should not be lightly entered upon, and without giving due consideration to all the possible consequences. For one thing, it should be remembered that an issue of $5,000,000,000 of United States bonds means the THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. displacement of a vast amount of other investment Our Government and our legislators should have a obligations, and this in turn means more or less hardcare lest in our endeavor to subjugate the autocracies ship and the disturbance and disorganization of inof Europe we do not, by the use of similar methods, vestment values generally.

With this issue of the \"Chronicle\" we send to our subscribers an index covering the numbers of the paper that have appeared in the three months ending with March 31 1917. In this we are inaugurating a new practice. Heretofore it has been the custom to furnish an index at the end of each six months. Owing to the increase in the size of the paper it is no longer feasible to bind the numbers for a six-months period in a single volume,since the book becomes too bulky to handle. Accordingly the volume will hereafter be bound in two parts, and an index will go with each part. The index issued to-day covers Part I of the current volume—Volume 104. The remaining three months to June 30 will constitute Part 2 of the same volume. To insure greater durability it is also the intention to bind the volumes in buckram hereafter instead of in leather, the style and appearance, however, to correspond very closely with the old volumes. APR. 14 1917.] THE CHRONICLE men. It:furthermore abhors autocratic power vested in single individual. It believes in checking one power by another, and each man by other men and, therefore vests authority in groups rather than in individuals.\" Dm The foregoing remarks were simply incidental to Mr. Warburg's general discussion of the subject of Government and Business, and may, therefore, possess no special significance as hearing upon the Government's war policy, but as the whole speech is an apotheosis of Government regulation, and as it is in war times that the populace, thoughtless of consequence, is most prone, in a spirit of easy acquiescence, to yield up its rights and liberties, this complacent reference by Mr. Warburg to dictatorships carries a suggestive warning of what it is necessary to guard against, even when a country is battling for the ideals of democracy. 1421 about enlisting what you call \"alcouple ofimillion of the flower of its manhood\" and look facts in the face. There is no pressing or practical military necessity of an American enlistment of two million or even one million men. Our present regular army can be recruited up to 300,000 and our National Guard to 200,000. From these we could and ought to send three army corps (120,000 men) to the front in Belgium, making with the Belgians an army of about 250,000 seasoned soldiers. Then this army should be pivoted on the Belgian coast north of Dunkirk, and set the grateful task of hunting Germans out of their submarine base at Zeebrugge. As it is submarines we are after, the place to seek and destroy then is at their base. In such a.chase the fleet could render invaluable assistance. But my point is a small well-equipped army at the front, leaving the millions you speak of at home on the farms and in the factories to feed and munition it and provide sufficient food to keep the world from any approach to starvation for as many years as the war may last. It seems to me suicidal folly to talk of an army of millions to be ready two or three years hence, when we have barely enough officers to train and command one of halfa million now. Read what the \"First Seven Divisions\" of the British army did in France in August, September and October 1914 against the flushed and confident flower of the German military machine, and imagine how a like number of American regulars would brace up the little force that is to-day standing at bay in the little southwest corner of Belgium. The opportunity is almost too romantically heroic to invite the attention of strategists who can only think in millions of men and damn the billions of expense. Mr. Slason Thompson, Director of the Bureau of Railway News and Statistics at Chicago, takes exception to our remarks of last week that the whole world is facing economic axhaustion because of the withdrawal of millions of men from reproductive enterprise, and our further remark that the entrance of the United States into the conflict with the withdrawal of another couple of million of men from SLASON THOMPSON. agricultural and industrial pursuits must tend to says that Mr. It Thompson that will be observed aggravate the situation, and speedily bring on a up to pourstill was United States \"the latest dates crisis.

That the American people should begin at once to look years. Doubtless we will raise enough winter wheat and facts in the face and prepare to conserve its resources cannot be recognized too soon. And it should leave off talking spring wheat combined to satisfy home needs, but 1422 THE CHRONICLE with supplies from the old crop practically exhausted, the question is how are we to meet the needs of Great Britain and the other allies. If early in the new crop year we should nevertheless send large amounts abroad, then we would be confronted with. the possibility of insufficient supplies later in the crop season for our own needs. It should not escape notice that David Lubin, the American representative to the International Institute of Agriculture, issued a warning from Rome last week stating that for the first time in many years there existed a deficit in the supply of corn, wheat, rye, barley and oats and that the United States must profit by Europe's experience and conserve supplies \"before meal tickets become necessary.\" Finally, J. Ogden Armour, at Chicago, this week has declared the situation alarming, and suggested Government price fixing for grain and live stock, and the appointment of meatless days in this country. In view of all this it hardly seems necessary to argue the question of economic exhaustion any further. What Mr. Thompson says in the closing part of his letter with reference to there being no pressing or practical military necessity of an American enlistment of 2,000,000, or even 1,000,000 men, we agree with. It will be - observed that he suggests sending merely three army corps (120,000 men) to the front in Belgium for the purpose of hunting the Germans out of their submarine base at Zeebrugge. We cannot persuade ourselves that the United States should send any army abroad, but at least if some troops must go, Mr. Thompson's suggestion is along sane and sensible lines. The commercial failures statement for March 1917 discloses a condition of solvency in the United States that conforms to the situation revealed by the monthly reports for some time past. In other words, the showing is a very favorable one, the number of defaults having been smaller than for the similar period of any year since 1913 and the volume of failed indebtedness of strictly moderate proportions —slightly heavier than for March of last year, due to a few large disasters in manufacturing lines, but less than for the month of any year prior thereto back to, but not including, 1910. For the quarter ended with March 31, moreover, the exhibit is the best in a number of years, the commercial mortality being the lowest in seven years and the aggregate of liabilities below any year since 1909, and in most instances materially so. It is not to be inferred from the foregoing, however, that there has been absence of stress in all directions this year. On the contrary, in one or two manufacturing lines the indebtedness reported for the three months this year is noticeably in excess of 1916, traders in groceries, meat and fish have been adversely affected by the great rise in the cost of the products they handle and for one reason or another the debts in the agents and brokers class have been largely swelled. But the general situation is satisfactory and not out of line with the prevailing condition of prosperity in the country. Messrs. R. G. Dun & Co.'s statement of failures, which furnishes the basis for our remarks, indicates that for the month of March 1917 the number of insolvencies was only 1,232, covering indebtedness of $17,406,096, against 1,690 for $16,885,295 in 1916 and 2,090 for $23,658,130 in 1915, with the trading group showing up most favorably, the liabilities having been only two-thirds those of last [VoL. 104. year, and actually the smallest for the period since 1907. Among manufacturers, on the other hand, the volume of debts shows an augmentation of over 3 million dollars (from $4,820,249 to $8,050,840) 12 disasters out of 314 supplying liabilities of more than 43/ millions, and most of it in lumber and allied industries. An increase of 3 millions is to be noted, also in the liabilities of agents and brokers. For the first quarter the total of insolvent indebtedness reported is only $52,307,099 distributed among 3,937 defaults, against $61,492,746 and 5,387 a year ago, $105,703,335 and 7,216 in 1915 and $83,221,826 and 4,826 in 1914. For the quarter, as for the month, trading failures make the most favorable showing,the contraction in liabilities having been from $31,048,161 to $20,908,655, all but two of the fifteen lines included sharing in the reduction. Among manufacturers the drop in debts was only from $23,807,210 to $20,082,297, due to a marked increase in debts in machinery and tools and lumber, &c. In the group embracing agents, brokers, &c., several reverses of unusual size served to swell the liabilities from $6,637,375 to $11,316,147. Banking suspensions during the quarter were almost the same as in the preceding year, 17 comparing with 16, but the sum involved was very measurably greater—$7,268,000, against $4,220,000. Florida furnished no less than $4,100,000 of this year's total and Washington $2,700,000, leaving only $468,000 to represent financial insolvencies in the remainder of the country. Geographical analysis of the quarter's returns indicates that in all the various sections into which the insolvencies are segregated, failures were less numerous than a year ago, with the showing in that respect most favorable in the Middle Atlantic, South Atlantic and South Central groups. Liabilities were less than in 1916 in all divisions except the New England and Pacific, where the increases reported were due to the failure of three manufacturing concerns in Massachusetts and Connecticut for a total of over a million, and one brokerage house in Washington. The decided improvement in the solvency situation in Canada in 1917, heretofore referred to,continued in March, both the number of casualties and the indebtedness represented falling well below the like period of either 1916- or 1915. As regards the result for the quarter ended March 31, it is to be stated that the number of failures was the smallest since 1911 and the amount involved the lightest in four years. Briefly, the suspensions numbered only 370 for $5,921,327, against 596 for $9,344,441 in 1916 and 798 for $15,636,915 in 1915. In all the various divisions decreases from last year are disclosed, with the trading branches most favorably affected,the clothing and furnishing line conspicuously so; while among manufacturers the lumber industry—practically the leading one in the group—shows a considerable drop in debts. As regards the various Provinces, defaults were less numerous in 9 out of 10, the exception being Newfoundland and an important contraction in liabilities is be noted in Ontario and Manitoba. The first week of formal war between the United States and Germany has not been marked by any clash at arms either on the part of the naval or military organization. Meanwhile, there has been considerable activity in diplomatic circles. Austria on Tuesday severed diplomatic relations with Washing- APR. 14 1917.] THE CHRONICLE ton, presenting a note to the American Charge at Vienna dated April 8. Both Cuba and Panama have declared that a state of war exists with Germany. On Wednesday Brazil announced the breaking of diplomatic relations with Germany, although this has not yet resulted in a formal state of war. Argentina, while deciding to remain neutral, has sent a note to our own Government, endorsing the principles which led the United States to declare war. Her defenses are being strengthened as a precaution against a more serious situation later on. Uruguay also remains neutral. Chili has not yet taken a definite stand. Guatemala has taken steps of a spectacular character to prevent a revolution resulting from Mexican and German conspiracies and has proclaimed martial law in the States on the Mexican frontier. Costa Rica has sent word to her diplomatic representative at Washington endorsing President Wilson's course and declaring a readiness to take more serious steps when such action appears advisable. Spain is believed to be on the point of joining the Allies; Denmark and Holland will still try to remain neutral. In Sweden and Norway the situation is particularly strained, and it would be extremely hazardous to attempt to predict developments. Vienna, supporting her ally, has severed diplomatic relations with Brazil. Thus does it become evident how completely the entire world is in a state of diplomatic uncertainty on a scale never before equaled. 1423 own bonds, as a result of their convertibility, are forced to pay a higher rate, then the foreign bonds shall likewise pay the increased rate in order to prevent loss to our own Government, which is, it will be seen, merely extending the aid of its credit to its allies. Details of this new bond issue, as we have already remarked, are presented on a later page of the \"Chronicle\" to-day. Reports of peace have again been industriously circulated this week, though none appears to have official foundation. There is no doubt, however, that peace sentiment is spreading. It is likely to become increasingly effective as time progresses. But there is probably no question that the military party in Germany will not, until forced to, give up without a military decision of some importance. On the other hand, in view of the confidence that has taken possession of the leaders of the Allies, it seems reasonable to suppose that they, will not be willing to consider, unless forced by actual defeat,any terms that do not contemplate the overthrow of the German military caste. Among the most specific of the peace reports was one that Austrian and Bulgarian representatives are endeavoring to approach Entente diplomats in Switzerland. Bulgaria, it is reported, already has taken soundings, but whether the two countries are working separately or together is not known, nor has any reference been made in the cabled dispatches to the attitude of Germany or Turkey. In Washington this entire incident is regarded merely as an expression of weariness with the war and anxiety to bring it to an end, without, however, involving any indication of disposition on the part of the countries mentioned to propose terms acceptable to the Entente. Our Secretary of State, Mr. Lansing, in an official statement yesterday, denied all knowledge of any peace negotiations. The success of the Russian revolution is undoubtedly exerting a highly disturbing influence among the extensive Slav population of Austria-Hungary. Next in importance in the peace reports may perhaps be regarded one that negotiations are already in progress for a separate treaty between Germany and Russia. There seems no encouragement to take this rumor too seriously, and it probably has no more substantial basis than the mission of the German Socialist leader, Philipp Scheidemann, who has been visiting Scandinavian capitals to confer with the Socialist leaders there, who are endeavoring to mediate between the Russo-German Socialists with a view of terminating hostilities. Still another rumor that has circulated persistently is that Austria has taken definite steps seeking the good offices of the Pope in a movement to start peace negotiations. As yet there appears slight encouragement to place any real reliance on these alleged peace moves except on the principle that where there is so much smoke there must be some fire. At Washington all preparations are being pushed to bring the struggle to as early a successful close as possible. The present week has been devoted very largely to financial arrangements. On Wednesday the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives presented with a favorable report to the House the War Finance Bill, the full text of which appears on a subsequent page of this issue of the \"Chronicle.\" The bill, which is expected to pass the House to-day (Saturday), provides for securities having a total value of $7,000,000,090. Of this amount $2,000,000,000 will take the form of one-year certificates of indebtedness. These, presumably, will be issued at once and will be repaid at maturity from the proceeds of extra taxation for which the Administration expects to present a definite plan for legislation in the course of the next week or so. is understood that the plan will include substantial increases in the income taxation and especially in the super-taxes, with provisions for the imposition of stamp taxes on lines very similar to what were in force during the Spanish-American War in 1898; also the institution of customs duties on tea, coffee, &c., and additional duties upon various articles of necessities that are freely imported at the present time. The total authorization of $5,000,000,000 in bonds will have two 'main objects. They will carry a rate of not more than 332% interest and will be convertible into any additional bonds that may be offered by our own Government before Dec. 31 1918, if such later bonds are favored with a higher rate of interest. That internal affairs in Germany are occupying a Of the $5,000,000,000 in bonds, $2,000,000,000 are position of high tension is suggested by the Kaiser's to be placed at the disposal of the Treasury for war instructions to the Imperial Chancellor, Dr. von expenditures. \"Not more than\" $3,000,000,000 of Bethmann-Hollweg to submit certain proposals for the remainder is to be made available to foreign the reform of the Prussian electoral law \"to be disgovernments, the plan being to sell our own bonds cussed and put into effect after the conclusion of here and with the proceeds purchase obligations of peace.\" A dispatch cabled from Berlin (by way such governments, these obligations to bear the of Amsterdam), announcing this order, adds that identical rate of interest and the same maturity as it foreshadows also the reform of the Upper Chamber the bonds sold whose proceeds are thus used. If our of the Prussian Diet. In his instructions to the 1424 THE CHRONICLE Chancellor the Kaiser first congratulates the Fatherland on the determination that has remained imperturbable to stake \"their last for the victorious issue.\" The Kaiser declares that while millions \"of our fellow countrymen are in the field, the conflict of opinion behind the front, which is unavoidable in such a far-reaching change in constitution, must be postponed in the highest interests of the Fatherland, until the time of the home-coming of our warriors and when they themselves are able to join in the counsel and the voting on the progress of the new order.\" In brief, the Kaiser's order follows: \"It falls to you, as the responsible Chancellor of the German Empire and First Minister of my Government in Prussia, to assist in obtaining the fulfillment of the demands of this hour by right means and at the right time, and in this spirit shape our political life in order to make room for the free and joyful co-operation of all the members of our people. \"The principles which you have developed in this respect have, as you know, my approval. \"I fell conscious of remaining thereby on the road which my grandfather, the founder of the Empire, as King of Prussia with military organization and as German Emperor with social reform, typically fulfilled as his monarchical obligations, thereby creating conditions by which the German people, in united and wrathful perseverance, will overcome this sanguinary time. The maintenance of the fighting force as a real people's army and the promotion of the social uplift of the people in all its classes was, from the beginning of my reign, my aim. \"In this endeavor, while holding a just balance between the people and the monarchy to serve the welfare of the whole, I am resolved to begin building up our internal political, economic, and social life as soon as the war situation permits.\" How far this concededly hazy promise of reform will appease the popular, growing demand for democratic government remains to be seen. One dispatch from Berlin states that the order means the recognition by the Hohenzollerns that their sovereignty is derived from and sustained by the people, and that the Hohenzollern Kingdom is in effect a sovereignty entrusted to the Hohenzollerns by the Prussian people. It means the acknowledgment of the overthrow of the Kaiser's claim of \"divine\" right. The Kaiser obviously is attempting to gain time. He sees the handwriting on the wall. The overthrow of autocracy in Russia, the obvious spread of democratic tendencies in Austria-Hungary and the demands that are appearing for a popular government throughout the German Empire all seem to be pointing clearly in the direction from which we may expect the first signs of peace of a practical character. The Entente Powers have agreed that they will not recognize the present German military government in peace negotiations. They undoubtedly would welcome the establishment in an honest straightforward way of a democratic government in Germany. In London the Kaiser's message is called one of the biggest jokes of the season. The British public, to quote a dispatch from London, does not see why it will be needed if Prussia is victorious, and knows that if Prussia is defeated, that nothing at all will be accomplished in this direction. The week's military operations on the western war front have been stupendous in force and in extent. There can be no question that the spring offensive,so long awaited, is now in full swing. In other sections' the Allies are awaiting more favoring weather before making the attacks which will virtually include all [VoL. 104. borders of the Central Powers. A violent snowstorm toward the close of the week has compelled the slowing down of the British attack on the Arras-Lens front. Nevertheless the French and British troops have finally joined and will presumably press on together in this zone from now on. The supposed new Hindenburg line has been driven back at a number of positions. About 13,000 prisoners and 80 guns have thus far been taken by the British. Yesterday's operations of Field Marshal Haig marked a sudden striking toward Cambria instead of around Vimy Ridge, which was the scene of the operations during the earlier days of the week. The official report was that he had succeeded in capturing enemy positions \"on a wide front.\" These positions which were captured during the night, extended from Hargicourt to Metz-enCoutre and the British now hold Sart farm, Gauchewood and Gouzeaucourt village. The German official report suggests the belief of their leaders that the force of the new drive has been checked. Major General F. B. Maurice, Chief Director of Military Operations at the British War Office, declared in an interview on Thursday, that the present British offensive was being conducted according to plans completed in February, thereby controverting the claims of the Germans that their retreat has upset the British schedule and that the Teutonic military authorities control the situation. Gen. Maurice's attention was called to the fact that the German military experts were claiming the battle of Arras to be the decisive conflict of the war. He replied, \"I suppose the experts have got to have something to write about, but it is impossible to say at this time that the battle will be the decisive one. It may be stated with certainty, however, that the battle of Arras will have a far-reaching effect.\" There have during the week been several engagements between the Russians and Teutonic allies on the Russian front, but no important changes have resulted. In a number of locations the Teutons have invaded Russian trenches, but in each case they have been evicted. The Austrians on the western portion of the Austro-Italian theatre are actively bombarding the Italians in the Lake Garda and Lagarina valley sectors and the Italian guns are shelling the Austrian lines near Arco and Rovereto. Otherwise the military movements of the week apparently have not been sensational. The operation of the German submarines for the week ending April 8 were not quote as successful as in preceding weeks. There were in all 17 British merchant vessels of more than 1,600 tons sunk and two vessels of less than 1,600 tons. The number of merchant vessels over 100 tons of all nationalities arriving at United Kingdom ports was 2,406, while the departures were 2,367. There were 18 of the large boats sunk during the preceding week and 13 under 1,600 tons. The highest figure in ships of more than 1,600 tons sunk in any week since Feb. 1 was 19, and of the smaller ships 13. The reports show a total of 97 vessels of more than 1,600 tons sunk in the last six weeks and 43 of less than that tonnage. Our own State Department has prepared a tabulation complete to April 3, which shows that during the war submarines have sunk 686 neutral vessels, including 19 American, and have attacked unsuccessfully 79others,including8 American. APR. 14 19174 THE CHRONICLE By an executive order yesterday \"defensive sea areas\" on the coasts of the United States and its insular possessions were officially promulgated as a precautionary measure. These areas may not be crossed at all by any vessel between sunset and sunrise, and at other times only with express permission of the harbor entrance patrol. A vessel arriving off a defensive sea area after sunset shall anchor or lie to at a distance of at least a mile outside its limits until the following sunrise. Vessels discovered near the limits of the areas at night may be fired upon. No vessel shall be permitted to proceed within the limits of a defensive sea area at a greater speed than five knots per hour. The areas specified are: Mouth of Kennebec River, Portland, Me.; Portsmouth, Boston, New Bedford, Newport, Long Island east, New York east, New York main entrance; Delaware River, Chesapeake entrance, Baltimore, Potomac, Hampton Roads, Wilmington, Cape Fear, Savannah, Key West, Tampa, Pensacola, Mobile, Mississippi, Galveston, San Diego, San Francisco, Columbia River, Port Orchard, Honolulu and Manila. 1425 view, as obviously a not inconsiderable part of the demand by the American Government will be on behalf of the Entente Powers. It is proposed that of $5,000,000,000 in United States bonds to be issued, the proceeds of \"not more than $3,000,000,000\" shall be utilized in purchasing bonds of foreign countries. But the purchase money is to remain on our side of the Atlantic until needed for payment of supplies. Nevertheless no important change has been made in British money rates for fixed maturities. The new British war loan closed at 95 1-16, against 95 on Thursday of last week. Tenders were invited yesterday (Friday) for a new offering of £50,000,000 in Treasury bills. • On the London market there has also been a resumption of offerings of Exchequer 5% bonds. These are short-dated maturities—running three or five years. The Exchequer returns for the first week of the fiscal year, which begins April 1, show a revenue of £12,958,000 and an expenditure of £48,090,000. The Exchequer balance of £25,782,000 indicated a decrease of £654,000. Treasury bills outstanding as reported April 10 amounted to £474,388,000. It is understood that until the new American credit becomes available that the British Treasury will continue to carry out its recent plan for requisitioning securities to be used as collateral for exchange. In any event, it is expected that all securities formerly subject to a special tax will be requisitioned. New British capital issues in March amounted to £82,925,000, of which £69,424,000 were bills. An Australian Commonwealth loan of £3,500,000 in 53's has been underwritten this week in London. It runs from five to ten years and is offered at 98, the proceeds to be devoted to public works. The total subscriptions to a recent Australian war loan, according to a dispatch from Melbourne, were £22,400,000. Control of the lead industry in England has been taken over by the Government. All dealings aside from existing contracts are prohibited except under license of the Ministry of Munitions. The London Stock Exchange opened on Tuesday after the Easter holidays with light attendance and a small volume of business. The tone of the security markets, however, was firm, a result of the favoring news developments over the holiday period. These included the passage of the war resolution by our Congress, the formal proclamation of war by President Wilson, the intimations that the Washington Administration's policy included the extension of large credits to the Entente Governments, and, not the least of these influences, the steady progress reported day by day in the British and French drives along the western battle front. As the week advanced the news continued to improve (from the London standpoint); hence the undertone continued strong. London is not basking too freely at the moment upon reports of German negotiations for peace. Reports have reached New York by cable from the British centre that Lloyds were underwriting Dispatches cabled from Paris declare that Presirisks on the duration of the war on the basis of 10 to 1 dent Wilson's address and the declaration of war that the struggle will have ended by July 1.

Notes in circulation were reduced £270,000; hence the total reserve showed an increase of £510,000, and the proportion of reserves to liabilities was advanced to 19.49%, against 19.12% a week ago and 28.75% last year. Public deposits decreased £732,000, and other deposits £105,000. Loans (other securities) were expanded £316,000. Government securities registered a large decline, namely £1,648,000, thus indicating that the Government had been paying off its loans to the Bank. The English Bank's gold holdings now stand at £54,930,993, against £57,922,168 in 1916 and £55,311,986 the year previous. Reserves total £34,750,000. This compares with £42,714,343 one year ago and £39,175,641 in 1915. Loans aggregate £123,625,194. At the corresponding period last year the total was £90,544,951 and in 1915 £137,813,066. The Bank reports as of April 7, the amount of currency notes outstanding at £135,699,350, compared with £130,497,070 last week. The amount of gold held for the redemption of such notes is still £28,500,000.

Other changes were unimportant. Note circulation is now 18,844,127,000 francs. A year ago it was 15,183,959,335 francs, and in 1915 11,500,581,150 francs.

Deposits increased 3,901,943,000 marks, and other liabilities decreased 97,473,000 marks. The German Bank's gold on hand totals 2,530,761,000 marks, as compared with 2,460,100,000 marks one year ago and 2,317,520,000 marks in 1915. Loans and discounts aggregate 13,121,963,000 marks, against 8,124,420,000 marks in 1916 and 6,876,640,000 marks the year previous. Circulation is 8,616,021,000 marks. Last year it was 6,988,080,000 marks and in 1915 5,624,020,000 marks. In local money circles comparatively slight activity is being shown, but it is not unnatural, in view of the huge demands upon funds forecast by the Administration's program for issuing bonds and notes to the amount of $7,000,000,000, that there should be a well-defined disposition toward greater caution on the part of lenders. How soon the Government's demands will become actual factors in the money situation cannot yet be stated. It is presumed that recourse first will be made to the sale of one-year notes, of which $2,000,000,000 are to be authorized. These on maturity are to be paid off from the proceeds of the Government's new scheme of taxation, which has not as yet been definitely arranged. Of the $5,000,000,000 of bonds that are to be authorized, the proceeds of not more than $3,000,000,000 are to be made available for the purchase of similar bonds issued by foreign countries. In this way we are merely lending our credit to these countries, who will pay our Government identically the same interest that is paid to investors on this side. The funds will stay in this country, most probably on deposit with the banks. In this way the huge transaction will be financed with as limited a strain as possible upon the money situation. But $7,000,000,000 is a huge sum, and it would be altogether too enthusiastic a view to expect such a colossal piece of finance to be carried out without producing some degree of strain in money circles. It is thought in banking circles here that our Treasury authorities will be inclined at the beginning to extend substantial aid to Russia in view of.the recent crisis to the Government of that nation and the dislocation of its financial fabric, which must be more or less general. It is to be hoped that the APR. 14 1917.] THE CHRONICLE 1427 1 New York 1 Treasury will not attempt to be too ambitious in its which was also the renewal basis.

It is not easy to imagine in what way Berlin itself might again engage in overtures for peace—though, for that matter, no one would have considered possible, two months before it happened, the \"peace proposal\" actually made on Dec. 12. Whether a popular revolution, unseating the present Hohenzollern dynasty and treating for peace in the name of the German people, is or hereafter will be possible, we do not profess to say. If it were not for the fact that so many events have already happened—notably the Russian overturn—which the world's best judgment would have pronounced incredible a year ago, we should say that a German revolution, even granting the manifest political anger and unrest in Germany, was not to be imagined. The organization of the existing German Government, the attitude towards it which has long been instilled into the German people, and the position of the German army in relation both to Government and people, are very different from what those same conditions were even in Russia. But if these are not to be the auspices under which peace will be restored, there would remain the powerful financial and commercial class of Germany, whose influence with the Government toward peace has alroady been visible even in the face of German victories, whose judgment is formed by looking at.,Germany's position, not next week or next year, but in the longer:future, and whose political power would certainly be vastly increased by the collapse of the military campaign. HERO AND PATRIOT—THE PART OF CONGRESS. A statue of Washington in the nation's Capitol, presented by the Legislature of Virginia, bears an inscription which contains the following characterization: \"Uniting the endowments of the hero, the virtues of the patriot, and exerting both in establishing the liberties of his country.\" This statement of the union of elements necessary to constitute a great man is worthy of particular study;.atIthis time. Hero and patriot. It is noticeable that thei,first President, according to the language, did not unite one quality to the other, but that they werelunited in him. Yet there is a suggestion that, while each may be necessary to enable the world to say here is one supremely constituted for service to his country, a man may be a partiot without enjoying the distinction of being a hero, or being wholly fitted to become one. Though, it may be further inferred, when the liberties of his country are at stake, a man cannot be a hero without being a patriot. Waiving consideration of the implication that there is a measure of contrast between the soldier and civilian, itlis worth while to contemplate, in this day of mighty:presage to the Republi0_some of the duties which follow the possession of \"the virtues of the patriot.\" And, in this our eyes instinctively turn to the Congress. The representatives of the people there assembled are performing the greatest and gravest duties ever entrusted by men to man; and upon them rest the heaviest responsibilities ever borne by public servants. The actual conduct of the war will be directed by the heads of the Army and Navy, but there is an importance to the civil processes behind the campaigns in the field, which cannot be too deeply pondered by the people nor [VoL. 104. too clearly recognized by the national law-making body. For, in the acts of this Congress are bound up not only the lives of the citizens of to-day but the liberties of the generations that are to come. If we go no farther than the contemplated five billion dollar bond issue, as a preliminary expense to be incurred, we discover the widespread influences of the act and the long-continuing effects which follow. Having determined on its necessity, having placed the huge sum at the disposal of the needs of a war chest, there still remains the method. We discuss not now the ability of the country to float the debt at this time—but assert, what everyone realizes, that it is a momentous undertaking in the history of the world,and one which touches in every fibre the conduct, well-being, liberty and life of the people, all the people, of the United States. Under the urgency of necessity, in the light of the possible good which may ensue to mankind, one-half of one per cent in the rate of interest might seem a small matter. It is a tremendous one—not so much as part of fixed charges, but as affecting the savings of the people, the independence and liquidity of banks, the bond markets for State, municipal, railroad and industrial issues, and the conditions of general business, present and to come. And likewise, every step in formulating the tax system is fraught with power and even peril. The illustration serves to show us duties that demand and evidence patriotism of a high order. We do not associate this work with heroism as commonly accepted in war time. No bugle calls to battle, no drawn sword flashes in the forefront, no loved flag is planted in victory on enemy heights— there is only the intensive study of quiet committee room, the slow grind of the legislative mill, and the solemn vote. Yet the liberties of the people are as surely saved or lost here as they are on the firing-line of the field of honor. Patriotism, then, may be evinced by the establishment of the best interests of all the people and the safeguarding of their future energies in legislative halls as well as by service in an army. And it is well that our citizens remember this in the midst of excitement always attendant on a state of war. Naturally, there will be differences of opinion in a large Congress as to methods to be employed. And members must vote their convictions, must use every resource of statesmanship they possess to arrive at conclusions, and must shoulder the responsibility of decision. Shall we not accord to them all, in this trying hour, our full sympathy and support, though their individual votes may not in every instance reflect our personal feelings and judgment? And in doing so, will we not ourselves take on more of that true patriotism which accords to all conscientious thought, all solemn and sacred effort, all righteous deeds, the \"virtues of the patriot,\" the defense of liberty, and the love of country? We venture to carry our query one point farther into the civil life of the people. There are trying days ahead. We shall all of us reflect deeply, according to our abilities, upon passing events. But, avoiding acrimonious debate and personal criticism, shall we not prove ourselves partiots by according to our fellows a full measure of patriotism, until they are false to the trust? On the river of life there are the glancing ripples of sunshine and the tumultuous waves of storm, but the currents which bear them toward the ocean of rest and peace are as silent as they are strong.

In war financing, we need to guard against a tooheroic feeling for cumulative current taxation. The country is already heavily taxed, and we should discountenance the growing notion that taxation can be anything but financial blood-letting. It tends to exhaust, and to dry up the sources from which taxes are obtainable. The politician is rarely a man in actual business, and what he is slowest to appreciate is that business is already very heavily burdened (the uncertainties of the future in every respect being not the lightest part of the burden) so that there is danger of weakening ourselves, financially, by too drastic additional levy upon incomes and profits. Nor is there any sound reason why we should hesitate to transmit to posterity a due share in the financial burden of the service we are doing (as we hope) in laying permanent foundations which war will not disturb. Future generations receive what we transmit to them; they should share cost as well as benefit, and if we weaken ourselves by too much present chivalry we may even lessen the wealth they receive. We may also overestimate the part which our gold and our banking reserves properly bear in the abundance we seem to possess. We cannot eat gold, or clothe or warm ourselves with it. Give imagination the extreme flight of supposing that everything on the globe except our stocks of gold and other forms of money suddenly disappeared; we should be in the plight of Midas, doomed to perish before we could find means of subsistence to carry us along to ONE WAY OF RENDERING SERVICE TO THE another harvest.
