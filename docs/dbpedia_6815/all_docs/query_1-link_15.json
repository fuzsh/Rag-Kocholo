According to the 14 Jan 1927 and 28 Jan 1927 issues of Motion Picture News, desert sequences were filmed in El Segundo, CA, and ocean sequences were filmed in San Diego, CA, on the steamship, Yale. The production also featured a menagerie comprised of sheep, goats, camels, donkeys, horses, snakes, and Hines’s pet parrot, Loretta, who, according to the 12 Jan 1927 NYDN, was insured for $100,000. In addition, that same article claimed that Hines planned to marry his leading lady, Edna Murphy. She did marry later that year, but to director Mervyn LeRoy.\n\nAn article in the 29 Jan 1927 Moving Picture World recounted a scene, reportedly directed by Hines, in which a lion was transferred from a truck into a wooden cage. Although the approximately fifty onlookers expected the lion to quickly break out of the flimsy structure, he instead began digging in a nearby sandheap, disabling several cameras with flying debris. Hines was quickly aware of the lion’s “dramatic possibilities” and ordered the remaining cameras to continue shooting. After the scene was completed, C. C. Burr complained that he paid an exorbitant $1,000 to rent the lion, when he could have acquired many lesser specimens for $200, although he did admire the animal’s “quick” performance. The close of production was announced in the 12 Feb 1927 Exhibitors Herald. C. C. Burr later told the 25 Feb 1927 edition that he planned to cut the ten-reel picture to five and one half reels with the help of preview screenings, where he could determine what footage was expendable. The decision was prompted by an announcement from distributor First National Pictures, Inc., claiming that the public and exhibitors were demanding shorter films with “faster action.”\n\nOn 1 Apr 1927, Motion Picture News reported that the feature had recently been previewed at the Bunny Theatre in New York City. It was considered a departure from previous Johnny Hines productions, in that he established “a distinct character,” which he maintained throughout, “making a more sympathetic and cohesive story.” Peter Milne was credited with writing the subtitles.\n\nThe 6 May 1927 Motion Picture News stated that the song, “All Aboard (for a Camel Ride),” was written by Hines’s publicist, Herbert Crooker, along with composer John Milton Hagen, to coincide with the film’s release. The planned cover design would feature Hines in character.\n\nAll Aboard was released on 8 May 1927, preceded by an 18 Apr 1927 opening at the Hippodrome in New York City, and on 24 Apr 1927 at the Tower Theatre in Chicago, IL.\n\nAn unrelated short subject starring Harold Lloyd was released in 1917.\n\nThe National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) included this film on its list of Lost U.S. Silent Feature Films as of October 2019.\n\nLess"
