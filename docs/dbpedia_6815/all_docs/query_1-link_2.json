        "meta_description": "A 44-Calibre Mystery: Directed by Fred Kelsey. With Harry Carey, Claire Du Brey, Frank MacQuarrie, Vester Pegg. \"Bow-Legged\" Billy Jenson, Sheriff of Driftwood, declares for law and order. Kitty Flanders, daughter of a pioneer prospector whose wife is dead, falls in love with him. The Sheriff, fearless in all things else, is timid when it comes to love-making. A masked bandit, believed to be \"Lone Jack,\" holds up the stagecoach near Flap-Jack. A cowboy, riding in the distance, sees the robbery and reports it to Deputy Sheriff Horton. The bandit is Pete McGuire. McGuire returns to Driftwood. Deputy Horton also arrives in Driftwood seeking the robber. Seeing McGuire, the Deputy watches him. Kitty goes to the store for groceries, where Pete McGuire watches her admiringly. Sheriff Billy Jenson is watching Pete suspiciously. Pete surmises that Kitty and the Sheriff are sweethearts. A rough-neck drunk approaches Kitty and insults her. Pete McGuire interferes, and plays the \"hero.\" Kitty permits Pete to walk home with her, much to the discomfiture of the Sheriff. That night the Sheriff and his deputy, Horton, compare notes and become convinced Pete is the bandit. Horton insists on the right to capture Pete unaided. One of the saloon habitues over- hears their plan, and \"tips\" Pete. The latter hides in a deserted outhouse, but is loath to leave camp, as he wants to obtain Flanders' mine. The following morning Pete sees Flanders on his way to the mine and follows him. Deputy Horton sees Pete and follows him. Flanders discovers that he is being followed and hides behind a rock, gun drawn. Pete also hides, knowing that it is Horton who is after him. Both Flanders and Pete are taking aim at Horton when the latter comes upon Flanders. Before Flanders or Horton can realize their mutual mistake, Flanders and Horton have both fired. Flanders believes the second shot (the one fired by Pete) is the echo of his own. Horror-stricken, he believes he has unintentionally killed the deputy. Pete confronts him and encourages the mistake. He tells Flanders he is likely to be hanged by the vigilantes. Pete agrees to seal his lips if Flanders will deed Pete one-half of the mine and \"fix it\" for him to marry Kitty. Flanders confesses to his daughter that he killed Horton. Pete woos Kitty and her father pleads with Kitty to look with favor on his courtship. Billy, the sheriff, has no evidence on Pete. He is therefore compelled to step aside and allow the man he believes is a bandit to woo his sweetheart. Kitty and Pete are to be married, and she is forced to tell Billy, she loves Pete. Pete tells the boys to defy the sheriff. They start a rough house. Billy tells them to be- have or leave town. It is now a show-down. The sheriff is about to draw his gun, but his love for Kitty still checks him. Flanders learns that Kitty is heartbroken over her prospective marriage. He decides to save her, and to make clean breast of everything to the sheriff. He does so. Billy is amazed and says, \"You're crazy; the bullet that killed Horton was a .44 steel-jacket. Your gun shoots a .38 soft-nose.\" Flanders is amazed and recalls the \"echo.\" The sheriff tells Flanders it was the \"echo\" that killed Horton. He decides to take Pete's gun away from him and examine it. Kitty has admitted that she hates Pete and loves Billy, so Billy now has a clear road to kill or capture Pete. Everyone in camp believes that he is afraid of Pete. Billy enters the saloon, walks up to Pete, and quietly lifts the gun from Pete's holster, confirming his suspicions that Pete's is a .44 hard-nose. A gun battle ensues and Pete is slain.",
