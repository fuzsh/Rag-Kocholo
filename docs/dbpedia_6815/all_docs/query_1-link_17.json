        "text": "Rudolph Valentino's filmography, like so many other players in the silent era, can be very problematic. Several bit or extra appearances simply cannot be verified because the films are presumed lost. Unless a still or a fragment of film shows up with Valentino clearly visible, some entries must be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nCurrently, I am in the process of trying to track down the exact source for some long accepted/referenced entries, i.e, My Official Wife, etc. IMDB aside, Battle of the Sexes and My Official Wife appear to be false entries.\n\nUnlike IMDB, you will not see The Hooded Falcon listed as part of Valentino's filmography. As much as Valentino wanted to make it, the film was not produced. While he did pose for costume photos (in 1924), and preliminary production designs were being worked on (in 1926). Not an inch of film was ever shot.\n\nOtherwise, if you find errors, please contact me and I will make the appropriate corrections.\n\n*Film is considered to be lost\n\n**Film is available on DVD or Blu-Ray\n\nThe Battle of the Sexes* (1914) – Majestic Motion Picture Company.
