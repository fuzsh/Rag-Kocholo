        "text": "The Shape of Water is a dramatic, romantic, fantasy, horror film, which is an odd mashup of genres. It’s the horror aspects that provide the shock value, and this borders on offensive for me. I hated Guillermo del Toro’s prior film Pan’s Labyrinth for this very reason. “Hate” is a strong word and one I wouldn’t apply to many (if any) other movies, but Pan’s Labyrinth is a rare film that made me angry when I left the theatre. I will never see it again under any circumstances, because it offered up a rich and dark children’s fairytale, then lurched into torture-porn horror. It was disgustingly graphic, and you don’t get to jerk me around like that. It isn’t amusing, appropriate, relevant, entertaining, interesting, or visionary. It’s actually repugnant and perverted to “go there” with a fantasy story told from a child’s point of view. That’s abusive filmmaking on a psychological level. I’m not desensitized enough to give it a pass, either. The only reason I bothered to see The Shape of Water was that it won the Oscar for Best Picture, and I was told in advance that the horror wasn’t (quite) as graphic. Plus, this wasn’t a child-oriented tale, which makes a world of difference.\n\nThe Shape of Water is a good film, and del Toro is a skilled director, but once again, we have gratuitous graphic horror. It’s used sparingly this time, as an adolescent prank to elicit cheap thrills from audiences and Oscar-voters alike, who apparently must be shaken awake by over-the-top violence, if you buy into del Toro’s mindset, in order to make them feel an emotional punch. The film is powerful enough without these moments. Personally, I don’t need to see a man dragged on the ground like a bowling ball by the bullet holes in his face or another man tear off two of his own stinking, gangrenous fingers and toss them onto a living-room rug.\n\nThe Shape of Water plays like an upscaled, A-list reimagining of The Creature from the Black Lagoon. Everything has been raised a notch in this interpretation, not just the darker elements. It’s the romance and sexual awakening, the humor, the dramatic tension, the intrigue—and yes, the writing, direction, acting, and all other aspects of filmmaking. It’s clear del Toro loves classic movies, and he gives us central characters who love them as well. The Shape of Water is a Fox film, so we see musical clips of many old stars from the 20th Century Fox roster, including Betty Grable, Sonja Henie, Alice Faye, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, Shirley Temple, and Carmen Miranda. During one sublime, black-and-white dream sequence, an entire set has been reconstructed to emulate RKO’s Follow the Fleet, starring Fred and Ginger. There is much to admire and savor here. It may sound like I’m talking about several different films, but I’m not. It’s all from the same movie.\n\nThe story takes place in 1962 Baltimore. Elisa Esposito (Oscar-nominee Sally Hawkins) is a mute who works as a cleaning woman for a government lab facility with her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer, also nominated). Elisa has been mute as long as she can remember. She was found by the river when she was a baby, with a trio of slash wounds on her neck, and she communicates through sign language. Elisa lives in an apartment above a movie theatre, next door to an aging commercial artist named Giles (Oscar-nominee Richard Jenkins). Giles is the one who introduces Elisa to classic movies and movie stars while he paints illustrations for magazine ads—a dying art form in the era of photography. With a self-deprecating sense of humor, Giles is also a cat-lover and closet homosexual who has great difficulty playing the corporate game and relating to others.\n\nEnter Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), the villain of this piece. He transfers in to take charge of a top-secret “asset” acquired from a South American river. His team’s mission is to study this creature for potential use in the space race against Russia. While cleaning at work, Elisa discovers that this trapped, rare amphibian (Doug Jones) has humanlike qualities and can communicate with her through sign language. She also learns that Strickland has been torturing the creature in order to tame it and dominate it. Among Strickland’s assembled scientists is Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), who is actually a Soviet spy named Dimitri, posing as a German doctor. Hoffstetler discovers the growing bond between Elisa and the amphibian man, and he is fascinated by it.\n\nLater, Strickland welcomes five-star Air Force General Frank Hoyt (Nick Searcy) and updates him on their lack of progress, recommending they vivisect the “asset” to learn how it can breathe on land as well as in water. When Hoffstetler, in turn, relays this information to his Russian superiors, he is ordered to euthanize the creature immediately to prevent the Americans from learning more.\n\nMeanwhile, Elisa, Giles, and Zelda plot to rescue the amphibian man and bring him to Elisa’s apartment. Hoffstetler discovers this plan, and, breaking away from his mission, he helps them by providing the necessary minerals to supplement a bathtub full of saltwater. It’s where the creature will be kept for the time being until he can be released a few days later into a canal that feeds into the ocean whenever it rains. General Hoyt then shows up in Strickland’s office and gives him just 36 hours to retrieve the creature, or his military career and life will be over.\n\nAfter eating the head off of one of Giles’ cats, the creature escapes but doesn’t make it further than the movie theatre downstairs. When he returns to the apartment, all is forgiven, which is somewhat out of character for an austere cat-lover like Giles. As a gesture of good will, the creature puts his webbed hand on Giles’s balding head, then moves it to some accidental cuts on his arm. By morning, the wounds have completely healed, and Giles’s hair is growing. At this point, Elisa and the amphibian man have fallen in love and have sex in her flooded bathroom.\n\nThe rest of the story is a race against time to escape from the bad guy. In truth, this is a teal-tinted “beauty and the beast” tale that challenges our interpretations of both beauty and beast. It’s about the “freaks” among us, the different ones trying to survive and find their way to a safe and peaceful existence. That’s why this film resonates. It isn’t just the amphibian man who is struggling to breathe, it’s Elisa, Giles, Zelda, and Hoffstetler—the ones who don’t fit the normal mold and can’t accept their current environment as the solution.\n\nThere’s a lot to love about this movie even though the graphic horror repels me. It’s a solid choice for the Academy’s top award and only the second film in either the fantasy or horror genres to win Best Picture (after The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and The Silence of the Lambs, respectively). I look forward to revisiting it in the future.\n\nThe Shape of Water\n\nDirector Guillermo del Toro Primary Cast Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Doug Jones, David Hewlett, Nick Searcy Familiar Faces none (no repeat performers from the previous winning films) Firsts None to speak of Total Wins 4 (Picture, Director, Production Design, Score) Total Nominations 13 (Picture, Director, Actress: Sally Hawkins, Supporting Actor: Richard Jenkins, Supporting Actress: Octavia Spencer, Screenplay: Original, Cinematography, Production Design, Costume Design, Editing, Sound: Editing, Sound: Mixing, Score) Viewing Format Blu-ray Disc\n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) plays on the screen like a Fellini movie shot in English. With its bungled brackets, the provocative title even seems translated, or perhaps it harkens back to melodramas from the 1890s. Mild spoiler: the misused parenthetical subheading is a quoted theatrical review written by one of the characters late in the plot. Birdman is pretty jarring at first, and it takes several scenes to get into its surreal style. I imagine this extended period of adjustment would put off as many as it impresses. Anyone who has seen Federico Fellini’s 8½ from 1963 a half-century ago should recognize parallels in storytelling, concept, protagonist, tone, and subject matter. That’s a whole lot of parallels. Both Birdman and 8½ are centered around an exalted artist in the throes of midlife crisis. Both men are trying to stay relevant and live up to the expectations of past successes, and both are struggling with their latest creative project. But 8½ gets more right than Birdman, particularly in maintaining its tone. I can’t come down too hard on Birdman for evoking an Italian masterpiece, but it stumbles en route, and that’s a shame.\n\nWhile Fellini was working on his film, he taped a note on the camera so he could see it at all times. It said—in Italian, one might assume—”Remember, this is a comedy,” and therein lies the secret ingredient and the fundamental difference between these two films. Birdman has plenty of laughs but ultimately takes itself too seriously. With the story of a narcissistic artist nearing the final desperate phase of midlife crisis, a precarious tightrope is walked, requiring a good dose of self-deprecation for audiences to stay with it. If the principal character is drowning in his own pity for the duration and not all that likable to begin with, laughter is the gateway to keep us engaged. Everyone, on and off screen, needs to be in on the “joke,” or indifference will set in—and possibly repulsion. I find myself invested in Birdman for the most part, perhaps due to my love of theatre and backstage stories, not to mention Fellini. I’m rooting for the protagonist, but I’m also turned off by much of his behavior. The setup and surrounding characters are humorous to a point but also pathetic, grating, and mean-spirited when all is said and done.\n\nThe story takes place in and around a Broadway theatre (the St. James, to be specific). Riggan Thomson (Oscar-nominee Michael Keaton) is a movie star and household name, revered for playing a superhero known as Birdman in a hit trilogy from the early 1990s. Keaton’s prior experience as Batman is the obvious art-imitating-life meta connection. It’s been over 20 years since Riggan last donned his “bird suit,” but he is perpetually tormented by his own raspy voice in the role mocking and criticizing his every move. He also fancies himself with the ability to levitate while he meditates, possessing telekinetic powers whenever he’s alone. With his film career on the skids, Riggan has decided to write, direct, and star in a stage adaptation of Raymond Carver’s short story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. What’s missing in general is a sense of folly. When Guido Contini has panic attacks in 8½, they’re often funny, farcical, or poignant, but when Riggan Thomson panics, he is angry, selfish, and vindictive, making me wonder why I should care about him or his situation.\n\nThe supporting characters supply comedic moments as well but are equally repugnant and self-centered. They take themselves as seriously as Riggan does, which is unfortunate. Emma Stone and Edward Norton both received Oscar nominations and deliver fine work. I’m not sure how much I should be amused by an attempted rape on stage in front of a live audience, or replacing a fake gun with a real loaded one, or Tweeting a photo of a parent’s disfigured face, hoping it’ll go viral. It’s ugly humor, and if it’s meant to be satire, the tone is off and a point isn’t made.\n\nDirector Alejandro G. Iñárritu presents Birdman in extended, (seemingly) uncut takes. While it gives immediacy to any film attempting this approach, it’s also botched here. These sustained sequences don’t unfold in real-time as with Hitchcock’s Rope or Mendes’s 1917. They often skip ahead quite abruptly. A long, involved tracking shot that follows a character down a backstage corridor and out onto a busy street suddenly jumps from day to night, or a lengthy scene during rehearsals shifts in an instant to a preview performance in front of a live audience. I’m not sure what the director is attempting to do here, other than experiment with various cinematic devices. Seamless shots in movies can be used quite effectively to alter the passage of time (see the iconic, slow pan around the sunken vessel in Titanic that ends with a fully restored ship), but combining this idea with a real-time scene is confusing. It becomes a derailed, stream-of-conscious narrative that doesn’t convey much, other than visual prowess. These leaps of logic aren’t limited to time; plenty can be found in the plot and character motivations as well. Iñárritu also utilizes a solo jazz drummer for a majority of the score, which is effective but agitating and annoying when it’s overused. I guess it suits the characters.\n\nThere’s one scene in a nearby bar that packs a resonating wallop, and it’s the best in the movie. Riggan encounters a major theatre critic named Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan), who informs him that she intends to bury him and his play in a scathing review before she’s even seen it. Tabitha hates everything about him and everything he represents as a schlocky movie star. She despises him for trespassing on her hallowed ground—the world of the theatre. These two characters lock horns, deconstruct, and decimate each other, and the tone grows decidedly dark. Their heated exchange is more in line with the psychological sparring found in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and it works quite well. Perhaps it would resonate even more if nearly every other scene didn’t also end in a narcissistic spiral. As it stands, the impact is diminished.\n\nOverall, I enjoy Birdman. I admire the ambitious effort and the talent involved, but it stumbles so often with what it wants to be or say that I can’t consider it “best” in any respect.\n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\n\nDirector Alejandro G.

It’s also the ideal companion to Gone with the Wind, offering a much-needed antidote to the all-too-commonly romanticized vision of the Old South. Gone are the rose-colored glasses and golden gilt. What we’re left with is a realistic, eye-witness account that isn’t told from the perspective of a fictional White person; instead, it’s based on an actual 1853 memoir by Solomon Northup, a free, Northern, Black musician who was kidnapped and sold into slavery for more than a decade. It recounts his horrifying journey from free Northerner to plantation slave to free man once more. Through Solomon’s eyes, we experience the brutal, systematic torture of African Americans who were treated as property and savages in this nation during the mid-1800s.\n\nNorthup is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, and he delivers a moving central performance. Working as a violinist and living in Saratoga Springs, New York, with his wife (Kelsey Scott) and young children (Quvenzhané Wallis and Cameron Zeigler), he is offered a job in Washington, D.C., by two White men (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) who end up drugging his wine at dinner shortly after their arrival. Solomon wakes up in a slave pen, completely disoriented. Despite his freedom, he receives a brutal beating before he is transferred on a ship with several other captured Black men, women, and children to a port in New Orleans. A slave trader (Paul Giamatti) invents a new identity and name for him. Solomon will be known as “Platt,” a runaway slave from Georgia, and he is told that if he wants to remain alive, he won’t let anyone know he is a free man from the North who can read and write.\n\nNorthup is sold to William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who takes a liking to his new slave once he realizes he is educated and cultured. This infuriates the overseer John Tibeats (Paul Dano), who sets out to teach Northup a lesson. During an attempted whipping, Northup strikes back and beats the overseer. Tibeats and two others try to lynch him in retaliation, and Northup barely survives by standing on his toes for hours, supporting just enough of his own weight to breathe, before being cut loose by his master. Ford is forced to sell Northup to save his life. When Northup confesses his freedom, Ford, who owes a large debt for buying him, refuses to listen or do anything about it. Northup is sold to Edwin Epps (Oscar-nominee Micahel Fassbender), a sadistic, drunken monster with a small cotton plantation.\n\nNorthup soon meets Patsey (Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o in her powerful screen debut). She is the master’s favorite who can pick twice as much cotton as any slave—man or woman. Patsey is raped on a regular basis by Epps, whose jealous wife Mary (Sarah Paulson) is well aware of her husband’s “unnatural” interest in the woman. Mary often humiliates and physically harms Patsey in front of everyone, demanding that she be sold, but Epps refuses in defiance. The performances by Fassbender and Paulson as a warring couple who take out their aggressions on Patsey are truly frightening and deeply disturbing.\n\nAfter an infestation of worms destroys much of the season’s crop, Epps leases several of his slaves to Judge Turner (Bryan Batt) on a neighboring plantation. Turner discovers Northup’s talent on the fiddle and allows him to play at a party and keep his own earnings. Northup eventually returns to Epps’s farm and uses the money to pay a White field hand to mail a letter he’s written over time and in secret to his friends in New York. The field hand betrays him to Epps, and it’s only through clever thinking that Northup convinces Epps not to kill him. Northup then burns the letter, fearing Epps would eventually discover it.\n\nA while later, Patsey visits Harriet Shaw (Alfre Woodard), her new friend on a neighboring plantation. Harriet is the mistress of her White master. She lives in the house and is treated with “privilege,” unlike anything Patsey has seen. And it’s returning from one of these secret getaways that Patsey is caught by her own master. This leads to the film’s darkest and most brutal scene. Patsey has a small cake of soap with her, a private gift from Harriet, because Mary Epps has been refusing to let her bathe with any soap, hoping the foul stench will keep her husband away. At the taunting and ridcule of his wife, Epps orders Northup to punish Patsey by whipping her, but the drunken Epps soon takes over and nearly beats her to death. I can barely watch this scene as the skin comes off Patsey’s back and the blood and flesh fly from her naked body. It’s the most graphic whipping scene I’ve ever seen, made all the more heart-wrenching and horrifying by the strong acting from Nyong’o, Fassbender, and Ejiofor.\n\nAt some point in the future, while working on the construction of a gazebo near the main house, Northup meets a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt). Bass’s strong faith and open disdain for the mistreatment of Epps’s slaves leads Northup to once more confess about his kidnapping and hidden status as a free man. He asks for Bass’s help getting a letter to New York. Bass is hesitant, due to the enormous risk involved, but ultimately he agrees.\n\nWhile Northup is working in the fields one day, we see a carriage pull up with the local sheriff and another man that Northup recognizes from his past. It’s Mr. Parker (Rob Steinberg), a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga Springs. Through a series of questions, along with Parker’s personal confirmation, “Platt” is positively identified as Solomon Northup, a free man. Northup bids an emotional farewell to Patsey. And as the enraged Epps protests and tries to prevent the men from leaving, Northup rides off, away from the plantation and from his twelve-year existence as an enslaved human.\n\nThe final scene of this film makes me sob. It’s the awakening from a nightmare that can never be shaken or fully resolved. Northup arrives on the doorstep of his home and reintroduces himself to his wife, his grown son and daughter, and his daughter’s husband and their new baby. He humbly apologizes to his family for being away while they do their best to comfort him. The title cards at the end tell us how Northup unsuccessfully sued the men who captured and sold him into slavery and how his published memoir helped further the abolitionist movement. It also informs us of the lack of information or any details surrounding Northup’s death and burial—something I find unsettling and tragic. While there is speculation he was captured and sold back into slavery, this theory is unlikely, due to his age and “undesirable worth” to the market at that time. Northup lectured for a few years, but based on recovered records in connection with his daughter’s obituary, it’s probable he died a broken, penniless, and forgotten man. I wonder what he would think of his place in history today and the significance of his well-documented journey.\n\n12 Years a Slave is an important story to tell, just as it was in 1853 when Northup’s book was first published. History is interpreted from many perspectives, but a great disservice is done by glossing over the truth and hiding facts about America’s beginnings as a nation. I’m grateful this film was made by so many talented people whose main goal was to keep Northup’s story alive. With expert direction, writing, and acting, plus all technical and artistic aspects of filmmaking, 12 Years a Slave is a most worthy choice for Best Picture of the year.\n\n12 Years a Slave\n\nDirector Steve McQueen Primary Cast Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong’o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt, Alfre Woodard, Scoot McNairy, Taran Killam, Bryan Batt, Quvenzhané Wallis, Bill Camp Familiar Faces Scoot McNairy from Argo Firsts First Best Picture directed and co-produced by a Black filmmaker (Steve McQueen), first movie to win Best Picture from a Black screenwriter (John Ridley), feature film debut of Lupita Nyong’o Total Wins 3 (Picture, Supporting Actress: Lupita Nyong’o, Screenplay: Adapted) Total Nominations 9 (Picture, Director, Actor: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Supporting Actor: Michael Fassbender, Supporting Actress: Lupita Nyong’o, Screenplay: Adapted, Production Design, Costume Design, Editing) Viewing Format Blu-ray Disc\n\n“D. It is written.”\n\nI had a roadblock to overcome when I first saw Slumdog Millionaire, and it had nothing to do with India, a cultural divide, or the first entirely non-White principal cast ever in a Best Picture–winner. That’s all wonderful to me, and I love a good, compelling story with characters and locations that are fresh to my eyes and experiences. The problem? I don’t much care for gameshows, and they were booming during the first part of this century. What started with Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune expanded to include The Weakest Link and a slew of others. They had moved from innocuous sick-day fodder on daytime TV to primetime ratings champs. Networks around the globe embraced the trend, because it was cheap, compared to producing expensive dramas or comedies with big-budget stars, writers, directors, sets, costumes, locations, etc. But the idea of framing this story or any story around Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was a gigantic turnoff to me. I had an allergic reaction before the lights dimmed, and even hearing that overplayed theme music a few times made my skin crawl. It felt phony and forced, just like the show itself.\n\nFortunately, this invasion has waned in the years since, although reality TV itself is still lurking. Most of those offerings are gameshows in disguise anyway, with big prizes, giddy winners, and bitter losers. “Reality” is nowhere to be found, and it’s a bore to me. My point is that each time I see this movie, I like it better, especially now that I’m not inundated by the trendy genre on a daily basis. I’ve gotten over my gameshow blues and even come to enjoy the surreal setting for this incredible journey about a dirt-poor boy from the slums of Mumbai and his public chance to become independently wealthy for life.\n\nThe plot is compelling from the start, with 18-year-old Jamal (Dev Patel) poised to win 20 million rupees if he can correctly answer the final question on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? He must “come back tomorrow” to sit in the hot seat one last time, but as he exits the studio, Jamal is forcibly detained and then tortured by the police who suspect him of cheating. The inspector (Irrfan Khan) and his sidekick constable (Saurabh Shukla) assert that it isn’t possible for a kid from the slums with almost no education to guess every answer up to this point. They pop a VHS tape of prior broadcasts into a player, and it’s from their systematic interrogation that we are taken through each question in sequential order and come to learn about Jamal’s life.\n\nAs a five-year-old living in the Dharavi slums, Jamal (now played by Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) learns to read in school with his older brother Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail). Jamal is determined to obtain a celebrated Bollywood star’s autograph, no matter what, and after his brother plays a prank on him, Jamal escapes his temporary imprisonment in an outhouse by wading through the cesspit underneath. A spiteful Salim later steals and sells the autograph for his own profit. When their mother is killed during a sudden political uprising, Jamal and Salim find themselves orphaned and homeless. They wander the streets searching for food and shelter and meet a homeless girl their age named Latika (Rubina Ali). According to Jamal, they are the “Three Musketeers” now—Athos, Porthos, and … Jamal can’t remember the third musketeer’s name.\n\nThe rest of Jamal’s story revolves around this trio’s relationship. They encounter harrowing and horrifying experiences as they are separated and reunited throughout their young lives. At times, it feels like a Dickens novel with dark glimpses from a child protagonist’s perspective into the city’s criminal underworld. Each flashback is cued by another question during the gameshow. For example, we learn the reason why Jamal knows that Benjamin Franklin is on the American hundred-dollar bill.\n\nThree actors play each of the three main characters at various stages of development, and all are excellent, particularly Dev Patel, who was overlooked by the Academy for a Supporting Actor nomination. What we come to learn, as the plot unfolds, is just how deeply in love Jamal is with Latika. He doesn’t care whether he wins or loses on the final question, as long as they can be together. Their love is his “grand prize.”\n\nThis movie does have faults, particularly with the sequence of questions paralleling the development of his life. I might be able to suspend disbelief that Jamal could know the answers, but I can’t swallow that each question is offered in perfect chronological order to coincide with his personal experience. In the end, my skepticism is vanquished by the terrific performances, an unapologetic romance, and a full-scale Bollywood musical number with a chorus of dancers to cap off the film. Slumdog Millionaire is the reimagined Cinderella story that introduced me to an unfamiliar way of life and social setting. I’m overwhelmed and moved by the extreme hardships depicted, but I am equally blown away by the indomitable spirit in Jamal. He doesn’t give up and ultimately doesn’t care about a “big prize.” In the end, it’s love that wins the game.\n\nOn a personal note, the actors playing the children were chosen from the slums of India. Their salaries were put in trusts for them by the director and studio. I was comforted to learn this, but even more surprised the day after the Oscar telecast when this movie won eight awards. I headed off to Disneyland early the next morning with friends visiting from out of town. As we made our way through the rides and attractions, I spotted the entire cast of children from this film as they were led around the park on a VIP tour. What an incredible experience to go from life in the slums, to acting in a film, to flying out to Hollywood for a globally televised event, only to have all of this topped by a guided tour through “the happiest place on earth.” I caught sight of these kids on several occasions throughout the day. At one point, they were right in front of me on the Indiana Jones ride. Based on their smiles and enthusiasm, they seemed to be having the best time. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. Sometimes fate intervenes and deals you an unimaginable, improbable hand.\n\nSlumdog Millionaire\n\nDirector Danny Boyle Primary Cast Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Madhur Mittal, Anil Kapoor, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Tanay Chheda, Rubina Ali, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, Irrfan Khan, Saurabh Shukla, Mahesh Manjrekar, Ankur Vikal Familiar Faces none (no repeat performers from the previous winning films) Firsts First Best Picture featuring an entirely non-White principal cast, first Best Picture to be shot digitally, first and only Best Picture to have two songs nominated Total Wins 8 (Picture, Director, Screenplay: Adapted, Cinematography, Editing, Sound: Mixing, Score, Song: “Jai Ho”) Total Nominations 10 (Picture, Director, Screenplay: Adapted, Cinematography, Editing, Sound: Editing, Sound: Mixing, Score, Song: “Jai Ho,” Song: “O Saya”) Viewing Format Blu-ray Disc\n\nMy experience with Titanic is far from typical, so let me explain up front. When this movie was in production, my closest friend at the time was in the film industry. She had been a star at Warner Bros. in the 1940s and was an active, voting member of the Academy. She also lived in the same elegant condo-complex off the Sunset Strip with two established actors who were cast in Titanic. I knew them myself, through her, and I remember when they “disappeared” for an extended period of time while working on this film at the newly constructed Fox studios in Baja California, Mexico. Their reports back were questionable, to say the least. They seemed frustrated, and the shoot was taking forever. Months went by, and they were forced to turn down work, because they were “stuck” filming this endless movie. When they did surface again in California, they didn’t know what to make of it. We joked that it was either going to be the biggest hit or the biggest flop ever. There would be no in-between.\n\nJump ahead by several months to the initial press screenings and pre-publicity … I had been palling around with a handful of up-and-coming film critics and magazine writers who were good friends. Most of them had seen Titanic a month or so prior to its release. None of them cared for it, and some hated it. They mostly agreed that it was a colossal pile of nothing and would go down in history as a major bomb. One sort of liked “the old lady” (Gloria Stuart), but that was about it. They thought it might win a technical Oscar or two, for effects and design … maybe. They also remarked how James Cameron had run amok with unrealistic creative demands while the budget hemorrhaged so badly that 20th Century Fox gave up domestic distribution rights in order to secure enough funds from Paramount to finish the film.\n\nYou can imagine, with all of this as a “backstory,” how I might have felt when I halfheartedly decided to check it out on opening day. I went by myself to the first screening at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre (I still and will always call it that). The audience was a respectable size for around ten o’clock in the morning, but by no means was it “sold out.” Let’s say more than half full. The lights went down, I let out a “well, here goes” sigh, and the film began.\n\nI wasn’t prepared for what I experienced. I was transported under the sea to the expedition of the actual wreckage. Plenty of documentaries were surfacing on television around this time about the ship’s sinking, and I had watched a few of them. I knew a good bit of the history but certainly not all. I remember being pulled in so completely when the camera tracked around the decaying vessel with its rusted railings, and by the time the arc had finished, I was looking at a fully restored ship. It was breathtaking, and something that hadn’t been possible in a film until major breakthroughs in technology (via Digital Domain) had caught up to the creative vision.\n\nAfter the modern scenes establish a treasure hunt for a missing necklace that features a jewel called the Heart of the Ocean, which is “worth more than the Hope Diamond,” much of this story happens in flashback. It’s told from the perspective of 100-year-old Rose, portrayed by 1930s star Gloria Stuart, and in younger days by Kate Winslet, marking the first time in history that two actresses were nominated for playing the same character in the same movie. The first half of the film is what I’ve heard referred to as a “200-million-dollar chick flick.” A massively expensive, period romance. A love triangle between first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), her millionaire fiancé Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and a vagabond artist named Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Everything around them is the epitome of early 20th-century refinement and luxury, but Rose feels trapped in a life she never wanted or asked for.\n\nAfter Jack saves her life, the two fall in love and make plans to escape together once the ship docks. Cal transitions from an overbearing, jilted fiancé into a dangerous adversary. This “setup” leads to the inevitable moment when they strike the iceberg, and it’s to Cameron’s credit that I’m so invested in the plot, I’ve almost forgotten the ship is going down.\n\nThis movie then surges in the blink of an eye from an intriguing romance into a full-on action film. Cameron once again demonstrates his proven ability to trigger adrenaline with audiences, and he’s definitely at home here. The foundering vessel’s “ticking clock” sets the stage for a life-and-death chase between Cal with his manservant named Lovejoy (David Warner) and the fleeing lovebirds.\n\nTitanic is similar in structure to another Best Picture–winner Gone with the Wind. Both are fictional romances and love triangles that use factual, catastrophic events as their settings. Neither historic backdrop overtakes the human narrative, however. We follow the main characters and their struggles without getting lost in a documentarian’s checklist of details. These aren’t history lessons, in other words, although Titanic gets more right than Wind. Cameron strives to depict the sinking as accurately as possible, and it shows in every frame.\n\nThe images are staggering and often devastating. I still become emotional watching the Strauses as they clutch each other in bed while the water rushes in around them, or when an Irish woman from third class tells her children a calming bedtime story for the last time, or when Benjamin Guggenheim emerges in top hat and tails, asking for one final brandy … or when First Officer Murdoch starts shooting at people before putting the pistol to his own head. These moments are the fleeting, indelible threads that strengthen the fabric of this story. All the while, we never lose sight of Rose, Jack, and Cal.\n\nAside from the outstanding, star-making turns delivered by DiCaprio and Winslet, every performer shines. Billy Zane is deliciously oily and snobbish before revealing himself to be a genuine threat. Kathy Bates strikes the perfect chord as “the unsinkable” Molly Brown, a fish out of water in first class who doesn’t bother to censor her opinions. Stoic Frances Fisher, steadfast Bernard Hill, thoughtful Victor Garber, calculating David Warner, arrogant Jonathan Hyde, and loyal Danny Nucci each leave their mark. And in the modern scenes, Gloria Stuart is both wise and wonderful. Along with Bill Paxton, she keeps us guessing as to where this story is going, despite its foregone conclusion.\n\nCameron’s writing was criticized when this film came out. He paints an original tale with bold, broad strokes, but I believe much of the dialogue resonates. It’s lean and focused, leaving an impact despite the imposing breadth of the plot—another similarity shared with Gone with the Wind. Perhaps this film’s record-tying 14 nominations stand in clear contrast to the lack of recognition for its screenplay and DiCaprio’s work.\n\nThe ending of this mammoth film is surprisingly quiet and poetic. Stuart, as Rose, walks in silence to the edge of the research vessel and drops her diamond necklace into the ocean, directly over the site of the wreckage. She has kept the valuable trinket to herself for 84 years, but she returns it to the past where it belongs. We then see her in the ship’s bed as the camera pans across a lifetime of framed photos behind her. We return with her to the past for an imagined “curtain call” where young Rose is reunited with her beloved Jack in front of the entire cast, aboard the beautifully restored ocean liner.\n\nI remember walking out of the theatre that sunny morning, unable to speak. I was overwhelmed by what I had just seen. I couldn’t shake the images of the frozen bodies bobbing in the icy water. I assumed these ill-fated passengers drowned while waiting to be rescued. Instead, they froze to death in a matter of minutes, and for me, it was a horrifying realization. The Carpathia, a nearby ship, arrived too late to save them. Much of the movie flashed before my eyes, and I was having lunch that day with my best friend, the Oscar-voter. She asked me right away, “Without giving away any details, what did you think?” I looked at her incredulously and said, “I just saw the Best Picture of the year.”\n\nIt turns out both audiences and the Academy agreed with my impression. A record 11 wins tied it with Ben-Hur (and later The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) as the most awarded film in Oscar history, and this movie is one of the all-time blockbuster champs as well—the first to gross over a billion dollars. Two decades later, it has solidified its place as one of the finest ever to take the top prize.\n\nTitanic\n\nDirector James Cameron Primary Cast Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bill Paxton, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Victor Garber, Jonathan Hyde, Suzy Amis, Danny Nucci, Eric Braden, Bernard Fox, Martin Jarvis, Rosalind Ayres, Ioan Gruffudd Familiar Faces Frances Fisher from Unforgiven, Bernard Hill from Gandhi, David Warner from Tom Jones Firsts First Best Picture to be produced, directed, written, and edited by the same person (James Cameron), first film to receive two acting nominations for performers playing the same character (Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart, both as Rose), first movie to gross one billion dollars at the box office, holds the record with 14 nominations (tied with All About Eve and La La Land) for the most in history, holds the record with 11 wins (tied with Ben-Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) for the most in history Total Wins 11 (Picture, Director, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, Editing, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects, Original Song: “My Heart Will Go On,” Score: Dramatic) Total Nominations 14 (Picture, Director, Actress: Kate Winslet, Supporting Actress: Gloria Stuart, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Editing, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects, Original Song: “My Heart Will Go On,” Score: Dramatic) Viewing Format Blu-ray Disc"
