        "text": "Winter is winding down and spring is now just over a week away.\n\nIn Central Illinois, we experienced a spring-like day earlier this week with a high of 70° and snow is expected this weekend.\n\nSpeaking of the weekend, enjoy yours and thank you for checking out my thoughts.\n\nXANADU — THE FIRST TWO WEEKS\n\nLast week, I shared that I’m now a “Dog Dad” again and I introduced you to #Pug2023 — Xanadu.\n\nShe’s had more wins than losses in the potty training process, but that’s because I’m watching her like a hawk when she’s inside.\n\nIn the two weeks since I’ve had her, she’s gained one-and-a-half pounds and now weighs six pounds!\n\nShe also experienced her first snow (less than an inch) after a rainy day with near hurricane-force winds!\n\nAnd, she was intrigued by the cold of the ice and enjoyed licking it!\n\nIt’s incredible how, like a baby, everything she sees goes into her mouth outside! And, I guess there’s an upside to her biting — she allows my fingers in her mouth to take everything out that she picks up!\n\nXanadu is becoming much more sociable to people and to the select dogs I’m letting her near until she’s fully vaccinated.\n\nWHY EVEN BOTHER WATCHING?\n\nThere are so many streaming services out there, with Netflix being the biggest, and many create its own original content.\n\nAnd, then if they don’t get “Game of Thrones” or “Ozark” viewership numbers, they cancel the series after just a season or two.\n\nThis is never more apparent that now. So, my question is, why even bother investing time into a new series that won’t have a conclusion?\n\n“UNCOUPLED” LIVES!\n\nThis happened to the Netflix series “Uncoupled” that I watched last summer.\n\nIt was cancelled on a cliffhanger after one season. Luckily, it was picked up by Showtime.\n\nIf you haven’t watched it, here’s what I wrote about it:\n\n“Neil Patrick Harris leads this eight-episode, Netflix series, alongside Tisha Campbell, Tuc Williams, and Marcia Gay Harden. This is the show that got me to thinking about my life.\n\nMichael and his boyfriend have been together 17 years and he’s planning a surprise 50th birthday party for his partner. However, it’s Michael that gets the biggest surprise right before he and Colin walk into the party. Colin tells him that he’s moving out!\n\nThe series is very funny, sexy, and naughty!\n\nThe one thing I didn’t like was Michael’s excessive whining and crying about moving on without Colin.\n\nDon’t get me wrong! I shed tears after my marriage fell apart, but life goes on!\n\nIt’s so great seeing Campbell again, even though she’s been actively working since 1990s “Martin”. She plays Michael’s real estate agent colleague and friend Suzanne.”\n\nGRADE: B+\n\n“MARCH MADNESS”\n\nWhile spring officially begins Monday, March 20th, it’s “Selection Sunday” weekend for the NCAA men’s basketball tournament.\n\nI might wager $10 this year and put forth my brackets for “March Madness” at work.\n\nIn 2013, I was successful in picking Louisville beating Michigan in the finals.\n\nNot only did I win $144 at work, but I also won a 55″ wide screen television from a local store in the Quad Cities. And, it still works!\n\nMY OSCAR PICKS\n\nThe Academy Awards are Sunday night.\n\nHere are my picks in the big categories — who will win, who might win, and who I want to win!\n\nBest Picture: I have it narrowed down to three: “All Quiet on the Western Front”, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”, and “Tár”.\n\nWILL WIN: “EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE“\n\nMIGHT WIN: “ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT”\n\nI WANT TO WIN: “TAR” OR “EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE”\n\nBest Director: My final two are Daniel Kwan, Daniel Scheinert (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) or Steven Spielberg (“The Fabelmans”)\n\nWHO WILL WIN: THE DANIELS\n\nWHO MIGHT WIN: SPIELBERG\n\nWHO I WANT TO WIN: THE DANIELS\n\nBest Lead Actor: My two final choices are Austin Butler (“Elvis”) and Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”)\n\nWHO WILL WIN: FRASER\n\nWHO MIGHT WIN: BUTLER\n\nWHO I WANT TO WIN: NOT COMMITTED SINCE I HAVEN’T SEEN “THE WHALE” YET.\n\nBest Lead Actress: My finalists are Cate Blanchett (“Tár”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”)\n\nWHO WILL WIN: YEOH\n\nWHO MIGHT WIN: BLANCHETT\n\nWHO I WANT TO WIN: A TIE — YEOH AND BLANCHETT BOTH GETTING OSCARS!\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nWILL WIN & WANT TO WIN: Ke Huy Quan (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”)\n\nBest Supporting Actress: I’ve narrowed it down to Angela Bassett (“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”) and Jamie Lee Curtis (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”)\n\nWHO WILL WIN & WANT TO WIN: CURTIS\n\nWHO MIGHT WIN: BASSETT\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay: My finalists are “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “Women Talking”\n\nWHO WILL WIN & WANT TO WIN: “ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT”\n\nWHO MIGHT WIN: “WOMEN TALKING”\n\nBest Original Screenplay: My finalists are “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and “Tár”\n\nWILL WIN & WANT TO WIN: “EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE”\n\nBest Original Song: This is no contest and I’d be shocked if “Naatu Naatu” doesn’t win!\n\n“Applause” from “Tell It Like a Woman”\n\n“Hold My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick”\n\n“Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”\n\n“Naatu Naatu” from “RRR”\n\n“This Is a Life” from “Everything Everywhere All at Once”\n\nWILL WIN & I WANT TO WIN: “NAATU NAATU”\n\n“EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE”\n\nTypically, this would not be my kind of movie.\n\nI watched it last December because of the awards seasons buzz and I love Michelle Yeoh. (Yes, I’m crying because we may never see the sequels to “Crazy Rich Asians”.)\n\nThe movie has already picked up the equivalent of “Best Picture” at the Critics’ Choice Awards and the Screen Actors Guild Awards and Yeoh has already won about three dozen Best Actress awards with the Oscars coming down to her and Cate Blanchett.\n\nKe Hu Quan, who plays Yeoh’s husband, is almost a shoe-in for the Oscar, and Jamie Lee Curtis earned her first Academy Award nomination for the movie in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\nWhile the movie ended up being my #6 movie of 2022, I’m so ready to watch it again just to see what I missed the first time since it was so mind-blowing!\n\nGRADE: A-\n\nI’M SO IN LOVE WITH MICHELLE YEOH\n\nI’ve been singing the praises of “Crazy Rich Asians” for years.\n\nWhen I saw the movie in August 2018, I gave it an “A” calling it “a classic romantic comedy — a masterpiece of not only love, but culture.” in a blog titled, ‘“Crazy Rich Asians” Sparkles — Fascinating & Irresistible”‘.\n\nIn that piece, I called Michelle Yeoh “ageless and gorgeous”. And, now that beauty graces the new “People” magazine.\n\nThe accompanying article on Yeoh is incredible — just hearing in her own words about the battles and stereotypes she’s been fighting since coming to Hollywood!\n\nWhile I showed the cover because it’s beautiful, I also featured it because of the emerald ring from “Crazy Rich Asians”. It’s actually her ring and wasn’t just a movie prop!\n\nHowever, here’s my favorite photo from the “People” article.\n\nNow, just give her the Best Actress Oscar already (and if you’re reading this after Sunday night, you’ll know if the Academy Awards did just that)!\n\n“YOU PEOPLE”\n\nWith a cast led by eight-time Emmy Award winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Emmy winner and Oscar nominee Eddie Murphy, how could you go wrong? Well, pretty easily!\n\nThe romantic-comedy movie is about race. Broker and podcaster Ezra (Jonah Hill), who is Jewish, meets and falls in love with fashion designer Amira (Lauren London), who is Black.\n\nDreyfus plays Ezra’s mother who tries too hard to show how thrilled she is by having a future daughter-in-law that’s Black. Meanwhile, Murphy doesn’t try hard enough to hide his feelings about having a white Jewish son-in-law.\n\nWhile Louis-Dreyfus was great, the standouts in the movie were London and Sam Jay, who plays Mo, Ezra’s podcast sidekick, who’s a Black lesbian.\n\nOne of my favorite actors, David Duchovny, is pretty much wasted in this movie — not drunk-wasted, just no real purpose in the movie.\n\nGRADE: C-\n\nTHAT’S IT\n\nWith all the craziness in the world, make it the best in your little part of it!\n\nAnthony\n\nIt’s Friday so that means I’m ready to share a few things with you and the first one is personal! Shock!\n\nThank you for checking out my thoughts and have a great weekend.\n\nSINGLE LIFE <INSERT YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE>\n\nI recently watched a Netflix series that really spoke to me. It made me think a lot about my single life and the past five years and what needs to change over the next five years.\n\nIn last December’s Christmas letter, I stated, “I’m still single and the dating life is, wait, what dating life? Good thing I enjoy my own company!”\n\nIn early 2017, my ex and I decided to end our eight-year relationship.\n\nWhile that relationship was played out in public through social media and this blog, when I finally opened up about our break-up months later, I wrote, “If and when another relationship comes our way, we both might be more reserved to make it public…”\n\nWell, I did.\n\nHowever, I think the wires got crossed somewhere between that comment and Cupid. I still want to go on dates and if something real presents itself, I’m more than willing to take the plunge!\n\nSo, if you happen to have a face to face with Aphrodite, tell her we need to have a glass of wine and talk!\n\nUntil that happens, here’s the amazing Kylie Minogue with “All The Lovers” from the “Aphrodite Tour”! Watch this just the beautiful theatrics! 🙂\n\nOn second thought, if I have the chance to see Kylie live in concert in 2023, I’d put off love for another year! But, then again, why can’t I have both? 🙂\n\n“UNCOUPLED”\n\nNeil Patrick Harris leads this eight-episode, Netflix series, alongside Tisha Campbell, Tuc Williams, and Marcia Gay Harden. This is the show that got me to thinking about my life.\n\nMichael and his boyfriend have been together 17 years and he’s planning a surprise 50th birthday party for his partner. However, it’s Michael that gets the biggest surprise right before he and Colin walk into the party. Colin tells him that he’s moving out!\n\nThe series is very funny, sexy, and naughty!\n\nThe one thing I didn’t like was Michael’s excessive whining and crying about moving on without Colin.\n\nDon’t get me wrong! I shed tears after my marriage fell apart, but life goes on!\n\nIt’s a lot different moving on in Panama City (FL), Duluth (MN), and Decatur (IL) than it is in New York City, where there’s a buffet of hot men to choose from! Yes, they probably have a buffet of issues, as well, just like those in Panama City, Duluth, and Decatur! 🙂\n\nAnd, I loved that one of Michael’s best friends is a television “weatherman”. When they were talking, he makes a comment Michael didn’t like and Michael ends the phone call with this zinger!\n\nIt’s so great seeing Campbell again, even though she’s been actively working since 1990s “Martin”. She plays Michael’s real estate agent colleague and friend Suzanne.\n\nHere’s hoping for a renewal for a second season soon!\n\nGRADE: B+\n\n“THE BLACK PHONE”\n\nThis summer blockbuster hit theaters in late June and is now on Peacock.\n\nThe $17 million Blumhouse Productions horror/supernatural thriller now has a box office take of $155.6 million!\n\nIt takes place in the same time frame as the original “Halloween” movie — 1978 — in North Denver, Colorado, where several young boys go missing and the police search for “The Grabber”. (Yes, there are some winks to the John Carpenter classic!)\n\nEthan Hawke is creepy and great as the masked villain in the movie. And, young stars Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw, as siblings Finney and Gwen, are incredible.\n\nSince I was a kid about Finney’s age in 1978, the premise of the movie seemed very real and scary.\n\nDiscussions are underway on a sequel.\n\nGRADE: A-\n\nMORE “LOVERS”\n\nSince Kylie Minogue’s “All The Lovers” was my second favorite song in the second era of my life (1999-2021), here’s the steamy and erotic official video!\n\n“THE SHIELD”\n\nSo, it only took two decades, but I finally watched the cutting edge FX series, “The Shield”, that ran from 2002-2008.\n\nWhile I won’t blatantly give away detailed spoilers, I’ll speak freely because it’s been twenty years and you’ve probably watched it if you wanted to! 🙂\n\nAfter watching this 88-episode series and seeing Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) getting away with his dirty deeds all the time, it made me think of “Dallas”. How did people keep watching that snake J.R. Ewing be so nasty and hardly ever having to pay for his actions?\n\nI wish the series had explored more about the cat strangulation and Julien’s gayness later in the series. It just went away!\n\nMy favorite characters were Claudette (CCH Pounder), Danny (Catherine Dent), and Shane Vendrell (Walton Goggins). My least favorite characters were Julien and Shane’s wife, Mara.\n\nI loved the guest starring roles with Oscar nominee Glenn Close and Oscar winner Forest Whitaker!\n\nBy far, the sexiest series regular was was Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell). I love how he went from a regular looking Joe in season one to a stud in future seasons!\n\nAnd, Guillermo Beltran in the final season was so hot! He was played by Italian Francesco Quinn, the son of actor Anthony Quinn.\n\nHere’s a shocking story: Quinn died of an apparent heart attack in Malibu, in 2011, at the age of 48!\n\nAnd, we can’t forget the short stint with Alex O’Loughlin!\n\nOne last note about the worthwhile series — the finale with Shane — WOW!\n\nGRADE: B\n\n“THE UNDOING”\n\nAs you know, I absolutely love Nicole Kidman.\n\nShe was fantastic in this 2020 six-episode HBO thriller with Hugh Grant from creator and writer David E. Kelley.\n\nThe acting was spectacular and even earned Donald Sutherland a Critics’ Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie.\n\nOne of the funniest lines in the bleak show was used twice by a lawyer that was hired by the family.\n\nAfter she stated something, someone said something to the effect of “you’re kidding” and she replied both times, “I don’t make jokes. I’m not funny!”\n\nGRADE: B\n\nTHAT’S IT\n\nWith all the craziness in the world, make it the best in your little part of it!\n\nAnthony\n\nYou know I love to share with you and I use my blog and my writing as therapy.\n\nWhether it’s humorous, about the entertainment world, politics, or equality, the topics are usually random. You never know what I’ll write about next.\n\nI started the blog in January 2012 and, before that, I joined Facebook in the spring of 2009. It was right after Ray and I started seeing each other.\n\nSo, over the past eight years, our lives were played out in the public arena. It’s given us the chance to meet some of you and to “friend” many others that we never met in person. However, you’re still a part of our lives and we were a part of yours.\n\nYou saw everything from the fun meals and drinks we made, our holiday celebrations, our vacations, and our beautiful wedding reception (six years ago)!\n\nAs you know, I moved to Florida in early May and I haven’t been shy about it not being an enjoyable experience. Part of that is the area, but the larger problem lies with me.\n\nIn a couple of blogs this spring (which I’m sharing again below), I said, “I lost faith in myself and in my fellow man and now, it’s up to me to find it again” after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn another blog, I wrote, “Change is stressful. Change is exciting. Change is different. Change is simply change!” and “In life, we go through it many times. Whether it’s losing loved ones through death, break-ups or divorce, or just by spreading our wings to fly, change proves we’re alive.”\n\nThe reasons for the change and the move I expressed in the blogs were honest, but I didn’t share everything. Some of you sensed there was more to the story and there is.\n\nIn early February, Ray and I decided to go our separate ways after eight years together. We called it “a break”. But, we knew then that we had drifted apart and the circumstances weren’t going to change.\n\nWhen I said, Florida “hasn’t been an enjoyable experience”, now you know the real, larger issue.\n\nMoving here was a quick fix solution to our problem, a “band-aid” to cover something that needed more attention, but was neglected.\n\nIn retrospective, Florida is/was a mistake. If I had it to do over again, I probably would have stayed in the Quad Cities, even as we moved forward with our separation and divorce.\n\nAfter we started posting pictures of our trip to Scandinavia, we knew it was time to make it public based on comments of how happy we looked and it was good to see us together again.\n\nThat trip was already scheduled and paid for long before we made this life-altering decision. The trip turned out to be our “swan song”!\n\nRay is moving on with his life and is experiencing things he was missing out on in the last years of our relationship. Now, it’s up to me to do the same.\n\nI wish him the very best in life and I hope he finds what we had for much of our time together and lost toward the end.\n\nOn Kygo’s 2016 CD, “Cloud Nine”, there’s a song, “Stole the Show” that sadly and perfectly sums things up. Our relationship was on display thanks to social media and we didn’t mind. But, now that the outcome is what it is, things playing out publicly is different.\n\nIf and when another relationship comes our way, we both might be more reserved to make it public and I hope, my friends, that you don’t take that the wrong way.\n\nHere are those blogs I referenced above:\n\n“It All Starts With Me”\n\nhttps://anthonypeoples.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/it-all-starts-with-me/\n\n“Change”\n\nhttps://anthonypeoples.wordpress.com/2017/04/15/change/\n\nAll of this has me thinking of the most charming public couple, Neil Patrick Harris and his husband, David Burtka.\n\nIn a 2014 “Rolling Stone” feature on Harris, Burtka said, “There is a lot of ‘Oh, you guys are role models’, I’m superhappy that people look to us. If anything happened, God forbid, I wouldn’t want to let anyone down. But nothing will! After you get to, like, seven, eight years, it’s like, ‘No one’s going anywhere’.”\n\nFor Harris, Burtka, and their twins, I’m happy that it’s true for them!\n\nAnthony\n\nThe weekend is almost here and I hope you have fun plans.\n\nThe nice thing is that temperatures will be near 70° for Iowa and Illinois. If you recall by this time last year, the Quad Cities had already had its first measurable snow of the season! (0.4″ fell on October 22, 2013, in Moline, Illinois.)\n\nYes, I have a few random thoughts to share and I hope you enjoy reading them.\n\nEBOLA FEARS & BLAME\n\nAs of now, one person has died here in the United States from Ebola, a disease that has killed close to 5,000 people in Africa. However, the World Health Organization says that the true number may be three times that official number.\n\nTwice recently, while traveling, I had the unfortunate experience of watching Fox News in the hotel room and I was disgusted that the talking heads were blaming President Obama for not doing enough.\n\nMaybe they need to step back for a moment and look at this fact!\n\nIf you think that’s just some Democratic, liberal slant of the facts, read a full article that I blogged about that in July 2012.\n\nhttps://anthonypeoples.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/president-reagan-i-no-longer-hate-you/\n\nREBA IS READY FOR A COMEBACK\n\nIt’s sad to say that when you have more Top Ten hits on the country chart than any other woman in history and you’re tied with Dolly Parton with the most #1 country songs by a woman that you’re staging a comeback, but that’s what Reba McEntire, my idol, is doing.\n\nReba’s last album, “All The Women I Am” was released almost four years ago and it featured her last #1 song, Turn On The Radio”, which topped the chart on New Year’s Day in 2011.\n\nHere’s Reba performing that song in Moline in October 2011.\n\nSince then, the next three singles faltered at country radio peaking at #22 (the remake of Beyonce’s “If I Were A Boy”), #40, and #44. Thanks country radio!\n\nNevertheless, she’s back with a new label and she’s making new music.\n\nEarlier this week, Reba announced that she signed with Nash ICON Music, a joint venture between Big Machine Label Group (Taylor Swift’s label) and Cumulus Media, the broadcasting giant that owns 460 AM and FM stations in the United States.\n\nReba is working with her longtime friend and producer Tony Brown, who’s behind her biggest hits albums from the early-to-mid-1990s including my favorites, “Rumor Has It” (1990) and “Read My Mind” (1994). James Stroud is also co-producing the album. Stroud has produced some of Clay Walker and Tracy Lawrence’s biggest hits.\n\nReba has already\n\nWhile there’s no date set for the new single and new album, Reba promises it will be “soon”!\n\n“GONE GIRL”\n\nThe latest David Fincher masterpiece, “Gone Girl”, is amazing.\n\nThe movie is based on the New York Times best seller and critically acclaimed novel of the same name by former “Entertainment Weekly” writer Gillian Flynn.\n\nIn just three weeks, the movie starring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, and Neil Patrick Harris has grossed more than $216 million worldwide with more than one-half of that domestically.\n\nWhile I plan on reading the book in early December, the movie was incredible. It really helped that Flynn also wrote the screenplay for the movie.\n\nHere’s the trailer, which tells you what you really need to know about the movie.\n\nAffleck was very solid just as he was in “Argo” and Pike definitely has a future in Hollywood.\n\nHarris is so versatile as an actor and this is one of his most revealing and vulnerable, naked performances he’s given.\n\nLet’s just say that he was definitely acting on Broadway in his critically acclaimed role in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”, because there is much more there!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, that’s my way of saying you see more of Harris in this movie than you’ve ever seen before! 🙂\n\nGRADE: A\n\nWE’RE HEADING TO THE CHAPEL AND WE’RE GOING TO GET MARRIED…\n\nMarriage equality is sweeping the nation as court challenges and the Supreme Court of the United States are giving more Americans the freedom to get married.\n\nYet, that idiot and Fox News mouthpiece Mike Huckabee, the failed Presidential candidate, will not let it drop.\n\nCheck out this tweet and a Twitter response to his assessment of what Jesus probably thought.\n\nWhile that might have offended some, that wasn’t my intent. However, it made me smile and I couldn’t have said it any better.\n\nPARIS AND TEL AVIV HIGHLIGHTS\n\nLast week, I turned the big 5-0 and we saved our pennies and dollars and celebrated the milestone birthday with a trip to Europe (Paris, France) and the Middle East (Tel Aviv, Israel).\n\nHere are some of the interesting things we experienced on the trip.\n\nMy birthday present from Ray was dinner cruise on the Seine River, followed by a trip to the Eiffel Tower at night. We paid the extra 12 Euros to go to top and it was amazing to see the sprawled out city of Paris twinkling in the distance.\n\nAnd, the night didn’t end there. It was then off to the historic Moulin Rouge for a show and champagne. I actually turned 50 during the show.\n\nThanks Ray!!!!!!! You’re incredible.\n\nWe also had duck and goose a couple of times and while I’ll not make it a regular part of my eating habits, it was rather tasty.\n\nThe oddest thing I saw in Paris was a Chinese buffet near our hotel that we kept eyeing on our walks. We finally gave it a try and you actually had to microwave your food that was sitting out on the buffet! I wasn’t a fan of that. Osaka Buffet in Moline, you have nothing to worry about!\n\nBut, then again, who goes to Paris and has a Chinese buffet?\n\nIt’s a small world after all. As we were waiting in the line to go through customs at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, all of a sudden I heard “Hey Moline” and it was a sweet little, older couple that was coming back from a European River Cruise. You never know who or where you’ll see your peeps! 🙂\n\nThen it was off to Tel Aviv for three days.\n\nIt’s absolutely gorgeous there and from our hotel room, we could see the sandy beaches of the Mediterranean Sea!\n\nWe were amazed at how beautiful, healthy, and in shape most Israeli men are. Note to self: eat better and work out more!\n\nThe morning Israeli breakfast our hotel, Prima City Hotel, was very tasty. However, our favorite meal was at בני-הדייג, which translates to Benny The Fisherman, right on the Sea.\n\nThat was just the salads and “starters” that they brought out. Yes, fifteen of them, including the bread basket!\n\nIncredible! I wanted to go back again, but we didn’t.\n\nTEL AVIV SCARE\n\nSadly, we didn’t get our a stamp on our passport from Israel.\n\nThe customs agent was so flustered from ranting a woman in front of us for sticking her passport in her mouth that he forgot. He refused to let her go through his line because he wasn’t going to touch her passport. And, I really don’t blame him. However, his approach was a little abrasive.\n\nAs for us, our only scare was when we happened upon the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv on the way to dinner. It was dusk and we decided to take a picture of it for our photo album.\n\nHowever, three guards came out (one with a large weapon) and told us not to take pictures and took my driver’s license and called it in since we weren’t carrying our passports. After a very long five minutes or so, they let us go and told us not to take pictures.\n\nIt’s very interesting because last month in Ottawa, Canada’s capital, the guards there had no issue with photo-taking tourists.\n\nAnd, on our return flight home, the snow-covered Alps were beautiful!\n\nPICK HIT\n\nWhile in Tel Aviv, Israel, I was delighted that VH-1 showed music videos all the time. There was no filler programming or reality crap, just real videos like in the old days of MTV and VH-1.\n\nI fell in love with the song, “Stolen Dance” by the German pop/rock/folk duo, Milky Chance, made up of singer Clemens Rehbein and DJ Philipp Dausch.\n\nWhat I was surprised to learn is that the song is #1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart (six weeks) and #1 on the Rock Airplay chart (four weeks) in the United States.\n\nAnd, it’s already topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Ireland, and Switzerland, and it peaked at #2 or #3 in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Slovakia, and Sweden.\n\nSo far, it isn’t a Top 40 hit on mainstream radio in the U.S., but it’s catching on.\n\nTHE CALENDAR SAYS HALLOWEEN, BUT…\n\nI’m already in the Christmas spirit.\n\nHowever, I plan on watching “Hellbent”, a gay horror movie, from the people who brought us “Halloween” and “The Nightmare on Elm Street”. It’s a movie that I watch every October.\n\nNow, back to Christmas. There are many upcoming holiday releases coming out including LeAnn Rimes, Darius Rucker, and Earth, Wind, & Fire.\n\nBut, I’ve already bought two new CDs.\n\nI just got Idina Menzel’s “Holiday Wishes” this week.\n\nWhile I believe that “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” is a tired Christmas song and it’s becoming one of my least favorites, Idina’s version with sexy crooner Michael Buble, is fun and enjoyable.\n\nOther standouts on the disc are “Silent Night”, “Holly Jolly Christmas”, her remake of the Joni Mitchell classic, “River”, and the aforementioned duet with Buble.\n\nI admit that it did take several listens to her version of the Mariah Carey classic, “All I Want For Christmas Is You”, before I could like and appreciate it. Carey’s version is perfect!\n\nIt wasn’t Menzel’s voice that threw me for a loop. The arrangement is all over the place and the song is over five minutes long. Once I “got it”, the song was more enjoyable.\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nAnd, another one you definitely need to add to your Christmas music collection is actor, singer, producer, writer, and Oscar host Seth MacFarlane, “Holiday For Swing”.\n\nHe has an amazing voice and brings an old-time Rat Pack feel to Christmas on “Holiday For Swing”. If you love jazz and Christmas music, you’ll love it.\n\nSadly, there are no snippets that I can find online to share with you. What’s up with that, Seth?\n\nI’ve listened to the album countless times and it could definitely become a standard!\n\nGRADE: A\n\nTHAT’S IT FOR NOW!\n\nIt was nice to share my random thoughts with you again.\n\nAs I promised when I stopped doing it weekly, I’d do one every once in a while.\n\nI really miss writing, but I just can’t find the time to do with my crazy work schedule. Work just seems to get in the way, but I do need that small paycheck.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nAnthony\n\nHappy Friday and Happy Father’s Day to all of the dads out there.\n\nThank you for checking out my random thoughts this week and have a great weekend!\n\nACCEPTING JONAH HILL’S APOLOGY?\n\nIt’s been almost two weeks since two-time Oscar nominee Jonah Hill (“This Is The End”, “The Wolf of Wall Street”, and “Moneyball”) screamed out a homophobic remark to the paparazzi that was hounding and berating him in a Los Angeles neighborhood near Hollywood.\n\nHe quickly went into damage control mode expressing how disgusted he was with himself because that’s not how he really feels and that he’s always been very supportive of the LGBT community.\n\nWhile he’s a solid actor, I can’t say that I’m a fan. On the other hand, I don’t dislike him.\n\nI feel he’s genuinely sincere with his apology. However, if he was really pushed into lashing out, he could have still said, “Suck my d***” without the derogatory f-word that precipitated this whole apology tour.\n\nWhen I’m mad, I may use choice words, but they definitely don’t start with “F” or “N”, because those words are not part of my daily vocabulary and shouldn’t be a part of anyone’s!\n\nBRAD PAISLEY IS AWESOME\n\nI met country music superstar Brad Paisley back in 2001 in Canfield, Ohio, when he was just starting out and was promoting his second album. (That’s a much younger me in the middle with the microphone).\n\nAt the time, he was new to business and came across as rather shy. Now, he’s very outgoing and outspoken.\n\nHere’s how he handled the Westboro Baptist cult outside his show in the Kansas City, Missouri, area back on June 1st.\n\nHe took a selfie with the group that was protesting him and said that they’d “play loud” enough that night for the group to hear outside.\n\nAwesome!\n\n“I’M A LITTLE BIT COUNTRY”\n\nAt this point, I might as well feature Brad as my weekly country music pick of the songs and artists that I’ve loved or admired when I listened to country music.\n\nBrad first hit the chart in 1999 when “Who Needs Pictures” peaked at #12. The follow-up, “He Didn’t Have To Be” topped the chart in December of that year.\n\nIn all, he’s had 37 hits on the Billboard Country chart with 30 of them reaching the Top Ten. Of those, 18 have reached #1. As a matter of fact, he had an amazing run from 2005-2009 with ten consecutive number one hits on the charts!\n\nWhile I love, “He Didn’t Have To Be”, “We Danced”, and “When I Get Where I’m Going” with Dolly Parton, my pick hit today is convenient. “Celebrity” reached #3 in 2003.\n\nBrad has sold more than 12 million albums, picked up three Grammys, 14 Academy of Country Music Awards, and 14 Country Music Association Awards.\n\n“TONY AWARDS” HUMOR\n\nHugh Jackman from Sunday night’s “Tony Awards” broadcast: “There’s the amazing Neil Patrick Harris, nominated for Hedwig. He is a legendary four-time Tony host. But, Angela Lansbury has hosted five times. So, Neil is right behind her and I was right behind him, which is still illegal in 13 states.”\n\nDisclaimer: That picture of Hugh Jackman has nothing to do with the Tony Awards. Oh well….\n\nTHE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY\n\nIt’s now June and I’ve only gone to the movies once this year. I saw “August: Osage County” back in January.\n\nI still want to see “Godzilla” on the big screen and I’ll wait to see “Neighbors” on DVD. Other than that, there’s nothing out there or coming out anytime soon that I can’t wait for to watch at home.\n\nThe next movie I anticipate seeing is “The Hundred-Foot Journey” with Academy Award winner Helen Mirren (“The Queen”, 2006, Best Actress).\n\nThe movie is co-produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey and is directed by Lasse Hallstrom (“Chocolat”, “The Cider House Rules”, and “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape”).\n\n“The Hundred-Foot Journey” opens August 8th.\n\nCHER IS COMING BACK TO THE QUAD CITIES\n\nThis fall, music and screen icon, Cher, will be making another stop in the Quad Cities on October 22nd with her “Dressed To Kill Tour”. Pat Benatar is opening for her.\n\nI saw her last Friday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with Cyndi Lauper opening for her. The show, from the costumes, the sets, the choreography, and Cher’s humor and voice, was amazing.\n\nI saw Cher and Cyndi back in 2002 in Chicago on “The Farewell Tour” and the “Dressed To Kill Tour” was much better and more entertaining.\n\nDO YOU KNOW RYAN LEWIS?\n\nRyan Lewis is part of the biggest act that has hit pop and rap music in the past few years. He’s the good-looking half of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.\n\nBut, could you pick him out a crowd? Obviously, New Yorkers couldn’t. Lewis is so funny in this clip from “The Tonight Show”.\n\nCOOKIE FAIL\n\nI got really excited when I saw that Chips Ahoy had birthday frosting and Oreo creme filled cookies.\n\nI wasn’t impressed. I think the cookies would have been much better if they were crunchy Chips Ahoy with the creme frosting filling. I’ll save my 75 calories per small cookie for something more rewarding.\n\nPICK HIT\n\nSwedish music producer and DJ Avicii has produced songs for some of the biggest names in music — Madonna, Coldplay, Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, Daft Punk, Robyn, and many more.\n\nHe even scored his first hit album with himself as the star. “True” debuted at #5 in the U.S. last fall and was one of my favorite albums of 2013.\n\nThe first two songs from that album have made a big impact on Top 40 radio in America and both have topped the Billboard Dance chart.\n\n“Wake Me Up” reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2013 and was downloaded more than 4 million times. The follow-up, “Hey Brother”, peaked at #16 on the Hot 100.\n\nHis new song, “Addicted To You”, has already topped the Billboard Dance chart and is now racing up the Top 40 radio chart.\n\nWarning: the video does include shots of butts!\n\nSPEAKING OF MADONNA\n\nIt seems that she is hard at work on her 13th studio album. While there is no release date set, it appears that she’s working with Avicii, the English duo Disclosure (who’s scoring big on American radio right now with their Top 15 hit, “Latch”), American DJ and producer Diplo, and English singer/actress Natalia Kills.\n\nI really thought that Natalia Kills would have been big in the U.S. in the wake of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. However, that didn’t happen even with will.i.am on her side.\n\nBut, “Wonderland” is still one of my favorite songs and videos. Warning — it’s disturbing.\n\nTHAT’S IT\n\nHave a splendid weekend and thank you for checking out my random thoughts this week!\n\nAnthony\n\nIt’s Friday and it’s Easter weekend. I hope it’s a nice one for you and if you’re going to church, enjoy the services. I hope your Easter egg hunts are dry and fun and your Easter feast is a tasty one.\n\nI’m working Saturday, so Ray and Gretel are celebrating with Ray’s family in northwestern Iowa and my sister, Tammy, is visiting her granddaughters in Tennessee. So, I’m home alone and I plan on sleeping in Sunday, having pancakes, and watching a couple of my favorite movies again.\n\nIf you’re thinking of what to buy someone for a great Easter present and bunnies come to mind, make it a chocolate bunny!\n\nHere are my random thoughts this Friday. Thank you for checking them out.\n\nAIRLINE THREATS ARE NOT FUNNY\n\nBefore the 1970s, it was a much different world when it came to flying. High profile plane hijacking changed the rather lax airport security.\n\nI remember seeing a cartoon during my childhood of a man raising his hand to his friend and yelling “Hi Jack” before being arrested.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks on the United States on 9/11, it’s hard to imagine anyone making a joke of threatening an airline, an airport, or a plane.\n\nHowever, last Sunday night, it happened when a 14-year-old Dutch girl, “Sarah”, sent a threatening tweet to American Airlines.\n\nOnce she realized that this was turning into a big deal with the police involved, she tweeted, “I was joking and it was my friend not me, take her IP address not mine. I’m so scared I’m just a 14-year-old white girl I’m not a terrorist.” She was arrested the next day!\n\nI have two things to say about this. I don’t care how old someone is when they threaten to bomb a plane. It’s not a joke and they should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nSecondly, if this tweet is proven to be sent by a “14-year-old white girl who is not “a terrorist”, she’s truly offensive. Implying that a “white girl” couldn’t possibly be a “terrorist” is racist!\n\nSadly, the only leeway I’ll give her on that one is immaturity, but even a teenager should know that the tweet would cause fear in some people and that is terrorism!\n\nIncredibly, this has caused a rash of similar copycat tweets to American and other airlines. Real threats or not, this is just mind-boggling!\n\nHAPPY FLIGHT\n\nOn a happier airline note, I sure hope this flight attendant is working my next Southwest Airlines’ flight.\n\nI hope this made you smile.\n\nHE CUT OFF WHAT?\n\nRapper Andre Johnson, also known as Christ Bearer, is recovering at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after severing his penis and jumping off the second floor balcony of his North Hollywood apartment!\n\nThose present say that no one was using drugs and that they believe he suffered from mental illness.\n\nTMZ reports that efforts to reattach the appendage were unsuccessful.\n\nIf Johnson is mentally ill, I hope that he gets the help he needs. If he isn’t ill, this was a very painful and horrific plea for attention!\n\nAnd, as a man, this is just painful to think about!\n\nWHILE WE’RE IN THAT MIND SET…\n\nNow that “How I Met Your Mother” has ended its nine-year run on CBS, Neil Patrick Harris is getting rave reviews for his upcoming Broadway performance in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the rock musical/love story, Hansel is an East German that falls in love with an American soldier.\n\nSince the couple wants to get married and the laws says that it has to be a man and a woman, Hansel’s mother changes his named to Hedwig (her name) and finds a doctor to perform a sex change. The operation is botched leaving Hedwig with the so-called “angry inch”.\n\nHarris’ performance as Hedwig on Broadway runs from April through August.\n\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT\n\nTATTOOS\n\nDo you have a tattoo? While still somewhat controversial, getting inked is becoming mainstream.\n\nEven Miss Kansas 2013, Theresa Vail, is tattooed with the Serenity Prayer and a military medical insignia. She says, “If I were crowned Miss America, bearing my tattoos, do you realize the stereotypes and stigmas it would break?”\n\nIf you’re in your thirties, there’s a 40% chance that you have a tattoo. If not, 30% of people in their 20s and almost 30% of people in the 40s are getting inked!\n\nMore women than men and Hispanics more than whites or blacks have body art.\n\nTwo years ago this week, I join the group of white men in their 40s to get a tattoo. It was a painful, almost four-hour process and I’m very happy to sport it and show it off.\n\nAs you know, my sweet golden retriever and my best friend , Miss ABBA, went to “puppy heaven” in February 2012.\n\nTwo months later, I turned her beautiful face into body art. Here’s the picture from Halloween 2011 and you can see the final product.\n\nJohn Kautz, from O’Toole Design, in Rock Island, Illinois, did an incredible job.\n\nYou can read about the entire experience here: https://anthonypeoples.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/miss-abba-ill-cherish-this-piece-of-art-forever/\n\n“LATE, LATE AT NIGHT” WITH RICK SPRINGFIELD\n\nI recently finished Rick Springfield’s memoir about his life, his battle with depression, his sexual addiction, and his music and acting career.\n\nIt was a fun book. I’ll share the link again if you didn’t read my blog about the book.\n\nhttps://anthonypeoples.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/the-ups-downs-of-rick-springfields-rock-star-lifestyle/\n\nHowever, one thing that I forgot to mention in the blog was his one year affair with “The Exorcist” star Linda Blair.\n\nAt the time, he was 25 at the time and she was only 15! I guess things were different in the 1970s and in Hollywood!\n\n“Don’t Talk To Strangers” hit #2 in 1982 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was the second biggest hit of Rick’s career behind the number one, Grammy-winning smash, “Jessie’s Girl” the year before.\n\n“OUT OF THE FURNACE”\n\nChristian Bale is one of the best actors in the movie business today.\n\n“Out of The Furnace” is a little seen movie that came out about a week before his Oscar-nominated role in “American Hustle”.\n\nIn the movie, Bale plays Russell Baze, a West Virginia steel mill worker that has a beautiful girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) that wants to have a baby, a brother (Casey Affleck) with a gambling problem and is struggling with life after serving in the war, and a dying father.\n\nHe works every day and is paying off his little brother’s gambling debts. After stopping for a few drinks after work one night, he’s involved in an accident that changes his life forever.\n\nAlso, his little brother disappears and Russell feels it’s up to him to find out what happened and to make things right.\n\nThe movie features incredible performances from Bale, Affeck, Saldana, and Woody Harrelson as a New Jersey sociopathic, inbreed, drug dealer named Harlan DeGroat.\n\nGRADE: A\n\nDAVID DUCHOVNY IS COMING TO NBC\n\nOnce Showtime’s “Californication” wraps up its seventh and final season in late June, David Duchovny will star in the new NBC series, “Aquarius”.\n\nThe 13-epidsode drama take place in the late-1960s. Duchovny stars as a Los Angeles police sergeant “who starts tracking a small-time criminal and budding cult leader seeking out vulnerable women to join his ’cause.’ The name of that man is Charles Manson.”\n\nNBC goes on to say that “the twists and turns of a complicated undercover operation will lead Duchovny’s character and his young partner to the brink of Manson’s crimes that will eventually lead to the Tate-LaBianca murders in subsequent seasons.”\n\nHere’s my two cents. I love David Duchovny and I’ve always been intrigued with serial killers. I’ll be watching.\n\nNBC, if “Crisis” and “Hannibal” are not renewed, please write Gillian Anderson into the script and let her work with Duchovny’s character!\n\n“I’M A LITTLE BIT COUNTRY”\n\nThe first concert that Ray and I went to together was Keith Urban and Taylor Swift in Moline in June 2009. Both were amazing performers and this was before I quickly tired of the teen sensation.\n\nSince his first hit on the Billboard Country chart in 1999, “It’s A Love Thing”, reached #18 (his first four releases from 1990 and 1991 didn’t chart), Urban has been a force to reckon with on country radio.\n\nOf his 33 Top 40 hits, an incredible 31 have hit the Top Ten, the aforementioned “Love Thing” and “Blue Sky” by Emily West, which he was just featured on and so, really that one doesn’t count!\n\n28 of his hits have made the Top 5 and 15 have topped the Country charts.\n\nThe ones that spent multiple weeks on top are: “Somebody Like You” (6 weeks, 2002), “You’ll Think Of Me” (2 weeks, 2004), “Days Go By” (4 weeks, 2004), “Making Memories Of Us” (5 weeks, 2005), “Better Life” (6 weeks, 2005), “Sweet Thing” (2 weeks, 2009), “You Gonna Fly” (2 weeks, 2012), and “We Were Us” (with Miranda Lambert, 3 weeks, 2013).\n\nKeith’s current hit, “Cop Car”, recently reached #4 on the Billboard Country chart.\n\nHAPPY EASTER!\n\nHave a great weekend! Here’s a flashback to Easter 2001 and Miss ABBA and the Easter bunny.\n\nThat’s it for this week. I hope you enjoyed my random thoughts.\n\nLet me know what you think. I always appreciate feedback — good or bad. Well, obviously, I like the positive comments more!\n\nAnthony\n\nThe weekend is almost here and it’s not just any weekend, it’s Father’s Day weekend. Whether you’re a dad, a granddad, or a great granddad, have a great one. Ladies, while you had your day of celebration last month, I hope you have a great day, too. I know first hand that there are some women out there that are better fathers than the biological father could ever be!\n\nWhile the weather isn’t shaping up to be all that great this weekend with showers and thunderstorms, especially Saturday and Saturday night, I hope you make the best of whatever we get!\n\nFATHER’S DAY\n\nWe have Gretel this weekend and she hasn’t mentioned doing anything for us.\n\nLast year, she made us the cutest card.\n\nIt had only been four months since Miss ABBA went to “puppy heaven”, but she still made an appearance on the card in her urn. 🙂\n\nWith assistance, Gretel made Father’s Day dinner for us in our old kitchen as it was being renovated. When you check out this video, listen to the age reference and why she’s doing it!\n\nAs Alf exclaimed in the 1980s, “Ha, I kill me!”\n\nHAPPY FATHER’S DAY CELEBRITY STYLE\n\nI just want to say a special Happy Father’s Day to Ricky Martin and his partner, Carlos Gonzalez Abella, from their twin sons, Matteo and Valentino, who turn five this August.\n\nAlso, to Neil Patrick Harris and his partner, David Burtka, from their twins — son, Gideon Scott, and daughter, Harper Grace. They turn three in October.\n\nAnd, to Elton John and his partner, David Furnish, from sons Zachary, who turns three on Christmas Day, and Elijah, who was born five months ago.\n\nHappy Father’s Day!\n\nTHE DOWN SIDE TO BEING VISIBLE\n\nWhile the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community continues to gain visibility, support, and equality across the United States and other countries at incredible rates, it’s coming with a price.\n\nGay bashing has always been a problem.\n\nBeatings and harassment at the hands of police prompted the historic “Stonewall Riots” in June 1969 (I blogged about this last Gay Pride and I’ll provide the link below for those of you unfamiliar with it).\n\nI remember standing outside the gay bar and sitting by the Riverfront in Paducah, Kentucky, with my friends back in the mid-1980s and rednecks would drive by making crude comments and hurling the derogatory f-word at us and on a few occasions, they’d even threaten us with baseball bats.\n\nBut, that was about 30 years ago and you’d think people would be more educated and more accepting today. Many are, but there’s still a long road to travel.\n\nThe National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reports that violence toward gays in New York City was up 4% last year over 2011. And, the number of gay bashing reports have doubled this year. In May alone, there were 10 reported anti-gay attacks in the Big Apple, including the shooting death of 32-year-old Mark Carson on May 17th in the West Village.\n\nAnd, it’s not confined the country’s largest city. In Ohio, “Outlook Columbus” reports that three gay men were beaten in separate attacks in the college town in the past week, including Christopher Ashcraft, who was visiting from Kentucky.\n\nHe told police that several men approached him asking for a jump-start. When he got his keys to help the men, he was attacked.\n\nAshcraft told a Cincinnati television station, “Once I was on the ground, they just kicked me in the face a couple times until I was unconscious. It was my guess an hour to an hour-and-a-half later before I woke up and, from what I’m told, crawled back to the bar where I was found laying behind the bar.”\n\nWhile one reason for the increase in the number of attacks may be that people, like in rape cases, are not as afraid today to come forward to report the crime, the bottom line is that ONE attack is ONE attack too many! I hope the bastards that get a cheap thrill out of beating people for being different (or beating, in general) get what they deserve and much more.\n\nThe violence has to stop!\n\n“Push Comes To Shove 43 Years Ago — The Stonewall Riots: https://anthonypeoples.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/push-comes-to-shove-43-years-ago-the-stonewall-riots/\n\nFALLING IN LOVE … AGAIN!\n\nOn a much lighter note, last Christmas I asked for a turntable. My album and dance single collection from the 1980s and the 1990s disappeared about 20 years ago, but I wanted to start buying some albums to get that vinyl feeling when listening to music.\n\nExcept for a few skips here and there, the second-hand albums that I’ve buying at used record stores and yard sales are so much fun. And, we all know how radio only plays the singles. It’s been interesting listening to the albums that I never would have bought back in the day and to hear many of the ten or so tracks that I would have missed.\n\nYARD SALE BARGAINS\n\nLast weekend, Ray, Tammy, and I went to several yard sales and it was so much fun checking out people’s treasures (and junk) that they were trying to get rid of it.\n\nIn addition to the previously mentioned albums, I bought some VHS movies (yes, we still have a player since I’m not converting my VHS collection to DVD), some books, and Christmas ornaments. I think I’ll have to check out more sales this summer.\n\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT\n\nFUNNY “HANNIBAL” JOKE\n\nFirst, a programming note: Only one more episode left! The season finale is Thursday, June 20th.\n\nMy friend, Stephanie Bowen, shared this “Hannibal” joke with me regarding characters Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter.\n\nHannibal: “Will, your lack of appetite worries me. How much do you weigh?”\n\nWill: “One graham.”\n\n(Hannibal stares dumbfoundly — Will smiles sheepishly)\n\nHannibal: “Don’t make me have to kilogram.”\n\nGONNA MAKE ME SWEAT!\n\nNow that I’ve officially set the date for my annual physical in October, I have to get serious about eating healthy and working out again. I think I’ve figured out how to jump-start my weight loss this summer: No air conditioning and walking on the treadmill until I sweat! Tuesday and Wednesday were perfect for that, although we broke down Wednesday and turned on the AC!\n\nKE$HA & PITBULL CONCERT\n\nWe all had a great time at last Sunday’s Ke$ha and Pitbull concert in Tinley Park. Gretel was excited to wear make-up and fake eyelashes and to color her hair.\n\nKe$ha was fun and her back-up dancers were a hoot dressed as warriors, drag queens, and animal mascots. While Ke$ha may have relied heavily on singing along to her own pre-recorded lyrics, it was still enjoyable. During one number she was going to put on a jacket to” add some color” to her outfit, but there was a wardrobe malfunction putting it on and she went on without it with a “Oh, f*ck it”!\n\nPitbull had an incredible light show and the man sure has some energy. He sang many, if not all, of his hits in his 75-minute set with many of the big stars (Enrique Iglesias, Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera, Chris Brown, and Ne-Yo) he’s performed with appearing on the stage monitor behind him. But, after a while, some of his songs blended together and sounded the same.\n\nWhat a great night with very enjoyable shows from Ke$ha and Pitbull.\n\nFACEBOOK FLASHBACK PICTURES\n\nWe have been debating on whether to put up Gretel’s outdoor pool this year. I think we’re leaning toward “no”.\n\nIt came in handy in the summer of 2010. Miss ABBA, who loved swimming, sure enjoyed it. This picture is from this week three years ago.\n\nEarlier in my blog, I talked about Gretel making dinner for us last Father’s Day. Here is the final product — linguine with lemon pepper and garlic chicken and veggies.\n\nNEW SONG I’M LOVING\n\nLast week, I featured the video for Hailey Rowe’s “My Boyfriend Is Gay”. I love that song and video. Another song that I’m really loving right now, in just two months, is already the most popular song in the country and one of the most played on Top 40 radio.\n\nRobin Thicke scored his first Billboard Hot 100 hit, “Lost Without U”, in 2007. While the song hit #14 on that chart, it topped the R&B chart. He’s gone on to score two more #1 songs on the R&B chart with “Sex Therapy” in 2009 and his new song, “Blurred Lines” featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams. “Blurred Lines” is also the new #1 song on the Hot 100.\n\nIt’s the first release from his new album of the same name that is being released at the end of July.\n\nBy the way, there is an “unrated” version of the video that was banned by YouTube. *Warning: Contains Boobies* *NSFW* *Not suitable when children are in the room*. Oh, who am I kidding, you’ve already clicked on the link!\n\nhttp://www.vevo.com/watch/robin-thicke/blurred-lines-unrated-version/USUV71300526\n\nPEEPS’ ’80s FRIDAY FLASHBACK\n\nSince I just featured Robin Thicke with one of my favorites songs out there today, let’s keep it in the family with one of my favorite female vocalists of all time. Robin is the son of actor Alan Thicke (“Growing Pains”) and actress/singer Gloria Loring (“Liz Chandler Courtney DiMera Craig Curtis” on “Days of Our Lives” from 1980-1986).\n\nAs a singer, Gloria Loring is best known on television as a singer on “Days of Our Lives” and for co-writing the themes to “Diff’rent Strokes” and “The Facts of Life” with her ex-husband Alan Thicke. Gloria also sang the theme song to “The Facts of Life” from the second season to the end of the series.\n\nGloria has released twelve albums dating back to her first in 1968. Although she is one of my favorite singers, her only Top 40 appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 came in 1986 when “Friends & Lovers”, a duet with Carl Anderson, reached #2. It hit #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts.\n\nRAY, HAPPY FATHER’S DAY!\n\nThis song, “The Best Thing About Me Is You” (“Lo Mejor de Mi Vida Eres Tu”) by Ricky Martin hit #1 on the U.S. Billboard Latin charts in 2011.\n\nThank you for taking the time to check out my random thoughts. I hope you took a moment to enjoy the videos. Have a great weekend!\n\nAnthony\n\nSINGER KE$HA\n\n“I don’t love just men. I love people. It’s not about a gender. It’s just about the spirit that exudes from that other person you’re with.”\n\nGOSSIP BLOGGER PEREZ HILTON\n\n(to rapper Azelia Banks): “Some of your music is cute, but your attention-seeking ways are pathetic and hurtful. You drag while others choose to uplift!”\n\nRAPPER AZELIA BANKS\n\n(who is bisexual, responded): “Whatever bitch, you tried to sign me to ur little bum ass label in ’11 with them bullss*it ass artists. omg u should just kill yourself… Like for real… lol what a messy fa**ot you are.”\n\nFORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE NEWT GINGRICH\n\n(to Huffington Post in December): “It is in every family. It is in every community. The momentum is clearly now in the direction in finding some way to … accommodate and deal with reality. And the reality is going to be that in a number of American states — and it will be more after 2014 — gay relationships will be legal, period.”\n\nFORMER NAVY CHAPLAIN GORDON KLINGENSCHMITT\n\n(responding to Gingrich’s comment by also saying he was influenced by “demonic voices” and is “worthy of death”): “It’s not like Newt is personally engaging in homosexual activity, but the Bible condemns him now because he takes pleasure in those that do that sort of thing. When the Bible condemns his endorsement of homosexual sin then he has become one of the sinners condemned by Romans, Chapter 1.”\n\nSINGER KELLY CLARKSON\n\n“People think ‘Oh, she’s been single for too long’ … That’s kind of an insult to the gay community… Being single doesn’t mean you’re gay. But I’m never insulted by it, obviously.”\n\nMORE KELLY CLARKSON\n\n“I get hit on by the hottest girls ever. Oh, my god, if I were a lesbian I would be so in luck.”\n\nREALITY STAR KIM KARDASHIAN\n\n(on her expected baby with rapper Kanye West): “Kanye and I are expecting a baby. We feel so blessed and lucky and wish that in addition to both of our families, his mom and my dad could be here to celebrate this special time with us.”\n\n“THE WALKING DEAD” SHOW RUNNER GLEN MAZZARA\n\nMy time as show runner on “The Walking Dead” has been an amazing experience, but after I finish season 3, it’s time to move on. I have told the stories I wanted to tell and connected with our fans on a level that I never imagined. It doesn’t get much better than that. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this journey.”\n\nACTOR NEIL PATRICK HARRIS\n\n(responding about the death of the paparazzo by a car that was hounding Justin Bieber): “I don’t know where the line is. I mean if the paparazzi stopped at every red light, they’d lose the picture. But they’re not the only people that run red lights. So you can’t come down on them hard. But I do think it’s trying for people who are trying to live their lives in an everyday way to be constantly accosted by not only people wanting their photo but being abrupt and derogatory in order to get a facial expression. That can’t be fun. I’m thankfully not that exciting so I don’t get a lot of that. But yeah, it sucks when people die.”\n\nAMERICAN IDOL FANTASIA BARRINO\n\n(in a tweet): “I rise above it all!!! The world is gone mad. Kids, the goverment, the church house… Everybody Trying!!!!!!! Its a lot that going on that the Bible speaks about we should Not be doing. Weed legal in some places, Gay Marriage Legal BUT YET IM JUDGED!!! Im not doing Nothing for you… My Life!!!!”\n\nFANTASIA’S EXPLANATION\n\n“It has been brought to my attention that something I said was taken out of context. I, Fantasia Monique Barrino, don’t judge anyone because I don’t want to be judged. The gay community is one of my largest supporters. I support the gay community as they support me. Bloggers please stop misrepresenting the facts.”\n\nMUSIC ICON MADONNA\n\n(during a Santiago, Chile sound check): “There are people smoking right now. No smoking. If you’re going to smoke cigarettes, I’m not doing a show. You don’t care about me, I don’t care about you. All right? Are we going to play that game? I’m not kidding. I can’t sing if you smoke.”\n\nMOVIE DIRECTOR STEVE SODERBERGH\n\n(about “Behind The Candelabra”, his HBO movie about Liberace): Nobody would make it. We went to everybody in town. They all said it was too gay. This is after ‘Brokeback Mountain,’ by the way, which is not as funny as this movie. The studios didn’t know how to sell it. They were scared.”"
