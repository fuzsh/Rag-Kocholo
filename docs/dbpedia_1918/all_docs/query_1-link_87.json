        "text": "Fans will soon see Neil Patrick Harris back on-screen, as he’ll appear in the third and final Doctor Who 60th anniversary adventure.\n\nAiring on Saturday, December 9, he is set to play “the greatest enemy” that The Doctor (David Tennant) has ever faced.\n\nNeil, 50, has pretty much done it all, and has worked as an actor, singer, writer, producer, and television host.\n\nBut what’s his life like away from our screens?\n\nInside Neil Patrick Harris' childhood\n\nNeil Patrick Harris was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he grew up with his older brother and their parents, Sheila and Ronald.\n\nThe star began his career as a child actor and was discovered by playwright Mark Medoff at a drama camp in Las Cruces, New Mexico, who later cast him in his first film, Clara’s Hart.\n\nHe shot to wider fame after playing the title character on the ABC series Doogie Howser, M.D, and as Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother.\n\nInside Neil Patrick Harris' career\n\nBetween 2017 and 2019, he starred as Count Olaf on the Netflix series A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\nMore recently, he starred in 2022 series Uncoupled as gay Manhattanite Michael Lawson, a realtor trying to navigate the dating scene after 17 years away.\n\nHe’s appeared in a number of well-loved movies, and last year was amongst the core cast of The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent.\n\nHis other films include Starship Troopers, Gone Girl, The Smurfs and The Smurfs 2.\n\nHis career on Broadway has also featured some notable roles, including the role of the Emcee in Cabaret in 2003.\n\nBack in 2014, Neil starred in the title role in Hedwig and the Angry Inch on Broadway, and later won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical that year.\n\nElsewhere, he’s scooped five Primetime Emmy Awards, and nominations for a Grammy Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nWho does Neil Patrick Harris play in Doctor Who?\n\nNeil will star as a character from The Doctor’s past called The Toymaker, who is set to cause absolute chaos for all involved.\n\nFans of the actor will remember he has worked with showrunner Russell T Davies in the past, appearing in award-winning series It’s A Sin.\n\n“He had never heard of [Doctor Who], never,” Russell previously shared to PinkNews. “He read the script then phoned me and said: ‘So, The Doctor’s an alien’. He really was from scratch.\n\n“He was so glorious in [It’s A Sin] so we knew him. It was [producer] Phil [Collinson] who said: ‘Oh, Neil would be perfect for this because he loves magic and magic tricks’. The Toymaker does play with cards and does do magic tricks and sleight of hand.”\n\nAfter his casing was announced, Neil shared an image of himself in the role with the caption: “My current gig. Never looked more dashing. Thank you for inviting me into your Whoniverse, @russelltdavies63 .\n\n“I’ll try my hardest to do my worst. This Doctor has no idea what’s in store. And even if he does… Who cares? Ha ha ha HA ha-ha-ha!”\n\nWho is Neil Patrick Harris married to?\n\nThe TV star has been in a relationship with actor and chef David Burtka since April 2004.\n\nNeil publicly came out as gay in November 2006, and said: “I am happy to dispel any rumours or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love.”\n\nDavid has appeared in a number of Broadway shows, including the musical The Opposite Of Sex.\n\nHe has also cameoed in some TV shows alongside his husband.\n\nDavid appeared in seven episodes of How I Met Your Mother, playing Scooter, the former high school boyfriend of character Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan).\n\nIn October 2010 they became parents to twins, son Gideon and daughter Harper, born via a surrogate mother.\n\nWhen the Marriage Equality Act in New York was passed on June 24, 2011, the pair announced their engagement.\n\nThey married in Italy in September 2014, with their wedding officiated by Pamela Fryman, the long-time director of How I Met Your Mother, while Elton John performed."
