        "text": "Recently married actors Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka caused a stir with their record purchase of a four-story, 8,000 square foot Harlem townhouse, which they extensively renovated and redesigned. We were thrilled to contribute a custom Lunaris colorway to the project.\n\nWorking closely with interior designer Trace Lehnhoff, Calico Wallpaper installed a feature wall in the master bedroom, described by Architectural Digest as “a sumptuously refined refuge, with velvety upholstery, brass lamps, and a hypnotic expanse of marbleized wallpaper.”\n\nIt was a pleasure to work with Neil Patrick Harris and partner David Burtka, who were actively involved in the design process and have created a beautiful home."
