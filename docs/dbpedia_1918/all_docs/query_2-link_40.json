He is known for his acting roles in theatre and television shows such as How I Met Your Mother and The Play About the Baby. After his role on How I Met Your Mother, Burtka gained media attention for dating Neil Patrick Harris, whom he later married in 2014.\n\nContents\n\nInside neil patrick harris and david burtka s harlem townhouse\n\nTop 10 times neil patrick harris and david burtka made us believe in love\n\nEarly life\n\nActing career\n\nPersonal life\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nTop 10 times neil patrick harris and david burtka made us believe in love\n\nEarly life\n\nBurtka was born in Dearborn, Michigan, the son of Deborah A. Zajas (d. 2008) and Daniel Burtka. He is of Polish descent. He grew up in Canton, Michigan, and graduated from Salem High School in 1993. He trained in acting at Interlochen Center for the Arts, obtained his Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Michigan and had further training at the William Esper Studios.\n\nActing career\n\nBurtka made his television debut in 2002 with a guest role on The West Wing; this was followed by guest appearances on Crossing Jordan.\n\nBurtka made his Broadway debut as Tulsa in the 2003 revival of Gypsy starring Bernadette Peters. He played The Boy in the American premiere of Edward Albee's The Play About the Baby, for which he won the 2001 Clarence Derwent Award for most promising male performer.\n\nIn 2004, Burtka originated the role of Matt in the musical The Opposite of Sex and reprised the role in the work's East Coast premiere in the summer of 2006.\n\nBurtka appeared in seven episodes of How I Met Your Mother, playing \"Scooter\", the former high school boyfriend of Lily (Alyson Hannigan), who still has not gotten over their breakup. Burtka made a cameo appearance in A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas as himself, sharing a scene with Neil Patrick Harris playing a part much like his character from How I Met Your Mother.\n\nBurtka starred in Osiris Entertainment's 2013 film Annie and the Gypsy and had a featured role in the 2014 film Dance Off.\n\nBurtka returned to Broadway in the David Hyde Pierce-directed It Shoulda Been You in April 2015, playing the Catholic fiance of a Jewish bride, played by Sierra Boggess, whose wedding day is disrupted when her ex-boyfriend shows up at the wedding. Additional cast members include Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSix months after Burtka's How I Met Your Mother appearance, allegations arose that the actor received the part because of a romantic relationship with one of the series' stars, Neil Patrick Harris. Speculation around this story eventually led Harris to publicly acknowledge that he is gay in a cover story in People magazine. Burtka made no public response to the story, though later Harris stated that he and Burtka were moving in together.\n\nBurtka and Harris attended the Emmy awards in September 2007 as an openly acknowledged couple for the first time, an appearance which Harris discussed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\nBurtka's mother died from cancer in May 2008.\n\nOn February 4, 2009, Burtka and Harris appeared for the first time on stage together singing a duet from Rent at a benefit for The LGBT Community Center in New York. The two actors have been together since April 2004. Harris refers to Burtka as \"my better half\" and \"an amazing chef\". Burtka and Harris are parents to fraternal twins Gideon Scott and Harper Grace, born in October 2010, via a surrogate mother. Burtka is not the biological father of his ex Lane Janger's children (who were also born via surrogate) but has remained close to them over the years.\n\nFollowing the passage of the Marriage Equality Act in New York on June 24, 2011, Burtka and Harris announced their engagement via Twitter, stating that they had proposed to each other five years earlier but had kept the engagement secret until same-sex marriage became legal in their state.\n\nAccording to Harris, Burtka quit acting full-time in order to become a professional chef. He graduated from Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts Pasadena in summer 2009 and afterward began running a Los Angeles catering company, Gourmet M.D. Nevertheless, Burtka does continue to act, most recently in It Shoulda Been You on Broadway in 2015.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n2024\n\nThe Mountain (Short) (completed) as\n\nDan\n\n2022\n\nUncoupled (TV Series) as\n\nJerry\n\n- Chapter 6 (2022) -
