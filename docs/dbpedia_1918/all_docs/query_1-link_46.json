        "text": "Preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\nTie the rosemary and thyme together with kitchen twine and set aside. Season the meat with 1 ½ teaspoons salt and ¾ teaspoon pepper. In a large Dutch oven, heat the canola oil over medium-high heat until the oil starts to shimmer, about 30 seconds. Add the meat and sear until deeply browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a large plate.\n\nReduce the heat under the pan slightly and add the butter. Once the butter has melted, add the mushrooms and onions (do not add salt at this point, or they will release too much liquid) and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are just tender, 8 to 9 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, parsnips, garlic, and a large pinch each of salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, until it darkens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\nAdd the herb bundle, bay leaves, and wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced and resembles a thick gravy, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the broth; increase the heat to high to bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until slightly reduced. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange the meat in the mushroom broth and pour any of the juices left on the plate over the meat. Cover, transfer to the oven, and bake until the meat is fork-tender, about 2 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes. Discard the herb bundle and bay leaves, then divide the vegetables and cooking liquid among six bowls and top each with some of the cooked meat. Sprinkle with the parsley before serving."
