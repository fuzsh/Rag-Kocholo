        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on June 15, 1973. His parents, Sheila Gail (Scott) and Ronald Gene Harris, were lawyers and ran a restaurant. He grew up in Ruidoso, New Mexico, a small town 120 miles south of Albuquerque, where he first took up acting in the fourth grade. While tagging along with his older brother of 3 years, Harris won the part of Toto in a school production of Das zauberhafte Land (1939).\n\nHis parents moved the family to Albuquerque in 1988, the same year that Harris made his film debut in two movies: Purple People Eater - Der kleine Lila Menschenfresser (1988) and Claras Geheimnis (1988), which starred Whoopi Goldberg. A year later, when Neil was 16, he landed the lead role in Steven Bochco's television series about a teen prodigy doctor at a local hospital, Doogie Howser (1989), which launched Harris into teen-heartthrob status. The series lasted1989-1993 and earned him a People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Series (1990) and a Golden Globe Nomination (1990). Harris attended the same high school as Freddie Prinze Jr., La Cueva High School in Albuquerque. Neil acted on stage in a few plays while there, one of which was his senior play, Anatevka (1971), in which he portrayed Lazar Wolf the butcher (1991).\n\nWhen \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" stopped production in 1993, Harris took up stage acting, which he had always wanted to do. After a string of made-for-television movies, Harris acted in his first big screen roles in nine years, Starship Troopers (1997) with Casper Van Dien and then Wunsch & Wirklichkeit (1998). In July 1997, Harris accepted the role of Mark Cohen for the Los Angeles production of the beloved musical, Rent (2005). His performance in \"Rent\" garnered him a Drama-League Award in 1997. He continued in the musical, to rave reviews, until January 1998. He later reprised the role for six nights in his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in December 1998.\n\nIn 1999, Harris returned to television in the short-lived sitcom Männer ohne Nerven (1999), with Tony Shalhoub. He was also in the big-screen projects Ein Freund zum Verlieben (2000) and Undercover Brother (2002), and he can be heard as the voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the newest animated Spider-Man (2003) series. Harris has continued his stage work, making his Broadway debut in 2001 in \"Proof.\" He has also appeared on stage in \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Cabaret,\" Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in Concert (2001), and, most recently, \"Assassins.\" In 2005, Harris returned to the small screen in a guest-starring role on Numb3rs - Die Logik des Verbrechens (2005) and a starring role in the sitcom How I Met Your Mother (2005). Neil played the title role in the web-exclusive musical comedy Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (2008), widely downloaded via iTunes to become the #1 TV series for five straight weeks, despite not actually being on television.\n\nLance Bass is the quintessential illustration of a highly successful and driven jack-of-all-trades: singer, host, actor, producer, writer, entrepreneur, philanthropist and cosmonaut.\n\nBeyond his fame as a member of the phenomenally successful group *NSYNC, where the group sold an impressive 60 million plus records worldwide, Bass has made himself a household name throughout the globe. With countless career highlights in music spanning the past 20 years, including multiple Grammy® nominations, two diamond RIAA awards, MTV Video Music Awards®, American Music Awards® and People's Choice Awards® to name a just a few, he has expanded his accomplishments into multiple entertainment mediums.\n\nBass can currently be seen as a daily contributing panelist on The Meredith Vieira Show (2014), which he joined in September of 2015. In 2007, Bass lit up Broadway, starring as \"Corny Collins\" in the smash hit, \"Hairspray\", published his revealing memoir, \"Out of Sync\", and danced his way to the finals on season seven of ABC's hit competition show, Dancing with the Stars (2005). In 2003, he was inducted into the Mississippi Musician's Hall of Fame, making him the youngest person to ever receive this honor. In 2012, he joined Sirius XM and launched a pop culture daily radio show, called \"Dirty Pop\", with Lance Bass and, during the weekends, hosts their \"Pop2k Countdown\", where he can still be heard today.\n\nBuilding on his passion for film and documentaries, Bass has established himself as an acclaimed producer with titles like Kidnapped for Christ, where he was awarded the Audience Award for Documentary Feature during it's Slamdance premiere this past January and Mississippi I Am, which recently won Best Documentary at the Manhattan International Film Festival. This November, he is being recognized for his outstanding achievements at the Mississippi Film Festival with an encore screening of Mississippi I Am. Other producing credits include the Miramax film, On the Line (2001), where he not only served as Executive Producer, but was also the film's star and earned him the coveted Movieguide® Award for excellence in family-oriented programming. In 2005, he executive-produced Randal Kleiser's romantic comedy, Lovewrecked - Liebe über Bord (2005), starring Amanda Bynes, Chris Carmack and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. He is also the recipient of the Golden Apple Award® as Male Film Discovery of 2001.\n\nWhile known for his success in music, including a #1 European dance single, in 2014, called \"Walking On Air\" and featuring newcomer Bella Blue, Bass has made numerous memorable guest appearances in film, television and as the animated voice in several popular children's cartoons. With his sights focused on hosting, Bass is preparing for his fifth consecutive year as co-host of the American Music Awards' Coca-Cola Red Carpet, has guest-anchored the KTLA Morning News in Los Angeles, filled in for Harvey Levin on TMZ and has become a frequent correspondent with the landmark entertainment show, Entertainment Tonight.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, he founded Famous Yard Sale, which was inspired by his memories of weekend yard sales in his hometown of Laurel, Mississippi, where he reinvented the yard sale as a virtual auction marketplace for celebrities to donate their excess belongings and raise money for their favorite charities. This led him to create and executive produce the Lifetime series Celebrity Home Raiders. Currently, he has partnered up with Slavco and Daniel Tuskaloski, and TeliApp to create Sparxx, a social relationship and dating app specifically designed for the LGBT community with the goal of breaking the mold of conventional LGBT dating apps. Sparxx was designed to help men and women and their personally defined sexuality, find meaningful and long lasting relationships.\n\nPhilanthropically, Lance remains active in various charitable organizations including serving on the Young Hollywood Board of the Environmental Media Association. He is also the National Youth Spokesperson for World Space Week, consistent with his interest in space travel. A fact that many are unaware of, Bass is a certified cosmonaut after several months of training in the Russian space program where Bass received cosmonaut certification and continued on to Houston's Johnson Space Center to take part in astronaut training. Additionally, Lance is a strong advocate for animals and has been a spokesperson for animal rescues all over the country, including directly working with Lucky Puppy, a dog rescue based in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nBass currently resides in Los Angeles with his husband Michael Turchin, whom he married in 2014 and was featured as a wedding special on E! in early 2015.\n\nRichard Chamberlain became the leading heartthrob of early 1960s television. As the impeccably handsome Dr. James Kildare, the slim, butter-haired hunk with the near-perfect Ivy-League charm and smooth, intelligent demeanor, had the distaff fans fawning unwavering over him through the series' run. While this would appear to be a dream situation for any new star, to Chamberlain it brought about a major, unsettling identity crisis.\n\nBorn George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, he was the second son of Elsa Winnifred (von Benzon) (1902-1993) and Charles Axiom Chamberlain (1902-1984), a salesman. He has English and German ancestry. Richard experienced a profoundly unhappy childhood and did not enjoy school at all, making up for it somewhat by excelling in track and becoming a four-year letter man in high school and college. He also developed a strong interest and enjoyment in acting while attending Pomona College. Losing an initial chance to sign up with Paramount Pictures, the studio later renewed interest. Complications arose when he was drafted into the Unites States Army on December 7, 1956 for 16 months, serving in Korea.\n\nChamberlain headed for Hollywood soon after his discharge and, in just a couple of years, worked up a decent resumé with a number of visible guest spots on such popular series as Rauchende Colts (1955) and Mr. Lucky (1959). But it was the stardom of the medical series Stationsarzt Dr. Kildare (1961) that garnered overnight female worship and he became a huge sweater-vested pin-up favorite. It also sparked a brief, modest singing career for the actor.\n\nThe attention Richard received was phenomenal. True to his \"Prince Charming\" type, he advanced into typically bland, soap-styled leads on film befitting said image, but crossover stardom proved to be elusive. The vehicles he appeared in, Rufmord (1963) with Joey Heatherton and Joy in the Morning (1965) opposite Yvette Mimieux, did not bring him the screen fame foreseen. The public obviously saw the actor as nothing more than a television commodity.\n\nMore interested in a reputation as a serious actor, Chamberlain took a huge risk and turned his back on Hollywood, devoting himself to the stage. In 1966 alone, he appeared in such legit productions as \"The Philadelphia Story\" and \"Private Lives\", and also showed off his vocal talents playing Tony in \"West Side Story\". In December of that year, a musical version of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" starring Richard and Mary Tyler Moore in the sparkling George Peppard/Audrey Hepburn roles was headed for Broadway. However, it flopped badly in previews and closed after only four performances. Even today, it is still deemed one of Broadway's biggest musical disasters.\n\nAn important dramatic role in director Richard Lester's Petulia (1968) led Richard to England, where he stayed and dared to test his acting prowess on the classical stage. With it, his personal satisfaction over image and career improved. Bravura performances as \"Hamlet\" (1969) and \"Richard II\" (1971), as well as his triumph in \"The Lady's Not for Burning\" (1972), won over the not-so-easy-to-impress British audiences. And on the classier film front, he ably portrayed Octavius Caesar opposite Charlton Heston's Mark Antony and Jason Robards' Brutus in Julius Caesar (1970), composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's grandiose Tschaikowsky - Genie und Wahnsinn (1971) opposite Glenda Jackson, and Lord Byron alongside Sarah Miles in Die große Liebe der Lady Caroline (1972). While none of these three films were critical favorites, they were instrumental in helping to reshape Chamberlain's career as a serious, sturdy and reliable actor.\n\nWith his new image in place, Richard felt ready to face American audiences again. While he made a triumphant Broadway debut as Reverend Shannon in \"The Night of the Iguana\" (1975), he also enjoyed modest box-office popularity with the action-driven adventure films Die drei Musketiere (1973) as Aramis and a villainous role in Flammendes Inferno (1974), and earned cult status for the Australian film Die letzte Flut (1977). On the television front, he became a television idol all over again (on his own terms this time) as the \"King of 80s Mini-Movies\". The epic storytelling of Der Graf von Monte Christo (1975), Die Dornenvögel (1983) and Shogun (1980), all of which earned him Emmy nominations, placed Richard solidly on the quality star list. He won Golden Globe Awards for his starring roles in the last two miniseries mentioned.\n\nIn later years, the actor devoted a great deal of his time to musical stage tours as Henry Higgins in \"My Fair Lady\", Captain Von Trapp in \"The Sound of Music\" and Ebenezer Scrooge in \"Scrooge: The Musical\". Enormously private and having moved to Hawaii to avoid the Hollywood glare, at age 69 finally \"came out\" with a tell-all biography entitled \"Shattered Love\", in which he quite candidly discussed the anguish of hiding his homosexuality to protect his enduring matinée idol image.\n\nMarried now to his longtime partner of over 40 years, writer/producer Martin Rabbett, he has since accepted himself and shown to be quite a good sport in the process, appearing as gay characters in the film Chuck und Larry - Wie Feuer und Flamme (2007), and in television episodes of Will & Grace (1998), Desperate Housewives (2004) and Brothers & Sisters (2006). More recently, he has enjoyed featured roles in the films Strength and Honour (2007), The Perfect Family (2011), We Are the Hartmans (2011), Nightmare Cinema (2018) and Finding Julia (2019).\n\nChristian Chavez was born on August 7, 1983 in McAllen, Texas, U.S. At the age of two, he Moved to Mexico City.\n\nIn 2002, Chávez was cast as Fernando 'Fercho' Lucena in the telenovela Clase 406. The series had four seasons and 350 one-hour episodes in total.\n\nIn 2005, Chávez joined a new telenovela Rebelde as Juan \"Giovanni\" Méndez López, a mischievous and rebellious student at a private boarding school in Mexico. Chávez became widely known for his ever-changing hair colors. The soap opera was transmitted in 65 other countries, including the United States, Mexico, Serbia, Peru, Romania, Brazil, Spain, Slovenia, Bulgaria Slovakia, Croatia and Albania. A major plot line of the show revolved around a group of six students forming a pop band. A notable aspect of the series is that Chávez and five of his other co-stars ( Maite Perroni, Dulce María, Anahí, Alfonso Herrera and Christopher Von Uckermann) became actual members of a real life band RBD. RBD created most of the music used on the show, and the six quickly became one of the most popular music acts in Latin America.\n\nAs part of RBD, Chávez went on to receive two Latin Grammy nominations, achieving multi-platinum status with more than 22 million digital downloads and more than 17 million albums sold worldwide. He has performed concerts in 23 countries in 116 cities, 15,000 articles of merchandising, and selling more than 3,000,000 concert tickets and 4 million DVDs.\n\nRBD's first album Rebelde, was released on November 30, 2004 by EMI. The first three singles (\"Rebelde\" (lead single), \"Sólo Quédate En Silencio\" and \"Sálvame\") were all number one hits in Mexico, with the fourth single, \"Un Poco De Tu Amor\" reaching number two.\n\nRBD's first national tour, Tour Generación RBD, included 45 sold out dates in Mexico including three visits in Monterrey performing for more than 150,000 fans. The tour was certified by OCESA as the fourth most rapidly sold tour in Mexican history. In July 2005 a live CD/DVD, Tour Generación RBD En Vivo was released documenting their tour around Mexico (45 sold-out concerts across the country, including sixteen in Mexico City alone).\n\nIn 2005 RBD released their second studio album, Nuestro Amor. This album set new record sales in Mexico, selling 127,000 copies on its release day, and 160,000 copies within its first week. In the U.S., the album topped the Latin Albums Chart for 3 weeks and peaked at #88 on the Billboard 200. The first four singles reached number one in Mexico. In the United States \"Nuestro Amor\", \"Aún Hay Algo\" and \"Este Corazón\" charted on the Hot Latin chart at #6, #24 and #10 respectively. Nuestro Amor also brought RBD a nomination for the Latin Grammy Awards in the category \"Best Pop Album by a Group or Duo\". They performed a new version of \"Tras de Mí\" at the ceremony.\n\nRBD's concert at the Los Angeles Coliseum is one of the fastest selling concert in the venue's history, beating megastar Madonna. In 2006, RBD sold 750,000 tickets becoming the 14th top selling act of 2006 worldwide.\n\nIn November 2006, RBD released their third studio album Celestial produced and directed by Carlos Lara which debuted at number 15 in the Billboard 200, marking first-week sales of over 137,000 copies in the U.S. The album however did not have a full week of album sales, due to its Friday release. Despite this, it became their first album to peak or chart within the top 20 of the Billboard 200\n\nIn December of 2006, RBD released their first English album Rebelswhich debuted at number 40 on the Billboard 200 album chart with first-week sales of 94,000 copies. Included on the album was \"Tu Amor\" a ballad written by Diane Warren and sung by Chavez.\n\nIn 2007, RBD became spokespeople for Pepsi and appeared in numerous ads televised throughout Latin America. In 2008, RBD performed for over 500,000 fans in Brazil, breaking the record previously held by the Rolling Stones. On August 14, 2008, RBD announced through a press release that they would disband in 2009. To this day, RBD is considered the most successful pop group in Mexican history.\n\nIn June 2007, Chávez appeared briefly in the stage show Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar, and in May 2008 he participated in Avenida Q (the Mexican version of Avenue Q), where he played the main puppet characters Eugenio (Princeton) and Rodri (Rod); his presence on the shows was intended to be one of the main box office attractions.\n\nAfter RBD's breakup, Chávez launched his career as a solo recording artist. His first studio album Almas Transparentes, peaked at number 56 on the Mexican pop charts.\n\nIn 2011, Chávez turned heads with the provocative music video for his single \"Libertad\" featuring singer Anahi which became an instant sensation on YouTube with more than 1,000,000 views within three days of its upload. The video featured Chávez in a church confessional telling a priest he was not sorry for his sexual preference. The video featured a cameo by Perez Hilton. \"The video looks super sexy,\" gushed Hilton on his blog PerezHilton.com. \"It's inspired us to unleash our own libertad.\" \"Libertad\" continues to be an anthem for gay youth throughout Latin America. Esencial Released 2012\n\nOn August 14, 2012, Chávez released the highly anticipated album Esencial, an acoustic compilation of songs performed at his show in São Paulo, Brazil in January 2012. People Magazine called the albums release \"the return of Christian Chávez\". A red carpet presentation of Esencial was held in Mexico City in June. Chavez performed duets with RBD co-star Maite Perroni and Mexican Pop/Rock Singer Ana Obregón.\n\n\"Sacrilegio\", a track on Esencial also released as a single, immediately landed in the top 10 on Mexican pop charts. Other notable songs on the album include \"No Me Olvides\", written for Chávez by Mexican singer Juan Gabriel, and a remake of \"¿En Donde Estas?\" sung as a duet with Indonesian pop star Agnes Monica.\n\nIn early March 2007, a magazine published pictures of Chávez signing documents and exchanging rings with another man, allegedly his Canadian boyfriend (and later identified as B.J. Murphy), outing Chávez with them. The pictures had been taken in 2005, the year in which gay marriages became legal in Canada. Chávez declared in March 2007, that the photos showed a part of him that he had not been willing to discuss previously.With his announcement, Chávez became the first openly gay Latin recording artist in history.\n\nOn 30 March 2007, after Chávez's announcement of being gay, Ricky Martín told The Associated Press of his solidarity with Chávez's public declaration, saying, \"Life is too short to live closed up, guarding what you say...(Chávez) has to be free in many aspects. I wish him much strength.\" Though Chavez is outspoken in supporting gay rights and opposing homophobia, he remains one of a handful of openly gay Latin actors and recording artists. He has been the face of numerous HIV awareness campaigns.\n\nIn 2009, Chávez confirmed divorcing his husband. The reason for their separation has been the subject of much speculation, but Chávez insists that their relationship did not end on bad terms: \"[Murphy] is a person I love and respect; I also admire him as a professional.\"\n\nIn March 2012, Chávez confirmed dating Los Angeles Real Estate Agent Ben Kruger after photos of them together were published in the tabloid TV Notas. and later People en Español.\n\nIn May 2012, People Magazine reported that Chavez had signed on as a spokesperson for the 2012 Reelection Campaign of Barack Obama."
