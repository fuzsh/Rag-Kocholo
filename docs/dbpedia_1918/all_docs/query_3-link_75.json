        "text": "When I wish upon a star, I hope it doesn’t make a difference who I are (am) Anything my heart desires I wish would come to me.\n\nBut it hasn’t. My dream is to write movies for Disney. Create Princesses, worlds, and just great movies. Or TV Shows. I just wish I could be a Disney Writer. To date I have gotten 30 rejections for even internships. Most of which I ironically got while I was in Disney World and “When you Wish upon a Star” was playing…tears were shed, a little kid asked me if I was ok, it was awkward.\n\nI remember screaming in my head “Disney, I have wanted to work for your company since I was five. I have the saved homework assignments to prove it from kindergarten to college all saying my dream is to work for your company. I am here at Disney World my favorite vacation spot, wearing a Lilo and Stitch shirt my favorite Disney Film, and I am listening to when you wish upon a star…have you not gotten the memo that I wished upon thousands of stars growing up wanting to work for you? That I literally have thousands of movie and tv show pitches for you and just want a chance. That I made my own Disney Princess movie to the fullest and the manuscript is sitting on my shelf, pitch packet ready to go? I guess not because you just sent me fifteen rejection emails.”\n\nRejection. It is a funny thing. It either motivates you or it hinders you. For me honestly it hindered me. I didn’t know what to do with my life. I did retail for a living, I gave up on writing, I literally thought my brightest future was going to be hopefully one day becoming a regional manager of Party City.\n\nMy dreams I had had since I was five were dead.\n\nUntil my Dad died.\n\nMy Dad always believed in me as a writer and always wanted me to be a writer to any capacity. He also believed I should go to grad school to get my MFA and then maybe my PhD. I just thought he was saying all of the Dad things you are supposed to say. But once he was gone I took them as literal advice.\n\nMy Dad was a college professor of great renown and he believed in me and told me I was a great writer. Or at least I was better than most of his graduate students in the MBA program. He enjoyed reading what I wrote, even the boring analytical essays.\n\nSo one day a week after the funeral I was sitting at his desk and crying my eyes out. Asking what should I do. I looked at my father’s gigantic framed Phd from Texas A&M and thought for a second I heard him say don’t give up.\n\nI decided that night I was going to apply to graduate school to earn my MFA in writing and then maybe go on to get my PhD like my father did. And then maybe through learning more I can achieve my goal of becoming a Disney writer.\n\nThis post is dedicated to my father who always believed in me.\n\nMaybe someday I’ll be able to get my dream of writing for Disney. Maybe someday my princess movie will be a real movie. Maybe someday I’ll get that condo in Disney he always wanted. Maybe I will be the Oscar award winning writer he always knew I could be. Maybe wishing on stars isn’t pointless. And maybe my dreams aren’t pointless either.\n\nI doubt the Disney company actually reads this, I doubt a lot of people actually read this or will read this post. But if they do: Hi my name is Rachel and I want to be a writer at your company.\n\nAnd if anyone reads this entry don’t do what I did. Don’t give up on your dreams and stop believing in yourself because of rejection. Do the opposite, persevere and keep going. Dreams are worth fighting for. And keep wishing on stars no matter how old you are. Because maybe, just maybe, when you wish upon a star it doesn’t matter who you are, and that maybe anything your heart desires will come to you.\n\nI started this blog as a way to gain a readership and to talk about Disney and maybe someday this may be the blog of an actual Disney writer who wrote a Disney Princess Film and saw that princess be inducted into the Princess fold at Disney World.\n\nHere goes nothing and here is to wishing on stars.\n\nA few months ago Disney announced they were officially making the beloved musical Wicked into a live-action movie. So the big question is who is already in it and who should be in it? First according to the Movie Pilot article no cast members have been announced as of yet. But the writer adapting it is Winnie Holzman who wrote My So Called Life and Huge (DiDonato 2015) and the director is set to be Stephen Daldry who directed Billy Elliot, The Reader, and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. (DiDanato)\n\nSo the film is in great hands. But now in a dream world who should be in the cast the first two are no brainers here.\n\nElphaba (Wicked Witch of West): Idina Menzel\n\nGlinda (Good Witch of the North): Kristin Chenoweth\n\nThey were the original Elphaba and Glinda so why not them? Idina has been in two major Disney Films: Frozen and Enchanted and Kristin has only been in Muppets Studio productions, most recently appeared on the new Muppets TV show. But they should in a perfect world be brought back to rock the film!\n\nNow Nessa aka The Wicked Witch of the East I think should be played by\n\nLea Michelle\n\nLea and Idina played a daughter/mother couple on Glee so they know how to play family members and they do look a lot alike. Sisters? I think we can believe it.\n\nBoq I think should be played by: Aron Tveit\n\nWe know he can sing, he played not only Danny Zuko on Grease Live, but he also played Enjolras in Les Miserables and he also was in Gossip Girl and Graceland. He can act he can sing and he has that cute boyish look about him. And if Lea is to play Nessa in my version he is about the same age as her. So it works out.\n\nFiyero, this is a tough one. An actor who can sing, act like Gaston but also act like a kind soul at Act II. He’s also got to have a certain cockiness about him. I would say Neil Patrick Harris or Johnny Depp…But no. I’m going to have to say…\n\nNathan Fillion.\n\nBut I feel Neil Patrick Harris should be in this movie and so should his Husband David Burtka.\n\nFirst David Burtka I think should play Christery the lead flying monkey. He can dance, he can act, I think that would be a good choice.\n\nAnd Neil Patrick Harris as Doctor Dillamond, the goat professor. His singing voice is great and it’d be cool to see him in that makeup.\n\nPlus their kids would love it:\n\nSo now the other two male roles left are the father and the wizard…I think Johnny is too young for the Wizard but he would be good as the father. So I will in my fantasy world place him there.\n\nSo the wizard, a “sentimental man” also must work with Meryl Streep. We all know she is going to be cast as Madame Morrible. So I am going to say\n\nStanley Tucci. He has co-starred with Streep before so it’d be a great match up.\n\nSo Madame Morrible Merryl Streep\n\nand those are the main cast members in my fantasy world. Feel free to argue or post your own thoughts. But one thing we all know is that this movie is going to be AMAZING!\n\n———————————————————-\n\nDiDonato, Peter. “Wicked Movie Confirmed! Release Date Planned for 2016!” Moviepilot.com. N.p., 08 Jan. 2015. Web. 19 Nov. 2015.\n\nI have been to Disney World five times: when I was 5, when I was 10, when I was 13, when I was 15, when I was 21 and I will be going my sixth time as a 23 year old this year but as a honeymoon.\n\nIt is safe to say I have been to Disney as a small child, as a kid, as a teen, and as a young adult. And every experience my family went and as I grew older, so did the way we approached things.\n\nMy first time at Disney I was an only Child, but we brought my cousin who was 11 at the time with and it was my mom and dad who had been to Disney World before.\n\nThe second time I was 10 and had a 5 year old brother and my mom and dad.\n\nThe third time I was 13 and had a 8 year old brother and my mom and dad.\n\nThe fourth time I was 15 and had a 10 year old brother and my mom and dad (this time my dad was on a business conference at Disney so he didn’t get to see much of the parks)\n\nand the fifth time I was 21 and my brother was sixteen and mom and dad went with us.\n\nThis time it will just be my fiancee and I and we are both 23.\n\nThrough all of those experiences I have gained many tips on how to make your Disney experience the best it can be! I will make a separate post for things to do as an adult at Disney, because this one is geared more for the family that is going to Disney.\n\nSo here is my list of tips\n\nGo to AAA to book. They have your back and they find all sorts of discounts even up until a few months before you need to pay. Shout out to the Villa Park AAA for helping us all these years! While you can book Disney yourself, it is a lot easier and a lot less stressful with a AAA agent. Also they have books on Disney World.\n\nStay on Disney Property. I have stayed at: The Polynesian, The Boardwalk Inn, The Wilderness Lodge, and I have stayed off property. Staying on Property is the best because you get more out of the vacation. You are closer to the parks, you get a refillable drink cup, if you splurge and go on the floors with special service, it is amazing! Also Boardwalk Inn, if you go with that floor you get a room with snacks, like little beef wellingtons, that has the most fantastic view of the fireworks at Epcot. Off property you don’t get as much as of an experience. My fiancee and I are staying at the Port Orleans French Quarter and can’t wait!\n\nGet the dining plan, it is great!\n\nSpeaking of dining plan make sure to book sit-down meals 6 months in advance. They fill up. And the sooner you book the better seats you get. My biggest recommendations for dining are: Cinderella’s Castle, The Be Our Guest Castle, The Crystal Palace, San Angel Inn (Mexico Epcot Showcase), The Hoop Dee Doo Review, The Spirit of Aloha Luau, and the Sci-Fi Dine-In Restaurant. These are great! There are more but these are my favorite. Also character dining is a great opportunity to meet characters and have them sign things without going to the hassle of waiting in a line.\n\nWhen you get there if your hotel room is not ready don’t worry about it. They generally can keep your luggage and you can go to the parks while you wait.\n\nIf you are celebrating something go to guest services and get a button. Life is more fun with a button.\n\nInteract with characters! Don’t just ask them to sign something, play along! It’s more fun and you get better pictures and better memories.\n\nParades. Some people love the parades, some don’t. We saw the parade time as a great time to go on more rides or to get lunch because almost the entire park went to the parade, once because of a parade we got to go through Buzz Lightyear’s Light Spin 3 times in a row no line. BEST TIME EVER!\n\nSpeaking of Buzz Lightyear’s Light Spin…I got a perfect score. Yup 999,999,999. I maxed out the screen. My brother called it cheating, I called it taking advantage of an opportunity. The ride stalled, my lazer still worked though and I found that at the bottom of Evil Emperor Zurg is a spot that gives you 100,000 points. Aim there. I got a button but what I ultimatly won was lifelong bragging rights against my brother. Who can put a price on that?\n\nGo to the Epcot World Show Case and get the passport thing. It is fun, even if you are 21. My brother and I did it by ourselves while our parents were having adult time (They went to a time share meeting and were really considering it). It was awesome and so worth it. (I wish we got the time share though)\n\nFast Pass. The new system allows you to sign up for fast passes ahead of time. Fast passes are good but also with Disney’s latest updates to the ride, the “line ride” is actually quite fun and interactive. Especially The Haunted Mansion, Winnie the Pooh, and Toy Story. The only occasion we used fast passes for was to go on a ride two times in a row. Lines go by fast.\n\nSee Fantasmic! It’s beautiful\n\nDrink lots of water, you do a lot of walking and exercising without knowing it.\n\nALWAYS PACK A RAIN PONCHO OR UMBRELLA! You never know when it is going to rain or stop raining.\n\nPack extra bags, you are going to be bringing stuff back with you.\n\nRemember sun tan lotion!\n\nYou can have things mailed to your house. If you think an item may be harmed in the process of going home with you have them mail it.\n\nYou can have the places you buy stuff from send it to the front gate or even your room if you stay on property.\n\nThe Magic Wrist Band can be used as a way to purchase things!\n\nGet Memory Maker, it is extra but that way you don’t need to carry a camera and the Disney photographers make sure you get a perfect shot….even if my brother refused to smile in any of the photos.\n\nIf you have a child wait until they are 5 for their first Disney Trip. That way less nap times, they can remember it, and you can stay out just a teensy bit later than if they were 3.\n\nDowntown Disney is worth going to! Make sure to add it on your to do list.\n\nDon’t work while at Disney. At Disney you are supposed to be in a constant family vacation mood. But with more magic. And honestly you’ll thank yourself during the vacation for taking a total vacation from work responsibilities.\n\nSplurge, don’t be cheap! Disney is fun and magical don’t hold back. Peter, my fiancee, if you are reading this I know I am 23 and will be a wife but I am getting another Disney Pillow Pet, another Disney Tsum Tsum, mouse ears, and other things. Just as I know you will buy everything Star Wars.\n\nBe a kid even if you are not a kid. Disney is a time to act silly and be a kid again. My Dad, before he died, told me you never are truly an adult. And at Disney you are always 5. But if you are an adult you are a 5 year old who can drink! The Saki bar in Japan is amazing, so are the margaritas in San Angel Inn.\n\nAnd always remember to let your conscience be your guide!\n\nLast night in a bunch of articles ranging from other Disney Blogs to the Huffington Post announced that Winnie the Pooh is in fact a girl bear. And people are loosing it. (Kind of like the whole Starbucks cup thing)\n\nWhich I don’t get why people are getting so offended over the gender of a bear in a cartoon series. (I also don’t get why people are getting offended over a cup, but that is for a Starbucks Blogger to attend to)\n\nUp until yesterday the only characters with a defined genders were Kanga and Roo because she is a mother and he is her son. Here let’s take a look at our main characters and let me blow your mind with some gender education.\n\nFirst Winnie the Pooh\n\nYes she is voiced by many different male voice actors, and in the books she is referred to as a he. BUT does it truly matter what gender we perceive our favorite willy nilly silly old bear? Pooh wears red, anyone can wear red. Pooh loves honey, lots of people love honey. For the entirety of Winnie the Pooh, Pooh has worn gender neutral clothing. Also Pooh is a stuffed animal…they all are. Let’s keep that in mind as we press on.\n\nAlso in terms of voice acting gender never really plays a role in that. Good voice actors can voice both genders. For example Tara Strong, currently Twilight Sparkle on My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, before that Timmy Turner on Fairly Odd Parents. She’s done a bunch of other voices too, she is very talented.\n\nMoving onto the next character\n\nPiglet. When we look at piglet we associate the color pink with girl so most people think that piglet is a girl (poll done by me at a gender studies program on Winnie the Pooh) but Piglet has a very boyish voice. Piglet is never referred to as he or she. So how could we know? And does it matter? Piglet is just a cute worrywart who is adorable and loves flowers. There is no gender defined by the wearing of pink, worrying, or loving flowers.\n\nNext:\n\nTigger the top is made of the rubber, the bottom is made of the spring. pounces, trounces, pounces, trounces, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, but the most incredible thing about Tigger is that Tigger is the only one. Tigger is outgoing, sporty, and loves to bounce. None of these are indicators of gender. Girls are outgoing and sporty; Boys are outgoing and sporty. And who doesn’t love a trampoline? So does it matter if Tigger is male or female no, because Tigger will forever be the only one. (Though I will bring up in some instances Tigger refers to himself as a he)\n\nThen:\n\nEeyore. The depressed donkey who is always misplacing their tail. At my event this lead to another debate over gender. Some of the guests said that Eeyore was clearly female because of the bow on her tail, it was pink. Others said with a voice that deep how could Eeyore not be a guy? In the series Eeyore is never given a gender. Eeyore is Eeyore. And as stated before wearing pink doesn’t make you automatically female. Timmy Turner wore a pink hat, but was identified as a he. And having a deep voice doesn’t designate you as male. On Venture Brothers Doctor Girlfriend has a deep voice but is a female. Can’t we just let Eeyore be Eeyore?\n\nThen:\n\nOwl. Also never given a gender, but most people see Owl as a male because of voice.\n\nThen:\n\nRabbit. Now here is an interesting character. Rabbit in the past has been identified as both genders. In the 90s TV show she had a nephew and was called “Aunt Rabbit”, but in the 2011 movie was identified as a male. At my event people were torn by Rabbit. The voice was “non-gender specific” by poll and the activity of gardening came into question. Because was it farming: masculinly perceived, or gardening: femininely perceived? Again does it matter? Can’t rabbit be rabbit? Though no matter what gender Rabbit is the only character whose sexuality has been identified. Rabbit is interested in female rabbits as is shown in a thought bubble in the 2011 movie. So that is very interesting that Rabbit, a rabbit, is the only one with an announced sexual identity despite whatever gender Rabbit is.\n\nThen:\n\nKanga and Roo. The only characters with identified genders. Kanga is female, Roo is male. Kanga refers to Roo as him, he, throughout the books, movies, and tv shows. and Kanga is referred to as her, she throughout the books, movies, and tv shows. Also in Kangaroos male kangaroos do not have a pouch, Kanga has one, Roo does not.\n\nand then there is\n\nBut Gopher is not mentioned in the books. As Gopher states in the original Winnie the Pooh movie. Still no Gender is given.\n\nSo I am going to play my favorite scene from the latest movie. And ask yourself, would knowing the genders of the characters of this world really make a difference for how you perceive it?\n\nThey never use gender identifiers, and in the 100 Acre Wood it doesn’t matter. So what if Pooh is a girl? Winnie the Pooh will always be a beloved part of Disney with or without Genders the way we choose to perceive them or not.\n\nSo on Facebook there has been a post on what the cast of a live action Atlantis the Lost Empire would be. Totally fan made, this is not a thing. But here is the picture:\n\nOk uh uh this is not cool. Honestly has this fan seen the movie? Heard the accents? Know the essence of the characters? Probably not.\n\nNumber one Danny Devito, while he looks the part of mole could anyone seriously see him doing a French accent? No.\n\nIt seems like this fan compiled this by look and not actual acting range. Oh and can I talk about white washing Kida?! I mean seriously. Kida looks like this:\n\nIs Jessica Alba that dark? This is an insult to Disney fans who truly love the movie and to the one of the most badass Disney Princess. And they didn’t even cast her father? Really?\n\nSo here are my suggestions not on look alone but on talent, accurate representation, and some might stay the same.\n\nFirst Milo. He is a nerdy guy and he is 32. He is obsessed with finding Atlantis and very quirky. He looks like this:\n\nSo we need an actor who is around 32, can pull off this look and that level of quirkiness and excitement. I am going to say:\n\nSimon Helberg. He most notably plays Howard on The Big Bang Theory is just 3 years older than Milo. And from his performances in not only The Big Bang Theory, but also Dr.Horrible’s Sing Along Blog, A Cinderella Story, and his expierence on MadTV he shows he can be nerdy, animated, and could definitely play this character.\n\nNext Kida. She is around 85 or 100 but looks like she is in her late twenties. She is tough, intelligent, caring, and knows every single language. She is a total badass so we need an actress who would be fitting to that. And LOOK LIKE HER….I’m looking at whoever thought Jessica Alba was a good choice right now…\n\nSo here is another photo for reference:\n\nMy suggestion for Kida would be:\n\nVanessa Hudgens. She is pacific islander, 26 and from all of her performances we know she would deliver the necessary balance between kindness, soft, caring Kida and total bad-ass Kida. And Milo looks older than Kida anyway, so the age difference I think wouldn’t matter so much.\n\nNext you have the main villains: Commander Lyke Tiberius Rourke and Helga Katrina Sinclair.\n\nHere is what they look like in the film:\n\nLike is at first a kind, adventurous, warm blooded American Adventurer but then shows his true intentions in the end so you need someone who looks about in their early sixties, who is a badass, but can act both as a good guy and then a bad guy. This requires an excellent range of acting. Now this one is out there I admit but:\n\nBrad Pitt. He is only in his fifties but he can act. He has played numerous soldiers which would give him the ability to play a believable commander, He has played good guys and bad guys (sometimes within the same film). With a little makeup he would rock that role.\n\nThen Helga. She’s a tough cookie from the get-go but has a sultry quality about her. She is about maybe her thirties/forties so we need an actress who can play a stone cold badass.\n\nSo why not the equally talented actress and his wife Angelina Jolie? They work great on camera together and I think it would be great to see them play two villians on screen.\n\nSo now the crew.\n\nI’m going to start with my favorite the young tomboy spit fire Audrey Ramierez.\n\nFor her I would have to say hands down Dascha Polanco. Most notably she played Dayanara Diaz in Orange is the New Black and through that I see her doing a great job as Audrey.\n\nThen Mole…The weirdo who is short and has a great french accent. Danny Devito would be a go to but, he doesn’t do accent work well. And mole is nothing like Danny Devito. We need a short weirdo who can do accents all day long. We need H John Benjamin\n\nHe is relatively short, not Danny Devito, but still on the shorter side for a man at 5’6”. He’s done voice acting for years. Plus he sort of looks like Mole\n\nNow Vinny, explosives guy. Fun fact the actor who voiced him ad-libbed the entire script. So therefore I vote we just bring him back. No one can play Vinny like Don Novello, sure he has aged, but with him does it really matter?\n\nHe was a hit on SNL and he brought the voice of his character Father Guido Sarducci to Vinny. I’ve added my favorite video of him as Father Guido Sarducci just to emphasize that no one could play his character like he did.\n\nNow for Dr. Strongbear Sweet, I will acknowledge he looks like Terry. But the problem is Terry can’t act like Dr. Strongbear Sweet or has that deep lulling voice. So for Dr. Strongbear Sweet I have to say another instance of the original voice actor playing it, Phil Morris.\n\nHe was the character and has a wide acting range from being on Star Trek and other TV shows.\n\nNow for Cooky, we have a crazy thin old man. Who do we know that could play him?\n\nJames Brolin. Originally I posted George Carlin, but a friend of mine reminded me that he had died…But through watching Life in Pieces He could definitely work here.\n\nThere are other characters out there but according to the chart here are my suggestions. Here is the cast put together with their counterparts:\n\nand my other suggestions\n\nCree Summers actual voice actress for Kida to play her mother\n\nMorgan Freeman as Kida’s father\n\nChristopher Llyod as Whittemore\n\nJessica Lange as Willhemina\n\nNow will this ever happen, probably not. But since the popularity of the post I thought I’d weigh in.\n\nSo by now most of you have seen the latest Marvel movies and have seen this image:\n\nThis is Thanos aka super bad guy aka guy who wields the Infinity Gauntlet. This Gauntlet is what holds the key to the start of the Infinity Wars, which is expected to be two movies in the Marvel Universe.\n\nNow to power the Gauntlet he needs all 6 of the infinity Gems\n\nDisney has changed the color meanings of these gems though.\n\nNow we know as of right now where the location of some of the gems are.\n\nThe Purple Gem, The Power Gem, is in the custody of Nova Corps after the first Guardians of the Galaxy Movie. It was originally in the hands of the Celestials but we know from the movie that Peter Quill, aka Star Lord, had it most of the film, then of course Ronan had it for a hot second in which Star Lord started a distraction dance off.\n\nAnd then friendship circle, and then they gave it to Nova Corps where it currently resides.\n\nThe Yellow Gem, The Mind Stone, circa Thor and Avengers actually belonged to Thanos, but then it made its way to Loki who had it in his scepter, but after Avengers it was in the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D, then Hydra stole it, and after Avengers Age of Ultron, it currently is in the middle of Vision’s forehead.\n\nThen the Blue Gem, The Space Gem, is in the Tesseract which resides in Asgard.\n\nThen the Red Gem, The Reality Gem, which unlike the other Gems appears as a liquid and uses hosts to work. Most notably it infected Jane Foster in Thor into Darkness. It currently resides with The Collector, Taneleer Tivan. Whose one collection was exploded, but we cannot assume it was there because he wouldn’t keep multiple stones in one collection. So is it with him still or not? Feel free to comment below.\n\nSo we are missing two:\n\nThe Orange Gem and The Green Gem. To what Disney films have made their powers we don’t know but the only two powers left are: The Time Gem and The Soul Gem.\n\nWhere in the Marvel Universe are they?\n\nWe know sadly, they won’t be in DeadPool because that is a FOX film.\n\nSome speculators believe that the upcoming movie Doctor Strange will contain a Gem. My guess would be on the Time Gem and it being the Green one.\n\nThey are running out of movies in Phase 3 so the remaining possibilities are: Captain America:Civil War, Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Untitled Spider Man Movie, Thor: Ragnorok, and Black Panthar,\n\nThese all come before the Avengers: Infinity War Part 1. So I’m going to assume they have to be in those films.\n\nBut after Part 1 we have other films: Ant man and the Wasp, and Captain Marvel will be before Part 2. So there could be one there.\n\nAfter both parts of the Infinity War there will be a film introducing a lot of new characters called: Inhumans.\n\nSo 2 Gems, where are they?\n\nMy theory is Doctor Strange has one and that some how Star Lord’s Dad is in possession of the other and it would be the orange one because of the body scan where Nova saw he wasn’t totally human and had something orangey in him. It would also help to explain how he could hold the gem for so long by himself.\n\nHave another theory? Just comment below!\n\nSo after we first got engaged we knew our theme right off the bat: Disney.\n\nAnd we are going all out for this wedding. All out!\n\nFirst we decided that the bridal party would be different princesses including me. I based it off of personality and my friends seriously embody these princesses:\n\nI am going to be Cinderella (Live Action version), my maid of honor is Belle, my sister in law is Ariel, my cousin is Alice (I know not a princess), then I have Merida, Tiana, Jasmine, Mulan (not a princess but classified as one by Disney) , Snow White, Ana, and finally Tinkerbell (not a princess but close enough).\n\nMy flower girl is Venelope VonSchweetz from Wreck it Ralph.\n\nAnd then on the Grooms side my soon to be husband is Darth Vader, his best man is Darth Moff, and all the others are Stormtroopers.\n\nThe Ring Bearer is R2D2.\n\nGranted we will not be in costumes but formal wear, much to my fiancee’s dismay he really wanted the cape.\n\nBut everyone seems like they are going to come in cosplay. I already have confirmations of Hera, Minnie, Mickey, Gaston, Mary Poppins, another Alice, Robin Hood and Maid Merriam, and more.\n\nThe best thing though about this wedding is that at the reception every table is a different movie with different themed presents. My favorite is our Beauty and the Beast table with a replica of the rose in the container, the magic mirror, and books. Their favors will be chocolate roses and compact mirrors.\n\nWe did also incorporate Marvel and Star Wars tables.\n\nI will be posting mock ups of the tables soon!\n\nStar Wars Episode VII. By now everyone has seen the trailer, either the theatrical or the one where the characters from Inside Out! watch the trailer (it is quite hilarious here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4Ff1b7_Duw )\n\nAnd it looks amazing! To all the people who said Disney would ruin the series ha! Let’s just be glad that Jar Jar Binks won’t be in this one….hopefully… there is that Kilo Binks meme going around:\n\nBut there is no way Jar Jar could be Kilo…. As Simon Pegg says\n\nMy Fiance and I really hate Jar Jar, as most fans of Star Wars do. I mean it was his suggestion to the Senate that got Palpatine into power in the first place. Granted he was manipulated, but I mean c’mon Jar Jar if you are going to put someone like that in charge you should just be like all the rest of the corrupt government officials and take a bribe or something, not just be manipulated. Though My Fiance brings up Jar Jar wouldn’t have brought it up had Padme not left with Ani…but still. So if you would like to debate in the comments below: Who is at fault Padme or Jar Jar Binks for Palpatine being given complete power?\n\nMoving on from the whole Kilo Binks theory.\n\nThis movie looks amazing. BB8 is an actual robot not just a puppet. And it is super smart. I saw the video from a convention of it and wow. Also I mean it’s adorable.\n\nAlso it looks like all the original cast members seemed to have aged well. I mean just look at Chewbacca’s hair\n\nas compared to his first appearance:\n\nLo’real because this wookie is worth it.\n\nOn a seperate amazing note I got the pleasure of meeting Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) at Wizard World Chicago and I got pictures taken and autographs signed. He is an amazing guy.\n\nSo also Disney announced that this was not going to be the only Star Wars movie they will release. They plan on having Episode VIII, Episode IX, and two other films one surrounding the gap between Episode III and Episode IV with the rise of the rebellion. And the other a origin story of Han Solo and Chewie….I have been waiting for this my whole life!\n\nTo prepare for the films I have been actively binge watching everything star wars, currently I am on season 3 of The Clone Wars animated series. I need to catch up so then I can watch Rebels, which looks utterly amazing.\n\nSo now I’m going to ask a few questions and feel free to enter your opinions in the comment section.\n\nIs Darth Vader Dead? He has to be right? But fan theorists suggest he is alive.\n\nWho should play Han Solo in the origin movie? If you could pick any actor who would it be?\n\nKilo Binks real thing or joke? I hope it’s a joke.\n\nBest way to see Episode VII, midnight release or waiting a couple of days?\n\nI myself snagged 7pm release tickets at Hollywood Blvd in Woodridge, IL. with fun events all night long. I’ll be sure to take pics and post them. I might be cosplaying as an ewok.\n\nMay the force be with you!"
