        "text": "Alexandra Hedison & Jodie Foster - Married Since 2014\n\nWhen Jodie Foster was a guest in Late Night with David Letterman, the host irreverently implied Foster’s sexuality and how sad it would be that she could never be with a man. However, Jodie Foster thinks otherwise as she is happily married to Alexandra Hedison – a director, artist, and teacher. Meanwhile, Foster is considered as one of this generation’s “greatest actresses.”\n\nHedison used to be Ellen DeGeneres’ girlfriend. Foster and Hedison wed in 2014, a year after they met. Foster has two kids with her former partner, Cydney Bernard. Her eldest son is reportedly pursuing an acting career while the youngest prefers to stay out of the limelight.\n\nMichael Turchin & Lance Bass - Married Since 2014\n\nWhen Lance Bass was a member of the boy band NSYNC, little did anyone know that he would be inclined to prefer those whose gender was the same as his.

The two wed in 2014 after two years of dating. They were the first same-sex couple to exchange vows on cable TV via the show, \"Lance Loves Michael: The Lance Bass Wedding.\" And the rest, as they say, was history.\n\nPortia De Rossi & Ellen DeGeneres - Married Since 2008\n\nEllen and Portia are currently the most famous LGBTQ+ couple in Hollywood. Considered as a power couple, their relationship has stood the test of time. It was 2004 when they began dating. Portia was working as a model and actress, while Ellen was doing standup comedy. After four years of being together, they tied the knot in a public wedding.\n\nThey also serve as a premier example of a relationship that is based on love – sexuality aside. Ellen has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom due to her active role in propagating LGBTQ+ rights. Meanwhile, Portia is a philanthropist. The couple also loves animals and works with animal rights advocates. Surely, Ellen and Portia can do no wrong.\n\nDavid Burtka & Neil Patrick Harris - Married Since 2014\n\nThe star of the 90’s series, \"Doogie Howser, MD,\" Neil Patrick Harris, and chef David Burtka are everyone’s relationship goals. Both are successful in their own right. Harris is an accomplished actor, host, and Broadway star, while Burtka similarly dabbled in the profession but is now focused on his other passion of cooking. Though they are out and about now with their relationship, they didn’t use to be this loud and proud about it.\n\nBack then, their relationship was not within the knowledge of the public despite them being already engaged. They kept their love for each other secret for five long years and only made their entire relationship official in 2009, announcing their engagement two years later. However, before their wedding, their twins were already born in 2010 through surrogacy.\n\nLauren Morelli & Samira Wiley - Married Since 2017\n\nOrange isn’t just the new black, it officially became red – Valentine’s Day red to be exact — due to the relationship it helped bloom. Lauren Morelli, the \"Orange Is the New Black\" writer, met Samira Wiley on set where the latter played a character named Poussey Washington. Since then, the two have been inseparable.\n\nThe two eventually became engaged in October 2016 and got married a year later. Morelli used to be married to a man but later realized she was gay while working on the set of \"Orange Is the New Black.\" She eventually got divorced and has not looked back since.\n\nHolland Taylor & Sarah Paulson - Together Since 2015\n\nJust when you thought you had seen everything, here comes a relationship that is definitely one for the books. Actress Sarah Paulson (born in 1974) is in a relationship with the mother of Charlie Sheen’s character in the sitcom \"Two and a Half Men\" – Holland Taylor (born in 1943).\n\nThough some may raise their eyebrows with this scenario, these two could not care less. Why would their relationship be any different from when a young woman is in a relationship with a man 30 to 40 years her senior? Age is just a number after all, as shown by this couple.\n\nJane Wagner & Lily Tomlin - Married Since 2013\n\nLily Tomlin first burst into the entertainment scene during the 1960s as a stand-up comic. She later won a slew of awards due to her performances on television, film, and Broadway. And for many decades, Tomlin has been a true icon in the LGBTQ+ community. But it was an event in 1971 that Tomlin best remembers fondly.\n\nShe met writer and would-be wife Jane Wagner when Tomlin invited Wagner to collaborate with her on an LP record album titled \"And That’s the Truth.\" Since then, the two have been together as a couple, though there were no formal coming-out announcements. They tied the knot in December 2013.\n\nBethany Meyers & Nico Tortorella - Married Since 2018\n\nNico Tortorella, actor and star of the comedy series \"Younger,\" is pansexual and is married to gay lifestyle and fitness entrepreneur, Bethany Meyers. The two exchanged marital vows in March 2018 in a New York City courthouse while wearing white wedding gowns. Prior to their marriage, the two had been in a relationship for more than a decade.\n\nThe couple’s unconventional wedding reflected their similarly non-traditional relationship. The two, despite being married, do not live together. However, they do see each other weekly. They communicate by using FaceTime each day. As far as we are concerned, we say do your thing, Beth and Nico!\n\nAnthony Wayne & Kendrell Bowman - Together Since 2012\n\nAnthony Wayne and Kendrell Bowman always seemed to be a match made in heaven. Wayne is a Broadway star who made his debut in 2011 via the musical \"Anything Goes.\" Meanwhile, Bowman’s official title is stylist and creative image consultant to the stars.\n\nWhen the two joined together, they became a force everyone had to reckon with — in a good way. The two technically engaged in doing work for \"You Make Me Feel Mighty Real: A Sylvester Concert\" – a successful off-Broadway musical where Wayne served as the star while Bowman was the show’s creative director and costume designer.\n\nGeorges LeBar & RuPaul - Married Since 2017\n\nHosts of the biggest shows on TV need to be in healthy relationships too, you know. Popular drag queen RuPaul, who is considered the United States’ most commercially successful drag queen and the man responsible for mainstreaming the art of drag, tied the knot in 2017 with his boyfriend Georges LeBar – a painter from Australia.\n\nThe couple have been together for about three decades. LeBar and RuPaul met in 1994 at New York City’s Limelight nightclub, and they have been together ever since. LeBar has a 50-acre Wyoming Ranch. RuPaul describes himself as a shapeshifting drag queen who does whatever he wants at any time.\n\nChristine Quinn & Kim Catullo - Married Since 2012\n\nLove doesn’t always have to happen at first sight. Just ask Kim Catullo. That is exactly what happened with her and her eventual partner. When she was asked to meet Christine Quinn, she refused to do so. But it was a matter of time before they eventually fell in love. Around the time Quinn was running for mayor, something remarkable happened.\n\nThe two tied the knot. Catullo and Quinn are now happily together seemingly forever. The two are now married and their wedding was filled with the who’s who of the city. Some of the special guests from that impressively long list included Chuck Schumer, Michael Bloomberg, and Andrew Cuomo.\n\nParis Barclay & Christopher Mason - Married Since 2008\n\nParis Barclay is a name that resonates within the realm of television, with notable contributions to acclaimed series like \"CSI,\" \"ER,\" and \"The West Wing.\" However, beyond his professional achievements, Barclay cherishes the recognition of a different kind—his deep bond with his life partner, Christopher Mason.\n\nFor a few decades now, their love has endured, blossoming with unwavering strength and resilience. While Barclay's directorial prowess has garnered attention, it is in the quiet moments shared with Mason where he finds true fulfillment. Their enduring partnership serves as a testament to the power of love and commitment, a source of inspiration for others seeking enduring connections.\n\nJose Manuel Colon & Orlando Cruz - Married Since 2013\n\nWho said male boxers can’t get married to men? Unfortunately, due to the culture in the sport and the backlash that they would receive, not many find love in same-gender relationships. But Orlando Cruz couldn’t care less about what people would think. Cruz is the first professional boxer to be open and out about being gay while still working as a boxer.\n\nSince he came out, he won his first fight in October 2012. In 2013, he was one of the first inductees to the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame. Cruz went on to marry Jose Manuel Colon in Central Park.\n\nSimon Doonan & Jonathan Adler - Married Since 2008\n\nLove is timeless. So when Jonathan Adler met Simon Doonan, the two were smitten and have never parted with each other since. That was 1994. Fast forward to 2008 when the couple decided to make their relationship more solid in the legal sense. That's right folks, these two lovebirds decided to tie the knot after all those years.\n\nAdler and Doonan got married in California via a wedding ceremony that celebrated their union. Though it took them some time to make their relationship more binding, the couple seems to believe a wedding is mere icing on the cake. And we think that's a pretty sweet way of doing it.\n\nPatrick Leahy & T. R. Knight - Married Since 2013\n\nRemember T.R. Knight from \"Grey’s Anatomy?\" You know, George O'Malley?

A year later, they tied the knot and are now living happily as a family with their twins.\n\nJackson is serious about being a dedicated dad.

However, it was through Tig when she exclaimed, “Oh my god, I am fully in love with this person.”\n\nGuillermo Díaz and His Partner - Together Since 2005\n\nSome people prefer to keep their privacy to themselves rather than allow it to be out in the open. They treasure their private time and refrain from sharing information about themselves. It's a pretty logical idea, right? And Guillermo Diaz is a pretty good case study for this idea – the popular star of the series \"Scandal.\"\n\nDiaz has professed that he is indeed gay, and openly too. He also has been enjoying a committed relationship with a significant other that he has not named or identified – or would even like to give a clue of. But love is allowing them to be so let them be.\n\nScott Gill & John Barrowman - Married Since 2013\n\nIt was 1993 when John Barrowman, a writer, singer, actor, and presenter of Scottish descent, watched a play and fell in love with one of the actors.
