        "text": "But as much as I loved the time I spent away from the show, I loved the time I spent at the show more. I got to spend day after week after month after year working and fooling around with four people you’ve come to know very well. That’s right, kids—How I Met Your Mother is how I met your Aunt Cobie, Uncle Josh, Aunt Alyson, and Uncle Jason! (Although ironically it’s not how I met your mother. You don’t really have one.)\n\nCobie Smulders is an extraordinary person. She is a cool-ass chick, superfunny, supergenerous, and superhot without obsessing about it. Spending the last season planning our characters’ wedding was true to life for me, because she’s exactly the kind of woman I would want to marry if women weren’t all gross and icky. Classic Cobie story: Joss Whedon was going to turn Wonder Woman into a movie and asked her if she’d be interested … and she said no. Who does that? Cobie Smulders. She was clear-sighted enough to know she didn’t want her life trajectory to take her to a point where she had to constantly be aware of how she was looking for the paparazzi. She chose to actively avoid the A-list superstardom track, a choice most people would find insane, because most people aren’t as smart or grounded as she is. Instead she got a nice little part in The Avengers, and now she’ll get to be in seven Avengers movies and still be with her family and have a fairly regular life and go to the mall without hearing “Look, it’s Doogie!” all the time.\n\n(I mean, “Look, it’s Wonder Woman!” “Doogie”?!? Ha! Don’t know why I said that.)\n\nJason Segel and I hit it off immediately. We bonded over our many common interests, above all our deep Muppetophilia. I didn’t think there was a bigger Henson fan than me until one day, halfway through the run, he quietly but proudly told me he was writing the new Muppet movie. He did, and not only was he the star, he almost single-hand-in-a-puppet-edly reinvented them for a whole new generation. I was extraordinarily jealous. He used to sit at the on-set piano and sing and play songs. He’s a hopeless romantic and a dashing lothario.\n\nI used to joke that Josh Radnor was on the wrong show. I mean that in the best way. He instinctively fought against the over-the-top pitfalls of a multicamera comedy. Double takes, mugging, and shtick aren’t part of Josh’s makeup. Popular music was not popular to him. When Katy Perry guest-starred on the show, he said he’d never heard a Katy Perry song. He meant it. I said, “You’ve never heard ‘I Kissed a Girl’? You can’t escape it!” “Never heard of it.” He’s more of an NPR guy.* But ultimately he was on exactly the right show, because none of HIMYM’s lunacy and farce would have worked if it hadn’t been playing against something or someone authentically based in reality, and that was Josh. That’s why I also used to joke that HIMYM was always one Josh Radnor away from becoming a telenovela with all of us dressed as Bumblebee Man from The Simpsons.”\n\n*Whereas I’m more of an NPH guy.\n\nGet it? “NPH”?\n\nI’ll show myself out."
