The How I Met Your Mother alum called it the \"best decision ever.\"\n\n\"Happy anniversary, David. You are my top priority, my constant inspiration, my baby daddy, and my best friend. Going on a date with you seventeen years ago? Best. Decision. Ever. Thanks for the love, and the laughs, and the life. Youâ€™re the best. @dbelicious,\" Harris wrote next to the sweet selfie of him and his husband of six years.\n\nBurtka returned the love, commenting under his husband's post, \"I love you more- there I said it!!\"\n\nThe couple celebrated their six-year wedding anniversary in September. Harris honored Burtka by posting a photo from their 2014 wedding in Italy along with a heartfelt message.\n\n\"Six years ago. Perhaps the happiest day of my life. Since then, thousands of memories. No regrets,\" he wrote. \"Thank you, David, for both creating and rocking my world. I am forever #grateful.\"\n\nBurtka also posted a photo from their nuptials along with a sweet note. \"Six years ago today @nph and I got hitched. Thanks for dancing into my heart. I can't believe you stuck around after all these years of me annoying you. ðŸ˜‚,\" the 45-year-old cookbook author captioned the candid wedding pic. \"You have made my heart complete. Thank you for the best times of my life. #6yearanniversary\"\n\nThe couple shares two children together, 10-year-old twins, Harper and Gideon."
