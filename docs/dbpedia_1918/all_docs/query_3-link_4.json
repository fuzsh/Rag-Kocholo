        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris is celebrating 50 with some love from his biggest fan: husband David Burtka. Harris turned 50 on June 15, and got a sweet tribute from Burtka on Instagram. Alongside a photo of the longtime couple together, Burtka wrote, \"I can not believe you are 50!! Happy Birthday. You still look so damn hot.\"\n\nBurtka continued, \"You continue to surprise me on how amazing you are. As we both grow older, our connection gets deeper and our love grows stronger. Let's keep laughing through the next 50. #50to50.\" One image in the slideshow featured a childhood photo of the former \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" actor, which was photoshopped to include \"50\" candles.\n\nHarris also celebrated the milestone on social media, posting a shirtless Instagram picture. In the caption, he wrote, \"Fifty. Let's GO.\" The post garnered a slew of comments from Harris's celebrity pals, including former \"How I Met Your Mother\" costar Cobie Smulders, who wrote, \"What a stud. Love you❤️.\""
