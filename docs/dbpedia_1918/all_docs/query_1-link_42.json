        "text": "Love is love—just ask famous queer couples.\n\nIn honor of Valentine's Day, we're celebrating Hollywood's most endearing LGBTQIA+ love stories. From longtime pairs like Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka and Elton John and David Furnish, to newer romances like the ones that blossomed between Kristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer and Ben Platt and Noah Galvin, it's obvious these stars have found their soulmates.\n\nTake, for instance, after Niecy Nash Betts. After announcing her marriage to Jessica Betts in August 2020, Nash Betts perfectly described how—for her and many other people who identify as LGBTQIA+—love and attraction are about so much more than gender identity."
