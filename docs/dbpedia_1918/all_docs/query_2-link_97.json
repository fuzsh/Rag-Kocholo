        "text": "(lighthearted music)\n\nHarlem's amazing.\n\nFor value's sake, you can get a lot of space\n\nand retain the history and an appreciation of it.\n\nWhen we found this place, we loved the fact\n\nit had solid bones.\n\nWhen it was built in 1904, it was a speakeasy\n\nfor Irish mill workers.\n\nIt's a really great place to live.\n\nWhat's harder: raising two four-year-olds\n\nor renovating a home?\n\nOof, the hardest is doing both simultaneously\n\n'cause kids need naps and renovations need noise.\n\n(upbeat music)\n\nOne of the challenges of the townhouse\n\nis the way people lived at the time\n\nwas very much partitioned into separate rooms.\n\nYou had front parlors, and rear parlors,\n\nand dining rooms, and butler's pantries.\n\nThere's an instinct to really want to\n\nbreak out all the walls and open the whole floor up,\n\nbut of course, it can often feel like a bowling alley\n\nif you're not careful, so one of the things we did\n\nwas make sure that we were always creating\n\nthe sense of discreet rooms that flowed into each other,\n\nbut they're always have a little bit of a break\n\nbetween them.\n\nIt's a very important thing to make sure\n\nthe house still feels like it belongs,\n\nthat we haven't done anything to it\n\nthat makes it feel overly modernized.\n\nNeil and David collect art that's more mysterious,\n\nand darker, and moody, and so the house\n\nkind of reflects that vibe.\n\nWe love collecting art.\n\nWe've been doing it for about nine years now.\n\nBefore we were even laying anything out\n\nin the blueprints, we just made sure\n\nthat there was spaces for these things that they had.\n\nThere's a talking parrot,\n\nthere's a few art pieces that are recessed into the wall\n\nthat have boxes behind.\n\nWhen we were on our honeymoon in Barcelona,\n\nwe passed by this crazy little shop\n\nthat had all these amazingly weird things,\n\npillows with creepy women,\n\nand in the windowsill was this strange\n\ntaxidermied rat.\n\nMy dad gave me a bunch of money for our wedding\n\nand he was like--\n\nUs, gave us.\n\nNo, it was for me,\n\nand he said, Go buy something in Barcelona with it.\n\nAnd so I ended, I chose that!\n\nDavid is actually a trained chef,\n\nso when we started working on the kitchen,\n\nit was all about that big island and making sure\n\neveryone can gather while he's working.\n\nThey're always worried about things being too precious\n\nbecause it is a family.\n\nNeil requires everything to serve a purpose.\n\nIt needs to function, and David is different\n\nand he just wants things to look nice.\n\nI really love this room.\n\nIt feels homey, it's warm,\n\nwe watch TV here, we hang out with the kids,\n\nwe read books every night on this couch.\n\n[Neil] Yeah, David wanted this room to feel\n\nkinda like an adventurer's club\n\nfilled with stuff on the walls and oddities,\n\nwhich fits right into my world because I love magic\n\nand he likes taxidermy, and I like sideshow carnival freaks.\n\nThis room is awesome.\n\nNeil has a magic office, and in order to\n\nget into the magic office, you have to press\n\na little button on a poster that pops open\n\na poster that's hanging on the wall\n\nthat reveals a door to go inside.\n\nAt the front door of the house,\n\nwe have an apothecary cabinet.\n\nWe designed it to have secret compartments.\n\nWhen people are leaving, each person could\n\npick a drawer and take something,\n\nwhether it be like a 25 cent ring\n\nor a gift certificate or something.\n\nAt the end of the day, kids can be crazy,\n\nbut then they come and cuddle with you\n\nand it's all wonderful, and with renovation,\n\nit all can be crazy, and at the end of the day,\n\nyou're sent a bill and you have to sign a gigantic check.\n\nI think I like kids better.\n\n(lighthearted music)"
