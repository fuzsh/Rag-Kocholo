He made homemade chicken soup when he didn’t get a job; he made chocolate cake after a fight with a friend. This love of food led him to go to cooking school and become a professional chef. At the start of his career he had a chance to work at the legendary restaurant Babbo in New York under the tutelage of the great Mario Batali, where he learned how to make Mario’s famous Bolognese. This recipe for pasta with Bolognese sauce is David’s personal take on the classic dish. David says this sauce is best with homemade pasta but in a pinch dry pasta will do just fine. You say, oh sweet Babbo, is this good.\n\nNote: Although the sauce will work on any type of dried or fresh pasta, David likes to make his own. Yes, it can be time-consuming, but it’s totally worth it.\n\n4 servings\n\nFor the Pasta\n\nPlace 2 cups of flour in a pile on counter. Use your fingers to make a hole in the center of the flour (a “well”).\n\nBreak the eggs into the well; add olive oil and a pinch of salt.\n\nBreak the yolks with a fork, and in a swirling motion beat them slowly to incorporate into the flour. You can swirl to your favorite late-’80s dance song—David prefers Technotronic’s “Pump Up the Jam.” Be careful not to break the walls of the well until the eggs are fully incorporated.\n\nAdd a tiny amount of water and knead with your hands until a dough forms. (Note: Add only enough water to make the flour sticky, but not wet. If you add too much water and your hands get sticky, use a little more flour.)\n\nContinue kneading 5 to 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and bounces back. (To test the dough: Press your finger into it to make an indent. If it bounces back, the dough is ready. If it screams in pain, something’s gone horribly awry.)\n\nForm a flat disk with the dough, cover in plastic wrap, and let rest for 30 minutes on the counter.\n\nSet up a pasta roller; place die setting to 1 (the widest setting).\n\nTake one-quarter of the dough (leave the rest covered) and flatten it out with the palm of your hand or a rolling pin to about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Place the dough on the pasta roller and crank through each setting twice, starting on the lowest setting. When you get to setting 6, pull through only once.\n\nUsing a pastry wheel, cut 1-by-9-inch strips for pappardelle. Put the cut pasta in layers on a baking sheet with parchment between layers to keep them from sticking. Keep the pasta covered so it won’t dry out as you repeat step 8 with the remainder of the dough. Remember to turn the setting back to 1 with each new batch of dough.\n\nStore fresh pasta, covered, in the refrigerator until ready to use.\n\nDo not allow loved ones to snack on it. Use force if necessary.\n\nFor the Bolognese\n\nAdd the garlic and continue to sweat for 2 minutes. (The garlic, not you.)\n\nIncrease heat to high and add the veal, pork, and pancetta. Brown the meat, stirring frequently to break it up while combining with the vegetables.\n\nOnce the meat is browned, add the tomato paste, wine, and milk.\n\nBring to a boil.\n\nAdd the chicken stock, thyme, oregano, and a pinch of red pepper flakes (or more if desired). Return to the boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, uncovered, stirring occasionally.\n\nSeason with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nAdd the butter and stir until it is incorporated. Place in a large serving bowl.\n\nFor Serving\n\nIn a large pot bring at least 6 quarts of salted water to a boil.\n\nPut fresh pasta in the pot and boil for 2 minutes, or until it floats (do not drain).\n\nTransfer the pasta and a few tablespoons of pasta water from the pot to the serving bowl with the Bolognese.\n\nDelicately combine the pasta and sauce.\n\nServe with shaved Parmesan to your loved ones.\n\nEnjoy their moaning.\n\nMake them do the dishes.\n\nRecipe reprinted from"
