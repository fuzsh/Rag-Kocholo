        "text": "The award-winning actor—on TV (How I Met Your Mother), in film (Gone Girl), and onstage (Hedwig and the Angry Inch)—will now host the 87th Academy Awards. Here, he compares his career to the “Greatest Show on Earth”\n\nWhat is your idea of perfect happiness? Probably being granted all-access to a Disney theme park with my husband, David, and a group of close friends—and just us—while we wandered and drank tropical tiki drinks. No judgment, no lines, no bad weather, and no hangovers. Oh, and our twins would be there too, but only when they’re happy and meltdown-free. I guess the same would go for David.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear? That it all goes away and never comes back.\n\nWhich historical figure do you most identify with? P. T. Barnum.\n\nWhat is your greatest extravagance? I bought a fantastic Yamaha Disklavier piano last year.\n\nWhat is your favorite journey? David threw me a week-long scavenger hunt for my 40th birthday—it took me across the country. Best thing that has ever … no, could ever happen to me. He’s the jam.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse? I say the word “like” too much.\n\nWhat is your greatest regret? Not going to college—it’d have made me smarterer and stuff.\n\nWhat or who is the greatest love of your life? My husband, David Michael Burtka. After more than 10 years, he still surprises me with his depth and makes me laugh. When he is happy my entire world is alive.\n\nWhen and where were you happiest? I have many passions: magic, puppets, theater, architecture, etc. So I would have to say I’m happiest in places where all of those come together—at a Cirque du Soleil show or a Disney theme park, or immersive theater.\n\nWhich talent would you most like to have? I’d love to be able to dance with great skill.\n\nWhat is your current state of mind? I’m harried—trying to compartmentalize many things in many worlds and give them all the attention they deserve.\n\nIf you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? I’d forgive myself more.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement? Fathering two absolutely exquisite children.\n\nIf you could choose what to come back as, what would it be? Probably one of those new Tesla cars.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession? Oddly, I still have my four wisdom teeth. I refuse to let them go or I’ll lose my wise parts. I also have a painting from the original Haunted Mansion in Disneyland. I fear if I talk about it too much someone in a plaid suit will show up at my door with some sort of warrant.\n\nWhere would you like to live? Hawaii. I can’t wait for Elon Musk to make those underground super tubes so I can travel there in 15 minutes.\n\nWhat is your favorite occupation? Imagineer.\n\nWho are your favorite writers? David Sedaris, Paulo Coelho, Anthony Bourdain, and my brother, Brian.\n\nWho is your favorite hero of fiction? I’m torn between Indiana Jones and Kermit the Frog.\n\nWho are your heroes in real life? President Obama, Pamela Fryman, and Jim Henson.\n\nWhat is it that you most dislike? Entitlement.\n\nHow would you like to die? Quickly and by surprise. I don’t want the specter of death to linger."
