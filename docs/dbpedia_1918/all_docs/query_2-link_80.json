Have a great weekend, LinkedIn! THE RITUAL NPH: We’ll bathe the kids and get them in pajamas and have a family dinner. David doesn’t drink too much, but I may have wine. After eating, we go upstairs to our den. Gideon and Harper each pick out a couple of books from the shelf, and we settle into our big leather couch. We read to them until 7:30, and then they go to their rooms for bed under duress. Gideon can have trouble sleeping so we put on this meditation app called Headspace for him. Luckily, once they’re down, they don’t wake up again until the morning."
