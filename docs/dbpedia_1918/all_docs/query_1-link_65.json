        "text": "If you’re looking to raise your own young theater buffs, Hedwig and the Angry Inch star Neil Patrick Harris and his husband, David Burtka, have a some scheduling ideas.\n\n“We tested the waters on a Disney cruise ship that had a 40-minute show of Aladdin,” said Harris of his four-year-old twins. “Matinees are at nap time and the evening shows are at bedtime, so it’s a bit tricky right now.”\n\n“Their first Broadway show was The Lion King,” said Burtka. “They sat through the first act, we got to intermission and ate some candy, and then I was tired, the kids were tired, and Neil looked over and all three of us were asleep.”\n\nTheater was front of mind for the couple and other attendees on Tuesday night at a fund-raising gala for London’s National Theatre, hosted by Anna Wintour, Michael Kors and National Theatre director designate Rufus Norris. Guests were ushered from a performance of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Barrymore Theatre to a late-night dinner with the cast of the stage adaptation of the best-selling 2003 novel by Mark Haddon. Those on hand included Hugh Jackman, John Lithgow, Karlie Kloss, and Kendall Jenner.\n\n“I did my first-ever play at the National,” said The Affair star Ruth Wilson, who performed on the London stage in shows such as Anna Christie and A Street Car Named Desire. “It’s around the corner from where I live, and I go see everything that they put on.”\n\n“[The Curious Incident] is such an innovative show,” said Wilson. “The young lead —it’s his first show out of drama school—and he’s fantastic.”\n\n“I’m having a blast, but it can be a bit overwhelming sometimes,” said Alex Sharp, the recent Juilliard graduate who is making his Broadway debut as Christopher Boone, the protagonist of the story. “It’s an honor bringing the character to the life.”\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor, the 12 Years a Slave Oscar nominee who recently finished a role as murdered African hero Patrice Lumumba in A Season in the Congo, gave the production a ringing endorsement: “It’s a modern classic and the young star does a really brilliant performance.”\n\nIt was all good news for director Marianne Elliott, who originated the play in London, but wanted to shake things up a bit for the New York production.\n\n“We went with all American actors and the show is about the actors telling the story, so therefore it feels very different, very refreshed,\" she said."
