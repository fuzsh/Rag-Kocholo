        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris is a newlywed.\n\nThe TV and Broadway star wed David Burtka, his partner of 10 years, on Saturday in Italy, Harris’ rep confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“We happily confirm that Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka were married in Italy in an intimate ceremony surrounded by their close friends and family,” Harris’ rep said in a statement.\n\nHow I Met Your Mother director Pam Fryman officiated, while the Tom Ford-clad couple’s two 3-year-old kids — daughter Harper and son Gideon — also were part of the ceremony, which took place in Italy. Elton John, a friend of the couple, performed at the reception.\n\nHarris tweeted about the news on Monday morning.\n\nThis marks the first marriage for both Harris, 41, and Burtka, 39.\n\nHarris, who recently won a Tony for his role in Broadway’s Hedwig and the Angry Inch, next appears in David Fincher‘s adaptation of Gone Girl. Burtka, who recurred on HIMYM, next stars in the film Dance Off. The couple also appeared together as versions of themselves in 2011’s A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas.\n\nTrending on Billboard"
