And are infinitely adorable) David Burtka and Neil Patrick Harris, celebrated one year of being married this weekend.\n\nThe couple tied the knot last September after a 10 year relationship, have two children together, and are well known for being ridiculously adorable together. So, of course, Neil Patrick Harris marked the occasion in a sweet way, sharing an understated, but still romantic, message dedicated to his long-term love on Instagram.\n\n\"One year ago today I had the pleasure of marrying David Burtka,\" he wrote. \"I'm so happy that I did - he's a truly wonderful man. Here's to many more laughs and adventures..!\"\n\nTwo words: relationship. goals.\n\nNow, let's take a minute to look at some recent moments of David Burtka and NPH adorableness, because they are guaranteed to make your day a little bit better.\n\nWhen NPH appreciated what he has.\n\nWhen they had wholesome family fun on a beach in The Hamptons.\n\nWhen Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka chilled by a sunset, and NPH called David handsome. Aww.\n\nWhen they messed around in the kitchen.\n\nWhen they casually went clamming.\n\nWhen they WON Halloween.\n\nAnd when they made it official."
