        "text": "From high-profile design commissions to exciting listings, there is always something new happening in the world of real estate. In this roundup, AD PRO has everything you need to know.\n\nOn the Market\n\nNeil Patrick Harris lists Harlem home for $7.325 million\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and husband David Burtka have officially listed their Harlem brownstone for $7.325 million. Located on Fifth Avenue between 125th and 126th Streets, the 8,000-square-foot house has four bedrooms with a library that can easily be converted into a fifth.\n\nThe five-story Italianate house was built in 1907 and in previous incarnations has served as a speakeasy, a bed and breakfast, and a music school for girls. Harris and Burtka bought it in 2013 for $3.6 million, and moved in with twins Harper and Gideon, and the family’s two dogs in 2015, shortly after Harris wrapped How I Met Your Mother and came to Broadway with Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\n\nA major renovation by L.A. interior designer Trace Lehnhoff and New York architect Jeffery Povero kept the original woodwork, millwork, and molding, but reshaped the space to better suit a single family—and updated the plumbing, AC, and appliances.\n\nThe house has separate production offices and a 10-seat home theater—as well as a gym, wine cellar, and a playroom.\n\n“Every single room tells its own story. There is no forgotten corner,” Vickey Barron, who has the listing with fellow Compass broker Pacey Barron, tells AD PRO. “My favorite is the space between the kitchen and the vintage bar, which was sourced from an old Connecticut hotel. It’s a whimsical, transportive area of the home and it’s impossible not to enjoy spending time here.”\n\nThe second floor houses the living room, formal dining room, spacious kitchen and pantry, and an outdoor deck with a built-in gas barbecue. The primary bedroom, which has its own gas fireplace and outdoor jacuzzi, is up on the third floor.\n\nThree additional bedrooms are on the top floor, along with a “hidden” room that’s been serving as Harris’s private office: Its door can only be opened by pressing the eyeball of a magician on a vintage poster.\n\n“I come from a Scooby-Doo mentality, where there are secret doors and the eyes on pictures move,” Harris told Architectural Digest in 2016. Inside, the Tony winner has decorated with more magic posters, props, and original art from Disneyland’s The Haunted Mansion ride.\n\nMohamed Hadid seeks record $250 million for L.A.’s largest home\n\nThe largest home ever permitted in Los Angeles County comes to market this month with an asking price of $250 million.\n\nThe seller is real estate developer Mohamed Hadid—father to supermodels Bella and Gigi and ex of reality star Yolanda—who is still constructing the 38-acre compound off lower Coldwater Canyon Drive.\n\nIf he gets even close to that price, it would make the 19-bedroom, 33-bath lair the most expensive residential property ever sold in California—easily blowing away the $165 million Jeff Bezos paid in 2020 for David Geffen’s Beverly Hills estate.\n\nAccording to Hilton & Hyland’s Rodrigo Iglesias, who is handling the listing, the property is expected to be completed within the next two years and will include a bowling alley, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a movie theater, and a 26,000-square-foot guest house.\n\n“This unique enclave will encompass the epitome of luxury living, location, views, and privacy, which are features that buyers at this level will pay a premium for,” Iglesias told Forbes.\n\nHadid’s unfinished Bel Air mega-mansion, the source of ongoing legal woes, will hit the auction block on September 27. Developer Bruce Lifton initially went into contract on the spec mansion in May, but walked away from the deal in July, according to The Real Deal.\n\nThe existing mansion at 901 Strada Vecchia Road is listed for $8 million but is being auctioned with no reserve. “The property is being offered as a receivership sale,” according to Premiere Estates, who is managing the sale. “The current structure will be demolished by the receiver, following close of escrow at no additional cost to the buyer.”\n\nLargest home in Westchester County is also the most expensive\n\nOn the other side of the country, the priciest property in New York State is a four-story manor in Hudson Valley, listed for $100 million.\n\nAt 740 acres, Stonewall Farm in Granite Springs is the largest private property in Westchester County, Patch reports. It’s renowned for its equestrian facilities, which include a turf racetrack, 40-stall yearling barn, two 24-stall broodmare barns, and a four-board fenced paddock.\n\nCurrent owner Barry K. Schwartz, co-founder of the Calvin Klein fashion empire, has bred dozens of stake-winning racehorses at Stonewall.\n\nSchwartz originally listed the estate in March 2020, then pulled it off the market in June. He re-listed it in March for its current asking price.\n\nThe main house at Stonewall Farm was designed in 2004 by New York architect Rebecca Rasmussen, with British designer Kelly Hoppen developing the 24,000-square-foot living space, including a two-story library with spiral staircase, a sunroom with arched glass ceiling, and a master suite with a Japanese indoor garden and limestone bathroom. There’s also a 2,200-bottle wine cellar, a game room, nine fireplaces, and an in-house pub.\n\nOutside is a butterfly house, a 60-foot heated swimming pool, and formal French and Japanese gardens designed by landscape architect Edmund D. Hollander.\n\nDavid B. Sanders of Christie’s International Real Estate of Westchester and Hudson Valley has the listing.\n\nAerie, owned by Yves Saint Laurent, Giancarlo Giammetti, and Tomas Maier, is for sale\n\nA storied co-op in New York’s Pierre Hotel is on the block for $7.995 million. The five-room residence takes up the entire front of the 38th floor on the tower’s Fifth Avenue side, offering direct views of Central Park and the Midtown skyline, out to the Hudson River and the George Washington Bridge.\n\nBut its pedigree is even more exquisite than the view: Over the past half-century, it’s been home to designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Bergé, Valentino co-founder Giancarlo Giammetti, and former Bottega Veneta creative director Tomas Maier.\n\nIn fact, the apartment is something of a testament to the intermingling of the professional and personal in the gay fashion world: Bergé originally bought the unit in the 1970s and, after meeting Jacques Grange, Jed Johnson, and Peter Marino at Studio 54 one night, Saint Laurent tapped the trio to decorate the two-bedroom aerie at what would be the dawn of three illustrious careers.\n\nAfter Saint Laurent’s death in 2008, Bergé sold the place for $7.5 million to Giammetti, who was involved with designer Valentino for 12 years and remained his business partner for decades after.\n\nMarino was brought back to redecorate—ripping out ’70s fringe and adding custom lighting and built-ins, dark oak floors in a Parquet de Versailles pattern, and hand-stenciled silver leaf finishes on the living room and dining room walls.\n\nFew details remain from Saint Laurent’s time, Brown Harris Stevens agent Martha Kramer, who has the listing, tells AD PRO—but the original dressing areas, which have drawers with hand-tooled leather lining, are still there.\n\nIn 2012, Giammetti sold the apartment for $8 million to Maier, who used it as a pied-à-terre with his husband and business partner, Andrew Preston.\n\nFor the most part, the German-born designer left the space intact, according to a The New York Times writeup from 2018, when Maier initially put it on the market for $10 million.\n\n“The apartment has a nice flow,” he told the paper at the time. “There is no dead-end space.”\n\nBut Maier is retired now, and he and Preston aren’t coming to New York as much as they once did, spending more time at their places in Maine and Florida. In 2014, they bought Ivana Trump’s Addison Mizner-designed mansion in Palm Beach for $16.6 million.\n\n“I do believe this home invites a creative person,” says Kramer, who is selling the two-bedroom apartment for the third time. “Or someone who wants to be the next in this historical line of creative personalities.”\n\nNew York’s skinniest house goes on the market\n\nThe nine-and-a-half-foot wide town house at 75 1/2 Bedford Avenue, considered by most to be the narrowest home in New York City, has been put on the market for $4,990,000.\n\nInside, the 1873 house has three bedrooms, two baths, four wood-burning fireplaces, and a utility closet for storage. It measures eight feet and seven inches at its widest, and just two feet at its narrowest. But owners can take comfort knowing they’re squeezing down the same hallways as famous former residents like Cary Grant, John Barrymore, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Margaret Mead.\n\nThe Millay House, as it’s known, isn’t getting any bigger, but its price tag sure is: George Gund IV purchased the home in 2013 for $3.25 million, according to Curbed, from a seller who picked it up for $2.175 million in 2010.\n\nCity Reality is handling the listing.\n\nMilestones\n\nThe Marx marks the spot on the Upper East Side\n\nThe Marx, a collection of six floor-through condominiums at 324 East 93rd Street in Manhattan is highlighting its sales launch by unveiling model units staged by Luxury Investment Designs’s Charles Ritschel and Angelica Grab, featuring artwork by Miami artist Austin Kerr.\n\nInfluenced by Scandinavian design, the interiors are bathed in neutrals—white oak flooring, porcelain stonework, stainless steel fixtures—and outfitted with appliances from Asko, Kohler, Viking, and Bosch.\n\nThe Marx “fits the fabric of the neighborhood while also standing out with its beautiful oversized custom windows and metal facade,” said in a statement Niv Amodai, head of operations for Nexus Development, which partnered with architectural firm Issac & Stern on the project.\n\nPricing for the two- and three-bedroom apartments ranges from $2.55 to $3.725 million.\n\nThe building’s unusual name comes from its location—about two blocks from the Marx Brothers’s childhood home at 179 East 93rd Street.\n\nSales launch at Vancouver’s “Jenga building”\n\nSales will launch September 7 at Fifteen Fifteen in Vancouver, German architect Ole Scheeren’s first residential building in North America.\n\nScheeren, 50, is best known for avant-garde designs in Asia, including Duo, a twin-tower mixed-use development in Bugis, Singapore, and Bangkok’s King Power Mahanakhon building, one of the tallest towers in Thailand.\n\nHis 42-story cantilevered condominium at 1515 Alberni Street in Vancouver’s Coal Harbour area has been nicknamed the “Jenga tower” for its protruding horizontal shapes.\n\n“In many dense urban contexts, from Asia to North America, vertical living typically means living in mute silos that isolate inhabitants from their surroundings and from each other,” Scheeren tells AD PRO.\n\n“Even in Vancouver, one of the most livable cities in the world, most buildings are not actively engaging their extraordinary setting. Fifteen Fifteen introduces horizontality in a whole new way.”\n\nThe property, which includes 202 apartments, a double-height residents’ lounge, and a private dining room, is also the first where Scheeren designed both the interior and exterior.\n\n“Every element of the living space is meticulously considered and crafted to maximize space and light, while maintaining privacy and individuality,” he says. “I also emphasized personalization, as I believe you have to leave enough space for residents to add their own personality to their home.”\n\nBosa Properties and Kingswood Properties are hoping to achieve LEED Platinum with Fifteen Fifteen and has installed renewable energy sources on its sculpted crown that will generate 100% of the energy for the public amenities on the ground floor.\n\nIn the News\n\nThe most expensive U.S. city to rent\n\nNew York City has grabbed the top spot as the most expensive city in America to rent an apartment, just squeaking past San Francisco.\n\nAt the end of August 2021, the median price for a one bedroom in New York was $2,810, according to apartment listing site Zumper. In San Francisco, it was $2,800—a difference too small to cover a Seamless order.\n\nRounding out the top five most expensive cities for rentals were Boston ($2,300), San Jose, California ($2,200), and Washington, D.C. ($2,160).\n\nThe Bay Area has outpaced the Big Apple for some time: Zumper’s 2019 report indicated the median rent on a one bedroom in San Francisco was more than $800 above New York.\n\nJoin Now\n\nBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month.\n\nArrow\n\nBut both cities were hit hard by COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns: By January 2021, 10 months into the pandemic, the median rent on a one bedroom in San Francisco had fallen nearly a quarter from March 2020. Though rents in New York City dropped only 18 percent, they still remained $330 cheaper than San Francisco.\n\nEventually, though, New York rebounded: “People returned to New York as indoor dining and other urban amenities that make the city popular became available again,” the report stated. “Rent began to rise as a result.”\n\nNYC rents have leapt some 20% since January and are now just 1.4% shy of where they were pre-pandemic.\n\nThat’s not the story in San Francisco: With the high percentage of tech workers who can continue to work remotely, rents have only crept up 5%.\n\nNew York’s place at the top is by no means stable. In spring 2021, rental applications in New York doubled over last year, according to CNBC. In San Francisco they shot up nearly 80%.\n\nIn general, rental prices are recovering nationwide, according to Zumper. The rent on a one-bedroom apartment is up 9% from May 2020. For a single-family home rental, they’re up 7.5%."
