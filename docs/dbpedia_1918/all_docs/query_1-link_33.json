        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris is unveiling his most legendary family photo.\n\nThe Series of Unfortunate Events actor posted a new pic in honor of Christmas, showing him and husband David Burtka with their 12-year-old twins Harper and Gideon.\n\nThe smiling family of four posed in festive pajamas in front of the Christmas tree at their New York home. Also front and center were their three dogs Ella, Gidget and Spike, who Neil held on his lap while sporting candy cane-print PJs, a white shirt and a Santa hat that read \"Papa.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the only way they celebrated the season. Ahead of Christmas, David and Neil took their kids on a magical trip to Disneyland alongside couple Mariska Hargitay and Peter Hermann and their kids August, 16, Amaya, 11, and Andrew, 11."
