        "text": "The many faces of Neil Patrick Harris\n\nStory highlights\n\nNeil Patrick Harris to do NBC variety show, report says\n\nProgram will be a U.S. version of UK's \"Saturday Night Takeaway\"\n\nHarris has long been recognized for his multifaceted talents\n\nCNN —\n\nLadies and gentlemen, it’s “The Neil Patrick Harris Show”!\n\nAn announcer might not use those exact words – plenty of details are still up for grabs – but, according to a report on New York magazine’s website, there will be a variety show hosted by the versatile star.\n\nThe show will be based on the UK variety show “Saturday Night Takeaway.”\n\nHarris has been plain about his desire to host a variety show. The onetime “Doogie Howser” and “How I Met Your Mother” actor, who’s impressed audiences with his turns on Broadway (in “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”) and on TV awards shows (he’ll be hosting the Oscars next year), told Howard Stern of his hopes earlier this year.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris to host Oscars\n\nCBS had tried to sell him on taking over for David Letterman, Harris told Stern, but Harris had no desire to do a talk show. Instead, he pitched a variety show to the network. CBS head Les Moonves was interested, Harris said at the time.\n\nNew York magazine said that a number of networks were bidding for Harris’ services, and NBC won. There was no timetable given for when the show might debut.\n\nHarris told New York that he’s looking forward to the challenge, since he’s a big fan of “Takeaway.” The UK show involves games, celebrity guests and pranks.\n\n“As I watched the show, I couldn’t stop smiling. Now that I’ve seen many seasons, my face hurts. It’s a game changer,” said Harris. “Nothing like this has been done before, and its unique structure fits right into my random skill set. I can’t wait to roll up my sleeves and have some fun!”"
