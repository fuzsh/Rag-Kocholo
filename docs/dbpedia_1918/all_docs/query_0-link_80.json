        "text": "R22, I wouldn't say \"walks all over him\" because, as we've established, Simon had some part in nearly every role Matt has gotten. This probably also gave and gives Matt some extra protection from anyone that would want to take advantage of him. Simon is the author of his career so he can't be upset when he has to go on location and shoot something. He helped set it up in the first place.\n\nIt's possible that he wants to carry his stuff. It's also possible that Simon didn't want to go out after the premiere and wanted to go home. He's not a young man. Wasn't another film one of Simon's clients was involved in also playing that week?\n\nAs for when he stayed in Scotland, based upon the footage he posted (especially when he spun around) he was exploring by himself and based upon their instagrams, they provided him and the rest of the production their rooms already. So why not take advantage of having a free hotel room until the end of the week? I agree, it would have been nice if he went home to the kids but it's not like he was spending his money and he obviously likes free things and discounts.\n\nYou didn't look at their instagrams during that time period did you?\n\nR25, I didn't say he was \"alone during those days in Scotland\" I said he was out alone exploring. He posted instagram stories from that period and there was no one else with him and clearly there was no one else with him in the one where he spun around in a circle and everyone was walking past him unless they all suddenly shifted with lightning speed. He did go exploring by himself. He wasn't with John the entire time!\n\n[quote]Papi Chulo is a small independent film-it doesn't have a big studio to cover costs.\n\nYou wouldn't even make an actor pay for their own lunch on a production no matter how small it is let alone have the important production people and cast members fly themselves from place to place! They would have money for that and for their accommodations especially since they were locking down and then had a distributor. They are necessary to promote the movie. They wouldn't take a chance on just one of them showing up. Alejandro is not just flinging money around flying from country to country multiple times for a movie! And why the hell would he EVER mention where he was staying? What lunatic would do that? They had hotel accommodations.\n\nA small independent film is not as small as you think it is.\n\n[quote] that was mentioned on a previous thread. They both are wearing the same bracelet during this interview. Probably a gift from one of them.\n\nThose bracelets are called bangles. They're in right now. They're also not the same bangle. John's is rounded and Matt's is flat. They don't match.\n\nJohn's been wearing his for a long time now. I doubt Matt's was a \"gift.\" If it was an actual gift he probably would have been seen wearing it more than once. ;)\n\nMatt hasn't worn anything like that before and hasn't since that we've seen. They're annoying because they are CONSTANTLY sliding off of your wrist if you have thinner wrists. They're not really made for someone as slender as him.\n\nHe also doesn't dress himself, Jeanne Yang coordinates everything. She did everything he wore during that trip from undershirt to shoes. The next time we saw him there he switched to a fancy looking watch.\n\nWhen he's spotted out and about he doesn't usually wear jewelry at all other than his ring if even that.\n\n[quote]He probably dyes his hair occasionally. His hair is quite dark and darker hair goes grey quite quickly.\n\nHis hair is grey on the sides and he likely has it died regularly.\n\nThe beard, he said in an interview, he thought was genetic. It has had grey spots since he was in his 20s. He doesn't bother to try and cover it.\n\nR100, BITB shouldn't take that long to film especially since the majority of it features all of the actors in the same location, in the same room, at the same time. They will zip through it. That's probably the only way they could get all of them to do it with their various schedules and how he'll still have time to go off and do The Sinner and Doom Patrol because he definitely couldn't be doing all three at once.\n\nThe Sinner is only 8 episodes and he's not the only lead so he won't be in every scene. Doom Patrol should come back with 15 episodes as before but if they show him next season as much as they have this season it's still a time commitment.\n\nThere's still no confirmation on whether he'll be back to Will & Grace or not.\n\nR106, Smart celebs don't just take what they make any put it in the bank: they invest in things. Way back when, according to People or Us or one of those magazines he paid over 3 million for his home from his trust so I'd wager they probably have more money than most people suspect. The more money they donate to charity, the more they can write off on their taxes to a point.\n\n[quote]I don't find Simon sexy at all. The man is old and average, can't believe Matt is into that. Ew.\n\nGood thing he'd never fuck you R251. He's too busy working with famous people and speaking at events because he actually bothered to make something of his life. He's being asked to give his views on the industry and you're at home writing about him.\n\n[quote]The age difference between Simon and Matt is so obvious because Simon is just aging normally while Matt spends a lot of time and money to stay looking as young as possible.\n\nMatt is handsome and works on his face and body but he is clearly aging too. It's not Simon's job to look like Matt. It is Matt's job to look a certain way.\n\nIt's upsetting (not at you R248) that there are some people who think he should leave his husband just because he doesn't want to get shit injected into his face, have it scraped every few weeks and have it pulled as tight as a drum. That's not why you marry someone. Some of their friends who have had surgery clearly look like they have surgery face. Even though Matt \"takes care\" of his face is isn't taking care of everything as evidenced by his close ups on Doom Patrol. You do too much you end up looking like Rupert Everett.\n\nR277, R278 According to the conventional wisdom of the internet, there’s one simple guideline for responding to trolls: don’t feed them. Ignore them, don’t react to them, don’t give them the attention they want. The premise of “don’t feed the trolls” implies that if you ignore a troll, they will inevitably get bored or say, “Oh, you didn’t nibble at my bait? Good play, sir!” and tip their cap and go on their way. Ask Zuckerberg or anyone on social media now, how that advice has worked out for them.\n\nThe ass hat who inhabits every Matt Bomer thread on DL and elsewhere has been on these threads for years.....years. The majority of threads are started by it. Probably this one was started by it. It slithers around other treads hoping for a mention of Bomer to make it's predictably lame comments. You can ignore it, shout at it, attack it ….. doesn't matter. It's not going anywhere. It really doesn't matter what the troll's motivation is at this point; whether it's to abuse, get attention, feel in control or make a joke. It's wallpaper. Sometimes now I get a good laugh from it, because what started out to be a mocking of Bomer and to make him the butt of its jokes, has resulted in the troll being the biggest joke of all.\n\nR340\n\n\"In his versatile career as an actor, Matt Bomer has portrayed a male stripper, a closeted journalist, a suave con artist and a brilliant film producer. What he hasn’t had a chance to play on screen—until now—is a role likely to come naturally to the 40-year-old actor: a father. In the adventure drama Walking Out, which debuted at SXSW and the Sundance Film Festival this spring and premieres Oct. 6 in theaters, Bomer embodies the estranged father of a 14-year-old son, who he takes hunting in the harsh Montana wilderness. While David, played by Josh Wiggins, would rather stay inside his father’s cabin and play video games, Bomer’s character has other ideas when it comes to male bonding. “I related to the character in a really profound way,” says Bomer. “I grew up in Texas, in a family where outdoorsmanship was a big part of our lives. The men in my family [and I] bonded [by] being in [nature] and having silence and a shared space together. I had an innate understanding of why it was so important for Cal to try to perpetuate those values.” While the film is focused on a dramatic event that changes the trajectory of their hunting expedition, it was the greater themes of the movie that struck a chord in Bomer. “Relationships and roles get redefined,” he says. “We start to get to the center of some questions about parenting that I deal with every day, which is, ‘What are we supposed to instill in our children?’” It’s a question Bomer grapples with as he and husband Simon Halls raise their three children, 9-year-old twins Henry and Walker and 12-year-old Kit, in Los Angeles. “What’s meaningful to us are manners, respect, a good work ethic,” he says, but, more importantly, “a belief in themselves, that they can follow their dreams, pursue whatever they want to pursue and to be their most authentic self. Whoever you are and whoever you want to be is accepted and surrounded with love.”\n\nBy Tim Nudd May 20, 2014 12:40 PM Matt Bomer is open to everything fatherhood brings – the joys, the difficulties and everything in between. “I love it,” the actor told PEOPLE Monday at the premiere of HBO’s The Normal Heart in Los Angeles. “It’s the most profound gift and the most daunting challenge at times.” Bomer, 36, has three sons with his publicist husband, Simon Halls. The eldest turns 9 this weekend, and they also have 6-year-old twins. Bomer recognizes the huge responsibility that comes with parenting, and says it’s a balancing act. “I just want to be hopefully somebody who helps shape these souls without changing how they came into the world,” he says. “To just give them the structure they need to thrive in the world but at the same time let their own personalities shine through. Some days that’s easier than others.” Known for his work on the USA drama White Collar and in films like Magic Mike, Bomer is winning early raves for his role as Felix Turner in The Normal Heart, based on Larry Kramer’s Tony-winning play about the AIDS crisis. He lost more than 35 lbs. for the movie. And he does want his children to see it – eventually. “They’re really young. So, not anytime soon,” he says. “It’s definitely a film I want them to see at a different point for a lot of reasons. This project is bigger than me. It’s something I want to show them to understand a piece of my history. And who they owe a lot of thanks to.” RELATED: Matt Bomer Opens Up About 2011 Wedding & Coming Out He adds: “I hope people see this movie and respond the way I did when I was a teenager, with a sense of gratitude for this generation who stood up when it wasn’t popular and it wasn’t easy to do so They are the reason I’m able to get married today, and probably the reason I can walk down the red carpet with my husband.” Saying he is “grateful for so much in my life right now,” Bomer is looking forward to spending the summer in New York with Halls and the kids while he films the next season of White Collar. “I need a summer with the family,” he says. “One of our twins has lost both of his front teeth. I was so happy yet so sad because it totally changes the way he looks! He’s so cute right now because he’s got this little empty space there. It’s really fun.”\n\n\"Matt Bomer says the secret to his successful and long relationship with husband Simon Hall is taking it \"one day at a time\". The 'Magic Mike XXL' star tied the knot with his long term partner Simon Halls back in 2011 and he has now revealed what keeps their relationship going strong. He told Entertainment Tonight: \"My grandparents were together from the time they were teenagers on, and I used to ask them and they'd tell me, 'One day at a time.' \"So, I guess I try to adapt that philosophy, but also just having perspective. You know, at the end of the day, the family and our home life is the most important thing and keeps everything else in perspective.\" Meanwhile, Matt previously revealed he \"takes cues\" from his grandparents when it comes to his marriage.\n\nHe said: \"I sort of take cues from my grandparents. My grandparents just celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary, so I always look to them and I see how every day they express their love for each other and I try to follow. They've set a pretty good model for me to follow.\" Matt tries to make as much time as he can to spend with Simon, with whom he shares Henry, Kit and Walker. He shared: \"Well, we have three kids right now, so you've got to fit the romance in when you can.\" Matt recently admitted he had to \"cover his tracks\" about his sexuality whilst at school. He said: \"When I was in high school, there was no safe haven, there was no outlet for you to speak your mind. So I did what any self-preserving 14-year-old would do - I signed up for the school play and also the football team to cover my tracks. When that happens, when you aren't allowed to speak about who you are, one of the most authentic parts of who you are, which is who you love or who you're attracted to, feels invisible. Having kids teaches you so many things, and one of the things we both have learned in our parenting journey is how loving and accepting and open children's minds and hearts are.\"\n\nR345 it's actually from his own interviews and actions that I guessed (although I'm aware I could be very wrong). He's hinted here and there in interviews that he's a method actor and during an interview for Papi Chulo he said acting is obsessive/all encompassing. He moved out of the family house to film Papi Chulo even though it was being shot in L.A. and he was already scheduled to away for months for the play only a month or so later. Obviously we know why he left the house for The Normal Heart but he said a few times in interviews that he didn't care about the risks to his health when he was losing all the weight which is an odd way to think when you have three young children. He even said that Simon would kick him out of the house if he were to do another weight loss role like TNH. Then when he was directing the Versace Crime Story he said in an interview that he wanted to be on set all the time and didn't want to leave.\n\nSo perhaps, emotional distant is unfair but I've gotten the vibe that he's able to shake off his parental responsibilities while he's working and only when he's finished a role that he's back to normal. Again, I could be completely off the money but just an assumption. Since we know so little, everything is just a guess.\n\nR346 I take your points, as people who don't know him we can only speculate and guess. It's quite possible that he is able to tightly compartmentalize his feelings, separating out completely work responsibilities from family responsibilities. For every given story or interview we can find something that supports a particular point of view, I would guess. There was an incident when one of the twins broke or injured his arm while Matt was filming White Collar. He immediately left the set and flew home; stopping production on a show that was incredibly meaningful and important to his career which was just taking off. His priorities seemed right to me, when I read that story and frankly endeared him to me.\n\nI love my work, trained a very long time and overcame numerous obstacles to have it. It requires my full attention to accomplish, because of the stakes involved. However, It's unfathomable to me that I could block out or shake off my responsibilities to my children for my work, even with a committed and loving spouse at home. So I guess I'm projecting my own parental sensibilities and sense of personal commitment onto Matt. As you said, knowing so little …..each of us is left to our own projections.\n\n[quote]Since we know so little, everything is just a guess.\n\nThis is very true. We don't know much of anything about his personal life.\n\nWe do know that no one has ever had anything negative to say about him professionally. Not his costars. Not his fans (except for that one but even then he still took a picture with her.) That's a stellar track record overall. He doesn't seem to have \"off days.\"\n\nThere aren't any random articles about horrible things he's done in public or said.\n\nHe had a bit of a smoking habit for a while (even beyond the Normal Heart.) There was actually a pic of him doing that during American Horror Story between scenes and Just Jared yanked the pic down a few days after it went up. He mentioned he did it when he was younger in an interview. He's smoked weed for years and the Pax account @ed him after he bought a vaporizer at one of their stores in Los Angeles.\n\nThere was also a pic of him with a couple of women models at a retreat a few years back on instagram who ran into him. The retreat was held by a new age guru that believed he could heal people with his eyes. He was at that weekend conference for that guy that believed he could survive cold temperatures last year. So he's into spiritual stuff.\n\nAs for his professional life we only know that his husband seems to be involved in all of his projects in some way and has been since his soap days but he never admits it. That probably provides him with extra protection from a lot of things.\n\nHollywood people are completely different than you or I. Shonda Rhimes has three children and she also likely spends little time at home. She even wrote an entire chapter in her book about how much she loves her nanny when other Hollywood parents don't publicly acknowledge them.\n\nFor all we know he could Facetime with the kids and his husband or Skype with them daily. He did say that he tells Simon goodnight every night no matter where he is and they could even have a ton of activities and are barely home themselves.\n\nBut I'm also of the party that believes that the less we know about a couple the better their relationship probably is. He really just seems like a normal person overall by Hollywood standards.\n\nR380, Yup, Anything's controversy was very unfortunate if only because, as he explained, he agreed to do it years before he actually did the project and it was released. I believe he said it was around the time Transparent had started. I think people here were wondering why didn't Simon warn him since this is his area of expertise. Well, it was because the film was before the social discussion over that issue hit the fever pitch it did by the time people found out about the film.\n\nWe'll see what happens with Papi Chulo because it only takes one influential person to make a stink out of something so that it gets broader attention. Anything's controversy wouldn't have been as bad had he not blocked Sense8 star Jamie Clayton on Twitter since that's when magazines started interviewing her.\n\nI do hope he's more careful because indie roles let him shine and I want to see him do more of that and more television. It was great seeing him on the stage but that limits what roles he can do outside of it because of the time commitment and unlike all but one of his costars (who seemed to bring his kids with him to NYC) he has a family and putting all of the child rearing on Simon was kind of harsh since Matt couldn't leave town. At least when he does film and tv he gets breaks and can go home.\n\n[quote]So am I correct that it was Pace that set them up? (Or was one of a few trying to set them up?)\n\nHe wasn't going to initially say the friend was Lee Pace. I guess he remembered Lee is out now and also gave up on being mysterious. So replace Lee with \"a mutual friend\" and \"us\" with Simon and Lee and the story makes sense.\n\nSo with that in mind: Lee told Matt that he thought Simon would be great for him and that Simon liked him.\n\nLee tried to set them up and Matt said no because he didn't know him and he didn't want to date industry people.\n\nThen years later he brought him up to Lee to see if they (Lee & Simon) were still interested in setting up a date.\n\nThen then \"we\" (Simon and Matt) met at a BBQ at a mutual friend's (Lee Pace's) house and so their first date/meeting was a BBQ with the three of them (Simon, Matt & Lee.)\n\nAnd of course we have this photo from a different time at Lee Pace's house with Simon and Matt who he set up as a couple.\n\n[quote]I vaguely took him for boring and bland.\n\nR474, That was definitely NOT his usual kind of interview. That's why there are quite a few comments on it. He's usually very repetitive and doesn't reveal anything. One of his co-stars, that he has been friends with for 20 years said in interview to the magazine he interviewed him for that he barely knows anything about the guy because Matt keeps to himself.\n\nThere have been various people that have allegedly dealt with him in social settings on here at parties, dinners or the gym that have run into him. Same deal. He's nice but he doesn't talk about his personal life. If you believe the legendary AHS gossip thread it was the same. Came to work, very nice, went home to his family as soon as he was done working. All of the stories over the past decade have been consistent.\n\nHe has loosened up significantly over the past couple of years or rather since he turned 40. He's showing more of his actual personality and is less robotic in interviews. He's also started to do more gay projects.\n\n[quote]So I assumed that he comes from privilege and that he was pampered since day one, lol.\n\nHe's worked as a janitor, pipeline builder/cleaner, bellhop and waiter. He has never really behaved as someone who looks like he does would usually behave. Probably it's related to his struggles with his sexuality + his religious upbringing. He has described his parents as \"simple\" people. His outsides and his insides don't seem congruent.\n\n[quote]I also got the impression that strangely DL doesn't hate his much older husband, nor his heteronormative, monogamous marriage. Am I wrong?\n\nThese days DL is indifferent to or likes his husband. (There's one poster who absolutely hates him.) Over the past few years these threads have shifted from gay men (when he was closeted and when he first came out) to women. They've stuck with him. It's probably because his first audience was primarily women and generally he is boring for an openly gay man. He's also older and people like youth.\n\nHe got married early and now we know he tried to get married even earlier than he actually did.\n\nHe works primarily on projects his husband has something to do with (or rather his clients are associated with like Ryan Murphy and Greg Berlanti), probably for protection. He doesn't really stray outside of that sphere.\n\nThere's a story from one of the Hollywood Gossip threads where a guy claimed that Steven Soderbergh, who directed the first Magic Mike, was gay or bisexual. He was obsessed with / stalkery towards Matt, and the guy said he remembered it was Matt because it was unusual for him to go after someone who wasn't young so that's why the story was interesting and it was brought up to him. Matt ignored it until he crossed a line.\n\nApparently one day he went into Matt's trailer, tried something with him and Matt lost his shit on him. People were called in from the studio and probably his husband too and he wouldn't continue to work on the movie until something was done about Steven to keep them apart. He's \"not that kind of girl.\"\n\nWorking with people his husband deals with and his husband's friends has always protected him.\n\n>> I agree, it’s basically been the case that Matt seems to go out of his way to never say anything negative about others.\n\nR485 you just reminded me of something! Alex Pettyfer was originally \"allegedly\" a huge problem on the set of Magic Mike so he wasn't asked back for the second. A few months later we heard \"allegedly\" he and Channing Tatum had a huge problem with one another and Channing hated him. He even \"allegedly\" got so angry at finding out his cast mates made more than him and had a massive outburst.\n\nMatt was asked about it by a caller on Andy's show. He said this:\n\n[quote]So, did he recall any awkward moments? \"Truth be told, no,\" said Bomer, who played an exotic dancer named Ken. \"On set in the first film, everybody was really professional. Channing is one of the most fun people I've ever worked with; he set a great tone. They both came to work on time, did great work, and there was never any undercurrent of tension that I witnessed.\" But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. \"I was a little nervous about what I was wearing at the time,\" the actor said of his skimpy wardrobe, \"so maybe I wasn't noticing these undercurrents.\"\n\nBut he probably didn't know that Alex Pettyfer himself said that he was a problem on Brett Easton Ellis' show. The article is linked but he said:\n\n[quote]Pettyfer reveals that he didn't, as was reported, burn his house down, or have an outburst on set when he found out he wasn't being paid as much as his co-stars. (He walked a mile away and screamed but says it was apparently so loud that people on set heard.)\n\n[quote]\"I did my work and then I sat in the corner and listened to music because I'd been told that anything I do was wrong by my reps and I was very insecure as a human being. That also gave me a bad rep because they said, 'Oh Alex thinks he's f—ing better than everybody else because he doesn't speak to anyone.' And that's not true. I was genuinely nervous and scared to be myself.\"\n\nIn a different interview he pointed out that when they had reshoots Channing already told everyone that he didn't like him.\n\nSo I think it's less likely that Matt didn't know all of that and more likely that he was taking the high road and not saying anything.\n\nAlso in one of the on set gossip threads, a guy said he worked on Magic Mike and that while Alex kept to himself, Matt Bomer was one of the only cast mates that would always interact with him and that Alex would talk to. So if that's to be believed once again more proof that Matt is a nice guy.\n\n[quote]One thing I don't get is how come the fact that he got married was not known until three years later. Wasn't he wearing the ring? Simon and the kids were publicly known as his family, but not the fact that they are married !?\n\nIt was a small wedding. He did wear the ring (although they don't always wear their rings). No reporter that got an interview with him would have been dumb enough to ask him or comment on it unless he did first. Publicists as R499 said would have blocked that and for those that did ask he always found a way to avoid mentioning specifics.\n\nThere's an interesting interview from even before that in 2009 on the Today show with Kathie and Hoda where Kathie tried to get him to say who he was spending his holiday with and he said, \"my family\" and then she kept going and she said, something like \"you mean your family in Texas, your mother?\" and he said again, \"My family\" and made a face and Kathie teased, \"You know that's not what we meant\" and Hoda thankfully changed the subject. It was clear she knew he had a then boyfriend and three children and didn't want to talk about it. There's a pic of him at a bar with people watching the White Collar premiere and Simon is behind him, it's interesting to go back and see it because back then the public didn't know.\n\n[quote]Sound like disappointed SJW misguided by their own expectations of forced equality.\n\nThey're not. They're actually pointing out something extremely problematic with these kinds of stories that has been addressed to death and beyond by various ethnic groups even before the term SJW (which has only existed since 2011) existed.\n\nThe Wrap review, however, actually tried to give pointers on how they could have addressed the issue which was to have given Ernesto his own story. They liked their performances and they liked the fact that they gave Ernesto a family. The wrap also talked about things they liked about the movie like the cinematography.\n\nBoth pointed out that the film tried to address the issue of the \"Magical Negro\" trope by bringing it up in film but both thought they didn't do a good enough job and I'm sure John knew that this could be an issue. However, people overseas from other countries don't have the same history that this one does with race.\n\nI know we love (well most of us) Matt here but at least the writers liked the performances.\n\nSo none of this is on Matt's head (although he'll be associated with it) again in this case it's the producer/writer/director that probably should have spoken to more people of color before trying to produce the film.\n\n[quote] I don't think that this European director/writer wanted to address \"Magic Negro\" issue like the US reviewers think .... I don't expect it to promote social justice by making two characters equal partners in the relationship.\n\nR547 You're not getting my point or their point.\n\nYou [italic]can't[/italic] do that in a film to be distributed in America [bold]without[/bold] addressing that issue in 2019 or else you're going to get these kinds of articles.\n\nIf this was only going to show up in Ireland or Europe as a whole and then eventually it appeared on Netflix, that's one thing.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the intent. (And from the references in the movie it's clear he knew this was an issue and tried to circumvent that.)\n\nThey wanted it to be seen here in theaters by as many people as possible so the price they pay is having it reviewed [italic]as any other film released in America would be reviewed.[/italic] That's just how it is.\n\nAnd because they want that film viewed by as many people as possible, they're going to get reviews from writers who take the perspective of the American who might want to see a movie at the theater and at this point in history many Americans have been conditioned to have an issue with this.\n\nGreen Book made it all the way to the Oscars and at no point did people stop calling it out for the trope. The same thing happened with The Legend of Bagger Vance almost 18 years ago! This concept is absolutely not new.\n\nAlso there might be some bad news coming soon. They're still due to shoot in November but nothing has been officially announced yet so anything is possible until then.\n\nFrom the article at R561\n\n[quote]“It’s about the unthinking casual racism and objectification of the ordinary Joe, even and especially in LA, the idea that people will see two people and they will map a set of projections onto them. I knew there was going to be a lot of criticism of this film in terms of its racial and sexual politics, I knew that absolutely.” But does he see any merit to the critique? “The initial engagement, as long as that checks out for me in terms or rationale and ethics, whatever happens afterwards is as a result of their relationship development.”\n\nSo he's acknowledging that there are racial issues (discussed everywhere) and sexual issues (since Matt's character only seems to like Latin men) and he knew people were going to call him out on those.\n\nThen he implies that if people can rationalize their critique based on what they see initially he's okay with it but then anything they come up with after that is a result of what happens in the movie?\n\nI don't know.\n\nR575 he had this to say\n\n[quote][bold]Last year, your role as a trans woman in Anything sparked controversy and had exec producer Mark Ruffalo apologizing for casting a cis man in the role rather than a trans woman. How did the conversations around that role affect you?[/bold]\n\n[quote]I think it was a huge awakening for me. You know, I became involved with that movie in 2014, before the show Transparent had even come out, and the years between when we finished it and when it did come out, there was just a sea change of incredible progress for the better. The sad reality was that in 2014, a tiny indie like Anything wasn’t going to get financed any other way. But I certainly apologize to anyone who it hurt or offended. I have many times in the past. I don’t know if anyone’s ever printed it because it’s not quite as interesting as controversy, but it was never my intention. I have been on the end of not being given opportunities because of who I am, and I would never wish that on anyone else.\n\nand on Papi Chulo -- not a great answer.\n\n[quote][bold]Some critics have noted what they see as a problematic dynamic between a privileged white man and a migrant-worker savior character who helps him with his problems. Have you heard this critique? Is it fair?[/bold]\n\n[quote]This movie actually premiered at the same film festival as Green Book, so umm… (Laughs) Like I said, it was written before Trump was even in office, but for me, Sean’s entry into their friendship comes from a place of feeling guilt about being a white middle-class male. If all you take from the fact that these two people become real, true friends is that it’s problematic because they’re a different race or from different classes, then I think that’s an incredibly cynical point of view. It certainly was not the intention.\n\nHopefully no one picks up on it.\n\nR583, He's implied that he doesn't get many scripts multiple times these past couple of years but he's getting older and of course he's gay.\n\nThat's also the problem with doing a play, as some of his fans want him to do. Many projects shoot during the summer and if he's stuck on a stage daily, twice a day, for months on end that blocks him from other opportunities then too. Less people will see you and you don't make as much money in the long term vs doing a film or tv project. It's not like it will ever \"re-air.\" He can't leave town or have them adjust the schedule (as he did with Doom Patrol so he could do Will & Grace) and he wasn't even the lead by himself. He clearly wants to be seen and get paid. He's lucky Ryan Murphy has the power to get it made into a Netflix project but that won't happen every time.\n\nAnd yes the \"immigrant friends\" comment was tone deaf and it appears no one coached him on how to answer these questions."
