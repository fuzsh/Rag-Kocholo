        "text": "I am a 76-year-old Vietnam War veteran with PTSD. After growing up in southern California, I've lived in North Canton for 48 years.\n\nAt 18 years old, I raised my right hand and was sworn in to serve \"our\" wonderful country. I have friends who did not come home. I have friends who are broken with the system. We didn't know where we were going, but we were willing to die to defend this country.\n\nThis country is so divided it makes me sick. All the other countries love it that we're so divided. They laugh at us Americans.\n\nWhen 911 happened, what other countries offered to help us? Nobody! We are now $34 trillion in debt. We've sent over $100 billion to other countries. We're doing a $42 billion internet system this year. What's going on here, people?\n\nI've got a great idea. Let's keep these billions of dollars in America. Our borders north and south are a mess. We have homeless Americans living on the streets. Instead of shipping billions of dollars out of this country, let's give each state $1 billion to build homeless shelters. We send twice that total amount to other countries.\n\nShootings at schools, parades, malls. It all starts at home. As proud parents, we should be monitoring our kids.\n\nWhat about this lottery? I thought the proceeds go to schools and roads. Why have we never seen where the proceeds go? Sports betting in Ohio gleaned almost $1 billion. Where's that money going? Somebody's pocket?\n\nTaxes are going up, recession. Let's keep these billions of dollars in America. We live in the greatest country in the world. Let's take care of our country first.\n\nThomas A. Rollo, Lake Township"
