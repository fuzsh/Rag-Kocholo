We caught up with the chef/actor/author at the Food Bank for New York City's 35th anniversary at the annual Can Do Awards Dinner at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City a few weeks ago.\n\nWhen he isn't stepping out for a good cause, you can find him whipping up exotic cuisine for famous spouse Neil Patrick Harris and 7-year old twins, Gideon Scott and Harper Grace who are by no means picky eaters, but with a Dad that cooks like he does, it's no wonder. His go-to meal for the kids? \"Poke night.\""
