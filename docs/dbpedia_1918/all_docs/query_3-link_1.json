        "text": "I don’t see it happening either. They are invested in presenting this “perfect” family on social media and use the kids for ads and make $$$. Why give that up?\n\nIf you watch any of their Instagram lives (which are difficult to get through), DB seems warm and sweet to the kids and NPH seems very demanding and extremely intense. Quite a familiar dynamic… I feel like many of us grew up in households like that. So what else is new.\n\nDeux moi will post stuff from fools who are fixated on putting out a false narrative about certain celebrities. She’s done it repeatedly. People went wild when she posted something from a psycho Schitt’s Creek fan who said David and Patrick completely hate each other in real life and aren’t on speaking terms. That turned out to be bullshit too.\n\nThis is odd but I always thought NPH was a true bisexual. I don't know why but he gives that vibe that he doesn't give a shit about gays either and resents in a way being pigeonholed. He came out to probably do damage control and bisexuals aren't accepted or taken seriously and FRAUs especially are icked out by it. It reminds me of how George Michael candidly said he was more bisexual but identified as gay because he partnered with men. People on DL bash on bisexuals yet act weird when famous men admit to it. I don't think a gay man even if a great actor could have played a depraved heterosexual womanizer as convincing in Harold and Kumar and How I Met Your Mother. I think he's a narcissist and his relationship with Dave and those kids always seem like a PR boost for him to show off. NPH as sweet and wholesome is laughable. He's just a spoiled child star brat grown up.\n\nA NPH story for you...\n\nBack in August, 2001 I owned an upscale retail store in RI. The summer months were usually slow, the city was dead (no college kids and my regulars were away for the summer) , and I waited for the college kids to return to the city. One Saturday, a young woman and youn man came into the store and we started chatting while the girl was picking out some items to buy for herself. I found out the girl was moving to the city to get her PhD in Art History at one of the colleges (she was relocating from NYC), and the guy was with her to help her move into her new apartment that weekend. Both of them were very nice, very polite, very talkative. After about 90 minutes in the store, the girl asked me if I knew who the guy was standing next to me. He looked familiar, but I confessed I didn't know who he was. He then introduced himself - 'Neil Patrick Harris'. I can't believe I didn't recognize him, but it was a while since I watched 'Doogie Howser'. He was so polite and unpretentious that day - very handsome and charming. A grea conversationalist while his friend got what she neeed to buy.\n\nWhen they were ready to leave, he told me he was opening in a new Broadway play in September called \"Assassins\" and gave me his phone number (at the time) to call him if I was in NYC, and he would have tickets waiting at the box office for me and then I could meet him backstage (I believe I told him I went to NYC regularly). I was thrilled ! Then 9-11 happened a few weeks after I met him, and the rest is history.\n\nI think of that afternoon when he was in my store when I read all the unflattering stories about him now. If they're true, it's a shame what fame and fortune can do to someone.\n\nHe hit on me in the early 2000s in the VIP room at the Roxbury. The tables were available but if I VIP came in they usually booted you. The host came to boot us and He came and said \"no they can stay, plenty of room,\" he was solo as far as I could tell. He was barely 21, if that. He awkwardly hit on me, then my friend. We joked between us we should spit roast him for the story but he soon found someone who he liked more I guess and left our table."
