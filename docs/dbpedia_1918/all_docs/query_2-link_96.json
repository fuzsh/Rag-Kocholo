As if that's not enough, they then roast it in the oven with rosemary and fresh garlic. Wow!\n\n\"The smoked watermelon 'ham' ends up being not really a watermelon and definitely not really a ham,\" Will says. \"It's kind of its own strange world.\"\n\n\"[People] have either been really excited or insanely grossed out,\" he continues.\n\nSo, in which of those groups do Neil, David and Rach fall?\n\n\"It smells amazing,\" Rach says before taking a bite. \"It smells like a ham.\"\n\n\"It does not smell like watermelon,\" David chimes in. \"It does not look like watermelon.\"\n\nWatch the video above for their verdict! (Spoiler alert: They all agree that it's \"wild.\")\n\nNeil, David and Rach ALSO tried another trendy food — donut grilled cheese from Clinton Hall in NYC.\n\nSee what they thought of *that* in the video below:\n\nRach Tries DONUT Grilled Cheese With Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka\n\nThis video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRach Tries DONUT Grilled Cheese With Neil Patrick Harris and Dav…\n\nQ&A with Organizational Pro Peter Walsh + Dermatologist Shares A…\n\nActor Hank Azaria + Freezer Meals + Artichokes 2 Ways with Rach\n\nSee Inside Barbara Corcoran's Stunning NY Apartment + It's Steak…\n\nHow to Make Chicken and Lobster Piccata | Richard Blais\n\nDonnie Wahlberg Spills Details About NKOTB's First Ever Conventi…\n\nDonnie Wahlberg + Jenny McCarthy Say Rach Is Such a \"Joy\" + Look…\n\nThe Best Moments From 17 Seasons of the Show Will Make You Laugh…\n\nHow to Make Crabby Carbonara | Rachael Ray\n\nRach Chats \"Firsts\" In Flashback From Our First Episode Ever In …\n\nHow to Make Apple-Cider Braised Pork Chop Sandwiches with Onion …\n\nRach's Chef Pals Say Goodbye to Show in Surprise Video Message\n\nHow to Make Sesame Cookies | Buddy Valastro\n\nHow to Make Tortilla with Potatoes, Piquillo Peppers and Mancheg…\n\nHow to Make Shrimp Burgers | Jacques Pepin\n\nHow to Make Spanakopipasta | Rachael Ray\n\nAndrew McCarthy Chokes Up Discussing Emotional Trip to Spain wit…\n\nCelebrity Guests Send Farewell Messages After 17 Seasons of the …\n\nCelebrity Guests Send Farewell Messages After 17 Seasons of the …\n\nAndrew McCarthy Teases Upcoming \"Brat Pack\" Reunion Special\n\nMichelle Obama Toasts Rach's 17 Years on the Air With a Heartfel…\n\nWith their Savor card, something tells us these aren't the last trendy foods Neil and David are going to try — especially since the couple lives with their family in NYC!\n\n\"Being in the city, you can try the whole world here!\" says Rach.\n\nHear, hear!\n\nOf course, you don't have to live in the Big Apple to appreciate the benefits of the Savor card — every town around the world has its own amazing forms of entertainment.\n\nBut since our show does film in NYC, Capital One helped us give our studio audience members an extra-special way to enjoy NYC while they're here — with tickets to Burger Bash at the New York City Wine and Food Festival, presented by Capital One.\n\n(Thanks for making that possible, you guys!)\n\nFYI: David and Neil will both be judging at the event. Plus, David will be doing his own cooking demo!"
