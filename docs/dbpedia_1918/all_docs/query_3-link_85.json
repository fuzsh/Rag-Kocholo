        "text": "Neil Patrick Harris is best known today for playing the womanizing Barney Stinson on “How I Met Your Mother.” However, long before that, Harris was a prominent child star in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He first broke out with his starring role on the medical drama “Doogie Howser, M.D.” at just 16 years old.\n\nHow did Neil Patrick Harris get his start as an actor?\n\nHarris was born on June 15, 1973 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His parents were lawyers and they moved the family to Ruidoso, New Mexico shortly after he was born. Harris took an interest in acting from an early age. His parents were supportive of his talents and would drive him into Los Angeles so he could audition for film and TV roles.\n\nHe got his first big break in 1988 at age 15 when he was cast in the lead role of a teenage doctor on a new Steven Bochco TV series called “Doogie Howser, M.D.” This was a hugely high-profile role at the time, and it catapulted the young Harris into fame.\n\nWhat was Neil Patrick Harris’ big breakout role as a child star?\n\nWithout question, Harris’ breakout role was playing Dr. Doogie Howser on “Doogie Howser, M.D.” The show premiered in 1989 when Harris was just 16 years old.\n\n<b>Fun Facts About “Doogie Howser, M.D.”</b>\n\nHarris was the youngest actor ever at the time to star in his own TV series\n\nThe concept for a teenage doctor was inspired by real-life doctor Balamurali Ambati, who became a doctor at age 17\n\nHarris was nominated for a Golden Globe for the role in 1990\n\nOver the 4 seasons of the show, Harris became very well-known and beloved for playing the child prodigy doctor Dougie Howser. He perfectly captured the innocence and intelligence of a boy genius adjusting to life as a practicing physician. This role clearly established Harris as a star on the rise in Hollywood.\n\nWhat other child actor roles was Neil Patrick Harris known for?\n\nIn addition to his star-making turn on “Doogie Howser,” Harris appeared in a number of other popular films and TV shows as a child actor in the late 80s/early 90s, including:\n\nFilm Roles\n\nPurple People Eater (1988) – Harris’ film debut\n\nClara’s Heart (1988) – Supporting role drama with Whoopi Goldberg\n\nB.L. Stryker (1989) – TV movie\n\nTelevision Roles\n\nCold Sassy Tree (1989) – Starring mini-series\n\nHome Fires Burning (1989) – Lead role TV drama\n\nQuantum Leap (1990) – Guest spot, 1 episode\n\nSo even beyond “Doogie,” Harris stayed very active with a mix of film and TV roles that further showcased his talents and his ability to take on diverse roles. He worked consistently and was able to balance his education while acting.\n\nWhy did Neil Patrick Harris ultimately leave his child star roles behind?\n\nAfter “Doogie Howser, M.D.” ended in 1993 when he was 19 years old, Harris stepped back from high-profile acting roles for a few years to attend university. He has said he wanted to have a somewhat normal college experience out of the spotlight.\n\nHarris attended Columbia University briefly before transferring and graduating from New Mexico State University in 1994. By attending college away from Los Angeles/Hollywood, this gave Harris a chance to transition away from his teenage actor years into early adulthood with more privacy.\n\nWhen he returned to professional acting a few years later in his early 20s, Harris was able to reinvent himself in more mature adult roles on stage and screen. Ultimately, this enabled him to sustain an incredibly long career in the entertainment industry into his late 40s today.\n\nDid Neil Patrick Harris appear in any acting, TV or film projects in his late teens/early 20s?\n\nYes, although his projects were limited during his college years, Harris did still take on select acting work in the 1995-99 timeframe including:\n\nLegacy of Sin: The William Coit Story (1995) – TV movie\n\nRent Control (1995-96) – Supporting part TV sitcom\n\nSon of the Beach (2001-02) – TV comedy\n\nThe Messengers (2003) – Film\n\nStark Raving Mad (1999-2000) – TV sitcom\n\nSo in his late teens and twenties, Harris began reestablishing himself as an actor, though balancing his education and the beginnings of an adult acting career before his breakthrough return to prominence.\n\nWhat were Neil Patrick Harris’ other major film and TV roles as an adult actor?\n\nAs Harris restarted his acting career following college, some of his other very prominent adult roles beyond child acting have included:\n\nFilm\n\nHarold & Kumar films (2004, 2008, 2011)\n\nBeastly (2011)\n\nGone Girl (2014)\n\nA Million Ways to Die in the West (2014)\n\nDownsizing (2017)\n\nTelevision\n\nHow I Met Your Mother (2005-2014)\n\nA Series of Unfortunate Events (2017-2019)\n\nDoctor Who (2007)\n\nGlee (2010-2014)\n\nA Million Little Things (2018)\n\nOf course, his run as the mocking and manipulative Barney Stinson in CBS’s hit “How I Met Your Mother” is perhaps his most famous role as an adult actor. This further showcased his talent for comedy.\n\nHarris has also recently segued into more behind-the-scenes creative roles in entertainment as a producer, author, and host. So in his 40s today, while still acting, he has expanded his Hollywood career well beyond just acting.\n\nWhat professional awards or nominations has Neil Patrick Harris received for acting?\n\nThanks mainly to the incredible legacy left behind from his performance as Doogie Howser as well as Barney Stinson, Neil Patrick Harris has received significant industry accolades over his career including:\n\n5 total Emmy award nominations\n\nWon for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy (How I Met Your Mother)\n\n5 total Golden Globe nominations\n\nWon for Best Supporting Actor in Series/TV Movie (How I Met Your Mother)\n\nReceived a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011\n\nThese awards cement his place as an elite TV comedy actor and also serve as reminders of his legendary breakthrough over 25 years earlier as a teenage star playing Doogie Howser.\n\nHow much did Neil Patrick Harris make as a child actor? What was his peak salary?\n\nThere are no definitive reports publicly to confirm how much Harris made specifically as a child actor. However, by the time “Doogie Howser” ended in 1993 when he was nearly 20 years old, some entertainment sites estimate he had earned between $5 to $7 million total.\n\nThe show was very successful especially in its first couple seasons, so Harris certainly was well compensated. Adjusted for inflation to 2023 dollars, $5 to $7 million equates to around $11 to $14 million in total earnings just from ages 15 to 19.\n\nIn terms of peak annual salary, it was likely in the range of $700,000 to $1 million per year at his highest point on “Doogie Howser.” This allowed his family to have an upper-middle class lifestyle in Los Angeles area during those years. While extremely high earnings for teenager, it could have been higher still at peak of show’s popularity so he avoided pitfalls that impact some child stars earning tens of millions annually.\n\nWhat was Neil Patrick Harris’ net worth at his peak?\n\nAccording to multiple reputable entertainment news sources, Neil Patrick Harris’ current net worth as of 2023 is estimated to be around $50 million. While very successful currently, this does not however represent the peak of his net worth over his career.\n\nBased on his earnings from “How I Met Your Mother” as well as other successful films and TV projects in the late 2000s/early 2010s, Neil Patrick Harris’ net worth likely peaked in the range of $60 to $70 million.\n\nThis probably was achieved around 2012-2015 at the height of his return to major stardom with “How I Met Your Mother” ongoing, his hosting very successful Tony Awards shows in this period, as well as feature film projects and endorsement deals.\n\nSo while still extremely financially successful now, Harris appears to be a couple steps back from his peak net worth years when he was likely worth up to $70 million. Of course, at just 49 years old currently, he still has plenty of lucrative years still ahead to continue rebuilding his net worth.\n\nWhat is Neil Patrick Harris doing now career-wise in 2023?\n\nNow 49 years old, Neil Patrick Harris remains very active in the entertainment industry with a busy mix of acting roles, behind-the-scenes work, and business ventures. A few major current projects Harris is involved with in 2023 include:\n\nRecently named new host of NBC’s hit reality competition “America’s Got Talent”\n\nServes as an Executive Producer for CBS sitcom “Uncoupled” after appearing as guest star\n\nPublic spokesperson in ads for Smartwater premium bottled water brand\n\nContinues work and guest roles in TV and films; most recently appearing in “The Matrix Resurrections”\n\nSo at nearly 50 years old today, over 30 years after his career began as a child star on “Doogie Howser,” it is incredible that Neil Patrick Harris still remains extremely relevant in Hollywood.\n\nWhile perhaps not at the absolute peak star power of his “How I Met Your Mother” days 10 years ago, Harris figures to continue having prominent acting and behind-the-scenes roles in TV/film for at least the next decade or more based on his current trajectory.\n\nHis long career arc is truly unique starting as a child star all the way into solid middle age. Harris has successfully navigated the tricky transitions from early fame, dropping out of spotlight during young adulthood, and eventually reigniting his star power as an adult.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn an industry where many child actors fail to sustain careers beyond their adolescence, Neil Patrick Harris stands out as an exception. Getting his big break playing “Doogie Howser” as a 16-year old in 1989, his early career and fame could have just been a short teenage phenomenon.\n\nHowever, Harris actively worked to reinvent himself. By temporarily stepping back from acting after “Doogie” ended to focus on college, this enabled him to transition into adulthood outside the nonstop spotlight.\n\nUpon returning to Hollywood a few years later in his 20s, Harris built up new roles across film, TV and theater. This served as a bridge toward re-establishing himself as a star with his career-defining portrayal of Barney Stinson on CBS’s hit sitcom “How I Met Your Mother” in the 2000s/early 2010s.\n\nNow approaching his 50s, Harris remains an in-demand celebrity in Hollywood and pop culture. While no longer at the absolute prime of his fame, he continues working actively with acting, producing, business ventures, and more.\n\nVery few child stars navigate the tricky transitions needed to achieve such sustained fame across more than 30 years. By avoiding major scandals involving drugs, arrests, or erratic behavior, Harris’ steadfast work ethic and continued pursuit of high profile projects explains his long-standing success.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris’ unique career arc seems likely to continue playing out for some time still. Both his loyal longtime fans from the “Doogie Howser” days as well as new generations getting to know him today via viral clips of Barney Stinson ensure Harris’ lasting spot in Hollywood for years ahead.\n\nFAQs about Neil Patrick Harris as a Child Star\n\nDid Neil Patrick Harris go to high school?\n\nNo, due to his filming schedule for “Doogie Howser” in his mid-teens, Harris completed his high school education through on-set tutors.
