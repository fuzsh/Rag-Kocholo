        "text": "Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves\n\nContrary to what some commercials may have led you to believe, Matthew McConaughey is not actually in a relationship with his car. In fact, he’s already taken by his beautiful wife, model Camila Alves. After the two met in the last days of the previous Millenium, they immediately hit it off and started dating.\n\nIn 2011, McConaughey proposed to Alves on Christmas Day, and she said yes to the actor, who is 14 years her senior. But does age really matter when the people in question both look ridiculously good? The gap in age doesn’t seem to bother the stars, who are still happily married today.\n\nBruce Willis and Emma Heming\n\nBruce Willis is not one to be dating someone new every other weekend. He only does the long run and he has the proper credentials. You may remember that Bruce Willis's most infamous romantic relationship was his 12-year marriage to actress Demi Moore. The two stars had three daughters together (including actress Rumer Willis) before ending things in 2000.\n\nNine years later, Willis said, “I do,” to his new wife, model Emma Heming. Willis is 22 years older than his current wife, but that shouldn’t come as a shocker since his former wife was 15 years younger than him, too.\n\nRod Stewart and Penny Lancaster\n\nRock legend Rod Stewart is one of the biggest names in the business, selling more than 100 million records over the course of his career. In 1999, he met who was soon going to be his third wife, television personality Penny Lancaster. Fans were heartbroken, but Penny and Rod had found something truly special – even with the enormous age gap between them.\n\nThe age difference between the two is a substantial 27 years, and, as disappointed as some of his female fans may be, the couple is still happily married.\n\nJamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl\n\nListen, the whole “guys should be taller” standard is outdated. Height has nothing to do with love. Like age, it’s just a number. No couple proves this point more than the adorable Jamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl. These two are pretty well-known in their individual careers. Cullum is a singer and songwriter, while Dahl is a model and author.\n\nDahl towers over Cullum by almost half a foot. Dahl once commented about their height difference, stating, “I think if we were both slightly more neurotic people, it would be crippling, but the fact of the matter is that we’re both happy. It’s cool.”\n\nEllen Pompeo and Chris Ivery\n\nIf you've seen \"Grey's Anatomy,\" then you can't forget Ellen Pompeo's character. She's been on the down low with her relationship with her husband, Chris Ivery, whom she met just before the new millennium kicked in. The pair value their privacy, and choosing how and when they appear in the public eye.\n\nThe two met at an unlikely place — a grocery store in LA! Ellen has been outspoken about how hard it can be to be in a mixed-race relationship and have mixed-race children and has faced backlash for it. It's great to see that she and Chris didn't let it get in the way of their relationship.\n\nSalma Hayek Pinault and Francois Henri Pinault\n\nFrançois-Henri Pinault is a French billionaire who was lucky enough to marry Salma Hayek. Salma received a lot of backlash from haters since they didn't think they were a good match, but she did not let the haters get in the way of true love.\n\nThey met in the late 1990s and began dating not long after. The pair opted for two weddings: one was rather intimate with friends and family, while the other one was a lavish and star-studded night in Italy. They have spent decades acting as each other's rocks, supporting each other throughout both of their hectic careers.\n\nKevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick\n\nThe actors have been married for more than two decades and have two children together. When Kyra Sedgwick appeared on \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" she discovered a freaky fact about herself and her husband. Turns out, they're related.\n\n“I just found out so many things I didn’t know,” she said on the Late Show with David Letterman. She discovered that she and her husband are “tenth cousins once removed.” She continued by saying, “It was a little upsetting, I’m not going to lie.” Luckily, tenth cousins is pretty distant, so there are no practical effects of the relation.\n\nPaul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly\n\nA typical Hollywood love story, this power couple met on set. Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly first met when they starred in \"A Beautiful Mind.\" However, it seems it just wasn’t the right time back then. They were both in other relationships while they were filming. But the winds of change blew and they found themselves single soon after.\n\nMonths later, Paul realized his love for Connelly and proposed to her BEFORE they had even officially started dating. The pair got married in Scotland in 2003, and live happily with their children, Stellan and Agnes. This whirlwind romance is still going strong over two decades later.\n\nAmy Adams and Darren Le Gallo\n\nIn classic LA fashion, Amy Adams met her future hubby, Darren Le Gallo, during their acting classes back in 2001. It seems more than just fake love was in the air because the two got together in real life! After six years of dating, Darren finally popped the question, and it took them SEVEN more years to make things official! The pair tied the knot in 2015 and have been together ever since.\n\nThe actors are still very much in love and each considers themself the luckiest person on the planet. They've always supported each other, and they don't show any signs of slowing down soon.\n\nGal Gadot and Yaron Varsano\n\nIsrael’s homegrown model and superstar Gal Gadot is a wonder woman to her husband, property developer Yaron Varsano. The pair have been together for a number of years, well before she scored the role of Wonder Woman. The pair met on a soul-searching adventure in the desert - which involved yoga, chakras, and healthy eating in the Israeli dunes.\n\nWhen they first met, Gal was only 21 then, whereas Yaron was 31 and knew she was “the one.” They got married in 2008 and went on to have three lovely daughters. The pair say they work well together, and their mutual understanding made their match a great one!\n\nSanjay Gupta and Rebecca Olson\n\nWe don't know a lot of famous neurosurgeons, but Gupta is one. He is also a writer and a medical reporter. Like many others on this list, he was fortunate enough to meet his wife when the two were incredibly young. Together, they have built a life and astounding careers together.\n\nThey both grew up in Michigan and went to the same high school and the same University. Rebbeca is a self-employed lawyer. The two lovebirds tied the knot in 2004 in a Hindu wedding which must have been a beautiful sight to see. They have three daughters together, named Sage Ayla, Soleil Asha, and Sky Anjali.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka\n\nNeil Patrick Harris has to be one of our favorite comedy actors, rising to fame on \"How I Met Your Mother\". Neil Patrick Harris is one very talented individual. You’d think with all his talents and skills, it would be difficult to find someone truly worthy, but it seems that he met his match in David Burtka.\n\nThe pair were together since 2004 and tied the knot in 2014 when gay marriage was legalized. The pair have two children together, conceived through a surrogate mother - Harper Grace and Gideon Scott. Those are two very lucky kiddies, especially with that trust fund!\n\nAnna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias\n\nWe're sure Enrique has serenaded his partner, Anna Kournikova, many, many times! The couple started dating after meeting on the set of his “Escape” video clip. Kournikova gave up the Wimbledon pursuit and decided to follow her heart instead. The couple has never officially tied the knot, but for all intents and purposes, they are as much a married couple as anyone else on this list.\n\nOver the years, the couple has graced red carpets and been on everyone’s favorite couple list. Fast forward, and Enrique and Anna have a gorgeous set of twins together, who seem to love their football as much as their dad. Not to mention inheriting the good looks from both sides.\n\nAdam Sandler and Jackie Sandler\n\nHollywood funnyman Adam Sandler is pretty much a comedic genius when it comes to the genre. Anyone who disagrees, well, they clearly haven’t seen 'Happy Gilmore.' The king of late 90s comedy films, Sandler kept himself busy (and still is keeping busy). The couple met on the set of the 1999 film \"Big Daddy,\" and Adam says it was love at first sight - for him, anyway.\n\nHe makes sure to set aside time for his family, which we think is extremely important. Devoted to his two daughters and wife, Jackie, Sandler is quite the family man. We’re sure that the checks he brings into the family also help keep that marriage strong.\n\nViola Davis and Julius Tennon\n\nThe magnetic and charming Viola Davis is a leading lady who’s not to be trifled with, that’s for sure! (Se even has the EGOT to prove it.) But despite her strong, usually fierce character portrayals, she’s got her lover man behind the scenes.\n\nMarried to Julius Tennon, the pair tied the knot in 2003 and have enjoyed married life ever since, even adopting a little girl, Genesis, together. Amazingly, Davis says that Tennon walked into her life a couple of weeks after she prayed for a partner just like him! Now, if that's not meant to be then we don't know what is.\n\nJennifer Grey and Clark Gregg\n\nWhether you remember Jennifer Grey as the furious older sister in \"Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,\" or in the iconic \"Dirty Dancing\" as ‘Baby,’ she’s certainly a memorable face from the 20th century. Grey is married to Clark Gregg, who you would’ve seen more recently in Marvel’s Avengers franchise as Agent Phil Coulson.\n\nThe pair were married for 18 years and went their separate ways in August 2020. However, petty arguments are not in their vocabulary and they remain good friends. Not to mention, they share a daughter which helps put their differences aside to create as healthy a family dynamic for her as possible.\n\nBryan Cranston and Robin Dearden\n\nYou might recognize him from his role opposite Frankie Muniz, but boy, what a performance Cranston gave in the hit series \"Breaking Bad\" as Walter White! However, it was way back when on the set of \"Airwolf\" when Cranston and Dearden first laid eyes on each other. Since then, Robin has supported Bryan through thick and thin.\n\nAfter all those years, we’d like to get the secret to keeping a marriage together and strengthen it with all the challenges every married couple faces. Pretty incredible, but we suppose the fact the pair have lots of royalties coming in doesn’t hurt at all.\n\nPhoebe Cates and Kevin Kline\n\nDoes anyone remember Phoebe Cates from 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and her breakthrough role as Linda Barrett? Another one of her more famous roles was in the comedy-horror 'Gremlins'. Anyway, Ms. Cates was quite the sensation in the 80s and was in fact, already married when she starred in 'Gremlins'.\n\nAs it turns out, when she was only 19 years old, she married someone 16 years her elder - Kevin Kline. Despite the age gap, this hasn’t seemed to faze either of them – more than thirty years on, and the pair are still very much in love.\n\nMichael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan\n\nMichael J. Fox rose to fame on television screens as far back as 1976. For you millennials, he’s the guy who plays Marty McFly in the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy. Anyway, we’re here to talk about love, something which Michael J. Fox and his darling wife, Tracy Pollan, have loads to give to one another.\n\nThe pair first met while Pollan was shooting \"Family Ties,\" but it wasn’t until two years later, on the set of \"Bright Lights, Big City\" that they started getting more serious. Fast forward three decades and Fox and Pollan are still together, especially through crucial years up to today, with Fox suffering from Parkinson’s disease.\n\nTom Selleck and Jillie Mack\n\nWhen Selleck was 38 years old, he went to see 'Cats,' a show that he loved so much. But there was a reason for his fascination with the musical – actress and dancer Jillie Mack starred in it! The pair went for dinner, and the rest is history.\n\nShe was then seen at every event Selleck was invited to – red carpets, awards shows, and ceremonies - she was “his girl.” The two tied the knot and welcomed their bundle of joy, Hannah, into the world just a year later, at which point Selleck quit 'Magnum P.I' to focus on his family.\n\nRachel Zoe and Rodger Berman\n\nCelebrity fashion stylist Rachel Zoe and businessman Rodger Bermant first met while busting tables at the same restaurant and got married seven years later. Coming from humble beginnings that were not nearly as glamorous as their current careers, this is a success story no matter how you look at it.\n\nNow they run a fashion and styling empire together. How romantic! The couple starred in the reality show \"The Rachel Zoe Project\" together. Their marriage was as much of a focus on the show as was their business. Seems to have worked in their favor, as tye are still together!\n\nMax Handelman and Elizabeth Banks\n\nAccording to the couple, they fell in love with each other on the FIRST DAY of college in 1992. After dating for ten whole years, they finally tied the knot. On July 5, 2003, they were wed at the beautiful Graystone Mansion in Beverly Hills.\n\nWhen they met at the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, they both attended a frat party. “The house had run out of beer, so the party was pretty much over,” Handelman said in 2010. The lights came on, and the fraternity brothers were kicking people out. And that’s when he first caught a glimpse of Elizabeth Banks.\n\nMatt and Luciana Damon\n\nDespite being married since 2004, Damon still doesn’t feel qualified to give relationship advice, he once said that he thinks marriage is a crazy idea in general, but he personally loves being married to his wife, so he wouldn't tell anyone anything about his union, nor would he spew unsolicited advice about other people's relationships.\n\nMr. Damon's wife is a \"civilian,\" as he once jokingly referred to her, meaning that she's not from the entertainment industry. Perhaps that's the secret to his relationship's longevity. It's got to be hard coming from two different worlds, but it probably helps Matt to ground himself at the end of a long day on set.\n\nMark Wahlberg and Rhea Durham\n\nFrom a young, fresh-faced teen who was a star in 'New Kids on the Block,' fast forward and Mark Wahlberg is not only a mega-famous movie star and gym junkie, but he’s also famous for passing the 10-year milestone with his wife, Rhea Durham. The couple dated for seven years, during which they had 3 kids, and then went on to get married and have another child.\n\nHe says that their secret is spending plenty of quality time together, it helps to stay \"connected.\" So if these two busy people can make time for each other with their crazy work schedules, then you better make a date night with your significant other today! Prioritize it, and keep the spark alive.\n\nSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller\n\nSeth Rogan and Lauren Miller got engaged in 2011 and married a year later in 2012. The pair met at a mutual friend's birthday party, which they only attended because mutual friends wanted to set the two up. Spoiler: it worked. The two apparently left the party to grab dinner together, and the rest is history.\n\nThey’ve been through a lot together, including Lauren’s mother suffering from Alzheimer's disease, but they go hard and decided to start a charity to help support the cause. When they aren't acting, writing, or bringing awareness for diseases, they like spending quality time with each other; we're sure they're mostly laughing.\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard\n\nThe older sister of Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, is just as esteemed when it comes to Hollywood. The female star of Nolan’s 'The Dark Knight,' Gyllenhaal, has a unique acting charm about her. Tying the knot with fellow actor Peter Sarsgaard a decade ago, the two actually met through her brother Jake! Dating for a few years before Peter plucked up the courage to pop the question, the pair wed in 2006.\n\nThe couple has two children together. It seems that for this pair of actors, patience and a lot of love has gone into making it work. It seems that honesty and communication are the keys to staying far away from the marriage counseling office. With parents like that, we're sure their kids will decide to get into the business too! Wish them many years together, couples like this don't come around often.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi\n\nSince Oprah bowed out, Ellen DeGeneres took the top spot on the podium of America’s most popular and beloved talk show hosts. The charismatic and charming DeGeneres didn’t have the smoothest transition in coming out as gay, but she also helped to raise awareness and the profile of the LGBTQ community. With her Australian wife, Portia De Rossi, by her side, the pair are enjoying the spoils of their success together.\n\nThey still don't have children together; perhaps that'll be the next leap they take. Imagine how cool their kids would be! Regardless, they've built a beautiful family together, and are complete with or without children.\n\nCyndi Lauper and David Thornton\n\nFor the singer of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”, you kind of wouldn’t expect Cyndi Lauper to be going with one guy for most of her life, right? Well, it seems Ms. Lauper is precisely the opposite of her musical persona and has remained with her partner in crime, David Thornton, for nearly 30 years!\n\nWhen the pair met, Cyndi had been dating her manager on and off — a relationship that was causing her more drama than happiness. Fast forward, Thornton and Lauper met, became friends, and before they knew it tied the knot in 1991. The rest is happy history.\n\nPrince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex\n\nThe late Queen Elizabeth was blessed with a long marriage to Prince Phillip. And yet, only one of her children — Prince Edward, her youngest — is still married with no divorce in sight. Prince Edward has always been the Queen's golden child. Just an unproblematic, easygoing man who does his job as a working royal dutifully.\n\nEdward married Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, in 1999. The ceremony was held at the Windsor Castle Chapel known by many thanks to later events — the weddings of Prince Harry and Princess Eugenie in 2018. The couple has two children and is busy being full-time royals\n\nLeslie Mann and Judd Apatow\n\nLeslie and Apatow met at an audition for the movie \"The Cable Guy.\" Apatow was one of the producers and he read the lines that were meant to be acted by star Jim Carrey. He had no idea that he would be reading with her for the rest of their lives. Although, he certainly hoped that the two would meet again.\n\nThe two married in 1997 and are now proud parents of two daughters. Both girls appeared in several movies as the daughter of whatever character Mann was playing. Sounds like they needed no prior preparation for that role. They were literally born for it! The couple has gone on to become one of the prime power couples in comedy, not to mention in Hollywood in general.\n\nVanessa and Kobe Bryant\n\nBasketball superstar Kobe Bryant met his wife, Vanessa, in 1999. At the time, she was only 17, working as a backup dancer in a music video while Bryant was working on his debut music album. After only six months of dating, the couple was engaged. They got married later in 2001, in spite of Kobe’s parents' resistance.\n\nWhen the couple’s daughter was born in 2003, the Bryants reconciled as a family and, in 2006, they welcomed a second daughter. In 2011 the couple filed for divorce but later called it off in 2013. They welcomed their third child in 2016, four years before Kobe's tragic death.\n\nJustin and Keisha Chambers\n\nFormer \"Grey’s Anatomy\" hunk met his wife Keisha, a former model agency booker, while the actor was working on advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein. The two were married back in 1993 and now have 5 children together, ruling out having any more.\n\nJustin has publicly spoken about the support Keisha gives him, stating that they have been through everything together and couldn’t imagine going through anything without her by his side. Upon turning 50, Chambers reflected on the love and support he's had from his wife and family, and how he feels he owes any amount of success to them. Sounds like a marriage that will go the distance!\n\nBill de Blasio and Chirlane McCray\n\nFormer Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, married his activist and poet wife, Chirlane McCray, in 1994. They met when they were both working for Mayor Dinkins’ administration and fell in love from then on. The couple worked together for over two decades trying to make their city a better and more inclusive one. They also place special emphasis on mental health policies and projects.\n\nBefore moving to the traditional residence of the New York City Mayor, Gracie Mansion, the two resided in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where they enjoyed their first few years of marriage. The couple has two children named Dante and Chiara, with both of them attending college during their father's time as mayor.\n\nDave Chappelle and Elaine Erfe\n\nComedian and movie star Dave Chappelle has managed to keep his personal life out of the spotlight and away from tabloids allowing for him and his Filipino wife Elaine to have a smooth-sailing marriage. The two dated for several years before marrying in 2001.\n\nSince then, they've had three children together, sons Sulayman and Ibrahim and daughter Sonal. The multicultural family lives on a 65-acre farm in Ohio Cornfields. The couple is only really ever seen together on Dave’s red-carpet gigs. The secret to their marriage has been staying out of the spotlight. Despite obvious perks like a massive property, the family operates as any ordinary one would, and Dave keeps his professional life separate.\n\nDr. Dre and Nicole Threatt Young\n\nWorld-renowned rapper Dr. Dre had a colorful dating past, having four sons and two daughters by five different women but in 1996 settled down with Nicole Threatt. Prior to meeting Dre, Nicole was married to NBA star Sedale Threatt.\n\nAlthough Nicole’s occupation was an attorney, her life with Beats mogul Dre had allowed her to become more of a socialite and housewife than a practicing lawyer. Dre won over his wife by penning a letter in pursuit of her love. Dre’s creativity has certainly paid off, and the two have been married for 18 years and have two children together.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. and Sara Kapfer\n\nAnother couple on our list who met as teenagers were actor Cuba Gooding and his wife, Sara Kapfer. The couple was together for 30 years, with 22 of them as husband and wife. They were married in 1994 and had three children during their relationship — Spencer, Mason, and Piper.\n\nUnfortunately, their marriage went downhill along with Gooding’s career, and they legally separated in 2014. Their divorce was later finalized in 2017, and the couple is on friendly terms as well as having joint custody of their youngest child, Piper. We're glad to see things could remain civil even in unfortunate circumstances.\n\nPierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith\n\nPierce Brosnan has a lengthy list of blockbuster hits under his belt, including his memorable time as James Bond. The actor has an amazing way with accents, and you may be surprised to know that he was actually born and raised in Ireland.\n\nBrosnan is pretty secretive when it comes to his personal life, something he may have picked up from playing a spy all those years. But the actor is married to Keely Shaye Smith, who he dated for 7 years between 1994 and 2011 when they ultimately tied the knot. The couple has been married ever since, despite a 10-year gap in age.\n\nBarbra Streisand and James Brolin\n\nThe musical legend Barbra Streisand needs no introduction. It seems that she’s been enjoying a wonderful married life with her partner James Brolin. Both were previously married, but following their separations, they met at a party. They quickly realized they had something special, and one date turned into more dates, and finally, marriage.\n\nThey kept it under wraps of course, and only close friends knew they had wed. What we love most about this couple is that in over two decades of marriage, they’ve both ensured not to take one another for granted. They appreciate each other and articulate that appreciation every day together. That would certainly keep the spark alive!\n\nSteven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw\n\nFew names command the quiet of the room like Steven Spielberg. The prolific director and magic-maker, as we like to refer to him, has been married for almost three decades to actress Kate Capshaw. Spielberg took a risk by taking on the lesser-known actress to star in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", ignoring leading ladies like Sharon Stone. Like many times before and since, his risk paid off.\n\nSpielberg, who was married then, was smitten with Capshaw, and apparently, it was worth a costly divorce with Amy Irving. Spielberg hasn’t looked back, almost thirty years later. When love calls, you better listen!\n\nAlyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisof\n\nTheir show, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" might be long over, but the love story that began on that set is far from it. Actors Alyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisof met each other for the first time in 1999 while filming the series together. Things went swimmingly, and in 2003, the pair got married in Palm Springs, California.\n\n\"The How I Met Your Mother\" star has had two daughters with her former co-star. They are named Satyana and Keeva, and the four of them are still one big happy family. The couple actually renewed their vows on their ten-year anniversary after Denisof proposed all over again. The ceremony was held in Hawaii.\n\nWarren Beatty and Annette Bening\n\nDuring his legendary days, Warren Beatty was a notorious player. He could be seen on the arms of all of the hottest stars from the ’60s-’80s. At least until he met Academy Award winner Annette Bening on the set of his film \"Bugsy.\"\n\nIn 1992, the Hollywood power couple tied the knot and proceeded to have four children. Today, the 14-time Academy Award nominee is over 80 years old, and his wife is over 60. They have now been happily married for many years and raised a beautiful family together. A true Hollywood anomaly, and a love story for the ages.\n\nRainn and Holiday Wilson\n\nRainn Wilson and Holiday Wilson met in art class at the University of Washington and haven’t turned back since. As most millennials would put it — #relationshipgoals. “I edit all of her stories. She helps me with all of my auditions. We have a very collaborative relationship,” Rainn shared with \"The Seattle Times\" in 2006.\n\nAt the beginning of their relationship, they were scraping to get by, and he was driving a truck working for a moving company. Her support certainly paid off, and now they enjoy both each other and prolific careers. The duo married in 1995. Together they share one son, Walter.\n\nLL Cool J and Simone Smith\n\nThe 1983 chart-topping song \"Candy Girl\" is just as relevant today as it was when LL Cool J (James Todd Smith) wrote it for Simone Smith. One of her Instagram posts was even captioned, “I’ll be your candy girl forever.” We say, ‘Awww!’\n\nThe two had a friend set them up as teens, and they married in 1995. They stuck at each other's side through thick and thin and even through Simone's battle with cancer. That's what we call “in sickness and health.” Now Simone and Cool J have three daughters together and one grandson. Simone says they are closer than ever.\n\nJon Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley\n\nJon Bon Jovi has married his high school love Dorothea Hurley since 1989. Right in the middle of his Jersey Syndicate Tour, the two eloped and tied the knot. The couple hopped on a commuter plane, flew to Las Vegas, and got married at the world-famous Graceland Wedding Chapel with the cabbie as the witness. They didn't even stay the night!\n\nThe secret marriage angered many fans of the 27-year-old heartthrob, and the backlash against his bride was intense. However, they were able to look past all of that and continue blissfully unaware of the judgment. The couple has four children — one daughter and three sons.\n\nSnoop Dogg and Shante Taylor\n\nShante Taylor and Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr. were teenagers when they met. They became boyfriend-girlfriend and went to prom together long before Snoop Dogg rapped himself a hip-hop fortune.\n\nThey married in 1997 and are still very much in love. Their first son arrived in 1994, and they now share three children. The couple has had some ups and downs, including the personal tragedy of losing an infant grandson. They also faced divorce in 2004 but ended up renewing their vows in 2008. When MTV asked Snoop about it, he simply said he fell back in love with his wife and kids after realizing the industry was blurring his vision.\n\nSting and Trudie Styler\n\nThis British power couple, English actress and director Trudie Styler, and English musician Sting (Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner, if you insist), has been married for over a quarter of a century! From The Police to his solo act, Sting has an instantly recognizable voice that puts him down in history as one of the greats. Meeting in 1982, the pair dated for ten years before finally tying the knot in 1992.\n\nThey've kept their relationship quite private for most past. In the interview, the couple revealed the secret of their long marriage to People Magazine, saying, \"We love each other– which is a given!– but we also like each other,\" well, there you go!\n\nTina Fey and Jeff Richmond\n\nJeff Richmond, a composer on the hit show \"30 Rock\", and comedian Tina Fey met at Chicago’s Second City and instantly hit it off. After dating for seven years, they finally tied the knot in a Greek Orthodox ceremony in 2001.\n\nBesides making people laugh and creating the mother of all early 2000s cult classics — 'Mean Girls', Tina has also moved behind the scenes as a writer and director for other successful movies and shows. Her hubby is always working alongside her, serving as a composer or the soundtrack consultant as he did for \"30 Rock\" and \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\"\n\nJoel McHale and Sarah Williams\n\n“You have to choose your spouse every day,” actor Joel McHale once said about his marriage to the lovely Sara Williams. They've been married since 1996. Joel believes that being happily married is a choice and that if you tell yourself that your spouse is the person that you love and want to be with consciously, every day, then it becomes subconscious.\n\nThat’s a surprisingly candid statement for a guy known more for his comedic exploits than his romance or drama acumen. Perhaps Sarah brings out a softer side of the guy. Either way, these two show just what hard work and dedication to a marriage can do.\n\nAngela Bassett and Courtney B. Vance\n\nHollywood veteran actress Angela Basset and her husband Courtney B. Vance first met in 1980 but only maintained a platonic relationship, that is, until around 1997 when they became something more and tied the knot. Since then, the couple has stuck by each other and watched the other flourish.\n\nVance is quite religious and has said that the Lord and his wife are the most important thing on this earth to him. He also said that the decisions in their marriage are clearer because of their relationship with God. Obviously, their spirituality is a big factor underlying their love for each other.\n\nSteve and Nancy Carell\n\nThe hilarious pair met when Nancy attended one of Steve’s improv classes in Chicago. Steve actually thought that Nancy wasn't interested in him, he said “I thought she hated me because she was very quiet around me... and I later found out that she was just as nervous as I was and trying to act cool.\"\n\nCupid worked its magic, and Steve took Nancy's hand in marriage in 1995. They have appeared on-screen together in a number of projects, most notably on \"The Daily Show.\" With many happy and laughter-filled years, not to mention a couple of kids along the way, the Carells are clearly living the dream.\n\nOprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham\n\nThe ultimate inspiration for any female with a dream, it seems that Oprah Winfrey has also nailed it when it comes to her love life. The magnanimous talk show host and multi-billionaire know a thing or two about life and relationships, and while she’s not married to her long-term partner Stedman Graham, she's still managed to keep a steady relationship for more than 30 years!\n\nThe pair were engaged for a stint, but Oprah decided to call it off. Just the wedding, not their relationship. They just realized that it wasn't the route for them, as Oprah believed that she couldn't have the life that she's created for herself if she lived the traditional married life.\n\nJulia Roberts and Danny Moder\n\nJulia Roberts is one of those Hollywood actresses who’s going to be looked back on as one of the greats. Rising to fame in 'Pretty Woman', opposite the very suave and charming Richard Gere, it was the start of a long and successful career in Hollywood. Her smile won over the hearts of Americans and the world, but the man who wakes up to it almost every morning is cinematographer Daniel Moder.\n\nDespite a rocky start to love and dating, Roberts found Moder and hasn’t had a reason to look back since. We think the reason they’ve remained strong in their marriage is that they choose to say out of the limelight and keep their private life, well, private. Julia once said in an interview that her husband is her “safe place.” How can it get any better than that? We wish them many more years together!\n\nBeyoncé and Jay Z\n\nQueen Bey and Jay-Zee became an item in 1999. She was just 19 at the time but was already known as a force to be reckoned with, and Jay Z was a seasoned entertainer. They just seemed like the ultimate Hollywood couple. In 2008, Jay Z decided that he liked it, so he put a ring on it!\n\nThey have a few gorgeous children and a little empire of their own made out of music, business, and bling in its purest form. They seemed to have a dream relationship, but you never really know what happens behind closed doors. Reading into the lyrics of Beyonce's album \"Lemonade\" will make you realize that the couple may have had a rough patch a while ago, but since the two are still together we assume they worked things out.\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus and Brad Hall\n\nThe comedic actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and director-producer, Brad Hall tied the knot way back in 1987, and the couple has two sons Henry and Charles. They met on the set of Saturday Night Live back in the early 80s, but Julia has continued to make a bigger and bigger name for herself with her most-known roles in shows such as \"Seinfeld\" and \"Veep.\"\n\nOne happy family enjoying their hilarious mom’s $200 million fortune! Not to mention their dad’s own fortune – you might recognize him from SNL as a 'Weekend Update' news anchor. Between the pair, they've racked up a boatload of critical success and awards.\n\nTina Turner and Erwin Bach\n\nTina Turner had been through a patchy and abusive relationship we all know about. She had pretty much given up on love until she met the German gentleman, Erwin Bach. In 1986, he was sent by her European record label to greet Turner at the airport. Bach being over sixteen years her junior; Tina didn't really take his courtship seriously.\n\nLater that year, she was convinced, and they had become inseparable until her last days. Although Bach proposed to her a few times before, they finally made it official in the summer of 2013, after a 27-year romantic relationship! In May 2023, Tina sadly passed away, leaving behind her a legacy.\n\nFelicity Huffman and William H. Macy\n\nThese A-list actors met in an NYC theater company. Although they hit it off, they took it very slow and dated for fifteen years before they finally got married. Years later, they're still going strong. Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy. For 'Shameless' star Macy, this is the second marriage after his first only lasted five years. For 'Desperate Housewives' star Huffman, this is the first and only.\n\nEven in times of great controversy, they stand by and strengthen each other. Like with the notorious College Admissions Scandal - Huffman had to spend a few weeks in prison, and her husband would come to visit her every chance he got.\n\nJessica Alba and Cash Warren\n\nThese love birds met on the set of \"The Fantastic Four\" movie and have been inseparable ever since. While the movie is not very well-remembered by diehard fans of the original comic books, we are sure Alba doesn't regret it one bit. When they celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary, fans adored their gushy posts to each other.\n\nThey still seem to be just as in love as they were when they got married. In 2017 they hit yet another milestone: the birth of their third child, their son, Hayes. Now their two little girls have a brother to bring and lil' yang into the mix.\n\nElton John and David Furnish\n\nThis dynamic duo met in 1993 at a dinner party hosted by \"Sir\" Elton John (yes, he was anointed the title by the late queen herself). Furnish, the Canadian producer — who also directed a 1997 documentary about Elton John — and Elton got engaged and entered a civil union in 2005.\n\nNine years later, in 2014, the same year that same-sex marriages were legalized in Britain, Elton and David got married. The two have also worked on various projects together, including 2011's \"Gnomeo & Juliet.\" What are entertainment industry norms and legal precedents for a couple who is madly in love?\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas\n\nThe stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones shocked the world when she and Michael Douglas announced their engagement. The Welsh beauty has taken the leading lady role in many films, from 'Entrapment' to 'The Mask of Zorro'. And Michael Douglas, well, his reputation precedes him – we really don’t have to list his slew of films!\n\nDecades later, the pair have two kids together and have earned a lavish lifestyle. Cheers to that! Now, they are still gushing. When the couple showed up at the 2022 SAG awards, in honor of Michael Douglas’s best actor nomination for the Netflix \"The Kominsky Method\", they simply doted over each other.\n\nJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston\n\nHitting our screens with some knee-dropping, toe-tapping, and electric dance moves, the star of 'Saturday Night Fever' is a Hollywood heavyweight, and the love of his life is just as grand. But back to their love story — John Travolta came across Kelly Preston on the set of \"The Experts\" in 1989. Although, like Toto's classic song, love wasn’t always on time.\n\nShe happened to be married, and they happened to be filming The Experts together. . . Long story short, she divorced that very year and married Travolta in 1991. The couple had many happy years together, but in 2020 Preston sadly passed away, leaving Travolta heartbroken.\n\nChris O’Donnell and Caroline Fentress\n\nChris O’Donnell and Caroline knew each other for years. In fact, she was the little sister of Chris' friend! And, yes, that did prompt a righteously angry friend and brother, but he soon came around to the idea. Chris popped the question after Caroline became a kindergarten teacher. They married in 1997.\n\nIt’s all about family and marriage for this couple. They have five children, with the youngest born in 2007. Chris attributes their rock-solid marriage to the fact that they balance each other out well. He admits to having a bit of a short fuse, but he says Caroline is laid-back, and she's helped him chill out over the years.\n\nLisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin\n\nIn March 2019, Lisa and Harry Hamlin reached the milestone of having been married for 22 years. Rinna, who had a career in television, was, of course, a mainstay on the show 'Melrose Place', before transitioning years later into reality TV, such as in 'Harry Loves Lisa', 'Celebrity Apprentice', and perhaps her most recent famous role on 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'.\n\nAs for Hamlin, who is an actor himself, also on TV, he’s had quite a successful career as well! The pair married in 1997 and have since had two daughters. In this case, it seems that opposites are attracted, but it’s been successful! He calls their movie star marriage a miracle, she says they’re “soulmates.” The two are crazy about each other, and according to him, they never get tired of each other’s stories.\n\nRande Gerber and Cindy Crawford\n\nThis supermodel couple Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber tied the knot in 1998 and have been going strong for over 20 years now. This is Gerber's first marriage and Crawford's second, after being married to actor Richard Gere for years.\n\nToday, Gerber is a successful restaurant and bar entrepreneur, and Crawford is a busy mom of two — Presley and Kaia— but still makes appearances on magazine covers. Not surprisingly, their kids have already had a few modeling gigs as well, most famously with Kaia looking like a carbon copy of her mother and getting to walk runways and star in campaigns like no one's business.\n\nJerry and Jessica Seinfeld\n\nJerry and Jessica fell in love back in their bagels and lox days; they're much more health-conscious now. Although Jessica is still famous for her Long Island Chicken Parmesan (which she prepared on their first date). While this is Jerry's first marriage (though he's had his fair share of serious relationships in the past), this is Jessica's second, having divorced her first husband in order to start seeing Jerry.\n\nLegendary comedian Jerry Seinfeld divulged that the first time he professed his love to Jessica was over bagels and lox at their favorite NYC Jewish grocery. He described how he turned to her and said, “This is the perfect time to tell you that I love you.” True marital bliss.\n\nColin Firth and Livia Giuggioli\n\nColin Firth, Englishman, Oscar winner, and Time’s 100 most influential people of 2011, tied the knot with Italian film producer and director Livia Giuggioli in 1997. They have two sons together, plus one son from Colin’s previous marriage. However. twenty-plus years of marriage hasn’t always been great.\n\nRegrettably, Colin and Livia landed themselves behind bold headlines in 2019. There was an unfortunate case of infidelity from one party, which took place during a time when the Firths were on a break. It turned out the two had been separated for a few years and that they officially split in 2019.\n\nHugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness\n\nIn 1996, Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness married in Australia. Jackman reportedly knew that Deborra would be his life partner within two weeks of meeting her. When the Australian actors first met on the set of the TV show \"Corelli,\" long before Jackman's \"Wolverine\" days, he knew she was the one.\n\nJackman says that there was chemistry every time he and Deborra-Lee had a scene together. He called said chemistry \"unbelievable.\" The Jackman family includes two adopted children. Despite a seemingly fairytale ending, the couple ultimately decided to separate in 2023, putting their 27-year-long marriage to an end. They reportedly wanted to pursue their individual goals.\n\nDenzel and Pauletta Washington\n\nAfter a few years of dating, Pauletta finally agreed to marry Denzel. Now married for over 35 years, Denzel knows a thing or two about how they keep it together. In an entertaining interview with People Magazine, Denzel said that he does what he's told and he keeps his mouth shut - and voila! Marital bliss ensues.\n\nIt's one of the best marriages in all of Hollywood. They even had Archbishop Desmond Tutu renew their vows in South Africa in 1995! Their family is rounded out by four children, and Pauletta gives the real answer to how they keep it together: “It’s all spiritual, it’s all based on God.”\n\nGoldie Hawn and Kurt Russell\n\nTheir stupendous Hollywood careers collided on several film sets at young ages. Young love ensued. But she was just 21, and Russell was barely 16! The lovebirds partnered up permanently in 1983 after meeting up again on the set of \"Swing Shift.\" Kurt had a son from his previous marriage, and Goldie had two children from hers - celebs Kate and Oliver Hudson. They went on to have a son, Wyatt.\n\nAs genuine life partners, the two have never married yet have remained together for over 35 years. Goldie has explained that the ticket to making things work for so long is that every day, she chooses to stay, Kurt chooses to stay, and they are both very happy with their choices.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson\n\nTom and Rita’s love affair began on the set of \"Bosom Buddies,\" and it never ended. Hanks credits his wife for providing him with an indescribable bond that goes beyond “wife,” “mother,” or “lover.” He mentions her as the inspiration to play some of his greatest roles. Making it snappy, he quips that he is a lucky man, and that Rita could’ve done better.\n\nThey’re probably the only Hollywood couple who has managed to get a public apology out of The National Enquirer for falsely publishing a story about an imminent divorce. The fact is, they’ve been married for three happy decades, and their love has only grown stronger.\n\nVictoria and David Beckham\n\nIn 1997 when the football legend and Spice Girl met, Victoria had no idea who he was. David knew who Posh was, pointing her out to a friend once indicating which Spice girl he’d marry. Still, their romance commenced and they were married by the summer of 1999.\n\nThe British press went berserk and even started rumors about the two splitting up on some occasions. Beckham laid it out, “The simple truth is that I am very happily married.” Beckham sums up their marriage success this way; they stay together because they love each other and because they have amazing children who need them.\n\nLisa Kudrow and Michael Stern\n\nAfter six years of dating French advertising executive Michel Stern, Lisa Kudrow married him in 1995. Many years later, they have one of the most respected and loving Hollywood marriages, plus a son, Julian, who was born in 1998.\n\nIn fact, Kurdow got pregnant while still starring as Phoebe Buffay on \"Friends\". The pregnancy had to be written into the show, and so her character became the surrogate of her brother's triplets! We love learning how shows get creative when their stars get pregnant - and a character as special as Pheobe Buffay can't very well be written out so easily.\n\nCandace Cameron and Valeri Bure\n\nCandace was just 19 when she met 21-year-old Russian NHL player Valeri Bure. \"Full House\" star, a.k.a. D.J. Tanner, was impressed to know he loved the show and watched it to improve his English. They married in 1996.\n\nMany years later, Candace and Valeri are still wildly in love. They attribute their marital harmony, tightly knit family, and bright kids to Christian faith and biblical belief. “The reality is, the glue for us is Jesus.” Their faith has formed the basis of their trust and devotion to one another - so it's no surprise that these two have gone the distance.\n\nIman and David Bowie\n\nStarting in 1992, the rock star Bowie and Iman dated for three years before they married. They were happy (but very private) days, where the couple could focus on each other, rather than get swept up by media frenzy and paparazzi. They have one daughter between them and a son and a daughter from previous marriages.\n\nIman recently opened up about Bowie’s passing, saying she still mourns and that she will never remarry. They had 24 happy years together, and now, as a keepsake, Iman wears a gold pendant with his name around her neck. It's a beautiful tribute that shows that the ones we love are never really lost to us.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nSarah and Freddie met on the set of 1997's \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\" Since then, they appeared in many movies together, and their relationship and careers in TV and film have blossomed. The \"Buffy\" star attributes marital success to being able to “Take the 10 minutes – put the phone down. Have a cup of coffee together.”\n\nFreddie also has some good advice. He said the key is they got to know each other well first. They spent a good two years building a friendship before they dated. Many years and a few kids prove him right.\n\nKelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos\n\nKelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos met in 1996 on the daytime soap opera \"All My Children\" as co-stars and love interests (not much acting necessary!) Their careers have not gotten in the way of their marriage of over two decades worth of loving years. As a family of five, the TV star couple has three children together and maintains a photogenic relationship.\n\nKelly remarked that the pair care for each other deeply and that she's grateful that the two have been able to grow and evolve together. Mark shares Kelly's sentiment, constantly gushing about how crazy he is about his wife. Whether they're working together or just being regular old parents, these two love doing life together.\n\nFaith Hill and Tim McGraw Then\n\nFaith Hill and Tim McGraw were two country music rock stars who fell madly in love while on tour together, a roller coaster ride leaving two exes behind. It almost sounds like a country music song - but that's how some of the best country bangers are created!\n\nThis all went down during Tim McGraw’s 1996 aptly named Spontaneous Combustion tour with Faith as the opening act. Over 20 years of marriage later, they’re still madly in love. Faith said that even after all these years when she watches her husband perform, she is in awe of him. Their side-by-side mega careers in country music hold the cornerstone of their relationship.\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith Then\n\nThey met on the set of \"Fresh Prince of Bel-air.\" Jada Pinkett auditioned but was passed over for the TV version of Will’s girlfriend. That’s okay. She landed it in real life. Shortly after Will and his ex-wife separated, Will called up Jada to ask her out, and the rest is history.\n\nToday they have two children together and lead busy career lives as life partners. And despite tabloids and recent developments, they are still life partners in one way or another. According to Will, he's never met anyone quite like Jada, and if he weren't with her, he would spend the rest of his life searching for love in vain.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick\n\nAww! Sarah Jessica Parker and Mathew Broderick looked absolutely adorable then. More than 20 years later, their charming marriage has aged sweetly. The lovebirds met in 1991, waited until 1997 to get married, and put off having kids until 2002. They’ve managed two careers, and they try to keep things private.\n\nHowever, they do keep a few date sites they are known to frequent near their home in NYC’s West Village. Broderick shared that there is a trick to achieving marital bliss. It's that above all else, they are friends. Not to mention, SJP knows how to make him laugh. That's the secret, folks, friendship, and laughter."
