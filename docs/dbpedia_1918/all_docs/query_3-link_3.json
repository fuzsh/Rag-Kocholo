        "text": "Not sure if this was mentioned here yet, but I don't see a thread.%0D %0D **%0D %0D Neil Patrick Harris is going to have his hands full come fall.%0D %0D E! News has exclusively learned that the ubiquitous actor and his longtime partner, David Burtka, are going to become the parents of twins, via a beautiful surrogate, this October.%0D %0D At least the dads are allowed to celebrate with a champagne toast!%0D %0D A source tells E! that the happy couple have put baby shower plans in motion, as if Harris' chance of winning three Emmys this month wasn't already enough to celebrate!%0D %0D Burtka, a chef and actor who has guest-starred on How I Met Your Mother, was just seen with his multitalented beau last weekend after Harris directed a production of Rent at the Hollywood Bowl.%0D %0D And this is not the first time there's been speculation about Harris' pending fatherhood.%0D %0D Star reported last year that Burtka and Harris had visited a surrogacy agency in L.A. to get the ball rolling on expanding their family. They've been together for roughly six years.%0D %0D Reps for Harris have yet to return our calls for comment.%0D %0D %0D %0D\n\nNo kidding about the hateful comments on eonline! God some people are just sick. This one comment calling the bigots out on it was wonderful:%0D %0D \"To all the haters leaving vile hateful messages about this story. The only reason these kids might have any troubles in life is because of narrow minded idiotic fools like yourselves. Hopefully by the time these kids are older people like you will have been marginalized to the point you know to shut the F*** up.\" %0D %0D\n\nMost likely, their kids, like the children of most gay parents, will not have problems. Children of gay parents do as well as children of straight parents, and in some areas, actually do better. Haters can't change statistics.\n\nHaters can hate. It's what they do.\n\nI must admit I'm a little jealous. I appreciate NPH being out and being a \"good\" example of a gay man but he really does have it made. My partner and I would love to have kids but there's no way we could ever afford a surrogacy... maybe adoption but that's expensive too. Not to mention just the regular costs associated with raising a kid.\n\nI actually don't envy Burtka. It must suck that he and Neil are both actors but Burtka's career has gone nowhere since Gypsy while NPH has blown up. I know he's become a chef but he clearly still wants to be an actor (he had a small part in a gay movie he catered recently). I wonder if kids was NPH's idea to give Burtka something to put his eneregy into full time.\n\nThere some photos with Neil, David and the kids on the net and somebody posted a video of the magic awards on youtube were you can see the kids in some scenes.%0D %0D R46 I think the ex is about 10years older.%0D %0D R38 if David is a starfucker who are the other stars he fucked?\n\nR54 yes and he looked really good in his red underwear. I think he's great as Scooter in HIMYM too.%0D %0D R50 I probably shouldn't post the link here because of you mean queens but at the link is a pic of the baby daddy and David's twins (and funnily enough the article is also about Matt Bomer's husband Simon Halls)%0D\n\nWell, R60, unless you're looking at some other picture of them up-close, I don't see how you can tell.\n\nBut (a) as said above, they're likely fraternal, and (b) if David and Lane did the mix, one could be David's one, could be Lane's.\n\n[quote]It must suck that he and Neil are both actors but Burtka's career has gone nowhere since Gypsy while NPH has blown up.%0D %0D True, but I still don't think he should feel so bad. Neil has been on TV since he was a teenager with a show of his own, so he had a huge advantage coming into his career as an adult that David didn't have.\n\n[quote]It just seems faddish and a whim. I doubt they will stay together. It doesn't seem like a serious endeavor, but rather like a whimsical fad thing to do. And being together 6.5 years is not very long.\n\nYou do realize you're assuming things about two people you know nothing about. They are total strangers to you. I don't know you, so I won't assume, but I will ask, are you really that fucked up?\n\nI really like them too, R87, but I did a complete eye-roll when David Burtka told that poor interviewer that if he could play any female part it would be Madea or Lady MacBeth.\n\nSeriously, you just sang the sassy lesbian duet from Rent. Lay off the First Lady of the American stage nonsense, David.\n\nNeil was very sweet by saying that, of the two of them, David was the actual serious theatre actor.\n\nI think it's great they're starting a family. It seems like they love each other very much, and I wish them all the best.\n\nI honestly think these websites like E Online are patrolled by religious fundies from%0D Westboro and similar, trying to stifle 'the agenda' of any gay topic by hater posting straight away. They're seriously deranged and so are half the people who post here judging these two. David is a failure, David has a nasty personality, Neil is a fivehead. Wow, right. Only on Datalounge. %0D %0D Just be nice why don't you. Be glad for them.\n\nSo happy and excited for them. It would be awesome if the technology existed to inseminate in such a way that there is one bio kid from each of them. Better yet would be to take an egg from a sister of each guy and fertilize them with the sperm of the other guy (then implant each embryo in the surrogate). That way both kids would be a close match biologically to both dads. Each parent, from a bio standpoint, would be uncle to one twin and dad to the other.\n\nWhy are you very much assuming that the sisters would want to be involved?%0D %0D I think most sisters would NOT want to do this.%0D %0D very foolish thinking%0D %0D And also harvesting an egg is physically painful and not a procedure anyone relishes, desires, or wishes to go thru.%0D\n\nI think you are wrong R94. Lot's of women do donate their eggs---usually for money. But a better motivation would be to help someone you love have a child. I would do it in a heartbeat if I had a family member who need an egg.\n\nR86 Neil talked about taking the twins to Disneyland, Magic Awards, American Idol, stuff like that so they're at least somewhat involved in the twins life.%0D %0D R93 David has a sister, Neil doesn't. I don't think I would want to do that, especially if the sister wants/has kids, would be kind of weird, no? That reminds me of Brothers & Sister where the sterile brother got the sperm of his brothers to impregnate his wife.%0D\n\nI think the sister idea is absolutely ridiculous.%0D %0D Very few sisters would want a child running around that she is not raising.%0D %0D And why do you mention money being exchanged, R95 - it is ludicrous that you mention exchange of money since that is not the situation that is being suggested. %0D %0D Of course, money is exchanged when someone hires a surrogate to carry the child to term.\n\nR101, I am perfectly aware of all of that.%0D %0D I explained that I know all of that in my post.%0D %0D What I think is foolish is assuming that two sisters (or one sister) would automatically absolutely want to give their eggs to a brother for a child that the sister would not raise.%0D %0D It is extremely presumptuous to think that sisters would be interested except in the most rare of instances.%0D %0D Do you not understand english or have trouble with reading comprehension?\n\ngod, you're an idiot, R101 - I know all of that about egg harvesting and surrogacy - you have no idea what I was saying! You seem to not be able to read.%0D %0D I was objecting to the assumption that sisters would automatically want to donate an egg.%0D %0D\n\nR101, of course I know that money is exchanges for egg harvesting and surrogacy.%0D %0D What I am objecting to is assuming that a sister would automatically want to donate an egg.%0D %0D I find it ludicrous that one poster thinks a sister or set of sisters would want to automatically donate eggs when 1) it would be for a child that she is not raising 2) very few sisters want their brother to raise their biological child 3) it is quite physically painful and intricate to harvest an egg\n\nNPH just did a 2hour interview on Kevin Pollak's Chat Show. Right at the ende he was talking about the twins and how a lot of paparazzi are already following him around.%0D %0D He also mentions David's twins and how the ex already planned to have a baby before he met David so it was not the same situation like now. Great in interview and I think it will be online later today/tomorrow.%0D\n\nBut Burtka knew going into the relationship that kids were on the way, right? So he took on that responsibility by getting serious with that guy.\n\nMan, if this was a straight celeb couple, the reactions here would be quite different.\n\nR105, I was not sure if you meant that David's ex had already arranged with a surrogate before David came into his life - or if you meant David's ex was just planning to have a baby sometime in the future when David came into his life.%0D %0D If David's ex had already arranged with a surrogate and the ex had already used his own sperm, then it is probably quite different than NPH and David's arrangement."
