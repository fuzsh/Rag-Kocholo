        "text": "Middleton and Prince William started a romance nine years before the Duke popped the question in 2010, during a trip to Kenya with friends.\n\nHe presented the now Duchess of Cambridge with his late mother Princess Diana's sapphire and diamond engagement ring.\n\nOf the engagement ring, Prince William told ITV: I had been carrying [the ring] around in my rucksack for about three weeks before [the proposal].\n\n'Everywhere I went, I was keeping ahold of it, cause I knew if this thing disappeared, I'd be in a lot of trouble.'\n\nThe pair married in 2011 at Westminster Abbey, with Middleton donning an ivory silk tulle Alexander McQueen wedding dress.\n\nThey are now parents-of-three to Prince George, who they welcomed in 2013, Princess Charlotte, who was born in 2015 and Prince Louis, born in 2018.\n\nTimberlake and Biel may have had a brief break up for three months back in 2011, but the pair have been going strong since rekindling their romance over a decade ago.\n\nAnd there appears to be no doubt in Biel's mind that the two's relationship will continue to go the distance. She keeps an email she sent to her producing partner early on in their relationship, which read: 'I will marry this man.'\n\nAfter the couple married in in 2012, Biel gave birth to their son Silas in 2015, and in 2020, following a private pregnancy, they welcomed their second child, Phineas.\n\nDouglas and Zeta-Jones have been together since 1998 despite a brief split in 2013.\n\nSharing her best piece of advice with Good Housekeeping in November 2015, she said: 'It's a long road and I think people today are so quick to throw in the towel on marriage.\n\n'You have to give it your best shot and not give up when the first problem arises, because that won't be the last problem.\n\n'There will be many more down the road.'\n\nThey met on Banks' first day at the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, though she told Allure that she didn't think marriage was on the cards for them.\n\nShe said: 'I didn't meet my husband and think, I've met the man I'm going to marry.\n\n'I was like, He's cute. I'll f--- him, because I'm 18 and in college.'\n\nShe did, however, marry him in 2003 and they have two sons together, Felix and Magnus.\n\nThe pair met in 1987 and married in 1995.\n\nIn 2014, Kudrow told Glamour: 'When [Michel and I] decided to get married, we understood: We're not promising to love each other forever, because you can't do that, but we are promising to work on whatever problems come up.'\n\nShe added: 'We're committed to our marriage working. It turns out, after you have a history, there's such a bond, and love takes another shape.'\n\nDamon met Barroso while she was working as a bartender. They married in 2005 and the rest is history.\n\nTo keep their relationship afloat while he's busy filming shooting scenes, they have a 'two week rule', he revealed to Your Tango in 2015.\n\nHe said: 'I'm not away for more than two weeks.\n\n'I think you need to be with the person you love as much as possible. My wife is my soul mate.\n\n'I don't like being apart from her.'\n\nFord and Flockhart tied the knot in 2019, opting for a casual ceremony.\n\nAccording to People, to win Flockhart over The Age of Adaline star had help from James Marsden, who had dinner with the couple first.\n\nIn 2003, Ford told Hello!: 'I'm in love.'\n\nHe added: 'Romantic love is one of the most exciting and fulfilling kinds of love and I think there is a potential for it at any stage of your life. I was not surprised that I was able to fall in love, and I wasn't surprised that I did.'\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actor and Kering CEO welcomed their daughter, Valentina together in 2007 and married two years later in 2009.\n\nIn February 2021, Hayek opened up about her marriage while appearing on Dax Shepard's podcast Armchair Expert, explaining how she responds when people have made unwarranted assumptions and accusations about her relationship.\n\n'When I married him, everybody said, \"it's an arranged marriage, she's marrying him for the money\". I'm like, \"yeah whatever b*tch, think what you want\". Fifteen years together and we are strong in love and I don't even get offended.'"
