        "text": "Working Groups\n\nWHAT’S AN ANNUAL MEETING “WORKING GROUP”?\n\nNCPH working groups are seminar-like conversations of 8-12 people before and during the annual conference that explore, in-depth, a subject of shared concern. Working groups have a purpose they are working toward, a problem they are actively trying to solve. The working group proposal must articulate this as well as an end product(s) that the group seeks to create.\n\nWHAT MAKES A WORKING GROUP UNIQUE?\n\nTwo things. When a group convenes at the annual meeting, the conversation has already begun. Participants are invested in the outcome. Facilitators have had time to refine their questions and perhaps refocus on the issues. Second, facilitators lead their group in developing an end product, such as an article, a list of resources, an exhibit, a manifesto, a white paper, or a new collaborative project.\n\nHOW CAN I JOIN A WORKING GROUP?\n\nThe 2023 Call for Working Group Discussants is now closed. Please check out case statements from our 2023 groups below!\n\n2023 Working Groups\n\nWG1. Empowering the Public History Workplace: Information, Advocacy, and Collective Power\n\nMeeting Friday, April 14, 8:00 am – 10:00 am\n\nCase statements: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bV7FHj9cmPHXS0gqeeOvmy7n-1lW5Mz-\n\nThis working group aims to create accessible resources for the public history community, and to use our time together to discuss ways to empower public history practitioners to successfully advocate for themselves and their colleagues to bring about desired changes in pay, safety, workplace culture, and beyond. We hope that the working group will help public history practitioners more confidently advocate for themselves and their colleagues, aid faculty teaching courses in public history, more easily engage, on an empirical basis, with the political economy of the industry that they are training students to join, and illustrate to grant funding agencies, governing boards, and management the value and potential of their public history employees.\n\nFacilitators: Alena Pirok, Georgia Southern University\n\nAndrew Urban, Rutgers University, New Brunswick\n\nDiscussants: Sarah Dziedzic, Independent Practitioner\n\nJohn Fulton, Minnesota Historical Society\n\nClaire Herhold, Western Michigan University/Michigan Maritime Museum\n\nDana Kopel, University of California Los Angeles\n\nSarah Marsom, Dismantle Preservation\n\nOnyx Montes, Define American\n\nAbbie Reese, Loyola University Chicago\n\nJessica Scott, University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nPaul C. Thistle, retired Director/Curator\n\nWG2. Processing, Interpreting, and Healing from Historical Trauma\n\nMeeting Friday, April 14, 10:30 am – 12:00 pm\n\nCase statements: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PFQSkkYUf_aTc7UtpL64TLaoDvwUWyXI\n\nThis working group will engage important and overlapping issues within the field of public history: the interpretation of events, people, movements, or places that may cause or recall historical traumas, and the impact that interpretation has on public history professionals, visitors, and collaborating community members. This conversation builds upon recent trends within our field that see public history practitioners pushed further into ever more complex topics of history and more sensitive forms of interpretation. Increasingly, public historians are asked to process, interpret, and live with historical traumas. As our field helps to envision a fuller and more complex vision of the past, we also have to equip ourselves with an ethic of care that will help us process the traumas of history.\n\nFacilitators: Elijah Gaddis, Auburn University\n\nKeena Graham, Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument\n\nAnne Mitchell Whisnant, Duke University\n\nDiscussants: Annie Anderson, Rutgers University – Newark\n\nLouis Bickford, MEMRIA\n\nAdrienne Burke, Miami-Dade County Office of Historic Preservation\n\nRichard Cheu, St. John’s University\n\nJean Robert Frigault, Université de Moncton\n\nHannah Lahti, Loyola University Chicago\n\nEllie Lawson, Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum & IUPUI\n\nCarlos Lopez, Arizona State Library, Archives, and Public Records\n\nPatrick Stawski, Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Duke University\n\nWG3. World War II Home Front, Part Two\n\nMeeting Friday, April 14, 10:30 am – 12:00 pm\n\nCase statements: https://ncph.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Home-Front-Case-Statements.pdf\n\nMany National Park Service (NPS) and other historic sites tell stories of the American World War II home front, stories that include those of the new industrial workers who made wartime production possible, the building of the atomic bomb, and the Japanese American incarceration experience. As the home front experience passes out of living memory, what new opportunities open up for interpretation? What challenges could these new interpretive opportunities present for NPS and other historic sites? What interpretive techniques could help tell these expanded stories? As part of a suite of projects dedicated to the home front, NCPH invites you to join a diverse set of individuals coming from NPS sites, academic institutions, and other museum and interpretive professionals to discuss new opportunities for helping the public engage with these familiar and not-so-familiar stories. Sponsored by the National Park Service.\n\nFacilitators: Allena Berry, Vanderbilt University\n\nSuzanne Fischer, Exhibit Coach\n\nDiscussants: Daniel Blier, National Park Service\n\nHilary Blum, Claremont Graduate University\n\nMcKenna Crews, American University\n\nEric Faeder, National Park Service\n\nStanley Merritt, National Park Service\n\nMeghan Murphy, Manhattan Project National Historical Park, National Park Service\n\nHannah Palsa, Kansas State University\n\nJon Taylor, University of Central Missouri\n\nMegan Woods, National Parks of Boston, National Park Service\n\nZachary Yurek, National Park Service\n\nWG4. Five Year Combined BA/MA in Public History\n\nMeeting Friday, April 14, 1:00 pm – 3:00 pm\n\nCase statements: To protect private workplace information, case statements are available by request only. Please email NCPH Program Manager Meghan Hillman ([email protected]) to be put in touch with the group’s facilitators.\n\nHistory departments at colleges and universities are beginning to consider whether a combined BA/MA in Public History might be a degree that would work well for their students and faculty. The combined BA/MA enables a student to graduate in five years. This working group will be led by faculty members whose departments have begun to offer this combined degree. We will explore how best to use this degree to train students in the field of public history. The working group is open to anyone interested in pursuing the establishment of a combined BA/MA degree at their own college or university.\n\nFacilitators: Andrea Burns, Appalachian State University\n\nCheryl Dong, Bowling Green State University\n\nJessie Swigger, Western Carolina University\n\nDiscussants: Susan Asbury, Middle Georgia State University\n\nKelly Enright, Flagler College\n\nLeah Glaser, Central Connecticut State University\n\nThomas Henthorn, University of Michigan – Flint\n\nMark Janzen, University of West Georgia\n\nJennifer Koslow, Florida State University\n\nKathryn Morgan, American University\n\nM.J. Rymsza-Pawlowska, American University\n\nJon Taylor, University of Central Missouri\n\nWG5. Toward a Statement of Principles for Activist Public History\n\nMeeting Friday, April 14, 1:00 pm – 3:00 pm\n\nCase statements: Kept private for discussant comfort and safety\n\nThis working group will develop a statement of principles and a set of best practices for activist public history projects. Activist, in this context, means projects intended to effect social change by focusing on the experiences of historically marginalized groups, contested histories, and the historical roots of contemporary inequalities. The planned statement and best practices will give practitioners, students, and educators well-considered guidelines to draw upon and refer to when carrying out potentially controversial, community-engaged work.\n\nFacilitators: Richard Anderson, Moravian University\n\nCathy Gudis, University of California – Riverside\n\nlara kelland, University of Missouri – St Louis\n\nKristyn Scorsone, Rutgers University – Newark\n\nDaniel Vivian, University of Kentucky\n\nDiscussants: Kristen Baldwin Deathridge, Appalachian State University\n\nMichael Brown, Rochester Institute of Technology\n\nShakti Castro, Columbia University\n\nAcoma Gaither, Minnesota Historical Society\n\nKimber Heinz, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nAndrea Manalov, Minnesota Historical Society\n\nAislinn Pentecost-Farren, independent Public Historian\n\nElliot Sherrill, University of Missouri – Saint Louis\n\nSarah Soleim, Wake Forest University\n\nLacey Wilson, Albany Institute of History and Art\n\nWG6. Developing Partnerships and Teaching Cultural Heritage and Heritage Tourism in the University Classroom\n\nMeeting Friday, April 14, 3:30 – 5:30 pm\n\nCase statements: Coming soon!\n\nIn this working group, we will explore how public history pedagogy has responded to the changing landscape of cultural heritage and heritage tourism during this late-pandemic/post-pandemic phase. As organizations reopen to the public and classrooms move back faceto-face, we are seeing lasting changes to pedagogy and community engagement. In this working group, we’ll discuss how we have collaborated with partner organizations so students get meaningful experience in diverse applications of public history as the world of cultural heritage and heritage tourism continues to evolve in the 2020s.\n\nFacilitators: Sandra I. Enríquez, University of Missouri-Kansas City\n\nShannon Murray, Calgary Stampede\n\nKatrina Phillips, Macalester College\n\nLindsey Wieck, St. Mary’s University\n\nDiscussants: Melissa Blair, University of Maryland, Baltimore County\n\nEmily Button Kambic, National Capitol Area, National Park Service\n\nKatie Clary, Coastal Carolina University\n\nLeah Glaser, Central Connecticut State University\n\nAmanda Kleintop, Elon University\n\nKent Peacock, Northwestern State University of Louisiana\n\nJennifer Shaffer Merry, Arizona Historical Society\n\nWilliam Stoutamire, University of Nebraska at Kearney\n\nJohn Winters, University of Southern Mississippi\n\nWG7. Decolonizing through Public History: An International Discussion\n\nMeeting Friday, April 14, 3:30 – 5:30 pm\n\nCase statements: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zIJScicCOknpu_xH0cdAD9AnpjBCg_ynQdvkwhFuGfs/\n\nBased on participatory framework and shared authority, public history, both locally and internationally, has the potential to challenge Western and colonial practices and understandings of the past. Inspired by discussions on cultural institutions (museums and archives), public space (colonial monuments), and power, the participants of the working group explore the needs, the meanings, and the different practices to decolonizing through public history. Topics include debates on who can interpret the past, where public history is performed and practiced, and how it can be mobilized for/by under-represented communities. With case studies from different parts of the world, the group wants to contribute to a more inclusive and decentered international public history.\n\nFacilitators: Juniele Almeida, Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF – Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)\n\nThomas Cauvin, University of Luxembourg (Luxembourg)\n\nNoor Nieftagodien, University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa)\n\nKrista McCracken, Algoma University (Canada)\n\nDiscussants: Petros Apostolopoulos, University of Luxembourg\n\nGuneeta Singh Bhalla, The 1947 Partition Archive (India)\n\nCatalina Muñoz Rojas, Universidad de los Andes (Colombia)\n\nSerge Noiret, Associazione Italiana di Public History (Italy)\n\nEmi Tozawa, University of Manchester (UK)\n\nWG8. American Girl Dolls and Public History\n\nMeeting Saturday, April 15, 10:30 am – 12:30 pm\n\nCase statements: https://agpublichumanities.wordpress.com/category/project-statements/\n\nThis working group will grapple with the increased prominence of American Girl dolls (and the history they portray) through food studies, meme culture, the material culture of childhood, K-12 education, Civil Rights, queerness, and neurodiversity. We aim to explore the ways in which many librarians, educators, public historians, writers, and meme creators use the dolls to create and engage with public history for audiences who are more diverse, more online, and less likely to visit traditional historical sites than other audiences. We hope to develop this into public writing as well as an edited collection.\n\nFacilitators: Holly Genovese, University of Texas at Austin\n\nRebecca Brenner Graham, The Madeira School\n\nKatherine Hysmith, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\n\nVanessa Salo, Alexandria Library\n\nEmily Wells, William & Mary\n\nDiscussants: Susan Asbury, Middle Georgia State University\n\nChloë Bee, Royal Holloway University of London\n\nTalia Brenner, North Carolina State University\n\nMaya Brooks, University of Georgia\n\nConstance Cadell, University of South Carolina\n\nAbigail Fine, Queen Mary University of London\n\nJada Furtick, University of South Carolina, McKissick Museum\n\nHillary Hanel Rose, Girl Museum\n\nCourtney Hobson, University of Maryland Baltimore County\n\nElisabeth (Zoie) Horecny, University of South Carolina\n\nElisabeth Medley, Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College\n\nJanine Napierkowski, Girl Scouts USA\n\nJustine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Independent\n\nRebekkah Rubin, Independent Historical Consultant\n\nWG9. Lincoln Reimagined\n\nMeeting Saturday, April 15, 10:30 am – 12:30 pm\n\nCase statements: Coming soon!\n\nThis working group follows up a two-day Lincoln Home Symposium hosted by NCPH, University of Illinois Springfield, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in October 2022. That event focused on the Lincoln Home National Historic Site, using the space as a learning lab to think more broadly about interpretation, preservation, and community engagement at a changing urban National Historic Site that seeks to be relevant to its community. Moving forward the work done at the Symposium by presenters and attendees alike, this working group brings together public historians who work at sites or on projects related to Abraham Lincoln, his time, and his legacy. We focus on the need to re-evaluate and revise approaches to ‘great man history’ in light of contemporary issues of diversity, equity, and relevance.\n\nFacilitators: Devin Hunter, University of Illinois Springfield\n\nTimothy Townsend, National Park Service\n\nDiscussants: David Bowlby, Motlow State Community College\n\nBrian Burtka, Loyola University Chicago\n\nJoan Cummins, President Lincoln’s Cottage\n\nHayley Goebel, University of Illinois at Springfield and Abraham\n\nLincoln Presidential Library and Museum\n\nJackie Gonzales, Historical Research Associates, Inc.\n\nHannaLore Hein, Idaho State Historical Society\n\nClaire Jerry, National Museum of American History\n\nErin Mast, Lincoln Presidential Foundation\n\nChristian McWhirter, Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\n\nDan Ott, National Park Service\n\nRebekah Turnmire, University of South Carolina-History Department and Center for Civil Rights History and Research\n\nElizabeth Westenburg, Idaho State Historical Society\n\nWG10. Uniting Public History and End-of-Life Care\n\nMeeting Saturday, April 15, 1:00 pm – 3:00 pm\n\nCase statements: Coming soon!\n\nThis working group seeks to create a space for conversations between public historians and clinical workers about end-of-life care. Evidence suggests that there is real potential and need for public historians in\n\nend-of-life and elder care, to capture the oral histories of the aging and affirm their memories and to engage collections in ways that promote historical reflection and build community. How do we define this work? How do we go about laying groundwork for collaboration between health care workers, public historians, and oral historians? We aim to identify relevant scholarship, develop definitions that cross disciplines, and envision agendas for future work. We seek to connect professionals in the fields of aging, palliative and hospice work, and mental health with public and oral historians.\n\nFacilitators: Marla Miller, University of Massachusetts Amherst\n\nSara Jane Ruggles, Auburn Crest Hospice-North Idaho\n\nDiscussants: Meral Agish, Queens Memory Project, Queens Public Library\n\nLinda Barnickel, Nashville Public Library\n\nJennifer Coggins, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University\n\nLu Ann Jones, National Park Service\n\nErin McCarthy, Columbia College Chicago\n\nMargo Shea, Salem State University\n\nWill Stoutamire, University of Nebraska at Kearney\n\nWG11. Facilitating Difficult Conversations in an Age of Political Polarization\n\nMeeting Saturday, April 15, 1:00 pm – 3:00 pm\n\nCase statements: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10tScxeyWmhgErakbZKTRs657wUMSvzT2\n\nPublic historians play a crucial role in the ongoing reckoning with the legacies of slavery and colonialism in the United States. By confronting these troubling, often hidden or obscured aspects of the past, communities can begin to recognize the roots of present day inequities and forge a better future for everyone. But how do we engage our communities in difficult conversations about the\n\npast without falling prey to the political polarization that so often shuts these conversations down? This working group will develop a case-study handbook of best practices for facilitating dialogue that welcomes multiple viewpoints, resists cancel culture, and fosters learning and growth."
