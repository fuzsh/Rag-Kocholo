        "text": "The stars will be out in force at the Bay Street Theater this weekend, starting Saturday at 7 p.m. with \"Maybe They're Magic,\" the Sag Harbor venue's 32nd annual summer benefit. This year's honorees are Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka, and Georgette Grier-Key.\n\nMr. Harris, the recipient of five Primetime Emmy Awards, also won a Tony Award for his performance as Hedwig in \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" on Broadway. Mr. Burtka, a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef, is an actor whose Broadway credits include \"Gypsy\" and \"It Shoulda Been You.\" Ms. Grier-Key is the executive director of the Eastville Community Historical Society in Sag Harbor.\n\nThe theme of magic will find expression in the theater, whose decor will be transformed into \"a place of wonder\" where a professional magician will mystify guests as they dine. The evening's performance, directed by Will Pomerantz, Bay Street's associate artistic director, with musical direction by James Bassi, will feature the music of Stephen Sondheim, as performed by Marc Kudisch, a multi-Tony nominee, and Lena Hall, a Tony Award winner.\n\nAfter the performance, the actor and comedian Richard Kind will reprise his role as celebrity auctioneer. Guests can bid on some unusual experiences, including a walk-on role in the theater's upcoming production of \"Young Frankenstein\"; a private dinner for eight prepared by Matteo Boglione, formerly executive chef at Le Cirque, at the winner's home here or elsewhere; a weeklong stay for four in a villa on St. Bart's, and a first-class trip for two to Paris.\n\nTickets are $2,500 for center seating, $1,750 for side seating.\n\nThe theater staff will have little time to catch its breath before Monday evening at 8, when \"Patti LuPone\" A Life in Notes,\" starring the three-time Tony Award winner herself, will take the stage. She will perform an array of songs that are touchstones and reflections on her life growing up in America, from a young girl during the rock-and-roll scene of the '50s to her coming of age in the politically and socially turbulent '60s, to her eventual rise to success and stardom, both with career and family."
