        "text": "Thanks to a career that spans 25 years (at least on IMDB), the boy we knew as Doogie Howser, M.D. in the ‘80s and ‘90s has grown Neil Patrick Harris, the 2014 Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ man of the year.\n\nPictured: Neil Patrick Harris hosted the Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade television special in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Dec. 25, 2013.\n\nHarris (left) and partner David Burtka (right) are engaged to be married, but the duo has yet to set a wedding date. In Oct. 2013, Harris told E! that the two would wed following New York’s passage of the marriage equality legislation. The two are parents to twins Gideon, second from left, and Harper, second from right, born in 2010 through a surrogate.\n\nHarris took the stage at the Primetime Emmy Awards as the show’s host for the second time on Sept. 22, 2013. His first hosting gig as at the 2009 ceremony.\n\nBefore hosting the 2013 Primetime Emmys, Harris hosted the 2013 Tony Awards on June 9, and was joined by boxer Mike Tyson for a musical number. Harris has hosted the Tonys four times, winning an Emmy in 2010, 2012, and 2013 for his on-stage duties.\n\nNot only does he host awards shows, he presents at them — and sometimes gets slimed, too.\n\nPictured: Sandra Bullock, center, presented Kristen Stewart with the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Award for favorite actress (“Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 2’’) with Neil Patrick Harris, right, on March, 23, 2013.\n\nHarris has been nominated for four Golden Globes, twice for his role as Barney Stinson on “How I Met Your Mother’’ (pictured), in 2009 and 2010 (best supporting actor in a television series, mini-series or TV movie), once for his titular role as Doogie Howser, M.D. (1992), and once ifor the 1989 film “Clara’s Heart’’ (best supporting actor in a motion picture). His role on CBS’ “Mother’’ garnered Harris four Emmy noms (2007-2010, consecutively), but no wins.\n\n“Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs’’ is one of the many cartoons to feature Harris’s voice. The first “Cloudy’’ film featuring his version of Steve (a monkey) came out in 2009, and “Cloudy’’ part deux debuted in 2013.\n\nBefore “Monk’’ or “How I Met Your Mother,’’ Tony Shaloub and Harris costarred on the short-lived sitcom, “Stark Raving Mad’’ during the 1999-2000 TV season.\n\nPictured, from left: Eddie McClintock as Jake Donovan, Tony Shalhoub as Ian Stark, Neil Patrick Harris as Henry McNeely, Jessica Cauffiel as Maggie Cooper, and Marty as ‘Edgar’ from “Stark Raving Mad.’’\n\nIn 1998, Harris costarred with veteran actress Debbie Reynolds in the CBS holiday film, “The Christmas Wish.’’"
