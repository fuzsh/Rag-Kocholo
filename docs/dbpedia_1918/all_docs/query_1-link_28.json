        "text": "Before Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka were going on vacations with their adorable 8-year-old twins and stealing hearts with their matching family Halloween costumes, they were a couple of strangers who met years ago on the street. In honor of the 15th anniversary of their first date on Monday, the couple wrote sweet messages to each other on Instagram, and it has us craving that longtime kind of love. First came David's post, which also treated us to a gorgeous throwback photo of the couple.\n\n\"15 years ago Neil Patrick Harris and I met on the street. From that day he has made my world a better place. Thank you @nph for the best years of my life,\" David wrote alongside the photos. Can we just acknowledge that they pretty much look exactly the same as they did 15 years ago?! Neil later posted a photo with his blue-eyed beau from a recent vacation, praising David's lovable qualities. \"I'm so, so grateful to this gorgeous man for giving me his heart, his shoulder, his strength, his lust, his laughter, his joy,\" he wrote. \"Happy 15th Anniversary, @dbelicious. You keep making all my dreams come true. #love.\""
