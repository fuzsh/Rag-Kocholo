        "text": "Today it's all happy news - we have lots of reasons to celebrate; a Royal Baby, a Saturday's Baby, and now we have a surprise celebrity wedding.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris married David Burtka this weekend in Italy. The couple, who are parents to twins Gideon and Harper (aged 3), have been together for over 10 years.\n\nThe 41-year-old How I Met Your Mother star tied the knot with his actor/chef beau David Burtka - and get this, Elton John performed at the reception! You know you've made it when Elton John is your wedding singer.\n\nNeil revealed the news via Twitter, telling his fans: \"Guess what? @DavidBurtka and I got married over the weekend. In Italy. Yup, we put the 'n' and 'd' in 'husband'\"\n\nBoth grooms wore custom Tom Ford tuxedos.\n\nThe couple announced their engagement via Twitter in June 2011 after passage of the Marriage Equality Act in New York. Harris then revealed that they actually got engaged five years earlier, but decided to keep the news a secret.\n\nCongrats! Now we just want to find out more."
