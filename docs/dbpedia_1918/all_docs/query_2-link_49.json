        "text": "Following the untimely death of their regular composer Howard Ashman, who, alongside Alan Menken, had written the soundtracks for The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, Walt Disney Feature Animation were forced to look elsewhere for 1994's The Lion King. As their first film ever based on an original story, and their first to consist entirely of animal characters, the Mouse House was already taking something of a gamble. And they further refused to play it safe by appointing a pop star with no prior experience of the Hollywood machine.\n\nLuckily, the leftfield choice of British national treasure Elton John (then without his Sir title), proved to be a masterstroke. Alongside Tim Rice, the lyricist best-known for his musical theater work with Andrew Lloyd Webber, the Rocket Man delivered five instant classics. Not only did the likes of \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight,\" \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King,\" and \"Circle of Life\" perfectly help push forward the narrative, but they also helped push the film to awards glory at the Oscars and GRAMMYs, a colossal box office figure of nearly one billion dollars, and permanent residency in the pop culture landscape.\n\nOf course, John and Rice can't take all the credit for Lion King's roaring success. Acclaimed composer Hans Zimmer also came on board to give an orchestral touch to the Shakespeare-inspired tale of an heir apparent, who after escaping his wicked uncle's clutches, returns years later to reclaim his rightful position. And professional singers Carmen Twillie, Sally Dworsky, and Kristle Edwards joined household names such as Nathan Lane, Whoopi Goldberg, and Rowan Atkinson in the recording booth, further driving the massive impact of the movie and its music.\n\nThirty years after it first enamored the Blockbuster generation, we take a look at how The Lion King still sits at the top of the Disney soundtrack throne.\n\nIt's Still The Biggest Selling Disney Soundtrack\n\nForget The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, or the more recent musical phenomenon that is Frozen. When it comes to pure sales, the runaway Disney soundtrack leader is The Lion King. The Rice/John/Zimmer collaboration shifted nearly five million copies domestically in 1994 alone. And its impressive worldwide total is now triple that amount.\n\nIt's a figure that also places The Lion King in the top 10 best-selling soundtracks of all time. Indeed, it's Disney's only representative in the list, which includes Prince's Purple Rain, James Horner's Titanic, and Bee Gees' Saturday Night Fever, as well as the \"I Will Always Love You\"-featuring The Bodyguard at No. 1. (It still has a way to go to beat John's commercial peak, though. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road has reportedly sold an astonishing 20 million since its release in 1973.)\n\nIt Made GRAMMY History\n\nIt wasn't just at the box office where Disney firmly established its second golden age. Before the release of 1989's The Little Mermaid, the Mouse House hadn't attracted GRAMMYs attention once. By the turn of the century, however, they'd racked up a remarkable 30 nominations and 17 wins — and The Lion King played a major part in this awards dominance.\n\nIn fact, it made history by becoming the first Disney winner of both Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\") and Best Musical Album For Children, while \"Circle of Life\" picked up Best Instrumental Arrangement With Accompanying Vocals, too. The Lion King also followed in the footsteps of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin by picking up the Academy Awards for both Best Original Song and Best Original Score.\n\nIt Started A Trend Of Pop Artist Composers\n\nWhile Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle had all previously lent their vocals to Disney's second golden age, The Lion King was the studio's first soundtrack to give a pop star composing duties. Alongside Tim Rice, the celebrated lyricist who'd worked on Aladdin, Elton John wrote all five of the album's vocal numbers. And it was a setup that appeared to give several of his peers ideas.\n\nRandy Newman had already picked up Academy Award nods for his composing talents on 1981's Ragtime. But it wasn't until 1995's Toy Story that the singer/songwriter began the fruitful Disney animation partnership that would also take in the Monsters Inc. and Cars franchises. In 1999, Phil Collins co-wrote and performed the entirety of Tarzan's pop soundtrack. And four years later, Carly Simon decided to get in on the Mouse House action by pulling double duty on seven songs for Piglet's Big Movie.\n\nIt Introduced Hans Zimmer To Animation\n\nThe Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado, Madagascar, and The Simpsons Movie are just a few of the hit animations to have benefitted from Hans Zimmer's Midas touch. But it wasn't until 12 years into his career that the German composer proved that his talents could be used just as effectively in the world of animation as live-action. And The Lion King was the catalyst.\n\nZimmer provided four instrumental pieces for the Disney phenomenon including \"This Land,\" \"To Die For,\" and \"King of Pride Rock,\" also bagging two GRAMMYS, an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his efforts. And as he told Classic FM while promoting his work on the 2019 remake, he has a certain family member to thank. \"My daughter was 6 years old. I'd never been able to take her to any premieres, and Dad likes to show off.\"\n\nIt Spawned Several Crossover Hits\n\nAlthough Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin had both spawned big Hot 100 hits (the chart-topping \"Beauty and the Beast\" and Dion and Bryson's \"A Whole New World,\" respectively), The Lion King was the first Disney soundtrack to produce two. \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" reached No. 4 in the U.S. (and No.1 in Canada and France), while \"Circle of Life\" peaked at No. 18. Even \"Hakuna Matata\" saw some Billboard action, gracing both the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Bubbling Under charts.\n\nYou're unlikely to ever see Elton John performing the latter – four of the film's cast members including Nathan Lane provided the vocals. But the two official singles have remained staples of both his live shows and countless compilations ever since. And they've crossed over to the Spotify age, too, with \"Circle of Life\" racking up103 million streams and \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" a whopping 322 million.\n\nIt Birthed Broadway's Biggest Hit\n\nHitting the New Amsterdam Theatre in October 1997, The Lion King wasn't the first Disney animation to get a Broadway stage adaptation (Beauty and the Beast had opened at the Palace Theatre three years earlier) — but it remains the biggest. In fact, thanks to a run of 8,500 shows, its $1 billion-plus gross is now the highest in the theater district's history.\n\nThe Lion King has also made it around the world, picking up numerous Tony and Olivier Awards along the way. And as you'd expect, the film soundtrack's pop numbers have been just as pivotal to the theater production's success as its immersive set design, powerhouse performances, and jaw-dropping puppetry.\n\nThose lucky enough to see the spectacle before 2010 would also have enjoyed something of a lost classic. Sung by Mufasa's hornbill advisor Zazu, the John/Rice-penned \"The Morning Report\" was omitted from the 1994 film but enjoyed a 13-year run in the stage show's opening act.\n\nIt Covers A Vast Range of Styles\n\n\"The plan was that we wouldn't write the usual Broadway-style Disney score,\" John later wrote in his 2019 memoir, Me, about his and Rice's approach to the film. \"But try and come up with pop songs that kids would like.\"\n\nIndeed, while the partnership of Menken and Ashman grounded their Disney sing-alongs in the worlds of musical theater and Tin Pan Alley, the new dream team were determined to venture outside the Mouse House's comfort zone.\n\nThe Lion King OST boasts everything from carefree novelty sing-alongs (\"Hakuna Matata\") and emotive showstoppers (\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\") to campy villain songs (\"Be Prepared\") and rumba rockabilly (\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\"). And then there's Zimmer's instrumental pieces that typically begin with cinematic strings before building up to a Zulu choir crescendo, immediately transporting listeners to the vast landscape of Pride Rock.\n\nIt Kickstarted Elton John's Second Career\n\n\"I sat there with a line of lyrics that began, 'When I was a young warthog,'\" John told Time magazine in 1995 about the inception of The Lion King soundtrack, \"and I thought, 'Has it come to this?'\"\n\nThe pop legend needn't have worried. The song in question, \"Hakuna Matata,\" might not have been his most lyrically sophisticated. But the comic interlude proved that John could put an infectious melody to literally any subject. And alongside his four other contributions, it gave him the impetus to further explore the world of musical theater.\n\nThe Brit subsequently reunited with Rice for 2000's Aida, a pop-oriented adaptation of Giuseppi Verdi's same-named opera which earned a GRAMMY for Best Musical Show Album in 2001. And then in 2005, John struck Broadway gold once again with the multiple Tony Award-winning screen-to-stage transfer of ballet drama Billy Elliot. That same year, he also teamed up with regular collaboratorBernie Taupin on the score for Lestat, a musical version of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles.\n\nIt Formed Part Of The 2019 Remake\n\nProof of just how well The Lion King soundtrack has endured came in 2019 when Jon Favreau's live-action remake borrowed all five of its vocal numbers. The performers were different, of course — see the likes of John Oliver on \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King,\" Beyoncé and Donald Glover on \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight,\" and Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner on \"Hakuna Matata.\" But while Zimmer's reimaginings gave them an additional African flavor, the songs didn't stray too far from the source material.\n\nBut even with a starrier cast and a bunch of new compositions and covers, the new Lion King OST failed to strike the same chord with the cinemagoing public, selling just a fraction of its predecessor. Even Beyoncé's flagship single \"Spirit\" failed to peak any higher than No. 98 on the Hot 100. Sometimes, the originals truly are the best.\n\nHow 1995 Became A Blockbuster Year For Movie Soundtracks\n\nWhile in a studio, Andrew Watt bounces off the walls. Just ask Mick Jagger, who once had to gently tell the 33-year-old, \"Look, I can deal with this, but when you meet Ronnie and Keith, you have to dial it down a little bit.\"\n\nOr ask Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard. \"He really got the best out of [drummer] Matt [Cameron] just by being excited — literally jumping up and down and pumping his fist and running around,\" he tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nAs Watt's hot streak has burned on, reams have rightly been written about his ability to take a legacy act, reconnect them with their essence, and put a battery in their back. His efficacy can be seen at Music's Biggest Night: Ozzy Osbourne's Patient Number 9 won Best Rock Album at the 2023 GRAMMYs. At the last ceremony, the Rolling Stones were nominated for Best Rock Song, for Hackney Diamonds' opener \"Angry.\"\n\nOn Pearl Jam's return to form, Dark Matter, due out April 19. Who was behind the desk? Take a wild guess.\n\n\"You want to see them live more than you want to listen to their albums, and they have the ability to look at each other and play and follow each other. I don't like my rock music any other way, as a listener,\" Watt tells GRAMMY.com. \"All my favorite records are made like that — of people speeding up, slowing down, playing longer than they should.\"\n\nAs such, Watt had a lightbulb moment: to not record any demos, and have them write together in the room. \"They're all playing different stuff, and it makes up what Pearl Jam is, and singer Eddie [Vedder] rides it like a wave.\"\n\nIf you're more of a pop listener, there's tons of Watt for you — he's worked with Justin Bieber (\"Hit the Ground\" from Purpose), Lana Del Rey (\"Doin' Time\" from Norman F—ing Rockwell) and much more. Read on for a breakdown of big name rockers who have worked with Andrew Watt.\n\nPearl Jam / Eddie Vedder\n\nWatt didn't just produce Dark Matter; he also helmed Vedder's well-received third solo album, Earthling, from 2022. Watt plays guitar in Vedder's live backing band, known as the Earthlings — which also includes Josh Klinghoffer, who replaced John Frusciante in the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a stint.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nDark Matter was a comeback for Pearl Jam, but Hackney Diamonds was really a comeback for the Stones. While it had a hater or two, the overwhelming consensus was that it was the Stones' best album in decades — maybe even since 1978's Some Girls.\n\n\"I hope what makes it fresh and modern comes down to the way it's mixed, with focus on low end and making sure the drums are big,\" Watt, who wore a different Stones shirt every day in the studio, has said about Hackney Diamonds. \"But the record is recorded like a Stones album.\"\n\nWhere there are modern rock flourishes on Hackney Diamonds, \"There's no click tracks. There's no gridding. There's no computer editing,\" he continued. \"This s— is performed live and it speeds up and slows down. It's made to the f—ing heartbeat connection of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Steve Jordan.\n\n\"And Charlie,\" Watt added, tipping a hat to Watts, who played on Hackney Diamonds but died before it came out. \"When Charlie's on it.\"\n\nIggy Pop\n\nEver since he first picked up a mic and removed his shirt, the snapping junkyard dog of the Stooges has stayed relevant — as far as indie, alternative and punk music has been concerned.\n\nBut aside from bright spots like 2016's Josh Homme-produced Post Pop Depression, his late-career output has felt occasionally indulgent and enervated. The 11 songs on 2023's eclectic Watt-produced Every Loser, on the other hand, slap you in the face in 11 different ways.\n\n\"We would jam and make tracks and send them to Iggy, and he would like 'em and write to them or wouldn't like them and we'd do something else,\" Watt told Billboard. \"It was very low pressure. We just kept making music until we felt like we had an album.\" (And as with Pearl Jam and Vedder's Earthlings band, Watt has rocked out onstage with Pop.\n\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nYou dropped your crown, O Prince of Darkness. When he hooked up with Watt, the original Black Sabbath frontman hadn't released any solo music since 2010's Scream; in 2017, Sabbath finally said goodbye after 49 years and 10 (!) singers.\n\nOn 2020's Ordinary Man and 2022's Patient Number 9, Watt reenergized Ozzy; even when he sounds his age, Ozz sounds resolute, defiant, spitting in the face of the Reaper. (A bittersweet aside: the late Taylor Hawkins appears on Patient Number 9, which was written and recorded in just four days.)\n\nMaroon 5\n\nYeah, yeah, they're more of a pop-rock band, but they have guitars, bass and drums. (And if you're the type of rock fan who's neutral or hostile to the 5, you shouldn't be; Songs About Jane slaps.)\n\nAt any rate, Watt co-produced \"Can't Leave You Alone,\" featuring Juice WRLD, from 2021's Jordi. Critics disparaged the album, but showed Watt's facility straddling the pop and rock worlds.\n\n5 Seconds of Summer\n\nWhen it comes to Andrew Watt, the Sydney pop-rockers — slightly more on the rock end than Maroon 5 and their ilk — are repeat customers. He produced a number of tracks for 5 Seconds of Summer, which spanned 2018's Youngblood, 2020's Calm and 2022's 5SOS5.\n\nRegarding the former: Watt has cited Youngblood as one of the defining recording experiences of his life.\n\n\"I had started working with 5 Seconds of Summer, and a lot of people looked at them as a boy band, but they're not,\" Watt told Guitar Player. \"They're all incredible musicians. They can all play every instrument. They love rock music. They can harmonize like skyrockets in flight. They just were making the wrong kind of music.\"\n\nSo Watt showed 5 Seconds of Summer a number of mainstays of the rock era, like Tears for Fears and the Police. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nElton John\n\nA year after Britney Spears was unshackled from her highly controversial conservatorship, it was time for a victory lap with the God of Glitter. What resulted was a curious little bauble, which became a megahit: \"Hold Me Closer,\" a spin on \"Tiny Dancer,\" \"The One\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" that briefly launched Spears back into the stratosphere.\n\n\"Britney came in and she knew what she wanted to do,\" Watt recalled to The L.A. Times. \"We sped up the song a little bit and she sang the verses in her falsetto, which harkens back to 'Toxic.' She was having a blast.\"\n\nBlink-182\n\nWatt has also worked with pop/punk heroes Blink-182 — but not after Tom DeLonge made his grand return. He produced \"I Really Wish I Hated You\" from 2019's Nine, back when Matt Skiba was in the band.\n\nWhere in the rock world will this tender-aged superproducer strike next? Watt knows.\n\nSongbook: The Rolling Stones' Seven-Decade Journey To Hackney Diamonds\n\nBritney Spears recently posted a message on Instagram that asserted she'd never return to the music business. She later deleted it, which could be taken as a sign that she hasn't made this big decision with such finality. But it was certainly an alarming statement to her diehard fans eagerly awaiting new music.\n\nIt's fair to hold out hope that Spears will want to be a public entertainer and recording artist again in some ways — after all, she did just release a memoir, The Woman in Me, in October, and the book reveals a healing woman. And, of course, she scored a worldwide hit in 2022 with Elton John in \"Hold Me Closer.\"\n\nEven if she never releases another piece of music, Spears already has quite the legacy. Between five No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, and a GRAMMY win, her mark on pop music is undeniable. Part of that impact is courtesy of \"Toxic,\" the danceable smash that was released as a single in January 2004 (and won Spears her GRAMMY in 2005).\n\nIn honor of the 20th anniversary of \"Toxic,\" GRAMMY.com surveyed the pop superstar's hits and deep cuts from 1998 to the present in order to break down some of the most essential tracks in Spears' catalog. Between beautiful ballads and brazen bops, let the reminiscing commence.\n\n\"...Baby, One More Time,\" ...Baby One More Time (1998)\n\nWritten and co-produced by powerhouse Swedish pop producer Max Martin — a frequent collaborator throughout Spears' career — the singer's debut single was rewarded with some of the highest honors of the music industry when she was just 17 years old.\n\n\"...Baby, One More Time\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 42nd GRAMMY Awards. It has since sold over 10 million copies, and to this day remains one of her defining hits. (And to think it almost wasn't hers: According to Yahoo! News Australia, the song was reportedly originally offered to the Backstreet Boys.)\n\nThe song's instantly meteoric success was undoubtedly catapulted by its memorable video, which sees Spears dance her way through private school halls in a (now iconic) skimpy uniform. Seeing it performed visually cemented her image as a young, belly-baring flirt with girl-next-door looks, approachable style and enviable dancing skills, an archetype that little girls everywhere wanted to emulate.\n\n\"Oops!... I Did It Again,\" Oops!... I Did It Again (2000)\n\nSpears further played with her innocent image on \"Oops!... I Did It Again,\" a sassy song that suggests suitors aren't exactly safe with their heart in her hands. It was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 43rd GRAMMYs.\n\n\"I think I did it again,\" she sings at the top of the track. \"I made you believe we're more than just friends.\" Spawning another classic video and another trademark look (this time, a red catsuit), \"Oops\" emphasized Spears' further pivot into naughtiness and had thousands learning her choreography in a pre-YouTube era.\n\nAnother Max Martin and Rami Yacoub production, \"Oops\" stuck at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, but the album of the same name debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and set first-week records for sales by a woman artist at the time with 1,319,913 copies sold.\n\n\"Lucky,\" Oops!... I Did It Again (2000)\n\n\"Lucky\" is a peppy song with a sprinkle of sadness on top. Its titular character is a Hollywood girl who seems to have it all, but there's no one to share her success with, so she is lonely and cries at night. It was a poignant sentiment, given her fame at the time, and was re-examined by fans in recent years as she fought for freedom from her conservatorship overseen by her father, Jamie Spears.\n\nWhile it didn't manage to break the top 20 of the Hot 100, \"Lucky\" has always been a fan favorite. The song did break through internationally, though, becoming a No. 1 hit in three European countries as well as on Europe's overall pop chart.\n\n\"Dear Diary,\" Oops!... I Did It Again (2000)\n\nSpears has worked with a global roster of songwriters and producers over the years, but the Oops! ballad \"Dear Diary\" marked a special moment for the star: it was the first album cut that she co-wrote.\n\nWhile Oops!... I Did It Again largely showed a maturing Spears, the innocence and sweetness of \"Dear Diary\" served as a reminder that she was still just a teenager in the beginning of her stardom. The track also seemingly gave her the confidence to co-write more of her songs, as she had a hand in writing almost half of 2001's Britney and almost all of 2003's In the Zone.\n\n\"I'm a Slave 4 U,\" Britney (2001)\n\nSpears went rather gritty on the lead single to her third, self-titled album. While earlier singles may have had a sexy wink within their words, the lyrics of \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" took a deeper plunge into the erotic zone. \"All you people look at me like I'm a little girl,\" she sings defensively. \"Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?\"\n\nAlong with the racy lyrics, Spears' visual performances of the song — a music video depiction of a steamy basement club night and a VMA performance that included dancing with an Albino Burmese python around her neck — added more cultural moments to her repertoire.\n\n\"Overprotected,\" Britney (2001)\n\nSpears' massive fame made her an early paparazzi magnet and led her to be sheltered by her management, record label and family. These topics are addressed head-on over the soaring notes of \"Overprotected.\"\n\n\"Say hello to the girl that I am/ You're gonna have to see through my perspective,\" she declares on the opening verse. \"I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am/ And I don't wanna be so damn protected.\"\n\nThe anthem foreshadowed her future hit \"Piece of Me\" — and the struggle for independence she'd later fight for during her conservatorship — but ultimately showed that she isn't afraid to speak her mind and fight for what's hers.\n\n\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\" Britney (2001)\n\nAfter two bold statements with Britney's first two singles (\"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and \"Overprotected\"), Spears pumped the brakes on the notion of her growing up too fast in the ballad \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.\" The song appeared on her third album, Britney, and in the soundtrack for the road trip dramedy Crossroads.\n\n\"There is no need to protect me,\" she sings powerfully on the track, which appears to mirror her experience in real life at that moment in time. \"It's time that I/ Learn to face up to this on my own/ I've seen so much more than you know now/ So don't tell me to shut my eyes.\"\n\n\"Toxic,\" In the Zone (2003)\n\n\"Toxic\" is an uptempo whirlwind of sampled Bollywood strings and Swedish pop drama crafted by the popular dance pop producers Bloodshy & Avant. Another single that took on a life of its own visually, the video served up another set of iconic looks: the deadly assassin, the sparkly nude bodysuit and the perky flight attendant.\n\n\"Toxic\" remains Spears' biggest hit as of press time, now certified six-times platinum by the RIAA and the only song with more than one billion streams on Spotify. It also won Spears her one GRAMMY, for Best Dance Recording at the 47th GRAMMY Awards.\n\nAnd 20 years after its release as a single, \"Toxic\" has had remarkable staying power on the pop charts. As of 2023, the song appeared on the Hot 100 in three different incarnations: the original track and the mash-ups \"Toxic Pony\" by Altégo and \"Toxic Las Vegas\" by Jamieson Shaw.\n\n\"Everytime,\" In the Zone (2003)\n\nBy this era of Spears' discography, fans were more than used to autotune and other processed treatments on her singing — but \"Everytime\" is Spears in a more vulnerable and unplugged state. Co-written by Spears, the slow, melancholic ballad hit even harder because it was released after her public breakup with Justin Timberlake.\n\nFans hadn't heard anything quite as sad from Spears in her career as the pining lyrics of the chorus on \"Everytime\": \"And every time I try to fly I fall/ Without my wings/ I feel so small/ I guess I need you, baby.\" The song became a fan favorite for the rawness of her vocal delivery, and was also a personal favorite for Spears during her Las Vegas concert residency.\n\n\"Womanizer,\" Circus (2008)\n\nSpears' father began his role as her conservator in February 2008. Seven months later, she released \"Womanizer,\" the lead single to her sixth album, Circus — which proved that no one was going to hold her down.\n\n\"You say I'm crazy,\" she sneers on the chorus of the engine-roaring uptempo track, which pokes fun at recent troubles with her ex-husband Kevin Federline. \"I got your crazy!\" she adds, sarcastically.\n\nWhile the song's message focused on telling off a, well, womanizer, its commercial success showed Spears' new conservatorship meant nothing for her staying power. \"Womanizer\" was her first No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 since \"...Baby, One More Time\" topped the chart in January 1999; it also earned Spears her seventh GRAMMY nomination, for Best Dance Recording at the 2010 GRAMMYs.\n\n\"If You Seek Amy,\" Circus (2008)\n\nIf the title to the sing-songy \"If You Seek Amy\" is said out loud, it sounds like a sexual proposition. And that's exactly what makes this Max Martin-produced track so enjoyable.\n\nDespite everything she was experiencing in her personal life, it offered evidence that Spears still knew how to poke fun at her staying at the center of attention. It's a perfect time capsule to an era when she was most wanted by the paparazzi.\n\n\"Hold It Against Me,\" Femme Fatale (2011)\n\nSpears' \"Hold It Against Me\" flips an old chauvinistic joke into girl power — another clever piece added to the singer's puzzle. After being objectified so much over the course of her career, this song was her bid to put an end to it.\n\n\"Hold It Against Me\" continued Spears' late 2000s hot streak into the 2010s. It earned the singer her fourth No. 1 on the Hot 100, following the chart-topping success of \"3,\" her cheeky ode to threesomes, in 2009.\n\n\"Work B—,\" Britney Jean (2013)\n\nSpears assumes a faux British accent for \"Work B—,\" a bossy cut made for gyms or the club. \"You want a hot body? You want a Bugatti? You want a Maserati?\" she asks over an insistent beat. \"You better work, b—… now get to work, b—!\"\n\nShortly after the track was released in 2013, Spears told English talk show host Alan Carr that the song is a tribute to her gay male friends, with whom she uses the word b— playfully and affectionately as a term of endearment. It became both a gay club anthem and a top 20 hit on the Hot 100 chart, and the video revived interest in Spears' dancing chops.\n\n\"Slumber Party (feat. Tinashe), Glory (2016)\n\nA slightly different sound for Spears compared to her pop and dance productions, \"Slumber Party\" features Tinashe with a lyrical cadence that is more in the R&B singer's realm. It's perhaps the Spears song with the most urban radio feel since \"I'm a Slave 4 U.\"\n\nFans may also remember \"Slumber Party\" fondly for what was once a romantic reason: Spears' now ex-husband Sam Asghari was cast as the leading man in the lingerie-heavy music video; it's how they first met each other.\n\n\"Hold Me Closer\" with Elton John, The Lockdown Sessions (2022)\n\nWhat better way to celebrate a big feat than with a massive collaboration? Nine months after Spears' long-fought conservatorship was terminated, she dropped a team-up with none other than Sir Elton John.\n\nThe unexpected duo released \"Hold Me Closer,\" a soaring duet that interpolates parts of John's beloved hits \"Tiny Dancer,\" \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" and \"The One\" into a singular modern mix. And though Spears is more of a background vocalist, her first release in six years marked quite the comeback: \"Hold Me Closer\" topped the Billboard Adult Top 40 and the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs charts, and reached No. 6 on the Hot 100.\n\nAs of press time, \"Hold Me Closer\" is the last song that Spears has released to date. While it's possible that there may not be any more recordings to follow, it's also safe to say she has surprised the world more than once before.\n\nHow Many GRAMMYs Has Britney Spears Won? 10 Questions About The \"Hold Me Closer\" Singer Answered"
