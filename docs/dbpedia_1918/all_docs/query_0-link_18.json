        "text": "Together: 27 years\n\nYes, RuPaul Charles is the man behind the hugely-loved RuPaul’s Drag Race, but he's just as successful in his personal life. In fact, he's been in a relationship with Australian rancher Georges LeBar for over 25 years.\n\n\"I met Georges right on the dance floor at the Limelight disco at 6th Avenue and 21st Street on his birthday in 1994,\" RuPaul said in a 2019 interview. \"We’ve had our ups and downs and everything in between, and there isn’t a person on this planet I like being around more than him.\"\n\nThey're also very honest about being in an open relationship. \"I love him too much to try to put shackles on him,\" RuPaul told Vogue with tears in his eyes. \"Love is free. It’s not that sort of romantic surface thing we all bought into. He is my most favourite person that I’ve met.\"\n\nBesides, he added: \"Gore Vidal said you should never pass up an opportunity to have sex or be on television.\"\n\nTogether: 10 years\n\nRyan Gosling and Eva Mendes met on the set of the 2012 film The Place Beyond the Pines in which they both starred. Since then, they've been very private about their relationship, but we do know they have two daughter together. In fact, The Place Beyond the Pines was the only red carpet appearance they've ever made together. Perhaps that's the secret to their successful relationship?\n\nTogether: 14 years\n\nIs there a relationship in all of celebdom greater than GLAMOUR cover star Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's? We think not. Not only has this relationship inspired one of the most charming love songs of recent times (John Legend's 'All of Me'), but it fills us with joy every day thanks to Chrissy's wit and very funny posts on Twitter and Instagram. They've been together since they met on the set of his 2007 music video for 'Stereo', got married in 2013, and welcomed their daughter Luna in 2016 and son Miles in 2018. Chrissy has also spoken openly about their fertility struggles, and conceiving her children through IVF – so they're funny, lovely and inspiring too.\n\nTogether: 29 years\n\nSarah Jessica Parker played serial dater Carrie Bradshaw in Sex And The City but, in real life, she’s more of a monogamist. After splitting from Robert Downey Jr, her boyfriend of seven years, SJP married Matthew Broderick in 1997, five years after their first date. So what’s the secret to the couple’s staying power? Sarah Jessica can’t tell us, unfortunately: “I'm certainly no expert in relationships, God knows, but you need to be with someone who believes in you 100 per cent. If you don't have that, there's no point.\"\n\nTogether: 20 years\n\nWhen he’s not being Borat, Ali G, Bruno or any of his other alter-egos, Sacha Baron Cohen is married to Isla Fisher. The pair met at a Sydney party in 2001 and Isla spent three years studying so she could convert to Judaism and marry him. \"I will definitely have a Jewish wedding just to be with Sacha. I would do anything – move into any religion – to be united in marriage with him. We have a future together, and religion comes second to love as far as we are concerned,\" she said before their 2010 nuptials. Fast-forward a decade and they have three children together – Olive, 12, Elula, eight, and Montgomery, four.\n\nTogether: Approx. 40 years\n\nFelicity Huffman and William H. Macy met in the early 1980s but took things slowly. Macy asked her to marry him several times over the years, but Huffman was reluctant. \"I thought I'd disappear. Men's stock when they get married goes up. Women's stock goes down,\" she has said. Eventually though, she couldn't say no: \"I was finally smart enough to go: 'I'm going to marry this guy or really lose him for good,'\" she explained.\n\nTogether: 34 years\n\nKevin Bacon officially met Kyra Sedgwick on the TV set of Lemon Sky in 1987 (though Sedgwick had seen him perform in a play when she was just 12 years old) and were married a year later. \"The time I was hitting what I considered to be bottom was also the time I met my wife, our kids were born, good things were happening. And I was able to keep supporting myself; that always gave me strength,\" Kevin said of the early years of his marriage.\n\nTogether: 44 years\n\nDenzel met his future wife Pauletta Pearson on the set of 1970s TV movie Wilma, and they began to date shortly after.\n\nThey married in 1983, and started a family just a year later.\n\nWhen asked by People how he keeps his marriage going after all this time, he joked“I keep my mouth shut!”, and was unable to pick his favourite thing about Pauletta, claiming there were “too many things.”"
