Today, Nikon Corporation is pleased to announce that total production of NIKKOR lenses for Nikon SLR cameras and Nikon 1 advanced cameras with interchangeable lenses reached seventy-five million at the beginning of November 2012.

In 1959, Nikon then Nippon Kogaku K.K., released its first NIKKOR lens for SLR cameras, the NIKKOR-S Auto 5cm f/2, alongside its first SLR camera, the Nikon F. Since its initial release, Nikon has cultivated a strong NIKKOR tradition and expanded its lineup of interchangeable lenses to bring total production to seventy-five million. Nikon reached the seventy million lens milestone in May 2012, and over the past six months has continued to actively release new NIKKOR lenses for its D-SLR and Nikon 1 camera lines.

In June 2012, Nikon released the compact and lightweight FX-format AF-S NIKKOR 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR zoom lens, offering a frequently used focal range and support for a wide variety of photographic scenes, as well as the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR high-power zoom lens that offers a dynamic 16.7x zoom ratio for DX-format shooters. In late October 2012, Nikon also introduced the AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f/4 telephoto zoom lens, the latest addition to the popular series of f/4 lenses, and the first NIKKOR lens to feature the third generation of Nikon’s Vibration Reduction (VR) technology with up to five stops of image stabilization.

Nikon also recently introduced several new lens options for Nikon 1 System shooters. In August 2012, Nikon announced the 1 NIKKOR 11-27.5mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom lens, and further expanded the 1 NIKKOR series with the introduction of the fast and lightweight 1 NIKKOR 18.5mm f/1.8 fixed focal length lens in September 2012. Since the introduction of the Nikon 1 system in October 2011, Nikon has released six 1 NIKKOR lenses including the 1 NIKKOR 10mm f/2.8 low-profile fixed pancake lens, 1 NIKKOR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 normal zoom lens, 1 NIKKOR 30-110mm f/3.8-5.6 high-power zoom lens and the 1 NIKKOR 10-100mm f/4.5-5.6 power zoom lens specifically designed for video.

The NIKKOR lens lineup features over 80 types of lenses built for a wide variety of users, from beginners to professional photographers. The current line features zoom lenses, ultra wide-angle, super telephoto lenses, specialty fisheye, Micro and PC-E lenses for SLR cameras as well as 1 NIKKOR lenses for the Nikon 1 System. Nikon will continue to actively develop and release high-performance, highly functional products that meet and exceed user expectations.

About NIKKOR

The brand name for Nikon lenses, NIKKOR has become synonymous with high-performance, high-quality SLR lenses. The NIKKOR name comes from adding "R"—a common practice in the naming of photographic lenses at the time the name was established—to "Nikko", the Romanized abbreviation for Nippon Kogaku K.K. In 1933, the large-format lens for aerial photography was released with the name Aero-Nikkor.

NIKKOR lenses incorporate optical technologies that are always ahead of the times. The OP Fisheye-Nikkor 10mm f/5.6 fisheye lens for SLR cameras, released in 1968, was the world's first lens to incorporate aspherical lens elements. The Ultra Micro-Nikkor 105mm f/2.8 released in 1962 served as the template for projection lenses employed in Nikon IC steppers and scanners that currently boast the world’s highest level of resolution. What’s more, NIKKOR lenses for the latest SLR cameras utilize a number of cutting-edge technologies that originated with the development of IC steppers and scanners, including Nano Crystal Coat, which virtually eliminates internal lens element reflections across a wide range of wavelengths.

From initial design and development, production and quality is controlled in accordance with Nikon’s strict standards. The superior quality of NIKKOR lenses that fully satisfies users is ensured with the highest quality designs and manufacturing, as well as very strict final inspection.
