        "text": "At Koshien Stadium the photographers' seats are situated next to the center-field back screen so as to enable news photographers to shoot the home plate, which is over 130 meters away. From this position it requires a focal length of 1200mm to capture the pitcher, the catcher, and the batter in frame, and a focal length of 1700mm to shoot a full-frame vertical photograph of the batter. In short, the 1200-1700mm was developed for shooting pictures from the photographers' seats at Koshien Stadium.\n\nIn 1980s, a rival company was making a 1200mm f/5.6 super telephoto lens. The newspapers were beginning to switch over to cameras made by this company in order to use the lens in their coverage of baseball at Koshien Stadium.\n\nIn May 1989, Nikon rushed to begin development of its own super telephoto lens for Koshien Stadium. The company resolved to complete the prototype by March 1990, in response to the fervent wishes of the newspapers.\n\n\"In order to complete the prototype by March, we had to complete the blueprints by the preceding July. Time was short. Moreover, we just didn't know where to start,\" says the mechanical designer of the lens.\n\n\"Seeing that we were developing a lens from scratch, it would be pointless if we did not surpass our competitor. The competitor's lens had a built-in teleconverter, which served as the mechanism for switching the focal length between 1200mm and 1700mm. We decided not to use a switching mechanism, and instead selected a zoom mechanism that enabled the photographer to freely adjust the focal length in the 1200mm to 1700mm range. Although the zoom method is more complex (both optically and mechanically), we knew that it would make framing adjustment easier and produce better photographs,\" adds the lens's optical designer.\n\nTelephoto lenses with a tripod collar commonly feature a structure in which the entire lens barrel is rotated in order to change the composition from vertical to horizontal (this is referred to hereafter as the vertical/horizontal rotating mechanism). However, it would require considerable strength to rotate an entire lens barrel that weighed as much as that of the 1200-1700mm. To enable smooth vertical/horizontal rotating, the lens barrel of the 1200-1700mm is divided into front and rear sections, and only the rear section is rotated.\n\nWith the 1200-1700mm, whose front section of lens barrel is fixed, rotating the position of the camera between vertical and horizontal rotates the focus ring. Focus does not change, however, since care is taken in the design of the vertical/horizontal rotating mechanism to ensure that movement in the mechanism does not affect the rotation of the focus ring.\n\nSince all the element lenses are located in the front section of the lens barrel, the focus group, which is used for focusing the image, is located more than 60 cm in front of the camera. However, rather than being adjacent to the focus group, the focus ring is in the rear section of the lens barrel. In other words, the focus group and the focus ring are connected to each other via a mechanical link that is more than 60 cm in length and which bridges the vertical/horizontal rotating mechanism.\n\n\"Focusing is a crucial operation in photography. For this reason, the focus ring was positioned in the rear section of the lens barrel, so as to facilitate its operation by the photographer. Although its mechanical structure was complex, it was highly regarded for its ease of use.\" recounts the mechanical designer.\n\nEach successive lens group along the length of the super telephoto lens further enlarges the image created by the first lens group, and the final image is created on the surface of the film. If the first lens group produces a low-quality image, that poor image will be enlarged and the resulting picture will inevitably be of low quality. The largest lens in the first lens group in the 1200-1700mm has a diameter aperture of 200 mm. In order to obtain high-quality images, the surface of this large-diameter lens had to be polished to a hitherto unprecedented degree of precision. This represented a considerable challenge for Nikon's lens polishers at the time. However, when it was explained to them that the goal was to outdo Nikon's competitor, they naturally buckled down to the task.\n\nAt the assembly stage too, an unprecedented level of precision was required with regard to the camera lenses. Accordingly, at the suggestion of the person in charge of assembly, adjustments were carried out using equipment used to adjust IC steppers and scanners. The technology of IC steppers and scanners—dubbed the \"most precise machines in history\"—was thus applied to the 1200-1700mm. Given the hectic production schedule for IC steppers and scanners, however, the development team was only permitted to use the adjustment equipment for a single day. With no time to spare to redo any of the work, the operation was completed in a highly tense atmosphere.\n\nThe prototype was completed in February 1990. All processes (including the optical design, mechanical design, lens processing, working of the metallic components, assembly, and adjustment) were carried out without any major hitch and trial production was completed in short order. The prototype was then subjected to rigorous testing (including photographic tests), which represented the final stage in the completion of the prototype of the super telephoto lens—the highest-precision Nikon lens at that time."
