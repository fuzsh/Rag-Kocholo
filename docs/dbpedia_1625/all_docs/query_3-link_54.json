        "text": "Press Release\n\nNIKON EXPANDS ACCLAIMED NIKKOR LENS LINEUP WITH THE ADDITION OF THE NEW 18-300MM VR ALL-IN-ONE HIGH POWER SUPER ZOOM LENS AND THE 24-85MM VR LENS\n\nNew Lenses for FX and DX-Format Photographers Include the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR Lens, A High-Power Super Zoom Lens with Astounding 16.7X DX Zoom, and the AF-S NIKKOR 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR lens, A Versatile Everyday Lens for FX Shooters\n\nMELVILLE, N.Y. (June 14, 2012) – Today, Nikon Inc. announced the addition of two new lenses to the legendary NIKKOR lineup, the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR and the AF-S NIKKOR 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR lenses. The new 18-300mm VR lens is a versatile and compact 16.7X all-in-one super zoom DX-format lens, while the new 24-85mm VR lens is an ideal standard zoom for any FX-format photographer. These optics were designed to meet the needs of all types of photographers, from those looking to capture everything from family outings to elusive wildlife and stunning landscapes. The new 18-300mm and 24-85mm lenses deliver the performance and superior image quality that photographers of all levels have come to expect from NIKKOR lenses whether capturing still images or HD videos.\n\nTo capture stunningly sharp images with excellent clarity and color reproduction or HD video that exhibits sharp critical focus with a dramatic depth of field, the new 18-300mm VR and 24-85mm VR lenses will empower photographers with a variety of exclusive core NIKKOR technologies. Both lenses are equipped with Nikon’s Vibration Reduction (VR) II image stabilization system which provides the equivalent of a shutter speed approximately four stops faster. The built-in Vibration Reduction will help photographers create blur-free images and video while shooting handheld and in challenging lighting conditions. Two focus modes, manual-priority autofocus (M/A) and manual focus (M), are easily selected in both lenses as well. When either lens is in manual-priority autofocus (M/A) mode, users will be able to instantly switch from autofocus to manual focus operation by simply rotating the focus ring, even during AF servo operation. Additionally, both lenses feature an internal focusing system, providing fast focus without changing the length of the lens while retaining working distance through the focus range, and Nikon’s Silent Wave Motor (SWM) technology designed to deliver fast, accurate and quiet AF performance. The lenses also boast Nikon’s Super Integrated Coating (SIC) which provides superb color reproduction, color consistency and reduced flaring.\n\n“Whether a pro on assignment, a photo enthusiast or an indie cinematographer, all Nikon users appreciate and rely on the vast selection and reliability of NIKKOR lenses for all of their imaging needs,” said Bo Kajiwara, director of marketing, Nikon Inc. “The new AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm VR and AF-S NIKKOR 24-85mm VR lenses are fully optimized to capture stunning images and videos while meeting the growing needs of photographers of all levels around the world.”\n\nThe NIKKOR 18-300mm VR Lens: Nikon’s Longest Focal Range\n\nBuilding on the popularity and versatility of Nikon’s telephoto zoom lens lineup which includes both the NIKKOR 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 and 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6 VR lenses, the new 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR lens is Nikon’s longest focal range ever, with an astounding 16.7X ultrahigh-ratio zoom range. The DX-format 18-300mm VR lens is surprisingly compact, lightweight and covers a focal range from wide-angle 18mm to super-telephoto 300mm, equivalent to a focal length of 27mm to 450mm in FX/35mm format. At the 300mm focal length setting, the lens’ large f/5.6 aperture enables photographers to shoot at faster shutter speeds with shallow depth-of-field. This new super telephoto zoom lens is ideal for taking stills when travelling and for all around general photography including landscapes, portraits and distant subjects. The 18-300mm lens is also excellent for recording HD video as it can be used for wide establishing shots, medium close-up shots and extreme telephoto sequences when the users want to separate the subject from the background.\n\nThe construction of the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR lens consists of 19 optical elements in 14 groups with three Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass elements that effectively minimize chromatic aberration, even at the widest aperture settings, and three aspherical lens elements that virtually eliminate aberrations at wide aperture settings. The new lens also incorporates a nine rounded blade diaphragm to help achieve a natural looking dramatic separation between subject and background.\n\nThe AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR also has a dedicated zoom lock switch which secures the lens barrel at its minimum length and will prevent the lens from sliding during transportation. Additionally, the 18-300mm VR lens is ideal for capturing close-ups with great detail, as it offers a 1.48 ft. minimum focusing distance at 300mm, as well as a maximum reproduction ratio of 1:3.2X.\n\nThe NIKKOR 24-85mm VR Lens: The Standard Zoom for FX Shooters\n\nIdeal for photographers seeking an FX-format compatible standard zoom lens, the new AF-S NIKKOR 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR lens delivers sharp, crisp and high-quality images and can be assigned as an everyday walkabout lens. Covering the frequently used focal-length range of 24mm to 85mm, this lens is a great companion for any FX-format shooter and is ideal for shooting stills of landscapes, architecture, head and shoulder portraits, candid shots or group shots. For HD video shooters, the 24-85mm VR lens is a natural choice when filming landscapes, large groups of people or when wide field establishing shots or medium close-ups are needed. The 24-85mm lens is a great everyday lens that is compact, lightweight and easy to carry on any photo assignment or family adventure.\n\nIn addition to the lens’ built-in Vibration Reduction (VR) technology, the AF-S NIKKOR 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR lens features Auto Tripod detection which recognizes when the camera is mounted on a tripod, even during HD video recording, to help deliver specialized VR correction. The lens construction of the 24-85mm VR lens consists of 16 optical elements in 11 groups with one Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass element, three aspherical lens elements and a seven rounded blade diaphragm.\n\nPrice and Availability The AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR lens will be available at the end of June 2012 for the suggested retail price (SRP) of $999.95*. The AF-S NIKKOR 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR lens will also be available at the end of June 2012 and will have a suggested retail price (SRP) of $599.95*.

NIKKOR is the brand name for Nikon’s photographic lenses, which are precision crafted to the most exacting standards in Nikon’s own glassworks. In 1933, Nikon marketed its first camera lens under the NIKKOR brand name, the \"Aero-NIKKOR” for aerial photography applications. Since then, NIKKOR has been used as a brand name for Nikon’s lenses that symbolizes durability, high image quality and optical excellence.\n\nAbout Nikon\n\nNikon, At the Heart of the Image™.

Actual prices are set by dealers and are subject to change at any time. Specifications, equipment and release dates are subject to change without any notice or obligation on the part of the manufacturer.\n\nTOTAL PRODUCTION OF NIKKOR LENSES FOR INTERCHANGEABLE LENS CAMERAS REACHES SEVENTY MILLION\n\nMELVILLE, N.Y. (June 14, 2012) – Nikon Corporation is pleased to announce that total production of NIKKOR lenses for Nikon SLR cameras and Nikon 1 advanced cameras with interchangeable-lens reached seventy million at the end of May 2012. Moreover, total production of AF-S lenses equipped with the Silent Wave Motor (SWM), the autofocus motor developed by Nikon, has reached thirty million.\n\nSeventy Million NIKKOR Lenses\n\nIn 1933, the large-format lens for aerial photography was released as the first NIKKOR lens. After that, lenses for SLR cameras continued to evolve based on Nikon's own cutting-edge technology. Last year, the new Nikon 1 advanced cameras with interchangeable lenses and the 1 NIKKOR line of dedicated lenses were released to the market. The 1 NIKKOR lenses, which are incredibly compact and lightweight, have inherited all of the optical technology, superior quality, and advanced technology Nikon has cultivated over the years to provide sharp rendering with both still photos and movies. Additionally, the retractable lens mechanisms found in these 1 NIKKOR lenses enable the Nikon 1 cameras to be supremely compact and lightweight.\n\nIn October 2011, the production of NIKKOR lenses reached 65 million. Since then, Nikon has continued to actively develop new products under the NIKKOR brand including four 1 NIKKOR lenses with simple designs and various color offerings which are perfectly suited for the ultra-portable, compact and lightweight Nikon 1 J1 and Nikon 1 V1, the first two cameras in the new Nikon 1 series. Additionally, the new FX-format compatible NIKKOR lenses maximize the potential of high-performance cameras such as Nikon's new flagship digital-SLR camera, the Nikon D4, as well the new Nikon D800 and Nikon D800E which are equipped with image sensors with an effective pixel count of 36.3-million pixels for incredible definition and image quality.\n\nThirty Million Silent Wave Motion-Equipped NIKKOR Lenses\n\nThe Silent Wave Motor (SWM) is an ultrasonic autofocus motor developed by Nikon. Nikon’s SWM converts “traveling waves” into rotational energy to focus the optics in the lenses. This enables extremely smooth, quiet and comfortable autofocusing. The Ai AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/2.8D IF-ED, released in 1996, was among the first lenses which Nikon adopted the SWM. Since then, the SWM has been built into a total of 58* different lenses of all types including ultra wide-angle lenses, super telephoto DX and FX-format lenses, zoom lenses, and even Micro lenses. It has been adopted by more than ninety percent of NIKKOR lenses currently manufactured.\n\nNIKKOR lenses are used by a wide variety of photographers, from those new to digital-SLR photography to seasoned professionals.\n\nAbout NIKKOR\n\nThe brand name for Nikon lenses, NIKKOR has become synonymous with high-performance, high-quality SLR lenses. The NIKKOR name comes from adding \"R\"—a common practice in the naming of photographic lenses at the time the name was established—to \"Nikko\", the Romanized abbreviation for Nippon Kogaku K.K. In 1933, the large-format lens for aerial photography was released with the name Aero-Nikkor.\n\nNIKKOR lenses incorporate optical technologies that are always ahead of the times. The OP Fisheye-Nikkor 10mm f/5.6 fisheye lens for SLR cameras, released in 1968, was the world's first lens to incorporate aspherical lens elements. The Ultra Micro-Nikkor 105mm f/2.8 released in 1962 served as the template for projection lenses employed in Nikon IC steppers and scanners that currently boast the world’s highest level of resolution. What’s more, NIKKOR lenses for the latest SLR cameras utilize a number of cutting-edge technologies that originated with the development of IC steppers and scanners, including Nano Crystal Coat, which virtually eliminates internal lens element reflections across a wide range of wavelengths.\n\nFrom initial design and development, production and quality is controlled in accordance with Nikon’s strict standards. The superior quality of NIKKOR lenses that fully satisfies users is ensured with the highest quality designs and manufacturing, as well as very strict final inspection.\n\nThe current NIKKOR brand offers a rich lineup of more than 70 lenses, including fisheye lenses, super wide-angle to super telephoto lenses, zoom lenses, Micro lenses, and PC-E lenses.\n\nAbout Nikon\n\nNikon, At the Heart of the Image™.
