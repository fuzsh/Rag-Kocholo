        "text": "I thought this was a known fact. Anyway -- Mitsubishi does not \"own\" Nikon. All Mitsubishi group companies are separate and independent business units with separate funds.\n\nIn other words -- being a part of Mitsubishi does not make any difference to how much money Nikon can spend on R&D.\n\nIt's a public company traded on the Tokyo stock exchange (#7731) -- their stock has appreciated ~35% over the last 12 months. Their being public is why we can see their financials each quarter. Their web site lists two Mitsubishi entities owning about 6%, though there could be more smaller holders.\n\nhttp://www.nikon.co.jp/main/eng/portfolio/ir/stock_info/status.htm\n\nBtw, I wouldn't call them small. For LTM ended Mar 31 '05, they did almost $6B of revenue with almost $500m of EBITDA. That's up from $4.9B of Rev and $240m revenue the year before. Double the EBITDA on 25% revenue growth - a great margin improvement. $3.3B of their revenue was from their cameras. Btw, the real turnaround came in the Precision Stepper unit: from their annual report:\n\n* Precision equipment: Sales rose 35.6% to ?214,326 million due to growth in sales of IC and LCD steppers. Operating income improved substantially, recovering to ?11,387 million from a prior-year loss of ?20,806 million.\n\n* Imaging products: Strong sales of the Nikon D70 digital SLR camera lifted total sales, which increased 24.9% to ?355,489 million, but savage price erosion in the digital compact sector squeezed overall margins, resulting in a 33.2% year-on-year fall in operating income to ?16,841 million.\n\nFWIW, Canon did $30B or Rev LTM, $7.5 of which was Cameras -- a much smaller proportion of a much bigger pie for the camera line. Their EBITDA margin was twice that of Nikon as well -- important for cash to reinvest into the business.\n\nYeah, the issue of Nikon being a part of the \"Mitsubishi group\" has come up in some unusual ways over the years. About twenty years ago an environmental group called The Rainforest Action Network called for a boycott of Mitsubishi because of \"its\" rapacious exploitation of rain forests (for lumber) in southeast asia, among other things. One of the brand names that was supposed to be boycotted was Nikon.\n\nI consider myself an ardent environmentalist, but this seemed unfair to me, an overly blunt tactic at best. The nature of the Mitsubishi group is that of a loosely-knit network of companies. It seemed that to try to punish the Nikon people for what the Mitsubishi forest-exploitation companies were doing was not only unfair to Nikon, but to its longtime customers who should not have been considered traitors to the environment because they appreciated Nikon camera gear. I got into a few heated \"discussions\" with RAN representatives over this issue, and eventually stopped supporting the organization.\n\nI think Japan Trusty Trust is some sort of fund for US-based pension. Trusty Trust owns share in wide range of Japanese companies.<br>\n\nBut I think the link of Nikon to Mitsubishi is really overblown. The largest Mitsubishi name there is Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, but that bank was created through the merger of Tokyo bank and Mitsubishi bank, so it's rather dilluted. In addition, BTM is merging with another bank, UFJ, in October so it'll be dilluted furthur. After this merger, their biggest customer I think, is supposed to be Toyota.<br>\n\nMaybe there are still old Mitsubishi stalwarts in the boardroom, but I've read that there are ex-Canon people there as well, so it seems Nikon is moving away from the Mitsubishi connection.<br>"
