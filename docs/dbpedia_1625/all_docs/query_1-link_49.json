        "text": "SINGAPORE – Nikon Singapore Pte. Ltd. introduces the NIKKOR Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR, the everyday lens partner that is new to the ever-expanding NIKKOR Z line-up. Designed to inspire a diverse range of creative expressions, the latest APS-C size/DX-format lens is optimised to capture both stills and video in a compact design.\n\n“The NIKKOR Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR is developed with creators in mind. Encased in a compact body, this lightweight ultrawide-angle lens enables users to capture a range of subjects from cityscapes to everyday portraits and vlogs.” said John Young, General Manager of International Marketing, International Business Division of the Imaging Group, Nikon Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\nGo from ideation to creation in a snap with the NIKKOR Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR. It is the first NIKKOR Z lens equipped with power zoom with linear drive – supporting a remote-control operation, minimal operational sound disruption, and features an internal zoom mechanism that does not shift its centre of gravity. Users can maintain a stable balance even when shooting with a camera attached to a compatible tripod grip or a gimbal. In addition, enjoy shooting videos with silent operation, a plus in quiet locations or when befriending a famous street cat.\n\nCustomise the shooting experience by choosing preferred zoom options without having to touch the lens itself. Activate power zoom directly from the dedicated button1 on the camera body, or with the ML-L7 Remote Control enabled with Bluetooth connection. Users can also remotely activate power zoom with Nikon’s PC software2 and compatible smart devices app3.\n\nFor a more tactile yet smooth experience, rotate the zoom ring to enable power zooming automatically and adjust the zoom position according to its rotation angle. Zooming in and out is made easy with the zoom speed setting in 11 steps. In addition, power zoom works well even when shooting with the MC-N10 remote grip and gimbal.\n\nFocus on nailing consistent footage while the lens takes care of accidental shaking and vibration. Enjoy the freedom to capture sharp and clear stills and videos, even in low-light situations such as during sunsets, with a Vibration Reduction (VR) effect of up to 4.5 stops4. Take the stress out of capturing fast-moving subjects when you pair the NIKKOR Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR with the Z 30, Z fc or Z 50, and use SPORT mode to enhance VR effect and achieve stable footage.\n\nWhether capturing the everyday magic of moments, expressive selfies, or dynamic landscapes, the NIKKOR Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR lets you go wide and get creative with ease, thanks to its focal length range of 12-28 mm (equivalent to 18-42 mm when converted to 35mm format). Users won’t have to worry about carrying multiple lenses as this lens allows for various expressions, from ultrawide shots emphasising perspective to portraits with dreamy bokeh. Produce brighter stills and videos with its wide zoom range as the high flexibility of the Z system’s design allows the lens to capture more light.\n\nUsers who enjoy capturing close-up shots of nature such as flowers and insects, and tabletop photos featuring food, products, or jewellery, can get close to their subjects with the lens’ maximum reproduction ratio of 0.21x and a minimum reproduction ratio of 0.19m.\n\nSmall in size but comprehensive on features, the NIKKOR Z DX 12-28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR weighs approximately 205g, an ideal everyday companion for users. Compact enough to fit in a purse or bag and easy to carry around, it is ready to capture whenever inspiration strikes.\n\nFurthermore, its dust-and-drip resistant5 design helps to prevent dust and liquid from entering the lens. Users can also focus on their subject in frame and quickly adjust to their preferred setting with the lens’ control ring to set frequently used functions such as focus (M/A), ISO sensitivity, aperture, or exposure compensation. Rounding off the elegant look of the lens is the distinctive design of the zoom ring and control ring thereby setting them apart to enable smooth operation."
