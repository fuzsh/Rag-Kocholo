I had also read that Nikon had fixed the SnapBridge app. I spent hours trying to get it to work to no avail. First, the camera and phone would not sync. Eventually I got the devices to sync but this appears to be a fluke, since I did not do anything different. Next, the app would not automatically upload any photos; rather, I had to manually select them. Finally, there are problems with the WiFi/Bluetooth function...my camera automatically turns one off the moment I turn the other one on. When I finally got the required WiFi to work, it turned off every time I received a text message or opened any other app on my phone (even though SnapBridge was still running). My friend, who owns a Samsung phone, tried to help me, but she confirmed I had done everything right and that while the app worked on her phone, it did not work on mine. On a whim, I decided to read some reviews of the app, and it appears that some other reviewers have had the same exact problems. A few mentioned that they had iPhones and were using the latest software. I am also using an iPhone with the latest update, so I wonder if it is a software compatibility issue. Please create an update so this app works on iPhones! Iâm so disappointed that I canât use my new camera and Iâm sure others feel the same!"
