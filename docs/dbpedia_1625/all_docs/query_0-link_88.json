        "text": "Today, Nikon Corporation announced the development of three new lenses for the Nikon 1 Advanced Camera with Interchangeable Lens System. These lenses will be welcomed additions to the current lineup of popular 1 NIKKOR lenses, and will provide system owners a breadth of new NIKKOR optics to explore new shooting perspectives.\n\nThe development of these new 1 NIKKOR lenses will strengthen Nikon’s lineup of 1 NIKKOR lenses while providing three new options to fit the various shooting needs of Nikon 1 users, whether for still images or HD video. The new lineup will include a 32mm medium-telephoto fixed focal length lens (equivalent to 86.4mm in 35mm format) with a fast maximum aperture of f/1.2, ideal for portraits and creating a bokeh effect. The second lens is a 6.7-13mm f/3.5-5.6 ultra wide-angle zoom lens (equivalent to 18-35mm in 35mm format) that includes Vibration Reduction (VR) and is the first 1 NIKKOR lens to offer a wide, 100-degree angle of view. The third lens is a compact and lightweight 10x zoom lens, a 10-100mm f/4-5.6 (equivalent to 27-270mm in 35mm format). This lens is convenient and portable enough to take everywhere, including weekend getaways and family vacations.\n\nThe 1 NIKKOR interchangeable lens lineup follows in the tradition of the renowned Nikon F-mount lenses that were first introduced more than half a century ago. The 1 NIKKOR lenses are specifically engineered for the Nikon 1 system of cameras and are developed using optical technologies that Nikon has cultivated with years of experience in optics expertise. The 1 NIKKOR lens lineup offers the same superior image quality that users have come to expect from the Nikon and NIKKOR brands, whether capturing still images or HD videos.\n\nThe addition of the three new lenses will join the six 1 NIKKOR lenses currently available:\n\n1 NIKKOR VR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 standard zoom lens\n\n1 NIKKOR VR 30-110mm f/3.8-5.6 compact telephoto zoom lens\n\n1 NIKKOR 10mm f/2.8 slim wide-angle fixed focal length lens\n\n1 NIKKOR VR 10-100mm f/4.5-5.6 PD-ZOOM lens equipped with a power drive mechanism (recommended for movie recording )\n\n1 NIKKOR 11-27.5mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom lens\n\n1 NIKKOR 18.5mm f/1.8 fixed focal length lens with fast maximum aperture\n\nNikon will continue to develop and expand the 1 NIKKOR lineup with lenses that make the most of the capabilities and performance offered by the revolutionary Nikon 1 system.\n\nAbout the NIKKOR brand With a comprehensive assortment of FX and DX-format lenses and focal lengths, from the ultra-wide 10-24mm to the super telephoto 600mm VR, Nikon photographers have come to rely upon the NIKKOR core technologies that contribute to their optical superiority. NIKKOR is the brand name for Nikon’s photographic lenses, which are precision crafted to the most exacting standards in Nikon’s own glassworks. In 1933, Nikon marketed its first camera lens under the NIKKOR brand name, the \"Aero-NIKKOR” for aerial photography applications. Since then, NIKKOR has been used as a brand name for Nikon’s lenses that symbolizes durability, high image quality and optical excellence.\n\nAbout Nikon\n\nNikon, At the Heart of the Image™.
