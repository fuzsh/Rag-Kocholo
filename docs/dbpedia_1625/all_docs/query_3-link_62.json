These individuals are avid Nikon Z mirrorless camera system users, and each represent where the industry is headed. This program aims to support and amplify the creative community, partnering with artists who are defining visual storytelling while documenting their distinctive process.\n\nThe diverse group of nine artists are social-savvy and exemplify a wide range of photo and video disciplines. This emerging generation of creators came up in a different era, blazing their own path in non-traditional ways, which Nikon actively embraces. The primary role of these Nikon Creators Official Partners is to elevate those around them, whether engaging the large communities they have built or inspiring their peers with their process of creating spectacular content.\n\n\"The creative landscape and the artists driving it are evolving faster than ever before. The Nikon Creators Official Partners is a unique program connecting the brand with a new generation of visual storytellers while providing them with the tools they need to tell their stories and push their creative boundaries,\" said Naoki Onozato, President and CEO, Nikon Inc. \"Our partners continue to redefine what it means to be a creator, and we are excited to support them in their creative journey.\"\n\nAbout the Nikon Creators Official Partners\n\nNikon plans to support these creators by helping to bring their unique visions to life and developing a brand relationship with the freedom to create what moves them, all while using Nikon's gear, resources and extensive educational platforms. This experience is a blank canvas, where they can teach what they love and create without boundaries. This is a generation that is no stranger to making a statement with cutting-edge technology and is always looking for ways to adapt their craft. Nikon Creators Official Partners will exist alongside the world's foremost professionals in Nikon's prestigious Ambassador program, producing content and driving engagement that reflects the unique needs of the creator community.\n\n\"It feels like a dream come true to become a Nikon Creators Official Partner,\" said Brandon Woelfel. \"Photography isn't just my full-time job; it's become a core part of who I am. The first camera that jump-started my photography journey was my grandfather's Nikon film camera, and I've never looked back since. The brand has truly evolved with me, offering quality and innovation that I can rely on to bring my visions to life. It's also about the community I've found among other Nikon users and the Nikon team. They've always supported me and my art throughout my journey, and I'll forever be grateful for the connection we've made.\"\n\nMeet the Nikon Creators Official Partners\n\nAlex Frank / @shotzbyAlex\n\nAlex is a fashion & lifestyle photographer and content creator that creates campaigns and portraits that can convey an entire state of mind in a single frame, by masterful use of warm tones, light and pose.
