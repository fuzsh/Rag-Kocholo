With an open F-value of 1.4, this wide-angle single focus lens realizes an easy-to-reach price. It can be easily enjoyed with soft expression utilizing a large bokeh and a stereoscopic representation to make the subject stand out. With a wide-angle 35mm angle of view, it is possible to shoot a wide range of scenes and subjects, such as landscapes, snaps, people, flowers, and pets only with this lens. Taking advantage of the shortest shooting distance of 0.27m, it is possible to take pictures of subjects such as cuisine and flowers by getting close and emphasizing the main subject by greatly blurring the background. Although it has an open F-value of 1.4, the total length is about 86.5mm and the weight is about 415g, which makes it a similar size to the NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.8 S (released in September 2018) and easy to use for everyday use, and allows you to quickly take pictures when you go out. In addition, NIKKOR Z lens provides high optical performance, making it possible to create clear expressions with little coloration and good separation. Bokeh is soft around the face in close-up human photography shot at maximum aperture, and eyelashes have sharp expressions. By narrowing down the focus on landscape photography, sharp expressions can be obtained, which allows for arranged expressions according to the intention of the photographer.
