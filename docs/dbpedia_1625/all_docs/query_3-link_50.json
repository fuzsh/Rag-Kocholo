        "text": "JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA – Setting new benchmarks, Nikon in South Africa, is pleased to introduce its addition to the S-Line range, the NIKKOR Z 58mm f/0.95 S Noct. This Noct lens offers the highest rendering performance in NIKKOR lenses to produce meticulous point-image reproduction, impeccable high-resolving power, crisp details, and beautiful bokeh, all of which allow users to enjoy shooting at a maximum aperture of f/0.95.\n\nThis lens inherits the finest design and high precision feel of the renowned Noct lenses from Nikon. Featuring exceptional optical performance that embodies Nikon’s wealth of optical expertise and complementing the Z mount’s large inner diameter of 55mm and short flange distance of 16mm, the lens brings out the beauty of portraits and the brightness of the stars in astrophotography. Exceptionally sharp resolution and clear rendering is realised even at the maximum aperture of f/0.95.\n\n“The state-of-the-art NIKKOR Z 58mm f/0.95 S Noct delivers ground-breaking optical performance along with superior functionality that is designed to exceed expectations with the Z mount. A testament to delivering ultimate optical performance thanks to the largest mount diameter in the industry, this new Noct is perfect for those who want to experience unprecedented imaging expression,” said Grant Norton, CEO of Premium Brand Distributors for Nikon in South Africa.\n\nLatest Optical Technology for the Highest-Class S-Line model\n\nWith the newly adopted ground aspherical lens element, a higher surface accuracy and improved flexibility in material selection is achieved to result in ultimate optical performance and excellent minimisation of various optical imperfections including distortion and spherical aberration. For clarity with almost inexistent ghost and flare effects, the employment of the ARNEO Coat realises ultra-clear and crisp images. In an ideal synergy between technologies, the ARNEO Coat works with the Nano Crystal Coat to effectively minimise reflection over the entire visible light range. This lens construction is crafted to deliver a bright lens with its structure that seeks to receive as much light as possible with remarkably improved compensation capability of many common aberrations.\n\nFine Craftmanship and Superb Operability with High-Precision Feel\n\nFrom its build to its technology, every component has been thoroughly thought of. This magnificent Noct lens, featuring a stunning exterior design that is finished with metallic material machined from a metal ingot, also comes with a hood that has felt-lined on the inside which helps to further prevent light reflection.\n\nFor absolute ease in functionality, the lens information panel enables instant confirmation of aperture, focus distance and depth of field even in dimly lit environments. The number of functions that can be assigned to the lens Fn button has been increased to match those of the Fn1/Fn2 buttons on the camera body.\n\nDelivering stable autoexposure, the electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism within the lens accurately controls the electronic signals from the camera. A highly precise focus ring facilitates focusing with the appropriate amount of torque and a large angle of rotation even with the maximum aperture of f/0.95. Comfortable shooting operation of stills and movies is also ensured with the newly adopted control ring to which selected functions can be assigned. The same control ring also minimises noise caused by changes of settings so a silent and smooth capture on video in particular is made possible.\n\nCompleting the design of the lens is the superior anti-fouling performance ensured with Nikon’s fluorine coat that is applied to the front lens element, effectively repelling dust and dirt even when it adheres to the lens surface. A dust- and drip-resistant performance rounds up the lens’ perfection."
