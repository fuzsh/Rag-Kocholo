        "text": "In the early 1970s, there was the disc camera, which thrived awhile, then died.\n\nMore recently, photo CDs had their 15 minutes of fame on the consumer stage before being relegated to the chorus line of mostly commercial use.\n\nNow, Eastman Kodak Co. is betting a bundle on the success of the Advanced Photo System, a collaborative effort with Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Canon Inc., Minolta Camera Co. Ltd. and Nikon Corp. The fivesome, in the words of Kodak CEO George Fisher, is “reinventing consumer photography.”\n\nKodak’s much ballyhooed new Advantix line of cameras and film were introduced Wednesday at midnight in simultaneous events held in Rochester, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo. Advantix features nine new cameras and three new films.\n\nThese products, as well as APS processing equipment, will be introduced in the U.S. market beginning April 22.\n\n“I would expect the product to be quickly available after that,” said Charles Brown, a vice president at Kodak and chief operating officer of its Consumer Imaging division.\n\nAPS’ spectacular debut Wednesday in Los Angeles, with Fisher appearing with actress Jamie Lee Curtis on stage at the Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts and Sciences, conjured up visions of the eagerly anticipated arrival of Microsoft Corp.’s Windows 95 last August.\n\nEstimates were that the new software would sell 30 million units by the end of 1995, but the Wall Street Journal reported the year-end count was more like 18 million.\n\nBrown does not see a similar scenario with APS.\n\n“The thing that makes us confident is that we utilized over 20,000 customers in 11 different countries to help design the system,” he said.\n\nIndeed, perhaps because of lessons learned with its failed disc camera, Kodak approached this attempt to expand its consumer-imaging business from a new angle. Instead of introducing a product and hoping it is what the public wants, Kodak asked what consumers wanted, then came back to Rochester and built it.\n\nBrown said the company performed the extensive market research to determine what consumers liked and disliked about photography. The buyers’ collective bottom line was a photographic system that is more user-friendly.\n\nAmong the features of Advantix and APS are: drop-in loading of film cassettes; improved print quality; three print sizes that consumers can select; no handling of negatives; more portable cameras because the film is smaller than 35mm film; mid-roll changing of partially exposed film cassettes; a photo file index print to facilitate ordering of reprints and enlargements; and automatic recording of the frame number, film cassette number and date on each print.\n\nAdvantix’s suggested retail prices will start at less than $20 for a single-use camera and $99 for the low-end model, “but I expect in some places it will be discounted below that price,” Brown predicted.\n\nThe highest-priced camera that will available after April 22 will retail for slightly more than $200, but Brown said the top-of-the-line model with auto-focus and a 4x zoom lens will not be available until later in the year “and at this time we’re not talking about suggested retail.”\n\nHigh-end system cameras magnetically record lighting and scene information on each frame of film and during photo finishing the printing equipment reads the digital data and automatically adjusts to maximize print quality. Kodak reportedly has invested $300,000 in APS. Brown, sticking to company policy, would not speculate on how much Kodak might reap from APS.\n\n“We obviously have a lot of confidence in the APS system,” he said. “We’ve invested a lot of effort, monetary as well as human resources, and we see it adding to our growth in a significant way.”\n\nFor that to happen, consumers–including many who have been lifetime loyal to 35mm photography–must buy the Advantix products. And the APS system must catch on among film processors.\n\nSome observers question whether either will happen at a pace Kodak will be comfortable with.\n\n“I don’t think people are going to throw away their 35s,” said Robert Kayser, associate professor in the School of Photographic Arts and Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology. “And I read that the price to convert existing equipment to handle APS is $41,000 for a mini-lab–that’s the processor and the printer.\n\n“If it takes off, I think it could be a detriment to independent processors,” Kayser added. “Fuji has a lot of labs, and so does Kodak. Between the two of them, they have 85 percent of the processing market. The mom-and-pop shops may not be able to keep up.”\n\nBrown said the APS received rave reviews at a trade show this past October in London.\n\n“Well over 50 percent (of attendees) said this is going to be a real boost to our industry and to taking pictures overall,” he said.\n\nKodak says “tens of thousands of retail locations in the U.S.” will be ready to accept APS orders by April 22. Mini-labs, the company adds, will offer processing on-site or by shipping APS film to another location.\n\nKodak analyst Alex Henderson of Prudential Securities Inc. told Business Week “it will displace 35mm eventually, but I don’t think it will change people’s consumption habits.”\n\nChanging people’s consumption habits, however, is precisely what Kodak and the other four companies are counting on. During its consumer research, Kodak offered to send one of the new cameras to any customer who agreed to provide a credit-card number. Brown said 20 percent ordered an APS camera for April shipment. He described that as “real confirmation” that the public is ready for a new photo system.\n\n“We really think that 35mm and the APS will co-exist in the market for an extended period of time,” Brown said, adding that “35mm photography will remain an important part of our business and the photography industry on a worldwide basis for a significant period of time.”\n\nBrown anticipates the versatility and compactness of the new cameras will lure 35mm owners to add an Advantix to their collection.\n\n“For instance, I own a 35mm but I don’t use that camera for all my picture-taking opportunities. One of the things that really is important to enjoy photography is to be camera-ready, and the APS cameras are 15 to 25 percent smaller than comparable cameras.\n\n“There are a lot of things that even the high-end 35mm camera user will say, “That’s really neat, that’s something that will really add to my repertoire in my use of photography.”’\n\n<"
