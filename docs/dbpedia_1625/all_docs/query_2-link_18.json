        "text": "Long Island may be the nation’s camera capital, with firms such as Nikon and Canon basing their U.S. operations here. In addition, Sigma Corp. of America, a privately owned lens, flash and camera maker headquartered in Japan, bases its U.S. operations in Ronkonkoma. We talked with Mark Amir-Hamzeh, Sigma Corp. of America’s general manager, about Long Island’s role in photography and his firm, which employs 1,200 worldwide for $400 million sales.\n\nWhy is so much of the photographic equipment industry based on Long Island?\n\nWe have Canon, Nikon and (camera lens manufacturer) Tamron out here. I attribute that to the fact that most of the major camera dealers are based in New York and the East Coast. That makes a good environment for us to provide service and attention to most of these major accounts. The majority of the larger dealers are based here with the exception of Amazon. More business is being done through the Internet, so it’s becoming a borderless sales territory.\n\nHow do you differentiate yourself from companies such as Nikon, Canon and Olympus?\n\nThey’re spending a lot more on marketing campaigns and sponsorships. They have a larger budget for advertising and promotions. Sigma is still a family-owned company. Our philosophy has always been to offer the best value and highest quality. That’s why our prices tend to be lower than the other major manufacturers like Canon and Nikon.\n\nHow is your company and the photography industry affected by the recession?\n\nObviously, consumers’ discretionary spending has been reduced. Overall, I would say sales were down at most major photography companies. Sigma has fared better. We have been more proactive to ensure our products are well advertised. We increased our advertising through online media and we’re participating in more local photography events.\n\nIs your Long Island and U.S. business growing or shrinking?\n\nIt is growing. Our expanded lens line has captured a bigger market share. For the amount of sales we do, we have a very lean system. Our local office is 24 people. We expanded our staff from 20 since December of last year. And we have outside salespeople who handle sales in different territories.\n\nWas it difficult to shift from film to digital?\n\nIt was a fairly smooth transition. Most of our products can be used on film and digital cameras. And we evolved a whole set of products designed for digital cameras. We do make digital cameras also. One of the things that sets us apart is all of our products are made in Japan. Other manufacturers manufacture products in other countries such as Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nHow has digital photography changed your business – both good and bad?\n\nIt’s been a positive change for our company. There’s a new level of interest by amateurs and professional photographers. Photography has become a feel-good sort of hobby. People use digital photography to capture their feeling and expressions. With the advent of social media and networking, they use photography as a good way to communicate. And there are more affordable cameras.\n\nDo you see another big revolution after digital?\n\nThe trend we see is more and more higher-quality optics, the type of glass being used and the best image quality and optical stabilized technology.\n\nHow important are Internet sales to the photography industry?\n\nMost of our larger dealers, a major portion of their sales is done through the Internet. We have expanded our markets through the Internet by advertising on more photography and photo-related sites.\n\nCan you tell me about your most recent acquisition and why it stands out?\n\nIn 2008, Sigma purchased a digital sensor maker, Foveon. Digital sensors capture the image in digital cameras. What makes Foveon unique is it’s the world’s only sensor that captures full color. Digital camera sensors out there are mosaics. Each pixel captures one primary color. With a Foveon, each pixel captures the three primary colors: red, blue and green. It gives you much better detail and accuracy.\n\nWhat are your hottest products and why?\n\nWe have a wide range of products, more than 50 lenses. We offer some unique wide-angle lenses and all-in-one zoom lenses. We have the ultra-telephoto lens. And we offer the world’s fastest telephoto zoom lens in the world. We have expanded our optical stabilized lenses. That seems to be the segment that seems to be grabbing the most attention. Its image stabilized products that compensate for the camera shake.\n\nWhy doesn’t the company go public?\n\nThat’s something that has been decided by our parent company. Having full control. They have not decided to go public. There have been no discussions."
