        "text": "Qranc\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #1 · p.1 #1 · Nikon corporate structure\n\nThe following link has been brought to my attention because of comments I had made in another thread.\n\nMitsubishi by company\n\nIf you scroll down to the section labelled \"by company\" and go to the last column, look 5 down the list you find Nikon Corp.\n\nFurther I have even seen a Mitsubishi shareholders report making mention of Nikon's strong performance, somehow suggesting association.\n\nWell enough, we can argue that Mitsubishi \"owns\" Nikon, they have a considerable investment in the form of shares. Secondly there is long history, they go way back.\n\nThe Nikon story began on 25th July 1917 when, with the support of the Japanese industrial giant, Mitsubishi Group, and the Imperial Japanese Navy a new company called 'Nippon Kogaku K.K.' was formed.\n\nTo be labelled as part of a group or somehow suggest Nikon is owned by Mitsubishi is odd. Nikon is a publicly traded Corporation and as such shareholders \"own\" the corporation with the board being responsible for decisions and to the shareholders.\n\nDiscussing vague notions of ownership or controlling interest is pointless but I did want to put the facts out as clearly as possible. Does Mitsubishi own Nikon? In a sense yes. Is Nikon a Mitsubishi group company ... well I suppose so, I have yet to see the connection other than the Mitsubishi references. There is the Nikon reference to Mitsubishi help in it's Corporate history. Does Mitsubishi or any of it's divisions have a controlling ineterest in Nikon?\n\nIf you go through the list you will find various other companies in exactly the same boat. My guess is (it's a guess) any company Mitsubishi has a history with, any company Mitsubishi has a substantial investment in is considered part of the group. I have yet to see any documentation to suggest that Nikon Corp is anything but it's own corporate entity.\n\nI asked for proof of Mitsubishi owning Nikon Corp. This is what was supplied to me as such. So there it is.\n\nQranc\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.1 #4 · p.1 #4 · Nikon corporate structure\n\nYes that is correct and I also linked the 2005 shareholder info before.\n\nRead the footnotes and you will find two holders of the top ten financials were Mitsu financials that merged and together they comprise a total of 5.7% as at Sept. 2005.\n\nOf total shares, Japanese financials hold just over 47% with the rest of the pie being sliced up amongst other corps, Intl Corps etc.\n\nI have received all sorts of pm's giving me examples of how this company bought another company and kept the name etc etc. I am not interested in that, in fact that info is easily accessible about mergers, acquisitions and so on. All I simply am asking, those that say Mitsubishi owns Nikon, show me the evidence.\n\nAs Stubbly has pointed out we know who the shareholders are, being publicly traded it's public information! You cannot \"buy\" a publicly traded company, it doesn't work that way.\n\nShow me the evidence, build a case if you have to I don't care.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I really wouldn't even care if it was true that Mitsubishi owned Nikon. *shrug ... so what? I merely am challenging those that keep using that fact as some sort taboo to actually provide some proof.\n\nAnyone?"
