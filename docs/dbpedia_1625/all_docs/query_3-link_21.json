        "text": "Nikon is a Japanese company specializing in optics and imaging. Its full name is Nikon Corporation (㈱ニコン, Kabushiki Kaisha Nikon) since 1988. February 29, 2012\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe company was founded in 1917 as Nippon Kōgaku Kōgyō K.K. (日本光学工業㈱) with the merger of two Japanese optical firms with military connections. The company's first camera lenses were designed in the 1920s by Heinrich Acht, who was invited with a team of German engineers (see Nippon Kōgaku lenses before 1945). After the departure of Acht, the lens design department was taken over by Sunayama Kakuya (砂山角野). The first lens mounted on a camera for civil use was the Anytar 12cm f/4.5 made in the early 1930s, renamed Nikkor in 1932. From 1934, the company supplied lenses to Seiki Kōgaku for the early Canon cameras.\n\nDuring World War II the company expanded significantly, supplying optical equipment to the Japanese military, including various aerial cameras.[1]\n\nAfter the war, Nippon Kōgaku decided to produce cameras for civil use, and two projects were started: a 6×6cm TLR and a 35mm rangefinder camera. The TLR, called Nikoflex, was shelved because of problems to find an adequate leaf shutter. The rangefinder camera was inspired by the German Contax and Leica. It is said that various names were considered, including Pentax, Nicca or Nikorette.[2] It was finally released as the Nikon in 1948. The Nikon I proved very successful, and was followed by a long line of rangefinder cameras. In parallel, the company produced a range of Nikkor lenses both in Leica mount and for its own rangefinder cameras. The quality of these lenses attracted the attention of many professional photographers and photojournalists desiring better results from the small 35mm format.\n\nIn 1959, Nippon Kōgaku introduced the Nikon F, an advanced mechanical single lens reflex (SLR) camera that proved to be extraordinarily durable and reliable. With the F, Nikon introduced its philosophy of high-quality, low-friction, close-tolerance mechanisms requiring less lubricant than other cameras.source needed This workmanship had a practical side, as Nikons have accompanied more photographers to extreme environments — from the summit of Mount Everest to the depths of the Saharan Desert — than any other SLR camera. The F became an overnight success with many professional and serious amateur photographers, and spawned a succession of popular Nikon 35mm film cameras, culminating with the Nikon F6.\n\nIn 1983 Nikon launched the Nikon F3AF, a professional SLR with autofocus together with the autofocus lenses AF 80mm f2.8 and AF 200mm f3.5 ED-IF, a fast portrait lens and a fast tele lens since the camera was designed as kind of press camera. Both lenses had internal AF motors and worked on a slightly modified F-lenses bayonet, thus enabling the usage of manual focusing lenses on the autofocus camera body.\n\nIn the mid 1990s Nikon made its first DSLRs, the E-series, expensive cameras producing low image resolution. In the late 1990s, Nikon introduced its consumer line digital photography products with both the Coolpix line of consumer and \"prosumer\" cameras as well as the Nikon D-series (DSLRs).\n\nIn 2003 the company owned Photonics Technology Group which developed an own kind of image sensors (LBCAST-technology instead of common CCD or CMOS chip-architecture). In 2008 Nikon returned to conventional sensortypes with its FX-format CMOS sensor (FX-Format=35mm film frame-format) which it applied in its Nikon D3 DSLR.\n\nDigital[]\n\nFixed Lens All Nikon's compact digital cameras with fixed lenses are branded with the Coolpix trademark and are listed together.\n\n35mm film[]\n\nAuto Focus SLR[]\n\nNikon F100 - 1999\n\nNikon F3AF - 1983\n\nNikon F4 - 1988\n\nNikon F4e - 1991\n\nNikon F4P\n\nNikon F4s - 1988\n\nNikon F5 - 1996\n\nNikon F6 - 2004\n\nNikon N2020 (F501) - 1986\n\nNikon N4004 (F401) - 1987\n\nNikon N4004S (F401S) - 1989\n\nNikon N50 (F50) - 1994\n\nNikon N5005 (F401X) - 1991\n\nNikon N55 (F55) - 2002\n\nNikon N6006 (F601) - 1990\n\nNikon N60 (F60) - 1999\n\nNikon N65 (F65) - 2000\n\nNikon N70 (F70) - 1994\n\nNikon N75 (F75) - 2003\n\nNikon N80 (F80) - 2000\n\nNikon N8008 (F801) - 1988\n\nNikon N8008S (F801S) - 1991\n\nNikon N90 (F90) - 1990\n\nNikon N90s (F90X) - 1992\n\nManual Focus SLR[]\n\nNikkorex F / Nikkor J - 1962\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat EL - 1972\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat ELW - 1976\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FS - 1965\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FT - 1965\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FTN - 1967\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FT2 - 1975\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FT3 - 1977\n\nNikon EL2 - 1977\n\nNikon EM - 1979\n\nNikon F - 1959\n\nNikon F Photomic - 1962\n\nNikon F Photomic FTn - 1968\n\nNikon F Photomic T - 1965\n\nNikon F Photomic Tn- 1967\n\nNikon F2 - 1971\n\nNikon F2 Photomic - 1971\n\nNikon F2 Photomic A - 1977\n\nNikon F2 Photomic AS - 1977\n\nNikon F2 Photomic S 1973\n\nNikon F2 Photomic SB- 1976\n\nNikon F3 - 1980\n\nNikon F3 HP - 1982\n\nNikon F3 P\n\nNikon F3/T - 1982\n\nNikon FA - 1983\n\nNikon FE - 1978\n\nNikon FE10 - 1996\n\nNikon FE2 - 1983\n\nNikon FG - 1982\n\nNikon FG20 - 1984\n\nNikon FM - 1977\n\nNikon FM10 - 1995\n\nNikon FM2 - 1982\n\nNikon FM2n - 1983\n\nNikon FM2/T - 1994\n\nNikon FM3A - 2001\n\nNikon N2000 (F301) - 1985\n\nNikon N6000 (F601m) - 1990\n\nLeaf shutter SLR[]\n\nNikkorex 35 ( 1960-1962)\n\nNikkorex 35|2 (1962-)\n\nNikkorex Zoom 35 (1963-)\n\nNikkorex Auto 35 / Nikon Auto 35 (1964-)\n\nRangefinder[]\n\nNikon I (1948)\n\nNikon M (1949)\n\nNikon S (1951)\n\nNikon S2 (1954)\n\nNikon SP (1957)\n\nNikon S3 (1958)\n\nNikon S4 (1959)\n\nNikon S3M (1960)\n\nNikon S3 2000 (2000)\n\nNikon SP 2005 (2005)\n\nFixed Lens / Compact[]\n\nAs with other Japanese manufacturers, Nikon's models were given different names in different territories and formed a confusing array of series, some of which lasted several years and crossed over with others.
