        "text": "Nikon Corp. on Wednesday launched the first digital still camera with interchangeable lenses that also shoots movies.\n\nThe D90 single-lens reflex camera, or SLR, takes 12.3 megapixel stills, but can also shoot movies in the high-definition 720p format. It will be available in September for $1,000 without a lens.\n\nSome compact digital still cameras can shoot movies, but only with their built-in lenses. Digital movie cameras also lack interchangeable lenses, except for some high-end professional models.\n\nCompared to a consumer digital movie camera, the D90 will provide extra versatility for a videographer, since different lenses have different looks and applications. The large light-gathering sensor of a still camera also means the camera will work better in low light. However, it captures only mono sound.\n\n— Peter Svensson, Associated Press\n\nA watch James Bond could love\n\nWhile the chunky Suunto X10 might not go well with a tuxedo, James Bond would still love it. The watch hides a Global Positioning System unit, stopwatch, compass, barometer and altimeter into a package not much bigger than 007’s favorite Omega.\n\nBecause the X10 can track GPS satellites, you can record and download your last run or hike to Google Earth or other digital mapping programs. You can also plan routes and set waypoints for future trips on a PC using the included Track Exporter software.\n\nThe X10 offers 33 percent longer battery life than its predecessor, the X9i, and charges via an included USB cable. It also uses a newer GPS chip that finds and locks onto satellites faster than the X9i.\n\nIf you become lost, a press of the \"Find Home\" button will direct you back along the same route you came or even offer a more direct route. The watch also displays current speed and distance traveled.\n\nIt should be available in September, sadly without the garrote or sleeping gas attachments available from Q branch.\n\n— John Biggs, New York Times\n\nPrinter maker offers to help people print less\n\nA leading printer maker wants to help you do less printing.\n\nPrinting an article off the Web often produces several pages of waste, including ads, links and boxes for entering text. So the latest version of a Web toolbar from Lexmark International Inc. gives people more ways to block such images from coming out of the printer, saving ink and paper.\n\nSome of Lexmark’s tools already exist in standard printer settings, but accessing them normally requires several mouse clicks. Lexmark’s free program brings those functions to the forefront. For example, one click converts a Web page into black and white for printing, extending the life of expensive color ink cartridges.\n\nThe Web software also extends the \"printer-friendly\" features many sites offer. Often those printer-friendly versions still carry logos and other graphics; the Lexmark tools let you eliminate those as well.\n\nAlthough printer companies make much of their money from ink cartridges and other products that consumers constantly have to replace, Lexmark figures it can improve customer satisfaction. Most of the features work regardless of whether your printer was made by Lexmark, Hewlett-Packard Co. or another rival.\n\nLexmark has versions available for both Microsoft Corp.’s Internet Explorer and Mozilla’s Firefox browsers.\n\n— Anick Jesdanun, Associated Press\n\nReasonable volumes built into the earbuds\n\nParents have been telling their children to turn the volume down since \"wireless\" meant \"AM radio,\" but noise-monitoring has gotten trickier as music has moved into headphones — where sound levels can get dangerously high. With parental concerns in mind, the LoudEnough earbuds from Ultimate Ears have volume-limiting safeguards built into the hardware.\n\nAlthough safe volume levels are still important, the components in the LoudEnough earbuds also reduce sound-pressure levels up to 20 decibels, or one quarter of the volume of other earphones. They use a standard 3.5-mm stereo plug, which allow the Ultimate Ears to fit just about any portable MP3 player or other audio device.\n\nThe earbuds, available in three colors, sell for about $40 and can be found at www.loudenough.com. Each pair comes with two sets of silicone tips in three sizes (extra-small, small and medium) for keeping the buds in place inside the ears — which may even make them appeal to adults who complain that the iPod earphones are too big and tend to fall out.\n\n— J.D. Biersdorfer, New York Times"
