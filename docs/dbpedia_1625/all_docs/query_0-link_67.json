High shooting performance achieved by the world's first partially stacked CMOS sensor\n\nAdopts the world's first partially stacked CMOS sensor that places a large number of high-speed processing circuits above and below the image sensor. With high-speed reading using this new sensor and the same high-speed image processing engine \"EXPEED 7\" as the \"Z9\" and \"Z8\", it is capable of recording up to one second before pressing the shutter button with \"Pre-capture\"*1 at a maximum of 120 frames per second (C120) and shooting at about 24 megapixels higher than \"Z9\" and \"Z8\" with 60 frames per second (C60). Additionally, during high-speed continuous shooting at 20 frames per second, display delay on the EVF is suppressed and the motion of the subject can be smoothly confirmed, making it easier to capture decisive moments of running wild animals and flying birds, etc.*※JPEG images only.*1\n\n2. 6K video shooting that enhances freedom of video production\n\nBy adopting the new CMOS sensor that enables high-speed reading, it is possible to record 12bit 6K N-RAW/ProRes RAW HQ and 10bit 5.4K ProRes 422/H.265 videos in internal recording, which can also be used as materials for 4K video production. In addition to trimming, zooming, tracking, and blur correction, which increase the freedom of editing, it is possible to create high-definition videos by oversample 4K UHD from 6K, and efficient heat dissipation design and power saving during video shooting are realized even in a small body, making it possible to shoot for up to 125 minutes at 4K UHD/60p.\n\n※1※2It is possible to shoot video. In addition, it enhances the freedom in video production by having high video performance and functions, such as the ability to shoot at 10bit Full HD/240p H.265, and the ability to create impressive slow-motion videos up to 10 times.\n\n*14K UHD/60p/30p/25p/24p, imaging range: compatible with FX only.\n\n*2H.265 8 bit (MOV), extension of oversampling is OFF, automatic power OFF temperature [high], temperature 23°C, uses 'CFexpress Type B Memory Card 660GB MC-CF660G'. External power source such as mobile batteries and 'Power Battery Pack MB-N14' is required. Also, it is 75 minutes in standard mode.\n\nEVF with high brightness, high resolution, and wide color gamut support that allows you to immerse yourself in shooting.\n\nThe EVF has the highest resolution in mirrorless cameras, surpassing the 'Z9' and 'Z8' models.*It supports a brightness of 4000cd/m², achieving a viewfinder image that is easy to see without too much black crushing even in extremely bright outdoor scenes, the highest in Nikon history.2In addition to achieving a high resolution of 5.76 million dots, it covers the color gamut of the digital cinema standard 'DCI-P3', the first in mirrorless cameras. It allows you to confirm the subject in high resolution up to the edge of the screen, suppresses color saturation which is prone to occur with red flower, and you can also check brighter illumination during shooting with HLG.*It is the first in mirrorless cameras to achieve a digital cinema standard 'DCI-P3' equivalent color gamut. *It inherits the performance and reliability of the higher-end models. By combining a stacked CMOS sensor and the same high-speed image processing engine 'EXPEED 7' as the flagship model, it achieves faster AF operation cycles. It also supports 9 subject detections including 'airplanes' mode. Moreover, the AF detection range on the low-light side has been extended to -10EV, surpassing the 'Z9' and 'Z8,' making it easier to focus in darker scenes and expanding the range of shooting. It is equipped with VR lock mechanism to protect the image sensor from inadvertent vibration during movement, and can be used for shooting in various environments thanks to its performance, reliability, and cold resistance up to -10℃. Rich custom settings, dial position design, portrait shooting functions such as 'Rich Tone Portrait', 'Skin Softening', and 'People Impression Adjustment' are also inherited from 'Z9' and 'Z8'.\n\n*As of June 17th, 2024, based on Nikon research.\n\nIt inherits the performance, reliability, and operability of the higher-end models.\n\nIt is equipped with a stacked CMOS sensor and the same high-speed image processing engine 'EXPEED 7' as the flagship model, realizing faster AF operation cycles.
