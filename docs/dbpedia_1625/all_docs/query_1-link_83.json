        "text": "Today, Nikon Inc. introduced the AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR super-telephoto lens and AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED ultra-wide-angle zoom lens, designed to assist FX-format photographers in capturing their subjects with clarity and precision. Specifically engineered for sports, wildlife and photojournalists, the 800mm f/5.6 offers the longest focal length of any NIKKOR autofocus (AF) lens, affording photographers the opportunity to get closer to their subject with extreme telephoto capability. Additionally, the compact and lightweight 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5 is an ultra-wide-angle lens option with a 1.9x zoom range is an ideal focal length for landscape photography and other wide-angle applications.\n\n“The addition of the AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR super-telephoto lens and AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED wide-angle zoom lens to the FX-format NIKKOR lens lineup reaffirms Nikon’s commitment to the optical excellence and versatility that professional and enthusiast photographers have come to expect from Nikon,” said Bo Kajiwara, Vice President of Marketing, Planning and Customer Experience, Nikon Inc. “Whether shooting on the sidelines under stadium lights or composing a landscape in the early morning sun, the newest additions to the NIKKOR line of lenses provide the ability to shoot stunning still images or HD video with amazing sharpness and clarity.”\n\nThe Elusive and Iconic Image is Never Out of Reach\n\nThe new AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR super-telephoto lens provides professional photographers the opportunity to get close to a subject with the longest fixed focal length lens in the NIKKOR family. Designed for the needs of sports, wildlife and news photographers, the 800mm features a maximum aperture of f/5.6 and gives FX-format photographers the chance to capture intense detail and textures that fill the frame from a distance. Included with the new lens is the matched AF-S Teleconverter TC800-1.25E ED which has been developed exclusively for the 800mm f/5.6 lens. This is the first Nikon teleconverter to employ an ED glass element, and extends the maximum focal length 1.25x to 1000mm (1500mm when used with a DX-format camera) and maximum aperture to f/7.1 while maintaining full AF performance on D4, D800 series and D600 FX-format D-SLR cameras.\n\nOriginally trialed and tested under the demanding conditions of the 2012 summer games, the AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR maintains the handling, optical performance, vivid color reproduction and exceptional clarity that professional photographers rely on. This is the first Nikon lens constructed with two fluorite glass elements, combined with two ED glass elements and a Nano Crystal Coat, to help ensure outstanding performance with minimal chromatic aberration and flaring, all within a durable lens body. The addition of fluorite elements allows for consistently excellent optical characteristics while keeping the lens balanced and lightweight. The lens is comprised of 20 elements in 13 groups, and is one of few Nikon lenses to utilize an electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism that enables seamless mechanical control and enhanced stability in auto exposure control during continuous shooting. Vibration Reduction (VR) image stabilization is also implemented, with the equivalent of approximately four stops faster1 shutter speed correction.\n\nAn Ultra Wide-Angle Wonder for FX-Format Photographers\n\nNikon’s newest ultra-wide-angle NIKKOR offering, the AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED, features a useful wide-angle focal length of 18-35mm (1.9x zoom equivalent). This FX-format lens is ideal for large group shots, architecture and photographing or shooting HD video in tight interiors. Performance is optimized for ultra-high-pixel-count D-SLR cameras including the Nikon D800 series and D600, while providing close focus up to .92 feet (approx. 11 inches). The 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5 presents a new, lightweight wide-angle option for FX-format D-SLR shooters.\n\nThe AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED packs NIKKOR quality and performance within an extremely compact and lightweight 0.85 lb. (385g) body, making it easy to carry while on location or on-the-go. Constructed with 12 elements in 8 groups, Nikon’s newest wide-angle lens features a seven-blade diaphragm that allows for beautiful and precise image blur, ED glass to help ensure outstanding performance with minimal chromatic aberration while Nikon’s Super Integrated Coating (SIC) reduces ghosting even in backlit situations. Two focus modes are available including M/A (AF with manual override) and M (Manual) in addition to a Silent Wave Motor (SWM) that enables quiet AF operation.\n\nPrice and Availability\n\nThe AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR, supplied with the AF-S Teleconverter TC800-1.25E ED, will be available in April 2013 for the suggested retail price (SRP) of $17,899.95*.
