        "text": "Lens review\n\nNikon Nikkor AF-S DX Micro 40 mm f/2.8G\n\nArkadiusz Olech\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIn July 2011 the Nikon company quite unexpectedly presented a new lens - the Nikkor AF-S DX Micro 40 mm f/2.8G. It is a macro instrument, with the 1:1 reproduction ratio, designed to cooperate with reflex cameras featuring DX sensor format. It gives the same angle of view as a 60 mm device on full frame (so 39 degrees). It is a bit too much for a typical standard lens but, after all, standard lenses are not only equivalents of classic 50 mm instruments but also lenses with a bit longer focal lengths. Those who ever took photos using analogue Zenit cameras might recall the immortal Helios 2/58 lenses. Even today on the market you can find standard lenses with the focal length longer than 50 mm - you can mention here, e.g. the Voigtlander Nokton 58 mm f/1.4 SL II.\n\nTo sum up, the new Nikon lens can have at a push even three uses. First of all it is a macro device but it can be also considered a standard lens or be used as a telephoto for less stiff portraits.\n\nThe lens was provided for testing purposes by the Cyfrowe.pl shop.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - advertisement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nYou are also invited to get acquainted with our test procedure, described in the article \"How do we test lenses?\" If you feel itâ€™s still not enough, please go to our FAQ section where you can find some further explanation."
