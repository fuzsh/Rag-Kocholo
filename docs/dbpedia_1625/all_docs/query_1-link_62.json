        "text": "<p>Hi All, <br>\n\nBought a used Nikkor 135 DC. One of the internal focusing rails is bent and needs to be replaced. Because of Nikon's grey market import service ban, I can't even get Nippon Photo in New York to repair it because Nikon refused to even tell Nippon the part numbers or allow them to be ordered. Does anyone have experience with a small personal nikon lens technician/shop in Korea or Japan? The kind of place where you have direct contact with the owner/technician? Trying to contact Nikon itself by phone is difficult because they use Japan-National 800 number equivalents that you cannot call from outside the country. And I prefer to deal with a smaller professional personal shop.<br>\n\nThanks<br>\n\nRichard</p>\n\n<p>Richard, you seem to be in the US, right? Have you tried Authorized Photo Service in the Chicago area? <a href=\"http://nikoncamerarepair.com/\">http://nikoncamerarepair.com/</a><br>\n\nThat shop seems to be run by Koreans.</p>\n\n<p>Dear Shun, <br>\n\nas mentioned, Nikon USA will not supply parts, so that shop will not be in a beter situation than Nippon in NYC.<br>\n\nA review fo the grey market issue can be found here:<br>\n\nhttp://bythom.com/warranty.htm</p>\n\n<p>Richard, parts do not have to come from Nikon USA. Authorized Photo Service fixed my gray-market 200mm/f4 AF-D macro lens back in 2005: <a href=\"00BxJs\">http://www.photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/00BxJs</a></p>\n\n<p>As I said, that shop seems to be run by Koreans. The first time I called them back then, I talked to someone who spoke somewhat broken English. The second time I called them to approve the repair estimate, I talked to someone who spoke fluent American English. I suppose they have their sources for parts from Asia.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think it hurts to give them a call. If they can fix it, you'll be dealing with a shop in the US, thus making things easier.</p>\n\n<p>\"I would prefer to work with a professional shop where I have direct contact with the technician. \"</p>\n\n<p>A professional shop: i.e., the Nikon Corp. service center in Japan fits that request. You asked for a repair place in Korea -- that would not fit your request.</p>\n\n<p>Nikon made the lens, and it would be the ideal spot to have your lens repaired -- the Shinjuku site was there when I was stationed in Japan and they did quality work.</p>\n\n<p> </p>"
