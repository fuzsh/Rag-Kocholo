        "text": "• This service supplies software that can be used to update the firmware for NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S lenses to version 1.22. You will not need to download or install this update if the firmware listed above is already installed.\n\n• This firmware update is performed with a NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S lens attached to a camera. See “Compatible Cameras” for a list of compatible cameras.\n\n• When updating the firmware, mount the NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S directly on the camera; do not attach the teleconverter.\n\n• To perform the update, you will need the memory card used in the camera and a compatible card reader.\n\n• Read the information below before proceeding.\n\nThe following cameras can be used to update the firmware for NIKKOR Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S lenses:\n\n• Z-series cameras\n\nNote: Updates can be performed for you by a Nikon-authorized service representative.\n\n• Fixed the following issues:\n\n- The focus distance displayed in the lens info panel immediately after the camera was turned on would sometimes not change if the zoom ring was rotated while the camera was off. In rare cases, this would cause autofocus to stop.\n\n- When an option other than [Non-linear] was selected for Custom Setting f9 ([Focus ring rotation range]), a beep would sound to signal that a stored focus position had been recalled despite the focus ring having been rotated to end memory recall before completion of the recall operation initiated by pressing the camera control to which [Recall focus position] was assigned."
