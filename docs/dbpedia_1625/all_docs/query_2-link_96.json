The NH203 flight on the ANA Green Jet was between Tokyo Haneda and Frankfurt on November 11, 2022.\n\nThe ANA Green Jet is a specially painted aircraft that promotes ANA's decarbonization initiatives through a variety of measures, including the use of sustainability-themed in-flight service products and flight operations.\n\n\"I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Nishimura, Minister of the Environment, for flying with us on board the ANA Green Jet,\" said Shinichi Inoue, Chief Executive Officer and President of ANA. \"While climate change is a critical issue that needs to be swiftly addressed, the role of air transportation in connecting people and goods with the rest of the world for international exchange and economic growth will continue to remain very important through the future. ANA is committed to serving the global community, and we will continue to work with various stakeholders in the public and private sectors to promote the use of SAF as well as other initiatives, and to contribute to the realization of carbon neutrality in Japan and addressing environmental issues in the international community through our business.\"\n\nAbout ANA\n\nFounded in 1952 with just two helicopters, All Nippon Airways (ANA) has grown to become the largest airline in Japan. ANA HOLDINGS Inc. (ANA HD) was established in 2013 as the largest airline group holding company in Japan, comprising 69 companies including ANA and Peach Aviation, the leading LCC in Japan.\n\nANA is a launch customer and the largest operator of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, making ANA HD the biggest Dreamliner owner in the world. A member of Star Alliance since 1999, ANA has joint venture agreements with United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Swiss International Airlines and Austrian Airlines - giving it a truly global presence.\n\nThe airline's legacy of superior service has helped it earn SKYTRAX's respected 5-Star rating every year since 2013, with ANA being the only Japanese airline to win this prestigious designation for nine consecutive years. ANA also has been recognized by Air Transport World as \"Airline of the Year\" three times (2007, 2013 and 2018); it is one of only a select few airlines to win this prominent award multiple times.\n\nIn 2021, ANA was awarded the 5-star COVID-19 safety rating by SKYTRAX, recognizing the airline's initiatives to provide a safe, clean and hygienic environment at airports and aboard aircraft, embodied in the ANA Care Promise.\n\nANA is the only company in the aviation industry to receive the Gold Class distinction from the 2022 S&P Global Sustainability Awards and ANA HD has been selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index list for the fifth consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index list for the sixth consecutive year.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the following link.\n\nhttps://www.ana.co.jp/group/en/"
