Assuming they have business insurance it is just going to hurt for a short bit while they re-located and re-build..\n\nQuite a few companies do what's called \"self insure. Instead of paying regular insurance premiums, they put the money aside for emergencies. I bet it will take most of next year for Nikon to be up and running near normal. Remember, not only have they lost their equipment etc., but they have lost the profit from the sales too. A lot of camera companies went out of business after the destruction of WW2.\n\nThe cameras I was thinking of Nikon making in the mid 1950s were the S-mount rangefinders, not the F mount of 1959.\n\nAnother thought--what about parts for when our current stuff breaks? I sent a Nikon SB-800 in to LA repair facility several weeks ago and haven't heard back from them at all.\n\nKent in SD\n\nZebrabot\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.2 #5 · p.2 #5 · \"No Prospect of Recovery\"\n\nRodolfo Paiz wrote:\n\nI'd have preferred not to say anything, but I can't not say anything.\n\nAre you sure you don't want to rethink, rephrase, or reword that post, if only for the benefit of your public image?\n\nNope.

Yeah, payroll will be lower, but you're not going to get nearly as much work done unless you have a fairly large operation there, and not some shack with 5 people waiting around the fax machine 23 hours a day for orders from HQ in the united states to come in, if the phone lines still work.\n\nM635_Guy\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.2 #8 · p.2 #8 · \"No Prospect of Recovery\"\n\nZebrabot wrote:\n\nNope.

The low end DSLR is Nikon's bread and butter line. Now that line is down. Nikon's first priority must be to solve the manufacturing of these low end DSLRs. Other products may be put to lower priority.\n\nFor those who need a Christmas gift from Nikon, look at one of the Nikon 1 cameras. That may be the only new cameras this year.\n\nEric\n\nTwo23\n\nOffline\n\n    \n\n: Off\n\np.2 #13 · p.2 #13 · \"No Prospect of Recovery\"\n\npenghai wrote:\n\nI really doubt D800 will be there any time soon.

I personally doubt we'll see anything new from Nikon for another 10-12 months, but even if they do the supplies could just be a trickle. My SB-800 came back on Friday from Nikon as \"uneconomical to repair\". Crap. This morning I bought a used SB-900 for $350 on eBay. My thinking was I didn't want to dither on buying another one in case the supply is very limited and prices will be skyrocketing next week. I use flash a lot. Really, that's the only thing I can think of that I really needed from Nikon for now. About the only break that Nikon seems to have caught here is that Sony might be in a similar mess.\n\nKent in SD\n\nM635_Guy\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.2 #14 · p.2 #14 · \"No Prospect of Recovery\"\n\nRodolfo Paiz wrote:\n\nI can only speculate that you must have poor taste, or low standards, in the companies for whom you choose to work.
