        "text": "Tokyo: Nikon’s April-September sales and operating profit beat its expectations thanks to a healthy performance from its camera division, and advance orders for a new model are also better than expected, the company’s president said on Wednesday.\n\nMakoto Kimura told the news agency in an interview that the world’s second-largest maker of interchangeable lens cameras after Canon was not yet experiencing a slowdown in sales due to the debt crisis in the euro zone, but added he was concerned about a possible downturn in October-March.\n\nNikon Corp.’s Nikon 1 J1 mirrorless single-lens reflex digital cameras are on display. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nHe added that camera sales tend to be relatively immune to changes in the economic environment, but that a sharp downturn would nonetheless affect the company.\n\nNikon is set to report its June-September earnings on 4 November, about the same time as other Japanese electronics companies, several of whom have said they are battling an extremely harsh economic environment ahead of the crucial pre-Christmas shopping season.\n\nThe yen soared to a 10 year high against the euro on Tuesday, cutting the value of sales in Europe, while the dollar is hovering at less than ¥77. Europe accounted for 23% of Nikon’s sales in the year to March 2010, while the United States (US) made up 27%.\n\nLike many other Japanese firms, Nikon wants to increase euro-denominated procurement to help combat the yen’s strength, but is struggling to do so, Kimura said.\n\nIn the latest evidence consumption is weakening, top British retailer Tesco Plc posted one of its biggest-ever quarterly falls in underlying sales on Wednesday.\n\nMirrorless\n\nSeparately, Kimura said that the company expects to sell several hundred thousand units of its new compact “mirrorless” interchangeable lens cameras by the end of the financial year in March 2012.\n\nAdvance orders from dealers for the Nikon 1 models, which go on sale on 20 October, are stronger than expected, Kimura said. He expects the model to take off in Asia first, but eventually also to sell well outside the region.\n\nRival Fujifilm Holdings Corp is set to release its own line of mirrorless cameras next spring, the company said on Wednesday, boosting competition in a market already crowded with competitors including Olympus and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics.\n\nShares in Nikon fell 0.1% on Wednesday, but have risen more than 7% since the beginning of the financial year in April, partly on expectations for the new cameras, which pack many of the advantages of a bulky single-lens reflex model into a smaller body.\n\nCanon has fallen about 5% over the same period, on concerns about the yen and consumption trends in Europe and the US."
