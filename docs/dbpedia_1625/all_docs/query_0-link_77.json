        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am sorry if I am repeating anything, I would like some advice on\n\nthe above lens.\n\nI live in Australia and interested to get the above lens from B & H.\n\nThe USA version is 9000.00 & Gray version is 7300.00. The shipping\n\nitself is 200.00 to Australia for either choice. Gray version is\n\n1700.00 dollars cheaper. I would like some advice on the following:-\n\n1) In my case is it worthwhile to purchase the USA version\n\nconsidering the fact that, shipping if necessary for repair is itself\n\ncost 200.00 each way which is 400.00 itself!!\n\n2) Is it reasonable to buy a Gray market item for a big investment\n\nlike this? I have bought Gray market 50mm lenses etc fron B & H\n\nbefore, without any trouble. But a bit reluctant for an expensive\n\nitem like this.\n\nMany thanks for the information.\n\nCheers\n\nYou would have to 'e-mail' Nikon, Inc. in Japan to find out if the Nikon Worldwide Warranty would apply to a lens bought in New York City, New York, USA. My guess, since you are out in the 'world,' the warranty would be honored at any Nikon service center except for the two located in the U.S.A. (and maybe Nikon Canada would not honor a repair request.)\n\n[if you were a tourist and bought the lens in Japan, the Nikon warranty would apply anywhere in the world.]\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf I were you, I would determine whether you can get the lens fixed in Australia should it fail a few years down the road, long after any 1-year warranty has expired. One of the potential problem with grey-market products in the US is that Nikon USA will never fix it even though you are willing to pay them.\n\nBuying grey-market items involves one's risk-tolerance level. Obviously \"your mileage may vary\" as they say about cars in the US, but if the price difference is that big, I would definitely get the grey version. Unless you drop it, the chance that a well build lens such as the 600mm/f4 AF-S breaks is pretty small, although the aperture disphragm on my 500mm/f4 P did get stuck once, but a lot of local repair shops can fix that kind of problems. If we are talking about some complex DSLR body that nobody other than Nikon itself can fix and make firmare upgrades, I might avoid the grey version.\n\nAgain, it is your risk tolerance level that really matters, not mine.\n\nUm, if the warranty costs $1,700 and is based on experience, about 23% of those lenses need to be replaced during the warranty period. This is !@#$ ridiculous.\n\nI believe that the gray version comes with the Nikon \"non-US\" warranty. Ask B&H, don't believe what's posted here. If they say 'yes,' go for the gray!\n\nIs it reasonable to buy a gray version of an expensive lens? Only if you think the insurance is worth the price. I've never thought so, especially on MF lenses. Not sure about AF lenses, as I have no experience with them.\n\nFWIW, if I recall correctly so far my wife and I have bought 16 Nikkors over the last 33 years and none has required service yet. Off-brands are another matter. My first Vivitar 75-200/4.5 SCAF was dead on arrival and was replaced by the dealer; the second one is doggy but trouble-free. My first Celestron C-90 was completely unusable and missing parts; the replacement, on warranty, had all the parts and was merely terrible.\n\nCheers,\n\nDan\n\nThe chance that any Nikon lens developing any problems within the first year is pretty small. I have owned 20+ Nikkor lenses over the last 26 years and only 1 required warranty repair within the first year, and that was a faulty push/pull zoom mechanism in my 35-70mm/f2.8 AF. Two other lenses developed a stuck aperture diaphragm; both of those took place in remote areas under harsh conditions and many years after the initial purchase.\n\nIn other words, when you receive your lens, you should check it thoroughly to make sure that it is free of any defects. Of course you can always get unlucky, but the chance that you'll use any one-year warranty is very small, especially on a 600mm/f4 AF-S prime.\n\nObviously a 19% price difference is significant, and even more glaring when there's a\n\n$1700.00 variance. I would contact Nikon repair in Australia, and ask them how they\n\nwould treat a grey market lens if repair may became necessary. The first year\n\nwould be covered by B&H, and if it needed service then it would cost you $400.00\n\nround trip shipping. After the first year, I would definitely want to know whether or\n\nnot it could be serviced by Nikon in Australia once it passed the one year waranty.\n\nBelow is a direct quote from B&H's web site that explains grey market warranties.\n\n\"What happens after the warranty expires?\n\nAny customer, no matter where he or she lives, would take an item\n\nrequiring repair to any repair shop that is convenient, and pay for the\n\nrepair.\"\n\nBut, it does not say that Nikon would do the repair. That may or may not be\n\nsignificant to you. For that much money, I'd nose around ahead of the purchase, and\n\narm my self with the answers right from the horse's mouth. Non-Nikon (independent)\n\nrepair facilities may also be able to satisfactorily service the lens. :o)\n\n\" I ran into that problem a few years ago with a AF 8 5mm here in the states. Not a\n\nhappy time \"\n\nThat's a tough decision for sure, and when it means an additional $1700.00, that\n\nmakes it even worse, LOL. It's a bit easier to take a chance with a less expensive lens.\n\nIt's not as though I think he would have a problem with the grey market lens, but as\n\nShun said, it isn't my risk, it's Charlie's.\n\nIf it were me, this one would have been a no brainer. When I bought my 300mm/f2.8 AF-S back in 1998, the grey-market version was $1000 cheaper and that was what I bought. Two years ago I went for the grey version of 300mm/f4 AF-S that was $100 cheaper ($900 vs. $1000). I have bought 7 AF-S lenses since 1998, 3 primes and 4 zooms (the zooms happen to be all USA versions because of the minute price difference). None of them has failed so far. There is slightly more risk involved for zooms since they are mechanically more complex.\n\nBut this is Charlie's decision, not my decision. Just in case something happens, I don't want him to feel that I/we give him poor advice. If nothing goes wrong, he isn't going to share part of his $1700 savings with us, right? :-)\n\nHi Guys,\n\nMany thanks for the great advice. Yep I am keen to share the 1700 if one can guarrantee there's no trouble, still it is 850 cheaper. May be if someone else rather than B&H ship it to me perhaps I can even avoid the taxes as well !!!!!!\n\nI checked from Maxwell the distributors of Nikon in Australia. They confirmed the warranty is valid only for 1 year for USA version. The repairs are done by a local authorised repairer in each state and they are happy to fix any problems of this lens in the rare event should it occur. FYI the 600mm lens retails ~ USD12000.00 here. It is far too expensive. This is because the Nikon agents, Maxwell rip off a big chunk before hand. That is why a lot of Aussies either buy from B&H or from HK. The current price in HK is USD7200. Another option is to fly to HK for USD800.00 and buying the lens personally as some of my friends have done. But hotel charges, loss of income from not working etc adds on to the cost. I think for me it is far easier to buy from B&H as I have done in the past.\n\nWhat is the option of getting Mack warranty for a grey lens? Is this reliable? I have no experience with this.\n\nThanks again"
