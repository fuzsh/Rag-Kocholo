        "text": "Name Post-nominal Abbreviation Agency or Description Juris Doctor J.D. An academic, not a professional designation. Identifies a person who has obtained the academic degree Juris Doctor or Doctor of Jurisprudence, which are different names for the same professional degree in law. Arizona discourages use of the initials by people who are not members of the Arizona Bar, in case that might mislead the general public in thinking the person is licensed; and other U.S. jurisdictions may do likewise. However, this may be unenforceable on First Amendment grounds and because the letters indicate an academic degree not a professional qualification to practice law. Doctor of Jurisprudence D.Jur. or J.D. An academic, not a professional designation. Identifies a person who has obtained the academic degree Doctor of Jurisprudence – functionally the same degree as Juris Doctor but conferred in English instead of Latin. Although conferred in English, the degree may be abbreviated in Latin (viz., compare Latin Ed.D. used for either Doctor of Education or Educationis Doctor; and M.D., used for both Medicinae Doctor and Doctor of Medicine, the latter which can also be abbreviated D.M.). Doctor of Juridical Science S.J.D. An academic, not a professional designation. Identifies a person who has obtained the academic degree Scientiae Juridicae Doctor. It is academically the equivalent of a Ph.D.[47] and is designed for aspiring legal academics who wish to pursue sustained independent study, research, and writing.[48] Master of Laws LL.M. An academic, not a professional designation. Identifies a person who has obtained the degree Legum Magister. Originally the second of three degrees in sequence – Legum Baccalaureus (LL.B., last conferred by an American law school in 1970); LL.M.; and Legum Doctor (LL.D.) or Doctor of Laws, which has only been conferred in the United States as an honorary degree but is an earned degree in other countries. In American legal academia, the LL.M. was historically conferred after the LL.B. When the LL.B. was displaced by the J.D., the LL.M. metamorphosed functionally from a post-baccalaureate degree into a post-doctoral degree. Bachelor of Civil Law BCL An academic, not a professional designation. The BCL is a degree in professional law conferred by some Anglophone universities. It originated as a second baccalaureate degree at Oxford University; where it is still conferred at Oxford as a law degree higher than the BA in law, but it is also conferred by other institutions as a first baccalaureate degree. Esquire Esq. Used by attorneys who have been admitted to the bar. Use by non-attorneys may be restricted by law (see unauthorized practice of law); however, these provisions may not be enforceable on First Amendment grounds and because the abbreviation has never limited to the legal profession. It is used by some fraternal organisations, including a branch of Freemasonry that uses it as a degree; and, perhaps more importantly, it can be used by and in address to commissioned officers in the United States foreign service. Otherwise, 'Esq.' has been historically used by non-attorneys who are the fourth or later generation with the same name as a forebear, e.g. Henry Smith I, Henry Smith II, Henry Smith III, thereafter Henry Smith, Esq. Traditional etiquette directs courtesy titles like Esquire are not used with honorific or post-nomial abbreviations. But when Esquire or Esq. represent a professional qualification (legal or otherwise), the opposite rule applies; especially if there are multiple pre- and/or post-nomial abbreviations, e.g. Dr. Lt.Col. Henry J. Smith, Esq., J.D., M.D., Ph.D., USA (the last set of letters representing United States Army). Justice of the Peace J.P. Denotes a level of judgeship Notary Public N.P.[49] Notaries in the USA are commissioned by the Secretary of State or equivalent officers of a state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. The federal United States does not commission notaries public. Notarial responsibility varies from state to state, with California notaries required to use a seal that contains the Great Seal of California while notaries from some other states are not required to have a seal at all.
