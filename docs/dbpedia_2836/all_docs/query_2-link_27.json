        "text": "Transitional Certificate of Qualification and Registration\n\nThe Transitional Certificate of Qualification and Registration (TCQR) is available to eligible teacher candidates who are enrolled in an Ontario-accredited teacher education program. Members who hold a TCQR can work as occasional or supply teachers while they complete their teacher education program, provided they meet the OCT’s eligibility requirements. TCQRs are valid for 18 months with a possible six-month extension.\n\nLearn more about Transitional Certificates.\n\nOnce these eligibility requirements are met, students in the Master of Teaching and MA-CSE programs have the option of applying for a TCQR, if they wish to do so. Students apply for the TCQR via the College’s online application system. This choice is entirely voluntary, and students will not be dissuaded or compelled to apply for or engage in the TCQR. Information about the TCQR and answers to FAQs can be found on the OCT website .\n\nShould you decide to apply for the TCQR and engage in supply teaching upon receiving it while competing your teacher education program, you should be aware of the following:\n\n1. As the TCQR holder, you are an Ontario Certified Teacher and member of OCT and as such, you are expected to uphold and demonstrate the College’s professional and ethical standards at all times. As an OCT member, if you fail to uphold these standards, you will be subject to potential findings of professional misconduct and any resulting discipline.\n\n2. While engaged in supply teaching with your TCQR, you are expected to fully participate in fulfilling your degree requirements including attending classes, completing coursework and practicum placements as outlined in the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) calendar entry for your program.\n\n3. The supply teaching days gained through the TCQR may not be used as a replacement for the required supervised practicum experience outlined in our degree program requirements.\n\nIn order to process an application for a TCQR, the OCT requires that you have submitted the general application and all required documentation and fees related to the general application. You will need to submit an official transcript that documents the courses that you have completed so far in your teacher education program.\n\nIn addition, the OCT requires that OISE sends a report indicating that you have met the TCQR eligibility requirements.\n\nThis reporting process is separate from the “Report from Faculty” that OISE sends to the OCT at the end of your program as part of the OCT’s regular certification process. To support the TCQR process, OISE's Registrar's Office & Student Experience (ROSE) has developed a separate Request to have a Faculty Report sent to OCT for the Transitional Certificate form that will allow eligible OISE teacher educations students to authorize OISE to send the report to the OCT.\n\nThe deadlines for you to submit the form in 2024 are: July 17, August 21, September 18, October 16, November 20 & December 18*. The Faculty Report will be sent to the OCT between 5 to 7 business days after each deadline. *Our office will be closed from Dec 24 to January 5; the December 18 deadline Faculty Report will be sent to the OCT in Early January.\n\nConsiderations"
