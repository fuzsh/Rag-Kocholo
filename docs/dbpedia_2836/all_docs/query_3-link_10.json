        "text": "Investment professionals might hold a variety of designations and other credentials, offered by a multitude of organizations. FINRA’s Professional Designations Database provides information about many of the designations you might see used, including prerequisites and other requirements for obtaining and holding such designations.\n\nFINRA does NOT approve or endorse any professional designation, nor does a designation’s inclusion in this database imply that FINRA considers the designation to be acceptable for use by a registered representative. Furthermore, state securities regulators may prohibit or restrict the use of certain listed designations by registered persons and investment adviser representatives.\n\nThe FINRA database is provided to assist investors in evaluating the professional designations that an investment professional may hold. FINRA is not responsible for and cannot verify information from sources other than FINRA and does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the information.\n\nThis database is by no means inclusive of all financial professional designations and, specifically, doesn’t include those related to employee benefits or to finance degrees from accredited colleges or universities.\n\nIn addition, before you engage an investment professional, dig deeper than just their name and professional credentials. Learn more about choosing an investment professional.\n\nProfessional Designation Accreditation\n\nSome state securities and insurance regulators don’t allow financial professionals to use a designation unless it has been accredited by either the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB), a subsidiary of the American National Standards Institute, or the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the certification program accreditation body of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (I.C.E.). Find accredited designations using ANAB or NCCA search tools.\n\nSecurities Industry Registrations\n\nThe securities industry is highly regulated. Federal and state agencies, as well as non-governmental regulators like FINRA and the securities exchanges, oversee the activities of securities professionals. This includes registered principals, who are actively engaged in the management of a firm's investment banking or securities business, and registered representatives, who are involved in a firm's investment banking or securities business.\n\nBoth firms and individuals must be registered with FINRA to conduct securities transactions and business with the investing public. Individuals might also be required to meet state registration requirements. Additionally, firms must meet certain membership standards to attain registration.\n\nFor someone to become a registered financial professional, their securities firm must file with FINRA a Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer, commonly referred to as Form U4. The form provides considerable information about a person’s work history, outside business activities and disclosures including criminal and civil actions, and regulatory actions.\n\nIn addition, individuals seeking to become registered financial professionals must pass one or more qualification exams, administered by FINRA, to demonstrate competence in their particular securities activities.\n\nEach registered financial professional receives a unique CRD number that’s used throughout their career in the securities industry. Investors can look up an individual’s registration information using FINRA BrokerCheck.\n\nOnce registered with a brokerage firm, an individual must comply with FINRA rules, federal and state securities regulations, and the firm's policies to maintain the registration. These rules include mandatory continuing education through programs offered at the firm and industry-wide levels.\n\nRelated Rules and Regulations\n\nThe following rules and resources apply to use of professional designations and credentials by investment professionals:"
