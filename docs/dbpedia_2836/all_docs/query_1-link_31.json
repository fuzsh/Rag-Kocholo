        "text": "COURSE DESCRIPTIONS\n\nTSL5250 Methodology in Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Language\n\nTeaching English as a second or foreign language varies greatly depending on the students, institutional context and location. Through exploring teaching materials and online teaching tools, writing lesson plans, critically evaluating classroom management techniques, conducting microteaching demonstrations and reflecting on the teaching and learning processes, students develop initial understanding of English teaching methodologies. Students' initial exposure to the field is enhanced by identifying the characteristics of the adult learner and examining historical and current methods in second language teaching. Students also work with Canadian Language Benchmarks.\n\nTSL5251 Language Learning and Culture\n\nLearners' cultural context greatly influences the practice of English as a second/foreign language teaching. Through critical incident evaluation and online reflections, students develop an intercultural perspective in teaching ESL. Students become reflective teachers by critically exploring how culture is reflected in language and discussing the relevance of their own and their students' culture for classroom teaching. The history and current state of multiculturalism and anti-racism in Canada are examined, as well as the role of English as an international language.\n\nTSL5252 Pedagogical Grammar\n\nKnowledge of the grammatical system of English is an indispensable tool for second language teachers. ESL learner error correction allows students to develop a basic understanding of the form, function and use of grammar terminology in today's English language classroom. Through preparing lesson plans and microteaching presentations, students acquire basic knowledge of current grammar teaching methodologies and strategies to integrate grammar in the teaching of reading, writing, listening and speaking.\n\nTSL5253 Independent Learning Project\n\nPrivate tutoring is a common activity for ESL/EFL teachers. Students work one-on-one with an assigned ESL student and compile a learner profile in order to observe their learning styles, communication patterns, learner errors and language learning progress.\n\nTSL5274 Introduction to Language and Language Acquisition\n\nTeaching ESL/EFL effectively requires familiarity with how language is connected with cognition. Through collaborative reflections on course readings and group presentations, students gain a basic understanding of various systems within language, such as phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics, as well as psychological, social and historical aspects of language. Students also review second language acquisition theories and their relevance to classroom teaching.\n\nTSL5276 Practicum 1 - Teaching English as a Second Language\n\nFirst-hand experience in observing an adult ESL classroom affords pre-service teachers great insight into current teaching practices and classroom dynamics, and provides a critical lens in developing their own teaching skills. Students observe an adult ESL classroom to enhance their understanding of teaching techniques in a field placement setting. Students may also participate in teaching through small group facilitation, one-on-one tutoring and marking, as well as other teaching-related activities.\n\nTSL0011 Assessment and Evaluation in Second Language Teaching\n\nAssessment and evaluation of ESL learners' progress is an indispensable part of effective teaching. Students learn the basic principles, procedures and techniques of assessing and evaluating ESL students' language proficiency. As they practise the evaluation of learner performance in reading, writing, listening and speaking through developing and critiquing tests and rubrics, students also explore alternative methods of evaluating language proficiency, as well as standardized language testing.\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250\n\nTSL5255 Teaching Reading and Writing\n\nReading and Writing are two of the four language skills often taught in ESL programs. Students develop a greater understanding of ESL teaching methodologies through adoption of techniques and strategies for integrating all language skills for the purposes of teaching Reading and Writing. Students practise planning lessons and review the basic principles of materials development for Reading and Writing courses. They also get first-hand experience providing corrective feedback on ESL learners' writing by participating in an online writing exchange.\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250\n\nTSL5256 Teaching Listening, Speaking and Pronunciation\n\nListening and Speaking are two of the four language skills often taught in ESL programs, while Pronunciation is an important aspect of teaching Speaking. Students enhance their understanding of ESL teaching methodologies by adopting techniques and strategies for integrating all language skills for the purposes of teaching Listening and Speaking. Students review the sound system of English and learn to design pronunciation activities. Students also practise planning lessons and review the basic principles of content development based an authentic video.\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250\n\nTSL5258 Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Language Online\n\nTeaching ESL/EFL online using advanced web-conferencing platforms and learning management systems has become a regular part of teaching in the field. Students develop an initial understanding of how to use technology in the ESL classroom for teaching in synchronous and asynchronous environments. Through preparation for microteaching in a web-conferencing environment, students explore teaching with language learning software, Brightspace, and other learning management systems, social media and 3D Virtual Learning Environments. Students also practise designing teaching materials using online tools.\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250\n\nTSL5260 Curriculum Development in English for Specific Purposes\n\nAs ESL programs become more specialized, curriculum development is a sought after teaching competency. Students develop a further understanding of ESL teaching methodologies through the exploration of current teaching contexts in English for Specific Purposes (ESP). Students explore content-based instruction in language courses and participate in the development of ESP curricula for existing language programs in Canada and abroad.\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250\n\nTSL5284 Practicum II - Teaching English as a Second Language\n\nFirst-hand experience in teaching in an adult ESL classroom under guidance of experienced mentors prepares pre-service teachers for independent work in the classroom. Through completing their required hours of practice teaching, students practise their lesson planning and teaching skills in a field placement setting.\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250 and TSL5276\n\nTSL5254 Adult Literacy and Beginner Esl\n\nTeaching adult literacy and low beginner students requires specialized knowledge and skills. Students use appropriate techniques and develop curricula for Adult Literacy programs and for beginner levels of ESL. Topics include the teaching of basic skills in reading, writing and survival communication to beginner learners.\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250\n\nTSL5261 Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Language to Young Learners\n\nTeachers of English as a Second/Foreign Language internationally often teach young learners aged 4 to 17. Students identify the characteristics of the child and adolescent second language learners, and examine current methods and approaches in teaching a second language to children and adolescents in the context of mainstream pedagogical theories and practices. As part of lesson plan writing and microteaching demonstrations, students create learning activities and tasks for children and adolescents who are English as a second or foreign language learners. Students also explore current English as a foreign language teaching frameworks, such as Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and Content-Based Instruction (CBI).\n\nPre-requisites: TSL5250"
