        "text": "Professional organizations in some complementary health professions offer certification examinations to graduates of accredited education and training programs. Certification may play a role in qualifying graduates for state licensure.\n\nFor example, in most states acupuncturists must be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine or pass that organizationâs exams to be licensed. Some of the other professional organizations involved in certification include the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE), and the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners.\n\nSchools and educational programs across the country train complementary health practitioners and prepare them for certification in their field. The U.S. Department of Education authorizes specific organizations to accredit education or training programs. For example, it has authorized The Council on Chiropractic Education to accredit chiropractic colleges and the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine to accredit acupuncture programs.\n\nDifferences in Licensing Requirements for Complementary Health Practitioners\n\nThe requirements for treating patients vary considerably from state to state and among the different practices."
