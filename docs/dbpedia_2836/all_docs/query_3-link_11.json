By becoming more familiar with this usage, you will become more precise in your daily formal writing. This precision can then also potentially conserve more space for other words you’re expressing.\n\nAbbreviating Professional Titles\n\nA professional (formal) title is typically one that indicates authority, professional status, or academic activity. As a general rule, we can abbreviate certain titles when they appear before full names or before initials and last names. In American English, abbreviations include a period.\n\nDr. (Doctor) Rep. (Representative) Insp. Gen. (Inspector General) Mr. (Mister) Gen. (General) Assoc. Prof. (Associate Professor) Prof. (Professor) St. (Saint)* Asst. Prof. (Assistant Professor) Ald. (Alderman) Gov. (Governor) Col. (Colonel) Sen. (Senator) Pres. (President) Lt. Col. (Lieutenant Colonel)\n\nExamples Dr. Martin Hawkes Rep. J. Randolph St.* Thomas the Apostle Gen. J.J. Wyndham Prof. Roberta Stanton Sen. S. Trevathan\n\nWe would not abbreviate such titles before last names alone.\n\nExamples Doctor Hawkes General Wyndham Professor Stanton Senator Trevathan Representative Randolph Captain Taylor\n\n*Note that St. can be either abbreviated or spelled in full if with a first name only: St. Thomas, Saint Thomas; otherwise, standard guidelines would apply: St. Dominic Savio, but Saint Savio.\n\nSimilarly, we would abbreviate Hon. for Honorable and Rev. for Reverend when they do not include the word the and appear before full names or before initials and last names. We also would not abbreviate such titles before last names alone.\n\nExamples Hon. Gary Masterson the Honorable Gary Masterson Rev. H.B. Robinson Reverend Robinson\n\nWhen a formal title follows a person’s name, we abbreviate the title with a period: Jr. (Junior), Sr. (Senior), Esq. (Esquire). We would include a comma before Esq. but not before Jr. and Sr.\n\nBartholomew H. Makepeace, Esq.\n\nPreston B. Franklin Jr.\n\nErnesto R. Gonzalez Sr.\n\nNote we would not use the abbreviation Esq. when another title is given before or after the name:\n\nCorrect: Bartholomew H. Makepeace, Esq.\n\nIncorrect: Mr. Bartholomew H. Makepeace, Esq.\n\nCorrect: B.H. Makepeace, Esq.\n\nIncorrect: B.H. Makepeace, M.D., Esq.\n\nAbbreviating Academic Degrees\n\nIndividuals might choose to identify themselves with an academic degree or designation of achievement attained. The following are common abbreviations for such distinctions.\n\nB.A. (Bachelor of Arts) Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) B.F.A. (Bachelor of Fine Arts) J.D. (Juris Doctor [Doctor of Law]) B.S. (Bachelor of Science) R.N. (Registered Nurse) M.S. (Master of Science) M.D. (Doctor of Medicine) M.A. (Master of Arts) C.P.A. (Certified Public Accountant)\n\nWhen an abbreviated academic reference is included, the abbreviation would follow the person’s full name and be set off by a comma. No other title should precede the name.\n\nCorrect: Tyra E. King, M.D.\n\nCorrect: T.E. King, M.D.\n\nIncorrect: Dr. Tyra E. King, M.D.\n\nIncorrect: Doctor King, M.D.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nPunctuation for Abbreviations\n\nCapitalization of Academic Degrees\n\nCapitalization of Job Titles\n\nPop Quiz\n\nChoose the correct forms of professional titles according to their context in each sentence.\n\n1.
