        "text": "Foreign trained applicants will follow the Steps to Certification for issuance of an initial Florida certificate. Step 1 explains the requirements for a complete application packet: an online application, processing fee, and official documentation of degrees and credits. Please see Applicants with Foreign Academic Training for important, detailed information on acceptable documentation of degrees and credits earned outside the United States.\n\nThe applicant with a valid U.S. social security number1 and U.S. state or territory mailing address should submit the Online Certification Application Form.\n\nThe applicant who does not have a valid U.S. social security number1 and a U.S. state or territory mailing address may also submit the Online Certification Application Form. However, A valid social security number1 issued by the United States Social Security Administration is required for issuance of a Florida Educator's Certificate..\n\nThe applicant who is not a United States citizen may complete Step 1 (Submit Complete Application Packet) and Step 2 (Receive Official Statement of Status of Eligibility) of the Steps to Certification. However, appropriate immigration status must be established through the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) prior to employment. The Bureau of Educator Certification cannot provide assistance with visas since this is strictly an employment issue. Consequently, matters related to immigration status or visas should be discussed with any prospective employer. Upon employment in an approved Florida school, the employer must submit appropriate verification of immigration status to the Bureau of Educator Certification as one requirement for issuance of a Florida Educator Certificate.\n\nThe Official Statement of Status of Eligibility (Step 2) lists all required certification tests Florida Teacher Certification Examinations (FTCE). The testing administrator electronically submits passing scores to the Bureau of Educator Certification. The Bureau of Educator Certification can only accept scores that are reported under a valid U.S. social security number1. The applicant’s educator certification file must reflect the same U.S. social security number1.\n\n1SSN Statement: Collection of your social security number (SSN) is required pursuant to §1012.56, Florida Statutes, for the purpose of promoting the public policy of Florida relating to child support. Your SSN is used by the Department as a unique identifier for maintaining your certification and related personnel records as required under the same statute. Your SSN may be disclosed to the Department of Revenue, as authorized under §1012.21, Florida Statutes, as Florida’s agency for administration of the Title IV-D program of the federal Social Security Act for child support enforcement. Failure to provide your SSN to Educator Certification will prevent issuance of your Florida Educator’s Certificate.\n\nBegin the Steps to Certification\n\nContact Educator Certification"
