        "text": "Assessment and Evaluation\n\nIn education, assessment includes events, tools, processes, and decisions used to gather information about learning. Well-designed assessment practices allow teachers to identify learning patterns, to modify instruction and to meet the needs of learners.\n\nProgress Updates\n\nWhile instructors will assess you on an ongoing basis throughout the course, you will receive written feedback on your overall progress at four check-in points during the course. The first three are called Progress Updates, and the last is the Final Report.\n\nEach Progress Update and the Final Report include:\n\nCandidate self-reflection forms\n\nRubric of Professional Learning\n\nFeedback from the instructor\n\nAfter each Progress Update, as well as for the Final Report, instructors will provide you with a Rubric of Professional Learning using the feedback feature in the corresponding Dropbox folder. They may also provide you with additional ongoing written feedback as you progress through the course.\n\n*Note that given the timing of the first Progress Update, it is expected that not all criteria will be highlighted.\n\nThe Rubric of Professional Learning addresses the following four categories: knowledge and understanding, thinking, communication and application.\n\nThese are the same assessment areas for student learning at Elementary and Secondary levels across all subject areas and disciplines in Ontario. They are defined in the table below.\n\nExplaining Rubric Categories\n\nKnowledge and Understanding\n\nCandidates demonstrate their knowledge and understanding when they:\n\nprovide evidence of course-specific content in their work\n\nidentify facts, terms, definitions, techniques, elements and/or principles through the various tasks and assignments\n\nmake sense of concepts, ideas, and practices through description, opinion, elaboration, and reference to other resources found in or outside of the course\n\nThinking\n\nAnalyzing, inferring, evaluating, and synthesizing are central to critical and creative thinking. Thinking is evident when candidates:\n\ngo beyond summarizing course content and demonstrate critical and creative thinking skills and/or processes\n\nexplain opinions, link them to course content, and analyze them for implications in practice\n\nnote consistencies and inconsistencies in field of study by drawing on ideas from other candidates or related resources\n\nCommunication\n\nThe goal of communication is to foster a collaborative community of learners. Candidates accomplish this when they:\n\ncommunicate ideas with audience and purpose in mind\n\nconvey meaning and ideas clearly and in an organized fashion\n\nactively engage in discussions by posting and responding to others in a thoughtful and timely manner\n\nApplication\n\nApplication refers to candidates' ability to use knowledge by putting ideas into action. Candidates accomplish this when they:\n\nmake connections to personal experiences and to others' ideas\n\nrefer to additional resources, such as scholarly articles, book titles, and related websites, as supporting evidence for an idea\n\nreport, relate, and adapt ideas by providing commentary or links to sources that facilitate collaborative learning\n\nAssigning a Grade\n\nThe Rubric of Professional Learning is converted into a final grade using the grid below.\n\nRubric of Professional Learning A+ All criteria at the excellent level. A 7 or more criteria achieved at the excellent level with 3 or fewer at the competent level. No criteria can be at the beginning or developing level. B+ 7 or more criteria achieved at the competent level or above with 3 or fewer at the developing level. No criteria can be at the beginning level. Fail Any criteria achieved that do not meet the requirements for A or B+.\n\nLate assignments\n\nAdditional Qualification Courses are designed so that candidates work through the same modules at the same time. All assignments will be accepted up to the due dates identified in the course outline. Although assignment submissions to instructors need to be uploaded by the module's due date, Discussion Board tasks must be completed within the time frame of the specific module, allowing candidates enough time to read and respond to each other's posts.\n\nCandidates who are unable to meet the due dates for any assignment due to extenuating circumstances, must request additional time from the instructor. Extensions are given at the discretion of the instructor. Candidates who do not request extensions and who make more than one late posting on the Discussion Board or submit more than one late assignment cannot be considered for an A+ grade in the course.\n\nPlease note that a candidate who has completed less than 75% of the required work by the end of the course will not be eligible for an extension and will receive an automatic Fail.\n\nResubmissions of assignments\n\nCandidates who receive a Beginning level in any Progress Update must communicate with the instructor for further instruction on improving their level in the course. This process will usually involve resubmission of the assignment(s).\n\nCandidates who receive a Fail grade at the end the course may appeal by following CTE's Appeal Process."
