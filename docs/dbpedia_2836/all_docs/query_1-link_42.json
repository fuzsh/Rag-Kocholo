        "text": "What Is Professional Misconduct in Teaching? What Do I Do If I am being investigated by the Ontario College of Teachers?\n\nEach year there are hundreds of complaints of Ontario teacher misconduct and resulting investigations by the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) investigation committee. But just because you are accused of professional misconduct does not mean you are guilty – retaining lawyers for teachers early is critical to protecting your professional licence and reputation. But first, we need to establish what is professional misconduct in teaching – what qualifies and what are your options once accused.\n\nWhat Is Professional Misconduct in Teaching?\n\nWhat is professional misconduct in teaching?\n\nEssentially, Ontario teacher misconduct is any act that runs afoul of the defined professional misconduct designations in subsection 30 (20) of the Ontario College of Teachers Act.\n\nMore specifically, see the bottom of the post for a detailed list of acts that constitute professional misconduct.\n\nFacing Investigation by the OCT? Professional Discipline Lawyers for Teachers Are Vital\n\nIf a complaint is made against you by either a third party of the OCT itself, the College will begin an investigation into the complaint. The investigation is undertaken by the Investigation Committee. Learn more about the OCT investigation process.\n\nShould the complaint be successful and you be found guilty of professional misconduct, you may face the following disciplinary decisions:\n\nThe revocation of your certificate\n\nThe suspension of your certificate for up to two years\n\nThe imposition of terms, conditions or limitations on your certificate\n\nThe imposition of a time period throughout which the teacher is ineligible for reinstatement\n\nMandatory counselling\n\nFines of up to $5,000\n\nFurthermore, depending on the outcome of the complaint (and the type of complaint), there is a possibility that information gleaned during the hearing can be used in a criminal proceeding (again, only if warranted).\n\nIn other words, the stakes are high. Your professional life could be significantly impaired by a successful complaint.\n\nProfessional discipline lawyers for teachers are able to support you through the process and mount a forceful defence against the complaint. An experienced professional discipline lawyer will leverage knowledge of the OCT and its proceedings, expert witnesses, sharp legal knowledge, and more to protect your rights in the event of an investigation.\n\nYour professional discipline lawyer for teachers can help if you’re subject to an Ontario teacher misconduct investigation by:\n\nAdvising you on the relevant standards, legislation, etc, in addition to compliance\n\nResponding to Ontario teacher misconduct complaints from the OCT\n\nRepresenting you at a disciplinary hearings\n\nUsing the complaint resolution process to address the complaint\n\nRepresenting you in front of the Division Court of Ontario\n\nAnd more.\n\nIf you are under investigation, it is critical to seek our legal counsel as soon as possible to ensure you have the best possible chance of achieving a positive outcome – as well as avoid releasing sensitive information that could be then leveraged against you in a potential criminal proceeding (only if the complaint involves potentially criminal acts).\n\nWhat Happens During a Disciplinary Hearing\n\nIf you’re a teacher in Ontario and you have been referred to the Discipline Committee or the Fitness to Practise Committee, then working with a professional discipline lawyer is in your best interest.\n\nTeacher performance, records of the complaint, the teacher’s history with the district school board, and more can all come into play. Once you receive a notice of an investigation or a notice of hearing, working with a legal professional will help you achieve the best possible outcome.\n\nReach the Best Possible Outcome in Your Ontario Teacher Misconduct Investigation with an Experienced Professional Discipline Lawyer\n\nUnified LLP can begin helping you from the first moment you receive notice that you are under investigation by the OCT – working to resolve the complaint swiftly and successfully.\n\nAt Unified LLP, our team of professional and experienced lawyers for teachers in Toronto deliver quality legal counsel for every step of the OCT complaint process; get peace of mind that you are being defended by legal professionals.
