        "text": "Last updated: September 2023\n\n\"IT manager job\" gets 1,900 Google searches per month. \"Software engineering job\" gets 12,100. The job search is on and IT experts are in high demand across all industries. It makes sense why — a well-organized IT team is critical to business success. You provide the services, software, and resources that fuel the organization.\n\nIf you are just getting started in IT, it can be tricky to discern the differences among the various job titles. Some roles are more strategic, while others are tactical. Many teams are also hiring technical product managers to help IT align its work with the company's business objectives.\n\nSet up an IT workspace in Aha! Roadmaps.

And the roles in each area can be strategic, tactical, or a mix of both.\n\nArchitecture job titles\n\nIT architecture teams determine how IT services, solutions, and infrastructure should be built.
