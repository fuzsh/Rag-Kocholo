        "text": "Teacher jobs in Canada are desirable career paths for locals and newcomers moving to the country. The education system is one of the best in the world. The teacher salary in Canada is also one of the highest in the world. However, most provinces and territories have a shortage of qualified teachers, and they are looking for newcomers and internationally trained teachers to fill these roles.\n\nGreat opportunities are available if you’re an experienced teacher in your home country, have recently qualified as a teacher abroad, or want to pursue a teaching career in Canada,\n\nIf you plan to work as a teacher in Canada, it’s critical to understand the employment and job requirements before you arrive. Many jobs in Canada belong to regulated professions. And teaching is one of those professions. Newcomers to Canada often discover that they struggle to find work in their chosen profession after they arrive. This also applies to teachers who will have to get their international qualifications recognized and gain Canadian teaching experience.\n\nWhat’s the best way to prepare for a teaching career in Canada? Continue reading for a helpful overview.\n\nHow to Immigrate to Canada as a Teacher\n\nBefore You Move to Pursue Teaching in Canada\n\nThere is much to know about teaching in Canada. Before you arrive, it’s important to research the Canadian labour market and job requirements for teachers. It’s also essential to know how your international qualifications will be assessed. This information will help you make important decisions based on the amount of time, cost, and other factors that will allow you to teach in Canada.\n\nThere are steps that you can take to improve your chances of landing a teaching job when you arrive:\n\nResearch the labour market demand for teachers in Canada at the national, provincial, and municipal levels.\n\nContact the regulatory body for teachers in the province where you intend to settle in Canada to learn about the licensing process.\n\nLearn what process steps you can take before and after you arrive.\n\nVerify what documents you need to bring to Canada and whether they need to be translated. You may have to use a professional translation service in Canada.\n\nGather and organize your official education, work, and identity documents while still in your home country.\n\nAssess your language skills by taking an online self-assessment on the Centre for Canadian Language Benchmarks website.\n\nImprove your language skills and enroll in language classes while you are in your home country and continue them when you arrive in Canada. You’ll need to prove your English or French language competency (depending on your destination province) or be tested.\n\nUnderstand the teaching practice in Canada and familiarize yourself with the laws and legislation that govern teaching in the province where you will settle.\n\nCheck with the professional association that governs teaching in your home country and find out if they have any links with similar associations in Canada.\n\nWhat to Expect When Pursuing a Career in Teaching in Canada\n\nThere are many career paths you can pursue in the teaching profession. Some are more in demand than others. Understanding the current job market and employment outlook for the short term and long term will help you set realistic expectations.\n\nEmployment Outlook for Teacher Jobs in Canada\n\nThere is a shortage of teachers at all levels of education in Canada. There are not enough trained teachers to meet the needs of schools across the country. Provinces are welcoming internationally trained teachers to move to Canada. This situation makes it easier for newcomers to find jobs once they arrive.\n\nThere are jobs available at the primary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. There are also opportunities to work in private schools and as substitute teachers. Working as a substitute may be a good option to gain experience while getting your teaching credentials once you move to Canada. There is greater demand for teachers in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.\n\nStart Your Research with the NOC Code for Teachers\n\nWhere should you start looking for teacher jobs in Canada? The National Occupational Classification (NOC) is Canada’s reference for occupations. It provides job descriptions, occupational statistics, and labour market information. You can search by education level. The NOC codes for teachers are:\n\nUniversity professors and lecturers (NOC 41200)\n\nSecondary School Teachers (NOC 21220)\n\nElementary School and kindergarten teachers (NOC 41221)\n\nThe NOC code provides example titles for teachers. These are titles that you can search for when conducting your job search.\n\nRequirements to Become a Teacher in Canada\n\nIn Canada, regulatory bodies in each province or territory set the requirements to practice teaching. And while the requirements can vary by jurisdiction, you will require a bachelor’s degree in education and a provincial teaching certificate.\n\nFor example, if you want to teach in Ontario, the Ontario College of Teachers requires you to:\n\nComplete a minimum three-year postsecondary degree from an acceptable postsecondary institution\n\nComplete a four-semester teacher education program\n\nApply to the College for certification and pay the annual membership and registration fees\n\nComplete the sexual abuse prevention program.\n\nIf you intend to specialize in special education or instruction of English or French as a second language, you may require additional training and certification.\n\nUnlike elementary and secondary teaching, teaching at the university or college level is not regulated. It’s up to the hiring department or institution to recognize your academic credentials obtained outside Canada. University teaching positions are competitive and normally they require that you have at least one graduate degree and a proven teaching record or academic publishing.\n\nCredentials Recognition to Meet Teaching Job Requirements in Canada\n\nOne of the first things to do is learn what’s required to work as a teacher in Canada. This will allow you to identify if you meet the requirements, or what steps to take to meet them. A good place to start is with the regulatory body that governs the teaching profession in the province or territory where you intend to settle in Canada. They will advise you about the documents you need to provide as well as assessment fees.\n\nIt’s important to take this step before you arrive in Canada. It’s also important to understand the licensure process and what the regulatory body expects of you. Once you have all the information, then you can begin the application process.\n\nCredentials Assessment Services\n\nIf you plan to enroll in a college or university program to upgrade your skills, contact the school that you plan to attend to inquire about the steps you should take and the credential assessment agency you should use.\n\nWorld Education Services (WES) – Ontario\n\nInternational Qualifications Assessment Service (IQAS) – Alberta\n\nThe International Credential Evaluation Service (ICES) – British Columbia\n\nTo find more organizations and agencies providing credential evaluation, assessment and qualification recognition services click here.\n\nUpgrading Your Skills to Meet Teaching Job Requirements\n\nIn addition to accreditation, upgrading your skills through a bridging program or other courses and workshops is an important part of your journey to becoming a teacher in Canada.\n\nYou may have strong teaching skills, but often that is not enough to get a job or maintain it afterward. You may need more training or skills upgrading, especially concerning your soft skills.\n\nEmployers in Canada expect you to be a good communicator and organized. They want you to know how to train a child, listen strategically, motivate students, praise a student appropriately, and give helpful feedback for others’ work.\n\nHaving strong skills in one or both of Canada’s official languages, English or French, is important for your future in Canada. Whether you choose to focus on learning or improving English or French will depend on which of the two languages most people speak in the area where you live.\n\nYou may be eligible for Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) program. Otherwise, you can find other free or affordable classes in English as a Second Language (ESL) or French as a Second Language (FSL) classes through school boards or settlement agencies.\n\nThere are even language courses to teach you professional terminology, such as job-specific language training and Occupation Specific Language Training (OSLT). And if you already speak one of Canada’s two official languages at a high level, learning the other one is a good option, as it may offer you better employment opportunities.\n\nBridging Programs for Teaching Careers in Canada\n\nBridging programs are an effective way to transition from your international experience and training to the Canadian workplace. Many colleges, universities, and immigrant-serving agencies offer teaching-related bridging programs. You may be eligible for one. Do some research to find a program suitable for you. Two popular bridging programs are in Alberta and Ontario:\n\nAlberta\n\nUniversity of Calgary\n\nBridge to Teaching\n\nThe Bridge to Teaching (Bridge) program is an intensive and accelerated teacher education program that prepares passionate, caring and experienced foreign-trained teachers to teach in Alberta Schools. During the Bridge Program, participants focus on how to teach the Alberta Program of Studies in ways that engage students and how to assess students’ learning. Participants examine various educational policies and pedagogies that affect teaching and learning in Alberta and explore how the expectations for teachers and students compare to those in their previous country.\n\nOntario\n\nGeorge Brown College\n\nCollege Teachers Training (Graduate Certificate)\n\nThe College Teachers Training for Internationally Educated Professionals Program provides occupation-specific communication and employment skills and training and experience in the Canadian classroom. It prepares internationally educated teachers to teach in the Canadian college environment. The program offers opportunities to network with college teachers and potential employers and provides opportunities to gain experience in the Canadian classroom.\n\nTeachers College and Schools in Canada by Province\n\nPost-secondary institutions across Canada offer teacher education programs. Below is a list of the top teacher colleges and schools in Canada:\n\nTeaching Associations in Canada\n\nThe associations listed below provide information about licensure and certification.

They also provide professional development opportunities such as workshops, training, and connections to job opportunities.\n\nHow Much Do Teachers Make in Canada?\n\nTeacher salaries in Canada are some of the highest in the world. They rank third overall, only behind Luxembourg and Germany. How much you make depends on many factors such as your province, experience, teaching level, and specialization. Most newcomer teachers have a higher salary in Canada compared to their home country.\n\nWages are typically higher in the territories (Nunavut, Yukon, Northwest) because of the challenges in hiring qualified teachers and the higher cost of living.\n\nTeacher salary in Canada (primary teacher)\n\nHere are the latest primary school teacher salaries in Canada:\n\nTeacher salary in Canada (High school teacher)\n\nHere are the latest high school teacher salaries in Canada:\n\nTeacher Salary in Canada by Major City\n\nWhere you choose to live will have an impact on your average annual teacher salary.

It will be helpful to focus on the provinces and cities that are seeing population growth. There will be a higher demand for teachers in areas with population growth.\n\nThe figures from the last census in 2021 show that of the 10 fastest-growing census metropolitan areas in Canada, four are in Ontario, and two each are in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec. Other areas to focus on and where the shortage of teachers will be more severe are the historically underserved northern and rural areas of the country.

Include completion dates or expected completion dates.\n\nExperience\n\nBreak this section into separate subheadings such as teaching and related work experience. Experience can be paid or unpaid; including internships, observation experience, classroom management skills/strategies, teaching methods used, experience with students with functional needs, and interactions with parents.\n\nList your teaching experiences in reverse chronological order.\n\nUse action verbs and specific details such as grade levels taught, class size, and any other information that will help a reader visualize you in that experience. Include the job title, name of the school, and dates for each position.\n\nThe following are strengths and experiences you might consider including in your resume if they apply to you:\n\nexperience with kids\n\ncoaching\n\nbabysitting\n\nteaching swimming lessons, skiing, or any subject or area of interest\n\nmanagement roles as they pertain to training\n\ntraining in any area or subject, public speaking, acting experience as it applies to teaching,\n\nart experience as it applies to teaching\n\nmusic experience as it applies to teaching.\n\nPassion\n\nMake sure you demonstrate your passion for teaching by adding your teaching philosophy to your resume. And communicate your commitment to student success, teaching, and learning.\n\nCredentials\n\nYou are in the education business, so it makes sense that you use a resume strategy that highlights your academic credentials. So, include your credentials, certifications, and degrees on the first page under your opening resume profile. You can mention your most important teaching credentials in your qualification summary, which can be part of your objective field.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nA teacher’s resume must have strong accomplishments. Especially as a newcomer, you can include accomplishments from back home or in Canada. You can include your practicum/intern/volunteer experience and treat it just like a job on your resume.\n\nOther things you can list as accomplishments include delivering in-service training workshops for teacher colleagues, developing after-school programs or extracurricular activities, or having expertise in particular teaching methods or approaches.\n\nSpecific Resume Keywords\n\nIncluding keywords specific to the teaching job you want can help your resume stand out. It can also help your resume pass through applicant tracking systems and resume screening. You can get ideas for the keyword to include from the job advertisement and by researching the responsibilities of the teaching job.\n\nSome important keywords that could apply to your applicant are teaching and learning, curriculum development, curriculum planning, curriculum design, creative lesson planning, classroom management, classroom monitoring, interdisciplinary teaching approaches, or K-12.\n\nCreate A Teaching Portfolio\n\nIt’s helpful to bring samples of your work to job interviews, so creating your teacher portfolio can help you succeed in interviews. Your portfolio shows what you bring to the teaching job. You can include your resume, letters of recommendation, sample syllabi, and lesson plans in your portfolio.\n\nInterview Techniques to Ensure You Meet Teaching Job Requirements\n\nOnce you are invited to attend an interview, you need to prepare. Use your self-inventory and your research about teaching in Canada to show how you are a perfect fit for the role. Prepare to answer questions with clear examples, like the way you prepare to lead a classroom.\n\nYou may be interviewed by a school team consisting of the principal, vice-principal, and one or two staff members, or you may be interviewed at the board level by a panel of interviewers. It’s important to show confidence during your interview, so practicing your answers is very important!\n\nIf you show any shyness or hesitancy, it could create doubt about your teaching ability. Be sure to reflect your interest in students and their needs when you respond to questions. Show that you hold yourself responsible for improving the social and academic achievement of your students. The interviewers will be listening for consistency between what you are saying and the information you included in your cover letter and resume. Clearly show how you meet the requirements to teach in Canada.\n\nSample Interview Questions for Teaching Jobs\n\nBelow are sample questions that you may be asked during teaching job interviews:\n\nWhat is your educational philosophy?\n\nHow would you prepare to make a difficult phone call to a parent?\n\nDescribe a teaching strategy you used to maximize the learning potential of all students.\n\nDescribe any multicultural, gender-fair classroom practices you have used in the past and how you would ensure equality among your students.\n\nHow would you take advantage of resources within the community to enhance your teaching?\n\nHow do you use technology to enhance student learning?\n\nDescribe how you would prepare to teach a large amount of material. (Hint: Show a sample curriculum or discuss how you would use a curriculum map that includes learning objectives, assessments, activities, and standards)\n\nWhat are educational issues or trends affecting elementary teaching? (For elementary teachers)\n\nOf course, there are many other questions that you need to prepare for. Consider as well familiarizing yourself with the latest news or research about the student population of the school you are applying to. If you are applying for a position as a 3rd-grade math teacher, for example, there may be recent developments in teaching math to this age group that will be relevant to your teaching philosophy.\n\nLearning about these developments and integrating them into the conversation will demonstrate your knowledge of relevant teaching methods, and commitment to teaching and distinguish you from the other candidates.\n\nInformational Interviews to Learn About Teaching in Canada\n\nAn informational interview is a brief (20–30-minute) meeting with someone who currently works in teaching. Your goal is to learn more about teaching in Canada. You should not try to get a job during an informational interview but find out whether a particular position might be a good fit for your interests and your personality.\n\nAn informational interview with a contact from your network can be an excellent source of career information. In addition to gathering information about teaching, you also learn about the teacher’s first-hand experiences and insights on teaching job requirements in Canada.\n\nNetworking to Find Teacher Jobs in Canada\n\nAs many job vacancies are not advertised, it’s helpful to connect with practicing teachers and others within your field. Building networks is an activity that can help you discover job leads and gather vital information about teaching in Canada. When you network with others, you also get insights about teaching in general or specific schools that you would like to work at. This information can serve to strengthen your resume, cover letter, and interview skills. Meeting with others is also a terrific way to expand your professional network.\n\nGood places to network include conferences, associations, and other events where you can meet new people, build relationships, and share information.\n\nLinkedIn is another important professional tool for networking. It is great to connect with former colleagues and employers, search for jobs, and get introductions and recommendations. You can also mingle with people in the teaching sector and join related professional groups.\n\nNote that it’s not appropriate to ask a networking contact for a job, but if they know of any job leads, they may share them. Remember, that you must allow time to cultivate and grow the ties you establish through networking.\n\nGet more great tips for successful networking: Build Your Professional Network Before You Arrive.\n\nWith a positive outlook for teaching jobs in Canada, now is the time to check out your options.
