        "text": "The Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers (the College) has received a number of inquiries regarding the correct use of titles and designations. The following information is intended to clarify which titles and designations members may use.\n\nProtected titles\n\nIn Ontario, the following protected titles and designations, their abbreviations and French equivalents can only be used by, or in reference to, individuals registered with the College.\n\nSocial worker\n\nRegistered social worker\n\nSocial service worker\n\nRegistered social service worker\n\nIt is illegal for an individual to use any of these protected titles without being registered.\n\nSome individuals may have a bachelor or master’s degree in social work, or a diploma in social service work but are not registered with the College. These individuals may list or refer to their degree or diploma but they are not permitted to use any of the protected titles unless they are a registered member of the College.\n\nTitles that cannot be used in Ontario\n\nThe Registration Regulation O. Reg. 383/00 made under the Social Work and Social Service Work Act (SWSSWA) sets out only two categories of registration: social work and social service work. Therefore, none of the following titles, abbreviations or variations can be used in Ontario:\n\nClinical social worker\n\nRegistered clinical social worker or RCSW\n\nLicensed clinical social worker or LCSW\n\nMembers must not refer to themselves using any of the above titles with clients, employers, on LinkedIn, or in any other digital or print publication.\n\nSome provinces, such as Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan, do have a distinct registration category for “clinical social worker” that is different from “registered social worker.” In these jurisdictions, clinical social workers in this category hold advanced clinical certifications and/or meet other requirements that permit them to use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) independently in order to make a mental health diagnosis. For more information, visit the Canadian Association of Social Workers website. These titles are also often used by social workers regulated in the United States.\n\nResponsibility of Members\n\nMany members list themselves in digital publications such as Psychology Today to advertise their practice. When these publications are based in other jurisdictions, they may only offer options such as “clinical social worker” that are not recognized titles in Ontario.\n\nAs part of the College’s ongoing public awareness initiatives, a letter was sent to Psychology Today informing them that the title “clinical social worker” is not permitted under our governing legislation. Going forward, when a member signs up to advertise their services with Psychology Today, their title will be changed to “registered social worker” before their posting goes up, so that members can advertise in compliance with the SWSSWA and regulations. Additionally, the Psychology Today verification team will strive to correct profiles as they come across them. Because this will not be done automatically, however, it remains a member’s responsibility to contact the digital publication and request that their title and designation be changed to “registered social worker” or “registered social service worker”.

Again, it is a member’s responsibility to inform their employer and to have their title and designation corrected.\n\nHelpful Practice Resources\n\nCollege members are encouraged to consult the following webpages and practice resources for more information on title protection:\n\nTitle protection fact sheet\n\nQ&A: Use of the title “clinical social worker”\n\nUse of title and holding out provisions\n\nTitles and designations\n\nUnregulated practitioners"
