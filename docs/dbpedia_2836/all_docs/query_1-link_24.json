        "text": "Michigan has signed an Interstate Compact Agreement (ICA) with every state agreeing to accept out-of-state approved teacher preparation programs and standard teaching certificates on a reciprocal basis for initial certification. Out-of-state certification programs and credentials may differ from Michigan programs and credentials; however, under the ICA, the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) attempts to match out-of-state certificates, grade levels and content endorsements as closely as possible. Even with reciprocity, Michigan certification is not guaranteed, and ancillary state requirements exist in Michigan law (e.g., testing).\n\nTo determine certification eligibility, an application must be submitted using the Michigan Online Educator Certification System (MOECS). Supporting documents need to be provided, and an online processing fee must be paid prior to evaluation of the application. Accurate answers to application questions will prompt our licensing system to determine the certificate type (Standard or Professional) being applied. Educators may check the status of an application by logging into MOECS anytime.\n\nTeacher preparation programs and teaching certificates from other countries and federally recognized Indian tribes are also accepted for certification with equivalent endorsements assuming all certification requirements are met. For additional guidance, please view the video Selecting and Completing Teacher Certification Programs from Other States.\n\nStandard Teaching Certificate\n\nTo qualify for the Standard Teaching Certificate, the educator must meet the requirements listed below.\n\nProgram and Certificate Requirement\n\nAn applicant who has completed an approved teacher preparation program including student teaching in another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe can submit an application to be evaluated for certification.\n\nOR\n\nAn applicant who has completed an alternative route teacher certification program in another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe and holds a valid or expired standard certificate may submit an application to be evaluated. This is not applicable to applicants who have temporary, preliminary, or interim teaching certificates from other states, countries, or federally recognized Indian tribes.\n\nSource: NASDTEC Interstate Compact Agreement signed in accordance with Teacher Certification Code R 390.1130 Reciprocity\n\nTesting Requirement\n\nAfter an application evaluation, the educator will be emailed a MOECS evaluation letter specifying the appropriate test that must be passed Michigan Tests for Teacher Certification (MTTC). The educator cannot be advised on specific testing requirements prior to applying and being evaluated by MDE.\n\nThree (3) years of successful teaching experience matching the validity of their standard teaching certificate from another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe since it was initially issued may be accepted in lieu of the test.\n\nSource: Section 1531(2) of Public Act 451 (1976) as amended, MCL 380.1531(2)\n\nTemporary Teaching Certificate\n\nIf the applicant holds a valid, standard teaching certificate from another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe, the applicant can be issued a nonrenewable Temporary Teaching Certificate (TTC) that may lead to employment in a Michigan school for up to one year. During that time, the educator will complete the required test(s). The educator does not apply for the TTC; however, the TTC is granted as part of the application process for the Standard Teaching Certificate application, assuming the educator meets the requirements.\n\nSource: Section 1531(13) of Public Act 451 (1976) as amended, MCL 380.1531(13)\n\nProfessional Teaching Certificate\n\nIf an applicant meets all requirements as noted below for the Professional Teaching Certificate, they can be evaluated for the Professional as their initial Michigan Teaching Certificate. Applicants who qualify for the Professional certificate as their initial Michigan certificate are exempt from testing.\n\nProgram Requirement\n\nAn applicant who has completed an approved teacher preparation program including student teaching in another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe can submit an application to be evaluated for certification.'\n\nOR\n\nAn applicant who has completed an alternative route teacher certification program in another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe and holds a valid or expired standard certificate may submit an application to be evaluated. This is not applicable to applicants who have temporary, preliminary, or interim teaching certificates from other states, countries, or federally recognized Indian tribes.\n\nTeaching Experience Requirement\n\nThe applicant must have three (3) years of successful teaching experience matching the validity of their standard teaching certificate from another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe since it was initially issued. Teaching experience must be documented on the Michigan Department of Education - Work Experience Report Form for teachers. Experience teaching under a permit, temporary certificate, or non-renewable certificate does not count for meeting the experience requirement for the professional certificate.\n\nCertificate Requirement\n\nThe applicant must hold a valid or expired standard certificate from another state, country, or federally recognized Indian tribe in the subject area(s) and grade levels for which they are seeking Michigan certification.\n\nReading Methods Requirement\n\nApplicants must have six (6) semester credit hours of reading methods if elementary certified or three (3) semester credit hours of reading methods if secondary certified.\n\nSource: Teacher Certification Code R 390.1133, Rule 33(c).\n\nTemporary Teaching Certificate\n\nApplicants who meet all of the Professional Teaching Certificate requirements, except for the reading methods requirement, can be issued a nonrenewable Temporary Teaching Certificate (TTC) that authorizes their employment in a Michigan school for one year. The Professional Teaching Certificate will be issued after receipt of an official transcript verifying the reading credits if the educator still has an active application for certification.\n\nSource: Teacher Certification Code R 390.1130, Rule 30(6)."
