        "text": "We are committed to fostering the development of teachers who can meaningfully and effectively meet the diverse needs of today’s K-12 students. Students in our programs consistently exceed New York state requirements for teacher certification. Performance on these exams is just one way we evaluate our success in preparing students for their futures as exceptional educators. Our graduates see high certification and employment rates, and leave the program ready to enter the job market and begin their careers.\n\nOur well-established partnerships with local schools allow students the opportunity for varied and numerous placements beginning their first semester. This means our students develop impressive instructional skills as they progress through their field experience and prepare for student teaching. Additionally, the Academic Complex features model classrooms, cutting-edge instructional technology, teaching labs, counseling observation rooms, and a family literacy center. Our students gain classroom experience from the very beginning – that’s the Niagara Advantage.\n\nDr. Dennis Garland, associate professor of education at Niagara University, received the Community Partner Award at the Developmental Disabilities Alliance of WNY’s 36th Annual Development Disabilities Awareness Day conference on May 21, 2024. The award recognizes an individual or group working in the community that has gone the “extra mile” to help enrich the lives of people with developmental disabilities.\n\nDr. Garland was honored for his work with the university’s Special Olympics: Coaching and Games Management course, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the colleges of Education and Hospitality, Sport and Tourism Management."
