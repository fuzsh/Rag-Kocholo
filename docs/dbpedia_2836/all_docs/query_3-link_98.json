An MSN program can help prepare you for such leadership roles as director of nursing or executive director of nursing services.2 A master’s degree in nursing is also a great choice because it usually has a number of specializations, allowing you to pursue a focused area of expertise such as:\n\nIf you’re worried about finding the time to attend nursing school, online learning can provide the solution. When you enroll in a master’s in nursing program at an online university, you don’t have to upend your life to earn your degree. Instead, through an online MSN program, you can complete your coursework on a flexible online platform that lets you continue working full time.\n\nEarning a master’s in nursing online is a particularly good choice if you have completed an RN program. Not only will an online nursing school allow you to fit your education around your shifts, it can give you the opportunity to go straight from RN to MSN. With an RN to MSN online program, you don’t have to earn your Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) separately. Instead, it is incorporated into the program. Of course, there are RN to BSN online programs, too. Regardless of which program you choose, nursing is a field with a wide range of unique—and often readily available—nursing careers, making an online nursing program a great choice.\n\nWalden University is No. 1 in Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) graduates in the United States.3. In addition, Walden University is an accredited institution offering an online Master of Science in Nursing degree program. Expand your career options and earn your degree in a convenient, flexible format that fits your busy life.\n\n1Source: www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/registered-nurses.htm\n\n2Source: Career options may require additional experience, training, or other factors beyond the successful completion of this degree program.\n\n3Source: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) IPEDS database.
