        "text": "Recent decades have seen the rise of a modern publishing phenomenon: mass public participation in the production and consumption of various forms of Life Writing. Biography has been „democratised‟. The growth and diversity in the informal production of Biography underlines the confidence with which it is produced, effectually a statement that “my life is worth telling too.” Similarly the commercially produced biographical product is subject to media and public scrutiny as never before, dissected for factuality and fairness. There is an expectation that a subject, or a subject‟s friends, enemies, or relatives, have a right of reply to the printed word. The challenge to academics and biographers then, is to admit that the authorial voice is not tenured, and that a greater collaborative approach must be taken which shares power over the writing of a life.\n\nPrepublication of the introductory article of an issue of _Cercles, revue pluridisciplinaire d&#39;études anglophones_. The biographical turn, as we find convenient to call the renewed interest in biography and biographic approaches that has been taking place over the last decades, converging from several disciplines of the humanities, appears like a paradigmatic debate of sorts, that both calls for a new definition of biography in the larger sense of the term, and generates a theoretical demand.This article positions biographical studies within the perimeter of life-writing considered as an emerging crossroads discipline in the humanities. It analyses some of the causes of the so-called &quot;resistance to theory&quot; of biography. It argues that the very reappraisal of the central concept of the subject operated by the philosophy of deconstruction and analytic philosophy has entailed the emergence of life-writing, and created the intellectual need to theorize biography in this la...\n\nIn Shakespeare's Hamlet (Act 2, Scene 2), a play from Greek mythology is performed at Elsinore. Hamlet wonders how an actor can so convincingly express the grief of Hecuba for her dead husband, thinking: \"What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he should weep for her?\" The story prompts insight and an emotional awakening in Hamlet-a turning point in the development of the young prince. Hamlet resolves to tell a different story and present a different play for the audience. His new confidence requires a different narrative. In this book, the editors have put together a collection of different perspectives on biographical research in three sections, reflecting the book's title: Discourses, Dialogue and Diversity-in Biographical Research. A layered understanding of biography is articulated and involves connecting personal and individual biographies (the micro level), with interpersonal connections (the meso level) and broader social concerns (the macro level). The book aims to \"generate insight into people's fears and anxieties but also their capacity to keep on keeping on and to challenge forces that would diminish our humanity\" (p. 2). The collection is a product of the lively Network on Life History and Biography (LHB) of the European Society for Research on the Education of Adults (ESREA), and the majority of contributions have associations with the \"Canterbury School of Biographical Research\" (my moniker). Discourses Laura Formenti and Linden West open the section on Discourses in Chapter 1, where they insightfully explore the Hamlet-inspired (?) question: \"What is Lake Erie to us, or we to Lake Erie?\" (p. 23). They eloquently connect biography with broader social issues, especially the impact of neoliberal capitalism. These powerful social"
