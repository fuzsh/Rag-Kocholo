Mostly, Rowley concentrates on telling Wright’s very powerful story.”\n\n“Splendid. . . . Richard Wright is well written, prodigiously researched, and nicely paced, a compelling evocation of the man, his craft, and the different worlds through which he moved.”\n\n“A welcome and illuminating work . . . [Rowley] does an outstanding job. . . . Rich and revealing.”"
