        "text": "By Hannah Wright | On August 14, 2012 | Updated February 29, 2024 | Comments (2)\n\nChristina Stead (July 17, 1902 – March 31, 1983) was an Australian-born novelist, short story writer, and Journalist born into a Socialist family.\n\nHer masterful writing went unrecognized for much of her life. Her most notable work is The Man Who Loved Children.\n\nEarly Life\n\nStead’s mother, Ellen, died when she was only two years old. For a while, Stead enjoyed the close bond as an only child to a widower father, David Stead. Her father was a passionate naturalist who told wild and vivid stories imparting his wonder for the natural world onto Christina.\n\nShe described of her early childhood in a 1968 article in the Kenyon Review:\n\n“I was the first child of a lively young scientist who loved his country and zoology. My mother died – he mothered me. I went to bed early and with the light falling from the streetlamp through the open slats of the venetian blind he, with one foot on the rather strange bed I had, told his tales. He meant to talk me to sleep; he talked me awake.”\n\nThings did not go on like this forever. Her father remarried twice and had five more children. Stead took on the partial responsibility of raising her siblings and grew unhappy in her home life. She went to college, then worked as a teacher and secretary. Eventually, she set out to forge a life of her own away from Australia.\n\nEarly Career and Marriage\n\nStead moved to London at age twenty-six, where she fell in love with Jewish-American novelist and economist William J. Blake. Together they traveled around Europe, settling in Paris from 1929 to 1935.\n\nParis suited her well – this period was productive and full of wonder. She described the city as “pearl of delicacy, brilliance and suavity,” and is quoted as saying Paris is the “capital of the modern world.”\n\nShe spoke several languages including French, German, and Yiddish, which she likely picked up during her travels.\n\nWhile living in Paris, Stead worked a variety of jobs, including a secretarial position at Travelers Bank. There, she gained insight into the tumultuous 1930s financial market. This experience, in addition to the rise of fascism and political unrest in Europe at the time, informed her novel House of All Nations (1938).\n\nMove to the U.S.; Communist ideology\n\nIn the late 1930s the couple moved to the United States, both taking jobs as screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In addition, Stead taught novel writing at NYU, reviewed Australian novels for the New York Times, and contributed articles to New Masses – a communist journal. Her articles are still available to read online.\n\nStead held strong communist convictions, which influenced so much of her life’s work but was also likely the unfortunate reason she was overlooked as an author.\n\nFollowing World War II, tensions grew between United States and Soviet Union sparking the Cold War. Fear of communism and it’s threat to democracy grew. In 1938 the House Un-American Actives Committee was established as well as the Hollywood blacklist.\n\nStead and Blake returned to England in 1947 because to these growing anti-communist sentiments in the U.S.\n\nThe move to England was the beginning of a few terrible decades. She found the country to be uninspiring and gloomy. Her and Blake struggled to make ends meet. This dreary time in her life inspired her novel Cotters’ England (1966), set in post-war England.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . .\n\nThe Man Who Loved Children by Christina Stead\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nLater Life and Long Overdue Fame\n\nStead wrote fifteen novels and numerous short stories but didn’t gain the success she felt she deserved at the time. She was considered a misanthrope and unapproachable person who revealed little of herself even as she self-invented. She destroyed many of her personal papers, making it more difficult to preserve her legacy.\n\nFinally, in the 1960’s Stead began to receive recognition. In 1965, The Man Who Loved Children was reissued. Its success was in part due to an introduction written by Poet Randall Jarrell.\n\nWriter Saul Bellow is also partially responsible for her bringing her into the spotlight; 1976, he mentioned her in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.\n\nIn her works, the main characters were often based on herself, and the stories derived from her life. In her best-known work, The Man Who Loved Children, the father was based on her own, and the title is rather ironic.\n\nIn 2010 The Man Who Loved Children received positive recognition yet again after novelist and essayist Johnathan Franzen published an essay about the book in The New York Times.\n\nStead also addressed the negative impact of governments on societies.\n\nChristina Stead’s Legacy\n\nConsidered a masterful writer, Stead was also adept at self-concealment and re-invention. One of her most famous quotes is “Every human being is a sort of monster, if you get to know them.” Perhaps she was slyly referring to herself.\n\nIn the description in Christina Stead: A Biography (1995) by Hazel Rowley, she’s described:\n\n“An intensely private person and an incredibly cantankerous one, Stead lived a life that was stormy, eccentric, and brave. She was highly political and maddeningly contentions — few would call her easy in life or in fiction. And yet, in her life, her work was likened to that of Balzac, Joyce, Ibsen, and Tolstoy. But, in fact, it was uniquely her own.”\n\nShe returned to her native land of Australia in 1969 after the death of her husband. Upon her return she was honored with praise for her brilliant work. In 1974, she became the first person to receive the Patrick White Prize. White was the first Australian to receive a Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nStead spent the last year of her life in the home of the Australian doctor Helena Berenson, who took care of her even though they were practically strangers to one another. Christina Stead died in the spring of 1983, at the age of eighty.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . .\n\nMore about Christina Stead\n\nOn this site\n\nQuotes from a Curmudgeon\n\nMajor Works\n\nThe Man Who Loved Children\n\nLetty Fox: Her Luck\n\nPuzzleheaded Girl\n\nFor Love Alone\n\nCotters England\n\nI’m Dying Laughing: The Humorist\n\nMore information"
