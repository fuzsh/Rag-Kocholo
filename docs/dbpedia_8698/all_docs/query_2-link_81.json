        "text": "For much of the time I worked on my biography of David Foster Wallace I had no title. Then, in 2011, Alice Elman, the wife of the late writer Richard Elman, sent me copies of the letters David had written to Richard, with whom Wallace studied in the University of Arizona M.F.A. program. In a letter from 1986 I found the phrase “every love story is a ghost story.” I was smitten; it smote me. When you write a biography, there are moments when you feel that your subject is thinking things just for you to find them out.\n\nWhat does “every love story is a ghost story” mean? It captures, I think, the futility of Wallace’s quest. What writer ever had a more passionate affair with language? For him, a thing wasn’t alive if he couldn’t write it down. Living around the corner from Mary Karr, he still wrote to her. There’s a sheaf of correspondence between him and Don DeLillo, but they only met twice—for Wallace, DeLillo was best as a literary construct. The phrase also captures the particular, morbid work of the biographer, who doesn’t open up his or her laptop until the casket shuts. And then…then it just captures. I’ve always been drawn to those weird titles from the Spanish Golden Age, “Life is a Dream,” “The Great Theatre of the World.” A title should create an aura, invite a journey.\n\nI knew what I liked about “every love story is a ghost story” but I wasn’t sure what Wallace did. Curiously, it’s the only phrase I can think of that he used over and over in his work. It’s in that letter Alice Elman sent me first. D.F.W. sticks it at the end, a jaunty sign-off, attributing the quote to Virginia Woolf on “The Merv Griffin Show,” in 1971. The identity of the letter recipient doesn’t shed much light on what is going on. Elman (not to be confused with the double double-consonanted biographer of Joyce) was a novelist and writing teacher and the sort of older littérateur that the young Wallace was drawn to. He grazed broadly in the world of letters and knew everyone he grazed upon (an enjoyable book of reminiscences, “Namedropping,” was published after his death, in 1997). No one I spoke to knows when or whether Elman conveyed the phrase to his student. Maybe it was part of a drinking game, nicely dovetailing with the postmodern fun that Wallace was having in his fiction at the time.\n\nProbably D.F.W. just wanted to make Elman, a teacher whose good opinion he valued, laugh. But if so, it’s curious that the phrase, so full of youthful weltschmerz, stayed with Wallace. It shows up again in a notebook entry, ascribed now to Woolf on the Johnny Carson show (not, as I would have expected, on the “Letterman” show. The “ironic 80s true Angel of Death” hosting of the British bluestocking would seem to have had more comic potential). It’s there again in the story “Tri-Stan, I sold Sissee Nar to Ecko,” from “Brief Interviews with Hideous Men,” a sort of postmodern parody of a Greek myth as told by Variety (one writer calls it “the Brady Bunch goes to The Ring&#8221);, where it’s attributed to the sage Dirk of Fresno. And it continues to flow through the writer’s underground spring, resurfacing in Wallace’s posthumously published last novel, “The Pale King,” in the midst of an odd scene in which I.R.S. agents turn tax-return pages.\n\nRecently, when rummaging through the papers that Wallace left behind at the Ransom Center, at the University of Texas, I was delighted to find it one more time. “The Pale King” began as a different book, called “Sir John Feelgood,” about pornography, in which, according to some notes in Wallace’s folders, an I.R.S. agent named Drinion doubles as a participant in X-rated films. The conceit is that Drinion is so slight, so ethereal, that, by using overlay technology, other men can superimpose their image on his. The only thing more erotic than watching another man having sex with a porn star, supposes Wallace, reasonably enough, is watching yourself do it. It seems a lonely kind of ecstasy, to be sure, pleasuring oneself as one’s image does the same on a TV screen. And for Drinion, watching his own sexual act be erased by another man’s, it’s even lonelier. But, as Wallace notes, “every love story is a ghost story.”\n\nWoolf, I guessed, did not anticipate this meaning for her phrase. But what did she have in mind for it? The problem was that I couldn’t find it in her writing. There are several dozen books by her when you include all the posthumous publications—more than I was going to read or reread. The Web turned up many near-misses: she’d written about ghost stories, especially Henry James’s, and even published several herself. I searched through six volumes of letters and six volumes of diaries, but no luck. I then e-mailed Hermione Lee, the Oxford professor who wrote the definitive biography of Woolf, who said that she’d never heard of the phrase and didn’t think that it sounded like Woolf anyway. The logical conclusion is Wallace made it up. That is the nature of the fun, as he might have said.\n\nExcept for one problem. If the phrase isn’t Woolf’s, it’s definitely Christina Stead’s. I wish I could report that I discovered this through some remarkable shoe-leather reading excursion, but, in fact, that’s not the case. What happened is that the great gluey goop that is Google shifted in some small way, and a writer and reporter who was helping me out, Michelle Dean, happened to re-Google the phrase the month before my book was to be published. It appeared to come from the wonderful, as often forgotten as rediscovered Australian novelist Stead, the author of “The Man Who Loved Children” (a favorite, as it happens of Wallace’s friend Jonathan Franzen). She wrote in a nineteen-seventies letter to a friend, the American poet Stanley Burnshaw, shortly after the death of her husband, that she was battling depression and that only writing had helped a bit: “There was the ghost story (“every love story is a ghost story”) of May First 1975 which for a time made me think I was coming back to life.”\n\nThe mention is intriguing and vague. Stead’s papers are in the Australian National Library in Canberra. (As her biographer Hazel Rowley recounts, Stead, who left Australia for Europe in her twenties, spent her last years back at home, tossed from relative to friend to university facility member, drunk by noon on Cinzano.) Nick Maniatis, the founder of the preëminent Wallace Web site thehowlingfantods.com, generously agreed to check out the collection during a break from his work as a high-school teacher. He reported that in folder thirty-three “Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story” appeared as a possible title for story in a proposed collection.\n\nI’m not sure such a story ever actually appeared, though. It’s not mentioned, at any rate, in Rowley’s biography. In a posthumous 1995 volume of her fiction called “Ocean of Stories,” one finds “Les Amoreux,” subtitled “A Life of Two Writers,” a sketch of Stead’s remarkable four-decade-long love affair with the Marxist banker and writer William Blake, whom she met shortly after arriving in Europe and married in 1952. (Blake died in 1968.) The story is hurried, lightly written, and seems more a sketch than a full-blown work of fiction; it is an attempt to catch a memory. To me, it seems possible this is the story once called “Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story.”\n\nAnd thus the source for Wallace’s bon mot and my title? One problem: “Les Amoreux” was first published, in 1984, in Southerly, an Australian literary magazine. It’s unlikely anyone at Arizona saw it, and in any event it doesn’t contain a mention of love stories being ghost stories. Stead’s letter to Burnshaw was written in the seventies, but didn’t appear in print until the publication of the second volume of her selected letters, “Talking into the Typewriter” (1992). Maybe Elman had somehow read Stead’s correspondence before? Maybe she published a story called “Every Love Story a Ghost Story” somewhere so obscure that neither her biographer nor the Web make note of it, and Elman or Wallace still saw it, but wrongly gave the adage to Woolf? Literary influence is full of such hard-to-trace pathways, and, if not, the only other solution is even weirder: two writers, Stead and Wallace, dream up the same phrase a world and a decade apart. This is the answer that I think Wallace, a lover of Borges, would have preferred.\n\nD. T.
