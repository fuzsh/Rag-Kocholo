Funny, honest, and wickedly intelligent, this is a moving meditation on what philosophy could look like if women were treated equally.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nThe untold story of philosophy\n\nBy Mahmoud Rasmi on 04-07-23\n\nThe Female Brain\n\nBy: Louann Brizendine M.D.\n\nNarrated by: Louann Brizendine M.D.\n\nLength: 7 hrs and 2 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,716\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,290\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,278\n\nWhy are women more verbal than men? Why do women remember details of fights that men can't remember at all? Why do women tend to form deeper bonds with their female friends than men do with their male counterparts? These and other questions have stumped both sexes throughout the ages. Now, pioneering neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine, M.D., brings together the latest findings to show how the unique structure of the female brain determines how women think and what they value.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat material :^D -- Agonizing orator >:^(\n\nBy Michael Dillman on 01-04-08\n\nMetaphysical Animals\n\nHow Four Women Brought Philosophy Back to Life\n\nBy: Clare Mac Cumhaill, Rachae Wiseman\n\nNarrated by: Alex Dunmore\n\nLength: 12 hrs and 35 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 32\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 27\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 26\n\nThe history of European philosophy is usually constructed from the work of men. In Metaphysical Animals, a pioneering group biography, Clare Mac Cumhaill and Rachael Wiseman offer a compelling alternative. In the mid-twentieth century Elizabeth Anscombe, Mary Midgley, Philippa Foot, and Iris Murdoch were philosophy students at Oxford when most male undergraduates and many tutors were conscripted away to fight in the Second World War. Together, these young women, all friends, developed a philosophy that could respond to the war’s darkest revelations.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\nBook about nothing\n\nBy Gerardo Naranjo Gonzalez on 06-14-22\n\nHannah Arendt\n\nA Very Short Introduction\n\nBy: Dana Villa\n\nNarrated by: Christa Lewis\n\nLength: 5 hrs and 2 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 4\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 4\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 4\n\nThis Very Short Introduction explores the philosophical ideas and political theories belonging to one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. As a survivor of the Holocaust, Arendt's life informed her work exploring the meaning and construction of power, evil, totalitarianism, and direct democracy. Dana Villa explains how Arendt gained world-wide fame with the publication of The Origins of Totalitarianism, and went on to have a distinguished career as a political theorist and public intellectual.\n\nHannah Arendt\n\nA Life in Dark Times\n\nBy: Anne C. Heller\n\nNarrated by: Tavia Gilbert\n\nLength: 4 hrs and 11 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 15\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 14\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 14\n\nHannah Arendt was a polarizing cultural theorist—extolled by her peers as a visionary and berated by her critics as a poseur and a fraud. Born in Prussia to assimilated Jewish parents, she escaped from Hitler’s Germany in 1933. Arendt is now best remembered for the storm of controversy that surrounded her 1963 New Yorker series on the trial of Adolf Eichmann, a kidnapped Nazi war criminal. In this comprehensive biography, Anne C. Heller tracks the source of Arendt’s contradictions and achievements to her sense of being a “conscious pariah”.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nPassionately narrated, beautifully written\n\nBy Anonymous User on 09-20-23\n\nThe Women Are Up to Something\n\nHow Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley, and Iris Murdoch Revolutionized Ethics\n\nBy: Benjamin J.B.

Drawing on a cluster of recently opened archives and extensive correspondence and interviews with those who knew them best, Benjamin Lipscomb traces the lives and ideas of four friends who gave us a better way to think about ethics, and ourselves.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nFascinating story of philosophical lives\n\nBy Brady on 06-28-24\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring\n\nBook One in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\n\nBy: J.

The key is our metabolic function—the most important and least understood factor in our overall health. As Dr. Casey Means explains in this book, nearly every health problem we face can be explained by how well the cells in our body create and use energy. To live free from frustrating symptoms and life-threatening disease, we need our cells to be optimally powered so that they can create “good energy,” the essential fuel that impacts every aspect of our wellbeing.\n\n2 out of 5 stars\n\noverzealous author\n\nBy Anonymous User on 05-20-24\n\nThe Prophet's Manual\n\nA Guide to Sustaining Your Prophetic Gift\n\nBy: John Eckhardt\n\nNarrated by: Mirron Willis\n\nLength: 12 hrs and 35 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 277\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 224\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 221\n\nSharpen and sustain your prophetic gift, and learn strategies for speaking the Word of God with confidence.
