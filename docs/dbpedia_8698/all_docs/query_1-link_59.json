        "text": "<strong>Lives</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Hazel</strong> <strong>Rowley</strong> University <strong>of</strong> Adelaide 19 November 2011 <strong>Abstracts</strong> Margaret Allen “‘Such comrades’, Fred and Katie Martin” The exploration <strong>of</strong> unconventional couple relationships was central to <strong>Hazel</strong> <strong>Rowley</strong>’s work. She explored the relationships <strong>of</strong> Christina Stead and Bill Blake, <strong>of</strong> Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and <strong>of</strong> Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. These were couples where each had independent personalities, interests and careers. The Australian writer, Catherine Martin (1848-1937) and her husband Frederick Martin had a somewhat unconventional relationship. Thus in 1888, six years after their marriage, she travelled alone to Germany “to study and write”. Fred, who stayed behind, working as an accountant at a tiny outback mining settlement was strongly supportive <strong>of</strong> her work. As he lay dying Catherine protested to her friend, C. H.Spence, “We’ve been such comrades all these years.” Their comradeship is surprising, given their very different backgrounds. She was the daughter <strong>of</strong> a poor cr<strong>of</strong>ter family from Skye, while he was the son <strong>of</strong> an educated middle-class family from Birmingham. This paper speculates upon sources and model for their relationship while examining how they arranged their lives together. Margaret Allen is Pr<strong>of</strong>essor Emerita, <strong>of</strong> Gender Studies, at the University <strong>of</strong> Adelaide. Her most recent work has focussed upon transnational, gendered histories and whiteness, in particular an exploration <strong>of</strong> Indian-Australian relationships c 1880-1940. She has also done extensive research on nineteenth-century South Australian women writers, including Catherine Martin, 1848-1937. Judith Armstrong The Play: Simone de Beauvoir First performed at The Stork Theatre, St Kilda, 5-28 August 2011 Directed by Justine Campbell. Written by Judith Armstrong Simone de Beauvoir. Femme Fatale <strong>of</strong> Feminism. In 2011, on the 25th anniversary <strong>of</strong> her death, the icon <strong>of</strong> the feminist movement takes centre stage. Simone de Beauvoir, (1908- 1986), trailblazing French philosopher, public intellectual, novelist and lover stands at the centre <strong>of</strong> the Western feminist tradition. This groundbreaking new play focuses on the conflicts and passions <strong>of</strong> Beauvoir as she endeavours to live a life <strong>of</strong> freedom. A lifelong rebel, the challenger <strong>of</strong> all social conventions – especially those surrounding love and marriage – she formed a pact with the philosopher, Jean-Paul"
