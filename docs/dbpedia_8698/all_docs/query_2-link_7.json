        "text": "> PREVIOUS SHORTLISTS\n\n2023 | Diane Bell\n\nDiane Bell (ACT) was announced as the winner of the 2023 Hazel Rowley Literary Fellowship at Adelaide Writers’ Week on 8 March 2023. The announcement followed the Hazel Rowley Memorial Lecture, which this year consisted of a conversation between our 2017 Fellow, Ann-Marie Priest, and writer and critic Kerryn Goldsworthy about Ann-Marie’s biography My Tongue is My Own: A Life of Gwen Harwood. The conversation was about ‘The risk and rewards of writing an unauthorised biography’.\n\nDiane is writing a book about the relationship between Ngarrindjeri woman Louisa Karpany, née Kontinyeri (c1840-1921), and George Ezekiel Mason (1811-1876), sub-Protector of Aborigines at Wellington, South Australia. The Fellowship will enable Diane to further her research with the descendants of Louisa Karpany and George Mason with whom she has worked since 1996; to visit soon-to-be opened anthropological archives in Perth; and to refine her retelling and reweaving of oral and written accounts of a critical moment for race relations in the newly proclaimed colony of South Australia.\n\nDiane Bell, OAM, is an award-winning author and anthropologist who has published widely on Indigenous matters, including land rights, native title, sacred sites, law reform, religion, and human rights. Her ground-breaking book Daughters of the Dreaming (in continuous print since the first edition in 1983) sheds light on the importance of women’s role in Australian indigenous desert culture. In 1999 Diane won the NSW Premier’s Literary Award Gleebooks Award for Cultural & Literary Criticism for her book Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin: A world that is, was, and will be. Diane’s Generations: Grandmothers, mothers, and daughters (1987), with photographs by Ponch Hawkes, was the Bicentennial Landmark publication on women in Australia.\n\n(Photo: Brenton McGeachie)\n\n2023 | Highly Commended Carolyn Dowley\n\nThis year the judges decided to give a Highly Commended award of $4,000 to Carolyn Dowley (WA), to assist in her archival research for her biography of Wongutha woman Sadie Canning, MBE, a member of the Stolen Generations, and Western Australia’s first Aboriginal nurse and matron.\n\nCarolyn is an award-winning writer and historian. Her first book, Through Silent Country (2000, 2023), traces histories from Wongutha Country in WA and won the NSW Premier’s History Award for Community and Regional History in 2001. Through Silent Country was also shortlisted for international and local literature awards. Recent works nearing publication include a commissioned work for the Indigenous Desert Alliance, and a story of a Stolen Generations Wongutha woman who journeys home to her grandmother’s country.\n\n(Photo: Cait Dowley)\n\n2022 | Naomi Parry Duncan\n\nNaomi Parry Duncan (NSW) was announced as the winner of the 2022 Hazel Rowley Literary Fellowship at the Wheeler Centre on 2 March 2022. The announcement followed a panel discussion between Fellowship judge Jeff Sparrow, our 2019 Fellow Eleanor Hogan, and writer and historian Yves Rees (they/them) about the dilemmas of writers including themselves and their journey of research into their biographies.\n\nNaomi is writing about the life of Gai-mariagal man Musquito, who was hanged in Tasmania in 1825. Musquito, originally from Port Jackson, was a resistance fighter who was exiled to Norfolk Island and taken to Van Diemen’s Land – lutruwita, palawa/pakana country.\n\nNaomi is a historian who writes about communities and social justice. She is particularly interested in the interactions of Aboriginal people and colonisers in Australian history, from the first days of contact on the frontier to the Stolen Generations. Originally from Tasmania, Naomi now lives in Katoomba, while teaching in the School of Humanities at the University of Tasmania.\n\n(Photo: Joy M Lai)\n\n2022 | Highly Commended Sylvia Martin\n\nThis year the judges decided to give a Highly Commended award of $7,500 to Sylvia Martin who is writing a joint biography of artists and artisans Eirene Mort and Nora (‘Chips’) Weston, ‘New Women’ who were influential in the Arts and Crafts Movement in Australia.\n\nSylvia is a freelance writer, reviewer, examiner and mentor. She is the author of biographies on Ida Leeson and Aileen Palmer, among others. Her book Ida Leeson: A life was awarded the 2008 Magarey Medal for Biography. Her most recent books are Sky Swimming: Reflections on Auto/Biography, People and Place (2020) and in 2021 a revised edition of her 2001 book Passionate Friends: Mary Fullerton, Mabel Singleton and Miles Franklin. In her joint biography of Eirene Mort and Nora (‘Chips’) Weston, who lived and worked together for six decades, she will further her interest in exploring the lives of past Australian women who did not conform to the expected trajectory of marriage and motherhood and who would today probably call themselves lesbians. Sylvia lives in Katoomba in the Blue Mountains with her long-term partner, Liz.\n\n(Photo: Veronica Turner)\n\n2021 | Mandy Sayer\n\nMandy Sayer (NSW) was announced as the winner of the 2021 Hazel Rowley Literary Fellowship at Adelaide Writers’ Week on 3 March 2021.

Eleanor was interviewed about her book on Radio National’s Saturday Extra on 4 April 2021.

She is Editorial Director of Booktopia, Australia’s largest online bookseller.\n\n(Photo: Wendy McDougall)\n\n2014 | Maxine Beneba Clarke\n\nMaxine Beneba Clarke (Victoria) was announced as the winner of the 2014 Hazel Rowley Literary Fellowship at the Writers Victoria Salon on 11 March 2014.\n\nMaxine used the fellowship to work on her proposed autobiography, The Hate Race – a memoir about growing up black in white middle-class Australia.\n\nThe Hate Race was published by Hachette in August 2016. In 2017 Maxine won the Multicultural NSW Award for The Hate Race in the NSW Premier’s Literary Awards. The Hate Race was also shortlisted for the 2017 Victorian Premier’s Literary Award for non-fiction, the Indie Prize, the Stella Prize and the ABIA 2017 Biography Book of the Year. In 2024 the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne staged a production of The Hate Race, starring Zahra Newman.\n\nThe fellowship allowed the Caribbean-Australian writer to ‘go back to where she came from’ – to travel from Australia to England re-tracing her parents’ journey, from England to the Caribbean re-tracing her grandparents’ migration, and from the Caribbean to Africa in search of the ancestors transported to the Caribbean as slaves.\n\n“The opportunity to research and re-trace my family’s migration path will not only be momentous on a personal and emotional level, but will, I hope, result in a work of non-fiction which significantly contributes toward contemporary post-slavery dialogue on race, migration, colour, ancestry, genocide, and the various places we think of as home,” Maxine said.\n\nIn 2013, Maxine won the Victorian Premier’s Literary Award for an Unpublished Manuscript with her debut short story collection, Foreign Soil (published by Hachette Australia in May 2014). Maxine is also the author of the poetry collections Gil Scott Heron is on Parole and Nothing Here Needs Fixing, as well as being an Australian slam poetry champion.\n\n(Photo: Mario Varrichio)\n\n2013 | Stephany Steggall\n\nThe 2013 award went to Stephany Steggall (Queensland) for a biography of Australian writer Thomas Keneally. Her book Interestingly Enough…the Life of Tom Keneally was subsequently published in 2015 by Nero.\n\nThe presentation of the award to Stephany followed the 2013 Hazel Rowley Memorial Lecture given by Alex Miller at Adelaide Writers’ Week on 6 March 2013. Alex Miller’s lecture has been published in his book The Simplest Words (2015, Allen & Unwin) in the chapter ‘A Circle of Kindred Spirits’, p.299. The lecture was also published in Southerly magazine in 2013 (Vol 73, No 3).\n\nStephany has previously published biographies of Colin Thiele (2004), Ivan Southall (2006) and Bruce Dawe (2009). She has worked at AustLit as a research assistant and at the time of winning the Fellowship was working on a history of the Australian Society of Authors, Status and Sugar, which was published in 2013.\n\n2012 | Mary Hoban\n\nThe inaugural winner of the 2012 Hazel Rowley Literary Fellowship was Mary Hoban (Vic) for a biography of Julia Arnold, née Sorell (1826-1888). Mary’s book, An Unconventional Wife: The life of Julia Sorell Arnold, was published by Scribe in April 2019.\n\nIn 2019 Mary won the History Book Award and the Non-Fiction Book Award in the Queensland Literary Awards for An Unconventional Wife. Her book was also longlisted for the 2019 Tasmanian Book Prize, and shortlisted for the Mark and Evette Moran Nib Literary Award 2019 and the Magarey Medal for Biography 2020.\n\nAlthough not a well-known figure herself, Julia Sorell was famously well-connected. Born in Hobart, Julia was the granddaughter of Lieutenant Governor William Sorell. She was the daughter-in-law of Reverend Thomas Arnold, the famed headmaster of Rugby School (as pictured in Tom Brown’s Schooldays) and sister-in-law to the poet Matthew Arnold. Her daughter Mary was the famous Victorian novelist Mrs Humphry Ward and her grandchildren were novelist Aldous Huxley, scientist Julian Huxley and author Janet Penrose.\n\nThe fellowship announcement followed a discussion at the Wheeler Centre between novelist Alex Miller and historian Jim Davidson to mark the first anniversary of Hazel Rowley’s death. A video of the event is available at the Wheeler Centre website. Mary Hoban spoke about her project with Jim Davidson and Della Rowley on Books and Arts Daily with Michael Cathcart on 15 March 2012.
