        "text": "How Art Works?\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts in the USA have just published 'How Art Works' , which is essentially their research agenda for the next 5 years, based on a systems map and measurement model setting out how they think art works. The map - based upon a belief that 'the arts are a dynamic, complex system' and therefore with multiple entry (and exit) points and different perspectives according to the individual - places arts engagement at the heart of how art works, with what they call 'the raw fuel' coming from 'the human impulse to create and express'. The benefits are to individuals and to communities, and to various other fields including the economy. Some people will find the system map and the various illustrations of how you might measure what is happening in the system too complicated. For others it will be too simplistic and lacking in nuance. I find it a good framework for thinking about not just whether art works but how and when. This\n\nBack to school special\n\nIt’s a new year. I’m told that these days by the sounds through my office from the nearby school playground, rather than by my kids needing new shoes, bags, pencils, PE kit, or, in the university years, help with the rent. But I suspect most of us of any age and family situation in the UK always associate the September turn in the weather with a new school year. We might grow nostalgic for that new book, new protractor, fresh start feeling, or we might rejoice not to ever have to go back into a classroom, but there’s some kind of emotional twitch in most of us at this time of year. (I envy the French the word ‘la rentrée’, which sums those mixed emotions up brilliantly somehow, and not just for those in education.) Arts provision in schools is a key area of argument and activity at the moment. Bob & Roberta Smith even stood for parliament against Michael Gove to raise the issue . The changes to the curriculum are making it harder and harder for schools to support arts activi\n\nRe. arts: thoughts from Sartre - choice, collectivity, collaboration and contingency\n\n. I recently came across Talking with Sartre , a fascinating book of ‘conversations and debates’ between Jean-Paul Sartre and John Gerassi, recorded between 1970 and 1974. When I was sixteen I had a picture of Sartre stuck to my guitar, cut from his obituary, and a Penguin Modern Classic of The Age of Reason in my long-overcoat pocket. (Think I can be a bit much now, you should have met me then...) Sartre fell out of fashion – after the collapse of the Berlin Wall I guess, but probably also because he wasn’t as cool looking as Camus – but for me he still sat there in the background, till Hazel Rowley’s book on his relationship with Simone de Beauvoir Tête à Tête revived my interest in and respect for a peculiar and flawed man who struggled to find an authentic way to be in the world, coming to define a kind of engagement with ideas and politics – and writing. I don’t have time or space for a ‘reassessment’ of Sartre, nor the philosophical knowledge. But I found this book of essays"
