        "text": "Ramona Koval: Hello, Ramona Koval with you on ABC Radio National. Now, when I say Jean-Paul Sartre, what's the next name you immediately think of? Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre are two of the most celebrated intellectuals and lovers of the 20th century. This week on Books and Writing we're talking about a new biography of these two, the first that really focuses on their 50-year-long relationship.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir were both born in the first decade of the 20th century. Sartre died in 1980, Beauvoir in 1986. He's most famously regarded as the founder of existentialism, she is the author of The Second Sex, but this famous French philosopher/writer couple have come in for a fair bit of criticism since their deaths; existentialism is rather out of fashion nowadays, the women's movement has criticised Beauvoir for being too much in the thrall of Sartre, and both have copped posthumous flack since it has emerged that they told lies to their other lovers.\n\nHazel Rowley is the author of Te-Te: The Lives and Loves of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Hazel Rowley grew up in England and Australia and she now lives in America. She's previously written acclaimed biographies of the Australian novelist Christiana Stead and the African-American author Richard Wright, but this one on Jean-Paul and Simone seems to be proving a bit too racy a read in some quarters, in America particularly, where reviewers have found these two and the nature of their relationship and relationships with others distasteful, even nauseating.\n\nSo when I spoke with Hazel Rowley from a studio near her home in New York, I wondered if this was how she felt about them. After all, she says in Te-Te that Sartre and Beauvoir and their relationship exerted a powerful influence on her as she was growing into womanhood.\n\nHazel Rowley: Well, I was that generation who really grew into womanhood in...I started university in 1969, absolutely at the point when the women's movement was hitting the campuses, in Australia absolutely as much as anywhere else, if not more so. I was studying French at Adelaide University, and fairly early on I read Simone de Beauvoir. In fact, I had a rather good lecturer who talked about existentialism and political commitment and all this stuff that inspired me hugely because I was pretty political, and their relationship just seemed so exciting and, by the way, still does to me in many ways. But the Adelaide (and indeed the Australia) that was still around in the late 60s, it was the tail-end of that period where you married fairly fast and if you were a woman you better be a virgin, and it was not an incredibly exciting prospect. And then along came the women's movement and we were questioning everything, and here was Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre who had this relationship where they were really equal, and I still think they were really equal. And they travelled and they wrote books and they helped each other as writers and they read and they had lovers and they had friends...it struck me as more exciting than what I was seeing around me.\n\nRamona Koval: So how easy was it to replicate?\n\nHazel Rowley: Now you're getting personal. Well, not all that easy but a good model.\n\nRamona Koval: Still a good model, after all you know? I'll leave that question hanging because let's now talk about all you know about this relationship which is the subject of this fabulous book. Let's talk about how they came to this relationship together. Let's talk about what sort of man he was and what sort of a woman she was. Let's talk about him first; he was a very precious little boy, his mother's adored little boy.\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, that's true, but he was also, from a very early age, a sort of leader among his friends and a very exciting guy. Simone de Beauvoir talks about that but so do others. I mean, memoirs galore in France talk about what it was like to talk to Jean-Paul Sartre and how he made you laugh and how he made these really complicated ideas seem so clear. A lot of his students say that he was a very exciting teacher. He was a teacher of philosophy for ten years or so, and he'd sit there on the front desk in far more casual clothes than most French teachers wore, and he's sit on the desk swinging his little legs and making the students burst into laughter, and relating philosophy to life-they loved it.\n\nRamona Koval: He was tiny and he was not an attractive man, was he?\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, you have to say that. It has to be said that he was ugly and he knew it. It was hard.\n\nRamona Koval: Let's talk about her then. She was a very clever girl, from a family that had lost its money, and in fact she really thanked the universe from having come from such a family because she wouldn't have perhaps got her education if they hadn't been poor.\n\nHazel Rowley: That's the thing, you know, when the reviewers all get stuck into Sartre and Beauvoir, like a lot of them are doing to my dismay, they seem to forget (and I don't know why because I make this very clear in my book) that these two met in 1929. It was a time when women, to be married to a good bourgeois man, to get a good catch, you had to bring along a dowry. Can you imagine? This was Catholic France in 1929, and that's not even to talk about the fact that women couldn't vote, that Sartre was coming through the l'Ecole Normale Superieure, the most elite educational school in France, that Beauvoir, as woman, did not have access to, that Simone de Beauvoir until she was 19 had never stepped foot in a cafin France because cafes sell alcohol and nice women didn't go into a caf And not to mention the double standard sexually, where men sowed their wild oats, as it was called, and Sartre like all his friends went to brothels, went to prostitutes. Simone de Beauvoir was, of course, a good little virgin right up until the time she met Sartre. So that's the 1929 context in which these two met and in which Sartre said to Simone de Beauvoir-we're going to be equals. What I propose to you is that we have a relationship between equals. You do just what I do and we tell each other everything-well, you know, how many men say that to a woman? Even today.\n\nRamona Koval: So they get together and Sartre is, as you say, not an attractive man, but he has this demand really...I think you say it's a prerequisite almost for his friendship, both with men and with women, that they have to be handsome, they have to be attractive.\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, he said it somewhere very lucidly himself, he said that it's bad enough being one ugly person but if there are two of you walking down the street you really attract attention to yourselves. So he always liked to be with beautiful people, it's true. Beauvoir was beautiful.\n\nRamona Koval: She was beautiful. But you say that he was not a good lover. Is that according to her or according to everybody he made love to?\n\nHazel Rowley: That's pretty much the word out there when I interviewed people...\n\nRamona Koval: The word on the street.\n\nHazel Rowley: Well, you know, I interviewed a lot of his ex-girlfriends-Michelle Vian and others-and yes, they tell you that he wasn't the most exciting lover. And another thing which wasn't too exciting was that he practiced coitus interruptus as his form of birth control, which was neither very effective, nor was it very satisfying for the women he was with. One of them has said that she thought it was part of his sadism that he did that. I mean, he could have worn condoms and he didn't. No, Beauvoir said to Nelson Algren, her Chicago lover, that the only place that Sartre is not really exciting is in bed.\n\nRamona Koval: So then, what was the attraction for all these women? Because he always had women, often younger women, beautiful women. Is it simply the power of the most famous writer in France?\n\nHazel Rowley: I suppose that came into play later on, sure. He really was the most famous figure in France for decades. But he worked on charm, he worked on it hard, he said it was like literary exercise, you had to be very clever with words and with point of view and timing, the whole bit. But I think it was also...his American lover, Dolores...actually she was a France woman, he met her in New York, and she commented how exciting he was to talk to; he listened to you, he made you feel important, he took you seriously, he took your ideas seriously, and he himself was sparkling with wonderful ideas. I guess that's seductive.\n\nRamona Koval: It is, it sounds good, doesn't it? But the notion of transparency and freedom in the relationship...you say that he was asked how he coped with all his women once and he said, 'I lie to them. It's easier and more decent.' 'Do you lie to all of them?' He smiles, 'To all of them.' 'Even to the Beaver?' (Which is what he calls Simone de Beauvoir.) 'Particularly to the Beaver,' he says.\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, that's the one remark I found in all the papers, letters, journals and so on that I looked at that was a bit of a betrayal of Simone de Beauvoir. Generally he wrote letters to other girlfriends and was bitchy about everybody but never Simone de Beauvoir. That remark hurt her, I know, because the man Olivier Todd who quotes that apparently got a letter from Simone de Beauvoir saying how enraged she was. So it wasn't the best thing for him to say. I suspect, by the way, it's not really true. He might have told little lies to Simone de Beauvoir. I know, for example...we do know (I talk about this in the book) that he was something of an alcoholic at the end of his life...well before the end. He drank enormous quantities of whisky and took a lot of speed and then he took five heavy sleeping pills to wind himself down and get himself to sleep, and then the next morning he started it all up again. The thing was that he did hide from Simone de Beauvoir...he was hiding whisky bottles behind his bookcase and other girlfriends were smuggling in these whisky bottles. She was extremely upset by that because she knew that he was virtually killing himself. Those sorts of lies were the lies that he told Beauvoir. In later life, unfortunately, she became a bit of a mother figure to this naughty little boy who was hiding his whisky bottles. But generally I don't think he did lie to Beauvoir much.\n\nRamona Koval: Let's just talk about their circle because you describe their circle of friends, people who came to see them at the cafthat they would hold court in, and the friends had to know that when the time was up they had to disappear because somebody else was arriving at the table. They were a royal court, weren't they?\n\nHazel Rowley: They believed in freedom. Nothing was more important than freedom, but this did not in any way include spontaneity. Often Beauvoir and Sartre were living in a hotel, on different floors of the same hotel, or eventually they moved, in the 1950s, into apartments, rented usually, near each other. But their social life was strictly scheduled, just like a sort of dental clinic. You know, you meet Olga from 1:00 until 3:00, then you work again until 8:00 at night and then you meet Vander, and lunch tomorrow will be with Beauvoir...it was pencilled in, scheduled in, and nobody...it was te-te, which is why I call my book Te-Te, it was always these twosomes, and it was never the case that if Sartre was sitting in a cafwith Olga that Beauvoir could just walk over and join them. That was strictly taboo. It was strict twosomes with strict timelines and of course all arranged around their work which was the most important thing; eight hours a day of uninterrupted work.\n\nRamona Koval: If Sartre had plenty of arrangements with other women throughout his life, Simone de Beauvoir had her fair share of affairs too, and with women as well as with men, although that was something that she always denied.\n\nHazel Rowley: She denied for her whole life that she actually had affairs with women, and that was rather a surprise when her letters to Sartre were published after her death, to find out that she had had a good sexual relationship with several women. I don't know really quite why she denied that. Maybe it was just too much of a bombshell for France to take, you know? They had quite a lot to take already and there comes a point when you lose your authority by telling the world too much about yourself. Possibly it was that, possibly it was that other women were implicated and they didn't want to be publicly implicated. But in any event, yes, throughout her life she denied that, and she certainly did have affairs with women...\n\nRamona Koval: And sometimes women who went on to be Sartre's lovers.\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, and sometimes at the same time.\n\nRamona Koval: So where was the element of...the idea of jealousy at all manifesting in these relationships?\n\nHazel Rowley: What was so interesting about Beauvoir and Sartre is that they really were trying to invent a relationship. Their view as existentialist philosophers was that we're born into this grid of social conventions which are merely social conventions and let's question them, let's challenge everything. They also didn't believe in human nature, so that they didn't believe that one is lazy or that one is different as a woman from a man. One is what one sets out to do. And so they invented this relationship and they believed that jealousy is natural but it's not good and that it's one of the things that you can work on and that you should work on. It is, after all, just an emotion and we have willpower which makes us either indulge emotions or try to get the better of them. So they worked on jealousy and Beauvoir worked on her jealousy throughout her life because she was often jealous of Sartre and his girlfriends.\n\nRamona Koval: She wanted to be the major person and in fact she did try to organise everything with him, and presumably as long as she knew everything she was okay but if he was having any arrangements that she didn't know about then there was a lack of control really.\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, I think you're right. I think that knowing ultimately meant control because he was confiding in her and there was a complicity between them. Often he used to bitch about them, as I say, and therefore she felt that she had some control. But there were times, nevertheless, when it was very hard. He was really in love with the French woman who he met in New York just after the war. I think that was probably the most difficult time of all.\n\nRamona Koval: Why did he keep saying he was going to marry these women? This was this extraordinary thing that you write about. Why didn't they just read what he'd written for a start, then they'd know that he wasn't actually promising what he could deliver. But he kept having these little relationships where he'd promise very conventional things; he wanted them to be his wife and they all thought this was a really fabulous idea. A lot of them were very neurotic, a lot of them seemed to be very...those actresses who never got another job in their whole life other than the one where he wrote a play for them and put them in the play, to act in it. What kind of women were they?\n\nHazel Rowley: Well, that's a good question. I think it was part of Sartre's need to feel in control, and sometimes I think Sartre verged on madness; all this alcohol and speed that he took and the manic way he worked. He was definitely fighting demons, and part of his need to exert some control over his environment was to exert power over women and he really chose women who were...he called them 'drowning women'. He said he had a tremendous attraction for drowning women, and these were these rather neurotic little women, often actresses, very beautiful always, who he took under his wing and he made them financially dependant on him and he wrote plays for them, which they weren't always up to, I might say, because the roles were very demanding. So he was sort of doing them a favour and not doing them a favour, but he was certainly making them depend on him which was a power thing for him.\n\nRamona Koval: He had difficulty being alone, and this is kind of amazing given his philosophical ideas. Tell me about that. Where does it leave existentialism, this whole life and this whole application of the theory to the practice?\n\nHazel Rowley: Existentialism is really about choosing the life you lead, it's about making choices, it's about freedom. Sartre became, as a Marxist, increasingly aware that our freedom is in many ways curtailed by social conditions, but we nevertheless, he would argue, always have an element of freedom that we should use responsibly, whether that's in political action which Sartre did a lot, or whether that's in other ways. I think looking back on his life he did in many ways act out his existentialism relatively well. Yes, I'm not trying to cover up the fact that told a lot of lies to a lot of women, I don't in any way want to whitewash him, but he did invent a relationship, he did have remarkable generosity towards people...I mean, everybody; friends, women and so on. He just gave his money away. He died a pauper, when he was a really very well-off man. The minute he had money he gave it to somebody. He gave a lot to the Third World and he gave his life to his work and his work increasingly became political. So I think he was a man who lived out his belief that an existentialist intellectual should be committed, should take stands and should invent his own life, and that he did those things.\n\nRamona Koval: How did you see their relationship and their actions during the Nazi occupation of Paris? There seemed to be some ambivalences there.\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, he has been criticised for, for example, putting on plays at all in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Some intellectuals just stopped writing, or at least they just didn't publish anything during that period because, of course, everything that was put on the Paris stage or everything that was published went through German Nazi censorship. But the other side of that argument is that the plays he put on, most notably the play called The Flies and the play called No Exit, were really cries of freedom. They were telling the French (underneath the surface because they couldn't say it too overtly) to rise up against Nazi occupation, that we should use our freedom to revolt, to rebel, to not submit to these oppressors, and people say that going to the theatre to see those plays by Sartre during the occupation, a breeze seemed to fly through the theatre, it was refreshing.\n\nRamona Koval: Simone de Beauvoir interestingly used a lot of these relationships in her literary work, and sometimes dedicating books to people as a way to come clean to them about maybe having an affair with their husbands. Can you talk about that a bit?\n\nHazel Rowley: Well, it is true that her first novel, She Came to Stay, was based on the trio that she and Sartre formed with a younger woman called Olga Kosakievicz who had been a student of Simone de Beauvoir's. The characters are very, very obviously Sartre and Beauvoir and this character Olga, who was called Xaviere in the novel. She dedicated the book to her, and at the end the Beauvoir figure murders the Olga figure. So it was a kind of funny thing to do, to both dedicate the book to her so that the whole world wondered what her connection was (and when they didn't wonder, they knew) and then you murder her in the end. And of course Nelson Algren, the Chicago lover...which was a blazing affair. He was a very handsome man and I think it was probably Simone de Beauvoir's most passionate affair. With him came America, an America that she briefly loved after the war. It was before the McCarthy period and it was American jazz and American literature and some pretty exciting things. So Nelson Algren sort of came with those things, but she wrote about him; she wrote about him in her memoirs, she wrote about him in America Day by Day, she wrote about him in her novel The Mandarins, and in the end the man was furious.\n\nRamona Koval: And what about everybody giving him her books to review after that, and him writing terrible reviews for the rest his life, I suppose, of her books?\n\nHazel Rowley: Frankly, that says something about the LA Times that they were willing to give Nelson Algren her latest book Old Age to review. Why would Nelson Algren review Old Age? And naturally he wrote an incredibly sarcastic, mean review, but that sheds very bad light on the LA Times, if you ask me.\n\nRamona Koval: I agree with you. How does this whole story translate outside French culture? Because of course the culture of relationships and sexuality and affairs and all of this is different in France than it is in puritan America.\n\nHazel Rowley: Yes, there was a very interesting article in Le Monde, actually, defending my book and I was very proud of that because I thought that I would have trouble with the French. I mean, I'm an Anglo stepping in, uncovering things about their two big icons. The French don't generally like that. But there was an article in Le Monde a couple of weeks ago which defended the book and said how good it was and said isn't it interesting that in the US there's been this amazing puritanical reaction to this book The reviewer pointed out that I have a PhD which was about Simone de Beauvoir, that I interviewed her, that I wrote a thesis about her, that I have credentials, that I'd done an enormous amount of interviewing, and that the book is very balanced and very fair, and that they don't understand in France why there is this kind of bonfire and stomping around it and ranting about their terrible behaviour which, it's true, puritanical America is quite busy doing.\n\nRamona Koval: So now that you know all of this stuff that you didn't know when you were a younger woman in the 70s and wanting to make a life based on the theory of these relationships...you said before when we started that you still hold them up in your mind as icons really. Tell me why you're not disappointed with them?\n\nHazel Rowley: The disappointment came really when Simone de Beauvoir's letters were published after her death and we did find out that she had lied to people and that they had both lied to people, and that she, to some extent, had lied to us readers as well as her lovers, and that was the disappointment. But working on them 20 years later as a middle-aged woman as I now am and feeling much more detached, I was prepared to find out what I would find and not cover anything up, I warmed to them again immensely. I think there is, you may agree, a tenderness in my book, an admiration underneath the surface which is actually why I'm a bit dismayed by the puritanical rant stuff. There are certainly reasons for us to be disappointed in their lies, but the lies were frankly fairly harmless, and if the women were stupid enough to believe Sartre after a certain time, then they were getting what they deserved. He was such a blatantly obvious liar, in my opinion.\n\nNo, what I admire is that they were public intellectuals, really very brave during the Algerian war. Their lives were briefly in danger, and now when I look at the world today I think we need nothing more than intellectuals who speak out. They were generous, their cult of friendship and loyalty was something I admire very much, they looked after their friends and had lifelong friends, travelled with them, helped them with their books in a way that I very much admire. I love their warmth, their conversation, I love the fact that Beauvoir in particular...well, both of them but Beauvoir was tremendously interested in the world. She was nothing of a narcissist, even if she wrote memoirs galore, it was full of curiosity for the world, other people, how they worked. And by the way, one last thing, even Sartre, if he had this great obsession to seduce women, somewhere he said (and I believe him) that it wasn't really the sex that interested him, he wanted to get to know these women, and quite often he wanted to get to know a country like Russia through getting to know a woman. And you had to undress them to get that intimacy and get those barriers over with and then you had a real relationship. I know what he means and I respect that."
