        "text": "Re. arts: thoughts from Sartre - choice, collectivity, collaboration and contingency\n\nI recently came across Talking with Sartre, a fascinating book of ‘conversations and debates’ between Jean-Paul Sartre and John Gerassi, recorded between 1970 and 1974. When I was sixteen I had a picture of Sartre stuck to my guitar, cut from his obituary, and a Penguin Modern Classic of The Age of Reason in my long-overcoat pocket. (Think I can be a bit much now, you should have met me then...) Sartre fell out of fashion – after the collapse of the Berlin Wall I guess, but probably also because he wasn’t as cool looking as Camus – but for me he still sat there in the background, till Hazel Rowley’s book on his relationship with Simone de Beauvoir Tête à Tête revived my interest in and respect for a peculiar and flawed man who struggled to find an authentic way to be in the world, coming to define a kind of engagement with ideas and politics – and writing.\n\nI don’t have time or space for a ‘reassessment’ of Sartre, nor the philosophical knowledge. But I found this book of essays so stimulating I wanted to share a few tangential thoughts relating to arts and culture inspired by it, as well as letting those interested know about its existence.\n\nMaking choices is central to authentic life, and always difficult. But avoiding them is childish romanticism. As Gerassi describes in an afterword, this is the essential difference between the two big existentialists Sartre and Camus. Camus refused choice – said No – which leads to the archetype of the rebel. (I prefer Marx’s formulation myself: ‘Whatever it is I’m against it.’ The Marx in question being Groucho, obviously.) Sartre said, in Gerassi’s words, ‘what we must do instead is commit ourselves over and over again. No act is pure. All acts are choices, which alienate some. No one can live without dirty hands. To be simply opposed is also to be responsible for not being in favour, for not advocating change.’ The relevance to today’s environment of cuts and choices is obvious. Especially for leaders, using commitment to avoid cynicism is especially key. What are we saying yes to? Also integral to Sartre’s reflections here is that you will get some of the choices wrong – but this is part of the process , just keeping making decisions in good faith. Acknowledging and respecting this is important.\n\n‘There is no I without the we.’ This sums up my main argument with Richard Eyres’ recent article about cuts to the arts. Eyre says ‘Art is about the \"I\" in life not the \"we\", about private life rather than public. A public life that doesn't acknowledge the private is a life not worth having.’ I would say the reverse is more urgently true given this government’s policies – and much of the way we act as a society, to be fair to them for one second. Private life needs to acknowledge the public life more. And yes, people who spend your kids to private schools, I do mean you, sorry. So that sense of the social and collective I find very powerful.\n\nSartre and De Beauvoir are famous for having an open relationship – they committed to each other as young people, saw each other every day, are buried next to each other, but had other lovers. They termed their own relationship as ‘necessary’ and the others as ‘contingent’, a term rich in meaning for Sartre. This was not always easy for them or their lovers – the great American novelist Nelson Algren famously couldn’t deal with being ‘contingent’ - but gave clarity if nothing else. In a recent discussion about partnerships and collaborations in the cultural sector it struck me that the idea of ‘necessary’ and ‘contingent’ partnerships might be helpful in at least managing conflicted feelings people seem to have about working with others. Which of your partnerships are for the long-term, even when they evolve, and which are contingent? A side thought is these interviews reveal Sartre to have been much less doctrinaire in who he would work with than one might suspect from his image – so long as they were working on the same cause. His emphasis on choice made him less rather than more ‘politically correct’ in his collaborations.\n\nA line that both Gerassi and Sartre refer to several times in their conversations is a quote from The Age of Reason ‘You don’t fight fascism because you’re going to win. You fight fascism because it is fascist.’ This links somehow to Havel’s distinction between hope and optimism: “Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.” I find that a reassuring and enabling thought just now: pragmatic but the opposite of cynical.\n\nOk, enough. I will now go directly to Pseud's Corner, without passing go or collecting 200 francs...\n\nHow Art Works?\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts in the USA have just published 'How Art Works' , which is essentially their research agenda for the next 5 years, based on a systems map and measurement model setting out how they think art works. The map - based upon a belief that 'the arts are a dynamic, complex system' and therefore with multiple entry (and exit) points and different perspectives according to the individual - places arts engagement at the heart of how art works, with what they call 'the raw fuel' coming from 'the human impulse to create and express'. The benefits are to individuals and to communities, and to various other fields including the economy. Some people will find the system map and the various illustrations of how you might measure what is happening in the system too complicated. For others it will be too simplistic and lacking in nuance. I find it a good framework for thinking about not just whether art works but how and when. This\n\nBack to school special\n\nIt’s a new year. I’m told that these days by the sounds through my office from the nearby school playground, rather than by my kids needing new shoes, bags, pencils, PE kit, or, in the university years, help with the rent. But I suspect most of us of any age and family situation in the UK always associate the September turn in the weather with a new school year. We might grow nostalgic for that new book, new protractor, fresh start feeling, or we might rejoice not to ever have to go back into a classroom, but there’s some kind of emotional twitch in most of us at this time of year. (I envy the French the word ‘la rentrée’, which sums those mixed emotions up brilliantly somehow, and not just for those in education.) Arts provision in schools is a key area of argument and activity at the moment. Bob & Roberta Smith even stood for parliament against Michael Gove to raise the issue . The changes to the curriculum are making it harder and harder for schools to support arts activi\n\nPresent imperfect reading\n\n[Insert introduction here - cover sad, extraordinary times; apologies for lack of time and world enough etc; doubts; self-deprecating call to action; flirting with semi-colons and deconstruction...] BUILDING BACK FOR THE BETTER – A PERSPECTIVE FROM CARNEGIE UK TRUST Trailer: Carnegie UK Trust have used what we know from our long history of research and practice development to set out a series of propositions, backed up by recommendations of practical things that could be done to improve wellbeing. The propositions are: National wellbeing can be the goal The relationship between the state and the citizen can be reset The future can be local (as well as global) Our relationship with work can be remodelled We can build a new level of financial resilience Technology can be for all.

This is a quick one to get back in the swing. The photo above was taken in the lobby of Northern Stage in Newcastle, and is part of a page from the programme for a production of Barthomlew Fair in 1970, written by Sid Chaplin . (It's part of a really pleasing exhibition of old programmes and poster marking their 40th birthday.) As so often, Chaplin, who was chair of Northern Arts for some years, puts things both simply and evocatively. It struck me as a more powerful argument for the added value of the arts than anything else I've read recently, even though it doesn't suggest government investment is about profit in some peculiar equation necessary because everything in life is a commercial transaction. Or do I mean because. For those reading this on their crackberry without photos, hopefully these sentences will make you want to click through: 'Here we can draw power from the massed voltage whi"
