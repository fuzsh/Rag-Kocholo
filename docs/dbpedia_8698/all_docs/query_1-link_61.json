A blade swung joyously in battle, as when to a startled Faculty, she blazed contempt on a mediocre Dean. Too good a scholar to keep tapping at the last prescribed for academic footwork, too various, too rapid to repeat for years set lectures. Full-fledged, her flights abroad envisioned mastery she admired, heroes of free thought, the word, partnership in power. But the dark fell on her shining, as she fired anew. And the embers ache.\n\nPREFACE HAZEL ROWLEY: THE EMINENT BIOGRAPHER (1951–2011) WILLIAM J. VANDEN HEUVEL\n\nHazel Rowley wrote four biographies that were published before her untimely death in March 2011. They were amazing in their diversity. Hazel was an Australian, like the subject of her first biography, Christina Stead. A leading critic wrote that Hazel Rowley’s book would be recognized as one of the finest biographies ever written about an Australian.1 It was. And it is. It contributed greatly to the fact that Christina Stead is recognized in her native land as a major literary figure of the twentieth century. It is a measure of her brilliance that Hazel’s second book comprehended a totally different world, the world of African-American despair, hope and destiny. Hazel Rowley’s biography of Richard Wright, the enormously talented author of Black Boy and Native Son, took him from a sharecropper’s shack in Mississippi, through the Chicago South Side, to the literary magnetism of the Paris of Gertrude Stein and Albert Camus. Hazel restored his reputation, confronting those who had used the complexity of his politics and his hatred of racism to attack Wright’s integrity as an American. Critics hailed what she had done. Her doctoral dissertation had been about Simone de Beauvoir. Years later she came back to that subject, writing Tête-à-Tête, a literary portrait of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre, the extraordinary story of two passionate, free-thinking, existentialist philosophers and writers. Their intense and embattled relationship made for great biography. Hazel told the inspiring, sometimes repellent and unlikely tale of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre more completely and credibly than it had ever been told before. 1\n\nPeter Craven in his obituary, published in the Sydney Morning Herald, 10 March 2010.\n\nMagnificent Obsessions: Honouring the Lives of Hazel Rowley\n\nxiii\n\nAnd then in 2010, Hazel Rowley’s Franklin and Eleanor was added to the endless bibliography regarding the Roosevelts. As Jon Meacham, author of Franklin and Winston and a highly praised American biographer, wrote in his review, “Hazel Rowley has brought Franklin and Eleanor alive again in all of their complexity, humanity and greatness.”2 It was as though someone had turned on the light. She described for a new generation a bold and radical partnership as well as a marriage of enduring love. In her first appearance regarding the book, Hazel spoke on 3 November 2010 at Roosevelt House, a part of Hunter College in New York City. Her audience was transfixed. It was so appropriate that she would tell their story in the house where Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt had lived. She said then that a biographer has to have an open-minded attitude, one of understanding complex relationships, an attitude that respects historical truth. A biographer, she said, had to have an instinct for what she is writing about, an instinct that fills the gap between factual evidence and reality. As the Roosevelts had a special empathy for people in need, for the vulnerable, for the working class of America, for the necessity of a nation committed to social justice—so Hazel had an empathy for them and the broad, engaging and open world in which they—and she—thrived. She understood their struggles to find personal liberation—and in that freedom, to find strength and inspiration, never losing their ideals, never losing their capacity for both personal and human love. Hazel understood those qualities because she shared them. Stars in the heavens are not long visible to us mortals if only because our own lives have such a limited time on Earth. It is important that we recognize the brilliance of the stars when we see them—and in remembering Hazel Rowley we do that.\n\n2\n\nQuoted http://www.hazelrowley.com/roosevelt.html (sighted 5 February 2013).\n\nHAZEL ROWLEY’S PUBLICATIONS\n\nBooks 1993.

As a teenager, she wrote short stories and sent them off to publishers only to receive encouraging but regretful letters in return. Undaunted, she wrote a weekly magazine for me and moved on to being the editor of the school magazine. At an early age she began to record minute details of her life: Hazel’s personal journals amount to more than 50 years’ documentation of her life. In 1964, when Hazel was thirteen, the family spent a year in Switzerland where my father, Derrick, was on sabbatical leave from the University of Adelaide. We spent most weekends on walking expeditions throughout the Alps and one of Hazel’s first published pieces, “Hunting for edelweiss”, was written at that time. It is the story of how a descending fog made us lose our way high in the Swiss Alps. We eventually spent the night in an alpine hut with three very serious climbers who considered our clothes and lack of equipment to be rather ill advised. We had begun the walk in shorts, blouses and sandshoes, had no food and were not very proficient in French. The next day they roped us together and took us to the snow line to find edelweiss. I am sure that Hazel’s love of travel, languages and walking in the fresh country air began during these walks. Whether it was research, writing, love affairs, friendships or dislikes, Hazel never wanted to be mediocre or conformist: she embraced life with passion. She learnt French and German and travelled to many countries, making friends all around the world and generously encouraging others to join her adventures. Most holidays followed a theme that involved social history and plenty of time for writing and recording for Hazel. She always took a large number of books to read, notebooks to record all events and generally a big and heavy camera. Her main interest was “otherness”, “the outsiders”, those who didn’t\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nfit in, and she considered herself one of them. Hazel always managed to find the interesting stories in people’s lives: she was always the person to whom people told their secrets. Hazel had a passion for books and words, and for telling a story. She really threw herself into her subject matter: she lived in the country or the city where her subjects lived, she walked their streets, ate in their cafés and read and researched, and interviewed their relatives. She visited the southern states of America so that she could really understand the Jim Crow days and followed some of Richard Wright’s life journey. She visited Brazil to interview the family of Cristina Tavares who allegedly had an affair with Jean Paul Sartre in 1960 (Rowley, 2006). She followed up Christina Stead’s old friend, Edith Anderson, who at that time lived in East Berlin. This required an unusual amount of persistence and determination and Hazel was not afraid to ask for interviews nor to travel long distances to meet people in the interest of researching her books and perhaps finding a new angle. Hazel’s writing led her to interview Simone de Beauvoir in Paris in 1976, correspond with Harper Lee, the very reclusive author of To Kill a Mockingbird, in Alabama, and to go boating with filmmaker Claude Lanzmann off the south of France. She valued reliability and always kept her commitments and so even after “nine eleven” (11 September 2001) when Hazel was living in Boston and all aircraft in America were grounded, she still managed to bus up to Canada and fly down the coast to Cuba to meet me arriving from Australia. Hazel organised our time in Cuba so that we were immersed in the lives of Che Guevara and Ernest Hemingway. We peered in the windows of Ernest Hemingway’s house, Finca La Vigia, 10 miles outside Havana, kept exactly as it was during Ernest’s life, with stuffed animals on the walls and the whisky ready for pouring. And at the Hotel Ambos Mundos in Old Havana, we drank a mojito in memory of Ernest at the rooftop bar, visiting the room where he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls and marvelling over his old typewriter. Hazel always needed a wide group of supporters to keep up with her frantic pace. She drove herself really hard, was intellectually stimulating and exceedingly eloquent, especially when she was angry: there was no stopping Hazel when she was in full flight, no holding her back from saying her truth to someone, even if every one else considered it injudicious. Hazel could not resist! She was fearless, uncompromising, outspoken and passionate, and it didn’t matter who got in her way. After a day at her desk, Hazel loved nothing more than going for a long walk, striding forth in her inimitable style and talking, arguing, being provocative and emphatic, and loving being outdoors.\n\nHazel, My Sister\n\n3\n\nHazel took risks that scared others. She left a safe job in academia at Deakin University in 1996, sold her unit in Melbourne, packed up her possessions into two large suitcases and left for America, never to return permanently to Australia. Her contentious article, published in The Australian, “Universities Are Losing on Points” (Rowley, 1996) shows her boldness and her disinclination to hold back. The article begins: Forget the passion, embrace the “accountable”. Welcome to today’s academe. “Delightful as the pastime of measuring may be,” writes Virginia Woolf, “it is the most futile of all occupations, and to submit to the decrees of the measurers the most servile of attitudes.” She scorns the idea of “some professor with a measuring-rod up his sleeve”. These days, it’s government administrators who wield the rod. I’ve been an academic for 12 years. I’m a senior lecturer in literary studies. Research, writing and teaching is what I do best; it’s my passion. And I’ve just taken what they call an “early retirement package”. Why? The new regime is so opposed to the spirit of free inquiry and reflection, imagination or challenge, that it is no longer possible to think creatively, let alone stretch oneself to the limit of one’s intellectual capacity. The word from our leaders is loud and clear: “I don’t care what you publish. Just publish.” God knows who’s going to do the reading. Morale among academics is so low that I often wonder how some institutions manage to stay afloat. A question I have not once been asked by any of my colleagues is: “Why are you leaving?” Instead, it’s: “Lucky you. If I could, I’d be out of this place tomorrow.”\n\nAcademics around Australia applauded Hazel’s forthright article and rang her to tell her so. On this wave of fame Hazel left Australia, for she had decided that if she were to make it as a writer she would have to move to a country where a writer could live on their advances (and not do supplementary jobs) and where she would be freer to follow a wider choice of subjects. Her first biography in America was about a black American writer, Richard Wright. Even Hazel spoke of her hubris in undertaking such a project as a white Australian woman. The author’s blurb on the back cover was deliberately vague and lacked the usual photograph of the author. Two African-American critics were exuberant in their praise. Imagine Hazel’s joy when she later met Jake Lamar, an African American and Richard Wright scholar, who, in his review of Hazel’s book for the Washington Post, said it was “thorough and engrossing from the first page to the last”. He admitted to Hazel that while reading the book he had been unable to tell whether she was black or white and finally he had decided she was Jamaican! Hazel wrote about well-known people and her next biography was of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. This time she focused on a\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nfamiliar subject matter, as her PhD had been about Simone de Beauvoir. Unlike her previous works, however, in this one she wanted to look specifically at the unconventional relationship between the famous couple and how they made courageous and radical choices. Her last biography, about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, was perhaps her riskiest as she moved away from her focus on writers. So much had already been written about this famous couple. To write another book about them meant Hazel needed new information. Once again she embraced the task with passion, visiting the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park up the Hudson River (the first of the presidential libraries), Eleanor’s own home, Val Kill and Franklin’s Top Cottage, travelling to their holiday home on Campobello island in Canada and Franklin’s “little white house” and swimming complex in Warm Springs, Georgia. She moved back to New York from Paris, immersed herself in the history and politics of the era, became well-known by Roosevelt scholars and historians and, again, shared all this with her family and friends. What Hazel did in each of her books, Christina Stead: A Biography (1993), Richard Wright: The Life and Times (2001), Tête-à-Tête: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre (2005), and Franklin and Eleanor: An Extraordinary Marriage (2010), was to explore the emotional aspect of people’s lives—the loves, the passions, the fears, of people who have made great and significant contributions. Hazel was curious about couples who as a duo made each other greater than they were as individuals and what she wanted to discover was whether they lived up to their own philosophies. Hazel was mostly grateful to her father, Derrick for encouraging her to take risks and allowing her to be different. In her eulogy at his funeral she said: Dad was daring. He took risks, and he encouraged us to do so [...].[W]hen I told him that I wanted to leave my academic job and leave Australia and go to the US and write a book about the black writer, Richard Wright, he encouraged me. It was a hell of a risk I was taking at the age of 45, and it made me very nervous, but I sort of thought I knew what I was doing, and Dad could see that. He made me feel a whole lot stronger about it by listening to me, understanding what I was saying, and finally endorsing my decision. Dad taught me to think beyond traditional expectations, to think laterally. I learned that one can gain by being different. Dad always encouraged us kids with our interests. Music and books for me. We travelled. We met people from different places and cultures—Dad’s fellow scientists, postgraduate students, and so on. They would come with us to Coromandel Valley on Sundays, or come to dinner at the house, and we would listen to their stories and realize that Adelaide was a small town in a big wide world. It was a great privilege, this upbringing. Above all, it was fun.\n\nHazel, My Sister\n\n5\n\nI feel I’ve followed Dad’s path in many ways—the storytelling, the love of travel, the love of life, and he gave a great deal to others. I hope to follow his example in this.\n\nWho knows what Hazel might have written next? Several times she wrote proposals about the Hollywood Ten scriptwriters and directors who suffered so much during the McCarthy era in the United States. She felt that after September 2001 it became too difficult to get a publisher’s advance for this topic, but it still fascinated her. Just before she died, she was thinking of writing a series on independent women and putting herself into the story. The time between books was always difficult for Hazel—waiting for the publication to come out and then the reviews and responses, and simultaneously searching for a suitable subject for her next work. That is why Hazel’s family and friends have chosen to remember her life with the establishment of the Hazel Rowley Literary Fellowship which provides support for biographers to take risks, expand their horizons, discuss ideas and contribute to public intellectual life. It is designed for the time between books that Hazel always found unsettling until she determined a new direction. I feel extremely lucky to have had a sister such as Hazel. She made me feel special, showered me with presents and always had time for me. Hazel’s great gift was to make everyone who had a friendship with her feel very special and feel like she was their best friend—a truly wonderful gift. October 2012\n\nPOEM: FOR HAZEL JILL GLOYNE\n\nFootprints, like words on a brand new page stood out as I walked the beach today. “But where do they go, the child in me asked, “when the tide comes in to wash them away?” I thought for a while and then I knew that nothing is ever completely lost. The words we write, the deeds we do, dance in the light of a memory, like a spider’s web, hung with dew.\n\nCHAPTER ONE MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS: THEIRS AND OURS MARY ANN CAWS\n\nIn honour of Hazel Rowley, I wanted to say something about both biography and what impassions it, and us biographers. I’ve been thinking about how best to respond to Hazel’s brilliant and indeed passionate move from single biographies through double ones to her proposed multiple one of the Hollywood Ten. In view of the genre now called relational aesthetics, perhaps we might view hers as relational biographies— of an impassioned sort: how looking at two lives as a double entity can work perspectival wonders. Hazel concocted such interesting dialogues of double persons in relation: Jean-Paul and Simone, Eleanor and Franklin, and that whole dialogic genre in fact, delights—that is, lights up—the idea of what I am working on at the moment. Which is the very thing, large or small—more frequently the latter—enabling and ennobling our investigation. In my case, I think it is the detail. For the dialogue I’ve found most engaging along those lines is that of the person whose life I’m talking about with some strange other—some detail or image or then person who brings out in my subject something I’d not have seen otherwise. I’m interested in strangeness as the tone that impassions all our work, usually about our subject’s passions, and—in reflection—ours. Details are the keystones to the kind of dialogues I find myself involved with most frequently. Glancing over what kind of biographies I have written and wanted to write, what kinds of commissions I have been most excited by, and what kind of essays have most intrigued me and held me, it appears to me that it all has something to do with obsessiveness. That is, the creators with whom I have been involved by choice have each had some impassioning concern which has triggered my own in return, or, better, in exchange. So that is my response to and in doubleness, in dialogue with my subject, my\n\n8\n\nChapter One\n\nresponse to the subjects in dialogue with their peculiar fascinations as well as with each other. At first, my concern with obsessiveness seemed to me to be about a detail or several—as in one of my favourite books, Daniel Arasse’s Le Détail, in which you see, for example, a fly crawling up a seventeenth-century leg extended in some painting, or a splotch on a flowered skirt. Yet these details do illumine the whole, in fact, altogether rendering it viable and readable. It is just that they cannot always be seen with the naked eye, or the eye untrained, the mind unsuspecting. We don’t always notice. It is very frequently an intuitive guess that will open the door to the text or the painting for us, in some kind of special strangeness. It is very frequently an intuitive leap toward an image that will open the door to the text to the painting for us, with its transformative power. This is the primary tenet of the surrealist also. Let me first quote Gaston Bachelard, the philosopher of surrealism as he was called, on the kind of transformation that can take place, within the “phenomenon of the poetic image when the image emerges in consciousness like a direct product of the heart, the soul, the human being seized in actuality” (xiv). Louis Aragon defines the “vice called surrealism” as “the unruly and impassioned use of the stupefying image […] for each image each time forces you to revise the whole Universe. And there is for each person an image to find which will blot out the whole universe” (6). So that is what I will be, and have been, and will always be, no doubt, looking for. So the various obsessions of these creators I care so about, and ours, sometimes simple and relational, sometimes multiple, place them and us in dialogue with something whose singularity, whose peculiarity, gives the tone to their work. All the time I was editing Joseph Cornell’s diaries and source files, I found his manic attachment to sweet foods superbly engaging. His passion for Horn and Hardart’s pies and cakes, his obsession with hard candy, described a mad diet, the perfect key to his mad genius-like boxes, so many often sweet and always crazed constructions. As an example of my perhaps crazed constructions of brief biographies, I’ll begin with Marcel Proust, who himself obsesses many of us, how not?1 The way he relates to Robert de Montesquiou (look at those strange gloves in the painting by Boldini2 in the Musée d’Orsay, Paris!), to his mother and the mosaic in St Mark’s in Venice, the way he relates to everything, especially, 1\n\nAll the following obsessed and obsessional quotes are taken from Caws 2003. See the Musée d’Orsay’s website: http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/worksin-focus/painting/commentaire_id/count-robert-de-montesquiou-17788.html?cHash= c8b96845ae&tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bpid Li%5D=509.\n\n2\n\nMagnificent Obsessions: Theirs and Ours\n\n9\n\nperhaps, the Fortuny cloak which he takes from Vittore Carpaccio and places on the shoulders of Albertine, in The Fugitive. Listen to the way he describes it to Madame Straus: “There is quite a flowering of bell mouthed chimneys, as beautiful as a shower of tulips, and I would not be surprised if it had helped to inspire some of Whistler’s little Venice pictures.” Whistler and his work created another obsession: he asks Marie Nordlinger to tell her friend Charles Freer, whose collection of Whistler’s was the finest in the world, “that my room contains in its intentional nudity only a single reproduction of a work of art—Whistler’s Carlyle, whose cloak is as serpentine in its folds as the gown of Whistler’s Mother.” And, meeting Whistler at the home of Mallarmé’s mistress, Méry Laurent, he had actually, as he says, “appropriated his elegant gray gloves, which I’ve lost since.” But—ah, so Proustian of him—he refuses to let Mme Straus lend him her very own Fortuny coat, preferring to think only about the painting. That’s one of the sorts of obsessions I mean, with a single object of contemplation. Another of Proust’s obsessions that fascinates me is that with the concept of the series, for example, Monet’s “forty-eight sonnets”, as he puts it, of water lilies, or his twenty-eight paintings of Venice. The various parts of the series make up a perfect whole, like Monet’s paintings of the Rouen cathedral at various hours of the day. And, says Proust, his own book is constructed like that, of parts: “I dare not say ambitiously like a cathedral but quite simply like a dress.” We might indeed like to construct our biographies like that, so simply… Without much doubt, the most challenging and overall most compelling personage I was asked to deal with was the very, very great Henry James. His peculiarities far outdistanced those of anyone else around. Just think of his relation to Constance Fenimore Woolson, who was so attached to him that she thought he might follow her to Venice (mad woman!) She hurled herself, despairing, from a window in Venice, and of course he missed her funeral. A very few days after, he went to stay in the Casa Bondetti, the very same boarding house she had stayed in, chose to live in the same room as hers, slept in the very same bed she had slept in, and destroyed some of her papers. Then he piled her black dresses into a gondola he rented, asked to be rowed out to the lagoon, and threw them in the water, where they floated to the surface. One had to be pushed down with an oar.… It gets more peculiar, if possible. In Fenimore’s library, in James’s book entitled Essays in London, there is a note about the actress Fanny Kemble by Fenimore, who once said to her, after their introduction by James: “I am sorry Mr. James has introduced you to me. I shall be obliged to tell you now, that I shall not speak to you, or look at or be conscious of your existence even, during the entire evening” (Edel 3: 368). In the book itself, the inscription “Constance Fenimore Woolson from Henry James,” written in pencil, was\n\n10\n\nChapter One\n\nerased, but the name Henry James remained legible. The obsession with selfeffacement remains no less legible. And no less fascinating. In saying anything at all about the most celebrated of anyone I have ever written on, I will insist right off that Virginia Woolf seems to me to have been from the very beginning obsessed above all with the material and the timing of writing. Everywhere in her diaries, letters, and works, there is some sort of reflection on writing instruments: inks and pencils, and also on the speed of the transcription. This is of course not in any way strange, given her identification with the woman painter in To the Lighthouse, Lily Briscoe. Here is the focus of the thing, the real reason for the words and the works. In moments of her discouragement or unintensity, Lily comes through, to herself and to us, as motivated by her vision: “she remembered, all of a sudden, as if she had found a treasure, that she too had her work” (Woolf 1979: 98). My own favourite among Virginia’s clear obsessions with writing materials is that of the pencil in “Street Haunting,” used as a major excuse for her wandering about the city of London at twilight…You can feel the light dwindling outside as the illumination of the writing takes over. When this illumination extends to the writing and receiving of letters, a major part of Virginia Woolf’s life, I keep thinking of one of her most extraordinary stories, “The Lady in the Looking-Glass”, with its intrusion from outside, as the letters brought invade the private inside space of the house. Woolf speaks, in a letter to her sometime lover Vita Sackville-West, of the subtlety and nuances of coloured inks: “I must buy some shaded inks— lavenders, pinks, violets—to shade my meaning. I see I gave you many wrong meanings, using only black ink…No, No, I must buy my coloured inks…But no: I must get my coloured inks” (Woolf 1979-85: IV, 561-2). Here, as elsewhere in Virginia Woolf, the repetition marks her obsession with the material of communication. Her close friend and lover Vita Sackville-West, whose writings I assembled with the encouragement of her son Nigel Nicolson, had her own obsessions, with one love after another, and primarily, I would say, not just with Violet Trefusis (who adored her and clung to her pathetically), but with Virginia Woolf. Upon her desk in the tower at Sissinghurst rests, even now, the photo of Virginia…. And, when Virginia drowned herself, Vita was convinced that—had she known the extent of Virginia’s despair—she might have saved her, whom she loved. And I, of course, like many of Bloomsbury readers, have remained obsessed by Virginia’s Orlando as Vita. How not? One of Virginia Woolf’s most memorable relations is that to the highly unusual and supercomplicated painter and writer, Carrington, the most self-\n\nMagnificent Obsessions: Theirs and Ours\n\n11\n\neffacing person I have ever encountered in writing. Carrington was herself haunted by her relation to Virginia, whom she loved, as it were, too much. And then, shortly before Carrington killed herself, Virginia went to see her, worried about Carrington’s state of mind. Carrington, generally feeling herself a failure, is obsessed by her falling short about many things, some in relation to Virginia, who writes, on 12 March 1932, in her diary, of her last visit to Carrington. She quotes Carrington: “I sent a telegram, but I do everything wrong. I thought you didn’t get it […]. I did everything for Lytton. But I’ve failed in everything else.” We had tea & broken biscuits” (Woolf 1979-85: IV, 81-2). The brokenness of the biscuits is heart-breaking, as is—for many of us—much about Carrington. The image of Carrington will continue to haunt her: “Talk of Carrington: how long shall we talk of Carrington?” (Woolf 1979-85: IV, 85) And, later, “A saying of Leonard’s comes into my head ‘Things have gone wrong somehow.’[…] I saw all the violence & unreason crossing in the air: ourselves small; a tumult outside: something terrifying: unreason. Shall I make a book out of this? It would be a way of bringing order & speed again into my world” (Woolf 1979-85: IV, 103). Speed, there is Virginia once more, caring most terribly about the speed of her living and writing—often she compares her writing to mounting a horse, taking off at a gallop. Carrington herself had what I think of as an obsession with secrecy. She loved to correspond with many lovers at a time, hiding one text from one of them from another, those from Gerald Brenan from Lytton, even at the price of having two envelopes, one for the secreted text. She never exhibited or sold a painting….Virginia commissioned some of her drawings, but to the outside world, Carrington did not relate as an artist. Just so, her paintings have in them a sort of secret, I believe… Her most extraordinary painting, the portrait of Lytton Strachey, she wanted above all not to show to anyone else: she desired, most desperately, to keep what she most cared about, most hidden. She writes to Lytton, on 1 January 1917 (Carrington: 52), starting the year off by wondering what he will think of it. I sit here, almost every night—it sometimes seems—looking at your picture, now tonight it looks wonderfully good, and I am happy. But then I dread showing it. I should like to go on always painting you every week, wasting the afternoon loitering, and never, never showing you what I paint. It’s marvellous having it all to oneself. No agony of the soul. Is it vanity? No, because I don’t care for what they say. I hate only the indecency of showing them what I have loved (Carrington: 181).\n\n12\n\nChapter One\n\nThere is always a them outside her private self, haunting her. And then her own judgement prevented her action and agency. She avoids what she knows is the most important thing, her painting, and continues to dwell on her nondoing: “For really I used every excuse not to do any proper painting. It’s partly I have such high standards that I can’t bear going on with pictures when I can see they are amateurish and dull” (Carrington: 464). We know that this self-effacingness is often characteristic of women—not wanting to advance ourselves; and yet, Carrington seems to me to carry this to unexpected lengths. The two most recent biographies I did, both as brief as can be, both had as their subjects two of the very least self-effacing of artists: Picasso and Dali. As for Picasso, there is no ambiguity at all. He was, overall and definitively, in love with his self-portraiture. We have his portraits from very young to very old, when a skull represents, quite entirely, his being. No problem: his eyes and their “Mirada fuerte”, as John Richardson so memorably and accurately put it, are the first thing you notice in any of his photographs or self-portraits. He is first and foremost a painter, seeing. My fascination with one of his works is never-ending, and it concerns three creators: himself, the photographer Dora Maar who loved him, and Apollinaire, whom he loved. His fear of death, it is said, caused him, superstitiously, to not put Apollinaire’s head on the statue he had been commissioned to execute in his honour, so he substituted that of Dora Maar. The first one cast, in bronze, had to be replaced, for—believing the stories that Maillol had urinated upon his statues to give them a proper patina, Picasso had done the same with Dora’s head. That the head was stolen, then replaced, makes this peculiar story more peculiar. Still. But, unquestionably, my last subject, Salvador Dali, takes the non-selfeffacing cookie. Dali was obsessed by many things, including Salvador Dali, but also—and, in a somewhat odder fashion—with sea urchins. His favourite celebratory meal consisted entirely of sea urchins, a Gatorado. His repeating concern with Millet’s Angelus is super well-known, and pointedly clear. Above all, of most interest to me, was his overriding obsession with the poet Garcia Lorca. “I consider you the only true genius in the world,” he writes to Lorca. And again: To My Beloved If I didn’t give you a sign of my love and friendship in truth, my love, I’d hardly seem attentive. Have the goodness, therefore, to accept my offer:\n\nMagnificent Obsessions: Theirs and Ours\n\n13\n\nsoul, life and heart. With an unequalled affection love wide and without end, I only feel happy when I can be by your side. (text beneath a bowl of fruit)3\n\nFor each other, they were St Sebastien, who represented them and how they were related, in his sensuality and his suffering. Everywhere in his paintings, you see the head or somehow the shape of Lorca, alive or dead, as a fruit bowl, in Honey is Sweeter than Blood, in Little Ashes. Dali was bedazzled by Lorca, and, of course, vice versa. I greatly enjoy seeing Lorca in Dali’s texts and art and imagination, and just want, in concluding, to salute his iteration of self-signatures in that most magnificent of novels, his Hidden Faces. Lastly, in tribute to Hazel’s multiple inspirations, and to her vibrancy in all things, written and lived, I want to end with that triple signature of the statue to Apollinaire, loving how things are signed, in dialogue and in polylogue. Hazel signed everything vibrantly, from single to double to polylogue. It is always impassioned, relational work, her biographies. I want to say how these are, all of them, Hazel’s and the others, magnificent obsessions, responsible for the peculiarly compelling attraction we feel for the persons and creators they so superbly fascinated, and whose works they so grandly obsessed.\n\nBibliography Aragon, Louis. 2004.

Gallimard, both Sartre’s and Beauvoir’s publisher, had shown an interest in the book but, to make sure that nothing in it would offend their legal heirs, the publisher had given those heirs the text to read. Arlette Elkaïm, Sartre’s adopted daughter, and Sylvie Le Bon, Beauvoir’s adopted daughter, each of whom was also the literary executor for their adoptive parent, took a close look at the text. While Sylvie Le Bon approved of it, Arlette Elkaïm threatened Gallimard to withdraw all rights to future publications of Sartre’s writings if they were to publish Rowley’s biography. It was a threat Gallimard took seriously, all the more since they were splitting royalties with her as Sartre’s literary executor. Gallimard, therefore, withdrew its option and Grasset considered publishing it, but only if the text could be edited to conform with “la loi française sur la vie privée” (the French law on privacy), which stipulates that a protagonist in a biography has the right to demand that anything concerning his/her private life or that even is not to his/her liking be removed. A condition, admitted Olivier Nora, chairman of Grasset, which makes biographers’ research almost impossible. “And that is the reason why in France we don’t have much of a tradition of biography. Every time we publish a biography we take a risk”(Rowley, 2009).\n\n1\n\nThis piece is based on and inspired by Hazel’s own detailed article “Censorship in France” in the American Scholar (2009).\n\n16\n\nChapter Two\n\nGrasset’s lawyers removed what Arlette Elkaïm had asked to be cut, and the book was then published in September 2006 under the title: Tête-à-Tête, Beauvoir et Sartre, un pacte d’amour. Pascale Fautrier, the author of a review of Tête-à-Tête in the French daily paper Libération, dated 12 December 2006, refers to Rowley’s book as “une singulière histoire d’amour”, which is closer to the title of the 2006 American paperback edition: Tête-à-Tête: The Tumultuous Lives and Loves of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. “Pacte d’amour” stresses the love that bound Beauvoir and Sartre, but avoids detailing the particularities of such a pact. Apart from one offensive review by the French literary critic Josyane Savigneau in Le Monde, that first French edition of Tête-à-tête was well received and Hazel Rowley gave several interviews on both radio and television literary programs, while Lire magazine named it the best literary biography of the year. All was well until Claude Lanzmann, a former lover of Beauvoir and an obvious protagonist in Hazel Rowley’s biography, threatened Grasset with a law suit if they did not immediately recall the book from French bookshops. Reluctant to get embroiled in lengthy and expensive court proceedings that would have involved, among other things, a payment of 75,000 euros to Lanzmann, Grasset chose to withdraw the book. The book was then recalled from all bookstores in France and pulped. In his memoirs, The Patagonian Hare, published in English translation in 2012, Lanzmann now gives his own version of Grasset’s decision: “I didn’t even need to go to court,” he writes, “the publisher quickly realized his mistake, stopped distributing the book and reprinted it, having removed the most unbearably vile and stupid passages” (2012: 161). Rowley’s book was, indeed, reprinted in January 2008, almost a year and a half later, after the cuts were made, cuts which required her to go through a long and tedious updating of endnotes and provide new page numbers and a new index. What Lanzmann omits to say in his memoirs is that those passages that displeased him were, in point of fact, quotes from material that had already been published in book form and from authorized recorded interviews. Curious to check what had so infuriated Claude Lanzmann, I looked for a copy of the first French printing of Tête-à-Tête. To no avail. Even a copy of the second edition of 2008 was hard to find. Aware that the book was “going to lose money,” the French publisher, Hazel Rowley wrote, “reprinted only 1000 copies—a token print run” and very soon the “book was nowhere to be seen” (2009). At the time of its publication in January 2008, I checked with several French bookstores but none had restocked it and French readers who wanted to read Hazel Rowley’s\n\nThe Rocambolesque Peregrinations of a Biography in France\n\n17\n\nbook had no choice but to read it in its original, unexpurgated American edition, which the Village Voice bookshop kept permanently in stock. As I was going through the new French edition, that of 2008, to compare it with the original American edition, I found that one of the passages that was missing in the French edition concerned Claude Lanzmann’s sister. Known under her stage name as Evelyn Rey, she had acted in the role of the seductive, narcissist Estelle in Sartre’s play No Exit. A stunning woman of great beauty and intelligence, but emotionally fragile as a result of a couple of disastrous love affairs, she had “succumbed to Sartre’s known attraction to ‘drowning women’” (Rowley 2006: 61). The incriminating passage that was cut refers to a quote from the memoirs of Evelyn Rey’s divorced husband, Serge Rezvani, who in Le Testament amoureux “claims that Claude Lanzmann acted as ‘a procurer’ for his sister” (Rowley 2005: 223). In a recorded interview he granted to Hazel Rowley, Jacques Lanzmann (Claude and Evelyn’s brother) confirmed this statement: “Yes, Claude regularly served as ‘Madame’ for Evelyne” (Rowley 2005: 223). “Surely,” Hazel Rowley wrote, “if anyone understands the implications of censorship for writers, journalists, filmmakers, it would be Claude Lanzmann! Was he not the director of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, “composed almost entirely of interviews”, and “the former journalist, who inherited Sartre and Beauvoir’s left-wing journal, Les Temps modernes” (Rowley 2009). One thing has to be stressed, if Claude Lanzmann required cuts, he never denied that what Hazel Rowley wrote was, in fact, true. He simply did not like it. As Olivier Nora of Grasset explained to Hazel: “it does not matter if these same facts appear in 17 different books, the notion of ‘public domain’ doesn’t exist in France” (Rowley 2009). One rare quality of Rowley’s that is predominant throughout her four published biographies, and one she was particularly proud of, is her nonjudgmental approach to her protagonists. Her first prerogative as a biographer was to allow them to speak for themselves through their writings. In Tête-à-Tête she respects fully and faithfully Beauvoir’s and Sartre’s credos and aspirations for transparency, and she minutely documents the contradictions that appeared over the past years in several memoirs by their respective “contingent” lovers. Since Sartre’s and Beauvoir’s deaths, Hazel Rowley writes in her biography, several people, notably Bianca Biennenfeld, have revealed that Beauvoir set “Sartre up with her young lady friends, knowing exactly what would happen” (Rowley 2005: 223). No doubt, Beauvoir’s and Sartre’s lives had not been as transparent as they claimed in their respective writings, journals and private correspondence.\n\n18\n\nChapter Two\n\nAs recently as 16 August 2012, in a radio broadcast entitled “Beauvoir, nécessaire et contingente”, the French philosopher Michel Onfray made reference to Hazel Rowley’s biography, but he went a step further, hinting that Beauvoir and Sartre had used their “contingent” lovers to serve their own interests, aware, but heedless, of the harm they were causing them. As I was listening to that radio broadcast, I was wondering about Lanzmann’s reaction. Lanzmann, who is so protective of his “icons” and of his own image, but who seems to care so little about applying his own principles to others. In his memoir, The Patagonian Hare, he does not hesitate to trash Hazel Rowley’s biography and stain her name: “Tête-à-Tête,” he writes, “the umpteenth American biography of the Sartre-Beauvoir partnership, was made up entirely of petty spite and sordid rumours intended for an ignorant public” (Lanzmann: 160). Ignorant, today’s French readers are certainly not, and Beauvoir and Sartre are no longer the French icons they once were. Had she been here to read that passage by Lanzmann, Hazel Rowley would have responded with one of her razor-sharp and witty repartees. But, before leaving us, she had, at least, the satisfaction of knowing that Lanzmann had not been able to stop the original American version of Tête-à-Tête from being translated and published in extenso into no fewer than fourteen languages around the world.\n\nBibliography Lanzmann, Claude. 2012.

During that period we engaged in many a fast walk along the beach track from Robe Street to the point where Elwood meets Brighton. It was a 5km round trip and took us around 50 minutes. We must have done that walk dozens of times. A lot was going on in these years for Hazel, and for me as well. I remember Hazel, at 40, being sensitive to changes in relationships with some of her friends as a result of their becoming parents for the first or second time. I myself was in my mid-forties, and my second son had recently been born. On our walks together we often discussed parenting and children and family dynamics in relation to ourselves and our mutual friends and their transformation into parents and marital partners. Hazel loved to comment on the quirks, excesses and contradictions she observed in her friends’ parental behaviours and practices, but she was also very impressed with the sacrifices, responsibility and loving strength which not-so-young new parents brought to their changed situations. That families and parent-child relationships were both strong and enduring interests of Hazel’s will be apparent to anyone who has read any or all of her marvellous, empathic and insightful biographies. I have just concluded a complete reading of all four of them this Spring, and was taken by the clarity and depth of the observations Hazel makes regarding her subjects’ relationship with their parents (and siblings). To me this comes across very powerfully in her account of Christina Stead’s relationship with her own father, in Eleanor and Franklin’s relationship with Franklin’s mother, and in Richard Wright’s relationship with his own mother and his daughters. Hazel was also keenly interested in\n\n20\n\nInterlude\n\nhow the children of her biographical subjects (where there were children) experienced them as parents and how the subjects themselves were affected by parenthood. However, what figured even larger in our conversations than parenting, was the subject of men and women and their relationships. And it was the quality and character of these relationships which fascinated Hazel. She writes in her introduction to the Australian edition of Franklin and Eleanor “How did that famous marriage actually work? […] I invite you to share my journey into their private world, their life as a couple” (Rowley 2010: xiii). She writes in the preface to Tête-à-Tête: “This is not a biography of Sartre and Beauvoir. […] This is the story of a relationship” (Rowley 2006: xv). In the “Meet Hazel Rowley” section of Tête-à-Tête, she writes, “The nice thing about being a writer, of course, is that life and work blur into one. Whatever you do, you can tell yourself it’s experience, and that’s what a writer needs.” “When I finish writing”, she explains, “it is like the breakup of a love affair. I am emotionally exhausted” (Rowley 2006: 8). In the early 90s, Hazel was gathering a lot of experience, including its accompanying emotional exhaustion. She and I were both dealing with the blossoming and withering of various complex relationships and this was a hot topic. I was impressed by Hazel’s curiosity about men and her willingness to expose herself to emotional challenges and opportunities. I was also struck by her willingness to subject her involvement with men to very sharp scrutiny. She freely described, and analysed, the emotional and intellectual and political strands of her attachments. Even when she was furious at what she felt was an unforgiveable deceit or betrayal, or disappointed by what she’d experienced as remarkable social and intellectual miscues in the behaviour of one of the men in her life then, she was often entertained, as I was, by the realization that she’d been fanciful and unrealistic in her desires or expectations. I remember her saying shortly after her Stead biography was completed, and before she left for the USA to commence her work on the life of Richard Wright, that she’d like to find a confident (but not bombastic), bright, humorous, attractive and trustworthy man who’d attained enough success or achievement in his work not to be anguishing or in torment about his career and who could love her whilst respecting her freedom and independence. Many years before Tête-à-Tête we’d had several conversations about the Sartre-Beauvoir relationship, which both intrigued and disturbed Hazel. It seemed to me, that for her, it was this legendary relationship which preeminently formed the problematic existential, intellectual, and politically engaged base-line standard of coupledom. This was the standard, if not the “gold standard”, by which Hazel at that time assessed her own progress\n\nHazel at 40\n\n21\n\nacross the minefield of “responsible” loving. The polarities of desire, intimacy, or, as the French would say “jouissance”, and the quotidian mundanity of enduring monogamous commitment were simultaneously attractive and repulsive to her in their implications for a satisfying and meaningful life. As Hazel wrote in her preface to Tête-à-Tête, she’d been “exhilarated— intoxicated, one might say” (as she puts it) earlier in her life by what she’d learned of Beauvoir. “Who wanted monogamy when one could have freedom and stability, love affairs and commitment?” I think Hazel would perhaps have enjoyed Adam Phillips’ suggestion that “The only way we can test our infidelity is through monogamy. A lot of confusion is created by the belief that it is the other way round” (1999: 88). Also of vital importance to Hazel was a developed political engagement, and its integration with personal life and relationships. She wanted the men in her life to be passionately critical of social and economic injustice and she abhorred dullness, complacency and asocial self-absorption. She liked spirited and lively men who would reflect her own energies, but I also knew her to be susceptible to the mysterious attraction of conflicted and emotionally complicated men who struggled with their own identity, mood, and relationship problems. The early nineties was also a period when Hazel was dissociating herself from her teaching role at Deakin, and making the transition to becoming a full-time biographer. She made it clear to me that she was disenchanted with academic preciousness, inter- and intra-faculty competitiveness, theoretical fashions, and pretentiousness. She was particularly troubled by the ostensible political disengagement apparent to her in the field of French-derivative postmodern and post-structuralist literary and critical theory. She could be very caustic indeed about abstruse theoretical posturing if it struck her as a façade for critical vacuity. She did, however, like creative precociousness and was prepared to forgive fellow academics some unsoundness if they could inspire as teachers. Her impressions of American academics were more critical than the impressions she’d formed of Australians. She wrote to me from Austin Texas in 1994 to say that “Academics here are simply manic, terribly pressured. The puritanical work ethic is overwhelming. Americans work terribly long hours and confuse that with hard work. It’s not the same thing, actually.” Hazel respected women who weren’t too self-conscious or abstract about their feminism, and who had managed creatively and coherently to integrate their feminist principles and values with their personal and professional lives. She was not impressed with women she’d encountered who’d professed their feminism very publicly and professionally, but affected to be unaware of\n\n22\n\nInterlude\n\nhow they deployed their own sexual power in their social and personal lives, particularly when it came to competing with their own female friends and colleagues. Interestingly her early contact with American women in 1994 led her to write that “American women, in particular, strike me as thoroughly neurotic, not very confident of themselves at all. I didn’t expect that.” Given all her own attributes, it had been a revelation to me during the years of our walks, to discover how sensitive Hazel was to her image and appearance as a woman. She compared herself intensely with the styles and mannerisms, clothing, attractiveness, brilliance or brightness, and sexuality of other women. She could perform a kind of analytical judgment on a tightrope of admiration and envy, guilt and pride, satirical wit and amused ironic self-deprecation which was highly entertaining as well as enlightening. She could also formulate a scrupulous and quasi-affectionate depiction of others which avoided the traps and temptations of misanthropic cynicism while satisfying her very deep curiosity about what made people tick. Another revelation for me at that time was when Hazel and I took some Latin American dance lessons for a short while and the “Pom” in her was exorcised by our dance teacher who overcame her reserve with his Latino verve. This must have stood her in good stead because 18 months later, she wrote me from Austin to say “Austin is also a music capital, and the bars play Latino Salsa type stuff (boy, you should see them Lambada here!) blues, country and western, South American. I haven’t danced as much for years.” Hazel’s love of the “natural” or rural environment was also impressed upon me at this time. She wrote in the guest book at my partner’s house in Lorne in February 1993: “These are the things that make it so glorious to come here—stare into the greedy eyes of the local ‘kookies’ as they eye off the red meat in your hand. And the smell of the gum trees in the rain. And the patter of the rain on the roof. And no telephone. The crackle of the fire, the scent of burning wood, curling up in bed (even if it is by myself) and listening to the rain drip through the leaves.” Anyone familiar with her biographies will recognize this sensibility oft repeated. I’d like to conclude this essay with a quote from Hazel about her biography writing and which characterizes the Hazel I knew at 40. “One thing about my books: they are all, in their different ways, voyages of discovery. I write books to learn, to stretch my horizons. These voyages are full of risk and passion. A lot of energy and empathy goes into putting yourself in someone else’s shoes” (Rowley 2006: 8). I think this is why Hazel’s biographies are so luminous (and novelistic) in their narrative attractiveness. I am forever grateful that Hazel allowed me to know something of her energy and empathy as she worked on writing Christina Stead’s life. Hazel’s battle to learn and write of the quality and\n\nHazel at 40\n\n23\n\ntexture of Christina Stead’s well-concealed inner life taught her the difficult knowledge that “each moment of our lives is invisibly shaped by our unpruned, tangled past” (Rowley 1993: ix). Hopefully a comparably brilliant writer and biographer will soon take on the task of rendering the invisible in Hazel’s life as visibly as she allowed me to glimpse it in that brief period when she was 40.\n\nBibliography Phillips, Adam. 1999.

My life first crossed with Hazel’s when in the early 1990s she read my life of Vladimir Nabokov as she was revising her life of Christina Stead. In 1994, she invited me to a conference she was organizing at Deakin University, Melbourne, on “Biography, Autobiography and Testimony.” I will never forget how touched I was when she told me, in a corner of her St Kilda apartment, that as she was writing her Stead biography she had repeatedly consulted my Nabokov biography for inspiration and encouragement. I have spent perhaps only ten days in Hazel’s company, in Australia and in the West, South and East of the US. But the intensity of her presence made up for the short duration. I can still picture her, her long legs siphoning up space, her thick hair flying behind her like a wave of turbulence, her head turning towards me, askew, to ask another abrupt question, as she almost interrogates me with her chin. We shared a passion for biography, but unlike me she was a serial biographer, first a serial monogamist, and more recently a serial bigamist. When we were writing our first biographies, biography was theoretically unfashionable, but for both of us that only added extra spice, and of course if biography was ever theoretically unfashionable it was always practically unstoppable—especially hers. You have to write a kind of biography when you draft a reference for someone, and in that sense I’ve written Hazel’s biography quite a few times, for promotion, for fellowships, and in order to help her land an American Green Card as “an alien of extraordinary ability.” Letters of reference are biography as panegyric, and Hazel wrote to me that she didn’t recognize\n\nBiography / Autobiography / Testimony\n\n25\n\nherself in my picture of her as extraordinary alien. Let me quote the end of that reference. I wanted to appeal to America’s sense of its own best values: Australia lost Dr Rowley through being too small-minded. America has benefited for centuries from accepting people of outstanding gifts and promise who rejected the cramped mental landscapes they came from. Here is a chance for the US to win again.1\n\nAnd of course the US did win by allowing space for Hazel to continue to flourish. Our personal lives didn’t often overlap, but our publishable Lives did rather more. If I map the intersection of her biographies and mine, the 1930s and 1940s turn out to be our common ground. My biographical subjects have been Nabokov, back in the 1980s, and Karl Popper, in the late 1990s and the earlyish 2010s. I am starting 2012 by awakening Popper from a decade of cryogenic suspension, after a dozen books that distracted me from him. Hazel’s subjects, Christina Stead, Richard Wright, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, certainly had their most productive years in common in the 1930s and 1940s. I hadn’t quite realized until I had to write this that Hazel’s and my Lives intersected in this era. Nabokov wrote his most important Russian novel in the 1930s and made his momentous switch to America and to English in 1940; Popper published his two defining works, Logik der Forschung (The Logic of Scientific Discovery) in 1934 and The Open Society in 1945. From her early work on Simone de Beauvoir, Hazel was interested in the public intellectual and of course became one herself. Popper became a philosopher of science in the early 1930s, and after working out his ideas in that sphere had critiques to make, in political philosophy, of both fascist and Marxist ideas. But he thought that he should not voice them so long as socialism might offer a possible bulwark against fascism within Austria. As soon as the Anschluss occurred in 1938, as soon as Hitler acquired Austria, Popper, who had seen war coming ever since he first read Mein Kampf, began to write what he thought of as his “war effort” (1974: 113), the two-volume The Open Society and Its Enemies. People had assumed that however unpleasant dictatorship might be, it must at any rate be more efficient than the disunited voices of democracy. In The Open Society Popper showed that the support for dictatorship within the Western philosophical tradition, in Plato and in Hegel and Marx, was deeply flawed, and that societies open to disagreement and criticism were in the long run far more efficient.\n\n1\n\nThe reference dates from September 1997.\n\n26\n\nChapter Three\n\nTruly original minds, virtually by definition, are hard to predict. Popper was of Jewish stock but his parents had converted to Christianity before he was born: not to Catholicism, the easy route to acceptance in Vienna, but to Protestantism, an escape from the stringent anti-Jewish quotas while resisting any reproach for social climbing. Popper later in life rejected being classified as a Jew: “but that was Hitler’s criterion,” he insisted.2 He also refused to travel to Israel, because of its treatment of the Palestinians, and because he thought Zionism another form of tribalism, of the “closed society”.3 And he also thought, after the war, that persecuting the Germans who had perpetrated the horrors of the Holocaust was pointless; that it was best to forgive, to accept yet another blot on history’s pages, as much stained in blood as written in ink, and move on.4 Nabokov, by contrast, saw himself always as a private intellectual, not a public one. He considered his foremost duty, apart from the duty to his family, was to his art. He continued to live in Germany after Hitler came to power, and carried on with his writing. But he had a Russian- Jewish wife and lived with her in the apartment of her Russian-Jewish cousin. In the months after Hitler came to power, he broke off what he knew would be his greatest Russian novel—indeed it became probably the greatest Russian novel of last century—The Gift,5 to write another, the anti-totalitarian Invitation to a Beheading, a defence of the right to be different.6 As soon as his family were out of Germany, in 1937, he wrote an anti-totalitarian story, “Cloud, Castle, Lake”, again demonstrating the horror of the demand that all should conform to the pressures or the pleasures of the group.7 Of course he also showed his rejection of conformity in quite another way, in writing about subjects that had nothing to do with the political situation, like, in late 1939, The Enchanter, a first foray at the Lolita theme. After reaching America, he began writing, as soon as Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, another antitotalitarian novel, in English. Like Popper’s Open Society, Bend Sinister (published in 1947, but written during the war) thought ahead to the post-war world and the dangers of a dictatorship of the right or the left, or for that matter of a consumerist or simply conformist dictatorship of the majority in 2\n\nBrian Boyd interview with Sir Isaiah Berlin, 19 December 1996. Brian Boyd interview with Melitta Mew, 25 November 1996. 4 Brian Boyd interview with Melitta Mew, 27 June 1995. 5 Nabokov’s The Gift was published serially 1937-38 and in book form in Russia in 1952. 6 Invitation to a Beheading was published serially 1935-36 and in book form in Russian, 1938. 7 “Cloud, Castle, Lake”, published in Russian, 1937, was translated with Peter Pertzoff, in 1941. 3\n\nBiography / Autobiography / Testimony\n\n27\n\nAmerica. The novel’s hero is a philosopher who refuses to lend his world renown to support the new dictatorship in his central European country, but who also thinks, mistakenly, that his fame will protect him, that his genius means he can ignore the political situation around him. His miscalculation costs his young son’s life and then his sanity and his own life. Recently I assessed a PhD dissertation on American literature entitled “Don’t Mention the War: Repression, Realism, and the American Uncanny 1945-1955”. Its thesis was that, in the decade after World War II, American novelists repressed any mention of both the Holocaust and the atomic bombs dropped on Japan: a failure of testimony, if you like, to use the terms of the conference to which Hazel first invited me. According to the thesis, no postwar novelist testified about what now look like the events that morally distinguish this war from all others. In assessing the dissertation, I pointed out that writers of historical fictions can write about eras they never lived though, because none of their readers lived through them either, but writers living in America and dealing with contemporary subjects would have been foolish to engage with the Holocaust or the atomic bomb at a time when so little information was available about the personal impact of these events. And writers do not generally tackle such topical topics unless they have first-hand experience. Primo Levi had to endure Auschwitz, and could write about it, in Italian—although his book did not become widely known, even in its first language, until 1958. Holocaust survivors who came to the US were too busy making lives for themselves and knew too little English to write of their experience. Kurt Vonnegut did not publish on his experience of the 1944 firebombing of Dresden until 1969. In the late 1940s and 1950s, there was a sweep-it-under-the-carpet, geton-with-it ethos, the converse of the modern preoccupation with keeping recent wounds open and even having counsellors stick their fingers in the wounds to ask why they’re not healing. (Recent evidence suggests that immediate post-trauma counselling exacerbates rather than allays the trauma.) I can imagine Hazel would have been impatient with both the 1950 and the 2010 responses. But we need to remember, if we’re dealing with history, what was actually available at a given moment, about, say, the Holocaust, and how available it was in practice, not just in theory. In MetaMaus, the book I will end with, Art Spiegelman notes and shows that in Winston Churchill’s two-volume 1958 Time-Life history of World War II, Jews take up exactly one word (44). An exception that proves the rule about fiction writers in America and their treatment of the Holocaust was Vladimir Nabokov. Not only did he continue to live in Germany past Hitler’s coming to power, with his RussianJewish wife, and in the apartment of her cousin, and with a new baby who\n\nChapter Three\n\n28\n\nwould be Jewish by Hitler’s criterion, but his father, as a criminologist, an editor and a politician, had been the foremost gentile champion of Jews in Russia before the Revolution, and Nabokov himself had Russian Jews as his closest friends in two generations in the Russian emigration. His homosexual brother and close Jewish friends died in German concentration camps. And he did write of European tyranny and brutality in this period, in Bend Sinister, during the war years; and about the Holocaust in his 1948 story “Signs and Symbols,” where an old Jewish woman who has immigrated to the United States from Germany looks at her photograph album, identifying images: Aunt Rosa, a fussy, angular, wild-eyed old lady, who had lived in a tremulous world of bad news, bankruptcies, train accidents, cancerous growths—until the Germans put her to death, together with all the people she had worried about (1995: 597).8\n\nIn Pnin, in an episode composed in 1955 and first published in 1957: Nabokov writes, unforgettably: because, if one were quite sincere with oneself, no conscience, and hence no consciousness, could be expected to subsist in a world where such things as Mira’s death were possible. One had to forget—because one could not live with the thought that this graceful, fragile, tender young woman with those eyes, that smile, those gardens and snows in the background, had been brought in a cattle car to an extermination camp and killed by an injection of phenol into the heart, into the gentle heart one had heard beating under one’s lips in the dusk of the past. And since the exact form of her death had not been recorded, Mira kept dying a great number of deaths in one’s mind, and undergoing a great number of resurrections, only to die again and again, led away by a trained nurse, inoculated with filth, tetanus bacilli, broken glass, gassed in a sham shower bath with prussic acid, burned alive in a pit on a gasoline-soaked pile of beech wood. According to the investigator Pnin had happened to talk to in Washington, the only certain thing was that being too weak to work (though still smiling, still able to help other Jewish women), she was selected to die and was cremated only a few days after her arrival in Buchenwald (1989: 135).\n\nNabokov was serving the special needs of his complicated art, but he was also paying testimony, conjuring up on a human and immediate and imaginable scale the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\n8\n\nFirst published 1948.\n\nBiography / Autobiography / Testimony\n\n29\n\nIf there is one truth that biography by its very nature celebrates, it is the distinctiveness of individuals, not just at a sample moment but over a whole life. Nabokov, not of Jewish stock, did not want guilt for the Holocaust to go unrebuked, and after the war he refused ever to cross into Germany. Popper, of Jewish stock and much more a public intellectual, wanted the crimes of the Holocaust not to be pursued, and refused ever to enter Israel. Their roles as public intellectuals and as testifiers to the horrors of history reflect their unique personalities and predispositions, and their unique autobiographies and biographies. As a writer Nabokov testifies within, and by means of, his literary art. As a philosopher, Popper engages immediately with the philosophical tradition that he thinks may give apparent intellectual support to dictatorships of the right or the left, but although he lost many of his own extended family in the war, he never sought afterwards to keep the offense alive. Everyone who knew Hazel Rowley remembers her passionate antipathy to racial injustice. For that reason I turn now to another person who also focused his energies on the 1930s and 1940s, and who has testified about the Holocaust, with exceptional force and impact, and opens up interesting new angles on the problems and possibilities of biography and autobiography: the comics artist Art Spiegelman. I rate him the most important person to work in any narrative medium since Nabokov. Many also rate him the greatest artist in the history of comics. Spiegelman came to world attention outside the world of avant-garde comics with Maus, his graphic narrative of his parents’ experience, before, during, and after Auschwitz. Maus fuses a biography of his parents in the 1930s and 1940s, before his own birth in 1948, with his own autobiography, and his own and his father’s testimony about the Holocaust. It presents the Jews as mice, and the Germans as cats, and the Poles (his parents had lived in Poland) as pigs. Spiegelman wrote a first three-page version of the story in 1972,9 and then began to expand it in 1977 into what became the two-volume version, which took him until 1991, and won him a special, unprecedented, Pulitzer Prize for comics. In Maus he deploys the standard metaphor of racism, that other “races” are tantamount to other species, and explodes it in every frame. Because despite the animal heads, the characters are unmistakeably utterly human in their postures, gestures, expressions, behaviour, contexts and concerns (Fig. 1). We see the animal heads but we see straight through them; we cannot help feeling deeply and instantly with the characters as human beings just like us. And despite Hitler’s attempt to deprive Jews of individuality by treating them 9\n\nIn Funny Aminals [sic] 1, 1972; rpt. MetaMaus, pp. 105-107.\n\n30\n\nChapter Three\n\nas a mere category, and an unpleasant one at that, we cannot help seeing Spiegelman’s mice as fully individual and fully sympathetic, even with their failings and foibles.\n\nFigure 1: Maus I, 15.

Interested parties must apply directly to Random House, Inc. for permission.\n\nThat’s one strand of the success of Maus. Another is the unflinching honesty with which Spiegelman portrays the difficult character of his father and the difficulty of their relationship, their mutual irritation and disappointment (his mother committed suicide in 1968, before he began the project). Spiegelman’s questions to his father in the late 1970s about the 1930s and 1940s form a troubled “now” frame for the inset story of the past. This family drama helps make Maus funny as well as horrific, deeply familiar as well as eerily strange. The third strand is Spiegelman’s mastery of the resources of comics. No one else has probed what comics can do with his analytic intensity and creative inventiveness. By the late 1970s he had become the leader of the\n\nBiography / Autobiography / Testimony\n\n31\n\ncomics avant-garde (which had emerged only in the late 1960s), but the more experimental his comics, the smaller his audience became. He wanted to pay tribute to his parents, especially to his mother, who had testified in her own way, in post-war diaries about her war years that his father destroyed before Art saw them. He wanted to pay tribute to the whole generation ravaged by the Holocaust. And he wanted to use that story, with its intense intrinsic interest, for his own chosen medium: to show that comics could address serious purposes and earn a wide adult audience. Spiegelman deliberately composed a comic that places minimal demands on comprehension and seems to offer an immediate window onto the raw experience of the Holocaust. But for those who know how to look, his inventive rhetorical resourcefulness is always there, in every frame. He can make each frame seem effortless and immediate—but usually only after twenty tries at selecting and arranging each page, and a dozen reworkings of each frame. Maus incorporates biography (of Spiegelman’s parents) and autobiography (of his relationship with them, and of his composing Maus). The year after his initial three-page Maus, he had written another short autobiographical comic, Prisoner on the Hell Planet, a searing expressionistic treatment of his mother’s suicide and his reaction to it, which he incorporates into the two-volume Maus. After 9/11, he wrote another serially-published comic, In the Shadow of No Towers, about his own hysterical reaction to the attacks, compounded not only by his inclination to paranoia but also by the fact that his daughter attended a school very close to the base of the towers (after a frantic dash he found her unharmed) and by his detestation of the Bush government’s response to the attacks. More recently, he has published a brilliant autobiographical comic, also issued serially, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!, about his development as a comics artist. I admire Spiegelman’s work so much that apart from writing about him as a critic, which I have done several times and will do at more length, I also approached him three years ago to pay tribute in the way I, as an academic, could do best: as a biographer. I pointed out that in the continuation to my On the Origin of Stories I plan to take as my examples Hamlet, Twelfth Night, Pride and Prejudice, Ulysses—and Maus. His response was “Very flattering,... but it all makes me feel posthumous as hell. I’m in the process of working with the stuff of my life and don’t really want to pass it along for someone else to shape while I’m still using it.”10 Fair enough! I was happy to back off, to see what else he would do in this vein. And he does work with\n\n10 Art Spiegelman to his agent, Andrew Wylie, 4 December 2008, in response to my email.\n\n32\n\nChapter Three\n\nthe stuff of his life, he does shape it, he makes great art out of it. I certainly wouldn’t want to cramp that process. The most recent proof of his working with the stuff of his life is MetaMaus, published in October 2011. It deepens his autobiography, his biography of his parents, and his testimony, and it offers an occasion for thinking about the challenges of biography, autobiography, and testimony that’s as accessible, provocative and amusing as Hazel Rowley herself was in discussing these topics. This 300-page compilation of drawings, photographs, documents, comics old and new, mostly on autobiographical and therefore mouse-y themes, also has the most successful extended interviews I have ever seen. Spiegelman packs almost as much pleasure and provocation into a sentence as into a comic panel. Sample: German interviewer: “Don’t you think that a comic book about Auschwitz is in bad taste?” Spiegelman: “No, I thought Auschwitz was in bad taste” (2011: 155). There’s something odd about the very idea of a public intellectual. An intellectual is likely to be engaged professionally with a specialized and intricate problem far from common concerns. Intellectuals will therefore be likely, when they do engage with common concerns, to do so from unusual angles, as Nabokov and Popper did. There can be no prescription for the public intellectual. Spiegelman too deals in his own way with his own cluster of concerns, which sometimes can be everyone’s concerns: problems of race, and problems of responsibility, to his species, to his forebears and all those who died or lived through Auschwitz, to his parents, his family, his chosen art, and to history. One two-page colour spread shows “A Branch of the Spiegelman Family” at the start of World War II. The next shows the same branch at the end of the war, almost bare, with 53 immediate relatives killed by 1945 (2011: 228-31). I can’t remember whether I ever discussed Maus with Hazel, but I find it hard to imagine I didn’t, since in the year I first met her I had only recently discovered the story and had constructed a new graduate course in Narrative around it. Surely given Spiegelman’s natural edginess, and Hazel’s; his political bite, and hers; his interest in testimony, and hers; and his detestation of racism, and hers—I must have brought Maus up, but I can’t swear that I did: my testimony fails at this point. Let me imagine the rest of this essay as another conversation with Hazel, not on Maus but on MetaMaus, not so much on testimony as on biography. Spiegelman offers a great source for biography studies, partly because his work fascinates so many that so many have asked him so often to explain it, partly because of his intensely self-conscious analytic mind (and its close relationship with his creative mind), partly because of both the overlap with language in his medium (he spells comics co-mix, a mix of words and images)\n\nBiography / Autobiography / Testimony\n\n33\n\nand partly because of the distance between pure language and his medium. Writers can be reluctant to put into so many words the effects of the words in their creative works; the work of musicians or painters often seem too remote from words for them to be tempted to explain themselves verbally. Spiegelman is both close and distant. As I remarked earlier, biography by its very nature is committed to celebrating, if not its particular biographical subjects, then the distinctiveness of individuals. Spiegelman and his father had strained and unforgiving relationships with each other, as Maus shows very frankly. Spiegelman muses about “when people talk about a friend and say, ‘He’s not himself today.’ Well, we’re reduced down for convenience’s sake to a series of tropes and twitches, but we are none of us ourselves. And that’s what makes us a self, and that was the process of doing Maus—finding Vladek [his father] as more multifaceted than what would happen with my more meagre imagination if I was creating fiction. The advantage to using the stuff of real life is that one really is left with people who are far more interesting than what one could ever make up” (2011: 36). Spiegelman talks of the tug of war so well known to biographers: between facts and effects, between the facts of history, if you can find them, and the effects on your audience, between truth to the often vast and messy materials and interest and impact for the audience. He reflects: “All kinds of elisions and ellipses and compressions are part of any shaped work.... my goal was to not betray what I could find out or what I heard or what I knew but to give a shape to it.... But giving shape also involves, by definition, the risk of distorting the underlying reality.” He contrasts this with the counsel of despair, of just saying to readers: “Here are all the documents I used, you go through them. And here’s a twelve-foot shelf of works to give these documents context, and here’s like thousands of hours of tape recording [...] go make yourself a Maus!”(2011: 34). Talking of his decisions about what should go into each comics frame or page, he observes that “It was a matter of finding how much drawn information each box could contain and imply in a flowing and easy-to-unpack way so that things remain prioritized” (2011: 176)—a set of challenges very familiar to biographers, and of course any writers, but seen with new clarity when you watch the decisions behind one of Spiegelman’s panels. He also talks in ways other biographers recognize about the “tricky business” of “trying to make sequences that are moving but not manipulative” (2011: 224). One of the dilemmas he discusses is the incompleteness of the evidence: “If I couldn’t ultimately determine a character’s motives, it wouldn’t have been correct to imply those motives, but rather to just explain what happened and allow one to make one’s own determination” (2011: 33-4). Yet I would\n\n34\n\nChapter Three\n\nhave to add that sometimes as a biographer you think the reader will have not quite enough knowledge of your subject to make an inference that you recognize as only inferential, but that you nevertheless feel you have enough contextual information to allow, or even invite, the reader to draw. Another dilemma for Spiegelman: discrepancies between what his father remembers and what other sources record: Do I just correct errors based on other people’s authority? Or do I ignore other people’s authority and go strictly with Vladek’s memory [?] [...] I wrestled with it for a long time. In matters of firm historical record—that is, with lots of different independent witnesses—I tended to triangulate the event and allow his memory to be subsumed in the grander memory. But if there was any kind of personal reason for him to remember differently—because it was something he specifically says he saw, or because of the importance and weight it seemed to have in the conversation—then I went with his version and tried to make a visible correction if necessary. The closer it came to his personal story, the less I would interfere. But I thought there ought to be at least one place in the book where that process is made explicit. And the Auschwitz orchestra is about as well-documented as anything in Auschwitz might have been. Enough of those musicians survived, wrote memoirs. There are photographs of the orc"
