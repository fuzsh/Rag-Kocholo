        "text": "Tête-à-Tête\n\nThe Tumultuous Lives and Loves of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nHAZEL ROWLEY\n\nTo my father, Derrick Rowley\n\n(1922–2004)\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPREFACE\n\nLike Abélard and Héloïse, they are buried in a joint grave, their names linked for eternity. They’re one of the world’s legendary couples. We can’t think of one without thinking of the other: Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Sartre and Beauvoir quickly gained iconic stature as freethinking and engaged intellectuals. They wrote in a remarkable range of genres: plays, novels, philosophical essays, travel narratives, autobiography, memoir, biography, journalism. Sartre’s first novel, Nausea, was a landmark in French contemporary fiction; his ten plays were the talk of the Paris theater season; his philosophical essays, Being and Nothingness and The Critique of Dialectical Reason, made an impact, and his massive biographical essays Saint Genet and The Family Idiot: Gustave Flaubert, 1821–1857 were considered major works, but he is probably best remembered for his autobiographical narrative, Words, which won him the Nobel Prize. Beauvoir will always be associated with her groundbreaking feminist essay, The Second Sex, her novel The Mandarins, which so brilliantly evokes the postwar atmosphere in Europe, and her memoirs.\n\nShe would become one of the most famous memoirists of all time. Most of Beauvoir’s writing in some way reflects her own life. In addition to four volumes of memoirs, she wrote a book about her travels in the United States (America Day by Day), a book about her trip to China (The Long March), a narrative about her mother’s dying (A Very Easy Death), another about Sartre’s final years (Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre), and two autobiographical novels, She Came to Stay and The Mandarins. In a sense, Beauvoir was not only Sartre’s companion; she was also his biographer, his Boswell. In writing about her life, she also wrote about his. Sartre encouraged her. As existentialists, they believed that individuals are no more or less than the sum total of their actions, and offered themselves up willingly to the judgment of posterity.\n\nThey shared a thirst for the absolute. Naturally one doesn’t succeed in everything, Sartre said, but one must want everything. Beauvoir’s favorite of the 1968 student slogans was Live with no time out. Both were lifelong rebels. As students, they could not have performed more brilliantly in the French educational system, and yet they turned their backs on academic rigidity and bourgeois niceties, and scorned anything that had the slightest whiff of staid conventionality.\n\nWe think of Sartre and Beauvoir and we think of freedom. Man is constrained to be free, Sartre said. His philosophy of freedom was not ivory-tower theorizing. It was meant to be applied to life. As existentialists, he and Beauvoir refused any notion of human nature. As philosophers, they challenged all social conventions. Nobody was going to tell them how to live their lives, not even their love life. They were conscious of inventing their relationship as they went along.\n\nThey rejected marriage. They never lived together. They openly had other lovers. They were often friends with each other’s lovers; on occasion they shared them. Their original agreement (not conveyed to the third parties involved) was that whereas their other loves would be secondary, theirs would be absolute.\n\nSartre and Beauvoir spent their lives grappling with questions of ethics and morality. How were they to make the best use of their liberty? At first they were preoccupied with individual freedom. Later they were highly critical of this rather prolonged early period, which they looked back upon as their irresponsible youth. The Second World War made them conscious of history. In 1945, they established Les Temps modernes, a journal that would have a major impact on intellectual life in France, Europe, and even the third world. From that time on, they became public intellectuals who wrote committed literature and embraced political engagement.\n\nThey never forgot that they had choices to make, and that freedom comes with responsibility. They discussed these questions constantly. Which of the possible actions before them would be most responsible? What would be the consequences of acting in this way rather than that way? Sartre, in particular, a passionate advocate of world peace and socialism, grappled with the big question of the day: communism. In the 1950s and 1960s, both took courageous stands against the Algerian and Vietnam wars. Sartre’s writings on colonialism and racism made him a spokesman for the anticolonial struggle. With The Second Sex, Beauvoir wrote what is generally regarded as the founding text of the modern women’s movement.\n\nNever for a second did Sartre and Beauvoir, in their relationship with each other, stop living as writers. It was a total commitment, every moment of the day. They promised to tell each other everything, down to the smallest detail. Turning life into narrative was perhaps their most voluptuous pleasure. As Roquentin reflects in Sartre’s novel Nausea: For the most banal event to become an adventure, you must…begin to recount it. It was impossible to say which was the more satisfying for Sartre and Beauvoir: the voyeuristic thrill of hearing about each other’s life or the cozy enjoyment of narrating their own.\n\nBoth were heavily imbued with what Sartre called the biographical illusion—the idea that a lived life can resemble a recounted life. Already in their adolescence they dreamed of their future lives as if through the eyes of posterity. I…was extremely conscious of being the young Sartre, in the same way that people speak of the young Berlioz or the young Goethe, Sartre writes. Beauvoir imagined people poring over the narrative of her life, as she did with the lives of Emily Brontë, George Eliot, and Katherine Mansfield. I wanted people to read my biography and find it touching and strange.\n\nAlong with their mythmaking impulse went a passionate belief in truth-telling. To them, the notion of privacy was a relic of bourgeois hypocrisy. Why keep secrets? As they saw it, their task as intellectuals was to probe beneath the surfaces, plumb the depths of experience, debunk myths, and communicate unvarnished truths to their readers.\n\nThey often said they would like the public to know the truth about their personal lives. It wouldn’t occur to me to get rid of letters and documents concerning my private life, Sartre said. So much the better if this means I will be…transparent to posterity…. I think that transparency should always be substituted for secrecy. Both remarked in interviews that they would have liked to have been more open about their own sexuality, and the only thing that held them back was that other people were involved.\n\nWhen Beauvoir was seventy, the German feminist Alice Schwarzer asked her if there was anything she had not written in her memoirs that she would say now if she could write them again. Yes, Beauvoir replied. I would have liked to have given a frank and balanced account of my own sexuality. A truly sincere one, from a feminist point of view. I would like to tell women about my life in terms of my own sexuality because it is not just a personal matter but a political one too. I did not write about it at the time because I did not appreciate the importance of this question, nor the need for personal honesty. And I am very unlikely to write about it now because this kind of confession would not just affect me, it would also affect certain people who are very close to me.\n\nThere were omissions in Beauvoir’s memoirs, but there was also a lot that she said—enough to excite generations of readers. From the time they started teaching, in the early 1930s, Sartre and Beauvoir were extremely conscious of being a model to young people. They liked teaching, and enjoyed influencing youthful minds. Their enduring friendships were always with much younger people. Both readily inspired acolytes, as Sartre called them. This phenomenon hugely gained in momentum when Beauvoir’s memoirs began to appear in 1958. In the sixties and seventies, those years of heady social experimentation, innumerable young people took Sartre and Beauvoir’s open relationship as their model.\n\nI did too. When I read Beauvoir’s memoirs in the late sixties, I was exhilarated—intoxicated, one might say. She made the impossible seem possible. Didn’t we all want an intellectual partner with whom we could share our work, ideas, and slightest thoughts? Didn’t everyone want to write in Paris cafés amid the clatter of coffee cups and the hubbub of voices, and spend their summers in Rome in complicated but apparently harmonious foursomes? Who wanted monogamy when one could have freedom and stability, love affairs and commitment?\n\nEveryone knew—Sartre said so in interviews, and Beauvoir said so in her memoirs—that their relationship with each other was superior to all the other relationships in their lives. Young women dreamed of having Beauvoir’s audacity, courage, and liberty. When Geneviève Idt interviewed Sartre in 1974, she asked him if he was conscious of being macho in his relationships with women. There was a long pause, and his answer was considered: I do not believe I was with the Beaver. (For him, Beauvoir was always the Beaver.)\n\nIn November 1976, I interviewed Simone de Beauvoir in her apartment in the Rue Schoelcher, opposite the Montparnasse cemetery. I was a graduate student, writing a doctorate on Simone de Beauvoir and Existentialist Autobiography, and deeply involved in the women’s movement. Beauvoir had changed my life, and I worshipped her. I asked burning questions about her relationship with Sartre—about truth-telling, jealousy, third parties, and double standards for men and women. Beauvoir insisted there had been no jealousy between them, and as for double standards, she thought relationships between the sexes easier for women than for men because, given women’s secondary status, men tended to feel guilty when they left them. She answered my questions as if by rote, without the slightest reflection or hesitation. By the time she ushered me out the door, I could see, and it saddened me, that she herself could not disentangle the reality of her life from the myth.\n\nAlready then existentialism had an old-fashioned ring to it. We had entered the postmodern era. It was modish to scorn the notion of individual responsibility. Now that the whole sordid truth about Stalin’s crimes had emerged, the French New Philosophers, as they were called, viewed Sartre’s sympathy for communism during the cold war as the foolishness of a deluded Stalinist. And the so-called radical feminists were impatient with what they saw as Beauvoir’s male values, and in particular her indulgence of that execrable male chauvinist Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nSartre died in 1980; Beauvoir in 1986. They did not destroy their letters or journals, and they made it clear that they intended them to be published at some point after their deaths. The bulk of their correspondence to each other was published a few years later. Readers were left reeling with shock. It turned out that these two advocates of truth-telling constantly told lies to an array of emotionally unstable young girls. (Sartre called them little fibs, half-truths, and total lies.) And here was Beauvoir, who throughout her life had publicly denied ever having had an affair with a woman, telling Sartre about her pleasurable nights making love with young women! We wondered, how could Sartre write so coldly and clinically about taking his latest girlfriend’s virginity? And why were they both so disparaging about the young women they went to bed with? At the same time, they were more vulnerable than we had imagined. And their passion for sharing the tiniest details of their daily lives—the smell of the rain, the color of headlamps in the dark, a humorous conversation they overheard in a train—was frankly endearing.\n\nIn recent years, Sartre and Beauvoir have continued to divulge their tangled secrets from beyond their graves. Beauvoir’s love letters to Nelson Algren, published in 1997, astonished readers. Her correspondence with Jacques-Laurent Bost, published in 2004, surprised people all over again. Was this feverish, ardent, sensuous woman the Simone de Beauvoir they thought they knew? If so, why on earth did she stick with Sartre? How could she live with that bespectacled fellow, with his metallic procurer’s voice, his creased blue suit, his obsession with crabs, homosexuals, tree roots, the slime of being, and the whole Heideggerian marmalade, one critic puzzled, when she had such vitality, fire, wit, and freshness? What a mystery.¹\n\nToday the wheel has come full circle. After several decades in which Sartre and Beauvoir aroused little interest, particularly in France, there is a new recognition that they had the courage and daring to flout convention, they tried to live according to an ethic of freedom and responsibility, and they opened many doors. Maybe they strained at times against their own philosophy, but whatever their failures, few people have lived life more intensely. Who would have imagined that Bernard-Henri Lévy, France’s most famous New Philosopher, would write a book, tantamount to a love letter, called Sartre: The Philosopher of the Twentieth Century, and that in it, he would defend Sartre’s relationship with Beauvoir as one of the great love stories of all time?\n\nI, too, felt a need to return to this past terrain. Like many others, I was once personally invested in the success or failure of the Sartre-Beauvoir relationship. Michel Contat, the well-known Sartre scholar, who writes that his personal life was much influenced by his existentialist mentors, describes the stakes Sartre-Beauvoir enthusiasts once faced: If Beauvoir and Sartre succeeded, we were not wrong, and if we failed we could only blame our own deficiencies. But if they failed and hid their failure, they were fakers and imposters.²\n\nWith the distance of time, I am no longer concerned with Sartre and Beauvoir’s success or failure. I am interested in the truth, and truth does not fit into categories. What we know about this relationship comes mostly from Beauvoir. I have always wondered: What did Sartre feel about it? How about their lovers and friends?\n\nThis is not a biography of Sartre and Beauvoir. I leave it to others to pay justice to their writing, politics, and the intricate details of their enormously rich lives. This is the story of a relationship. I wanted to portray these two people close up, in their most intimate moments. Whether or not we think it is one of the great love stories of all time, it is certainly a great story. Exactly what Sartre and Beauvoir always wanted their lives to be.\n\nONE\n\nNINETEEN TWENTY-NINE\n\nJean-Paul Sartre had been interested in her for months. At twenty-one, she was the youngest of the Sorbonne students preparing that year for the agrégation in philosophy, the competitive national teacher’s examination. She had given a talk in class on Leibniz, and Sartre was struck by her beauty and brilliance, her husky voice, and her rapid-fire speech.\n\nHis friend René Maheu had been courting her since the spring. Maheu was married, but he and Simone de Beauvoir seemed very taken with each other. They both went to the Bibliothèque Nationale, the National Library, to prepare for their exams, sat beside each other to work, and often had lunch together. Sartre had been hoping for an introduction, but Maheu guarded her fiercely. One afternoon, the two men had been strolling together in the Luxembourg Gardens when they saw Mademoiselle de Beauvoir across the pond. She was by herself, and it was obvious she had seen them, but Maheu chose to ignore her rather than present her to Sartre.\n\nEarly in May, she disappeared. A week or so later, Sartre and Maheu were sitting on a windowsill outside the lecture theater in one of the long, labyrinthine corridors of the Sorbonne when she appeared, wearing a black dress and little black hat swathed in crepe. Maheu went up to her, grasped her hand warmly, and asked why she was in mourning, but he did not introduce her to his friend.\n\nThen Sartre took the initiative. During dull lectures, he and his friends entertained themselves by drawing humorous sketches in which they none too delicately expressed what they thought of certain philosophers and their philosophies. He picked out a particularly irreverent one, wrote on it, To Mademoiselle Simone de Beauvoir, in memory of an explication of Leibniz, and asked Maheu to give it to her, which he did.\n\nSartre then made a suggestion to his two friends René Maheu and Paul Nizan. They were planning to prepare for the oral exams together. Simone de Beauvoir knew her Leibniz well and was clearly very bright; suppose they asked her to join them?\n\nBy mid-June, the written exams were over and there was only a month before the orals. Maheu was off to join his wife in Normandy for ten days. Sartre told him he would like to make the acquaintance of Mademoiselle de Beauvoir before they started working together as a group. He suggested a tearoom on the Rue de Médicis, across from the Luxembourg Gardens, five minutes from the Sorbonne. Maheu passed on the message but told Beauvoir he was afraid Sartre would take advantage of his absence to make off with her himself. I don’t want anyone to get in the way of my most precious feelings, Maheu said. He had talked about Sartre in glowing terms, but as far as women were concerned, he did not trust him an inch.\n\nOn the designated afternoon, Sartre waited in the tearoom, reading and smoking his pipe. He was taken aback when a fair-haired young woman walked up to him, introduced herself as Hélène de Beauvoir, and explained that her sister was unable to come. How did you know I was Sartre? he asked. Poupette, as everyone called her, looked sheepish. Because…you are wearing glasses. Sartre pointed out that the man sitting in the other corner was also wearing glasses.\n\nSartre thought he knew why Simone de Beauvoir had not turned up, and he could guess how she had described him to her younger sister. He was right. Beauvoir had told Poupette that she would have no trouble recognizing Sartre. He was extremely short, he wore glasses, and he was very ugly.¹\n\nSartre was gallant, and took Poupette to see the new American film A Girl in Every Port. The conversation flagged. When she got home, Poupette told her sister that Jean-Paul Sartre was nothing like the lively dynamo Maheu had cracked him up to be.\n\nThis was not an auspicious beginning. Sartre could not stand being rejected by women. Throughout his life, he would never forgive his mother for betraying him, as he saw it, by marrying again, when he was eleven. Then there was that traumatic episode in La Rochelle, when he was twelve.\n\nHis father, Jean-Baptiste Sartre, had died when Jean-Paul was fifteen months old. Twenty-four-year-old Anne-Marie bundled up her little Poulou and went to live with her parents in Paris.² She belonged to the dynasty of Schweitzers, a Protestant family from Alsace (the famous Albert Schweitzer was her cousin), and like all the Schweitzers, Anne-Marie was tall and slim. Physically, Poulou would take after his diminutive father. And when he was two, he went almost blind in his right eye.\n\nPoulou was the little prince in his grandparents’ house, doted on and idolized by his mother, grandmother, and grandfather. In that patriarchal household—dominated by the lanky, bearded, and imperious Charles Schweitzer—Anne-Marie felt to Poulou like an older sister. She was financially dependent on her parents, and they condescended to her. There were three bedrooms in the house: the grandfather’s, the grandmother’s, and the one they called the children’s, which Anne-Marie shared with her son.\n\nAnne-Marie gave Poulou her undivided attention. They told each other their troubles. She read to him. She played the piano for him. On rainy Sundays they would earnestly debate whether to go to the circus, a museum, or a movie. Charles Schweitzer would appear at the door of his book-lined study. Where are you children off to? he would ask. It was usually the movies.\n\nAll I wanted to see was Anne-Marie, the young girl of my mornings, Sartre would write in his autobiography, Words. All I wanted to hear was her voice.\n\nShe used to call me her attendant knight and her little man; I told her everything. More than everything…. I described what I saw…I gave myself feelings for the pleasure of sharing them with her…. We had our myths, our habits of speech, and our ritual jokes…. I used to trot along looking tough, my hand in my mother’s, confident that I could protect her.\n\nWhen he grew up, Sartre intended to marry Anne-Marie. Then, in 1916, when he was eleven, she married again. For Sartre, this was a catastrophe. It broke his heart. The stranger who stole his mother was Joseph Mancy, a naval engineer. Until the day he died, Sartre would always hate his Uncle Jo.\n\nThe following year, when Sartre was twelve, the awkward trio moved to La Rochelle, a small port town on the Atlantic coast. Sartre detested the place. His new classmates were the sons and daughters of local fishermen and oyster farmers. They did not like him—a prissy Parisian with a walleye and a funny way of speaking—and they did not hesitate to beat him up. It did not take Sartre long to become a tough little hoodlum himself.\n\nIn a bid for popularity, he stole money from his mother’s handbag to treat the other kids to cakes from the local pastry shop. The provincial boys all seemed to have girlfriends, and Sartre told tall stories about his girl, back in Paris, with whom he had gone to a hotel and made love. They did not believe him. At school in La Rochelle, he picked out a pretty blond girl, the daughter of a ship chandler, and boasted about her to his classmates. They warned her of Sartre’s interest.\n\nSartre never forgot that afternoon. He found the girl, Lisette, standing with a group of her friends. He was on his bicycle. Not sure what to say, he rode in circles around the group. Finally, she said: Have you finished, you cross-eyed old fool, with your glasses and big hat?³ Her friends jeered.\n\nThe realization that he was ugly hit Sartre like a stone from a catapult. His adolescence was tormented by it. At the end of his teens, he made a decision. He told a girlfriend, Simone Jollivet, Until last year I was very melancholy because I was ugly and that made me suffer. I have absolutely rid myself of that, because it’s a weakness. Whoever knows his own strength must be joyful. He added, I call that state moral health, because it is exactly like when one is in excellent physical health, one feels strong enough to bend lampposts with a single hand.⁴\n\nSartre, the future existentialist, had made a fundamental existential choice. If he could not seduce women by means of his physical assets, he would seduce them with words—les mots.\n\nAt sixteen, Sartre was sent back to Paris to his old school, the prestigious Lycée Henri IV, this time as a boarder. Among his classmates was Paul Nizan, equally talented and ambitious, and equally set on becoming a writer. For the next few years, Sartre and Nizan became inseparable friends.\n\nAs schoolboys, the young Sartre and Nizan took themselves for supermen. Convinced they were far superior to the common herd, they would strut around Paris for hours at a time, imitating their literary heroes, acting out roles, inventing a private language. Sartre gorged himself on adventure stories; Nizan introduced him to contemporary literature. They read each other’s writing, and discussed narrative technique.\n\nFrom Henri IV, Sartre and Nizan went to the equally prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand, for two years of hard cramming in preparation for the competitive entrance examination to the most elite all-male institution in the nation. Two years later, they moved together to the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d’Ulm, near the Pantheon, where they shared a study.\n\nThey were so often together that people mixed them up, though their only common physical attribute was a squint. Nizan’s eyes rotated inward; Sartre’s roamed outward. Whereas Sartre’s wandering eyes were intensely disconcerting, Nizan’s cross-eyed look was quite appealing. Sartre was stocky, and at 158 centimeters (five foot one), he was cruelly short. His skin was pale and dull, with pockmarks and blackheads, and he looked as if he needed a bath and a good sleep. Nizan, dark and handsome, dressed with a dandy’s elegance and sometimes appeared at lectures in plus fours, dangling a monocle or twirling a malacca cane. Sartre greatly admired his friend’s costumes, but did not try to compete.\n\nBy their early twenties, their temperaments were pulling the two friends apart. Sartre was in his element during the four years he spent at the Ecole Normale. He reveled in his newfound independence and enjoyed the security of an easygoing, elitist male community, in which he shone. He threw water bombs on friends in evening attire; he wrote a highly obscene sketch for the school’s annual review, in which he acted the part of the school principal. The other normaliens would hear him singing in his fine tenor voice as he dashed between lectures, and playing the piano evenings in the common room. He once stepped into the middle of a fight because he saw an acquaintance, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, being picked on. And yet he was one of the leaders when it came to hazing, the semi-sadistic initiation rituals to which new recruits were subjected.⁵\n\nNizan, on the other hand, was profoundly unhappy in that environment. In his autobiographical narrative Aden Arabie (published in 1931, when he was twenty-six), Nizan, by then a Marxist, was scathing about the Ecole Normale, that laughable and odious institution with the esprit de corps of seminaries and regiments, where adolescents, tired after years of cramming for competitions, were taught vapid sophisms by stuffy professors who lived in the affluent western districts of Paris.⁶\n\nNizan had always been prone to melancholy, and at the Ecole Normale his moods grew darker. In one of the most tender and penetrating portraits Sartre would ever write, his foreword to the 1960 reprinting of Aden Arabie (Nizan was killed in battle in 1940), he was harshly critical of his own inability to understand the depths of Nizan’s anguish. As a student, he preferred to see Nizan’s rage and despair as emotional extravagance—an affectation, such as his wearing a monocle.\n\nMy anger was only a bar of soap, his was real…. His words of hate were pure gold, mine were counterfeit…. We had superficial melancholies in common…. For the rest, I tried to impose my optimism upon him. I repeated to him that we were free. He didn’t answer, but the slight smile at the corner of his mouth said a great deal about this idea.\n\nIn their shared study, whole days would pass when Nizan did not speak to his companion. Sartre was hurt. And when Nizan took a year’s leave from the overheated atmosphere of the Normale and caught a boat to Aden, in Yemen, Sartre felt as if he’d been jilted.\n\nAlmost a year later, Sartre was alone in his study one evening, moping over a girlfriend, when Nizan burst in without knocking. Sartre was overjoyed. The two went out drinking. It was like old times. Over brimming beers, they again put the world on trial. Sartre thought they had taken up their friendship where they left off. But Nizan did not return to board at the Ecole Normale. Instead, he moved in with his fiancée’s family, in Montparnasse. A few months later, he got married. Sartre was appalled. I had made of bachelorhood a moral precept, a rule of life—thus it couldn’t be otherwise for Nizan.⁷\n\nSartre was known for his brilliance, and was expected to come first in the agrégation. In June 1928, to everyone’s astonishment, he failed the written exams. That was why he was sitting them again a year later, in the summer of 1929, at the same time as Paul Nizan, who had lost a year by going to Aden, and as Simone de Beauvoir, who had gained a year by taking her teacher’s diploma at the same time, giving herself a double load.\n\nBeauvoir had heard considerable gossip about Sartre and Nizan, those godless young men who mocked bourgeois hypocrisies and Catholic sanctities and only bothered to drop in on certain lectures. Around Sartre, in particular, there swirled rumors of drunken binges and visits to brothels. The third member of their trio, René Maheu, did not share their legendary reputation. Although he, too, held himself aloof from most of his fellow students, Maheu was slightly less intimidating.\n\nIn January 1929, Maheu had given a talk in class that provoked an animated discussion. Beauvoir was charmed by Maheu’s slightly mocking voice, his broad, liquid smile, and the ironical twist he gave to his mouth.⁸ Despite his well-cut suits, his ruddy complexion and blond hair lent him the air of a country boy. She wished she could get to know him.\n\nOne morning in spring, Beauvoir looked up from her books at the Bibliothèque Nationale and saw Maheu walk in. She watched him take off his blue overcoat and scarf and sit down to work. At lunchtime she saw him get up, leaving his books behind. Normally, she ate a sandwich in the gardens of the Palais Royal. That day, she went to the library café. Maheu flashed her a smile and cleared a place for her at his table as if they had arranged to meet. They talked about Hume and Kant.\n\nAfter that, whenever he came to the library, Maheu would greet her warmly. Before the Easter break, he came and sat next to her in one of Leon Brunschvicg’s lectures. (Sartre and Nizan boycotted these.) After Easter, when lectures resumed, he sat next to her again. He told her he was an individualist. So was she, she said. He stared at her. What? You! He had been convinced that she was a good Catholic, devoted to good works. Not at all, she assured him.⁹\n\nMeeting with René Maheu, or with myself? Beauvoir wrote in her journal that evening. \"Who else has ever made such a strong impression on me? Why am I overwhelmed by this meeting, as if something had really happened to me at last?\"¹⁰\n\nShe started to save the seat next to hers in the library. Maheu turned up most days. For weeks, he called her Mademoiselle, in that slightly ironic voice of his. One day, he reached across, took her notebook, and wrote on the cover in large capital letters: BEAUVOIR = BEAVER. Her name resembled the English word, and she also worked like a beaver. From that day on, he called her Beaver, le Castor.\n\nHe told her about the little comrades, as they called themselves. He had met them at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, when he first came to Paris from the provinces, at the age of eighteen. They were now twenty-four. Maheu was the Lama, Nizan the Grand Duke, Sartre the Little Man.¹¹ Maheu admired his two friends with a passion, especially Sartre, whom he thought a genius. But Sartre was very different from him, he explained. Sartre belonged to the Parisian bourgeoisie; Maheu felt like an upstart in that milieu. Maheu liked to enjoy life; Sartre never for a second stopped analyzing. Maheu liked the countryside and fresh air; Sartre didn’t give a damn about such things.\n\nThere was something princely about Maheu. He reminded Beauvoir of Jacques, the cousin she had been in love with throughout her adolescence. They were both graceful, boyish characters, who often smiled in place of speaking. Both valued beauty—in art, nature, and people. To her, they were artists, poets.\n\nBeauvoir’s friendships had always been exceptionally formal. Even with her bosom friend, Zaza, whom she had known since the age of ten, she used the formal vous rather than the informal tu. (Zaza used tu with all her other friends.) And when they met or said good-bye, they shook hands. There was only one person who ever hugged or kissed Simone, and that was her exuberant Polish friend Stépha, who was extroverted and unrestrained to a point that left Simone a little dizzy.\n\nMaheu made Beauvoir conscious of her body in a way she had never been before. He would put his hand on her arm and wag his finger in her face mockingly. He commented on her appearance, her clothes, her husky voice. He found it very appealing, he assured her. Beauvoir had never thought about her voice before.\n\nShe was equally conscious of Maheu as a physical presence. I would watch him come striding through the gardens with his rather awkward grace; I would look at his ears, transparent in the sun as pink sugar-candy, and I knew that I had beside me not an angel, but a real man, she would write in her memoirs. His laugh was irresistible. When he gave vent to his laughter, it was as if he had just unexpectedly dropped in on a strange planet and was making a rapturous discovery of its prodigious comicality.¹²\n\nIn the three weeks running up to the written examinations, they saw each other almost every day. On the rare occasions when Maheu did not work in the library, he would turn up at the end of the afternoon and invite her for tea or coffee.\n\nBeauvoir was enchanted by their conversations. Maheu knew a lot about history and myth—more, she thought privately, than about philosophy—and had a wonderfully entertaining way of bringing the past to life. My greatest happiness is Maheu, she wrote in her journal.¹³\n\nHe was also her greatest source of anguish. When they said goodbye at the end of the day, she felt sad. He was going home to his wife. He rarely talked about his personal life, but he had told her that Inès was five years older than he, and represented all the mysteries and paradoxes of femininity. He loved her. She was beautiful. She came from the Catholic nobility.\n\nThere were times when Beauvoir found Maheu disappointingly conventional, particularly when it came to women. He admitted that bright women brought out a certain resistance in him. When Beauvoir told him about her tormented relationship with her cousin Jacques, Maheu said he thought she should marry Jacques. Society did not respect unmarried women. Beauvoir lent Maheu a recent English novel she had enjoyed, The Green Hat, by Michael Arlen. She admired its independent heroine, Iris Storm. Maheu did not. I have no liking for women of easy virtue, he told her. Much as I like a woman to please me, I find it impossible to respect any woman I’ve had. Beauvoir was indignant. \"One does not have an Iris Storm!\"¹⁴\n\nThe written exams were held in the middle of June. Beauvoir and Maheu walked into the library of the Sorbonne together. Good luck, Beaver, he said to her gently. They found their seats. Beauvoir placed a thermos of coffee and a box of biscuits by the side of her desk. The topic was announced: Liberty and Contingency. She gazed a while at the ceiling, and soon her pen was flying across the page. When they came out, she looked for Maheu, but he had disappeared.\n\nThe exams continued for several days. After the last one, Maheu called around at the Beauvoir family apartment, on the Rue de Rennes, and invited Simone for lunch. He was about to join his wife in Normandy, he told her, but when he got back, the little comrades were going to prepare for the orals together. Would she like to join them?\n\nWhen he failed his agrégation the previous year, Sartre had been obliged to move out of his room at the Ecole Normale. He was now living in one of the student residences at the Cité Universitaire, on the southern edge of the city. On Monday July 8, 1929, Maheu turned up in the morning, as arranged, with Mademoiselle de Beauvoir. Sartre opened the door and greeted her politely, his pipe in his mouth. Paul Nizan looked at her dubiously through his tortoiseshell glasses.\n\nBeauvoir was taken aback by the filth of Sartre’s tiny student room. There were cigarette butts on the floor, and the air was thick with stale body odor and tobacco fumes. Books and papers were piled everywhere, and satirical sketches were stuck on the walls. They brought in a second chair for Beauvoir. The others took turns on Sartre’s chair, desk, and narrow bed. Beauvoir, who had prepared for this all weekend, gave a close reading of Leibniz’s Discourse on Metaphysics, feeling as nervous as if she were taking the actual oral exam.\n\nAt the end of the day, the men decided that Beauvoir needed a nickname. They teased her with various possibilities. Sartre wanted to call her Valkyrie. To him, she was like a Viking virgin warrior goddess. No, said Maheu. She was Beaver, le Castor. They clenched their fists about her head. It was official.\n\nThey devoted two days to Leibniz, and decided that was enough; then Sartre set about explaining Rousseau’s Social Contract. Beauvoir proved by far the best at finding the flaws in Sartre’s arguments. Nizan frowned and chewed his nails. Maheu looked at Beauvoir with frank admiration. Sartre accused her of making him trot out everything he knew. But Sartre clearly loved imparting his knowledge, and did so with passion. He knew how to untangle complicated ideas and make them comprehensible and exciting. And while he did so, he had the other three in fits of delighted laughter. More and more, his mind seems to me quite extraordinarily powerful, Beauvoir wrote in her journal. I admire him and also feel huge gratitude for the way he gives himself so generously.\n\nThe men did not hold themselves back in Beauvoir’s presence, and Beauvoir was often shocked by the things they said. But she had been rebelling for years against the stiflingly conventional world in which she had been brought up. Their defiance was a tonic.\n\nTheir language was aggressive, their thought categorical, their judgments merciless. They made fun of bourgeois law and order; they had refused to sit the examination in religious knowledge…. On every possible occasion—in their speech, their attitudes, their gestures, their jokes—they set out to prove that men were not rarefied spirits but bodies of flesh and bone, racked by physical needs and crudely engaged in a brutal adventure that was life…. I soon understood that if the world these new friends opened up to me seemed crude, it was because they didn’t try to disguise its realities; in the end, all they asked of me was that I should dare to do what I had always longed to do: look reality in the face.¹⁵\n\nBeauvoir had never imagined that fierce intelligence could go along with such a sense of fun. When they stopped work, the men started singing, joking, and acting out different characters. Sartre put a jazz record on his gramophone, then they strolled over to the fun fair at the Porte d’Orléans and tried out the shooting gallery. Whenever Sartre scored a prize—an ugly bit of crockery or a dime novel—he gallantly handed it to Beauvoir.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon the group gave themselves what they called a very big recreation, at the Café Dupont, in the sleazy Pigalle district of Montmartre. The men drank beer; Beauvoir drank lemonade. She got into a fierce discussion with Sartre, and realized she was arguing with him for the sheer fun of it.\n\nSartre and Nizan started to plan the group’s evening. Maheu cut the discussion short. He was taking the Beaver to the cinema, he said. Fine, fine, said Nizan. So be it, said Sartre.\n\nOn the bus ride back home that evening, Maheu told Beauvoir: I’m happy you get on with the little comrades, but…\n\nBut you’re the Lama, I know.\n\nYou won’t ever be one of the little comrades.\n\nOf course. I’m your Beaver.¹⁶\n\nOn Thursday morning, Nizan turned up with his wife, Henriette. To Beauvoir’s dismay, this meant they did not work. Instead, they squeezed themselves into Nizan’s car and went for a drive around Paris, stopping in a bar for a coffee and a game of Japanese billiards. The women did not warm to each other. Henriette Nizan thought that Beauvoir dressed atrociously, and seemed pathetically eager to copy the men—smoking, drinking, even adopting their private language.¹⁷ For her part, Beauvoir had little interest in Henriette’s worries about her new baby. She scrawled in her journal: I spoke to her about her daughter with an air of sympathy, which apparently made her like me, and which amused Sartre and Maheu, who saw it as proof that I am feminine after all.\n\nAt lunch Beauvoir joined the men in a glass of beer. The Nizans dropped them back at Sartre’s student residence and went home to Montparnasse. Beauvoir, Sartre, and Maheu settled down to work. It was hot. Sartre drew the curtains to keep out the sun. Maheu sprawled on the bed, handsome in his shirtsleeves. Sartre puffed at his pipe. For Beauvoir, in that semi-obscure retreat from the world, time seemed to melt away. She was at her brilliant best that afternoon, and she knew it. I felt unleashed, she wrote in her journal.\n\nAt 8 P.M., she hurried off to the Bois de Boulogne where she was meeting other friends—a more conservative group of philosophers who were still practicing Catholics. Among those rowing on the lake that evening was Maurice Merleau-Ponty. It was Beauvoir who had introduced Maurice to Zaza, and that magical summer, while so much was going on in Beauvoir’s own life, Maurice and Zaza were falling in love. But Zaza had been forbidden to join them that evening. Her family did not approve.\n\nZaza Lacoin, the third of ten children, came from a well-to-do, devoutly Catholic family. She and Simone had been best friends since the age of ten, when they rivaled each other as star pupils at the Cours Adeline Désir, a private Catholic girls’ school in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, which placed far less emphasis on education than on prayer, the catechism, piety, and deportment. The girls were taught the piano, knitting, crochet, and etiquette at tea parties.\n\nMonsieur de Beauvoir, an atheist, had wanted to move his two daughters to a secular school, which would have given them a better education without his having to pay fees, but Simone would not contemplate leaving her friend behind. She idolized Zaza. Whereas she herself was timid, childish, and in every way the model obedient pupil, the dark-haired Zaza was precocious and rebellious. Beauvoir would never forget the school musical recital at which Zaza, a talented pianist, played a piece her mother had insisted would be too difficult for her. When she finished a perfect performance, the triumphant Zaza, in front of all the teachers and parents, stuck her tongue out at her mother. Madame Lacoin merely smiled.\n\nBut when her daughters reached a marriageable age, Madame Lacoin turned into a tyrant. She had significant social aspirations for her daughters; nothing was more important than a good marriage. Before Zaza was allowed so much as to play a game of tennis with a group of young people, her mother needed to know that they came from good Catholic families.\n\nThe Beauvoir girls could not aspire to a bourgeois marriage, because they did not have a dowry. Their marriage prospects had plummeted in 1918, when the Bolsheviks overthrew the Czar in a dramatic revolution that rendered Georges de Beauvoir’s Russian railway and mining stocks worthless. Most of his inheritance had been invested in these, and after the war he no longer had the capital to open his law practice again. For the rest of his life he drifted from one salesman position to another. The family struggled to keep up appearances, but Georges would tell his daughters bitterly, You girls will never marry. You’ll have to work for a living.\n\nLooking back later in life, Beauvoir thought it the best thing that could have happened to her. When she left school, she decided to take the agrégation, which would mean a secure job as a secondary-school teacher in a state school. She wanted to study philosophy. The nuns at the Cours Désir were appalled. To them a state school was nothing better than a licensed brothel, Beauvoir writes. They told my mother that the study of philosophy mortally corrupts the soul.¹⁸ She agreed to study classics and mathematics instead, at an all-female Catholic institution on the outskirts of Paris. Not for another year did her parents consent to let her study philosophy at the Sorbonne.\n\nZaza’s parents would not let Zaza near the Sorbonne. They belonged to the traditional French Catholic bourgeoisie, who distrusted intellectuals, especially philosophers."
