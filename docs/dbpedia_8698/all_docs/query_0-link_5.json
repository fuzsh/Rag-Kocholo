        "text": "Passionate, freethinking existentialist philosopher-writers Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre are one of the world's legendary couples. Their committed but notoriously open union generated no end of controversy in their day. Biographer Hazel Rowley offers the first dual portrait of these two colossal figures and their intense, often embattled relationship. Through original interviews and access to new primary sources, Rowley portrays Sartre and Beauvoir up close.\n\nTête-à-Tête magnificently details the passion, daring, humor, and contradictions of a remarkably unorthodox relationship.\n\nThis book title, Tete-a-Tete (The Tumultuous Lives and Loves of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre), ISBN: 9780060520601, by Hazel Rowley, published by HarperCollins (October 17, 2006) is available in paperback. Our minimum order quantity is 25 copies. All standard bulk book orders ship FREE in the continental USA and delivered in 4-10 business days.\n\nUnlike Amazon and other retailers who may also offer Tete-a-Tete (The Tumultuous Lives and Loves of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre) books on their website, we specialize in large quantities and provide personal service, from trusted, experienced, friendly people in Portland, Oregon.
