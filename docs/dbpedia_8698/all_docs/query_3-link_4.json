        "text": "Tête-à-Tête: The Lives and Loves of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nby Hazel Rowley\n\n429pp, Chatto & Windus, £20\n\n\"I realised that even if we went on talking till Judgment Day, I would still find the time all too short,\" wrote Simone de Beauvoir. When she met Jean-Paul Sartre in 1929, it seems as if officially the two smartest people in France, possibly the world, had decided to fall in love. Sartre proposed to her, not marriage, but a \"two-year lease\", involving separations and many lovers. Soon they were notorious, and sometimes punished, for a very public relationship in which others supposedly came and went without interfering with the colossal intellectual concept of their pact, as they called it - Sartre and his beloved \"Beaver\" always to be spiritually true to each other and never jealous.\n\nWhat you learn from Tête-à-Tête is that this experiment hardly got off the ground as a moral basis for living, or any kind of living at all. Sartre, renowned for a certain intellectual honesty, spent his entire life lying his head off to a fluctuating coterie of extremely unhappy \"drowning women\". He wasn't just attracted to pathetic, crazed, needy types, but made them so. De Beauvoir, more than once accused of being his pimp, alternately enthused and despaired over the situation, which was never to change. But both felt guilty towards their acolytes, Sartre so much so that he attended his messed-up mistresses like a doctor, setting out every day on his \"medical round\".\n\nThey lied to each other, to everyone. In her memoirs, De Beauvoir omitted her affairs with women, and changed names to protect people. So where was the couple's fine disdain for bourgeois feeling? The whole thing was bourgeois as hell. The irony is that Sartre knew what he was, a classic philanderer straight out of Molière, and De Beauvoir tolerated it, as many a good bourgeoise had before her. Their only innovation was that she was encouraged to seek her own \"contingent loves\" - though Sartre snatched many of her girlfriends. For a couple who claimed to have reinvented sexual politics, there was an awful lot of weeping going on: the founder of modern feminism suffered from crises which she attributed to a fear of mortality and \"the void\", but which now sound more like panic attacks (often the result of living erroneously).\n\nShe had signed up to a lifetime of rejection, uncertainty and separation - all traditional strategies for quelling female sexuality. Sartre was \"a warm, lively man everywhere, but not in bed\", De Beauvoir told her lover Nelson Algren, who later reviled her for the callousness of Sartrean love: \"Anybody who can experience love contingently has a mind that has recently snapped.\" Sartre didn't like sex: his method of contraception was coitus interruptus and he always found his women too demanding. \"I was more a masturbator of women than a copulator,\" he admitted. Sartre was addicted from youth to trashy detective stories and cowboy stuff, and his sexuality was founded on the idea of men as protectors, and degraders, of women. He was sentimental and sought the melodrama of seduction: wind him up and he'd spout existential endearments.\n\nThe lack of authorial comment on these shenanigans makes Tête-à-Tête strangely uninvolving. But more alarmingly, Hazel Rowley has decided not to talk about Satre and De Beauvoir as writers. They worked like dogs all their lives, to a punishing schedule, bouncing ideas (and 20-year-olds) off each other. Their partnership and their love existed most vividly in their literary work. Without an acknowledgment of its meaning, and its place in their lives, this book descends into a litany of dreary hangers-on, telephone calls, appointments in cafés, plane trips and girls, girls, girls. The Second Sex comes across as just a book about women that De Beauvoir wrote by going to the Bibliothèque Nationale a lot. The three volumes of Sartre's revelatory Roads to Freedom are mentioned more or less as dates in the couple's hectic publishing calendar. Rowley's readings of their novels are overly literal - there are more urgent things to say about them than which protégé was portrayed as which character. What is the point of such an approach? To treat Sartre and De Beauvoir this way is to deny them as artists.\n\nRowley can be prissy and unsympathetic - she is bothered by Sartre's podginess, his smoking, drinking and use of amphetamines, and carps at his diet, which was rich when he could get it. This seems ungenerous in the light of the stringencies of the German occupation, and makes an ugly contrast with her gushing confession that she decided on the title of her book over lattes in Harvard Square. She complains that Sartre's fingernails were filthy - but he cannot have been the only man with dirty fingernails in Paris in 1945. In old age he sometimes had mayonnaise on his face. Big deal.\n\nNo explanation is given of Sartre's baffling legal adoption of one of his fans, Arlette Elkaïm, who now seems to squat over his literary estate with the obstinacy of the constipated on the only loo in the house. Clearly there have been archival impediments thrown in Rowley's way, but that is no excuse for the absence of analysis or inventiveness in her telling of this tale. Nor does it help when she bends over backwards to avoid saying something plainly: when Sartre dies, De Beauvoir hurries back to the hospital to find him \"looking much the same, except that he was no longer breathing\".\n\nSartre's funeral procession through Montparnasse in 1980 is described in some detail, but we are told almost nothing of De Beauvoir's final six years without him, or about Sylvie Le Bon, her last lover and companion, one of the few members of the Sartrean \"family\" with her head screwed on. Worst of all, in a book about a woman who had a terror of mortality, and who wrote feelingly about the deaths of her mother and Sartre, it is surprising to find De Beauvoir's own death dealt with in a single dry paragraph. You begin to feel Sartre has exhausted poor Rowley as well."
