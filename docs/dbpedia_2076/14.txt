Today’s Horoscopes – July 18, 2022

Aries [March 21 – April 20] – Social responsibilities might appear to be hitting you all at once. Everyone you know seems to crave your company. As a naturally polite and socially astute person, you might feel obligated to accept any and all invitations. This is not a good day to commit yourself. Wait a while until you are feeling a little more balanced, then send out your responses. Commit only to those events you would genuinely enjoy!

Taurus [April 21 – May 21] – Important communications regarding finances could come today, and it might be fortuitous if you follow up on them right away. Once that is done, you will probably want to relax and delve into whatever interests you the most. It might be a good idea to read a book, since your mind is especially sharp. Take breaks in the fresh air. Ideas and insights should come quickly, so take notes!

Gemini [May 22 – June 21] – Your sensual side is likely to show itself today. You might find yourself viewing young folks in tight jeans more appreciatively than you usually do. Racy novels and movies might also suddenly seem appealing. Romantic encounters are intense and passionate, so make sure you allow plenty of time for them. Enjoy yourself!

Cancer [June 22 – July 22] – Ingenious techniques for growing your money could come your way today. While you are not one to jump into anything, you are certainly likely to give these ideas serious thought. Take care to only go for those that are totally up front, with no hidden sides. Your passion for delving into new professional fields is only surpassed by your romantic passions. Plan a seductive evening with a partner. Make it a night to remember!

Leo [July 23 – Aug. 23] – Today you are likely to be in just the right place at the right time to meet the right person. You are overdue for a lucky break and probably not expecting it. You may start the day in a restless and frustrated state of mind, but whatever happens will catapult you out of it. Be prepared – this transition may involve vast changes in your life, in the long run if not immediately!

Virgo [Aug. 24 – Sept. 22] – You might wake up this morning, look in the mirror, and decide you hate what you see even though you probably look fine. This is a good day to shop for new clothes or get a haircut. Perhaps you feel a little blue. Getting out and indulging yourself is more a necessity than luxury. Do not overindulge in food or drink now. You might not like the consequences tomorrow!

Libra [Sept. 23 – Oct. 23] – Today you could find yourself seeking self-knowledge through relationships, especially through assisting those you love. Someone is troubled and needs your help. It would be best for all if you gave it, because you are especially sensitive and insightful now. You are especially able to soothe others’ anger and mediate arguments. Your optimism is very high, and you have what it takes to pass it on to others!

Scorpio [Oct. 24 – Nov. 22] – Do you have a romantic evening planned for tonight? If so, it is likely to turn out to be all you had hoped for. You will be especially attractive, and your naturally warm and loving nature will be very apparent. Even casual encounters with friends may bring about closer bonding, and new acquaintances are likely to become friends. Your communicative skills are good now, and people will likely respond to you. Go for it!

Sagittarius [Nov. 23 – Dec. 21] – You could feel restless and anxious to get out in the open for a while today, but mundane tasks could force you to postpone it. Someone you care about might ask for a favour, and while you may not want to help this person, you probably will. Do not let your irritation show – just get it done quickly and accept the person’s thanks. In the evening, go for a long walk under the stars!

Capricorn [Dec. 22 – Jan. 20] – At some point during the day you might find yourself involved in a project that piques your interest far more than usual. You could throw yourself more deeply into it than is necessary now. Take care it does not distract you from what needs to be done. Your wisdom is especially sharp, and you can use your intuition to gain valuable practical knowledge. Spend the evening meditating!

Aquarius [Jan. 21 – Feb. 18] – Are you hoping to accomplish a goal you have been working toward for a long time? Do not let delays cause you to fear it will never happen. It could block your creative energy and cause you to lose faith in yourself. Fortunate changes are in the wind, but it is still going to take a little more effort to get where you want to be. Keep going. You will get there!

Pisces [Feb. 19 – March 20] – You may be in an especially nurturing mood today. You might reach out to every living thing around you, from plants to pets to friends, children, and romantic partners. There is a danger of being too helpful and supportive, which some could find stifling. Your loved ones like to see you relaxed and happy, so channel some energy into indulging yourself. Go for a massage or other treat. Live a little!
