These Suiones had ships that were peculiar because they had a prow in both ends (the shape we recognise as Viking ships). We can also note that Rome received gifts from a people called \"Suethidi\"(cf. the Old Norse name for Sweden: Suithioth). The Goths also mentioned a people in Scandinavia called Suehans. We can conclude that although written sources in Sweden appear late, the country has much older roots.\n\nDuring the 12th century, Sweden gradually became a unified Christian kingdom that would also come to include Finland. Queen Margaret I of Denmark united the Nordic countries in the Kalmar Union in 1397. Continual tension within the countries and within the union gradually led to open conflict between the Swedes and the Danes in the 15th century. The union's final disintegration in the early 16th century brought on a long-lived rivalry between Denmark on one side and Sweden on the other.\n\nSweden's predominantly agricultural economy shifted gradually from village to private farm-based agriculture during the Industrial Revolution, but this change failed to bring economic and social improvements commensurate with the rate of population growth. About 1 million Swedes immigrated to the United States between 1850 and 1890. The 19th century was marked by the emergence of a liberal opposition press, the abolition of guild monopolies in trade and manufacturing in favour of free enterprise, the introduction of taxation and voting reforms, the installation of national military service.\n\nDuring and after World War I, in which Sweden remained neutral, the country benefited from the world-wide demand for Swedish steel, ball-bearings, wood pulp, and matches. Post-war prosperity provided the foundations for the social welfare policies characteristic of modern Sweden.\n\nSweden followed a policy of armed neutrality during World War II and currently remains non-aligned. Sweden became a member of the European Union in 1995.\n\nCaroline, the UU:\n\nIt replaces Musketman , has 2 extra defensive points and cost 10 shields more.\n\nFor one thing, I think it's great that you've finally completed what we didn't have the ambition to do. THANKS! I've really waited for Sweden to become it's on civ in the game! Now, I will write down some things that I think can be improved:\n\nTraits\n\nThey should, just as the Vikings, be militaristic and seafaring. Sweden had 200 years of different wars, and at one time the whole baltic sea was part of the Swedish Empire. Sweden has marched into Copenhagen, conquerd Poland, sacked Prague, won several wars against Russia, occupied north Germany and of course annihilated all the baltic states. This is only a part of all that the Army of Sweden has accomplished. Of course it didn't all happen at the same time, but this was the golden age of Sweden and it's pride in history. Even though Sweden has not fought a war in the last 200 hundred years, I think the era of the Swedish superpower should dominate the traits and therefor Sweden should be Militaristic and Seafaring. As a matter of fact I could go with Commercial too, since Sweden has been, since (and because of) the end of WWII, been one of the greatest welfare states in the world. For some years even the top welfare country!\n\nNational leader\n\nI think Gustav II Adolf is a good choice for a leader, \"The Lion from the North\" made Sweden well known to the European countries, but there are other kings you just can't ignore, such as:\n\nGustav Vasa, who liberated the country from the danish tyrann, from the Pope and most of all established the Monarchy of Sweden. I think he is the most important man in all of Sweden's history.\n\nKarl X, reformed the army, preparing it for other kings to use, but he was also a great leader in battle. He marched over the the frozen sea towards Denmark, and forced them to give him what today is south west Sweden. He did a successful conquest in Poland, and much much more. He is not the most famous one but without no doubt one of the most important characters in Swedish history.\n\nIf none of them is to be the leader of Sweden, they should at least be the top Military leaders, with Gustav Vasa as the first one.\n\nAggression level\n\nIt's quite difficult setting the aggression level of Sweden since it was extremely aggressive (5) in the earlier part of history and extremely pacifist inte later part (1). Perhaps something in the middle then? Though I could go with 4. There is also a reason for that.\n\nCity names\n\nWow, that's a lot of names you've got there! But what about Finland? Finland belonged to Sweden for about 500 years. All the Finnish cities have Swedish names as well as Finnish. Sweden founded most of them.\n\nMilitary leaders\n\nLet's skip the viking leaders! You can give them to the \"Scandinava nation\" that came with the game. The norwegian and the danish had great viking leaders as well, but no great leaders in the 1500-1700's as Sweden did. Let's focus on the Superpower era of Swedish history. These are my suggestions:\n\nGustav Vasa\n\nKarl X\n\nSten Sture\n\nKarl XII (Even though he lost his last wars, he defended Sweden in the Nordic War against Denmark, Russia, Sachsen and Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nAxel Oxenstierna (Even though he wasn't king he was at some time(s) head of state. He was an incredible advisor and I would refer to him as France's Richelieu)\n\nKarl XIII (When Gustav IV lost Finland to the Russians in the Napoleonic war, he was dethroned. Karl XIII became king and forced Norway into a \"union\" so that Sweden would keep it's honor in taking Norway when it had lost Finland.\n\nScientific leaders\n\nMost of the ones you've chosen are not known the people today. I think we should stick to the more famous ones. Such as:\n\nCarl von Linné\n\nAnders Celsius\n\nAlfred Nobel\n\nJohan Ericsson\n\nUU\n\nPerfect choice! But I would rather make it mor offensive than more defensive.\n\nPerhaps 4/4/1\n\n(By having the Karolins we should be able to draft! That's what the Karolean Army is famous for )"
