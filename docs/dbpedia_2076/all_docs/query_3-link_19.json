        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe people who may have been living in central North America 20,000 years ago saw ice and snow the year round. The men hunted along the edge of a great wall of ice that extended across the continent from ocean to ocean. In summer the women fished in chill streams that flowed from the melting ice. Anyone who ventured to climb the wall saw ice extending northward without a break.\n\nThese people were living in the grip of the latest Ice Age, a period when all of Canada, much of the United States, and most of northwestern Europe lay buried beneath sheets of ice hundreds or even thousands of feet thick. But these people did not live in bitter cold. The average temperature was only 10 or 12 degrees lower than it is today along the border between the United States and Canada. Moreover, this cooler average and the very Ice Age itself were caused largely by cool summers rather than by bitter winters. There was not enough heat in the warm months to melt away the previous winter’s snow and ice. So they piled up year after year, until they covered the northern country.\n\nThe biggest difference between the country near the edge of the ice sheet and the same country today was in the vegetation and animal life. The cold prevented the growth of trees, grasses, and most flowering plants. The ground was covered with mosses and lichens, and in the warmest weeks a few fast-blooming plants such as we find in the Arctic today sprang up (see Arctic regions). The principal animals were wild reindeer, or caribou, musk-oxen, and mammoths, which could paw through snow to get food, and meat eaters, such as bears and wolves.\n\nToday, some geologists say, this Ice Age is finally coming to an end. Inhabitants of Greenland live near the edge of a glacier that covers most of the island. The Antarctic is almost completely covered by a vast ice sheet. These enormous glacial areas are called ice caps. The slow-moving rivers of ice that fill valleys in the Alps and other high mountain ranges are called valley glaciers. (See also Alps; Antarctica; glacier; Greenland.)\n\nWhy Scientists Believe in an Ice Age\n\nWhy do scientists believe that ice once covered so much of North America? The answer begins with Louis Agassiz, who was born in 1807 in Switzerland (see Agassiz). Agassiz became a teacher of natural science, and he knew much about the glaciers of his native Alps. He observed how they rubbed the valley floors and sides, carried rocks, and left mounds of gravel as they melted.\n\nHe noticed also that boulders of granite could be found hundreds of miles from any solid granite formations. Finally, bedrock far from the Alps showed grooves and scratches (called striae, from the Latin for “furrows”), such as would be made if glaciers had pushed small rocks over it. But if the glaciers had been big enough to do this, they must have covered most of Northern Europe.\n\nOther Traces of the Ice Age\n\nGeologists use modern glaciers as a guide in studying the old Ice Age. These show how the piled-up snow changed to sandlike grains near the surface and to ice below. When the ice became about 150 feet thick, it pushed out at the edges. The creeping ice rubbed away small hills and carried their gravel, sand, and clay into the valleys. These deposits are called glacial till. Streams from the melting edges of the glaciers scattered sand and gravel in long, crooked mounds called eskers. Drifts that piled up under the ice now appear as low hills called drumlins.\n\nDuring this flow the ice carried boulders and soil southward until it reached a climate warm enough to melt it completely each summer. As it melted, it dropped its burden upon a sort of rubbish heap, called a moraine, along the line of melting. When warmer summers drove this line northward, the moraines were left. Today they are seen as broad, gently sloping mounds across the landscape.\n\nWherever the ice retreated, the water from the melting edge had to find new channels, for the old river valleys were filled with drift. Much of the flow was caught behind the moraines, and the waters spread out to form lakes. As the levels of these lakes rose, they overflowed at low places and often joined one another in long chains connected by small streams. A glance at any map of the northern United States and southern Canada will show this wealth of connected lakes and streams. The lakes range in size from small forest pools to the Great Lakes (see Great Lakes).\n\nAs geologists studied this sort of evidence throughout the world, they decided that Agassiz’s simple “Ice Age” really consisted of four distinct periods; that is, the ice formed and advanced, then gradually melted back toward the poles, on four different occasions. They believe this because they find moraines and other deposits from each period, and in places these lie one over another, so that the younger can be distinguished from the older.\n\nIn the United States, each of the four cold periods, called glaciations, is named for a state that was reached by its ice. The intervening warm periods, called interglacial phases, are named for localities where relics from them were studied. In Europe, the glacial phases are named for the little Alpine river where they were studied and the interglacial periods are indicated by hyphenating the names of the glacial periods that preceded and followed.\n\nGlacial and Interglacial Periods period in America in Europe first glaciation Nebraskan Günz warmer period Aftonian Günz-Mindel second glaciation Kansan Mindel warmer period Yarmouth Mindel-Riss third glaciation Illinoian Riss warmer period Sangamon Riss-Würm fourth glaciation Wisconsin Würm warmer period Modern or Postglacial Modern or Post-Würm\n\nFrom the direction of the grooves or striae in the bedrock, it has been established that in North America the ice always spread out from the same three centers or ice caps, named after the regions they covered: Labrador, Keewatin, and Cordilleran. The thicknesses of the ice sheets in various places were measured by the height of the striae on mountain sides.\n\nMany types of animals that formerly inhabited North America were driven out or destroyed by the successive invasions of ice. Among them were the huge elephant-like mastodon, the saber-toothed tiger, members of the camel and llama family, and several species of horses.\n\nPatient study has helped geologists estimate how long ago each of the four ice sheets covered North America and Europe. In general it seems that the Nebraskan ice sheet covered North America perhaps 2,000,000 years ago, the Kansan sheet 1,250,000 years ago, the Illinoisan sheet 500,000 years ago, and the Wisconsin sheet 100,000 years ago. The warm period called the Yarmouth, between the Kansan and the Illinoisan glaciations, lasted much longer than any other period, warm or cold.\n\nThe latest, or Wisconsin, sheet probably began to melt at its edges about 40,000 years ago. The ice cap centered over Labrador drew back from the Niagara Falls region about 36,000 years ago and left New England clear about 28,000 years ago. The Keewatin ice cap, longer and thicker, did not leave Minnesota until about 15,000 years ago. Europe’s ice blanket melted from central Germany 17,000 years ago, and from Sweden 13,000 years ago.\n\nHow the Ice Age Has Affected Modern Life\n\nThe immense amount of glacial drift inherited from the Ice Age has influenced the character of soil and the development of agriculture (see soil).\n\nOther changes were caused by the tremendous weight of the ice sheet. It was about 2 miles thick over much of North America. This placed 400 tons or more upon every square foot of surface. The Earth’s crust sank under this heavy load—from 300 to 800 feet in areas like New England. Here the land has not yet risen to its former level, and many ancient valleys are now under the sea, forming bays and inlets. Chile and Norway present other “drowned coasts,” with many fjords filling valleys that old glaciers gouged out.\n\nThe estimated 12 million square miles of thick ice sheets were formed, of course, of water drawn from the oceans. This lowered the oceans several hundred feet below their present level, all around the world. Old, low shorelines have been found by sounding beneath the sea off the Hawaiian Islands, Bermuda, and elsewhere. A huge amount of water still remains locked in ice over Antarctica and Greenland. If this should melt, it would raise the oceans about 200 feet.\n\nHumans moved southward and northward, as the ice sheets advanced and retreated. In Colorado and nearby, flint arrowheads have been found embedded in the bones of Ice Age animals. During the last cold period in Europe, humans lived in caves where they left stone relics (see human origins).\n\nEvidence of Earlier Ice Ages\n\nThe latest Ice Age, with its four phases, was by no means the only one in the Earth’s long history, according to geologists. They believe that two ice ages occurred, one in eastern Canada, and another in China, South Africa, Norway, and North America during Proterozoic times (see geology).\n\nDuring the Paleozoic era, the Coal Age with its luxurious swamp growth seems to have been closed by the most severe ice age the world has ever known. Even tropical lands in India and Africa show evidence of ice sheets. South America may have been ice-capped from the Brazilian jungles southward.\n\nCauses Are Mysterious\n\nIce ages arrive, as we have seen, when the climate of a region becomes cooler. Summer heat fails to melt away winter ice and snow. The question asked by scientists and environmentalists today is: Why did these events occur in the Earth’s history?\n\nSome scientists have tried to explain this by variations in the movement of the Earth around the sun. But no variation has ever been found that fits both the theories of astronomy and the record of what has happened on the Earth. Others have guessed that blankets of dust or of carbon dioxide got into the air and cut off part of the sun’s heat. Another theory was advanced in the early 1930s by the British meteorologist Sir George C. Simpson. He suggested that, as in the case of some other stars, the sun’s temperature may have varied greatly in past ages. His theory still requires additional factual support.\n\nCalendars in Clay Deposits\n\nA useful discovery for studying the history of the Ice Age was made by Baron Gerard de Geer of Sweden. He devised a system for estimating the length of the Ice Age by examining the soil deposits on the bottoms of ancient glacier-fed lakes. These deposits were left by the outflow of water from melting ice. Their composition differed with the seasons. Coarse sand settled in the summer because of heavy melting. Thinner layers of fine clay were deposited over the sand during the winter. The combined deposit (summer and winter) for a single year is called a varve (Swedish for “layer”).\n\nStudy showed that varves differ in thickness for different years. A varve deposited in a moist year is thicker than a varve deposited in a dry year. Wet and dry years tend to occur in groups. It was found that the varves in all the lakes of a region showed a similar pattern. A year-by-year count of Ice Age time could be obtained by studying deposits made as the ice cap receded over several lake beds. Distinctive patterns appeared near the tops of deposits in southerly lakes. Farther north these patterns were found near the bottoms of new lakes. By moving northward and studying the varve patterns in successive lakes, it was possible to estimate the dates during which the retreat of the ice cap occurred.\n\nBaron De Geer and his pupils made reasonably complete year counts in Europe. One pupil, Ernst Antevs, made a similar count in North America, from Long Island Sound to Hudson Bay. Their work helped to provide dates for the latest glaciation.\n\nEstimated End of the Ice Age\n\nDe Geer estimated that the Ice Age ended with the melting of ice from a fork in the upper Angerman River in northern Sweden. By this time, climatic conditions much as they are at the present-day had appeared over most of Europe.\n\nBased on his studies and method of calculation, De Geer concluded that the Ice Age ended about 6740 bc. This estimate allowed for an uncertainty of a few hundred years. Scientists accept this span of time as reasonably accurate, but there is disagreement concerning methods used to arrive at the estimate. This date would coincide with what historians know about the start of human civilization, especially its agricultural base, and the movement of people into northern Europe."
