This space on Sunday is generally reserved for a single poet to read one of their works, but this week’s issue -Father’s Day – features 23 poets who weigh in on the complexity of their relationship with their father, revealing love, warmth, regret, sorrow – and in many cases a strong connection … Continue reading “The Sunday Poem(s): 23 Poets remember their father…”\n\n...\n\nJazz…in eight poems\n\nA myriad of styles and experiences displayed in eight thoughtful and provocative poems about jazz music…\n\n...\n\n“And I’m Not Even Here” – a poem by Connie Johnson\n\nCacophonous —\n\nThe honk, the blare of the tenor sax\n\nAnd the scream!

What this says about jazz music and jazz poetry – and this community – is that the connection between the two art forms is inspirational and enduring, and that poets are finding a place for their voice within these virtual pages.\n\n...\n\nThe Sunday Poem: “Dorothy Donegan: Queen of the Keys” – by Connie Johnson\n\nSensational\n\nLargely unsung\n\nDorothy Donegan\n\nKnown by jazz insiders as\n\nThe female Art Tatum\n\nHis protégé\n\nThe one who made him say:\n\n“She is the only woman who can\n\nMake me practice.”\n\n...\n\nNominations for the Pushcart Prize XLVIII\n\nAnnouncing the six writers nominated for the Pushcart Prize v.

The work is unified by the poets’ ability to capture the abundance of jazz music, and their experience with consuming it.\n\n...\n\nA handful of jazz haiku…by Connie Johnson\n\nThe poet covers the spirit of the music, and the likes of Coltrane, Handy, and Ella…\n\n...\n\nJazz Haiku – a sampler\n\nIn anticipation of a collection of jazz haiku — to be published sometime in August, 2023 — a small sampling of the jazz haiku received so far is published here.\n\n...\n\nThe Sunday Poem: “I Thought About You” by Connie Johnson\n\nThe poet recalls an encounter with Carmen McRae at a Hollywood shoe store\n\n...\n\nThoughts on Wes Montgomery\n\nA poem and an essay devoted to the legendary jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery\n\n...\n\nA Collection of Jazz Poetry — Spring, 2023 Edition\n\nThis is the 14th extensive collection of jazz poetry published on Jerry Jazz Musician since the fall of 2019, when the concept was initiated. Like all previous volumes, the beauty of this edition is not solely evident in the general excellence of the published works; it also rests in the hearts of the individuals from diverse backgrounds who possess a mutual desire to reveal their life experiences and interactions with the music, its character, and its culture.\n\n...\n\nSix women poets “sing” the blues…\n\nPoetic narratives by six women experiencing the blues.\n\n..."
