The instrument acquired spectroscopic data in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum, which is sensitive to the temperature of the atmosphere and the chemical abundances. These observations revealed that within the auroral oval there are two regions of high temperatures located at two different altitudes. These are presumably caused by two different phenomena: direct heating from the incoming charged particles in the aurora at a height of 0.01 mbar and adiabatic heating in downdrafts at lower levels. A decrease in temperature was also observed as we approached the South Pole, probably caused by a cold polar vortex associated with stratospheric hazes. We found that the altitude of the homopause (the limit between the well-mixed part of the atmosphere and the part where molecules are separated according their specific weight) is altered by the auroras, being up to 100 km higher in the auroral region. The atmospheric abundances of acetylene and ethane showed an enrichment of acetylene within the auroral oval, and of ethane at the pole, which may indicate that these molecules are not affected in the same way by the energy input of the aurora.]\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe polar regions of Jupiter’s atmosphere are affected by electron and ion precipitation and Joule heating originated by the Jovian magnetosphere. This energy deposition in the atmosphere causes an increase in spectral emission in X-rays Gérard et al. (2014), UV Greathouse et al. (2021), near-infrared Castagnoli et al. (2022) and mid-infrared Caldwell et al. (1980); Livengood et al. (1993), and in the millimeter range Cavalié et al. (2023). In addition to the observable aurora, the consequences of these precipitations have a considerable impact on the thermal structure and the chemical composition of the giant planet’s atmosphere.\n\nOne of the main effects of charged particle precipitation is atmospheric warming through Joule heating. Sinclair et al. (2017) and Sinclair et al. (2018) studied the thermal structure in the North Polar Region (NPR), using Cassini-CIRS and Voyager-IRIS dataset, respectively, and ground-based observations from IRTF-TEXES. Both studies consistently identified two hotspots in the NPR, located at two different pressure levels inside the auroral oval. The first hotspot was located at 0.01 mbar and is attributed to a downward extension of the thermosphere, heated by Joule heating caused by the particle precipitation itself. The second hotspot, located at 1 mbar, is more puzzling. Sinclair et al. (2017) favored two possible explanations: adiabatic heating caused by a local downwelling driven by charged particle precipitation or a radiative heating driven by aerosols produced by auroral precipitation, though they have since ruled out the latter Sinclair et al. (2023-b). Stratospheric haze layers have indeed been inferred at high latitudes from ground-based Near Infrared (NIR) spectra and Cassini ISS images Zhang et al. (2013) and could significantly warm the stratosphere as suggested by Zhang et al. (2015), although the peak of aerosol density in the southern hemisphere was measured around 10 – 20 mbar, deeper than the hotspot located at 1 mbar.\n\nThe auroral heating is also subjected to temporal variations. Recent studies by Sinclair et al. (2023-a) attributed the temperature variability in data obtained with the TEXES instrument on the Gemini 8.1-m telescope to magnetospheric compression caused by varying solar wind activity. They found that during a compression event in the magnetosphere, the dusk side of the northern auroral oval at 0.01 mbar warms up, whereas temperatures at 1 mbar in the same horizontal location remain practically unchanged. In the same work, the South Polar Region (SPR) was also observed, and the respective auroral effects in the NPR and SPR were compared. They inferred a difference in the thermal profile between the NPR and the SPR, with the 1-mbar hotspot being more vertically extended down to higher pressure levels (from 1 to 10 mbar) in the SPR. In the NPR, the extent of the lower-altitude hotspot ranges from 1 to 4.7 mbar Flasar et al. (2004); Fletcher et al. (2016); Sinclair et al. (2017); O’Donoghue et al. (2021).\n\nA second effect of auroral precipitation is the possible variation of the homopause pressure level reported by previous studies. Parkinson et al. (2006), using Cassini UVIS observations, and Sinclair et al. (2020) using IRTF-TEXES observations of the H2 S(1), CH3 and CH4 emission features at 587, 606 and 1248 cm-1, found a homopause located at higher altitudes within the auroral region than in neighboring regions. In contrast, Kim et al. (2017), by combining ground-based observations of CH4 ν3subscript𝜈3\\nu_{3}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT lines, found a homopause localized at higher altitudes at lower latitudes than in auroral regions. To obtain this result, Kim et al. (2017) used a non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) CH4 radiative transfer code that has recently been revisited by Sánchez-López et al. (2022), who used ISO/SWS observation of the fundamental and hot ν3subscript𝜈3\\nu_{3}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT CH4 band and inferred a methane homopause pressure level in the equatorial region compatible with that inferred in non-auroral polar regions by Sinclair et al. (2020). Therefore, the question regarding a possible displacement of the homopause in the polar regions of Jupiter remains an ongoing debate. Regarding the mechanism behind the possible upward shift of the homopause, Sinclair et al. (2020) pointed to an increased mixing generated by auroral driven heating at higher altitudes that would transport hydrocarbons to higher altitudes, thus changing the level of the homopause compared to nearby non-auroral regions.\n\nAuroral precipitation is also thought to alter hydrocarbon chemistry. Specifically for C2 hydrocarbons, using Cassini-CIRS observations at a planetary scale, Nixon et al. (2010) measured a meridional profile of C2H6 abundance that slightly increased towards the Polar Regions between 1 and 10 mbar, and a C2H2 profile significantly decreasing polewards between 7 and 0.1 mbar. Fletcher et al. (2016) and Melin et al. (2018) reached similar conclusions using ground-based IRTF-TEXES spectra. On a more local scale, an increase in thermal infrared emissions has been observed in several spectral bands belonging to C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 within the auroral region Kostiuk et al. (1989); Drossart et al. (1993); Sinclair et al. (2023-a). Although the enhancement of radiance towards the poles can be correlated with temperature enhancements, these studies suggest that charged particle precipitation may also influence the abundance of these species within the auroral region.\n\nUsing their retrieved thermal structure, Sinclair et al. (2017, 2018, 2023-a) obtained the abundance of C2H2 and C2H6 hydrocarbons within and outside the auroral oval from space-borne and ground-based dataset. The first two studies mostly addressed the NPR, with the Southern Auroral Oval being hardly sampled, while the third study addressed both the North and South Polar Regions. For the NPR, C2H2 was more abundant within the auroral oval in the three studies. However, the specific pressure level at which this increase in abundance occurred varied from one study to another. While Sinclair et al. (2017, 2018) retrieved an abundance increase at pressures ranging from 0.01 to 4 mbar, Sinclair et al. (2023-a) found a noticeable increase only between 1 and 4 mbar. For C2H6, the measurements obtained in the three studies are different. While Sinclair et al. (2017) measured a clear increase at 4.7 mbar, Sinclair et al. (2018) reported a depletion. The most recent study by Sinclair et al. (2023-a) did not indicate a clear variation in this regard. For the SPR, Sinclair et al. (2023-a) found that both acetylene and ethane showed an increase in their abundance within the Southern Auroral Oval compared to the latitudes near the equator, but at different pressure levels. The enhancement was larger around 1 mbar for C2H2, and around 5 mbar for C2H6. Nevertheless, they cautioned that observing the Southern Oval was difficult even with a large telescope and that their analysis may be affected by insufficient spatial resolution.\n\nTo explain the different behavior of ethane and acetylene in the Polar Regions, Sinclair et al. (2017, 2018) used the chemical model proposed by De La Haye et al. (2008). This model suggests that ion-neutral chemistry preferentially enhances the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons over that of saturated hydrocarbons. This enhancement of unsaturated hydrocarbon is proposed to be diffused downward within the auroral oval, leading to a local C2H2 maximum. Outside the oval, neutral photochemistry converts C2H2 into C2H6. However, a previous ion-neutral chemical model was proposed by Kim and Fox (1994), in which C2H2 is preferentially destroyed by ion-neutral chemical reactions. This possibility was invoked by Hue et al. (2018) to explain the decoupling in the ethane and acetylene equator-to-pole meridional distributions reported by Nixon et al. (2010). Indeed, using a 2D transport-chemical model, Hue et al. (2018) showed that neither photochemistry nor a combination of diffusive and advective transport could reproduce the anti-correlated ethane and acetylene meridional distributions seen in the Cassini-CIRS data. Given constraints brought by the temporal monitoring of post SL9-species Moreno et al. (2003); Griffith et al. (2004); Lellouch et al. (2006), they concluded that an additional C2H2 loss mechanism was required to explain both C2H2 and C2H6 meridional trends. Alternatively, if no meridional diffusion and transport processes are included in the 2D model, then an additional C2H6 production process is required. One should remember that Hue et al. (2018) interpreted retrievals from the Cassini-CIRS observations, which purposely excluded the longitudinal range of the auroral region at high latitudes Nixon et al. (2010).\n\nThe situation is further complicated because diffusive transport and advection can redistribute species on timescales shorter than their typical chemical lifetime Lellouch et al. (2006). In this context, spectroscopic observations, simultaneously covering several hydrocarbon species, and sampling the polar regions at a high spatial scale, are essential to better constrain the role of ion-neutral chemistry and transport in auroral regions.\n\nIn this study, we present an analysis of the thermal and chemical structure of the Jovian stratosphere in the SPR of Jupiter. We use observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), specifically from the Mid InfraRed Instrument - Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MIRI-MRS) Wells et al. (2015); Ressler et al. (2015), obtained on December 24th 2022. MIRI-MRS allows us to combine high spatial resolution and mid-spectral resolution, as well as a simultaneous coverage of the full 555 – 2080 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μm wavelength range. MIRI spectral resolving power of ∼3700similar-toabsent3700\\sim 3700∼ 3700 for channel 2 allows us to measure the temperature from 20 mbar to 0.01 mbar, the C2H2 abundance between 3 and 0.1 mbar, and the C2H6 abundance from 5 mbar to 1 mbar, inside and outside the Southern Auroral Oval. It also allowed us to infer the homopause level inside and outside the oval.\n\nWe have structured the article as follows: in Section 2, we provide a comprehensive presentation of the challenges associated with utilizing the MIRI-MRS instrument with bright objects. We also describe in detail the data reduction process. In Section 3, we explain the methodology used and the procedure necessary to retrieve the homopause pressure level, the temperature, and the abundances of chemical species, as well as the error analysis of the measurements. Section 4 presents the results on the location of homopause, the 3D thermal structure, and the 3D hydrocarbon distribution. In Section 5, we discuss and compare our results with previous studies, a summary of our is presented in Section 6.\n\n2 Observations\n\nThe MIRI instrument onboard JWST Rieke et al. (2015) observed Jupiter’s SPR on 2022 December 24, as part of the #⁢1373#1373\\#1373# 1373 Early Release Science program (PI: Imke de Pater and Thierry Fouchet). The MRS mode was adopted for these observations. This mode uses 4 integral field units (IFU) that can observe the planet simultaneously, covering between them the spectral range of 347.2 – 2080 cm-1. Each IFU probes a specific spectral range and has an angular resolution and Field of View (FOV) tailored to its specific diffraction limit. These four IFUs are coaligned and cover the spectral ranges from 2080 – 1307.2, 1331.5 – 854, 865.8 – 554.9, and 564.6 – 347.2 cm-1, respectively Wells et al. (2015). Furthermore, each of these 4 ranges (from now on referred to as Channels 1 – 4) are further divided into three sub-bands (’SHORT’, ’MEDIUM’ and ’LONG’, see Table 1). A given sub-band is acquired simultaneously by the four IFUs. Therefore, three successive exposures are required to sample the full spectral range. As a result, our observations yielded 12 different hyperspectral cubes with different temporal, spectral, and spatial sampling, which needed to be projected onto Jupiter’s disk. A more in-depth explanation of the spatial registration is detailed in Section 2.5. Table 1 summarizes the main information of the dataset used for our analysis.\n\nIn our observations, we mapped the SPR with a mosaic of 3 tiles centered at different longitudes. Each tile was observed using a 2-point dither pattern and a 527.258 s exposure time per sub-band for 5 groups. Our observations covered latitudes poleward of 50∘S and the FOV for each observation was centered at 340∘W, 70∘W and 140∘W (System III). The detector readout was performed in FASTR mode to account for the brightness of our target, since Jupiter would saturate slower readout modes. Fig. 1 shows the three navigated cubes from channel 2-SHORT at 1306 cm-1 (Q branch emission of the CH4 ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band). Figs. 2 and 3 display the three navigated cubes from channel 3-MEDIUM at 714 cm-1 and 1-MEDIUM at 1515 cm-1, probing the emission of C2H2 and C2H6 respectively.\n\nMIRI and the other instruments on board JWST are based on a non-destructive up-the-ramp readout Ressler et al. (2015), which means that the total integrations of our observation is divided into a user-specified number of groups (5 in our case). Each group is then downlinked to the ground and included in JWST archived data. Our dataset was processed using the 1.11.3 version of the JWST pipeline Bushouse et al. (2022), and the CRDS (Calibration References Data System) file j⁢w⁢s⁢t⁢_⁢1119.p⁢m⁢a⁢pformulae-sequence𝑗𝑤𝑠𝑡_1119𝑝𝑚𝑎𝑝jwst\\_1119.pmapitalic_j italic_w italic_s italic_t _ 1119 . italic_p italic_m italic_a italic_p. This pipeline consists of 3 distinct steps or ’stages’. The objective of ’Stage 1’ is to apply corrections at the detector level, i.e., subtraction of the dark current, subtraction of the detector superbias (This step removes the fixed detector bias from a science data set by subtracting a superbias reference image (https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/superbias/description.html)), as well as ramp fitting by means of a linear fit of different groups within an integration. This process allows for the calculation of counts per second for each pixel in the detector image. In this stage, pixels can be flagged as saturated if the linear fit is not optimum (see Section 2.1). Stage 2 applies instrument-level corrections. This includes flat field correction, photometric corrections, background subtraction, and conversion of the count rates into physical units (MJy/sr). Finally, ’Stage 3’ combines the calibrated products from the previous stage, and converts the detector images into hyperspectral cubes.\n\nIn addition to this standard pipeline process, a series of specific processes required by our observations have been carried out to correct artifacts that we found affected our dataset. In the following sections, we will show these artifacts and explain the strategy followed to correct them.\n\n2.1 Saturation\n\nThe high sensitivity of the instruments on board JWST becomes problematic when working with dataset of bright bodies. This is specifically the case for our MIRI observations. In the MIRI wavenumber range, Jupiter’s brightness temperature is never lower than ∼similar-to\\sim∼120K. For this reason, our program was scheduled to be carried out with 16 integrations per exposure and 5 groups per integration, and the detector readout set to the FASTR mode. This configuration allowed us to limit the occurrence of saturated pixels at wavenumbers shortwards of 1000 cm-1.\n\nThis saturation problem can be solved thanks to the readout mode chosen for the JWST detectors Ressler et al. (2015). This readout process, and the availability of all the groups, allows us to manually reduce the effective integration time by reducing the number of groups used in the data reduction procedure. As a result, we can effectively mitigate the saturation problem.\n\nFig. 4 a) shows how this up-the-ramp readout works. The linearity of the count readout, with respect to the number of groups, serves as an indicator of the readout quality. When the number of counts reaches a certain threshold value Glasse et al. (2015), the linearity is lost, and the pipeline flags this readout as saturated.\n\nFor each detector readout, we have created five uncalibrated files (prior to running the pipeline), each including a specific number of groups, respectively the 1st, 1st and 2nd groups, 1–3 groups, 1–4 groups, and the 5 groups of the detector ramps. These uncalibrated files were subsequently processed through the regular three stages of the pipeline to produce five new calibrated hyperspectral cubes. To obtain the final hyperspectral cube, we combined the five different calibrated hyperspectral cubes. For each wavenumber and spaxel (spatial pixel in a reconstructed data cube stores the spectrum associated to a spatial element projected on the sky), we assigned the radiance from the hyperspectral cube created with the highest number of groups that were not saturated, as in Fletcher et al. (2023) and King et al. (2023). This approach was designed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. While this method allowed us to recover spectral information shortwards of 1000 cm-1, it was unable to completely desaturate some features, such as the C2H2 ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT Q-branch at 730 cm-1, and the C2H6 ν9subscript𝜈9\\nu_{9}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band centered at 822 cm-1. We also stress that using a smaller number of groups makes it more challenging to reject cosmic rays. We must keep in mind that some spaxels and wavenumbers may be statistically more affected by cosmic rays than others. Units were finally converted from MJy/sr to W cm-2 sr-1 / cm-1.\n\n2.2 Spectral calibration\n\nThe spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MIRI-MRS allowed us to identify a residual error in the pipeline wavenumber calibration process. For certain regions of the detector, the flat field correction applied by the version 1.11.3 of the pipeline exhibited deviations from the expected wavenumber calibration, leading to a small residual wavenumber deviation (∼0.25similar-toabsent0.25\\sim 0.25∼ 0.25 cm-1) in certain spaxels with respect to others. As a result, there appeared to be spatial striping, as different spaxels sampled different wavenumber offsets from the center of a given emission line, resulting in varying radiances. To address this issue, a new spectral calibration using observations of Jupiter GTO ##\\##1246 and Saturn GTO ##\\##1247 was used to improve the quality of the dataset used in this work. This new calibration step was developed following the procedure presented in Argyriou et al. (2023). These authors used the Jupiter and Saturn spectra (along with spectra from other programs) and compared them with synthetic spectra generated using the NEMESIS radiative transfer code Irwin et al. (2008). This comparison allowed them to determine the residual wavenumber shift as a function of wavenumber in the range of 2000 to 600 cm-1 and to propose a specific correction. This calibration step was already been validated by Fletcher et al. (2023) against the MIRI-MRS spectra of Saturn.\n\nThe spectra shortwards of 600 cm-1 are also affected by partial and total saturation. Even with only 1 group, the spectra, which should follow the shape of the black-body emission of Jupiter (∼similar-to\\sim∼120K) in this range, presents a series of wavelike features in addition to a saw-tooth noise always located at the same spectral positions. These features prevented us from using this spectral range in our analysis with the current state of the pipeline.\n\n2.3 Selection of the spectral regions\n\nTo investigate the thermal structure of Jupiter’s stratosphere, we inverted spectra covering the CH4 ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band, from 1240 to 1330 cm-1 (channel 2-SHORT), as in Fouchet et al. (2016). This spectral region allows us to probe the atmosphere in the pressure range between 0.01 and 20 mbar. We excluded the H2 S(1) line from our analysis, since the spectra at wavenumbers below 600 cm-1 are saturated, especially in the auroral region (see Sect. 2.1).\n\nWe also used the 1510 – 1570 cm-1 spectral range (channel 1-MEDIUM), where we observed a non-negligible contribution from the C2H6 ν8subscript𝜈8\\nu_{8}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band, to retrieve the volume mixing ratio (VMR) of this hydrocarbon (Section 4.3). Indeed, we have excluded the ν9subscript𝜈9\\nu_{9}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band centered at 822 cm-1, which is commonly used in the literature to retrieve the C2H6 abundance because in our MIRI-MRS dataset it is affected by partial saturation. Neighboring the ν8subscript𝜈8\\nu_{8}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT C2H6 band, CH4 emission lines from the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band are clearly visible. This band was used to retrieve the temperature in the pressure region from 0.1 – 30 mbar. Unlike the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band, the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band is a forbidden band with a weak Einstein coefficient and is not sensitive to higher altitudes.\n\nThe 680 – 760 cm-1 (channel 3-SHORT and MEDIUM) spectral range was used to retrieve the abundance of C2H2 through emissions in its ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT fundamental and harmonics bands. However, we excluded the ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band Q-branch centered at 730 cm-1 from our analysis. This particular branch remained saturated even at the lowest number of groups, especially in the auroral region. We also excluded the spectra between 695 and 705 cm-1, as it is affected by aerosol spectral features. It is important to note that the spectral resolution in the MRS mode varies across the different spectral regions. For the CH4 ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, C2H6, and CH4 ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT spectra, the spectral resolution is approximately 3700. On the other hand, for the C2H2 spectra, the spectral resolution is approximately 2400.\n\nIn summary, Fig. 5 presents a comparison of the three spectral ranges used in this study. The plot displays spectra obtained both inside and outside the auroral region for each range.\n\n2.4 SNR estimations\n\nThe error matrix associated with the MRS hyperspectral cubes exhibits very low values, with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) reaching as high as 5000 in some cases. However, after the desaturation process, this SNR is scaled by the fraction of groups remaining in our ∗′uncal.fits′{}^{\\prime}*uncal.fits^{\\prime}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ∗ italic_u italic_n italic_c italic_a italic_l . italic_f italic_i italic_t italic_s start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT files. As a result, our final SNRs are overall smaller than those given by the pipeline.\n\nWhen calculating the SNRs, the pipeline considers only the photon noise, readout noise, and detector noise components. However, for a bright target such as Jupiter, this approach underestimates the total noise present in the observations. Other noise sources, such as the noise due to calibration uncertainties, raising from the wavenumber calibration (striping), and other instrumental artifacts can contribute more significantly to the overall noise level. Therefore, the pipeline SNR estimation may not accurately reflect the true noise affecting our dataset. To address this issue, we have estimated the noise level present in the H2-He-CH4 continuum in channel 3-MEDIUM (645 – 665 cm-1) to obtain an associated SNR. From this value, we scaled the SNR value of the hyperspectral cubes until it is close to the SNR obtained in the continuum. In general, it was necessary to multiply the noise level given by the pipeline by a factor of 50 – 70, so the noise level actually reflects the true quality of our observations. After this correction, the resulting SNR has a value of ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 100 for the spectra in channel 2, and of ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 70 for the spectra in channel 3.\n\n2.5 Spatial registration\n\nWe projected each hyperspectral cube onto the disk of Jupiter using the JWST SPICE kernels (Version from July 2023) for the spatial registration. For each spaxel, we calculated planetographic and planetocentric latitude and longitude information, as well as the emission and incidence angles, and the distance to the limb of the planet, based in the pointing coordinates provided by the metadata of the hyperspectral cubes.\n\nDue to the significant time gaps between sub-bands, we processed each sub-band individually for each channel. Consequently, for each tile of our 3×1313\\times 13 × 1 mosaic, we performed navigation separately for the 12 hyperspectral cubes corresponding to each sub-band, as each one of them also has different pixel size and the pointing slightly changes between them. As Jupiter rotated by up to 10 degrees between sub-band observations, it was not feasible to use the same navigation data for all sub-bands within the same channel. Moreover, we needed to account for minor variations in telescope pointing between sub-bands, especially when analyzing spectra near the limb of the planet. The spatial registration code takes into account several parameters, including the telescope pointing, observation time, and the spaxel size specific to each channel and sub-band. For instance, at 70∘S, one spaxel projects onto 1∘ of longitude on the planet for wavenumbers centered at 1500 and 1300 cm-1, while for wavenumbers centered at 700 cm-1 the spatial resolution decreases, so that one spaxel at 70∘S projects as 2∘ of longitude on the planet.\n\n3 Data analysis\n\nIn the mid-infrared spectral ranges that we have analyzed, the temperature and molecular abundances are the main drivers in shaping the intensity of the emission lines. To reproduce and invert these emission spectra, we used a line-by-line radiative transfer code able to generate synthesized spectra from a given temperature vertical profile and prescribed molecular abundance profiles. We assume that the emission is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) at all pressure levels and discuss the associated limitations in Sec. 5. We divide the atmosphere in 361 layers, equally spaced in a logarithmic scale of pressure from 10 to 10−8superscript10810^{-8}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT bar. The code takes into account the latitudinal and vertical variations of gravity using the latest measurements of Jupiter’s gravity fields and rotation rate obtained by the Juno spacecraft Iess et al. (2018). Since our observations of the SPR encompassed some grazing angles, the length of the light path was calculated in spherical geometry. To do that, for each spaxel, we calculate the cosine of the local emission angle (μ⁢(z)𝜇𝑧\\mu(z)italic_μ ( italic_z )) for each layer, following:\n\nμ⁢(z)=1−(RR+z⁢1−μe2)2,𝜇𝑧1superscript𝑅𝑅𝑧1superscriptsubscript𝜇𝑒22\\mu(z)=\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{R}{R+z}\\sqrt{1-\\mu_{e}^{2}}\\right)^{2}},italic_μ ( italic_z ) = square-root start_ARG 1 - ( divide start_ARG italic_R end_ARG start_ARG italic_R + italic_z end_ARG square-root start_ARG 1 - italic_μ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG , (1)\n\nwhere μesubscript𝜇𝑒\\mu_{e}italic_μ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the cosine of the emission angle for a height of 0 km (corresponding to the 1-bar level). R𝑅Ritalic_R is the local radius of the planet at a given latitude, and z𝑧zitalic_z is the altitude of each layer with respect to the 1-bar pressure level.\n\nOur model takes into account opacities using the HITRAN 2020 database Gordon et al. (2022). The model includes the opacities of CH4, CH3D, NH3, PH3, C2H2, and C2H6. Furthermore, we take into account the collision-induced continuum of H2-He-CH4 in the same way as proposed by Borysow et al. (1985, 1988).\n\nThe deep volume mixing ratio (VMR) for methane is set to 2.04×10−32.04superscript1032.04\\times 10^{-3}2.04 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, as measured in-situ by the Galileo probe Wong et al. (2004). For CH3D, the deep VMR is set to 1.4×10−71.4superscript1071.4\\times 10^{-7}1.4 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, consistent with the analysis presented in Lellouch et al. (2001). For hydrocarbons, initial a priori profiles have been taken from the photochemical model of Moses and Poppe (2017). This model includes the complete chemical pathway presented in Moses et al. (2005) for the hydrocarbon chemical reactions triggered by photolysis. It has also been updated with ablation processes, that include the injection of exogenic species into the atmospheres from micrometeorites. The altitude of the homopause can be changed by varying the gradient of the eddy diffusion coefficient, as shown in Sinclair et al. (2020).\n\n3.1 Inversion algorithm\n\nThe retrieval of the vertical temperature or chemical abundance profiles from spectroscopic observations constitutes a challenge due to the degeneracy of possible solutions, which makes the retrieval of the atmospheric structure an ill-posed problem Rodgers (2000). In this work, we used a regularized retrieval algorithm detailed in Conrath et al. (1998) and used in several studies, such as Guerlet et al. (2009) and Fouchet et al. (2016) for Saturn. Starting from an a priori profile, this method inverts a posterior profile that provides the best fit to the observed spectra, smoothly departing from the a priori profile in pressure ranges where the information from the spectra dominates. Thus, starting from a priori profiles of temperature and abundances, the thermal and chemical profiles retrieved will remain close to the a priori profiles at pressure levels where there is little information content, while at pressure levels probed by the observations, the retrieved profile will depart from the a priori. This process helps to mitigate the ill-posed nature of the inversion and provides more reliable atmospheric structure estimates.\n\nOur algorithm assumes that the radiance can be linearized as a function of the model variables (temperature and abundance profiles) as follows.\n\nΔ⁢Ii=∑j=1n∂Ii∂x1,j⁢Δ⁢x1,j+∂Ii∂x2,j⁢Δ⁢x2,jΔsubscript𝐼𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑛subscript𝐼𝑖subscript𝑥1𝑗Δsubscript𝑥1𝑗subscript𝐼𝑖subscript𝑥2𝑗Δsubscript𝑥2𝑗\\Delta I_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial I_{i}}{\\partial x_{1,j}}\\Delta x_{1,% j}+\\frac{\\partial I_{i}}{\\partial x_{2,j}}\\Delta x_{2,j}roman_Δ italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG ∂ italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 , italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 , italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + divide start_ARG ∂ italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 , italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 , italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (2)\n\nwhere I𝐼Iitalic_I is the radiance at a specific wavenumber (νi~~subscript𝜈𝑖\\tilde{\\nu_{i}}over~ start_ARG italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG), and x𝑥xitalic_x the model variables, in our case the temperature Tjsubscript𝑇𝑗T_{j}italic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and the natural logarithm of the abundances l⁢n⁢(qj)𝑙𝑛subscript𝑞𝑗ln(q_{j})italic_l italic_n ( italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) (x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT). These variables are vectors, with the index j𝑗jitalic_j denoting the pressure layer. Δ⁢xjΔsubscript𝑥𝑗\\Delta x_{j}roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT represents the variation at a particular pressure level that will be added to the profile during a given iteration n𝑛nitalic_n to generate the reference profile for the subsequent iteration n+1𝑛1n+1italic_n + 1, from which the synthetic spectrum will be calculated. In Section 4.2 we inverted the stratospheric temperature only (x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), while in Section 5.3 we inverted the tropospheric temperature to fit the continuum (x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and the abundance of the hydrocarbon analyzed (x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT).\n\nFor clarity, this equation can be written in a simpler format, where we denote the derivative matrices as K1subscript𝐾1K_{1}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and K2subscript𝐾2K_{2}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with respect to the corresponding parameters x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, so that:\n\nΔ⁢Ii=K1⁢Δ⁢x1+K2⁢Δ⁢x2Δsubscript𝐼𝑖subscript𝐾1Δsubscript𝑥1subscript𝐾2Δsubscript𝑥2\\Delta I_{i}=K_{1}\\Delta x_{1}+K_{2}\\Delta x_{2}roman_Δ italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (3)\n\nThe formal solution to this ill-posed problem for the two variables x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and x2subscript𝑥2x_{2}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT can be written as:\n\nΔ⁢x1=U⁢Δ⁢I⁢ with ⁢U=α⁢S⁢K1T⁢(α⁢K1⁢S⁢K1T+β⁢K2⁢S⁢K2T+E2)−1Δsubscript𝑥1𝑈Δ𝐼 with 𝑈𝛼𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑇superscript𝛼subscript𝐾1𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑇𝛽subscript𝐾2𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾2𝑇superscript𝐸21\\Delta x_{1}=U\\Delta I\\textrm{ with }U=\\alpha SK_{1}^{T}(\\alpha K_{1}SK_{1}^{T% }+\\beta K_{2}SK_{2}^{T}+E^{2})^{-1}roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_U roman_Δ italic_I with italic_U = italic_α italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_α italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_β italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_E start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (4)\n\nΔ⁢x2=V⁢Δ⁢I⁢ with ⁢V=β⁢S⁢K2T⁢(α⁢K1⁢S⁢K1T+β⁢K2⁢S⁢K2T+E2)−1Δsubscript𝑥2𝑉Δ𝐼 with 𝑉𝛽𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾2𝑇superscript𝛼subscript𝐾1𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑇𝛽subscript𝐾2𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾2𝑇superscript𝐸21\\Delta x_{2}=V\\Delta I\\textrm{ with }V=\\beta SK_{2}^{T}(\\alpha K_{1}SK_{1}^{T}% +\\beta K_{2}SK_{2}^{T}+E^{2})^{-1}roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_V roman_Δ italic_I with italic_V = italic_β italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_α italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_β italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_E start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (5)\n\nwhere S𝑆Sitalic_S is the covariance matrix that smooths the variations in the variables by a given vertical length (given in scale heights). The matrix E𝐸Eitalic_E is the covariance matrix containing the measurement errors. In our case, the matrix E𝐸Eitalic_E is supposed to be diagonal. The parameters α𝛼\\alphaitalic_α and β𝛽\\betaitalic_β are scalar weight values that establish the balance between the a priori values and the information coming from the spectra. Guerlet (2010) found that these parameters (α𝛼\\alphaitalic_α and β𝛽\\betaitalic_β) are optimal when their values are set to equal the traces of the E2superscript𝐸2E^{2}italic_E start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT with the α⁢K1⁢S⁢K1T𝛼subscript𝐾1𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾1𝑇\\alpha K_{1}SK_{1}^{T}italic_α italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and β⁢K2⁢S⁢K2T𝛽subscript𝐾2𝑆superscriptsubscript𝐾2𝑇\\beta K_{2}SK_{2}^{T}italic_β italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_S italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT matrices.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds with a series of iterations, modifying the vertical profile at each step. By solving Eq.4, we obtain the variations of Δ⁢x1=Δ⁢TΔsubscript𝑥1Δ𝑇\\Delta x_{1}=\\Delta Troman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = roman_Δ italic_T and Δ⁢x2=Δ⁢l⁢n⁢(q)Δsubscript𝑥2Δ𝑙𝑛𝑞\\Delta x_{2}=\\Delta ln(q)roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = roman_Δ italic_l italic_n ( italic_q ) that are added to the previous vertical profile to generate new profiles that will be used as input for the radiative transfer code in the next iteration. Thus, the new value of the vector T𝑇Titalic_T would be T0+Δ⁢Tsubscript𝑇0Δ𝑇T_{0}+\\Delta Titalic_T start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + roman_Δ italic_T and the abundance q𝑞qitalic_q would be q0×(1+eΔ⁢l⁢n⁢(q))subscript𝑞01superscript𝑒Δ𝑙𝑛𝑞q_{0}\\times(1+e^{\\Delta ln(q)})italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT × ( 1 + italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT roman_Δ italic_l italic_n ( italic_q ) end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ). In addition to the input variables, the altitude grid changes as it depends on temperature, as well as the functional derivatives. The convergence of these iterations is governed by the quantity χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, an indicator of the goodness of fit, which compares the radiance of the synthetic spectrum generated by our algorithm with the radiance measured by MIRI-MRS (Equation 6). Iterations continue until a convergence criterion is reached, when the relative change in χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT between two successive iterations is less than or equal to 1%.\n\nχ2=∑(Δ⁢IiEi)2superscript𝜒2superscriptΔsubscript𝐼𝑖subscript𝐸𝑖2\\chi^{2}=\\sum\\left(\\frac{\\Delta I_{i}}{E_{i}}\\right)^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = ∑ ( divide start_ARG roman_Δ italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (6)\n\nTo estimate the information content of the retrieval, we used the averaging kernel matrix A=U⁢K𝐴𝑈𝐾A=UKitalic_A = italic_U italic_K. Each of the rows of the matrix A𝐴Aitalic_A represents the ratio between the relative weight of the measurement information, and the information from the a priori profile itself. Thus, as long as the peak of the function of each row (ajTsuperscriptsubscript𝑎𝑗𝑇a_{j}^{T}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT) reaches a significant value at the corresponding same pressure level pjsubscript𝑝𝑗p_{j}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, it means that the temperature or abundance information at that pressure level comes mainly from the measurement. Therefore, matrix A can be used to analyze the range of pressures probed by our measurements. Furthermore, we can quantify the number of independent pressure levels to which we are sensitive, also known as the degrees of freedom of the signal (d). This can be calculated using the expression:\n\nd=T⁢r⁢(A)𝑑𝑇𝑟𝐴d=Tr(A)italic_d = italic_T italic_r ( italic_A ) (7)\n\n3.2 Information content for the inversion of the thermal structure\n\nThe comparison between different spectra displayed in Fig. 5 clearly reveals the large difference in radiance between a spectrum obtained inside and outside the auroral oval. In fact, the spectra obtained in the polar auroral region cannot be satisfactorily fitted with the models assuming low CH4 abundances at higher altitudes, which suggests an upward shift of the homopause level.\n\nWhile it is possible to retrieve simultaneously the temperature and the CH4 vertical profiles, the degeneracy between these two variables makes the inversion unstable. Following the approach proposed by Sinclair et al. (2020), we found a more stable solution to only retrieve the temperature profile (x1subscript𝑥1x_{1}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from Eq. 2) using thirteen different CH4 vertical profiles. These profiles remain fixed throughout the inversion process. For each spaxel in our dataset, we compare the fits obtained for every CH4 profile and determine the CH4 vertical profile that yields the best fit. We then adopt the associated inverted temperature profile as our solution temperature profile for the given spaxel. Each CH4 profile is the result of the use of different eddy diffusion coefficients. We can assume then that each profile corresponds to a CH4 homopause height, as the homopause is defined as the pressure at which the molecular diffusion coefficient equals the eddy diffusion coefficient. Fig. 6 shows the different profiles used for our determination of the homopause location. As expected, we can clearly see an increase in the abundance of methane at higher altitudes associated with the upward displacement of the homopause. Model ##\\##0 corresponds to the lowest homopause height (∼similar-to\\sim∼326 km or 750 nbar), while model ##\\##12 corresponds to the highest homopause height (∼similar-to\\sim∼630 km or 0.2 nbar).\n\nGiven the spectral information provided within the MIRI-MRS spectral range, the thermal profile can be inverted in three different ways: using the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band of CH4 only, using the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band of CH4 only, or using both bands simultaneously. Fig. 7 illustrates the contribution functions for both bands, considering two different CH4 VMR profiles characteristic of a low and a high homopause, respectively (models 6 and 10 from Fig. 6 and models 3 and 7 in Sinclair et al. (2020)) using the thermal profile used in Moses et al. (2005). We see that the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band provides information near 1-20 mbar, but also at higher pressure levels (∼similar-to\\sim∼ 0.1 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar) for a high homopause conditions. Complementary, the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band has the largest information content between 20 and 0.1 mbar, with a significant contribution near 800 mbar, and also an increase at higher altitude for a high homopause although not as large as the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band. Although the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band exhibits an increase in information at these high altitudes for a model with the homopause located at higher altitudes, this increase is not as pronounced as in the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band. This indicates a much larger information content in the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band. Furthermore, the advantage of the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT spectral range is that it does not feature emissions from other molecules, such as C2H6 affecting CH4 ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT spectral range, which forces us to perform a simultaneous inversion of ethane abundance and temperature. These factors make the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band more useful than the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band to obtain information on the height of the homopause, given the low sensitivity of this band to atmospheric parameters at high altitudes, around the μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar pressure level (see the supplementary materials for more information on the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band). We hence decided to only use the CH4 ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band for the retrievals of the stratospheric temperatures.\n\nThe two left panels of Fig. 8 present the inverted temperature profiles obtained using the CH4 ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band (1240 –1330 cm-1) for the two CH4 spectra displayed in Fig. 5, sampling the thermal structure inside and outside the auroral oval. The inversion was carried out with a smoothing length of 0.75 scale height in the S𝑆Sitalic_S matrix, and using two different a priori profiles (dashed lines in Fig. 8). The first is the temperature profile used in Moses et al. (2005) photochemical model, while the second a priori profile deviates from the former, with a progressive increase starting at the 0.1-bar pressure level and being 20K warmer at the 1-mbar pressure level.\n\nInspection of the averaging kernels displayed in the two right panels of Fig. 8 confirms the sounded pressure levels. For the spectrum outside the auroral oval, significant averaging kernels are obtained up to the 0.5-mbar pressure level, while for the spectrum inside the auroral oval, the averaging kernels have significant values up to the 0.01 mbar level. This extra independent measurement compared to non-auroral regions is also illustrated by the number of degrees of freedom for each spectrum, 2.5 for the spectrum outside the auroral region, and 3.5 for the spectrum in the polar auroral region.\n\nUsing two different a priori profiles enables us to confirm the vertical sensitivity offered by our spectra and to estimate the precision of our measurements, taking into account the uncertainties on the temperature profile beyond the sounded pressure levels. We note that for the spectrum taken outside the auroral oval, the two inverted temperature profiles coincide within the 30 – 0.1 mbar pressure range. In contrast, for the spectrum sampling the interior of the oval, we can infer the temperature increase up to the 0.01 mbar pressure level, showing our capability to invert the temperature at higher altitudes within the auroral oval.\n\nThe goodness of the spectral fit is displayed in Fig.9. This figure shows that the difference in the shape of the Q-branch between the two spectra provides information on the temperature at high altitude. The residuals between the synthetic spectra and the observed spectra are larger for the scene inside the auroral oval. We think this may be due to molecular emissions not accounted for in our radiative transfer model. In particular, propane (C3H8) has several bands in this spectral region (ν12subscript𝜈12\\nu_{12}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ν19subscript𝜈19\\nu_{19}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 19 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) for which line lists are not included in HITRAN. Example of fits, information content and vertical sensitivity in the case of C2H6 and C2H2 retrievals will be shown in Section 4.3.\n\n3.3 Error analysis\n\nThe uncertainties affecting our retrieved temperature profiles are caused by two major sources. First, the instrumental noise level of MIRI-MRS. As explained in Sect.2.4, two components contribute to MIRI’s intrinsic noise: the Noise Equivalent Spectral Radiance (NESR), which is negligible for our dataset, and the calibration and reduction noise, which dominates the instrumental noise level. After adding the additional sources of error discussed in Section 2, the overall JWST NESR is translated into a precision better than 0.8 K on the retrieved temperature profiles.\n\nThe second major source of error is associated with uncertainties in the deep abundance of CH4. In our analysis, we used a reference value of 1.9×10−31.9superscript1031.9\\times 10^{-3}1.9 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, based on measurements from the Galileo probe Wong et al. (2004). We considered a range of variation for this abundance, from 1.5×10−31.5superscript1031.5\\times 10^{-3}1.5 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to 2.4×10−32.4superscript1032.4\\times 10^{-3}2.4 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, as Galileo Probe error bars span this VMR range. To assess the impact of this uncertainty, we repeated the full analysis for one hyperspectral cube by scaling the whole profile of the thirteen CH4 models used to deep volume mixing ratios if 1.5×10−31.5superscript1031.5\\times 10^{-3}1.5 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and 2.4×10−32.4superscript1032.4\\times 10^{-3}2.4 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. We found that the uncertainty about the deep methane abundance has a negligible effect on the determination of the homopause height. On the other hand, we found significant variations in the inverted temperatures. Inside and outside the auroral oval, we found uncertainties of 1.5 K at both 1-mbar and 20-mbar pressure levels. Within the auroral region, the errors at the 0.01 mbar pressure level are larger, increasing up to 3 K.\n\nFor hydrocarbons, the main uncertainties in their vertical abundance profile result from the uncertainties in the temperature profile itself.\n\nWe also propagated the uncertainties on the telescope pointing into our retrievals. Since our observations are close to the limb of the planet, a small pointing error could strongly affect the calculated incidence and emission angles. To do so, we have performed several inversions by slightly varying the pointing specified in the metadata of the observations. We shifted the pointing, which is translated mainly in a change in latitude (of maximum ±plus-or-minus\\pm± 2∘ at 70∘S), and subsequently on the emission and incidence angles of each spaxel with respect to the unaltered scenario. Nevertheless, the features observed after the inversion (see Section 4.2) were the same in the two changed tests and in the unaltered spatial registration scenario in terms of spatial distribution. The largest change was located close to the limb, as the emission angle and latitude change rapidly due to the geometry of our observation. This test was performed to ensure that the features that will be shown in the following section are not related to incorrect spatial registration, but to robust atmospheric changes retrieved by our radiative transfer model.\n\n4 Results\n\n4.1 Retrieval of the homopause height\n\nIn this section, we present our indirect determination of the homopause pressure level through the CH4 VMR profile, by analyzing the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band of methane based on the procedure detailed in Sect. 3.2. Before presenting the results, we note some limitations that affect our determination of the homopause altitude from the CH4 VMR profile.\n\nFirst, Fig. 10 illustrates the χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT values obtained in the retrieval of the temperature as a function of the 13 homopause pressure levels for four specific spectra. These individual spectra represent observations within or near the auroral oval, as well as those taken at quiescent latitudes equatorward of 65∘S. This figure shows that a well-defined χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT minimum is achieved for spectra within or near the auroral oval, allowing a robust determination of the CH4 profile and, in consequence, of the homopause height in this region. However, at latitudes equatorward of 65∘S, the χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT lacks of a clear minimum, allowing us to establish only an upper limit of the homopause level, at a pressure of 0.3 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar or greater for the majority of the spectra (corresponding to model ##\\##8). This upper limit is presented on the homopause height map in Fig. 11 and was used for the temperature inversion in Sect. 4.2. The reverse situation is encountered in a small specific area of the cube centered at 140∘W. Within a filament that extends meridionally from 130∘W to 155∘W, and centered at 74∘S, the χ2superscript𝜒2\\chi^{2}italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT as a function of the homopause height also lacks of a clear minimum, but this time it allows us to establish only a lower limit of the homopause level (see the upper right panel of Fig. 10 for the spectra at 74∘S and 130∘W). The lower limit within this filament, ∼similar-to\\sim∼420 km (∼similar-to\\sim∼60 nbar), actually corresponds to the determined homopause height in the surrounding area. Assuming this lower limit as the homopause height also yields a consistent temperature inversion with the surrounding area. In contrast, assuming a higher homopause level would produce a cold filament embedded within a warmer surrounding environment at the 1-mbar pressure level.\n\nFurthermore, within the region spanning from 70∘S to 75∘S and 90∘W to 100∘W, two of our observations overlap and our analysis presents inconsistent homopause pressure levels. We tend to favor the higher homopause results derived from the cube centered at 70∘W due to its lower emission angles compared to those obtained from the cube centered at 135∘W. This preference is based on a more favorable nadir geometry, typically providing a more accurate estimation of the optical path length.\n\nFigure 11 presents the homopause pressure levels retrieved for our three Jupiter regions, displayed in polar projection. The statistical position of the auroral oval is depicted by the black line for the day of our observations (December 24, 2022). The figure reveals a clear feature, showing that the homopause height rises southward at polar latitudes. The rise is the largest within the oval, where the homopause is found located at pressure levels as high as ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 0.4 – 4 nbar (625−17.5+2.5subscriptsuperscript6252.517.5625^{+2.5}_{-17.5}625 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 2.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 17.5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT – 590−56+17.5subscriptsuperscript59017.556590^{+17.5}_{-56}590 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 17.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 56 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km), but it is also present at high pressure levels (∼similar-to\\sim∼67 nbar or ∼similar-to\\sim∼410 km), outside the oval, e.g., southwards 70∘S. Inspection of the variation of the homopause pressure level along the 70∘S parallel clearly reveals this feature. Its lowest level of ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 91 nbar (378−13+16subscriptsuperscript3781613378^{+16}_{-13}378 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 16 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 13 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km) is found at 150∘W, then it gradually increases to ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 0.4 nbar (625−17.5+2.5subscriptsuperscript6252.517.5625^{+2.5}_{-17.5}625 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 2.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 17.5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km) at 70∘W, remaining around in the ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 0.4 – 4 nbar range while inside the oval, and finally dropping to the ∼similar-to\\sim∼50 nbar (410−16+34subscriptsuperscript4103416410^{+34}_{-16}410 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 34 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 16 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km) pressure level between 0∘ and 315∘W.\n\nThis behavior is also evident in the homopause altitude meridional gradient. The homopause is located at the highest altitudes at 70∘W, where the auroral oval reaches its lowest latitude. In comparison, at 135∘W and 300∘W, the homopause height drops more smoothly from high altitude within the oval to low altitude at quiescent latitudes. Equatorwards of 65∘S, the atmosphere appears to be relatively unaffected by auroral precipitation, as the homopause pressure level exhibits a relatively homogeneous altitude both zonally and meridionally. Variations of the homopause level may still exist at these latitudes, but our analysis can only constrain an upper limit of the homopause altitude in those regions.\n\nOur results constitute the first spatially-resolved measurement of the homopause altitude in the SPR with enough information within the Southern Auroral Oval. Therefore, we can compare our retrievals only with studies that targeted the NPR. Our results in the SPR are qualitatively consistent with the study of Sinclair et al. (2020) who reported that the homopause in the Northern Auroral Oval lies at higher altitude than at mid-northern latitudes. These authors also reported that the contrast in homopause altitude between inside and outside the auroral oval decreased with increasing latitude. Thanks to the JWST angular resolution, such a trend is evident in our SPR map. Quantitatively, Sinclair et al. (2020) measured a homopause height located at 461−39+147subscriptsuperscript46114739461^{+147}_{-39}461 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 147 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 39 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km inside the Northern Auroral Oval, while our measurements yield a homopause located at ∼similar-to\\sim∼590−56+17.5subscriptsuperscript59017.556590^{+17.5}_{-56}590 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 17.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 56 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT within the Southern Auroral Oval.\n\n4.2 Temperature analysis\n\nIn this section, we present the results of the temperature structure analysis determined from our dataset. As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, the CH4 ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band cannot be used to retrieve the thermal structure of the upper stratosphere due to its low sensitivity to high altitudes. Subsequently, it is not possible to retrieve the homopause height using this band. Hence, the results presented here were obtained by inverting the CH4 ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band alone, using the corresponding CH4 profile selected in 4.1.\n\nFigure 12 presents the retrieved temperature for the three tiles of our mosaic at four different pressure levels, 10 mbar, 1 mbar, 0.1 mbar and 0.01 mbar using the ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band. For each spaxel, the displayed temperature correspond to the inverted profile using the homopause pressure level displayed in Fig. 11. The four pressure levels were chosen to show the independent temperature measurements accessible within our sensitivity pressure range between 30 mbar and 0.01 mbar (Fig. 8).\n\nAt the 0.01-mbar pressure level, the temperature field displays a sharp polar warming southward of 70∘S, temperatures rising by an average of 37 ±plus-or-minus\\pm± 3 K from 175 K at 70∘S to 212 ±plus-or-minus\\pm± 3K at 80∘S. The warmest measured temperatures are located within the auroral oval at 78∘S and 350∘W, and the meridional temperature gradient also exists outside the auroral oval at 135∘W, albeit milder than within the oval. The gradient appears to decrease further eastward of 135∘W where the auroral oval retreats toward the pole, but unfortunately we lack a fourth tile around 225∘W to firmly assert this trend. We also note that the temperature field seems to be unaltered equatorward of 70∘S, the latitude corresponding to the equatormost extension of the auroral oval.\n\nAt the 1-mbar pressure level, the temperature field morphology is similar to that at the 0.01-mbar level, but with a lesser contrast, of about 12 ±plus-or-minus\\pm± 2 K between 75∘S and 65∘S. If the polar warming is stronger within the auroral oval, as it is at 0.01-mbar, it also affects longitudes to the west of the auroral oval. However, we note that the return to an undisturbed temperature field is found to occur at more equatorward regions than at 0.01-mbar level.\n\nAt 0.1-mbar, the situation is slightly different. The temperature field displays a mild (10 K) polar warming similar in its longitudinal profile at 1 mbar. But it also displays a strong warming outside the auroral oval, with the maximum measured temperature of 180 ±plus-or-minus\\pm± 2K located at 72∘S and 320∘W, around 7 K warmer than the mean temperature inside the auroral region.\n\nFurthermore, the temperature field at the 10-mbar pressure level is drastically different. At this level, it presents a polar vortex of cold temperatures (∼similar-to\\sim∼7 K colder) poleward of 65∘S.\n\nOur results present both similarities and differences with respect to previous investigations of the Jovian Polar Region. Consistent with the thermal fields measured both in the NPR and in the SPR by Sinclair et al. (2017, 2018, 2023-a), we find that:\n\n•\n\nThe largest warming occurs at the 0.01-mbar pressure level within the auroral oval. Our maximum measured temperature of 218±3plus-or-minus2183218\\pm 3218 ± 3 K is higher than the maximum temperature of 205±5plus-or-minus2055205\\pm 5205 ± 5 K measured by Sinclair et al. (2017) and the 185±5plus-or-minus1855185\\pm 5185 ± 5 K measured by Sinclair et al. (2018) in the NPR, and of 200±5plus-or-minus2005200\\pm 5200 ± 5 K and 175±5plus-or-minus1755175\\pm 5175 ± 5 K in the SPR. Our results are in better agreement with those of Sinclair et al. (2023-a), who measured a maximum of 210±5plus-or-minus2105210\\pm 5210 ± 5K for the SPR.\n\n•\n\nThe 1-mbar pressure level is the most aurorally affected level after the 0.01-mbar level, with the highest temperature still observed within the auroral oval. At this pressure level, we measure a maximum temperature of 178±2plus-or-minus1782178\\pm 2178 ± 2 K, which is similar to the 175±3plus-or-minus1753175\\pm 3175 ± 3 K retrieved by Sinclair et al. (2017) and 180±3plus-or-minus1803180\\pm 3180 ± 3 K observed by Sinclair et al. (2023-a), but warmer than the 166±3plus-or-minus1663166\\pm 3166 ± 3 K value measured by Sinclair et al. (2018).\n\n•\n\nWithin the auroral oval, the vertical temperature profile exhibits a minimum at 0.1 mbar, showing a weak contrast between inside and outside the auroral region in our study, as well as in Sinclair et al. (2017, 2018).\n\n•\n\nThe temperature field below the 2–3 mbar pressure level appears to be unaffected by auroral precipitation, showing a southward decrease, similar to that observed by Fletcher et al. (2016) and Bardet et al. (2022).\n\nRegarding the differences from the previous studies, we note that\n\n•\n\nWe measure a temperature enhancement at 1 mbar, at polar latitudes also outside the auroral oval, mostly to the west of the auroral oval. This warming was not observed by Sinclair et al. (2017) or Sinclair et al. (2018) in either the SPR or the NPR.\n\n•\n\nAt the 0.1-mbar pressure level (Fig. 12, bottom left), we observe a strong warming to the east of the auroral region, never witnessed by Sinclair et al. (2017) and Sinclair et al. (2018).\n\n•\n\nAt 10 mbar, the cold polar ring seen in our thermal map was not observed by Sinclair et al. (2017) and Sinclair et al. (2018) as they lacked spatial resolution to sample latitude southwards of 70∘S at pressure levels larger than 1 mbar.\n\n•\n\nWe also note that our inferred thermal structure differs significantly from the one retrieved during a solar wind compression event by Sinclair et al. (2023-a) for the SPR. In their study, the temperature increase within the auroral region was similar in the two hotspots at 1 and 0.01 mbar (∼21±5similar-toabsentplus-or-minus215\\sim 21\\pm 5∼ 21 ± 5 K). This is in contrast to our observation, where the auroral hotspot presents the highest temperature at 0.01-mbar. Furthermore, Sinclair et al. (2023-a) observed that compression also affected the structure of the temperature down to 10-mbar, while in our case the hotspot is only present at altitudes above the 5-mbar level.\n\n4.3 Hydrocarbons retrieval\n\nTo retrieve the ethane and acetylene volume mixing ratios, we have adopted the temperature structure and the homopause pressure based upon the CH4 ν4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT lines, as presented in the previous sections. For acetylene, we have analyzed the ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band centered at 730 cm-1 covered in channels 3A and 3B, but restricted to the 685 – 720 cm-1 spectral range (channel 3B). We chose this specific wavenumber range for several reasons. First, as mentioned in Section 2 the ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT Q-branch radiance is saturated around 730 cm-1. Second, we favored this short wavenumber range because it features the hot band ν5+ν4−ν4subscript𝜈5subscript𝜈4subscript𝜈4\\nu_{5}+\\nu_{4}-\\nu_{4}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that probes higher pressure levels than the ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band alone. We have also discarded wavenumbers close of 700 and 750 cm-1, where the spectral signature of stratospheric aerosols was reported by Guerlet et al. (2015) in Saturn’s polar stratosphere.\n\nTo retrieve the abundance of ethane, we have used the ν8subscript𝜈8\\nu_{8}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band in the spectral range from 1510 to 1535 cm-1, located in channel 1B next to the ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band of methane. The ν8subscript𝜈8\\nu_{8}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band extends further up to 1570 cm-1, but we have excluded this range to avoid possible interferences between the C2H6 and the CH4 ν2subscript𝜈2\\nu_{2}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT lines.\n\nThe spectral features used to infer C2H2 and C2H6 abundances are located in different MRS channels (channels 1 and 3) than those used to retrieve the temperature and the homopause height (channel 2). Since each MIRI-MRS channel has a unique FOV, slice width, and pixel size, we needed to remap our inferred temperature structure and homopause height to align with the angular coverage and sampling of channels 1 and 3. For channel 3, which extends to higher northern latitudes than channel 2 due to its larger FOV, we assumed a constant temperature field and homopause height north of the limit of channel 2. In the inversion process of each spaxel, we adopted as a priori C2H2 and C2H6 profiles the ones obtained using the Moses and Poppe (2017) photochemical model for our determined CH4 homopause height, as the location of the homopause also affects to the vertical profiles of other chemical species such as C2H2 and C2H6.\n\nFigure 13 shows the contribution functions in the respective spectral ranges for the two hydrocarbons, both inside and outside the auroral oval, i.e. for a high homopause and a low homopause altitude. The C2H2 contribution functions show that the acetylene bands analyzed provide information between 10 and 0.01 mbar, both inside and outside the auroral oval. In the case of C2H6, the information yielded by the ν8subscript𝜈8\\nu_{8}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band is concentrated between 10 and 1 mbar outside the auroral oval, while within the auroral oval, the sensitivity peak shifts slightly upwards, probing between the 10 and 0.1-mbar pressure levels. To account for the limited vertical sensitivity compared to the temperature sounding, we have adopted a different covariance matrix S (see Section 3.1) for the hydrocarbon inversion. While the smoothing factor was set to 0.75 scale heights for the temperature inversion, we have fixed it to 3 scale heights for the hydrocarbon inversion.\n\nFigure 14 shows the comparison between the observed zonal-mean spectrum and the best-fit synthetic spectrum for the two example spectra shown in Fig. 5, representing both inside the auroral oval (top row) and one outside the auroral oval (second row). The third row displays the a priori and inverted profiles for both inside and outside the auroral oval, while the bottom row presents the averaging kernels for the two regions. The left column shows results for C2H2, and the right column for C2H6. For C2H2, the averaging kernels show ∼similar-to\\sim∼2 degrees of freedom peaking at 7 and 0.1 mbar for all the spectra analyzed. On the other hand, for C2H6 we are able to retrieve its abundance peaking near 3 mbar for all the spectra, with ∼similar-to\\sim∼1 degree of freedom.\n\nFig. 15 displays the inverted abundance of ethane and acetylene for the three mosaic tiles in polar projection at 5 and 0.1 mbar for C2H2, and at 3 mbar for C2H6.\n\n4.3.1 C2H2\n\nThe two spectra displayed in Fig. 14 (left column) show that the difference in absolute radiance at the core of the emission lines is approximately 20 %percent\\%% higher inside compared to that outside the auroral oval (60∘S). Such a difference in line-to-continuum contrast cannot be explained just by the warmer auroral temperatures, but must also be the signature of an increase of the C2H2 abundance. This is demonstrated by the difference in the two inverted profiles displayed in the third row, left column panel of Fig. 14, where the profile inside the aurora (thick red line) is always larger than the profile outside the auroral region (thick blue line).\n\nAs already pointed out by Sinclair et al. (2018, 2019), we are unable to achieve a fully satisfactory fit of the acetylene lines. The emission in the core of the lines is underestimated by our model, especially within the auroral oval. Sinclair et al. (2018) suggests that this may be caused by non-LTE effects occurring in the upper atmosphere, as the cores are sensitive to higher altitudes. At these altitudes, non-LTE phenomena may occur, since the thermal collisional timescale can become longer than the spontaneous radiative lifetime of the ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band. Using the methods described in López-Puertas and Taylor (2001); Sánchez-López et al. (2022), we have estimated the deviation of the vibrational temperature from the kinetic temperature for the C2H2 ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band. We found that the excitation of ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT level by solar pumping, e.g. by absorption of solar radiation by the ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT+ν9subscript𝜈9\\nu_{9}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT band near 3 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μm, is negligible in comparison with the collisional excitation in the whole thermosphere. Further, we found that the vibrational temperature of the ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT level starts to deviate (becoming smaller than the kinetic temperature) at pressure levels around 0.5 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar and this depletion increases rapidly at higher pressure levels becoming about 100 K at 0.1 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar. Hence, assuming non-LTE would lead to, if any, a decrease of the LTE radiance rather than an enhancement. We then think that the inability to fit the measured spectrum may come from the uncertainty (an underestimation) of the temperature profile in the pressure range 0.1–1 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar. We note that even if the C2H2 ν5subscript𝜈5\\nu_{5}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT level is underpopulated with respect to LTE in that region, its non-LTE population still depends significantly on the kinetic temperature. This explanation seems plausible as auroral processes can drastically augment the thermospheric temperature and thus increase the radiance in the cores of the C2H2 lines. Another possible explanation of the differences between the synthetic and observed spectra was proposed by recent analysis of the MRS observations of Saturn. Fletcher et al. (2023) have shown that these differences could also be explained by a poor characterization of the spectral resolution for the complete wavenumber range of the MIRI-MRS instrument Jones et al. (2023).\n\nThe abundance map displayed in Fig. 15 extends over our entire spatial coverage, spanning the differences between the two representative spectra highlighted above. Globally, the meridional trend of acetylene shows a southward decrease in abundance at all pressure levels from a local maximum at 50∘S of latitude (VMR of (8±1)×10−9plus-or-minus81superscript109(8\\pm 1)\\times 10^{-9}( 8 ± 1 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 7 mbar and (3±0.5)×10−6plus-or-minus30.5superscript106(3\\pm 0.5)\\times 10^{-6}( 3 ± 0.5 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 0.1 mbar) to a local minimum around 60∘S (VMR of (5±0.35)×10−9plus-or-minus50.35superscript109(5\\pm 0.35)\\times 10^{-9}( 5 ± 0.35 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 7 mbar and (1±0.15)×10−6plus-or-minus10.15superscript106(1\\pm 0.15)\\times 10^{-6}( 1 ± 0.15 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 0.1 mbar). Beyond this, there is a subsequent rise in abundance by up to a factor of 5 at the southernmost latitudes covered by our observations (with a VMR of (2±0.45)×10−8plus-or-minus20.45superscript108(2\\pm 0.45)\\times 10^{-8}( 2 ± 0.45 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 7 mbar and (5±0.5)×10−6plus-or-minus50.5superscript106(5\\pm 0.5)\\times 10^{-6}( 5 ± 0.5 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at 0.1 mbar). At both pressure levels, the polar maximum is evident within the auroral oval and extends to the west of the auroral oval, specifically around 135∘W longitude, gradually diminishing at the westernmost edge of our observations. In particular, the most significant contrast between inside and outside the auroral oval is observed at the 7-mbar pressure level, where the abundance within the oval is twice as large as outside the oval.\n\n4.3.2 C2H6\n\nFigure 14 (right column) shows the comparison between the observed spectrum and the best-fitting synthetic spectrum for both inside the auroral region (top row) and outside the auroral region (second row). Similar to C2H2, there is an enhancement in C2H6 emission observed within the oval compared to outside. Taking the emission line at 1515 cm-1 as a reference, and disregarding the continuum variations due to limb darkening, the increase amounts to approximately a factor of 2.\n\nThe retrieved ethane abundance map at 3 mbar is displayed in the lower panel of Fig. 15. Unlike what we observed for C2H2, the C2H6 meridional trend is a monotonic increase in abundance as we approach the South Pole. Moreover, this increase is zonally uniform, and in particular there is no noticeable difference between regions inside and outside the oval at polar latitudes. Quantitatively, the VMR is found to increase by a factor of ∼similar-to\\sim∼7 from (7±1.5)×10−6plus-or-minus71.5superscript106(7\\pm 1.5)\\times 10^{-6}( 7 ± 1.5 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 60∘S to (4±0.6)×10−5plus-or-minus40.6superscript105(4\\pm 0.6)\\times 10^{-5}( 4 ± 0.6 ) × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT at ∼similar-to\\sim∼ 75∘S.\n\n5 Discussion of the results\n\n5.1 Homopause\n\nIn our analysis and radiative transfer code, we assumed LTE emission at all pressure levels. However, it is known that LTE breaks down at higher altitudes, where density decreases. A study by Sánchez-López et al. (2022) on CH4 ν3subscript𝜈3\\nu_{3}italic_ν start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT non-LTE emission reveals that the vibrational temperature of various CH4 vibrational levels begins to deviate from the kinetic temperature at pressure levels around 0.1 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar. This deviation becomes substantial at pressures lower than 50 nbar. As illustrated in Fig. 7, a significant portion of the emission occurs at levels beneath or near the pressure levels where the LTE assumption becomes invalid. Hence, we argue that our results are minimally affected by the LTE assumption due to the predominance of emission occurring beneath or close to pressure levels where LTE breaks down. We also note that a higher homopause level than that assumed by Sánchez-López et al. (2022) will rise the altitude at which LTE breaks up, since self-absorption tends to maintain LTE conditions.\n\nWhile our LTE assumption may introduce uncertainties in the absolute values of our inferred homopause level, it does not compromise the relative variations of the inferred homopause level. A larger CH4 abundance at high altitude always results in higher opacity and more intense emission in the core of the CH4 Q-branch. Some of our inferred homopause levels lie above the level where LTE breaks up. These homopause levels correspond to CH4 abundances at pressure levels where the emission is in LTE, consistent with CH4 vertical profiles for which the homopause level lies above the LTE break-up level.\n\nAt latitudes equatorward of 65∘S, i.e. away from the auroral oval, we could only establish an upper limit for the homopause height of 352−3+13subscriptsuperscript352133352^{+13}_{-3}352 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km. These results are similar to those found by Sinclair et al. (2020). For similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere, Sinclair et al. (2020) also determined an upper limit of the homopause height (see their Fig. 10), of 378−13+16subscriptsuperscript3781613378^{+16}_{-13}378 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 16 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 13 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km. The consistency between our upper limit in the southern hemisphere, with that determined by Sinclair et al. (2020) in the northern hemisphere suggests that, equatorward of 60∘N and 60∘S, the homopause height upper limit does not vary significantly with latitude across the planet’s disk. Our upper limit is also consistent with the homopause altitude derived from stellar occultation observed by the Alice instrument onboard the New Horizons spacecraft, in the ultraviolet range. From this data set, Greathouse et al. (2010) deduced a homopause altitude of 310 and 340 km at the ingress (32∘N) and egress (18∘N) points, respectively.\n\nAs we approach the South Pole, we observe an increase of the homopause height between latitudes 65∘S and 70∘S: southwards of 70∘S, the homopause altitude is higher than 410−16+34subscriptsuperscript4103416410^{+34}_{-16}410 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + 34 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 16 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km at all longitudes. This is also similar with the results of Sinclair et al. (2020), who also measured a higher homopause in non-auroral north polar regions than at mid-latitudes, but located at lower altitudes (378 −13+16subscriptsuperscriptabsent1613{}^{+16}_{-13}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + 16 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 13 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km) than in our results. Moreover, as Sinclair et al. (2020) found for the NPR, we find that the homopause height in the SPR reaches its maximum within the auroral oval. The inferred homopause altitude in the South Auroral Oval is higher than in the Northern counterpart; we derived a value of 590 −56+17.5subscriptsuperscriptabsent17.556{}^{+17.5}_{-56}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + 17.5 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 56 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km within the oval, with a maximum of 625 −17.5+2.5subscriptsuperscriptabsent2.517.5{}^{+2.5}_{-17.5}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + 2.5 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 17.5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km, both larger than the altitude of 478 −34+56subscriptsuperscriptabsent5634{}^{+56}_{-34}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + 56 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 34 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT km derived by Sinclair et al. (2020) for the North Auroral Oval.\n\nWe note that our measurements of the homopause altitude within the auroral region for the North and South poles overlap within the error bars. A possible explanation for these distinct homopause altitudes may lie in the different shape and size of the two auroral ovals. The ratio between the North Auroral Oval and the South Auroral Oval areas is approximately 1.84. If the total precipitating energy integrated over the two regions is similar, this surface difference may result in a higher density of precipitating energy in the SPR compared to that in the NPR, leading to stronger atmospheric perturbations. However, the topology and amplitude of the magnetic field are asymmetrical between the north and south; hence the energy input by particle precipitation is not strictly identical for both polar regions. It also becomes difficult to measure the average precipitating energy, since it is a process strongly variable in time at different temporal scales.\n\nOur dataset hence demonstrates that the upward shift of the homopause altitude previously found for the Northern Auroral Oval also occurs in the Southern Auroral Oval, clearly linking this upward shift to auroral activity. However, our dataset does not allow us to disentangle the mechanisms postulated to cause this upward shift: enhancement in the eddy diffusion, or vertical advection Sinclair et al. (2020). Within the auroral ovals, vertical advection speeds of up to 10 m s-1 have been predicted in the 1–0.01 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar pressure range by 3D thermospheric circulation models Yates et al. (2020). With such speeds, the homopause altitude could vary by hundreds of kilometers on timescales comparable to a Jovian day. In contrast, we note that the diffusion timescale τ=H2K𝜏superscript𝐻2𝐾\\tau=\\frac{H^{2}}{K}italic_τ = divide start_ARG italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_K end_ARG for the typical CH4 molecular coefficient of 2×1072superscript1072\\times 10^{7}2 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm s-2 at 0.1 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar Moses et al. (2005) is longer than a Jovian day: τ∼106similar-to𝜏superscript106\\tau\\sim 10^{6}italic_τ ∼ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT s for a scale height of 45 km. If the predicted vertical speed actually takes place in the upper Jovian atmosphere, vertical transport seems a more efficient mechanism than turbulence to raise the homopause level.\n\nThe strong temporal variation of auroral and precipitation processes may offer an alternative explanation for the discrepancies between the Southern Auroral Oval and the Northern Auroral Oval measurements obtained by Sinclair et al. (2020). In response to this variability, the homopause altitude could dynamically adjust over time, and the respective measurements may represent instantaneous snapshots of the homopause level. Such a variability in the homopause level is also compatible with the advection and diffusion timescales, of the order of 3×1043superscript1043\\times 10^{4}3 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and 106superscript10610^{6}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT s, respectively. Depending on the dominant process, the homopause level could adjust rapidly, i.e. within a few Jovian days, in response to changes in energy input. It is worth noting that our observations did not coincide with a compression event in the Jovian magnetosphere (see supplementary material), phenomena known to intensify auroral precipitation Sinclair et al. (2023-a). However, energy enhancement can also arise from internal processes within the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\nAt polar latitudes, but outside the auroral oval, we observed an elevation in the homopause level compared to quiescent latitudes. This increase could be attributed to auroral precipitation occurring outside the main auroral oval, or to the horizontal diffusion of auroral energy and associated disturbances (such as enhanced hydrocarbons) from the main oval.\n\nBright patches of far-ultraviolet (FUV) emissions are observed very regularly equatorward of the main auroral emission, often appearing in clusters, and are linked to injections of hot plasma moving inward within the Jovian magnetosphere Nichols et al. (2023). Strong particle precipitations also occur at the moons’ footprints equatorward of the main oval. The main auroral emission is most of the time brighter than the diffuse equatorward emission, reflecting higher energy input, but the latter covers a much larger area than the former. Moreover, the more intense electron precipitation do not coincide with the highest energy fluxes Gérard et al. (2014). In the Juno UVS observations of Jupiter’s auroral emissions, the diffuse emission can extend up to 70∘S, or even 65∘S Greathouse et al. (2021) in the SPR. These latitudes correspond nicely with the latitudes at which we observed the transition between the unperturbed homopause level that prevails at mid-latitudes, and the perturbed homopause level in the polar region. In this interpretation, the smaller elevation outside the main oval would reflect the lower-energy precipitation occurring there.\n\nTo assess whether the elevated homopause outside the main oval could be due to horizontal diffusion, we compare the timescale of lateral transport with the timescale of CH4 profile vertical relaxation. We quantified the horizontal eddy diffusion coefficient (Ky⁢ysubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦K_{yy}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) consistent with the vertical diffusion coefficient (Kz⁢zsubscript𝐾𝑧𝑧K_{zz}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) for each model. We assumed the Eddy diffusion timescale to be τk=H2Kz⁢zsubscript𝜏𝑘superscript𝐻2subscript𝐾𝑧𝑧\\tau_{k}=\\frac{H^{2}}{K_{zz}}italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = divide start_ARG italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG, and that it would be similar for horizontal eddy diffusion. We estimated Ky⁢ysubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦K_{yy}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for a characteristic length L between (distance from a region (75∘S, 90∘W) inside the auroral oval to a region outside the oval, but with a higher homopause (75∘S, 135∘W), of around 14000 km) using Ky⁢y=L2τksubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦superscript𝐿2subscript𝜏𝑘K_{yy}=\\frac{L^{2}}{\\tau_{k}}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = divide start_ARG italic_L start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG. We obtain values for Ky⁢ysubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦K_{yy}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ranging between 3×10123superscript10123\\times 10^{12}3 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and 1×10141superscript10141\\times 10^{14}1 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm2 s-1 for homopause locations between 26 and 0.5 nbar. These values are much smaller than the values obtained by Lellouch et al. (2006) and Griffith et al. (2004) by fitting the meridional spread of the SL9 impact debris: ∼similar-to\\sim∼3×1011absentsuperscript1011\\times 10^{11}× 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm2 s-1 at 0.1 mbar. It remains uncertain how this horizontal eddy coefficient Ky⁢ysubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦K_{yy}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT scales with pressure. Hue et al. (2018) proposed several vertical scalings, from constant with pressure to proportional to the vertical variations of Kz⁢zsubscript𝐾𝑧𝑧K_{zz}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Assuming the Ky⁢ysubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦K_{yy}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT at 0.1 mbar derived from post-SL9 species, combined with a vertical scaling following the one from Kz⁢zsubscript𝐾𝑧𝑧K_{zz}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, it would lead to a Ky⁢ysubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦K_{yy}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT coefficient of ∼similar-to\\sim∼2×1013absentsuperscript1013\\times 10^{13}× 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm2 s-1 at 0.1 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar, reading the Ky⁢ysubscript𝐾𝑦𝑦K_{yy}italic_K start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT value at 0.1 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μbar on Fig. 7 of Hue et al. (2018) (\"Lellouch 1\" curve). This value would be sufficient to explain the horizontal spreading of the CH4. However, Hue et al. (2018) could not find which vertical scaling fits better the meridional trend of hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the presence of strong stratospheric jets at ∼similar-to\\sim∼0.1-mbar observed by Cavalié et al. (2021) may strongly hinder meridional mixing in the polar regions compared to the open stratosphere over the mid-latitudes probed by the dispersion of debris from SL9 impact. Therefore, it is difficult to draw any conclusions with regard to the actual physical process leading to the rise of the homopause outside the auroral region.\n\nThis elevated homopause may also help explain an apparent contradiction in observations of Jupiter’s ’swirl’ aurora. In the X-ray, the highest energy precipitation occurs on the dusk flank of the polar cap, with almost no emission within the ‘swirl’ region on the dawn side of the polar cap Dunn et al. (2020). Similarly, regions with the most energetic precipitation are typically relatively weak in H3+ emission, as these particles penetrate well below the homopause; notably the ’swirl’ region is relatively brightly observed in H3+ emission compared with UV emission, suggesting weaker precipitation flux Stallard et al. (2016). However, in the UV, the swirl region has very high color ratios, showing strong hydrocarbon absorption, which are typically aligned with highly energetic and deeply penetrating precipitation (>400absent400>400> 400 KeV; Gérard et al. (2014)). Here, we have shown that the homopause increases strongly in altitude in this polar region. This potentially allows much lower energy particle precipitation to penetrate into the elevated hydrocarbon layer, without necessarily driving significant ion production. Maps of C2H2 reflectance also appear to show the strongest enhancement in production in the dusk side, away from the ’swirl’ region Giles et al. (2023), suggesting the ’swirl’ region may not be a significant source of deeply penetrating high energy precipitation, and may instead be dominated by relatively low energy precipitation that is spectrally affected by the inflated atmosphere in this region.\n\nFurthermore, a study of the CH4 fluorescence at 3030 cm-1 in the auroral region with JUNO-JIRAM data indicates that, although the homopause appears to be elevated in the auroral region, the increase in radiance may also be explained by higher temperatures in the nbar region Castagnoli et al. (2022). This correlation between localized homopause at high pressure levels with high temperatures in the upper atmosphere would indicate that in the auroral oval, the temperature could also be higher above 1 μ⁢b⁢a⁢r𝜇𝑏𝑎𝑟\\mu baritalic_μ italic_b italic_a italic_r.\n\n5.2 Thermal structure\n\nIn the Southern Auroral Oval hotspot located at 0.01 mbar (see Fig. 12), we retrieve atmospheric temperatures approximately 15 K ±plus-or-minus\\pm± 4 K warmer than those retrieved in the Northern Auroral Oval by Sinclair et al. (2018). This increased auroral warming in the south is consistent with our hypothesis that the auroral energy density is larger in the SPR than in the NPR, proposed to explain the discrepancies between the homopause level in both regions. In addition, our observations were taken during a low solar wind activity period on Jupiter (see supplementary materials), meaning that the persistence of this warmer Southern Auroral Oval hotspot could be permanent, due to the smaller size of the Southern Auroral Oval compared to its northern counterpart. We also note that the JWST PSF at 7.7 μ𝜇\\muitalic_μm is smaller than that of the IRTF, used by Sinclair et al. (2018), in good seeing conditions: 0.25\" against 0.5\" at best. The dilution of the hotspot in the IRTF PSF could result in an underestimation of the actual temperature. At the 1-mbar pressure level, our temperature values are similar to those measured by Sinclair et al. (2023-a) in the Southern Auroral Oval, with a difference of 12±limit-from12plus-or-minus12\\pm12 ± 2K with respect to non-auroral regions. Moreover, the auroral warming we measure in the Southern Auroral Oval is quite similar to that inferred in the Northern Auroral Oval by Sinclair et al. (2017) and Sinclair et al. (2018).\n\nIn between these two auroral warmings, we find a milder thermal contrast at the 0.1-mbar pressure between inside and outside the auroral regions. This is in line with findings from previous studies Sinclair et al. (2018). We observe this milder contrast in the inverted profiles using the two a priori profiles (the hot and cold profiles) but we caution the reader that our spectra lack sensitivity at 0.1 mbar. This limitation is depicted in Fig. 8, where the averaging kernels exhibit weaker sensitivity at the 0.1-mbar level compared to the 0.01 and 1-mbar. Hence, we cannot confidently establish whether the auroral hotspots are actually separated by a colder layer or if our inverted temperature profile is relaxing to its a priori state.\n\nConsistent with the interpretation of Sinclair et al. (2017), we suggest that the pronounced warming at 0.01 mbar is the result of the auroral processes themselves. About the 1-mbar warming, Sinclair et al. (2017) consider it unlikely that it could be attributed to deep auroral precipitation or deep Joule heating, or alternatively to the conduction of auroral-induced warming from upper layers. They rather favored two other possibilities: i) warming by net radiative forcing of auroral-produced aerosols, or ii) adiabatic heating resulting from auroral-driven downwelling. We tend to prefer the latter, dynamical explanation. Indeed, Guerlet et al. (2020), using a radiative-equilibrium model of Jupiter’s atmosphere, showed that the net radiative heating induced by polar aerosols was located in the lower stratosphere (10–30 mbar) and more zonally extended than the observations of a warming mostly restricted to regions inside the ovals. This situation is also observed from the analysis of near-infrared observations by Zhang et al. (2013) that found that the large stratospheric aerosols reside in the 10–20 mbar pressure range at latitudes higher than 60∘S. Guerlet et al. (2020) also noted that the current uncertainties on the aerosol shape, structure, and spectrometric parameters make a broad range of temperature profiles possible, from hardly any warming to a very strong, 40-K, warming. More recently, Sinclair et al. (2023-b) also ruled out this hypothesis, as they found that the temperature at 1 mbar did not change according to the seasonally-changing solar insolation due to Jupiter’s ∼similar-to\\sim∼3∘ axial tilt. Furthermore, images in several spectral ranges, from the UV to the near-infrared Barrado-Izagirre et al. (2008), reveal a haze layer more zonally and latitudinally extended than the auroral ovals themselves (see Fig. 1, filters F164N, 212N and 360M from Hueso et al. (2023)). If the warming at 1 mbar were caused by aerosol forcing, it would be more zonally and latitudinally extended than obser"
