        "meta_description": "Abstract. Cloud feedbacks associated with deep convective anvils remain highly uncertain. In part, this uncertainty arises from a lack of understanding of how microphysical processes influence the cloud radiative effect. In particular, climate models have a poor representation of microphysics processes, thereby encouraging the collection and study of observation data to enable better representation of these processes in models. As such, the Deep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX) undertook an in situ aircraft and ground-based measurement campaign of New Mexico deep convective clouds during JulyâAugust 2022. The campaign coordinated a broad range of instrumentation measuring aerosol, cloud physics, radar, thermodynamics, dynamics, electric fields, and weather. This paper introduces the potential data user to DCMEX observational campaign characteristics, relevant instrument details, and references to more detailed instrument descriptions. Also included is information on the structure and important files in the dataset in order to aid the accessibility of the dataset to new users. Our overview of the campaign cases illustrates the complementary operational observations available and demonstrates the breadth of the campaign cases observed. During the campaign, a wide selection of environmental conditions occurred, ranging from dry, northerly air masses with low wind shear to moist, southerly air masses with high wind shear. This provided a wide range of different convective growth situations. Of 19 flight days, only 2âd lacked the formation of convective cloud. The dataset presented (https://doi.org/10.5285/B1211AD185E24B488D41DD98F957506C; Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements etÂ al.,Â 2024) will help establish a new understanding of processes on the smallest cloud- and aerosol-particle scales and, once combined with operational satellite observations and modelling, can support efforts to reduce the uncertainty of anvil cloud radiative impacts on climate scales.",

L. Finney, R. M. Doherty, O. Wild, and N. L. Abraham\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 7507–7522, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7507-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7507-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLightning is a source of nitric oxide (NO) and, through chemical reactions of NO, impacts ozone production. A new method for modelling global lightning markedly alters ozone concentration in the upper troposphere and frequency characteristics of ozone production compared to earlier treatments. Simulated lightning and ozone concentrations now better match observations. Reducing uncertainties associated with lightning NO is important for understanding atmospheric composition and radiative forcing.\n\nUsing cloud ice flux to parametrise large-scale lightning\n\nD. L. Finney, R. M. Doherty, O. Wild, H. Huntrieser, H. C. Pumphrey, and A. M. Blyth\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 12665–12682, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-12665-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-12665-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLightning is important in atmospheric chemistry models as a source of nitrogen oxides which affect the greenhouse gases ozone and methane. We present a new approach to modelling lightning using the upward movement of ice in clouds, an essential part of the charging mechanism in thunderstorms. The new approach performs well compared to those already in use and provides a novel, physically based scheme that has the potential to improve the robustness of simulated flash rates and emissions.\n\nInternational airport emissions and their impact on local air quality: chemical speciation of ambient aerosols at MadridâBarajas Airport during the AVIATOR campaign\n\nSaleh Alzahrani, DoÄuÅhan KÄ±lÄ±Ã§, Michael Flynn, Paul I.

The study provides detailed insights into the chemical composition of aerosols and key pollutants in the airport environment. Source apportionment analysis using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) identified three significant sources: less oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol, alkane organic aerosol, and more oxidised oxygenated organic aerosol.\n\nOverview: quasi-Lagrangian observations of Arctic air mass transformations â introduction and initial results of the HALOâ(ð ð)3 aircraft campaign\n\nManfred Wendisch, Susanne Crewell, AndrÃ© Ehrlich, Andreas Herber, Benjamin Kirbus, Christof LÃ¼pkes, Mario Mech, Steven J.

Warm-air intrusions (WAIs) into the Arctic may play an important role in explaining this phenomenon. Cold-air outbreaks (CAOs) out of the Arctic may link the Arctic climate changes to mid-latitude weather. In our article, we describe how to observe air mass transformations during CAOs and WAIs using three research aircraft instrumented with state-of-the-art remote-sensing and in situ measurement devices.\n\nExploring the processes controlling secondary inorganic aerosol: Evaluating the global GEOS-Chem simulation using a suite of aircraft campaigns\n\nOlivia G.

None of the loss and production pathways explored can explain the nitrate bias alone. The model’s inability to capture the variability in the observations remains and requires future investigation to avoid biases in policy-related studies (i.e., air quality, health, climate impacts of these aerosols).\n\nDetermination of the Atmospheric Volatility of Pesticides using Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry\n\nOlivia Mae Jackson, Aristeidis Voliotis, Thomas J.

O'Meara, Gordon McFiggans, Dave Johnson, and Hugh Coe\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2380,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2380, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper details a method of measuring volatility of pesticides using chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS) to calculate vapour pressure. This was then compared to current literature values and commonly used models. The exact nature of the literature values often remain uncertain due to being hidden in industrial reports. The results show that the method used primarily matches current literature values and any difference can be explained by method differences either in the methodology.\n\nImpact of host climate model on contrail cirrus effective radiative forcing estimates\n\nWeiyu Zhang, Kwinten Van Weverberg, Cyril J. Morcrette, Wuhu Feng, Kalli Furtado, Paul R. Field, Chih-Chieh Chen, Andrew Gettelman, Piers M. Forster, Daniel R. Marsh, and Alexandru Rap\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1573,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1573, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContrail cirrus is the largest, but also most uncertain contribution of aviation to global warming. We evaluate for the first time the impact of the host climate model on contrail cirrus properties. Substantial differences exist between contrail cirrus formation, persistence, and radiative effects in the host climate models. Reliable contrail cirrus simulations require advanced representation of cloud optical properties and microphysics, which should be better constrained by observations.\n\nLong-term evaluation of commercial air quality sensors: an overview from the QUANT (Quantification of Utility of Atmospheric Network Technologies) study\n\nSebastian Diez, Stuart Lacy, Hugh Coe, Josefina Urquiza, Max Priestman, Michael Flynn, Nicholas Marsden, Nicholas A.

The objective was to evaluate the performance of a range of commercial products and also to nourish the different applications in which these technologies can offer relevant information.\n\nPerformance Evaluation of Atmotube Pro sensors for Air Quality Measurements\n\nAishah Shittu, Kirsty Pringle, Stephen Arnold, Richard Pope, Ailish Graham, Carly Reddington, Richard Rigby, and James McQuaid\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1685,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1685, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Measurement Techniques (AMT).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study highlighted the importance of data cleaning in improving the raw Atmotube Pro PM2.5 data. The data cleaning method was successful in improving the inter-sensor variability among the Atmotube Pro sensors data. This study showed 62.5 % of the sensors used for the study exhibited greater precision in their measurements. The overall performance showed the sensors passed the base testing recommended by USEPA using one-hour averaged data.\n\nGaps in our understanding of ice-nucleating particle sources exposed by global simulation of the UK climate model\n\nRoss J.

However, in many weather and climate models cloud ice is not linked to aerosol that are known to nucleate ice. Here we report the first steps towards representing ice-nucleating particles within the UK's Earth System Model. We conclude that in addition to ice nucleation by sea spray and mineral components of soil dust we also need to represent ice nucleation by the organic components of soils.\n\nAtmospheric ice-nucleating particles in the eastern Mediterranean and the contribution of mineral and biological aerosol\n\nMark D. Tarn, Bethany V. Wyld, Naama Reicher, Matan Alayof, Daniella Gat, Alberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Sebastien N. F. Sikora, Alexander D. Harrison, Yinon Rudich, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAerosol Research, 2, 161–182, https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-161-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-161-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations were measured in Israel, which experiences air masses from a variety of sources. We found that the INP activity is typically dominated by K-feldspar mineral dust but that air masses passing over regions of fertile soils correlated with high INP concentrations and indicators of biological activity. This suggests that these fertile regions could be sporadic sources of warm-temperature biogenic INPs and warrants further study of these areas.\n\nHigh ice-nucleating particle concentrations associated with Arctic haze in springtime cold-air outbreaks\n\nErin N. Raif, Sarah L. Barr, Mark D. Tarn, James B. McQuaid, Martin I. Daily, Steven J. Abel, Paul A. Barrett, Keith N. Bower, Paul R. Field, Kenneth S. Carslaw, and Benjamin J.

We measured INP concentrations over the Norwegian and Barents seas in weather events where cold air is ejected from the Arctic. These concentrations were among the highest measured in the Arctic and it is likely that the INPs were transported to the Arctic from distant regions. These results show it is important to consider hemispheric-scale INP processes to understand INP concentrations in the Arctic.\n\nThe evolution of warm rain in trade-wind cumulus during EUREC4A\n\nGary Lloyd, Alan Blyth, Zhiqiang Cui, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Martin Gallagher, Michael Flynn, Nicholas Marsden, Leif Denby, and Peter Gallimore\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-142,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-142, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClouds that develop in the tropical trade-wind regions are extensive and persistent in nature. They are important for understanding how the magnitude of warming by these cloud systems might change in a warming climate. This paper describes measurements of common cloud types in these regions (shallow cumulus clouds) and the way in which they produce rainfall. During different periods, with different amounts of particulate in the air, the characteristics of the clouds were very different.\n\nFOREWARNS: development and multifaceted verification of enhanced regional-scale surface water flood forecasts\n\nBen Maybee, Cathryn E.

We detail outcomes from a workshop held with UK forecast users, who indicated they valued the forecasts and would use them to complement national guidance. We use results of objective forecast tests against flood observations over northern England to show that this confidence is justified and that FOREWARNS meets the needs of UK flood responders.\n\nIce-nucleating particles active below -24 °C in a Finnish boreal forest and their relationship to bioaerosols\n\nFranziska Vogel, Michael P.

We present 2 months INP measurements in a Finnish boreal forest using a new semi-autonomous INP counting device based on gas expansion. These results show strong variability in INP concentrations, and we present a case that the INP we observe are, at least some of the time, of biological origin.\n\nMeasurement report: The Fifth International Workshop on Ice Nucleation Phase 1 (FIN-01): Intercomparison of Single Particle Mass Spectrometers\n\nXiaoli Shen, David M.

Intercomparison of SPMSs was conducted. All instruments reported similar size ranges and common spectral features. The instrument-specific detection efficiency was found to be more dependent on particle size than type. All instruments differentiated secondary organic aerosol, soot, and soil dust, but had difficulties differentiating among specific minerals and dusts.\n\nThe Co-benefits of a Low-Carbon Future on Air Quality in Europe\n\nConnor J.

We use a model that allows us to see where the improvements are greatest (Central Europe) and analyse what sectors are most important for achieving these co-benefits (agriculture/power).\n\nThe Puy de DÃ´me ICe Nucleation Intercomparison Campaign (PICNIC): comparison between online and offline methods in ambient air\n\nLarissa Lacher, Michael P.

Here we compare three cloud chambers and seven methods for collecting aerosol particles on filters for offline analysis at a mountaintop station. A general good agreement of the methods was found when sampling aerosol particles behind a whole air inlet, supporting their use for obtaining data that can be implemented in models.\n\nJet aircraft lubrication oil droplets as contrail ice-forming particles\n\nJoel Ponsonby, Leon King, Benjamin J.

For the first time, we experimentally investigate the freezing behaviour of water droplets formed on jet lubrication oil aerosol. We show that they can activate to form water droplets and discuss their potential impact on contrail formation. Our study has implications for contrails produced by future aircraft engine and fuel technologies.\n\nData supporting the North Atlantic Climate System: Integrated Studies (ACSIS) programme, including atmospheric composition, oceanographic and sea ice observations (2016–2022) and output from ocean, atmosphere, land and sea-ice models (1950–2050)\n\nAlexander T.

During a campaign in the boreal forest in Finland, substantial concentrations of biological ice nucleating particles were observed, despite many of their potential biological sources being snow covered. We sampled lichen in this location and tested its ice nculeation ability in the laboratory. We find that indeed the lichen harbours INPs, which may be important in such snow covered environments.\n\nBiomass-burning smoke's properties and its interactions with marine stratocumulus clouds in WRF-CAM5 and southeastern Atlantic field campaigns\n\nCalvin Howes, Pablo E.

The model transports and mixes smoke well but does not fully capture some important processes. These include smoke chemical and physical aging over 4–12 days, smoke removal by rain, sulfate particle formation, aerosol activation into cloud droplets, and boundary layer turbulence.\n\nAircraft ice-nucleating particle and aerosol composition measurements in the western North American Arctic\n\nAlberto Sanchez-Marroquin, Sarah L. Barr, Ian T. Burke, James B. McQuaid, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13819–13834, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13819-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13819-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe sources and concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the Arctic are still poorly understood. Here we report aircraft-based INP concentrations and aerosol composition in the western North American Arctic. The concentrations of INPs and all aerosol particles were low. The aerosol samples contained mostly sea salt and dust particles. Dust particles were more relevant for the INP concentrations than sea salt. However, dust alone cannot account for all of the measured INPs.\n\nLife cycle of a flower cloud system during the EUREC4A field campaign\n\nZhiqiang Cui, Alan Blyth, Ralph Burton, Sandrine Bony, Steven BÃ¶ing, Alan Gadian, and Leif Denby\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1999,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1999, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCumulus clouds near Barbados can influence how much heat and energy reaches the Earth's surface. A cluster of clouds resembling a flower is presented. Satellite images, dropsonde data, and weather data are used to understand how this cloud system developed. A significant feature was the appearance of a large area of rain at the centre of the cloud system during its later stages. The paper also studied the environmental conditions around the cloud system.\n\nLong-term airborne measurements of pollutants over the United Kingdom to support air quality model development and evaluation\n\nAngela Mynard, Joss Kent, Eleanor R. Smith, Andy Wilson, Kirsty Wivell, Noel Nelson, Matthew Hort, James Bowles, David Tiddeman, Justin M. Langridge, Benjamin Drummond, and Steven J. Abel\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 4229–4261, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4229-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4229-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAir quality models are key in understanding complex air pollution processes and assist in developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of air pollution. The ability of regional air quality models to skilfully represent pollutant distributions aloft is important to enabling their skilful prediction at the surface. To assist in model development and evaluation, a long-term, quality-assured dataset of the 3-D distribution of key pollutants was collected over the United Kingdom (2019–2022).\n\nA bin microphysics parcel model investigation of secondary ice formation in an idealised shallow convective cloud\n\nRachel L. James, Jonathan Crosier, and Paul J. Connolly\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9099–9121, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9099-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9099-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSecondary ice production (SIP) may significantly enhance the ice particle concentration in mixed-phase clouds. We present a systematic modelling study of secondary ice formation in idealised shallow convective clouds for various conditions. Our results suggest that the SIP mechanism of collisions of supercooled water drops with more massive ice particles may be a significant ice formation mechanism in shallow convective clouds outside the rime-splintering temperature range (−3 to −8 °C).\n\nPollution slightly enhances atmospheric cooling by low-level clouds in tropical West Africa\n\nValerian Hahn, Ralf MeerkÃ¶tter, Christiane Voigt, Sonja Gisinger, Daniel Sauer, ValÃ©ry Catoire, Volker Dreiling, Hugh Coe, Cyrille Flamant, Stefan Kaufmann, Jonas Kleine, Peter Knippertz, Manuel Moser, Philip Rosenberg, Hans Schlager, Alfons Schwarzenboeck, and Jonathan Taylor\n\nAtmos.

Radiative transfer simulations, based on the measured cloud properties, reveal that these low-level polluted clouds radiate only 2.6 % more energy back to space, compared with a less polluted cloud. The corresponding additional decrease in temperature is rather small.\n\nEditorial: Aerosol Research â a new diamond open-access journal covering the breadth of aerosol science and technology\n\nJonas Elm, AladÃ¡r Czitrovszky, Andreas Held, Annele Virtanen, Astrid Kiendler-Scharr, Benjamin J.

James, Victoria L. Frankland, Ottmar MÃ¶hler, Benjamin J. Murray, John M. C. Plane, Harald Saathoff, Ralf Weigel, and Martin Schnaiter\n\nAtmos. Chem.

They can consist of different chemical species, including crystalline nitric acid hydrates. We found that mineral dust or meteoric ablation material can efficiently catalyse the formation of a specific phase of nitric acid dihydrate crystals. We determined predominant particle shapes and infrared optical properties of these crystals, which are important inputs for remote sensing detection of PSCs.\n\nSimulating organic aerosol in Delhi with WRF-Chem using the volatility-basis-set approach: exploring model uncertainty with a Gaussian process emulator\n\nErnesto Reyes-Villegas, Douglas Lowe, Jill S.

The volatility basis set (VBS) approach, implemented in air quality models such as WRF-Chem, can be a useful tool to describe primary OA (POA) production and aging. However, the main disadvantage is its complexity. We used a Gaussian process simulator to reproduce model results and to estimate the sources of model uncertainty. We do this by comparing the outputs with OA observations made at Delhi, India, in 2018.\n\nImpact of HO2 aerosol uptake on radical levels and O3 production during summertime in Beijing\n\nJoanna E.

In less polluted regions, atmospheric models over-predict HO2 concentrations. In this modelling study, the impact of heterogeneous uptake of HO2 onto aerosol surfaces on radical concentrations and the ozone production regime in Beijing in the summertime is investigated, and the implications for emissions policies across China are considered.\n\nEvaluating Arctic clouds modelled with the Unified Model and Integrated Forecasting System\n\nGillian Young McCusker, Jutta VÃ¼llers, Peggy Achtert, Paul Field, Jonathan J. Day, Richard Forbes, Ruth Price, Ewan O'Connor, Michael TjernstrÃ¶m, John Prytherch, Ryan Neely III, and Ian M. Brooks\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The overabundance of cloud is interlinked with the modelled thermodynamic structure, with strong negative temperature biases coincident with these overestimated cloud layers.\n\nUsing tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy for ambient hydrogen chloride detection: HCl-TILDAS\n\nJohn W. Halfacre, Jordan Stewart, Scott C. Herndon, Joseph R. Roscioli, Christoph Dyroff, Tara I. Yacovitch, Michael Flynn, Stephen J. Andrews, Steven S. Brown, Patrick R. Veres, and Pete M. Edwards\n\nAtmos. Meas.

HCl is an important atmospheric reservoir for chlorine atoms, which can affect nitrogen oxide cycling and the lifetimes of volatile organic compounds and ozone. However, HCl has a high affinity for interacting with surfaces, thereby preventing fast, quantitative measurements. The sampling technique in this study minimizes these surface interactions and provides a high-quality measurement of HCl.\n\nLate summer transition from a free-tropospheric to boundary layer source of Aitken mode aerosol in the high Arctic\n\nRuth Price, Andrea Baccarini, Julia Schmale, Paul Zieger, Ian M. Brooks, Paul Field, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2927–2961, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2927-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2927-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nArctic clouds can control how much energy is absorbed by the surface or reflected back to space. Using a computer model of the atmosphere we investigated the formation of atmospheric particles that allow cloud droplets to form. We found that particles formed aloft are transported to the lowest part of the Arctic atmosphere and that this is a key source of particles. Our results have implications for the way Arctic clouds will behave in the future as climate change continues to impact the region.\n\nThe importance of acid-processed meteoric smoke relative to meteoric fragments for crystal nucleation in polar stratospheric clouds\n\nAlexander D. James, Finn Pace, Sebastien N. F. Sikora, Graham W. Mann, John M. C. Plane, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2215–2233, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2215-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2215-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere, we examine whether several materials of meteoric origin can nucleate crystallisation in stratospheric cloud droplets which would affect ozone depletion. We find that material which could fragment on atmospheric entry without melting is unlikely to be present in high enough concentration in the stratosphere to contribute to observed crystalline clouds. Material which ablates completely then forms a new solid known as meteoric smoke can provide enough nucleation to explain observed clouds.\n\nFlaring efficiencies and NOx emission ratios measured for offshore oil and gas facilities in the North Sea\n\nJacob T.

Bauguitte, Stuart Young, Stefan Schwietzke, and Grant Allen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

However, few studies have assessed the efficiency with which the gas is combusted. We sampled flaring emissions from offshore facilities in the North Sea. Average measured flaring efficiencies were ~ 98 % but with a skewed distribution, including many flares of lower efficiency. NOx and ethane emissions were also measured. Inefficient flaring practices could be a target for mitigating carbon emissions.\n\nIntercomparison of airborne and surface-based measurements during the CLARIFY, ORACLES and LASIC field experiments\n\nPaul A.

Often measurements take place in isolation, but here we compared data from two aircraft and one ground-based site. This was done in order to understand how well measurements made on one platform compared to those made on another. Whilst this is easy to do in a controlled laboratory setting, it is more challenging in the real world, and so these comparisons are as valuable as they are rare.\n\nThe influence of the addition of isoprene on the volatility of particles formed from the photo-oxidation of anthropogenicâbiogenic mixtures\n\nAristeidis Voliotis, Mao Du, Yu Wang, Yunqi Shao, Thomas J. Bannan, Michael Flynn, Spyros N. Pandis, Carl J. Percival, M. Rami Alfarra, and Gordon McFiggans\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Therefore, the SOA volatility of the mixtures cannot always be predicted based on the additivity. In complex mixtures the formation of lower-volatility products likely outweighs the formation of products with higher volatility. The unique products of each mixture contribute significantly to the signal, suggesting interactions can be important.\n\nNewly identified climatically and environmentally significant high-latitude dust sources\n\nOuti Meinander, Pavla Dagsson-Waldhauserova, Pavel Amosov, Elena Aseyeva, Cliff Atkins, Alexander Baklanov, Clarissa Baldo, Sarah L.

Our results suggest a northern HLD belt at 50–58Â° N in Eurasia and 50–55Â° N in Canada and at >60Â° N in Eurasia and >58Â° N in Canada. Our addition to the previously identified global dust belt (GDB) provides crucially needed information on the extent of active HLD sources with both direct and indirect impacts on climate and environment in remote regions, which are often poorly understood and predicted.\n\nThe ice-nucleating activity of African mineral dust in the Caribbean boundary layer\n\nAlexander D.

In this paper we show that African desert dust that has travelled across the Atlantic to the Caribbean nucleates ice much less well than we might have expected.\n\nBiomass burning and marine aerosol processing over the southeast Atlantic Ocean: a TEM single-particle analysis\n\nCaroline Dang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Lu Zhang, Paola Formenti, Jonathan Taylor, Amie Dobracki, Sara Purdue, Pui-Shan Wong, Athanasios Nenes, Arthur Sedlacek III, Hugh Coe, Jens Redemann, Paquita Zuidema, Steven Howell, and James Haywood\n\nAtmos.

We found that the volatility of organic aerosol increases with biomass burning plume age, that black carbon is often mixed with potassium salts and that the marine atmosphere can incorporate Na and Cl into smoke particles. Marine salts are more processed when mixed with smoke plumes, and there are interesting Cl-rich yet Na-absent marine particles.\n\nAir pollution measurement errors: is your data fit for purpose?\n\nSebastian Diez, Stuart E. Lacy, Thomas J. Bannan, Michael Flynn, Tom Gardiner, David Harrison, Nicholas Marsden, Nicholas A. Martin, Katie Read, and Pete M. Edwards\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4091–4105, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4091-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4091-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegardless of the cost of the measuring instrument, there are no perfect measurements. For this reason, we compare the quality of the information provided by cheap devices when they are used to measure air pollutants and we try to emphasise that before judging the potential usefulness of the devices, the user must specify his own needs. Since commonly used performance indices/metrics can be misleading in qualifying this, we propose complementary visual analysis to the more commonly used metrics.\n\nThe impact of sampling strategy on the cloud droplet number concentration estimated from satellite data\n\nEdward Gryspeerdt, Daniel T. McCoy, Ewan Crosbie, Richard H. Moore, Graeme J. Nott, David Painemal, Jennifer Small-Griswold, Armin Sorooshian, and Luke Ziemba\n\nAtmos. Meas.

It is also used for estimating the cloud response to aerosols. The satellite retrieval depends on a number of assumptions – different sampling strategies are used to select cases where these assumptions are most likely to hold. Here we investigate the impact of these strategies on the agreement with in situ data, the droplet number climatology and estimates of the indirect radiative forcing.\n\nAn evaluation of the heat test for the ice-nucleating ability of minerals and biological material\n\nMartin I. Daily, Mark D. Tarn, Thomas F. Whale, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 2635–2665, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2635-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-2635-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMineral dust and particles of biological origin are important types of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) that can trigger ice formation of supercooled cloud droplets. Heat treatments are used to detect the presence of biological INPs in samples collected from the environment as the activity of mineral INPs is assumed unchanged, although not fully assessed. We show that the ice-nucleating ability of some minerals can change after heating and discuss how INP heat tests should be interpreted.\n\nMeasurement report: Introduction to the HyICE-2018 campaign for measurements of ice-nucleating particles and instrument inter-comparison in the HyytiÃ¤lÃ¤ boreal forest\n\nZoÃ© Brasseur, Dimitri CastarÃ¨de, Erik S.

We provide an overview of the campaign settings, and we describe the measurement infrastructure and operating procedures used. In addition, we use results from ice nucleation instrument inter-comparison to show that the suite of these instruments deployed during the campaign reports consistent results.\n\nAerodynamic size-resolved composition and cloud condensation nuclei properties of aerosols in a Beijing suburban region\n\nChenjie Yu, Dantong Liu, Kang Hu, Ping Tian, Yangzhou Wu, Delong Zhao, Huihui Wu, Dawei Hu, Wenbo Guo, Qiang Li, Mengyu Huang, Deping Ding, and James D. Allan\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions and CCN activation measurement enable a detailed analysis of BC-containing particle hygroscopicity and its size-dependent contribution to the CCN activation. The results presented in this study will affect future models and human health studies.\n\nA strong statistical link between aerosol indirect effects and the self-similarity of rainfall distributions\n\nKalli Furtado and Paul Field\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3391–3407, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3391-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3391-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe complex processes involved mean that no simple answer to this question has so far been discovered: do aerosols increase or decrease precipitation? Using high-resolution weather simulations, we find a self-similar property of rainfall that is not affected by aerosols. Using this invariant, we can collapse all our simulations to a single curve. So, although aerosol effects on rain are many, there may be a universal constraint on the number of degrees of freedom needed to represent them.\n\nThe effect of BC on aerosolâboundary layer feedback: potential implications for urban pollution episodes\n\nJessica Slater, Hugh Coe, Gordon McFiggans, Juha Tonttila, and Sami Romakkaniemi\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 22, 2937–2953, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2937-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2937-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper shows the specific impact of black carbon (BC) on the aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) feedback and its influence on a Beijing haze episode. Overall, this paper shows that strong temperature inversions prevent BC heating within the PBL from significantly increasing PBL height, while BC above the PBL suppresses PBL development significantly through the day. From this we suggest a method by which both locally and regionally emitted BC may impact urban pollution episodes.\n\nHigh concentrations of ice crystals in upper-tropospheric tropical clouds: is there a link to biomass and fossil fuel combustion?\n\nGraciela B. Raga, Darrel Baumgardner, Blanca Rios, Yanet DÃ­az-Esteban, Alejandro Jaramillo, Martin Gallagher, Bastien Sauvage, Pawel Wolff, and Gary Lloyd\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2269–2292, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2269-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2269-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe In-Service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) is a small fleet of commercial aircraft that carry a suite of meteorological, gas, aerosol, and cloud sensors and have been measuring worldwide for almost 9 years, since late 2011. Extreme ice events (EIEs) have been identified from the IAGOS cloud measurements and linked to surface emissions for biomass and fossil fuel consumption. The results reported here are highly relevant for climate change and flight operations forecasting.\n\nMeasurements of ice crystal fluxes from the surface at a mountain top site\n\nWaldemar Schledewitch, Gary Lloyd, Keith Bower, Thomas Choularton, Michael Flynn, and Martin Gallagher\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-69,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-69, 2022\n\nPublication in ACP not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce crystals on the surface of ice and snow covered terrain are thought to be transported into clouds that cover the surface. This has important implications for the properties of clouds in these regions. This research measured the potential transport of surface based ice crystals into the surrounding clouds at a mountain top site.\n\nMulti-thermals and high concentrations of secondary ice: a modelling study of convective clouds during the Ice in Clouds Experiment â Dust (ICE-D) campaign\n\nZhiqiang Cui, Alan Blyth, Yahui Huang, Gary Lloyd, Thomas Choularton, Keith Bower, Paul Field, Rachel Hawker, and Lindsay Bennett\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1649–1667, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh concentrations of ice particles were observed at temperatures greater than about –8 C. The default scheme of the secondary ice production cannot explain the high concentrations. Relaxing the conditions for secondary ice production or considering dust aerosol alone is insufficient to produce the observed amount of ice particles. It is likely that multi-thermals play an important role in producing very high concentrations of secondary ice particles in some tropical clouds.\n\nSecondary ice production during the break-up of freezing water drops on impact with ice particles\n\nRachel L. James, Vaughan T. J. Phillips, and Paul J. Connolly\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18519–18530, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18519-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18519-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSecondary ice production (SIP) plays an important role in ice formation within mixed-phase clouds. We present a laboratory investigation of a potentially new SIP mechanism involving the collisions of supercooled water drops with ice particles. At impact, the supercooled water drop fragments form smaller secondary drops. Approximately 30 % of the secondary drops formed during the retraction phase of the supercooled water drop impact freeze over a temperature range of −4 °C to −12 °C.\n\nModel emulation to understand the joint effects of ice-nucleating particles and secondary ice production on deep convective anvil cirrus\n\nRachel E. Hawker, Annette K. Miltenberger, Jill S. Johnson, Jonathan M. Wilkinson, Adrian A. Hill, Ben J. Shipway, Paul R. Field, Benjamin J. Murray, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 17315–17343, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17315-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe find that ice-nucleating particles (INPs), aerosols that can initiate the freezing of cloud droplets, cause substantial changes to the properties of radiatively important convectively generated anvil cirrus. The number concentration of INPs had a large effect on ice crystal number concentration while the INP temperature dependence controlled ice crystal size and cloud fraction. The results indicate information on INP number and source is necessary for the representation of cloud glaciation.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties of black carbon and organic matter from different combustion and photochemical sources using aerodynamic aerosol classification\n\nDawei Hu, M.

These have allowed us to quantify the changes in shape and chemical composition of different soots according to source and variables such as the moisture content of wood.\n\nControls on surface aerosol particle number concentrations and aerosol-limited cloud regimes over the central Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nHeather Guy, Ian M. Brooks, Ken S. Carslaw, Benjamin J. Murray, Von P. Walden, Matthew D. Shupe, Claire Pettersen, David D. Turner, Christopher J. Cox, William D. Neff, Ralf Bennartz, and Ryan R. Neely III\n\nAtmos.

Aerosol concentrations here have a distinct seasonal cycle from those at lower-altitude Arctic sites, which is driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Our results can be used to help understand the role aerosols might play in Greenland surface melt through the modification of cloud properties. This is crucial in a rapidly changing region where observations are sparse.\n\nHeterogeneous ice nucleation ability of aerosol particles generated from Arctic sea surface microlayer and surface seawater samples at cirrus temperatures\n\nRobert Wagner, Luisa Ickes, Allan K. Bertram, Nora Els, Elena Gorokhova, Ottmar MÃ¶hler, Benjamin J. Murray, Nsikanabasi Silas Umo, and Matthew E. Salter\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 13903–13930, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13903-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13903-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSea spray aerosol particles are a mixture of inorganic salts and organic matter from phytoplankton organisms. At low temperatures in the upper troposphere, both inorganic and organic constituents can induce the formation of ice crystals and thereby impact cloud properties and climate. In this study, we performed experiments in a cloud simulation chamber with particles produced from Arctic seawater samples to quantify the relative contribution of inorganic and organic species in ice formation.\n\nCharacterizing the performance of a POPS miniaturized optical particle counter when operated on a quadcopter drone\n\nZixia Liu, Martin Osborne, Karen Anderson, Jamie D. Shutler, Andy Wilson, Justin Langridge, Steve H. L. Yim, Hugh Coe, Suresh Babu, Sreedharan K. Satheesh, Paquita Zuidema, Tao Huang, Jack C. H. Cheng, and James Haywood\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The results show the POPS performs relatively well on the ground. The impact of the UAV rotors on the POPS is small at low wind speeds, but when operating under higher wind speeds, larger discrepancies occur. It appears that the POPS measures sub-micron aerosol particles more accurately on the UAV.\n\nEUREC4A\n\nBjorn Stevens, Sandrine Bony, David Farrell, Felix Ament, Alan Blyth, Christopher Fairall, Johannes Karstensen, Patricia K.

EUREC4A comprised roughly 5 weeks of measurements in the downstream winter trades of the North Atlantic – eastward and southeastward of Barbados. It was the first campaign that attempted to characterize the full range of processes and scales influencing trade wind clouds.\n\nPM1 composition and source apportionment at two sites in Delhi, India, across multiple seasons\n\nErnesto Reyes-Villegas, Upasana Panda, Eoghan Darbyshire, James M.

Organic aerosol (OA) source apportionment was performed using positive matrix factorisation (PMF). Traffic was the main primary aerosol source for both OAs and black carbon, seen with PMF and Aethalometer model analysis, indicating that control of primary traffic exhaust emissions would make a significant reduction to Delhi air pollution.\n\nIce nucleation by viruses and their potential for cloud glaciation\n\nMichael P.

Hence, we need to know which aerosol types nucleate ice and how effectively they do so. Here we show that virus particles, with a range of architectures, nucleate ice when immersed in supercooled water. However, we also show that they only make a minor contribution to the ice-nucleating particle population in the terrestrial atmosphere, but we cannot rule them out as being important in the marine environment.\n\nSecondary organic aerosols from anthropogenic volatile organic compounds contribute substantially to air pollution mortality\n\nBenjamin A.

However, there is still large uncertainty in predicting SOA in urban regions. Here, we used data from 11 urban campaigns and show that the variability in SOA production in these regions is predictable and is explained by key emissions. These results are used to estimate the premature mortality associated with SOA in urban regions.\n\nTechnical note: A new approach to discriminate different black carbon sources by utilising fullerene and metals in positive matrix factorisation analysis of high-resolution soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer data\n\nZainab Bibi, Hugh Coe, James Brooks, Paul I.

While this itself would be considered a technical development, we can present a budget of contributions to measured BC during the event studied, including the conclusion that fireworks contributed little compared to the bonfire, traffic, and domestic wood-burning emissions.\n\nRapid transformation of ambient absorbing aerosols from West African biomass burning\n\nHuihui Wu, Jonathan W.

We conducted in situ airborne measurements to investigate the evolution of smoke aerosol properties in this region. We observed absorption enhancement for both black carbon and brown carbon after emission, which provides new field results and constraints on aerosol parameterizations for future climate models.\n\nMixing state of refractory black carbon aerosol in the South Asian outflow over the northern Indian Ocean during winter\n\nSobhan Kumar Kompalli, Surendran Nair Suresh Babu, Krishnaswamy Krishna Moorthy, Sreedharan Krishnakumari Satheesh, Mukunda Madhab Gogoi, Vijayakumar S.

Size distributions indicated mixed sources of BC particles in the outflow, which are thickly coated. The coating thickness of BC is controlled mainly by the availability of condensable species in the outflow.\n\nMeasurement report: Altitudinal variation of cloud condensation nuclei activation across the Indo-Gangetic Plain prior to monsoon onset and during peak monsoon periods: results from the SWAAMI field campaign\n\nMohanan R.

The ability of the aerosols to act as cloud-forming nuclei exhibited large spatial variation across the IGP and strong seasonality with increase in this ability with increase in altitude prior to the onset of monsoon and decrease with increase in altitude during the active phase of the monsoon.\n\nIntroducing Ice Nucleating Particles functionality into the Unified Model and its impact on the Southern Ocean short-wave radiation biases\n\nVidya Varma, Olaf Morgenstern, Kalli Furtado, Paul Field, and Jonny Williams\n\nAtmos.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-438,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-438, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a simple parametrisation whereby the immersion freezing temperature in the model is linked to the mineral dust distribution through a diagnostic function, thus invoking regional differences in the nucleation temperatures instead of the global default value of −10 °C. This provides a functionality to mimic the role of Ice Nucleating Particles in the atmosphere on influencing the short-wave radiation over the Southern Ocean region by impacting the cloud phase.\n\nThe temperature dependence of ice-nucleating particle concentrations affects the radiative properties of tropical convective cloud systems\n\nRachel E. Hawker, Annette K. Miltenberger, Jonathan M. Wilkinson, Adrian A. Hill, Ben J. Shipway, Zhiqiang Cui, Richard J. Cotton, Ken S. Carslaw, Paul R. Field, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Our results show that the radiative properties of a complex convective cloud field in the Saharan outflow region are sensitive to the temperature dependence of ice-nucleating particle concentrations. This means that differences in the aerosol source or composition, for the same aerosol size distribution, can cause differences in the outgoing radiation from regions dominated by tropical convection.\n\nThe seasonal cycle of ice-nucleating particles linked to the abundance of biogenic aerosol in boreal forests\n\nJulia Schneider, Kristina HÃ¶hler, Paavo HeikkilÃ¤, Jorma Keskinen, Barbara Bertozzi, Pia Bogert, Tobias Schorr, Nsikanabasi Silas Umo, Franziska Vogel, ZoÃ© Brasseur, Yusheng Wu, Simo Hakala, Jonathan Duplissy, Dmitri Moisseev, Markku Kulmala, Michael P.

Continuous, long-term measurements are needed to characterize the atmospheric INP variability. Here, a first long-term time series of INP spectra measured in the boreal forest for more than 1 year is presented, showing a clear seasonal cycle. It is shown that the seasonal dependency of INP concentrations and prevalent INP types is driven by the abundance of biogenic aerosol.\n\nSensitivity of mixed-phase moderately deep convective clouds to parameterizations of ice formation â an ensemble perspective\n\nAnnette K. Miltenberger and Paul R. Field\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3627–3642, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3627-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3627-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe formation of ice in clouds is an important processes in mixed-phase and ice-phase clouds. However, the representation of ice formation in numerical models is highly uncertain. In the last decade, several new parameterizations for heterogeneous freezing have been proposed. Here, we investigate the impact of the parameterization choice on the representation of the convective cloud field and compare the impact to that of initial condition uncertainty.\n\nCharacterising optical array particle imaging probes: implications for small-ice-crystal observations\n\nSebastian O'Shea, Jonathan Crosier, James Dorsey, Louis Gallagher, Waldemar Schledewitz, Keith Bower, Oliver Schlenczek, Stephan Borrmann, Richard Cotton, Christopher Westbrook, and Zbigniew Ulanowski\n\nAtmos.

This work suggests that one of the most widely used methods for in situ measurements of these properties has significant uncertainties and biases. We suggest methods that dramatically improve these measurements, which can be applied to past and future datasets from these instruments.\n\nChemical characterisation of benzene oxidation products under high- and low-NOx conditions using chemical ionisation mass spectrometry\n\nMichael Priestley, Thomas J.

Phys., 21, 3473–3490, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3473-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3473-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA significant fraction of emissions from human activity consists of aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene, which oxidise to form new compounds important for particle growth. Characterisation of benzene oxidation products highlights the range of species produced as well as their chemical properties and contextualises them within relevant frameworks, e.g. MCM. Cluster analysis of the oxidation product time series distinguishes behaviours of CHON compounds that could aid in identifying functionality.\n\nObservation of absorbing aerosols above clouds over the south-east Atlantic Ocean from the geostationary satellite SEVIRI â PartÂ 2: Comparison with MODIS and aircraft measurements from the CLARIFY-2017 field campaign\n\nFanny Peers, Peter Francis, Steven J. Abel, Paul A. Barrett, Keith N. Bower, Michael I. Cotterell, Ian Crawford, Nicholas W. Davies, Cathryn Fox, Stuart Fox, Justin M. Langridge, Kerry G. Meyer, Steven E. Platnick, Kate Szpek, and Jim M. Haywood\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Cloud and above-cloud aerosol properties retrieved from SEVIRI are compared against MODIS and measurements from the CLARIFY-2017 campaign. While some systematic differences are observed between SEVIRI and MODIS, the overall agreement in the cloud and aerosol properties is very satisfactory.\n\nEvaluating the sensitivity of radical chemistry and ozone formation to ambient VOCs and NOx in Beijing\n\nLisa K. Whalley, Eloise J. Slater, Robert Woodward-Massey, Chunxiang Ye, James D. Lee, Freya Squires, James R. Hopkins, Rachel E. Dunmore, Marvin Shaw, Jacqueline F. Hamilton, Alastair C.

This paper presents measurements of OH, HO2 and total RO2 taken in central Beijing. The radical observations are compared to a detailed chemistry model, which shows that under low NO conditions, there is a missing OH source. Under high NOx conditions, the model under-predicts RO2 and impacts our ability to model ozone.\n\nThe Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE): a new online instrument for laboratory studies and automated long-term field observations of ice-nucleating particles\n\nOttmar MÃ¶hler, Michael Adams, Larissa Lacher, Franziska Vogel, Jens Nadolny, Romy Ullrich, Cristian Boffo, Tatjana Pfeuffer, Achim Hobl, Maximilian WeiÃ, Hemanth S. K. Vepuri, Naruki Hiranuma, and Benjamin J. Murray\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 1143–1166, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1143-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1143-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Earth's climate is influenced by clouds, which are impacted by ice-nucleating particles (INPs), a minor fraction of atmospheric aerosols. INPs induce ice formation in clouds and thus often initiate precipitation formation. The Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) is the first fully automated instrument to study cloud ice formation and to obtain long-term records of INPs. This is a timely development, and the capabilities it offers for research and atmospheric monitoring are significant.\n\nHydrometeor classification of quasi-vertical profiles of polarimetric radar measurements using a top-down iterative hierarchical clustering method\n\nMaryna Lukach, David Dufton, Jonathan Crosier, Joshua M. Hampton, Lindsay Bennett, and Ryan R. Neely III\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 1075–1098, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1075-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1075-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel technique of data-driven hydrometeor classification (HC) from quasi-vertical profiles, where the hydrometeor types are identified from an optimal number of hierarchical clusters, obtained recursively. This data-driven HC approach is capable of providing an optimal number of classes from dual-polarimetric weather radar observations. The embedded flexibility in the extent of granularity is the main advantage of this technique.\n\nLow-NO atmospheric oxidation pathways in a polluted megacity\n\nMike J. Newland, Daniel J.

This is caused by extremely low levels of nitric oxide (NO), typically expected to be high in urban areas, observed in the afternoon. This work has significant implications for how we understand atmospheric chemistry in the urban environment and thus for how to implement effective policies to improve urban air quality.\n\nThe CLoudâAerosolâRadiation Interaction and Forcing: YearÂ 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) measurement campaign\n\nJim M.

Langridge, Florent Malavelle, Daniel G. Partridge, Fanny Peers, Jens Redemann, Philip Stier, Kate Szpek, Jonathan W. Taylor, Duncan Watson-Parris, Robert Wood, Huihui Wu, and Paquita Zuidema\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 1049–1084, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-1049-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-1049-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEvery year, the seasonal cycle of biomass burning from agricultural practices in Africa creates a huge plume of smoke that travels many thousands of kilometres over the Atlantic Ocean. This study provides an overview of a measurement campaign called the cloud–aerosol–radiation interaction and forcing for year 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) and documents the rationale, deployment strategy, observations, and key results from the campaign which utilized the heavily equipped FAAM atmospheric research aircraft.\n\nOpinion: Cloud-phase climate feedback and the importance of ice-nucleating particles\n\nBenjamin J. Murray, Kenneth S. Carslaw, and Paul R. Field\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 665–679, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-665-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-665-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe balance between the amounts of ice and supercooled water in clouds over the world's oceans strongly influences how much these clouds can dampen or amplify global warming. Aerosol particles which catalyse ice formation can dramatically reduce the amount of supercooled water in clouds; hence we argue that we need a concerted effort to improve our understanding of these ice-nucleating particles if we are to improve our predictions of climate change.\n\nDirect measurements of black carbon fluxes in central Beijing using the eddy covariance method\n\nRutambhara Joshi, Dantong Liu, Eiko Nemitz, Ben Langford, Neil Mullinger, Freya Squires, James Lee, Yunfei Wu, Xiaole Pan, Pingqing Fu, Simone Kotthaus, Sue Grimmond, Qiang Zhang, Ruili Wu, Oliver Wild, Michael Flynn, Hugh Coe, and James Allan\n\nAtmos.

Sources of BC include biomass burning, transport, industry and domestic cooking and heating. In this study, we measured BC emissions in Beijing, finding a dominance of traffic emissions over all other sources. The quantitative method presented here has benefits for revising widely used emissions inventories and for understanding BC sources with impacts on air quality and climate.\n\nAirborne measurements of fire emission factors for African biomass burning sampled during the MOYA campaign\n\nPatrick A. Barker, Grant Allen, Martin Gallagher, Joseph R. Pitt, Rebecca E. Fisher, Thomas Bannan, Euan G. Nisbet, StÃ©phane J.-B. Bauguitte, Dominika Pasternak, Samuel Cliff, Marina B. Schimpf, Archit Mehra, Keith N. Bower, James D. Lee, Hugh Coe, and Carl J. Percival\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Despite this, there has been little previous in situ study of African BB emissions. This work presents BB emission factors for various atmospheric trace gases sampled from an aircraft in two distinct areas of Africa (Senegal and Uganda). Intracontinental variability in biomass burning methane emission is identified, which is attributed to difference in the specific fuel mixtures burnt.\n\nQuantifying bioaerosol concentrations in dust clouds through online UV-LIF and mass spectrometry measurements at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory\n\nDouglas Morrison, Ian Crawford, Nicholas Marsden, Michael Flynn, Katie Read, Luis Neves, Virginia Foot, Paul Kaye, Warren Stanley, Hugh Coe, David Topping, and Martin Gallagher\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 14473–14490, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14473-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14473-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide conservative estimates of the concentrations of bacteria within transatlantic dust clouds, originating from the African continent. We observe significant seasonal differences in the overall concentrations of particles but no seasonal variation in the ratio between bacteria and dust. With bacteria contributing to ice formation at warmer temperatures than dust, our observations should improve the accuracy of climate models.\n\nA test of the ability of current bulk optical models to represent the radiative properties of cirrus cloud across the mid- and far-infrared\n\nRichard J. Bantges, Helen E. Brindley, Jonathan E. Murray, Alan E. Last, Jacqueline E. Russell, Cathryn Fox, Stuart Fox, Chawn Harlow, Sebastian J. O'Shea, Keith N. Bower, Bryan A. Baum, Ping Yang, Hilke Oetjen, and Juliet C. Pickering\n\nAtmos. Chem.

These clouds are ubiquitous and are composed of ice crystals that have complex shapes that are incredibly difficult to model. This work exploits new measurements of the Earth's emitted thermal energy made from instruments flown on board an aircraft to test how well the latest ice cloud models can represent these clouds. Results indicate further developments are required.\n\nVertical variability of the properties of highly aged biomass burning aerosol transported over the southeast Atlantic during CLARIFY-2017\n\nHuihui Wu, Jonathan W. Taylor, Kate Szpek, Justin M. Langridge, Paul I. Williams, Michael Flynn, James D. Allan, Steven J. Abel, Joseph Pitt, Michael I. Cotterell, Cathryn Fox, Nicholas W. Davies, Jim Haywood, and Hugh Coe\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Our observations demonstrate the persistence of strongly absorbing BBAs across wide regions of the South Atlantic. We also found significant vertical variation in the single-scattering albedo of these BBAs, as a function of relative chemical composition and size. Aerosol properties in the marine BL are suggested to be separated from the FT.\n\nUsing a coupled large-eddy simulationâaerosol radiation model to investigate urban haze: sensitivity to aerosol loading and meteorological conditions\n\nJessica Slater, Juha Tonttila, Gordon McFiggans, Paul Connolly, Sami Romakkaniemi, Thomas KÃ¼hn, and Hugh Coe\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 11893–11906, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11893-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11893-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe feedback effect between aerosol particles, radiation and meteorology reduces turbulent motion and results in increased surface aerosol concentrations during Beijing haze. Observational analysis and regional modelling studies have examined the feedback effect but these studies are limited. In this work, we set up a high-resolution model for the Beijing environment to examine the sensitivity of the aerosol feedback effect to initial meteorological conditions and aerosol loading.\n\nAbsorption closure in highly aged biomass burning smoke\n\nJonathan W. Taylor, Huihui Wu, Kate Szpek, Keith Bower, Ian Crawford, Michael J. Flynn, Paul I. Williams, James Dorsey, Justin M. Langridge, Michael I. Cotterell, Cathryn Fox, Nicholas W. Davies, Jim M. Haywood, and Hugh Coe\n\nAtmos. Chem.

These plumes absorb the sunâs energy and warm the climate. We used airborne optical instrumentation to determine how absorbing the smoke was as well as the relative importance of black and brown carbon. We also tested different ways of simulating these properties that could be used in a climate model.\n\nThe ice-nucleating activity of Arctic sea surface microlayer samples and marine algal cultures\n\nLuisa Ickes, Grace C.

Sea spray might be a potential source of aerosols acting as ice-nucleating particles. We investigate two common phytoplankton species (Melosira arctica and Skeletonema marinoi) and present their ice nucleation activity in comparison with Arctic seawater microlayer samples from different field campaigns. We also aim to understand the aerosolization process of marine biological samples and the potential effect on the ice nucleation activity.\n\nDevelopment of aerosol activation in the double-moment Unified Model and evaluation with CLARIFY measurements\n\nHamish Gordon, Paul R. Field, Steven J. Abel, Paul Barrett, Keith Bower, Ian Crawford, Zhiqiang Cui, Daniel P. Grosvenor, Adrian A. Hill, Jonathan Taylor, Jonathan Wilkinson, Huihui Wu, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We present the first version of the model in which both aerosol and cloud particle mass and number concentrations are allowed to evolve separately and independently, which is important for studying how aerosols affect weather and climate. We test the model against aircraft observations near Ascension Island in the Atlantic, focusing on how aerosols can \"activate\" to become cloud droplets.\n\nOligomer and highly oxygenated organic molecule formation from oxidation of oxygenated monoterpenes emitted by California sage plants\n\nArchit Mehra, Jordan E. Krechmer, Andrew Lambe, Chinmoy Sarkar, Leah Williams, Farzaneh Khalaj, Alex Guenther, John Jayne, Hugh Coe, Douglas Worsnop, Celia Faiola, and Manjula Canagaratna\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Real plant emissions are much more diverse than the few proxies widely used for studies of plant SOA. Here we present the first study of SOA from Californian sage plants and the oxygenated monoterpenes representing their major emissions. We identify SOA products and show the importance of the formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules and oligomers.\n\nEvaluating the use of Facebook's Prophet model v0.6 in forecasting concentrations of NO2 at single sites across the UK and in response to the COVID-19 lockdown in Manchester, England\n\nDavid Topping, David Watts, Hugh Coe, James Evans, Thomas J.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-270,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-270, 2020\n\nPublication in GMD not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTime-series forecasting methods have often been used to mitigate some of the challenges associated with deploying chemical transport models. In this study we deploy and evaluate Facebookâs Prophetmodel v0.6 in predicting hourly concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2]. et. Overall we find the Prophet model offers a relatively effective and simple way to make predictions about NO2 at local levels.\n\nEvaluation of the chemical composition of gas- and particle-phase products of aromatic oxidation\n\nArchit Mehra, Yuwei Wang, Jordan E.
