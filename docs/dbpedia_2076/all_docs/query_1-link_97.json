Given the heterogeneity of symptoms expressed in patients suffering from such psychiatric disorders, the ability to parse the underlying neurobiology of each symptom individually is essential for identifying more specific targets for treatments.\n\nEnhanced levels of glucocorticoids and pro-inflammatory cytokines are known risk factors for MDD, and chronic treatment with pharmacological agents related to these factors, e.g. corticosterone (CORT) and interferon-alpha (IFN-α), have shown to induce depressive-like phenotypes in rats. Previous studies have shown that both these substances induce negative cognitive bias, as measured in the affective bias test (ABT), but only CORT appears to induce anhedonia in the commonly used sucrose preference test.\n\nOur study compares the effects of chronic treatment with CORT vs IFN-α on anhedonia-like behaviour in Sprague-Dawley rats, as measured in a more sensitive analysis of their licking microstructure when consuming 4% and 16% sucrose solutions. We demonstrate that CORT-treated rats displayed a significantly reduced average lick cluster size, indicating a lower hedonic response to sucrose reward. However, IFN-α treatment did not result in a change in lick cluster size.\n\nThese findings suggest distinct neurobiological roles of glucocorticoids and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the disruption of reward processing. Our future work will examine the effects of CORT vs IFN-α on motivational behaviour, completing the assessment of hedonic, motivational, and cognitive components of reward processing deficits, and thus characterising the psychiatric symptoms specifically associated with glucocorticoid and pro-inflammatory cytokine overproduction.\n\nPoster number: PS002 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nEffects of an Immunomodulator in a mice model of Social Isolation\n\nAuthors: Ms Daniela Magalhães1,2,3, Ms Myrthe Mampay3, Mrs Ana M Sebastião1,2, Mr Graham, K Sheridan3, Mrs Cláudia, A Valente1,2\n\n1 Instituto de Farmacologia e Neurociências, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, 2 Instituto de Medicina Molecular – João Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, 3 NeuroImmunology and NeuroTherapeutics Lab, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Brighton, Brighton, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: Social isolation (SI) is a psychological stressor, causing an alteration between the immune system and CNS communication1,2. Therefore, the modulation of the crosstalk between immune system and CNS cells in a SI mice model was studied. FTY720, a nootropic and an inhibitor of the peripheral immune cell migration3,4, was used to evaluate its effects upon anxiety-like behaviour and neuroinflammation induced by SI.\n\nMethods: Young and Aged mice were studied and divided into 4 groups. Two groups were grouped house (GH) and the other two were SI for three weeks. Half of GH and half of SI received DMSO, while the other half was treated with FTY720. Depression and anxiety were evaluated through Force Swim Test (FST) and Open Field (OF), respectively. Following the behaviour tests, molecular approaches were performed, specifically ELISA and Western Blot, to evaluate neuroinflammatory markers in hippocampus region, since they have a role in mental disorders.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: All the statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, USA) and two-way ANOVA was used.\n\nResults and conclusions: FST showed a decrease in immobility time in Young mice SI-FTY720 when compared to SI group, while OFT revealed a resilience in SI Aged mice treated group. Microglia activation analyses demonstrated that FTY720 decreased Iba-1 expression in SI Aged mice. Besides, inflammasome NLRP3 levels, which integrates the stress-associated signals5, were also diminished when given the drug to SI Young mice. This inflammatory complex is upstream in the activation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which has also a key role in anxiety and depression5. Thus, IL-1β expression was study and results showed a decreasing tendency in groups treated with FTY720. In conclusion, FTY720 treatment demonstrated a significant improvement in anxiety-like behaviour and a decrease in inflammatory mediators.\n\n1.\n\nStepanichev M, et al (2014).

KG, Biberach an der Riss, Germany\n\nIntroduction: Affective biases are thought to be an important factor in the development, maintenance and treatment of depression, and can be measured in animals. Previous work has shown that acute, systemic treatment with rapid-onset antidepressants induce positive biases in decision making in a reward-based operant rodent judgement bias task (Hales et al., 2017). Here, we refine the site of action of three drugs shown to rapidly alter bias in this task by using targeted infusions into the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To further elucidate the potential mechanisms involved we tested the GABAA agonist muscimol.\n\nMethods: Male lister-hooded rats were trained to discriminate between two distinct reference tones and respond on the appropriate lever to obtain high-value (four pellets) or low-value (one pellet) reward. Once trained, rats were implanted with mPFC guide cannula. Following recovery infusion studies were carried out using fully counterbalanced within-subject study designs. For experiment 1, rats were pretreated with either vehicle (PBS), ketamine (1μg/μl), scopolamine (0.1μg/μl) or muscimol (0.1μg/μl), while for experiments 2 and 3 rats were pretreated with either vehicle (10% 2-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin, 90% PBS) or CP-101,606 (1μg/μl or 3μg/μl respectively). Drugs were infused 5 minutes before twice-weekly test sessions (Tue/Fri) where judgement bias was measured by presenting midpoint ambiguous tones along with reference tones.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Change from baseline in cognitive bias index (proportion of responses on the high-reward lever minus low-reward lever for vehicle session subtracted from drug session) was used as the main measure of judgement bias. Response latency and percentages of positive responses, omissions and premature responses were also analysed. Repeated measures ANOVAs with either one (treatment) or two (treatment and tone) factors were used as appropriate.\n\nResults and conclusions: Ketamine, scopolamine and CP-101,606 (3μg/μl) induced specific positive changes in judgement bias for the midpoint tone ( ), replicating effects seen using systemic treatments. Muscimol caused non-specific changes in behavioural measures across all three tones. This implicates the mPFC in the rapid-onset action of these drugs in altering decision making biases. These results also suggest the mechanism is more specific than inhibition of neurotransmission in the mPFC.\n\nPoster number: PS004 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nNot all rats like to be tickled\n\nAuthors: Mrs Justyna K Hinchcliffe1, Prof. Michael Mendl2, Prof. Emma SJ Robinson1\n\n1 University of Bristol, School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Bristol, United Kingdom, 2 University of Bristol, School of Veterinary Sciences, Langford, Bristol, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: Tickling and laughter have been primarily associated with humans and non-human primates, although this behaviour is thought to be observed in rats too (Panksepp J, Burgdorf J, 2003, Physiol. Behav., 79(3): 533–47). Affective neuroscience research suggests that tickle-induced high frequency vocalisation patterns (50-kHz chirps), elicited by rough-and-tumble play, correspond to primitive human laughter and they may be related to their affective state. It also has been suggested that not all animals, like humans, encounter tickling as a pleasurable experience.\n\nMethods: Male Lister Hooded rats (Harlan, N=16) were trained in the affective bias test (ABT for detailed method see Hinchcliffe JK et al., 2017, Psychopharmacology, 234(20): 3105-3116.), to enable a direct and individual measure of their affective state in response to tickling. The number of 50-kHz calls emitted during the 30s tickling sessions was then used to correlate with data from the ABT.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: The % choice bias data from the experiment were analysed using a one-sample t-test against the null hypothesised mean of 0% choice bias. Pearson correlation was used to analyse relationship between choice bias and the number of 50-kHz chirps.\n\nResults and conclusions: Tickling induced a positive bias in rats in the ABT consistent with induction of a positive affective state at a group level (t15=4.753, p=0.0003). There was a strong correlation between affective state and rats ‘positive’ vocalisations during the tickling episode (Pearson correlation, r=0.8911, p=0.0001). Moreover, we observed that not all rats respond to tickling in the same way, the animals that did not vocalise with 50-kHz calls also did not experience a positive affective state. Additional control experiment (hand approach test) revealed that these findings were not driven by direct or indirect effects of handling. This work demonstrates that individual differences in the amount of laughter induced by tickling are related to their affective response and, as seen in humans, not all rats like to be tickled.\n\nFunding for this research was supported by a University of Bristol Research Postgraduate Studentship awarded to JKH.

Response inhibition can be assessed with the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), used as a clinical index in several disorders. Subcortical structures like basal ganglia (BG) are involved in the IC process and are known to change in structure, activation and connectivity along the different cycle phases. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the BG activation and connectivity patterns related to IC across the menstrual cycle.\n\nMethods: Thirty-six naturally cycling women were scanned three times locked to their menstrual cycle. During each session they performed a Stop Signal Task and saliva samples were collected to analyse hormonal levels.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: For the neuroimaging analysis we applied a two stage mixed effects model with SPM12, assessing the connectivity of bilateral BG with psychophysiological interaction (PPI). In order to analyze the behavioral data, the bilateral putamen BOLD-response and the effects of hormonal levels, statistical analyses were carried out through linear-mixed effects (LME) models.\n\nResults and conclusions: We found an impaired SSRT during pre-ovulatory compared to menses, but only for those women who had better baseline IC. The BOLD-response in left and right putamen significantly decreased during luteal compared to pre-ovulatory for all women. Furthermore, the connectivity strength from the left putamen displayed an interactive effect of cycle phase and baseline IC. During pre-ovulatory compared to menses connectivity was significantly stronger for women with better IC, while it was decreased for women with worse IC in ACC and left IPL; and during luteal compared to menses in left SMA. The activation of the right putamen and differences in connectivity strength predicted the SSRT across participants. Therefore, we propose a compensatory mechanism for the hormonal changes across the menstrual cycle based on a lateralized pattern in putamens’ activation and connectivity depending on the baseline IC.\n\nPoster number: PS006 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nActivation of kappa opioid receptor (kor) potentiates cold sensation\n\nAuthors: Dr Manish Kumar Madasu1,2,3, Dr Tayler D Sheahan2, Audra M Foshage2, Dr. Gina M Story2, Dr Jordan G.

Thermal plantar assay was developed to assess how mice discriminate between the cold (30C, 100C) or warm temperatures (300C). RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) fluorescent assay was used to determine the expression of KOR in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and its co-localization with TRPA1. To determine the calcium dynamics in DRG neurons, neurons were cultured from WT and treated with a TRPA1 agonist, mustard oil (MO) (100μM), U50 (10 μM), a combination of both and change in the intensity of the calcium indicator was quantified.\n\nApproach for Statistical Analysis: A two tailed unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison test was used, and data is presented as mean ± SD.\n\nResults: Mice injected with U50 showed significant potentiation in the number of jumps on the cold plate compared to controls at 30C. U50-induced nocifensive responses were attenuated in TRPA1 KO mice and norBNI administered mice. In the thermal plantar assay, WT spent less time in the cold zone when compared to their respective controls, which was higher in females. The hyperresponsivity to cold temperatures was higher at 30C vs. 100C. In ISH, the KORs colocalized with the TRPA1 in the DRG. Simultaneous application of MO, and U50 yielded a potentiated Ca2+ response when compared to the MO treatment, suggesting crosstalk between receptors in the DRG.\n\nConclusion: Activation of KOR potentiated cold sensation maybe via TRPA1 channel. The cold hyperresponsivity potentiated by KOR is temperature dependent and sex dependent. Colocalization of KOR and TRPA1 mediating cold responses in the DRG, and could potentially unravel the cold hypersensitivity associated with peripheral neuropathies.\n\nPoster number: PS007 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nTowards an apathy phenotype: A behavioural analysis of aged mice\n\nAuthors: Ms Megan Jackson1, Prof Stafford Lightman2, Dr Hugh Marston3, Prof Emma Robinson1\n\n1 Dpt. of physiology, pharmacology and neuroscience, Biomedical sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom, 2 Translational medical sciences, Dorothy Hodgkin building, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK, 3 Translational neuroscience, Eli Lilly and company limited, Surrey, UK\n\nIntroduction: Apathy is a common behavioural symptom of aging, characterised by motivational deficit and emotional blunting. It is associated with poor quality of life and significant caregiver stress (Brodaty, H. et al 2010). Very few studies have explored the underlying mechanisms of apathy particularly in the context of normal aging, and as such treatment options are limited. The development of a suitable model for apathy to allow for assessment of its underlying neurobiology is therefore necessary. Here, we explore the impact of aging on behaviours relevant to apathy including sensitivity to reward, motivation for reward and emotional responsiveness to stress.\n\nMethods: An aged cohort of 12 c57bl/6 male mice (15 months) provided by Eli Lilly and 12 sex and strain-matched controls (2 months) were used. Emotional responsiveness to stress was assessed using the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT). Motivation for reward was assessed using the progressive ratio task (PR) under food restriction and free food conditions, as well as the effort for reward (EfR) task. Sensitivity to reward was assessed using the sucrose preference test (SPT). Potential confounding factors such as differences in appetite and cognition were assessed using a consumption test and novel object recognition test (NORT).\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Performance in behavioural tests was compared between age-groups using an unpaired t-test. Where an additional factor including time/session was analysed, a repeated measures mixed model ANOVA with post-hoc unpaired t-test analysis was used.\n\nResults and conclusions: Aged mice showed a reduced latency to eat in the NSFT and completed less trials in the PR task and EfR task ( ). However, mice failed to reach breakpoint under food restriction, and free food conditions removed the significant effect of age on PR performance. Aged mice also showed a reduced preference to sucrose solution in the SPT. The consumption test revealed aged mice eat more reward pellets when they are freely available compared to younger mice. The NORT revealed no difference in cognition between groups. Overall aged mice show evidence of blunted emotional and motivational arousal consistent with an apathy phenotype.\n\n.\n\nPoster number: PS008 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nDifferential behavioural effects of opioid receptor modulation on motivational state in the wistar 7yoto rat\n\nAuthors: Dr Jennifer Rouine1, Dr Charlotte K Callaghan1, Mr Md Nurul Islam1, Dr David J Eyerman2, Dr Connie Sanchez2, Prof Shane M O'Mara1\n\n1 Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, 2 Alkermes, Inc., 852 Winter Street, Waltham, United States of America\n\nMajor depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability worldwide1 and inadequate response to antidepressant drug treatment is a serious issue. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats are considered to be a model of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) due to their increased immobility in the forced swim test (FST) and lack of response to standard selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant treatments. In this study the WKY rat was used to examine the role of mu (MOR), kappa (KOR) and delta (DOR) opioid receptors in mediating mood and motivational behaviour in the forced swim test (FST) and a progressive ratio (PR) schedule.\n\nWKY and control Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were tested in the FST, a measure of depressive-like behaviour, and a PR schedule, a measure of motivational behaviour. Opioid receptor modulators (MOR: cyprodime (10mg/kg), morphine (5mg/kg), RDC 2944 (0.1mg/kg); KOR: DIPPA (10mg/kg), U50 488 (5mg/kg); DOR: naltrindole (10mg/kg), SNC 80 (20mg/kg)) were administered s.c. 1hr before FST or 30min before PR schedule test. Fluoxetine (10mg/kg), an SSRI, was administered p.o. (once per day for 4 weeks). Hippocampal brain tissue was harvested post-mortem and analysed for neurogenesis by flow cytometry. Data were analysed by regular or repeated measures one- or two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparison tests, where appropriate.\n\nIncreased immobility in the FST was observed in WKY rats in comparison to SD controls and treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine did not reduce this. Treatment with DIPPA or SNC 80 alone, or in combination, reduced immobility of WKY rats in the FST. Reduced breaking point (max responses per reinforcement) in the PR schedule was observed in WKY rats in comparison to SD controls and treatment with opioid receptor modulators failed to recover this. Reduced BrdU-labelled hippocampal cells were observed in WKY rats in comparison to SD controls. Treatment with DIPPA or SNC 80 alone, or in combination, attenuated this reduction. These data provide evidence to support the investigation of opioid receptor modulators for the management of TRD.\n\n1.\n\nRouine et al., Opioid modulation of depression: A focus on imaging studies.

Two key cognitive processes relevant to these social interactions are: (i) how people perceive their share of the resource distributions proposed by others, and (ii) the degree to which social affective biases (e.g. perceiving others’ facial emotions more negatively than they actually are) influence these valuation mechanisms.\n\nMethods: Participants (N=60) completed a brief facial emotion recognition task (bFERT) and rated various affective faces on a 9-point Likert scale (i.e. from negative to positive), allowing an assessment of social affective biases. A subset of participants (n=49) interacted with human confederates or a computerised opponent in a novel interpersonal monetary negotiation game which incorporates opponents’ facial emotions, while undergoing pupillometry. All participants completed questionnaire measures of mood and social value orientation (e.g. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, Social Value Orientation Slider Measure).\n\nAnalysis approach: Affective biases were evaluated by fitting a 2-parameter probability weighting function to participant ratings in the bFERT. Participant choice behaviour was analysed using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model (e.g. regressors: opponent's facial emotion, offer amount, interaction term) as well as fitting formal computational models of the negotiation process. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate linear relationships between psychological questionnaire scores and decision-making parameters.\n\nResults and conclusions: Regression analysis of acceptance probabilities suggested that unfair offers coming from proposers with positive facial emotions were more likely to be accepted (based on Bonferroni corrected t-tests on regression coefficients, all t>3.508, all p<.001). Model-based analysis suggested that social affective biases accounting for how people perceive others’ emotional states are represented nonlinearly. Decision values, which guide participants’ probability of accepting a condition in the negotiation game, are influenced by both the offer amount and an inequality term (i.e. difference between self and other's reward), which are further modulated by social affective biases.\n\nPoster number: PS010 (PP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nPredicting successful inhibition using machine learning based on the brain's beta rhythm\n\nAuthors: Ms Nadja Enz1, Dr Kathy Ruddy1,2, Dr Laura Rueda-Delgado1, Dr Robert Whelan1\n\n1 Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland, 2 Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nIntroduction: The ability to inhibit unwanted behaviours is reliant upon effective inhibitory control in the brain. Poor inhibitory control is characteristic of a wide range of psychiatric conditions. The Stop-Signal Task (SST) is a lab-based measure that is sensitive to this deficiency, quantifying the time taken to cancel a response that has already been initiated (SSRT). A strong increase in the amplitude of brain oscillations in the beta (15–30Hz) frequency is registered in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings over the right inferior frontal gyrus at the moment of stopping a movement (Swann et al. 2009, Wagner et al. 2017). However, it is not clear whether this beta burst is directly instrumental in stopping the ongoing brain processes, or whether the pre-stop stimulus beta power influences successful inhibition. We hypothesise that if beta is instrumental to stopping, machine learning should be able to classify successful vs failed stop trials on the basis of beta power during stopping, but not of beta power prior to stopping.\n\nMethods: EEG (64 channels) was recorded from 344 healthy participants while performing the SST. Beta power will be extracted at: i) the time of individual SSRT; and ii) in the 200ms before presentation of the stop signal.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Penalised logistic regression will be used in our machine learning approach to predict the trial type (i.e. successful stop or failed stop). Nested cross-validation will be used to ensure stability of the model estimates (actual model). The entire procedure will be repeated using random-label permutation (null model). The accuracy of the null model will be compared to the accuracy of the actual model by performing a t-test. The actual model will be deemed to be successful if the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the actual model is larger than that of the null model (p<0.05). The 95th percentile of the features of the null model will be used as a threshold on the actual model to identify spatial features (i.e. scalp locations) that best predict trial type. This procedure will be applied to an internal validation set and tested on an external validation set.\n\nPoster number: PS011 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nAn empirical investigation of age-related differences in mind-wandering using triangulation of subjective, behavioural and electrophysiological measures\n\nAuthors: Ms Catherine Moran1,2, Ms Greta Warren1,2, Mr Rónán Ó Grálaigh1,2, Dr Joanne Kenney1,2, Dr David McGovern5, Prof Alan Smeaton3,4, Prof Paul Dockree1,2\n\n1 Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, College Green, Ireland, 2 School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin, College Green, Ireland, 3 School of Computing, Dublin City University, Ireland, 4 The Insight Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University, Ireland, 5 School of Nursing & Human Science, Dublin City University, Ireland\n\nIntroduction: In mind-wandering, attention is disengaged from processing of the perceptual environment and redirected toward endogenously-generated mental content. However, little is known about how the phenomenology of these endogenous states differs between younger and older adults. This study classifies and measures the nature and frequency of mind-wandering states and investigates age-related differences.\n\nMethods: A novel paradigm was employed using an adapted Continuous Gradual Target Detection task (McGovern et al., 2018; O'Connell et al., 2012) with triangulation of self-report, behavioural and electrophysiological assessments to decompose the signatures of mind-wandering. Thirty-eight participants completed the task requiring identification of contrast changes of a continuously presented flickering (25Hz) annulus stimulus for an intermittent gradual and smooth contrast reduction. The task was pseudo-randomly interrupted by experience sampling probes asking participants to subjectively discriminate the phenomenology and intentionality of their thoughts. Behavioural performance indices were measured, and electrophysiological signatures were tracked in real-time using continuous EEG and pupillometry.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Preliminary analyses explored the nature and frequency of self-reported mind-wandering for younger and older adults. Additional analyses were designed to examine the electrophysiological changes that anticipate unintentional and intentional mind-wandering states in younger and older adults to elucidate the emergence of different subtypes of mind-wandering as a function of age.\n\nResults and conclusions: Consistent with the literature, preliminary analysis showed that mind-wandering is frequent in human cognition. Groups differed in the propensity for and nature of mind-wandering. Older adults self-reported mind-wandering 31.38% of the time (20.82% unintentional; 10.56% intentional), while younger adults mind-wandered 53.01% of the time (31.13% unintentional; 21.88% intentional). Results are discussed in relation to the role of awareness in mind-wandering and different age-related metacognitive strategies.\n\nPoster number: PS012 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nLateral habenular-projecting hypothalamic neurons regulate food preference in a leptin dependent manner\n\nAuthors: Dr Richard M.

Pharmacotherapies that safely reduce body weight in obesity remain elusive, partially due to our incomplete knowledge of the complex neuronal mechanisms that control food choice. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is considered a critical node in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. A major output of the LH terminates in the lateral habenula (LHb) which exerts a negative influence over motivated behaviours through inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons. We tested the hypothesis that LH projections to LHb play an important role in food preference and food-related motivation through downstream influences on midbrain dopamine neurons.\n\nMethods: Monosynaptic rabies tracing, Fibre Photometry, Behavioural analyses of Feeding\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Linear Mixed Effects Model\n\nResults and conclusions: Using monosynaptic rabies tracing we found prominent innervation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) projecting LHb neurons originating in LH. Using fibre photometry, we found neuronal activity of these VTA projecting LHb neurons decreased in hungry animals during the retrieval of regular rodent chow rewards (homeostatic feeding) and in sated animals during palatable food consumption (hedonic feeding). In lean animals the magnitude of decreased neuronal firing from baseline was greatest for homeostatic food seeking compared to hedonic. Interestingly, this pattern switched when animals became obese through exposure to a cafeteria style diet. Ablation of LH inputs to the LHb increased consumption of palatable energy-dense food whereas decreased food consumption was observed when only standard (less palatable) chow was made available. Interestingly inhibition of leptin activity in the LH of obese rodents lead to similar increases in preference for palatable food and rejection of standard chow suggesting the involvement of leptin in communication between the LH and LHb. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that deficits in the LH – LHb - VTA circuit may emerge during weight gain and contribute to obesity-associated behavioural abnormalities.\n\nPoster number: PS013 (SP)\n\nTheme: Attention, motivation, behaviour\n\nIntuition and reason: activity of the heart during moral judgement\n\nAuthors: Dr Karina Arutyunova1, Dr Anastasiia Bakhchina1,2, Prof. Yuri Alexandrov1,3\n\n1 V.B. Shvyrkov Laboratory of Neural Bases of Mind, Institute of Psychology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2 A.N. Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education, Moscow, Russian Federation\n\nIntroduction: Moral judgement is an important component of adaptive social behaviour. Harmful actions are usually associated with intense negative emotions and intuitively perceived as morally wrong. On the other hand, if harming someone results in a socially desirable outcome it can be judged as permissible. Utilitarian moral judgement (for example, allowing sacrificing one person's life to save more people) can be viewed as a conflict between intuition and reason (e.g. Greene et al., 2004). In this work we consider the intuitive and rational processes of moral judgement as an integral part of individual behaviour which is based on actualization of functional systems, the dynamic organization of physiological activity in the brain and the rest of the body which results in achieving an adaptive outcome (Anokhin, 1975; Shvyrkov, 1995; Alexandrov et al., 2000). This approach suggests that the heart is actively involved in the organisation of behaviour, and its activity should reflect the interplay between intuition and reason when making social judgements. In this work we tested a hypothesis that the dynamics of heart activity is different when individuals make utilitarian and non-utilitarian moral judgements.\n\nMethods: ECG was recorded in 58 adult participants while they were evaluating permissibility of harmful actions in a set of moral dilemmas, including the traditional Trolley and Footbridge dilemmas. RR-intervals were analysed to describe the dynamics of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) indexes.\n\nAnalysis approach: HR and HRV indexes were compared using t-test and Mann-Whitney test (significance at p<0.05) in situations when participants responded with utilitarian and non-utilitarian judgements.\n\nResults and conclusions: Utilitarian moral judgements were accompanied by shorter RR-intervals, indicating higher HR, than non-utilitarian judgements (see Figure below). Lower HR had previously been reported to accompany the feelings of empathy and compassion to suffering others (Stellar et al., 2015). Lower HR in case of non-utilitarian judgements is consistent with the view on the role of negative social emotions, such as harm aversion, in moral judgement (e.g. Crockett et al., 2010). Overall, the results show that the intuitive and rational components of moral judgement are reflected in heart activity.

Research into current and potential antidepressant therapies does not often take this symptom into consideration. Given the renewed interest and potential efficacy of mu, kappa and delta opioid receptors (MOR, KOR and DOR respectively) in the treatment of affective disorders [1] we aimed to examine the 12eutrally12ve effects of opioid modulators in a rat IFN-α depression model. We investigated the effects of specific opioid receptor modulators (MOR agonist: RDC 2944 (0.5–0.1mg/kg); KOR antagonist: DIPPA (1.0–2.5mg/kg); and DOR: SNC 80 (1.0-5mg/kg)) alone, or in combination, on IFN-α-induced cognitive dysfunction.\n\nIFN-α/saline treated male Sprague Dawley rats (170,000 IU, IFN-α or saline (0.9%) 3 times per week for 4 weeks) were examined in the novel object exploration task as a measure of cognitive function [1]. Briefly, animals were habituated to the arena before the sample phase where animals were exposed to 3 identical objects for 3x5min sessions with 5min intertrial intervals. 24hr later one object was exchanged for a novel object and the animals explored for another 5min in the test phase. DIPPA/vehicle was administered (s.c.) 23.5hr before test. RDC 2944, SNC 80 or vehicle were administered (s.c.) 30min before test. Data were analysed by regular or repeated measures one-or two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparison tests, where appropriate. Vehicle treated IFN-α rats were significantly impaired in the novel object exploration task compared to vehicle treated saline controls (***p<0.0001). The DOR agonist, SNC 80 (5mg/kg) alone recovered IFN-α-induced deficits in the novel object exploration task (*p<0.05). Combinations of DIPPA 2.5mg/kg & SNC 80 3mg/kg, DIPPA 2.5mg/kg & SNC 80 5mg/kg or SNC 80 (3mg/kg) & RDC2944 (0.5mg/kg) each recovered IFN-α-induced cognitive deficits (**p<0.001, **p<0.001 and *p<0.05 respectively).\n\nTogether this data suggests opioid receptor modulation should be explored as a protagonist for depression related cognitive dysfunction.\n\n1.\n\nCallaghan, C.K., et al., Antidepressant-like effects of 3-carboxamido seco-nalmefene (3CS-nalmefene), a novel opioid receptor modulator, in a rat IFN-alpha-induced depression model.

While the hallmark spike-wave discharges seen in absence seizures arise from disturbances within the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) network, the underlying mechanisms are unclear and appear to be multifactorial. Current antiepileptic drugs fail to suppress seizures in over 30% of patients. Hence, there is a need to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying seizure generation in patients from different genetic backgrounds. We recently reported reduced cortical AMPA receptor expression (predominantly GluA4-containing AMPARs) in parvalbumin-containing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons in the somatosensory cortex of the well-established stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy. Fast spiking PV+ interneurons are responsible for feed-forward inhibition, which is essential to prevent runaway excitation within the brain. The aim of the current study was to investigate AMPAR subunit changes occurring during postnatal development to determine when these changes occur relative to seizure onset and thus if they could be contributory to seizure generation.\n\nMethods: Quantitative western blotting was used to investigate the expression of AMPAR GluA1–4 subunits in the somatosensory cortex of epileptic stargazer and non-epileptic (NE) control mice at three critical time points; two before seizure onset (postnatal days (PN) 7–9 and 13–15), and one at seizure onset (PN17–18) in stargazers. Protein bands were analysed using Odyssey Image Studio Lite v3.1, with the relative intensity of each protein band normalized against its corresponding β-actin loading control band.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Statistical differences in AMPAR expression levels between stargazers and their NE control littermates were tested using unpaired Mann–Whitney U test in GraphPad Prism 7.0, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.\n\nResults and Conclusions: Data analyses revealed a significant reduction in expression of AMPARs containing GluA1, 3 and 4 subunits but not GluA2 prior to seizure onset in the stargazers; reduction in GluA2-AMPARs occurred post-seizure. We conclude that while loss of GluA4-containing AMPARs (which are predominantly expressed in feedforward PV+ inhibitory interneurons and would therefore lead to dysfunctional feedforward inhibition) may be linked to seizure induction, the loss of GluA2-AMPARs is a secondary post-seizure change, which is most likely involved in seizure maintenance.\n\nPoster number: PS016 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nMaternal vitamin d deficiency increases postnatal anxiety behaviour, changes proliferation and differentiation and epigenetic markers\n\nAuthors: Ms Gulden Madi1, Dr. Maria Toledo-Rodriguez1, Dr. Preeti Jethwa2\n\n1 University Of Nottingham, School of Life Sciences, Nottingham, United Kingdom, 2 University of Nottingham, School of Biosciences, Nottingham, United Kingdom\n\nExposure to sufficient vitamin D during early development is thought to be critical for neurodevelopment and yet the number of women of childbearing age deemed to have vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is increasing. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of maternal VDD on postnatal neurodevelopment and explore the potential mechanism.\n\nVirgin female C57BL/6J mice were fed a vitamin D sufficient (2.2IU D/g; CD) or deficient (0.0 IU D/g; VDD) diet for 6 weeks prior to being mated. At weaning offspring remained on their maternal diet for a further 8 weeks. At 8 weeks of age, spatial Learning and memory was investigated by spontaneous alternation while anxiety was measured using the elevated plus maze. At the end of the study, brains were dissected for: a) gene expression analysis of neurotrophins and epigenetic markers in hippocampus and hypothalamus, and b) immunohistochemistry to assess proliferation (Ki67) and differentiation (doublecortin) in dentate gyrus and sub ventricular zone. Four sections per animal were used for quantification in the dentate gyrus and sub ventricular zone. Images were analysed using ImageJ 1.43. All gene expression data was analysed using unpaired t-tests, using Prism 7 and significance threshold was set to P<0.05.\n\nMice exposed to VDD significantly increased anxiety like behaviour (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference in memory and learning (P=0.09) compared to CD offspring. Moreover, a significant increase in Ki67 immunoreactivity (IR) was observed in the sub ventricular zone of 8 weeks old males compared to CD offspring group (p<0.001). However, no significant changes were observed in doublecortin-IR in both tissues. Expression of neurotrophin genes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; P<0.05) and VGF (P<0.0001) and, methylation markers KDM5A (P<0.001), KDM6B (P<0.001), UTX (p<0.001) and TH (P<0.05) but not Ezh2 was significantly increased in VDD offspring group compared to CD group of the 8 weeks old males.\n\nVDD during early development promotes anxiety like behaviour in adult offspring, possibly due to modified proliferation and differentiation of neurones within the hippocampus. This may be associated with changes in the methylation of genes, ultimately leading to perturbed anxiety and memory.\n\nPoster number: PS017 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nDo maternal glucocorticoids transmit the programming effects of maternal stress to the fetus?\n\nAuthors: Ms Ying Sze1,2, Ms Joana Fernandes1,2, Dr Paula Brunton1,2\n\n1 Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, University Of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 2 The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n\nDespite attenuated hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to acute stress in pregnancy, chronic maternal social stress still exerts negative programming effects on the offspring. The mechanisms by which this occurs remains unclear, but excess maternal glucocorticoid transfer to the fetus could play a possible role. Local concentrations of glucocorticoids are modulated by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD) enzymes. In the placenta, 11βHSD2 converts corticosterone (CORT) into the inactive metabolite 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC), regulating glucocorticoid transfer across the maternal-fetal interface; whilst in the brain, 11βHSD1 converts 11-DHC to CORT, regulating local glucocorticoid synthesis.\n\nPregnant rats were exposed to 10min social stress/day via the resident-intruder paradigm, from day 16–20 of pregnancy. Rats were killed following the final bout of stress and blood/tissues collected. Concentrations of CORT and 11-DHC in the maternal and fetal plasma, placenta, fetal brain and liver were quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In situ hybridisation was performed to quantify mRNA expression for 11βHSD2 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the placenta, and 11βHSD1 in the fetal brain. Data were analysed by two-way ANOVA.\n\nPlasma corticosterone concentrations were 3.7-fold greater in the stressed dams compared to controls. Maternal stress significantly increased circulating corticosterone concentrations in the female fetuses (1.3-fold), but not in the males. Similar changes were observed for plasma 11-DHC concentrations. CORT concentrations were significantly greater in the liver of both male (1.4-fold) and female fetuses (1.3-fold) following maternal stress; however no changes were detected in the fetal brain. Corticosterone concentrations and 11βHSD2 mRNA expression were significantly greater in male, but not female placentae, from stressed dams compared with controls; with no changes in placental GR mRNA expression in either sex. 11βHSD1 mRNA expression was greater only in the female fetal hippocampus after stress.\n\nIn conclusion, although repeated social stress activates the maternal HPA axis, the placental barrier appears intact, especially in the males, and the direct transfer of corticosterone from the maternal to fetal circulation is minimal. However, some changes in corticosterone metabolism still occur in the fetal liver and fetal brain. The data suggest that maternal glucocorticoids could exert effects on fetal glucocorticoid metabolism, but probably in an indirect, and sex-dependent manner.\n\nPoster number: PS018 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nModelling of retinal mosaic formation using an agent-based model\n\nAuthors: Mr Jean de Montigny1, Prof. Evelyne Sernagor1, Dr. Roman Bauer2\n\n1 Newcastle University - Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom, 2 Newcastle University - School of Computing, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n\nIndividual retinal cell types exhibit semi-regular spatial patterns called retinal mosaics. These mosaics, enabling uniform sampling of visual information, are formed to varying degrees across cell subtypes. Retinal ganglion cells (RGC), amacrine, horizontal and photoreceptor cells are known to exhibit such layouts. In addition to cell body mosaics, dendritic arbours also form mosaics - dendrites of homotypic cells exhibit avoidance while dendrites of different types overlap.\n\nMechanisms responsible for the formation of such organised structures are still not well understood and they follow three main theories. (1) Homotypic cells prevent nearby cells from adopting the same type. (2) Cell tangential migration, with homotypic cells repulsing each other. (3) Cell death, with specific cell types (mainly RGCs) exhibiting high rates of apoptosis, increasing spatial regularity.\n\nHere, we use BioDynaMo, an agent-based simulation framework, to build a detailed and mechanistic computational model of mosaic formation in 3D physical space. In particular, we investigate the implications of the three theories and their combinations.\n\nTo compare mosaics we use the regularity index, calculated by dividing closest average homo-type cell distance by the standard deviation.\n\nWe show that cell movement mechanism yields the most regular mosaics. Moreover, the longest cellular migration distance achieved in these simulations is in agreement with experimental observations. We also found that even if cell fate alone cannot create regular mosaics, it can enhance the mosaic regularity in combination with other mechanisms. Furthermore, we found that cell death can create regular mosaics only if 55–80% of the cells undergo apoptosis. Such alevel of cell death precisely matches experimental findings, reporting 60–80% apoptosis in the RGC population. Finally, simulations of dendritic growth suggest a relationship between somatic mosaics and dendritic arbours morphology.\n\nBauer, R., Breitwieser, L., Di Meglio, A., Johard, L., Kaiser, M., Manca, M., Mazzara, M., Rademakers, F., Talanov, M. and Tchitchigin, A.D., 2017.

The critical role that interneurons play within their circuits has been highlighted by their implication in different pathologies. This emphasises the need to unravel the mysteries behind human interneuron diversity. By identifying genes that underpin interneuron subtype heterogeneity, we could better understand why specific subtypes are vulnerable in neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, this knowledge could be applied in vitro to direct interneurons towards a desired subtype. Here we describe the use of single cell mRNA sequencing (Fluidigm C1 RNA seq workflow), combined with immunohistochemistry, to determine the single cell expression profiles of human interneurons from early progenitor to late post-mitotic stages of development. This analysis was completed in reference to “authentic” inhibitory interneurons derived from the human medial ganglionic eminence (one of the main sources of interneurons in the foetal brain), and those derived in vitro from human embryonic stem cells. All human foetal tissue samples were obtained through voluntary abortions, and collected ages spanned from 9 to 15 weeks post-conception. Human embryonic stem cell derived interneurons were matured in vitro until post-mitotic stage.\n\nRepeated measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test, was carried out to determine significant changes in marker expression over time. Single cell RNA seq analysis was performed using SINGuLAR Analysis Toolset. This included principal component analysis (PCA), which determined variation within each age group, and identified subpopulations. Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified differentially expressed genes between these subpopulations, and temporal changes in gene expression between age groups.\n\nHeterogeneity can be seen from early stages of interneuron development, with clustering of interneuron progenitors into subpopulations. By late development, transcriptomic profiles continued to diversify creating more distinct clusters (representing specific interneuron subtypes). This interneuron diversity and temporal changes were mirrored in both sources of interneurons, and confirmed at the protein level for the selected markers. Through this study we have identified candidate transcription factors that could be driving interneuron subtype diversity. Further work, using transcriptional activator dCas9 system, will be needed to directly determine the influence each candidate gene has on interneuron development in vitro.\n\nPoster number: PS020 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nAltered VEP responses to illusory contours in children on the autism spectrum\n\nAuthors: Dr Evan Myers1, Mr. Zhewei Cao1, Mr. Eric Nicholas1, Dr. Edward Freedman1, Dr. John Foxe1\n\n1 University Of Rochester, Rochester, Ny, United States\n\nIntroduction: Perception of an object despite its incomplete presentation by ‘filling in’ missing segments is a fundamental visual process permitting recognition of objects that are partially occluded. This same process can lead to the illusory perception of contours, for example when showing Kanizsa figure stimuli consisting of equidistant ‘Pac-Man’ inducers. When these are oriented at a random rotational angle no illusory contour is observed, yet when oriented, as if they were the corners of a square, a completed square is reported. Two consistent effects occur when comparing EEG responses to presentation of these stimuli: [1] an increased amplitude in the N1/N170 peak, dubbed the IC-effect and [2] a sustained increased negative shift between 230 – 450ms, termed the ‘negativity for closure’ (Ncl) component. Both the IC-effect and Ncl component are most prominent from electrodes positioned over the lateral occipital cortex (LOC). Atypical sensory processing has been frequently reported in individuals with autism and are often correlated with symptom severity. Furthermore children diagnosed with an ASD show attenuated boundary detection.\n\nThe current study is an investigation of the VEP response following illusory contour versus no contour stimuli in neuro-typical (NT) compared to ASD children\n\nMethods: Participants sitting in front of an LCD monitor were instructed to fixate on a central red target and to press a button following a brief color change to green. IC and NC stimuli were presented randomly for 80ms with an average frequency of once-per-second.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Analysis of our EEG data using EEGLAB software thus far provides evidence of a differential VEP profile comparing the two groups.\n\nResults and conclusions: In particular, we observe an attenuated IC-effect and Ncl component in the ASD group as compared to the NT group. Thus, this seemingly dampened contour perception may provide a neurophysiological marker of ASD as well as insight into the underlying differences in sensory processing in children on the spectrum.\n\nPoster number: PS021 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nThe anti-inflammatory peptide pat has no adverse effect on zebrafish embryonic development\n\nAuthors: Prof. Bared Safieh-Garabedian1, Dr. Michail Nomikos1, Ms Malaz Elaidiq1,3, Mr Alaaeldin Saleh1, Prof. F. Anthony Lai1,3, Dr. Gheyath Nasrallah2,3\n\n1 College of Medicine, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, 2 College of Health Sciences, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, 3 Biomedical Research Center, Qatar Univesity, Doha, Qatar\n\nIntroduction: The synthetic peptide analogue of thymulin (PAT) has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in animal models. However, as a potential therapeutic agent, its toxicity on the early developmental stages has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we have the used zebrafish embryo model to evaluate any potential adverse effect of PAT on early developmental stages.\n\nMethods: Mortality, teratogenicity, cardiotoxicity, locomotion and neurotoxicity, as well as hatching rate were employed to investigate any potential acute cytotoxic effects of PAT.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Our findings showed that exposure to different doses of PAT (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μM) do not induce any morphological or behavioral alterations in zebrafish embryos. The median lethal dose (LC50) and the no and the low observe effect concentration (NOEC) of PAT could not be calculated as no significant (>20%) mortality were recorded at any of the tested concentration. No significant teratogenic effects (including yolk and hear edema, scoliosis, eye and body size) were observed, suggesting that the low observe effect concentration (LOEC) was greater than the highest tested dose (100 μM). As the LOEC could not be calculated, we decided to use the 100 μM in all of the following toxicity assays. The hatching rate experiment showed that there was no delay on the hatching time of the PAT- treated embryos compared to the negative control (p>0.05), suggesting that PAT has no general detrimental effect on zebrafish embryo development. Furthermore, our results indicated that PAT does not induce any significant cardiovascular toxicity via examining the embryos’ cardiac functions, including heart rate (beat per minute) (p>0.5), blood velocity (p>0.5), and diameter of blood vessels, compared to the negative control. Locomotion of the treated zebrafish embryos were also not affected, when assessed by spontaneous tail flick activity of the PAT-treated embryos compared to negative control (p>0.5), suggesting that PAT has no adverse effect on neuromuscular development of the zebrafish embryos.\n\nResults and conclusions: In this study and taken together the results of the aforementioned toxicity assays, we provide evidence that besides its evolving therapeutic applications, PAT does not cause toxicity or adverse complications in zebrafish at early developmental stages.\n\nPoster number: PS022 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nNeural mechanisms of face-processing – an fMRI-study in 6- to 9-year-old healthy children\n\nAuthors: Ms Franziska Hildesheim1, Ms Isabell Debus1, Ms Kirstin Zimmermann1, Prof. Dr. Rudolf Stark2, Prof. Dr. Andreas Jansen1\n\n1Laboratory for Multimodal Neuroimaging, Philipps-University Marburg, Marburg, Germany, 2Bender Institute of Neuroimaging, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Giessen, Germany\n\nThe identification of facial expressions plays a key role in human social interaction. Although many studies have shed light on the neural network underlying face-processing in adults, only little is known about the neural correlates in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the core face-processing network (Fusiform face area, FFA; Occipital face area, OFA and posterior Superior temporal sulcus, pSTS) and the extended face-processing network (e.g. amygdala and orbito-frontal cortex) are already fully developed in children and correlate with the location of face-processing regions in adults. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate whether amygdala activity, which plays a central role in processing of emotions, can be robustly detected.\n\nFunctional brain activation for face-processing in 11 children (3 females, 8 males) aged between 6 and 9 years was being compared to activation in 10 adult subjects. Subjects were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a Siemens Prisma 3-Tesla Magnetom using a 64-channel brain array coil. During fMRI scanning subjects were presented a set of stimuli composed of images of male and female faces with neutral, sad and fearful facial expressions. Additionally, houses were presented as control stimuli. fMRI data were analysed using the software Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12). For normalisation of children data the toolbox CerebroMatic (implemented in SPM12) was applied. Statistical analyses were performed using General Linear Models (GLMs). Our analyses showed that the face-processing network is already well-developed in 6- to 9-year-old children. The core-network can be solidly portrayed on single-subject-level, showing robust bilateral activation of FFA, OFA and STS. However, the location and lateralization of the face-processing regions tends to be more variable in children compared to adults. Amygdala activity could be observed during face-processing in contrast to house-processing in some children. These results suggest that this paradigm can be applied to patients diagnosed with autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD) for generating a deeper understanding of their defective social interactions. We now use connectivity analyses (in particular, Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM)) to also assess the connectivity pattern in the face processing network.\n\nPoster number: PS023 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nSearch organisation in multi-target displays can predict educational outcomes in children\n\nAuthors: Dr Edwin Dalmaijer1, Mr Giacomo Bignardi1, Mr Alexander Irvine1, Dr Duncan Astle1\n\n1 MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: The ability to organise one's search is an important skill, at least to those of us who frequently have to resort to running around the house after losing keys, phone, or other crucial items. In cognitive neuropsychology, tests of multi-target search organisation are frequently employed, and thought to reflect executive function. Here, we present the findings of a large (N>500) study in children aged 5–7.\n\nMethods: Participants were tested with a custom-built cognitive testing suite that assessed (among other functions) verbal and spatial short-term memory, fluid reasoning, reading and maths fluency, and search organisation. The latter was tested using a multi-target visual search task, in which participants had to locate all targets among distractors. In one version, targets would be visibly marked off, and in another participants had to rely on memory.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: We employed dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and k-means clustering on search duration data from the marked and non-marked tasks. In addition, we employed structural equation modelling to test what structures of latent factors could best explain the observed data from the following variables: verbal short-term memory (digit recall accuracy), spatial short-term memory (dot matrix accuracy), fluid reasoning (Cattell Culture Fair series and classification sub-tests), search organisation (best R, intersection rate, and inter-target distance for visibly marked search), processing speed (inter-target time for both search tasks), reading proficiency (number of sentences correctly read in two minutes), and maths proficiency (number of correct sums in two minutes).\n\nResults and conclusions: We found a reliable cluster solution with three groups characterised by quick search on both search tasks, slow search on both search tasks, and quick search only when targets were visibly marked. Two of the groups differed only on duration of the non-marked task, but these groups were of similar spatial short-term memory. They did differ in search organisation scores and educational outcomes. Our structural equation modelling suggested that short-term memory and search organisation were the main predictors of educational outcomes. In sum, search organisation is a simple and engaging test that explains unique variance in educational outcome measures.\n\nPoster number: PS024 (SP)\n\nTheme: Developmental neuroscience\n\nModelling the developing brain: Joint estimation of neonatal brain tissue shape and intensity from the developing Human Connectome Project\n\nAuthors: Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh1, Dr Emma Robinson1, Prof Mary Rutherford1, Dr Maximillian Pietsch1, Dr Rui Pedro AG Teixeira1, Dr Dafnis Batalle1, Dr Jelena Božek4, Dr Andreas Schuh2, Dr Antonios Makropoulos2, Dr Emer Hughes1, Dr Lucilio Cordero-Grande1, Dr Anthony Price1, Prof Stephen Smith3, Prof Jo Hajnal1, Prof Daniel Rueckert2, Prof Serena Counsell1, Prof A David Edwards1\n\n1 King's College London, London, United Kingdom, 2 Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom, 3 Oxford University, London, United Kingdom, 4 University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nIntroduction: Over the perinatal period, brain development is rapid and nonlinear [Makropoulos et al, 2016]. This represents a challenge when investigating clinical perinatal injury using MRI. Parametric statistical models of brain growth models can help, but often rely on strong assumptions. Here; we used a Bayesian non-parametric model estimation technique, Gaussian process regression (GPR), with multiple outputs [Álvarez & Laurence, 2011], to continuously estimate the intensity and shape of T1 and T2-weighted MR images over the perinatal period.\n\nMethods: MRI data reported here were collected as part of the developing Human Connectome Project, described in Makropoulos et al. [2018]. The sample was 424 individual neonates (194 female) across a wide range of ages at scan (26 to 45 weeks post-menstrual age) and ages at birth (24–42 weeks).\n\nAnalysis Approach: T1 and T2 weighted volumes were non-linearly registered to a single common template space [Avants et al, 2011]. The GPy package (https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) was used for model design and fit. At every voxel, a GPR model (with 5-fold cross-validation) was estimated with age-at-scan, age-at-birth and sex as predictors and T1w / T2w image intensity and the deformations to template space as outputs. To investigate the clinical utility of these models, we manually outlined punctate white matter lesions (PWML) in a sub-sample of 40 neonates.\n\nResults and Conclusion: The resulting model provided a continuous voxelwise prediction of brain shape and intensity changes. These predictions illustrate post-natal development; continuous changes in size, intensity and gyrification. In the 40 neonates with PWML, we calculated receiver-operating-characteristic curves (ROC) to test performance of the GPR model for detecting voxels containing manually labelled PWMLs. The GPR model provided a mean area-under-the-ROC of 0.95 (median 0.98).\n\nThe model shows good accuracy, especially in white matter. This framework permits single-subject inference of deviations in tissue intensity and shape changes, appropriate to the age and sex, and sensitive to pathology in individual neonates.\n\nReferences\n\nÁlvarez and Lawrence, (2011).

EHMT1 and SETD1A, which methylate lysine-9 and lysine-4 of histone H3 respectively, are such neurodevelopmental disorder genes. Mutations in these genes that result in loss of function of one copy are therefore likely to alter histone modifications and regulation of other genes. We want to examine these effects on gene expression in a mouse model using RNA-seq.\n\nWe will compare gene expression in the brains of Ehmt1 heterozygous knockout (n=6; 3 male, 3 female) to wild-type mice (n=6; 3 male, 3 female) at E13.5. This neurodevelopmental timepoint was chosen because it represents the peak of Ehmt1 expression in the brain. RNA will be extracted, and libraries prepared using KAPA mRNA hyperprep. RNA-seq will be performed in-house using an Illumina HiSeq 4000.\n\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) will be compared using Fishers method and corrected for multiple test using Bonferroni. DEG datasets will also be examined for functional enrichment using Gene Ontology analysis where the probability of observing the number of DEGs in any given biological pathway is greater than or equal to the one observed by random chance. This will be calculated using Fishers method. Similarly, mouse Entrez IDs will be converted to human homologues and enrichment analysis performed to look for over-representation of genetic risk factors contributing to developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Finally, we will examine whether there is an overlapping molecular mechanism of action in the loss of function of one copy Ehmt1 and Setd1a, by comparing our data to existing RNA-seq data from a Setd1a mouse model also generated in the lab.\n\nPoster number: PS026 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nInvestigating chromatin accessibility across human gabaergic interneuron differentiation\n\nAuthors: Mr George Andrew Inglis1, Dr. Ying Zhou2,3, Mr. Dillon Patterson4, Dr. Christopher Scharer4, Dr. Jeremy Boss4, Dr. Zhexing Wen2,3, Dr. Andrew Escayg1\n\n1 Department of Human Genetics, Emory University, Atlanta, USA, 2 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, USA, 3 Department of Cell Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, USA, 4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University, Atlanta, USA\n\nIntroduction: Inhibitory GABAergic interneurons play a critical role in the maintenance of normal brain function, and interneuron dysfunction has been directly linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. However, little is known about the noncoding genetic regulatory elements that establish key expression pathways necessary for proper interneuron function. While ATAC-seq and other strategies to identify genetic enhancer elements have been performed on samples from different human brain regions or organoids, use of these heterogeneous samples may mask putative genetic elements that are exclusive to GABAergic interneurons. To better identify the genetic elements and pathways involved in interneuron development, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to GABAergic interneurons and harvested cells at three developmental stages for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq.\n\nMethods: Human iPSC lines were derived from two healthy male subjects. iPSCs patterned to the ventral forebrain fate were differentiated to GABAergic interneurons with ∼80% efficiency. Cells were collected for ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis at three developmental time points: neural progenitor cells (NPCs), immature interneurons (4 weeks post-differentiation) and mature interneurons (8 weeks post-differentiation).\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: We performed ATAC-seq on 2–3 replicates at each of the three developmental time points, for both iPSC lines (n=17). RNA-seq was performed on one iPSC line, with 2–3 replicates per time point (n=8). We used Bowtie2 and Cufflinks to map sequencing reads to the human genome (hg38), and MACS2 and Bioconductor to annotate reads and call peaks. Differentially accessible regions (DARs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on FDR<0.05 and FC≥2. A subset of DEGs were validated by qRT-PCR.\n\nResults and conclusions: We found significant, widespread changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression between each development time point, regardless of the iPSC line. We are currently analyzing the correlation between DARs and DEGs, as well as the identifying any transcription factor networks altered over the course of differentiation. Altogether, these results will provide important information on the genetic elements and pathways involved in GABAergic interneuron development. Future research could examine the specific contributions of specific DARs to gene expression, and target these elements to modulate GABAergic interneuron activity.\n\nPoster number: PS027 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nCaenorhabditis elegans as a genetic model for alcohol addiction\n\nAuthors: Dr Jeff Barclay1\n\n1 University Of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: Addiction to alcohol is a worldwide medical and social problem. Consumption is causally related to a multitude of diseases such as cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, depression, neurodegeneration and dementia; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood.\n\nTo investigate all components of alcohol addiction requires long-term experimental manipulation and analysis of a whole-animal model. Excessive consumption and the consequent acquisition of dependence is partly determined by genetics and a major component of that genetic determinism is an individual's initial level of response. Here we characterise the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a whole-animal genetic model to investigate the neuronal effects of alcohol abuse and addiction. These assays allow us to investigate and compare genetic, environmental and pharmacological contributions to specific neuronal alcohol phenotypes over the entire lifespan of the organism.\n\nMethods: C. elegans strains were grown and analysed under standard growth conditions. Genetic manipulations included forward genetics, RNAi, transgenics and gene editing. Phenotyping involved existing and novel assays performed over a broad range of ethanol concentrations.\n\nApproach for Statistical Analysis: All data were compared by t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with an appropriate post-hoc test for multiple comparisons.\n\nResults and Conclusions: Our experiments using C. elegans have been able to model a broad spectrum of alcohol phenotypes including low-alcohol-induced stimulation of the nervous system separate from high-alcohol-induced depression of the nervous system, alcohol-induced neuronal stress and progressive neurodegeneration and also behavioural plasticity phenotypes including alcohol preference and alcohol aversion.\n\nFrom these results we have corroborated targets identified from human genetic association studies and GWAS, such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and β-klotho. Additionally, we have identified and characterised novel targets such as neuronal α-crystallin proteins and their associated cellular signalling pathways that respond to exogenous alcohol. These well characterised neuronal phenotypes can now be used as a whole-animal platform for larger-scale investigations into the mechanisms of addiction and future pharmacological interventions.\n\nPoster number: PS028 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nDNA methylation changes associated with symptom improvement in response to clozapine - a longitudinal EWAS study in treatment resistant schizophrenia\n\nAuthors: Dr Amy Gillespie1,3, Dr Eilis Hannon2, Dr Alice Egerton3, Prof Jonathan Mill2, Dr James MacCabe3\n\n1 University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom, 2 University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom, 3 King's College London, London, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: For patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine is the only evidence based treatment available. However, despite substantial research, we lack a full understanding of the processes underlying clozapine's unique efficacy. Animal studies indicate that clozapine influences histone modification and DNA methylation (dynamic “epigenetic” modifications), and a cross-sectional human study identified multiple differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in clozapine-exposed samples. Our aim was to examine longitudinal, within-participant DNA methylation changes over the first 6 months of clozapine use, associated with symptom improvement.\n\nMethods: We recruited 30+ participants with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, before clozapine prescription. We then collected whole-blood samples at baseline and follow-up (6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months after clozapine initiation), alongside clinical assessments of symptoms. We quantified whole-blood DNA methylation at ∼ 480,000 sites across the genome using the Illumina 450 K HumanMethylation array.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Following pre-processing, normalization and quality control, multi-level regression models identified associations between DMPs and changes in symptoms. Continuous measures of within-participant changes in PANSS symptoms - total, positive and negative– were used. Models controlled for age, sex, predicted cell counts, smoking, batch, medication use and repeated measures. Statistical significance was set at p < 1x10-7. Results were cross-referenced with the Blood Brain DNA Methylation Comparison Tool (https://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/bloodbrain/)\n\nResults and conclusions: In preliminary analysis of the first 22 participants:\n\nFive DMPs were significantly associated with within-participant changes in total symptom severity, three of which had prior evidence of correlated methylation in brain. One DMP was located within the promoter region of GLRA1, while another was located within the promoter region of NEFM. Three DMPs were significantly associated with within-participant changes in positive symptom severity, one of which had prior evidence of correlated methylation in brain. Fourteen DMPs were significantly associated with within-participant changes in negative symptom severity, five of which had prior evidence of correlated methylation in brain; two of these were in genes involved in cell adhesion.\n\nThese results align with literature suggesting that clozapine may normalise schizophrenia-associated biological dysfunction, but require replication and further studies to establish the causal role of DNA methylation in clozapine response.\n\nPoster number: PS029 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nFunctional analysis of novel epilepsy mutations in STXBP1\n\nAuthors: Dr Bangfu Zhu1, Mr Alistair Jones1, Dr Jeff Barclay1, Dr Graeme Sills1, Prof. Alan Morgan1\n\n1 University Of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Genetics has been recognised to play an important role since some genetic variants associated with epilepsy have been identified recently. However, it is still unclear how mutations in the identified genes contribute to epilepsy.\n\nOur research has focused on STXBP1 (Syntaxin-binding protein 1) – the second most commonly mutated gene in infantile epilepsies. STXBP1 is a member of the Sec1/Munc18 family of membrane trafficking proteins essential for neurotransmitter release. Our aims are to characterise the functional effects of disease-causing mutations in STXBP1 and to search for genetic modifiers that can ameliorate the consequences of those mutations.\n\nMethods: We first made epilepsy-associated mutations in human STXBP1 and then generated transgenic C. elegans with each of the 8 selected mutations in STXBP1. These humanised animal models have been analysed for alterations in neurotransmission and behaviour by Thrashing Assays, Aldicarb experiments and Electropharyngeogram (EPG) recordings. Meanwhile, the expression levels of wild type and mutated STXBP1 were also monitored by Western blotting and qPCR.\n\nAnalysis approach: For quantification, at least 3 independent experiments were performed. For statistical comparison of two groups, two-tailed Student's t-test was performed and a value of P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n\nResults and conclusions: Our data show that 3 of the mutations in STXBP1 (namely E59K, V84D and R292H) resulted in significantly defective locomotion in worms, whereas other mutants displayed little difference with STXBP1/Munc18 wild-type. Protein expression levels decreased dramatically in all mutants compared to the wild-type STXBP1/Munc18 rescue although their transcriptional expression remained at a similar level, which suggests that STXBP1 proteins are destabilised due to mutations.\n\nAldicarb results indicate that all worms with mutations in STXBP1 show an increased response/sensitivity to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Aldicarb (i.e. a HIC phenotype) compared to N2 wild-type worms. However, EPG recordings demonstrate that all 8 mutations lead to abnormal pharyngeal electric activity with a lower frequency of pharyngeal pumpings and irregular rhythm compared with the wild-type control, which implies these mutations in STXBP1 may cause epilepsy by altering electrophysiology of neurons in the brain.\n\nPoster number: PS030 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nMicrornas as mechanistically and clinically relevant biomarkers for temporal lobe epilepsy\n\nAuthors: Dr Thomas Hill1,2, Dr Gary Brennan1,2, Dr Sebastian Bauer3,4, Dr Tobias Engel1,2, Dr Eva Jimenez-Mateos5, Dr Cristina Ruedell Reschke1,2, Elizabeth Brindley1, Beatrice Salvetti6, Frederico Del Gallo6, Dr Rana Raoof1,7, Dr Hany El Nagger1,8, Dr Niamh Connolly1, Prof. Norman Delanty1,2,8, Prof. Jochen Prehn1,2, Prof. Paolo Fabene6, Prof. Felix Rosenow3,4, Dr Catherine Mooney2,9, Prof. David Henshall1,2\n\n1 Department of Physiology & Medical Physics, Royal College Of Surgeons In Ireland, Dublin, Ireland, 2 FutureNeuro Research Centre, Dublin, Ireland, 3 Epilepsy Center Hessen, Department of Neurology, Marburg, Germany, 4 Epilepsy Center Frankfurt Rhine-Main, Neurocenter, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany, 5 School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, 6 Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Italy, 7 Department of Anatomy, Mosul Medical College, University of Mosul, Iraq, 8 Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, 9 School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Ireland\n\nIntroduction: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate translation of proteins and show potential as biomarkers of epilepsy. In recent studies the altered expression profiles of microRNAs have been reported in models of epilepsy. Here we propose a set of microRNAs as mechanistically relevant biomarkers for temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nMethods: Blood samples were collected and processed to obtain plasma at multiple time-points from three status epilepticus-based experimental models of temporal lobe epilepsy. MicroRNA profiling was performed using the OpenArray platform which provides genome-wide coverage of all rodent microRNAs. Biomarker performance was supported by analysis of plasma samples from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. To test whether antiepileptic drugs interfered with these biomarkers animals with epilepsy were treated with AEDs twice daily (IP) for 3 days and plasma was analysed for changes in microRNA expression. In a separate study, we tested whether these miRNAs responded to an anti-epileptogenic treatment, injecting mice with an oligonucleotide antagomir targeting miR-134 shortly after status epilepticus and measuring miRNAs levels in plasma 2 weeks later.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: For experiments consisting of two groups a Students t-test was undertaken. For experiments consisting of more than two groups a one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Dunnett's test was employed.\n\nResults and conclusions: Thirteen of the twenty most abundant microRNAs were common between the models, including miR-19b, miR-24 and miR-223. A total of 74 microRNAs were shared in all three models in samples from rodents with epilepsy, which included brain-restricted microRNAs not present in baseline samples. We validated a set of three up- and down-regulated microRNAs in epilepsy samples which were fully conserved between models. Levels of the three microRNAs were similarly dysregulated in plasma from people with temporal lobe epilepsy. The expression of the three microRNAs were not affected by the currently available treatments, but were normalised by the disease-modifying microRNA-based therapy.\n\nThis study provides strong support for plasma microRNAs as conserved, mechanistic molecular biomarkers of temporal lobe epilepsy. It also demonstrates that our biomarkers are sensitive to the underlying disease and not to seizures alone.\n\nPoster number: PS031 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nBeyond C4: Cognitive analysis of a complement gene pathway enriched for IQ in an Irish Sample\n\nAuthors: Ms Jessica Holland1, Dr Donna Cosgrove1, Dr. Denise Harold2, Dr David Mothershill1, Prof Aiden Corvin2, Dr Derek Morris1, Prof Gary Donohoe1\n\n1 NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland, 2 Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland\n\nIntroduction: In the largest Genome wide Association Study (GWAS) of Schizophrenia (SZ) to date, the strongest association with SZ was found at a region of the genome that is synonymous with immune function1. Although several studies have supported the relationship between immune genetics and SZ, few have examined the effect of these genetics in relation to cognition2. Cognitive impairment can be predictive of functional outcome in SZ, with immune variants linked to deficits in general cognition and episodic memory2. The current study analyses the effects of immune challenge on cognition, examining a set of genes related to complement, and how these are enriched for cognition or schizophrenia risk.\n\nMethods: To test if genetic variants related to immune function impair cognition, a gene set corresponding to complement function was chosen from previous literature. This complement gene set was tested for enrichment for the phenotypes of IQ and SZ using MAGMA. This gene set was then brought forward for analysis in an Irish sample.\n\nAnalysis approach: Using PRSice, a PRS was computed for the complement pathway (34 genes). Block regression analysis was performed in SPSS, testing a relationship between PRS and cognition in 1238 schizophrenia sufferers and healthy controls.\n\nResults and conclusions: Enrichment analysis suggests that the genes in the complement pathway are enriched for the phenotype of IQ (p=0.017). In analysing individual genes within the path, Complement factor H (CFH) was found to be highly enriched for the phenotype of IQ. Regression analysis suggests that the complement pathway contributes to variation in IQ (p=0.037), but this finding did not survive multiple testing correction. Across analyses, an association between the complement pathway and IQ was observed. The complement cascade may be an important target for study in relation to cognition in SZ, and could further elucidate aetiology of this disorder.\n\n1.\n\nPouget, J. G. (2018).

It is expected that a significant proportion of causal genetic variants of NDDs are rare and highly penetrant, de novo (arising spontaneously) or inherited variants (Gaugler et al., 2014). Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) allows analysis of all variant classes, frequencies and sizes across the genome. We aim to: 1. use WGS to identify putative pathogenic variants for NDDs using a family study approach; 2. evaluate the clinical significance of rare, segregating, putatively pathogenic variants in our families; 3. compare the putatively pathogenic variants identified within each family and perform inter-family analysis to identify enriched pathways/networks.\n\nMethods: A cohort of multiplex extended families with one or more individuals affected with an NDD will be ascertained in Ireland (diagnosed to DSM-V standards). Samples will be selected for WGS from the cohort following genotyping to exclude probands with chromosomal abnormalities. One hundred genomic DNA samples (affected and unaffected) will undergo WGS to a target depth of 30X. Sequence reads will be aligned and single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion variants (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs) will be called and processed. Variant filtration will be carried out as per .\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: The resulting rare pathogenic variants ( ) will undergo statistical analysis to investigate disorder association. TADA (transmission and de novo association), a weighted, statistical model integrating de novo, transmitted and case-control variation will be run to increase power of association within families. Gene set enrichment analysis will compare cohort variants with previously associated NDD variants. Gene Network and Protein-Protein interaction analysis will investigate the burden of variants on pathways. Enrichment analysis will interrogate bias in frequency of inherited and de novo variants in affected versus unaffected individuals and bias in variant distribution across the genome.\n\nReferences\n\nGaugler, T. et al.

However, misdiagnosis is common, and only 50% of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI's) in children with new focal seizures are abnormal (Gaillard et al., 2009).\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNA), small non-coding RNAs 22 nucleotides long (Bernardo et al., 2012), function as an additional layer of gene expression by regulating protein expression (MacRae, 2013). They have been proposed as biomarkers in epilepsy as many are brain enriched, involved in processes central to epileptogenesis, identifiable in body fluids, and are stable in plasma (Ma, 2017).\n\nThis study aims to fill the gap in knowledge of miRNA profiles in paediatric epilepsy, and to identify a biomarker for lesional focal epilepsy, and for non-epileptic attack disorders both in children with epilepsy and those without.\n\nMethods: Patients were divided into four groups (n=10) as follows; focal epilepsy with a normal MRI brain (Epi_FNM); focal epilepsy with an abnormal MRI (Epi_FAM); Epilepsy with non-epileptic attack disorder (Epi_N); Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) (n=3). Controls were recruited from children with no neurological disorders having blood tests for another reason ( ).\n\nStatistical analysis: Generated sequencing data was mapped to miRBase release 22 reference genome. RNA-seq analysis was performed using limma, Glimma and edgeR (Law et al., 2016). Samples with low read counts and low numbers of miRNAs called present were filtered out prior to analysis; the remaining data was then normalised to account for batch effects and other technical biases. Differential expression analysis was then performed.\n\nResults and conclusions: Seventeen miRNAs were shown to be differentially expressed between groups with an unadjusted p-value of <0.05. This study is the first to show differential expression (DE) of miRNAs between children with lesional and non-lesional focal epilepsy. These are an important biomarker as they have the potential to eliminate the need for MRIs in children with focal epilepsy. Other differentially expressed miRNAs show potential as biomarkers to diagnose both epilepsy and non-epileptic attack disorder. Importantly the majority of these DE miRNAs have been found to be DE in epilepsy in other studies and all are expressed in the brain.\n\nPoster number: PS034 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nMRNA expression profiling during status epilepticus and epilepsy\n\nAuthors: Ms Giorgia Conte1, Dr Alberto Parras2,3, Ms Ivana Ollà2, Dr Laura de Diego-Garcia1, Dr Mariana Alves1, Prof Raúl Méndez4,5, Prof. David Henshall1, Prof José J.

In the 50% of the cases the pathology is acquired after a brain injury, it is developed in three phases: first the brain insult, then epileptogenesis and finally chronic epilepsy. Prolonged Status Epilepticus (SE), stroke or Trauma brain injury (TBI) are the most common causes of acquired epilepsy. It is still poorly known which transcriptional changes occur in the different stages of the pathology. For this purpose we investigated the gene expression changes after SE and during chronic epilepsy in an epileptic mouse model.\n\nMethods: We injected kainic acid (KA) intra-amygdala to induce SE and consequently brain injury, and we performed a transcriptional profiling by microarray in mice hippocampus collected 8 hours and 14 days after SE, respectively during acute seizure and chronic epilepsy. We used this result to identify the biological pathway affected by the gene expression changes through DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8. We identified the transcription factors involved in the regulation of the gene expression using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicating cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) as the most implicated in all the conditions. A validation of the microarray results was performed by q-RT PCR. Finally, we injected KA and CREB inhibitor (666–15) to look at the role of CREB in the modulation of the gene expression and of the seizure severity in acute seizure.\n\nApproach for statistical analysis: Graphpad was used to carry out t test and ANOVA\n\nResults and conclusions: We found that during the acute seizure the number of up- and down-regulated genes was higher than during epilepsy, possibly due to the massive cell alteration that occurs during epileptogenesis. Calcium signaling pathway resulted to be downregulated in both pathological stages, suggesting a protective mechanism to reduce the neuronal hyperexcitability. We were able to confirm the downregulation of several genes involved in this pathway by q-RT PCR. Finally, CREB seems to modulate the downregulation of genes involved in calcium signaling pathway, while inhibition of CREB seems to decrease seizure severity during SE.\n\nPoster number: PS035 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nDifferences in DNA Methylation Associated with Inflammatory Disease and Depression\n\nAuthors: Mr. Anders Jespersen1, Dr. Daniel McCartney1, Dr. Riccardo Marioni1, Prof. Andrew McIntosh1\n\n1University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n\nPrevious research has linked depression to inflammatory diseases and inflammatory blood markers, but the underlying molecular biology of the link is still unknown. DNA methylation (DNAm) is implicated in both depression and inflammatory diseases suggesting this could provide the link. Recent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with depression (Jovanova et al 2018), as well as DMPs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with depression and inflammation (Crawford et al. 2018). In this study we tested the findings of previous studies and identified new DNAm signatures of inflammatory diseases and depression in a larger sample with a more robust and consistently measured depression phenotype.\n\nData from Generation Scotland were used; genome-wide DNAm measurements were obtained from blood samples using Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChips (n = 4,847). A clinical measure of depression was obtained using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-4 (SCID) Brief Screening Interview for Major Depression and a measure of inflammatory disease (self-report of diabetes, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, or asthma, - presence of any versus absence format). All models controlled for use of antidepressant medication (electronic healthcare-linked), white blood cell counts, age and sex.\n\nAn EWAS of a depression-inflammatory disease interaction revealed no genome-wide significant associations, but 5 CpGs with P<1x10-5. A replication of the depression EWAS by Jovanova et al. (2018) showed an overlap of 5/15 (33.3%) DMPs with P<0.00625. A replication of Crawford et al. (2018) revealed an overlap of 3/9 (33.3%) DMPs with P<0.0125 for depression, none with the depression-inflammatory disease interaction, and 3/6 DMRs with P<0.0125 for the depression-inflammatory disease interaction. However, a principal components analysis revealed that 6 DMRs could be collapsed to 4 suggesting that physical proximity may not be an important factor in coordinated multi-CpG methylation.\n\nOur genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation, depression and inflammatory diseases identified several DMPs associated with a depression-inflammatory disease interaction approaching epigenome-wide significance. Furthermore, we demonstrated a good replication of results from previous EWASs of depression and depression-inflammatory disease interaction. Together these findings further elucidate the role of DNA methylation as a potential biological link between inflammatory diseases and the development of depression.\n\nPoster number: PS036 (SP)\n\nTheme: Genetics and epigenetics\n\nCharacterising the genetic and epigenetic architecture of neurological biomarkers in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936\n\nAuthors: Mr Robert Hillary1, Dr Daniel McCartney1, Dr Sarah Harris2,3, Ms Anna Stevenson1, Ms Anne Seeboth1, Mr Qian Zhang4, Mr David Liewald2, Dr Kathryn Evans1, Prof Craig Ritchie5, Dr Allan McRae4, Prof Naomi Wray4, Prof Peter Visscher4, Prof Ian Deary2,3, Dr Riccardo Marioni1,2\n\n1 Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute Of Genetics And Molecular Medicine, The University Of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 2 Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 3 Department of Psychology, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 4 Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, 5 Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: Aberrant plasma protein levels may serve as important markers of disease risk and progression in neurological conditions.
