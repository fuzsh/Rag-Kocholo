        "text": "Dear Masha,\n\nToday I feel to write to you in English, my third language.\n\nI am in the library of the MUAC, a prestigious institution of art in Mexico City.\n\nI don’t even know why I am here, but I like it a lot.\n\nNew territory.\n\nNever thought to be here but yet, here I am. I looked up some pictures of the performance I did in Cyprus, when you and Petr were also there. I see myself in the dress, I am with the people and it is not very clear who is having the lead in the performance. I love that so much, so much, mucho mucho mucho mucho.\n\nRemember the pure joy we had there?\n\nOn the pictures I see the people dancing, laughing, exchanging stories, making coffee, translating the horoscope in a news paper from way before Cyprus was divided in two.\n\nA well orchestrated chaos.\n\nA free choreography.\n\nWhat an adventure. It seems I am drawn to places that are divided in two to have that history.\n\nBerlin, Prague, Cyprus.\n\nI love to experience Poland, Romania, Hungary and many other eastern European countries.\n\nI love cultures were emotions are welcome, laughter and sadness a like.\n\nI learned to cry now.\n\nFinally I can do it.\n\nFor decades my tears were drying up in my throat area, hardening my heart,\n\nsuffocating my brain and I despised my self for having these tears, and later I was scared to death for letting them go, I was convinced when I would start\n\ncrying, I would never been able to stop! Result of a lower class upbringing, where tears were seen as useless and shameful.\n\nI let the tears clean my soul.\n\nI let the tears water my interior.\n\nI am not afraid of tears anymore.\n\nBless my tears.\n\nBless your tears.\n\nBless sharing our tears together when needed.\n\nBless the water running out of our eyes because we have to acknowledge our\n\npain, acknowledge our sadness, acknowledge the sour, cruel, unfair aspects of\n\nlife.\n\nThis war.\n\nThis dirty war.\n\nAll these dirty wars.\n\nIt seems I have been growing up carrying on my shoulders the tears of many.\n\nThe war has always been close to me.\n\nFor others it might be colonization.\n\nOr immigration.\n\nOr something else.\n\nOr maybe even nothing.\n\nIt so happens I am related to this old war and feel feel feel feel it deeply.\n\nI remember when the Netherlands got involved in the war wit Irak Masha.\n\nIt was written with big letters in the news paper: black on white.\n\nBold printed letters, hovering on the main page. It was a time where there were still lots of paper papers, in the kiosk in the streets, in the tobacco shops, on tables in the library.\n\nWe are in war with Irak!\n\nThe Netherlands join the war.\n\nAs if that was something good.\n\nI remember I started to cry.\n\nIt felt stupid but what can you do when the tears run?\n\nWith this war, I am blessed to be sharing tears with my wonderful Ukrainian friends Julia and Ohksana. I was in an artist residency in Prague last summer. In the Meet-factory.\n\nAn old factory bought by David Cerny, a beautiful artist, a generous and timid man of great value.\n\nNot the kind of famous artist that you see a lot, like nowadays artistst are walking business cards sometimes. I remember him crossing the stairs and greeting him, he responds reluctantly with his long black hair,\n\nhiding shy brown eyes.\n\nNever had a big artist ego it seems.\n\nAnyway, I was there, working on the theme of femicide, a sad theme but\n\nwhat can you do in a world were women are still being harassed and stalked and murdered on a daily basis because they were involved in toxic romance?\n\nDid you know dear Masha that in my country of birth, the Netherlands, every\n\n8 days ( yes eight!) a woman is victim of femicide?\n\nIt is a small country you know, in three hours by car you cross it, horizontally,\n\nvertically and diagonally.\n\nStatistics.\n\nStrangely enough, me who never was good with math and numbers, was\n\nspending weeks on statistics on femicide.\n\nEye opener, these statistics, numbers don’t lie.\n\nToday I feel like crying a lot.\n\nCrazy how sometimes one little event triggers the stream of water\n\nMashaleine.\n\nI saw an announcement of Woyzeck today, it will be in Spanish but I want to\n\ngo see it Saturday evening.\n\nI am sure you know the play by Büchner because of your education in the old\n\nworld.\n\nA classic.\n\nApparently the text was found by Franzos, who had quite some trouble\n\ndeciphering the microscopically handwriting, it is crazy how we still need to\n\nsee this play about this lonely soldier, who murders his beloved Marie\n\nbecause she slept with the drum major, while he was undergoing medical\n\nexperiments.\n\nFor today I let you go of my writing hook Mashaleine,\n\nI have to make a list of what I have seen in my life during the 64 years, if I\n\nthink you will like it, I will send that too,\n\nSee you tomorrow here in the writing,\n\nMuch love\n\nAnd thank you so much for being in my life, spassiba,\n\nJacqueline\n\nDear Masha,\n\nYesterday I wore the same dress I was wearing in Cyprus when we first met.\n\nThe dress still fits me, my stomach is a bit rounder now that I’m older, the fabric stretches.\n\nI remember the photo series: me with you, me with your husband Petr.\n\nI remember your little house on the island.\n\nThe summer weather.\n\nI remember the sidewalk step we sat on.\n\nI remember how nice it was to discover that we were programmed in the same building to offer our performances there.\n\nMy performance was based on memories, on what we remember through time, and especially on what we have as a cultural past in our respective countries of origin.\n\nYour performance was a variation on this theme.\n\nWe all played with memories, old objects, souvenirs, photos, etc.\n\nIt was very hot on the island.\n\nMy hair was tightly braided and your hair was still very long and wild back then.\n\nLoose.\n\nPeter had a long beard.\n\nDoes he still have a beard?\n\nI believe you were still living in Moscow at the time. Later I understood through the photos on Facebook that you had settled in Siberia, in a small house in a small village. It looked rough with a lot of snow and ice.\n\nIt also had a certain allure, the white icy cold world you inhabited then.\n\nI never thought we would meet in Berlin this winter. It was glad to see you, your hair is shorter.\n\nThe reason we could see each other in Berlin was sad.\n\nThe war.\n\nThe dirty mean war.\n\nThe border that was closed just after you fled your homeland with your dog. Petr is still in Istanbul.\n\nWaiting for a visa.\n\nYour dog too.\n\nHas that changed now?\n\nHe had been waiting for more than six months.\n\nThis war, a year now.\n\nWho would have thought that a war would be raging at this time in Europe?\n\nI remember the wall.\n\nYes, I live long enough to remember that Europe was organized differently. No European Union.\n\nAn Iron Curtain, Russia was called USSR.\n\nA large territory.\n\nMany countries annexed.\n\nEverything had started after the second world war, a war with a huge impact on how the world was divided after the signed peace.\n\nI wasn’t there then.\n\nBut my parents did.\n\nAnd my family.\n\nThe stories and of course the huge impact on Rotterdam, my hometown, bombed flat twice.\n\nBy the Germans, while the Netherlands had already capitulated.\n\nBy the English, a mistaken bombardment.\n\nNow I read daily in the newspapers about the bombing in the Ukraine, it feels strange and sad, powerless too.\n\nOh my dear Masha, I have friends there, they are all fantastic artists, just like you two.\n\nI don’t know how to express the sadness I feel inside me.\n\nSometimes I cry in the morning, like a child that has lost its mother in a crowd.\n\nMasha, I am so thankful that you are all still alive.\n\nIt has become a diaspora again.\n\nYou are now studying in Halle.\n\nSmall student town in the vicinity of Leipzig.\n\nLeipzig, former East German city full of punks, trees and art.\n\nHalle with her Wunderkammer.\n\nThis Wunderkammer, have you already visited it dear Masha?\n\nAll colonial souvenirs crammed together in a tiny show room.\n\nSawfish dried, hanging in space.\n\nA very popular souvenir at the time, the sawfish were already extinct after a few years.\n\nThat’s how it goes.\n\nWe travel and take things with us.\n\nCollect.\n\nToday I started an artist residency in Mexico City.\n\nIt is International Women’s Day today.\n\nI admire the solidarity of the women here, a big demonstration is being organized this afternoon in the center and many institutions are closing their doors for this afternoon.\n\nI remember my first women’s day, long ago in Rotterdam.\n\nAll women took to the streets in solidarity.\n\nNow the women’s day has become a small celebration there.\n\nIt seems that the need is no longer there.\n\nI doubt that: there is still so much to do, what to think about femicide, rape, sexual deprivation, women trafficking, inequality in pay for work, the areas where women are still married off and have no education and training, cannot walk around without male guidance etc.\n\nIt all seems so okay in Western countries, but we are not there yet.\n\nI think.\n\nI feel.\n\nDear Masha I am writing to you and by writing to you I am actually writing to myself.\n\nI will be 65 this year.\n\nSixty five years.\n\nA whole age.\n\nIt feels strange, this number.\n\nIt is the year in which many retire.\n\nOr start thinking about it.\n\nAn age that cuts many off from the bustling life: in the eyes of many, being senior means no longer being seen, no longer being heard and filling your time with family, grandchildren and, above all, doing fun things.\n\nHelp.\n\nI don’t want to retire, I love my job, I don’t have small children and I live far from my family.\n\nI’m already doing fun things.\n\nHelp.\n\nI know I’m exaggerating but still…I still feel young and strong and actually I’m only now feeling a little better about my aging skin.\n\nThat is confrontational.\n\nThe body that ages and timidly shows the first signs.\n\nDifficult for me, because I’ve focused so much on my body since childhood, the almost anorexic time since I was fourteen.\n\nAlways think about being skinny enough.\n\nNever been really happy with my body, my skin, my face, my hair and now suddenly I realize that what people generally say is true: Jacquie you are beautiful.\n\nI am beautiful.\n\nFinally.\n\nI am beautiful with my wrinkles.\n\nYet I still buy the creams that promise me that this process can be stopped, and sometimes I look in the mirror with surprise in the morning.\n\nHow did this happen? Millimetre by millimetre, gravity does its job.\n\nStill, I think I’m more beautiful than when I was so much more.\n\nMy veins swell, my hands show a river landscape of blue swollen veins, they twist anarchically on the back of my big white hands with her long fingers. My hands are a combination of my parents’ hands.\n\nThe size is my father’s, the shape and length of my fingers too.\n\nAnd the nails are sometimes on my father’s side and sometimes on my mother’s side.\n\nBut my middle fingers definitely belong to my mother: crooked at the end, yes, the last part is definitely crooked.\n\nWith her middle fingers too.\n\nMy mother is no longer alive.\n\nNeither does my father.\n\nI am orphan.\n\nOnly child.\n\nAlone on the world.\n\nI realize that I am next in line: I live on the way to my mortality, death, which awaits me.\n\nI get it out of my consciousness but it’s quite difficult.\n\nMy right leg has all that my mother had: the veins teeming lush and blue, fine network, interspersed with larger veins on the surface of my skin.\n\nThey sometimes knock a warning sign to me: ‘Yes, we are already here, enjoy every day, know that the time you have left is precious.’\n\nTime.\n\nI was so young and of course never thought about the time.\n\nWhole days, whole weeks even I faltered.\n\nSmoking.\n\nStaring into the distance.\n\nHow were you dear Masha when you were young?\n\nWhat was it like growing up under communist rule?\n\nI was in a family who were immensely grateful to Canadians and Americans. My parents who had been through a war, had known hunger, and they met during a dance evening with music from a dance orchestra: Glenn Miller’s In the mood, American music was popular.\n\nThe music I grew up with: Peggy Lee, Fats Domino, Tommy Dorsey, Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots.\n\nA little later Tom Jones, big sex idol, from my mother.\n\nThe black and white television with two channels.\n\nTom Jones singing on a catwalk, screeching the women and tugging at his tie, leaning benignly over to let them do so.\n\nMama was glued to the tube drooling and I, as a little girl, was so amazed at all this excitement.\n\nLater, also on television, Frank Zappa in concert, with groupies showing their naked breasts, my mother laughing on the couch.\n\nThe years of the sexual revolution, the man with long hair and the women on the anti-conception pill.\n\nI timid and prudish.\n\nTimes of great change.\n\nWorking women. Birth control. Nudist beach. Pop music. Youth culture. Study possible for the working class.\n\nTraveling with the Magic Bus, without a toilet, rocking and sweating to Portugal, three days on each other’s lips.\n\nThe news from all over the world on a small moving black and white square in the living room.\n\nI remember the moon landing, I was still young and already in bed.\n\nMy father woke me up.\n\n“You have to see this,” he said, I sat on the chair in front of the television, drowsy.\n\nA vague image as it was then.\n\nWe didn’t need sharpness and pixels yet.\n\nA man in a white suit, an inverted fishbowl on his head and stumbling through the landscape of the lunar craters with a flag in his hands: stripes and stars.\n\nI think the USSR planted a flag there too, didn’t you dear Masha?\n\nI can google it for us.\n\nGoogle knows everything.\n\nI used to think that if it came to the year 2000, we would stop eating fruits and vegetables and bread and cheese and nuts and so on.\n\nI thought we’d get three pills a day on a plate and robots would be all over the city, silver shapes with angular movements. haha.\n\nThe robots, the future as it was visualized at the time.\n\nWi-Fi.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nComputers everywhere.\n\nThe first, plump plastic beige cube with a gray screen and strange sounds. Even weirder what you saw, I couldn’t imagine it.\n\nIncomparable to the slim stylized lab-tops we know today.\n\nThe cell phone.\n\nI still remember the first time I saw someone with a big piece of plastic in his hand, screaming in the street, it seemed to no one.\n\nI thought, “Oh dear, this gentleman needs help, a psychiatrist or something.” But no, it was progress.\n\nIt seemed like a failure to me, this project of communicating without a cord anywhere in a telephone screaming.\n\nIntrusive conversations, way too loud.\n\nI couldn’t imagine people would want this, it would certainly quickly disappear from the street scene.\n\nHahaha.\n\nI spend at least a good three hours a day on my phone or computer Masha. You too?\n\nAnd now we have the white chunks of plastic in the ears, cellphone in hand, eyes fixed on a hazy infinity.\n\nSight and sound shielded.\n\nWhat will follow?\n\nIt is clear to me, probably one day I will stop following all the new technologies being developed.\n\nThat’s allowed, as an excuse I have my age, hihihi.\n\nOr not.\n\nWho knows.\n\nI’ll write you more tomorrow dear Masha, I’m going to find our photos and hug you from afar, you in Halle, me in Mexico City.\n\nUntil then!\n\nWith love,\n\nJacquie\n\nI arrived in Valencia with the bus from Benidorm, it was a noisy travel.\n\nMusic, loud and a woman talking in her phone , louder and non stop.\n\nOn my way to the room I had rented in Valencia there are lots of cars, and also lots of smoking people.\n\nLots.\n\nActually too much.\n\nNot sure if I will like Valencia.\n\nI see my street, a small narrow street with some trees, a tapas restaurant and a young Arab man smiles at me.\n\nI smile back at him and I try to call the person who will hand me the keys.\n\nHe asks me if I want to call Sandy.\n\nYes, that is her name, Sandy, like the star from Grease.\n\nHe says: I will call her, she rents rooms to everyone here.\n\nMeanwhile two other young Arab men leave the house.\n\nSandy comes and shows me the apartment, which I share with three Arab young men.\n\nOh dear, I think, I am in Arabia.\n\nI smile and say hi and I am happy to see the apartment is clean, the room is small but clean, only the shower and toilet are on the balcony outside.\n\nIt reminds me of my time in Prague last summer, where I also had to cross outside on the balcony to do my things.\n\nThat night I have the courage to go to the tango, two metro lines away from here.\n\nThe three Arab guys are watching television, it is loud and they look serious.\n\nI sneak outside and discover Valencia.\n\nI arrive in a working class neighborhood and I find the tango place, the music is lovely and the walls are deep red, decorations all over the place and soft lights to finish of a kind of bordello look.\n\nOnly a few couples at the small tables around the dance-floor.\n\nIt might be an evening where I will only watch, I think. Then the teacher is nice enough to dance with me, I follow his heavenly steps on heavenly music.\n\nOh glorious tango music: Fresedo, di Sarli, Pugliese…\n\nLater I dance with a French man and as a dessert I share a wonderful tanda with a young Venezualean dancer.\n\nMission accomplished!\n\nI return to the carer Jardin and find my way easy to my Valencian home.\n\nI love it when cities are easy, I love to travel with the public transport.\n\nWhen I enter the house, Arabian music blasts loud, rai music, so that is not so bad.\n\nStill, I do hope they will tone it down but I do not want to ask.\n\nWe’ll see, I think when I open the door.\n\nI say Hola!\n\nThe guys look scared, as if I am going to be angry or something like that.\n\nBut I smile and say that is really nice music.\n\nThen I go to my room, unwind a bit.\n\nWithin ten minutes it is quiet and when I go to the balcony to brush my teeth, the lights are out and all the young men are in their own rooms.\n\nSweet, I think, that is really sweet of them to be so considerate with this old lady.\n\nThat night I sleep like a baby, I feel safe and cared for, just like I like it.\n\nThe next day is Saturday, the weekend day.\n\nArt-galleries, exploring the city center on my own. In the evening I am sharing a meal in a restaurant with my Valencian friends Andrea and Vincent.\n\nI met Andrea in Leipzig, she is a super sweet, a bit crazy, a very small but feisty dancer, she speaks German and her speaking is wild and slightly exaggerated.\n\nI love it.\n\nShe thinks I am a queen.\n\nVincent is a writer and works often in Madrid, she cries when he goes there for a few days.\n\nHe is as lovely as she is, calmer but witty and intellectual, I can dig deep with him in conversations, I love it.\n\nDigging deep.\n\nIn-between my Saturday activities I return home.\n\nI am freshening myself up for the evening and Yassin sits at the kitchen table.\n\nWe had a small talk this morning, he studies for one year here, electricity or something like that, he misses Marocco.\n\nI guess they all do.\n\nFar from home, studying hard.\n\nHe likes me.\n\nAll of a sudden, before I head out , he asks me if I want to go out with him tonight.\n\nTo show me the city.\n\nI am touched but I also think: Good heavens, you must be twenty three , can’t you see I am old older oldest?\n\nI decline with lots of tact, explaining my plans.\n\nA part of me is flattered though, it is always nice to get an invitation.\n\nThe evening is good, we go after dinner to the museum night and I meet some of the friends of Andrea and Vincent, we drink rioja wine and we discuss art and such afterwards on the museum terras before each of us head home.\n\nI outplayed the guys, it is past three and everyone is already in bed, I quietly sneak on the bathroom balcony before jumping in bed.\n\nValencia, I start to warm up to you!\n\nThe next day Andrea and her dad and her cousin take me downtown, explaining lots about the history and architecture of this city: Roman, Arab, gothic catholic, Spanish, barok etc. a kaleidoscope of styles. The cousin does not speak English and is shy.\n\nI kind of love shy people, for me they spread an authenticity around them and they bring a calm that is rare to find these days.\n\nHe has a bracelet tattoo around his wrist and I ask him what it is.\n\nImagine, he says, do you know the song?\n\nWow, how nice.\n\nWhen he looks at me, he looks for real into my eyes, we dive in each others eyes.\n\nSoft penetration.\n\nSweet.\n\nThat evening I go to tango, but this time to another place, by foot, it is only twenty minutes away from me. This place is at a gym, there are no red walls and decorations, it is a big room with a very basic interior.\n\nThis time a lot of couples.\n\nAgain I dance with the teacher, it is dynamic, big fun, with lots of unexpected moves.\n\nWe laugh and I get a compliment, you dance very well.\n\nSweet.\n\nI see a man who I would love to dance with, when I watch him dancing I notice that his abrazo is full of care and he oozes protection, it is a big man, older than me, bearded.\n\nI dance with some other men and it is nice.\n\nBut I really would love to dance with the bear.\n\nI decide to help luck a bit.\n\nGoing around the dance floor to get me a drink, I pass him and I say Hola!\n\nHe looks up and I smile, he smiles back, that is a relief.\n\nWhen I am back at my seat, I gaze from time to time in his direction and yes!\n\nHe picks up the signal and he asks me to dance a tanda of waltzes.\n\nIt is heavenly, just as I thought it would be.\n\nWe start very simple, one tango we are only walking, which I love, we take time, figuring out each other’s weight and adjusting our abrazo.\n\nThen he takes more risks with me and it complicates the dances, he guides me into lovely turns, make smaller steps in staccato rhythms and then I have to follow a lyrical swaying, ending by him inviting me to give all my weight in the dancing.\n\nConnection.\n\nThe tanda is over, we smile, he speaks Spanish.\n\nHis name is Juan.\n\nWe go to our own spots.\n\nI know he is going to ask me again.\n\nAnd he does.\n\nAnd again.\n\nWe dance the last dance.\n\nThen it is over.\n\nShoes are changed and I walk home.\n\nI wonder…if I would have lived in Valencia, would I have danced with Juan again, I guess so.\n\nThis connection.\n\nTango can make this happen, strong, real, immediate.\n\nI do not see the boys anymore.\n\nI visit the cathedral on Monday before flying to Malaga.\n\nCatholic churches have such a strong visual attraction for me, their marketing and business model was really good, the statues, the gold, the architecture, everything is so impressive.\n\nOver the top and yet a realness in the emotions of the saints and off course Christ.\n\nTaking Ryan air to Malaga , arriving midnight and my cab driver is a sweet Nigerian young man, Peter.\n\nBeautiful smile.\n\nHe takes me home, the home in Malaga.\n\nTidal sleeps already but has send me a small video in which he shows a little box with keys.\n\nHe magnets it under the fire alarm.\n\nCool.\n\nIt is one of these buildings where you can enter without needing a key, you only need a key to open the door of the appartement.\n\nI take the elevator, tenth floor.\n\nI feel under the fire alarm.\n\nCheck!\n\nThe box is there!\n\nI try to open the box, but it is really difficult, oh my god, I do not want to ring Tidal out of his sleep.\n\nI get on my knees because one way or another it feels easier for me.\n\nStay calm, I think.\n\nThen the door opens and Tidal stands there in his pyjama.\n\nCome in, he says.\n\nWas I noisy?\n\nNo, he says, I slept but then woke up and I sensed you.\n\nConnection.\n\nThe box is really difficult to open, I say.\n\nI know, he answers, I go back to sleep now.\n\nI hug him and sneak into my room.\n\nI am blessed, I think, I am blessed.\n\nWith connection."
