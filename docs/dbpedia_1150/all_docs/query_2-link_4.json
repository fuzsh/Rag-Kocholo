        "text": "The Soviet Union was one of the first in the world to create heavy four-engine bombers. In the early 1930s, TB-3, created by A. N. Tupolev, rose to the sky. In the middle of the 30s, this four-motor giant was considered a miracle of its time. At that time not a single country in the world was armed with anything of the kind, and hundreds of such machines floated over Red Square during the holidays. These giants are rightly called airships and even \"air battleships.\" All-metal TB-3 was made according to the advanced technology of that time - with a corrugated aluminum sheeting, the strength and rigidity of which was significantly higher than that of smooth sheets. But such a skin had a significant drawback: it dramatically increased the resistance due to the large area of ​​the so-called “wetted” surface. “Corrugations” significantly reduced the range and speed of flight.\n\nFor its time, the heavy TB-3 bomber was certainly good, but by 1933 it became clear that with the rapid pace of development aviation this plane will become obsolete in a couple of years. By this time, the paths for the further development of aviation have already been determined. The advent of wing mechanization, retractable landing gear, and powerful aircraft engines created the conditions for increasing the specific load on the wing and thereby for a sharp increase in maximum flight speed. The world-class production technology allowed us to move from trusses with corrugated sheathing to semi-monocoque with smooth glider sheathing.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that in 1933 — 1934. in the midst of the serial construction of the TB-3 aircraft, the idea arose of a major overhaul of the aircraft or a new one based on it - in order to achieve a significant improvement in its performance in the light of new requirements.\n\nIn 1934, at plant No. 22, during the serial construction of TB-3, it was decided to overhaul the aircraft to meet the new requirements. At this time, the brigade V.M. Petlyakova under the general guidance of A.N. Tupolev began the development of a heavy four-engine bomber TB-7, and work on the development of TB-3 Tupolev did not consider it promising. Therefore, Plant No. 22, on its initiative, supported by the Commander-in-Chief, invited a group of teachers and engineers of the Air Force Academy (about 20 people) to do this work. The group was headed by Professor Viktor Fedorovich Bolkhovitinov; the group included MM Shishmarev (design and strength calculations), Ya. M. Kuritskes (aerodynamics), and others. Later, a design bureau was organized on the basis of this group. When creating a bomber, it was necessary to meet the very stringent technical requirements: speed - no less than 310 km / h, practical ceiling - 6000-7000 m, carrying capacity - up to 5000 kg.\n\nThe influence of the TB-3 late series was outwardly quite sensitive, and VF himself. Bolkhovitinova saw the new car as the development of TB-3. But at the same time, the designers tried to find in it the use of all aircraft building innovations of the time. The fuselage was not a rectangular section, but a semi-monococcus. In order to save weight, the wing was made permanent, although the design of the side members was taken almost entirely from the TB-3. Engines - four AM-34RNB. Chassis - cleaned in large fairings. The initial composition of weapons included four ShKAS turret machine guns and one BT machine gun, but in the future they were planned to be replaced by six ShVAKs and a ShVAK bow gun. Bomb load - 5000 kg. The radio-direction finder APR-3 was installed on the DB-A. The project involved the installation of autopilot WUA-10. Communication between members of the crew was carried out using pneumatic mail and aircraft intercom. To ensure the landing at night on the plane provided for the placement of underwing flares.\n\nWork on the design and construction of the aircraft, called DB-A (Dalny bomber - Academy), were carried out quickly, and in November 1934, the prototype was ready. His first flight took place in May 1935. Factory tests were conducted from the end of the year 1935 to March 5, the year 1936. They showed that the DB-A with four AM-34RNB engines had significantly higher flight performance compared with the TB-3, from which it hardly differed in design and dimensions. These characteristics were achieved thanks to the improved overall aerodynamics of the aircraft, in particular, the use of smooth plating, semi-detachable landing gear, enclosed cockpits and rifle installations, as well as through the internal suspension of bombs. With a flight mass of 19500 kg, DB-A could perform horizontal flight on two engines at an altitude of 2500 m, and on three engines the ceiling was 5100 m. The DB-A had a very high aerodynamic quality — its value reached 15 units. Thus, the calculations of the designers were fully confirmed, and the speed achieved during the test turned out to be even higher than the estimated one - 330 km / h, on 40 km / h. At the same time, the increase in speed also had a shadow side: the load on the steering wheels increased dramatically. In the car, which appeared at the junction of two epochs of aircraft construction - which ended the period of slow-moving giants and the beginning of the era of aerodynamically clean high-speed aircraft - there were too many traditional solutions. Of course, the boosters-power boosters that appeared much later did not exist in the DB-A control system, and to solve this problem, cable polyspasts were introduced into the aileron control system.\n\nThe success of DB-A was undoubted, and it was decided to use a modified version of this aircraft to set various records. November 10 1936 pilots M.A. Nuhtikov and M.A. Lipkin lifted 10 tonnes to 7032 meters on this plane and November 20s 13 tonnes to 4535 meters, setting two international records. 14 of May 1937. Pilots G. F. Baidukov and N. G. Kastanaev with navigator-radio operator L. L. Kerber made a flight on the route Moscow-Melitopol-Moscow to a distance 2002,6 km in 7 h 2 min 11,7 sec with a control load 5 t, setting two international speed records 280 and 246 km / h at distances 1000 and 2000 km with a load 5 t.\n\nThe results of the records and the excellent characteristics of the car suggested that it should be used for a trans-arctic flight - across the North Pole to America. In early June 1937, Mr. Baydukov introduced the famous pilot of the Hero of the Soviet Union S. A. Levanevsky to Bolkhovitinov and the leading factory test pilot DB-A Kastanayev, who immediately agreed to show the car in flight. Dressed from the needle, with attentive and intent look, Levanevsky gave the impression of a well-educated aristocrat. While preparing for the flight, he was very restrained and silent. Kastanayev raised the plane, gained altitude, then dived to gain speed and above the airfield, laid a very steep turn at a low altitude - the wings set almost perpendicular to the ground at an angle of 90 degrees. After stunning the airfield personnel with the roar of four forced engines, he steeply went up. The plane was empty, fueled for demonstration purposes only. Kastanaev easily managed spectacular figures, unusual for a heavy bomber. Watching the flight, Levanevsky was transformed. Nobody expected such a violent reaction from a silent guest. The plane has not landed yet, but Levanevsky shone, radiating delight and literally rushed to Bolkhovitinov: “Give, give me this car! This show the Americans! They never dreamed of it! ”Indeed, the Americans did not have such cars. They have just started to create the first “flying fortress“ - “Boeing-17”. Levanevsky knew the American technique of that time perfectly well. Seeing such a heavy and elegant aircraft in the air, he realized that this “novelty” can surprise anyone.\n\nFor a record flight, the aircraft was equipped with new AM-34RNB engines that passed two hundred-hour bench tests and assigned the H-209 polar aviation index to it. During the training period, the crew performed a test and training flight on the route Schelkovo - Baku - Schelkovo. Special attention at this stage was paid to the development of take-off. The fact is that for such a long flight, 16,4 tons of fuel were required (which was almost twice the norm), and the total weight of the aircraft exceeded 34,7 tons. With this reserve, DB-A could fly around 8440 km.\n\nAll work completed by August 1937. Judging by the memorandum of the director of the aircraft factory, the aircraft was thoroughly prepared for flights in the Arctic. Even the anti-icing system was mounted, with which the propeller blades were washed with alcohol. Approved and crew. The commander of the ship was S. A. Levanevsky, the second pilot was appointed N. G. Kastanaev, in the recent past the test pilot of the Red Army Air Force Research Institute, the navigator was the famous polar explorer V. I. Levchenko, the radio operator by the Air Force Institute N. Ya. Galkovsky, flight engineer - engineer N. N. Godovikov, second flight engineer - G. T. Pobezhimov.\n\nOn a quiet August evening, 1937, a four-engined Soviet aircraft DB-A took off from the Schelkovo airfield and headed for the north.\n\nAlmost a day (20 h 17 min) the flight took place normally. The radio communication between the command post and the airship remained stable and was conducted in accordance with a predetermined plan. It was only the fact that, starting from the middle of the Barents Sea, the aircraft was going in the conditions of overcast. Passing the North Pole, Levanevsky sent the car along the 148 parallel, in the direction of the city of Fairbanks in Alaska.\n\nIn 14 h 32 min received a radiogram in which it was reported that due to damage to the oil line, the rightmost engine had failed. Then the connection deteriorated sharply. Over the next three hours, two more radiograms were received at the command post. From them it was possible to understand only that the flight continues. Then the connection was finally broken ...\n\nDespite the large-scale searches undertaken, in which 24 Soviet and 7 foreign aircraft participated, no trace of the missing expedition could be found. Only nine months later, in May 1938, the government commission decided to stop further searches.\n\nBut work on the long-range bomber VF Bolkhovitinova continued. In March, 1936, a new DB-2А aircraft was put to trial. On the second DB-2А aircraft were installed: new AM-34FRN forced engines with turbo-compressors and variable pitch propellers, a fully retractable landing gear (without pants), a new central tower installation and additionally two ShKAS machine guns in special cabins located in nacelles that provided circular fire. In addition, to improve the view cockpit done above. The crew of the bomber increased to 11 people. The second copy developed practically the same speed as the first, and its flight mass reached 28 T. The machine’s electrical power allowed it to fly freely and with one engine off at speeds up to 292 km / h. The DB-2А practical ceiling turned out to be close to the calculated one - with a flight mass of 21,5 t it was 5100 m. In the 1938 year, after eliminating a number of flaws and replacing engines with AM-34PHP, the state tests were completed, and the aircraft was considered promising, and since the appearance of serial TB- 7 was delayed indefinitely, the Bolkhovitinov bomber was recommended for mass production.\n\nAs the development of DB-A in March 1936, Bolkhovitinov developed the design of the BDD aircraft with four M-34FRN engines in 1200 l. pp., wing span - 36,2 m, length —26,0 m, wing area — 180 m2, hermetic cabs, flight weight — 20 000 — 27 000 kg, weight return — 38%, specific load on the wing — 111 —150 kg / mXNNXX, specific load on the wing - 2 —5 kg / mXNNXX, specific load on the wing - 6,7 —350 kg / mNNXX kg, mWNNXX / NNXX, specific load on the wing - 4000 —400 kg / mXNNXX / NNXX% , for power - 8000 — 460 kg / l, s., ground speed — 9,0 km / h, at the height of 11,0 m — 5000 km / h, at the height of 10,5 m — 8000 km / h, ceiling — 17,4 — XNUMX km, climb time XNUMX m — XNUMX min; XNUMX m — XNUMX min.\n\nIn December, tactical and technical requirements (TTT) were developed for the heavy cruiser TK-1939 - a DB-1A modification with four M-2FRN engines with powerful weapons (34 ShVAK cannons, 3 ShKAS machine guns and 5 PC), and the ShQAS 8 version is not an option, and none of the ShVAK versions have been applied. (3 thousands of shells and 11 thousands of rounds). For a similar TK-4 aircraft, the following crews were assigned: crew — 11 man, bombs — 5000 kg and flight weight — from 16880 to 23 900 kg. But all these machines have not gone out of the design work.\n\nIn 1938, the DB-A series of aircraft was laid in 16, of which 1939 aircraft were commissioned in 12. Installing new engines and additional equipment by almost a ton increased the mass of mass-produced cars - with this, the center of gravity shifted forward, which improved the longitudinal stability of the machine. Unfortunately, the engine builders failed to fulfill their obligations - the M-34FRN engine did not develop the rated power. Nevertheless, the speed of the bomber reached 346 km / h at an altitude of 6 thousand meters, it was free to perform and turns with a roll to 60 °.\n\nAt the same time, all the upgrades and refinements to which DB-A was subjected could not bring its data into line with the drastically changed requirements for such machines. Created at the junction of two eras, the long-range bomber carried too many outdated concepts. The TB-7 heavy bomber, built in the design bureau of A.N. Tupolev by the brigade V.M. Petlyakov, became a machine that fully met the new conditions. Nevertheless, the TB-7 aircraft was difficult to manufacture, it was produced with long interruptions, was twice removed from production and again restored. The total number of constructed TB-7 and the pace of its production could not satisfy the USSR Air Force, therefore, the possibility of issuing several more DB-2А series was repeatedly considered. And the last time the question of resuming the production of DB-A was raised in 1942 year. Serial DB-2А did not take part in hostilities. In the middle of 1941, four aircraft were evacuated outside the Urals, using it as military vehicles for some time.\n\nИспользованная литература:\n\nYakubovich N.
