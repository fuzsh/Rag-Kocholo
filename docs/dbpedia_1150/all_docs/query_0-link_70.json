The Superpowers: a short history traces the intertwining history of the two powerschronologically. In a fascinating and innovative approach, the book adopts themetaphor of a lifespan to explore this evolutionary relationship. Commencingwith the inheritance of the two countries up to 1898, the book continues bylooking at their conception to 1921, including the effects of the First World War,gestation to 1945 with their period as allies during the Second World War andtheir youth examining the onset of the Cold War to 1968. The maturity phaseexplores the Cold War in the context of the Third World to 1991 and finally thebook concludes by discussing the legacy the superpowers have left for the twenty-first century.

Aimed at filling such a gap, this book defines a superpower as able toconduct a global strategy including the possibility of destroying the world; tocommand vast economic potential and influence; and to present a universalideology. It adopts the metaphor of a lifespan in an examination of the manner inwhich the USA on the one hand and the USSR (preceded and succeeded byRussia) on the other have constituted superpowers, as follows. Chapter 1, âTheInheritanceâ argues that the subjects cannot be understood without someunderstanding of their earlier antecedents. The treatment, as throughout thework, is thematic as well as chronological, with attention given to economic andcultural as well as political aspects of the subject. Chapter 2, âConceptionâ, placesa strengthening USA and a weakening Tsarist Russia in the context of imperialismbefore going on to discuss the impact of the First World War and the RussianRevolution, which led to the formation of the respective ideologies bothchallenging traditional liberalism, Wilsonism and Leninism. Chapter 3, âGes-tationâ, describes the manner in which both USA and USSR strove for their worldorders along with older and newer rivals before the Second World War broughtthem closer together as their rivals were defeated or declined. Chapter 4, âYouthâ, examines the onset of the Cold War along with theprocess of decolonisation. It does not seek to attribute responsibility, but ratherto set out the conflicting aims and comparative strengths of the two sides.Chapter 5, âMaturityâ, takes the Cold War from the US involvement in Vietnamto the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan as principal examples of superpowerengagement in the Third World, where an emerging rival to both of them wasthe Peopleâs Republic of China. It also analyses the Soviet collapse. Chapter 6,âTheLegacyâ, poses such questions as, is the Cold War over, and how has it beenassessed? How have American and Russian analysts placed the superpowers in thecontext of âworld processâ or âcivilisationsâ and how should they be placed inthe context of the end of the millennium? A summary follows as part of an\n\nP:09\n\nviii Prefaceexamination of the uses of the past before a few final conjectures are made aboutthe future in conclusion. This book marks a return to a subject which I first addressed in another workpublished thirty years ago, and have considered in other books since. In particular,The Emergence of the Super-Powers (Macmillan, 1970) now looks like a preliminarysketch, considering the twentieth century in less than fifty pages. The Last GreatGame (Pinter, 1989) approached the subject making use of the Braudelianconcepts event, conjuncture and structure in ascending order of emphasis. Again,therefore, there is comparatively little on the twentieth century. In the presentwork, apart from the adoption of the guiding metaphor, the treatment is moreconventional as well as somewhat fuller. Nevertheless, the structure may be foundin Chapter 1, which draws heavily on these earlier works now out of print. WhatI have called the Great Conjuncture, Wilsonism versus Leninism, reappears inChapter 2, but in fresh guise. For the rest, the overall approach and most of thematerial is ânewâ. That is to say, although almost none of it has been taken fromarchives, considerable numbers of publications have been consulted, ranging fromthe speeches of politicians to the works of novelists and poets. Some key works ofyesteryear have have seemed worthy of extended mention. An enormous debt is owed to them and to more recent publications, includingthose by fellow historians. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no other worktakes the same approach as my own. For example, a book with which I mostlyagree, Walter LaFeberâs America, Russia and the Cold War, 1945â1996 (New York,1997), and another with which to a considerable extent I disagree, John LewisGaddis, Russia, the Soviet Union, and the United States: An Interpretive History (NewYork, 1990), both devote no more than a few pages to the period before theoutbreak of the Second World War. However, more needs to be said about theseoutstanding scholars. Walter LaFeber has produced other books giving masterlysurveys of US diplomacy as a whole as well as throwing light on a range ofparticular questions. Moreover, since I first heard an exemplary lecture by him in1970, I have listened to him and read him with great respect. Meanwhile, JohnLewis Gaddis has gained a reputation as one of the leading Cold War specialistswith a series of publications culminating in We Now Know: Rethinking Cold WarHistory (Oxford, 1997), which has been praised for setting the agenda for futurework but also criticised for sounding a note of triumphalism. Among otherstimulating colleagues, I would like to include Academician Nikolai NikolaevichBolkhovitinov, who has set the highest standards in his studies of early AmericanâRussian contacts as well as demonstrating what could be done even in difficultcircumstances. Selecting the material which has seemed most appropriate for mypurpose, I have made due acknowledgements in the Notes. While accepting ultimate responsibility for what is published here, I would liketo acknowledge the indispensable assistance that I have received from two goodfriends, Dr John Kent, Reader in International Relations at the London School of\n\nP:10\n\nPreface ixEconomics and Dr Cathryn Brennan, Honorary Research Fellow in History at theUniversity of Aberdeen, both of whom have read the penultimate draft with greatthoroughness and insight. My profound thanks to both of them for vitalimprovements. I would also like to record my gratitude to Professor Clive Lee ofthe Department of Economics, with whom I conducted a course on TheSuperpowers, for his useful comments and suggestions, to the students who tookthat course in successive presentations for their varied contributions, tocolleagues in the History Department as well as in the Queen Mother Library fortheir advice and support, and to members of the Routledge team who have seenthe book through the various stages of its production in an efficient andexpeditious manner. Paul Dukes Kingâs College,Old Aberdeen 31 May 2000\n\nP:12\n\n1 Inheritance Nations and empires, before 1898There were two superpowers in the twentieth century: the USA and the USSR. Atthe beginning of the next century, from most points of view, there appears to beonly one, the USA. In the future, there may be others: China seems a primecandidate. And in the past, before the superpowers, there were the âgreatpowersâ, mainly the European empires but including both the USA and the USSRâspredecessor, Tsarist Russia. Already in 1835, in a famous prediction, Alexis deTocqueville talked of them as âtwo great nationsâ apparently tending towards thesame end, if starting from different points, each of which seemed to be âcalled bysome secret design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of halfthe worldâ. As we shall soon see, we have to go far further back than 1835 in orderto understand the origins of the two twentieth century superpowers. But before that, a brief definition is in order. I suggest the following necessarycharacteristics. A âsuperpowerâ must be able to conduct a global strategyincluding the possibility of destroying the world; to command vast economicpotential and influence; and to present a universal ideology. Thus, the USA andUSSR were involved in an arms race which threatened the ultimate holocaust;were capable of commanding the necessary resources for this purpose whilepromoting the capitalist free market and the socialist planned economy,respectively; and, more generally, acted as major spokesmen for liberaldemocracy on the one hand and communist âMarxismâLeninismâ on the other. Aswe shall see, many modifications may be made to this basic definition, the mostimportant of which can only be explained by examining historically how thesuperpowers themselves and their predecessors evolved through previouscenturies. This will involve going back to medieval times, before 1492, the yearof the epic voyage of Columbus when Ivan III was tsar, and then on to earlycolonial expansion before 1776, the year of the American Revolution, whenCatherine the Great was Empress of Russia, looking for the roots of the politicalculture and other features of both the USA and the USSR. I have to recognise a considerable difficulty here. There will be those, I haveto admit, who will ask why a book which claims to be concerned with thetwentieth century should find it necessary to begin with a whole chapter in which\n\nP:13\n\n2 Inheritancethis century will scarcely be mentioned. All I can do here is quote the words ofShakespeare, carved on the front of the US National Archives in Washington DC:âwhatâs past is prologueâ, and to remind you of some of the references madeduring the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton which took place inWashington in 1998â9. These included not only the intentions of the FoundingFathers when they were framing the Constitution of 1787 but also the ideas of SirThomas More in the sixteenth century, the meaning of âhigh crimes andmisdemeanoursâ as adopted in the High Court of Parliament in the fourteenthand fifteenth centuries, and even the clauses of the Magna Carta of 1215. If thelong historical dimension is appropriate for the arraignment of a president, whyshould it not be appropriate for the comparative examination of the history of hiscountry and that of its great rival? Such an argument receives powerful supportfrom the comprehensive study of Soviet Diplomacy and Negotiating Behavior,commissioned by the Committee of Foreign Affairs of the US House ofRepresentatives and published in 1979, which considers the emerging forms ofdiplomacy under the Greeks, then contributions from Rome and Byzantium,before coming on to aspects of the modern age.1Geography and history (before 1492)If, as was often alleged during the years of the Cold War, the twentieth-centurystruggle was indeed one between godless Communism and Christian democracy,there could be little doubt that the Almighty weighted the scales in favour of hisprincipal adherents and against his chief adversaries when he arranged the basicconditions of the USA and the USSR. Historically, Russiaâs vast size has often beena tremendous handicap, contributing as much as the poor climate and maldis-tribution of natural resources to the slow pace of its development. On the otherhand, waves of invaders up to the Nazi Germans in the Second World War havefound themselves swallowed up in the monotonous steppes, while strategicthinkers from the beginning of the twentieth century to the nuclear age have seenthe advantages of domination of the Eurasian land mass. Geography, indeed, hasbeen no less evolutionary than history. In fact, the former Soviet Union, now the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS) plus the ex-Baltic republics, is about equal in area to the USA plusCanada and Mexico; that is, the North American Free Trade Association(NAFTA). However, the relationship of the two land masses to the sea has been ofconsiderable significance. Although Russiaâs coastline is very long, much of it isnorth of the Arctic Circle and not yet of any great use. One of her historic driveshas been to obtain a coastline on a navigable sea, first to the White Sea, then tothe Baltic Sea, later to the Black Sea and finally to the Pacific Ocean. But only theBlack Sea is completely ice-free, while none of Russiaâs ports enjoys completelyopen access to blue water. The USA has been much better endowed with\n\nP:14\n\nInheritance 3exploitable coastline on both Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, remote Alaska beingthe only seaboard state to be seriously threatened by ice. While the sea has been more agreeably arranged for the USA than for Russia, abroad comparison can be made between their manner of exploitation of theAtlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Black Sea, theeastern and western littorals of the Pacific Ocean. In the eighteenth century, StPetersburg and other towns on the Baltic, forming the window on the west,maintained Russiaâs connection with the European civilisation that stretched overthe Atlantic to Boston and other ports before and after the American Revolution.The USAâs takeover of the Gulf of Mexico, providing more access to the Atlanticin two principal stages during the first half of the nineteenth century, might belikened to Russiaâs assimilation of the northern and eastern shores of the BlackSea, her outlet to the Mediterranean, a few years before. The Crimea and thenorthern shore of the Black Sea are juxtaposed here to Louisiana, and theCaucasus to Texas. Continuing this over-fanciful comparison and quickly passingover a superficial similarity between Russiaâs Central Asia, where some nomadicpeoples as well as others more settled were subdued in the late nineteenthcentury, and Americaâs Far West, where the âRed Indiansâ made their last stand atabout the same time, we come to the Pacific shores. Vladivostok, althoughfounded in 1860, had some years to go before it could begin to rival SanFrancisco, and recently has been falling behind rather than catching up. Only themost visionary enthusiast could claim that the Russian Far East could becomeanother California. Leaving the seas, we move inland along the rivers, which have played animportant part in the history of both superpowers. Kievan Russia grew up on theDnepr, and was infiltrated by Northmen coming up the Western Dvina and otherrivers, just as they penetrated North America along the St. Lawrence. With thegrowth of Muscovy, the rivers rising near Moscow were vital arteries for the newsociety. These included not only the Dnepr and Western Dvina, but also the Donand the Volga and their tributaries. Outstanding among these became the Volga,whose value would have been even greater had it flowed into the Black Sea ratherthan the landlocked Caspian. The USAâs nearest equivalent to the Volga, theMississippi, did not achieve its full significance until well into the nineteenthcentury. Before then, the rivers leading into the hinterland from the convenientlyindented seaboard, the James, the Hudson, the Delaware and others, were ofmost service before the mountains were crossed and the Ohio was among thosethat came into use. The rivers remote from the first centres assisted explorationand communication, whether the Ob, Yenisei and Lena systems in Siberia, acrossto the Russian Pacific down the Amur, to a lesser extent into Central Asia alongthe Syr Daria and Amu Daria, or down to the North American south-west alongthe Rio Grande and Colorado, up to the north-west along the Columbia, fromNorthern to Southern California along the Sacramento and San Joaquin. While\n\nP:15\n\n4 Inheritancethe heartland rivers were supplemented by canals, those beyond it were not,partly because this would have been less useful in their case, but more becausetheir exploitation was not fully developed before the arrival of transport by railand, in some cases, by air. Alighting, we need now to develop further the concept of the heartland in aneconomic sense (as opposed to the strategic). In North America, this extendsfrom the Atlantic westwards beyond the Mississippi into the prairie, from theGulf of Mexico northwards near to Canada. The circumstances for agriculturehave been mostly favourable. In Russia, a âFertile Triangleâ tapers from a base linebetween St Petersburg on the Baltic Sea and Odessa on the Black Sea (since 1991in independent Ukraine) over towards the Ural Mountains. Russiaâs heartland issmaller (especially since 1991) and also less productive. While the human factorshould not be discounted, two fundamental physical features have been moreinfluential. First, the fact that both St Petersburg and Moscow are to the north ofKetchikan, Alaska, gives a clear indication of the disadvantageous situation ofRussia from the point of view of latitude. Second, the vast flattened and distortedrhomboid shape of the former Soviet Union, as opposed to the irregular trianglethat is North America, has given it a continentality of climate that increases inextremity towards the east and makes it virtually impossible to farm in deeperSiberia. Moreover, cold is an enemy to the north, as is dryness to the south. The parts historically played within the agricultural heartlands by the steppeand the prairie, as well as by the respective forests, have been central to thedevelopment of both the USA and Russia. Carving and burning out small plots ofland in the wooded regions, or farming more extensively in the rolling plains, thefrontier people in both societies have struggled against vast natural difficulties inan epic manner. Yet there is one more key difference: the relatively minorimportance of mountains during the expansion of Russia. The Urals are in manyplaces no more than high hills, and the Caucasus does not come on to the scenesignificantly until the nineteenth century, while the mountains of Central Asia andthe Far East have always been on the fringe. On the other hand, the Appalachianswere important moulding influences in American colonial times and beyond,while the crossing of the Rockies was one of the most momentous episodes in thegreat trek west. Turning from the use of the land to that of its contents, we find again that theUSA has been better endowed than its counterpart, especially as far as accessibil-ity is concerned. Many of Russiaâs natural resources are to be found in remoterSiberia. Whereas the USAâs northeastern states contained most of the necessaryingredients for early industrialisation, coal and iron were less conveniently locatedfrom the Russian point of view. Then, in the ambitious attempt to catch up withits rival during the Five-Year Plans in the 1930s and after, the USSR sufferedhandicaps beyond bureaucratic incompetence and ruinous purges.2\n\nP:16\n\nInheritance 5 But we must begin nearer the beginning, with the Muscovite period of Russianhistory following on from the Kievan period after centuries of the earlierdevelopment of the Slavic peoples. Some readers will ask again, is this reallynecessary? Here, I shall try to convert those who still doubt the uses of the past bybeginning with a State Department Order made to a specialist at HarvardUniversity. If an important branch of the US government believed that it was inorder to spend taxpayersâ money on finding out the mainsprings of Sovietbehaviour, should the rest of us doubt that this was a worthwhile exercise?Moreover, fortunately, the assignment was carried out by a leading scholar whoadapted it for wider consumption as âMuscovite Political Folkwaysâ. In his article,Edward Keenan argued that Soviet political culture was an update of thatdeveloped in medieval Russia and conditioned by the natural conditions of life inthe East European forest. Since these threatened survival itself: the most significant autonomous actor in peasant life was not the individual (who could not survive alone in this environment), and not even the nuclear family (which, in its extended form, was marginally viable, but still too vul- nerable in disease and sudden calamity), but the village, to whose interests all others were in the end subordinated.The main features of the consequent political culture were: a strong tendency to maintain stability and a kind of closed equilibrium; risk avoidance; suppression of individual initiatives; informality of political power; the considerable freedom of action and expression within the group; the striving for unanimous final resolution of potentially divisive issues. These features, moreover, were to be found not only in the village but also,writ large, in the emergent Muscovite state. And since for it too, the major aimwas survival, this state gave its prime attention to policies directed at theavoidance of chaos, at safety first, while the major guarantor of such policies wasbelieved to be a strict principle of centralisation. The centre should hold on to allit could, extending its grasp where possible. But this did not mean a single ruler:as in the village, so in the state, ultimate responsibility was not individual, butcollective. While such an aim was more easily considered than achieved â sinceamong powerful aristocratic families extended in clans, there were great regionaland dynastic problems sometimes leading to civil war â by about the end of thefifteenth century a kind of resolution had been achieved. This consisted of acoalition of the clans gathered around âthe divinely anointed grand prince ofMoscowâ. At the same time, however, the evolution of this coalition wasaccompanied by the emergence of a bureaucracy.\n\nP:17\n\n6 Inheritance With some justification, critics of Keenanâs approach pointed out that he hadsaid little about Byzantine or Mongol influences, about the steppe and coloni-sation, or about international relations.3 To take one example a little further, asfar as the influence of Byzantine culture and the Orthodox Church was con-cerned, Keenan argued that: It cannot be demonstrated â¦ that during its formative period (i.e. 1450â 1500) Muscovite political culture was significantly influenced either by the form or by the practice of Byzantine political culture or ideology. Nor is there convincing evidence that any powerful Muscovite politician or political group was conversant with Byzantine political culture, except perhaps as the latter was reflected in the ritual and organisation of the Orthodox Church, which itself had little practical political importance in early Muscovy and little formative impact upon Russian political behavior.4 On the other hand, Dimitri Obolensky writes: It is highly significant that Russia entered the European family of nations through her conversion to Christianity, for which she is indebted to Byzan- tium. The heritage of East Rome was not, as it is sometimes suggested, Russiaâs âmark of the beastâ that isolated her from medieval Europe: it was, in fact, the main channel through which she became a European nation. Byzan- tium was not a wall, erected between Russia and the West: she was Russiaâs gateway to Europe.5 Let us leave for now the question of the harsh conditions of the Russianfrontier and their influence on Muscovite and Soviet folkways to cross Europe andthe Atlantic Ocean to ask a similar question about early influences on the politicalculture of the other superpower, the USA. Some immediate problems presentthemselves. First, there is no convenient counterpart to the US State DepartmentOrder that led to Keenanâs article. To the best of my knowledge and belief, theMinistry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR never commissioned a Soviet scholar toanalyse the remote roots of the behaviour of the US government. Second, andmuch more significantly, far from existing in the late fifteenth century on whichKeenan focuses, the USA was not foreshadowed even in the wildest dreams of theâdiscovererâ of America in the same period, Columbus in 1492. For manyhistorians, even though they would concede that the Americas were far fromâemptyâ at that time, to look for explanations of the twentieth-century politicalculture of the USA in the period before the beginning of the colonial periodmight still be seen as wild eccentricity. Nevertheless, because it is in the interestsof parity, and, indeed because it might have intrinsic validity, the attempt must bemade.\n\nP:18\n\nInheritance 7 Passing over for the moment the period of later clashes and interactionbetween Native Americans on the one hand and immigrant Europeans andAfricans on the other, let us concentrate to begin with on the political culture ofthe principal promoter of the North American colonies. Towards the end of thefifteenth century, Muscovite Russia was not the only state suffering civil waramong powerful families accompanied by great regional and dynastic problems.For England, the Wars of the Roses involving the houses of York and Lancaster fitsthat description all too well. But for at least one observer, the way forward hadalready been indicated. Just as Edward Keenan found directions for Russiandevelopment already indicated in earlier centuries, so the historical anthropolo-gist Alan Macfarlane has asserted that âmost of the central legal, political,economic, social and demographic premises that were observable in the earlynineteenth century were already formed by the fourteenth century at the latestâ.The Common Law reached a mature stage of development by the end of thethirteenth century, while the principle that England was not an absolutist state butthat the Crown was under the law and responsible to parliament was establishedeven before the Magna Carta of 1215. Medieval England was already a tradingnation with a âshopkeeperâ mentality, according to Macfarlane. Moreover, forhim, the nuclear family with male primogeniture and a distinctive marriagepattern was almost the same in the nineteenth century as it had been in thefourteenth, and a consequence of this peculiarly English arrangement had led toan unusual level of demographic stability.6 The nuclear family originating in theinsular confines of England, as opposed to the extended family reacting to thesevere conditions of the vast Russian forest? Do we find the early roots of thesuperpower rivalry already sunk deep in such an origin before the Europeanvoyages of exploration and discovery at the dawn of modern times?Early modern colonisation (1492â1776)Certainly, these voyages bring us to another phase in our search for the origins ofthe âtwo great nationsâ. Russia was âdiscoveredâ in 1553, and in a manner re-calling the more famous âdiscoveryâ of America in 1492. For, just as theexpedition led by Columbus was expected to reach the riches of the Orient byway of the western route, over the Atlantic Ocean and beyond, so the expeditionof 1553, led initially by Sir Hugh Willoughby and later by Richard Chancellor,was expected to reach the same goal via the north of Norway and the northeast-ern passage. A further link between the two routes of exploration was embodiedby Sebastian Cabot, already known for following in the wake of his father Johnover to the New World, now governor of the group sponsoring this fresh ventureto skirt the shores of the continent already known. Moreover, the letter carried byChancellor from Edward VI of England and delivered to Ivan IV â the Terrible âin Moscow, also recalled the official purposes of earlier voyages. Addressed to âall\n\nP:19\n\n8 Inheritancekings, princes, rulers, judges and governors of the earth, and all other havingexcellent dignity on the same, in all places under the universal heavenâ, the letterproposed the establishment of commercial relations, arguing that âthe God ofheaven and earth greatly providing for mankind, would not that all things shouldbe found in one region, to the end that one should have need of another, that bythis means friendship might be established among all men, and every one seek togratify allâ.7 At about this time, Muscovite Russia was both a potential object of colonisa-tion and an actual coloniser. A year before Chancellorâs arrival in Moscow, Ivanthe Terrible had taken the town of Kazan on the Volga from one of the remnantsof the Mongol Tatars. Soon afterwards, Cossack freebooters â landward coun-terparts of Elizabethan seadogs â drove deep into Siberia in the search for gold,furs and other riches. Russian history had always been on the move, and this wasjust the latest stage in an expansion which had already been going on for severalcenturies. As far as the relative significance of English expansion to west and east towardsthe end of the sixteenth century is concerned, the chronicler Richard Hakluytgave some pertinent illustrations. For example, Christopher Carleill, Secretary toan English embassy to Moscow in 1568 and one of the most energetic promotersof overseas enterprise in the sixteenth century along with Hakluyt himself,attempted to secure the support of the Muscovy merchants for a transatlanticexpedition in 1583 with the observation that: As for the merchandising, which is the matter especially looked for, albeit that for the present we are not certainly able to promise any such like quan- tity, as is now at the best time of the Moscovian trade brought from thence: so likewise is there not demanded any such proportion of daily expenses, as was at the first, and as yet is consumed in that of Moscovia and others.8In other words, Carleill believed that in the not too distant future, the NorthAmerican colonies could provide the same kind of materials as Russia without thesame kind of haggle and hassle. In the fairly near future, too, Carleill and othersexpected that these same colonies would become a market for goods as well as asupplier of raw materials. At the death of Elizabeth in 1603, as David Cressy has pointed out in a tellingphrase, âher subjects in North America could be reckoned on the fingers of oneor two of her bony handsâ.9 Nevertheless, even before this date, an increasingnumber of projects for colonies were being put forward, not least by RichardHakluyt, who enumerated seventy-six separate occupations in five principalcategories as the basic manpower requirement for such an undertaking.10 Suchschemes multiplied in the seventeenth century throughout the reigns of the Stuartkings and the republican period under Oliver Cromwell, while Scotland and\n\nP:20\n\nInheritance 9Ireland were more fully incorporated in colonial projects in both an active and apassive manner.11 France and the Netherlands, along with Britain, caught up and overtook olderempire-builders such as Spain and Portugal, in a European-wide movement whichmight be placed under the general heading of modernisation. Generally speaking,Western Europe was more affected than Eastern Europe, but as we have alreadyseen, Russia was not omitted from the process, although responding to thechallenge in a manner more transcontinental than transoceanic. One of the mostinteresting analyses of this response has been made in a book on The Well-OrderedPolice State: Social and Institutional Change through Law in the Germanies and Russia,1600â1800, by Marc Raeff, who tells us how the use of the word âpoliceâ to meanadministration in the broadest sense came from classical roots to spreadthroughout Central and Eastern Europe by the seventeenth century. To aconsiderable extent, although unwittingly, the emergence of the well-orderedpolice state was promoted by the Western part of the continent in its internal andexternal economic activity. Within such a framework, Raeff remarks that âthecolonial experience was of particular interest and relevance, since it gave theadministrator from the homeland virtually free rein to shape the lives of thenatives for the purposes the colonial government demanded and expectedâ. Wehave already noted the formulation of schemes by Richard Hakluyt. For his part,Raeff pays special attention to the Jesuits in South America, remarking howamazing it is with the benefit of hindsight to observe the degree to which theyâprefigured the outlook, aims, and policies of enlightened absolutism in Austriaand Russia (especially with respect to peoples deemed to be on a lower level ofculture) and those of the well-organised police stateâ.12 Needless to say, forJesuits and enlightened absolutists alike, there was often a wide gap betweenaspiration and achievement. An older authority than Marc Raeff, Albion W. Small, points out that cameral-ism â the body of doctrine behind many police-state policies â came to be anequivalent for Central and Eastern Europe of the mercantilism adopted in muchof the West of the continent, especially when the process is described and definedin the following manner: The whole internal history of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, not only in Germany, but everywhere else, is summed up in the economic policy of the state to that of the town, the district, and the several Estates; the whole foreign history is summed up in the opposition to one another of the separate interests of the newly rising states, each of which sought to obtain and retain its place in the circle of European nations, and in the foreign trade which now included America and India. â¦ Mercantilism â¦ in its innermost kernel is nothing but state making â not state making in a narrow sense, but state making and national-economy making at the same time; state making in the\n\nP:21\n\n10 Inheritance modern sense, which creates out of the political community an economic community, and so gives it a heightened meaning.13 To look at Russia in particular, the third phase of the implementation of thegreat historian V.O. Kliuchevskiiâs fundamental fact of its history, colonisation in aboundless plain, began in the seventeenth century. First, there was Kievan Rus,then Muscovite Rus. Now there was the expansion leading towards the creation ofone of Tocquevilleâs âtwo great nationsâ. However, the first half of the century wasbasically a holding operation, a recovery from the traumatic shocks of the Time ofTroubles (1598â1613) that threatened to destroy Muscovy soon after the death ofIvan the Terrible. Not only was there internal strife at the end of a dynasty undersevere social pressures, but also the threat of takeover by foreign powers, Polandand Sweden. Under Michael, the first Romanov (1613â45), something like orderwas restored and the invaders pushed back. But it was not until the reign of thesecond Romanov, Alexis (1645â76), that Russia began to expand again, absorbingmuch of the Ukraine (or Little Russia, including the ancestral home of Kiev) andconsolidating interests in Siberia. At this time, government policies followed acentralising course that was as much traditional as influenced from outside,although innovatory enough to contribute to a schism in the Orthodox church.But more implementation of cameralist ideas, as well as fuller integration withEurope, would have to wait until the end of the seventeenth century and the reignof Peter the Great.14 Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the first successful colonies were beingfounded and developed along the North American coast: Virginia from 1607,Massachusetts from 1630 and so on. The character of the colonies would varyaccording to geographical circumstances and the nature of the foundation,opportunities for prosperity and the evolution of local administration. Already,American traditions such as those begun by the Plymouth Pilgrims in 1620 werein process of formation, with ideas of predestination becoming involved inintimations of Manifest Destiny. Walter LaFeber summarises American begin-nings as âGold, God and Paradiseâ. âThe birth of Americans as a separate peoplecame out of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century eventsâ, he observes, adding: âTheearly quests for wealth, personal salvation, westward empire, control of theworldâs centres of political and economic power, and supremacy in technology ledto both the settlement of America and its rise as the globeâs superpower.â Alreadyby 1630, John Winthrop in Massachusetts Bay was urging his fellow immigrants:âWe must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people areupon us.â Over and over again, these words have been quoted by Americanpoliticians, including Ronald Reagan, to sanction the USAâs world mission. AsLaFeber points out, far less quoted have been Winthropâs recommendations thatâThe care of the public must oversway all private aspectsâ and that the colonistsshould be willing âto abridge ourselves of superfluities for the supply of othersâ\n\nP:22\n\nInheritance 11necessitiesâ.15 Moreover, from the beginning, the Native Americans were notincluded in the great vision; and soon, seeds of later conflict would be propagatedby the import of African slaves to the South. As far as imperial administration wasconcerned, although the seventeenth century was disturbed enough in the mothercountry to keep the attention of Stuart and Cromwellian governments nearerhome on several occasions, what was known as the Old Colonial system onmercantilist foundations had been developed by the time of William and Mary atthe end of the century. Policies were far from rigorous for most of the time âindeed, there was a considerable degree of âbeneficial neglectâ â and some kind ofharmony was preserved for the most part between the interests of those overseasand those back in the metropolis.15 That both the steppe and transoceanic frontiers were subject to pressures fromthe European core may be illustrated by taking the example of Unfree Labor:American Slavery and Russian Serfdom. In his book with that title, Peter Kolchinpoints out that the two institutions: were part of the same historical process, despite the vastly differing societies in which they emerged. Both were products of geographic and economic expansion in areas of sparse settlement. â¦ In both countries a crisis in the labor supply finally forced landholders and the governments that depended on them to make arrangements that led to the spread and institutionalisation of new systems of unfree labor.16However, recourse to unfree labour does not mean so much backwardness asapartness. Indeed, both Russia and America were dynamic societies from the laterseventeenth century through the eighteenth. Peter the Great (1689â1725) andCatherine the Great (1762â96) were associated with two significant anddistinctive phases of the consolidation of absolutism along with empire. In thefirst phase, Russia gained its âWindow on the Westâ in the shape of the newcapital city of St Petersburg and the adjacent provinces on the Baltic Sea; in thesecond phase, the empire swallowed a large slice of Poland. In both phases, therewere probes towards the Black Sea and the Balkans, the Caspian Sea and CentralAsia, as well as increased activity right across Siberia and beyond the BeringStrait, over to Alaska and down to California. Further to the east, on the otherside of the North American continent, the dissatisfaction of the thirteen coloniesat not being able to expand beyond the line of the mountains was to contribute tothe frustrations culminating in the American Revolution.Democratic revolution (1776â1815)The American Revolution was a consequence of a crisis of empire. From 1754 to1763, Great Britain fought France for domination in North America and\n\nP:23\n\n12 Inheritanceelsewhere. Emerging the victors in 1763, the British had to work out a way ofpaying for their extended empire, which now included Canada as well as thethirteen colonies and most of the West Indies in the Western hemisphere, Indiaand other places to the East. The government in London decided that the Kingâssubjects across the Atlantic Ocean should be given clearer direction, in particularnot only to limit their movement beyond a proclaimed line, but also to help payfor their upkeep and defence. Taxation led to the first complaints about lack ofrepresentation. Import duties as an alternative were no more palatable, especiallywhen they were levied to help relieve the financial difficulties of the East IndiaCompany: hence the Boston Tea Party of December 1773, leading towards theContinental Congress of September 1774. In April 1775 the âshot heard roundthe worldâ was fired at Concord, and the American Revolution had begun. At firstprotesting against the unacceptable policies of Parliament, the insurgents turnedon their King and opted for independence in the famous declaration of 4 July1776. The hostilities allowed the French to attempt to regain through support of theAmerican Revolution what they had lost in 1763. Other imperial powers seizedthe opportunity to cut the British Empire down to size, with even the EmpressCatherine the Great of autocratic Russia participating in an armed neutrality andthreatening to send troops over to join in the fight against His Majesty KingGeorge IIIâs redcoats. When peace came along with independence in 1783, theUnited States found it difficult to establish firm government until the FederalConstitution was drawn up in 1787. At its beginning, however, this celebratedarrangement of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of the governmentwas far from being a promoter and guarantor of democracy. Indeed, when theFrench Revolution broke out in 1789, firm measures were taken to make surethat the pernicious Jacobin spirit did not infiltrate the USA. The wars raging in Europe then infiltrated the Western Hemisphere. Thealliance with France broke down, and there was renewed tension with GreatBritain. Yet the USA was able to exploit Napoleonâs difficulties in order to acquirethe whole of the Mississippi valley and its tributaries in the Louisiana Purchase of1803. Then, partly as a consequence of the high-handed actions of the Britishnavy on the high seas, and partly as British imperial activity on the NorthAmerican continent appeared to limit the westward expansion of the USA, aâsecond war for independenceâ was fought in 1812. Officially, peace on ChristmasEve 1814 meant to both sides acceptance of prewar boundaries. Unofficially, theUSAâs confidence in its own ability to survive and prosper had received aconsiderable boost. By 1815, the USA was well on the way to becoming a powerin the Pacific as well as the Atlantic, with Yankee traders taking over fromImperial Russia the fur trade from Alaska to Oregon and selling their wares overin China as well as back home. By this time too, the application in a âcan doâ spirit\n\nP:24\n\nInheritance 13of new technology ranging from the steamboat to the cotton gin was beginning toopen up the continent to dynamic exploitation. From the point of view of the future superpowers, the Democratic Revolutionof 1776â1815 has far more significance for the USA than for Russia. Neverthe-less, the long reign of Catherine the Great from 1762 to 1796 marked animportant stage in the development of the Soviet Unionâs Tsarist predecessor. Inthe first place, her âenlightened absolutismâ was far more than a cover for herhypocrisy, and was nothing less than a skilful attempt to create a constitutionalmonarchy. Secondly, the lack of success of Russian America should not blind us tothe fact that, by the European standards of the period, the Russian economy wasone of the most powerful in the late eighteenth century. The legacy thatCatherine left was strong enough for her successors and their advisers tonegotiate the threat posed by the French Revolution and then to triumph overNapoleon. In 1815, Alexander I was one of the major arbiters of the post-Napoleonic settlement. Less obviously, perhaps, the period 1776â1815 was one of cultural self-assertion for both the USA and Russia, even if both tended to follow a Europeanlead at the beginning of it. For, if Bernard Bailyn is correct in his observation thatâAmerican culture in this early period becomes more fully comprehensive whenseen as the exotic far western periphery, a marchland, of the European culturesystemâ,17 something similar might be said of much Russian culture at that periodas well. However, there were also significant differences. First of all, there is theproblem of Old Russian Culture, with both its pagan folkways and its OrthodoxChristianity. Eighteenth-century Russian writers had to consider this heritage aswell as the desirability of the import of foreign models. Eighteenth-centuryAmerican writers, on the other hand, depended almost entirely on such import,both secular and religious, along with the continual process of immigration. Asyet, they had neither assimilated much of Native American culture nor respondedfully to the influence of their new setting. If we concentrate on the radiation of British culture, further points of interestemerge, including the fundamental circumstance that it would often come toRussia in translation through German or other intermediaries. This wouldobviously mean a considerable time lag in continental cultural transference,although such chronological breaks would often be found on the Atlantic side too.When weeks or even months were necessary for the crossing of the ocean, theperiphery could always have the feeling that what was fresh for it was alreadybecoming stale in the core. This would be a short-term reaction. In the longerterm, there was a more profound disorientation. For example, as the AmericanRevolution of 1776 approached, at least part of the debate centred around theâGlorious and Bloodlessâ Revolution of 1688â9, no longer so vital in England,Scotland and Ireland. For Jefferson and his fellows, the writings of John Lockewere more pertinent documents than for their British sympathisers.18\n\nP:25\n\n14 Inheritance As much as time, space was a problem in the adaptation of the metropolitanculture to the frontier. Distance lent enchantment to the view, so that rather thanallowing the new environment to influence them, colonists in Russia and Americaalike more usually attempted to superimpose the metropolitan culture upon thefrontier. Let us remember too, that until the end of the eighteenth century, thewilder splendours of nature were not considered to be objects of veneration.Travellers on the Grand Tour normally hurried through the Alps as the price tobe paid for the wonders of Italy. Until the arrival of the Romantic veneration ofnature in the nineteenth century, then, it was difficult for American and Russianculture fully to come to terms with the grandeur of their own respectivefrontiers. Let us take just one basis for cultural comparison, the linguistic. In his Disserta-tions on the English Language, published in 1789, the same year as the onset of theFrench Revolution, Noah Webster declared: âI am constrained to declare that thepeople of America, in particular the English descendants, speak the most pureEnglish now known in the world.â19 Hence, simultaneously, at least some of theinhibition of and stimulus towards the development of an American literature at atime when Russian literature, we may recall, was also finding difficulty in makingits way owing to the persistence of foreign models. For, while Russian would beincluded in the Indo-European family of languages being identified towards theend of the eighteenth century, its Greek-derived alphabet would continue to cut itoff from the Latin-based mainstream, in spite of the effort of Catherine the Greatand others. To sum up so far, towards the end of the eighteenth century the early moderndevelopment of Russia and North America as peripheries of Europe, building onthe medieval legacy, was coming to an end. The struggle for European empire, inwhich both transcontinental and transoceanic frontiers played important roles,partly active and partly passive, was reaching a turning point. The Americanrevolutionaries showed that they could adapt the imperial urge before theirdescendants could give it their own distinctive flavour in the âmanifest destinyâ ofthe nineteenth century. The French revolutionaries, to some extent following inthe American wake, completed the introduction of a new political rhetoric alongwith a new direction for European and world history. The years 1776 to 1815therefore constituted an important watershed or conjuncture in the rise of theâtwo great nationsâ. Moreover, two further developments may be placed in this period of aboutforty years: the first specific realisation of the future significance of theAmericanâRussian relationship; and the intensification of the phenomenon thatwe have come to know as Russophobia. Direct relations concerned science as wellas diplomacy.20 More generally, just after the beginning of the AmericanRevolution in 1776, the American diplomat Silas Deane observed in 1777 thatâRussia like America is a new state, and rises with astonishing rapidityâ.21 Then in\n\nP:26\n\nInheritance 151780, Russia played a leading part in the armed neutrality which brought aboutthe first diplomatic contacts between the forerunners of the superpowers andmade a positive if minor contribution to the successful outcome of the AmericanRevolution a year or so later. Soon after the outbreak of the French Revolution in1789, one of her European correspondents, Baron Melchior von Grimm, wroteto Catherine the Great in 1790 of a future in which: Two empires will then share all the advantages of civilisation, of the power of genius, of letters, arts, arms and industry: Russia on the eastern side, and America, having become free in our own time, on the western side, and we other peoples of the nucleus will be too degraded, too debased, to know otherwise than by a vague and stupid tradition what we have been.22Grimm was inaccurate in other aspects of his prophecy; he believed that theFrench Revolution would hasten the downfall of Europe, for example. Neverthe-less, both he and Silas Deane before him had clearly seen what was happening onthe peripheries of the continent. As far as early Russophobia is concerned, when Alexander I joined an alliedcoalition against Napoleon in 1805, the fear spread across the Atlantic that, if theFrench were defeated by the Russians, these latter-day Goths and Vandals wouldoverrun Europe and then threaten the USA. Then, when the Russians and otherswere defeated by Napoleon at the battle of Austerlitz in 1805, an Americancommentator exclaimed that the neo-barbarian leaders, the âAlarics and Attilas ofmodern timesâ were âchained to their mountainsâ[!]. More generally, an Americanjournalist wrote that the vast expansion of Russia along with the FrenchRevolution would probably determine the future of Europe, looking upon Russiaas âmore favourably situated for the prosecution of a boundless scheme ofconquest, than any nation that has ever existedâ.23âTwo great nationsâ (1815â56)During the years before and after Alexis de Tocquevilleâs famous prediction of thefuture superpowers as âtwo great nationsâ predestined to share world domination,the American people went forth and multiplied. In what seemed no time at all,the USA acquired vast lands to the west of the Mississippi, at the expense ofSpain, Russia and Great Britain and, above all, of Mexicans and other NativeAmericans. Following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 from France, the USA consolidatedits hold on Florida in 1818, and at the same time acquired from Spain its rights tothe Pacific Coast. There as before, the interests of the USA clashed with those ofother powers. In 1821, Alexander I of Russia proclaimed his rights from Alaska toSan Francisco and thus helped to prompt President Monroe to include in his\n\nP:27\n\n16 Inheritanceannual address to Congress of 1823 the three fundamental principles which cameto be known as the Monroe Doctrine. The first, aspiring for âamicable negotia-tionâ concerning the north-west coast with both Russia and Great Britain, wasthat âthe American continents, by the free and independent condition which theyhave assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects forfuture colonization by any European powersâ. The second, with an eye on âtheheroic struggle of the Greeksâ for independence from the Turks, was: âIn the warsof the European powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken anypart, nor does it comport with our policy so to do.â And the third, after notingthe essential difference between the political system of those powers and that ofAmerica, warned that âwe should consider any attempt on their part to extendtheir system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace andsafetyâ. The reassurance was added, if more to be acknowledged before thenineteenth century came to an end in the breach rather than the observance, that:âWith the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have notinterfered and shall not interfere.â24 In 1846, in spite of a recent election slogan, âFifty-four forty or fightâ, a dealwas struck with Great Britain to divide Canada from the Oregon territory at theforty-ninth parallel, and the long-impending war with Mexico finally broke out.By 1848, the USA had incorporated Texas and acquired the territories of NewMexico and California. In 1850, agreement was reached with Great Britainconcerning their respective rights to any future isthmian canal in CentralAmerica. At this time, US spokesmen were not as assertive in Latin America asthey later became. Nevertheless, both the dollar and the Bible were to be foundincreasingly all round the great ocean as merchants and missionaries followed inthe wake of the first intrepid explorers. Of course, there were periods ofdepression as well as of prosperity, but the overall impression of the years 1815 to1856 has to be of a rapidly expanding nation sweeping all before it. In the North American continent, this process was to engulf the originalinhabitants. When in 1831 Chief Justice John Marshall could rule that an Indiantribe may not have been a âforeign stateâ but it was âa distinct political societyâdependent on US law, President Andrew Jackson challenged his rival to enforcehis decision and moved the Cherokees on from a part of Georgia where gold hadbeen discovered.25 The doctrine that the only good Indian was a dead Indian wasyet to be fully enunciated, however, and in any case, brute force was not enoughtotally to justify the treatment of Native Americans and others standing in thepath of what was widely believed to be progress. Building on religious traditionsbegun with the Mayflower and to be developed with the secular admixture ofSocial Darwinism in the later part of the century, the concept of âManifestDestinyâ emerged clearly in the roaring 1840s. To put the point simply, God haddecided that the USA should carry out a special mission, to civilise as much aspossible of the North American continent and beyond. Variations of the idea\n\nP:28\n\nInheritance 17abounded in the journalism and literature of the period. To give just oneexample, in a lecture read in Boston in 1844 by Ralph Waldo Emerson: We cannot look on the freedom of this country, in connection with its youth, without a presentiment that here shall laws and institutions exist on some scale of proportion to the majesty of nature. To men legislating for the area betwixt the two oceans, betwixt the snows and the tropics, somewhat of the grandeur of nature will infuse itself into the code. â¦ It seems so easy for America to inspire and express the most expansive and humane spirit; new- born, free, healthful, strong, the land of the labourer, of the democrat, of the philanthropist, of the believer, of the saint, she should speak for the human race.26 In 1847, a representative of âthe land of the labourerâ spoke out on behalf ofUS engineers supervising the construction of railroads in the other âgreat nationâwhich was also in process of development: âWho knows but in a few years thenow Russian serf may stand a free man â¦ as he beholds the locomotive fleetingpast â¦ and bless God that the mechanics of Washingtonâs land were permitted toscatter the seeds of social freedom in benighted Russiaâ.27 Leaving aside for themoment the vexed question of the USAâs own unfree labour â Black slavery â wemust certainly recognise that from the point of view of railroad constructionRussia lagged far behind: by 1860, there were more than 30,000 miles of railroadin operation in the USA, and little more than 1,000 in Russia. The gap was greatas far as other indices of industrialisation were concerned. While the totalpopulation of Russia far exceeded that of the USA at mid-century by a ratio of 3:1(69 million as opposed to 23 million), American natural rates of growth and ofurbanisation were higher. About 65 per cent of the American people wereengaged in agriculture, compared to about 90 per cent of the Russian population.The reasons for the comparative slowness of Russian growth were partlygeographical, partly institutional: natural resources were unhelpfully distributed,and the Tsarist government feared social change. Nevertheless, the Tsaristeconomy was far from static; there was significant export of grain, for example.Ralph Waldo Emerson, for one, had no difficulty in including Russia along withthe USA in a celebration of the impact of modern science: âWhen its errands arenoble and adequate, a steamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old and NewEngland, and arriving at its ports with the punctuality of a planet â is a step ofman into harmony with nature. The boat at St. Petersburg, which plies along theNeva by magnetism, needs little to make it sublime.â28 Moreover, the boundaries of Russia were expanding ever more widely after thefinal victory over Napoleon in 1815. Finland to the north-west and Bessarabia tothe south-west were more completely incorporated, as were Georgia, Azerbaidz-han and Armenia beyond the Caucasus. Tsarist forces pushed into Central Asia,\n\nP:29\n\n18 Inheritancewhile the hold on Siberia was consolidated by comprehensive administrativereforms in 1822.29 However, while the island of Sakhalin in the Pacific wasoccupied, the Tsarist government found it difficult to maintain its influence onthe North American continent. Major energies were devoted to the maintenanceof law and order nearer home, which included East and Central Europe at timesof revolution, notably in 1830 and 1848. Tsar Nicholas I himself wrote themanifesto of March 1848, lamenting the outbreak of rebellion and lawlessness inPrussia and Austria and the menace which they presented to âour holy Russiaâ.Summoning the people to arouse themselves for âfaith, Tsar and countryâ, hethreatened to march the army to the Rhine, but in the end limited his armyâsactivities to intervention in Hungary.30 (With a different excuse, the move was tobe repeated by the Soviet government in 1956.) The alarm of other Europeanpowers at the threat posed by Nicholas I in the Black Sea was a major contributorto the Crimean War of 1854â6. Arguably, the expansionist behaviour of Tsarist Russia was similar to that of theUSA. At the time of Nicholas Iâs intervention in Hungary, let us recall, the USAwas bringing to an end its war with Mexico. However, the principal difference layin the respective ideologies. While âManifest Destinyâ certainly had its lessattractive features, it also proclaimed a democratic impulse. The Tsarist ideologyof âfaith, Tsar and countryâ or of âorthodoxy, autocracy and nationalityâ was lessgenerally acceptable. There were very few American intellectual dissidents duringthe first half of the nineteenth century: many bitter political arguments but allwithin the same constitutional framework. In Russia, however, there were aconsiderable number of such malcontents, notably at the death of Alexander I in1825. At the end of that year, drawing variously on the precedents of theAmerican and French Revolutions, the members of the Decembrist movementstaged an abortive revolt. The leaders, we must stress, were members of thenobility. Five were hanged, many more were exiled to Siberia, and Russian societywas never the same again. Tsarist autocracy or republican democracy, comparisons between the futuresuperpowers continued throughout the period 1815â56. As we have already seen,Alexis de Tocquevilleâs famous prediction of 1835 did not come like a bolt fromthe blue: Melchior von Grimm and others had made comparable forecasts duringthe years of the Democratic Revolution. This point may be reinforced by taking aglance at some other predecessors. For example, in 1818, an Englishman namedJohn Bristed brought out in London and New York a book entitled The Resources ofthe United States of America. It was later published in German, in 1819, and inFrench in 1826 and 1832. John Bristed observed that America âis rapidlyemerging into unparalleled greatness; is flaming upwards, like a pyramid of fire,so that all the Western horizon is in a blaze with the brightness of its ascendinggloryâ. America was playing a waiting game with the Holy Alliance of Russia,Prussia and Austria formed soon after the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Then,\n\nP:30\n\nInheritance 19it would gradually âbear down all possible opposition from any single foeâ. Bristeddeclared: Behold another and a greater Russia here. With a better territory, a better government, and a better people, America is ripening fast into a substance, an attitude of power, which will prove far more terrible to the world than it is ever possible for the warriors of the Don or the defenders of Moscow to overcome. Several other figures, less well-known than Alexis de Tocqueville, had dis-cussed the joint future of America and Russia before his celebrated observation of1835. In 1827, the US diplomat Alexander Hill Everett wrote of Russia as animmense military empire âadvancing with giant steps to the conquest of the westâwhich if completed would mean âa return to barbarismâ. Such an eventualitywould probably be averted âbecause the principle of civilisations and improve-ment will be powerfully sustained by aid from abroad, that is, from Americaâ.And Michel Chevalier, engineer turned economist and politician, declared in aletter to the Journal des DÃ©bats in April 1834, two years before the publication ofhis own book on American civilisation, that there were âtwo great figures whichare rising today at both ends of the horizon â¦ two young colossi who watch eachother from one shore of the Atlantic to the other and touch each other on thebanks of the Pacific Oceanâ, which would probably soon divide among themselvesthe âdominion of the worldâ. Chevalier also asserted that âthe struggle betweenthe East and the Westâ was âthe most general fact in the history of the civilisationto which we belongâ, expressing at the same time the thought that America mightbe best able to reconcile the two. On the whole, conflict between the two greatnations was not foreseen as much as their rise to world power in the place of thenations of Europe. In 1845, ten years after the publication of TocquevilleâsDemocracy in America, the Journal des DÃ©bats echoed Von Grimm in an editorialleader showing alarm about the American annexation of Texas at the expense ofMexico: âBetween the Russian autocracy in the East and the democracy of theUnited States thus enlarged in the West, Europe could find itself compressedmore than would comport with its independence and its dignityâ.31 But apprehension concerning the spread of the USA never reached the pro-portions of that concerning the expansion of Tsarist Russia. This, after all, hadroots stretching as far back into history and was exacerbated by Russiaâs behaviourtowards Europe in and around the revolutions of 1830 and 1848. In his SecretDiplomacy of the Eighteenth Century, published first as newspaper articles from 1856to 1857, Karl Marx wrote: It is in the terrible and abject school of Mongolian slavery that Muscovy was nursed and grew up. It gathered strength only by becoming a virtuoso in the\n\nP:31\n\n20 Inheritance craft of serfdom. Even when emancipated, Muscovy continued to perform its traditional part of the slave as master. At length Peter the Great coupled the political craft of the Mongol slave with the proud aspiration of the Mongol master, to whom Genghis Khan had, by will, bequeathed his conquest of the earth.32The Petrine and earlier legacies combined with Catherine the Greatâs leading partin the partitions of Poland and other expansive policies to produce by the end ofthe eighteenth century the phenomenon known as Russophobia, which was thento grow stronger in the early nineteenth century. Another potential conflict detected just before the outbreak of the CrimeanWar deserves at least summary mention. Edouard de Stoeckl, the Russian chargÃ©dâaffaires in Washington DC, believed that an alternative struggle might developbetween the major English-speaking peoples. As the historian Frank Golderreported Stoecklâs views as expressed early in 1854, they have an undiplomaticapocalyptic quality more appropriate for some of the enthused sermons of theperiod: It will be a battle of giants, he said, the earth will tremble, commerce will be crushed, the world will suffer; but there will be certain gains to civilisation, nevertheless. Weakened England will stop meddling in other peopleâs affairs and exhausted America will cease to protect revolutionists and to cause trouble to other states. â¦ The Americans will go after anything that has enough money in it. They have the ships, they have the men, and they have the daring spirit. â¦ When America was weak she refused to submit to England and now that she is strong she is much less likely to do so. When the Crimean War actually broke out between Russia on the one handand Britain, France and their allies on the other around about the time thatStoecklâs note was being received in St Petersburg, the USA refrained fromjoining in the hostilities; nevertheless, by the time the war was over two yearslater, in Golderâs estimation, âthe United States was the only nation in the worldthat was neither ashamed nor afraid to acknowledge boldly her friendship forRussiaâ. But diplomacy and national interest were one thing; attitudes towards afriendly power outside official communication could be another.33 To qualify completely as two great nations, the USA and Russia needed notonly to command enormous power, but also develop their distinctive cultures asthey developed their empires. European models had to be discarded, andindigenous creative spirits fostered. More will be said on this below.34\n\nP:32\n\nInheritance 21Two great empires (1856â98)Both future superpowers suffered the experience of war on their own soil early inthe second half of the nineteenth century. Russia was invaded again little morethan forty years after Napoleon had reached Moscow. On this occasion, hostilitiesfrom 1854â6 were confined mostly to the Black Sea and the Crimea. Yet theinternational consequences were significant, the alignment of the Europeanpowers was determined for several years to come, and some of the rivalriesexacerbated by the conflict were to influence the nature of the onset of the FirstWorld War. Internally, the poor performance of the Russian armed forces was amajor reason for the emancipation of the Russian serfs. Similarly, the AmericanCivil War from 1861â5 was to lead to the liberation of the Afro-American slaves.Like most events of its kind, the war was passionate and bloody, and left scarswhich took a long time to fade. In the short run, the victory of the Northaccelerated the process of industrialisation, and the achievement by the USA ofgreat power status. The first shots in the American Civil War were fired just a few weeks afternews had crossed the Atlantic of the Russian emancipation of the serfs. Now theabolitionist element in the war aims of the North encouraged some of its journalsto reverse completely their previous image of Russian despotism and of theabsolute Tsar. For example, The Atlantic Monthly declared: âHe is the Greatest ofRussian benefactors in all these thousand years â the Warrior who restored peace,the Monarch who had faith in Godâs will to make order, and a manâs will to keeporder, the Christian Patriot who made forty millions of serfs forty millions ofmen â Alexander the Second â ALEXANDER THE EARNEST.â And Harperâs Weeklycould go as far as to compare Alexander IIâs repression of the Polish Insurrectionof 1863 with the attempt of Abraham Lincoln to prevent the South from secedingfrom the Union, observing that: Russia, like the United States, is a nation of the future. â¦ To two such peo- ples, firmly bound together by an alliance as well as by traditional sympathy and good feeling, what would be impossible? â¦ An alliance between Russia and the United States at the present time would relieve both of us from all apprehensions of foreign interference.35 Yet beneath the journalistic rhetoric there was a deep-seated mutual suspicionbetween the Russians and the Americans, which different times would bring oncemore to the surface. Abraham Lincoln did not change his views of a countrywhere âthey make no pretence of loving libertyâ, and would probably have beenappalled by some of the remarks made about him by official Russia after hisassassination, even though he would have been flattered by those of Leo Tolstoy,who wrote that the âgreatness of Napoleon, Caesar or Washington is only\n\nP:33\n\n22 Inheritancemoonlight by the sun of Lincoln.â36 And the Russian chargÃ© dâaffaires, Edouard deStoeckl, could at the same time work for co-operation between his own countryand the USA while expressing no confidence in the American political system: The experience of recent years has taught us how easy it is to manipulate the universal suffrage in all ways everywhere. In the United States the institution has been cleverly exploited by a bunch of politicians of the lowest class, who through corruption and flattery of the passions of the populace, have come to exercise an absolute control over the elections.37De Stoecklâs condemnation of the absolutism of universal suffrage did not comeout of the blue; it was indeed a variation on a theme enunciated by Russian criticsearlier in the nineteenth century, and would be enlarged upon by others later. But there was also a Russian admiration for the USA, stretching back beyondthe Decembrists. To give a good later example, however, in 1865, as the AmericanCivil War came to an end, in Letters to a Traveller Alexander Herzen tookAmericanâRussian comparisons in particular to a new level, also echoingTocqueville and other predecessors while anticipating later commentators andanalysts. He declared: âClassless, democratic America and peasant Russia, whichis moving towards classlessness, remain for me, as before, the countries of theimmediate futureâ. Of Russia in particular he wrote: âAside from the village, noone feels any attachment for anything, and everybody either feels or understandsthat everything else is like a temporary shack that has been given the outwardappearance of an old and solid buildingâ. By âeverything elseâ and âtemporaryshackâ, we are given to understand that Herzen means not only the autocracy ofthe Tsars and the privileges of the nobility but also the institution of privateproperty. Similarly, the USA was for Herzen a fragment of Europe cut off from itsânative soil, from palaces, from the Middle Agesâ and freed from the âhistoricalshackles of monarchy and aristocracyâ. However, he observed that, while leavingcertain negative features of European thought and practice such as the classsystem behind them, immigrants had imported to North America some of thebest features, the Common Law, for example. So both Russia and the USA wereuntrammelled by many burdens of the past, the latter thereby possessing actualfreedom while the essential spirit of the former was one of the inner freedom.Comparing the respective processes of expansion, he declared: The United States sweeps everything from its path, like an avalanche. Every inch which the United States seizes is taken away from the natives forever. Russia surrounds adjoining territories like an expanding body of water, pulls them in and covers them with an even, uniformly coloured layer of auto- cratic ice.\n\nP:34\n\nInheritance 23Herzen also made some interesting remarks about the literary evocation of thelives of American and Russian settlers, likening the novels of Fenimore Cooper toSergei Aksakovâs Family Chronicles. However, his most striking observation was aprediction, that the problem of the future was not a choice between individualfreedom and socialism, but their reconciliation in a higher form of existence. AsHerzen put it: The North American States and Russia represent two solutions which are opposite but incomplete, and which therefore complement rather than ex- clude each other. A contradiction which is full of life and development, which is open-ended, without finality, without physiological discord â that is not a challenge to enmity and combat, not a basis for an attitude of un- sympathetic indifference, but a basis for efforts to remove this formal contra- diction with the help of something broader â if only through mutual understanding.38Unfortunately, Herzenâs prediction was not to be fully realised in either the shortor the long run. Nevertheless, in the following thirty years or so and then into thetwentieth century, some sort of understanding was on occasion approached, ifmore normally avoided in pursuit of aims far narrower. Both the future superpowers were expansionist powers during this period. In1864, the Russian Chancellor Prince Alexander Gorchakov made the accommo-dating remark: âThe United States in America, France in Algeria, Holland in herColonies, England in India â all have been irresistibly forced, less by ambitionthan by imperious necessity, into this onward march, where the greatest difficultyis to know where to stop.â39 Russia was no exception: in 1860, the Russianimperial standard was raised on the Pacific Coast over a group of huts namedVladivostok, âLord of the Eastâ. Nevertheless in 1867, the Tsarist governmentrevealed the limits of its aspirations in the sale of Alaska to the USA, signalling itsintention to withdraw from North America and concentrate on the Eurasian landmass. On the other side, although Secretary of State W.H. Seward was at firstheavily criticised for his folly in spending $7,200,000 dollars on an âice boxâ, hewas posthumously forgiven even before the discovery of gold in the Yukon in1896.40 And while Russia rounded out its frontiers in Central Asia as much as themountains and British opposition would allow, the USA not only subdued the restof the Natives to establish full possession of its large slice of North America whileincreasing its grip on Central and South America, but also pushed out into thePacific Ocean, acquiring Hawaii, establishing a firm foothold in Samoa andreaching over to Japan and China. Internal and external expansion were con-nected, since the official closure of the frontier in 1890 was marked by historianFrederick Jackson Turner and soon followed by the insistence of Captain A.T.Mahan that the USA must look outward: Manifest Destiny was on the move.\n\nP:35\n\n24 Inheritance Frontiers were far from closed in Russia, which was seized in the late nine-teenth century by the spirit of Panslavism as the Ottoman Empire was pushedback and more of its blood relations freed from the Turkish yoke. To be sure, theKaiser attempted to persuade the Tsar to reduce his concentration on the Balkansand elsewhere in Europe, and to switch his major attention to the Far East. ButNicholas II was to find himself, like his father Alexander III before him, firmlycaught up in the Balkan imbroglio that was to lead to the First World War. Europewas one area in which the USA had no possibility of expansion, and successivepresidents, whether conscious of it or not, adhered to the less well-knownprinciples of the Monroe Doctrine concerning that continent. But the USA wasnot isolationist, playing at least a modest part in international conferences inBerlin and The Hague.41 Because of the different international interests of the USA and Russia, therewas no serious confrontation between them before 1898. Reflecting theharmonious relations of the time, Russian naval officers had sailed into theharbour they dubbed âVladivostokâ on a steam corvette named Amerika in 1859,42before giving the same title to the modest land settlement in the summer of1860. Just a few years later, during his survey of Kamchatka and Chukotka for aprojected (but never completed) telegraph route under the Bering Strait, GeorgeKennan came across American cooking utensils, linen, magazines, lithographs andmusic. When Henry Adams wrote in 1891 that the Americanizing of Siberia wasthe only challenge the Pacific region offered to the United States, Russians andAmericans enjoyed mostly friendly relations in what was still a challengingwilderness even for the indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, relatively, we can see aclear division between the two future superpowers which could produce the firstserious disputes between them at the turn of the century. In the year 1898, therewere signs of collaboration as the Tsarist government lifted import duties on USagricultural machinery, and President McKinley appointed the first US consul inVladivostok.43 Soon, however, antagonism would flare up in Manchuria.44 Yet what appeared for the most part to be good relations were underminedless by geopolitical considerations than by a clash of values. George Kennan gavewide publicity to the convict system operating in Siberia. Even more seriously,news began to arrive in the USA from the 1880s of the Russian pogroms, fromwhich large numbers of Jews fled across the Atlantic. And US businessmen, bothJew and Gentile, found themselves up against discrimination when they tried tooperate in the Tsarist empire. These latter restrictions were by no meansexclusively the consequence of bureaucratic tradition or racial prejudice. TheRussian economy simply could not accommodate the Open Door advocated by itsmost dynamic rival. Between 1860 and 1900, the US population more thandoubled to 71 million, a consequence of vigorous natural growth and massimmigration. Wheat production tripled, while coal extraction increased eightfoldand the manufacture of steel and rails rose fivefold. By 1898, 55 million barrels of\n\nP:36\n\nInheritance 25oil were being produced per annum. Of course there were serious setbacks, bustsas well as booms, industrial strife as well as harmony, but from 1874, US exportsregularly exceeded imports. Europeans in general began to fear âThe AmericanInvadersâ and even âThe Americanization of the Worldâ.45 The Russians in particular were nowhere in the same league, even though theywere far from inert. The emancipation of the serfs of 1861 contributed to aconsiderable growth in the production of wheat and other cereals, and a sevenfoldrise in grain exports in the second half of the nineteenth century. Coal, steel andiron all increased in output, but at a lower level than in the USA, while Russian oilproduction had barely begun. Only in numbers of people did the tsarist empireoutstrip the democratic republic, 125 million by 1897. But nearly 90 per cent ofthe population were peasants, the low proportion of town dwellers reflecting thelag in industrialisation.46 Considering Russia and America: The Roots of Economic Divergence,47 ColinWhite rejects the term âmodernisationâ because it cannot include significantchange occurring before periods which can properly be deemed modern, andbecause it prejudges the importance of its component activities. Nevertheless, heconcentrates on what most historians would consider to be modern periods,which also give his work a clear sense of direction. Accepting that there are fourphases of economic development â pioneering, commercial, industrial andplanning â he adds the key concept of a formative period. During this period, thebasic principles of institutional organisation in any given society are established. InWhiteâs estimation, the closing date of the formative period was the 1780s for theUnited States and the 1580s for Russia. In the 1780s, the United States achieved alasting constitution protecting market institutions, rejected the Proclamation Lineholding back settlement beyond the Appalachians, and consolidated their pre-revolutionary core to the east of those mountains. In the 1580s, Tsarist Russiatook a large stride towards the establishment of a service state based on serfdom(although the process neared completion in 1649), crossed the Urals into Siberia(although another seventeenth-century process, the movement into the steppe,was also important), and, less clearly than in the transatlantic case, crystallised acore around Moscow (with a significant persistence of openness to attack). Whitefinds neither the neoclassical approach following Adam Smith in which âeconomicagents are rational economic menâ nor the Marxist analysis based on the classstruggle a comprehensive guide to the phases of development, considering thatthe environment of competition or conflict in which both schools operate ignoresthe more universal wish for security. Societies are organised not only to promoteprosperity but also to lessen or manage risk. White next examines what he calls âstylised factsâ and asks several pertinentquestions. He looks at the size and nature of native populations, reminding usthat, while the pre-contact figures for North America vary from 4.4 to as many as12.5 million, higher at their most conservative than those for Moscowâs outliers,\n\nP:37\n\n26 Inheritanceassimilation of Red and Black peoples occurred to a much smaller extent thanamong their counterparts in Russia, which therefore constituted a more completemelting-pot. He makes the necessary point that the opening-up of the respectivefrontiers was a more complex process than has often been assumed. Recognisingthat there has been no more impressive saga of modern times than the explora-tion and settlement by the American and Russian peoples of their respectivecontinental areas, he indicates that the process was much more protracted in thelatter case, where spurts occurred both before and after the mostly nineteenth-century action in the former. Government policies as well as variations in basicgeography were responsible for differences in the two sets of coreâperipheryinteractions during the pioneering phase. Similar considerations would apply tothe later commercial and industrial development. Here again Russia, as it were,missed out on the nineteenth century, reaching the commercial phase only at thevery end, a century or so later than the USA, and the decisive industrial phase inthe 1930s as opposed to the USAâs 1880s. The reasons for this disparity are among the subject matter for the secondand third parts of the book, entitled âRisk, Resources and Natural Environmentâand âRisk, Regimes and the Human Environmentâ, respectively. These two partsare seen by White as the pith of his book, calling for some of the skills not onlyof the economist and the historian, but also of the geographer, anthropologist,sociologist, demographer, political scientist, lawyer, statistician and even linguist.(For a full attack on the subject, even further specialities could be called intoservice, not least those of the literary critic and the philosopher, as we will soonsee. Indeed, virtually all fields of human enquiry could be summoned into thediscussion, but that could be an unattainable ideal. Limits have to be setsomewhere.) Within the broad limits that White has imposed upon himself, he presents achallenging enlargement of his thesis. Discussing gardens and deserts â that is, thebenign and malign influences of the physical environment â he recalls that if theseare considered in too simple a manner, the conclusion would follow that NativeAmericans would have been the first to undertake an industrial revolution.Following several previous authorities, he indicates that the arrangement ofnatural assets was less favourable in the Russian case. Again, the cards weresomewhat stacked as far as the socio-economic impact of natural assets wasconcerned: âThere can be little doubt that Russian society was more âshockedâthan American â more frequently, more severely, more extensively and moreinopportunely.â For such reasons, pioneer risk-taking was found to a lesser extentin Siberia than in the Western states. If immediate survival is the major aim, therecan be little thought for long-term profit. But, of course, as with all general rules,there must be exceptions, such as the activities of the Stroganovs and other fur-traders, to cite just one. On the other hand, circumstances such as thosedescribed by White also account for the differences between the American and\n\nP:38\n\nInheritance 27Russian applications of technology, the Yankee âcan doâ spirit as opposed to themore fatalist outlook of the Muscovite. Turning to human factors more generally, White focuses first on the creationof government, the political divergence between autocracy and democracy, andthen on the creation of markets, as affected by such factors as opportunities forcommercial risk, the distribution of land and resources, and demographicarrangement. As far as the interaction between government and markets isconcerned, he again stresses the impact of the environment, for example in thevital sector of transport. At the end as at the beginning, White gives emphasis tothe manner in which choice of option has been greatly influenced by the weight ofthe past. Rather surprisingly, he says little about the converse of his theme, theeconomic convergence that used to be so popular among some colleagues,particularly those specialising in the industrial and planning phases of develop-ment. Is the weight of the past so great that convergence is generally accepted asan impossibility? If so, more than a dozen years after his book was published andmore than a decade since the Soviet system began its collapse, what hope is therefor the introduction of the advanced market economy in todayâs Russia?47 We will tackle this question later. For the moment, let us note that, in thenineteenth century, Russia lagged behind America in cultural as well as economicdevelopment, as numbers of schools and universities increased in both societies,but much more in the USA. In Russia, the preponderance of peasants meant thepersistence of tradition, as was clearly revealed in the âcrazyâ summer of 1874when thousands of mostly young crusaders attempted to take the message ofmodernity to the people. Often dressed as peasants and attempting to put theirarguments in a similarly homespun manner, the preachers found few converts andmany more sceptics, even opponents. But Russian opposition to Tsarism neverceased, soon moving on from a populist to a revolutionary phase. In the USA,nearly everybody shared the American dream, even many of those who lived anAmerican nightmare in urban and rural deprivation alike. To be sure, violentsuppression also contributed to the comparatively low level of protest. But,within the more democratic parameters, there was much more open debateamong women as well as men, increasingly stimulated by newspapers andmagazines. And there was much more following of fashion, from bicycles tobloomers.48 As always from the eighteenth century onwards, clear reflections of Americanand Russian culture can be found in their literature. We have traced above thefirst halting steps of both outliers of Europe in the age of the DemocraticRevolution. Concerning later development in the national and imperial phases,the critic George Steiner reminds us of the writer D.H. Lawrenceâs observationthat âTwo bodies of modern literature seem to me to have come to a real verge:the Russian and the Americanâ, as he himself recommends us to look in the same\n\nP:39\n\n28 Inheritanceplaces for the reconciliation of the modern novel with âthe essential world view ofthe epic and of tragedy.â In Steinerâs view, both frontiers: lacked even that sense of geographical stability and cohesion which the Euro- pean novel took for granted. Both nations combined immensity with the awareness of a romantic and vanishing frontier. What the Far West and the Red Man were to American mythology, the Caucasus and its warring tribes, or the unspoiled communities of Cossacks and Old Believers on the Don and the Volga were to Pushkin, Lermontov and Tolstoy. Archetypal in both lit- eratures is the theme of the hero who leaves behind the corrupt world of urban civilisation and enervating passions to affront the dangers and moral purgations of the frontier. â¦ The vastness of space brings with it exposures to natural forces at their most grandiose and ferocious â¦ all these encoun- ters of man with a physical setting which can destroy him in moments of wanton grandeur lie outside the repertoire of western European realism.49 Steiner suggests that Tolstoyâs How Much Land does a Man Need?, in which agreedy settler discovers that the answer is enough to bury him, could have beenthe nineteenth-century creation of only a Russian or an American. While thescale of Melvilleâs Moby Dick has made it seem a very Russian novel to somereaders, they might also find in Mark Twainâs Huckleberry Finn that the Mississippiattains the universal, eternal quality that Russians have always attributed to theVolga. Moreover, Tolstoyâs favourite book, at one period in his life at least, wasThoreauâs celebration of the natural life, Walden. A final point of departure for discussion could have been Ernest Hemingwayâscelebrated remark that âAll modern American literature comes from one book byMark Twain called Huckleberry Finnâ, and Dostoevskyâs, that all subsequent Russianliterature emerged out of Gogolâs The Overcoat. The magnitude and influence ofboth these works are undeniable, but, arguably, additional implications of theabove remarks are that Hemingwayâs urge away from civilisation and back tonature was most clearly foreshadowed by Mark Twain, and Dostoevskyâs StPetersburg twilight world, peopled with monomaniac outsiders, by Gogol. Betterperhaps, however, to finish on the mundane observation that art reflects as well asinspires, and that, besides frontier and size, American and Russian society werethe most formative influences on the literature of the two great nations becomingempires. An analysis of their social systems, of their concepts of world mission,would be of close relevance to a consideration of their novels. The assistancecould be mutual, of course, for the epic quality to be found in the history of thesuperpowers often approaches, sometimes surpasses, that of their art. How couldany novel do justice to the saga of the emergence of America and Russia as greatpowers in the centuries before 1898?\n\nP:40\n\nInheritance 29 But our conclusion cannot be completed without a return from fiction toâfactâ, or at least to philosophy. W.J. Gavin and T.J. Blakeley observed in 1976 thatin the nineteenth century the âAmerican and Russian contexts were radicallyuncertain or mysteriousâ and in some way ârealisedâ that âthis indeterminacy wasessentialâ. Gavin and Blakeley conclude: Although some specific questions could be answered, nonetheless the cultural context should always be seen as fundamentally mysterious. It is ironic that only in an uncertain world can one function as a human being. In this case, however, the irony rings true. Perhaps William James said more than even he realized when, at the close of the nineteenth century, he asked for âthe re- instatement of the vague to its proper place in our mental lifeâ.50 However much historians might agree with their philosopher colleagues, theyare also bound to recognise that âthe vagueâ is not an easy concept for them tohandle. Equally, agreeing with Gavin and Blakeley that the human being is perhapsbest defined as a âquestioning animalâ, I accept the professional necessity to atleast suggest some of the answers. Furthermore, while accepting their parallelbetween William James and Alexander Herzen, I repeat the observation of theRussian that the relationship between their two countries is best viewed asrepresenting âtwo solutions which are opposite but incompleteâ, with acomplementary contradiction âwhich is full of life and development, which isopen-ended, without finality, without physiological discordâ. Having attempted toset out the manner in which the future superpowers had developed before 1898, Ishall now turn to the manner in which their relationship took a turn for theworse in the following century.\n\nP:41\n\n2 Conception The FirstWorldWar and revolution, 1898â1921Imperial showdown (1898â1914)Having considered the structure of the inheritance, we turn to the greatconjuncture of conception. Certainly, we should not carry our basic metaphor toofar, and we would not extract much enlightenment from speculating aboutparentage, even though serious scholars have discussed the femininity of Russiaand the masculinity of the USA.1 In any case, in Chapter 1 we have given aconsiderable amount of attention to the manner in which Europe made acontribution to the political, economic and cultural development of both the USAand Russia. And so, we would be better off noting simply that it was during theperiod 1898â1921 that the ideological foundations of superpower, Wilsonism andLeninism, were laid against a background of war and revolution. Beginning this chapter in the year 1898, we may appropriately take a briefpreliminary glance at chronometry itself. A conference in Washington in 1884proposed that Greenwich time should be adopted as a standard for the world.Many European countries as well as the USA soon accepted this proposal, butFrance held out until 1911, while Russia continued to adhere to a norm providedby the Pulkovo observatory just south of St Petersburg. This was just over twohours ahead of Greenwich, while, in measurement of days, according to theOrthodox calendar, Russia remained thirteen days behind the West into the earlytwentieth century; a reflection also of a many-sided backwardness. One of thewell-known supporters of the idea of standard time was the German FieldMarshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, who just before his death in 1891, pleadedwith the German Reichstag to adopt it for military reasons. Germanyâs fivedifferent time zones complicated planning, which the further changes to be metat the French and Russian frontiers made increasingly difficult. Germany dulyaccepted the great change in 1893, and Europe as a whole sufficiently co-ordinated its chronology and its means of communication for the âwar bytimetableâ to go ahead by telegraph and telephone as well as train in 1914.2 Back in 1898, the light of peace as well as the shadow of war could be de-tected among the still expanding world empires. On 24 August, Russia\n\nP:42\n\nConception 31distributed a note suggesting an international conference to relieve worldtensions. If armaments continued to grow, there would sooner or later ensue âacataclysm too horrible for the human mind to contemplateâ. But Germany soondeclared âno intention of binding herself in the question of military armamentsâ,while the great powers in general could not avoid noting that Russia had justinfringed an earlier agreement with China by seizing Port Arthur, and so theythemselves made no immediate arrangements to curb their own ambitions. Eventhe USA, which also talked of higher principles, could not resist the lure of self-aggrandisement during the war against Spain. In 1899, the first Hague PeaceConference managed to establish a permanent court of arbitration and to adopttwo conventions relating to the rules of war, but the century turned "
