W.; Nobrega, L. E.\n\nVacuum thin windows have been used in Fermilab's accelerators for decades and typically have been overlooked in terms of their criticality and fragility. Vacuum windows allow beam to pass through while creating a boundary between vacuum and air or high vacuum and low vacuum areas. The design of vacuum windows, including Titanium and Beryllium windows, will be discussed as well as fabrication, testing, and operational concerns. Failure of windows will be reviewed as well as safety approaches to mitigating failures and extending the lifetimes of vacuum windows. Various methods of calculating the strengths of vacuum windows will be explored, includingmoreÂ Â» FEA.Â«Â less\n\nLaser-induced damage and fracture in fused silica vacuum windows\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampbell, John H.; Hurst, Patricia A.; Heggins, Dwight D.; Steele, William A.; Bumpas, Stanley E.\n\n1997-05-01\n\nLaser induced damage, that initiates catastrophic fracture, has been observed in large, fused silica lenses that also serve as vacuum barriers in high-fluence positions on the Nova and Beamlet lasers. In nearly all cases damage occurs on the vacuum side of the lens. The damage can lead to catastrophic crack growth if the flaw size exceeds the critical flaw size for SiO2. If the elastic stored energy in the lens in high enough, the lens will fracture into many pieces resulting in an implosion. The consequences of such an implosion can be severe, particularly for large vacuum systems. Three parameters control the degree of fracture in the vacuum barrier window: (1) the elastic stored energy, (2) the ratio of the window thickness to flaw depth and (3) secondary crack propagation. Fracture experiments have ben carried our on 15-cm diameter fused silica windows that contain surface flaws caused by laser damage. The results of these experiments, combined with data from window failures on Beamlet and Nova have been sued to develop design criteria for a 'fail-safe' lens. Specifically the window must be made thick enough such that the peak tensile stress is less than 500 psi and the corresponding ratio of the thickness to critical flaw size is less than 6. Under these conditions a properly mounted window, upon failure, will break into only tow pieces and will not implode. One caveat to these design criteria is that the air leak through the window before secondary crack growth occurs. Finite element stress calculations of a window before and immediately following fracture into two pieces show that the elastic stored energy is redistributed if the fragments 'lock' in place and thereby bridge the opening. In such cases, the peak stresses at the flaw site can increase leading to further crack growth.\n\nWaveguide transition with vacuum window for multiband dynamic nuclear polarization systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRybalko, Oleksandr; Bowen, Sean; Zhurbenko, Vitaliy\n\n2016-05-15\n\nA low loss waveguide transition section and oversized microwave vacuum window covering several frequency bands (94 GHz, 140 GHz, 188 GHz) is presented. The transition is compact and was optimized for multiband Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) systems in a full-wave simulator. The window is more broadband than commercially available windows, which are usually optimized for single band operation. It is demonstrated that high-density polyethylene with urethane adhesive can be used as a low loss microwave vacuum window in multiband DNP systems. The overall assembly performance and dimensions are found using full-wave simulations. The practical aspects of the window implementation inmoreÂ Â» the waveguide are discussed. To verify the design and simulation results, the window is tested experimentally at the three frequencies of interest.Â«Â less\n\nSafety shield for vacuum/pressure-chamber windows\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShimansky, R.

There had been frequent window failures in the past which affected the machine productivity and increased the radiation dose received by workers due to unplanned maintenance. To improve the window life, design of Be window is reexamined. Detailed structural and thermal simulations are carried out on Be window for different design parameters and loading conditions to come up with better design to improve the window life. The new designmoreÂ Â» removed the air gap and connect the both beam lines with a Be window in-between. The new design has multiple advantages such as 1) reduces the beam energy loss (because of one window with no air gap), 2) reduces air activation due to nuclear radiation and 3) increased the machine reliability as there is no direct pressure load during operation. For quick replacement of this window, an aluminum bellow coupled with load binder was designed. There hasnât been a single window failure since the new design was implemented in 2012.Â«Â less\n\nWindow-assisted nanosphere lithography for vacuum micro-nano-electronics\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLi, Nannan; Institute of Electronic Engineering, Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, 621900; Pang, Shucai\n\n2015-04-15\n\nDevelopment of vacuum micro-nano-electronics is quite important for combining the advantages of vacuum tubes and solid-state devices but limited by the prevailing fabricating techniques which are expensive, time consuming and low-throughput. In this work, window-assisted nanosphere lithography (NSL) technique was proposed and enabled the low-cost and high-efficiency fabrication of nanostructures for vacuum micro-nano-electronic devices, thus allowing potential applications in many areas. As a demonstration, we fabricated high-density field emitter arrays which can be used as cold cathodes in vacuum micro-nano-electronic devices by using the window-assisted NSL technique. The details of the fabricating process have been investigated. This work provided amoreÂ Â» new and feasible idea for fabricating nanostructure arrays for vacuum micro-nano-electronic devices, which would spawn the development of vacuum micro-nano-electronics.Â«Â less\n\nUltra high vacuum broad band high power microwave window\n\nDOEpatents\n\nNguyen-Tuong, V.; Dylla, H.F. III\n\n1997-11-04\n\nAn improved high vacuum microwave window has been developed that utilizes high density polyethylene coated on two sides with SiOx, SiNx, or a combination of the two. The resultant low dielectric and low loss tangent window creates a low outgassing, low permeation seal through which broad band, high power microwave energy may be passed. No matching device is necessary and the sealing technique is simple. The features of the window are broad band transmission, ultra-high vacuum compatibility with a simple sealing technique, low voltage standing wave ratio, high power transmission and low cost. 5 figs.\n\nUltra high vacuum broad band high power microwave window\n\nDOEpatents\n\nNguyen-Tuong, Viet; Dylla, III, Henry Frederick\n\n1997-01-01\n\nAn improved high vacuum microwave window has been developed that utilizes high density polyethylene coated on two sides with SiOx, SiNx, or a combination of the two.

From a purely scattering physics perspective, it is not necessary to place the specimen inside the vacuum chamber-the mean free paths (MFPs) for electron scattering in air at typical SEM beam voltages are 50-100 Î¼m. This is the idea behind the airSEM, which removes the specimen vacuum chamber from the SEM and places the sample in air. The thickness of the gas layer is less than a MFP from an electron-transparent window to preserve the shape and resolution of the incident beam, resulting in comparable imaging quality to an all-vacuum SEM. Present silicon nitride windows scatter far more strongly than the air gap and are currently the contrast and resolution limiting factor in the airSEM. Graphene windows have been used previously to wrap or seal samples in vacuum for imaging. Here we demonstrate the use of a robust bilayer graphene window for sealing the electron optics from the room environment, providing an electron transparent window with only a 2% drop in contrast. There is a 5-fold-increase in signal/noise ratio for imaging compared to multi-MFP-thick silicon nitride windows, enabling high contrast in backscattered, transmission, and surface imaging modes for the new airSEM geometry.\n\nHigh Reliability R-10 Windows Using Vacuum Insulating Glass Units\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStark, David\n\n2012-08-16\n\nThe objective of this effort was for EverSealed Windows (âEverSealedâ or âESWâ) to design, assemble, thermally and environmentally test and demonstrate a Vacuum Insulating Glass Unit (âVIGUâ or âVIGâ) that would enable a whole window to meet or exceed the an R-10 insulating value (U-factor â¤ 0.1). To produce a VIGU that could withstand any North American environment, ESW believed it needed to design, produce and use a flexible edge seal system. This is because a rigid edge seal, used by all other know VIG producers and developers, limits the size and/or thermal environment of the VIG to where themoreÂ Â» unit is not practical for typical IG sizes and cannot withstand severe outdoor environments. The rigid-sealed VIGâs use would be limited to mild climates where it would not have a reasonable economic payback when compared to traditional double-pane or triple-pane IGs. ESWâs goals, in addition to achieving a sufficiently high R-value to enable a whole window to achieve R-10, included creating a VIG design that could be produced for a cost equal to or lower than a traditional triple-pane IG (low-e, argon filled). ESW achieved these goals. EverSealed produced, tested and demonstrated a flexible edge-seal VIG that had an R-13 insulating value and the edge-seal system durability to operate reliably for at least 40 years in the harshest climates of North America.Â«Â less\n\nHigh-Reliability Waveguide Vacuum/Pressure Window\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBritcliffe, Michael J.; Hanson, Theodore R.; Long, Ezra M.; Montanez, Steven\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) uses commercial waveguide windows on the output waveguide of Ka-band (32 GHz) low-noise amplifiers. Mechanical failure of these windows resulted in an unacceptable loss in tracking time. To address this issue, a new Ka-band WR-28 waveguide window has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The window uses a slab of low-loss, low-dielectric constant foam that is bonded into a 1/2-wave-thick waveguide/flange. The foam is a commercially available, rigid, closed-cell polymethacrylimide. It has excellent electrical properties with a dielectric constant of 1.04, and a loss tangent of 0.01. It is relatively strong with a tensile strength of 1 MPa. The material is virtually impermeable to helium. The finished window exhibits a leak rate of less than 3x10(exp -3)cu cm/s with helium. The material is also chemically resistant and can be cleaned with acetone. The window is constructed by fabricating a window body by brazing a short length of WR-28 copper waveguide into a standard rectangular flange, and machining the resulting part to a thickness of 4.6 mm. The foam is machined to a rectangular shape with a dimension of 7.06x3.53 mm. The foam is bonded into the body with a two-part epoxy. After curing, the excess glue and foam are knife-trimmed by hand. The finished window has a loss of less than 0.08 dB (2%) and a return loss of greater than 25 dB at 32 GHz. This meets the requirements for the DSN application. The window is usable for most applications over the entire 26-to-40-GHz waveguide band. The window return loss can be tuned to a required frequency by var y in g the thickness of the window slightly. Most standard waveguide windows use a thin membrane of material bonded into a recess in a waveguide flange, or sandwiched between two flanges with a polymer seal. Designs using the recessed window are prone to mechanical failure over time due to constraints on the dimensions of the recess that allow the bond to fail.

The primary goal of this study was to determine the threshold at which thermal-stress-induced damage occurs in these commonly used vacuum barriers. An Nd:Yag pulsed laser with cylindrical optics and a carefully designed test cell provided a test environment that closely resembles the actual beamline conditions at SSRL. Tests performed on two beryllium window geometries, with different vertical aperture dimensions but equal foil thicknesses of 0.254 mm, resulted in two focused total-power thresholds at which incipient damage was determined. FormoreÂ Â» a beam spot size similar to that of the Beamline-X Wiggler Line, onset of surface damage for a 5-mm by 25-mm aperture window was observed at 170 W after 174,000 laser pulses (1.2-ms pulse at 100 pps). A second window with double the vertical aperture dimension (10 mm by 25 mm) was observed to have surface cracking after 180,000 laser pulses with 85 W impinging its front surface. It failed after approximately 1,000,000 pulses. Another window of the same type (10 mm by 25 mm) received 2,160,000 laser pulses at 74.4 W, and subsequent metallographic sectioning revealed no signs of through-thickness damage. Comparison of windows with equal foil thicknesses and aperture dimensions has effectively identified the heat flux limit for incipient failure. The data show that halving the aperture's vertical dimension allows doubling the total incident power for equivalent onsets of thermal-induced damage.Â«Â less\n\nDesign Considerations | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nArcjet exploratory tests of ARC optical window design for the AFE vehicle\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWhiting, Ellis E.; Terrazas-Salinas, Imelda; Craig, Roger A.; Sobeck, Charles K.; Sarver, George L., III; Salerno, Louis J.; Love, Wendell; Maa, Scott; Covington, AL\n\n1991-01-01\n\nTests were made in the 20 MW arc jet facility at the NASA ARC to determine the suitability of sapphire and fused silica as window materials for the Aeroassist Flight Experiment (AFE) entry vehicle. Twenty nine tests were made; 25 at a heating rate about 80 percent of that expected during the AFE entry and 4 at approximately the full, 100 percent AFE heating rate profile, that produces a temperature of about 2900 F on the surface of the tiles that protect the vehicle. These tests show that a conductively cooled window design using mechanical thermal contacts and sapphire is probably not practical. Cooling the window using mechanical thermal contacts produces thermal stresses in the sapphire that cause the window to crack. An insulated design using sapphire, that cools the window as little as possible, appears promising although some spectral data in the vacuum-ultra-violet (VUV) will be lost due to the high temperature reached by the sapphire. The surface of the insulated sapphire windows, tested at the 100 percent AFE heating rate, showed some slight ablation, and cracks appeared in two of three test windows. One small group of cracks were obviously caused by mechanical binding of the window in the assembly, which can be eliminated with improved design. Other cracks were long, straight, thin crystallographic cracks that have very little effect on the optical transmission of the window. Also, the windows did not fall apart along these crystallographic cracks when the windows were removed from their assemblies. Theoretical results from the thermal analysis computer program SINDA indicate that increasing the window thickness from 4 to 8 mm may enable surface ablation to be avoided. An insulated design using a fused silica window tested at the nominal AFE heating rate experienced severe ablation, thus fused silica is not considered to be an acceptable window material.\n\nImpact of mechanical stress induced in silica vacuum windows on laser-induced damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nGingreau, ClÃ©mence; Lanternier, Thomas; LamaignÃ¨re, Laurent; Donval, Thierry; Courchinoux, Roger; Leymarie, Christophe; NÃ©auport, JÃ©rÃ´me\n\n2018-04-15\n\nAt the interface between vacuum and air, optical windows must keep their optical properties, despite being subjected to mechanical stress. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of such stress on the laser-induced damage of fused silica windows at the wavelength of 351Â nm in the nanosecond regime. Different stress values, from 1 to 30Â MPa, both tensile and compressive, were applied. No effect of the stress on the laser-induced damage was evidenced.\n\nThin CVD-diamond RF Pill-Box vacuum windows for LHCD systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRavera, G.

A.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe preliminary assessment of a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system for the DEMOnstration power plant (DEMO) is mainly focused on the R&D needs of the less conventional RF components of the Main Transmission Line (MTL) and of the launcher. 500 kW, CW klystrons will be used to deliver the RF power to independent Passive Active Multijunction (PAM) launcher modules at 5 GHz. This paper describes the criteria followed to investigate the optimum solution for the RF window used as vacuum barrier between the MTL and the launcher, an open issue in the LHCD system for ITER too. The best candidate, capable of withstanding a power level of, or above, 0.5 MW in CW operation and to satisfy the electrical and thermonuclear requirements, is a Pill-Box assembly, based on a thin single disk of CVD-diamond as dielectric, water cooled at the edge. A thickness of 3 mm, much shorter than half a wavelength of the TEÂ°11 mode in the dielectric as in the conventional window (unfeasible and too expensive with CVD-diamond at these frequencies), is sufficient to limit the exerted stress at the edge under the fracture stress for a maximum pressure applied of 0.9 MPa. In this paper the simulation results of conventional and thin CVD-diamond vacuum windows are presented comparing S-parameters, losses and electric fields in both matching condition and with VSWR = 2, using WR284 and WR229 as input/output rectangular waveguide.\n\nVacuum system for the SAMURAI spectrometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShimizu, Y.; Otsu, H.; Kobayashi, T.; Kubo, T.; Motobayashi, T.; Sato, H.; Yoneda, K.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe first commissioning experiment of the SAMURAI spectrometer and its beam line was performed in March, 2012.

The window for neutrons was made of stainless steel with a thickness of 3 mm and was designed with a shape of partial cylinder to support itself against the atmospheric pressure. The window for charged particles was of the combination of Kevlar and Mylar with the thickness of 280 and 75 Î¼m, respectively.

The residual RF energy has to be terminated into an RF load. Higher accelerating gradients require higher RF sources and RF loads, which can stably terminate the residual RF power. RF feeders (from the RF source though the accelerating section to the load) are vacuumed to transmit multi-megawatt high power RF. This overview will outline vacuumed RF loads only. A common method to terminate multi-MW RF power is tomoreÂ Â» use circulated water (or other liquid) as an absorbing medium. A solid dielectric interface (a high quality ceramic) is required to separate vacuum and liquid RF absorber mediums. Using such RF load approaches in TW linacs is troubling because there is a fragile ceramic window barrier and a failure could become catastrophic for linac vacuum and RF systems. Traditional loads comprising of a ceramic disk have limited peak and average power handling capability and are therefore not suitable for high gradient TW linacs. This overview will focus on ''vacuum dry'' or ''all-metal'' loads that do not employ any dielectric interface between vacuum and absorber. The first prototype is an original design of RF loads for the Stanford Two-Mile Accelerator.Â«Â less\n\nNote: reliable and reusable ultrahigh vacuum optical viewports.\n\nPubMed\n\nArora, P; Sen Gupta, A\n\n2012-04-01\n\nWe report a simple technique for the realization of ultrahigh vacuum optical viewports. The technique relies on using specially designed thin copper knife-edges and using a thin layer of Vacseal(Â®) on tip of the knife-edges between the optical flat and the ConFlat(Â®) (CF) flange. The design of the windows is such that it gives uniform pressure on the flat without breaking it. The assembled window is a complete unit, which can be mounted directly onto a CF flange of the vacuum chamber. It can be removed and reused without breaking the window seal. The design is reliable as more than a dozen such windows have survived several bake out and cooling cycles and have been leak tested up to 10(-11) Torr l/s level with a commercial Helium leak detector. The advantages of this technique are ease of assembly and leak proof sealing that survives multiple temperature cycling making the windows reliable and reusable.

Y.; Franzi, M.\n\n2009-09-01\n\nExperiments have been performed on the UM/L-3 (6-vane, L-band) relativistic magnetron to test a new microwave window configuration designed to limit vacuum side breakdown. In the baseline case, acrylic microwave windows were mounted between three of the waveguide coupling cavities in the anode block vacuum housing and the output waveguides. Each of the six 3 cm deep coupling cavities is separated from its corresponding anode cavity by a 1.75 cm wide aperture. In the baseline case, vacuum side window breakdown was observed to initiate at single waveguide output powers close to 20 MW. In the new window configuration, three Air Force Research Laboratory-designed, vacuum-rated directional coupler waveguide segments were mounted between the coupling cavities and the microwave windows. The inclusion of the vacuum side power couplers moved the microwave windows an additional 30 cm away from the anode apertures. Additionally, the Lucite microwave windows were replaced with polycarbonate windows and the microwave window mounts were redesigned to better maintain waveguide continuity in the region around the microwave windows. No vacuum side window breakdown was observed in the new window configuration at single waveguide output powers of 120+MW (a factor of 3 increase in measured microwave pulse duration and factor of 3 increase in measured peak power over the baseline case). Simulations were performed to investigate likely causes for the window breakdown in the original configuration. Results from these simulations have shown that in the original configuration, at typical operating voltage and magnetic field ranges, electrons emitted from the anode block microwave apertures strike the windows with a mean kinetic energy of 33 keV with a standard deviation of 14 keV. Calculations performed using electron impact angle and energy data predict a first generation secondary electron yield of 65% of the primary electron population.

The window structure also comprises a series of support ribs running the width of the window. The windows are typically made of boron-doped silicon and silicon nitride and are useful in instruments such as electron beam guns and x-ray detectors. In an electron beam gun, the window does not impede the electrons and has demonstrated outstanding gun performance and survivability during the gun tube manufacturing process.\n\nManufacturing of diamond windows for synchrotron radiation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchildkamp, W.; Nikitina, L.\n\n2012-09-15\n\nA new diamond window construction is presented and explicit manufacturing details are given. This window will increase the power dissipation by about a factor of 4 over present day state of the art windows to absorb 600 W of power. This power will be generated by in-vacuum undulators with the storage ring ALBA operating at a design current of 400 mA. Extensive finite element (FE) calculations are included to predict the windows behavior accompanied by explanations for the chosen boundary conditions. A simple linear model was used to cross-check the FE calculations.\n\nError-Based Design Space Windowing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPapila, Melih; Papila, Nilay U.; Shyy, Wei; Haftka, Raphael T.; Fitz-Coy, Norman\n\n2002-01-01\n\nWindowing of design space is considered in order to reduce the bias errors due to low-order polynomial response surfaces (RS). Standard design space windowing (DSW) uses a region of interest by setting a requirement on response level and checks it by a global RS predictions over the design space. This approach, however, is vulnerable since RS modeling errors may lead to the wrong region to zoom on. The approach is modified by introducing an eigenvalue error measure based on point-to-point mean squared error criterion. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the benefit of the error-based DSW.\n\nVacuum-barrier window for wide-bandwidth high-power microwave transmission\n\nDOEpatents\n\nCaplan, Malcolm; Shang, Clifford C.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA vacuum output window comprises a planar dielectric material with identical systems of parallel ridges and valleys formed in opposite surfaces.

To achieve UHV, the new chamber is equipped with a differential ion pump, NEG pump, nude ion gauge, residual gas analyzer, and an all metal roughing valve. Temperature of the magnet assembly is maintained below 90 C during vacuum bake. The large rectangular port cover is sealed to the main flange of the chamber using a one-piece flat aluminummoreÂ Â» gasket and special sealing surfaces developed exclusively by Nor-Cal Products, Inc. The large flange provides easy access to the gap of the installed magnet girders for in situ magnetic measurements and shimming. Special window ports were designed into the cover and chamber for manipulation of optical micrometers external to the chamber to provide precise measurements of the in-vacuum magnet gap. The vacuum chamber assembly features independently vacuum-isolated feedthroughs that can be used for either water-or-cryogenic refrigeration-cooling of the monolithic magnet girders. This would allow for cryogenic-cooled permanent magnet operation and has been successfully tested within temperature range of +100 C to -150 C. Details of the undulator assembly for beamline X-25 is described in the paper.Â«Â less\n\nVacuum-barrier window for wide-bandwidth high-power microwave transmission\n\nDOEpatents\n\nCaplan, M.; Shang, C.C.\n\n1996-08-20\n\nA vacuum output window comprises a planar dielectric material with identical systems of parallel ridges and valleys formed in opposite surfaces.

It specifies the need for such a measurement; the types and requirements for the needed instruments; the Radiative Heating Experiment (RHE) developed for the AFE; the requirements, design parameters, and performance of the window developed for the RHE; the procedures and summary of the technique; and results of the arc-jet wind tunnel experiment conducted to demonstrate the overall concept. Subjects emphasized are the commercial implications of the knowledge to be gained by this experiment in connection with the Aeroassisted Space Transfer Vehicle (ASTV), the nonequilibrium nature of the radiation, concerns over the contribution of vacuum-ultraviolet radiation to the overall radiation, and the limit on the flight environment of the vehicle imposed by the limitations on the window material. Results show that a technique exists with which the stagnation-point radiation can be measured in flight in an environment of interest to commercial ASTV applications.\n\nTwo-Band, Low-Loss Microwave Window\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBritcliffe, Michael; Franco, Manuel\n\n2007-01-01\n\nA window for a high-sensitivity microwave receiving system allows microwave radiation to pass through to a cryogenically cooled microwave feed system in a vacuum chamber, while keeping ambient air out of the chamber and helping to keep the interior of the chamber cold. The microwave feed system comprises a feed horn and a low-noise amplifier, both of which are required to be cooled to a temperature of 15 K during operation. The window is designed to exhibit very little microwave attenuation in two frequency bands: 8 to 9 GHz and 30 to 40 GHz. The window is 15 cm in diameter. It includes three layers (see figure): 1) The outer layer is made of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film 0.025 mm thick. This layer serves primarily to reflect and absorb solar ultraviolet radiation to prolong the life of the underlying main window layer, which is made of a polyimide that becomes weakened when exposed to ultraviolet. The poly(tetrafluoroethylene) layer also protects the main window layer against abrasion. Moreover, the inherent hydrophobicity of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) helps to prevent the highly undesirable accumulation of water on the outer surface. 2) The polyimide main window layer is 0.08 mm thick. This layer provides the vacuum seal for the window. 3) A 20-mm-thick layer of ethylene/ propylene copolymer foam underlies the main polyimide window layer. This foam layer acts partly as a thermal insulator: it limits radiational heating of the microwave feed horn and, concomitantly, limits radiational cooling of the window. This layer has high compressive strength and provides some mechanical support for the main window layer, reducing the strength required of the main window layer. The ethylene/propylene copolymer foam layer is attached to an aluminum window ring by means of epoxy. The outer poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film and the main polyimide window layer are sandwiched together and pressed against the window ring by use of a bolted clamp ring. The window has been found to\n\nThin-window high-efficiency position sensitive proportional counter for the vacuum flat crystal spectrometers on the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory electron beam ion trap (abstract)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBrown, G. V.; Beiersdorfer, P.; Goddard, R.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nWe have mounted 1 {mu}m thick aluminized polyimide windows onto the position sensitive proportional counters employed by the wide-band flat crystal spectrometers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory electron beam ion trap experiment. The aluminized polyimide, supported by thin wires across the short axis of the window, is used to isolate the detection chamber of the proportional counters, which operate at a pressure of 760 Torr, from the vacuum chamber of the spectrometer. The windows are modified versions of those developed for the proportional counters which were used during ground calibration of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The transmission properties ofmoreÂ Â» these windows are, therefore, well known. The increased transmission efficiency of the polyimide windows relative to the 4 {mu}m thick polypropylene window material previously employed by our proportional counters has extended the useful range of the spectrometer from roughly 20 to 30 Aa at energies below the carbon edge, as well as increasing detection efficiency at wavelengths beyond the carbon edge. Using an octadecyl hydrogen maleate crystal with 2d=63.5Aa, we demonstrate the increased wavelength coverage by measuring the resonance, intercombination, and forbidden lines in helium-like NVII in two different density regimes. The thin polyimide windows have also increased the efficiency of the spectrometers entire wavelength range. To demonstrate the increased efficiency we compare the FeXVII spectrum in the 15--17 Aa band measured with the 1 {mu}m aluminized polyimide windows to the 4 {mu}m aluminized polypropylene windows. The comparison shows an average increase in efficiency of {approx}40%. The polyimide windows have a significantly lower leak rate than the polypropylene windows making it possible to achieve approximately an order of magnitude lower pressure in the spectrometer vacuum chamber which reduces the gas load on the trap region.Â«Â less\n\nUnderstanding Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nA Plasma Window for Transmission of Radiation and Particle Beams from Vacuum to Atmosphere for Various Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHershcovitch, Ady\n\n1997-11-01\n\nexperimental results, with a plasma window coupled to a venturi, show a factor of three further enhancement in vacuum-atmosphere separation.\n\nDesign of the ZTH vacuum liner\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPrince, P.P.; Dike, R.S.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe current status of the ZTH vacuum liner design is covered by this report. ZTH will be the first experiment to be installed in the CPRF (Confinement Physics Research Facility) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and is scheduled to be operational at the rated current of 4 MA in 1992. The vacuum vessel has a 2.4 m major radius and a 40 cm minor radius. Operating parameters which drive the vacuum vessel mechanical design include a 300 C bakeout temperature, an armour support system capable of withstanding 25 kV, a high toroidal resistance, 1250 kPa magnetic loading, a 10moreÂ Â» minute cycle time, and high positional accuracy with respect to the conducting shell. The vacuum vessel design features which satisfy the operating parameters are defined. The liner is constructed of Inconel 625 and has a geometry which alternates sections of thin walled bellows with rigid ribs. These composite sections span between pairs of the 16 diagnostic stations to complete the torus. The thin bellows sections maximize the liner toroidal resistance and the ribs provide support and positional accuracy for the armour in relation to the conducting shell. Heat transfer from the vessel is controlled by a blanket wrap of ceramic fiber insulation and the heat flux is dissipated to a water cooling jacket in the conducting shell.Â«Â less\n\nDesigning intuitive dialog boxes in Windows environments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSouetova, Natalia\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThere were analyzed some approaches to user interface design.

It is shown how fixed points, scaling exponents, and anomalous dimensions are obtained as a systematic power series in a small parameter. The underlying ordering principle is explained and contrasted with conventional perturbation theory and Weyl consistency conditions. We then determine the conformal window with asymptotic safety from the complete next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory. Limits for the conformal window arise due to fixed point mergers, the onset of strong coupling, or vacuum instability. A consistent picture is uncovered by comparing various levels of approximation. The theory remains perturbative in the entire conformal window, with vacuum stability dictating the tightest constraints. We also speculate about a secondary conformal window at strong coupling and estimate its lower limit. Implications for model building and cosmology are indicated.\n\nSpace station proximity operations windows: Human factors design guidelines\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHaines, Richard F.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nProximity operations refers to all activities outside the Space Station which take place within a 1-km radius. Since there will be a large number of different operations involving manned and unmanned vehicles, single- and multiperson crews, automated and manually controlled flight, a wide variety of cargo, and construction/repair activities, accurate and continuous human monitoring of these operations from a specially designed control station on Space Station will be required. Total situational awareness will be required. This paper presents numerous human factors design guidelines and related background information for control windows which will support proximity operations.

It is necessary to develop a high-power laser system which can operate over long periods of time without appreciable degradation in performance. When a high-energy laser beam transmits through a laser window, it is possible that the permanent damage is caused to the window because of the energy absorption by window materials. So, when we design a high-power laser system, a suitable laser window material must be selected and the laser damage threshold of the window must be known. In this paper, a thermal analysis model of high-power laser window is established, and the relationship between the laser intensity and the thermal-stress field distribution is studied by deducing the formulas through utilizing the integral-transform method. The influence of window radius, thickness and laser intensity on the temperature and stress field distributions is analyzed. Then, the performance of K9 glass and the fused silica glass is compared, and the laser-induced damage mechanism is analyzed. Finally, the damage thresholds of laser windows are calculated. The results show that compared with K9 glass, the fused silica glass has a higher damage threshold due to its good thermodynamic properties. The presented theoretical analysis and simulation results are helpful for the design and selection of high-power laser windows.\n\nREQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES FOR NSLS EXPERIMENTAL BEAM LINE VACUUM SYSTEMS-REVISION B.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFOERSTER,C.\n\nTypical beam lines are comprised of an assembly of vacuum valves and shutters referred to as a ''front end'', optical elements to monochromatize, focus and split the photon beam, and an experimental area where a target sample is placed into the photon beam and data from the interaction is detected and recorded. Windows are used to separate sections of beam lines that are not compatible with storage ring ultra high vacuum. Some experimental beam lines share a common vacuum with storage rings. Sections of beam lines are only allowed to vent up to atmospheric pressure using pure nitrogen gas aftermoreÂ Â» a vacuum barrier is established to protect ring vacuum. The front end may only be bled up when there is no current in the machine. This is especially true on the VUV storage ring where for most experiments, windows are not used. For the shorter wavelength, more energetic photons of the x-ray ring, beryllium windows are used at various beam line locations so that the monochromator, mirror box or sample chamber may be used in a helium atmosphere or rough vacuum. The window separates ring vacuum from the environment of the downstream beam line components. The stored beam lifetime in the storage rings and the maintenance of desirable reflection properties of optical surfaces depend upon hydrocarbon-free, ultra-high vacuum systems. Storage ring vacuum systems will operate at pressures of {approximately} 1 x 10{sup {minus}10} Torr without beam and {approximately} 1 x 10{sup {minus}9} Torr with beam. Systems are free of hydrocarbons in the sense that no pumps, valves, etc. containing organics are used. Components are all-metal, chemically cleaned and bakeable. To the extent that beam lines share a common vacuum with the storage ring, the same criteria will hold for beam line components. The design philosophy for NSLS beam lines is to use all-metal, hydrocarbon-free front end components and recommend that experimenters use this approach for common vacuum hardware downstream\n\nOpto-mechanical design of optical window for aero-optics effect simulation instruments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Guo-ming; Dong, Dengfeng; Zhou, Weihu; Ming, Xing; Zhang, Yan\n\n2016-10-01\n\nA complete theory is established for opto-mechanical systems design of the window in this paper, which can make the design more rigorous .There are three steps about the design. First, the universal model of aerodynamic environment is established based on the theory of Computational Fluid Dynamics, and the pneumatic pressure distribution and temperature data of optical window surface is obtained when aircraft flies in 5-30km altitude, 0.5-3Ma speed and 0-30Â°angle of attack. The temperature and pressure distribution values for the maximum constraint is selected as the initial value of external conditions on the optical window surface. Then, the optical window and mechanical structure are designed, which is also divided into two parts: First, mechanical structure which meet requirements of the security and tightness is designed. Finally, rigorous analysis and evaluation are given about the structure of optics and mechanics we have designed. There are two parts to be analyzed. First, the Fluid-Solid-Heat Coupled Model is given based on finite element analysis. And the deformation of the glass and structure can be obtained by the model, which can assess the feasibility of the designed optical windows and ancillary structure; Second, the new optical surface is fitted by Zernike polynomials according to the deformation of the surface of the optical window, which can evaluate imaging quality impact of spectral camera by the deformation of window.\n\nMock Target Window OTR and IR Design and Testing\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWass, Alexander Joseph\n\nIn order to fully verify temperature measurements made on the target window using infrared (IR) optical non-contact methods, actual comparative measurements are made with a real beam distribution as the heat source using Argonne National Laboratoryâs (ANL) 35 MeV electron accelerator.

Through these research efforts, we hope to identify ways to improve suction, flow rate, and surface agitation characteristics of nozzles used in vacuum cleaner nozzles. We plan to apply an advanced visualization technology, known as Stereoscopic Imaging Velocimetry (SIV), to a Kirby G-4 vacuum cleaner. Resultant data will be analyzed with a high-speed digital motion analysis system. We also plan to evaluate alternative vacuum cleaner nozzle designs. The overall goal of this project is to quantify both velocity fields and particle trajectories throughout the vacuum cleaner nozzle to optimize its \"cleanability\"--its ability to disturb and remove embedded dirt and other particulates from carpeting or hard surfaces.

Advanced beam window solutions are needed that can withstand anticipated increases in beam power and intensity that will result in higher thermal shock on the window and increased oxidative erosion rates on the air-side caused by increased temperatures. Carbon-based windows, in particular, glassy carbon windows are of interest to minimize interaction with the beam. The attractive properties of glassy carbon are: 1. Low atomic number 2. Low thermal expansion 3. High strength and low Young's modulus 4. Low gas permeability andmoreÂ Â» low outgassing for ultrahigh vacuum use The one liability of glassy carbon is its low thermal conductivity, nominally 5 W/mK, which will exacerbate temperature rise, oxidation, and thermal shock concerns as beam powers increase. TA&T proposes the development of graphene reinforced glassy carbon (GRGC) composites to increase the thermal conductivity and address this Achilles heel of glassy carbon. Graphene as a reinforcing phase has shown the capability to increase the thermal conductivity of the matrix material by up to two orders of magnitude. For beam windows this would substantially increase heat spreading away from the beam zone of the window and improve thermal shock resistance, and reduce maximum temperature and air-side oxidation of the window. Increased thermal conductivity would also improve the effectiveness of edge-cooling schemes to minimize temperature increase. In the Phase I effort, graphene oxide (GO) particles were dispersed into glassy carbon precursor at different content levels and cast into solid shapes. The goal was to determine the effect of graphene concentration on the mechanical properties (flexure strength), and thermal (thermal conductivity). The Phase I results indicated that addition of graphene did have a significant effect on thermal conductivity; however the microstructural\n\nOpto-mechanical design of vacuum laser resonator for the OSQAR experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoÅ¡ek, Jan; MacÃºchovÃ¡, Karolina; NemcovÃ¡, Å Ã¡rka; Kunc, Å tÄpÃ¡n.; Å ulc, Miroslav\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper gives short overview of laser-based experiment OSQAR at CERN which is focused on search of axions and axion-like particles. The OSQAR experiment uses two experimental methods for axion search - measurement of the ultra-fine vacuum magnetic birefringence and a method based on the \"Light shining through the wall\" experiment. Because both experimental methods have reached its attainable limits of sensitivity we have focused on designing a vacuum laser resonator. The resonator will increase the number of convertible photons and their endurance time within the magnetic field. This paper presents an opto-mechanical design of a two component transportable vacuum laser resonator. Developed optical resonator mechanical design allows to be used as a 0.8 meter long prototype laser resonator for laboratory testing and after transportation and replacement of the mirrors it can be mounted on the LHC magnet in CERN to form a 20 meter long vacuum laser resonator.\n\nOptomechanical design of the vacuum compatible EXCEDE's mission testbed\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBendek, Eduardo A.; Belikov, Ruslan; Lozi, Julien; Schneider, Glenn; Thomas, Sandrine; Pluzhnik, Eugene; Lynch, Dana\n\n2014-08-01\n\nIn this paper we describe the opto-mechanical design, tolerance error budget an alignment strategies used to build the Starlight Suppression System (SSS) for the Exoplanetary Circumstellar Environments and Disk Explorer (EXCEDE) NASA's mission. EXCEDE is a highly efficient 0.7m space telescope concept designed to directly image and spatially resolve circumstellar disks with as little as 10 zodis of circumstellar dust, as well as large planets. The main focus of this work was the design of a vacuum compatible opto-mechanical system that allows remote alignment and operation of the main components of the EXCEDE. SSS, which are: a Phase Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) coronagraph to provide high throughput and high contrast at an inner working angle (IWA) equal to the diffraction limit (IWA = 1.2 l/D), a wavefront (WF) control system based on a Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System deformable mirror (MEMS DM), and low order wavefront sensor (LOWFS) for fine pointing and centering.

Installed at the outer surface of the International Space Station, it enables investigators to study the impact of the open space environment on biological and biochemical test samples. Two Expose missions have been completed so far, designated as Expose-E (Rabbow et al. 2012) and Expose-R (Rabbow et al. this issue). One of the space-unique environmental factors offered by Expose is full-spectrum, ultraviolet (UV)-rich electromagnetic radiation from the Sun. This paper describes and analyses how on Expose-R, access of the test samples to Solar radiation degraded during space exposure in an unpredicted way. Several windows in front of the Sun-exposed test samples acquired a brown shade, resulting in a reduced transparency in visible light, UV and vacuum UV (VUV). Post-flight investigations revealed the discolouration to be caused by a homogenous film of cross-linked organic polymers at the inside of the windows. The chemical signature varied per sample carrier. No such films were found on windows from sealed, pressurized compartments, or on windows that had been kept out of the Sun. This suggests that volatile compounds originating from the interior of the Expose facility were cross-linked and photo-fixed by Solar irradiation at the rear side of the windows. The origin of the volatiles was not fully identified; most probably there was a variety of sources involved including the biological test samples, adhesives, plastics and printed circuit boards. The outer surface of the windows (pointing into space) was chemically impacted as well, with a probable effect on the transparency in VUV. The reported analysis of the window contamination on Expose-R is expected to help the interpretation of the scientific results and offers possibilities to mitigate this problem on future missions - in particular Expose-R2, the direct successor of Expose-R.\n\nGas Fills | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nBooks & Publications | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nProvide Views | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nReducing Condensation | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nReduced Fading | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nEWC Membership | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nVisible Transmittance | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nEWC Members | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nFinancing & Incentives | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nDesigning for Virtual Windows in a Deep Space Habitat\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHowe, A. Scott; Howard, Robert L.; Moore, Nathan; Amoroso, Michael\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses configurations and test analogs toward the design of a virtual window capability in a Deep Space Habitat. Long-duration space missions will require crews to remain in the confines of a spacecraft for extended periods of time, with possible harmful effects if a crewmember cannot cope with the small habitable volume. Virtual windows expand perceived volume using a minimal amount of image projection equipment and computing resources, and allow a limited immersion in remote environments. Uses for the virtual window include: live or augmented reality views of the external environment; flight deck, piloting, observation, or other participation in remote missions through live transmission of cameras mounted to remote vehicles; pre-recorded background views of nature areas, seasonal occurrences, or cultural events; and pre-recorded events such as birthdays, anniversaries, and other meaningful events prepared by ground support and families of the crewmembers.\n\nLong-term High-Resolution Intravital Microscopy in the Lung with a Vacuum Stabilized Imaging Window\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRodriguez-Tirado, Carolina; Kitamura, Takanori; Kato, Yu; Pollard, Jeffery W.; Condeelis, John S.; Entenberg, David\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMetastasis to secondary sites such as the lung, liver and bone is a traumatic event with a mortality rate of approximately 90% 1. Of these sites, the lung is the most difficult to assess using intravital optical imaging due to its enclosed position within the body, delicate nature and vital role in sustaining proper physiology. While clinical modalities (positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT)) are capable of providing noninvasive images of this tissue, they lack the resolution necessary to visualize the earliest seeding events, with a single pixel consisting of nearly a thousand cells. Current models of metastatic lung seeding postulate that events just after a tumor cell's arrival are deterministic for survival and subsequent growth. This means that real-time intravital imaging tools with single cell resolution 2 are required in order to define the phenotypes of the seeding cells and test these models. While high resolution optical imaging of the lung has been performed using various ex vivo preparations, these experiments are typically single time-point assays and are susceptible to artifacts and possible erroneous conclusions due to the dramatically altered environment (temperature, profusion, cytokines, etc.) resulting from removal from the chest cavity and circulatory system 3. Recent work has shown that time-lapse intravital optical imaging of the intact lung is possible using a vacuum stabilized imaging window 2,4,5 however, typical imaging times have been limited to approximately 6 hr. Here we describe a protocol for performing long-term intravital time-lapse imaging of the lung utilizing such a window over a period of 12 hr. The time-lapse image sequences obtained using this method enable visualization and quantitation of cell-cell interactions, membrane dynamics and vascular perfusion in the lung. We further describe an image processing technique that gives an unprecedentedly clear view of the\n\nA thesis investigating the impact of energy related environmental factors on domestic window design\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcEvoy, Michael Edward\n\nIn recent years the extent of glazing in houses has been tightly controlled by the Building Regulations in order to save energy. In addition guidelines derived from passive solar principles prescribe the distribution of domestic windows between elevations according to their orientation. This thesis studies the impact of these energy-related environmental factors on domestic window design. The first of these investigations determined the degree to which limitations on the area and arrangement of windows are significant in terms of daylighting. The experiments measured the effect that passive solar requirements and detailed aspects of window design have on the quality of daylighting in houses. The volume of background ventilation required for domestic accommodation has recently been increased. As a result, in a well-sealed construction, heat loss due to background ventilation becomes a larger part of the total heat loss and larger air movements become a potential cause of draughts. The ventilation experiment sought to establish the impact of these more onerous requirements on comfort within rooms. The third experiment combines these factors and asks the question: Could windows be actively involved in overcoming some of these difficulties by being used to preheat ventilation air in order to diminish the extent of heat loss and to alleviate the problem of cold draughts? Also by designing the window to reclaim heat from the room might it be possible to offset the window's thermal inadequacy? Through analysis of responses to a questionnaire and the use of optimisation techniques, scenarios were suggested for the future modification of windows in relation to energy and health expectations. The conclusions form a commentary on recent and future revisions to the Building Regulations and determine whether or not the Regulations facilitate the environmental engineering of windows as an active component of a building's whole environmental system.\n\nWafer-Level Vacuum Packaging of Smart Sensors.\n\nPubMed\n\nHilton, Allan; Temple, Dorota S\n\n2016-10-31\n\nThe reach and impact of the Internet of Things will depend on the availability of low-cost, smart sensors-\"low cost\" for ubiquitous presence, and \"smart\" for connectivity and autonomy. By using wafer-level processes not only for the smart sensor fabrication and integration, but also for packaging, we can further greatly reduce the cost of sensor components and systems as well as further decrease their size and weight. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in the wafer-level vacuum packaging technology of smart sensors. We describe the processes needed to create the wafer-scale vacuum microchambers, focusing on approaches that involve metal seals and that are compatible with the thermal budget of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits. We review choices of seal materials and structures that are available to a device designer, and present techniques used for the fabrication of metal seals on device and window wafers. We also analyze the deposition and activation of thin film getters needed to maintain vacuum in the ultra-small chambers, and the wafer-to-wafer bonding processes that form the hermetic seal. We discuss inherent trade-offs and challenges of each seal material set and the corresponding bonding processes. Finally, we identify areas for further research that could help broaden implementations of the wafer-level vacuum packaging technology.\n\nWafer-Level Vacuum Packaging of Smart Sensors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHilton, Allan; Temple, Dorota S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe reach and impact of the Internet of Things will depend on the availability of low-cost, smart sensorsââlow costâ for ubiquitous presence, and âsmartâ for connectivity and autonomy.
