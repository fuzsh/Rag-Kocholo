Here are the words, wisdom, and beautiful histories and stories of Alaska Native peoples, from a variety of writers, artists, poets, scientists, historians, politicians, and educators. It has been a remarkable experience to work with such truly gifted individuals and to provide a voice for their important perspectives. I use the term “perspective” purposefully. Perspective is how something is portrayed from a particular point of view; in this case, it is an indigenous point of view. This volume is not primarily an anthropological study, a political history, or an art book (though it has all of these elements); it comprises an interdisciplinary collection of essays and other offerings from both Native and non-Native contributors that reflect the neocolonial experience of Alaska’s indigenous peoples. Current trends in colonial and postcolonial studies have not effectively addressed the complicated legacy of the colonial periods. The colonial period applies to the older pre-twentieth-century geopolitical climate of European and American government domination and expansion of their respective empires. Although we have passed through this period, American corporate forces continue to dominate the planet in terms of control of resources such as oil, as well as to support and suppress governments and movements that operate counter to their for-profit capitalist model—a model that does not acknowledge environment or culture as valued resources. In this context, Alaska finds itself in a neocolonial period in which corporate interests are protected at the expense of indigenous cultures, languages, and land. The writings in this volume are often “counter” stories or histories and relay new ideas and concepts that have not been included in most history books on Alaska. I grew up reading about the brave pioneers who came to Alaska or the early Russians who “discovered” my ancestral land. Most non-Native people do not realize what an affront this is—to read about the “discovery” of the place that is our home/heart/spirit and where my ancestors have lived and hunted since the end of the Pleistocene age, as if we have been somehow invisible all these tens of thousands of years. The history of Alaska is a complex one and cannot be encapsulated within a one-dimensional perspective. For example, the first essay in this volume is\n\nxiv Preface an Athabascan narrative by Katie and Fred John, who are Ahtna Athabascan. It was recorded by the linguist James Kari. The narrative is in Ahtna with an English translation and reveals how an indigenous community reacted in a particularly heated exchange with a group of Russians in the nineteenth century. It provides a unique glimpse of early indigenous reactions to outsiders. The second essay is an excerpt from a major tome by the Russian scholars Solovjova and Vovnyanko that addresses the Russian colonial era, showing the depth and complexity of this period. These first two essays illustrate the interactions between indigenous peoples and their early colonial experience and the impact those interactions had on the colonizers as well as the colonized. The history of Alaska is often told from the perspective of outsiders and those who view the resources of Alaska as amazing treasures to exploit. There are stories of eighteenth-century Russian fur hunters, of the brave miners who came to Alaska in the late nineteenth century to discover gold, of the companies that developed salmon canneries, and, in the twentieth century, of the oil companies that worked together to build the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, one of the engineering marvels of the twentieth century. These stories are often highlighted and even exalted, yet one must ask what was the impact on the indigenous people. It is imperative to present as many viewpoints as possible, especially about the historical discourse of the indigenous and European encounters. Most textbooks only provide one viewpoint, often muting the Native voice. Explorers, colonizers, and writers who have been captivated by the landscape, people, and extreme climate of Alaska have often romanticized its history. However, no one knows this land better than the indigenous people who have lived here. Globally, the indigenous voice has often been silenced by overarching colonial governments, and Alaska is no exception. Alaska is home to distinct cultural and ethnic groups that speak over twenty different languages. These include 225 federally recognized tribes.1 Pejorative terms such as “Eskimo,” “Aleut,” and even “Indian” tend to diminish the diversity of cultures and are simplistic and in most cases mistaken. Within the past twenty years the self-designative terms such as “Yup’ik,” “Yupiaq,” “Iñupiaq,” “Unangan,” and “Alutiiq/Sugpiaq” are becoming symbols of the change that has taken place as Native people correct the colonial naming process. Alaska is a vast subcontinent of North America and has over 33,000 miles of coastline, 440 million acres of land with numerous rivers, lakes, mountain ranges, and glaciers, and the tallest peak in North America (Denali). The indigenous people adapted to their environment in an equally diverse manner. The Russians “discovered” Alaska in the middle of the eighteenth century and\n\nPreface xv\n\nnamed it “Russian America.” They set up colonies immediately and began to establish fur companies that often enslaved local indigenous people to hunt the valuable sea otter and other fur-bearing animals. In 1867, under the Treaty of Session, the United States purchased Alaska for six million dollars. It was clear that the region had substantial natural resources, including fur, gold, silver, and salmon, and the new territorial government began to capitalize on the resource exploitation. In 1958–59 Alaska became the forty-ninth state in the Union, coinciding with the discovery of vast oil fields in the far Arctic coastal regions. This led to a huge land grab contest between the federal and the newly formed state government as they poised to lease the Arctic shelf for oil exploration and development. In response, young Native leadership began to question their rights to the land. In 1969, at the height of the land claims issue, William Hensley, who would go on to become a state representative, wrote a seminal paper, which is included in this volume. Oil leases and land selections came to a screeching halt as Native people organized, for the first time on the statewide level, and demanded that the U.S. Congress deal with their aboriginal claim to the land. This led to the landmark Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971, which extinguished aboriginal claim to the land for a settlement of forty-four million acres and nearly one billion dollars ($962.5 million). The complex stories and history of Alaska have often been seen only through one perspective, that of Europeans and Americans, lacking the depth of knowledge that indigenous people have about their homelands. For a long time, most writings about indigenous people or Alaska Native people have been primarily by nonindigenous or non-Native people, and although there are some impressive contributions in this arena, by definition they lack the ideas, voice, or perspective of the indigenous experience. This is beginning to change in academic discourse, primarily fueled by grassroots movements that began in the 1960s, including the Civil Rights movement, the American Indian Movement, and the influence of other “radical” organizations. This seminal period of awakening created new programs in universities and colleges; the introduction of American Indian studies, Alaska Native studies, Chicano studies, African American studies, and women’s studies resulted in new canons of intellectual thought and ideas. One of the very early Native scholars from this period, Vine Deloria Jr. (Lakota), is arguably the father of Native American Studies. His early works, Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto (1970) and God Is Red (1973), were refreshingly honest and almost brutally frank. Deloria effectively used his wit and humor to illustrate how Native people feel, and how their ideas, histories, and lives have been devalued throughout the colonial and neocolonial peri-\n\nxvi Preface ods. The titles of some of Deloria’s chapters (for example, “Anthropologists and Other Friends”) provide humorous commentary on how the Lakota felt when anthropologists arrived on their reservation to “study” them in order to write a dissertation or a book. Although Deloria expresses considerable sarcastic wit in his works, he also effectively communicates how it feels to be the “other.” The relationship between academia and indigenous communities globally has been somewhat strained by a past that includes theft of cultural patrimony and of skeletal remains, as well as an attitude of superiority and elitism. Archaeologists, anthropologists, and sociologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries created new definitions for indigenous peoples, using terms such as “hunter-gatherer” to define many indigenous groups without taking into account their wealth of scientific knowledge, math systems, linguistic diversity, and aesthetic traditions. The vestiges of the colonial past still remain in some measure, but new scholarship and new paradigms are painting a much more in-depth and realistic picture of indigenous societies. Scholars such as Oscar Kawagley, Claudette Engblom-Bradley, Beth Leonard, Deanna Kingston (all contributors to this volume) are providing new perspectives on Native math systems, geographic knowledge, and astronomy. Today, indigenous scholarship is becoming more global and sophisticated in its use of analytical tools; in some cases developing its own theoretical paradigms, and in other instances using theorists such as Freire, Bakhtin, Fanon, and others. For example, Anna Smith-Chiburis in her essay draws on Bakhtin and Freire as she examines Sherman Alexei’s film Smoke Signals. Erica Lord, another contributor, uses Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth as a foundation for her analysis of indigenous identity. Indigenous scholars such as Jennifer Denetdale (Diné), Oscar Kawagley (Yupiaq), and Andrea Smith (Cherokee) are augmenting the canon in the area of Native history, science, philosophy, and epistemologies.2 These are vital as indigenous people begin to reclaim their voices and to make a path for themselves in western settings such as universities. Oscar Angayqaq Kawagley’s work is also reflective of the new paradigm that reveals how indigenous science is expressed in the Yupiaq world. It is especially important for me to mention here that Dr. Kawagley was my sixth-grade teacher. His teaching obviously went much further than my one-year experience with him. It resonated for me, a Native person, to actually have a Native teacher; he provided me with a role model and validated my “nativeness” in the very western setting of my school. Gunalsheesh (thank you), Oscar. As indigenous scholarship increases at the global level, exemplified by publications such as Decolonizing Methodology (1999) by Linda Tuhiwai Smith\n\nPreface xvii\n\n(Maori of New Zealand) and A Yupiaq Worldview (1995, 2006) by Oscar Angayuqaq Kawagley, the paradigm is shifting from one of nonindigenous people writing about indigenous people to indigenous people writing about indigenous people. This has provided new insight into Native perspectives on science, the arts, colonization, identity, education, and philosophy. New research methods are now emerging because of people like Stephen Langdon, Beth Leonard, Claudette Englom-Bradley, James Kari, George Charles, Nancy Furlow, and Jeane Breinig (all contributors to this volume), who have highlighted indigenous math systems, indigenous language and its link to history and culture and other new methodologies. Other contributors to this volume, such as Ted Mayac Sr., a traditional Iñupiaq hunter and renowned ivory carver; the Tlingit photographer Larry McNeil; and Perry Eaton, an Alutiiq/Sugpiaq artist and mask carver, provide unique perspectives on identity, resilience, and culture. Linguists such as Beth Ginondidoy Leonard (Athabascan) and Walkie Kumaggaq Charles (Yup’ik) offer insightful selections on the cultural perspective of languages, as they work on these issues with students who are learning their traditional languages and orthographies in a university setting. Other contributions include poetry by Richard Dauenhauer and Nora Dauenhauer, titans in the Alaska Native community. This reader also contains political histories that shed light on the Russian period in Alaska (see Solovjova and Vovnyanko), the seminal paper written (and delivered as a talk) in 1969 by William Hensley that provided a legal argument for Native land claims in Alaska, as well as Harold Napoleon’s heartbreaking analysis of the impact of diseases and their lasting effects, which he identifies as a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. These selections are republished here because they are groundbreaking works that represent a nonwestern-focused experience. The selections in this volume shed light on who Alaska Native people are, what their history has been, and the impacts of colonialism, in part by including a new cadre of indigenous leadership that has emerged in the twenty-first century. The first part, “Portraits of Nations: Telling Our Own Story,” includes oral narratives in several Alaska Native languages and provides an insider’s perspective on who Alaska Native people are. The second part, “Empire: Processing Colonization,” contains some of the darker essays on the colonial experience. Struggles for land claims, identity, and protection of traditional land bases provide a variety of responses to the colonial and neocolonial experience. The essays in the third part, “Worldviews: Alaska Native and Indigenous Epistemologies,” provide new models for viewing knowledge and the indigenous perspective on math, science, astronomy, and the cosmos. Excerpts from\n\nxviii Preface Kawagley’s A Yupiaq Worldview: A Pathway to Ecology and Spirit is included in this part. The fourth part, “Native Arts: A Weaving of Melody and Color,” includes selections on indigenous music, the rebirth of Kodiak mask making, and the use of digital media as artists address their work in the contemporary twenty-first century. The final part, “Ravenstales,” includes poetry, articles on Alaska Native literature, and even a recipe for moose ribs! Certainly one of the newer paradigms in indigenous publications today, and one which informs this volume, is a result of Linda Smith’s Decolonizing Methodologies (1999). Smith effectively addresses what she terms the “collective memory of imperialism” and the great imbalance between indigenous people and those who have studied them. It galls us that Western researchers and intellectuals can assume to know all that it is possible to know of us, on the basis of their brief encounters with some of us. It appalls us that the West can desire, extract and claim ownership of our ways of knowing, our imagery, the things we create and produce and then simultaneously reject the people who created and developed those ideas and seek to deny them further opportunities to be creators of their own culture and own nations. (1) As the number of indigenous scholars grows, the imbalance will hopefully come to some equanimity and knowledge will be the privilege of all—not just a few. With this volume, perhaps what we are striving for is to provide another perspective that will result in a larger shared knowledge.\n\nA Note on Style and Sources Some selections in this reader are abridged, and some have had documentation removed or modified.

All of the contributors to this volume also deserve to be recognized for their words, ideas, and willingness to share and educate. Working with such a talented and recognized group of authors has humbled me and I have often thought “Am I dreaming?” The color plates in the volume were made possible by a grant from the Alaska Native Arts Foundation. I gratefully acknowledge its support. I also want to thank several of my graduate students at the University of New Mexico who helped significantly with the making of the maps and also with the challenging process of Athabascan orthography in several of the essays. Aprell Emerson (Navajo) and Patrick Willink (Navajo) were especially helpful and gave willingly of their time and expertise. I must also thank my family, my mother, Marilyn, and all my sisters, who gave me lots of support and encouragement through the long editing process. Sadly, one of the contributors, Joan Pirciralria Hamilton, passed away in June 2008. She would have been so pleased to see this book. She was a special person who will be missed by all. I take full responsibility for any errors that have somehow been overlooked and hope that readers will take pleasure in this volume.\n\nAlaska and Its People: An Introduction Maria Shaa Tláa Williams\n\nAlaska is a vast subcontinent of North America and the largest state in the United States, encompassing over 590,000 square miles with over 33,000 miles of coastline. Alaska is one-fifth the size of the continental United States and over twice the size of Texas, the second largest state in the union. Alaska also has nearly 100,000 glaciers; the Malaspina glacier covers an area of more than 1,500 square miles, larger than that of some states.1 In physical characteristics, Alaska has thirty-nine majestic mountain ranges. Two of the larger ranges, the Brooks Range and the Alaska Range, divide the state into three major geographic areas. Of the twenty highest peaks in North America, seventeen are in Alaska, including Mount McKinley, which is referred to as Denali, meaning “the great one” in one of the Athabascan languages. It is the highest peak in North America at 20,360 feet and deserves the name Denali. The environmental landscape distinguishes Alaska from other parts of North America. Volcanoes and earthquakes are daily events in this expansive state.2 The largest volcanic eruption in North America in the twentieth century occurred in the Alaska Peninsula, when Mt. Novarupta erupted in 1912.3 This became a time marker for the Sugpiaq people of the region. Most of the volcanoes in Alaska are in this region and the Aleutian Island area and are often referred to as the “Ring of Fire” in the Pacific Ocean basin. The more than 1,200-mile-long archipelago of these volcanic islands is homeland to the Unangan or Aleut peoples. The word “Alaska” actually comes from the Unangan language. Alaxsxaq means “place the sea moves toward” (Ransom 1978, 199). Alyeska, another Unangan word, means “the Great Land” (Alaska Blue Book 1993–94, 247). Alaska’s wilderness is host to many animals, birds, and plants. Migratory birds come from five continents to nest in Alaska during the summer months (Ewing 1996, 211). Salmon, a migratory fish, forms a vital part of most indigenous Alaskan Native diets; seven types of salmon come through Alaska’s\n\nMaria Shaa Tláa Williams many rivers and streams from May through September. There are over 3,000 rivers in Alaska, the longest being the Yukon, which is over 2,298 miles long, with 1,875 of those miles in Alaska; its headwaters originate near Atlin, British Columbia, and its course ends in the Bering Sea. Rivers are not only an important source of salmon but also a major means of transportation (boats in the summer and snow machines in the winter). The largest freshwater lake in Alaska is Iliamna, on the Alaska Peninsula, which is over 1,150 square miles; Alaska has over three million lakes.4 As one moves through other geographic regions of Alaska, the light and the physical environments change dramatically. Alaska’s indigenous peoples adapted to its imposing landscape, living in concert with its geographic diversity and extreme climate changes. There are twenty different Native languages spoken in Alaska and roughly eight broad cultural groups. Of the 562 federally recognized tribes in the United States, 225 are in Alaska. For example, the Iñupiaq people, who live in the upper one-third of the state known as the Arctic, form part of the larger circumpolar Inuit indigenous nations. Changes in the light are extreme in this northern region, especially above the Arctic Circle. The summer days are long and filled with sunlight. In Barrow, the northernmost community in North America, the sun rises in mid-May and does not set until the first part of August, which is why Alaska is often called “land of the midnight sun.” The reverse is true in the winter when the sun sets in midNovember and does not rise again until the end of January (see Subhankar Banerjee’s images in this volume). Southeastern Alaska is a rainforest and part of the larger Pacific Northwest coast region, which stretches from northern California to Alaska. Average rainfall can exceed 200 inches and the thickly forested region is full of streams, fjords, glaciers, and wildlife. In this region the temperatures seldom dip below freezing. This region is homeland to the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples. The interior of Alaska, a vast region with major rivers (including the Yukon) and the tallest mountain in North America, is subject to great temperature changes. In fact, Fairbanks, in the heart of the interior, experiences the greatest degree of temperature change of any city in the world. The summers can reach over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, while the winters can go below minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit. There are many different Athabascan villages in this region, and eleven different Athabascan languages (see the articles in this volume by Langdon and Leggett, Leonard, Kari and John). Population estimates of Alaska’s indigenous people vary. Some precontact estimates suggest an average population of 80,000 (Langdon 2002, 4). It is clear that the Native population is growing; in 1960 it was 42,522 and in 2004 was\n\nArctic Ocean barrow\n\nChuckchi Sea\n\nBeaufort Sea Arctic Slop e Colville R. Brooks Range a t k a o R N .

In comparison the non-Native population in 1960 was 183,645, while in 2004 it was 528,427 (ibid.). The population estimate for the entire state in 2006 was 670,253, with almost half of the population living in and around Anchorage, the state’s largest city (Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Research Analysis, Demographic Unit). The next largest city, Fairbanks, has a population of 87,214.5 Anchorage is a modern city, founded in 1915 as a major railroad town. It is located in south central Alaska in the Cook Inlet region. The area is the homeland to the Dena’ina Athabascan peoples, who have lived in the region for thousands of years. As Anchorage grew into a boomtown, it overshadowed the indigenous history of the Dena’ina, as happened to indigenous history in many other major U.S. cities (see Langdon and Leggett in this volume). The indigenous peoples of Alaska occupy all regions of the state in over two hundred villages. However, there is a shifting demographic trend as indigenous people are moving to urban areas for jobs, education, and health care. According to the First Alaskans Institute, 58 percent of the Native population continues to live in what is called “rural” Alaska, referring to the numerous village settlements throughout the state. The over two hundred Native villages are not connected by roads and have a long history of occupation. Most transportation to rural communities occurs by air or by boat, if the village is along any of the large rivers. Almost 40 percent of the Native population lives in cities; these include the more modern settlements of Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Wasilla, Sitka, and Kodiak.6 Who are Alaska Native people? The term “Alaska Native” is a generic pejorative term, much like “American Indian.” These are political designations that evolved in the colonial and neocolonial periods and established an overarching definition for indigenous people. Today, Alaska Native is the accepted definition for the indigenous peoples of Alaska; in actuality there are twenty different indigenous languages spoken in Alaska and seven or eight broad cultural groups, depending upon interpretation. The indigenous people adapted themselves perfectly to their environments, creating unique watercraft such as qayaqs/kayaks (now found all over the world), waterproof stitching, weaving traditions, specialized harpoons and other hunting gear, and ingenious dwelling places. The different cultural groups also had varied social practices that were as wide ranging as the landscape. The twenty indigenous languages in Alaska can be categorized under four different language families: Eskimo-Aleut, Athabascan, Tsimshian, and Haida.7 Eleven different Athabascan languages are spoken in Alaska.8 The\n\nAlaska and Its People\n\nAthabascan language family is a large one. There are over sixty Athabascan villages in interior Alaska. Groups in Canada, parts of Oregon, northern California, and the southwestern United States, such as the Navajo and Apache, are part of this large language family. Unangan or Aleut is spoken on the Aleutian Islands, where thirteen villages are spread out over 1,100 miles of volcanic islands. The Yup’ik/Cup’ik language, spoken in sixty villages on the mainland of southwestern Alaska; its very close linguistic relative Siberian Yupik, spoken on St. Lawrence Island; and Sugcestun, spoken on Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula region, are mutually intelligible dialects. Sugpiaq or Sugcestun is spoken on Kodiak Island, parts of the Alaska Peninsula, and the Prince William Sound area and is closely related to Central Yup’ik, although the cultural and social practices of these groups are quite different. Kodiak Island is the second largest island in the United States (the first is Hawaii). Sugcestun is spoken in seven villages on Kodiak Island, eight villages in the Chugach region, and twelve villages in the Alaska Peninsula. Eyak, found east of the Prince William Sound area and bordering Tlingit territory, is related to the Athabascan language families, but the cultural practices of the Eyak people are distinct. The Tlingit language is spoken in the northern part of southeastern Alaska and parts of British Columbia. Tlingit people traditionally lived in fourteen villages spread throughout the area. Haida is found in the southern portion of southeastern Alaska and is a linguistic isolate. The Tsimshian language is spoken in a small portion of southeastern Alaska (in the village of Metlakatla) and is part of the Penutian language family. The Iñupiaq language in Alaska is related to the larger circumpolar Inuit language family found in Russia, Canada, Greenland, and Scandinavia; it is spoken in several regions in Alaska and has several different dialects. Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq is found in the Arctic Slope area, home to seven villages; Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq includes the Qawiaraq dialect spoken in over twenty-seven villages including the island communities of King Island and Little Diomede Island; the Malimiut dialect is found in the Kobuk region, which has eleven associated villages. The Alaska Native Language Center was established by the University of Alaska, Fairbanks in the early 1960s and has contributed greatly to the knowledge of Alaska’s indigenous languages through publications, development of written orthographies, dictionaries, and translation of oral histories. Several of our contributors, among them James Kari, have long associations with the Alaska Native Language Center (see Kari/Johns article in this volume). There has been a hyperfocus on the origins of Native Americans; Western scholars conjecture that there were three migrations out of Asia into North\n\nArctic Ocean\n\niñupiaq\n\nrussia siberian yupik\n\ngwich’in Athabascan Languages han koyukon tanana tanacross holikachuk upper deg xinag kuskokwin upper dena’ina ahtna tanana central yup’ik cup’ik eyak\n\nalutiiq/ sugcestun unangan (aleut)\n\nPacific Ocean Map 2. Distribution of Alaska Native languages\n\ncanada\n\ntlingit haida\n\ntsimshian\n\nAlaska and Its People\n\nAmerica over the past ten to thirty thousand years or more. Indigenous origin stories are often more complex and much more interesting because they are related to both physical and metaphysical cosmologies. For example, each individual Tlingit clan has a separate origin story that describes a distant time when people and animals could speak to one another and even intermarry. Cajete (in this volume) addresses how astronomy and the stars can also relate the origin stories of indigenous peoples. There are several different interpretations of how the indigenous people of Alaska can be viewed in terms of cultural groups. Today there is much discussion and debate on synonymy, or how people are called. The self-designative terms are quite numerous and village specific in Alaska. With over two hundred villages, this can get complicated. For example, the people on King Island or Ukivok, an Iñupiaq-speaking village, call themselves “Ukivokmiut”—or “the winter place people.” The larger terms such as “Iñupiaq” or “Yup’ik” or “Tlingit” often translate into “people,” or “real people” in the case of Yup’ik. Certainly the eleven different Athabascan-speaking peoples consider themselves related and share many cultural practices; politically they have formed alliances, even through modern times. This could be considered one culture group, even though they speak eleven different dialects and occupy the largest region of Alaska. Their current landholdings, after the 1971 Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act, are 12.5 million acres. They are the largest private landowners in Alaska. The Athabascan people continue to occupy and hunt in their historic land base. Athabascan people live, hunt, and seasonally occupy areas north to south from the Brooks Range to the Alaska Range. From east to west there are Athabascan settlements from the Canadian border to the interior of the Norton Sound area.9 The Unangan people of the Aleutian Islands historically were divided into nine subdivisions and spoke ten dialects (Bergland and Dirks 1990); however, beginning with the Russian period in the eighteenth century, they began to lose their political differences and could be considered as one culture group today. The islands stretch over 1,200 miles into the Pacific Ocean, and the Unangan developed the qayaq and unique hunting implements, elaborate body art and decoration, and a complex and stratified social system. They were also the first to face the brunt of Russian colonial practices. The people on Kodiak Island, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Prince William Sound area speak Sugcestun, though they each have unique histories and cultural practices, resulting in complex relationships. Historically, Kodiak had over three dozen villages. After a major smallpox epidemic of 1835–40, and the harsh treatment they received from the Russian fur companies, only ten villages exist today. The Chugach people of the Prince William Sound area live\n\nMaria Shaa Tláa Williams in their long-inhabited traditional villages.10 The Sugcestun-speaking people on the Alaska Peninsula occupy nearly a dozen settlements. The Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian of southeastern Alaska speak three completely unrelated languages. They are not even in the same language family; however, their cultural practices are very similar in art, music, dance, and clanbased systems and patterns of reciprocity guided by moiety and status. The Iñupiaq of Alaska, who occupy the Seward Peninsula, the Kobuk region, and the Arctic (North) Slope region, could be viewed as one group linked by language and subsistence patterns, though there are significant differences. The dialect of Inuit spoken in the North Slope region is not mutually intelligible with the languages spoken in the Kobuk or Seward Peninsula regions. Each of the over forty Iñupiaq villages has subtle, unique differences, perhaps because of their perfection in adapting to the environments they have lived in for so many thousands of years. Langdon (2002, 62–63) divides them into five major groups: the North Alaska Coast Iñupiaq, the Interior North Alaska Coast Iñupiaq, the Kotzebue Sound Iñupiaq, the Norton Sound/Seward Peninsula Iñupiat, and the Bering Straits Iñupiat. The Yup’ik/Cup’ik people of southwestern Alaska certainly must be viewed as a separate cultural area. Historically, they were often called “Eskimo” along with the Iñupiaq. The term “Eskimo” is the outside or pejorative term and it is beginning to lose favor because it is simply too broad and inaccurate. The Yup’ik/Cup’ik or Yupiaq occupy the entire southwestern mainland portion of Alaska, including the Yukon/Kuskokwim Delta area and the Bristol Bay region.11 These are rich ecosystems that continue to support over fifty-six villages in the Yukon/Kuskokwim Delta and eleven in the Bristol Bay region. The Yupiaq continue to live off the abundant salmon runs in the larger riverine areas, as well as the coastal marine mammals from the Bering Sea coast. The Siberian Yupik of St. Lawrence Island, who number about 1,500, have historically been called Yup’ik or Eskimo; their language is mutually intelligible with Central Yup’ik (found on the mainland of Alaska) but their cultural and social practices are distinct and they are much more closely connected to their Siberian counterparts. Because their cultural practices are not directly similar to Yup’ik or Iñupiaq, they must be viewed as their own cultural area.12 Eyak, like the Siberian Yupik, provides another example of how difficult it can be to classify Native peoples of Alaska. Although the Eyak language is from the Athabascan language family, their cultural practices are different and they could also be considered a separate ethnic or cultural group. They have practices similar to their Sugcestun-speaking neighbors to the west, their Tlingit neighbors to the southeast, and their Athabascan counterparts to the\n\nAlaska and Its People\n\nnorth, but they developed individual art forms and subsistence and social practices that set them apart from their Athabascan relations. Given all of this, one could say there are innumerable culture groups, but for the sake of clarity we identify eight broad cultural areas in Alaska. (1) Athabascan; (2) Northwest coast (Tlingit/Haida/Tsimshian); (3) Siberian Yup’ik (St. Lawrence Island); (4) Yup’ik/Cup’ik/Yupiaq; (5) Iñupiaq; (6) Alutiiq/Sugpiaq (Kodiak Island, Prince William Sound, Alaska Peninsula); (7) the Unangan of the Aleutian Islands; and (8) Eyak (Williams 2001). The first European arrivals to Alaska were the Russians in the mideighteenth century, but other Europeans came to Alaska in the late eighteenth century as well, including the Spanish, French, British, and North Americans. By 1867 Alaska became part of the United States through the Treaty of Cession with Russia, and in 1958 Alaska became the forty-ninth state in the Union. The initial historic contacts are fascinating (see Kari/John and Solovjova/Vovnyanko in this volume). The various contributions to The Alaska Native Reader will clarify and provide more detail on the colonial history and also the political history of Alaska and its indigenous peoples. The diverse geography of Alaska is matched by its Native people; one cannot separate them from “the last frontier.” Alaska Native people have proven to be resilient and able to adapt to the larger geopolitical world. Many of the contributions in this reader detail some of the remarkable histories that set Alaska apart from any other place or people in the world.\n\nNotes Dr. Phyllis Fast, assistant professor of anthropology and liberal studies at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, helped draft an earlier version of this introduction.

Since indigenous languages in Alaska were not written, all knowledge was transmitted through oral narratives; these took the form of historical accounts, songs, and legendary history. This oral history, presented in the Ahtna language, one of the twenty indigenous languages spoken in Alaska, tells of one of the first encounters between the Ahtna and the Russians. It is an Upper Ahtna narrative, from a larger work of Upper Ahtna narratives, and has been transcribed in Ahtna and translated into English by James Kari. In this account Katie and Fred John describe in great detail an altercation on the Upper Copper River between the Ahtna and a group of Russians, perhaps as early as 1794–95. This narrative relates how the Ahtna reacted to an intrusion by a group of Russian explorers, led by a Dena’ina Athabascan guide. The Dena’ina guide aided the Ahtna by purposefully mistranslating the Athabascan into Russian to give the Ahtnas the upper hand. The story illustrates the early colonial period and the indigenous reaction to encroachment by outsiders. The words of the Ahtna narrative about their attack on the Russians, “and the spears fell like frost crystals,” are haunting. Katie and Fred John are Upper Ahtna Athabascan from Mentasta. Fred was the traditional chief of Mentasta until his death in 2001. Katie John is well known for her leadership in protecting subsistence rights via her involvement with the landmark 1990 case, Katie John et al. v. the State of Alaska, and for her subsequent work protecting traditional fishing and hunting lifestyles in rural communities. James Kari, a professor emeritus at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, is a linguist who specializes in Athabascan languages and oral history. His landmark work with Katie and Fred John has resulted in publications of oral histories and narratives in Ahtna, one of the eleven Athabascan languages spoken in Alaska. Among Professor Kari’s many publications\n\n16 James Kari, Katie and Fred John are a collection of Belle Deacon’s stories, Deg Hit’an Athabascan, and The Ahtna Athabascan Dictionary.

And then they had killed off the Russians.\n\nCommentary by James Kari There are two stories from the upper Copper River area in which Russians (or non-Ahtnas) are killed. The earlier incident, portrayed here, took place at Nataełde (Batzulnetas). The later incident occurred at Stl’aa Caegge (Slana). There has been considerable controversy about these events as depicted in the oral history of the Ahtna and other historic sources. I present here, in brief, evidence which suggests that the Batzulnetas incident occurred very early in the Russian colonial period, possibly in the winter of 1794–95, and involved the Samoilov party, and that the second incident at Slana occurred in June of 1848, and involved the Serebrennikov party. Confusion about these dates stems from Strong’s interpretation that the earlier Batzulnetas incident involved the Serebrennikov party (Strong 1972; John and John 1973). The Batzulnetas story takes place in the fall-winter, and the Slana story takes place in the summer. According to information in Serebrennikov’s journal, which was brought by Ahtnas to Nuchek, in Prince William Sound, his party was killed in late June of 1848 (Doroshin 1866, 27–31, Hanable 1982, 28). We have record of another incident in which a large group of Russians and creoles was killed on the Copper River; this involved the thirteen-man Samoilov party of the Lebedev-Lastochkin company, who ascended the Copper River in 1794. Baranov, manager of the Russian-American Company, first learned in Kenai in June of 1795 that this party, led by Samoilov, had been killed somewhere on the Copper River (Tikhmenev 1978, 42). Ketz (1983, 10) believes that Davydov’s account, based on his travel in Alaska in 1802–7, refers to the Samoilov party. Davydov, who does not mention Samoilov by name, nor a date, notes that Copper River Natives, prior to 1801, had killed everyone in a group of Russians except their commander (perhaps C’uket Ta’ in the Johns’ account here), that Ahtnas had tortured one of the Russians, and that the Russians had provoked the incident by abducting women and driving out the men in the winter without adequate clothing (Davydov 1977, 189). The incident at Batzulnetas as told by the Johns corresponds with Davydov’s account, except that there is no mention of Russians being tortured.9 Other factors in determining the chronology of these incidents are as follows: Yałniił Ta,’ chief in this story, is the earliest chief of Batzulnetas that Fred and Katie John know by name. They cannot date his death. Katie John states\n\n26 James Kari, Katie and Fred John that the Kluane Lake incident occurred sometime after the Batzulnetas incident and perhaps ten years or less before the Slana incident. Fred John states that Takol’iix Ta,’ the chief of Mentasta who was the prime instigator in the Slana incident, was the son of an Ahtna woman and one of the Russians killed at Batzulnetas (and was Fred John’s grandfather). I would thus estimate his birth date as 1795–96. The most interesting figure in the account presented here is C’uket Ta,’ the guide and interpreter for the Russians. He was a Dastnaey, or Dena’ina, probably from Kenai, who deliberately mistranslated and concealed information from other members of the group while the Ahtna men prepared to re­ taliate. I give particular weight to the accounts presented here by the Johns because 1) they are told in their Native language, 2) both of these incidents took place in the narrators’ own country, 3) the Johns have repeatedly told these stories to Native and non-Native audiences, and 4) the transcripts have been reviewed and cross-checked with both narrators and compared with historical sources. It should be noted that Ahtnas from the lower Copper River also tell stories about these incidents, and there are details in those accounts that are not mentioned in the Johns’ stories.\n\nNotes 1. C’uket Ta’s identification as “Aleut” by Strong in John and John (1973) was the result of a mistranslation. The Johns and other Ahtnas identify the Chugach people of Prince William Sound as Skesnaey or (in English) Aleut. In this story C’uket Ta’ is identified as Dastnaey (Dena’ina), he has an Athabaskan name, and he speaks Ahtna well enough to dupe the Russians. 2. Yałniił Ta’ is chief of this territory. Here he calls out his own personal name, an act that is considered a very bold challenge. 3. This bit of mistranslation is the first evidence of collaboration between C’uket Ta’ and the Upper Ahtnas. 4. The Ahtnas had never worked with dog skin before. It was ‘engii,’ taboo. 5. Fred John told this portion of the story prior to the previous section told by Katie John. Portions here duplicate Katie’s longer version. 6. Note that this phrase c’etsen’ ‘ekkutsaas, ‘difficult meat,’ appears in the war song that was made after the battle. 7. Yałniił Ta,’ chief of Batzulnetas, says his name to himself as his ultimate challenge to those who are whipping him. In other words, “Who are you guys? Are your names of higher value than my own? I am the authority over this country.” The use of Ahtna personal names is a matter of complex etiquette. 8. That is, they ended the war.\n\nWhen Russians Were Killed 27 9. Katherine Arndt (personal communication) cautions that the historic record of Russian entry into Copper River is very fragmentary and that the Nataełde incident might have involved one of the other parties reported to have been killed on the Copper River. These include Bazhenov, who was killed ca. 1804–5, and Galaktionov and his interpreter, who also were killed ca. 1804–5. Further work with Lower Ahtna history may clarify the record.\n\nThe Fur Rush: A Chronicle of Colonial Life Katerina G. Solovjova and Aleksandra A. Vovnyanko\n\nThe following is an excerpt from The Fur Rush: Essays and Documents on the History of Alaska at the End of the Eighteenth Century by Katerina G. Solovjova and Aleksandra A. Vovnyanko (Phenix Press, 2002). The book is a major work that provides detailed information on the Russian presence in Alaska during the later part of the eighteenth century, including substantial new information. This excerpt is from chapter 3, which traces the events year by year from 1784 to 1800 with detailed information on historical figures, the exploration, exploitation, and importance of furs, and daily life for both Russian and Native peoples. Solovjova’s and Vovnyanko’s work is exceptional and their documentation is impeccable, bringing to light sources that have not been available before now. The book should be standard reading for anyone interested in Alaska history, especially Alaska Native history. In the history of Alaska, at the end of the eighteenth century, specific evidence makes it possible to speak of a “fur rush” as the characteristic occurrence that influenced the fate of the country and people. The desire of the merchants’ companies to enrich themselves by importing American furs led to sending Russian trading ships on voyages to the east. According to the renowned Russian historian N. N. Bolkhovitinov, “Just as the ‘sable’s tail’ guided the Russians through the boundless expanses of Siberia to the Pacific Ocean, the invaluable fur of the sea otter brought them to the shores of North America” (1997, vol. 1, 5). Different merchants sent about 80 fur trading expeditions. The 40-year epic of seafarers and promyshlenniki1 sailing across the ocean and exploring the Aleutian Islands ended with G. I. Shelikhov’s seizure of Kodiak Island, an event customarily considered as the culmination of the Russians’ securing of America. The character of colonization was sharply changed with the introduction of big merchant capital and the monopolization of Alaskan natural resources. The grandiose plans of the merchant Shelikhov, harsh colonial poli-\n\nThe Fur Rush 29\n\ntics, support for his activities in government circles of the Russian Empire, and persistent methods of wringing out furs—all reflected in the struggles and tense daily life of the people on the shores of northwestern America, who were greatly affected by the fur rush. The end of the nineteenth century gave Alaska a gold rush, but earlier, in the eighteenth century a fur rush had emerged in this land. The scope of these two rushes and many of their features differ. These features are primarily connected with the situation that the people—the Natives and the unwelcome newcomers—were in. The economic interests of the Russian merchants and expansionist politics of the government of the Russian Empire had a significant impact on the fur rush. This chapter attempts to illuminate specific aspects of the colonial process in which various people participated. These people acted, struggled, made decisions and mistakes, risked their lives, and perished. The essay seeks to examine the conditions of these peoples’ lives and works, and does not claim to cover the full scope of the historical events in Alaska at the end of the eighteenth century. Thus, the essay centers on the issues and events that characterized the situation in the Russian colonies as extraordinarily dangerous and strained. Some of these events have been insufficiently or erroneously elaborated, or have been ignored by the researchers. For example, a document, one of the first to be created on Kodiak, should be mentioned. Most historians narrating the account of G. I. Shelikhov’s stay on Kodiak rely on his “Note” of 1787 or his book republished in 1971.2 However, Shelikhov’s testimony, as is well known, is not entirely reliable. Researchers have completely lost sight of a very interesting document: the resolution, adopted by Shelikhov on December 11, 1785, at the conference with the mariners of his company.3 The document outlines for the first time the main problems regarding interactions between the Russians and the Native populations, and thus it became the basis for the pro­cess of their interaction. In this resolution, signed by the mariners, the most emphasis was given to relations between the Europeans and peoples unknown to them, whom it was necessary to “find for bargaining and subdue into citizenship of the Russian Empire.” These relations were called “reconciliation.” As is noted in the document, within the first year Shelikhov’s men found many peoples and their hunting grounds, but because of their lack of strength (some of the new arrivals died and tradable goods had run out) they were not able to procure furs or explore new regions. Because of the small number of people it was dangerous for the Russians to live even with the already “reconciled” Kodiak people.4 Shelikhov’s people realized that without successful barter they would suffer great losses, and some would fall into irredeemable debt. Perhaps Shelikhov\n\n30 Katerina G. Solovjova and Aleksandra A. Vovnyanko tried to introduce these ideas to his men. Participants of the conference recognized that “with difficulty and great battles they conquered” the Native.\n\n1784 Two such battles are known. Shelikhov carried out the first against the [Kodiak] islanders 35 miles south of Trekhsviatitel’skaia Harbor in the first half of August.5 Shelikhov’s cruel massacre subjugated the Kodiak people, who did not succeed in uniting for a repulse and could not retaliate without effective weapons. On the first days of the Russians’ presence in Manikaksik Harbor, which they named Trekhsviatitel’skaia [Three Saints] Harbor, Shelikhov sent his people in baidarki (kayaks) to become familiar with the coast of the large island and its hostile inhabitants. The news of the arrival of two large ships caused unrest in the Native villages on the south shore of the island, and they, as was their tradition, sought safety on a kekur (seastack), that is, on a large rock separated from the shore.6 The Kodiak people de­fended themselves with arrows and stones. The besieged expected reinforcements, therefore Shelikhov decided to “take possession . . . of the rock, which they occupied as a fortress.” Shelikhov directed a ship to the kekur. This vessel had 71 Russian employees on board and was armed with firearms and five cannons, whose firing scared the Koniag: “terror was born and timidity seized them.” The assailants stormed the seastack, destroyed the huts, and took captive those islanders who stayed alive. According to Shelikhov’s report, Russians drove captive Koniag to their camp. Later, this seastack was named on Russian maps Razbitoi (Crushed). The Natives called the cliff Avauk (Frozen with Fear). This battle was a great tragedy for the islanders. Shelikhov did not report the number of people killed, but precisely noted that “of the Koniag they took more than a thousand people captive” (Andreev 1948, 231). Only five Russians were wounded. Shelikhov named the peninsula, the cape, and the nearby bay after his wife Nataliia. Even after this bloody massacre, at a conference with the mariners he hypocritically recommended “bringing new natives to friendship through tender treatment.” The primary reason for the clash was the Native inhabitants’ unwillingness to become dependent on the new arrivals. And the Russians used their frightful weapons wherever they encountered resistance. Navigator G. G. Izmailov reported that when the Natives did not consent to give amanaty (hostages), Shelikhov’s detachment killed approximately 150 to 200 islanders of both sexes. Many Natives threw themselves out of fear from the seastack into the water and onto the baidary and drowned. About 200 to 300 people were\n\nThe Fur Rush 31\n\ntaken captives, primarily women, children, and the elderly. They were kept in the harbor for a month and a half. Shelikhov himself selected a chief or toion, who was showered with gifts and entertained.7 When the husbands, fathers, and relatives began to arrive, Shelikhov returned the children to them. “According to our desire, these inhabitants who were subjugated peacefully began to arrive with friendly disposition and sought a comfortable livelihood, leaving me not a small number of their children as amanaty; through this a method useful to the future of our fatherland was also discovered” (Andreev 1948, 211). In this exchange Shelikhov considered that he had found a way to bind the Natives to himself. He punished the rebellious Native inhabitants with a pistol and whipped them with baleen.8 Thus, Shelikhov brought the Americans under the authority of the Russian Empire. It was necessary to seek out skilled hunters in the villages where the Koniag and Kodiak Aleuts lived, as the Russians sometimes called them. The colonists established control over the male population, taking more than 400 amanaty (Andreev 1948, 178).9 Relatives of the captives brought food to them and paid tribute to the victors. They were forced to make contact with the Russians, who had run out of goods with which to trade for furs. As a result of dwindling trade and food supplies, the Russians needed replenishment from Okhotsk.10 Lack of goods was used as the primary reason for Shelikhov’s departure on 22 May 1786,11 when he took with him only 12 Russians and “up to 40 captive men, women, and children from different villages” (Andreev 1948, 188).12 Employees of Shelikhov’s company sought out local people on his order not only for making trade arrangements, but also to take hostages across the ocean. Shelikhov’s employees continued his predatory practices. For example, his sailor D. I. Shirokov, with the crew of the ship Sv. Ioann Predtecha, wintered on Unalaska in Samganuda Bay, forcibly took “50 men and 30 women islanders,” and set out for the Pribilof Islands to hunt.13 In 1784 Shelikhov took 10 Unalaskans and 2 interpreters with him to Kodiak. In his “Note” he reports that “70 Fox Islands Aleuts, voluntarily [served him] for pay” (Andreev 1948, 183, 228, 240). He recommended that his mariner D. I. Bocharov “take out of necessity up to 20 people of our Fox Islands Aleuts.” When Evstratii Delarov, already an employee of the Northeastern Company (NEC), was sent to Kodiak, in Unalaska he “wintered and took along with him 30 Aleut men and 2 Aleut women.”14 The well-known partovshchik (a participant in the hunting party or sometimes its head) Egor Purtov, who transferred from the crew of merchants Panovs’s ship Sv. Aleksei to serve in the NEC, thought that Shelikhov had falsely reported the total number of 20,000 inhabitants on Kodiak Island15 and the 500\n\n32 Katerina G. Solovjova and Aleksandra A. Vovnyanko who paid tribute. In fact there were “no more than 3,000 people in the surrounding islands and no more than 50 yasak (government tax paid in goods) payers.”16 It is possible these were the relatives of the amanaty. K. T. Khlebnikov considered that “Shelikhov, for enlarging his glory, rashly over-stated the number of subjected people on Kodiak as 50,000 souls and this frightful number was striking to all. Therefore, they lashed at Baranov when by actual calculation it turned out to be 6,000 souls” (Khlebnikov 1835, 182). Shelikhov planned to strengthen the depleted artels of the Russian hunters by adding “reconciled” Native inhabitants and at the same time establish control over all Koniag settlements. He considered the Natives as serfs without rights who could be ruled at his will. Shelikhov called them “American bondsmen” (Andreev 1948, 201). He wrote to his governors that it was necessary “to select in advance young and good boys and girls from the Kenai and Chugach clans for transporting them for education and to teach some of them here [in America] Russian grammar and speaking for translations. And it became quite necessary to especially try to take some [future students] from the Alaska mainland to California from 50° N [south]” (Andreev 1948, 195). The Irkutsk governor I. V. Yakobii considered this a reliable course toward the Russianization of the “backward” transoceanic peoples and developing their devotion to the Russian Empress Catherine II.17 In his book and accounts to the government, Shelikhov tried to show that he aspired to protect the Natives, to care for them and their amanat children, to reconcile them and to provide an introduction to the customs and life of Russian people. Shelikhov pretended that finally he won such love that the Natives “all call me their father” (Andreev 1948, 232–37).\n\n1785 Company employees conducted the first study of Kodiak and surrounding islands from May to August in the galliot Tri Sviatitelia. Navigators G. Izmailov and D. Bocharov commanded the ship for this voyage and described the shoreline of the island and the mouth of Cook Inlet, the Native villages, and the locations of rich hunting grounds, and marked them on a map and various plans. The maps indicate that at the mouth of Cook Inlet the Russians reached Sel’devaia (Seldovia) Bay and set up camp there.18 “When the Russians arrived for the first time in Kenai Bay [Cook Inlet] the ship’s captain detached several people to seize the Natives in order to acquaint themselves with them,” reported G. I. Davydov. “They found seven or eight families and led them to the ship, but the Kenaitzy (Dena’ina), thinking that they were being taken\n\nThe Fur Rush 33\n\ninto bondage, strangled all their wives and children, and then hanged themselves” (1812, 2: 33).19 Davydov, an officer of the Russian fleet, believed that this occurred because of lack of agreement and mutual trust. He did not take into account the mentality of the Native Americans, whose view of the world had developed during their struggle for the source of provisions in internecine warfare. It is natural that they also viewed the Russians as enemies who forcefully seized them and forced them to leave their dwellings. One father said this about his boy: “Better to let him die now than be made to grow up a kaiur [slave]” (1812, 2: 34–35).20 The Native people did not attack this expedition and some even gave up to 20 people as amanaty. “By contrast, there was almost no significant trade there at this time, because the local inhabitants . . . were afraid to join in such relations, in spite of the fact that they had given amanaty,” Shelikhov ascertained. Returning from the expedition, the Russians arranged to winter at the populous village of Karluk [on Kodiak Island]. They sailed along the shore of the strait, took hostages from the village, and procured furs.21 According to maps and reports about these events, Shelikhov participated in the voyage; however, company employees wrote that he “did not leave from this harbor [Three Saints Bay] the entire time of his stay until 1786.”22 On the northwestern side of Kodiak, among the hills, flows the large Karluk River. An old Koniagmiut (Alutiiq) village, Karluk, was located on the shore of a convenient lagoon. The residents occupied themselves primarily with catching fish. Initially the colonists constructed a fortified barracks in the Karluk artel. Later they enclosed their fort with a small earthen rampart and built a sentry booth and support structures. The artel leader, the baidarshchik, was in charge of several villages of Natives and forced the men to work for the company—hunting sea otters and stocking up on food supplies—while the women caught and stashed fish and picked berries.23 Colonists settled in various artels because they needed food from the adjacent Koniagmiut (Alutiiq) villages. The concentration of the crews of two ships in Three Saints Bay could lead to shortage of provisions and thereby result in hunger. Shelikhov planned to “keep 163 people in each artel” at eight locations (Andreev 1948, 184, 186). The first description of Karluk in the historical documents was as a Russian artel that maintained control of both shores of Shelikof Strait, that is, the villages of Karluk, Geopolik, Katmai, Kukan, and Naushak. Promyshlenniki arranged themselves near the huts of the Natives in Karluk and began to build the structures necessary for the stay, not forgetting to guard them. The builders of the fortification at Karluk were the promyshlenniki Aleksei Chernykh, Egor Bronnikov, Emel’ian Nekipelov, Piotr Popov, Vasilii Gorin,\n\n34 Katerina G. Solovjova and Aleksandra A. Vovnyanko Piotr Kalmyk, Demid Kulikalov, Fiodor Kochnev, Filipp Reviakin, Protasov, Aleksandr Molev, Egor Baranov, Ivan Repin, and Nikolai Mal’tsov. Vasilii Malakhov managed this artel. The living conditions of Shelikhov’s company employees were elaborated in a document of December 11, 1785. By winter, scurvy had begun to rage in the Russian camp. “All were sick and in despair,” wrote Shelikhov. At this time, the only food available for the sick was worm-eaten bitter yukola (dried fish) covered with mold, “from which many got various illnesses: fever and scurvy and ended their lives in misery.” But Shelikhov did not provide provisions for even the people in most desperate need. After many had died, and food could not even save those who were dying, he “began on the 25th of December to provide one and a half pounds [per person] per week of the company provisions,” but the promyshlenniki were now unable to use it because they were too sick and extremely exhausted.24 Those colonists who remained alive were not strong enough to move to new places. The people lacked the provisions and goods to trade for furs. Ivan Belonogov was “brutally whipped with lashes” by the company owner for defending the promyshlenniki’s rights against the deception and fraud of the master. The hunters Basov and Kochnov were also beaten on the deck.25 Shelikhov treated his crew as if they did not have rights. He threatened to his subordinates that they all “would be left forever in these islands.”26 Striving to construct permanent settlements and declaring that the company was established for a term of no less than 10 years, Shelikhov had not prepared the legal base for the long stay of the employees on Kodiak. He had intended with the help of various contrivances and by force to keep them there in spite of the fact that their passports were only valid for seven years. Ten years later he collected from his employees without warrant their payments for their passports, as well as their relatives’ debts and government duties [taxes].27 In order to attract people to his company, Shelikhov promised to pay for their work at the rate of half a share to a promyshlennik, as was a tradition in the other companies in the Aleutian Islands. He also promised to sell provisions at an increase of only 10 kopecks. In fact, in his “Book on the Merits of the Vessels’s Crew” Shelikhov wrote down each cup of grits, candle, and glass of vodka, as well as the amount of tea issued, pricing the items eight times higher than what he’d originally promised. In Okhotsk the price for provisions was less than 3 rubles, while on Kodiak the people were forced to pay 24 rubles. Shelikhov arbitrarily charged such impossible prices, conveniently forgetting his Okhotsk agreement to increase fees minimally.28 The drama-filled documents brim with facts that reveal Shelikhov’s unfair and cruel practices. The inexperienced common people were so trusting that\n\nThe Fur Rush 35\n\nthey signed papers committing themselves to work three more years after the return of the ship. In Okhotsk Shelikhov had promised them that they would receive part of the shares that belonged to the deceased. They believed that Shelikhov would honestly divide up the procured sea otters when employees were not present. They wrote: “In Okhotsk you, yourself, collect our shares in the furs and the small individual scraps of furs divide as payment of debts [to the owners]” (Andreev 1948, 181).29 At the same time they realized that with the small quantity of remaining wares they would suffer great financial loss and even go into irredeemable debt to Shelikhov. Upon joining the company and in hopes of becoming rich, the people believed the promises of being able to obtain their portion of the furs. The feverish haste of preparations, the equipping and dispatching of ships, the false promises of the owners, and the strain of the situation before leaving the port of Okhotsk—all of these misled them. Starting on a distant journey across the ocean they believed that they would receive deserved pay for their labor. But the real events in America led to bitter disappointment. During the two years Shelikhov was present on Kodiak as the organizer of permanent settlements and the “peace­maker” with the Native peoples, the aspects of colonial life, which over the years led to steady antagonistic relations between the owner and the common employees, ac­quired clear outlines. These aspects also shaped the relations between the Russians and Native inhabitants, thus influencing the social status of the latter.\n\n1786 For procuring sea and land animals, the company primarily used the labor of the indigenous islanders who were natural hunters. The Natives were forced to supply the colonists with fish, game, berries, and other products. They also carried out the duties of unskilled workers in the settlements and acted as guides on trails and portages unfamiliar to the Russians, rowers in three-hatch baidarki, and interpreters during the visits of unknown Native peoples.30 Within the colonial pyramid of social status, the indigenous inhabitants were considered the base of it. The company owners and the chief governor managed the company employees—prikazchiki (managers of private or government enterprise appointed by an owner), baidarshchiki (heads of a hunters’ party moving in baidarki), and promyshlenniki—who in turn supervised the Natives. Because of the hostile surroundings, the Russian employees were forced to carry out the duties of building and protecting the settlements. Yet they served only as middlemen during the purchase of furs.31 The owners watchfully made sure that not one skin, not one scrap of fur went astray.32\n\n36 Katerina G. Solovjova and Aleksandra A. Vovnyanko Therefore, the promyshlenniki were not allowed to exchange furs among themselves. The employees gathered all the fur parkas the islanders wore, and eventually the Natives began to wear clothing sewn from cheap Chinese fabrics. From the traditional clothing they kept only the waterproof kamleiki (an outer garment Aleuts wore to protect other clothing from water) made from animal gut. The shortage of goods was alleviated by the Kodiak people’s growing demand for iron-made items. Shelikhov permitted the remaining promyshlenniki to exchange iron tools for furs without the knowledge of the government. It is notable that at the same time he feared that all the Natives’ furs would go to Unga Island, that is, to the company of merchants Panovs, where Delarov served as peredoushchik. The latter did not know about Shelikhov’s apprehensions, so he helped with advice and promised to send his people (Andreev 1948, 191, 213). One of the most important aspects typical of Russian colonization was the Russians’ dependence on the Natives. Among the Russians quarrels emerged over the division of hunting places and the seizure of Natives for work. The promyshlenniki took them by force from the villages: from Unalaska more than 100 hunters with wives were taken to the Alaska Peninsula and the islands of Sannakh, Unga, Unimak, and Kodiak, and “from those who remained they took baidarki, arrows, parkas, and food supplies. [Only] a small number [of people] returned, [the rest] died there of starvation. Great hunger devastated the villages.” The baidarshchik Pshenichnyi violated and beat women with clubs, flogging six to death.33 According to the Canadian researcher J. R. Gibson, the Russians depended on the Natives for basic necessities such as furs, provisions, labor, and sexual relations (Gibson (1980–1986[?], 1–36). These needs of the newcomers were directly connected to their usurpation of sources for subsistence, land, villages, and the Alaskan peoples themselves. The Russians’ primary goal was the acquisition of furs, but promyshlenniki chronically lacked the goods for exchange. Therefore they became embittered and disregarded the vital interests and customs of the Native Americans. The Russian colonists were not able to effectively match the skills of the local hunters, who were unsurpassed in their ability to land marine mammals. As a result, the use of Native forced labor became a source of enrichment for the fur-trading companies. The Russians’ effort to settle near the Native villages, to obtain furs from the inhabitants at inequitable prices, and to use them as hunters, servants without rights, concubines, and even slaves—all this brought on protests and armed conflict. A. A. Baranov confirmed that for a long time “many people and whole villages were not brought to their\n\nThe Fur Rush 37\n\nknees” (Tikhmenev 1863, 2: appendix 42). The Natives of Alaska, armed with their arrows and spears, were not able to withstand the force of the western arrivals, who were equipped with firearms and ship’s cannons with 21/2 pound shot. “Such weapons were not known and especially frightening to the people in a land where there were rarely thunderstorms with thunder and lightning.” Eventually the Koniag became forced laborers for the Russians (Chaussonnet 1996, 29). Characteristic features of Shelikhov’s politics in the colonies were his striving to procure furs from the Natives at any price, bloody punishment of the indocile, and satisfaction of his selfish goals through deception and exploitation of the Russian employees. From the time of his voyage these practices became the standard of relations between the peoples in the colonies. Many contemporaries of the events have noted the lawlessness, the backbreaking work, and the coercion that caused the spiritual depression of the people in the lower classes of the colonial pyramid. But Shelikhov worried least of all about the fate of the people whom his methods of conducting colonial economics most painfully affected. He represented the top of the colonial pyramid, where the profits were concentrated, and simultaneously he was a distinct buffer between the government and the company interests in the colonies. He camouflaged the true position of affairs in the colonies and his selfish interests with false promises and patriotic ­rhetoric. The second battle occurred in May on Shuyak Island, the day before Shelikhov’s departure for Okhotsk. In spring, he had sent the promyshlenniki Sekerin and Labanov into Cook Inlet with an interpreter, having secured the support of the toion (a chief or a wealthy noble Native) of Shuyak Island. But the toion betrayed his Russian khaskhak (friend), killed the messengers, and plundered the goods. The irritated Shelikhov took vengeance on the islanders and sent two armed flotillas to the place where they lived, including three baidary of Natives and fifty Russians under the leadership of Konstantin A. Samoilov and Vasilii I. Malakhov, who found the instigators of the murder and killed them. The ensuing battle, similar to the one on the seastack Razbitoi, took place on the east coast of Shuyak Island. Analogous evil deeds, dictated by Shelikhov, significantly influenced the decrease in Native population in the Kodiak Archipelago. In memory of this devastating battle, two islands there were named Bol’shoi Fort [Big Fort] and Malyi Fort [Little Fort]. Three days before his departure, Shelikhov obtained a report that “the enemy is annihilated.”34 In spring Shelikhov experienced a shortage of working people. By April of the previous year he had turned to other companies for help because of the loss of people from scurvy and armed conflicts with the Natives.35 For\n\n38 Katerina G. Solovjova and Aleksandra A. Vovnyanko this, the Russian navigator Bocharov was sent to the Shumagin Islands and farther to Unalaska Island. In March Evstratii I. Delarov, peredovshchik of the merchants Panovs Company, visited Kodiak. Shelikhov formed confidential relations with him (Andreev 1948, 182, 238).36 It is possible that at this time they had already agreed upon Delarov’s move to the NEC. Shelikhov sent Bocharov, with several accompanying Koniag in three-hatch baidarki, to Delarov’s possessions on Unga Island in the Shumagin Island group, in order to confer about the possible number of people for transfer from the ship Sv. Aleksei, which was leaving Alaska, to Shelikhov’s company. Shelikhov was hoping that they would sign a contract immediately on the conditions of each obtaining a half share of total procurement. Apparently this deal came to pass on Unga with Delarov’s agreement. Bocharov was ordered “to send [the working people from Unga] in two baidary, fairly well armed” to aid the peredovshchik Maksimov in the Semidi Islands, where one of the first artels of the NEC hunted. Shelikhov also hoped to attract “64 promyshlenniki at 60 rubles each per year” from other companies located not only on Unga, but on Unalaska, where, after Unga, Bocharov went with seven letters addressed to navigators and peredovshchiki of other companies (Andreev 1948, 182, 185). Navigator Bocharov was ordered to hurry in order not to miss the ship Sv. Mikhail in Unalaska, to take command of the crew, and to prepare for a voyage. He had to be on the refitted ship in Unalaska until the 25th of May. Shelikhov, leaving Three Saints Bay on the 22nd of May, counted on finding Bocharov there. However, he also foresaw the possibility of other events; therefore, in paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 of his instructions to Bocharov, Shelikhov included significant additions about the expeditions.37 At Shelikhov’s insistence, the NEC ships constantly went on voyages in search of new islands with sea mammal haulouts. In this connection Shelikhov’s plans were well thought out to the smallest details and were filled with assignments for his employees. He directed Bocharov to not only attract people, but also to procure lavtaki (a skin o"
