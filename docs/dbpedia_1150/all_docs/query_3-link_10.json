Bolkhovitinov, who reached the military rank of Major General, studied at the Zhukovsky Military-Aviation Engineering Academy near Moscow and worked there as a teacher and aircraft designer for most of his career. In the 1930s and 1940s he worked on aircraft design, forming his own design bureau for experimental aircraft called OKB-293. Designs included a large bomber and a rocket-powered interceptor, neither of which entered service.

In this print taken in Moscow, Russia in 1965, Bolkhovitinov is depicted as a distinguished man wearing his military uniform with pride. With an impressive career that spanned decades, he rose to the rank of Major General while leaving an indelible mark on aviation history. Bolkhovitinov's journey began at the renowned Zhukovsky Military-Aviation Engineering Academy near Moscow, where he studied and later became a teacher and aircraft designer. His passion for pushing boundaries led him to establish his own design bureau for experimental aircraft known as OKB-293 during the 1930s and 1940s. Although some of his designs such as a large bomber and rocket-powered interceptor never made it into service, they showcased his innovative thinking and technological prowess. This photograph captures Bolkhovitinov seated at his desk in his office, surrounded by blueprints and models that symbolize his dedication to advancing aviation technology. As one gazes upon this image, it becomes evident that Bolkhovitinov's contributions were not only significant but also instrumental in shaping the future of flight. His expertise extended beyond engineering; he was also an esteemed teacher who nurtured young minds within the field of aviation. Viktor Fedorovich Bolkhovitinov remains an icon in Russian aerospace history—a visionary engineer whose legacy continues to inspire generations of designers even today.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nSAFE SHIPPING\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
