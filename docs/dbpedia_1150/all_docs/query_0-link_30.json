Excluded are aerostats balloons and airships most microlights, hang gliders, unpowered gliders and sailplanes other than large transport gliders, and most replicas and restored aircraft (though scaled replicas\n\nis modification of existing whatever reason, and on a completely unquantifiable basis have included those that seemed sufficiently important. At one extreme you have entries like Aero Spacelines and Satie; at the other are people who dope a length of cord along an aileron and hardly qualify. We in the West are familiar with the notion of an ‘aircraft company’, but not with how they used to do things in the former Soviet Union (called USSR here). Except for light aircraft, every design was carried out by an OKB (experimental construction bureau) which invariably also built and tested the prototype(s). The head of the bureau, usually with the rank (and uniform) of General Constructor, was often famous and entries appear under their names. They invariably had little say regarding which GAZ (state aircraft factory) would be chosen for series production, and the factories are not included. But today every factory manager is an aggressive capitalist, private factory companies are appearing almost daily, and the problems of the ex-USSR chron-\n\nmade\n\nicler\n\ncraft'.\n\nfrom the\n\nto failure\n\nstart.\n\nNo\n\nsooner\n\nis\n\nwill this hefty\n\nhit the streets than someone will remind me of something I have omitted. I would like to think the omissions will be obscure. If I have left out any obvious name, I apologize. In any case, long as it is, this listing is merely the important centre of a grey area round the edges populated by many thousands of enthusiasts around the world. Once\n\ntome\n\nthere was no aircraft industry, just enthusiasts. Today have included many hundreds of people I\n\nwho, often working\n\nin a backyard or, like V.B. Shavrov, in their tiny apartment, have created worthwhile flying machines.\n\nWhat I\n\nhave\n\naircraft? listed\n\nrotorcraft\n\nin\n\nproducers\n\n—\n\n— manned,\n\nquantity for sale or as homebuilts are\n\nIn a few cases the product\n\nwas\n\nin).\n\na single aircraft\n\nwhich failed to fly but which was sufficiently famous to merit inclusion.

Some lexicographers say you must group organizations known by a set of initials in front of those having names, but this is often difficult. Where would you put Socata,\n\nWORLD ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS which is really the acronym SOCATA but written and spoken as a word? And there are many other problems. Dudley Watt was always referred to thus, never as Watt. Dudley, so he goes under D. So also does de Havilland, along with other ‘de’ prefixes. But in general personal names go by the surname. Thus Louis Breguet goes under B. because that is where the reader would look; but Max Holste and Max Plan were always referred to with forename included so they go under\n\nM\n\n.\n\nWhereas Edgar\n\nPercival’s\n\nfirst\n\ncompany natur-\n\nappears under P, his second, Edgar Percival under E. But where would you put V-8?

Modern groups may be formed by an (Memorandum of Understanding), leading\n\nMoU\n\nto a GIE (Groupement d’lnteret Economique), an association of different companies with a common interest where each member assumes\n\nresponsibility for\n\nall.\n\nIn\n\nmany\n\ncases the\n\nsame\n\ngroup or factory may be organized into a succession of different companies. For example, the team at Hatfield, England, was formed as de\n\nbecome Hawker\n\nHavilland, forced to\n\nSiddeley,\n\nand nationalized into British Aerospace, which was then privatized and is now pulling out nothing but a strangely positivethinking firm called Corporate Jets.

On the other hand, some small acorns grew into so many oaks that we could really do with a family tree; try Bellanca, Enstrom, Fokker and Meridionali. Another problem is posed by the mass of companies prefixed by ‘Societe'. Most were known by their initials, such as SNCASE. Where a proper name occurs, such as Societe\n\nenterprise\n\n(Vought\n\nis\n\nLatham, look under that name\n\nin that case,\n\n(i.e.\n\nL, not S).\n\nWhere\n\nlocated?\n\nEvery entry has\n\nits\n\nnationality\n\nshown\n\nin brackets.\n\nCountry names include Russia, USSR (1919-91) and the names of various ex-USSR republics; Germany (pre-1945 and post- 1990) and E. and W.

Sometimes, especially with very small organizations, my lack of knowledge forced me to use vague words such as ‘produced’. I apologize if this is occasionally misleading. For example, often the man whose name is linked with the product may have done nothing but put up the money; or he may have designed it but had no share in the construction; or he may have been the customer. Of course I hope many people will find this effort useful, and perhaps even entertaining. 1 can leave it to readers to image the toil, agony, ecstasy, heartbreak and argument that lies behind every single line of dispassionate type. One of my favourite quotes is by Sir George Edwards, who, on his very first day at the factory, ‘saw an enormous man stripped to the waist (whom I subsequently found out was the Works Manager) with a very large hammer breaking up what looked to me to be an absolutely new Viastra transport ... It was dawning upon me that this was no ordinary industry that I had strayed into, and must say that nothing has happened since to make me change my view’. Time and again we read of how a good aeroplane can survive the I\n\ndemise of the company who created it, often being built by successive groups anxious to preserve the famous contrast,\n\nname\n\nfamous names\n\n(see Taylorcraft).

For example, of the impressive\n\nof 294 for the UK, doubt if 20 are in existence today, and that includes homebuilts. If it were possible to relate the totals to timescales it would show the rapid proliferation of planemaking around the world; whereas in Britain the trend for 35 years has been sharply downwards, many countries recognize that making aircraft is a very good business to be in, if you have good management and strong nerves.
