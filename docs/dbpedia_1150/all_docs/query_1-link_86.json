I built this boat during 2003/2004 year. The designer is Tracy O'brien from Chehalis, Washington. The Dory is 16' long and is built using the \"stich-n-glue\" epoxy construction method. The boat was made using marine plywood, system 3 epoxy and fiberglass. The top rails are a mix of mahogany and oak. I just put a fresh coat of paint inside and out and re-varnished the top side this last year. I built her with use in mind....the bottom is 3/4 thick with 24oz. of fiberglass and a graphite epoxy mix makeing the bottom extra tough. The transom is rated up to 50hp. I originally had a 40hp motor but, was WAY to much power. That being said the 15hp. won't quite plane her now, but a prop. change may just do the trick although a 25hp motor would be perfect. The reason i'm selling her is i just don't use her! She sits in the shop and never goes out. The decision's finally been made that i'd much rather see her being used than sitting in my shop collecting dust. I have a lot more information if anyone is interested. As for the price, i'd like to start at $3800 o.b.o.\n\nThanks for looking.\n\nAttachments\n\ndory1.jpg\n\ndory2.jpg\n\ndory 4.jpg\n\ndory 6.jpg\n\ndory 7.jpg\n\ndory 9.jpg\n\ndory 10.jpg\n\nUpvote 0\n\n“biteme”\n\nBoilin dinos\n\nOct 6, 2009\n\n9,160\n\n1,633\n\nBellingham\n\nName\n\nBrian B\n\nBoat Name\n\n26 osprey\n\nFeb 9, 2014\n\n#2\n\nI have fished kokanee off of this.
