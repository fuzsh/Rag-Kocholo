        "text": "A new RF window designed for high-power operation in an S-band LINAC RF system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJoo, Youngdo; Kim, Seung-Hwan; Hwang, Woonha; Ryu, Jiwan; Roh, Sungjoo\n\n2016-09-01\n\nA new RF window is designed for high-power operation at the Pohang Light Source-II (PLSII) S-band linear accelerator (LINAC) RF system. In order to reduce the strength of the electric field component perpendicular to the ceramic disk, which is commonly known as the main cause of most discharge breakdowns in ceramic disk, we replace the pill-box type cavity in the conventional RF window with an overmoded cavity. The overmoded cavity is coupled with input and output waveguides through dual side-wall coupling irises to reduce the electric field strength at the iris and the number of possible mode competitions. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation, CST MWS, was used in the design process. The simulated maximum electric field component perpendicular to the ceramic for the new RF window is reduced by an order of magnitude compared with taht for the conventional RF window, which holds promise for stable high-power operation.\n\nDevelopment of new S-band RF window for stable high-power operation in linear accelerator RF system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJoo, Youngdo; Lee, Byung-Joon; Kim, Seung-Hwan; Kong, Hyung-Sup; Hwang, Woonha; Roh, Sungjoo; Ryu, Jiwan\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFor stable high-power operation, a new RF window is developed in the S-band linear accelerator (Linac) RF systems of the Pohang Light Source-II (PLS-II) and the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free-Electron Laser (PAL-XFEL). The new RF window is designed to mitigate the strength of the electric field at the ceramic disk and also at the waveguide-cavity coupling structure of the conventional RF window. By replacing the pill-box type cavity in the conventional RF window with an overmoded cavity, the electric field component perpendicular to the ceramic disk that caused most of the multipacting breakdowns in the ceramic disk was reduced by an order of magnitude. The reduced electric field at the ceramic disk eliminated the Ti-N coating process on the ceramic surface in the fabrication procedure of the new RF window, preventing the incomplete coating from spoiling the RF transmission and lowering the fabrication cost. The overmoded cavity was coupled with input and output waveguides through dual side-wall coupling irises to reduce the electric field strength at the waveguide-cavity coupling structure and the possibility of mode competitions in the overmoded cavity. A prototype of the new RF window was fabricated and fully tested with the Klystron peak input power, pulse duration and pulse repetition rate of 75 MW, 4.5 Î¼s and 10 Hz, respectively, at the high-power test stand. The first mass-produced new RF window installed in the PLS-II Linac is running in normal operation mode. No fault is reported to date. Plans are being made to install the new RF window to all S-band accelerator RF modules of the PLS-II and PAL-XFEL Linacs. This new RF window may be applied to the output windows of S-band power sources like Klystron as wells as the waveguide windows of accelerator facilities which operate in S-band.\n\nDesign and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHillairet, J.; Achard, J.; Bae, Y. S.; Bernard, J. M.; Dechambre, N.; Delpech, L.; Ekedahl, A.; Faure, N.; Goniche, M.; Kim, J.; Larroque, S.; Magne, R.; Marfisi, L.; Namkung, W.; Park, H.; Park, S.; Poli, S.; Vulliez, K.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nCEA/IRFM is conducting R&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the 5 GHz ITER LHCD system, which is expected to transmit 20 MW of RF power to the plasma. Two 5 GHz 500 kW BeO pill-box type window prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company, in close collaboration with CEA/IRFM. Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported.\n\nHigh power RF window deposition apparatus, method, and device\n\nDOEpatents\n\nIves, Lawrence R.; Lucovsky, Gerald; Zeller, Daniel\n\n2017-07-04\n\nA process for forming a coating for an RF window which has improved secondary electron emission and reduced multipactor for high power RF waveguides is formed from a substrate with low loss tangent and desirable mechanical characteristics. The substrate has an RPAO deposition layer applied which oxygenates the surface of the substrate to remove carbon impurities, thereafter has an RPAN deposition layer applied to nitrogen activate the surface of the substrate, after which a TiN deposition layer is applied using Titanium tert-butoxide. The TiN deposition layer is capped with a final RPAN deposition layer of nitridation to reduce the bound oxygen in the TiN deposition layer. The resulting RF window has greatly improved titanium layer adhesion, reduced multipactor, and is able to withstand greater RF power levels than provided by the prior art.\n\nInvestigation and Prediction of RF Window Performance in APT Accelerators\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHumphries, S. Jr.\n\n1997-05-01\n\nThe work described in this report was performed between November 1996 and May 1997 in support of the APT (Accelerator Production of Tritium) Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The goal was to write and to test computer programs for charged particle orbits in RF fields. The well-documented programs were written in portable form and compiled for standard personal computers for easy distribution to LANL researchers. They will be used in several APT applications including the following. Minimization of multipactor effects in the moderate {beta} superconducting linac cavities under design for the APT accelerator. Investigation of suppression techniques for electronmoreÂ Â» multipactoring in high-power RF feedthroughs. Modeling of the response of electron detectors for the protection of high power RF vacuum windows. In the contract period two new codes, Trak{_}RF and WaveSim, were completed and several critical benchmark etests were carried out. Trak{_}RF numerically tracks charged particle orbits in combined electrostatic, magnetostatic and electromagnetic fields. WaveSim determines frequency-domain RF field solutions and provides a key input to Trak{_}RF. The two-dimensional programs handle planar or cylindrical geometries. They have several unique characteristics.Â«Â less\n\nHigh voltage breakdown phenomena in RF window, electron gun and RF cavities in 250 kW CW C band Klystron and their preventive measures\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLamba, O.S.; Badola, Richa; Baloda, Suman\n\nThe paper describes voltage break down phenomenon and preventive measures in components of 250 KW CW, C band Klystron under development at CEERI Pilani. The Klystron operates at a beam voltage of 50 kV and delivers 250 kW RF power at 5 GHz frequency. The Klystron consists of several key components and regions, which are subject to high electrical stress. The most important regions of electrical breakdown are electron gun, the RF ceramic window and output cavity gap area. In the critical components voltage breakdown considered at design stage by proper gap and other techniques. All these problems discussed, asmoreÂ Â» well as solution to alleviate this problem. The electron gun consists basically of cathode, BFE and anode. The cathode is operated at a voltage of 50 kV.

This technology is mainly used in production lines and is called RIM for polyurethane reaction injection moulding. This technology, however brings about some problems such as: glass breaking during mould closure, high production cost, systematic rough edges. The PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen), a pioneer in this field, in collaboration with SAIREM has launched a new innovating process for window encapsulation by using the 50 {Omega} RF technology for gelling PVC Plastisol. The study was followed by an industrial prototype. Industrial equipment was then installed at WEBASTOmoreÂ Â» HEULIEZ for window encapsulation of the sunshine roof for the Citroen Xantia. The authors describe the principle of window encapsulation and the different existing processes. They describe the 50 {Omega} RF technology, an industrial installation and the constraints of this technology in order to get maximum efficiency. In the conclusion they present a technical and economical analysis of the different solutions for window encapsulation.

High power performance tests of the single RF window were conducted at PAL to verify the operational characteristics for its application in the Pohang Light Source-II (PLS-II) linear accelerator (Linac). The tests were performed in the in-situ facility consisting of a modulator, klystron, waveguide network, vacuum system, cooling system, and RF analyzing equipment. The test results with Stanford linear accelerator energy doubler (SLED) have shown no breakdown up to 75 MW peak power with 4.5 Î¼s RF pulse width at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The test results with the current operation level of PLS-II Linac confirm that the RF window well satisfies the criteria for PLS-II Linac operation.\n\nThin CVD-diamond RF Pill-Box vacuum windows for LHCD systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRavera, G. L.; Ceccuzzi, S.; Cardinali, A.; Cesario, R.; Mirizzi, F.; Schettini, G.; Tuccillo, A. A.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe preliminary assessment of a Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system for the DEMOnstration power plant (DEMO) is mainly focused on the R&D needs of the less conventional RF components of the Main Transmission Line (MTL) and of the launcher. 500 kW, CW klystrons will be used to deliver the RF power to independent Passive Active Multijunction (PAM) launcher modules at 5 GHz. This paper describes the criteria followed to investigate the optimum solution for the RF window used as vacuum barrier between the MTL and the launcher, an open issue in the LHCD system for ITER too. The best candidate, capable of withstanding a power level of, or above, 0.5 MW in CW operation and to satisfy the electrical and thermonuclear requirements, is a Pill-Box assembly, based on a thin single disk of CVD-diamond as dielectric, water cooled at the edge. A thickness of 3 mm, much shorter than half a wavelength of the TEÂ°11 mode in the dielectric as in the conventional window (unfeasible and too expensive with CVD-diamond at these frequencies), is sufficient to limit the exerted stress at the edge under the fracture stress for a maximum pressure applied of 0.9 MPa. In this paper the simulation results of conventional and thin CVD-diamond vacuum windows are presented comparing S-parameters, losses and electric fields in both matching condition and with VSWR = 2, using WR284 and WR229 as input/output rectangular waveguide.\n\nOverview of High Power Vacuum Dry RF Load Designs\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKrasnykh, Anatoly\n\n2015-08-27\n\nA specific feature of RF linacs based on the pulsed traveling wave (TW) mode of operation is that only a portion of the RF energy is used for the beam acceleration. The residual RF energy has to be terminated into an RF load. Higher accelerating gradients require higher RF sources and RF loads, which can stably terminate the residual RF power. RF feeders (from the RF source though the accelerating section to the load) are vacuumed to transmit multi-megawatt high power RF. This overview will outline vacuumed RF loads only. A common method to terminate multi-MW RF power is tomoreÂ Â» use circulated water (or other liquid) as an absorbing medium. A solid dielectric interface (a high quality ceramic) is required to separate vacuum and liquid RF absorber mediums. Using such RF load approaches in TW linacs is troubling because there is a fragile ceramic window barrier and a failure could become catastrophic for linac vacuum and RF systems. Traditional loads comprising of a ceramic disk have limited peak and average power handling capability and are therefore not suitable for high gradient TW linacs. This overview will focus on ''vacuum dry'' or ''all-metal'' loads that do not employ any dielectric interface between vacuum and absorber. The first prototype is an original design of RF loads for the Stanford Two-Mile Accelerator.Â«Â less\n\nDesign Guidance for New Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nDesign Guidance for Replacement Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nDesign Considerations | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nHigh-Power X-Band Semiconductor RF Switch for Pulse Compression Systems of Future Colliders\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTantawi, Sami G.; Tamura, Fumihiko\n\n2000-04-01\n\nWe describe the potential of semiconductor X-band RF switch arrays as a means of developing high power RF pulse compression systems for future linear colliders. The switch systems described here have two designs. Both designs consist of two 3dB hybrids and active modules. In the first design the module is composed of a cascaded active phase shifter. In the second design the module uses arrays of SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) switches. Each cascaded element of the phase shifter and the SPST switch has similar design. The active element consists of symmetrical three-port tee-junctions and an active waveguide window in the symmetrical arm of the tee-junction. The design methodology of the elements and the architecture of the whole switch system are presented. We describe the scaling law that governs the relation between power handling capability and number of elements. The design of the active waveguide window is presented. The waveguide window is a silicon wafer with an array of four hundred PIN/NIP diodes covering the surface of the window. This waveguide window is located in an over-moded TE01 circular waveguide. The results of high power RF measurements of the active waveguide window are presented. The experiment is performed at power levels of tens of megawatts at X-band.\n\nDesign and Calibration of an RF Actuator for Low-Level RF Systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGeng, Zheqiao; Hong, Bo\n\n2016-02-01\n\nX-ray free electron laser (FEL) machines like the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC require high-quality electron beams to generate X-ray lasers for various experiments. Digital low-level RF (LLRF) systems are widely used to control the high-power RF klystrons to provide a highly stable RF field in accelerator structures for beam acceleration. Feedback and feedforward controllers are implemented in LLRF systems to stabilize or adjust the phase and amplitude of the RF field. To achieve the RF stability and the accuracy of the phase and amplitude adjustment, low-noise and highly linear RF actuators are required. Aiming for the upgrade of the S-band Linac at SLAC, an RF actuator is designed with an I/Qmodulator driven by two digital-to-analog converters (DAC) for the digital LLRF systems. A direct upconversion scheme is selected for RF actuation, and an on-line calibration algorithm is developed to compensate the RF reference leakage and the imbalance errors in the I/Q modulator, which may cause significant phase and amplitude actuation errors. This paper presents the requirements on the RF actuator, the design of the hardware, the calibration algorithm, and the implementation in firmware and software and the test results at LCLS.\n\nHigh-Temperature Optical Window Design\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRoeloffs, Norman; Taranto, Nick\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA high-temperature optical window is essential to the optical diagnostics of high-temperature combustion rigs. Laser Doppler velocimetry, schlieren photography, light sheet visualization, and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy are a few of the tests that require optically clear access to the combustor flow stream. A design was developed for a high-temperature window that could withstand the severe environment of the NASA Lewis 3200 F Lean Premixed Prevaporized (LPP) Flame Tube Test Rig. The development of this design was both time consuming and costly. This report documents the design process and the lessons learned, in an effort to reduce the cost of developing future designs for high-temperature optical windows.\n\nACCELERATORS: RF system design and measurement of HIRF-CSRe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Zhe; Zhao, Hong-Wei; Wang, Chun-Xiao; Xia, Jia-Wen; Zhan, Wen-Long; Bian, Zhi-Bin\n\n2009-05-01\n\nAn RF system for the CSRe (cooling storage experimental ring) is designed and manufactured domestically. The present paper mainly describes the RF system design in five main sections: ferrite ring, RF cavity, RF generator, low level system and cavity cooling. The cavity is based on a type of coaxial resonator which is shorted at the end with one gap and loaded with domestic ferrite rings. The RF generator is designed in the push-pull mode and the low level control system is based on a DSP+FGPA+DDS+USB interface and has three feedback loops. Finally we give the results of the measurement on our system.\n\nParallel transmission RF pulse design with strict temperature constraints.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeniz, Cem M; Carluccio, Giuseppe; Collins, Christopher\n\n2017-05-01\n\nRF safety in parallel transmission (pTx) is generally ensured by imposing specific absorption rate (SAR) limits during pTx RF pulse design. There is increasing interest in using temperature to ensure safety in MRI. In this work, we present a local temperature correlation matrix formalism and apply it to impose strict constraints on maximum absolute temperature in pTx RF pulse design for head and hip regions. Electromagnetic field simulations were performed on the head and hip of virtual body models. Temperature correlation matrices were calculated for four different exposure durations ranging between 6 and 24Â min using simulated fields and body-specific constants. Parallel transmission RF pulses were designed using either SAR or temperature constraints, and compared with each other and unconstrained RF pulse design in terms of excitation fidelity and safety. The use of temperature correlation matrices resulted in better excitation fidelity compared with the use of SAR in parallel transmission RF pulse design (for the 6Â min exposure period, 8.8% versus 21.0% for the head and 28.0% versus 32.2% for the hip region). As RF exposure duration increases (from 6Â min to 24Â min), the benefit of using temperature correlation matrices on RF pulse design diminishes. However, the safety of the subject is always guaranteed (the maximum temperature was equal to 39Â°C). This trend was observed in both head and hip regions, where the perfusion rates are very different.

DTL is cylindrical RF cavity resonating in TM010 mode at 352.21 MHz frequency. It consists of array of drift tubes arranged ensuring that DTL centre and Drift Tube centre are concentric. The Drift Tubes also houses Permanent Magnet Quadrupole for transverse focusing of proton beam. A twelve cell prototype of DTL section is designed, developed and fabricated at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay. Complete DTL accelerator consists of eight such DTL sections. High frequency microwave simulationsmoreÂ Â» are carried out in SOPRANO, vector fields and COMSOL simulation software. This prototype DTL is 1640.56 mm long cavity with 520 mm ID, 600 mm OD and consists of eleven Drift Tubes, two RF end flanges, three slug tuners, six post couplers, three RF field monitors, one RF waveguide coupler, two DN100 vacuum flanges and DTL tank platform with alignment features.

This paper discusses design of this RF vacuum cavity operating at high accelerating field gradient in ultra-high vacuum. Detailed vacuum design and results of RF and vacuum qualifications are discussed. Results on mechanical accuracy achieved on scaled pre-prototype are also presented. Paper summarizes the engineering developments carried out for this RF cavity and brings out the future activities proposed in indigenous development of high gradient RF cavities for ion accelerators.

Standard design space windowing (DSW) uses a region of interest by setting a requirement on response level and checks it by a global RS predictions over the design space. This approach, however, is vulnerable since RS modeling errors may lead to the wrong region to zoom on. The approach is modified by introducing an eigenvalue error measure based on point-to-point mean squared error criterion. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the benefit of the error-based DSW.\n\nRF-driven ion source with a back-streaming electron dump\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKwan, Joe; Ji, Qing\n\nA novel ion source is described having an improved lifetime. The ion source, in one embodiment, is a proton source, including an external RF antenna mounted to an RF window. To prevent backstreaming electrons formed in the beam column from striking the RF window, a back streaming electron dump is provided, which in one embodiment is formed of a cylindrical tube, open at one end to the ion source chamber and capped at its other end by a metal plug. The plug, maintained at the same electrical potential as the source, captures these backstreaming electrons, and thus prevents localized heatingmoreÂ Â» of the window, which due to said heating, might otherwise cause window damage.Â«Â less\n\nDesign of the beryllium window for Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNayak, S.; Mapes, M.; Raparia, D.\n\n2015-11-01\n\nIn the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) beam line, there were two Beryllium (Be) windows with an air gap to separate the high vacuum upstream side from low vacuum downstream side. There had been frequent window failures in the past which affected the machine productivity and increased the radiation dose received by workers due to unplanned maintenance. To improve the window life, design of Be window is reexamined. Detailed structural and thermal simulations are carried out on Be window for different design parameters and loading conditions to come up with better design to improve the window life. The new designmoreÂ Â» removed the air gap and connect the both beam lines with a Be window in-between. The new design has multiple advantages such as 1) reduces the beam energy loss (because of one window with no air gap), 2) reduces air activation due to nuclear radiation and 3) increased the machine reliability as there is no direct pressure load during operation. For quick replacement of this window, an aluminum bellow coupled with load binder was designed. There hasnât been a single window failure since the new design was implemented in 2012.Â«Â less\n\nRF control at SSCL â an object oriented design approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDohan, D. A.; Osberg, E.; Biggs, R.; Bossom, J.; Chillara, K.; Richter, R.; Wade, D.\n\n1994-12-01\n\nThe Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in Texas, the construction of which was stopped in 1994, would have represented a major challenge in accelerator research and development. This paper addresses the issues encountered in the parallel design and construction of the control systems for the RF equipment for the five accelerators comprising the SSC. An extensive analysis of the components of the RF control systems has been undertaken, based upon the Schlaer-Mellor object-oriented analysis and design (OOA/OOD) methodology. The RF subsystem components such as amplifiers, tubes, power supplies, PID loops, etc. were analyzed to produce OOA information, behavior and process models. Using these models, OOD was iteratively applied to develop a generic RF control system design. This paper describes the results of this analysis and the development of 'bridges' between the analysis objects, and the EPICS-based software and underlying VME-based hardware architectures. The application of this approach to several of the SSCL RF control systems is discussed.\n\nDesign of RF MEMS switches without pull-in instability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nProctor, W. Cyrus; Richards, Gregory P.; Shen, Chongyi; Skorczewski, Tyler; Wang, Min; Zhang, Jingyan; Zhong, Peng; Massad, Jordan E.; Smith, Ralph\n\n2010-04-01\n\nMicro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) switches for radio-frequency (RF) signals have certain advantages over solid-state switches, such as lower insertion loss, higher isolation, and lower static power dissipation. Mechanical dynamics can be a determining factor for the reliability of RF MEMS. The RF MEMS ohmic switch discussed in this paper consists of a plate suspended over an actuation pad by four double-cantilever springs. Closing the switch with a simple step actuation voltage typically causes the plate to rebound from its electrical contacts. The rebound interrupts the signal continuity and degrades the performance, reliability and durability of the switch. The switching dynamics are complicated by a nonlinear, electrostatic pull-in instability that causes high accelerations. Slow actuation and tailored voltage control signals can mitigate switch bouncing and effects of the pull-in instability; however, slow switching speed and overly-complex input signals can significantly penalize overall system-level performance. Examination of a balanced and optimized alternative switching solution is sought. A step toward one solution is to consider a pull-in-free switch design. In this paper, determine how simple RC-circuit drive signals and particular structural properties influence the mechanical dynamics of an RF MEMS switch designed without a pull-in instability. The approach is to develop a validated modeling capability and subsequently study switch behavior for variable drive signals and switch design parameters. In support of project development, specifiable design parameters and constraints will be provided. Moreover, transient data of RF MEMS switches from laser Doppler velocimetry will be provided for model validation tasks. Analysis showed that a RF MEMS switch could feasibly be designed with a single pulse waveform and no pull-in instability and achieve comparable results to previous waveform designs. The switch design could reliably close in a timely\n\nRF Pulse Design using Nonlinear Gradient Magnetic Fields\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKopanoglu, Emre; Constable, R. Todd\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose An iterative k-space trajectory and radio-frequency (RF) pulse design method is proposed for Excitation using Nonlinear Gradient Magnetic fields (ENiGMa). Theory and Methods The spatial encoding functions (SEFs) generated by nonlinear gradient fields (NLGFs) are linearly dependent in Cartesian-coordinates. Left uncorrected, this may lead to flip-angle variations in excitation profiles. In the proposed method, SEFs (k-space samples) are selected using a Matching-Pursuit algorithm, and the RF pulse is designed using a Conjugate-Gradient algorithm. Three variants of the proposed approach are given: the full-algorithm, a computationally-cheaper version, and a third version for designing spoke-based trajectories. The method is demonstrated for various target excitation profiles using simulations and phantom experiments. Results The method is compared to other iterative (Matching-Pursuit and Conjugate Gradient) and non-iterative (coordinate-transformation and Jacobian-based) pulse design methods as well as uniform density spiral and EPI trajectories. The results show that the proposed method can increase excitation fidelity significantly. Conclusion An iterative method for designing k-space trajectories and RF pulses using nonlinear gradient fields is proposed. The method can either be used for selecting the SEFs individually to guide trajectory design, or can be adapted to design and optimize specific trajectories of interest.

This review provides a summ ary of radio frequency (RF) power harvesting technologies in order to serve as a guide for the design of RF energy harvesting units. Since energy harvesting circuits are designed to operate with relatively small voltages and currents, they rely on state-of-the-art electrical technology for obtaining high efficiency. Thus, comprehensive analysis and discussions of various designs and their tradeoffs are included. Finally, recent applications of RF power harvesting are outlined.\n\nUnderstanding Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nDesign and manufacture of the RF power supply and RF transmission line for SANAEM project Prometheus\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTuremen, G.; Ogur, S.; Ahiska, F.; Yasatekin, B.; Cicek, E.; Ozbey, A.; Kilic, I.; Unel, G.; Alacakir, A.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nA 1-5 MeV proton beamline is being built by the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority in collaboration with a number of graduate students from different universities.

The helicon source is of a type comprising Pyrex and stainless steel cylindrical sections, joined to an ultrahigh vacuum chamber. A radio frequency (RF) helical antenna surrounds the Pyrex chamber, as well as DC solenoidal magnetic field coils. This presentation focuses on the design of the RF helical antenna and RF matching network, such that helicon wave power is coupled to argon plasma with minimal reflected power to the RF amplifier. The amplifier output is selectable between 2-30 MHz, with forward c.w. power up to 1.5 kW. Details and computer simulation of the antenna geometry, materials, and power matching will be presented, as well as the matching network of RF transmission line, tuning capacitors, and cooling system. An initial computational study of power coupling to the plasma will also be described.

This gun, referred to as the LCLS gun, is a modified version of the UCLA/BNL/SLAC 1.6 cell S-Band RF gun [1], referred to as the prototype gun. The changes include a larger mode separation (15 MHz for the LCLS gun vs. 3.5 MHz for the prototype gun), a larger radius at the iris between the 2 cells, a reduced surface field on the curvature of the iris between the two cells, Z power coupling, increased cooling channels for operation at 120 Hz, dual rf feed, deformation tuning of the full cell,moreÂ Â» and field probes in both cells. Temporal shaping of the klystron pulse, to reduce the average power dissipated in the gun, has also been adopted. By increasing the mode separation, the amplitude of the 0-mode electric field on the cathode decreases from 10% of the peak on axis field for the prototype gun to less than 3% for the LCLS gun for the steady state fields. Beam performance is improved as shown by the PARMELA simulations. The gun should be designed to accept a future load lock system. Modifications follow the recommendations of our RF review committee [2].

This study is to explore the possibilities of RF MEMS switch design and optimization with aluminium nitride (AlN) thin film as the piezoelectric actuation material. Achieving low actuation voltage and high contact force with optimal geometry using the principle of piezoelectric effect is the main motivation for this research. Analytical and numerical modelling of single beam type RF MEMS switch used to analyse the design parameters and optimize them for the minimum actuation voltage and high contact force. An analytical model using isotropic AlN material properties used to obtain the optimal parameters. The optimized geometry of the device length, width and thickness are 2000 Âµm, 500 Âµm and 0.6 Âµm respectively obtained for the single beam RF MEMS switch. Low actuation voltage and high contact force with optimal geometry are less than 2 Vand 100 ÂµN obtained by analytical analysis.

The design of this SRF cavity is for the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC). The electron ring of JLEIC will operate with electrons of 3 to 10 GeV energy. The ion ring of JLEIC will operate with protons of up to 100 GeV energy. The bunch lengths in both rings are ~12 mm (RMS). In order to maintain the short bunch length in the ion ring, SRF cavities are adopted to provide large enough gradient. In the firstmoreÂ Â» phase of JLEIC, the PEP II RF cavities will be reused in the electron ring to lower the initial cost. The frequency of the SRF cavities is chosen to be the second harmonic of PEP II cavities, 952.6 MHz. In the second phase of JLEIC, the same frequency SRF cavities may replace the normal conducting PEP II cavities to achieve higher luminosity at high energy. At low energies, the synchro-tron radiation damping effect is quite weak, to avoid the coupled bunch instability caused by the intense closely-spaced electron bunches, low HOM impedance of the SRF cavities combined with longitudinal feedback sys-tem will be necessary.Â«Â less\n\nBenefits of Efficient Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nWindows for New Construction | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nPerformance Standards for Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nAssessing Window Replacement Options | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nRF window assembly comprising a ceramic disk disposed within a cylindrical waveguide which is connected to rectangular waveguides through elliptical joints\n\nDOEpatents\n\nTantawi, Sami G.; Dolgashev, Valery A.; Yeremian, Anahid D.\n\n2016-03-15\n\nA high-power microwave RF window is provided that includes a cylindrical waveguide, where the cylindrical waveguide includes a ceramic disk concentrically housed in a central region of the cylindrical waveguide, a first rectangular waveguide, where the first rectangular waveguide is connected by a first elliptical joint to a proximal end of the cylindrical waveguide, and a second rectangular waveguide, where the second rectangular waveguide is connected by a second elliptical joint to a distal end of the cylindrical waveguide.\n\nWindow Design Strategies to Conserve Energy.

Since there will be a large number of different operations involving manned and unmanned vehicles, single- and multiperson crews, automated and manually controlled flight, a wide variety of cargo, and construction/repair activities, accurate and continuous human monitoring of these operations from a specially designed control station on Space Station will be required. Total situational awareness will be required. This paper presents numerous human factors design guidelines and related background information for control windows which will support proximity operations. Separate sections deal with natural and artificial illumination geometry; all basic rendezvous vector approaches; window field-of-view requirements; window size; shape and placement criteria; window optical characteristics as they relate to human perception; maintenance and protection issues; and a comprehensive review of windows installed on U.S. and U.S.S.R. manned vehicles.\n\nDesign and Verification of Critical Pressurised Windows for Manned Spaceflight\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLamoure, Richard; Busto, Lara; Novo, Francisco; Sinnema, Gerben; Leal, Mendes M.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe Window Design for Manned Spaceflight (WDMS) project was tasked with establishing the state-of-art and explore possible improvements to the current structural integrity verification and fracture control methodologies for manned spacecraft windows.A critical review of the state-of-art in spacecraft window design, materials and verification practice was conducted. Shortcomings of the methodology in terms of analysis, inspection and testing were identified. Schemes for improving verification practices and reducing conservatism whilst maintaining the required safety levels were then proposed.An experimental materials characterisation programme was defined and carried out with the support of the 'Glass and FaÃ§ade Technology Research Group', at the University of Cambridge. Results of the sample testing campaign were analysed, post-processed and subsequently applied to the design of a breadboard window demonstrator.Two Fused Silica glass window panes were procured and subjected to dedicated analyses, inspection and testing comprising both qualification and acceptance programmes specifically tailored to the objectives of the activity.Finally, main outcomes have been compiled into a Structural Verification Guide for Pressurised Windows in manned spacecraft, incorporating best practices and lessons learned throughout this project.\n\nSelection Process for New Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nSelection Process for Replacement Windows | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nOptimizing RF gun cavity geometry within an automated injector design system\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAlicia Hofler ,Pavel Evtushenko\n\n2011-03-28\n\nRF guns play an integral role in the success of several light sources around the world, and properly designed and optimized cw superconducting RF (SRF) guns can provide a path to higher average brightness. As the need for these guns grows, it is important to have automated optimization software tools that vary the geometry of the gun cavity as part of the injector design process. This will allow designers to improve existing designs for present installations, extend the utility of these guns to other applications, and develop new designs. An evolutionary algorithm (EA) based system can provide this capability becausemoreÂ Â» EAs can search in parallel a large parameter space (often non-linear) and in a relatively short time identify promising regions of the space for more careful consideration. The injector designer can then evaluate more cavity design parameters during the injector optimization process against the beam performance requirements of the injector. This paper will describe an extension to the APISA software that allows the cavity geometry to be modified as part of the injector optimization and provide examples of its application to existing RF and SRF gun designs.Â«Â less\n\nArcjet exploratory tests of ARC optical window design for the AFE vehicle\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWhiting, Ellis E.; Terrazas-Salinas, Imelda; Craig, Roger A.; Sobeck, Charles K.; Sarver, George L., III; Salerno, Louis J.; Love, Wendell; Maa, Scott; Covington, AL\n\n1991-01-01\n\nTests were made in the 20 MW arc jet facility at the NASA ARC to determine the suitability of sapphire and fused silica as window materials for the Aeroassist Flight Experiment (AFE) entry vehicle. Twenty nine tests were made; 25 at a heating rate about 80 percent of that expected during the AFE entry and 4 at approximately the full, 100 percent AFE heating rate profile, that produces a temperature of about 2900 F on the surface of the tiles that protect the vehicle. These tests show that a conductively cooled window design using mechanical thermal contacts and sapphire is probably not practical. Cooling the window using mechanical thermal contacts produces thermal stresses in the sapphire that cause the window to crack. An insulated design using sapphire, that cools the window as little as possible, appears promising although some spectral data in the vacuum-ultra-violet (VUV) will be lost due to the high temperature reached by the sapphire. The surface of the insulated sapphire windows, tested at the 100 percent AFE heating rate, showed some slight ablation, and cracks appeared in two of three test windows. One small group of cracks were obviously caused by mechanical binding of the window in the assembly, which can be eliminated with improved design. Other cracks were long, straight, thin crystallographic cracks that have very little effect on the optical transmission of the window. Also, the windows did not fall apart along these crystallographic cracks when the windows were removed from their assemblies. Theoretical results from the thermal analysis computer program SINDA indicate that increasing the window thickness from 4 to 8 mm may enable surface ablation to be avoided. An insulated design using a fused silica window tested at the nominal AFE heating rate experienced severe ablation, thus fused silica is not considered to be an acceptable window material.\n\nDesign and comparison of laser windows for high-power lasers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNiu, Yanxiong; Liu, Wenwen; Liu, Haixia; Wang, Caili; Niu, Haisha; Man, Da\n\n2014-11-01\n\nHigh-power laser systems are getting more and more widely used in industry and military affairs. It is necessary to develop a high-power laser system which can operate over long periods of time without appreciable degradation in performance. When a high-energy laser beam transmits through a laser window, it is possible that the permanent damage is caused to the window because of the energy absorption by window materials. So, when we design a high-power laser system, a suitable laser window material must be selected and the laser damage threshold of the window must be known. In this paper, a thermal analysis model of high-power laser window is established, and the relationship between the laser intensity and the thermal-stress field distribution is studied by deducing the formulas through utilizing the integral-transform method. The influence of window radius, thickness and laser intensity on the temperature and stress field distributions is analyzed. Then, the performance of K9 glass and the fused silica glass is compared, and the laser-induced damage mechanism is analyzed. Finally, the damage thresholds of laser windows are calculated. The results show that compared with K9 glass, the fused silica glass has a higher damage threshold due to its good thermodynamic properties. The presented theoretical analysis and simulation results are helpful for the design and selection of high-power laser windows.\n\nJoint design of large-tip-angle parallel RF pulses and blipped gradient trajectories.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Zhipeng; Donahue, Manus J; Ma, Jun; Grissom, William A\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo design multichannel large-tip-angle kT-points and spokes radiofrequency (RF) pulses and gradient waveforms for transmit field inhomogeneity compensation in high field magnetic resonance imaging. An algorithm to design RF subpulse weights and gradient blip areas is proposed to minimize a magnitude least-squares cost function that measures the difference between realized and desired state parameters in the spin domain, and penalizes integrated RF power. The minimization problem is solved iteratively with interleaved target phase updates, RF subpulse weights updates using the conjugate gradient method with optimal control-based derivatives, and gradient blip area updates using the conjugate gradient method. Two-channel parallel transmit simulations and experiments were conducted in phantoms and human subjects at 7 T to demonstrate the method and compare it to small-tip-angle-designed pulses and circularly polarized excitations. The proposed algorithm designed more homogeneous and accurate 180Â° inversion and refocusing pulses than other methods. It also designed large-tip-angle pulses on multiple frequency bands with independent and joint phase relaxation. Pulses designed by the method improved specificity and contrast-to-noise ratio in a finger-tapping spin echo blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging study, compared with circularly polarized mode refocusing. A joint RF and gradient waveform design algorithm was proposed and validated to improve large-tip-angle inversion and refocusing at ultrahigh field.

First, the universal model of aerodynamic environment is established based on the theory of Computational Fluid Dynamics, and the pneumatic pressure distribution and temperature data of optical window surface is obtained when aircraft flies in 5-30km altitude, 0.5-3Ma speed and 0-30Â°angle of attack. The temperature and pressure distribution values for the maximum constraint is selected as the initial value of external conditions on the optical window surface. Then, the optical window and mechanical structure are designed, which is also divided into two parts: First, mechanical structure which meet requirements of the security and tightness is designed. Finally, rigorous analysis and evaluation are given about the structure of optics and mechanics we have designed. There are two parts to be analyzed. First, the Fluid-Solid-Heat Coupled Model is given based on finite element analysis. And the deformation of the glass and structure can be obtained by the model, which can assess the feasibility of the designed optical windows and ancillary structure; Second, the new optical surface is fitted by Zernike polynomials according to the deformation of the surface of the optical window, which can evaluate imaging quality impact of spectral camera by the deformation of window.\n\nTuner design and RF test of a four-rod RFQ\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, QuanFeng; Zhu, Kun; Guo, ZhiYu; Kang, MingLei; Gao, ShuLi; Lu, YuanRong; Chen, JiaEr\n\n2011-12-01\n\nA mini-vane four-rod radio frequency quadruple (RFQ) accelerator has been built for neutron imaging. The RFQ will operate at 201.5 MHz, and its length is 2.7 m. The original electric field distribution along the electrodes is not flat. The resonant frequency needs to be tuned to the operating value. And the frequency needs to be compensated for temperature change during high power RF test and beam test. As tuning such a RFQ is difficult, plate tuners and stick tuners are designed. This paper will present the tuners design, the tuning procedure, and the RF properties of the RFQ.\n\nAn algorithm for the design and tuning of RF accelerating structures with variable cell lengths\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLal, Shankar; Pant, K. K.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAn algorithm is proposed for the design of a Ï mode standing wave buncher structure with variable cell lengths. It employs a two-parameter, multi-step approach for the design of the structure with desired resonant frequency and field flatness. The algorithm, along with analytical scaling laws for the design of the RF power coupling slot, makes it possible to accurately design the structure employing a freely available electromagnetic code like SUPERFISH. To compensate for machining errors, a tuning method has been devised to achieve desired RF parameters for the structure, which has been qualified by the successful tuning of a 7-cell buncher to Ï mode frequency of 2856 MHz with field flatness <3% and RF coupling coefficient close to unity. The proposed design algorithm and tuning method have demonstrated the feasibility of developing an S-band accelerating structure for desired RF parameters with a relatively relaxed machining tolerance of â¼ 25 Î¼m.

Scaling laws and the theory of invariant envelope provide to the designers excellent tools for a first parameters choice and the code HOMDYN, based on a multi-slice envelope description of the beam dynamics, is tailored to describe the space charge dominated dynamics of laminar beams in presence of time dependent space charge forces, giving rise to a very fast modeling capability for photo-injectors design. We report in this talk the results of a recent beam dynamics study, motivated by the need to redesign the LCLS photoinjector. During this work a new effective working point for a split RF photoinjector has been discovered by means of the previous mentioned approach. By a proper choice of rf gun and solenoid parameters, the emittance evolution shows a double minimum behavior in the drifting region. If the booster is located where the relative emittance maximum and the envelope waist occur, the second emittance minimum can be shifted at the booster exit and frozen at a very low level (0.3 mm-mrad for a 1 nC flat top bunch), to the extent that the invariant envelope matching conditions are satisfied.\n\nEfficient Direct-Matching Rectenna Design for RF Power Transfer Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKeyrouz, Shady; Visser, Huib\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis paper presents the design, simulation, fabrication and measurements of a 50 ohm rectenna system.

This paper discusses the requirements of high temperature RF material characterizations for transparent ceramic materials, such as ALON, that can potentially be used for multispectral windows. The RF cylindrical resonator was designed and the numerical model was studied to characterize the dielectric constant of materials. The dielectric constant can be extracted from the resonant frequency shift based on the cavity perturbation method (CPM), which is sensitive to the sample size and shape. Laser heating was applied to the material under test (MUT), which could easily be heated above 1000Â°C by the laser irradiation, in order to conduct CPM at high temperature. The temperature distribution in a material was also analyzed to investigate the impact of the thermal properties and the sample shape.\n\nFeasibility study of a new RF coil design for prostate MRI\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHa, Seunghoon; Roeck, Werner W.; Cho, Jaedu; Nalcioglu, Orhan\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe combined use of a torso-pelvic RF array coil and endorectal RF coil is the current state-of-the-art in prostate MRI. The endorectal coil provides high detection sensitivity to acquire high-spatial resolution images and spectroscopic data, while the torso-pelvic coil provides large coverage to assess pelvic lymph nodes and pelvic bones for metastatic disease. However, the use of an endorectal coil is an invasive procedure that presents difficulties for both patients and technicians. In this study, we propose a novel non-invasive RF coil design that can provide both image signal to noise ratio and field of view coverage comparable to the combined torso-pelvic and endorectal coil configuration. A prototype coil was constructed and tested using a pelvic phantom. The results demonstrate that this new design is a viable alternative for prostate MRI\n\nFinal Report for \"Design calculations for high-space-charge beam-to-RF conversion\".\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDavid N Smithe\n\n2008-10-17\n\nAccelerator facility upgrades, new accelerator applications, and future design efforts are leading to novel klystron and IOT device concepts, including multiple beam, high-order mode operation, and new geometry configurations of old concepts. At the same time, a new simulation capability, based upon finite-difference âcut-cellâ boundaries, has emerged and is transforming the existing modeling and design capability with unparalleled realism, greater flexibility, and improved accuracy. This same new technology can also be brought to bear on a difficult-to-study aspect of the energy recovery linac (ERL), namely the accurate modeling of the exit beam, and design of the beam dump for optimummoreÂ Â» energy efficiency. We have developed new capability for design calculations and modeling of a broad class of devices which convert bunched beam kinetic energy to RF energy, including RF sources, as for example, klystrons, gyro-klystrons, IOT's, TWTâs, and other devices in which space-charge effects are important. Recent advances in geometry representation now permits very accurate representation of the curved metallic surfaces common to RF sources, resulting in unprecedented simulation accuracy. In the Phase I work, we evaluated and demonstrated the capabilities of the new geometry representation technology as applied to modeling and design of output cavity components of klystron, IOT's, and energy recovery srf cavities. We identified and prioritized which aspects of the design study process to pursue and improve in Phase II. The development and use of the new accurate geometry modeling technology on RF sources for DOE accelerators will help spark a new generational modeling and design capability, free from many of the constraints and inaccuracy associated with the previous generation of âstair-stepâ geometry modeling tools.

In this work, an RF energy harvester is presented to obtain energy from Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) 900 MHz signals. The energy harvester, consisting of a two-stage Dickson voltage multiplier circuit and L-type impedance matching circuits, was designed, simulated, fabricated and tested experimentally in terms of its performance. Simulation and experimental works were carried out for various input power levels, load resistances and input frequencies. Both simulation and experimental works have been carried out for this frequency band. An efficiency of 45% is obtained from the system at 0 dBm input power level using the impedance matching circuit. This corresponds to the power of 450 Î¼W and this value is sufficient for many low-power devices. The most important parameters affecting the efficiency of the RF energy harvester are the input power level, frequency band, impedance matching and voltage multiplier circuits, load resistance and the selection of diodes.

The RF powering circuit harvests energy from electromagnetic waves and converts the RF energy to a stable voltage source. Analysis of a NMOS gate-cross connected bridge rectifier is conducted to demonstrate relationship between device sizes and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the rectifier.

In this project, a 100 MeV high intensity compact proton cyclotron is built for multiple applications. The first successful beam extraction of CYCIAE-100 cyclotron was done in the middle of 2014. The extracted proton beam energy is 100 MeV and the beam current is more than 20 Î¼A. The RF system of the CYCIAE-100 cyclotron includes two half-wavelength cavities, two 100 kW tetrode amplifiers and power transmission line systems (all above are independent from each other) and two sets of Low Level RF control crates. Each set of LLRF control includes an amplitude control unit, a tuning control unit, a phase control unit, a local Digital Signal Process control unit and an Advanced RISC Machines based EPICS IOC unit. These two identical LLRF control crates share one common reference clock and take advantages of modern digital technologies (e.g. DSP and Direct Digital Synthesizer) to achieve closed loop voltage and phase regulations of the dee-voltage. In the beam commission, the measured dee-voltage stability of RF system is better than 0.1% and phase stability is better than 0.03Â°. The hardware design of the LLRF system will be reviewed in this paper.\n\nrf design of a pulse compressor with correction cavity chain for klystron-based compact linear collider\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Ping; Zha, Hao; Syratchev, Igor; Shi, Jiaru; Chen, Huaibi\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe present an X-band high-power pulse compression system for a klystron-based compact linear collider. In this system design, one rf power unit comprises two klystrons, a correction cavity chain, and two SLAC Energy Doubler (SLED)-type X-band pulse compressors (SLEDX). An rf pulse passes the correction cavity chain, by which the pulse shape is modified. The rf pulse is then equally split into two ways, each deploying a SLEDX to compress the rf power. Each SLEDX produces a short pulse with a length of 244 ns and a peak power of 217 MW to power four accelerating structures. With the help of phase-to-amplitude modulation, the pulse has a dedicated shape to compensate for the beam loading effect in accelerating structures. The layout of this system and the rf design and parameters of the new pulse compressor are described in this work.\n\nDesign optimization of RF lines in vacuum environment for the MITICA experiment\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDe Muri, Michela, E-mail: michela.demuri@igi.cnr.it; Consorzio RFX, Corso Stati Uniti, 4, I-35127 Padova; Pavei, Mauro\n\nThis contribution regards the Radio Frequency (RF) transmission line of the Megavolt ITER Injector and Concept Advancement (MITICA) experiment. The original design considered copper coaxial lines of 1â³ 5/8, but thermal simulations under operating conditions showed maximum temperatures of the lines at regime not compatible with the prescription of the component manufacturer. Hence, an optimization of the design was necessary. Enhancing thermal radiation and increasing the conductor size were considered for design optimization: thermal analyses were carried out to calculate the temperature of MITICA RF lines during operation, as a function of the emissivity value and of other geometrical parameters.moreÂ Â» Five coating products to increase the conductor surface emissivity were tested, measuring the outgassing behavior of the selected products and the obtained emissivity values.Â«Â less\n\nA multimodal logistics service network design with time windows and environmental concerns\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhang, Dezhi; He, Runzhong; Wang, Zhongwei\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe design of a multimodal logistics service network with customer service time windows and environmental costs is an important and challenging issue.

The governing differential equations for a variable slew-rate spiral are derived, and both numeric and analytic solutions to the equations are given. The primary application of variable slew-rate spirals is peak B(1) amplitude reduction in 2D RF pulse design. The reduction of peak B(1) amplitude is achieved by changing the gradient slew-rate profile, and gradient amplitude and slew-rate constraints are inherently satisfied by the design of variable slew-rate spiral gradient waveforms. A design example of 2D RF pulses is given, which shows that under the same hardware constraints the RF pulse using a properly chosen variable slew-rate spiral trajectory can be much shorter than that using a conventional constant slew-rate spiral trajectory, thus having greater immunity to resonance frequency offsets.\n\nAirborne RF Measurement System and Analysis of Representative Flight RF Environment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKoppen, Sandra V.; Ely, Jay J.; Smith, Laura J.; Jones, Richard A.; Fleck, Vincent J.; Salud, Maria Theresa; Mielnik, John\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEnvironmental radio frequency (RF) data over a broad band of frequencies were needed to evaluate the airspace around several airports.

A complementary type EC is a device containing two electrochromic layers, one of which is anodically colored such as vanadium oxide (V2 O5) while the other cathodically colored such as tungsten oxide (WO3) which is separated by an ionic conduction layer (electrolyte). The use of a solid electrolyte such as Nafion eliminates the need for containment of the liquid electrolyte, which simplifies the cell design, as well as improves safety and durability. In this work, the EC device was fabricated on a ITO/glass slide. The WO3-TiO2 thin film was deposited by reactive RF magnetron sputtering using a 2-in W/Ti (9:1%wt) target with purity of 99.9% in a mixture gas of argon and oxygen. As a counter electrode layer, V2O5 film was deposited on an ITO/glass substrate using V2O3 target with the same conditions of reactive RF magnetron sputtering. Modified Nafion was used as an electrolyte to complete EC device. The transmittance spectra of the complementary EC device was measured by optical spectrophotometry when a voltage of +/-3 V was applied to the EC device by computer controlled system. The surface morphology of the films was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) for EC device was performed by sweeping the potential between +/-3 V at a scan rate of 50 mV/s.\n\nDesigning for Virtual Windows in a Deep Space Habitat\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHowe, A. Scott; Howard, Robert L.; Moore, Nathan; Amoroso, Michael\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses configurations and test analogs toward the design of a virtual window capability in a Deep Space Habitat. Long-duration space missions will require crews to remain in the confines of a spacecraft for extended periods of time, with possible harmful effects if a crewmember cannot cope with the small habitable volume. Virtual windows expand perceived volume using a minimal amount of image projection equipment and computing resources, and allow a limited immersion in remote environments. Uses for the virtual window include: live or augmented reality views of the external environment; flight deck, piloting, observation, or other participation in remote missions through live transmission of cameras mounted to remote vehicles; pre-recorded background views of nature areas, seasonal occurrences, or cultural events; and pre-recorded events such as birthdays, anniversaries, and other meaningful events prepared by ground support and families of the crewmembers.\n\nA thesis investigating the impact of energy related environmental factors on domestic window design\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcEvoy, Michael Edward\n\nIn recent years the extent of glazing in houses has been tightly controlled by the Building Regulations in order to save energy. In addition guidelines derived from passive solar principles prescribe the distribution of domestic windows between elevations according to their orientation. This thesis studies the impact of these energy-related environmental factors on domestic window design. The first of these investigations determined the degree to which limitations on the area and arrangement of windows are significant in terms of daylighting. The experiments measured the effect that passive solar requirements and detailed aspects of window design have on the quality of daylighting in houses. The volume of background ventilation required for domestic accommodation has recently been increased. As a result, in a well-sealed construction, heat loss due to background ventilation becomes a larger part of the total heat loss and larger air movements become a potential cause of draughts. The ventilation experiment sought to establish the impact of these more onerous requirements on comfort within rooms. The third experiment combines these factors and asks the question: Could windows be actively involved in overcoming some of these difficulties by being used to preheat ventilation air in order to diminish the extent of heat loss and to alleviate the problem of cold draughts? Also by designing the window to reclaim heat from the room might it be possible to offset the window's thermal inadequacy? Through analysis of responses to a questionnaire and the use of optimisation techniques, scenarios were suggested for the future modification of windows in relation to energy and health expectations. The conclusions form a commentary on recent and future revisions to the Building Regulations and determine whether or not the Regulations facilitate the environmental engineering of windows as an active component of a building's whole environmental system.\n\nAirborne RF Measurement System (ARMS) and Analysis of Representative Flight RF Environment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKoppen, Sandra V.; Ely, Jay J.; Smith, Laura J.; Jones, Richard A.; Fleck, Vincent J.; Salud, Maria Theresa; Mielnik, John J.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEnvironmental radio frequency (RF) data over a broad band of frequencies (30 MHz to 1000 MHz) were obtained to evaluate the electromagnetic environment in airspace around several airports.

To sustain plasma in its ionic form very high temperature is essential. RF heating systems are used to provide the required temperature. Arching phenomenon in these systems can cause enormous damage to the RF tube. Heavy current flows across the anode-cathode junction, which need to be suppressed in minimal time for its protection. Fast-switching circuit breakers are used to cut-off the load from the supply in cases of arching. The crowbar interrupts the connection between the high voltage power supply (HVPS) and the RF tube for a temporary period between which the series switch has to open. The crowbar shunts the current across the load but in the process leads to short circuiting the HVPS. Thus, to protect the load as well as the HVPS a series switch is necessary. This paper presents the design and development of high voltage Series Switch for the high power switching applications. Fiber optic based Optimum triggering scheme is designed and tested to restrict the time delay well within the stipulated limits. The design is well supported with the experimental results for the whole set-up along with the series switch at various voltage level before its approval for operation at 5.2 kV.\n\nIncreased Light & View | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nAir Leakage (AL) | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nState Fact Sheets | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nFact Sheets & Publications | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nCondensation Resistance (CR) | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nLow Conductance Spacers | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nEnergy & Cost Savings | Efficient Windows Collaborative\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nFoundry Foundry New Construction Windows Window Selection Tool Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Replacement Windows Window Selection Tool Assessing Options Selection Process Design Guidance Installation Understanding Windows Benefits Design Considerations Measuring Performance Performance Standards\n\nIR window design for hypersonic missile seekers: thermal shock and cooling systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHingst, Uwe; Koerber, Stefan\n\n2001-10-01\n\nInfra-red (IR) seekers on missiles at high Mach-numbers in the lower tier air defence often suffer from degradation in performance due to aerothermodynamic effects. The kind and rate of degradation depends on the geometric design (shape) and location of the IR-window. Optimal design may reduce those effects but still misses to totally withstand the imposed thermal stresses (thermal shock). Proper thermal protection systems and/or window cooling systems will be needed. The first part of this paper deals particularly with passive IR- window design features to reduce the thermal stresses. A series of wind-tunnel testings focused on the thermal shock behavior of different IR-window shapes under critical flight conditions. The variation of typical design parameters demonstrates the available features to reduce thermal shock by passive ways. The second part presents active thermal stress reduction devices, e.g. an active cooling system. Among others the most efficient reduction of thermal heating is based on three components: A partial coverage of the IR-dome to protect most parts against heating effects, a rotating system bearing the IR-dome and a liquid spray-cooling system in the gap between the cover and the IR-dome. The hemispherical or pyramidal dome can be located either midways in the missile nose section or sideways on the structure. The liquid spray cooling system combines both, a heat exchange by fluid evaporation and a heat transfer by fluid and gas cross flow (convection), causing a low fluid consumption. Such a cooling system along with their driving parameters and the resulting analytical performance will be presented.\n\nEfficient Windows Collaborative\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNils Petermann\n\n2010-02-28\n\nThe project goals covered both the residential and commercial windows markets and involved a range of audiences such as window manufacturers, builders, homeowners, design professionals, utilities, and public agencies. Essential goals included: (1) Creation of 'Master Toolkits' of information that integrate diverse tools, rating systems, and incentive programs, customized for key audiences such as window manufacturers, design professionals, and utility programs. (2) Delivery of education and outreach programs to multiple audiences through conference presentations, publication of articles for builders and other industry professionals, and targeted dissemination of efficient window curricula to professionals and students. (3) Design and implementation of mechanismsmoreÂ Â» to encourage and track sales of more efficient products through the existing Window Products Database as an incentive for manufacturers to improve products and participate in programs such as NFRC and ENERGY STAR. (4) Development of utility incentive programs to promote more efficient residential and commercial windows. Partnership with regional and local entities on the development of programs and customized information to move the market toward the highest performing products. An overarching project goal was to ensure that different audiences adopt and use the developed information, design and promotion tools and thus increase the market penetration of energy efficient fenestration products. In particular, a crucial success criterion was to move gas and electric utilities to increase the promotion of energy efficient windows through demand side management programs as an important step toward increasing the market share of energy efficient windows.Â«Â less\n\nMitigation of Parallel RF Potentials by an Appropriate Antenna Design Using TOPICA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaggiora, R.; Milanesio, D.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nA substantial effort has been devoted in recent years to the optimization of the ITER Ion Cyclotron (IC) launcher [1], above all with the aim of maximizing the coupling performances of the antenna; good improvements have been documented by using TOPICA code [2], a predictive tool for the design and optimization of RF launchers in front of a plasma region. Despite the progresses in the mentioned topic, this is not the only issue related to the design of IC antennas: a second crucial aspect is the impurities production, which is driven by the parallel RF potentials generated by the antenna itself and by the surrounding structures. The goal of this work is to analyze a set of innovative solutions that could be implemented in the next generation of IC antennas in order to mitigate the parallel RF potentials without reducing the power delivered to plasma. To achieve this challenging task, the TOPICA code has been adopted, taking advantage of recently introduced features. In particular, the code permits to compute the electric field distribution everywhere inside the antenna enclosure and in the plasma column, allowing to determine not only the magnitude and shape of the fields in front of the antenna, but also to evaluate their radial decay. Provided the electric field map, it is then possible to determine the parallel RF potentials and, even more important, to directly verify the impact of geometrical"
