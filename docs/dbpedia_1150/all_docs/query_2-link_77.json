The victories in aviation, achieved by the Soviet Union, are of fundamental importance. They are the result of practicing the Leninist policy of industrialization which ensures that the USSR will be technically and economically independent of the capitalist world. They demonstrated the preponderance of the socialist economic system, its ability to liquidate the technical backwardness within the shortest possible time. They convincingly showed the sweep of the scientific and cultural revolution in the Soviet Union. They are a testimony to the incessant care by the Party and the nation to strengthen the defense potential of the country. AUTHOR'S FOREWORD This brief outline of the development of aircraft construction in the Soviet Union during the fifty years of Soviet power does not claim to be a comprehensive and profound analysis of the building up of the Soviet aircraft industry. The author assumed a more limited task: to describe the main stages in the progress of aircraft construction by showing the technical growth of scientific and design thinking of Soviet designers from the October Revolution to the present. The heritage of Czarist Russia was nothing except poverty. The Soviet people had to build the aircraft industry anew so that it would be worthy of a great country and correspond to military and economic needs. And such an industry was created! The first Soviet airmen were surrounded by the understanding and care of V. I. Lenin, with his help aircraft factories were \"put on their feet, \" and the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI)*, the center of aviation science was organized, thus establishing Soviet air power. The Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government devoted systematic attention to the aircraft industry; they determined ways of developing Soviet aircraft production. The successes of Soviet aircraft construction, which was most severely tested in World War II, are pai^ticularly pronounced when compared with the aviation of the Soviet Union's enemies and her allies in the last war. The preponderance is on the side of the Soviet Union, her armed forces and her scientific and technical thinking. Talented designers and scientists, educated by the Party, founded Soviet aviation fame. Their successes are the visible result of the self-sacrificing work of a host of workers, administrative and technical employees of the aircraft industry who always marched in the foremost ranks of the fighters for the strengthening of the economic and defensive power of the Soviet Union. Soviet aircraft construction passed through several major stages in its development. The first stage was the reconstruction of prerevolutionary plants and the preparation of aircraft production according to captured models. It corresponds to the period of restoration and reconstruction of the Soviet Union. The second stage was the creation of Soviet aircraft industry during the First and the beginning of the Second Five- Year Plan. Then aviation developed on the basis of original Soviet designs. The third stage was the mastering of new technology in the prewar years with a view to the lessons of the Spanish civil war. The fourth stage was World War II. The fifth stage was the technical revolution in aviation, connected with the advent of jet aircraft. Finally the present stage is the solution of problems * [See List of Abbreviations. ] dictated by the military and defense needs and the rapid growth of Soviet civil aviation. It is impossible in this brief outline to describe or mention all the diverse work done in each stage of development of aircraft construction and the work of all the design offices and individual designers who produced original types and kinds of aircraft, some of which were only of experimental interest but enriched our knowledge and others which at some time reach-ed the production stage in small series but were withdrawn in favor of better aircraft. Here we deal only with the main trends at each stage of aircraft construc- tion development which were decisive for the creation of Soviet air power, corresponding to general political, military and economic tasks solved by the Party and government. 1. A DIFFICULT START The Soviet state received a poor inheritance in aviation: some hundreds of old and worn-out airplanes, mostly of foreign-make and obsolete plants and worshops producing aircraft and engines, partly based on domestic labor. The aircraft industry had to be built from the beginning. From the first days of Soviet power Lenin concentrated on the creation of a Red air fleet, and according to his instructions, TsAGI was founded in 1918 under the direction of Professor N. E. Joukowski. In 1923 the Society of Friends of the Air Fleet (ODVF) was founded. This society not only accumulated means for the restoration of plants and the construction of aircraft, it also carried out much propaganda among the masses. The building of the country' s aviation became a national task. Before the revolution aircraft production in Russia was confined to about fifteen plants and workshops in Moscow, Petrograd, Simferopol, Taganrog, Rybinsk, Odessa, and Riga. The largest of them were: the bicycle plant Duks in Moscow, the Shchetinin and Lebedev plants and the Russo-Baltic Railroad Car Plant in Petrograd, and Anatra in Odessa. All the aircraft plants in Czarist Russia employed a combined total of about ten thousand workers of different trades. At that time most of the planes built in Russia were of foreign-make, principally French Farmans, Morans, Voisins, Nieuports. Russian manufacturers were reluctant to accept orders for Russian-designed planes. Although Russia had planes of its own design, such as the Lebed, Parasol and Sikorskii, the tendency was to accept foreign types made according to drawings by Western firms or partly assembled from parts purchased abroad. For instance, as early as 1913 the Russo-Baltic Railroad Car Plant built, under the direction of I. I. Sikorskii, the Il'ya Muromets* the first multi- engined heavy aircraft in the world. During World War 1 the front received some tens of these planes. The designers constantly improved it, increasing its load capacity and range. Il'ya Muromets, E-type with four engines, had a speed of 135 kph and a ceiling of 4000m. Its payload was 2.5 tons including a seven- man crew and 800kg of bombs. Its defensive armament against enemy fighters, seven machine guns, was powerful at that time. True, the designing of planes in Russia and in the West was primitive; aviation science was just being founded. The first branches of this science made themselves felt in the Moscow Technical College where an aviation circle worked under the direction of Professor Joukowski. Members of this circle were students of the college and are now famous Soviet aviation experts: Tupolev, Arkhangel'skii, Vetchinkin, Stechkin. When war broke out in 1914, the Russian army of the front had just over two hundred fifty serviceable planes. The calculations of the Czarist government to cover their needs of aircraft and engines by purchases abroad * This aircraft was built with the participation of N.N. Polikarpov who later became famous as a designer. proved wrong. During the war great difficulties in supply were encountered. In addition the Allies tried to delude Russia with obsolete planes which were already unsuitable for their own armies. All this made it necessary to create a domestic aircraft industry. It is characteristic that before World War I Russia produced, in total, approximately forty airplanes of different types per month whereas at the end of the war in 1917 the Duks plant in Moscow alone produced seventy-five to one hundred planes per month. Duks produced exclusively landplanes. The Shchetinin plant in Petrograd, in addition to landplanes Nieuport, Farman, and Voisin, also produced flying boats designed just before the war by the famous Russian designer D. P. Grigorovich. Grigorovich's M-5 and M-9 flying boats were a great technical achievement for their time, and they served the Russian navy effectively in the Baltic and Black seas. Between 1914 and 1917 about two hundred hydroplanes were built. There were no such planes in other countries. The work of the aircraft industry was impeded at that time by a profusion of different types and the frequent changes in design of aircraft by individual plants. During the war the plants introduced serial production of more than twenty different designs. In 1917 the main aircraft, produced in the largest quantities in Russian plants, were reconnaissance and bombing planes Farman-27, Farman-SO, Voisin, and different types of the Nieuport fighter planes. A particular difficulty for the Russian aircraft industry was the production of engines. A lack of good steels resulted in a weak metallurgical base, and there were other difficulties in the production of magnetos, spark plugs, and various instruments and devices. During the war only ten to fifteen percent of the required aircraft engines were supplied by Russian plants. After the February revolution in Russia, from mid-1917, deliveries to the aircraft industry from abroad ceased almost completely. In October the fleet of aircraft had slightly exceeded one thousand machines, most of which were already in need of repair. There were considerable losses of planes at the front, and at that time aircraft had a short service life. With the victory of the October revolution, under conditions of the incipient foreign intervention and civil war, the most important task became the defense and strengthening of the revolutionary achievements. Literally within the first few days of Soviet power the People's Commissariat of Defense created the Aviation Board with nine members (three military aviators and six from aircraft plants, trade unions and workers' organiza- tions). The board was charged by the Soviet government to reorganize aviation matters and to collect from all fronts airplanes, engines and spare parts. It was necessary to gather as much as possible for the defense of the Soviet regime. Under the existing conditions it was difficult to ensure production in aircraft factories. The representatives of the board therefore appealed to Lenin. This is what one member of the board, K. V. Akashev, wrote in his memoirs: \"... the representatives of the board turned to Vladimir Rich Lenin. We asked the secretariat of the Council of People's Commissars to arrange for a personal meeting v/ith Lenin, and were received that very same day. After having briefly outlined our views of the importance and place of the air fleet within the cultural structure of the Soviet republic, we asked Lenin to create a People's Commissariat of the Air Fleet. Lenin did not object to assigning an important role to the air fleet under peacetime conditions of the country, and he agreed to its importance as one of the great cultural achievements of our century. \"This was particularly pleasing, because a short time before, when asked to retain the aircraft factories, Larin at the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council replied that the Soviet state did not need enterprises 'similar to a scent and ointment factor'. \"Concerning the main problem that interested us, namely the creation of a People's Commissariat of the Air Fleet, Lenin did not reject it in principle^ but he explained to us that in the present situation the Soviet state had a more urgent task than the thorough reorganization of the air fleet, namely that the October revolution must strengthen the foundation of the country, i.e., the economy. \"'Next time we shall discuss the creation of the People's Commissariat of the Air Fleet' were Lenin's own words in conclusion. \"Our meeting with Lenin took place in January 1918. At that time the situation was extremely serious. The Germans were threatening to conquer Petrograd, the Government was preparing to move to Moscow, in the south the counterrevolution took up arms. . . *\" The civil war and intervention made it imperative to develop chiefly the military air force. In May 1918 the Main Administration of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Air Fleet was created. In June the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree nationalizing the aircraft factories. It was the beginning of the recovery of the country's aircraft industry, with the Duks plant in Moscow and the Petersburg plant, subsequently named \"Krasnyi letchik\" (Red Flyer), being first. That same year, 1918, under Lenin's direct participation, TsAGI was founded, later developing into a large center of aeronautical science of worldwide importance. It was the direct descendant of the aerodynamic laboratory of the Moscow Technical College and the Computing and Testing Office. This was one of the first proofs of the care with which the young Soviet state surrounded its aviation. In December 1918 the board of TsAGI first met in Joukowski's apartment, under his chairmanship. One must visualize the atmosphere of those days. Many plants had closed down because of lack of raw materials; in Moscow there was no light and fuel. Yet the seventy-year-old Joukowski initiated and presided over a group for organizing a Soviet aviation center! On Joukowski's initiative the Aviatekhnikum (in 1922 reorganized and called the Academy of the Air Fleet) was founded in Moscow. The mechanical department of the Moscow Technical College instituted aerodynamics as a field of specialization (on its basis the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI) was founded in 1930). Even under the conditions of economic collapse the aircraft plants and workshops gradually came back to life. There were no engines. Aircraft materials were beyond their original worth. In 1919, when the Caucasus was cut off from central Russia, a grave crisis erupted because of lack of aircraft fuel. The situation of the country in general was extremely grave. How bad the shortage of arms was is illustrated by the cable that Lenin • Samolet, 1924, No. 2, p. 3. sent to the Revolutionary Military Council on 9 June 1919, recommending that two or three men should share one rifle. * The supply situation became critical. Still under such conditions during the first years of Soviet power, in plants that had been preserved and partly rebuilt, aircraft were not only repaired but even built and sent to the war fronts. After the counterrevolution had been defeated and the foreign interven- tionists chased out, the country was able to begin peaceful construction. The chief task was the rebuilding of the economy and defense of the state. It was necessary to ensure against any surprise on the part of the enemies surrounding the country. One of the important defense measures was the creation of the country's own aviation. As early as January 1921 the Council of Labor and Defense decided to form a commission for developing a maximum program of aircraft construction. As the rebuilding of the economy progressed, the creation of aviation became literally a national concern. There were mottos; \"Working men, build an air fleet'.\" \"Proletarian, into the airplane'.\" \"Donate an engine'. \" \"Without victory in the air there is no victory on the ground'. \" \"From model to glider, from glider to airplane'. \". Three problems faced the Soviet Union: to find the means for building an air fleet and for equipping new aircraft plants; to build planes and teach the masters of the country, the workers and peasants to fly them; to open up the worst bottleneck in aircraft construction- engine production. In March 1923 ODVF was founded. Its aim was to inspire a national movement for the building of an air fleet, to organize the collection of means for building aircraft and engines, to spread knowledge of aviation among the population. The Society promoted organizations of mass aircraft modeling and of glider flying. It made propaganda for aviation, published the journal \"Samolet, \" organized propaganda flights throughout Moscow and the country, though still with Junkers planes bought abroad. The Society's newspapers and periodicals solicited donations for the building of the air fleet. In 1923 the society Dobrolet was founded; it developed later into the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The Soviet nation had to build its aviation while creating its science and industry and educating its own aeronautical scientists and engineers and workers and flyers. The nation knew that nobody else would help with these tasks, and it relied only on its own strength. At first it was necessary to provide airplanes from abroad. To form regular air force units, a small number of Fokker-D7 fighter planes were bought ui 1922-23 from Holland (where the German firm Fokker moved after the defeat of Imperial Germany), and English Martinside fighters, Italian Ansaldo reconnaissance planes, and German Ju-13 passenger planes. The country did not even disdain using captured aircraft left behind by the interventionists. According to captured JEiiglish models the Duks and Aviarabotnik plants in Moscow began producing the De Havilland-4, De Havilland-9, De Havilland-9A sind the Krasnyi letchik plant in Petrograd produced the Avro-504. ** Moreover, licenses were obtained for the * Lenin, V.I. Polnoe sobranie sochinenii (Complete Collected Works), Vol. 35, p. 332. ** An Avro plane was shot down in 1919 near Petrozavodsk. The pilot was a White Guard by the name of Ankudinov. The famous aircraft designer Sergei Vladimirovich Ilyushin was then a mechanic on an aircraft repair train, Ilyushin was ordered to dismantle the plane after it had been shot down and to bring it to Moscow where drawings were made from it at the Duks plant. production of foreign-makes. The Aviarabotnik plant made the Fokker-DH; Junkers in Moscow, which had a concession, produced the Ju-21 in Fil and assembled the Ju-13 passenger plane. Copying foreign models was a necessary evil and a temporary measure. In the twenties Soviet aircraft design offices were already organized: under Tupolev in TsAGI and under Polikarpov and Grigorovich in the Duks plant. The first born of Soviet aircraft production were the light sports monoplane ANT-1 and the three -seater passenger monoplane AK-1, also called the \"Latvian Gunner,\" which flew on the first Russian air route Moscow- Nizhnii Novogorod in 1924, and then took part in the flight from Moscow to Peking. N. N. Polikarpov built the single-seater I-l fighter monoplane in 1923, and in 1924 flight tests began of the 1-2 single-seater fighter designed by D. P. Grigorovich. In 1925 Tupolev built the all-metal two-seater ANT- 3 (R-3) reconnaissance plane, and immediately afterward the twin-engined heavy bomber ANT- 4 (TB-1). Research work also branched into new fields. The aerodynamic laboratory of the Moscow Technical College became too small, and on 9 May 1924 a new aerodynamic laboratory was founded, now called the Chaplygin laboratory. Also laboratories for research on aircraft materials and engines, a towing basin, and an experimental plant were built. All these measures by the Soviet state for building its own aviation required an enormous effort and large sums of money. It received much help from the ODVF. The problem of building an air fleet and the work of the ODVF were discussed by the 13th Congress of the Bolshevik party. On 1 June 1924, ODVF, in a ceremony at the Moscow central airport, presented the 13th Party Congress with the \"Lenin\" squadron. From money donated by the population one hundred combat aircraft were built and delivered to the air force. At that time monkey was also collected for the squadron \"Ultimatum\" in reply to the sudden ultimatum delivered by Lord Curzon to the Soviet government, for the squadron \"Our Reply to Chamberlain, \" and others. The ODVF organized a number of long flights. In 1923 Veiling in a Ju-13 plane flew 11,000 km of the route Moscow- Tiflis- Tashkent- Moscow. In 1924 six R-1 planes piloted by Mezheraup, Garanin, Arvatov, Goppe, Yakobson and Zalevskii, flew to Kabul in Afghanistan. These planes of Soviet manufacture traversed the Hindukush mountain range and attained an altitude of 5000 m. In 1925 Kopylov in a Ju-13 plane flew the route Moscow-Kazan- Ufa- Perm- Vyatka- Ustyug- Vologda- Moscow, a total of 10,000 km. That same year the flight from Moscow to Peking, for that time a grandiose undertaking, took place. There were six planes, of which three were Soviet manufactured (types R-1 and R-2), one was an AK-1 passenger plane and two Ju-13s. Because of the variety of planes and the difficulty of the route, this flight was a serious challenge to pilots and machines. The expedition reached Peking after thirty-three days. The participants of the flight, Gromov, Volkovoinov, Ekatov, Naidenov, Tonnashevskii and Polyakov, received the title \"Distinguished Flyer. \" Beginning in 1925 the organization of flights was taken over by the Commission for Long- Range Soviet Flights, which was headed by S. S. Kamenev, the commander-in-chief. In the summer of 1926 two international flights took place with R-1 planes: the first piloted by Ya. Moiseev on the route Moscow- Teheran- Moscow, more than 6000 km and the second piloted by P. Mezheraup, on the route Moscow- Ankara, approximately 2000km. From then on all the flights were made on planes which were not only made but also designed in Russia. Aircraft construction developed both in quantity and in quality. From planes Whose main materials were pinewood, plywood and canvas, the Soviet industry managed as early as in the mid-twenties to change over Tupolev's all-metal dural planes. A.N. Tupolev at that time wrote about the first Soviet metal plane, the ANT- 2. \"The 26 May 1924 should be marked in the history of Soviet aircraft construction. On that day, over the central airport, the first Soviet metal plane, designed and built by the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute of the Scientific and Technical Section of the Supreme Economic Council, carried out its test flight. . . \"... The plane was built by a commission for the construction of metal planes consisting of the members: Chairman A.N. Tupolev, the author of the design and generally in charge of the work of the commission; Deputy Chairman I. I. Sidorin, who worked out methods of thermal treatment and processing of the material and carried out strength tests; scientists I.I. Pogoskii and G. A. Ozerov. \"Elaboration of methods of analysis, assortment of parts, shapes and design details of the planes, testing and direct supervision of production were in the hands of TsAGI engineers A. I. Putilov, V. M. Petlyakov, 1. 1. Pogoskii, B. M. Kondorskii, N. S. Nekrasov, N. I. Petrov, E. I. Pogoskii, A. I. Zimin and others. \"The test flight was performed on 26 May by TsAGI engineer N. I. Petrov, with sand for ballast. The flight was not experimental, therefore it was not timed; its aira was to find out the main flight characteristics of the plane. \"The plane took off three times altogether and accomplished five or six circles at an altitude of up to 500 m. Both by its behavior in the air and by its speed the machine proved its worth, and in the opinion of the many onlookers it is a valuable contribution to Soviet aircraft construction. \"* The ANT- 2 is the first-born among the Russian all-metal planes. In spring 1926 the first official tests were concluded of the first combat plane designed by A.N. Tupolev. This was the ANT-3, or R-3, an all-metal two-seater reconnaissance biplane, provided in serial production with a 400 hp, M-5 engine. In 1926 M. Gromov as the pilot and E. Rodzevich as the flight engineer, in a R-3 plane called Proletarii carried out a flight which at that time was an outstanding feat. They started from Moscow on 31 August and returned on 2 September, having flown the route Moscow-Konigsberg-Berlin- Paris- Rome- Vienna- Warsaw-Moscow, i.e., 7000km in 34 hours flying time. On that flight the plane had a cruising speed of 200 kph. Gromov' s flight caused a sensation in Europe. In August 1927, alsoinaR-3 plane, named Our Reply, Shestakov as the pilot, with flight engineer Fufaev, flew the route Moscow- Tokyo- Moscow, about 22,000km, in 153 hours flying time. This was an outstanding achieve- ment and characterized not only the high level of the builders of aircraft and engines, but also the culture of production which ensured a high degree of Samolet No. 8, p. 12, 1924. reliability in the operation of all parts of the aircraft and engines and the skill of the country's pilots. Gromov with a group of correspondents of Moscow newspapers carried out a flight in 1929 in a three-engined ANT-9j seating ten persons, visiting the capitals of European countries, landing in Berlin, Paris, Rome, London and Warsaw. The length of this flight was 9000km, average speed was ISOkph. The entire Soviet and world press gave the highest praise for plane and pilot. After that the plane was put into serial production. For several years it was used on the routes of the Civil Air Fleet. A triumph of Soviet aviation was the flight of pilots Shestakov and Bolotov, navigator Sterligov, and engineer Fufaev in a metal airplane ANT-4. called Soviet Land, from Moscow to New York in the fall of 1929. Although this flight took more than a month because out of a total length of the route of 21,500 km, 8000 km were over the ocean and much time was spent on replacing the wheel-type landing gear by floats, this was the first flight of Soviet flyers in a Soviet plane with a Soviet engine to America. Thus it was an outstanding achievement. The flights of Soviet aviators in various planes of Soviet manufacture were a stringent test, and they proved that Soviet technical thinking and production know-how did not lag behind the West. Now emerged the problem of selecting for mass production those planes and engines of Soviet design which had withstood the tests. This was very important for defense. In 1927 in its appeal \"To all organizations of the VKP(b), to all workers and peasants\" the Central Committee of the Party said: \"it is necessary to improve socialist industry, raise productivity of labor, resolutely carry out socialist rationalization of production, improve agriculture, improve and strengthen transport, it is necessary to raise and develop the military industry for the defense of the country. . . \"* Among the keynotes to the \"Defense Sunday,\" organized in 1927, the Central Committee of the Party included the appeals: \"Let us build up the military industry'. We will give entire units of planes and tanks'. We will raise the output of rifles and machine guns'. The Soviet land must become an impregnable fortress'. \" \"Workers and peasants'. Join the ranks of Osoaviakhim'. Help defend the Soviet Union in an organized manner'. \"** Toward the end of the twenties conditions were favorable for the broad development of the production of airplanes, engines, instruments, and of new aircraft materials. The problem of building a powerful aircraft industry had to be solved in all its ramifications. It was solved in the years of the First Five- Year Plan.

SOVIET PLANES, SOVIET ENGINES In the years of the prewar five-year plans a powerful aircraft industry was created in the Soviet Union thanks to the unstinting efforts of the Party, the government and all the people. The Red Air Fleet was completely equipped with Soviet -made machines. Modern plants were built, research institutes and design offices were organized, and scientists, designers and aviation specialists were trained. On the basis of modern science and technology new types of fighter, attack and bomber aircraft were developed and put into serial production in the early forties. The war found the aircraft industry engaged in developing mass production of modern types. Although at the beginning of the First Five- Year Plan the Soviet aircraft industry had already completely abandoned the copying of captured planes and production under license, and had changed over to the production of Russian aircraft, engines and instruments, the chief task in the Five- Year Plan was improvement and preparation of mass production. In June 1929 in its resolution \"On the state of defense of the USSR\" the Central Committee of the Party noted: \"It must be conceded that one of the most important results of the past five years is the creation of a Red air fleet. An important task in the coming years in building up the Red aviation will be a rapid improvement of its quality to the level of the most advanced bourgeois countries, and every effort must be made to plant the seeds, cultivate and develop our own, Soviet scientific and design cadres, especially in engine construction. \"* Under these circumstances it was found that the Five- Year Plan of Economic Development provided favorable conditions for considerably increasing the defense potential of the USSR. During the previous five years firm organizational foundations of the army were laid; now the most urgent task was the creation of a modern base of military technology. The Central Committee of the Party found it correct and timely \"to develop on a broad front the work of strengthening and improving the technical equipment of the army. \"** At the beginning of the First Five- Year Plan both design centers of the country were considerably strengthened: TsAGI, which was headed by A.N. Tupolev, and the Design Bureau headed by N.N. Polikarpov. In the early thirties Tupolev' s design office was removed from TsAGI and established as an independent experimental and design organization. TsAGI continued with scientific research while Tupolev's design office worked out new types of aircraft. Tupolev attracted and trained an entire group of scientists: A. A. Arkhangel'skii, V. M. Myasishchev, V. M. Petlyakov, A.I. Putilov, P.O. Sukhoi and others. Later on they themselves developed and designed new types of aircraft. * KPSS voomzhennykh silakh Sovetskogo Soyuza (The CPSU on the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union), p. 320. ♦• Ibid., p. 319. 8 Tupolev's design office specialized in building multiengined dural bombers and passenger planes. Polikarpov's office designed new fighter models. Approximately for ten years Soviet fighter units were equipped almost exclusively with his machines. In addition to the powerful offices headed by Tupolev and Polikarpov there were also smaller design offices. A team headed by D. P. Grigorovich worked on types of engines suitable for fighters. Some of them, e.g. , 1-2 and 1-2B, were produced in small quantities during the late twenties. In the Ukraine K. A. Kalinin designed and supervised construction of the K-5 passenger plane. A. S. Yakovlev's design office worked on low-powered planes. Production of the following engines also was introduced: M-22, radial, air-cooled, 480hp and M-17, water-cooled, 500hp. By 1930 the basic types of aircraft and aircraft engines had been tested in operation and were being produced in Soviet plants from Soviet materials by the hands of Soviet workers and technicians. The army air force received small numbers of 1-3 fighter planes and R-5 reconnaissance planes, designed by Polikarpov, and TB-1 bombers, designed by Tupolev. Prototypes of new and improved types of combat aircraft were being prepared for serial production. One of the first Soviet fighters, the 1-3, a wooden biplane, was built as early as 1927. With a M-17 engine it developed a speed of 280kph. Its armament consisted of two machine guns. Altogether four hundred planes of this type were produced. The 1-5, produced in 1930, was a further development of the biplane. It was a light, maneuverable fighter powered by a M-22 engine, with a speed of 286 kph. It was also armed with two machine guns. The 1-5 was produced in larger numbers, about eight hundred. Polikarpov's outstanding design, the two-seater R-5 reconnaissance plane, powered by a M-17 engine, was widely used by the army air force. This wooden biplane with fabric wing covering and plywood fuselage skin proved exceptionally successful. For its time it had an excellent maximum speed, 230 kph. The wings were connected by N-shaped streamlined struts and steel bracing. The upper wing was fixed to the wing center section, mounted on the fuselage by two pairs of drop-shaped, cross sectioned struts. The aerodynamically refined shape reduced resistance, yielding excellent mechanical and flying characteristics. The R-5 was an outstanding combination of adaptability to fulfill tactical tasks, reliability and technological design, good stability and dirigibility, simplicity of piloting and operation. Flight tests of the R-5 began in 1928, and in 1931 serial production of the plane began. Within six years about seven thousand planes of different versions were built. The Soviet air force received a splendid reconnaissance plane which had no equal anywhere in the world. In September 1930 a group of R-5 planes excelled in carrying out a flight on the route Moscow- Ankara-Tbilisi-Teheran-Termez-Kabul- Tashkent-Orenburg- Moscow. The distance of 10,500km was covered in 61 hours 30 minutes flying time, at an average speed of 171 kph. At that time the Iranian government issued an international tender for reconnaissance aircraft for the Iranian air force. In competition flights the R-5 won first place, outstripping the best British, French, and Dutch aircraft. The R-5 was widely used in military and civil aviation for many years, including those of World War II. After having flown for a long time and having been used for various purposes, the plane was eventually- superseded by another excellent aircraft designed by Polikarpov, the U-2 (Po-2). The basic version of the R-5 as reconnaissance plane or light bomber carried three machine guns and could take on 500 kg of bombs. Other military versions were the sea reconnaissance plane fitted with floats, the R-5Sh attack plane with seven machine guns and the modernized version with covered cockpit, the R-Z. Civil aviation used widely the P-5 and P-5a mail and passenger versions. In 1934 R-5 planes participated in saving the members of the Chelyuskin expedition. The pilots in their two- seaters took off from the ice with five of six passengers on board. In 1925 Tupolev's plane TB-1 (ANT-4) underwent tests; this was the first Soviet-built heavy bomber and one of the largest planes built in the twenties. The overall design of this plane was a veritable revelation to world aviation. The TB-1 was an all-metal monoplane powered by two M-17 water-cooled, wind-mounted engines. The main innovations were the cantilever wing with five spars and corrugated dural covering and its thick profile. Analysist and design of the wing were the work of V. M. Petlyakov who succeeded in ensuring high strength and rigidity of that large wing whose span was 28.7 m. The low wings made it possible to employ a comparatively small landing gear with wide track. By filling the thick wing with a large amount of fuel, the designers endowed the aircraft with outstanding load capacity and range. With a maximum take-off weight of about 7.8 tons, the TB-1 could carry a payload of 3.5 tons. The normal weight of bombs was 1000kg and the range was then 1350 km. The plane had a good speed, 200 kph. It carried a crew of four and its defensive armament consisted of four machine guns. The TB-1 was the first plane to be fitted with boosters, which considerably reduced the take-off distance and facilitated lift-off of the overloaded aircraft. Between 1928 and 1932 the TB-1 was series-produced in land and seaplane versions. It marked the beginning of a new era in the development of heavy aircraft and is considered as the first genuine bomber. Similarly, all heavy, nonmaneuverable aircraft (bombers and transport planes) were built as monoplanes with cantilever wings. A logical development from the design of the TB-1 was the gigantic bomber type TB-3 (ANT-6), first built in 1930 and series-produced from 1932 to 1937. This plane was a four-engined, cantilever-winged monoplane. The four engines (first M-17, then M-34) were mounted on console trusses on the leading edge of the wings, two on each side of the fuselage. The wings, fuselage and tail unit were made from duralumin; the fixed landing gear, engine trusses and other parts from steel; the outer covering of the entire aircraft was, as before, corrugated duralumin. Compared with the TB-1, the wing span was almost half as large, attaining the enormous magnitude of 40.5 m, and the wing area was doubled to 230 m^. During development and production Tupolev improved the design of the aircraft and increased the engine power. He thereby succeeded in raising the take-off weight of the TB-3 to 19 — 21 tons and the speed to 288 kph, each engine providing 970hp. The TB-3 could carry 5 tons of bombs. With a bomb load of 2 tons the TB-3 had a range of almost 2500km. It had a crew of eight, its defensive armament was eight machine guns. During the mid-thirties the USSR was the only country mass producing such huge aircraft as the TB-3. Tupolev himself supervised the preparations for production, having been nominated chief engineer of the administration 10 of the aircraft industry of the People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry. The TB-1 and TB-3 had a decisive influence on the further development of bomber aircraft^ both in the Soviet Union and abroad, especially in the United States. These bombers blazed the trail for building heavy landplanes and they predetermined for many years the most rational configuration. In the ten years preceding the war the Soviet bomber force was supplied with 216 TB-1 and 818 TB-3 planes. They were also used in civil aviation as transport planes (G-1 and G-2) for heavy and bulky loads, especially their arctic version. In an ANT-4 pilot A. V. Lyapidevskii rescued the first group of the Chelyuskin crew in 1934. In 1937 I. D. Papanin's expedition to the North Pole took place in four ANT- 6 planes. Mass production of aircraft required the production base to be enlarged and new, large aircraft plants to be built; the Central Committee of the Party therefore adopted a resolution on the building of large aircraft, engine and instrument plants. By 1933 these plants, which had been started at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, already supplied aircraft in large numbers: the 1-5 fighter, the R-5 reconnaissance plane, and the TB-3 bomber. The aircraft industry grew out of the industrial base of the country, assimilating its foremost achievements, mainly in the fields of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, radio and electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, instrument manufacture, and chemistry. The qualitative and quantitative level of aviation at that time was therefore a lucid reflection of the growth of the entire national economy. The country, however, could not rest satisfied with its achievements. The resolution of the 16th Party Congress noted with satisfaction the heightened fighting efficiency of the Red Army. On the other hand the congress pointed emphatically to \"the necessity of concentrating the Party's attention on an even greater mobilization of all the forces of the working class and the mass of small and medium peasants upon strengthening the defense potential of the USSR, the power and fighting efficiency of the Red Army, Navy and Air Force.\"* The further strengthening of the defense potential of the country required even greater activity of the broadest masses of workers. The resolution of the Central Committee \"Ten Years of Defense\" said that it is essential \"to turn the attention of the working people to the problems of building civil aviation, airship construction, mechanization and motorization of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army,\" and to \"strengthening the organization of Osoaviakhim (cadres, growth, material base, etc. ). \"** The necessity of constantly improving aviation techniques required a broad development of scientific research in aviation. TsAGI, where research on aerodynamics, aviation materials, and aircraft engines was carried out, was a universal scientific organization in its field, and it became necessary to split it up into independent specialized research institutes. In addition to the Special Design Bureau under chief designer Tupolev, two other departments also left TsAGI and became independent. The department of aviation materials became the All- Union Insitute of KPSS o vooruzhennykh silakh Sovetskogo Soyuza (The CPSU on the Armed Forces of the Soviet UnioiO, p. 322. Ibid. , p. 328. Aviation Materials (VIAM) and the aircraft engine department became the Central Institute of Aircraft Engine Construction (TsIAM). Within an exceedingly short time these organizations attained a high scientific level. The question of personnel was of decisive importance for the plants, institutes and all other institutions of the aircraft industry. There was a shortage of prerevolutionary specialists as well as of young graduates of the Military Aviation Academy. Most graduates of the academy joined the flight units of the air force. In 1930 MAI was founded. Within a short time it became one of the best institutions of higher learning in the country; it trained aviation engineers for the most diversified fields. When summing up the results of the First Five- Year Plan, the Party proudly noted the success achieved in the building of the aircraft industry. The resolution of the joint session of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of 10 January 1933 mentioned among the gigantic engineering works the aircraft and aircraft engine plants in Moscow, Gorki, Voronezh, Siberia. * The resolution of the 17th Party Congress (January — February 1934) counted the building of aircraft and aircraft engine plants, one of the new branches of production, as one of the particularly great successes of industry. ** As a result aviation was able to develop further quantitatively and qualitatively. During the Second Five-Year Plan (1933 — 37) the aircraft industry acquired all the necessary scientific know-how, based on highly trained personnel and powerful production which increased in size every year as new plants were built. Aircraft plants were planned by a special project institute which had been organized within the framework of the aircraft industry. Wherever it was possible, production of aircraft and engines was organized in flow lines and on conveyor belts. Pressing and casting of parts were introduced on a large scale. This led to a considerable increase in the productivity of labor and output. Simultaneously, owing to the achievements of the research institutes and design offices, the flight and tactical characteristics of the aircraft were also greatly improved. Until the mid-thirties the USSR developed both heavy, nonmaneuverable monoplanes with fixed landing gear and corrugated skin (bombers TB-1, TB-3, and passenger planes) and light maneuverable biplanes (fighters and reconnaissance planes). In the middle thirties a decisive and final change- over from biplanes to monoplanes took place. This was because of the achievements of aerodynamics, mechanics and engine construction, accurate methods of stress analysis, and the introduction of new high-strength materials. For some time maneuverable biplanes still existed in the fighter force together with fast monoplanes, but by the end of the thirties the only biplanes built were the U-2 training planes. The changeover to monoplanes with cantilever wings was an important stage in the technical progress of aircraft construction. The monoplane is aerodynamically superior to the biplane, but at flying speeds of 200 kph — 250 kph this advantage is small. Further the sufficiently rigid and strong • KPSS V rezolyutsiyakh i resheniyakh s\"ezdov, konferentsii i plenum ov TsK (The CPSU in Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses, Conferences, and Plenary Session), Part II, p. 719, Moskva, Gospolitizdat, 1953. •• Ibid., p. 745. 12 airfoils in the form of the biplane cell have a small span and are simple in production. As flying speed increased, the aerodynamic advantages of the monoplane became more predominant, and new aircraft were built increas- ingly as monoplanes. At first monoplanes were provided with bracing or inclined struts, taking some stress off the wings; but bracing and inclined struts, placed in the air stream, caused considerable head resistance. As stress analysis was perfected and experience in design was gained, fast monoplanes with cantilever wings were built, where the wings had no outer supports. An important factor was the increased wing loading: 140kg/m^ — 170kg/m^ instead of 70kg/m^— lOOkg/m^ in monoplanes around 1930. Although leading speed, take-off distance and landing distance have increased greatly, a serious deterioration in take-off and landing characteristics was averted by the introduction of brake wheels and high- lift devices (flaps and slats). Flying speed was increased by reduced relative wing thickness and the application of biconvex profiles; streamlined fuselages and closed cockpits; fillets to reduce the deleterious interference at the joint of wings and fuselage; use of smooth, thick wing covering (plywood or metal) instead of the thin corrugated covering on heavy planes and fabric covering on light planes. By countersunk riveting, the use of sheet butt joints, the polishing of the covering, the aerodynamic friction drag was greatly reduced. One of the most important achievements of aerodynamics was the solution of the problem of retracting the landing gear in flight. The resistance of a fixed landing gear represents twenty to twenty-five percent of the total resistance of the aircraft. The designers therefore endeavored to retract the landing gear completely or partly in flight, even at the price of a certain increase in the weight of the aircraft (by one to two percent and a more complicated design. This problem was practically solved in 1935 — 36. The first stage was a fixed cantilever landing gear with spats (reducing the drag of the landing gear by about thirty percent), then the main struts were retracted, and finally also the tail wheel which replaced the skid. A fully retractable landing gear meant an increase of fifteen to twenty percent in maximum flying speed without increasing engine power. Flying speed was also increased by the introduction of cowling for engines and radiators. On air-cooled engines where the cylinder heads protrude into the air stream they were covered with narrow profiled streamlined rings (Townend rings), which reduced drag. Then special cowls were designed which reduced drag even more. On liquid- cooled engines the nose radiators, which were situated immovably in the air stream, were replaced by sliding radiators whose area could be reduced with increasing flying speed when the cooling action became more intensive. The next step was ducted radiators, with the ducts located in the wings, the fuselage, or the engine nacelle. All these measures reduced drag by one-third to one-half. Flying speed increased by twenty to thirty percent with engines of equal power. The appearance of controllable -pitch propellers also meant a qualitative improvement in aircraft construction. The fixed-pitch propellers, used until the thirties, were designed for some definite flying conditions. Under different flying conditions the efficiency of the propeller was reduced. At 13 flying speeds of 200kph — 250kph the losses were small, but with increasing speeds the difference between maximum and take-off speed increased, and this caused a considerable increase in loss of thrust of the power plant. The first solution was a two-pitch propeller whose blades could be adjusted to a small pitch for take-off and climbing and to a large pitch for maximum flying speed. Then appeared propellers with continuously adjustable pitch, controlled by a special lever, and finally automatic propellers whose blades are automatically adjusted such that the engine runs at the most advantageous speed all the time. Although controllable- pitch propellers are considerably heavier and more complicated than fixed-pitch propellers, they were used in high-speed aircraft because maximum speed increased by seven to ten percent, the ceiling by eighteen to twenty percent, take-off thrust by forty to forty-five percent, and range and rate of climb also increased. Technical progress of aviation was bound up with the increase in maximum-power altitude and engine power. The power of piston engines is greatly reduced at extreme altitudes, because the density of the air is reduced. Engines were therefore provided with single-stage or two- stage superchargers, increasing the pressure of atmospheric air before it entered the cylinders. Thus it was possible to maintain engine power up to the rated altitude. Supercharged engines also raised the maximum flying speed. Further, the possibility of engaging the supercharger low above the ground made it possible to boost the engine for a short time in case of need (difficult take-off conditions, aerial combat at low altitude). During the late thirties engine power was rapidly increased, together with a reduction in the specific weight of the engines. The power of series- produced engines rose from 700 hp or 800 hp to 2000 hp and the specific weight dropped from 0.9kg/hp to less than 0.5kg/hp, i.e., almost by one- half. At the same time considerable success was achieved in reducing the specific dimensions of the engines. All this contributed to increased speed, ceiling and range of Soviet aircraft. The motto of the Soviet government to \"fly highest, furthest and fastest\" met with an enthusiastic response from scientists, designers and employees of the aircraft industry. New aircraft constantly appeared on the experimental airfields: 1-15, 1-16, SB, DB-3, ANT-25 and other outstanding machines with which the Soviet aviators ensured a number of the highest aerial achievements for the Soviet Union. In 1933 — 34 Polikarpov designed and constructed a maneuverable biplane fighter, the 1-15, with maximum speed of 360kph, and a monoplane fighter 1-16 with retractable landing gear, having a maximum speed of 454kph. Both planes were powered by a air-cooled radial M-25 engine, 715 hp, with a well-designed cowling and controllable-pitch propeller. The aircraft was of mixed design, typically Polikarpov: wood, steel pipes, canvas skin, and in limited amounts duralumin. For the first time there was armor plating behind the pilot. The armament consisted of two synchronized 7.62 mm machine guns. The 1-15 and 1-16 appeared almost simultaneously and were also simultaneously in action. At that time it was believed that because of their insufficient horizontal maneuverability, monoplanes would have to operate together with biplanes. The former would catch up with the enemy and paralyze his actions while the latter would destroy him. This concept 14 was maintained until it was put to the practical test in Spain and on the Khalkhin-Gol, where it was found how difficult it is to organize the cooperation of fighters of different types under the rapidly changing conditions of aerial combat. In 1940 new high-speed monoplanes with powerful engines appeared: Yak-1, MiG-1, and LaGG-3; they were much superior to the best biplanes in speed and vertical maneuverability, making the rejection of biplanes final. Between 1934 and 1939, however, the 1-15 and 1-16, of which 6519 and 6555 machines (in different versions), respectively, had been built, represented the strength of the Soviet air force. They both underwent a long development and were excellent fighter planes. The 1-15 had outstanding maneuverability. The time needed to execute a turn at 1000 m was eight seconds, which was a record for fighters. The plane required six minutes to climbto 5000 m and the service ceiling was more than 9000 m. Regarding flight and technical specifications, especially vertical speed and horizontal maneuvers, the 1-15 was better than comparable types abroad. It was considered the best biplane fighter. In November 1935 V. K. Kokkinaki broke the world record when he attained an alitude of 14,575 m with a lightened 1-15. In the construction of the 1-15 new materials were used, such as chrome- molybdenum pipes and sheet electron. This ensured a comparatively low weight of the aircraft while the strength remained sufficient. The design of this plane offered great possibilities for further develop- ment. In 1936 the 1-15 bis with a maximum speed of 370 kph made its appearance. It was fitted with four synchronized machine guns, and unlike the 1-15 its upper wing was straight. In 1938 the 1-15 Z was built; it had incipient gull wings (and was later known as Chaika (gull)), and with its M-62 engine it attained 443 kph. Although it was a biplane, the aircraft excelled because of its streamlined shape and retractable landing gear. It proved its worth on the Khalkhin-Gol, where for the first time in addition to the four machine guns rocket missiles were also used. The 1-15 Z was the only series-produced Soviet biplane with retractable landing gear, and it was the best biplane fighter ever built. The 1-16 developed similarly. Polikarpov did not like \"transporting air,\" so he designed an original plane with minimum dimensions and low flying weight, 1422 kg. The 1-16 was characterized by a sturdy fuselage of circular cross section, \"trimmed\" in front, and small low wings. The plane had a wingspan of 9 m and was in total 6 m long. The dimensions and shape of the plane remained unchanged for years of development, only in the last series was the cockpit fitted with a movable canopy. The 1-16 was the first high-speed monoplane with retractable landing gear and a controllable-pitch propeller accepted by the Soviet air force. With a M-25 engine its speed was 170kph greater than the speed of the 1-5 and 90kph greater than the speed of its contemporary maneuverable biplane, the 1-15. Its speed also exceeded the speed of contemporary fighter planes in other countries. In the subsequent years the power of the engines, fitted in the 1-16, was gradually increased up to lOOOhp and the maximum speed of the plane to 525 kph. New series with more powerful armament were produced. The attack plane version of the 1-16 could carry up to 200 kg of bombs, and its armor-plating was reinforced. After four or five years of development, however, the take-off weight and wing loading increased by about thirty percent somewhat reducing the plane's maneuverability. A shortcoming of 15 the 1-16 was its small reserve of static stability, making the plane difficult to control and requiring highly skilled pilots. Nevertheless in the first year of World War II the Soviet airmen flying 1-16 planes self-sacrificingly took on Messerschmitts which had a superior speed. Many famous airmen began their careers in I-16's, in Spain, in Mongolia, at the fronts in World War II. Among them are G. P. Kravchenko, twice recipient of the Hero of the Soviet Union, B. F. Safonov, and A. V. Vorozheikhin. The first series-produced Soviet frontline bomber was the SB, designed and constructed in 1934 by Tupolev. It had two M-lOO engines of 860 hp each, was completely made of duralumin, with smooth covering, unlike the earlier Tupolev planes which had corrugated skin. Maximum speed of the SB was 420kph, range 1000 km, bomb load 500 kg, and it carried a crew of three. Only a year after the SB the high-speed, long-range bomber DB-3, designed by S. V. Ilyushin, made its appearance; it was powered by two air-cooled M-85 engines. The DB-3 was. an all-metal plane, with a streamlined fuselage, a monocoque of oval cross section, at the rear smoothly blending into the keel, in front into a semisphere. The two- spar cantilever wing had a smooth dural skin. Inside the wings there were large fuel tanks, and the weight of the fuel reached as much as twenty- seven percent of the flying weight. The plane had a crew of three and its armament was three machine guns. The DB-3 became the main Soviet long-range bomber, flying successfully throughout World War II, renamed the 11-4; however, the 11-4 clearly differed from the DB-3. Instead of M-85 engines of 765 hp each it was fitted with M-88B engines of llOOhp, and its speed increased from 320kph to 445kph. For the same distance, 4000km, the II- 4 could take on 1000 kg of bombs, i. e., twice as much as the DB-3, its take-off weight increased somewhat, reaching 10 tons, and wing loading was increased from 140kg/m^ to 150kg/m^. Early in World War 11, when there were difficulties in the supply of metal, the designers succeeded in replacing some of the metal assemblies of the 11-4 with wooden ones without harming the flight performance. The II- 4 was better in every respect, especially in range, than its counterpart, the German HE- 111 bomber which had a range of 2300km. In total 6784 planes, type DB-3 and II- 4, were built. Before the war V. K. Kokkinaki established several outstanding height records in a DB-3, exceeding with a load of 500kg and 1000kg 12 km, and with a load of 2000kg 11km. He also carried out several long flights, the most famous of which was his flight to the United States, a distance of 8000 km, II-4 bombers were the first to raid Berlin in August 1941. In 1932 Tupolev' s design office began work on the ANT-25 (or RD) which later, in the summer of 1937, gained world renown when Chkalov, Baidukov and Belyakov flew nonstop from Moscow to the United States, covering a distance of more than 9000 km in 63 hours flying time. The fame of the RD aircraft was enhanced by Gromov, Yumashev and Danilin, who a month later repeated this feat but covered more than 11,000 km in 62 hours flying time. The success of the flight was mainly due to the high reliability of the engine. The RD is an all-metal monoplane with a large wingspan, powered by one AM-34 engine designed by Mikulin. There were attempts to use this aircraft 16 as a long-range bomber, but this was not successful because of the plane's low speed at approximately 200 kph. Between 1930 and 1938 Tupolev supervised the design and construction of prototypes of all-metal multiengined aircraft, the ANT- 14, ANT- 16, ANT-20. An extreme example of this trend in Soviet aircraft construction was the eight-engined gigantic ANT-20, called the Maxim Gorki, which made its first test flight in June 1934, piloted by M. M. Gromov. The load capacity of the Maxim Gorki was eighty passengers, maximum speed 2 80 kph, range 2000 km. During the thirties Soviet aviation and its people, designers and especially pilots, gained much fame, having provided outstanding examples of courage and heroism. In 1934 the disaster with the icebreaker Chelyuskin occurred. The ship was lost in the Arctic ice, and more than one hundred persons spent the winter in the icy \"Shmidt camp. \" The polar explorers were in deadly danger. The whole country, the whole world watched the rescue operation. After the inhabitants of the ice floes had been flown to the Continent, the Soviet government for the first time bestowed the highest award, the title Hero of the Soviet Union, on seven aviators who had distinguished themselves in the rescue of the Chelyuskin expedition: Lyapidevskii, Levanevskii, Molotov, Kamanin, Slepnev, Vodop'yanov, and Doronin. This was an era of aviation triumphs. At no time before had aviation ever occupied such a place in the life of the Soviet Union. Soviet pilots entered the world arena of aerial competition. The successes of Soviet aviation were founded on the creative endeavors of designers and on the rapidly growing aircraft industry. / On 21 May 1937 Vodop'yanov landed for the first time in history in the vicinity of the North Pole. The popular Soviet pilot Vladimir Kokkinaki established several height records in llyushin's planes. Three women, pilots Grizodubova and Osipenko and navigator Raskova, established the women's world record of long-distance nonstop flights. As happens some- times in such cases, the enormous achievements in aviation caused not only a natural feeling of pride but also gave rise to smugness. It was widely believed that both sports aviation and combat aviation were firmly entrenched as the world's best. This mood found its expression in the speech by the People's Commissar of Defense at the 18th Party Congress in March 1939. \"Air Force personnel,\" said the People's Commissar of Defense K. E. Voroshilov, \"increased since 1934 by 138 percent, i.e., almost two- and- a-half times. The number of aircraft increased by 130 percent, i.e., it more than doubled. \"if we express the growing might of the air fleet in horse powers of aircraft engines in comparison with 1934, we obtain an increase by 7,900,000 hp, i.e., an increase of 213 percent over that of five years ago. \"With the quantitative growth of the air fleet its qualitative aspect also changed. \"Here are some data to support this (see table next page). \"What is very important, during that time the proportions of the different types of aircraft within the air force also changed. Heavy bombers increased from 10.6 percent to 20.6 percent, an increase of twice the former share. 17 Light bombers and attack and reconnaissance planes dropped from 50.2 percent to 26 percent, a reduction of one-half. Fighters increased from 12,3 percent to 30 percent, a two -and-a-half- fold increase. Thus the proportion of types of aircraft doubled in favor of bombers and fighters. Fighters Bombers (short-range) , Bombers (long-range) Reconnaissance and attak planes Incre ase in speed of ceiling of ran by 56.5'7o 21.5 \"yo - by 88'5'o 83'i'o 50% by 70% nfo 61% by eT^o 2Z1o 45% \"That means that Soviet aviationhas become more powerful and its striking power has increased correspondingly . . . \"... 1 may announce that frequently now one finds on our military airfields not only fighters but also bombers with speeds far exceeding 500 kph and a ceiling of 14 — 15 thousand meters. . . \"* These data, however, did not reflect accurately the state of the Soviet military aviation. That the proportion of light bombers and attack and reconnaissance planes had been cut to one-half was represented as an achievement demonstrates this inaccuracy. A heavy price had to be paid during the war for having underrated this kind of aircraft. During the Spanish civil war the first serious signals indicating the danger of boastfulness and smugness were received, warning the workers in the aircraft industry. When General Franco, supported by interventionist army units and arms of Hitler and Mussolini, unleashed the civil war, the Soviet people, together with progressive people from many countries, came to the aid of Republican Spain. Soviet volunteers with their armament, including aviation, left for Spain in fall 1936 in order to fight in the ranks of the International Antifascist Brigade. In their book \"986 Fighting Days\" the Spanish authors M. Ascarate and H. Sandoval wrote about this period: \"In the days of the most terrible danger Madrid received unexpected help. \" \"For the first time planes appeared in its sky which did not spread death; they brought salvation for the children and women of Madrid; they were chattos (snubnoses) and moscas (midges). \"Ascending to the roofs of their houses, standing on balconies and leaning out of windows, Madrid's inhabitants waved with shawls to welcome the friendly pilots, and they cried — this time for joy'. \"At the end of October the first planes arrived in Spain, and a few days later they already flew over Madrid; thanks to them the Spanish and Soviet airmen of the 'Celebrated' squadron were able to repulse the criminal raids of the Italian and German air forces. \"That same month the first fifty tanks arrived; now the Republican infantry had armor, enabling attack on the enemy. • XVIII s\"ezd Vsesoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), Stenograficheskii otchet (The 18th Congress of the All- Union Communist Party (b), Shorthand Protocol). — Politizdat, p. 194— 195. 1939. 18 \"The Soviet volunteers who came to Spain rendered the people's army- invaluable help because of their experience, with their advice and their great heroism. Among a host of heroes the following were particularly outstanding: Voronov, Batov, Malinovskii, Pavlov, Kuznetsov, Meretskov, Rodimtsev, Serov, Smushkevich, Khol'zunov, Minaev who fell in the defense of Madrid, Gorev, Ptukhin, Krivoshein, Smirnov, Nesterenko and many others.\"* At first the Republican airmen fought successfully in 1-15 and 1-16 fighters, called \"snubnoses\" by the Spaniards, and SB bombers which received the name \"Katyusha. \" The German and Italian air forces, repre- sented during the first stage of the war by obsolete Fiat and Heinkel fighters and Ju-86 bombers, suffered much damage. In 1936 the I-15s and I-16s encountered Messerschmitts for the first time. These were the first Me-109B fighters powered by 610hp Junkers Jumo-210 engines. Their speed did not exceed 470kph. The Soviet fighters were as fast as the Messerschmitts and their armament was about equal, 7.62 mm machine guns. The Soviet planes were more maneuverable, and the Messerschmitts suffered serious losses. This situation strengthened the feeling of satisfaction, and the moderniza- tion of the Soviet fighter force was not considered urgent. The Hitlerites, on the other hand, based on the first aerial battles in Spain, began improving their aviation with feverish haste. They radically iinproved their Me- 109, powering it with a Daimler-Benz -6 01 engine of 1100 hp, which increased the speed of the plane to 570 kph, and arming it with a 20 mm cannon, increasing the firing power of the fighter. This version of the Messerschmidt, the Me-109E, went into serial production. Some of the first Me-109Es were sent in August 1938 to Spain, where they took part in aerial fights of the final phase of the Spanish tragedy under the command of the best German fighter pilot Melders. The Me-109E had a decided advantage over the 1-16, both in speed (100 kph faster) and caliber and range of its firearms. The Germans made better use of the experience gained in the Spanish war than the Soviet Union. New fighters. Yaks, MiGs, LaGGs, able to hold their own against the Messerschmidts, appeared as late as 1940 as prototypes. A comparison of the SB bomber in speed and bomb load with the Ju-88 was also unfavorable to the USSR. The Hitlerites had superior bombers. The Soviet dive-bomber Pe-2, like the new fighters, had only its prototype ready in 1940. A plane cooperating with ground forces, similar to the German Ju-87 dive-bomber, practically did not exist in the Soviet air fleet. At that time A. B. Yumashev and other pilots broke several world records for loads, flying Soviet-made heavy bombers. These records of having the largest load capacity were characteristic for the heavy Soviet aircraft and were creating a great sensation. The task of the bomber is not only to lift the bombs but also to deliver them quickly to the target; yet the heavy Soviet bombers were very slow and their range was also insufficient. Further, everybody at that time was overwhelmed by the maneuverability of the fighters, believing that this was the decisive quality. Yet it was not taken into account that a fighter plane must first overtake the adversary and then destroy him. What is required is not so much maneuverability as • Ascarate, M. and Kh.

[Russian translation. ] 19 speed and firing power, but the Soviet planes in serial production from 1937-38 had neither. At the beginning of 1939 anxiety arose in the Soviet Union because of the backwardness of the air force. The capacity of the aircraft plants, built in the two first five-year plans, was sufficient for the mass production of planes, engines and instruments. The potential of the Soviet aircraft industry was sufficient regarding the number of combat aircraft produced. The problem was that these aircraft were obsolete and were inferior to the standards required by modern warfare. When we compare the main types of Soviet planes in serial production at the beginning of World War II, i. e., in 1939, with the corresponding German types, the Soviet Union appears to be the worst. \"The combat and tactical qualities of the German planes were much better than of the Soviet planes which had been produced during the Second Five- Year Plan . . . Our 1-16 fighter had a maximum speed of 462 kph, and thus it was no match for the German bombers . . . \"* The lessons of Spain caused the government great anxiety. Only extraordinary measures could save the situation. At the beginning of 1939 the Central Committee of the Party and the government called a broadly attended conference of leading personalities connected with aviation: designers, inventors, managers, scientists, engineers and air force pilots. The conference was attended by designers V. Ya. Klimov, A. A. Mikulin, A. D. Shvetsov, S. V. Ilyushin, N. N. Polikarpov, A. A. Arkhangel'skii, the commander of TsAGI M. N. Shul'zhenko, the author of the present book, and many others. Those present were faced with the problem of how to overcome quickly the backwardness in aviation. As a result of the conference all those present were enjoined to consider the situation and to make concrete recommendations concerning the problems discussed. In spring of that same year, 1939, the second conference of aircraft designers took place in the Kremlin. The exact work of each design office was discussed and corresponding decisions were adopted. Conditions for the rapid designing and construction of various types of aircraft were ensured for the designers. The following took part in designing fighters: Mikoyan, Gurevich, Lavochkin, Sukhoi, Pashinin, Florov, Borovkov, Shevchenko, Kozlov, Polikarpov, Grushin, Yakovlev and Yatsenko. In 1939 the Defense Committee of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR adopted two extremely important resolutions. One concerned the building and reconstruction in 1939-41 of enterprises producing aircraft power plants and propellers. The second resolution dealt with the develop- ment of aircraft engine plants. Plans were made for building new plants and for the reconstruction of existing plants which should produce engines for combat aircraft. It was necessary at the beginning of 1941 to double the number of aircraft engine plants over that of 1939. To help engine construction, some enterprises were transferred from other branches to the aircraft industry, and production of aircraft engines was organized in some automobile plants. ** ' Istoriya Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny Sovetskogo Soyuza 1941—45 (History of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union 1941 — 1945), Vol.1, p. 453. -Moskva, Voenizdat. 1960. •• Ibid, pp. 412-414. 20 Prewar combat aircraft Type of aircraft Year of Engines (type, number, Take-off production take-off power) weight, kg Armament and bomb load Crew Maximum speed, kph „ , Altogether Range, km ° produced \"Fokker D-11\" 1922 M-6, 300 hp 1250 R-1 (DN-9A) 1923 M-5, 400 hp 2217 R-3 1925 M-5, 400 hp 2085 TB-1 1925 M-n, 2x500hp 7775 1-3 1927 M-17, 500 hp 1863 R-5 1928 M-17, 500 hp 2955 TB-3 1930 M-34RN, 4x 970 hp 21000 1-5 1930 M-22, 480 hp 1355 1-15 1933 M-25, 715 hp 1373 1-16 1933 M-25, 715 hp 1422 M-62, 1000 hp 1912 2 machine guns 7.62mm 3 machine guns 7.62 mm: 200 kg bombs 3 machine guns 7.62mm; 200 kg bombs 4 machine guns 7.62 mm; 1000 kg bombs 2 machine guns 7.62 mm 3 machine guns 7.62mm; 250 kg bombs 8 machine guns 7.62mm; 2000 kg bombs 2 machine guns 7.62mm 2 machine guns 7.62mm 2 machine guns 7.62mm 2 machine guns 20 mm 2 machine guns 7.62mm 225 200 207 198 280 230 288 286 362 454 525 575 300 750 2800 750 100 350 216 585 399 600 7000 2470 818 530 803 500 674 820 690 6555 RD 1933 M-34, 860 hp 11500 — 3 246 12411 2 SB 1934 M-IOOA, 2X860 hp 5732 4 machine guns 7.62mm; 500 kg bombs 3 424 980 6656 1-15 bis 1936 M-25V, 775 hp 1650 2 machine guns 7.62mm 1 370 770 2408 1-15 Z \"Chaika\" 1938 M-62, 1000 hp 1859 4 machine guns 7.62mm 1 443 695 3437 Thanks to the urgent measures taken by the Central Committee and the government, the production base of the aircraft industry was considerably strengthened and the number of design offices and institutions increased greatly. New people joined the teams of designers, working to create new, modern combat aircraft, mainly fighters. A fundamental turning point was reached in aircraft engineering. Consequently, within a short time, in one-and-a-half to two years, completely new and modern prototypes of fighters, bombers, and attack planes were produced and tested. The ground was prepared for their mass production. From among all the fighters ordered by the government work progressed best on the LaGG, MiG, and Yak types. These aircraft were tested almost simultaneously at intervals of two or three months. In May and June 1940, without waiting for the end of the tests and on the basis of preliminary results, all these types of aircraft were put into serial production. Equally extensive was the work to put 11-2 attack planes, 11-4 bombers and Pe-2 dive-bombers into serial production. The appearance of aircraft types n, Pe, MiG, LaGG and Yak did not only m.ark a fundamental rejuvenation of Soviet com.bat aviation by supplying it with modern fighters, bombers and attack planes, but it was also extremely important to the government that young and creative designers emerged. 22 Fighter Fokker D-11, 1922. 23 / 2 3 4 5 6 m Reconnaissance plane R-1 (DN-9A), 1923. 24 ^=u / 2 3 4 5 m Reconnaissance plane R-3, 1925. 25 V 2 4 6 6 10 m Bomber TB-1, 1925. 5768 26 r^^.

THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF AIRCRAFT CONSTRUCTION In its development Soviet aircraft construction based itself on the outstanding successes of Soviet science and technology. Problems of speed, range and ceiling were successfully overcome. Soviet aircraft was provided with first-class equipment, instruments and armament. Organization and planning of experimental and design work, including research in aviation, were improved. The ties between science and production became stronger; creative search became embodied in new models of combat aircraft. The high quality of Soviet aviation science and technology enabled Russian pilots to establish several outstanding world records. Before the war, when Soviet aviation was about to be reequipped, important organizational measures were implemented, for developing aviation science and rearranging the work of the design offices. In the 48 People's Commissariat of the Aircraft Industry the main administrations of experimental aircraft construction, of engine and instrument production, received additional specialists, principally from among the most prominent air force engineers. The management of TsAGI was also reinforced. In the thirties the Soviet scientists solved a number of important and fundamental problems of modern aviation to ensure rapid qualitative improvement of Soviet aircraft construction. Among the most important questions were undoubtedly the problems of spin and flutter. Spin confronted aviation at an early stage of its development. The unexpectedness of spin and the difficulty of pulling the aircraft out of it were for a long time a grave danger. As early as 1916 K. Artseulov, a pilot, deliberately made his aircraft go into a spin, laying the foundation of its practical study. In the twenties the problem of spin became most topical when crashes and disasters were found to have been caused by it. The scientists were required to solve quickly the question of \"how to design aircraft which would be safe from spin. The point was that as aviation developed, wing loading and flight altitudes increased, and thus spontaneous spin was observed with increasing frequency, which had troublesome consequences. For instance the first series-produced Soviet fighter, the I-l, made in 1923, under certain flight conditions had a tendency to pitch suddenly sideways and go into a protracted spin. A number of leading Soviet scientists investigated theoretically the question of spin, making it possible to analyze in detail the forces and moments acting on the aircraft under certain flight conditions and to work out the best ways of handling the aircraft to pull it out of the spin. The solution of the problem of spin is credited to two Soviet scientists who specialized in aerodjmamics, V. S. Pyshnov and A.N. Zhuravchenko. V. S. Pyshnov, then assistant at the Air Force Academy, in August 1927 published in the journal \"Tekhnika vozdushnogo flota\" an article titled \"Saznovrashchenie i shtopor samoletov\" (Autorotation and Spin of Aircraft). 37 In the history of aviation this was the first scientific theory of spin. In 1929 Pyshnov published this paper \"Shtopor samoleta\" (Aircraft Spin) which in detail explained the theory of spin and suggested a design of aircraft which would be easy to pull out of spin. He examined many problems of flight dynamics which would facilitate practical application. Various recommen- dations concerning the loading of aircraft, ensuring correct trimming, pulling out of and going into spin, reducing the tendency to spin, cured aviation of this ill. Pyshnov' s work was presented by the scientific and technical commission of the air force at the World Congress of Scientists in Tokyo in November 1929, and it was officially cited as the first fundamental treatment of the theory of spin, solving most of its mysteries. In 1934 and 1935 Zhuravchenko published two papers, \"Metody resheniya zadach shtopora i ustoichivosti, upravlyaemosti pri potere skorosti\" (Methods of Solving Problems of Spin and Stability, Controllability upon Loss of Speed) and \"Prognoz shtopora a deistvitel'nyi polet\" (Prediction of Spin and Efficient Flight). On the basis of this fundamental research by Soviet scientists changes in design were proposed and initiated. One of them was a change in the disposition and increase in surface of the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces. Designers began investigating flow about the wing and tail unit at large angles of attack. Before planes were put into serial production, they all underwent investigation of spin, and detailed instructions were worked out on how to handle them in spin. To study conditions of auto- rotation, TsAGI built a special wind tunnel with a vertical channel. The investigation of spin served as a basis for the study of any spatially unsteady motion of aircraft. During the early thirties, when flying speed began to exceed 350 kph, Soviet aviation was confronted with another previously unknown phenomenon, flutter. This was the name given to self- excited vibrations of wings and tail units with fast, spontaneously increasing amplitude. The aircraft often vibrated so violently that their structure suffered. The scientists were faced with the task of solving within a short time engineering methods of calculating the speed at which these vibrations may occur (critical speed), and to make practical recommendations for raising it. The founder of the theory of flutter and of the entire school studying this problem was the distinguished scientist M. V. Keldysh. As early as in the twenties V. P. Vetchinkin and S. A. Chaplygin studied the vibrations of wings in an air stream, and in 1931 a special group was set up in TsAGI to study vibrations of aircraft in flight, including self- excited vibrations. The investigations carried out in TsAGI by M. V. Keldysh, E. P. Grossman, A. I. Makarevskii and other prominent scientists showed that one of the causes of the natural vibrations is the insufficient rigidity of wings, tail units and fuselage. It was possible to shift the instant at which flutter occurred beyond maximum flying speed by increasing the rigidity of the structure and by adopting various design measures which were also recommended to designers. Subsequently these recommendations were consistently put into practice. There were recommendations for measures designed to raise the critical speed of flutter. Among them were: to increase the torsional rigidity of the wing and to increase the ratio of the frequency of torsional vibrations 38 to the frequency of flexural vibrations; to reduce the linear moment of mass inertia of the wing; to have the centers of gravity of the wing sections as far to the front as possible, e.g., by placing the loads in the wing-leading edge, and to move the centers of gravity of the ailerons to the front; to make the wings narrower; to increase the torsional rigidity of the ailerons and the parts of the tail unit; to increase the frequency of antisymmetric vibrations of the tail surface; to lighten the tail surfaces and move their centers of gravity forward. Scientists also developed methods of computing the critical speeds of torsional and aileron flutter of the wing and torsional and flexural empennage flutter in aircraft of different configurations. The accuracy of the methods was checked on models in wind tunnels and in flight. S. N. Anokhin, a test pilot, in 1934-35 checked the accuracy of the theoretical computations on a glider, and several other pilots did the same on high-speed aircraft. The glider or aircraft gained by dividing the speed at which, according to the computations, self- sustained vibrations should begin. Flight experiments confirmed that the theoretical assumptions were correct. On the basis of flight experiments and theoretical investigations temporary standards of the strength of aircraft were also worked out. Later on they were constantly revised on the basis of work carried out by V. P. Vetchinkin, A. M. Cheremukhin, A. A. Goryainov, S. N. Shishkin, V. N. Belyaev, A. 1. Makarevskii, M. V. Keldysh, and many other scientists. The standards also reflected phenomena that had just been investigated: flight in a turbulent atmosphere, flutter, compressibility, heating. New design features were also considered; stressed skin, swept wings, and so forth. Material- strength engineering developed as streamlined shapes and designs of aircraft changed by increasing speed, ceiling and unit load. The first series-produced Soviet biplane fighter, the 1-2, had in 1925 a speed of barely 230 kph and wing loading was 65kg/m^. Less than ten years later the monoplane fighter 1-16 had twice that speed, 454 kph, and wing loading of about lOOkg/m^. Yet another ten years later the Yak- 3 fighter attained a speed of 720 kph at about 200kg/m^ wing loading. This tendency was maintained, even into the jet era. Progress in aircraft construction is related to the adoption of new configurations and design features would be unthinkable without the pioneering efforts of material- strength specialists. Whereas in the early stages of development of Soviet aviation calculations and stress analyses were carried out according to primitive standards (from today's point of view) and were checked only by elementary static tests, later investigations of aeroelasticity were added to static stress analysis, with aerothermo- elasticity, the theory of thin-walled structures and shells following. Afterward fatigue tests on the ground and flight tests with strain gauges began. Important for the practical utilization of the scientific investigations and their technical application was the Designers' Handbook (Rukovodstvo dlya konstruktorov (RDK)) which unified methods of design, construction and testing of aircraft. This handbook was needed because the design offices did not use the same methods. Each office worked according to its own rules, and frankly, not always successfully. The only law obligatory for all covered the strength standards for aircraft. Everybody abided by it. Other methodolo- gical problems were not dealt with, and even the testing of aircraft in wind 39 tunnels was arranged by each designer in his own way. Procedures in designing, constructing and testing aircraft were not subject to any regulations. The work was not infrequently unsystematic, eventually causing great and sometimes unjustified expenditure of material and labor. As long as there were only two or three design offices in the country and they were as highly skilled as Tupolev's and Polikarpov's, they could somehow manage without regulations, although unified direction was even then advantageous. But when there were many design offices, it was unthinkable that they should work without a unifying methodological \"codex. \" All this was especially well understood when, as a result of the unsyste- matic and unorganized work in 1940 and 1941, several new aircraft crashed on test flights. The first edition of the RDK handbook was prepared in 1940 and published in 1941. The second edition, considerably revised and enlarged by more than one hundred fifty printing sheets, was published after the Soviet Union had entered the war. It incorporated the experience in design, construction and combat of the new generation of Soviet aircraft which appeared shortly before and during World War II— the Yak, La, and MiG fighters, the 11-2 attack planes, and the 11-4, Pe-2 and Tu-2 bombers. The first edition consisted only of five parts and the second edition in three volumes had no less than eleven parts: 1. Aerodyimmics 2. Hydromechanics 3. Strength of materials 4. Flight tests of aircraft and equipment 5. Engines 6. Aircraft equipment 7. Aircraft armament 8. Landing gear and mechanisms 9. Standard systems 10. Materials 11, Semiproducts. The first edition of the RDK handbook was prepared with the cooperation of leading scientists, designers and test pilots. The scientific editors of parts and chapters were I. V. Ostoslavskii, aerodynamics; L. I. Sedov, hydromechanics; S.N. Shishkin, strength of materials; A. I. Makarevskii, chapter on strength standards; M. V. Keldysh, chapters on dynamic and vibration investigations, and computation of flutter; A. V. Chesalov, flight tests, landing gear and mechanisms; V. I. Polikovskii, engines; G. V. Akimov and S. T. Kishkin, materials; N. I. Petrov, aircraft equipment; P. Ya. Zalesskii, armament; and A. T. Tumanov, materials. Authors of parts of the RDK handbook were M. A. Taits, N. S. Stroev, V. V. Kostochkin, G. P. Svintsev, A. A. Dorodnitsyn, V. V. Struminskii, and many others. The RDK handbook contains descriptions of wind tunnels and tests in them; requirements of wind-tunnel models of wings and aircraft and of mock-ups; data on the aerodynamics of wings; detailed recommendations for the selection of unit load, profile, etc. , for the design of the tail unit, controls, and ailerons, and for the arrangement of the power plant; basic characteristics and recommendations for the selection of propellers and the computation of their thrust; information on unified propellers; data on the 40 determination of the stability and controllability of the aircraft from model experiments, on the longitudinal and lateral stability of aircraft, and on the selection of horizontal and vertical tail surfaces. The chapters of the RDK handbook dealing with hydromechanics were extremely valuable to the designers of seaplanes. Here the experimental basin of TsAGI and experiments in it were described. Also hydrostatic computations were given, including the computation of unsinkability and hydrodynamic analysis of seaplanes. Especially detailed was the treatment of problems of strength of materials. In addition to the \"Strength Standards\" in the handbook, there are regulations for the extent and sequence of static and dynamic tests, for the determination of vibration characteristics, and for the computations of flutter. The treatment in the book excels by being detailed and instructive. An entire part of the RDK handbook deals with flight tests of aircraft and their equipment. Programs and documentation of the aircraft tests are given; tests for stability, controllability, maneuverability and spin; tests of the power plant, of equipment, of firearms and bomber armament, of the mechanisms of the landing gear, controls, and landing systems; and the instruments for flight tests are described. Several chapters of the RDK handbook deal with the engines and acces- sories and contain requirements and samples concerning design and methods of testing such systems as gas, oil, liquid cooling, suction, exhaust, radiators and cowlings, and control of the power plant. The most detailed chapter is \"Radiators and Cowlings\", because the optimum design of these parts is important for reducing the resistance of aircraft. The part of the handbook entitled \"Aircraft Equipment\" deals with flight and navigation instruments and electrical, radio, and high-flying equipment. It gives information on the obligatory nomenclature of instruments and equipment depending on the class of the aircraft, its tactical destination, crew, and number of engines. Standard arrangements of instruments in cockpits of fighters and attack planes are recommended. The subsequent section, \"Aircraft Armament\", consists of chapters on firearms and bomber, mine, and torpedo armament, rocket missiles, and armoring of aircraft. Interesting is the chapter dealing with rocket missiles; it is an abridged version of \"Kratkoe rukovodstvo po primeneniyu raketnykh snaryadov s samoletov\" (Brief Manual on the Use of Rocket Missiles Fired from Aircraft). Soviet aviation was the first in the world to be equipped with rockets and used successfully in the fighting on the Khalkhin-Gol. After that the rockets \"came down to earth\", becoming the terrifying Guard mortars, the \"Katyushas.\" The chapter also contains general instructions for the armoring of aircraft, information on armor plating and its charac- teristics. Finally there are technical recommendations for the design of armor parts and armored structures of aircraft. Particularly it is proved that armoring of the main types of combat aircraft-fighters, bombers, attack planes and reconnaissance planes — is obligatory. Those sections most vulnerable for the crew are protected by armor. The RDK handbook devotes much attention to the treatment of touch-down installations. In particular the problem is analyzed of standardization of control cabins in different types of aircraft and of location of armament in the bombardier's compartment and in the cockpits of fighters and attack planes. 41 Two sections of the RDK handbook contain descriptions of the physical and mechanical properties of the main aviation materials. This entire encyclopedia for aircraft designers^ rich in content^ was compiled within a short time. It played an eminent part in improving the work of the design offices and was a vital link connecting science and practice. The People's Commissariat of the Aircraft Industry gave high priority to organizing design offices and research institutes. The range of problems of research institutes was relieved of subjects that were not urgent and topical, and the scientists' work was oriented toward the solution of the most important problems, both short-term and long-term ones. Emphasis was placed on the construction of new wind tunnels with high air velocities and of gigantic laboratories for static and dynamic tests where designers could check the strength of aircraft on highly scientific lines. Everything was done to ensure that aircraft designers could utilize the latest scientific inve St igat ions . Design offices, research institutes and industrial plants made a supreme effort to ensure that the new models of aircraft and engines were series- produced as soon as possible. The introduction of new aircraft and techniques demonstrated the necessity to rebuild the radio industry, to create high- quality metallurgy, to reorganize tens or even hundreds of enterprises in various branches of the economy working for the aircraft industry. The prewar period is characterized by the parallel development of all- metal heavy aircraft with dural skin and light maneuverable aircraft of composite construction. As the raw-material base expanded and the Soviet aluminum industry developed, aluminum alloys were increasingly used. After having been tested on the experimental ANT-2 plane, the TB-1 (ANT-4) bomber was built; here the skin was made of corrugated duralumin-type sheet and was stressed in shear and torsion. After the TB-1 all bombers and their transport versions had metal skins, and beginning with the SB the skin also covered the fuselage and was fully stressed. Dural parts also found application in some cases in light combat aircraft (fighters and reconnaissance planes). On the whole, however, these aircraft had truss frames made of steel pipes with fabric skin and wings with wooden spars and fabric skin, later replaced by plywood skin. Emphasis was placed on cheap materials in ample supply; this proved to be best under conditions of mass production. Its justification became apparent during the war when the enemy occupied Zaporozhe and Volkhov, where the aluminum plants were located, thus stopping almost completely the production of aluminum for some time. When it was possible, still during the war, to resume production of aluminum in the Urals, duralumin was used more widely, including on fighters, e.g., the wooden spars were replaced by metal ones; this made it possible to reduce the weight of the structure and to increase the space available for fuel. The wing skin at first was made of plywood. Only toward the end of the war was it replaced by metal skin. In the thirties attempts were made to build passenger planes with frames of stainless steel sections. This trend, however, was discontinued because of the high cost of the material and technological difficulties. It is no exaggeration that even before the war Soviet aviation science and industry had accumulated vast experience. On the basis of the latest 42 achievements of science and technology, prototypes of first-class modern combat aircraft were built; however the problem was more complicated than just to build new models of aircraft, engines, various instruments, and to invent new materials. It was necessary to organize mass production of all these aircraft and everything else required, which was now on an incomparably higher level than before. The rapid mastering of the most advanced aviation techniques largely depended on the courageous and self-sacrificing work of the test pilots who often risked their lives to test the performance of aircraft under the most complicated and dangerous flight conditions. They were the most important and most highly skilled advisers of the designers. As a result of energetic and tenacious efforts, Soviet aviation was qualitatively renewed within a short time. Thanks to the measures taken, all the required types of combat aircraft were put into serial production. However, at the beginning of the war their output was still small. It was not possible to remedy the situation at the time Hitlerite Germany attacked the Soviet Union. 43 4. ^ WORLD WAR II World War II was a stringent test for the entire Soviet people and the Soviet army. The air force was in a particularly difficult position. Production of modern combat aircraft was not able to supply the required numbers at the beginning of the war. The aircraft industry overcame the difficulties caused by the sudden attack of Nazi Germany, evacuating entire enterprises to eastern districts of the country and raising the daily rate of armament production. In 1943 the Soviet aviation gained the upper hand in the air, having outstripped the enemy both in quantity and quality of aircraft. Toward the end of the war Soviet control of the air was complete; the remainder of the Luftwaffe turned to to dust. The spread of Nazi aggression in Europe led inexorably to the unleashing of war by Germany against the Soviet Union. The prewar atmosphere was also clearly felt in the Soviet aviation industry. At the beginning of 1941 the Central Committee and the government deliberated on how to improve the work of the aviation industry and strengthen the air force.

Zones of air defense with fighter aircraft, antiaircraft artillery and observation service were introduced. It was envisaged that most flyers would be taught to handle the new aircraft during 1941. The Central Committee and the government also dealt with partial and special problems. In winter 1940 the problem of the difficulties in operating the new high-speed fighters and bombers was discussed, because the snow had not been removed on airfields. Take-off on skis, technical difficulties of retracting the landing gear with skis, loss of speed because of the increased air resistsince — all this put the Soviet aircraft at a disadvantage against foreign aircraft. Although the air force command protested because it believed it impossible to remove the snow from the many field aerodromes, the Central Committee and the Soviet government proposed that henceforth aerodromes be cleaned and rolled.
