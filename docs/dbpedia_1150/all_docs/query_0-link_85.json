        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe Russian Far East ««\n\nA HISTORY\n\nJohn J. Stephan\n\nStanford University Press\n\nStanford, California\n\n»»\n\nTo\n\nJohn Albert White\n\n«« » »\n\nPreface\n\nThis\n\nvolume is an outgrowth of an interest kindled in 1964 by Professor John Albert White, who in a University of Hawaii course entitled \"Siberia and the Pacific\" led me to question the conventional insularity of Russian and Asian studies and to realize that Russian relations with Pacific Asia are inseparable from developments within the Russian Far East. Knowledge about the region is plentiful but fragmented. Geographers and economists have produced studies of resources, industry, trade, transport, and setdement. Anthropologists have examined aboriginal cultures. Strategists have tabulated divisions, ships, and missiles. Historians have written about exploration, revolution, foreign policy, collectivization, and labor camps. Biographers, diarists, novelists, and poets have personalized the past with varying doses of memory and imagination. Collectively these works fill several yards of shelf space, yet readers would be hard put to find anything that contemplates the Far Eastern experience holistically. As E. M. Forster once said, we know so much but connect so little. Since the early 1970s a general history ofthe area has been in preparation at theInstitute of History, Archaeology, and Ethnography ofPeoples ofthe Far East in Vladivostok, until 1991 directed by Andrei Krushanov. Called by a colleague \"the founder of a Far Eastern school of historiography,\" Krushanov was well qualified to oversee such an enterprise. For over three\n\nVIII\n\n«\n\nPreface\n\ndecades he managed a cottage industry of books, articles, and dissertations interpreting Far Eastern history in accordance with the most recent Party decree. To prepare what was envisioned as a four-volume History ofthe Far East USSR, Krushanov mobilized seventeen senior editors and over 250 specialists. Once launched, the bureaucratic supertanker moved sluggishly but gathered an inexorable momentum. The first two volumes came out well after the advent of perestroika, achieving instant historiographical obsolescence. Since then Krushanov, the Party, and the Soviet Union have passed from the scene, leaving the supertanker adrift. While Krushanov's heirs pondered what to salvage and what to scrap, minds unencumbered by ideological ballast darted ahead into uncharted seas. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk archivists and museum workers set up their own historical society and journal to address hitherto taboo issues about Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands. The president of the Society for Study of the Amur Region unlocked a row of skeleton-filled closets with archival keys. History buffs celebrated what they saw as the color, vigor, and piety of prerevolutionary Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Blagoveshchensk, and Nikolaevsk. Journalists publicized names of victims and perpetrators of Stalinist terror. As theeconomy collapsed, however, commercial forces increasingly impinged upon habits of composition, impelling some to write for the market and forcing others to put their works \"in the drawer.\" This attempt at a comprehensive history of the Far East, the first in any language, represents the culmination of a quarter- century ofresearch focusing at first on Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands and gradually widened to embrace the Priamur, the Primorye, and the Northeast (Kamchatka and Magadan districts). The sources are largely Russian, supplemented by Western, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean materials. Regional periodicals, newspapers, and interviews conducted since 1966 fill someof the lacunae in the secondary literature. The study draws from American, British, German, and Japanese archives for documentation relating to international trade, foreign communities, the Russo-Japanese War, the civil war, Allied intervention, Stalinism, frontier problems, the Second World War, and the Korean War. I did not have access to Soviet archives when the manuscript was in preparation; however, some wayward KGB files provided useful insights on the fates of Far Eastern intellectuals in the 19305, and private archives illuminated the vicissitudes of individuals and families under tsarist and Sovietrule. The growing accessibility ofrepositories in Tomsk (where Far Eastern archives for 1844-1939 were relocated in 1942), Khabarovsk,\n\nPreface\n\n»\n\nIX\n\nVladivostok, Blagoveshchensk, Magadan, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk should enable historians to write monographs that will form the basis of a more refined synthesis. In the meantime this volume offers a preliminary and perforcerudimentary sketch ofthe historical architecture of a region where Europe, Asia, and America come together.

A once supine appanage ofthe Center (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Petrograd, as the case may be) is redefining itself in both Russian and Northeast Asian contexts under the banners of capitalism and regionalism. As closed frontiers give way to entrepreneurial enclaves, some Far Easterners are articulating autonomist aspirations. Such assertiveness endows the Far East with a robust topicality that in turn nurtures our susceptibility to what Russian wits call the \"illusion of stormy activity.\" Visualizing the Far East requires a tolerance for ambiguity. Located at the interstices of conventionally defined regions, it awkwardly straddles parts ofthe Russian Republic, Northeast Asia, and theNorth Pacific. Moreover, it lacks a clearly defined periphery. At once within and distinct from Siberia, at onceconnected with and separate from China, Japan, and Korea, the Far East is a matrix of overlapping borderlands. To contemplate the Far East exclusively through either Eurocentric or Asiacentric prisms is to don blinkers. Just as we need to use both eyes for three-dimensional vision, so we needboth Asian and Russian perspectives tobehold the Far East in all its manifold identities.\n\n2\n\n«\n\nIntroduction\n\nDistinctions between domestic and foreign policy break down when applied to the Far East. Seen from metropolitan Russia, the Far East was variously a distant periphery, a colony, and a strategic base. Yet for those who lived there, the Far East had its own political, economic, and social dynamics. Local officials implemented and at times took initiatives toward Asia-Pacific neighbors. One governor-general negotiated an international treaty that altered Russia's frontiers. The Far East's relations with China,\n\nJapan, and Korea were not altogether unlike those betweenTexas andMexico.\n\nIronically, the Far East's cosmopolitan past bequeathed a parochial historiography. Linguistic barriers, intellectual conventions, and political agendas have insulated Russian, Soviet, Chinese, Japanese, and Western writing about the region. Post-Soviet authors have yet to free themselves from thehabit ofretrospectively russifying therecord ofFar Eastern discovery, colonization, and development. Nor are Chinese and Japanese works entirely free of national pretensions and irredentist subtexts. For their part, Western slavicists trained in a Eurocentric tradition tend to marginalize the Far East or to lose sight of it in Siberia. The Far East has been a meeting ground for diverse peoples and cultures for many centuries. Long before the dawn ofrecorded history, Northeast Asia served as a bridge for migrations between Inner Asia andNorth America. Neolithic communities in the Priamur and the Primorye shared affinities with counterparts in China,Korea, Japan, Siberia, andNorth America. A millennium of Chinese suzerainty and some 300 years ofRussian rule added new hues to a kaleidoscopic demography. Infusions of Mongols, Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese formed layers over a Paleosiberian and Tungusic aboriginal base. Immigrants from Europe and Asia created a mosaic of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Ukrainian, Cossack, Polish, German, Finnish, and Estonian communities. Cultural diversity did not prevent theFar East from acquiring a coherent regional identity after the creation of a unified administration in 1884. Russian penetration of northeastern China after 1896 sensitized Far Eastern merchants, professional people, journalists, and even military officers to divergences between imperial and regional interests. This awareness found scope for expression as metropolitan power collapsed during two revolutions, civil war, and foreign intervention, culminating in the creation of the Far Eastern Republic (FER) in 1920. Although the FER was absorbed into Soviet Russia in 1922, outiying areas retained their autonomy for two or\n\nIntroduction » 3\n\nmore years. Meanwhile, a cohort of former partisans, Party underground workers, and FER officials formed regional networks. The failure of the central Party apparatus to control these networks converged with Japanese continental expansion after 1931 to invoke the specter of Far Eastern secession in conjunction with \"traitors\" (Trotskyists, Rightists, Red Army commanders). Stalin andhis entourageexorcised the specter by balkanizing the regional administration, gelding the regional economy, and annihilating regional elites. What went wrong in the Far East? Why did it not develop like British Columbia or Hokkaido? How did such a rich land and littoral, settled by such talented and hard-working people, and bordering on such dynamic economies present a spectacleredolent ofa Third World basket case? Geography, demography, and economics provide partial answers. Beneath unfulfilled potentials runs an undercurrent of tragedy that cannot be ascribed to any ideology, party, or regime. The tragedy has a Russian-Soviet mother and an Asian-American father. Both parents wrought havoc on the region with the best of intentions: oppression in the nameof progress, militarization in the name of security, homicide in the name of race or class, ecocide in the name of growth. These destructive forces welled up from below as much as they descended from above. Thousands of ordinary people betrayed the land and one another out of idealism, envy, spite, greed, or fear. The Far East's sociocultural chemistry and geostrategic environment gave it a special place within Russia's tragedy. Far Eastern history casts in sharp relief human resilience in the face of adversity. Adversity on Russia's eastern periphery has commonly been defined in terms ofclimate, isolation, and coercion. But adversityalso took the form of exposure to the magnetic field of politically prescribed collective action. From the Primorye to Chukotka, individuals of different backgrounds kept their consciences intact in a political culture that turned the masses into accomplices. Although their behavior was not always consistent and their motives not always unambiguous, these people left accounts of what they saw, heard, and endured. From beneath the rubble of MarxismLeninism andsocialist realism is emerging testimony ofcompelling authenticity and power. Diaries, memoirs, letters, and family chronicles suggest how different were individual experiences of settlement, revolution, war, foreign intervention,collectivization, terror,stagnation, and perestroika. By rescuing such diversity from oblivion, this testimony opens the vaults of memory and holds up a mirror of self-knowledge.\n\n1 Geography and Prehistory Don't letthemscare you about landending here. Sakhalin is out there, and our planet's a sphere. Vladimir Vysotsky (1963)\n\n—\n\nimagination does not readily visualize the Russian Far East in eitherAsia or ifnot suggests that it is part of both. 1 Simultaneously comprising the northern periphery of East Asia and the eastern periphery of the Russian Republic, it has an elasticity inherent in the Russian term Dalny Vostok, which can refer to anything from a province to half the world. Russia's Far Eastern realm expanded and contracted over the course of over 350 years, leaving a legacy of intermittently contentious frontiers with indigenous Northeast Asian polities (China, Korea, Japan) and with a relative newcomer to the region — the United States. A Russian presence in Manchuria during 1896- 1954amounted to an extension ofthe Far East into China. Administrative vagaries have obscured the Far East's internal contours by including or excluding Yakutia andTransbaikalia.* In some contexts the entire Far East vanishes into Siberia's capaciousembrace. This study focuses on the Far Eastern core, an area of 1,201,400 square miles embracing the Priamur, the Primorye, the Okhotsk seaboard, Kamchatka, Chukotka, Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands (see Map 1). Yakutia, Transbaikalia, Russian America, and Manchuria receive attention to the extent that events transpiring in these areas have impinged on the core,\n\nOurgeography Europe, althoughhistory\n\n\"Transbaikalia and parts of Yakutia were periodically administered as part of the Far East before the Second World War. Since 1963, Yakutia has been in the Far Eastern Economic Region. Transbaikalia is in the Far Eastern Military District.\n\nGeography and Prehistory »\n\n9\n\nwhich formed a single administrative unitfor all but eighteen months from 1884 until 1938.\n\nEnvironments Extending roughly 3,000 miles from north to south and 2,000 miles from east to west, the Far East has a wide variety of environments. The Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Arctic Ocean, and the Pacific give the Far East's 16,000-mile littoral a range of maritime climates shaped by latitude, winds, and currents. Chukotka's stark scenery recalls that of northwestern Alaska, and the Primorye's green coastal hills are not unlike those of northern California. The warm kuroshio current combines with geothermally heated beaches to produce a \"Kurile Riviera\" on Kunashir Island. The southern Primorye is generally credited with the most liveable climate. Vladivostok has comparatively mild winters, and residents are fond of saying that their town has more sunny days than the Black Sea resort of Sochi. True enough, but its summer humidity rivals that of Calcutta. The Far Eastern interior, separated from the Pacific rim by mountains of 3,000 to 5,000 feet, has a continental climate, with hotter summers, colder winters, andless rain and snow than the littoral. Seasonal temperatures go to extremes. Yakutia holds the world record for cold outside of Antarctica. When the mercury there falls below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, alcohol thickens, steel cracks like glass, andexhaled breath turns to ice. Conversely, the August sun in Transbaikalia has beenknown to carbonizeroof shingles. TheSikhote Alin Range (\"Far Eastern Urals\") divides the Primorye into two ecological zones (see Map 2), each shaped by Asian monsoon winds blowing alternately from Siberia (October to May) and the Sea of Japan (June to September). The eastern, maritime slopes of the Sikhote Alin are favored with warmerwinters,more flowers, andfewer mosquitoes than the western (continental) slopes. Climatic differentiations occur among the hills of Vladivostok, which like San Francisco has its own microclimates. Fog may shroud the Golden Horn, the city's main harbor, when Amur Bay beaches across town are bathed in sunshine. The Ussuri taiga sustains a rich flora and fauna. Siberian conifers and birch are joined by oak, maple, walnut, and Korean cedar. Ginseng and tigers thrive in the Sikhote Alin Range. The former attracted people; the latter ate them, if one is to believe lore about peasants being pulled through izba windows and soldiers being snatched from marching columns. 2 In\n\nGeography andPrehistory »\n\n11\n\npoint of fact, tigers disconcerted rather than devoured nineteenth-century settlers. Unaccustomed to sharing space with humans, they prowled around farms and occasionally made themselves at home in outdoorprivies and bathhouses. Although buttons and a butterfly net were all that was left of an unlucky German lepidopterist in 1914,3 fang- toothed felines were more partial to puppies. Dogs vanished from the streets of Vladivostok in the 1860s, guaranteeing a niche for their predators in municipal nomenclature (Tiger Street, Tiger Hill, etc.). Hunted to the verge of extinction by the 19505, Ussuri tigers rebounded as a protected species, confirmed by pawprints and telltale canineremains in Vladivostok as late as 1986. In the early 19905, however, their numbers again fell as poachers catered to the Chinese market for tiger skins.4 Nature has richly endowed the Far East with boons and banes to man. Timber, minerals, fish, and pests abound. Übiquitous lakes and swamps offer ideal breeding grounds for vexatious insects. In Yakutia, mosquitoes (locally nicknamed \"fascists\") are said to suffocatereindeer by swarming up their nostrils. Clouds of gnus (\"vile\"), a collective sobriquet for winged piranha (gnats, midges, horseflies), have halted construction projects in the taiga. Nature in the Far East destroys on a spectacular scale. Unlike Siberian rivers, the Amur does not flow into the Arctic Ocean. Benefits accruing from this circumstance are periodically negated when, swollen by melting snow and monsoon rains, the \"Russian Mississippi\"5 turns into an inland sea and inundates thousands of square miles. Far Easterners respect Amur batyushka (\"FatherAmur\") andwatch its moods, especially in August when they follow water-level bulletins with the avidity of stock market brokers. When not flooded, the taiga can burn. In the summer of 1987 a conflagration along the upperAmur devastated an area four times the size ofAustria. Kamchatka and the Kuriles regularly experience volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tidal waves. In 1952 a fifty-foot tsunami demolished a town on Paramushir Island in the Kuriles. Permafrost covers 70 percent of the Far East, leaving a deep imprint on local lifestyles and severely restricting development. Within the zone the earth is frozen to a depth of anywhere from three feet to a mile below the surface. To deal with the \"active layer\" (the upper six to ten feet, which melts and refreezes seasonally), structures must be kept off the ground by pylons, and streets must have special roadbeds. Permafrost does have advantages. Water can be transported without pipes simply by drilling pas-\n\n12\n\n«\n\nASIAN\n\nECUMENE\n\nsages in the frozen ground, and in rain-scarce Yakutia permafrost retains groundwateressential to vegetation. Naturehas determined patterns of human settlement. In the Far East, as in Canada, people have traditionally clustered on arable lands along the southern fringe. As a result most Far Easterners have lived close to the frontiers of China, Korea, and Japan, a circumstance that has accentuated both cosmopolitan and xenophobic sensibilities.\n\nPrehistory The Far East could be the oldest part of Asia. Crystalline rock in northern Yakutia has been identified as the nucleus around which the continent formed nearly four billion years ago. 6 Two to three million years ago, magmatic activity at the juncture of continent and ocean formed Kamchatka and theKurile Islands. A million years ago, Northeast Asia had a temperate climate. Grass covered Chukotka, and conifers andchestnut trees grew on Kamchatka. 7 Starting about 500,000 years ago, a series of ice ages turned arctic grasslands into tundra and left the Priamur and the Primorye as taiga supporting mammoths, bears, tigers, and elk. By absorbing water, glaciers lowered the sea level so that land bridges formed from Korea along the Japanese archipelago and Chukotka to North America.8 Humans are thought to have lived in the Far East 300,000 years ago.9 The exact provenance ofthese people is still unclear, but they appear to have entered the Amur Basin from Mongolia andManchuria during warm intervals between ice ages when the Priamur and the Primorye shared analogous vegetation and climatic conditions with what is now northeastern China, Korea, and Japan. Such conditions partly explain the commonalities of Paleolithic artifacts excavated in the Priamur, the Primorye, North China, Korea, and Japan. Land bridges made possible migrations between Asia and America. About ten millennia ago, with land bridges submerged by rising sea levels, the Paleolithic ecumene gave way to several Neolithic variants, including a reindeer culture around Lake Baikal, a hunting culture along the Amur, and a maritimeculture along the NorthwestPacific littoral. Neolithic pottery from the Priamur and the Primorye has affinities with that ofKorea and Japan. Similarities in the cosmic serpents and dragons on Amur petroglyphs and aboriginal art of North America, Indonesia, and Polynesia suggest the possibility of more far-flung links. 10\n\nGeography andPrehistory » 13\n\nIn the first and second centuries A.D., the Priamur, the Primorye, Manchuria, Korea, and Japan formed a single cultural entity on the threshold of exposure to complex influences emanating from China. Chinese and Korean settlers brought bronze implements to the Tumen andSuifen rivers in the third century. During the fourth and fifth centuries, majestic burial mounds similar to those in Korea and Japan were built as far north as the Ussuri. When the Korean-Tungusic state of Koguryo pushed into the Khanka Plain from the southwest during the sixth century, sinitic cultural forms conveyed overtones of suzerainty, heralding a Chinese millennium. 11\n\n2 The Chinese Millennium Siberiais the oldest homeof the Chinese people.\n\n— Liji (1972) were aware of Northeast Asian aborigines long before extending suzerainty over the Priamur and the Primorye. References to Amur natives can be found in the chronicles of the Eastern Zhou (770 B.c-256 8.C.). 1 Han dynasty (202 b.c.-a.d. 220) records mention \"fishskin\" tribes (Nanai), \"hairy people\" (possibly Ainu), and Yi-lou who washed themselves with urine, as did the Chukchi in the seventeenth century.2 Energies released by the reunification of China under the Sui and Tang dynasties propelled Chinese imperial power into the region during the seventh century (see Map 3). Shortly after 630, Tang forces descended on the Sungari, established an outposton the Amur, andcollected tributefrom native chiefs, who in turn had their local authoritylegitimized by the Son of Heaven. Tributary delegations came from as far as Sakhalin (Kuyedao). 3 Expanding at the expenseofKoguryo, Tang units crossed theKhanka Plain and built a fortified base at Sucheng (Suchan) around 660. The demise of Koguryo in 668 sent Korean refugees northward across the Tumen, where in 698 they joined with Tungusic tribes to form the kingdom ofBohai; its capital, Mudanjiang, lay 150 miles northwestofwhat is today Vladivostok. Korean colonists settled the southern Primorye and eastern Manchuria as far north as the Sungari River. 4 Bohai's administration in the southern Primorye was based at Shuaibinfu, whose thirty-footthick walls are still visible outside of Ussuriisk. Smaller forts were built in the Sikhote Alin. While maintaining tributary relations with the Tang emperors, Bohai sent envoys to the Japanese imperial court at Nara, where Bokkai (Bohai) became a synonym for China. 5\n\nChinese\n\n16 « NORTHEAST ASIAN\n\nBohai did not long survive the collapse oftheTang in 907,being overrun in 926 by Mongol-speaking people called Khitans, who under the dynastic name Liao went on to conquer most of North China by 947. The Liao administration extendedfarther north and east than Bohai had, embracing all of the Sikhote Alin, as well as the right bank of the Amur upstream of Boli (today'sKhabarovsk). 6 Liao in turn fell victim to Tungusic-speaking peoples called Jurchens, who established the Jin (\"Gold\") dynasty in 11 15 and created an administration for Xubin Province (the Primorye) at Shuangchengzi (Ussuriisk) 7 The process of sinicization went further in Jin than it had in Liao, judgingfrom the large numbers of Chinese artifacts (coins, Buddhist figurines, roof tiles, and giant stone tortoises and stone columns inscribed with Chinese texts) excavated in the Primorye. 8 By the thirteenth century the Suifen Valley and Khanka Plain were well-populated agricultural oases, crisscrossed by roads, defended by forts, and governed by a Confucian bureaucracy oflargely Han Chinese.9 In 121 3 Khitan -Mongol tribes under Temuchin (better known as Genghis Khan) attacked the Primorye from Manchuria. The invaders devastated the Jurchen-Chinesepopulation, whose survivors fled into the taiga. 10 After the Mongols had conquered China and established the Yuan dynasty in 1264, they consolidated their hold over the Northeast. Forts, settlements, androads in the Primorye wererebuilt. Korean peasants wereresettled along the Suifen River as a buffer against possible Japanese attacks. Enlisting Han Chinese, the Mongols built and garrisoned posts along the Amur and Ussuri rivers, establishing an administrative center at Tyr on the lower Amur. Crossing the Tatar Strait to Sakhalin, they subdued the Gilyaks (Nivkhi) and Ainu in 1308 after aforty-year struggle. Around 1320 the Mongols abandoned Sakhalin and the Priamur but continued to garrison the Primorye until the collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368. 11 Ming dynasty (1368- 1644) energies that took the form of maritime expeditions to India, Arabia, and East Africa in the early fifteenth century also found expression in the Northeast. The tribute system was revived along the Amur and Ussuri, and tribal chiefs were brought to Beijing for investiture. In 1409 the military governorship of Nurgan was created, embracing the Primorye, the lower Amur, and Sakhalin. 12 Annoyed by raids on Tyr, the Yong-le emperor in 141 2 ordered one of his court eunuchs Yi Shiha to mount an expedition down the Sungari-Amur. He embarked in 141 3 on twenty-five vessels carrying 1,000 soldiers, architects,scribes, sculp-\n\nThe ChineseMillennium »\n\n17\n\nmasons, and tile-makers. On a bluff overlooking the Amur Yi built a Temple of Eternal Harmony and left inscriptions in Chinese, Tibetan, Mongol, and Jurchen describing the expedition, praising the Yong-le emperor, and celebrating Ming beneficence. 13 To underline imperial benevolence and authority, Yi distributed beads, utensils, andBuddhist figurines, and invested tribal leaders with brocade, banners, writing seals, and paper money. 14 When word reached Beijing that shamans had instigated the destruction ofBuddhist images, Yi found himself leading expeditions to Tyr in 1428 and 1433, during which additional monuments were constructed. 15 Toward the end of the sixteenth century, Jurchen tribes in Manchuria had come under the leadership of a chief named Nurhachi. By 1616 Nurhachi had captured Ming posts along the Ussuri and Suifen rivers, gaining control of the Sikhote Alin. With income from Sikhote Alin ginseng and support from Chinese collaborators, he built a formidable military machine. After Nurhachi's death in 1626, his successors, calling themselves Manchus, drove the Ming out of Beijing. There they founded the Qing Dynasty in 1644, the same year that Russians appeared on the Amur. tors, carpenters, at Tyr,\n\nGenesis of a \"Blank Spot\" Scholars have long acknowledged the cardinal importance of early Chinese ties with the Priamur and the Primorye. Nikita Bichurin, head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in Beijing from 1807 to 1821, showed that dynastic chronicles provided insights into Far Eastern developments from the third to the seventeenth centuries. The celebrated nineteenth-century explorers Richard Maak, Nikolai Przhevalsky, and Mikhail Venyukov testified to an enduring Chinese heritage along the Amur and Ussuri rivers. After conducting research during 1898-99 on the lower Amur and Sakhalin, the ethnographer and orientalist BertholdLaufer became convinced of the \"dependence of art of the Amur tribes on the Chinese.\" 16 \"Chinese appeared in the Ussuri region long before Russians,\" remarked a Russian visitor in 1901. 17 Viktor Panov, a prominent Vladivostok journalist and writer, substantiated this statement by chronicling a thousand-year Chinese presence in the Primorye. 18 Chinese associations figured prominently in the work of the internationally celebrated ethnographer Vladimir Arseniev, director of the Regional Studies Museum in Khabarovsk before andafter the October Revo-\n\n18 « NORTHEAST ASIAN\n\nECUMENE\n\nlution. 19 Excavations on the Khanka Plain and surveys in the Sikhote Alin convinced Arseniev that China had left an indelible imprint on the prehistory of the Primorye. He noted, moreover, that some local aborigines still regarded the Son of Heaven as their overlord. To educate the public about this ancient link, Arseniev placed at the front of the Khabarovsk Museum a Jin Dynasty granite tortoisebracketed by stelae inscribed in Chinese characters. 20\n\nIn the Soviet era, treatment of early Chinese associations with the Far East varied in accordance with political vicissitudes. Relations between Moscow and Beijing could hardly have been better when Aleksei Okladnikov began excavating sites in the southern Primorye in 1953.21 In this fraternal atmosphere, Okladnikov lamented that Chinese statues along the Amur, Ussuri, and Suifenrivers had been defaced, that Russian settlers had used Buddhist figurines for house props, and that all thatremained of the Temple of Eternal Harmony at Tyr was a pile ofbricks. 22 Other scholars at this time chorused that Chinese sources were essential to reconstruct the prehistory ofthe Priamur, the Primorye, andSakhalin. 23 However, as SinoSoviet fraternity faded in the late 19505, the Chinese contribution to Far Eastern prehistory began to shrink. Bohai, Liao, and Jin gradually lost their Chinese identity. References to Ming expeditions along the Amur contracted intocryptic footnotes. 24 The deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations fueled irredentist rhetoric in both Beijing andTaibei during the 19605. Mao Zedong declared in 1964 that Russia had \"taken too much land,\" citing among other areasthe Priamur and the Primorye. 25 A map published in Taibei that year depicted the entire SovietFar East within China's \"historical frontiers.\" 26 After border clashes along the Ussuri River in 1969, Beijing openly called the Priamur and the Primorye \"historically Chinesepossessions.\" 27 Not to be outdone, a Taiwan historian claimed that \"Siberia\" etymologically derived from \"Xiboliya,\" a group oftribes that paid tribute to China 2,000 years ago.28 Taking a similar tack, the Xinhua news agency in 1977 announced the discovery of \"close connections\" between North China and the Amur Basin some 2,700 years ago that confirmed that the latter had been \"an integral part of our great motherland since ancient times.\"29 Thefollowing year the Institute ofModern History of theChinese Academyof Social Sciences published thefirst of a three-volume philippic against Russian encroachment on the Priamur, the Primorye, and Sakhalin. 30 By 198 1 the Arctic Ocean wasbeing called China's northern frontier in the thirteenth century.31\n\nThe ChineseMillennium »\n\n19\n\nMoscow reacted to the irredentist challenge by mounting a propaganda counteroffensive. Pravda lambasted \"Maoists\"for coveting Soviet territory, and the Academy of Sciences mobilized researchers for combat against \"Great Han chauvinism\" on the historiographical front. 32 Galvanized by the confluence of patriotic instincts and Party directives, archaeologists and historians set out to minimize the Chinese presence in Northeast Asia before the seventeenth century. China found no place in the archaeology of the Soviet Far East. 33 Beijing's claims to ancient MiddleKingdom-Priamur links were dismissed as \"outright falsifications,\" and Bohai, Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing were relabeled Tungus-Korean, Khitan, Jurchen, Mongol, and Manchurespectively. 34 Denigration eventually escalated into denial. Soviet readers in the 1980s learned that no Chinese had even set foot in the Primorye until the nineteenth century.35 Toponymy was inducted to serve on the historiographical front. Following a directive from the Party Central Committee, the KGB in 1972 prepared a hit list of 1,200 place-names to be changed, including many of Chinese origin. In 1973 the Academy of Sciences announced new namesfor towns, villages, rivers, mountains, plains, and bays. The Ussuri River tributaries Iman,Waku, and Li Fuzin became Bolshaya Ussurka,Malinovka, and Rudny respectively. Suchan became Partizansk, Iman Dalnerechensk, and Tetyukhe Dalnegorsk.36 Zealous historians employed the new namesin old contexts, as if Peter the Great had founded Leningrad. 37 Beijing retaliated by pointedly referring to Khabarovsk as Boli and Vladivostok as Haishenwei.\n\nThe Chinese \"blank spot\" remained impervious to glasnost. Attuned to patriotic sensibilities, perestroikist pundits exhibited their editorial fearlessness elsewhere. At the Institute of History in Vladivostok, Academician AndreiKrushanov fortified the perimeters of silence. To avoid mentioning Ming expeditions on the Amur, the editor of History ofthe Far East USSR contrived to leap from Mongol conquest to Russian entreeas if nothing had transpired in the intervening 400 years. 38 Meanwhile in Khabarovsk, a granite tortoise still greets visitors to the Regional Studies Museum, but the stelae with Chinese inscriptions are nowhere to be seen.\n\n3 Russian Entree Only the Russians went to the Pacific Ocean not to conquerbut to bring peace, protection, and a higher spiritual and material culturethan the small peoples of the North andthe Priamur had at that time. —VladimirKlipel (1976)\n\nWhen Duchy\n\nVasco Nunez de Balboa glimpsed the Pacific through Panamanian foliage in 15 1 3, the Grand ofMuscovyhad yet toextend its control overtheVolga. Yetby themid-seventeenth century, barely sixty years after crossing the Urals, Russians had reached the Sea of Okhotsk, descended the Amur River, and passed through the straits separating Asia and America. This dynamic hasbeencharacterized variously as conquest, assimilation, infiltration,infestation, and an \"urge to the sea.\" 1 As a result, Russia acquired a permanent outlet on thePacific before it did on the Baltic or the Black Sea. A variety offorces propelled eastward expansion. Foremost among these was the lure of \"soft gold\": pelts of squirrels, otters, martens, beavers, ermine, mink, arctic foxes, and sables. Furs served as a commodity of exchange and a major export, accounting for a third of state treasury receipts in 1660. An insatiable demandfor pelts soon depleted supplies in the Urals and Western Siberia, prompting movement into unexploited regions farther east. Undemarcated space itself beckoned, holding out prospects of livelihood and security. Peasants were attracted by visions of free land. Fugitives and religious sectarians soughtrefuge in the taiga's commodious embrace. Strategists searched for defensible frontiers. Located on a vast Eurasian plain, Russian principalities had proved vulnerable to invaders from the East as late as 157 when Tatar raiders burned Moscow.\n\nRussian Entree »\n\n21\n\nRussia's eastward trajectory followed a network of Siberian rivers, natural arteries for shallow-draft boats. Fortified wooden stockades (ostrogs) built at junctions and portages served as milestones: Tyumen (1586), Tobolsk (1587), Salekhard (1595), Narym (1596), Tomsk (1604), Turukhansk (1607), Yeniseisk (1618), Krasnoyarsk (1628), Yakutsk (1632), and Okhotsk (1647) Spearheading the movement were Cossacks, who at this time included peasants, hunters, exiles, vagabonds, and river pirates such as Yermak, engagedby the Stroganov merchants in 158 1 to remove the khan of Sibir from the eastern slopes of the Urals. Undertherubric \"Lithuanians\" came recycled prisoners-of-war, immigrants, and foreign mercenaries of Lithuanian, Polish, White Russian, Ukrainian, Swedish, German, andDanish extraction. Carpenters, blacksmiths, and agriculturists, \"Lithuanians,\" streltsy (literally \"shooters\" who carried harquebuses), and Cossacks togetherformed a categorycalled \"servingmen\" as distinct from those who came to Siberia illegally or without official functions, such zspromyshlenniki, private hunters and trappers who discovered that they could do better by trading bread, salt, tobacco, ironware, beads, and alcohol to the aboriginal peoples for furs. During the seventeenthand eighteenth centuries, Siberia drew peasants primarily from the White Sea coastal area and Perm region. Some crossed the Urals under state sponsorship. Others came on their own to escape serfdom. Moscow set up checkpoints in the Urals to netrunaway serfs, but the quarry usually eluded these obstacles, although sometimesat the cost of abandoning families and possessions. Peasants adapted by subsisting on the West Siberian plain, joining the Cossacks, or apprenticing themselves as carpenters, blacksmiths, and boatmen. A few wound up as serfs on monastery estates, but binding a peasant to the land proved more difficult in Siberia than in European Russia. 2 Moscow tried to impose a measure ofcontrol in Siberia by dividing it into intendancies, each based in a major ostrog andcommanded by a military officer called a voevoda. Voevodas were drawn from noblemen whose names had been submitted to the tsar by the Military Affairs Office. Each voevoda was assisted by senior clerks and at times a military commander drawn from the sons ofboyars and the serving nobility. Mobility between serving men and higher officers was nonexistent. 3 Each voevoda reported to the Office of Siberian Affairs, which monitored the collection, tallying, and transportation offurs. Moscow experimented with giving onevoevoda supervisory powers over others but eventually settled on a fragmented rather than a unified Siberian administration. Jurisdictional boundaries in\n\n.\n\n22\n\n« NORTHEAST ASIAN ECUMENE\n\nSiberia were left vague, so that local conflicts not infrequently arose over undemarcated lands. In the 16305, the Tobolsk and Tomsk voevodas both claimed the Lena Basin, leading to skirmishes between their serving men. Moscow resolved this conflict by establishing a voevodstvo at Yakutsk in 1638.4 Strategically located on the middle course of the Lena, Yakutsk emerged as a fulcrum for Russian expansion toward the Sea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, Chukotka, and the Amur.\n\nEncounters with the Aborigines Rather than hunting fur-bearing animals, serving men hunted the natives, adopting a Mongol-Tatar practice calledyasak (fur tribute from ablebodied males). In addition to providing the state with revenue, yasak expanded state frontiers. Lands from which yasak was collected, together with the people living on those lands, were regarded as belonging to the tsar. In order to ensure compliance, serving men kept aboriginal hostages in each ostrog, periodically displaying them to reassure and intimidate relatives.\n\nAborigines reacted variously to the appearance of yasak-collectors. In western Siberia, the Khanty and the Mansi welcomed Russians as deliverers from Muslim heirs to the Mongol Empire. 5 Farther east, the Evenki willingly served as guides, interpreters, and agents of influence. 6 Encounters with the Yakuts were less harmonious. Once inhabiting the environs of Lake Baikal, the Yakuts had been driven northward by Mongols into the Lena Basin, where by the seventeenth century they had evolved a reindeerraising economy and a hierarchical tribal society. Each tribe consisted of 1,000 to 2,000 members led by a chief. The Yakuts fought with the Evenki, the Yukagirs, and among themselves, kidnapping women and engaging in blood feuds, yet nothing prepared them for the Russians, as the following Yakut legend suggests.7 Chief Tyngyn had many servants and workers. Among the workers, two newcomers differed from the rest. They had deep-setblue eyes, high sharp noses, hirsute faces, and tight-fitting clothes. Unable to speak coherendy, they gesticulated. Tyngyn's wife had a presentimentof evil and urged herhusband to kill them, but Tyngyn saw nothing dangerous. After two years the mysterious workersasked Tyngyn for a pair of ox hides as payment. Taking the skins, they indicated with gestures that they wantedwhateverland the skins could cover. Tyngyn saw nothing wrongwith such a curious request andreadily agreed. The two workers thereuponsliced die skins into\n\nRussian Entree » 23\n\nlong, thin strips and enclosed a large field, marking the boundaries with wooden stakes.Tyngyn watchedthem with bewilderment.The strange men then departed to the south. Next spring they returned, bringing with them many others with the same features and clothing. Around the marked-offland, they built a wall. Frightened, the Yakuts took counsel and decided to beat off the intruders. They shot arrows at thewall.Loud noises wereheard from within the enclosure, and aftereach noise a Yakutfell. Many Yakuts diedthat day, including Tyngyn and all his sons.\n\nAdult Yakut males who submitted to the Russians found themselves subject to yasak. Official pelt quotas were often supplemented by an extra, personal levy by individual collectors. Refusal invited the execution of hostages and burning of villages. The Yakutsk voevoda, Pyotr Golovin, managed to collect over 100,000 sable pelts between 1638 and 1642 by hanging recalcitrants from meat hooks. 8 Brutality galvanized resistance. Setting aside tribal animosities, Yakuts and Tungusic-speaking tribes along the Lena rebelled in 1642. Golovin responded with a campaign of terror during which a henchman named Poyarkov tortured and butchered hundreds of men, women, and children. 9 Some Yakuts withdrew northward, but theirrespite proved short-lived, for Cossacks pursued them to the Kolyma Basin, the Okhotsk seaboard, and Chukotka, appropriating property and torching settlements. 10 Between 1642 and 1682 the Yakut population is estimated to have fallen by 70 percent. 11\n\nTo resuscitate declining fur deliveries, Moscow took steps in the late seventeenth century to protect Siberian natives. Limits were imposed on the magnitude and frequency of yasak collections. Administrative boundaries were demarcated to spare aborigines from double yasak liability. Promyshlenniki came under state supervision. Codes were drawn up forbidding executions without Moscow's consent. 12 Although cooperative chiefs were granted gifts and tokens of authority, they were still forced to hand over relatives as hostages, to be displayed when the yasak was delivered. 13 Conquerors tend to seek sexual gratification unceremoniously in any case, but voevodas attempted to introduce an element of order into an unruly market by adopting the Yakut practice of collecting yasyr (\"woman tribute\"). 14 Aboriginal entrepreneurs prompdy commercialized yasyr, offering women and children for sale to promyshlenniki, who in turn sold them for pelts to serving men. Insofar as this traffic siphoned off yasak proceeds, Moscow tried to eradicate it. Prohibiting the sale of women to\n\n24 « NORTHEAST ASIAN ECUMENE\n\nserving men turned alcohol to natives. 15\n\nout to\n\nbe as unenforceable as prohibiting the sale of\n\nConquest ofthe Northeast From the Lena Basin Russians pushed along the Okhotsk and arctic seaboards toward Kamchatka and Chukotka, collecting pelts and tusks (mammoth, walrus) from Eskimos, Aleuts, Chukchi, Kamchadals, and Koryaks. As in Yakutia, the newcomers used native allies (Yukagirs) against refractory aborigines (Chukchi). 16 Native resistance in the Northeast took several decades to overcome. Koryaks made travel between Yakutsk and the Pacific littoral hazardous until a sea link was opened between Okhotsk and Kamchatka in 1716. 17 One Russian historian called the pacification of Kamchatka a \"fifty-year war,\" adding that \"nowheredid Russian conquest andadministration show such cruelty and rapacity.\" 18 During 1697-99 Vladimir Adasov and a hundred serving men cut their way through 12,000 Chukchi, 8,000 Koryaks, and 8,000 Kamchadals, qualifying the Anadyrsk voevoda as the Pizarro of Kamchatka. 19 Kamchatka's aborigines reacted with an admixture of defiance and despair. Slaughtered whenever they revolted, they began killing themselves. Suicide epidemics prompted Moscow to take the unusual step of ordering local authorities to restrain natives from taking their own lives. Kamchatka fell silent around 1750, but Chukotka continued to be a hot spot, with the Anadyrsk ostrog ultimately goingup in flames in 1770. Although the peninsula was declared pacified in 1789, the Chukchi stubbornly rejected the Russian Orthodox faith and occasionallyroughed up Russian officials well into the nineteenth century.20\n\nAdjustments and Accommodation The Russians' treatment of Siberian natives improved during the eighteenth century. Mindful of the strategic advantage of winning over the Buryat Mongols, authorities became more sensitive to the feelings of the Yakuts. 21 Upon the abolition oftheYakutsk voevodstvo in 1708, theNortheast was incorporated into Irkutsk Province, whose governors had little inclination to get involved in aboriginal affairs and delegated tax, judicial, and police authority to native chiefs. As the fur trade declined, Empress\n\nRussian Entree » 25\n\nCatherine abolished the hostage system and terminated quotas for pelts, retaining yasak to fill a ceremonial function. 22 The Orthodox Church dispensed charity and set up schools for native Siberians at Yakutsk in the 1730s and on Kamchatka around 1750.23 Although rebuffed by the Buryat Mongols and the Chukchi, the Church baptized and gave Russian names to thousands of Yakuts, Evenki, Yukagirs, and Ainu. Practical considerations expedited professions offaith, for native converts enjoyed exemption from\n\nyasak. State servants as well as aborigines took advantage of material opportunities. Following the time-honored Russian custom of \"feeding\" (kormlenie), officeholders remunerated themselves with bribes and extortion without fear of punishment as long as pelts accrued to the state in sufficient quantities. 24 The throne'stolerance did not extend to theprivate retention of choice pelts, but temptation proved hard to resist. Most voevodas who survived their terms endedup in a court of justice. 25 Occupational hazards at this time outpaced perquisites. Between 1677 and 1697, the voevodas of Yakutsk, Albazin, Nerchinsk, and Irkutsk were murdered by subordinates. 26 On Kamchatka ad hoc homicide chronically substitutedfor the time-consuming formal administration of justice. When it came to killing, Russians treated natives no worse than they did each other. Atlasov harvested lives without regard to ethnicity. Golovin used meat hooks on Yakuts, but he did not shrink from employing hot coals, pliers, and theknout on his own men and their wives.27 The absence ofracial prejudice expressed itself socially and culturally in relations between Russians and aborigines, called variously inorodtsy (\"people of differentbirth\") and inovertsy (\"people ofanother belief\"),28 The barrier posed by religion could be removed by baptism. Baptized native males served with Cossacks and streltsy Baptized females had the Church's blessing to wed Russians and often did so.29 As mixed marriages proliferated, native cultures held their own and in some cases prevailed. On Kamchatka offspring of Russian-Kamchadal couples were Orthodox in religion but Kamchadal in speech, clothing, and diet. 30 In Yakutia the lifestyles of Russian settlers underwent \"yakutization.\"31 Although decimated, Chief Tyngyn's descendentswielded metaphorical ox hides to stake out andclaim the cultural ground.\n\n4 Amur Setback When the Russians first arrivedon the Amur, the natives cultivatedfields andkept cattle.Ten years afterwards these fields had become deserts; and a country that formerly exported grain could not even support its own reduced E. G. Ravenstein ( 1861 ) population.\n\n—\n\nIn\n\n1600 the Priamur's\n\napproximately\n\ninhabitants fell into three groups corresponding roughly to the upper, middle, and lowerreaches of the Amur. 1 From the confluence of the Shilka and the Argun to the Zeya lived Mongol-speaking agriculturists whom the Russians called Daurians (see Map 4) The middle Amur was inhabited by Tungusic-speaking tribes known as Diuchers. The lower Amur and northern Sakhalin were populated by ancestors of the Nanai (Goldy), Ulchi, and Nivkhi (Gilyaks). These peoples recognized Chinese suzerainty in the fifteenth century, but Ming dynastic decline during the sixteenth century created a new political dynamic in the Northeast. The Manchus subdued the Daurians and Diuchers in the 1630s and relocated some of them to the Sungari and Nonni river valleys, ironically depleting the Amur region of potential defenders on the eve ofRussianpenetration. 2 32,000\n\n.\n\nPenetration and Expansion, 1644-sS Russian expansion across Siberia moved in two prongs, sometimes par-\n\nallel, sometimesconverging, along and between river systems. The northern prong met little resistance until it reached Yakutia. Its southern counterpart had to cope with remnants of the Mongol Empire along the fringes of\n\n28 « NORTHEAST ASIAN\n\nCentral Asia and the northern slopes of the Altai and Sayan ranges. By the 1 640s Yakutsk had emerged as a fulcrum for Russian expansion in the Northeast. Verkhneudinsk occupied a roughly similar position in Transbaikalia. The penetration of the Amur Basin converged from both strongpoints. Provisions as much as pelts sparked early Russian interest in the Amur. Food shortages posed a serious threat to Eastern Siberia, where a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables gave rise to scurvy, pellagra, and beriberi, and periodic shortfalls of grain forced people to eat grass, roots, and in extreme cases each other.3 Hungercreated a ready audiencefor stories circulating in Yakutsk about \"Dauria,\" a land south of the mountains, where corn and grain grew in fertile valleys. To investigate these reports, Golovin dispatched a party in 1643 under Vasily Poyarkov, a serving man who had established his credentials the previous year pacifying Yakuts. From the Lena Poyarkov ascended the Aldan, crossed the Stanovoi Range, and descended the Zeya to theAmur. After following the great river to its estuary, Poyarkov returned to Yakutsk overland from the Okhotsk seaboard. His three-year, 3,000-mile trekclaimed 1 30 of the expedition's 150 men.4 Those who did not die from disease, cold, or malnutrition succumbed to flogging.5 Poyarkov dealt summarily with native resistance along the Amur. When a Diucher settlement refused to yield yasak, he dispatched scores of inhabitants, including the chief and his entire family. 6 Back in Yakutsk, Poyarkov reported that although local tribes were paying yasak to a southern \"khan\" (the Manchu emperor), Dauria could be conquered with 300 men.7\n\nPoyarkov was followed by Erofei Khabarov, a peasant turned promyshlennik, who with a mandate from the Yakutsk voevoda led twenty-one serving men and 107 promyshlenniki via the Olyokhma and Stanovoi watershed into Dauria in 1649. Khabarov spent three years collecting yasak with methods pioneered by Poyarkov, killing 661 Daurians in one episode alone. 8 In 1925 a Soviet historian denounced Khabarov's \"uncontrolled barbarity,\" but by 1969 he was said to have committed only \"isolated excesses.\"9 Since then, those excesses have been recast as a disposable footnote to his achievement of \"uniting\" the Amur region with Russia.* *The phrase \"isolated excesses\" {otdePnye ekstsessy), which V A. Aleksandrov used in Rossiia na dal'nevostochnykhrubezhakh (1969), was dropped in the 1984revision of his book. As Khabarov's depredationshave been minimized, his services to theRussian state have been magnified. From no mention of territorial annexations in prerevolutionary and early Soviet accounts,\n\nAmurSetback »\n\n29\n\nIn the wake of Poyarkov and Khabarov, Cossacks, peasants, traders, hunters, deserters, fugitives, and vagabonds flocked to the Amur in search of land, freedom, and fortune. Cossacks ensconced themselves at Albazin (1651; 1665 in some accounts) and built several small forts downstream. Nerchinsk ostrog (est. 1654), superseding Yakutsk in 1658 as the administrative center handling Daurian yasak, served as Russia's principal gateway to the Amur for the next thirty years.\n\nTheManchu Response, 16SO-87 Manchu officials on the Amur, without interfering with Poyarkov and Khabarov, reported to Beijing that \"man-devouring demons\" had infested the Northeast. Beijing's reaction to these reports was conditioned by a Confucian world view,* by Dauria's proximity to the Manchu homeland, and by an unstable situation in Mongolia, where the Qing dynasty was attempting to subdue recalcitrant tribes, some of whom were in contact with Russians. Moscowfor its part was endeavoring to open overland trade with China through Central Asia and Mongolia. The Amur Basin became one of several arenas of encounters between two converging empires and\n\ncultures, neither of which fully understood the other's values, objectives, and territorial magnitude. The Qing first offered Moscow trade as a quid pro quo for withdrawal from the Northeast, 10 a tactic that incorrectly assumed Moscow controlled the behavior of its subjects in Dauria. When linkage failed to produce results, the Manchus resorted to force. From a newly established military governorship at Ninguta, 240 miles south of the Amur, Manchu forces he has progressively been credited with creating \"preliminaryconditions\" for the acquisition of the middle Amur (late 19505), with annexing the Amur as far downstream as the Zeya junction ( 1 968 ), and with \"assimilating\" the entire Amur Basin into Russia ( 1980s). The last is patendy overblown,for Khabarov did not get beyond the junction of the Amur and Zeya rivers and thus neverreached the site ofthe city that today bears his name.

Again, the Manchus miscalculated. During the next twenty years, over 4,000 peasants, exiles, vagabonds, and rebels made their way to Dauria. Fugitive Cossacks took over Albazin in 1665 and defied Nerchinsk, forwarding yasak proceeds directly to Moscow to secure the tsar'sindulgence. 12 For several years Beijing took no active steps against the \"demons,\" ignoring appeals for help from aborigines as far away as the Okhotsk seaboard. 13 The Manchus at this stage weremore concerned about preserving the ethnic purity of their homeland, for which purpose they erected a \"willow palisade\" across southern Manchuria demarcating the northern limits of Han Chinese settlement. However, when a Mongol tribal chief renounced Qing suzerainty and sought Russian protection in 1667, the Kangxi emperor revived the tactic of using trade as an incentive to enlist Muscovite cooperation on the Amur. Once again Beijing overestimated Moscow'sreadiness and ability to restrain Russian subjects in Dauria. 14 While leaving the door open to diplomacy, the Kangxi emperor prepared to take tougher measures in the Northeast. Starting in 1680, forts and roads were built along southern approaches to the Amur. When Moscow dispatched 2,000 serving men to Albazin in 1684, Beijing sent emissaries with a note for the voevoda Tolbuzin ordering the Russians to go back to Yakutsk and not \"intrude any more into our lands.\" When the note failed to elicit the desired response, several thousand Manchu, Chinese, Daurian, and Diucher troops surrounded Albazin in 1685. 15 After a siege of four days, the defenders surrendered and were allowed to retire, without arms, to Nerchinsk.* When word of Albazin's fall reached Moscow in late 1685, the government decided to abandon the Amur and secure a trade agreement with China. Meanwhile, however, Tolbuzin had slipped back into Albazin and preparedfor a siege. Upon learning ofthis, theKangxi emperor ordered the fort recaptured. A Qing force of 5,000 men attackedAlbazin in the summer of 1686, killed Tolbuzin, and after a thirteen-month siege, retook the fort. 'About fifty defenders opted to become Qing subjects and resettled in Beijing to join other Russian prisoners and collectivelyknown as \"Albazinians.\"\n\nAmur Setback » 31\n\nBarely seventy of 900 defenders remained alive, half of whom soon succumbed to disease and starvation. TheKangxi emperor thereupon reverted to diplomacy and signaled Moscow that he was prepared to discuss trade within the context of a Russian withdrawal from theAmur. 16 Moscow responded by dispatchingCount Fyodor Golovin to Nerchinsk with plenipotentiary powers to secure a trade agreement and, if possible, a frontier along the Amur. Failing an Amur frontier, Moscow was prepared to accept the Bureya (leaving China in possession of the lower Amur) or at worst in \"the environs of Albazin\" (leaving China in control of the middle and lower Amur) , 17 Moscow simultaneously vested Golovin with administrativeresponsibility for southeastern Siberia, thereby establishing a precedent for combining gubernatorial and diplomatic functions in a single person. 18\n\nThe Treaty ofNerchinsk When the Muscovite and Manchu delegations finally\n\nmet at Nerchinsk\n\nin August of 1689 (Golovin arriving a month and a halflate), both claimed\n\nlands that neitiier knew much about. Golovin proposed an Amur River frontier, whereupon the Manchu plenipotentiary, Prince Songota, countered with Lake Baikal. Golovin then suggested the Bureya, and Songota came back with Nerchinsk. Two Jesuits attached to the Manchu delegation then offered what they called a compromise: the Gorbitsa River, which flowed into the Shilka about midway between Nerchinsk and Albazin. Golovin balked at a \"compromise\" that would exclude Russia from the Amur, but theclank andclamor of 1 5,000 Manchu troops deployed around Nerchinsk helped him to reconsider. Russian, Manchu, and Latin texts of theTreatyofNerchinsk were signed on 6 September 1689. Moscow got its coveted caravan trade and gave up the Amur Valley. The frontier, still undemarcated, was to run along the Argun, Shilka, and Gorbitsa rivers and the crest of the \"stone mountains.\" Areas drained by rivers flowing into theAmur were to belong to the Middle Kingdom, and areas drained by rivers flowing on the other side of the \"stone mountains\" were to belong to the Russian Empire. Expulsion from the Amur does not seem to have unduly troubled Moscow, where prospects of lucrative commerce carried more weight than remote real estate. 19Tsar Petershowed no signs of displeasure other than at the fact that his imperial seal followed rather than preceded that of the Kangxi\n\n32 « NORTHEAST ASIAN\n\nECUMENE\n\nemperor's, a condition remedied by reversing the sequence in subsequent documents.20 Golovin's career continued its upward trajectory. Only in the nineteenth century did Russian writers deploring the \"loss\" of the Amur score Golovin for faintheartedness and Jesuit casuistry. 21 When relations with China deteriorated after i960, Soviet commentators discovered that theNerchinsk Treaty had been negotiated under duress and wasa product of a \"cold war\" waged by China to seize the \"Siberian Ukraine\" and thereby gain \"hegemony\" overRussia. 22 Seventeenth-century ambiguities about Northeast Asian geography left ample latitudefor divergent interpretations ofNerchinsk's boundary clause. TheChinese asserted that the \"stonemountains\" and the\"ocean\"referred to the Yablonovy-Stanovoi ranges and the Sea ofOkhotsk. 23 Soviet commentators countered that the \"stone mountains\" are in fact the Bureya Range and the \"ocean\" the Amur-Sungari junction.24 Moreover, they argued that the absence of any mention ofSakhalin and the Primorye in the treaty indicated that these territoriesdid not belong to China.25 However one construes the Nerchinskfrontiers, Russia's Amur setback stemmed from priorities, logistics, and economics rather than from \"Manchu-Qing aggression.\"26 Preoccupied by military commitments in theWest and more interested in trade than in territory, Moscow did not place the Amur high on the hierarchy of state objectives for goodreasons. Separated by thousands of miles of trackless taiga, the Russian state could match neither Qing power nor Qing munificence in Dauria. Four thousand Russian colonists and a few thousand Cossacks constituted a slender presence in a region the size ofFrance. Beijing enjoyed more prestige among Daurians and Diuchers, for Manchus rewarded tribute with gifts of brocade, titles, and wives, whereas Cossacks, lacking carrots, relied on sticks. Not long after Nerchinsk, in composing Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe had his hero pass through Dauria en route home. Defoe wrote that the Argun [Amur] flowed into a \"Chinese Ocean.\"27 Small wonder that a Brezhnev-era pedagogue labeled Crusoe \"a true bourgeois.\"28\n\n5 Pacific Window Should I go to Okhotskwithoutprovisions,or shouldthe provisions go to Okhotsk withoutme? Vims Bering (1737)\n\n—\n\nfrom the Amur, Russian energies were directed for over a Chukotka, the Kurile century toward the Okhotsk Islands, and eventually North America. Although the Russians found more pelts and met less resistance in the \"Eastern Ocean\" (as they first called the Pacific) than in Dauria, they encounteredformidable problems with provisioning North Pacific settlements. Climatic conditions around the Okhotsk seaboard, Kamchatka, Chukotka, and what is today Alaska all but precluded agriculture. Grain imported from Western Siberia not only cost a lot but took nearly a year to deliver. As the quest for sea otters drew Russians into North America after 1740, attempts were made to secure food supplies by resettling peasantsfrom Siberia, by searching for Asia-Pacific trade partners, by establishing agrarian colonies in California and Hawaii, and by relying on the Imperial Navy. None of these expedients proved satisfactory, and some generated diplomatic embarrassment. Although less than successful in getting wheat and corn, these efforts produced a rich harvest of knowledge. Navigators and scientists made important contributions to cartography, ethnography, and natural history. The first steps were taken by a trio of Cossacks — Semyon Dezhnev and Fedot Alekseyev, who in 1648 made their way along Siberia's arctic coast and around the tip of Chukotka into the \"Eastern Ocean,\" and Ivan Kozyrevsky, who explored the Kurile Islands in 1711-13. Their successors extended the range of discoveries to North America, Japan, and Oceania, bequeathing an array of Russian place-names to Polynesia.\n\nDeflected seaboard, Kamchatka,\n\n34 « NORTHEAST ASIAN ECUMENE\n\nPartiy because of the increasing power of the Russian state and partly because enterprise on the Pacific coast required a magnitude of investment beyond the range of merchant capital alone, St. Petersburg (the seat of governmentfrom 1703) played a more active role in the east during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries than Moscow had during the seventeenthcentury. Imperial priorities shifted in accordance with (among other things) the idiosyncrasies of Peter I (1689- 1725), Catherine II (1762-96), Paul (1796-1801), andAlexander I (1801-25).\n\nPetrine Initiatives, 1711-so Peter's Westernizing drumbeat for a while echoed faintly and belatedly on the eastern periphery. Although the tsar gave a European form to Siberian administration in 1708, it was not until 1719 that the Yakutsk district came under the jurisdiction of Irkutsk Province. 1 Proposals for expeditions to Kamchatka at first met a tepid response. However, as Peter began to see the Pacific as a source of wealth and power, his interest picked up. Reports by Vladimir Atlasov and Kozyrevsky about Japan evoked bold imperial scenarios of Siberian springboards to China and India. Peter had such considerations in mind in 171 1 when he ordered a sea route opened to Kamchatka. Founded in 1647, Okhotsky ostrog was the earliest Russian settlement on the Sea ofOkhotsk (or \"Big Sea,\" as it was called at the time) , but it turned out to be more of a chink than a window on the Pacific. Connected to Yakutsk by a 500-mile track over the Dzhugdzhur Range, it had no natural harbor andwas ice-boundfor halfthe year. When navigation between Okhotsk and Bolsheretsk opened in 1716, travelers to Kamchatka no longer had to make an arctic detour to avoid unfriendly Koryaks along the Okhotsk seaboard. 2 Although Peter did not live to witness it, he set in motion the First Kamchatka Expedition ( 1725- 30 ) , which sought to clarify the geopolitical configuration of the North Pacific. 3 Led by Captain Vitus Bering, a Dane in Russian service, the expedition was plagued by setbacks and yielded what some contemporaries considered modest dividends. Two Okhotsk-built ships, captained respectively by Bering and Aleksei Chirikov, sailed along the Pacific coast ofKamchatka and Chukotka, passed through the [Bering] strait into the Arctic Ocean, and followed the Siberian shore for about 100 miles, not finding the \"Big Land\" (Alaska) but confirming thatKamchatka offered the most serviceable site for a Pacific port.\n\nPacific Window\n\n» 35\n\nTheir Second Kamchatka Expedition (1733-43), more ambitious and multifaceted, explored the Siberian arctic andNorth Pacific littorals, investigated Northeast Asia's natural and human environment, made a bid to open trade with Japan, and established a Russian foothold along the northwestcoast ofNorth America. Although the expedition claimed the life ofits leader, it dramatically increased Russia's knowledge of the NorthPacific. In addition to clarifying Asia's relationship to America, Bering and Chirikov surveyed the Aleutian Islands and the southern coast of Alaska. Martin Spanberg charted theKurile Archipelago and made thefirst Russian landing on Honshu, Japan's main island. 4 Dmitry Laptev explored a section of Russia's arctic coastline. Scientists and scholars with the expedition made lasting contributions to this fund of knowledge. Georg Wilhelm Stellerand StepanKrasheninnikov wrote classic accounts of the North Pacific and Kamchatka, respectively. 5 Gerhard Friedrich Muller produced the first general history of Siberia. 6 Johann Georg Gmelin pioneered the study of Siberian flora. Such works brought Siberia and the North Pacific into the mainstream of European intellectual discourse. Finally, in 1740 the expedition founded the port of Petropavlovsk, named after Bering's and ChirikoVs ships St. Peter and St. Paul. Located in Avacha Bay on the eastern coast of Kamchatka, Petropavlovsk had two major advantages over Okhotsk: a well-protected anchorage and unobstructed access to the Pacific. The Kamchatka expeditions indirectly promoted the colonization of Northeastern Siberia as agricultural settlements grew up around Okhotsk and Petropavlovsk. 7 Thanks to Petrine initiatives,Russia gained a half-century head start over England and France in the NorthPacific. Spanish galleons had occasionally strayed north of the Manila-Acapulco axis, and Dutch navigators had groped their way around the Kuriles and Sakhalin in 1643, but as Georg Steller wrote in 1745, Russia had a strategic opportunity in the North Pacific to control the southern Kuriles and exert influence over Japan and China. 8 Ironically, by moving into the southernKuriles later in the century, Russia inspired in the Japanese imagination the durable notion of a \"northern threat.\"\n\nSearchingforDirection, 1750-98 During thesecond halfofthe eighteenth century, St. Petersburg looked in vain for a satisfactory administrative arrangement for its vast but sparsely\n\n36 «\n\nNORTHEAST ASIAN ECUMENE\n\nsettled eastern territories. Irkutsk Province, sprawling over a third of the RussianEmpire, underwent a series of reorganizations. In 1732 the Okhotsk Administration (Okhotskoye upravlenie) was established at Okhotsk (subsequendy moved to Anadyr andthen Yakutsk) with elasticboundaries encompassing the Okhotsk seaboard and Kamchatka. A YakutskDistrict (oblast) was created in 1775, but unstable boundaries and overlapping jurisdictions continued to plague theNortheast up to andafter 1917.9 During the mid- eighteenth century Siberian governors attempted to revive Petrine momentum by supporting peasantresettlement, cartographical surveys, schools for navigation, and agricultural experiments in the Northeast. These efforts aroused scant interest in St. Petersburg but dovetailed with private initiatives being launched toward North America and Japan in search of pelts and trade. Russian merchants carried out eightyeight voyages to the Aleutians andAlaska between 1 743 and 1797. 10 One of the boldest entrepreneurs, Grigory Shelikhov, organized a company in 1775 for theNorth Pacificfur trade andfounded thefirst Russian settlement in North America, while his partner financed probes along the Kurile Islands in the hope of engaging the Japanese in commerce. But it soon became apparent that Russian enterprise alone could not provision North Pacific settlements, and that private trade missions to northern Japan could not breach the barriers raised by shogunal policies. By the end of the eighteenth century, Russia no longer had the North Pacific to itself. In 1778 James Cook surveyed the northwest coast of North America and passed through the Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean. His successor James King called twice at Petropavlovsk in 1779 while reconnoitering the Northeast's littoral. In 1787 Jean Francois de La Perouse sailed from the Sea of Japan into the Tatar Strait, passed between Sakhalin and Hokkaido, and looked over some of the Kurile Islands. William Broughton covered a similar route a decade later. In the 1780s New England merchants (collectively dubbed \"Bostonians\") appeared along the northwest American coast, and the commercial visionary John Ledyard showed up in Irkutsk. 11 From the 1790s \"Bostonians\"collected furs from the Indians of the northwest coast in exchange for trinkets, cloth, rum, and guns, the last of which they occasionally discharged at Russians. Pelts that might have been bartered at Kiakhta were siphoned off by American interlopers for resale in Canton. St. Petersburg reacted fitfully and ineffectively to encroachment on its North Pacific empire. Catherine II expelled the inquisitive John Ledyard\n\nPacific Window\n\n» 37\n\nfrom Russia and in 1786 proclaimed imperial sovereignty over an arc extending from the Kurile Islands to what is today the southern tip of the Alaskan panhandle. The empress dispatched a naval expedition to the Pacific in 1 787 to enforce this decree, butrecalled it while it wasen route when war broke out with Sweden and Turkey. Local officials had to make do with a consignment of gun emplacements at Petropavlovsk, leaving Russia's North Pacific as vulnerable as ever.\n\nBold Projects, 1799-1824 Official interest in the North Pacific revived during the brief reign of Catherine's son Paul, who in 1 799 issued a charter to the Russian-American Company and established a small naval squadron to service the Pacific coast. The Russian-American Company claimed a monopoly of resources along the North Pacific littoral but relied on foreign merchants and the Russian Navyfor supplies. As in the previous century, science outpaced provisioning. Between 1803 and 1830 a series of Russian naval expeditions in the Pacific clarified the contours of the Okhotsk seaboard, the Kurile Islands, Kamchatka, and Chukotka.* Ivan Kruzenshtern failed to discover a navigable channel between Sakhalin and the mainland, but he refined the earlier surveys of La Perouse and Broughton. Ferdinand Wrangel and others charted Siberia's arctic littoral. These mariners displayed impressive intellectual curiosity as well as professional competence, imparting prestige to a Pacific service whose veterans formed an elite within the Imperial Navy. 12 So as not to rely entirely on the navy for provisions, officials in Siberia and Russian America attempted to open trade with Japan, China, the United States, Spanish colonies (the Philippines, California, Peru), and Hawaii. Even India was considered. 13 Such inventiveness created more problems than it solved. An impulsive demarche toward Japan led to a series of misunderstandings that, to paraphrase the poet Mikhail Lermontov, would have been funny if they were not so sad. In 1 804 the energetic director of the Russian-American Company, Nikolai Rezanov, sailed to Nagasaki and pressed shogunal officials to sanction commerce. When re*The principal expeditions were led by Ivan Kruzenshtern (1803-6), Yury Lisiansky (1803-6), Vasily Golovnin (1807-9, 1817-19), Otto Kotsebue (1815-17, 1823-26), Fadei Bellingshausen (1819-21), Mikhail Lazarev (1819-21), Ferdinand Wrangel (1825-27), and FyodorLitke (1826-29).\n\n38 «\n\nNORTHEAST ASIAN\n\nECUMENE\n\nfused after having been kept waiting for an answer in Nagasaki harbor for six months, Rezanov allowed vexation to override his better judgment. Before setting out on a fatal attempt to cross Siberia, he issued nebulous instructions to a couple of unsophisticated ensigns (Khvostov and Davydov) to teach the obstreperous Japanese a lesson by torching their settlements on Sakhalin and the southern Kuriles. After some hesitation, these naive instruments of Rezanov's pique carried out raids in the fall of 1806 and spring of 1807, thereby earning Japan's wrath against Russia and a court-martial for themselves. The court ofhistory has yet topass final judgment on this incident, which is still variously characterized as patriotism, piracy, or opera bouffe. 14 St. Petersburg's embarrassment at Rezanov's gaucherie did not discourage emulators. In 1 812 an American named Peter Dobell showed up at Petropavlovsk with two provision-laden ships from Manila. Impressing officials with a plan for a trade network encompassing Siberia, Alaska, California, Japan, Canton, and the Philippines, Dobell wrangled an appointment as consul-general in Manila but achieved little other than promoting himself to \"Russian consul-general to the Pacific Ocean.\" 15 Efforts by the Russian-American Company to establish bases in California and Hawaii came up with more tangible but still disappointing results. An agriculturalcolony founded in 18 12 northof San Francisco produced some wheat and corn before being sold in 1841. A scheme by an irrepressible Teutonic doctor to bring a Hawaiian island into the Russian Empire in 1 815-17 went awry, leaving St. Petersburg to distance itself yet again with disavowals. 16 For lack of alternatives, the Russian-American Company came to depend on Americans. Once the company started exchanging pelts for supplies with \"Bostonians\" in 1803, the New Englanders gained a foothold in Russian America that they soon extended to Northeast Asia. By 1 820 Yankee traders and whalers were operating along the coasts of Chukotka, purveying rum and trinkets for furs, tusks, and sex. 17 To contain these impudent interlopers, the Russian-American Company forbade aborigines to trade with foreigners, backed by an 1821 ukase issued by Alexander I barring foreign vessels from most of the North Pacific littoral. These proprietary gestures were neutralized when larger imperial calculations led to the Russian-American Convention of 1824 restoring American access to Russia's North Pacific shores. 18\n\nPacific Window\n\n» 39\n\nSiberian Reforms and the Northeast St. Petersburg's plenipotentiaries compiled a mixedrecord in Northeast Asia during thefirst four decades ofthenineteenthcentury. On the one hand Prince Gagarin, thefirst governor-general of Siberia (1711-17), defrauded the state treasury and wound up on the gallows. 19 Governor-General Ivan Pestel, enjoying the emoluments of office without subjecting himself to the hardships, resided for most of his term (1806-19) in St. Petersburg.20 On the other hand, during his brief tenure as governor-general (1819-22), Mikhail Speransky introduced rationalist ideas of the Enlightenment into Siberian administration by defining official prerogatives and duties, imposing legal constraints on the treatment of exiles,codifying regulations for salt and alcohol monopolies, and promoting immigration by free peasants.21 Speransky also set up tribalcouncils to encourage aboriginal self-rule, laying the basis for native land rights. 22 These fresh breezes reached distant Kamchatka, where more land was brought under cultivation and an agricultural school was opened at Petropavlovsk. 23 Kamchatka was on AlexanderPushkin's mind in thefinal days of his life in 1837. The great poet's imagination anticipated Utopian visions about Siberia among his radical contemporaries and adumbrated a redirection of Russian energiesfrom America to Asia, from Alaska to the Amur. 24\n\n6\n\nReturn to the Amur time Russia finds herself checked in Europe she intensifies her drive in Asia. Prince Andrei Lobanov-Rostovsky (1933)\n\nEvery\n\n—\n\nIndramatically enlarged\n\nthe mid-nineteenth century, Russia its territory in the Far East by acquiring the Priamur and the Primorye. Russia's return to the Amur was marked by infiltration rather than force. Provincial bureaucrats, naval officers, scholars, and diplomats, as well as Cossacks, exiles, and peasants, took part in the advance. Like their seventeenth-century predecessors, Far Eastern activists made use ofpoor communicationsand imperial vanities to conceal and then legitimize unauthorized initiatives. Unlike their predecessors, Manchu leaders found their efforts to deal with Russian encroachment undercut by internal upheavals.\n\nFrom Nerchinsk to Nanjing Between the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), which excluded Russia from the Amur Basin, and the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which inaugurated incremental partition of China, the Priamur and the Primorye remained quiescent. Portrayed by some historians as a symptom of neglect, 1 this quiescencederived from a Qing policy of insulating the Manchu homeland from HanChinese. Qing relations with Priamur aborigines continued to be defined after 1 689 by the tribute system, with furs being sent to Beijing in return for gifts and legitimation. 2 In the early eighteenth century, Qing authorities intro-\n\nReturn to theAmur »\n\n41\n\nduced the practice of marrying Manchu girls to tribal chiefs on the lower Amur. After 1750 Gilyak chiefs from Sakhalin journeyed to Beijing to be invested with brides, surnames, andranks. 3 Meanwhile, following surveys of the Priamur, the Primorye, and Sakhalin in 1709, permanent military strongpoints and seasonal tributecollection posts wereestablished along the Amur. Manchu officials descendedthe Sungari each summer from Sanxing to collect pelts and confer gifts and titles on Amur natives. In 1 809 the Japanese surveyor Mamiya Rinzo visited a Manchu tribute post near what is today Komsomolsk, noting that it was staffed only in summer months. 4 Notwithstanding restrictions imposed by Beijing and enforced at Manchu checkpoints along the Sungari, Chinesemade their way to the Priamur for ginseng in the Sikhote Alin, trepang in Haishenwei (\"Trepang Bay\"), and fur-bearing animals in the Ussuri taiga, living in seasonal huts and worshiping at makeshift shrines. 5 Chinese peasants migrated from droughtwracked Zhili, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces and formed permanent communitiesalong theBureya, Zeya, Ussuri, andSuifen rivers (see Map 5 ) About 6,000 Chinese agriculturalists lived in the Priamur in 1854, raising crops of wheat, corn, millet, barley, cucumbers, cabbages, onions, and garlic. 6 For several decades after 1689, official Russian policies toward the Priamur wereconstrained by reluctance to jeopardizethe caravantrade through Kiakhta. St. Petersburg did little more than periodically ask Beijing for permission to navigate along the Amur. 7 Privately, bolder initiatives were urged. In 1 757 a German in Russian serviceadvised that theNerchinsk treaty be revised in such a way that the Sino-Russian frontier would run along the Amur. 8 Beijing would have none ofit, and St. Petersburg was not inclined to press the issue. When John Cochrane made his wayby foot through Siberia to Kamchatka in 1820-22, he was struck by the general indifference to the Amur. 9 Serious interest in the Amur manifested itself first in Transbaikalia, whose eastern reaches suffered economically from lack of access to the Sea of Okhotsk. Viewed from Nerchinsk, the Amur presented itself as a natural artery along which Transbaikalian grain could be shipped to the Okhotsk seaboard and Kamchatka. 10 Political as well as economic calculations promoted Transbaikalian interest in the Amur. The Chita visionary Dmitry Zavalishin and other exiled Decembrists (military officers who had taken\n\n.\n\nReturn to theAmur » 43 part in an abortive uprising against Nicholas I in December 1825) in\n\nIrkutsk and Transbaikalia nurtured the notion that with an Amur channel to the Pacific, Siberia could become a laboratory for revolution. 11 The Opium War (1839-42) called St. Petersburg's attention to the Amur by exposing Northeast Asia's vulnerability to British sea power. When the Treaty of Nanjing awarded Great Britain a foothold on theChina coast, some Russian officials wonderedwhether the Amur might not attract predatory designs, a scenario that acquired an uncomfortable plausibility as British, French, andAmerican naval activity mounted in the North Pacific. Social and economic as well as strategic forces converged to reopen the Amur question in the mid- 1840s. Cautionreigned in St. Petersburg, but on the periphery officers, merchants, scientists, and political exiles began to coalesce around a governor-general of Eastern Siberia into an unstable partnership ofAmur activists who came to be known as amurtsy.\n\nProbes, 1843-48 Within a year of the Treaty of Nanjing, a special committee convened in St. Petersburg to reassess Russia's position in the Far East. 12 It was agreed that the undemarcated frontiers needed clarification, although the foreign minister, Count Karl Nesselrode, wanted no territorial aggrandizement at China's expense and insisted that every precaution be taken not to jeopardize relations with Beijing. The most convenient instrument to investigate the Far Eastern frontier zone turned out to be Professor Alexander von Middendorf, then in Yakutsk studyingpermafrost under the auspices of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Instructed to survey the Okhotsk seacoast in the region of the Shantar Islands, von Middendorf on his own initiative sent a reconnaissance party overtheStanovoi Range to the Amur, establishing a behavioral pattern that became emblematic of the amurtsy. 13 Von Middendorf's boldness unsettled Nesselrode but piqued the navy's curiosity for finding a navigable channel from the Amur to the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan.* Accordingly, Lieutenant Aleksandr Gavrilov was dispatched to the Amur from Ayan (which in 1845 had replaced Okhotsk as a naval base) on a Russian-American Company ship. To avoid *When Mamiya Rinzo surveyed the lower Amur in 1809, he confirmed Sakhalin's insularity and prepared achart ofthe estuary. The shogunatetried to keep Mamiya's discoverysecret, but a map incorporating his chart was smuggled out ofJapan byPhilipp Franz von Siebold in 1829 and shown to theRussian navigator IvanKruzenshtern in 1834.\n\n44 «\n\nNORTHEAST ASIAN\n\nECUMENE\n\narousing Chinese suspicions, crewmenwere supplied with Virginia tobacco and told to pass themselves off as Americans should they be questioned. Such precautions proved to be as superfluous as the voyage itself. Finding the estuary to all appearances blocked by sand bars, Gavrilovconcluded that the Amur was inaccessible to ocean-going vessels. Gavrilov's \"discovery\" undercut the strategic rationale for further reconnaissance, prompting Nicholas I to declare the matter closed, much to Nesselrode's relief. 14 Russian momentum toward the Amur revived under the impetus of a thirty-eight-year-old officer named Nikolai Muraviev, who, having distinguished himself in combat in the Caucasus and having attracted thefavorable attention ofNicholas I while serving as governorofTula, won appointment in 1847 as governor-general of Eastern Siberia. Muraviev was a convinced expansionist, yet his imperial convictions were leavened by a progressive credo that included liberation and land for serfs, a public judiciary and jury sy"
