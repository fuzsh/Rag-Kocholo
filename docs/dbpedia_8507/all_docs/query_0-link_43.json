        "text": "Known for his penchant for comedy, Ashwni Dhir, who has been associated with television serials like Lapataganj, Chidiyaghar and Hum Aapke Hain In Laws and films like One Two Three, Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge and Son of Sardaar makes a foray into romantic genre with serious undertones on the small screen with Ek Tha Chandar Ek Thi Sudha (ETCETS) based on Dharamvir Bharati’s iconic novel “Gunahon Ka Devta”.\n\n“Yes, I find comedy the best way to express different emotions, especially pain and connecting with viewers but making ETCETS is a dream-come-true for me.” He read the book when he was 17 and refers to it as the window which opened and initiated him into Hindi literature. “It was my first Hindi literature book and I was completed enchanted by it. Being a simple story I connected with it. Subsequently I have reread it several times and each time I have cried,” he says. He believes the writer’s reputation and the story will be enough to attract eyeballs to the show which will be competing with serials and reality shows of multiple genres. He also feels many after watching the show will definitely read the book.\n\nThe cult novel published in 1949 has had 71 editions. It is set in Allahabad and revolves around a young student, Chandar falling in love with Sudha, the daughter of his college professor and brings to fore the different shades of romance and love besides pain, heartache and other emotions. “So graphic and gripping is the tale that after reading it every boy feels like Chandar and every girl like Sudha,” comments Ashwni. Will the period romance connect with present generation? Unperturbed he replies in the affirmative and explains that selfless love which is willing to sacrifice itself is a timeless emotion and irrespective of the era it shown in, bound to attract young and old alike. “The hunger for affection is universal and even though we cannot imitate Chandar but all of us search for Sudha.”\n\nMaking the serial, Ashwni was confronted with the challenge of keeping the essence of the story and the flavour of the era intact while ensuring that it struck a chord with the audience. “I stuck to the original story without making any changes. Thus instead of making a long series wrapped it up in 20 episodes. To give an authentic feel to the show, we have used only those materials, props, dresses, vehicles, customs and traditions pertaining to that period besides concentrating on designing of sets and location shooting,” he informs. One change effected for adaptation was to depict India of 1960s instead of the late 40s in the novel. “I deliberately chose that time frame as that point the country was young and beautiful and moreover that phase is considered one of the golden phases of post-independent India,” explains the director.\n\nBeen aired on Life OK, Monday to Friday, 7 p.m.\n\nIt happened finally\n\nEven though the title “Gunahon Ka Devta” of Dharamvir Bharati’s iconic novel has been used twice by Bollywood – the 1967 film starring Jeetendra, Rajshree and Mehmood and later for Mithun Chakraborty, Sangeeta Bijlani and Danny Denzonga movie of 1990 but ironically both had nothing to do with the book.\n\nThe only known adaptation today of the story is a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri and Rekha in the lead roles though it never got released. Earlier attempts at visual adaptation of the novel never fructified. In fact Pushpa Bharati was approached by many but she was not convinced either by the project or the efforts she expected to put the iconic novel on screen.\n\nWhen Ashwni Dhir approached her, Pushpa Bharati was convinced of his interest and intent to do justice to the story. The director discloses that he was relieved when Pushpaji congratulated him after seeing the episodes."
