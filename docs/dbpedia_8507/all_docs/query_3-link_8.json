        "text": "Jeetendra stated \"Then came a film which once again set the ballrolling. DeviSharma wanted to boost Kumkum. He engaged P. L. Santoshi (Raj Kumar Santoshi's father) to direct the film andoffered the male lead to me. It was a black and white film. I didn't know whether to accept or refuse. I had not much of a choice though, so I eventually agreed. One day I went to Devi Sharma's house. He was drunk. I said to him that after working with Shantaramji, I wanted to do a film only with him. He felt flattered and said that he would begin a new film with me with a more famous costar and instead, get another hero for the P. L. Santoshi film. But he put the onus of getting a good heroine on me. And I knew just Rajshree. She naturally agreed to work with me but she asked for Rs. 3.25 lakhs, while Devi Sharma was prepared to pay her Rs. 3 lakhs. So I told the production manager to pay her Rs. 25,000 from my share of Rs. 55,000. Now I was left with Rs. 30,000. Devi Sharma wanted to hire a top music director. Once again he asked me to get him a music director. I was friendly with Jaikishan (of the Shankar- Jaikishan duo) and once again a difference in price threatened to shelve the project. This time too, I parted with Rs. 25,000 from my share. That means, eventually, I did the film for just Rs. 5,000. However, after Gunahon Ka Devta (that was the film) I never looked back."
