        "text": "Gunahon Ka Devta-Story so far\n\nPart 3\n\nA new family in town is doing pooja for their son to get a job. The family is none other than Prof Kranti Lal, his wife (Mami), Pawan (the son) and their niece Pihu (Arpita lookalike). Prof is a righteous man, who against injustice and violence while his wife doesn't like him constantly fighting about everything. Pawan and his sister Pihu share a special bond and the family is a loving one.\n\nNattay Thakur is introduce and he is jealous that AST rules Lallanpur, so he wants to pick a fight with him. He starts his game by threatening and misbehaving with Bhaoji. This infuriates Bhaoji, who relates the incident to AST. Bhaiyaji is back in full form wanting to teach Nattay Thakur a lesson for misbehaving with Bhaoji. So they have a fight in the town, where AST beats him black and blue. During the fight, he sees a girl, who looks like Arpita and gets distracted. Pawan takes away Pihu/Arpita while Nattay escapes from AST, who tries to look for Arpita/Pihu.\n\nBack at home the Lals discuss about the local gunda scene and AST's rule. The Prof and his wife have disagreement but are consoled by Pihu and Pawan (mama and mami are like the Middle East). Bhaoji invites Shika for Ramleela function but she's afraid because Tanmay wouldn't want to go but he tells her, they will go together while vowing revenge (I know evil like his brother).\n\nSo the functions takes place at a temple, where the Lals are present. Pihu/Arpita is dacing for the celebration. AST sees her thinks she is Arpita and everyone are shocked to see the striking resemblence. The Lals get angry at AST for misbehaving but Shika explains to them that Pihu looks like their dead Arpita. The Lals takes Pihu back home, leaving AST calling out 'Arpita'. The Merry Men bring AST back home, who is unconcious and they tell what had happened. Bhaoji gets suspicious over the lookalike issue. AST gets crazy over Pihu and becomes a mad stalker, which makes Pihu scared and the Lals angry. The Lals lodge a police report against AST, so Bhaoji goes to meet them asking to revoke the report as well as apologise. She asks to meet Pihu and gets the shock of her life seeing Arpita.\n\nAST continues to go gaga over Arpita/Pihu while Bhaoji schemes to get rid of Pihu (how many times she wants to do this is beyond me). The Lals are worried for Pihu's safety but she assures them all is well. Pihu get an apology letter from AST and reassures the family. One night on her way back from night classes, some goons misbehaves with her but AST comes to her aid. Pihu tells him off and stop this act. She accuses of him for setting up the goons, so that he will look good in her eyes. She further tells him not to do such a thing anymore because she would never like a gunda like him and he have to pay for his sins. The incident leaves the Lals even angrier but Pihu says she will continue with her classes, adding that she will fight for her family and their freedom.\n\nPihu is thoroughly annoyed by AST and hates him to the core. She feels he is the cause of their constant woes and misfortune but actually it's Bhaoji, who is behind it all. She has sabotaged Pawan and causing the Lals to have no peace at all as she plans one thing after another leading them to believe that AST is doing all this. Pihu ridicules and slaps AST, labeling him a scum and a sinner. Meanwhile Tanmay has begun his game by going to Natay Thakur to finish off AST.\n\nAST is wondering who is causing these problems for the Lals. Kanu says it has to be Natay Thakur doing all this saazish to create problem. AST goes to threaten Natay about messing with him, which leave Natay confused. One night AST goes to the Lals' house to explain about Natay but things get a bit tensed when AST accidentally pushes Pawan and Prof Kranti falls down while trying to help. Arpita/Pihu get super duper angry at AST, so she drags him outside and offers herself. She tells him to do what he wants and be done with it. This leave AST sad and humiliated because he is not a scum that Pihu/Arpita thinks he is. AST said that she is his wife and pride as well as the haveli's honour. He further adds that despite him being a gunda, he respects women and upholds honour, leading him to vow he will marry Pihu. AST adds that he will never bother her again.\n\nThe next day Pawan is sad that he was unable to protect Pihu but she cheers him up. It's his first day on his new job, so the family bless him but on the way he gets caught for drug dealing by the police. So he gets drag into prison coz they found more drugs in his room. Mami is very sad over what has happened and blames Prof Kranti. Meanwhile Bhaoji gloats that Prof Lal's 15-day challenge to bring AST down had foiled. So Bhaoji hatches another plan to hurt Pawan more.\n\nThe Lals are trying to save Pawan, who is jail but in need of money because the lawyer wants 1 lakh to fight the case. AST tries to help but the Lals refuse because they believe he is the cause of their misfortune.tt\n\nMama tries to arrange for some money for Pawan's lawyer by selling some of medals while Pihu gives her jewelry. At the pawn shop, Mama doesn't get as much money as he had expected, AST tries to offer but Mamaji snubs him off. At home, some goons steals the money Mamaji got from the pawnshop, misunderstanding against AST continues."
