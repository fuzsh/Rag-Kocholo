        "text": "In a world bustling with distractions, there is something truly magical about disconnecting from the chaos and immersing oneself in the serenity of nature to explore the depths of creative expression.

It offers a wide range of colourful story books based on the themes of life skills, healthy habits and sustainable development. These highly engaging colourful books stand out from the pack with their eye-catching illustrations and ample ‘learn with fun’ activities. Our Alpha Zone books are written by award-winning authors of children literature and super-talented doting young moms from across India and other foreign countries.\n\nBooks33:\n\noffers a wide range of fictional as well as non-fictional academic books in the domains of school education - primary, secondary and senior secondary and higher education – management, engineering and humanities.

With each book, you plant the seed of knowledge, nurturing a more informed and aware individual. Giving books as a green gift comes with a multitude of benefits, both for the recipient and the environment.\n\n“Nature is as complex – perhaps more – than we humans are. In this complexity, however, simple solutions can be found. And Books33 has done just that with its GEM Series – a collection of 17 titles. Katie Bagli’s charming story ‘Urvi and the Termite’, takes us inside the underground world into the depths of unseen spaces in the ‘Alice-in-Wonderland’ style. In building their homes, the termites work in harmony with the environment instead of damaging it. This is something that human beings certainly need to do as well.”\n\n“It is a unique series for it weaves the stories around important social issues such as inequality and quality education. Further, it orients children about Indian culture and ethos. What makes this series a must read is its simple and engaging manner through which heavy topics have been conveyed to little ones via discussion between children and Chumchumwalla. The authors are to be appreciated for maintaining the continuum in a very engaging manner”.\n\n“In an ever-changing world that is facing unprecedented challenges, we as parents are holding the responsibility to empower our children with important tools. Those that can help them create for themselves a wholesome, healthy and thriving world which they can live happily in. Towards this end, the exposure of kids to the Mission LiFE & UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals is of paramount importance. Katie and Pooja's simple yet profoundly meaningful children's stories help introduce sensitivity to these goals. I laud their initiative and recommend this as a MUST read for all children and parents”!\n\n“I read what the publisher and author stood for and without flipping through the pages, I blindly invested in this book set for my daughter. It offered a simple message in such a subtle way that it almost seemed an eye opener and it touched both daughter and Maas’ heart. Katie and Pooja say the simplest things we don’t think about in this ever-evolving world. It offers a message to slow down and acknowledge the goodness of what has been, what is and always will remain when we understand the true experience of being human”.\n\n“Children are always the forerunners in bringing significant change in the society. Stories are one of the most efficient methods of communication to convey messages, especially among children. Mrs Pooja brilliantly narrates this folktale, emphasising the importance of eradicating hunger. Every kid who reads this story can, one way or another, connect with all the characters very well. Each of her characters comes to life for all our young readers.”\n\n“I found the story ‘Isn’t this our Forest Ma?’ of the GEM Series, written by Katie Bagli both very moving and realistic. To write stories woven around the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the very young is an excellent idea as it very subtly directs the child towards a sustainable way of living and caring for our bountiful planet earth. ‘Isn’t this our Forest Ma?’ is very skilfully woven around the fabric of UN SDG 16 which is about Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions”\n\n“In GEM Series, there are 17 storybooks on various themes for children, such as courage, patience, confidence and so on. What sets Pooja’s book – ‘Mango and the Teak’ apart is that it teaches young minds the essential element of equality. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 10) of equality has remained a topic of concern. However, this is a beautiful attempt when the importance of equality is being conveyed to children through a story with a historical background. The author deserves accolades for her attempt”.\n\nThis picture book is such a delight to read. The book is beautifully illustrated with a good story line and strong vocabulary. I liked in this book is using the relations like ‘chachu’, ‘mamu’ and others which the kids are missing due to nuclear family... I must say the author has touched the chord of the heart with the sweet language used in the book..It’s a must read book for all the young kids.\n\nDr. Monica Khanna has come out with one more offering for you all. Such a wonderful and endearing story! It takes us to that time of our lives when we believed that everything around us is black or white. Childhood is so much fun and so full of innocence. The characters in this story are so believable, with human-like qualities. Kind, gentle, witty, intelligent, sharp, sly and so on... Each young reader will enjoy reading this story because it is so relatable. You can find people with such qualities all around you.\n\nKatie Bagli’s new book promises to bring back the concert we have missed ever since the pandemic hit us. She beautifully weaves science and fiction, urging her young readers to learn about the techniques used by the wetland musicians - the grasshoppers, the katydids and the hawkmoths. Then there are the subtle values and undertones that make for great learning for children the vacation in nature, the loving aunt, the dutiful bee, or even the love for the garden insects.\n\nKatie Bagli’s stories are filled with wild imagination yet grounded in facts.She brings to life the mundane and often overlooked facts with wit and humour, in her stories, as also in ‘The Insect Concert’. Her characters are driven by a moral so subtle that children may hardly realize the important life values they are imbibing just by reading her books. Her stories are lessons in science and art as each panel bursts into vivacious colours and tickles the imagination of the young reader. Truly delightful and a must read for all.\n\nThis book ‘Insect Concert’ by Katie Bagli is another gem from her treasure trove of stories about nature. Through a simple yet novel story, she manages to develop an interest in the animal kingdom and also provide a new learning. There are some activities too which children will enjoy. The illustrations add to the storyline and make the book more interesting for the young reader. I wish Katie more power to her pen.\n\nTo be hired in today’s global marketplace, employers demand more than basic ‘hard’ skills. The difference between a frustrated candidate and a sought-after recruit, the long-term worker and a compelling leader, or the stagnant professional and the rising manager can be the ‘soft’ skills each exercises in the workplace. This highly researched book analyses the job environment of today and for the future where ‘soft’ skills become a more critical attribute. The reader gleans valuable guidance on how to acquire and improve these ‘soft’ skills for a more enriching career.\n\nI’ve absolutely no hesitation in saying that even after working for 30+ years in Manufacturing and Education sectors, I was not able to correlate nonverbal communication skills of a person with his personality and credibility. But after getting in touch with Prof (Dr) Shalini Verma and going through her first book, ‘BODY LANGUAGE: YOUR SUCCESS MANTRA, (2005)’ I immediately fell in love with this beautiful subject and understood that body language is an important personality trait of any person. I am delighted to know that Dr Verma is bringing out a multi-title series of that inspiring book after 15 years, which is surely going to be another ‘hit’ and beneficial for the readers, especially the Gen Z youth, who gravely need the maturity to understand and cope with complex personal & professional relationships to move forward in life.\n\nOne may speak good English, bad English, good Hindi, bad Hindi, a mix of Hindi-English or 'Hinglish', Spanglish, Pig-Latin, Gibberish, Mumbling or Double-speak, the sub-text that one's body speaks is just ONE -- CREDIBLE or NOT CREDIBLE! Be aware of your body language. You can lie in your words, but the body never lies. We communicate through our Body all the time, even when we don't realize it. However, there are very few expertswho can deeply understand, analyse and decode Body Language. Dr Shalini Verma is one of them."
