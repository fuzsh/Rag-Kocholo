        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Tomb of Sand, originally written in Hindi by Geetanjali Shree and translated into English by Daisy Rockwell won the Booker International Prize this year. This has turned the spotlight on translations, translated literature, and translators in India.\n\nIn a country where 23 official languages are spoken, India is the fourth most linguistically diverse country in the world. In addition to spoken Languages and dialects, we have many languages widely spoken which don’t even feature as an official language. The Himalayan Writing Retreat is located in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. The local language here is Kumaoni, spoken by some 25 lakh people. Yet it is not one of the 23 official Languages. There is literature and books in Kumaoni as well.\n\nThat brings us to the most important question – where are all these books?\n\nIf you walk into a bookstore in India, the bulk of the books are in English. A few stores will have a Hindi section, which is again mostly translations of English hits like ” The Monk who sold his Ferrari” and “Atomic Habits“, a few old classics by Premchand and that’s it.\n\nOur stories depict our culture. They are our heritage. They hold the knowledge our ancestors wanted us to gain.\n\nPublishing houses like Aleph Books have been regularly releasing short story collections from different regional languages. Bengali, Odiya, Hindi, Tamil, Assamese, and Gujarati are some of the collections they have already released. Others are still in the pipeline. Many others like Westland Books, Speaking Tiger Books, Women Unlimited, Niyogi books, Juggernaut, and Harper Collins have also been releasing translated works from various Indian languages. Closer home, we have independent literary initiatives like The Indian History Collective and the Purple Pencil Project which are actively working on promoting translating literature.\n\nProminent translators like Arunava Sinha, GJV Prasad, Jerry Pinto, Shanta Gokhale, Tahira Naqvi, Rakshanda Jalil, Muhammed Umar Menon, etc have a huge role to play in bringing translated literature to global audiences.\n\nAuthors like Perumal Murugan have also been critically acclaimed after their works were available to wider audiences after being published in English.\n\nHow much do book translators earn in India?\n\nThe journey of translators in India is one of perseverance, passion, and a lot of patience. Translators in India do not make big amounts of money – not yet, anyway.\n\nOne of the reasons for this could be the lack of proper funding for translated projects. In 2015, a very prominent author (Name withheld on request) was paid INR 25,000/- for a book they translated. It took them two years to translate it. The result was a masterpiece that went on to win the Sahitya Akademi Award that year.\n\nWriter and Translator, Bhaskar Chattopadhyay adds to this thought, “Obviously there’s very little money in it if any at all. So if you want to translate literature, do it because you are passionate about it, not to earn a living. You need to have other means of income that can support you so that you can translate in your free time. And to tell you the truth, that’s enough. Unlike writing an original story, the act of translation does not require you to create something right from the scratch. So although there’s a lot of thinking that goes into the process of translation, it is never as much as if one were to write an original piece of literature. Therefore, it takes less time, which is good, because it hardly pays anything.” You can read more about Bhasker’s experiences with translations here.\n\nThe second reason is the reader’s acceptance of translated works. Readers read original writing more than translations.\n\nU.S.-based Indian writer Jenny Bhatt released Ratno Dholi – The best stories of Dhumketu (Harper Collins, 2019). It is a collection of short stories by prominent Gujarati author Dhumketu translated into English. “Some readers come to translations expecting it to read as if it’s an original English work and not translated. Some readers want to understand they’re reading something that was originally written in a different language. So readers have, in my experience, more wide-ranging responses to a translation than to original English work. This is not something we can control. To be honest, I’ve found professional book reviewers also having these wide-ranging responses too. There’s a lot to be said for the art of reviewing a translation. A lot of translators and book reviewers have discussed this in essays and on social media. I won’t get into much more here but I do think a translation merits a different reading and reviewing approach because it’s a different kind of literary, historical, and sociocultural artifact.” Jenny shares. She is now working on a collection of stories by another prominent Gujarati author Jhaverchand Meghani to be released by Pan Macmillan in 2023.\n\nWe’ve compiled a list of notable book translators in Indian languages.

The essence of what they told us was:\n\nBe it a translator, a writer, or a poet – the basics always remain the same. Write more. Read more. This is the basic key to improving your skill.\n\nTry to get your work published. There are many literary magazines where you can try getting your translated extracts published.\n\nFind a mentor who can guide you through this journey.\n\nLook out for translation grants and scholarships that can provide you with good exposure to not only improve your translation skills but also how to get a translation published.\n\nYou can also try your hand at some freelance translation projects to sharpen your skills further.\n\nIn addition to the above, you can now learn this craft from a Master. Arunava Sinha is teaching a Translations Masterclass at the Retreat. details here.\n\nA Publishing house chooses translators based on their experience and body of work. So building on that is the best way to get into the field. Your translations should reflect your love for the language.\n\nThe industry is changing in favour of translators. Books now credit the translator on the cover page. Awards and recognition help. The Booker International prize winners Daisy Rockwell and Geetanjali Shree – the translator and the author – get the same amount as prize money. There is hope that things will get better still in this field."
