Originally banned in its home country of China, where the director was under close government scrutiny for making the film "without permission", 'The Blue Kite' is one of the most acclaimed and controversial films to come out of the new Chinese cinema, detailing the realities of daily life under Mao's regime. Tian Zhuangzhuang's touching and humane story is reflected through the experience of young Tietou, following the trials, tribulations and devastation's of a Beijing family as they experience the political and social upheavals in 1950's and 60's China.

With two educated parents (a librarian and a school teacher) Tietou's upbringing is one surrounded by the bustle of growing political awareness. His parents, both loyal communist party members, learn that innocent criticism can at once be misinterpreted by the Party as imperialist propaganda, to the detriment of family peace and prosperity. Tietou observes these mounting pressures and the adverse effects of party policy on his family for fifteen years, learning to hold dear the values of his heritage and keep tight reins on the string of the precious blue kite given to him by his loving father.
