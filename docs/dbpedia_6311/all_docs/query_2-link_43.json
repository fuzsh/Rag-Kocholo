        "text": "Are you starting to see pink everywhere — even in places you would never expect?\n\nSince October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, I’m sure you’ve seen\n\npink ribbons on food items, apparel, sports equipment and even on NFL uniforms.\n\nWhy do so many products have pink ribbons on them, and claim to donate a part of their proceeds to breast cancer research?\n\nThese companies are all using an approach called cause marketing, where they establish a mutually beneficial partnership with a charitable organization to tout the charity’s “cause” and their affiliation with a worthy organization.\n\nIt’s all part of their strategic marketing plan to attract new customers and retain existing ones. And it works…when it’s done well.\n\nA great example is TOMS Shoes. For every pair of shoes bought, TOMS donates a new pair to a child in need. Philanthropy is at the heart of their entire business model — it’s woven into the fabric of every pair of shoes. They even win awards for their cause marketing.\n\nWhy Cause Marketing is Good Marketing\n\nIt’s a common approach used by big name brands. But you don’t have to be a Fortune 500 company to reap the benefits of incorporating cause marketing into your overall strategic marketing plan.\n\nSmall businesses have been doing it for decades by sponsoring Little League teams, local parks, highway cleanups and Kiwanis Clubs.\n\nCause marketing is a great way for businesses to achieve strategic communications goals, because it:\n\nOffers another way to reach potential customers who are part of your target audience;\n\nEndears your company to current customers, keeping them loyal to your brand;\n\nGives your company a heart and soul; and\n\nGives the impression that your company isn’t just about profits.\n\nIs Cause Marketing a Good Fit for Your Brand?\n\nYou can determine if cause marketing should be a component of your strategic marketing plan by asking a few questions.\n\nIs there a charitable cause that shares a similar target audience with your business?\n\nAre there ways that you can partner with a non-profit to benefit both organizations?\n\nAre you willing to collaborate with the organization, instead of just donating money?\n\nDo the goals of that organization align with the goals of your customers and employees?\n\nDo you feel passionate about the cause, does it align with your values or can you personally support it?\n\nHow To Do Cause Marketing the Right Way\n\nIf you’ve answered, “yes” to the questions above, cause marketing might be a good step for your company.\n\nBut, before you dive in head first, consider these general guidelines to set up your cause-related marketing program up for success.\n\n1. Be brand focused.\n\nPick something that relates to your brand, and the goals of your company. For example, Dawn partners with International Bird Rescue because bird rescues use Dawn dish detergent to wash oil and grease off of birds after oil spills. It’s a perfect arrangement, because the wildlife rescue uses Dawn, and the rescue can raise awareness for its cause through this brand behemoth.\n\n2. Consider your audience.\n\nPick something that speaks to your target audience. You want to attach yourself to an organization or cause that will be important for your customers and prospects, but still “on brand.”\n\n3. Consider public perception.\n\nLast year, a Wal-Mart store in Ohio openly held a food drive for employees who were in need. Wal-Mart attracted much criticism because holding a food drive for your own employees indicates that the employees are not paid enough to take care of themselves. Be sure you think through all the ways your cause marketing campaign could be construed.\n\n4. Avoid controversy.\n\nDon’t attach yourself to something too controversial, unless you’re prepared for a potential backlash. For instance, avoid hot-button issues, like reproductive rights, stem cell research, political parties, nuclear power or anything that might be considered too radical — unless you are willing to confront those issues.\n\n5. Try to pick an existing organization, instead of starting your own foundation.\n\nThis is especially important when you’re just starting out. That way, you can collaborate with another organization with its own audience.\n\n6. Get involved.\n\nReally dig into the cause.\n\nDon’t just write a check. Get involved and stay involved long-term.\n\n7. Do your research.\n\nMake sure you know the ins and outs of the organization you are about to collaborate with — you don’t want their bad PR to become your bad PR.\n\n8. Be transparent.\n\nBe open and transparent about what you actually do for the cause — how much money you donate or how else you support it. You will be fact-checked by outside organizations.\n\n9. Promote your involvement.\n\nDon’t be shy about publicizing the partnership, and your involvement in the cause. Take photos, issues news releases, release the results of your campaign and offer specific examples of your good work.\n\nJust like with any other marketing initiative, make sure you do your research and choose a strategic partnership that will benefit both organizations long-term."
