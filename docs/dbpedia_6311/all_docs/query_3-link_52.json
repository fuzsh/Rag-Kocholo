        "text": "Seven Days in May, American political thriller film, released in 1964, that addresses the paranoia and fear of the Cold War; the movie centres on the attempted overthrow of a U.S. president.\n\nFilmed in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis and amid worries of Armageddon, Seven Days in May involves an unpopular decision by the fictional U.S. president (Fredric March) to sign a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. The treaty is opposed by both the military and a vast majority of the public, who do not believe the Soviets can be trusted to keep their end of the deal. Burt Lancaster portrayed a charismatic general who devises a complex plan for a military takeover, and Kirk Douglas played his aide, who sympathizes with him but feels duty bound to prevent the coup d’état.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
