        "text": "1. Coriolanus (1607) by William Shakespeare\n\nWhose side is Shakespeare on? As always, it is difficult to tell. Coriolanus is an arrogant military patrician who proves indispensable to the state. The people’s tribunes have a legitimate grievance against a hero who has sanctioned civic starvation, while themselves being devious manipulators. Claimed as both an incitement to revolution and a piece of quasi-fascist hero-worship, the play is magnificently ambivalent.\n\n2. Fuenteovejuna (1619) by Lope de Vega\n\nThis is world drama’s “I am Spartacus” moment. When a brutally rapacious military commander is killed, the inhabitants of a Spanish village are tortured to disclose the name of his murderer. Their joint cry of “Fuenteovejuna did it” is a momentous tribute to the power of collective action. Yet Lope’s ultimate endorsement of monarchical authority suggests that even popular protest, here led by women, is tinged with historical irony.\n\n3. Mary Stuart (1800) by Friedrich Schiller\n\nNo one understood better than Schiller the devious machinations of politics. On the face of it this is a romantic tragedy about two warring queens, Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart. But the greatest scene shows Elizabeth beset by contradictory arguments about Mary’s fate. Some argue for execution, others for clemency, while Leicester ingeniously suggests that Mary should live “in the shadow of the axe”. This is power in action with each case reflecting the tactical acumen of the speaker.\n\n4. The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui (1941) by Bertolt Brecht\n\nAny number of Brecht plays would qualify but this is the one that has proved most distressingly relevant to our times. Brecht tells the story of the rise of Hitler, from his beginnings to the occupation of Austria, in terms of Chicago gang warfare. Arturo is one of the great roles in modern drama, and when the actor who plays him finally turns to the audience and says of the hero, “the bitch that bore him is in heat again”, we hear a chillingly accurate prophecy.\n\n5. The Crucible (1953) by Arthur Miller\n\nMiller’s historical drama about the Salem witch trials of 1692 was inspired by Senator Joe McCarthy’s House Un-American Activities Committee and its persecution of suspected communists. Yet the play has unexpected resonances today. It is about a community plagued by guilt, suspicion and fear. As Yaël Farber’s 2014 revival at the Old Vic reminded us, the politics includes an older man’s abuse of his power over a young girl.\n\n6. The Party (1973) by Trevor Griffiths\n\nOne of the great neglected modern plays. Griffiths’ theme is the reasons for the failure of revolution in Britain. His chosen form is dialectical debate. An LSE lecturer, a Glaswegian Trotskyite and a northern playwright all put their case with Shavian fervour in the drawing room of a leftwing TV producer. But the key line belongs to the hard-headed old Trot who argues: “You enjoy biting the hand that feeds you but you’ll never bite it off.”\n\n7. Top Girls (1983) by Caryl Churchill\n\nCan you have feminism without socialism? That was the question posed by Churchill in this haunting, formally inventive play. Written when Thatcherism was in full flow, it shows the dynamic head of an employment agency denying her working-class roots – and her own daughter – in the pursuit of power. Only at the end does Churchill’s protagonist realise the dubious bargain she has made in adopting inherited masculine definitions of success.\n\n8. One for the Road (1984) by Harold Pinter\n\nA high-ranking government official confronts three of his imprisoned torture victims. We think we know where we stand. But Pinter, with immense subtlety, shows that the power-wielding Nicolas, while relying on a righteous belief in the family, the state and religion, is a deeply flawed and insecure figure who cannot grasp either the instinctive personal loyalties or the principled morality of the people at his mercy.\n\n9. Blasted (1995) by Sarah Kane\n\nIt may seem hypocritical to include this, since I was one of the many critics who attacked Kane’s play on its first showing. While I still think the piece has flaws, repeated viewings have convinced me of its moral and political force. Showing a civil war erupting into a Leeds hotel room, it passionately argues there is an umbilical link between the pain people inflict on each other and the brutality of public violence.\n\n10. Stuff Happens (2004) by David Hare\n\nMixing documented fact with imaginative speculation, Hare’s play examined the political process that drove the United States, with British support, to go to war with Iraq. Everything we have learned since has justified Hare’s arguments: that the Bush administration was preoccupied with regime change, that it cynically used 9/11 as a pretext for invasion and that it relentlessly crushed internal opposition. Perhaps the timeliest lesson today is the reckless folly for the UK of being permanently tied to American coat-tails."
