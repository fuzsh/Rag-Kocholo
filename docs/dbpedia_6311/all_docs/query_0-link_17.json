Told from the perspective of a young boy, Tietou, it traces the fate of a Beijing family and their neighbors as they experience the political and social upheavals in 1950s and 60s China.\n\nTietou's parents, a librarian and school teacher, both loyal communist party members, soon learn that even the most innocent criticisms can be interpreted by the Party as imperialist propaganda. Over the next fifteen years, Tietou observes the adverse effects of party policy on various members of his family. The only image of hope and freedom offered in teh film is a blue kite given to Tietou by his father which he later passes on to the next generation.\n\nDVD - Kino International\n\nMandarin with English subtitles\n\nWidescreen Letterboxed format\n\nCurator's Comments:\n\nRead Roger Ebert's essay on this DVD Classic.\n\nDirector: Tian Zhuanghuang\n\nColor\n\n138 minutes\n\nReleased: 1994\n\nRated: NR\n\nCountry: China\n\nLanguage: Mandarin with English subtitles\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nlibrary pricing and ordering"
