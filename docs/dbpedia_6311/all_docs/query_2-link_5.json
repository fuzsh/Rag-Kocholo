        "text": "THERE IS A SAYING IN CHINA: When two people talk, they tell the truth; when three people talk, it becomes a joke; when more than three people talk, it is all lies. Tian Zhuangzhuang, the Chinese director whose \"Blue Kite\" will open on Friday in New York, quoted this saying at dinner recently. In attendance were his translator; Lu Liping, the star of the movie and one of China's most popular actresses, and Peng Xia Lin, a director friend of Mr. Tian's. \"Of course, this meeting is the exception,\" Mr. Tian said, laughing.\n\nThe 42-year-old director, who lives in Beijing, was in New York for a brief visit on behalf of his film, whose themes are truth and deception, face and mask, censorship and ritual -- in other words, how the domestic and the political intertwine.\n\n\"The Blue Kite,\" which opened last year's Cannes International Film Festival and, at the Tokyo International Film Festival, won awards for best film and best actress, is about a Beijing family from 1953 to the late 60's. Less obviously political than Chen Kaige's \"Farewell My Concubine,\" which covers much the same period, Mr. Tian's film steers a course through domestic life. Aunts and uncles sit around tables; youngsters play on red-tiled roofs; mothers have hopes and fears for their children; the winter silence in the courtyard is broken only by a cat's meow.\n\nThe narrator is a boy named Tietou, whose childhood overlaps the Cultural Revolution. The kite in the title is made by Tietou's father just before he is sent away to a labor camp. Tietou's mother (Ms. Lu) is married and widowed two more times; other family members marry, fall ill, recover or die. Some are imprisoned; some are ardent Maoists; some dream of the Great Society; others merely survive. The child grows into a willful youngster and, by the film's end, a rebellious adolescent.\n\nRichard Pena, the director of the New York Film Festival, which showed the film last fall, said of \"The Blue Kite\": \"It's not about action, it's about atmosphere. It's the first film to really address how political and personal oppression just became a day-to-day affair. How you'd get up every morning and you'd live with it every day, and it affected who you married, who you made love to, where you got a job. Everything.\n\n\"As good as he's been in the past,\" Mr. Pena said of Mr. Tian, \"with this new film he's reached a new level.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
