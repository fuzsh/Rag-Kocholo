        "text": "At once a family drama and a coming-of-age story that spans the years 1949 to 1967, the film tells how thirteen-year-old Tietou (\"Iron Head\") is raised by his young mother, Chen Shujuan, who has had three marriages. A primary school teacher, Chen first marries a librarian who is later branded a rightist and sent to a \"reform camp\" where he dies from an accident. His colleague, Li Guodong, who unwillingly informed on him, marries Chen out of guilt. But soon after the marriage, he also dies from weak health, the result of a widespread famine across the country in the late Fifties. Chen once again remarries, this time to a government official who also meets his fate at the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966...\n\nTian Zhuangzhuang\n\nTian Zhuangzhuang was born in 1952. His parents were actors. He was only fourteen when the Cultural Revolution broke out Two years later he was sent to the countryside to be \"re-educated\" by the peasantry. In 1978 he passed rigorous examination to enroll in the directing department of the Beijing Film Academy. Together with classmates Chen Kaige, Zhang Yimou, Peng Xiaolan and Wu Ziniu, he is a member of the \"Fifth Generation\" of Chinese filmmakers that launched the new wave Chinese cinema in the mid-Eights. In 1989, he was one 33 people to sign an open letter calling for the release of political prisoners, the only member of the film community to do so.\n\nFILMOGRAFIA\n\nWomende jiaoluo (1982), Xiatande jingli (1983), Hong xiang (1983), Lieshang zhasa (1984), Dou ma Zai (1985), Da taijian Li Lianying (1990), Lan Fengzheng (The Blue Kite, 1993).\n\n\"I finished shooting Lan Feng zheng one year ago, in 1992. But while I was involved in post-production, there was an investigation by one of the official organizations involved in China's film industry and they decided that the film had a problem in terms of its political 'leanings', and prevented the film from being completed. The fact that it can be seen in its finished version is thanks to many friends in the film world who have worked to see in through to completion.\" (Tian Zhuangzhuang)"
