        "text": "Rebel Moon is a movie that has something to say about politics.\n\nYou don’t name your movie “Rebel Moon” if you don’t want to talk about politics. You don’t dress your villains in Nazi uniforms or hang big red banners under them when they’re talking. You don’t make your characters generals and princes and give them portentous speeches about dying for their principles.\n\nBut, uh… what are those principles? Like, precisely. What are we saying about politics anyway?\n\nThere’s this other movie that Rebel Moon reminded me of every once and a while. You might have heard of it if you’re into sci-fi; it’s called Star Wars. Other than being about a hero who lives in a small farming community but must go to war against an evil space empire led by someone who is their father, it’s pretty different. I bring it up because I think it’s a useful baseline for coherent politics in a space action movie.\n\nThe original Star Wars trilogy did not have especially deep politics, but they were clear. The rebels had a political agenda. They were fighting for a Republic against an enemy that’s an Empire. Sure, one of them is technically a princess, but it’s pretty obvious that it’s some kind of constitutional monarchy situation. She doesn’t rule absolutely, because Star Wars is against absolute power. It wants democratic, or at least representative power. And it sticks to that.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that when Star Wars names the soldiers of its evil Empire “the Stormtroopers” it’s pretty obvious why it did that. The Empire is all about absolute power. So were the Nazis. Absolute power is bad. It’s simple, it’s clear, it’s all we need.\n\nLet’s look back at Rebel Moon.\n\nThe first thing you notice is that the rebels here don’t have any political project, or, at least, not one we’re aware of. Many of them come from conquered worlds who seem to want their planets to be free. That could be something. But confusingly, the film has nothing but sympathy for the ruling family of this Imperium, the ones who initially conquered all these planets. The princess is presented to us as a kind of savior figure who uses holy white light to bring a bird back to life. The opening narration tells us that there was no talk of revolution until the king died.\n\nSo it’s good to be ruled by a King, but bad to be ruled by a general?\n\nThen there’s the spider lady.\n\nAt some point, the characters end up watching while a cool lady with cool swords that glow fights a child-eating spider lady. This is nice. I like neat looking monsters and I like it when space movies have swords that glow.\n\nOnly here’s the thing. Rather than just having her be a monster, the spider lady gives a sad speech about how she is actually the native species on this planet, but colonists have taken the planet from her and destroyed it, making it impossible for her to live. Kidnapping and eating a child is her way of rebelling. It’s a very obvious parallel to the situation of our main character, whose farming village is being destroyed by the demands of the Imperium.\n\nSo, rebelling is bad and you should instead conform to the society of the people who have conquered you? That can’t be right. Maybe it’s that rebels still have a responsibility not to hurt innocents? I agree with that, but it never even gets mentioned as a theme again.\n\nSo rebellion is good, except when it’s bad, and empires are cool except when they’re evil. Everything gets kicked off by the Imperium demanding grain from a farming village, but even then, it only really became a problem when they demanded too much and were kind of nasty about it.\n\nAnd that, I think, is the key to understanding Rebel Moon: nastiness. When General Noble leaves the farming village after demanding food, a squadron of troops remain behind. These troops are immediately shown to be vulgar and horrible. They harass a young woman, gloat about kicking people out of their home and eventually try to do something, uh, very unpleasant. They’re nasty.\n\nBut also, there’s one good soldier, who fights them. And so does the robot, who, unlike them, is programmed to be a perfect soldier. Soldiers aren’t the problem. The problem is that these particular soldiers happen to be nasty.\n\nGeneral Noble is deeply sadistic and weird. He carries around a metal bone that he uses to kill people, for some reason, gets groped by some kind of leech octopus thing for pleasure and his commander, General Belisarius, is somehow even weirder. They’re nasty. The King and his angelic daughter ruled wisely, but these guys are real jerks.\n\nRemember the spider lady? That was her problem too. She was nasty. She was eating a kid, for pete’s sake. And that’s exactly what the sword woman chides her for: being nasty. It’s not about the spider lady’s situation; it’s about her personal character.\n\nBeing nasty is an aesthetics problem. And Rebel Moon, like most Zach Snyder projects, is a world ruled by aesthetic. Everyone we see is either horrible, repulsive and ugly, or noble, good and beautiful. The problem of this world is not domination. It’s domination by the repulsive and ugly people, the ones who are nasty. Power is noble, as long it’s held by a person who’s noble. Power doesn’t have to be questioned or reshaped. It must simply be pried from the weird generals and the gay pig monsters so it can be returned, rightfully, to the princes and the kings.\n\nAll movies use aesthetic; you always want to make your villains exciting and your heroes lovable. But Rebel Moon has nothing but contradictions underneath its aesthetic. It is a film that needs its villains to act despicably because otherwise we wouldn’t know they are the villains. There’s nothing beneath the aesthetics to guide us.\n\nThis movie is about politics, but it’s a politics governed by aesthetic. And that kind of politics will always be incoherent, because aesthetics are personal. Aesthetics don’t arise from the power being wielded, but from the person doing the wielding. Change the person and the aesthetic changes, even if the situation doesn’t.\n\nBut beneath our aesthetic, beneath what we seem, there is a reality. There is what we do, and perhaps, even more important, what happens.\n\nAn empire ruled by someone like the angelic princess has a very different aesthetic than one ruled by a psychosexual weirdo like General Belisarius. But how big is that difference, really? How much does it really change who has to appeal to who, whose interests will actually get represented and whose will be quietly pushed to the side? How much does it change the actual shape of the world, its incentives and the outcomes it tends towards?\n\nAesthetics is the details of politics. It has a place. But it’s not the big picture. It is the trees, but not the forest.\n\nRebel Moon is a very pretty film. It has some cool ideas, and if it’s successful enough to develop an extended universe, there might be some really neat stuff in there. But it is an incoherent film, and that is because it is a film that struggles to ever look past the surface. The surface is exciting. It thrills us and draws out deep, visceral reactions. But the world is controlled by deeper currents, and if we want to develop a politics that means anything, or make movies that feel satisfying, we have to be willing to face them."
