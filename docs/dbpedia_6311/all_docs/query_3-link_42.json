        "text": "Politics has always been an essential part of our lives. Whether we like it or not, every decision our leaders make affects our daily lives, so we must educate ourselves on how the system works. One powerful tool for understanding politics is through documentaries. While there are numerous documentaries out there, we've narrowed it down to fifteen good political documentaries and the best best geopolitical documentaries that you wonâ€™t want to miss.\n\nThe films on todayâ€™s list provide general audiences with a deeper understanding of the policies and politics that effect our daily lives.\n\n1. American Factory (2019)\n\nAmerican Factory is one of the yearâ€™s most important documentaries, tackling over a decade of factory-driven politics on a global scale. It covers the story of a factory opened in post-industrial Ohio, owned and operated by a Chinese billionaire.\n\nThe movie is distributed by Netflix, and produced by Higher Ground Productions: a fledgling production company owned by the Obama family. American Factory has won an Academy Award for Best Documentary, praised by the industry for its style and themes of great social importance.\n\nAmerican Factory on Wikipedia\n\n2. Knock Down the House (2019)\n\nKnock Down the House is another Netflix picture dealing with a recent and topical subject. It follows the campaigns of unlikely democratic candidates who won their seats in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThe project was launched as a Kickstart campaign, only a day after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. Thereâ€™s no doubt that creator Rachel Lears supports the candidates covered, but the film doesnâ€™t go overboard with pushing an agenda, focusing instead on the story at hand.\n\nKnock Down the House on Wikipedia\n\n3. The Great Hack (2019)\n\nThereâ€™s no shortage of topics to discuss when it comes to the 2016 election, and this film focuses on the role social media played. In particular, it covers Facebook, and the Cambridge Analytica data scandal that arguably affected the electionâ€™s outcome. The company had a role in both US and British Brexit campaigns, and The Great Hack explores the ways in which both are intertwined.\n\nThe documentaryâ€™s theme goes far beyond these individual elections, scrutinizing the role tech will play in the future of global politics. The film received positive reviews, particularly for its ability to discuss such a complicated topic in an engaging, informative way.\n\nThe Great Hack on Factual America.\n\n4. The Edge of Democracy (2019)\n\nThe Edge of Democracy is a Brazilian documentary film directed by Petra Costra. It details the Brazilian political crisis of 2014 through the impeachment of Dilma Rouseff, and the first-term presidency of Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. The film was nominated for an Oscar, and premiered at Sundance in 2019.\n\nThe film showcases how citizens were betrayed by presidents of both parties, outlining the proof that the politics of Brazil are likely to change with new administration. The current administration of Brazil spoke out in opposition of the film, claiming that it misrepresents the history of the country.\n\nThe Edge of Democracy on Wikipedia\n\n5. Running with Beto (2019)\n\nBeto Oâ€™Ruorke ran for United States Senate in 2018, in the deeply conservative state of Texas. Running With Beto follows that campaign, which despite its failure was the springboard that launched Beto into the waters of national politics. The film is produced by David Modigliani, and was picked up by HBO for their new streaming service.\n\nThe film is definitely pro-Beto in its tone, but that isnâ€™t to say that itâ€™s a propaganda film. Its biggest merit stems from the energy and excitement generated by the campaign, in a state where no one thought it was possible for a democrat to garner such momentum.\n\nðŸ‘‰ Watch Running with Beto on Amazon Prime\n\n6. RBG (2018)\n\nRBG is a political documentary about the life and career of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Directed by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, the film provides a detailed look at Ginsburg's extensive work on advancing gender equality and civil rights.\n\nThrough interviews with Ginsburg and colleagues, RBG paints a portrait of a woman who defied expectations and broke down barriers to become one of the most influential political figures in American history. This documentary film is a celebration of her legacy and is a testament to the power of perseverance and conviction.\n\nðŸ‘‰ Watch RBG on Amazon Prime\n\nðŸ‘‰ Buy RBG as DVD on Amazon\n\n7.
