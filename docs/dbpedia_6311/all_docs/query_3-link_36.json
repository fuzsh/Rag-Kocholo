        "text": "15. THE IDES OF MARCH (2011)\n\nDirector: George Clooney. Writers: George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon, based on Willimon’s play “Farragut North.” Starring George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright.\n\n“The Ides of March” is not so much about governing but doing what needs to be done to get a chance to govern. A Pennsylvania governor who is running for President, relies greatly on his aide to make sure that he has the endorsement of a powerful N.C. Senator who controls enough delegates to get his boss the nomination. The behind-the-scenes machinations of getting a Presidential nomination can be very ugly, and “The Ides of March” gets all of its ugliness down perfectly. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n14. ADVISE & CONSENT (1962)\n\nDirected by Otto Preminger. Written by Wendell Mayes, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Allen Drury. Starring Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Don Murray, Walter Pidgeon.\n\nUnlike “Dr. Strangelove,” “Advise and Consent,” despite its pedigree, has not dated incredibly well. It’s about old-school politics (very old school politics) and even has a cringe-worthy subplot about a politician who is outed for being gay and kills himself. But it’s on the list because it offers a fascinating window as to how politics worked in the early 1960s, and when you have actors of the caliber of Fonda, Murray, Pidgeon and especially Laughton (who’s incredibly hammy and absolutely wonderful), you’ve got a film that’s both out-of-date and at times offensive but is always fascinating. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n13. THE CANDIDATE (1972)\n\nDirector: Michael Ritchie. Writer: Jeremy Larner. Starring Robert Redford, Peter Boyle, Don Porter.\n\n“The Candidate” is a campaign-based political film, with the Oscar-winning script by Jeremy Larner focusing on the U.S. Senate campaign of California Democrat Bill McKay, a novice politician who is being set up as a sacrificial lamb against the sure-thing campaign of Republican Sen. Crocker Jarmon who is expected to skate to reelection. With no hope for McKay to win, campaign manager Marvin Lucas gives his candidate the green light to say anything he wants on the campaign trail, a fresh approach that begins to catch on among voters. But as McKay’s poll numbers suddenly begin to rise, the pressure grows on him to moderate his views so that he can actually garner enough votes to win. It is at times a brutally realistic look at what it takes to win an election in America. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n12. DAVE (1993)\n\nDirector: Ivan Reitman. Writer: Gary Ross. Starring Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Frank Langella.\n\n“Dave” proves that a film doesn’t have to be a serious think-piece to be politically perceptive. Thought by many to be the smartest political comedy ever made, “Dave” deals with the issue of Presidential image. Dave Kovic has a side job as a dead-ringer impersonator of President Bill Mitchell and has been used by the White House to cover up the President’s extramarital affair. When events secretly happen to impair President Mitchell’s ability to serve, Dave is brought in maintain the President’s image, and that includes posing as her husband to First Lady Ellen Mitchell. Though a comedy, “Dave” just nails the issue of the importance of Presidential image continuity. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n11. THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT (1995)\n\nDirector: Rob Reiner. Writer: Aaron Sorkin. Starring Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox.\n\nIn what in hindsight looks like a warmup for his landmark TV drama “The West Wing,” writer Aaron Sorkin blends a tale of legislative bill-passing with romance as a widower American President who falls for an environmental lobbyist. While considered by many to be one of Rob Reiner’s most solid pieces of direction, the film is largely remembered for Sorkin’s sparkling dialogue, as well as his insight into the day-to-day process of governing a country. Add to that top-notch performances, particularly by Douglas and Bening, and you get one of the most fondly-remembered political films of all time. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n10. ALL THE KING’S MEN (1949)\n\nWriter/Director: Robert Rossen, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren. Starring Broderick Crawford, John Ireland, Mercedes McCambridge.\n\nThis barely-disguised fictionalization of the rise of the colorful 1930s Louisiana governor Huey Long still stands as one of the great political films of all time. Focusing on a small-time local politician who, through manipulation and his own street smarts, riles up the populace against governmental bureaucracy, but once he gets into office, falls victim to the same bureaucracy that he built his reputation opposing. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n9. LINCOLN (2012)\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg. Writer: Tony Kushner. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nUnlike many political films, “Lincoln” is not about the ballyhoo of campaigning but instead focuses on what Washingtonians call the “sausage-making” — the sometimes ugly process by which a bill, through compromising, cajoling and even (when necessary) blackmailing, becomes a law. In the case of “Lincoln,” the law in question is actually the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery in the United States, and President Abraham Lincoln realized that with the Civil War soon to end, pro-slavery states may be about to re-enter the union, and he has got to have this amendment passed now. Detailing just what it takes to get a Constitutional amendment passed helps to make “Lincoln” one of the great political films of all time. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n8. BULWORTH (1998)\n\nDirector: Warren Beatty. Writers: Warren Beatty & Jeremy Pikser. Starring Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt.\n\nIf Alexander Payne’s “Election” is a sharp satire on a small scale, Warren Beatty’s “Bulworth” is equally sharp but on a grand scale. U.S. Sen. Jay Bulworth, about to lose a reelection campaign to a young upstart, decides to end his life, but so that his daughter can be set up financially (which would not happen if he obviously killed himself), he arranges to have himself assassinated. With that decision, Bulworth finds himself free to publicly smoke pot and say whatever he feels like saying. This has been a dream of many real-life politicians, including President Obama, who said in 2013 that he “talked longingly of ‘going Bulworth.'” Any film that has that much influence in the White House belongs in anyone’s Top 15 political films. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n7. A FACE IN THE CROWD (1957)\n\nDirector: Elia Kazan. Writer: Budd Schulberg. Starring Andy Griffith, Patricia Neal, Walter Matthau.\n\nIn the age of Donald Trump, Kazan’s film so prescient in his depiction of a drifter who, under the guidance of a sharp-eyed producer, not only becomes a media star but an influential tastemaker on the political front. Not necessarily about politics, it so parallels the rise of Trump that its repercussions are even more relevant today than they were nearly 60 years ago. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n6. THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962)\n\nDirector: John Frankenheimer. Writer: George Axelrod. Starring Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury.\n\nThere’s never been a film quite like the 1962 version of “The Manchurian Candidate” (the 2004 remake starring Denzel Washington tried to come close but didn’t), and it doesn’t easily fit in with the other political films which concern themselves with campaigning or lawmaking. “The Manchurian Candidate” is much more about the brainwashing of a U.S. soldier who is manipulated into assassinating a Presidential nominee, and politics permeates the entire film, particularly in the film’s greatest performance by Angela Lansbury, as Harvey’s mother (although she was only three years older than Harvey at the time) who seeks to undermine the political process by violence. Great stuff! Uploaded in 2016.\n\n5. WAG THE DOG (1997)\n\nDirector: Barry Levinson. Writers: Hillary Henkin & David Mamet. Starring Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Anne Heche.\n\nIf many of the other political films are about candidates, “Wag the Dog” looks at politics from the point of view of the consultants — those individuals whose job it is when political candidates find themselves in trouble, they dangle some bright shiny new object to distract the press in following a potentially troublesome issue. In the case of “Wag the Dog,” it’s an attempt to to distract a potentially damaging sex scandal with the President canoodling with an underage girl by creating a fake war with Albania (!!!???!). It sounds ludicrous, but the strategy of “Wag the Dog” has often been cited by politicos over the past 20 or so years, and its influence will likely be felt in years to come. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n4. ELECTION (1999)\n\nDirector: Alexander Payne. Writers: Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein and Matthew Broderick.\n\nThe only film on this list that doesn’t deal with national politics, Alexander Payne’s “Election” focuses instead on a high school race for student council president, where the overly-prepared Tracy Flick suddenly has to face a popular high school jock. But the lessons of what happens in “Election” can be applied to any high-stakes election, and that is the brilliance of the film (any similarity between Tracy Flick and a candidate currently running for President is eerily coincidental). Co-writers Payne and Jim Taylor’s prescience at what the political scene would be like nearly two decades later is what makes “Election” great. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n3. ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN (1976)\n\nDirector: Alan J. Pakula. Writer: William Goldman. Starring Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Robards.\n\nAlthough it could be argued that “All the President’s Men” is more of a film about journalism than about politics, the impact that journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward have had upon American political history is unquestionable. Pakula made the very wise decision to make his film about the journalists who uncovered the depths of the Watergate scandal a detective story of sorts, so that it had a comfortable genre feel while still deconstructing the political elements that drove the Watergate conspirators. And to many Americans, especially those born after 1976, “All the President’s Men” is how they remember Watergate, and to have a film that wields that kind of influence over several generations, is a special political movie indeed. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n2. DR. STRANGELOVE OR; HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB (1964)\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick. Writers: Stanley Kubrick, Terry Southern, Peter George. Starring Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens.\n\nAn indisputable classic of American cinema, Stanley Kubrick’s savage satire of the fears at the time of a nuclear conflict between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. is black comedy at its darkest. Kubrick’s much-admired film somehow finds humor in a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union ordered by an off-the-rails U.S. Air Force general. That move brings in a mild-mannered U.S. President, a British RAF officer and ex-Nazi nuclear war expert Dr. Strangelove (all played by Peter Sellers). The film was released in a post-Cuban missile crisis time when the possibility of nuclear war was very much on the minds of the American people and had already spawned “Fail-Safe,” a best-selling book that was turned into a serious Henry Fonda movie. Kubrick’s daring approach to make this the subject of a comedy was a bold move at the time and has held up extraordinarily well in the last 52 years. Uploaded in 2016.\n\n1. MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (1939)\n\nDirector: Frank Capra. Writer: Sidney Buchman. Starring James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Harry Carey.\n\nOne of the most beloved political films of all time, Frank Capra’s classic focuses on Jeff Smith, a reformist who is picked over the political machine stooge to fill a Senate seat with the hope that he can be easily manipulated. It turns out, he cannot. The film’s most memorable moments involve a lengthy filibuster where Mr. Smith speaks for an exhausting numbers of hours on behalf of an appropriations bill and against efforts to disgrace him on a bogus charge. Simply said, an American classic. Uploaded in 2016."
