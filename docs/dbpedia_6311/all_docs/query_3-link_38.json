        "text": "Applicable for the 2024-2025 academic year.\n\nPolitical science prepares students for a variety of careers, public and private, including those directly related to politics and those based on graduate training. Departmental requirements are designed not just to prepare students for graduate school, but to give all majors broad exposure to politics and ready them for responsible citizenship in the contemporary world.\n\nMajor Requirements\n\nBasic Requirement: Must complete 10 units in the Department of Political Science\n\n*AP courses do NOT count towards the Political Science major\n\nI. Introductory\n\nThe department offers courses in four sub-fields: United States Politics and Government, Political Theory, Comparative Politics, and International Relations. The Catalog of Courses indicates the departmental offerings by sub-field, and a current list is included below.\n\nBasic Requirement: Must complete 10 units in the Department of Political Science\n\nI. Introductory\n\nThe department offers courses in four sub-fields: United States Politics and Government, Political Theory, Comparative Politics, and International Relations. The Catalog of Courses indicates the departmental offerings by sub-field, and a current list is included below.\n\nStudents must take:\n\n1) In the United States Politics and Government subfield:\n\nPS200 - United States Politics and Government\n\n2) In the International Relations subfield:\n\nPS209 - Introduction to International Relations*\n\n3) In the Comparative subfield:\n\nPS236 - Introduction to Comparative Politics\n\n4) In the Political Theory subfield:\n\nPS290 Introduction to Political Philosophy\n\nStudents are strongly advised to take the prescribed courses at the 200 level before taking courses at the 300 level.\n\n*Students entering CC in AY 2024-25 or later (graduating class of 2028 and beyond) must take PS209 (Introduction to International Relations) as their introductory IR course.\n\nStudents who entered CC prior to AY 2024-25 (graduating classes of 2027 and previous) may take either PS209 (Introduction to International Relations) OR PS225/PS340 (Conduct of US Foreign Policy) as their introductory IR course. Please note that the course number for Conduct of US Foreign Policy was PS225 prior to AY 2024-25, and changed to PS340 as of AY 2024-25. Students in this category may choose to take both PS209 and PS225/PS340. In qualifying circumstances where students take both courses, PS209 (Introduction to International Relations) will count as the introductory IR course and PS225/PS340 (Conduct of US Foreign Policy) will count as an upper-level IR elective.\n\nII. Sub-field Distribution\n\nA minimum of 10 units in the Department of Political Science is required, to include the following:\n\n1) Two units in each of four subfields. In each subfield, students must take A) the prescribed course or one of the prescribed courses, and B) one additional course in that subfield.\n\n2) A tutorial in one subfield selected for emphasis. Students who are admitted to write theses are exempt from the tutorial requirement.\n\n3) One additional course to reach the 10-unit minimum. The elective may not be the internship courses, 231 or 233. In addition to the regular courses offered by the department, students may count as their elective one of the following courses: a Topics in Politics course (203), an independent study (402), or one course taken at another institution, in the United States or abroad.\n\nIII. Study Abroad\n\nStudents earning political science credit in off-campus programs or study at other institutions may qualify for relief from the 10-unit rule. However, the department believes a degree in political science from Colorado College means that majors did most of their work here. The department will normally count one unit of political science in an off-campus program toward the basic ten units. Any use of non-CC credit toward the major must have the approval of the student's departmental advisor or the department chair.\n\nIV. Distinction\n\nDistinction in political science will be awarded based on a graduating senior’s cumulative GPA in courses within the major.\n\nV. Thesis\n\nProposals to write a senior thesis must normally be submitted by the beginning of the final block of the student’s junior year, but a student studying off campus at the end of the junior year may submit a proposal in the first week of Block 1 of the senior year.\n\nVI. Transfer Students\n\nThe department chair will consider granting credit toward the major for courses taken at another institution prior to admission to Colorado College at the time the student declares the major. Advanced Placement courses in high school may count toward total units for graduation and should be taken into consideration when selecting courses for the major. They do not, however, qualify for relief from the 10-unit rule.\n\nMinor Requirements\n\nA minor in political science enables students to complete a course of study within one of the subfields in the major. Completion of a minor in political science requires five courses, distributed as follows and chosen in consultation with an adviser in the department:\n\n1) One of the following: 200 in the United States politics and government subfield; 209 in the international relations subfield*; 236 in comparative politics; 290 in the political theory subfield.\n\n2) Three upper-division courses in the minor subfield, including at least one 300-level course for which the student has completed the prerequisite. A course in another subfield can be substituted for one of these three courses upon consultation with the minor advisor.\n\n3) A tutorial in the minor subfield.\n\n*Students entering CC in AY 2024-25 or later (graduating class of 2028 and beyond) must take PS209 (Introduction to International Relations) as their introductory IR course.\n\nStudents who entered CC prior to AY 2024-25 (graduating classes of 2027 and previous) may take either PS209 (Introduction to International Relations) OR PS225/PS340 (Conduct of US Foreign Policy) as their introductory IR course. Please note that the course number for Conduct of US Foreign Policy was PS225 prior to AY 2024-25, and changed to PS340 as of AY 2024-25. Students in this category may choose to take both PS209 and PS225/PS340. In qualifying circumstances where students take both courses, PS209 (Introduction to International Relations) will count as the introductory IR course and PS225/PS340 (Conduct of US Foreign Policy) will count as an upper-level IR elective.\n\nCourses"
