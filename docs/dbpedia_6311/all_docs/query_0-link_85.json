        "text": "Summary Of Wild Swans\n\n1454 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe book Wild Swans by Jung Chang takes place in the 20th century, in China. In this novel we are introduced to three-generations, Wild Swan, her mother, and her grandmother’s journey through an ever-changing China. Women in China at this time were considered weak, but as the war goes on, the reader gets a taste of each individual woman and what they were like, making the story even more interesting because today we have no clue what it was like to live in China during this war. In Wild Swans, there were two political parties in Jinzhou during 1945-1949. The two were the Kuomintang and the Communists. The KMT, which is the Chinese Nationalist Party, was run by military and political leader Chiang Kai-shek,\n\nAnalysis of the Movie, The Yellow Earth\n\n494 Words | 1 Pages\n\nIn a village left behind as the rest of the China is progressing, the fate of women remains in the hands of men. Old customs and traditions reign supreme, not because it is believed such ways of life are best, but rather because they have worked for many years despite harsh conditions. In response to Brother Gu’s suggestion of joining communist South China’s progress, Cuiqiao’s widower father put it best: “Farmer’s have their own rules.”\n\nAn Analysis Of The Movie 'Blue Kite'\n\n1215 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn many of the works we have read this year, there have been many critiques to the Chinese Communist ideals. These works solely critique the ideals of communism, and promote change in the way that it is implemented in life. The movie “Blue Kite,” tries to show what life was like under the communist government in China. By showing the people the true agony and suffering during the regime, they hoped to change the ideas of many people about communism. While the majority of scholars and students believe that “Blue Kite” is solely a critique of communistic ideals in China, I believe that it is a promotion of more progressive and democratic ideas shown through the Chinese government emphasis on little to no family life, and the visual and metaphorical\n\nWomen In China During The Long\n\n1260 Words | 3 Pages\n\nDuring the 18th Century women in China continued to be subordinated and subjected to men. Their status was maintained by laws, official policies, cultural traditions, as well as philosophical concepts. The Confucian ideology of 'Thrice Following'; identified to whom a women must show allegiance and loyalty as she progressed throughout her life-cycle: as a daughter she was to follow her father, as a wife she was to follow her husband, and as a widow she was to follow her sons. Moreover, in the Confucian perception of the distinction between inner and outer, women were consigned to the inner domestic realm and excluded from the outer realm of examinations, politics and public life. For the most part, this ideology determined the reality of a woman's live during China's 'long eighteenth century?'; This is especially true for upper class women.\n\nThe Kite Runner Analysis\n\n1707 Words | 4 Pages\n\nSince September 11, 2001, the Western world’s view of the Middle East, specifically countries like Iraq or Afghanistan, has shifted drastically. Whenever the media portrays the Middle East, they manage to spin a story negatively or violently. Due to these extrinsic influences, the youngest generation of Americans has never known an America that did not express at least some hatred toward certain parts of the Eastern world. Novels like The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini strive to encourage a healthy interest in Afghanistan and the Middle East while breaking the stereotypes that westerners have come to accept as fact about the culture and religion of Afghanistan. Hosseini manages to conjure a universal story line with relatable characters that introduce the world to the everyday people of postcolonial Afghanistan. On a grander scale, in The Kite Runner Khaled Hosseini utilizes his own life experiences alongside his firsthand account of the contemporary history of Afghanistan to craft a novel that breaks down these negative stereotypes and offers a significant contribution to Afghan American literature.\n\nGender Inequality in Traditional Chinese Culture\n\n1226 Words | 3 Pages\n\nWomen go from being controlled by their parents to their husband and then their sons. If she is unfortunate enough to lose her husband, then she should either stay celibate or kill herself. Sister Xianglin is a perfect example of how women in the traditional Chinese and Confucian culture are discriminated against and take advantage of. For example, Sister Xianglin was never referred to by her real name, because no one knew or cared enough to know Sister Xianglin’s real name, her husband had died and yet people still refer to her as his property (227). Sister Xianglin was an extremely hard worker. Although she was “more capable than a hardworking man”, and yet she was not considered an equal (227). Even though she had run away from her mother-in-law, Sister Xianglin was forced to return with her, because she was still her husband's property (227). She had no control over her life and yet would constantly be blamed and tormented for\n\nThe Patriarchal Nature of Confucian Philosophy\n\n2226 Words | 5 Pages\n\nAccording to Confucian philosophy, a family that is run well demonstrates that the state is also governed well. Confucianism philosophy was upheld, demonstrating a patriarchal society with a great emphasis on societal class and rigid gender lines, traditions and customs with a heavy emphasis on male heirs to continue the legacy of a family. Comparing Li Ang’s novel, The Butcher’s Wife and Zhang Yimou’s movie, Raise the Red Lantern, Confucian philosophy is clearly represented and shown and the leading female characters battle the oppression forced upon them due to their inability to support themselves. Because Confucian philosophy implies women and daughters are treated as objects instead of human beings, daughters are raised as objects to barter and are never given the chance to learn to gain independence. Without independence, women are forced to depend on their fathers and or their husbands without a choice in whatever matter. Men in a patriarchal society victimize women and oppression of women is largely affected by the socio-economic structure of a male-dominated society. Some say, in order for women to become liberated in a male dominated society, they must gain economic stability. In my opinion, due to the socio-economic settings of many of the works we have read, the female characters do not necessarily need the financial stability to receive their freedom; these women utilize their own mind and bodies to gain power and liberation. The oppression of women can be better explained using Jean-Paul Sartre’s theory of existentialism and Simone de Beauvoir’s existentialist feminism theory.\n\nThe Joy Luck Club\n\n1470 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe main characters in this story are a generation of mothers and their daughters. This story is told in sections as a narrative, where each chapter is recounted by a different woman. The mothers speak of their experiences growing up under the strict conditions in China. They told of how their marriages were predetermined and how they had to do as any male ordered. The daughters, on the other hand, being raised under American ways, told of their hardships with pressure given to them by their mothers. They spoke of American husbands, equality between both sexes, and how they’d rather believe that their futures could indeed be controlled.\n\nNo Name Women\n\n1007 Words | 3 Pages\n\nKingston uses the story of her aunt to show the gender roles in China. Women had to take and respect gender roles that they were given. Women roles they had to follow were getting married, obey men, be a mother, and provide food. Women had to get married. Kingston states, “When the family found a young man in the next village to be her husband…she would be the first wife, an advantage secure now” (623). This quote shows how women had to get married, which is a role women in China had to follow. Moreover, marriage is a very important step in women lives. The marriage of a couple in the village where Kingston’s aunt lived was very important because any thing an individual would do would affect the village and create social disorder. Men dominated women physically and mentally. In paragraph eighteen, “they both gav...\n\nMental and Physical Confinement of Women\n\n717 Words | 2 Pages\n\nIn the late 1800’s to the 1900’s women were not superior. Their spouses did not only govern them constantly, they were in complete care of their husbands. They could not make decisions; the men must tell the women how, when, why, and where to do something. If a husband says a woman must do something, she must listen. Like Louise from “The Story of an Hour” and the narrator from “The Yellow Wallpaper,” they, too, are cared for by their husbands and are inferior to their husbands or any other men. The only jobs they have are inside the home. The confinement in their homes leads them to be overly enjoyed when they are freed from their husband’s power.\n\nKingston's China Men\n\n431 Words | 1 Pages\n\nIs it because he was a woman that he cried out at the sight of a child being harmed? Did he not cry out at the death of his wife because she was a woman? The role of the female in this story reveals a sense of inferiority towards women. These questions that the story raises show how women were viewed as inferior and weak in the eyes of the Chinese culture.\n\nCommunism: How It Tried to Help Women\n\n2209 Words | 5 Pages\n\nConstitutional patriarchy instilled by the government in Central Europe greatly affected women during the time period following World War I. Communism attempted to give women more rights and promote their equality among men, but it failed to do so often. As a regime, patriarchy favored masculine gender roles throughout numerous aspects of society. Loves of a Blonde, Man is Not a Bird, Daisies, and A Woman Alone display the effect of patriarchy on women and how women could be successful or unsuccessful on attempting to go against it. The women in the films showed how women were pressured by society to accept relationships and a role in family, which were repressive. However, not all women conformed to the pressure and attempted to change their lives by taking different attitudes and actions toward the situation. By observing these films, a viewer can receive a viewpoint on how patriarchal society affected women and how women acted on their positions.\n\nThe Good Woman Of Setzuan Analysis\n\n1304 Words | 3 Pages\n\nShan Te has hard time saying no to whoever comes to her asking for help, but men like Yang Sun take advantage of her generosity and loving personality to exploit her. Despite all the good deeds shen Te does to Young Sun, He bravely tells Shui Ta that “Shen Te is a woman: she is devoid of common sense. I only need to lay hands on her and church bells ring.”(56). Yang Sun statement shows no respect to woman probable because of the way the society has been stereotyping women to be devoid to common sense. The same statement can mean that in that society, a women can not hold important government position that involves making laws and policies. Yang Sun believes women are predictable and easily manipulated. He says ‘because I lay my hands on her breasts’’ (56) to be enough justification to why Shen Te is devotional to him. He thinks women are just like a machines that need to be touched on buttons to execute function. It is very shocking for Shui Ta, Shen Te’s double self of to hear a man’s perspective on a woman position in her society through her"
