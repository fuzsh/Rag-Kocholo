        "text": "In 1733, Benjamin Franklin traveled from his home in Philadelphia back to his birthplace in Boston. Franklin was 27 years old. It was almost two decades before he attached a key to a kite, and more than three before he became America’s first postmaster general. Even in these early days, Franklin had an eye for innovation and that is what he encountered in Boston: The Boston Fire Society, one of the first colonial mutual aid organizations, which was set up to prevent the small house fires that typically led to destructive urban blazes.\n\nOn his return to Philadelphia, Franklin wrote a letter to The Pennsylvania Gazette using a pseudonym. In the letter, which he began by stating, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” Franklin suggested that locals follow in the footsteps of Bostonians. The next year, Franklin helped found the city’s Union Fire Company.\n\nThe adage has endured. Talk to government officials, and you’ll find that it’s a belief widely shared. In the fall of 2018, Social Finance, along with partners from the Public Health Institute and the Center for Health Care Strategies, did exactly that. With funding from Blue Shield of California Foundation, we set out to ask and answer a question that is at once simple and breathtakingly huge:\n\nWhat will it take to generate sustainable investments in strategies that promote health and well-being and end violence?\n\nTo wrap our arms around that question, we decided we needed a better understanding of the problem itself. If an ounce of prevention really is “worth a pound of cure,” why don’t we invest more in prevention? We decided to ask current policymakers what they thought.\n\nWhat we heard was honestly disheartening. People were frustrated; baffled by complexity, hamstrung by inertia. Challenges bled into and reinforced one another. In spite of all of it, we also saw kernels of hope. In every interview we conducted, public leaders suggested policy ideas that could help them navigate the challenges they described.\n\nWe hadn’t intended to write about either our pursuit of a clearer problem definition, or about policy solutions. But in the wake of these interviews, we’ve done both, broken into two pieces. The first, below, delves into the challenges to prevention that public officials described. The second, linked at the end of this piece, describes what governments and their philanthropic partners can do about it.\n\nThe forces that thwart prevention\n\nAt times it can seem as though the cards are stacked against prevention. If we haven’t been able to overcome the challenges that stymie prevention funding in the few hundred years since 1735, there must be good reasons.\n\nWe see four overarching issues most responsible for under-investment in prevention: uncertainty; a lack of accountability; reactivity; and, underneath these factors, wrong-pockets problems that, in the absence of greater collaboration, frustrate efforts to solve systemic, often dispersed problems.\n\nUncertainty: There is genuine ambiguity about which programs will achieve policy goals\n\nA central reason we don’t invest in prevention hides in plain sight: Many of the leaders we spoke with aren’t convinced that investments in prevention pay off.\n\nThe social sector is flooded with claims of dramatic cost effectiveness, of “proven” programs, of unambiguous success. It’s common practice for nonprofits to claim a social return of $10 or $20 for every $1 spent; anything less seems, by comparison, prosaic. But there is a large and growing body of research that suggests an unwelcome truth: Social interventions typically don’t achieve the results they set out to."
