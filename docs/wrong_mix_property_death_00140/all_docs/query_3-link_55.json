        "text": "Death Of John C. FrÃ©mont\n\nFrÃ©mont was born on January 21, 1813 in Savannah, Georgia. As a child, he was described as “precious, handsome, and daring.” After his father died, when he was just five years old, a family friend helped to pay for his education. FrÃ©mont attended Charleston College, but didn’t graduate despite his talent for math and natural sciences.\n\nFrÃ©mont married Jessie Benton, daughter of Senator Thomas Hart Benton, in 1841. Benton championed the expansionist movement known as Manifest Destiny. Benton and FrÃ©mont believed the entire North American continent should belong to the citizens of the US – that it was the nation’s destiny. Benton arranged for Congressional appropriations to fund expeditions to the Oregon Trail, the Great Basin, the Sierra Nevada Mountains and California. Using his influence, Benton also arranged for FrÃ©mont to lead each expedition."
