On the big screen he appeared in the swashbuckling classic \"The Three Musketeers,\" portraying the elegant musketeer Aramis, and played the same flamboyant character in the film's two sequels. Chamberlain continued to demonstrate his versatility with roles such as Prince Charming in the musical film \"The Slipper and the Rose\", and the Reverend Shannon in the Los Angeles and Broadway productions of Tennessee Williams' \"The Night of the Iguana.\" He also starred in yet another acclaimed remake for television, the title role of the classic, \"The Man in the Iron Mask.\" Chamberlain appeared as Henry Higgins in the 1993-94 Broadway hit \"My Fair Lady,\" which also toured throughout the U.S. He reprised this role in the European production of the show, visiting cities such as Paris, Berlin, Munich, Zurich and Hamburg.
