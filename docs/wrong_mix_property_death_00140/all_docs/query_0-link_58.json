Bruce's dad was President of the Flamingo Hotel. Bruce went to John C. Fremont and was in the seventh grade.\n\nBruce's mom and dad took him to see all the VEGAS superstars. Judy Garland! Bruce sat in the front row and met Judy backstage. The same with Frank Sinatra. Lena Horne. Ella Fitzgerald. Pearl Bailey. Liberace. Dean Martin. When Brenda Lee headliend at the Flamingo, Bruce was her date at her birthday party by the Flamingo pool! Bruce sat in the front row and Brenda sang \"Jambalaya\" to him!\n\nThe turning point in Bruce's life occurred at the Sands Hotel in 1956. Bruce sat in the front row to see SAMMY DAVIS JR and Bruce was literally knocked out by SAMMY's immense talent. Of course SAMMY concluded his show with his classic \"Mr Bojangles\" When Bruce met SAMMY backstage, Bruce shook his hand and said, \"Mr Davis. This was the greatest show that I have EVER seen. I now know. I WANT TO WORK IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.\"\n\nTo follow that dream, Bruce attended the legendary UCLA Film School and graduated with top awards. He immediately got a very prestigious job at MGM STUDIOS in 1972. Working in the historic Thalberg Building. The President of MGM invited Bruce into his office and said, \"Bruce how would you like to have lunch in the commissary with ELVIS PRESLEY\" We have a brand new film \"ELVIS on Tour\" We want you to handle the PUBLICITY!\"\n\nBruce met ELVIS for lunch and when he sat down he said, \"ELVIS we are going to get along great. We are both MAMA's BOYS\" Elvis flashed that unforgettable grin. After that Bruce worked with ELVIS throughout his career. On his films. Also at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. Bruce was in the showroom for over 300 of ELVIS' shows. Bruce's favorite part of the show was The TRILOGY. In Las Vegas, Bruce invited ELVIS horseback riding many times at the Twin Lakes Stables. Bruce and Elvis rode the golden palominos.\n\nWhen ELVIS sadly went to heaven, Colonel Parker hired Bruce Merrin Public Relatins for\nworldwide PR on ELVIS Wines, produced by Frontenac Vineyards. With Bruce's PR magic\".",
