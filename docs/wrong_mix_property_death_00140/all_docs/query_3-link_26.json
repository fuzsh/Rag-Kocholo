        "text": "Bordering San Benito and Monterey counties, Fremont Peak was the site where Captain John C. Fremont raised the U.S. flag in 1845 in defiance of the Mexican government.\n\nFor three days in March of 1845 Captain John Charles Fremont, who had been asked to leave Alta California by the Mexican authorities, looked down on San Juan Bautista and Commandante General Jose Castro’s growing force while the Mexican leaders looked up at an American flag that Fremont’s men had raised atop Gavilan (Fremont) Peak. During the night of March 9 the flag pole fell down. Fremont decided to treat this as an omen and left the mountain top before daylight.\n\nHe eventually worked his way slowly north through the Sacramento Valley to Oregon.\n\nCastro declared to the Mexican Minister of War that he had won the day, but made no effort to follow the Americans.\n\nFremont wrote to his wife that the Mexican officials had ordered him out of Mexico without any justification and that he had been greatly insulted in the process.\n\nU.S. Consul Thomas O. Larkin wrote to the Secretary of State that the Mexican authorities had not intended to attack Fremont on Gavilan Peak, but instead were posturing for the benefit of Mexico City."
