        "text": "TRUCKEE, Calif – Step into history with a compelling live portrayal by Steve Hale of Comstock Characters, who brings John C. Frémont’s (also known as “The Great Pathfinder”) adventures to life on Saturday, July 20, 2024, from 5 to 6:30 p.m. at Donner Memorial State Park. Discover how Frémont’s expeditions shaped the American West and learn about his pivotal role in American politics and military affairs.\n\nHe was a pioneering Western explorer, millionaire gold baron, premature emancipator, Major General of Union forces in the Civil War, California Senator, Governor of the Arizona Territory, and the United States’ first Republican Presidential candidate. Along with his wife Jessie, the Frémonts barreled through life blazing new trails and challenging the prevailing norms in 19th Century America.\n\n“This program is an excellent example of how partnerships can enrich community. We’ve teamed up with California State Parks and the Nevada County Library to expand our reach, connecting the community to the rich cultural and natural history of the area.” Doors open at 5 p.m. with the presentation starting promptly at 5:30 p.m. Admission is a suggested $5 donation, and light refreshments will be provided. Free parking is available after 5 p.m., and no registration is required."
