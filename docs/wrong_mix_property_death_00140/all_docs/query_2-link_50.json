Provenance : Heritage Auctions, November 23-24, 2013. Famed military explorer John C. Fremont was the first Republican candidate for President in 1856, after founding the Republican party in California and serving as Senator from that state. An avowed abolitionist, he ran on the slogan, \"Free Soil, Free Men and Fremont.\" He lost to the Democratic nominee James Buchanan when former President Millard Fillmore ran as a third-party spoiler representing the American (Know Nothing) Party. Hand-made campaign materials were quite common in the 19th century, though not many have survived to this day.",
