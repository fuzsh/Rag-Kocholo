Putnam's Sons publishers, New York; hardbound with blue boards and nice gilt lettering on spine; very good condition with unmarked pages and tight binding; dust jacket quite good condition as well; see pics. Description -\"Only rarely does a novel appear that captures the mighty sweep of real events and people with the emotional truth of fiction.  This is such a novel.  It is the story of John Charles Fremont, impetuous young explorer who blazed across the face of America like a shooting star, and Jessie, the spirited daughter of Thomas Hart Benton, the formidable senator from Missouri - that is the story told in Dream West.  Their fabled love embraced the stormiest and most adventurous half-century this country has ever known.  They were at the very heart of it.\" Film -Dream West was made into a 1986 miniseries that aired on the CBS network in the United States, starring Richard Chamberlain, and directed by Dick Lowry.  The seven-hour miniseries was broken into three parts (2 hours, 2 hours, and 3 hours). Part I aired on Sunday, April 13, 1986. It was the 16th most-watched show of that week. Part II had been intended to follow the next day, but was postponed a day until April 15 due to a press conference by President Ronald Reagan about Libya (see 1986 United States bombing of Libya). Part III was moved to Sunday, April 20. Part II was the 15th most watched television show for its week, and Part III came in 8th place. The film was based on the 1984 novel of the same name by David Nevin, based on the life of 19th century explorer and politician John C. Frémont.",
