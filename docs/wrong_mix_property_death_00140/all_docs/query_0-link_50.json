        "text": "Introduction\n\nVirtually every kind of climate, landform, vegetation, and animal life that can be found anywhere else in the United States can be found in California, the Golden State. The third largest state stretches for more than 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) along the Pacific Coast. It meets the sea with sandy beaches and rugged cliffs. Inland, past wooded coastal mountains, lie verdant valleys and arid deserts. Along the eastern border the towering Sierra Nevada thrusts jagged peaks far beyond the timberline. Among the mountains are the awesome forest habitats of some of the largest, the tallest, and the oldest living things on Earth.\n\nAbove the varied surface of the land, climates range from mountain to marine, and below the surface lie mineral resources in seldom-rivaled wealth. Early settlers were drawn by its minerals—most notably the gold discovered in the mid-1800s—and by the wealth of its forests, farmlands, and petroleum fields.\n\nWith the development of natural resources came a huge expansion in many kinds of manufacturing. In the early 20th century California gained worldwide fame as the center of American filmmaking, and by the 1960s it had become the heart of the television industry as well. California’s Silicon Valley is the hub of innovations in the country’s computer and consumer electronics industries. The state also developed large aerospace and biotechnology industries.\n\nFirst colonized by Spain, California became a state in 1850. Since then, the appeal of its varied riches has made it the most populous state in the Union. With this growth have come the ills of urbanization. California’s cities were scarred by the violence of the 1960s—rioting and student demonstrations and civil rights protests. Pollutants continue to threaten the quality of life as they contaminate the air and water. Expanding population centers have encroached steadily on the state’s natural beauty and strained the financial resources of its government.\n\nThe name California was used officially in Spanish documents as early as 1542. It is believed to have come from the description of a fabled island called California in a 16th-century Spanish novel, Las sergas de Esplandián (“The Adventures of Esplandián”), by Garci Ordóñez (or Rodríguez) de Montalvo. This origin of the name was determined by the historian Edward Everett Hale. The nickname Golden State comes from California’s golden poppies, the state flower, as well as the gold discovered in the state in 1848. Area 163,695 square miles (423,967 square kilometers). Population (2020) 39,538,223. (See also California in focus.)\n\nSurvey of the Golden State\n\nCalifornia lies in the Pacific Coast region of the western United States. To the north is Oregon, with a border of 215 miles (346 kilometers). The longest part of its eastern border, 610 miles (982 kilometers), is shared with Nevada. To the southeast the Colorado River separates California from Arizona. In the south the international boundary between California and Mexico stretches for 140 miles (225 kilometers). On the west California borders the Pacific Ocean for 840 miles (1,351 kilometers).\n\nThe state’s greatest length is the 780 miles (1,255 kilometers) down its center. The greatest width is 365 miles (587 kilometers)—from the coast of Santa Barbara county east to the Colorado River. The narrowest east-west distance is 150 miles (241 kilometers), near the Mexican border.\n\nAmong the states, California ranks third in area—only Alaska and Texas are larger. The largest county in the state—and in the 48 coterminous states—is San Bernardino county. With 20,105 square miles (52,072 square kilometers), it covers more territory than the states of Vermont and New Hampshire combined.\n\nNatural Regions\n\nThe surface of California is more varied than that of any other state. It ranges from mountains to valleys, from forests to farms, and from seacoast to desert. Within a hundred miles of each other are the lowest point in the United States and the highest point, not including the mountains in Alaska.\n\nIn California’s Death Valley the land drops to 282 feet (86 meters) below sea level. To the northwest, in the Sierra Nevada, Mount Whitney rises 14,494 feet (4,418 meters).\n\nMost of the land in California, including the entire western coast, is part of the Pacific Mountain System of the United States. Only the northeastern corner of the state as well as the east-central and southeastern portions are considered part of the Intermontane Plateaus. Within these two broad areas are 10 distinct natural regions. Six of these are in northern and central California, and four are in the south.\n\nKlamath Mountains\n\nCovering California’s northwestern corner and continuing into Oregon, this region has peaks and ridges 6,000 to 8,000 feet (1,800 to 2,400 meters) above sea level. The Klamath River winds through the mountains for about 150 miles (240 kilometers) before reaching the Pacific.\n\nCascade Mountains\n\nEast of the Klamaths is the southern extension of the Cascade Mountains—also known as the Cascade Range—which extend northward into Canada. The highest peak in the Cascades in California is Mount Shasta (14,162 feet; 4,317 meters), an impressive double-peaked dormant volcano. About 85 miles (135 kilometers) to the southeast is Lassen Peak (10,457 feet; 3,187 meters), which has erupted in the recent past.\n\nCoast Ranges\n\nAlso called the Pacific Coast Ranges, the Coast Ranges are a long system of highlands in the west. The average elevation of the ranges is about 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) above sea level, but some peaks and ridges rise to more than 6,600 feet (2,000 meters). On the west the Coast Ranges slope down to the Pacific Ocean; on the east, to the Central Valley. The only break in this highland chain is the Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay, through which the rivers of the Central Valley empty their waters into the Pacific.\n\nSierra Nevada\n\nThe Sierra Nevada is a great mountain wall 50 to 80 miles (80 to 130 kilometers) wide in the east-central part of the state. It begins near the North Fork of the Feather River and extends generally southeastward for about 400 miles (645 kilometers). At its southern end it curves westward to meet the Tehachapi Mountains, which link the Sierras with the Coast Ranges. Along the western face of the range is Yosemite Valley of the Merced River.\n\nCentral Valley\n\nAlso known as the Great Central Valley, the Central Valley is a flat, oval cradle between the Sierra Nevada on the east and the Coast Ranges on the west. It is about 450 miles (720 kilometers) long and averages 40 miles (65 kilometers) in width. The Sacramento River, rising in the Klamath Mountains, drains the upper valley. The San Joaquin, with headwaters in the southern Sierra Nevada, drains the lower valley. Both rivers flow into San Francisco Bay.\n\nGreat Basin\n\nThe Great Basin region appears along the eastern edge of California in two sections. It occupies the northeastern corner of the state and a section along the Nevada border, mainly in Mono and Inyo counties. Much of the northeastern section is made up of the Modoc Plateau, a barren highland with extensive lava beds. In the southeastern part of the Great Basin is Death Valley.\n\nTransverse Ranges\n\nExtending for about 300 miles (480 kilometers) across southern California, the Transverse Ranges stretch from the Pacific Coast north of Los Angeles in the west to the desert in the east. The Transverse Ranges include the San Bernardino, San Gabriel, Santa Ynez, Santa Monica, and Santa Susana mountains. Between the ranges are the valleys of San Fernando and Santa Clara in Ventura county.\n\nPeninsular Ranges\n\nThe Peninsular Ranges rise in the far southwest and extend into the Mexican peninsula of Lower (Baja) California. The chief Peninsular Ranges are the Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and Santa Rosa. In the north is the low basin that includes the city of Los Angeles.\n\nColorado Desert\n\nA low trough east of the Peninsular Ranges, the Colorado Desert has near its center the salty Salton Sea, which is below sea level. In the northwest is the Coachella Valley; to the south, the Imperial Valley. Both valleys are heavily irrigated to provide excellent cropland.\n\nMojave Desert\n\nOccupying the southeastern corner of the state, the Mojave Desert covers more than 25,000 square miles (65,000 square kilometers) in California and the three nearby states of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Between low, isolated mountain ranges are broad expanses of barren desert.\n\nClimate\n\nThe wide variations in California’s climate are a result of mountain ranges and differences in latitude, elevation, and distance from the coast. A marine climate of cool summers and mild winters extends along the coast and around San Francisco Bay. The coastal area south of Los Angeles has an unusually even, pleasant climate year-round. The Central Valley has a somewhat continental climate, with hot summers and mild to cool winters. Mountain climates, with cold winters and short summers, are found in all the state’s high ranges.\n\nIn general there are only two seasons, a rainy winter and a dry summer. Average annual precipitation varies from more than 170 inches (430 centimeters) in the northwest to about 2 inches (5 centimeters) a year in Death Valley. Southern California receives little or no snow, while Alpine county, in the Sierra Nevada, averages about 90 inches (230 centimeters) of snow a year. During the summer melted snow from the Sierras irrigates fields and orchards and provides drinking water and hydroelectric power.\n\nFogs are frequent along the California coast and in the Central Valley in the winter. The growing season varies from less than three months a year in the high Sierras to almost year-round in the coastal lowlands of the south.\n\nNatural Resources\n\nFew lands possess the great natural riches of the Golden State. With the help of irrigation, its favorable climate and fertile soils produce bountiful crops of almost every kind. An ample water supply makes possible the irrigation of millions of acres of farmland. Its rivers also provide huge amounts of hydroelectric power for homes and industry. The state’s deposits of petroleum and natural gas are another source of power.\n\nThe largest conservation program in the state is the Central Valley Project (CVP), authorized by the U.S. government in 1935. It provides water for irrigation of farmland, controls floods, furnishes hydroelectric power, and improves river navigation. The key facilities at the north end of the valley include Shasta Dam, on the Sacramento River, and Trinity Dam, on the Trinity River. Folsom Dam is on the American River east of Sacramento, and New Melones Dam is on the Stanislaus River. At the south end of the valley Friant Dam controls the San Joaquin River. Canals carry water throughout the valley. The CVP, overseen by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, has made the valley a rich agricultural region.\n\nAnother large federal project is the 80-mile (130-kilometer) All-American Canal, which irrigates the Imperial Valley. It taps the Colorado River at Imperial Dam, 300 miles (480 kilometers) below Hoover Dam. With its 123-mile (198-kilometer) branch to the Coachella Valley, the system carries water to more than 600,000 acres (240,000 hectares).\n\nThe O’Shaughnessy Dam, which forms the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir on the Tuolumne River, stores water for San Francisco, some 160 miles (260 kilometers) away. The Owens River, in the southern Sierras, is diverted to the Los Angeles Basin through more than 230 miles (370 kilometers) of aqueduct. Another system, the Colorado River Aqueduct, brings water from Lake Havasu, behind Parker Dam on the Colorado River, 242 miles (389 kilometers) to Lake Mathews in western Riverside county. From there pipelines and tunnels distribute the water to the cities of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.\n\nThrough a system of reservoirs and aqueducts, the California State Water Project transfers additional water to southern California from the San Joaquin–Sacramento River Delta in the north-central part of the state. The key unit in this project is the 444-mile (715-kilometer) California Aqueduct.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nCalifornia is the most biologically diverse state in the United States. It is home to more than 40,000 plant and animal species, some of which are endangered or threatened.\n\nNearly one-fourth of all plant types found in North America grow naturally in California. The state is particularly known for its redwood trees. Before European settlement the redwoods covered an estimated 2,000,000 acres (800,000 hectares) of California. Many redwood forests have been destroyed or greatly altered by logging operations. However, about 200,000 acres (80,000 hectares) of redwoods are protected in state and national parks. The giant sequoia, related to the redwood, grows only on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Other distinctive forms of native plant life are the bristlecone pine, the palm, the creosote bush, and the Monterey cypress.\n\nAnimal life in California is as varied as the land. About 400 species of mammals and some 600 species of birds have been found in the state at some point. Many are now extinct or endangered. The California grizzly bear is extinct, for instance, and the bighorn sheep is found mostly in remote desert mountains. Some species have been reintroduced or given protected status, including the California condor, whose population has slowly regrown with the help of zoo hatching programs and wilderness refuges. Wildcats and pumas (cougars) prowl remote mountain areas, though they are increasingly coming into contact with humans as urban development expands. More common animals include deer, bobcats, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, and black bears. Desert tortoises, horned toads, and rattlesnakes are abundant in the deserts. Among common birds are California jays and thrashers, juncos, mountain bluebirds, and hermit thrushes.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nAt the time of the 2020 U.S. census California led the country in population with more than 39 million residents. The state has experienced remarkable population growth ever since it was admitted to the Union. In 1850, the year of statehood, California had fewer than 100,000 people. By 1900 it had almost 1.5 million, making it the 21st state in population rank. In the 1960s California surpassed New York to become the most populous state in the country, a position it has held ever since.\n\nCalifornia ranks first among the states in the number of residents born outside the United States. More than one-fourth of its population consists of foreign-born residents. Mexicans account for the largest foreign-born group by far, followed by immigrants from China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), the Philippines, and Vietnam.\n\nBetween the 2010 and 2020 censuses Hispanics surpassed whites to become the largest ethnic group in California. In 2020 almost two-fifths of California’s residents identified themselves as Hispanic. Non-Hispanic whites made up just over one-third of the population, the lowest proportion for any state except Hawaii. Asian Americans accounted for 15 percent of California’s people and African Americans more than 5 percent. The state’s Native American population is the largest in the country. In 2020 more than 1.4 million California residents identified themselves as wholly or partly of Native American descent.\n\nCities\n\nCalifornia has more than 70 cities with populations of more than 100,000, including 3 of the 10 largest in the country. The heaviest concentration of population is in southern California, especially along the coast. The coastal city of Los Angeles is the largest in the state and the second largest in the country after New York City. Nearby Long Beach is a port and resort. Pasadena, famous for its Tournament of Roses, lies just northeast of Los Angeles. Anaheim and Santa Ana are major cities in Orange county, southeast of Los Angeles. San Diego, the southernmost coastal city, has a valuable harbor. It is the state’s second largest city.\n\nThe urban population of northern California centers on San Francisco Bay. San Jose, south of the bay, has grown largely on the strength of its high-technology industries. San Francisco is a cultural and financial center that stands at the entrance to the bay. On the east side of the bay are the cities of Oakland and Berkeley.\n\nCalifornia’s large inland cities include Sacramento, Fresno, and Bakersfield, all in the Central Valley. Sacramento, the state capital, is the chief city of the upper valley. Fresno and Bakersfield are the main cities of the San Joaquin Valley to the south.\n\nEducation\n\nUnder Spanish and Mexican rule there was little formal education in California. The first American school was opened at Mission Santa Clara in 1846. Four years later the city of San Francisco founded the first free public schools in the state. This city was also the site of the first public high school, opened in 1856.\n\nIn 1866 John Swett, superintendent of public instruction, succeeded in having the California legislature organize a statewide system of public education. The financing was by state and local taxes. High schools began to receive state support in 1903. In 1907 high school boards were authorized to offer postgraduate courses. Ten years later a law was enacted that recognized junior colleges as a part of California’s secondary-school system.\n\nThe University of California heads the state-supported institutions of higher learning. In addition to the parent campus at Berkeley, there are nine other campuses—at Davis, Irvine, San Diego, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, Merced, and Santa Cruz—and a law college at San Francisco. There are more than 20 campuses in the California State University system. California’s other schools of higher learning include Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Southern California, the University of San Francisco, and the Claremont Colleges.\n\nSports and Recreation\n\nCalifornia’s spectacular scenery and sunny climate make outdoor activities a popular draw. The state has more than a dozen national parks and monuments, including Yosemite, Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Redwood, and Lassen Volcanic national parks. California also has more than 20 million acres (8 million hectares) of national forests within its borders. State parks preserve seashores, mountains, waterfalls, canyons, and redwood groves.\n\nSacramento is the site of the annual state fair, which was first held in 1861. The Los Angeles County Fair and the National Orange Show at San Bernardino are among the largest local fairs. Palm Springs is a popular desert resort area; Santa Catalina, an island playground; and Disneyland, an amusement park in Anaheim, a favorite of families. Movie tours, tours featuring sightseeing of celebrity’s homes, and television studio broadcasts are among the tourist attractions of the Hollywood area.\n\nMountains provide many summer resorts and are also noted for winter sports. Squaw Valley, near Truckee, was the site of the Winter Olympic Games in 1960. The 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia has more professional sports teams than any other state. They include baseball’s Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, and San Francisco Giants. Basketball teams in the state include the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women’s National Basketball Association. California is also home to football’s San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Rams, and Los Angeles Chargers and ice hockey’s Los Angeles Kings, San Jose Sharks, and Anaheim Ducks. The LA Galaxy, Los Angeles FC, and San Jose Earthquakes are Major League Soccer teams.\n\nArts and Cultural Sites\n\nCalifornia writers have been prominent in all genres. Jack London is best known for his works about the human fight for survival among natural elements. Frank Norris and Upton Sinclair addressed social ills in their fiction, and John Steinbeck chronicled the lives of California migrant workers in a number of his writings. Some of California’s most famous poets, including Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gary Snyder, emerged from the San Francisco Beat movement. A number of writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Aldous Huxley, have been drawn to the film industry in Hollywood.\n\nHollywood, a district of Los Angeles, has been home to the American film industry since the early 1900s and the television industry since the 1960s. Pioneers of the movie industry found southern California very well suited to their needs—lots of sunshine, mild temperatures, varied landscapes, and a diverse labor market. Hollywood reached its glamorous height in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s. With the rise of television after World War II, some Hollywood movie studios turned over their famous lots to production for the small screen. Many stars, past and present, live in neighboring communities such as Beverly Hills and Bel Air.\n\nThe music industry, centered in Los Angeles, has also had a huge presence in California. West Coast Jazz gained prominence in the late 1940s. In the 1960s the Beach Boys established California’s first signature sound, celebrating the sun, surfing, and car culture of Los Angeles. Other successful popular music produced in southern California include the folk rock of the Byrds, the country rock of the Eagles, the punk of Black Flag, and the gangsta rap of N.W.A. and Tupac Shakur.\n\nCalifornia has a number of world-class art museums. In southern California these include the Getty Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Palm Springs Art Museum, the Huntington Library, the San Diego Museum of Art, and the Broad Museum. Art museums in the San Francisco Bay Area include the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the de Young Museum, the Legion of Honor, the San Jose Museum of Art, and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego are home to well-respected symphony orchestras as well as opera houses.\n\nFor brief biographies of some notable people of California, click here.\n\nEconomy\n\nCalifornia’s economic production ranks first among the states and exceeds that of all but a few countries. The state is dominant in manufacturing, agriculture, wine making, and the film and television industries. It ranks high in nonfuel mineral production and is among the leaders in petroleum production. California is also a top tourist destination.\n\nAgriculture and Fishing\n\nCalifornia leads all the states in cash income from agriculture. The chief agricultural region is the Central Valley, especially the southern part drained by the San Joaquin River. Valuable crops are also grown in the central coast valleys—Napa, Santa Clara, Salinas, Santa Maria, and Santa Ynez. Other important farm areas are in the south—the Los Angeles Basin and the Imperial and Coachella valleys.\n\nBecause of the high land values in southern California and the need for irrigation, most of the farms in that area are small and are intensively cultivated. Larger farms of 1,000 acres (400 hectares) or more are typical of the western Central Valley, where level fields are well suited to mechanized work. Much of the harvesting, however, is done by hand by low-paid migrant workers—many of whom cross the Mexican border without documentation. Large farms or ranches often maintain their own packing, freezing, and dehydrating plants. Most of the farmers market their crops through cooperative associations.\n\nCalifornia’s wide range of climate, surface, and soil permits the growing of almost every fruit, vegetable, nut, and cereal found in the temperate and tropical zones. The chief producing areas include the delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and the Salinas Valley, which is famous for its lettuce. California ranks among the top states in growing cotton, rice, sweet potatoes, sugar beets, and dry edible beans.\n\nThe great bulk of the country’s grapes, peaches, almonds, pears, apricots, and plums and prunes comes from orchards and vineyards located primarily in the Central Valley. The state is also a leader in the production of oranges, lemons, grapefruits, strawberries, cherries, apples, and olives. The Coachella and Imperial valleys feature subtropical fruits—avocados, figs, dates, and persimmons. Four-fifths of North American wines come from California’s vineyards.\n\nDairying flourishes throughout the state. In the 1990s California surpassed Wisconsin to become the country’s leading milk producer, and in the early 21st century it was second only to Wisconsin in cheese production. California also ranks among the leading states in the production of cattle and calves. Sheep are also raised.\n\nCalifornia’s commercial fishing industry depends largely on ocean fish. The most valuable species include squid, tuna, swordfish, salmon, crabs, mackerel, and sardines.\n\nIndustry\n\nFor the first few decades of the 20th century California led all states in petroleum production. The discovery of such fields as Huntington Beach and Signal Hill (Long Beach) in the 1920s boosted the industry’s stature. Many of the reserves were rapidly depleted, but petroleum continues to be the state’s most valuable mineral. The petroleum fields lie in three basins: the San Joaquin, the Los Angeles–Orange, and the Ventura–Santa Barbara. California also ranks among the country’s leading producers of natural gas.\n\nGold production has greatly declined in California, but the state still leads the country in total production of nonfuel minerals. California ranks among the top U.S. producers in construction sand and gravel. It also produces large quantities of cement, crushed stone, gypsum, boron minerals, and magnesium compounds.\n\nIn 1939 the value of manufacturing in California was a little more than a billion dollars a year. During World War II this figure was more than doubled. Since the end of the war it has increased steadily. Today California leads all states in the value of its manufacturing enterprises. About 10 percent of people in the state are employed in manufacturing.\n\nHigh-technology industries dominate manufacturing in California. The largest industry in the state is the production of computers and other electronics. This includes the manufacture of communications equipment, navigational and medical instruments, and semiconductors. In the 1970s and ’80s a large number of high-technology design and manufacturing firms began to operate in the Santa Clara Valley southwest of San Francisco, earning for the area the nickname Silicon Valley (after the major material used in semiconductor devices). Southern California is also a national leader in the production of aircraft, missiles, and space equipment.\n\nRelated to the state’s farm productivity, the processing of food is a major industry. The manufacture of nonelectrical machinery—including household devices and farm, construction, and mining equipment—is also significant.\n\nThe making of chemicals and allied products—for example, plastics, paints, and medicines—is important. In addition, California ranks among the leading states in the preparation of petroleum products.\n\nCalifornia is a fashion center and a leading state for apparel manufacturing. The Los Angeles area has been the world’s primary source of motion pictures since a few independent filmmakers rented studios there about 1907–08.\n\nServices\n\nServices make up the dominant economic sector in California. The sunny climate and varied scenery have made tourism a consistent source of income. More than one-fourth of the state’s land area is preserved as recreational areas, national seashores, or wildlife refuges. Along the Pacific Coast, about two-fifths of the shoreline is accessible and is visited by an estimated 50 million people each year. Theme parks, including Disneyland and SeaWorld, are also major tourist attractions.\n\nTransportation\n\nThe early roads leading into California were El Camino Real, the Southern Overland Mail Trail, and the Old Spanish Trail in the southern part of the state. The Overland Stage and the California Trail led to Sacramento in the center of the region, and the Overland Mail Trail went northward from there.\n\nThe first state highway, acquired in 1895, was the Lake Tahoe Wagon Road, a toll road from Placerville east to the Nevada line. Today California is served by one of the country’s most extensive networks of state and federal highways. Hundreds of miles of high-speed freeways have been built in urban areas. The roads are heavily traveled, and road congestion is an ongoing issue in urban areas.\n\nCalifornia was linked with the East by rail in 1869 when the Central Pacific, building eastward from Sacramento, met the Union Pacific in Utah. This was the country’s first transcontinental railroad. San Francisco and Los Angeles were connected by rail in 1876. Water traffic is heavy with both national and international shipping at the Pacific ports of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. There are international airports in these cities as well as in Oakland and San Jose.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe first sessions of the California legislature met in San Jose, Vallejo, Sacramento, and Benicia. Sacramento became the permanent capital in 1854. The state is governed under a constitution adopted in 1879. This document leans strongly toward popular control of government through use of the initiative, referendum, and recall, which were adopted in 1911.\n\nThe chief executive officer is the governor, who is elected for a four-year term. The legislature consists of the Senate and the Assembly. Heading the judiciary is the state Supreme Court. Earl Warren, a former governor, served as chief justice of the United States from 1953 to 1969. In 1992 former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, one of the first women to head a major city (1978–88), became the first woman U.S. senator from California. The first of several African Americans who have served California in the U.S. Congress was Augustus F. Hawkins, elected in 1962. The state’s first African American Congresswoman was Yvonne Braithewaite Burke, elected in 1972. Gay rights activists have also played an important role in San Francisco’s politics.\n\nCalifornia can claim three ex-presidents—all Republicans. Richard M. Nixon, born in Whittier, was elected president in 1968 while residing in New York; in 1972 he was reelected from his home state. Iowa-born Herbert Hoover and Ronald W. Reagan, an Illinois native and another former governor, were also elected from California.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Native American population of the California region may have been as high as 275,000 before the arrival of the Spanish. The many California Indian tribes coexisted more peacefully than those in other parts of North America and often traded with one another. In general they lived by hunting, fishing, and collecting wild plant foods, but tribes developed different means of subsistence as they adapted to varying food supplies. The Indians of California included the Pomo and Chumash of the coast, the Shastan of the northern mountains, the Yokuts of the Central Valley, and the Mojave of the southeastern desert.\n\nEuropean Exploration and Settlement\n\nThe exploration of California began in 1542 when Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo anchored his ship in San Diego Bay and claimed the land for Spain. In 1579 Sir Francis Drake sailed his ship the Golden Hind up the coast beyond San Francisco Bay and claimed the land for England.\n\nSpain’s claim to California was strengthened in 1602 by the merchant Sebastián Vizcaíno, who charted the coast. He gave many places their present names—San Diego, Santa Catalina, Santa Barbara, Monterey, and Carmel. Until the late 1700s Upper (Alta) California lay isolated behind its mountains and deserts. Then Spain began to send parties of colonists northward from Mexico to establish its claim to all of the Southwest and to block America’s expansion westward. At the same time, the Russians were threatening to push south from Alaska. The pioneers who carried out the Spanish plan were Gaspar de Portolá, a resourceful soldier, and Father Junípero Serra, a Franciscan monk. In July 1769 Portolá founded a military post and Serra dedicated the first mission at the present site of San Diego.\n\nDuring the next half-century 20 more missions were established up the coast along a road called El Camino Real—each a day’s journey from the next. The last to be built, and the one farthest north, was San Francisco Solano at Sonoma in 1823. The chain of missions became the backbone of the social, agricultural, and industrial life of Spanish California. Pueblos grew up around them, and large ranches with herds of cattle and sheep were staked out nearby. The ranches were owned by Spanish families who also enjoyed political control of the region. This elite Spanish population living in California came to be known as the Californios.\n\nMuch of the work on the ranches and in the missions was done by Native Americans whom the Spaniards had converted to Christianity. Thousands of Native Americans died from diseases carried by the Europeans because they had no immunity against them.\n\nFrom Mexican to American Rule\n\nCalifornia remained under Spanish control until 1821, when Mexico won its independence from Spain. Under the new Mexican government, the Californios retained much of their power and influence. In a process called secularization, the government seized the mission lands and divided them up among political favorites. The Native Americans continued to be treated as slaves. During this time the American influence in California increased steadily. Yankee sea captains were stopping at coastal harbors to trade. Inland, Jedediah Smith and Joseph Walker blazed trails from the East for fur traders and trappers.\n\nYears earlier, in 1812, the Russians had built Fort Ross near the Russian River north of San Francisco. They used the fort as a base for hunting sea otters, whose pelts were prized. In 1841 the Russians sold the fort to a resourceful American pioneer, Captain John A. Sutter. At this time Sutter ruled like a feudal lord over 97,000 acres (39,000 hectares) of land in the Sacramento Valley. Many Americans rested there after the difficult journey overland into California. In 1847 Sutter’s guides helped to rescue 45 survivors of the original 87 members of the Donner party, which was trapped in the snows of the Sierra Nevada.\n\nMuch of the work of separating California from Mexico was done by John C. Frémont. In 1845 Frémont led his second military expedition to the Pacific Coast, and the next year American settlers at Sonoma revolted against Mexican rule. They raised the Bear Flag as the banner of the California Republic and joined the U.S. war against Mexico. An invading army under General Stephen Watts Kearny helped win control of California. By the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican-American War in 1848, Mexico ceded California and the rest of the American Southwest to the United States. California became the 31st state as part of the Compromise of 1850.\n\nStatehood\n\nEven before California became a state, its rapid growth was assured. On January 24, 1848, James Wilson Marshall found gold at Sutter’s sawmill along the American River near Coloma. This started the famous California Gold Rush. Americans swarmed to the coast overland by prairie schooner, around South America’s Cape Horn by ship, and by way of the Isthmus of Panama.\n\nSan Francisco’s population soared from 800 in 1848 to 25,000 in 1850. Stores, saloons, dance halls, and gambling dens sprang up overnight to serve the thousands of miners from the goldfields. Other newcomers turned to homesteading and settled as squatters on former Spanish and Mexican ranches.\n\nThe opening of the first transcontinental railroad encouraged immigration on a still larger scale after 1869. There was a depression in the 1870s, but people continued to pour into the state. Much of the population increase was due to the development of irrigated farming. The first trainload of oranges was shipped from Los Angeles to eastern markets in 1886.\n\nThe immigrants who came to California during this time included many Asians, especially from China and Japan. Most of the Chinese worked for low wages in menial jobs, leading to complaints that they were taking jobs away from Americans. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which suspended Chinese immigration, was one of several discriminatory measures against the Chinese. Japanese farmworkers were encouraged to emigrate to replace the Chinese, but they became a target of discrimination as well. In 1913 the Webb Alien Land Law was passed with the aim of keeping the Japanese from owning land. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japanese Americans in California were forced from their homes and held under guard in detention centers until the end of World War II (see Japanese American internment).\n\nMeanwhile, California’s economy and population advanced. The tide of immigration first moved toward southern California about 1900, spurred by citrus, oil, and some wariness of San Francisco after a disastrous earthquake and fire in 1906. The 1930s brought a flood of homeless farm families to California from the Dust Bowl of the Great Plains. During World War II many people came to the state to work in the defense industries, and they often remained as residents. By the 1970s people began moving in greater numbers from the crowded cities to rural areas and to cities of the mountain states. New urban centers emerged in California, and smaller cities experienced the most rapid rate of growth.\n\nCalifornia in the 21st Century\n\nIn the late 1990s a short-lived boom in Internet-based businesses accelerated growth in Silicon Valley. The bursting of the so-called “Internet bubble” in the first years of 21st century was soon followed by another blow—a nationwide economic crisis that began in 2008. During this period California struggled with a staggering budget deficit, steep declines in home values, and one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. The Great Recession worsened the state’s already massive budget deficit. Bolstered by federal relief measures, the state government took steps to relieve the budget crisis, such as raising income taxes for wealthy residents. The government also began putting more money into reserves in an effort to protect California against future recessions.\n\nCalifornia was one of the states hit hardest during the global coronavirus pandemic that began in early 2020. By May 2022 California had recorded more than 9.5 million cases of the illness known as COVID-19 and more than 90,000 deaths. (See also Pacific Coast; United States, “South Pacific Region.”)\n\nSome Notable People of California\n\nCesar Chavez (1927–93)\n\nAmerican labor leader Cesar Chavez helped improve the lives of migrant workers on American farms. As a child Chavez and his family worked as migrant farmworkers in California. In 1962 he and Dolores Huerta founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), a farm labor union. Chavez and the union launched successful strikes against grape growers and other agribusinesses. The strikes resulted in a higher minimum wage and more benefits for migrant workers. Chavez continued to fight for farmworkers through interviews, hunger strikes, and boycotts. (See also Cesar Chavez.)\n\nWalt Disney (1901–66)\n\nAn animation pioneer, Walt Disney created some of the most successful animated films and world-famous cartoon characters. Disney moved to Hollywood in 1923 and released Steamboat Willie, starring Mickey Mouse, in 1928. The next year he formed Walt Disney Productions. This company created such films as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Peter Pan (1953), and Mary Poppins (1964). In 1955 Disney opened Disneyland, a themed amusement park, in Anaheim, California. (See also Walt Disney.)\n\nDianne Feinstein (born 1933)\n\nAmerican politician Dianne Feinstein was the first woman to serve as a U.S. senator from California. She grew up in San Francisco and began her political career there in 1969. Feinstein was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992. As senator, she drafted the California Desert Protection Act, which protected more than 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of land. Feinstein served on several Senate committees. In 2007 she became the first woman to serve as chair of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. (See also Dianne Feinstein.)\n\nDorothea Lange (1895–1965)\n\nThe work of American photographer Dorothea Lange was greatly influential on journalistic photography. Lange studied photography in New York City before opening a portrait studio in San Francisco in 1916. During the Great Depression Lange photographed unemployed men wandering the streets of San Francisco. She also took photos of California’s migrant workers and even lived with them for a time. Her work led to the establishment of camps for migrants. A few years later Lange recorded the mass evacuation of Japanese Americans in California to internment camps. (See also Dorothea Lange.)\n\nJohn Muir (1838–1914)\n\nNaturalist John Muir dedicated his life to the preservation of nature. He was largely responsible for the establishment of California’s Sequoia and Yosemite national parks. Muir made his way to California in 1868 and headed to Yosemite Valley, where he lived for six years. Muir’s writings on nature and conservation helped convince U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to establish a large-scale conservation program. The program set aside 148 million acres (60 million hectares) of national forests, declared Muir Woods in California as a national monument, and doubled the number of national parks. (See also John Muir.)\n\nEllen Ochoa (born 1958)\n\nAmerican astronaut, scientist, and inventor Ellen Ochoa was the first Hispanic female astronaut. She was born and raised in southern California and attended Stanford University. Before becoming an astronaut, Ochoa developed optical systems and designed computer systems. In 1990 she gained admission to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s astronaut program. She flew on her first mission in 1993 and by 2002 had flown on four shuttle flights. In 2013 Ochoa became the first woman and the first Hispanic to be named director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. She later served as chair of the National Science Board, which runs the National Science Foundation. (See also Ellen Ochoa.)\n\nJohn Steinbeck (1902–68)\n\nAmerican novelist John Steinbeck chronicled life in early 20th-century California, which earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. Steinbeck spent most of his life in Monterey county, California. One of his first publications was the novella Of Mice and Men (1937), a tragic story about two migrant workers. The Grapes of Wrath (1939) is a novel about the migration of a family from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl to California and the hopelessness of the Great Depression era. (See also John Steinbeck.)\n\nTiger Woods (born 1975)\n\nAmerican golfer Tiger Woods dominated his sport in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Woods was born and attended school in California. In 1996 he left Stanford University after two years to join the professional golf circuit. In 1997 he became the first golfer of African American or Asian descent to win the Masters Tournament, one of the most prestigious competitions. Woods went on to win many more tournaments, including the 2001, 2002, 2005, and 2019 Masters. (See also Tiger Woods.)"
