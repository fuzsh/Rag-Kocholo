They had been instructed to flee Babylon. They departed for California the same day other Saints left Navoo, Illinois, following clashes with settlers over polygamy. The party from Navoo was to meet Sam Brannans group at Yerba Buena. March 13, 1846\n\nCol. Castro issued a proclamation that declared John Frémont and his party to be a band of highwaymen.

Commodore Sloat had been instructed, upon hearing of any war with Mexico, to establish American authority in California. June 14, 1846\n\nJohn Frémont launched the Bear Flag Revolution, and established the California Republic. William. B. Ide served as President of the Republic of California until July 9. Governor Vallejo was also taken prisoner during the skirmish and was moved to Sutters Fort. Bear flag raised at Sonoma. June 15, 1846\n\nU.S. Treaty with Great Britian set the Oregon boundary at the 49th parallel. Expansionists in Congress disagreed, and used the slogan 54-40 or Fight. June 24, 1846\n\nCol. Castros forces from Monterey, under the command of Joaquín de la Torre, fought the Battle of Olompali north of San Rafael with Frémonts troops from Sonoma. Two Americans and five or six Californios were killed. July 1, 1846\n\nJohn Frémont crossed to the Presidio with his Republic of California forces and spiked 10 Spanish guns. He also gave the name Chrysoplylae or Golden Gate to the entrance of the Bay.
