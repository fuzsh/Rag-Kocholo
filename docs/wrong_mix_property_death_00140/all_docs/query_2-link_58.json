First edition. \"This company publication includes the terms of a lease from John C. Fremont, a letter from him to the company dated November 10, 1851, and a report of the enterprise's condition and prospects\" (Kurutz). The articles stipulate that \"the subscribers hereto, having acquired a lease of Six Hundred feet square of land, granted by John Charles Fremont, upon which there is a large quartz vein of gold, situate upon the river Mariposas. and which is deemed to be of great value--the title to which property the subscribers have conveyed to the Trustees of this Company, in trust for the stockholders--offer an opportunity to others to participate in the advantages and profits of said property.\" In October 1848 Frémont had set out on his ill-fated fourth expedition, \"partially financed by St. Louis businessmen eager to locate a central, all-weather railroad route through the Rockies. During the unusually severe winter, the expedition lost its way in the rugged mountains of southern Colorado, and ten men, a third of the expedition, perished in the snow. While Frémont and several reliable men in his party blamed the guide, William S. 'Old Bill' Williams, other members blamed Frémont himself. Despite the tragedy, Frémont pushed on to California, where gold had been discovered at Las Mariposas, a seventy-square-mile tract near Yosemite Valley that he had purchased sight unseen in 1847 for $3,000. Las Mariposas made Frémont rich, but he was not a shrewd businessman.

An outstanding report and Fremont's greatest work. It records Fremont's first two expeditions. \"The first expedition consisted of 25 men, with Kit Carson as a guide. They went a little beyond South Pass. The second expedition, consisting of about 40 men, was guided by Thomas Fitzpatrick (joined by Kit Carson en route) and reached the Columbia River and Fort Vancouver. The expedition then looped back to California by a spectacular winter crossing of the Sierra Nevada and returned to St. Louis via the San Joaquin Valley, Tehachapi Pass, and the Great Salt Lake.\"--The Pacific Northwest. The great Fremont (Preuss) unusually nice condition with a few minor splits at folds, else fine. Of this map Carl Wheat said, \"The great folding map is an altogether memorable document in the cartographic history of the west, and for it alone Fremont would deserve to be remembered in history.\" The report is comprised of a well-written and interesting narrative of each expedition, combined with much detailed scientific data, skillfully-produced maps, and attractive lithographic plates by E. Weber & Co.-Baltimore. This report, as well as the expeditions themselves, received much promotion and exposure from Fremont's father-in-law, Sen. Thomas Hart Benton. The report guided Oregon emigrants and California gold seekers, and firmly established Fremont's reputation. Occasional minor foxing, else near fine! An exceptionally nice, clean, tight copy of this important work, which is usually encountered rebound, heavily foxed & worn, and/or without map. The important large folding map shows minor wear, an old water stain to lower corner of some pages, lightly foxed, else a very good copy.\n\nFREMONT, John C.

The Senate issue of the Fremont report, certainly one of the most important single pieces of Western Americana. In various editions, this report was more widely read than any other account of the West before the gold rush, and the text and map had a profound effect on the routes frequented during the great period of emigration. The maps include the huge folding \"Map of.Oregon & North California in the Years 1843-44,\" with many lakes and rivers traced in color. Fremont also made substantive contributions as a naturalist, mainly through the work of John Torrey, who accompanied the expedition.\n\n4to., (9 ¼ x 6 ¼ inches).

The famous explorer, John C. Fremont, spent much of his time in the 1850s attempting to develop a giant land grant in California, the Mariposa Estate, an effort which involved him in much litigation and was ultimately a financial catastrophe. \"Fremont has sailed to London in January, 1861, to raise money 'to consolidate the debts incurred [by the estate] in the litigation of its title.and to increase its productive power.' Fremont claimed the property 'is now producing from $60,000 to $100,000 per month, half of which, at least, is profit.' The money was not raised and Fremont never afterwards set foot on the property\" - Streeter. The Streeter copy sold to Dawson's Book Shop for $100 in 1968. STREETER SALE 2865.

The copyright and publishing information is printed directly beneath the portrait on the thin paper, while the caption of \"John C. Fremont/ Republican Candidate for the Presidency\" is printed in typescript further down on the backing. Some fading and rubbing of margins, obscuring the name of the photographer [S. Root]. Light margin toning, image clean and crisp. Good+. This is one of the earliest campaign portraits of the first Republican presidential candidate, John C. Fremont, nominated on June 18, 1856. Within several weeks after the nomination, several Fremont portraits were advertised in the New York Tribune. On July 8th Root's print was advertised as the \"Only Authentic Portrait of John C. Fremont, Republican Candidate for the Presidency. lithographed in the highest style of the art by C.G. Crehen after Root's magnificent photograph.\" By August 7 our portrait of Crehen's lithograph, printed by Schaus, was advertised in the Alton Weekly Telegraph. Charles G. Crehen [1829-1891], born in Paris, immigrated to the United States in 1848 and settled in New York. A portrait painter, lithographer, and printer, he is best known for his portraits of public figures such as John C. Fremont, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, Millard Fillmore, and Lafayette.

General Fremont authorizes Major [Simon] Stevens to procure for him a gun shipment of 113 Cases of Rifles -- while they simultaneously participate in the \"Hall Carbine Affair.\" This endorsement was written on the back of a two page handwritten letter from H. Livingstock & Co., Importers and Custom Agents, New York City, August 21, 1861, who notify Fremont, in part: \".Mr. Henry Steven's goes to France, and shall ship to you from there by the Steamer Brewer 113 Cases of Rifles, if not by this vessel he will do so by the next one from Southampton -- the goods to be consigned to Wells, Fargo & Co.In relation to the Rifles, it will be necessary to have an order from the Secretary of the Treasury, to land these free of duty if they are intended for the Government, we do not know how these Cases will be marked -- but the Department can order such are as for yourself to be landed free.\" Docketed by Gustavus Koerner: Will Major Stevens procure from Washington the necessary permit and find the things right forward - from - Headquarters -- Western Dept -- St. Louis -- August 27, 1861. Endorsed: J.C. Fremont -- Major Genl. Commanding. Note: at the very moment he authorized this gun purchase, Fremont and Stevens were participants involved in the \"Hall Carbine Affair\" whereby J.P. Morgan financed the purchase of 5000 surplus rifles at $3.50, which were resold back to the government for $22 each. Stevens was the broker who handled this transaction and Fremont was the purchaser! And there's an interesting twist to the story: though referred to as \"Major Stevens,\" Simon Stevens never served in the military. He was appointed to this post on Fremont's staff as a Civilian Forwarding Agent in New York, looking after the Generals' purchases in Europe and the East. Weakness and small tears at the folds; two corners chipped. Very good(-) condition. American military officer, explorer, and first candidate of the Republican Party for the office of President of the United States.\n\nHardcover. Senate Issue. 691pp. Octavo [23 cm] Rebound in sturdy tan cloth. New endsheets and flyleaves. Good plus. The plates and pages are foxed, and there are sporadic tidemarks of varying sizes on the pages as well. 22 single-sided plates (views, botanical, fossils) and 3 maps (missing the large folding map by Charles Preuss, and the map at p. 247). John Fremont's expeditions of 1842 and 1843-44 were the most spectacular reconnaissance of the American West since Lewis and Clark. Performed under the auspices of the Army Bureau of Topographical Engineers, the expedition's published reports and maps brought a factor of dependability and trustworthiness that would aid American settlement of the West. Fremont's report was the most detailed observations of the western territories at the time. The country covered by the report was previously terra incognito--Brigham Young is said to have used both the report as a guide in bringing the Mormon people West. Utah was then part of Mexico and would first become Deseret and then Utah territory. One of the seminal works for any western or Utah collector. Howes F-372(Senate Issue).

Fremont's first expedition to the Rockies was designed by his father-in-law, Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, to publicize the overland route to Oregon. Dale Morgan found the manuscript of the report in the War Department records of the National Archives. Although unable to locate any of Fremont's manuscript journals, Morgan found the financial records of the 1842-45 expeditions in the old files of the General Accounting Office.\" The letter of transmittal preceding the title page has the following title: \"27th Congress, 3d Session. [Senate.] [243] Report from the Secretary of War, Communicating, in compliance with a resolution of the Senate, a copy of Lieut. Fremont's report of his Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains. March 2, 1843. Read, and ordered to be printed. March 3, 1843. Ordered, That nine hundred additional copies be furnished for the use of the Senate, and one hundred copies for the use of the Topographical Bureau.\" Within the letter of transmittal, J. J. Abert, Colonel Corps of Topographical Engineers, writes, \"I have the honor to transmit the report and map of an exploring expedition to the Rocky Mountains, made during the last summer, under the orders of the Department, by Lieut. J. C. Fremont, of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, and which was called for by a resolution of the Senate of the 21st of last December. Although so much time has elapsed since the calling for the report, allow me to say that it was not owing to any want of industry on the part of Lieut. Fremont, but to the great amount of matter which had to be introduced in the report, and the many calculations which had to be made of the astronomical and barometrical observations. The necessary labor on these accounts has delayed the completion of the report until to-day.\" Secretary of War named as J. C. Spencer.\n\nSoft cover. Condition: Good.

A compilation of two reports by John C. Fremont (1813-1890) and William H. Emory (1811-1887). The pamphlet begins with Fremont's writings, then continues with Emory's narrative. Fremont was an American explorer, politician, and the first Republican presidential nominee. Emory was an American surveyor and civil engineer who worked for the United States Army Corp of Topographical Engineers.\n\nDisbound. Condition: Fine. First Edition. Complete, original disbound issue of Harper's Weekly published just prior to the Republican Convention in Chicago on May 16th that, of course, nominated Abraham Lincoln for his first term as President. The centerfold illustration (approx. 16\" x 22\") pictures the eleven candidates from photographs by Matthew Brady. This illustration is followed by brief biographies of ten of the eleven candidates (a biography of Cassius M. Clay is not included). Also included in this issue is a full-page panoramic view of Chicago. This copy is in near fine condition with some brief foxing. a short (2\") closed tear on the front panel, and minor edgewear.

Howes F372; Wagner-Camp 115:2; Graff 1436; Field 565; Hill 641. Feel free to inquire. Please see scans of the book you will receive. Note: the large map published in 1845 was the road map people used in the gold rush of 1849. It was routinely extracted hence its rare nature. Map is 52 x 32 inches. Furthermore, I do not believe map was issued with all House editions which contributes even more to its scarcity. Map is sufficiently large that if it had ever been present there would be evidence of removal. No evidence it was ever in this volume. [Amerind].\n\nunbound. 3 pages (front and back), each measuring 9.75 x 7.75 inches, Washington, D.C., October 30, 1847. This unknown \"insider\" provides the latest information concerning General Fremont's upcoming Court Martial trial for the crimes of Mutiny and Disobedience, in small part: \".The trial of Col. Fremont commences at the Arsenal in this city, instead of Fort Monroe at Old Point as advertised, on the 2nd - next Friday. He is charged, as you know with Disobedience of the orders of General Kearny, his superior officer in California. The general opinion seems to be that the result of the Court Martial will be a perfect 'whitewash' of the Col. Whatever may be the merits of the case; Col. F. is undoubtedly a meritorious officer and has done the state large service. If left to himself, he would become a great man. That his connection with Col. Benton will use him up if he allows it to continue. The Department is all very actively preparing for the Session of Congress. The President (Polk) has recovered his health and is said to be preparing his message.\" Note: Col. Benton is Thomas H. Benton, the powerful United States Senator from Missouri and John C. Fremont's father-in-law. Ironically, he was allowed to represent his son-in-law in this Court Martial proceeding even though he was a civilian attorney. Nevertheless, Fremont was initially convicted of all charges until commuted by President Polk. Natural folds but still in fine condition."
