Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to set up Allied occupation headquarters.\n\nOn this date\n\n1861: Union Gen. John C. Fremont instituted martial law in Missouri and declared slaves there to be free. (However, Fremont’s emancipation order was countermanded by President Abraham Lincoln).\n\n1862: Confederate forces won victories against the Union at the Second Battle of Bull Run in Manassas, Virginia, and the Battle of Richmond in Kentucky.\n\n1905: Ty Cobb made his major-league debut as a player for the Detroit Tigers, hitting a double in his first at-bat in a game against the New York Highlanders. (The Tigers won, 5-3.)\n\n1935: The film “Anna Karenina,” MGM’s version of the Tolstoy novel starring Greta Garbo, opened in New York.\n\n1954: President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which was intended to promote private development of nuclear energy.\n\n1967: The Senate confirmed the appointment of Thurgood Marshall as the first black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n1983: Guion S. Bluford Jr. became the first black American astronaut to travel in space as he blasted off aboard the Challenger.\n\n2005: A day after Hurricane Katrina hit, floods were covering 80 percent of New Orleans, looting continued to spread and rescuers in helicopters and boats picked up hundreds of stranded people.\n\n2010: Seven-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens pleaded not guilty in Washington to charges of lying to Congress about whether he’d used steroids or human growth hormone. (Clemens went on trial in July 2011; however, the case abruptly ended in a mistrial. He was acquitted in a retrial.)\n\n2014: The U.S. military said fighter aircraft and unmanned drones had struck Islamic State militants near Iraq’s Mosul Dam. Under cover of darkness, 40 Filipino peacekeepers escaped their besieged outpost in the Golan Heights after a seven-hour gunbattle with Syrian rebels.
