        "text": "Today is Sunday, August 30, the 242nd day of 2015. There are 123 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn August 30, 1945, U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to set up Allied occupation headquarters.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1861, Union Gen. John C. Fremont instituted martial law in Missouri and declared slaves there to be free. (However, Fremont’s emancipation order was countermanded by President Abraham Lincoln).\n\nIn 1862, Confederate forces won victories against the Union at the Second Battle of Bull Run in Manassas, Virginia, and the Battle of Richmond in Kentucky.\n\nIn 1905, Ty Cobb made his major-league debut as a player for the Detroit Tigers, hitting a double in his first at-bat in a game against the New York Highlanders.

Bluford Jr. became the first black American astronaut to travel in space as he blasted off aboard the Challenger.\n\nIn 1984, the space shuttle Discovery was launched on its inaugural flight.\n\nIn 1986, Soviet authorities arrested Nicholas Daniloff, a correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, as a spy a week after American officials arrested Gennadiy Zakharov, a Soviet employee of the United Nations, on espionage charges in New York. (Both men were later released.)\n\nIn 1989, a federal jury in New York found “hotel queen” Leona Helmsley guilty of income tax evasion, but acquitted her of extortion. (Helmsley ended up serving 18 months behind bars, a month at a halfway house and two months under house arrest.)\n\nIn 1991, Azerbaijan declared its independence, joining the stampede of republics seeking to secede from the Soviet Union.\n\nTen years ago: A day after Hurricane Katrina hit, floods were covering 80 percent of New Orleans, looting continued to spread and rescuers in helicopters and boats picked up hundreds of stranded people.\n\nFive years ago: Vice President Joe Biden flew into Baghdad, where he sought to reassure Iraq that America was not abandoning it as the U.S. military stepped back. An enormous drill began preliminary work on carving a half-mile chimney through solid rock to free 33 men trapped in a Chilean mine. Texas-born fugitive Edgar Valdez Villarreal, a suspected drug lord known as “the Barbie,” was arrested in Mexico State. Seven-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens pleaded not guilty in Washington to charges of lying to Congress about whether he’d used steroids or human growth hormone. (Clemens went on trial in July 2011; however, the case abruptly ended in a mistrial. He was acquitted in a retrial.)\n\nOne year ago: The U.S. military said fighter aircraft and unmanned drones had struck Islamic State militants near Iraq’s Mosul Dam. Under cover of darkness, 40 Filipino peacekeepers escaped their besieged outpost in the Golan Heights after a seven-hour gunbattle with Syrian rebels. The St. Louis Rams cut Michael Sam, the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Actor Bill Daily is 88. Actress Elizabeth Ashley is 76. Actor Ben Jones is 74. Cartoonist R.
