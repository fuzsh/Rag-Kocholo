        "text": "Little-known Fremont Peak lies just west-of-center in the Diablo Range and climbs a modest 3,171 feet from the nearby Monterey Bay. This hidden gem offers a vantage point that’s as rich in early Californian history and unique geology as it is in breathtaking views.\n\nThe mountain bears a name borne from controversy.\n\nAnd though the state park is modest in size at just 159 acres, it offers an immense treasure trove of natural beauty, geological wonders, and cultural significance waiting to be explored by those willing to venture to its slopes.\n\nCaptain John C. Fremont\n\nAs the story goes, American Captain John C. Fremont—often regarded as the “Pathfinder of the West” for his explorations of the American West in the 19th century—camped on the peak in 1846 during a survey of the Salinas area, then still part of Mexico’s Alta California.\n\nHe took refuge on Gavilan Peak, as it was then called, after an altercation with General Jose Castro, commandant at the Monterey Presidio, who had ordered Fremont to leave California. “Gavilán” is the Spanish word for “hawk.”\n\nIn defiance, Fremont built a log stockade and raised a US flag at the top of the peak that now bears his name. Shortly thereafter, however, he and his troops departed in the middle of the night to avoid a confrontation with Mexican troops.\n\nThis conflict obviously didn’t help tensions leading up to the Mexican-American War. Fremont’s defiance and his role in the events of the time would later make him a prominent figure in the history of westward expansion in the United States.\n\nAfter the expedition retreated, it’s said that word was going around about plans for a potential attack brewing by some Native Americans against white settlers.\n\nFremont would soon after order the attack sparking the Sacramento River Massacre, and is responsible for what is thought to be several hundred Native American deaths from that incident alone.\n\nThis is just a small portion of Fremont Peak’s extensive history, but more can be found in the state park brochure. Survey markers are still present and embedded in the marble peak.\n\nFremont Peak’s Sense of Place\n\nAlthough it’s not the highest point in San Benito County, Fremont Peak might have some of its best views. It offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape, including parts of San Benito County and the nearby Monterey Bay.\n\nLooking to the west from its peak, you can see Santa Cruz to the north and Monterey and Pacific Grove to the south.\n\nThe panoramic views don’t end there, with views of Henry W. Coe State Park to the northeast; Gilroy, Hollister, and the Quien Sabe volcanic peaks to the east; the San Benito River valley; and some of the more remote parts of the Diablo Range lying beyond.\n\nFremont Peak, with its rich history and spectacular natural surroundings, holds a special place in the hearts of San Benito County residents. It is a place where the past and the present converge, creating a distinct sense of connection to the land.\n\nFor the few who know, it’s more than just a peak; it’s an archive of California’s early history, and testament to the enduring beauty of the rugged landscape.\n\nFremont Peak’s Unique Geology\n\nFremont Peak State Park boasts a geological wonder that sets it apart from many other state parks in California: exposed marble.\n\nThe presence of this unique geological feature is not only visually stunning but also holds significant educational and scientific value: it provides a challenging environment for many specialized plants.\n\nAccording to Doris Sloan, who wrote about the peak’s unique geology in Bay Nature, “The Gavilan Range is composed of granitic and metamorphic rocks found only west of the San Andreas.”\n\nSloan describes this geologist’s paradise.\n\nShe writes that marble, schist, quartzite, granitic rocks, dolomite, limestone, and mudstone are all found in the Gavilan Range (part of the Diablo Range) and that some began as sediments approximately 300 to 500 million years ago.\n\nUnique Earth Leads to Unique Life\n\nAs mentioned, Fremont Peak is home to an abundance of uncommon geology and soils, which means it’s also home to unusual plants.\n\nSome of the plants you’re likely to find on the peak are entirely different from those you may see on other nearby peaks, and vastly different than those seen on the way up.\n\nThe late spring is likely the best time to visit, when a great variety and sheer abundance of wildflowers are present.\n\nThose who visit in the late summer and early fall will find an abundance of wild buckwheats (Eriogonum sp.) and California fuchsia (Epilobium canum).\n\nThe dudleyas (Dudleya sp.) and woollypod milkweeds (Asclepias eriocarpa) have already released their seeds, and the few nearby oaks will begin dropping their acorns.\n\nRed-tailed hawks, crows, and vultures soar overhead on the regular, but a lucky few may be graced with the presence of the California condor venturing over from nearby Pinnacles National Park.\n\nDespite the park’s small size and low visitorship, more than 500 species are cataloged in the nearby area on iNaturalist. A great deal of them are natives, thanks to the largely untouched nature nearby.\n\nProtecting Fremont Peak\n\nAll of these unique features are absolutely worth protecting, but like just about anywhere else in California, this peak and the surrounding area is under the threat of development. In fact, the 159-acre park is surrounded by private land.\n\nBefore it was a state park, the mountain did see mining operations, and there’s still a risk of mining and other resource extraction in the nearby unprotected areas.\n\nFor example, sedimentary limestone is still mined nearby to the west. Limestone is formed from deposits of carbonates. When heated and compressed, that limestone can be metamorphized into marble.\n\nOne of the best first steps in protecting the peak and surrounding areas is public awareness, and the best way to learn about the park is to visit it.\n\nVisiting Fremont Peak State Park\n\nDespite being a small state park, Fremont Peak offers camping, picnicking, and limited hiking. It’s perhaps most well-known for its significance in the astronomical community. Astronomers appreciate the peak for its very low light pollution.\n\nThough the peak is surrounded by large developments, it’s said that the peak is just high enough to escape much of the surrounding light because of the presence of the marine layer coming from Monterey Bay. It’s a decades-old haven for local hobby astronomers.\n\nMost Saturday nights in the summer, you’ll find mountain-goers with their eyes to the sky, thanks to the Fremont Peak Observatory Association, which operates an observatory at the park and hosts public stargazing events.\n\nThe park is located off Highway 156, 11 miles south of San Juan Bautista on San Juan Canyon Road. You can find a map, a detailed brochure of the park, and more information on fees and hours on the Fremont Peak State Park website.\n\nThe short 1.2-mile Fremont Peak Trail wraps around the mountain before ascending to the summit, with the same distance to return.\n\nThe nearby historic San Juan Bautista De Anza Trail is a 5.2-mile out-and-back trail located near San Juan Bautista, California and extending over to the Salinas edge of the Gabilan mountains.\n\nSave Mount Diablo is working on a recreational access map for San Benito County that will include both trails.\n\nAll photos by Alexander Broom"
