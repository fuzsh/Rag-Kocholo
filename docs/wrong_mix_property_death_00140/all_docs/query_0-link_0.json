Part 1 aired on Sunday, April 13, 1986.[2] It was the 16th most-watched show of that week.[3] Part 2 had been intended to follow the next day, but was postponed a day until April 15 due to a press conference by President Ronald Reagan about Libya (see 1986 United States bombing of Libya). Part 3 was moved to Sunday, April 20. Part 2 was the 15th most watched television show for its week, and Part 3 came in 8th place.[4]\n\nThe film was based on the 1984 novel of the same name by David Nevin, based on the life of 19th century explorer and politician John C.
