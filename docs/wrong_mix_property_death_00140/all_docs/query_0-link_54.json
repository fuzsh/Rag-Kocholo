(Both men were later released.)\n\nIn 1989, a federal jury in New York found \"hotel queen\" Leona Helmsley guilty of income tax evasion, but acquitted her of extortion. (Helmsley ended up serving 18 months behind bars, a month at a halfway house and two months under house arrest.)\n\nIn 1991, Azerbaijan declared its independence, joining the stampede of republics seeking to secede from the Soviet Union.\n\nTen years ago: Hurricane John lashed tourist resorts with heavy winds and rain as the dangerous Category 4 storm marched up Mexico's Pacific coast.

Libyan rebels said they were closing in on Moammar Gadhafi and issued an ultimatum to loyalists in his hometown of Sirte (surt), his main remaining bastion: Surrender, or face attack.\n\nOne year ago: The White House announced that President Barack Obama would change the name of North America's tallest mountain peak from Mount McKinley to Denali, bestowing the traditional Alaska Native name on the eve of a historic presidential visit to Alaska. Jake Arrieta pitched the sixth no-hitter of the season and second against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 10 days, leading the Chicago Cubs to a 2-0 victory.

Movie writer-director Wes Craven, 76, who startled audiences with suburban slashers like \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Scream,\" died in Los Angeles.\n\nThought for Today: \"If you board the wrong train, it is no use running along the corridor in the other direction.\" -- Dietrich Bonhoeffer, German theologian (1906-1945)."
