        "text": "On 14 June Freiburg tramline 2 started using a new section of tramway in Waldkircher Strasse, replacing a tramway along Komturstrasse, where the rails were worn out. The new tramway features grassed tracks and two fully-accessible stops. The cost of the new construction was EUR 19.4M, with EUR 10.6M of this coming from the Land of Baden-Württemberg. Special attention was paid to walking and cycle routes from the former stops in Komturstrasse.\n\nMayor Martin Horn said, ‘We are promoting attractive public transport in line with our climate targets. With the opening of the Waldkircher Strasse tramway another stage in our reconstruction of the tramway system has been achieved. He shows not only the achievement of new tracks, but also an improvement in climate-friendly infrastructure through the city’s investment. The 4000 residents of the new homes on the former goods railway yard area have optimal access and the new tram stops are fully accessible, unlike the old stops. We thank the Land government for their support’.\n\nFreiburg-im-Breisgau (population 230 250) has five-line metre-gauge tramway, first opened in 1901. The 32.3km (20.1-mile) system is operated by VAG with a fleet of 73 trams, with low-floor cars introduced from 1990. The newest are Siemens Combino (281-290) and CAF Urbos (301-317). The last extension to the system brought trams to Messe (trade fair grounds) in December 2020."
