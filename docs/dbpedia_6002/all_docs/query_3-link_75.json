You can download map segments for offline use, but the layers for each activity type have to be saved separately.\n\nTourist website for the national park area: nationalpark-schwarzwald.de\n\nTourist website for the High (Hoch) southern part of the Black Forest: hochschwarzwald.de . This region also provides a guest card\n\nThe English Wikivoyage page has some content, but if you can read German or just apply a translation app then the German Wikivoyage page is much more detailed.\n\nBlack-forest-travel.com has some good suggestions if you dig around a bit, e.g. there are some lesser known spots in pages like Landscape.\n\nThe Travel Germany: The Black Forest episode of the Expat Cast has some good suggestions for the area around Feldberg/Titisee.\n\nVeranstaltungen-schwarzwald.de lists events and festivals in the Black Forest, but only in German it seems.\n\nImgur album of images used in this post, plus some nice scenic examples from my travels there.\n\nAnglo expectations\n\nEnglish speakers seem to really romanticise the Black Forest. To quote one perplexed German on Tripadvisor:\n\nThe fixation with foreign tourists and foreign tourist information pages, guide books and so on with the Black Forest is simply bizarre. It is a bloody ordinary Mittelgebirge (rolling hill country) of which there are many in Germany; they make up half of the country. it is no more or less interesting than the others and it e.g. clearly loses if you compare it with the Harz. Triberg itself qualifies as a particularly bad tourist trap with silly cuckoo clocks and fake highest waterfalls\n\nGerman bloke on Tripadvisor\n\nHonestly I agree to an extent. The Black Forest is a beautiful area and there are endless hidden little corners to discover. I like it and don’t regret a minute that I have spent there. But it isn’t really exceptional.\n\nThere are lots of German Mittelgebirge (medium sized mountains/rolling hills) that offer much of the same and could easily fit any Fairy Tale Forest/Wooden house requirements: Saxon Switzerland, Harz, Bayrische Wald, Spessart….. Across the border I spend lots of time in the Swiss Jura and Emmental regions which have much of the same feel, even lower lying areas in the Swiss flatland like the Bucheggberg often have the right look. The Emmental even has more of the giant wooden farmhouses and feels more Black Foresty than the real Black Forest at times.\n\nDespite what meany people think there isn’t any link between the Brothers Grimm and the Black Forest. Originally the Black Forest seemed to gain popularity with the English speaking world for the thermal baths and hiking. However , much of the fascination now seems to be related to a belief that the Brothers Grimm were either inspired to write their stories after visiting (very wrong) or collected their stories which all/mostly originated there (wrong, but a bit less wrong at least). This isn’t helped when even the BBC can be used as a source to cite the incorrect myth. Plenty of the stories collected by the brothers Grimm were set in forest, but just generic forest rather than any specific location, and they lived and worked in a different part of Germany. If you want to visit the places where the Brothers Grimm lived and worked then see the German Fairy Tale Road. There are some more modern tales based in the Black Forest like ‘The Necromancer’ or ‘Heart of Stone’, though I doubt many people are familiar with them. For Germans themselves it tends to be more associated with a 1980s TV drama series or somewhere their aunt goes camping every summer.\n\nTo their credit the Black Forest tourist website never mentions anything to do with the brothers Grimm (nor do any German language bloggers when writing about the region). They just go hard on the cuckoo clocks instead.\n\nCuriously, despite the higher level of interest compared to most other rural regions in Europe. It is quite hard to find much useful information in English beyond just a few destinations. There are endless travel blogs and articles, but they can all be summed up in 3 simple steps:\n\nIncorrect Brothers Grimm reference (“easy to see why the views had inspired the Brothers Grimm to write their fairy tales.“, “The Brothers Grimm were preoccupied with it“, “Visit Germany’s beautiful tree covered hills, where the Brothers Grimm derived inspiration for their fairy tales” etc)\n\nCake and/or ham reference.\n\nA brief visit to one or two of the same few places (Titisee, Baden-Baden, Triberg, etc).\n\nWhat to expect\n\nA forested/hilly region well suited for scenic touring and/or outdoor activities.\n\nThe keyword is ‘Rural’, not ‘Wilderness’. You could carefully plan a route to spend days walking without passing through a village, but you will still be crossing roads and seeing plenty of other reminders of civilisation.\n\nIt is a popular tourist area, but other than in the main hotspots visitors will be very spread out so it rarely feels crowded (or even like there is anyone else around most of the time). In my experience most visitors are domestic German tourists, followed by a much smaller number of Swiss/French/Dutch from the neighbouring countries. Most properly international visitors just briefly hit the main tourist traps on a fast moving coach tour.\n\nFor the central/western part of Europe it is a very large amount of forest, but for people coming with expectations of endless wild and thick forest it is going to be a bit of a disappointment. It might once have been an impenetrable forest, but that is long gone. The sunlight reaches the ground as much as it does in every forest (probably more than in many). Due to mass deforestation followed by replanting of mono-cultures many areas are quite dull. There are also problems with trees dying in the warm dry summers from drought and bark-beetles, so it isn’t uncommon to turn a corner and find a tree graveyard.\n\nThe forest is not very lively. You might hear some birds, and see the odd deer or squirrel but that is about it. I have spent over a week cycling from north to south and saw 4 hares and 2 squirrels the entire time. There are a small number of wolves and Lynx, but there is basically zero chance of seeing them.\n\nThere are pretty giant wooden farmhouse buildings which you might find anywhere in the Black Forest (especially the south), and whole villages of beautiful half timbered houses in some of the historically richer valleys (eg Schiltach), but mostly it is fairly plain old stone farmhouses or inoffensive but forgettable modern housing.\n\nOn a clear day you can get views of the Swiss Alps and French Vosges. Though photographers and tourism pages have a habit of playing the former up to make it look like they tower over the Black Forest.\n\nGeneral travel tips\n\nMostly the standard travel tips for Germany apply.\n\nMany areas (but not the cities like Freiburg) provide overnight visitors with the KONUS guest card which allows free travel on local transport (so not the fast intercity trains) within the entire Black Forest holiday area. This is great if you are on the train lines or in a transport hub, but might be next to useless in smaller villages with only one or two buses a day.\n\nIn the main tourist spots English should be fine, outside of them you will probably find it more hit and miss. The official tourism websites are all just in German with a built-in Google Translate function for other languages which probably says quite a bit about who they expect (or maybe just their IT budget)\n\nNot every village has a shop. Even a restaurant can be a bit much to hope for at times. Being Germany there will however always be at least one cigarette vending machine per village.\n\nThere are a few Mountain House like guesthouses scattered about, especially around the popular areas like the Feldberg, but they are not everywhere.\n\nThere are a small number of wild campsites which can be booked at https://www.trekking-schwarzwald.de/ . Otherwise wild camping is illegal.\n\nIt is the sort of place that gets better the more you know it. There are so many hidden little spots.\n\nWhat actually is typical Black Forest?\n\nForested hills and giant wooden farmhouses. There are times when what you see matches the romantic images.\n\nBlack Forest Ham (Schwarzwälder Schinken). One thing you might notice is that in a region famous for its ham products there are a conspicuous lack of pigs. 90% of the meat is imported from other regions of Germany or the EU. Those that are there are usually kept indoors so you would only know they were there by the smell. In the EU the Black Forest ham term is protected to ham made in a certain area and with a certain method, elsewhere anything can be called Black Forest ham so long as it meets the minimum local legal definition of ham (or pork product).\n\nCuckoo clocks (Kuckucksuhren) have a good claim to heritage. Given the faff to fix them clocks don’t seem to be worth the bother. On a more practical level for something you might actually find useful there are a few watchmakers scattered around the Black Forest, especially around Pforzheim which is home to many of the more affordable options (map of companies).\n\nBlack Forest gâteau/cake (Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte). The German name certainly comes from the local cherry schnapps, though if the cake was first created in the Black Forest is unclear. How much you enjoy this might vary somewhat depending on how hard the confectioner goes with the Kirsch; the right amount adds character, too much and it is overpoweringly alcoholic. Something that can be a nasty surprise for parents ordering it for their kids (though many cafes will offer a non-alcoholic version).\n\nThe Bollenhutte (the hat with the red balls) make a great logo but is not very representative. They are used by the tourism board for the whole region, but they were only actually used in a few protestant villages which made up a tiny proportion of the Black Forest.\n\nGlass making was a major industry here for centuries. Looking over a map you will find endless places called Glashütte (literally ‘glass hut’). There are a few museums/shops you can visit.\n\nThere isn’t really any food or drink that is truly Black Forest beyond the ham. There are local beers like Rothaus and Waldhaus, and even whisky and gin have started to be produced in recent years.\n\nBlack Forest gummy bears are a purely USA thing. Nobody in Europe has even heard of them outside of Reddit comments.\n\nWhere to go\n\nThere isn’t really much that stands out as an “absolute must see” in itself, and you don’t need to try and cover the whole region to tick off all the main sights. You can go almost anywhere to get the feel for the Black Forest. It is the sort of place that offers endless beautiful spots, hidden corners, and good hiking/biking routes, in any given small area.\n\nIt is small enough that you can set up a central base somewhere like around Wolfach and spend a few days exploring most of the region by car. You could also spend weeks visiting every last corner or doing long distance trails, or with the train lines and roads it is easy to pass through and combined other places in the area like the Alsace.\n\nFor the average visitor wanting to swing through and get a quick feel a few days is enough to take in the atmosphere and visit a few different areas.\n\nA few places and points of interest:\n\nThe tourist hotspots\n\nThere are a few spots which are dense with tourism, but even in those places you will quickly leave the crowds if you just walk a few hundred meters away.\n\nThe worst tourist traps:\n\nTriberg. This often seems to seen as the place to go. I was really not impressed. Half of the town is rather ugly/bland, the other half is tacky/kitschy, and a busy main road with trucks runs through the middle of it. Pick anywhere else in the Black Forest and it will have more charm.\n\nThe main attraction are the Triberg waterfalls which start right next to the town centre. Touted as the highest waterfalls in Germany, the key is to note that the plural is always used in official marketing, it is actually a series of cascades rather than a single high fall (Röthbachfall in the Alps is the highest single fall in Germany). It also has a surprisingly steep entrance fee – up to 8 Euros for adults depending on time of year.\n\nTitisee. Confusingly this consists of Titisee (the lake), Titisee (the tourist town on the lake), and Titisee-Neustadt (the main town which is actually 6 km from the lake). Titisee seems to be entirely dedicated to the tourist industry, the lakefront promenade on Seestrasse especially is ridiculously tacky and touristy (though it is at least car-free). The origin of the name isn’t known for certain, but there are a few ideas behind the name which tends to amuse English speakers.\n\nThe lake is pretty enough but. It is an easy 6 km walk around the lake. However, the western side is alongside a road with only very limited views of the lake, and the southern side is across fields with no view of the lake, so I would suggest just going along the eastern shore to the campsite and back.\n\nMummelsee. A small lake sitting quite high up in the northern end which seems to get an extraordinary amount of attention. It is fine but nothing special in my experience. Sitting directly on the Hochstrasse panorama road it is a popular stopping point with tourist tack on sale and almost as much car parking space as lake area. The more interesting thing to do is carry up on up to the Hornisgrinde which is the highest mountain in the northern Black Forest and has some fantastic views.\n\nIt goes hard advertising itself with fairy tales, which are rather undermined by the roar of motorbikes in the background and people mooching around buying souvenirs. There are plenty of quiet lakes in the forest which are much more magical.\n\nHofgut Sternen. A collection of tourist trap restaurants/shops which are a mandatory stop for coach tours. This is at least next to the impressive Ravenna Bridge and makes a starting point for walking up the Ravenna gorge.\n\nFeldberg. The highest point in the Black Forest at 1493m is unsurprisingly a big tourist magnet. It is actually a fairly large plateau/ridge connecting the Feldberg itself with the slightly lower Seebuck (1448m) – requiring an almost 2km walk from one end to the other to get the full range of views. The sight of hundreds of people marching back and forth across it like ants on a busy day is a little amusing/ridiculous. It is the main downhill ski area in the Black Forest and easy to access by car or public transport. Meaning it is somewhat overbuilt and very touristy (especially on the eastern Seebuck side where the multistory car park, ski lifts, and resort are).\n\nIf you just drive up, take the cable car (a pricey 16 Euro return for only a 175m height gain) look at the views, and then go down again it will be likely be a bit dull and expensive. I would recommend combining it with a bigger tour including other options such as the Feldsee, Herzogenhorn, and/or the various mountain huts like the St Wilhelmer Hütte or Zastler Hütte. The best tour I did there was driving to Rinken, hiking up to Feldberg, down to St. Wilhelmer Hütte, then skirting around the north side of the Feldberg back to Rinken via the Zastler Hütte (8km, +/- 300m, essentially a shorter version of this).\n\nBad Wildbad. A small spa town that has put some attention grabbing bits of infrastructure in like the Baumwipfelpfad tree top path and tower and the Wildline suspension bridge. In fairness I have to say I have not been there and the town doesn’t look like it is filled with tack like Titisee or Triberg. What does look like a tourist trap are the attractions on the Sommerberg above the town which look like they were designed with Instagram in mind, and all come with a rather expensive entrance fee.\n\nThe Wildline suspension bridge especially. The bridge is impressive in size and looks cool on photos, but with a 9.5 Euro entry fee it really is just an expensive novelty viewing platform. It sits across the very top of the valley with a flat path that runs parallel to it on the hilltop, so it isn’t actually very high and doesn’t offer any purpose as a bridge.The view looks nice enough, but not any different to the endless free views. It seems especially pointless when the tree path and tower offer more extensive views of the same area (even the restaurant at the funicular seems to have more extensive views…). There are plenty of free suspension bridges which are much more impressive nearby in the Alps, and even the gimmicky Sigriswil panoramic bridge in Switzerland manages to be cheaper and offer a much more impressive view.\n\nMaybe I will visit one day and declare that I was wrong (but I doubt it).\n\nSome of the other popular places:\n\nFreiburg im Breisgau. More at the foot of rather than in the Black Forest, but it offers good transport connections into the Black Forest and is a beautiful and lively little city that is worth a visit in itself.\n\nSchluchsee. The name of both a (reservoir) lake and village. The only real problem with the lake area is that a fairly busy road which runs along almost all the north side of the lake. My favourite part is the Aha end and the Vesperstube Unterkrummenhof. The village of Schluchsee itself is probably best described as a pleasant holiday resort, somewhere which would be great to stay with your family, but there isn’t any real reason to visit for the village itself.\n\nRavenna Gorge. A gorge between Freiburg iB and Titisee. Worth a stop and walk through if you are passing by and have the time. Famous for the Christmas market at the lower end.\n\nBaden-Baden. Spa town.\n\nFreilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof. A large collection of houses from the region that were rebuilt in a single location.\n\nBaiersbronn. A village noted for having a number of Michelin star restaurants.\n\nSome of my favourite locations:\n\nUnsurprisingly mostly in the south given my experience.\n\nMuchenland and Blasiwald. The view from Muchenland is tiny, but to me it is peak Black Forest (it is the cover image for this page).\n\nIbach. A collection of houses (even village seems a generous term) in a quiet valley with some fantastic views towards the Alps on a clear day. The panoramaweg is a fantastic hike.\n\nSt Blasien. Probably the sight that has surprised me most so far. A village dominated by the giant dome of a baroque monastery, all snuggled away in a valley.\n\nHerzogenhorn. The 2nd (or possibly 3rd or even 4th depending on how you count the various parts of the Feldberg) highest mountain in the Black Forest at 1415m and the Feldberg’s more attractive little sister. The smaller peak offers a better panoramic view, and the fact that it takes some effort to get there means the number of other people tends to be fairly small. Access is easy from Feldberg, or climbing up from Menschenschanz also lets you see the attractive villages there and stop at the Berggasthaus Krunkelbachhütte. The view to the north is blocked by the Feldberg, but that isn’t the most interesting direction anyway. It also has the largest summit cross you will ever see.\n\nVesperstube Eichrüttehof, Görwihl. Not exceptional or something to go out of your way for, but a very nice example of a little farmhouse restaurant.\n\nAussichtsturm Hochkopf, Todtnau. A lookout tower at the end of a fantastic ridge walk. Free parking across the road from the Waldhotel Auerhahn a short walk below the tower. There are endless hills called Hochkopf around the Black Forest but this is the only one with a tower as far as I know.\n\nThe Schluchensteig. Especially in the Wutachschlucht, for a shorter and easier version in a single day see the 3-Schluchten Tour (3 gorge tour). I haven’t actually done this as a joined up multi-day walk but I have covered all the areas it passes through.\n\nMy to do list\n\nMost of it is planned by bike to cover a bigger distance. With most trips aiming to end or start with family in the south.\n\nSchauninsland and the Engländer Denkmal.\n\nBelchen. The next highest mountain after the Feldberg and Herzogenhorn at 1414m.\n\nBike packing from Baden-Baden up the Murgtal and then south, maybe via Freundenstadt and Alpirsbach.\n\nBike packing from Offenburg south through: Gengenbach up the valley to Schiltach (with a few diversions to spots like Burg Hohengeroldseck + Herberge zum Löwen), then south through Triberg and Titisee.\n\nSchwarzwald-Panorama-Radweg.\n\nKarlsruher Grat. One of the rare rocky sections.\n\nKlösterle-Schleife (Bad Rippoldsau-Schapbach).\n\nBurgbach Wasserfall.\n\nWhat to do\n\nThere are plenty of things to do in the Black Forest.\n\nActive sports like hiking and biking are the main attraction (see below).\n\nThere are plenty of destinations like Mehliskopf which offer a more relaxed way to enjoy the views, and with attractions like mountain coasters.\n\nSpas. Like Baden-Baden or the giant Badeparadies Schwarzwald by Titisee.\n\nMuseums are a bit limited. The obvious choice is the Vogtsbauernhof open air museum and there are a number of smaller ones scattered around. There are also a surprising number of mines, like Museums-Bergwerk Schauinsland.\n\nGetting about\n\nFor a quick visit and just to get a taste of the region then public transport working from a base like Freiburg or Baden Baden is fine, but If you really want to explore and visit a wider area and/or some of the more obscure corners in a reasonable amount of time then you need a car.\n\nPublic transport\n\nThe most practical options are the train lines going up from cities like Freiburg, Offenburg and Rastatt. Trains usually run hourly. They can even be half hourly on some sections like Freiburg – Titisee.\n\nFor small villages buses tend to be slow and can be infrequent in the week (they are often linked to school times or the start/end of the working day), rarer on Saturdays, and essentially non-existent on Sundays.\n\nPopular tourist spots will be better connected, especially on weekends and holidays in season when extra hiking buses are put on.\n\nDriving\n\nThe Schwarzwaldhochstrasse (B500) is the route that is normally highlighted, though driving anywhere in the region will be scenic.\n\nThere are a large number of free car parks all over the region. Most are quite small but do the job for scattered tourism.\n\nThe windy roads might be a problem for anyone who gets car sick easily.\n\nThe locals are only slightly mad. Cutting corners and overtaking at inadvisable times are common, but they far from the worst I have seen.\n\nTake care on weekends and holidays. Cyclists slowing you down, lots of blind corners making it hard to safely overtake, and suicidal motorbikes coming up the rear.\n\nActivities/Sports\n\nThere is lots of freedom on getting around thanks to the very dense and extensive network of paths and forest roads (it is very hard to try and find a spot on the map where you can draw a 200m line in any direction without crossing at least one). If you are not following an explicitly marked path then this can mean endlessly checking your GPS for which turning to take. I highly recommend downloading the area on Maps.me or similar.\n\nForests can suddenly give way to a beautiful little hidden meadows or wide views. But given that hardly any of the Black Forest is above the treeline, you can often spend hours in the trees without looking out. Maps.me is again quite useful for listing where good viewpoints are.\n\nBeing a domestic destination it offers plenty of family and kid friendly activities and route suggestions.\n\nTour planner\n\nThe Schwarzwald.info tour planner is the best way I have found to see all the official networks for getting about by foot and bike, it lets you plan routes which you can download as a GPX.\n\nThe more zoomed in you are, then the more details on the coverage and conditions you will get.\n\nThere are a multitude of things you can set the map to display (restaurants, waterfalls, etc) by clicking on features and then contents. This is not entirely exhaustive for any of the options I have looked into, but it is certainly better than nothing.\n\nAnnoyingly you can’t show and work with multiple layers at once. If you want to switch between layers (e.g. to jump from MTB to standard cycling) as you plan, then it will re-route your existing markers to fit the new filter. You can drag the routes back to where you want them (if you can remember), but it is a bit of a faff to say the least.\n\nBoth the cycling and mountain bike routes can be quite roundabout. The MTB routes especially often ask the question of “why cycle through 2km of gravel road in the forest with 50m of height change, when you could cycle through 7km gravel road with 350m of height change instead?”. If you are trying to cover a fair distance and don’t want to pay with extra height and length then Komoot is very good at routing you off the main road but with direct paths for an efficient price in height change (but it is still worth checking their route carefully to make sure it isn’t taking you up a steep and bumpy footpath (again)).\n\nHiking\n\nThere are endless options from little local loops to long distance treks.\n\nAs ever the problem is you just drown in information and options when you have a big region and seemingly endless ideas dumped on you. A good starting point for ideas would be the listing of “best” paths like the Genießerpfade, also the German Wanderinstitut website has top rated hikes in the Hochschwarzwald, and further north in the middle/upper Black Forest, and also all the best hikes in the Bundesland.\n\nOtherwise A few other resources for suggestions are Kleinhans-blog, and wandern, and Bergreif, and Sasbachwalden.\n\nThere isn’t really hut to hut hiking. There are some buildings you can class as mountain huts, but mostly you are looking at village to village.\n\nIt is well signed. Distances here and elsewhere in Germany tend to given in distance rather than time as is the case in Switzerland.\n\nMore often than not you are on gravel road rather than true single trail paths (in my experience, and it might vary by region).\n\nCycling and Mountain Biking\n\nSee my dedicated page for cycling and mountain biking in the Black Forest.\n\nWinter\n\nSnow is increasingly unreliable. If you turn up on a given day in winter you are more likely to see grass than snow. I have been there every Christmas since 2015 and only one has really been snowy.\n\nCross country skiing is the most prevalent option Given that you have lots of valleys and relatively gentle/low hills.\n\nDownhill skiing is limited in scope, but relatively cheap compared to the Alps. I don’t ski but am told that Feldberg can get very crowded on weekends.\n\nMisc\n\nTravel articles/blogs:\n\nI have yet to find an English language blog post on the Black Forest which I like.\n\nRick Steves actually has one of the better attempts.\n\nBLACK FOREST – Ein Roadtrip durch die Heimat (In German).\n\nBits of history or culture:\n\nI mentioned it above already, but the story of the hike gone wrong shortly before WW2 is worth a read.\n\nIt is in German but the SWR does some good TV shows\n\nAn overview of the castle ruins in the Black Forest (German).\n\nOther:"
