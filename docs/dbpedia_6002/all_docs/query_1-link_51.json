        "text": "In Freiburg, everything revolves around the higher education institutions and university clinic because they play an important role in research and teaching. Alongside the various higher education institutions, the town boasts numerous research institutes which have strong links to the higher education institutions. There are five , two and one . The institutions are also an important economic factor in the city. Solar energy also plays an important role in research and business in Freiburg as lots of solar energy is generated here in Freiburg.\n\nThe „Bertoldsbrunnen“ is an important town square. All major tram lines pass through this station, and here you’ll find yourself in the very heart of town.\n\nFrom there, it’s just a short walk to the Münster, Freiburg’s most important tourist attraction. Markets regularly take place on the square that surrounds the large church. Here you can buy regional specialities, sausages, fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nIn Freiburg, it’s also worth looking downwards, to the ground. The old town is full of little streams, or „Bächle“, as they’re known here, one of the city’s landmarks. But be careful not to fall in! If you do, it’s said you have to marry someone from Freiburg."
