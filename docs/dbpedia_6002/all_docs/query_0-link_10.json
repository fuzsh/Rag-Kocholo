        "text": "Freiburg was founded in the year 1120 by Konrad and Duke Berthold III of Zähringen as a free market town - as its very name suggests, with “Frei” meaning “free” and “burg” translating into “town” or “city”.\n\nLocated at a strategic location connecting a multitude of trade routes between the Mediterranean and North Sea regions, Freiburg quickly grew in size and population. By the year 1200 it already boasted 6000 citizens.\n\nThe silver mines in the region were one of the most important factors for the initial development of the city but Freiburg quickly grew into vital academic and educational focal point. As a university city and commercial centre, Freiburg attracted many high-profile members of societies over the centuries and remained a bastion of Catholicism amid the Reformation.\n\nOver the years, however, the many wars fought in the regions surrounding Freiburg took its toll on the city. Among the most disastrous of them were the Thirty Years’ War which saw the displacement and death of over 10,000 of the city’s residents and the Second World War during which the city suffered heavy bombings from Allied forces.\n\nFreiburg is the region’s economic center. The service sector as well as the public service sector dominate the local economy. Being a university city, Freiburg’s largest employer is the local university with the university hospital, followed by numerous state and subordinate authorities.\n\nFreiburg is also a hub for environmentally friendly technology. Numerous specialists and public trade fairs, particularly in the field of solar energy, make Freiburg an important regional trade fair location.\n\nAccording to 2016 data, Freiburg achieved a gross domestic product (GDP) of €11.264 billion within the city limits, making it 35th in the ranking of German cities by economic output."
