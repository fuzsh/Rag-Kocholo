        "text": "In recent decades, Serbia has been undergoing a period of post-socialist transition that has significantly altered the value system underlying spatial development due to alteration of ownership frameworks and land use rights. In consequence, issues have arisen of how to strike a balance between the various interests involved in the distribution of spatial resources and how to control the outcomes of public policies. Land use planning has been identified as an efficient instrument for implementing the public policy value framework. The objective of this paper is to identify the key points of land use planning in relation to urban forest management of significance for the maintenance of urban forests in the environment of post-socialist institutional transformation in Serbia. Seen as an institutional structure, the practice of land use planning in Serbia is the product of a stable interaction between the set of interrelated rules, procedures and organisational units that allows spatia...\n\nUrban forests contribute to social, aesthetic and economic benefits within cities. In urban forest management, these aspects are often not incorporated, especially in the countries of South East Europe (e.g. Serbia), where the management of urban forests is still dominated by classical forestry aims (i.e. timber production). This paper analyzes the Košutnjak urban forest in Belgrade, with a special emphasis on the needs of its visitors and the importance of its use. We aim to raise awareness of the social benefits that this urban forest provides to residents and offer suggestions for sound and responsible management, which are based on the assumption of active and regular involvement of visitors. This case study contributes to a better understanding of visitors' relationships with this urban forest, which is an important urban forest at the country level. Visitors of this urban forest completed a face-to-face survey, which indicated that most of the visitors came from surrounding neighborhoods, mainly for active recreation (engaging in sports) and relaxation in the forest. Most of respondents were satisfied with the management and maintenance of the area. Nevertheless, they offered suggestions for improvements. Most of the visitors would be willing to get personally involved in a decision-making process regarding the area and showed a willingness to pay money toward the maintenance via fees. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential and need of public involvement in the management of such urban forests. The findings indicate that this approach could help decision makers express commonly shared values in management decisions.\n\nWith the increase in the number of the global population, that is likely to grow also in the nearest decades, the expansion of cities continues at the expense of forests and farmlands, and in these new areas, a more significant role is granted to the interaction between cities and countryside, revealing diverse interests of stakeholders. It is necessary to preserve, and it is even desirable, to expand the green spaces of the urbanized territories. Vienna, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Riga were selected for the study. The authors looked at the experience of the urban and green area planning through the literature review of city planning documents. Analyses of results show that planning takes place at the city, suburban or regional level and in the case of Riga, its development is similar to the development of other large European cities. The share of the urban forests in the territory of Riga city and its suburbs is comparatively large. In the European cities, which are rich in forests,...\n\nThis review regards the management and social problems in European urban and suburban forests linked to their maintenance and human use. They can be divided into major categories: forest management problems (e.g., the low priority of urban forestry, various or diffused urban forest management, lack of management plans or lack of sufficient funds); the social reception of forest works and forests (e.g., emotional reactions to total clear-cutting, negative evaluation of logging traces, negative evaluation of poor tourist infrastructure, specific expectations concerning a model forest: e.g., tall, of low density, mixed, old); and relations between forest users (problems related to e.g., crowding, fast-moving people, the presence of dogs, littering, thefts or noisy behaviour). Here, special attention is paid to problems and negative interactions, as they are challenges to forest management, as well as to the development of plans, strategies, and policies, both in relation to existent fo...\n\nBackground and Objectives: Urban forests and green space contribute to human wellbeing. Green infrastructure is recognized by the European Union as a planning tool that contributes to the implementation of many public policies, with urban forests and green space as its main building blocks. Croatia and Slovenia are young democracies and recent members of the European Union. Hence, they also need to contribute to the implementation of those policies. Previous review studies on urban forests and green space rarely addressed scientific or professional publications in those countries. Furthermore, the body of knowledge about urban forest and green space research and practice in post-socialist countries is still rather weak. The goal of the paper is (a) to show that urban forest and green space research and practice is much stronger in these countries than it is possible to assume based only on previous review papers or only by searching Scopus and Web of Science, and (b) to describe publications written by scientists and professionals in the past 30 years. Materials and Methods: We used a trilingual systematic literature review to identify scientific and grey literature in various databases, as well as a snowballing technique, and yielded 211 publications in Croatia and 84 in Slovenia. Results: We identified many more publications on urban forests and green space science and practice in Croatia and Slovenia than it was possible to assume based only on previous review papers and when searching solely publications in English. Croatian authors showed continuity over time in terms of number of publications, while Slovenian publications have been on the rise in the past decade. In both countries, scientific papers were most frequent, and the vast majority of studies addressed capital cities. Croatian publications mainly focused on parks and park-forests, while Slovenian publications focused on urban forests. Interestingly, Croatian authors were affiliated with over 60 organizations, and in comparison to Slovenian authors, have stronger preference towards publishing in their local language. Green space planning and design followed by resource inventory were the most frequent themes. The least addressed themes in both countries were resource management, economic aspects, policy, legislation or governance. Conclusions: Important discussion in the future, especially in Croatia, would be regulation of urban forestry as a profession. Cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary studies, as well as focusing on cities other than capitals in future, can help in addressing issues such as climate change or application of participatory approaches."
