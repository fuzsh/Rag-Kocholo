        "text": "During the main experimental sessions, on average, 11.04 ± 3.34 MUs were reliably decomposed (online surface EMG decomposition) per subject (N = 7). An identified MU pool from a subject sorted based on recruitment order is shown in Figure 1A. As indicated by the green and red marks, the order in which MUs are de-recruited often differed from the recruitment order. For example, once recruited, an MU could keep discharging action potentials even when the exerted force level was below the initial recruitment threshold. For the target task (see Materials and methods), two pairs of MUs with a small difference in recruitment threshold were selected out of the entire pool. Each pair was selected either from the first or from the last recruited half of the MU pool. Figure 1B visualises the recruitment thresholds of these selected MUs. Within pairs, MU1 was recruited before MU2 and the lower threshold pair (blue) was recruited before the higher threshold one (red). Recruitment and de-recruitment threshold of the selected MUs showed a strong relationship across days and subjects (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, R = 0.53, p<0.001; see Figure 1C). On average, the de-recruitment threshold was –1.11 ± 2.44% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) smaller than the recruitment one, and in 66.7% a selected MU was de-recruited at a force level below its initial recruitment threshold. The overall observed effect, however, was weak (see Materials and methods, p=0.111).\n\nDuring the target task, subjects were asked to navigate a cursor inside a 2D space by modulating the discharge rate of MU1 and MU2. Three different targets inside the 2D plane were used to encourage subjects to activate both MUs independently despite their different position within the recruitment order. An entire trial cycle of this target task is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\nFor example, to reach TIII, subjects must keep the higher threshold unit MU2 active while keeping the lower threshold unit MU1 off. Figure 3A shows, as an example, the average cursor position during target hits and nearest misses for each target-of-interest across conditions towards the beginning and end of training for a single subject. At the beginning of the task, the subject failed in the majority of trials to place and hold the cursor inside the target-of-interest. With training, the ability to place the cursor inside the designated target area improved. As shown in Figure 3A, TH was hit in all 30 trials, and in only 4 trials, the subject could not hit TI. Moreover, the nearest misses for TIII in the 12th training session were closer to the target centre than on day 1. This improvement in hitting targets and angles over several training days was observed across all subjects (see Figure 3B). The target hit rate improved from the first to the last day of training from 41.19 ± 17.76% to 67.04 ± 18.17% (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.028). A similar trend was observed for the angle hits with an improvement from 64.37 ± 13.15% to 81.11 ± 9.84% (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.016). According to the distanced-based performance metric (defined in Materials and methods), the performance per subject across targets and conditions improved from the first to the last day of training from 0.56 ± 0.09 to 0.69 ± 0.10 (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.016). Despite this clear improvement in performance across days, the ability to move the cursor towards the target-of-interest enhanced differently across targets (see Figure 3C). The performance in hitting TI did not significantly improve from the first day of training to the last day (from 0.67 ± 0.18 to 0.68 ± 0.11; two-sided Wilcoxon singed-rank test, p=0.938). Similarly, no significant improvement was observed for TII (from 0.69 ± 0.11 to 0.80 ± 0.13; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.109). However, a significant improvement in performance was detected when subjects were asked to move towards TIII (from 0.33 ± 0.12 to 0.59 ± 0.17; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.016). Furthermore, across conditions and days, we only found minor within-session learning (mean correlation between performance and consecutive trials across days and condition for TI: 0.037 ± 0.078, TII: 0.066 ± 0.094, TIII: 0.043 ± 0.074, see Figure 3—figure supplement 1C) with no significant difference across targets (Friedman, p=0.103).\n\nTaken together, target and angle hits, as well as the performance metric, indicate that subjects improved in navigating the cursor towards the target-of-interest across days. However, the main improvement was observed for reaching TIII, which started from poor initial performance. Moreover, subjects experienced a steep learning curve at the beginning of the experiment, while the learning rate seemed to decrease towards the end. For this reason, further analysis only focuses on the last 5 days of training to avoid additionally induced variability by greater learning rates at the beginning of training.\n\nThe performance of reaching each target did not solely depend on the target’s position but also on the difference in recruitment and de-recruitment threshold within the selected MU pair, that is, the force difference between the onset and offset of activity between MU2 and MU1 measured during the initial force task (see Materials and methods). Figure 3D and E illustrate the performance over the within-pair difference in recruitment and de-recruitment threshold, respectively, for each target-of-interest. Performance per subject in reaching TI significantly increased from selected MU pairs with a small difference in recruitment threshold (0–1% MVC) to those with a high difference (3–10% MVC) from 0.61 ± 0.16 to 0.90 ± 0.05 (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.016). To reach TI, only MU1 must be active. Therefore, this result indicates that subjects performed better in keeping only MU1 active while not activating MU2 when the difference in their recruitment threshold was high. This may be due to less accuracy needed in the force generated when the recruitment threshold difference is large. For example, if MU1 gets recruited at 2% MVC while MU2 at 5% MVC, the subject could potentially exert any force between 2 and 5% MVC to keep only MU1 active without MU2 to ultimately hit TI. A more precise force level needs to be generated when this difference is smaller. For TII, no dependency in performance and the within-pair difference in recruitment threshold was detected (from 0.79 ± 0.07 to 0.72 ± 0.08, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.578). On the contrary, the performance in reaching TIII decreased significantly for larger differences in recruitment threshold within the selected MU pair from 0.66 ± 0.09 to 0.55 ± 0.04 (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.016). This indicates that subjects experienced difficulties in keeping MU2 active while MU1 was inactive in order to reach TIII when their difference in recruitment threshold was relatively large (3–10% MVC). The difference in recruitment threshold between MU1 and MU2 correlated with the difference in de-recruitment threshold (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, R=0.46, p=0.001; see Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Thus, similar implications on the relationship between performance in reaching the targets and the difference in de-recruitment threshold between MU1 and MU2 can be drawn (see Figure 3E). Subjects became better in reaching TI for a positive difference in de-recruitment thresholds (i.e. MU2 is de-recruited before MU1; 0.76 ± 0.05) than for negative ones (i.e. MU2 is de-recruited after MU1;. 044 ± 0.11; all four subjects for whom the de-recruitment threshold was recorded increased in their performance from negative to positive). When subjects had difficulties in activating MU1 without activating MU2 to reach TI (e.g. when the recruitment threshold of both MUs is similar, see above), they usually tried to switch off MU2 while keeping MU1 active to reach again towards TI. However, if MU2 was de-recruited after MU1, the subjects needed to move back to the coordinate origin to switch off MU2 before they could start a new attempt in reaching towards TI. This required additional time, resulting in lower performance. However, when MU2 was de-recruited before MU1, the subjects only needed to switch off MU2 (while MU1 remained active) before reaching TI again. For TII, no dependency between difference in de-recruitment threshold and performance was observed (from 0.83 ± 0.05 to 0.83 ± 0.04; the performance never varied more than 0.02 from a negative to a positive difference in de-recruitment threshold per subject). When asked to reach TIII, subjects decreased in performance from 0.57 ± 0.04 to 0.40 ± 0.02 for negative and positive differences in the de-recruitment threshold, respectively. The better performance for negative differences in de-recruitment thresholds may be explained by a possible strategy to reach TIII by leveraging the lower de-recruitment threshold of MU2 compared to MU1. Because of this, subjects could activate both MUs first before lowering the force level to switch off MU1 while MU2 remained active due to its lower de-recruitment threshold. This would result in cursor movement towards TIII.\n\nDuring the last 5 days of training, the majority subjects reported that they felt having control over MU2 when reaching towards TIII (14% of cases subjects indicated having no control over MU2; see Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Moreover, they declared the usage of a clear strategy to establish such control, which varied in cognitive demand across subjects and days. In 95% of all cases, this control strategy was described as a rapid increase in force due to dorsiflexion of the ankle followed by a slow release until the cursor moves towards the vertical axis.\n\nAll subjects improved their performance during training. To better understand which strategies have emerged, ultimately enabling subjects to recruit and de-recruit single MUs, we analysed the cursor trajectories during the task. The cursor movement for one subject during the last day of training (condition I) for all 30 trials is visualised in Figure 4. While the subject was able to hit all targets before the trials ended, the cursor trajectories did not always mimic the straight path, to the target centre. When asked to move towards TI, the subject moved the cursor along the horizontal axis. In trials 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10, the subject could not hit TI in the first attempt but returned to the origin to then move towards the target centre directly. For TII, in all cases, the subject moved directly along the diagonal towards the target-of-interest. For TIII, however, instead of moving directly towards the target centre, the subject moved the cursor towards TII first and then towards the vertical axis to finally hit TIII. This observation is in line with the descriptions provided by the questionnaire (see Figure 3E), that is, increase in force to activate both MUs, followed by a decrease in the force until MU1 switches off, and ultimately adjusting the force level to move along the vertical axis towards the target centre.\n\nBy analysing the unintended target and angle hits (see Figure 5A), the probability that the cursor was moved towards unselected targets while trying to hit the target-of-interest was quantified.\n\nWhile only a few unintended hits occurred across targets and conditions, unintended angle hits of TII happened multiple times when subjects tried to reach for TIII. In fact, across all conditions, almost all subjects conducted most of their unintended hits when aiming for TIII (with unintended hits in TII). Only one subject had a higher rate of unintended hits when aiming for TII (with unintended hits in TI) in condition I. Therefore, the strategy to reach TIII, that is, moving towards TII first, as illustrated in Figure 4 and interpreted by the questionnaire answers, can be observed across subjects. Moreover, the few unintended hits when reaching towards TI and TII suggest that subjects established control strategies that allowed for a direct movement towards the target-of-interest. These clear control strategies, as well as the difference in learning rate across targets, suggest that subjects were able to activate MU1 alone (to reach TI), MU1 and MU2 together (to reach TII), but could not volitionally activate MU2 before MU1 (TIII). In fact, during the last 5 days of training, 76, 78, and 94% of all successful attempts, that is, at least an angle hit, of going towards TI were achieved without activating MU2 once during the trial while it was only 7, 2, and 1% for TIII (MU2 only without MU1) in conditions I, II, and III, respectively. Such rare and occasional deviation from the normal recruitment of two MUs was already observed in one of the first studies employing single MU biofeedback (Terjung, 1981). The percentage of these direct movements towards TI and TIII with respect to the difference in recruitment threshold within the selected pair and subjects is shown in Figure 5B. While direct movements towards TI increased with a larger difference in recruitment threshold, direct movements towards TIII were very rare and only possible with MUs recruited at very similar force levels, that is, with small differences in recruitment thresholds that led to variable recruitment orders given sudden excitatory inputs at the beginning of the trials. Also, all subjects moved directly towards TI in more than 70% of all successful attempts. Although only three subjects navigated the cursor directly towards TIII in more than 5% of all successful attempts (see Figure 5C). Furthermore, 8.33% of these direct movements towards TIII occurred after TI-instructed trials. In the remaining 91.67% of the trials, direct movements towards TIII occurred after TII- or TIII-instructed trials, which required the activation of MU2 to reach the target. In contrast, direct movements towards TI occurred in 25.93% after TIII-instructed trials or even as the first trial in the session.\n\nIn these rare cases in which direct movements towards TIII ended, at least, in an angle hit, the level of force and global EMG of tibialis anterior muscle (TA), fibularis longus (FL), lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle (GL), and medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle (GM) at the time point of recruitment of MU2 was compared with the corresponding values obtained at normal recruitment of MU2 during the initial force ramps (see Materials and methods). During direct movement towards TIII, MU2 was recruited on average at a 48.43 ± 22.46% lower force level than during ramp recruitment. Also, the global EMG values at recruitment of MU2 were, on average, slightly lower during direct movements towards TIII (TA: –15.91 ± 9.67%; FL: –18.75 ± 23.27%; GL: –9.99 ± 31.53%; GM: –0.02 ± 27.31%).\n\nHowever, in the vast majority of cases, target hits of TIII were not achieved by direct movements towards the target centre. Instead, subjects used a three-stage approach to place the cursor inside TIII, as observed in Figure 4 (e.g. TIII, trial 7). First, subjects navigated the cursor along the diagonal towards TII (stage 1) before in the second stage moving towards the vertical axis. In the third stage, subjects manoeuvred the cursor along the vertical axis inside TIII. The discharge rate of MU1 and MU2 and the exerted force during indirect movement towards TIII are shown for a representative subject in Figure 6A (more single-trial examples for TIII-instructed trials are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1). During the first stage, the subject increased the force to orderly recruit MU1 and MU2. Once both MUs were active, the subject decreased the force level in stage 2 to a minimum so that MU1 stopped firing while keeping MU2 active. In the third stage, the force was slightly increased to match the necessary discharge rate of MU2 to reach TIII without reactivating MU1. To assess whether such force modulation during indirect hits of TIII could be observed across subjects and conditions, characteristic forces (due to ankle dorsiflexion) for each stage were compared in Figure 6B. The characteristic force during stage 1 was the mean force in a 100 ms window around the maximum force when both MUs were active, that is, discharge rate greater than 5 pulses per second (pps). In stage 2, the characteristic force was estimated by averaging the force inside a 100 ms window at the minimum force level after switching off MU1 while MU2 continued firing action potentials. In stage 3, the characteristic force was set as the mean force during the hold period preceding a target hit of TIII. Across conditions, all subjects used significantly different force levels during each stage (Friedman, p<0.001, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test Bonferroni-corrected, always p<0.05). During stage 1, the exerted force level was the greatest while being reduced to a minimum in stage 2, before being slightly increased again in stage 3. Furthermore, for the four subjects for whom the de-recruitment threshold was determined, 24.31% of all indirect target hits of TIII were achieved while MU2 was de-recruited before MU1 during the initial force ramps. This indicates that this three-stage approach also worked for pairs of MUs for which the de-recruitment threshold was not reversed to the recruitment one (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D)."
