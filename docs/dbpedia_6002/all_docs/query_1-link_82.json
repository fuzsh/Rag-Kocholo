        "text": "Ah! Black Forest: a piece of Heaven, not only you can find in Dessert Confectionaries but also if you step your foot on the South Western part of Germany. If the piece of pastry writes a poem in your dessert plate, Black Forest Germany sings a song for you. If the layers of chocolaty sponge cake brings thousand smiles on your face, Schwarzwald would bring millions. Come here to taste the authentic Black Forest Cherry cake. To experience World’s largest Cuckoo clock. To watch characters from your childhood stories coming alive while you getting lost in the setting of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.\n\nSomewhere between “Once upon a time” and “lived happily ever after”, every fairy tale gets coined and children across the world were brought up listening to those enabling them to gain the ability to dream about houses in the deepest of the forest made of cakes. And when in your adulthood, you finally arrive into the land of the origin of Grimm’s fairy tale, it actually becomes quite challenging to take your eyes off the forest because there is no harm for every kid inside us to expect Hansel and Gretel, still living in the woods wave to every train that crosses their path.\n\nNow, if you want to ride one such train and wave them back or choose to drive through the concrete motor road, call is yours 🙂\n\nWhen people think of Black Forest, the first idea comes to mind is about a roadtrip. For people who doesn’t (or doesn’t like to) drive, it’s really challenging to plan a Black Forest trip. Online information is so rare and all blogs and articles directing towards self drive option that we almost gave up the idea of visiting this fairy tale part of West Germany. Many of my colleagues were looking for partners who can drive and planning to take them along. We didn’t want to compromise our privacy and at the same time looked for a cheap and quick alternative (Read weekend gateway from Netherlands) so started researching deeply and finally it took shape.\n\nYou will be surprised if I tell you that most major parts of Black Forest Germany can not only be covered in Public transport but also it’s completely free of cost. In this article, I am going to share with you many such tips using which without any car hire or driving, you can explore Black Forest at ease even on weekends when the public transport schedule is pretty less. I will share you tips on Where to buy Cuckoo clock, Where to eat Black Forest cake, Where to Stay, How to reach from neighbor European countries and many more. So Stay focussed!\n\nWhere is it?\n\nBordered by the valley of Rhine river to the west and south, the Black Forest (Locally known as Schwarzwald) is a mountain region in Baden-Württemberg, southwestern Germany. With multiple picturesque villages, dense evergreen forest, lovely expanse of hills, lakes and waterfalls, its almost a 160KM long region. From little spa town Baden Baden to Lake Constance at Swiss border, Nature has carefully woven this part of Germany for Kid’s bedtime stories.\n\nThe name Black Forest comes from the general dark color of the numerous pine trees that grow in this region. As correctly said in lonelyplant, “Wandering on its many miles of forest trails, you half expect to bump into a wicked witch or huntsman, and might kick yourself for not bringing those breadcrumbs to retrace your tracks.“\n\nWhy is it Called Black Forest?\n\nBecause of its density. Nothing else unfortunately 🙂\n\nSome say that in long past, the Romans called this region as “Silva Nigra” which translates to the black or the dark. During that time, this area was an almost impenetrable region, depressing and scary. Trees were so dense that even in daytime, it was really hard to see through it.\n\nToday it is believed that half of the woods have already been cut down. It’s not dense as its past but still it’s quite beautiful without any doubt.\n\nHow To Reach Black Forest?\n\nIt’s actually a tricky question. Firstly because there are many places to choose within Black Forest and depending on where you plan to visit, your point of entry will differ. Secondly, if you decide to hire a car and self drive then it’s a completely different story altogether. Mostly people choose Frankfurt Airport because it is served internationally and you can travel here from many places outside Europe. If you are already in Europe, if you prefer coach Freiburg im Breisgau via Flixbus is the best choice. If you prefer to fly, Ryanair and Easyjet serve super cheap flights to Basel and Baden-Baden.\n\nI have listed some major options for you to consider. I have also listed the places that are easily accessible and some possible alternatives so that you can decide for yourself about the best option to reach Black Forest.\n\nFrom Frankfurt/Stuttgart\n\nIf you check distance, Stuttgart will look closer than Frankfurt. But Frankfurt airport serves direct Intercity express (ICE) train to Offenburg which is a starting point of a scenic and dreamy train ride through the Black Forest. If you want to visit the summer capital Baden Baden which is a popular spa town or the historic university town of Heidelberg with Gothic and Renaissance architecture, then also a quick train change Frankfurt runs non stop train to Mannheim. From there you need to change to a regional train and you will reach quite smoothly.\n\nStuttgart is not that simple. First from Airport you have to take a train to come to Stuttgart central station. From there, it’s identical with that of Frankfurt airport. But you will loose some time and it would cost you more to reach Black Forest. So, I would not recommend Stuttgart as a point of entry to the Black Forest.\n\nOffenburg is my kind of place in the Black Forest. Some popular places nearby are Gengenbach, Hornberg, Hausach and Triberg.\n\nVery Useful Information If you are in Alsace region of France (Like Strasbourg or Colmar), you can directly go to Offenburg or Baden Baden using DB intercity train. It costs very little and frequency is quite good. So, while planning Black Forest, you can combine it with Alsace because right in the middle of nowhere, this region of France gives birth to a Fairytale.\n\nFrom Basel Mulhouse Freiburg\n\nThis airport is called Euroairport because technically it’s in border of three countries. Depending on your Exit gate (which are clearly marked), you can land into Basel (Switzerland), Mulhouse (France) or Freiburg (Germany). From here, you can directly go to Freiburg im Breisgau, probably the most popular entry point of Black Forest (Southern side). Flixbus runs super frequent service in this route. The other option is to take Bus #50 from Airport and come to Basel SBB station (Switzerland). From there, Intercity Express (ICE) runs to Freiburg.\n\nFreiburg is a fantastic base for exploring Black Forest and some guided tours also operate from here. Some major attractions nearby this are Titisee Lake, Lenzkirch, Donaueschingen and Ravenna Gorge.\n\nFrom Karlsruhe-Baden\n\nKarlsruhe-Baden is the small airport of Baden Baden. Although Baden Baden is sometimes pronounced like synonym to Black Forest, it’s probably not the best choice if you have nature exploration is mind. If you happen to arrive this airport, you need to take airport bus #285 to reach the Baden Baden train station. From there you can continue your journey towards Heidelberg or Offenburg/GengenBack/Triberg.\n\nWhen to Visit Black Forest?\n\nAgain, a tough one because it largely depends on your interest. The good part is . If you are nearby already (Located somewhere in Germany/France/Luxemburg/Switzerland), you simply can come in multiple season to experience Black Forest in different angle.\n\nSummer (Jun-Aug)\n\nThe busiest season in Black Forest primarily because of long daylight and warm nights. By statistics, it precipitates the most in this period but with so long day, you can afford to spend some idle time at a cafe or a cuckoo clock shop. However, if you follow my blog which focuses on public transport then chances you will land up into a village where most travelers are. If you want a quiet and peaceful visit, try to avoid this season.\n\nFall (Sep-Nov)\n\nThe hard reality you first have to accept is that Germany and particularly Black Forest region is not famous for Fall colors. It’s definitely warmer than Summer but also becomes very windy so if it rains, you will have a pretty bad time. However, It’s the best time to attend wine festivals or other traditional festivities plus Winery or Harvest tour.\n\nWinter (Dec-Feb)\n\nWinter is what makes it perfectly a Black (Rather Black and White) Forest. It snows a lot in this region. Frozen lake is guaranteed and if it’s a strong winter, you can even experience Frozen Waterfalls. Whether you are a nature lover or winter sports (cross-country and downhill skiing, snowshoeing etc.) enthusiast. What you need to keep in mind however is that it gets dark pretty quickly (Read 4PM) in Winter. So you need to hit the road 9AM to enjoy sufficient outdoor activities.\n\nSpring (Mar-May)\n\nTechnically rainfall is at its minimal during the Spring. In March, there can still be snow so April and May are the proper spring season here in Black Forest. It’s one of the best season to visit to avoid crowd and high season surcharges. In full spring, you can witness spring meadow like a Violet or Yellow carpet over lush green.\n\nWe visited in Winter but if I have a second chance, I would choose late Spring to visit the Black Forest. You probably can guess, with such high altitude, full bloom of Spring definitely comes later in Black Forest. So, I would choose May for my second visit because winter holiday goers are gone, summer has not arrived, weather is pleasant, rainfall is minimal and spring is at its fullest.\n\nTransportation in Black Forest\n\nWhen comes to Black Forest, very few tourist rely on public transport or guided tour. Online articles will tell you that transportation is easy, convenient but will not give your much details. That’s why my main focus would be on travelling Black Forest in public transport. However, there are several options of roaming through Black Forest\n\nSelf Drive\n\nI will simply ignore this part because you will find several first hand experience of bloggers online about driving through different parts of Black Forest. Just understand that it’s the most popular and convenient option to explore the Black Forest at your own pace. If you love to drive, Black Forest is the place.\n\nGuided Tour\n\nThere could be many but the only one I trusted is conducted by Simone and her team. You can find all the details in their official website. The tour runs from the region of Freiburg and it’s a fantastic way to explore the Black Forest without the headache of driving. They offer Just a Driver tour as well as guided tour. There are plenty of choices depending on how long you want the tour to be. She responds quite fast over emails.\n\nP.S. I have not booked tour with her (Although I enquired her) and I am not at all gaining any commission. It’s my genuine thought after reading multiple reviews about her tour.\n\nPublic Transport\n\nTrain and Bus rides across the Black Forest are dreamy. Yes, it’s quite low in frequency (Specially on Weekends) but with proper planning, it’s managable. It’s not cheap. It’s FREE 😀 . Of course, not always but continue reading to understand how you can save a hell lot of your travel expense and at the same time not miss any major attractions. Remember for timetable, always use Deutsche Bahn website or app only. You are free to cross check with Google Map or trainline or some third party website but DB website is the final.\n\nIf you are familiar with my writing style, you know I always give a downloadable and printable Infographic which you can save in your smartphone or print it out to carry along. This infogrpahic gives you a quick idea about what you can expect if you follow my route in a visual format. Keep it handy when you plan your itinerary or during your visit to the Black Forest.\n\nIn Black Forest region, there is a concept of Konus card. If you stay in one such accommodation which falls under a certain region then the accommodation provides you free Konus card (for all members) using which you can roam across entire Black Forest region upto Basel but only in regional train, panorama bus and S-Bahn. So you can not travel for free in high speed IC, ICE, EC, ECE and mountain trains. Here is a list (Not complete exhaustive) of places staying where you can get this tremendous benefit of free transport. This benefit starts from the moment you check in and stays till midnight of your check out day.\n\nYou cannot Buy Konus Card Your Accommodation collects a Bed tax from you to participate in Konus region. If your accommodation is within Konus region, no matter where you stay, your host will provide you this card. However, it does not cover free transportation for pets or bicycles.\n\nPopular Places That Offer Konus Card\n\nDonaueschingen\n\nGengenbach\n\nHaslach\n\nHausach\n\nHornberg\n\nLenzkirch\n\nOberkirch\n\nSchonach\n\nTitisee-Neustadt\n\nTriberg\n\nPopular Places That Do Not Offer Konus Card\n\nOffenburg\n\nFreiburg im Breisgau\n\nBaden Baden\n\nHeidelberg\n\nPlaces To Explore\n\nI will take you along our journey which started from Strasbourg in France. We then arrived Offenburg via train. From there we reached Triberg via extremely scenic Haslach, Hornberg and Hausach. We stayed overnight in Triberg. Next day, we arrived to Titisee and then to Freiburg. Finally we returned to the Netherlands via Basel.\n\nOffenburg\n\nA superb misconception is that Offenburg could be a great place to start exploring Black Forest. Please understand that it neither offers Konus card nor any beautiful scenery. The only thing it does is to offer a dreamy train ride where magic comes into life. So the only place in Offenburg you should visit is the train station. Period.\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Study In Germany\n\nGengenbach\n\nWe have not stayed here but if we go for the second time, Gengenbach is the place I would choose as our base. Many people say it as the prettiest town in Germany and for a good reason. So, why we did not stay here at the first place? Because for us it was a weekend trip only and Gengenbach is not so well placed from the places we intended to visit. You need at least two nights when you stay at Gengenbach.\n\nFrom Offenburg, it’s a 5 minutes non stop regional train ride to Gengenbach. If you are looking for places to see, then Gengenbach does not offer many. The beauty lies in its cobblestone street and half timbered houses. The 18th century medieval town is super picturesque. Old houses are preserved perfectly. Just outside the town there is a vineyard too. You can hike (pretty easy and quick) to chapels above the town for gorgeous unobstructed panoramic view.\n\nI have taken the above photo from this link. We took the train to Triberg from Offenburg whose first stop was Gengenbach. Starting from Gengenbach till Triberg, the regional train ride was damn scenic. If you check in to your hotel and get a Konus card, this train ride will be free of cost. So if you have time, feel free to come back and get down at each stops\n\nHausach/Haslach\n\nThe first two train stations crossing Gengenbach are Haslach and Hausach. If you can, don’t even go to toilet during this train journey. With large glass window at both side, I can easily recommend this as a MUST DO if you are in Black Forest. The town of Haslach is not so attractive when you think of a night stay but it is famous for Black Forest Folk Costume Museum.\n\nHausach is not a place I would recommend to choose as a base of your stay. Nearby towns like Gengenbach/Hornberg/Triberg seem better choice. But as these places are super close, if you get a dreamy accommodation close to nature, then Hausach is a perfect place for nature lover and it also offers pretty scenic hiking. Moreover, it is much less busy than the rest. If you are looking for spots, Husen castle (Mostly ruins) and Open Air Mining museum Erzpoche are there for you.\n\nThe above photo is not captured by me.\n\nHornberg\n\nHornberg comes next to Hausach and this is the town from where you will get the most promising view of Gutach valley. Even if you are not staying at Hornberg, it’s worthwhile to take a pause here and explore the hiking. Almost like Heidelberg, You can explore a dramatic view of Medieval bridge and the Black Forest railway itself. Also, the partial ruins of Hornberg castle (Which is the largest and oldest in this area) is also a marvelous sight at the valley. I have taken the below photo from this link.\n\nTriberg (Where we Stayed)\n\nTriberg is a perfect base to make your base in your journey exploring Black Forest. It has direct train connection with Offenburg. It serves direct bus to Titisee Neustadt. In the very town centre, you can find traditional costume and of course marvelous display of Mechanical Gigantic Cuckoo clock and the world famous cuckoo clock shop. You can taste authentic black forest cherry cake. Within few minutes of very easy hike, you can reach Germany’s highest waterfall. A little de-route hike and in Winter, you can experience a Frozen lake. If you are interested in Culture, Black Forest Museum is just around the corner.\n\nPeople say it’s crowded but at last weekend of January, we found it pretty empty. Cafe was empty, shops felt deserted, public transport looked more like private chartered. Hikings were not busy, no disturbance in slow shutter photography so I would disagree with people saying Triberg as crowded in Winter.\n\nBetween Gengenbach to Triberg, the train crosses multiple tunnels and when it comes out into light again, magic happens. Deep green meadow with scattered powder like snow and sight of old timber houses made the journey come to and end in a blink. With few other people, we got down at Triberg around 12PM. The host of our accommodation offered a free pick up from the train station. In 10-15minutes he arrived. Although the official check in time is from 2PM, as the apartment was empty he immediately allowed us to check in with no questions asked.\n\nDuring check in, the host gave us the Konus card. It’s not a real card but a kind of receipt of our stay duration with our names in it in a better quality yellow paper. Along with your passport, if you present this card to ticket checker then you are good to enjoy the benefit. Also, it gave us free entrance to Triberg Waterfalls and a discounted entrance to the Black Forest Museum. However, depending on how many nights you stay, the accommodation collects a city tax per person per night (2,5€) in exchange of this Konus card. You have to pay this to your hotel in cash during check in.\n\nOur host Toby was a really nice guy. From station, it was less than 5 minutes drive but he showed us where to eat Black Forest cake, which way the hike to Waterfalls is, the bus stop and the supermarket and souvenir shops. He even explained how to use public transport (That means which Bus and Train for which destination) network to travel to places throughout the Black Forest. The best part is he also explained in which sense Schonach is better than Triberg. (Put Konus card photo there)\n\nTriberg Waterfalls\n\nThis is the highest accessible waterfalls (Not the highest waterfalls) in Germany and because of its presence, Triberg means a continuous soft sound of rushing water. Of course, you can’t feel it within the town but once you come closer to nature, you will fell the call to explore more. After all, it’s an overall drop of 163 meters with 7 cascades with series of waterfalls. We expected a Frozen waterfalls before our arrival but Toby said (and we witnessed) that it snowed very little that year.\n\nFrom the parking, it’s a little uphill and there are three paid entrances to it. However, with Konus card, it’s free. The path is completely paved so with pram you can easily reach the base of it from where you will get absolutely gorgeous view. Because of snow in Winter, anyway you won’t be able to hike much. Otherwise the hiking trails to much height are not stroller friendly. Anyway, there is a beautiful bridge and viewing platform to enjoy the length of the waterfall in full glory. Although it can be explored in less than 20minutes, to feel its depth, at least 1 hour is necessary for visiting this waterfalls.\n\nMany people say that it’s a tourist trap. Well, you have Google these days. You know what to expect. From this official link, you know how much to pay if you don’t have the Konus card. If you are bound to European Summer school Holidays, then you know crowds will be there. If you still decide to go and end up complaining then I would say it’s your improper planning that makes an experience bitter. Nature here chooses to speak to those who listen. Don’t come with a rush. Spend some time walking paths less traveled and soon the dance of the flowing water through the mysterious forest will start looking more appealing.\n\nPlease Read This Section Due to snowfall, some paths became too slippery to hike. The authorities have put some fence with clear instructions that crossing this fence is strictly forbidden due to dangerous road condition ahead. Still, we saw people crossing the fence and hiked upwards ignoring the warning. To be honest, do you need a Rule or forcing a fine to tell you that crossing the boundary is risking your own precious life? I think all you need is little sense.\n\nBlack Forest Museum\n\nLocated at the very centre of Triberg (Just outside one Exit of the Waterfalls) is the Black Forest Musuem, locally known as Schwarzwald-Museum. The museum mainly tells you about the life of Black Forest years ago. It also showcases its traditional culture of craftmanship and of course display and explanation of working of world famous cuckoo clock. Another major attraction of this museum is understanding the history of Black Forest railway lines. You can recall the ceremonies held at the Triberg railway station through paintings, photographs, tickets and congratulation telegrams here.\n\nBurgsee\n\nTo be honest, we are nature persons and not that much into museums. I stayed in Amsterdam for two years but haven’t visited a single museum. So, we quickly shifted our focus to a nearby lake suggested by Toby as a secluded lake in this region. Although it was possible to take a bus to ride a single stop but due to nice weather, we preferred walking.\n\nThe lake was frozen. There is a small park nearby and some parts are not even fenced so if you wish, you can take a walk (Of course check the ice thickness as you step onto it) on top of the lake. It was fun to watch the swans actually slipped while jumping to the lake from the land. It’s a pretty small lake and strolling along leisurely is a peaceful experience. Plus as Toby mentioned, practically there was only two more people other than us.\n\nThe model boat in front of the lake and the colorful houses surrounding it definitely add a vibes to this place. Although, we never heard of this place in any travel blog of Triberg, we could confidently say we liked Burgsee lake even more than our visit to Titisee lake the next day.\n\nHouse of 1000 Clocks\n\nAt the very centre of Triberg, very nearby to the entrance to Triberg’s Waterfalls, you can spot the clock store with the animated Bear Family mounted on the storefront. As you step in, you can immediately recognize their excellence by the greeting of a gentleman made out of wood. It’s a huge 2-storey store having probably the largest selection of Black Forest cuckoo clocks. Not only clocks, you can explore various other souvenirs. However, if your budget is low, this shop still has something for you but I would insist you to visit shops at Titisee. You can visit their online store here.\n\nTips Before You Buy\n\nIf you are looking for authentic German handmade Cuckoo clock, the two basic things you have to keep in mind. Firstly, it’s costly and secondly you need to regularly wound in order for the clock to continue operating. Authentic cuckoo clocks are always mechanical (1-day or 8-day cycle). Battery operated (Quartz) clocks are more fancy, much more cheap, many more animations but one thing you must understand is that they are not authentic cuckoo clock. In most cases, no cuckoo comes out at every hour for Quartz clocks. I found the sound much better in mechanical ones (Because of the Wood I think). However as I am not an expert, you can refer this article which could answer probably all your questions.\n\nDo You Know? There are different types of Cuckoo clock. Depending on type of wood used, type of moving elements, the scene it portrays, Cuckoo clocks can be of multiple dimensions. It's a fantastic piece of art you can display on your wall back home. My personal favorite is the Chalet style cuckoo clock which features traditional German timber Alpine house.\n\nIf you are after a comparatively cheap quartz variation with cuckoo movement, soothing sound and lots of action, I would say refrain buying from this authentic shop and head to Titisee Neustadt. There are many cuckoo clock shops there who has lots of customized version on top of the authentic mechanics.\n\nCafe Adler\n\nVisiting Black Forest without tasting a piece of it would leave your soul unfulfilled especially if you are a sweet-tooth. So, if you want to avoid such karma and don’t want a re-birth because of this sin, having a Black Forest Cherry Cake at the afternoon is a must. Hotel Cafe Adler Triberg im Schwarzwald, as you can understand from its name is a hotel cum restaurant at the very heart of Triberg city centre. It’s pretty close to the Bus stop of Triberg and at a little distance in the opposite side of House of thousand clocks. Along with regular indoor searing, it also offers a terrace.\n\nToby mentioned that if we are after authentic a slice of Black Forest cake, Cafe Adler is the place. We ordered a Black Forest cake, a truffle cake and coffee. The ordering system I found a little odd. We had to place the order at the sales counter (No payment) then sit anywhere. After serving, we enjoyed but none came for payment. When it’s long enough, we got up to pay at the sales counter then they instructed us to sit and wait. Then immediately someone cleared our table and produced the bill.\n\nIf I really be honest, Black Forest Cherry cake at Cafe Adler is the worst cake we had till date. We don’t know if it is because we don’t drink or the specific slice was horrible or it is always like this and the ones we eat in India are not authentic. But we lost interest to try Black Forest cake in Black Forest. Coffee and the Truffle cake were good but I would place Italy at much higher rank in terms of quality.\n\nWe spent around 23 hours in Triberg and if you ask me, it’s sufficient time to explore this cute town of Triberg even in Winter. In summer, probably you would need less time because of long daylight. However, if you are travelling by public transport, don’t carry your luggage along. Hiking would be challenging with rucksack and impossible with trolley.\n\nSchonach\n\nWe had a misconception that the World’s largest cuckoo clock is at Triberg. But Toby clarified that it’s actually at Schonach which is around 2.5KM from Triberg. The exact location for Google Map is Eble-Uhren park. Since 1997, it holds the recordfor displaying World’s largest cuckoo clock. The Cuckoo in Schonach chimes twice an hour. Each time, the call comes from pipes 13 feet long. The clock is so big that you can come inside the clock for a tour on its operation and . You can visit their official website here.\n\nEble-Uhren is a cuckoo clock theme park features one timepiece big enough to walk inside. Every 30 minutes the clock comes to life and you can enjoy the show, so plan to visit on the hour or half hour. Tours are offered in English, German, French, Dutch, Italian and Spanish. Entrance fee is 2 Euro, children under 10 years are free.\n\nOpening hours: Easter to October from Monday to Saturday 9.00 to 18.00 and Sundays from 10.00 to 18.00 November to Easter from Monday to Saturday 9.00 to 17.30 and Sundays 11.00 to 17.00\n\nRome was Not Built in A Day It took hardwork of 5 years and 4 hands to reach this glory. Following centuries old blueprint, local clockmakers Ewald and Ralf Eble showcased their mastery of the craft in the creation of this massive cuckoo clock. Today the clock is 15 feet tall and weighs 5440 KG. The cuckoo itself is 150KG and the swinging pendulum is 26 feet long.\n\nThe above photo was not clicked by me.\n\nDonaueschingen\n\nFrom Triberg Railway station, you can board a regional train for a 30 minutes ride to Donaueschingen. Of course, it’s free with Konus card. Technically Donaueschingen is not part of Black Forest but you can consider it as a guardian. In my opinion, if you have arrived till Triberg, pleae do visit here to watch Donauquelle. What the hell is that? You may think. It’s the source of Danube. Goddamn it. The Great Danube which flows 1,700 miles through 10 countries all the way to the Black Sea can be found right here in this small town.\n\nThe above photo was not clicked by me. Donaueschingen is a pretty small town and Donauquelle is located right in the centre so there is no problem in recognising it. There is nothing much else to see but as the train station is nearby, you can directly go to the big boy of Black Forest, the Titisee Lake.\n\nTitisee Lake\n\nFrom Donaueschingen, it’s a 40 minutes train ride to Neustadt(Schwarzw) from where the lake Titisee is walkable. If you skip Donaueschingen and want to come to Titisee directly from Triberg/Schonach, there is a panorama bus which operates at a 2 hour frequency on Weekends. The bus ride is scenic beyond description but I have a complaint that they don’t clean the glass windows well so you may not be able to capture fantastic photos. You will find two different bus numbers if you look for this route online and you may think that you need to change a bus. But, the same bus first changes its number halfway after a halt.\n\nYou can take a look at the above timetable which we found in Triberg Bus stop. However, these can always change so if you are reading this article after January 2021, please get up to date from DB website. Otherwise you can get in touch with your accommodation owner.\n\nDon't Get Confused Titisee Bahnhof is the place where you should get down. No matter if you come by Bus or train, your main idea of coming here is to visit the lake. The lake is less than 10minute downhill walk from the train station/bus stop. If you put Titisee-Neustadt on Google Map, you will be shown somewhere else. So put Titisee Bahnhof and it will show you Titisee Bahnhof, Titisee-Neustadt together. This is the correct place.\n\nIf you have ever heard the story of the Little Mermaid Ariel or have seen the Disney Classic film, chances are the plot was right here in lake Titisee. People believe that long ago a young man from Freiburg wandered through the original mysterious Black Forest when a scary storm approached. He was completely lost by the storm and blown away to a mountain lake – the Titisee. Then a mermaid Titi saved him and of course they fell in love… You can read the full story here.\n\nWhen there is a mermaid, there is fantasy. Before coming to Titisee, we had a pretty low expectation but Titisee welcomed us with pure poetry. It’s so colorful, so vibrant and so dynamic that we immediately realised it would have been a blunder if we didn’t come here. Titisee is the place where we had the best Gelato outside Italy. It’s here we bought traditional Bollenhut (ladies’ hat topped with pom-poms). In Titisee, you would find wide range of customized but hand-made Cuckoo clocks at reasonable price. Your choice of souvenir will be so much that it will confuse you what not to take.\n\nCollect Tourist Tax Refund Form If you are a Tourist from outside EU and travelling in Tourist Visa and if you have purchased a Cuckoo Clock, along with the receipt, the shopkeeper will provide you a tax refund form which you can produce at the airport before immigration to collect back the amount you paid as tax for this purchase.\n\nDon’t ever think that Titisee is only about the lake. Undoubtedly, the lake is pretty awesome. With dark green pine forest at the background and basking in the touch of soft sunlight, lake Titisee is surely a picturesque destination. However, its beauty lies in its vibrance. It’s a charming and bustling town full of shops, places to eat and activities. In Winter the lake is frozen completely. It’s still possible to ice skate on the frozen lake but we found there were not many enthusiast. But in other seasons, You can take a boat ride on the lake on a cruise ship or you can rent a rowboat, a paddleboat or an electrical boat.\n\nReserve some time exploring the shops near Titisee. You will find stuffs which cannot be found anywhere in the World. There is an year round Christmas store for Santa lovers from where you can send postcards. Titisee is a great place to have your lunch. From here you can take a direct and scenic train to the capital of Black Forest, Freiburg im Breisgau or go to captivating Ravenna Gorge.\n\nRavenna Gorge\n\nYou might have seen a picture of an arched railway in a snowy settings. That’s Ravenna Gorge. It is a narrow side valley of the Hell Valley, through which the stream Ravenna flows and draws a hiking trail. In summer, people rush here to avoid the intense heat of Freiburg. In Winter, there is a Christmas market (First and Only) located in a gorge, right under the railway track. However if you are here after Christmas then visiting this place is probably not a good idea. Also come here if you are in a tight schedule. Use DB website to plan your journey. From Titisee, it takes around 40 minutes and from Freibug, it takes 1 hour 20 minutes. However in neither case, the journey is direct. You need to change from Train to Bus and then continue.\n\nThe above photo was not clicked by me.\n\nFreiburg im Breisgau (Capital of Black Forest)\n\nThis is probably the most popular place to stay in the Black Forest region. Although technically it falls at the border, it’s a town full of Gothic architecture and colorful as well as heritage buildings combined with modern shopping street. From Titisee Bahnhof, it’s a 40 minutes direct train ride and the journey was super scenic. Actually all train/bus journeys of Black Forest are equally beautiful. You just need to shift your gaze from your mobile to the window.\n\nFreiburg Münster\n\nFreiburg Münster (Some call it Minster) is undoubtedly the most striking churches in the Black Forest and a prominent landmark of the city of Freiburg. Its construction took more than 300 years but the result speaks. It’s open every day from 10:00 to 17:00 and free to enter. You can read more about it from the official website. The exterior is grand and tall but you will be stunned once you step inside. The stained glass windows bear glamorous and historical artwork which in my personal opinion are better than the finishing of Belgian glasswork we saw in Ghent.\n\nMartinstor (Martin Gate)\n\nSchwabentor and Martinstor are Freiburg’s two remaining medieval city gates (there were once five in total). Although these two have survived many wars, nowadays many locals view them as obstacles to the development of a modern transportation system. While it’s useless to comment as an outsider if transportation is actually hampered or not, till the time the ancient history is preserved, as a tourist, Freiburg looks different. All of you have seen the American fast food giant McDonalds but how many of you have seen a McDonalds like this?\n\nI waited to take a picture when a tram passes through this gate. The colorful tram combined with the heritage building is a perfect fusion of the young and the veteran.\n\nOld Town Area and Shopping Street\n\nYou will be pleasantly surprised by many open streams flowing through the streets with crystal clear water. Legend has it that if you touch your feet in one such stream, you are bound to marry a local (oops!)\n\nThe square encircling the cathedral of Freiburg is a must-see visiting the old city. The main attraction here is the market (Both open air and lined up international shops). The houses are astonishingly colorful and buildings are marvelous to look at.\n\nFreiburg is famous for Market but don’t get confused with the shops of Triberg or Titisee. Those stores sell authentic Black Forest souvenirs but here at Freiburg, you will find mostly international and renowned brands in behind modern glass doors. However, one important thing to note is on Sunday, all these shops are shut. There is no open air market on Sunday too (At least in January)\n\nBasel (Switzerland)\n\nWe chose Basel Euroairport as our exit point from Black Forest to the Netherlands. Flight fare was about 23€ per person in Easyjet and we booked around 2 months before. There were two days to reach Basel from Freiburg. If you have to catch flight and do not have time or interest or both to explore Basel, you can catch direct bus from Freiburg im Bresigau to Basel Euro-Airport. We chose this option and booked a ticket via Flixbus. At the bus terminal, there are dedicated platforms for buses running all the way to EuroAirport. Our bus was sharp on time and we reached airport on time. If I remember correctly, only a total of 8 passengers traveled that day.\n\nIf you have some time and interest to explore the cute Swiss town Basel, then you can catch train from Freiburg. The main train station is named Basel SBB but if you catch direct train from Freiburg to Basel SBB then you cannot use Konus card as it’s an ICE train. To use Konus, you need to catch local train to Basel Bad Bf. Your Konus validity ends here. A famous landmark of Basel is the middle bridge which is almost equal walking distance from Basel SBB and Basel Bad Bf.\n\nOnce you reach Basel, it’s upto you to decide your mode of transport. If you stay one night here, you will get a Basel Card from your hotel which again will make all your transport in Basel free. Otherwise, it’s a small city so it’s possible to walk around. But in case you need to pay to use transport, remember you are in Switzerland so nothing is cheap. I personally felt very little difference between Freiburg im Breisgau and Basel so we skipped visiting Basel. If you are intersted, some key point of interests are Spalentor City Gate, Andreasplatz, Basel Minster, Kunstmuseum Museum and of course walkin along the Rhine river.\n\nI have take the above photo from this link. It’s a wonderful experience to walk across different sides of the Basel Euro airport. The same key ring you can see in France side selling at a much cheaper rate than the Swiss side.\n\nTips For Buying Cuckoo Clock\n\nIf you follow along, I have given an useful link is the House of 1000 clock section of Triberg. But based on my findings and experience, here are some important tips for you\n\nYou can find Cuckoo Clocks all over the world but to preserve the art, integrity and standards of fine cuckoo clock making, Vds (Verein die Schwarzwalduhr) is introduced as a standard certificate of Authenticity. So if you are after an authentic traditional Black Forest made Cuckoo clock, check for Vds.\n\nThe moment you choose to buy a Quartz clock, Vds does no longer exist because they do not qualify for certification.\n\nQuartz clocks are fancy, sometimes for beautiful to look at, offer you many more actions in much attractive price but they are NOT Traditional.\n\nThere are numerous varieties in the design but they are broadly categorized in two major designs – Carved and Chalet. The carved one represent nature and wildlife and the chalet ones represent traditional house with people and pets.\n\nThere are some more like Railroad, Modern, Shield, Vintage design but again those are sub category of above two.\n\nMechanical movements come with 1-Day or 8-Days cycle. 1-Day cycle is much cheaper.\n\nYou can decide on Music. Many a times they use Swiss made music box. Although its a foreign part but dramatically enhances the experience.\n\nYou can customize animations. Although the fundamental one being the cuckoo coming out of its hiding so sing for you, you can top up with motions of wood cutters, bell ringers, or a even a lover’s kiss as dancers take the stage.\n\nBefore leaving the shop, learn how to set it up. It’s not your regular wall clock.\n\nAs I mentioned above, remember to collect Tax Refund certificate from your Seller if you are travelling to Black Forest as a Tourist. You will get a hefty amount back at your point of departure.\n\nUnique Buy From Black Forest\n\nI would urge you to please buy a Bollenhut. The Bollenhut is a ladies’ hat topped with pom-poms and has been part of the traditional costume worn by women in the Black Forest. Young unmarried girls wear hats with red pompoms and married women hats with black ones (Although I bought a red one to my wife but who cares 😉 ).\n\nThe second most beautiful piece of Black Forest tradition is Dirndls. It’s a traditional costume worn by Females. These Bavarian Folk Costume are still worn by locals on multiple occassion. You can check out a large collection at this website.\n\nOf course, Cuckoo Clock still stays at the top of what to buy at Germany. However, if you are not comfortable in wearing traditional costume or are not in a position to afford it, you can buy a doll wearing it. Locally known as Puppen doll, one of this will surely bring a charm in your showcase. Give photo of Annapurna wearing hat and the doll.\n\nUseful Money Savings Tips\n\nYou have arrived this site because you want to explore more in less (Time and Money). So, here are some insider tips for you from our personal experience\n\nChoose your accommodation at a region offering Konus Card. It reduces drastically the cost of transportation. Even if you chose to self drive, you can give it a rest for a day and explore surrounding areas in Train. The train rides are truly marvelous.\n\nAvoid Summer. It’s crowded. It’s super costly. It’s hotter than you think. Even I heard people complaining about not getting a parking spot.\n\nExplore but don’t buy Cuckoo clock at Triberg. Instead buy from Titisee. The same goes for any other souvenir/costume too. Everything in Titisee (Excluding Accommodation) is cheaper compared to rest of the Black Forest.\n\nIf you are using public transport try to plan on weekdays. On Weekends, the bus frequency is quite low but if it’s impossible to avoid weekends then also it’s managable but you have to plan very carefully.\n\nChoose Basel/Baden as point of entry/exit. Flight fares are damn cheap.\n\nBook the train from Airport to your place of accommodation as soon as you book your flight. If you book later, chances are that you will be paying much higher price.\n\nWhen I first heard about Black Forest, my impression was that in Northern India (State of Uttarakhand and Himachal), there are many such similar places so is it still worth visiting? Well, after visiting, I can say it is definitely worth it. It’s not because of the forest or the waterfalls or the lakes but because of the secluded houses by the woods. Those are the ones where the illustration from your childhood fairytale comes alive. If you have ever read Grimm brother’s fairy tale, Black Forest is a must destination for you. Questions?
