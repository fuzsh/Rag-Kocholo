        "text": "The Augustiner Museum is one of the most significant museums in the Upper Rhine region. It is home to a famous collection of art from the Middle Ages to the Baroque period and paintings from the 19th century, as well as being a Diocesan Museum of the Archdiocese of Freiburg.\n\nThe former monastery of the Augustine Hermits, complete with Gothic cloister, was extended and transformed into a stunning modern museum back in 2010. The historical part features statues, altars, paintings and small sculptures from the Baroque period alongside 19th-century artwork over some 1,400 square metres. And there's an organ from 1732 that is protected as a musical monument of historical and cultural significance.\n\nThe new exhibition hall in the basement features exhibits supplied by all of the individual Freiburg city museums and so covers a wide range of areas across 450 square metres. For example, visitors can expect to find original stone figures from Freiburg Minster in the hall of statues. The Graphic Art Collection has been home to the graphic art exhibits from the Augustiner Museum and the Museum of Modern Art since it opened in 2016. Amazingly, the 14th-century roof frameworks in the choir here and in the Minster are the oldest in Freiburg. Opening times: Tuesday to Sunday: 10 amâ€“5 pm"
