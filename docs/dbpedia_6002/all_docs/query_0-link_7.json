        "text": "HOLY WARRIORS AND BELLICOSE BISHOPS: THE CHURCH AND WARFARE IN EARLY MEDIEVAL GERMANY By Nicholas E. Friend The Frankish kingdoms of the early Middle Ages were the inheritors of both Germanic warrior culture and the Christian institutions of the late Roman Empire. Under Charlemagne, the Franks conquered most of Western Europe by the early ninth century and established a new empire of their own. To do so, they had to reconcile the Christian doctrine of peace with the necessity of killing the enemy during war. This was especially challenging for the highest ranks of the clergy. Though forbidden by canon law to commit violence, bishops and abbots were responsible for defending the property and people in their jurisdictions. The pious Carolingian kings endowed the Church with more property but required service of their land-holding prelates in exchange, which included providing troops for the royal army and, frequently, leading those troops themselves. By the time of the Ottonians (919-...\n\nAlthough the sources for urban culture in the early medieval West are much less abundant than they are for the period from c. 1100 ce onwards, it is nevertheless all but impossible to deal with all aspects of 'Civic Identity and Civic Participation in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages' for all of the West and for the whole of the period c. 500-c. 1100 ce in the scope of an article. An attempt can be made, however, to answer the following three questions: Is anything known about how early medieval town dwellers organized themselves? How did they see themselves as a group? And were there continuities in the ways late antique town dwellers and their early medieval successors saw themselves?\n\nA draft translation of a diploma issued by Henry III of Germany (r.1039-1056) confirming the monastery of San Zeno in Verona in its possession of the property which Margrave Boniface of Tuscany (d.1052) and his vassals unlawfully took from it. The diploma also granted San Zeno the castle of Montecchio, and the jurisdiction of twelve ‘arimanni’, which had been given to the monastery by Duke Welf III of Carinthia (d.1055). This was one of a series of documents issued by Henry III in 1055 which was intended to undermine the power of Boniface of Tuscany’s dynasty. Since Boniface had been assassinated in 1052, Henry III was primarily acting against Boniface’s widow, Beatrice of Tuscany, and their daughter Matilda of Tuscany.\n\nFifteenth century Germany was a place of strife where feudal ties were still useful for princes to keep control of his often widespread dominion and keep other interests out. The names of major vassals, castle guards (Burgmannen) and other fief-holders were noted in books of fiefs (Lehensbücher), which were regularly revised - usually simple entries for administrative use only. The present edition describes an unusual variant illustrated with 75 coats of arms and crested helmets made during the early years of the reign, 1464-78, of Matthias Ramung as Bishop of Speyer, and still in active use almost a century later. Ramung was an administrative reformer not only within his diocese, but also as chancellor of the County-Palatine (Kurpfalz) from 1461 until his death. The Speyer Lehensbuch was most likely the inspiration for the Pfalzer Lehensbuch made for the personal use of the Elector-Palatine Friedrich I ‘the Victorious’ von Wittelsbach-Bayern (1425-76)"
