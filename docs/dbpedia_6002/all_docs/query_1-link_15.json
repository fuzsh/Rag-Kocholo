It is an attractive and relaxed city with a high quality of life, for citizens and visitors alike.\n\nIf I ever had to move within Germany, Freiburg im Breisgau would be the place to go.\n\nMartinstor in Freiburg\n\nExcept for trams and bicycles, the city centre is free of traffic, it is one huge pedestrian mall. Take a leisurely stroll along the picturesque alleys which are paved with wonderful mosaics and lined by Freiburgs famous Bächle (small water channels).\n\nExplore impressive old buildings, first of all the famous Münster, the old and new town hall and the Hotel Zum Roten Bären - Freiburg is full of history.\n\nBut it is not only the history that makes Freiburg so attractive. 30,000 students in one of Germany's oldest and most reputable univesity add to the cities bustling but still relaxed lifestyle.\n\nHere is an overview of the topics on this page. Come and discover one of my favourite German cities with me, you won't regret it.\n\nRestaurants in Freiburg Germany\n\nMarkthalle & Martinsbräu Freiburg\n\nDine under huge trees\n\nYou can guess from the food section of the black forest main page that I really enjoy the local cuisine (badische Küche).

Whether you prefer wine or beer, you'll find your favourite place.\n\nWhat's my favourite place? This is hard to say. I like to sit in the small lane in front of Martinsbräu brewery, or wander through the Markthalle with the local & international food stalls. Any locality that offers traditional badische specialities is the right place for me. After all, I can have a pizza at home as well, so why travel to Freiburg for a pizza?\n\nMap of Freiburg Germany\n\nThis map covers roughly the city centre in Freiburg. You can zoom in and zoom out to see more details, or get an idea how big Freiburg is.\n\nOn my first visits to Freiburg I never realised that it is a fairly big city, because the city centre is such a cosy and relaxed place.\n\nHaus zum Walfisch\n\nNow don't you long to visit sunny Freiburg im Breisgau?\n\nUseful Visitor Information\n\nHow to get to Freiburg?\n\nBy Car\n\nFreiburg is conveniently located on the motorway A5 which goes from Frankfurt to Basel.\n\nBy Train\n\nTravelling to Freiburg by train is also very easy.
