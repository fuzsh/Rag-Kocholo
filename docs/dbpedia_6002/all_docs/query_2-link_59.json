        "text": "\"Create the virtual cockpit of tomorrow\":\n\nThe Start-up Challenge\n\nIn cooperation with The Drivery (co-working space provider) and Applied Data Incubator (support for start-ups), LITEF organised a Start-Up-Challenge for the first time. The Freiburg-based technology company was the main sponsor and initiator of the challenge, in which a virtual cockpit of the future was to be developed.\n\nHighest safety standards for Airbus Helicopters:\n\nThe LCR-350B Attitude and Heading Reference System from LITEF\n\nThe open sea is notorious for the rough winds that blow across its waters. Safely manoeuvring a helicopter under such harsh conditions requires sure instinct and years of experience from the pilots. This becomes necessary, for example, when offshore wind farms have to be maintained on the high seas or employees have to be transported to or from their workplace on oil platforms. But apart from the pilots' flying skills, there is another thing that is crucial: the right technology behind everything. It is worth taking a closer look at the interior of the helicopters.\n\nNASTT 2022 NO-DIG SHOW ATTENDANCE - PRESENTATION NOW AVAILABLE\n\nFreiburg, April 2022 | Our colleague Tom Fuerst of the Industrial Solution unit had the opportunity to introduce the LiPAD-100 to the audience at the NASTT 2022 No-Dig Show, which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from 10 to 14 April. He demonstrated how the LiPAD-100 supports our customers' projects and discussed numerous applications of the LiPAD-100 in a wide variety of construction projects. For those who did not have the opportunity to attend this great conference, we are posting the presentation here.\n\nIt's never been so easy! LITEF LiPAD®-100 for high-precision measurement and alignment tasks\n\nFreiburg, September 2021 | With the LiPAD®-100, the Freiburg-based technology company LITEF presents a portable system for high-precision measurement and alignment tasks at MinExpo in Las Vegas and Intergeo in Hanover, and simultaneously online.\n\nIt's never been so easy! More languages and new “Mine Grid” feature for the LITEF LiPAD®-100 app\n\nFreiburg, September 2021 | The LiPAD® app, which is used when using the LiPAD®-100 system for high-precision measurement and alignment tasks, has received an update. This makes is it possible for every user to configure drills even more easily."
