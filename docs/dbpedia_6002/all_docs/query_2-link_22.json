K.; Chofor, N.\n\nPurpose: The dosimetric properties of the OCTAVIUS Detector 1500 (OD1500) ionization chamber array (PTW-Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany) have been investigated. A comparative study was carried out with the OCTAVIUS Detector 729 and OCTAVIUS Detector 1000 SRS arrays. Methods: The OD1500 array is an air vented ionization chamber array with 1405 detectors in a 27 Ã 27 cm{sup 2} measurement area arranged in a checkerboard pattern with a chamber-to-chamber distance of 10 mm in each row. A sampling step width of 5 mm can be achieved by merging two measurements shifted by 5 mm, thus fulfilling the Nyquist theorem for intensity modulatedmoreÂ Â» dose distributions. The stability, linearity, and dose per pulse dependence were investigated using a Semiflex 31013 chamber (PTW-Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany) as a reference detector. The effective depth of measurement was determined by measuring TPR curves with the array and a Roos chamber type 31004 (PTW-Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany). Comparative output factor measurements were performed with the array, the Semiflex 31010 ionization chamber and the Diode 60012 (both PTW-Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany). The energy dependence of the OD1500 was measured by comparing the arrayâs readings to those of a Semiflex 31010 ionization chamber for varying mean photon energies at the depth of measurement, applying to the Semiflex chamber readings the correction factor k{sub NR} for nonreference conditions. The Gaussian lateral dose response function of a single array detector was determined by searching the convolution kernel suitable to convert the slit beam profiles measured with a Diode 60012 into those measured with the arrayâs central chamber. An intensity modulated dose distribution measured with the array was verified by comparing a OD1500 measurement to TPS calculations and film measurements. Results: The stability and interchamber sensitivity variation of the OD1500 array were within Â±0.2% and Â±0.58%, respectively. Dose linearity was\n\nActive tectonics of the southeastern Upper Rhine Graben, Freiburg area (Germany)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNiviÃ¨re, B.; Bruestle, A.; Bertrand, G.; Carretier, S.; Behrmann, J.; Gourry, J.-C.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThe Upper Rhine Graben has two Plio-Quaternary depocentres usually interpreted as resulting from tectonic reactivation. The southern basin, near Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), contains up to 250 m of sediments. Beneath the younger alluvial deposits related to the current drainage system, a former river network deeply entrenched in the substratum reveals a very low regional base level of early Pleistocene age. The offset of channels at faults allows us to infer a Pleistocene reactivation of the syn-rift fault pattern and the estimation of slip rates. Maximum vertical movements along the faults have not exceeded 0.1 mm/yr since the middle Pleistocene. Current activity is concentrated along the westernmost faults. Morphologic markers indicate late Pleistocene reactivation of the Rhine River fault, and geophysical prospecting suggests a near-surface offset of young sedimentary deposits. The size of the fault segments potentially reactivated suggests that earthquakes with magnitude larger than Mw=6.3 could be expected in the area with a return interval of about 8000 years. Extrapolated to the duration of the Plio-Pleistocene, the strain rate estimates reveal that the tectonic forcing may account for only one-third to one-half of the whole thickness of the Plio-Pleistocene sediments of the basin fill. Thus other processes must be invoked to understand the growth of the Plio-Pleistocene basin. Especially the piracy of the Rhine River to the north during the early Pleistocene could explain these effects.\n\nVariations of traffic related air pollution on different time scales in Szeged, Hungary and Freiburg, Germany\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMakra, LÃ¡szlÃ³; Mayer, Helmut; Mika, JÃ¡nos; SÃ¡nta, TamÃ¡s; Holst, Jutta\n\nEconomic activities and everyday life may create weekly variations in concentrations of air pollutants in urban settings. The present study contributes to this experience on the example of two typical medium-sized towns in Central Europe, Szeged and Freiburg considering the following air pollutants: NO, NO 2, O 3, O x and PM 10. Five-year data sets of hourly observations (1997-2001) collected in downtown traffic junctions are analysed. In addition, the effect of the weekly variation on the diurnal course of the air pollutants is also demonstrated, which is especially important when we consider the possible extremes of these traffic related air pollutants. Since the annual variation of the pollutants explains only a minor part of the total variance and, furthermore, the weekly variation behaves rather similarly in the different seasons, the weekly variation of the diurnal peaks is quantified for the whole year. The average annual variations of NO, NO 2, O 3 and O x are very similar for both Szeged and Freiburg. Annual levels of NO 2 and O 3 are moderately higher, while those of PM 10 are extremely higher in Szeged, which is reflected in their average weekly and diurnal variations, too. In Freiburg the diurnal variation of PM 10 shows a clear daily course with only one wave, compared to that for Szeged with the shape of a double wave. In Szeged, highest percentile values of NO and NO 2 occur mostly in the evening, while in Freiburg either in the mourning or in the evening and generally there is very little difference between them. In Szeged, maximum of O 3 peak values, while in Freiburg minimum of them are found on weekends.\n\nInnovative Plasma Disinfection Technique with the Reduced-pH Method and the Plasma-Treated Water (PTW) -Safety and Powerful Disinfection with Cryopreserved PTW-\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKitano, Katsuhisa; Ikawa, Satoshi; Nakashima, Yoichi; Tani, Atsushi; Yokoyama, Takashi; Ohshima, Tomoko\n\n2015-09-01\n\nAmong the applications of the plasma disinfection to human body, plasma sterilization in liquid is crucial. We found that the plasma-treated water (PTW) has strong bactericidal activity under low pH condition and the half-lives of its activity depend on temperature. Lower temperature brings longer half-life and the bactericidal activity of PTW can be kept by cryopreservation. These physicochemical properties were in accordance with Arrhenius equation both in liquid and solid states. From the experimental results of ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) measurement of O2-in liquid against PTW with spin trapping method, half-lives of PTW were also in accordance with Arrhenius equation. It suggests that high concentration PTW as integrated value can be achieved by cooling of plasma apparatus. Pure PTW has disinfection power of 22 log reduction (B. subtilis). This corresponds to 65% H2O2, 14% hypochlorous acid and 0.33% peracetic acid, which are deadly poison for human. On the other hand, PTW is deactivated soon at body temperature. This indicates that toxicity to human body seems to be low. PTW, which is a sort of indirect plasma exposure, with pH and temperature controls could be applied for safety and powerful disinfection.

K.\n\n2013-08-15\n\nPurpose: In this work, the properties of the two-dimensional liquid filled ionization chamber array Octavius 1000SRS (PTW-Freiburg, Germany) for use in clinical photon-beam dosimetry are investigated.Methods: Measurements were carried out at an Elekta Synergy and Siemens Primus accelerator. For measurements of stability, linearity, and saturation effects of the 1000SRS array a Semiflex 31013 ionization chamber (PTW-Freiburg, Germany) was used as a reference. The effective point of measurement was determined by TPR measurements of the array in comparison with a Roos chamber (type 31004, PTW-Freiburg, Germany). The response of the array with varying field size and depth of measurement was evaluatedmoreÂ Â» using a Semiflex 31010 ionization chamber as a reference. Output factor measurements were carried out with a Semiflex 31010 ionization chamber, a diode (type 60012, PTW-Freiburg, Germany), and the detector array under investigation. The dose response function for a single detector of the array was determined by measuring 1 cm wide slit-beam dose profiles and comparing them against diode-measured profiles. Theoretical aspects of the low pass properties and of the sampling frequency of the detector array were evaluated. Dose profiles measured with the array and the diode detector were compared, and an intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) field was verified using the Gamma-Index method and the visualization of line dose profiles.Results: The array showed a short and long term stability better than 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. Fluctuations in linearity were found to be within Â±0.2% for the vendor specified dose range. Saturation effects were found to be similar to those reported in other studies for liquid-filled ionization chambers. The detector's relative response varied with field size and depth of measurement, showing a small energy dependence accounting for maximum signal deviations of Â±2.6% from the reference condition for the setup used.

A detailed description of the implant curriculum at Albert-Ludwigs University is given with documented exemplary cases and additional flow charts. All students participate in 28 hours of lectures and approximately 64 hours of seminars with hands-on courses and gain clinical experience. All undergraduate students are eligible to place and restore oral implants. Emphasis is placed on prosthetic-driven planning of implant positions, three-dimensional imaging, and computer-guided implant placement. Implant restorations performed by undergraduate students comprise single crowns and small multiunit fixed dental prostheses in partially edentulous posterior maxillae and anterior or posterior mandibles, implant-retained overdentures (snap attachment) in edentulous patients, and telescopic fixed-removable dental prostheses on remaining teeth and strategically placed additional implants. Over the past 2.5 years, 51 patients were treated with 97 dental implants placed by students in the undergraduate program. Seventy-one restorations were inserted: 60.6% single crowns, 7% fixed dental protheses, 21.1% overdentures, and 11.3% telescopic fixed-removable dental prostheses. The implant survival rate was 98.9%. Because survival rates for dental implants placed and restored by students are comparable to those of experienced dentists, oral implant dentistry should be implemented as part of the undergraduate dental curriculum.\n\n[Psychological Care for a High Risk Group of Refugees - Concept of Care for the Yazidi Women and Children of the Sonderkontingent Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in Freiburg].\n\nPubMed\n\nHillebrecht, Jennifer; Helmes, Almut; Bengel, JÃ¼rgen\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAfter the genocide of Shingal in August 2014 in Northern Iraq, the humanitarian admissions program Sonderkontingent Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg \"SchutzbedÃ¼rftiger Frauen und Kinder aus dem Nordirak\" was implemented. 1100 persons, most of them Yazidis, were hosted by different municipalities in Germany. The target group is a particularly vulnerable group of persons with a high risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder. We present the concept of care in Freiburg for 205 Yazidi women and children in Freiburg. A stepped-care approach was developed for the psychological care to introduce the Yazidi people to the daily life and to the health care system in Germany. An outreach of psychological services and an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary cooperation of all services involved were crucial.

This experimental work adds to the knowledge available on the microclimate of an urban canyon and its impact on human comfort. Air temperature T a , air humidity VP, wind speed v and direction dd were measured continuously. All short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes from the 3D surroundings were also measured. The degree of comfort was defined in terms of physiologically equivalent temperature (PET). Furthermore, the data gathered within the canyon were compared to data collected by a permanent urban climate station with the aim of furthering the understanding of microclimatic changes due to street geometry. Changes in the meteorological variables T a , v and dd in the canyon in comparison to an unobstructed roof level location were found to be in good agreement with previous studies, i.e., a small increase of T a in the canyon adjacent to irradiated surfaces, and a good correlation of v and dd between canyon and roof levels. The daily dynamics of canyon facet irradiances and their impacts on the heat gained by a pedestrian were strongly dependent on street geometry and orientation. Thermal stress was mostly attributable to solar exposure. Under cloudless summer weather, a standing body was found to absorb, on average, 74% of heat in the form of long-wave irradiance and 26% as short-wave irradiance. Shading the pedestrian as well as the surrounding surfaces is, hence, the first strategy in mitigating heat stress in summer under hot conditions.\n\nDetermination of the active volumes of solid-state photon-beam dosimetry detectors using the PTB proton microbeam.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoppinga, Daniela; Delfs, Bjoern; Meyners, Jutta; Langner, Frank; Giesen, Ulrich; Harder, Dietrich; Poppe, Bjoern; Looe, Hui K\n\n2018-05-04\n\nThis study aims at the experimental determination of the diameters and thicknesses of the active volumes of solid-state photon-beam detectors for clinical dosimetry. The 10Â MeV proton microbeam of the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig) was used to examine two synthetic diamond detectors, type microDiamond (PTW Freiburg, Germany), and the silicon detectors Diode E (PTW Freiburg, Germany) and Razor Diode (Iba Dosimetry, Germany). The knowledge of the dimensions of their active volumes is essential for their Monte Carlo simulation and their applications in small-field photon-beam dosimetry. The diameter of the active detector volume was determined from the detector current profile recorded by radially scanning the proton microbeam across the detector. The thickness of the active detector volume was determined from the detector's electrical current, the number of protons incident per time interval and their mean stopping power in the active volume. The mean energy of the protons entering this volume was assessed by comparing the measured and the simulated influence of the thickness of a stack of aluminum preabsorber foils on the detector signal. For all detector types investigated, the diameters measured for the active volume closely agreed with the manufacturers' data. For the silicon Diode E detector, the thickness determined for the active volume agreed with the manufacturer's data, while for the microDiamond detectors and the Razor Diode, the thicknesses measured slightly exceeded those stated by the manufacturers. The PTB microbeam facility was used to analyze the diameters and thicknesses of the active volumes of photon dosimetry detectors for the first time. A new method of determining the thickness values with an uncertainty of Â±10% was applied. The results appear useful for further consolidating detailed geometrical knowledge of the solid-state detectors investigated, which are used in clinical small-field photon-beam dosimetry.

C.; Carretier, S.; Fracassi, U.; Winter, T.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nThe Upper Rhine Graben (URG) is a NNE-trending continental rift that was mostly active from Upper Eocene to Lower Miocene. However, the relatively well-preserved topography of its shoulders, at the scale of the whole basin, suggests a Pleistocene reactivation of its borders. We evaluate here such a possibility along its SE border, in the vincinity of Freiburg (Germany). Despite a continuous but diffuse seismic activity, evidences of near-surface deformations are not yet described. We coupled at the regional and local scales a multi-disciplinary approach, including morphological and geological analyses, to identify the markers of an assumed Pleistocene deformation. The imagery analysis reveals that the Oligocene structural pattern is yet well-marked in the topography by continuous escarpments, few tenth of kilometers long and from 20--30 to 300--500 m high. The correlation of boreholes allowed us to build isohypse and isopach maps of the Quaternary deposits and to propose a river system evolution scenario for the Quaternary. More interesting are the local depocenters located above the hanging wall of the faults and suggesting a Pleistocene tectonic reactivation. Thus, a minimum Pleistocene vertical offset of about 30 m can be illustrated above the main border fault. We then focused on the western Rhine river fault where very young deposits are suspected to have recorded a wechselian deformation. The morphological aspect of the scarp (location above the structural fault, linearity and continuity of the scarp, topographic tilting and presence of hanging valleys...), borehole data and electric tomography survey realized across the scarplet, located at toe of the main scarp, testify of a possible deformation. In particular, a Ë15 m vertical offset of the Wechselian deposits is illustrated in two localities, along the fault, where trenching will be performed in a near future to validate the ages of deformed deposits and obtain information on the strain scenario.\n\n[The Freiburg monosyllable word test in postoperative cochlear implant diagnostics].\n\nPubMed\n\nHey, M; Brademann, G; Ambrosch, P\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe Freiburg monosyllable word test representsÂ a central tool of postoperative cochlear implant (CI) diagnostics. The objective of this study is to test the equivalence of different word lists by analysing word comprehension. For patients whose CI has been implanted for more than 5Â years, the distribution of suprathreshold speech intelligibility outcomes will also be analysed. InÂ a retrospective data analysis, speech understanding for 626 CI users word correct scores were evaluated using a total of 5211 lists with 20Â words each. The analysis of word comprehension within each list shows differences in mean and in the kind of distribution function. There are lists which showÂ a significant difference of their mean word recognition to the overall mean. The Freiburg monosyllable word test is easy to administer at suprathreshold speech level for CI recipients, and typically hasÂ a saturation level above 80â%. The Freiburg monosyllable word test can be performed successfully by the majority of CI patients. The limited balance of the test lists elicits the conclusion that an adaptive test procedure with the Freiburg monosyllable test does not make sense. The Freiburg monosyllable test can be restructured by resorting all words across lists, or by omitting individual words ofÂ a test list to increase the reliability of the test. The results show that speech intelligibility in quiet should also be investigated in CI recipients al levels below 70Â dB.\n\nAnalytic EoS and PTW strength model recommendation for Starck Ta\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSjue, Sky K.; Prime, Michael B.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide an analytic EoS and PTW strength model for Starck Ta that can be consistently used between different platforms and simulations at three labs. This should provide a consistent basis for comparison of the results of calculations, but not the best implementation for matching a wide variety of experimental data. Another version using SESAME tables should follow, which will provide a better physical representation over a broader range of conditions. The data sets available at the time only include one Hopkinson bar at a strain rate of 1800/s; a broader range of high-ratemoreÂ Â» calibration data would be preferred. The resulting fit gives the PTW parameter p = 0. To avoid numerical issues, p = 0:001 has been used in FLAG. The PTW parameters that apply above the maximum strain rate in the data use the values from the original publication.Â«Â less\n\nSU-E-T-81: A Study On Correlation Between Gamma Analysis for Midline and Lateralized Tumors Using VMAT\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKumar, Syam; Anjana\n\nPurpose: To evaluate the fluence for the midline and lateralized tumors for VMAT technique using 2D seven29 detector array combined with the Octavius phantom. Methods: 60 cases that are already being treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) have selected for this study. This includes tumors situated at the medial and lateral. Medial refers to the tumor situated at the midline of the body and lateral means toward the side or away from the midline of the body. Verification plans were created for each treatment plan in Varian Eclipse treatment planning system (version10, Varian medical systems, Palo Alto,CA) with themoreÂ Â» 2D Seven29 detector array and the Octavius phantom(PTW, Freiburg, Germany). Measurements were performed on a Varian Clinac 2100 iX, linear accelerator equipped with a millennium 120 leaf collimator. Analysis was done by comparing the fluence measured for the tumors situated on the midline and tumors situated laterally. Results: Fluence measured for all the delivered plans were analyzed using Verisoft software (PTW, Freiburg, Germany). The gamma pass percentage for midline tumors were found to be higher compared with the lateralized ones. The standard deviation between gamma values for midline and lateralized tumors is 2.18 and 3.5 respectively. Also the standard deviation between the point doses for midline and lateralized tumors is 0.38 and 0.29 respectively. The average gamma passing rate for midline tumors is 96.55% and for lateralized tumors are 94.94% for 3%DD and 3mm DTA criteria. From the T test, it was found that there is no significant difference between the gamma pass percentage between midline and lateralized tumors with p value of 0.28. Conclusion: There is no particular correlation found in the gamma pass criteria for midline and lateralized tumors.Â«Â less\n\nUnder-response of a PTW-60019 microDiamond detector in the Bragg peak of a 62 MeV/n carbon ion beam\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRossomme, S.; Hopfgartner, J.; Vynckier, S.; Palmans, H.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nTo investigate the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of the response of a PTW-60019 Freiburg microDiamond detector, its response was compared to the response of a plane-parallel Markus chamber in a 62 MeV/n mono-energetic carbon ion beam. Results obtained with two different experimental setups are in agreement. As recommended by IAEA TRS-398, the response of the Markus chamber was corrected for temperature, pressure, polarity effects and ion recombination. No correction was applied to the response of the microDiamond detector. The ratio of the response of the Markus chamber to the response of the microDiamond is close to unity in the plateau region. In the Bragg peak region, a significant increase of the ratio is observed, which increases to 1.2 in the distal edge region. Results indicate a correlation between the under-response of the microDiamond detector and high LET values. The combined relative standard uncertainty of the results is estimated to be 2.38% in the plateau region and 12% in the distal edge region. These values are dominated by the uncertainty of alignment in the non-uniform beam and the uncertainty of range determination.\n\nProperties of a commercial PTW-60019 synthetic diamond detector for the dosimetry of small radiotherapy beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ¡rraga-GutiÃ©rrez, JosÃ© Manuel; Ballesteros-ZebadÃºa, Paola; RodrÃ­guez-Ponce, Miguel; GarcÃ­a-GarduÃ±o, Olivia Amanda; de la Cruz, Olga Olinca GalvÃ¡n\n\n2015-01-21\n\nA CVD based radiation detector has recently become commercially available from the manufacturer PTW-Freiburg (Germany). This detector has a sensitive volume of 0.004âmm(3), a nominal sensitivity of 1ânCâGy(-1) and operates at 0âV. Unlike natural diamond based detectors, the CVD diamond detector reports a low dose rate dependence. The dosimetric properties investigated in this work were dose rate, angular dependence and detector sensitivity and linearity. Also, percentage depth dose, off-axis dose profiles and total scatter ratios were measured and compared against equivalent measurements performed with a stereotactic diode. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to estimate the CVD small beam correction factors for a 6âMV photon beam. The small beam correction factors were compared with those obtained from stereotactic diode and ionization chambers in the same irradiation conditions The experimental measurements were performed in 6 and 15âMV photon beams with the following square field sizes: 10Â ÃÂ 10, 5Â ÃÂ 5, 4Â ÃÂ 4, 3Â ÃÂ 3, 2Â ÃÂ 2, 1.5Â ÃÂ 1.5, 1Â ÃÂ 1 and 0.5Â ÃÂ 0.5âcm. The CVD detector showed an excellent signal stability (<0.2%) and linearity, negligible dose rate dependence (<0.2%) and lower response angular dependence. The percentage depth dose and off-axis dose profiles measurements were comparable (within 1%) to the measurements performed with ionization chamber and diode in both conventional and small radiotherapy beams. For the 0.5Â ÃÂ 0.5âcm, the measurements performed with the CVD detector showed a partial volume effect for all the dosimetric quantities measured. The Monte Carlo simulation showed that the small beam correction factors were close to unity (within 1.0%) for field sizesÂ â¥1âcm. The synthetic diamond detector had high linearity, low angular and negligible dose rate dependence, and its response was energy independent within 1% for field sizes from 1.0 to 5.0âcm.

Methods: The Dw1 formalism of in-phantom measurement is: M*ND,w,60Co*(kglob)Dw1, where M is the collected charges, and (kglob)Dw1 the in-phantom Dw1 correction factor. Similarly, Ka is determined by M*ND,w,60Co*(kglob)ka, where (kglob)ka the in-phantom Ka correction factor. Two thimblemoreÂ Â» ICs PTW30013 and another PTW30016 having a ND,w,60Co from the German primary standard laboratory (PTB) were simultaneously exposed to the microselectron 192Ir v2 source at 8cm in a PMMA phantom. A reference well chamber (PTW33004) with a PTB transfer Ka calibration Nka was used for comparing the in-phantom measurements to derive the experimental (kglob)ka factors. We determined the experimental (kglob)Dw1 of the PTW30013 by comparing the PTW30016 measurements with MC-calculated (kglob)Dw1. Results: Ka results of the PTW30016 based on ND,w,60Co and MC-calculated (kglob)ka differ from the well chamber results based on Nka by 1.6% and from the manufacturer by 1.0%. Experimental (kglob)ka factors for the PTW30016 and two other PTW30013 are 0.00683, 0.00681 and 0.00679, and vary <0.5% with 1mm source positioning uncertainty. Experimental (kglob)Dw1 of the PTW30013 ICs are 75.3 and 75.6, and differ by 1.6% from the conversion by dose rate constant from the AAPM report 229. Conclusion: The 1.7% difference between MC and experimental (kglob)ka for the PTW30016 IC is within the PTB 2.5% expanded uncertainty in Ka calibration standard.

They have the ability to get around traffic queues, thus lowering fuel consumption and increasing mobility. The risk of rider injury in a traffic crash is however much higher than that associated with car users. The European project, Powered Two Wheeler Integrated Safety (PISa), identified an autonomous braking system (AB) as a priority to reduce the injury consequences of a PTW crash. The aim of this study was to assess the potential effectiveness of the AB system developed in PISa, taking into account the specific system characteristics that emerged during the design, development and testing phases. Fifty-eight PTW cases representing European crash configurations were examined, in which 43 percent of riders sustained a Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 2+ injury. Two of the most common crash types were a PTW impacting a stationary object (car following scenario) 16% and an object pulling across the PTW path (crossing scenario) 54%. An expert team analysed the in-depth material of the sample crashes and determined a posteriori to what extent the AB would have affected the crash. For those cases where the AB was evaluated as applicable, a further quantitative evaluation of the benefits was conducted by considering a set of different possible rider reactions in addition to that exhibited in the actual crash. In 67 percent of cases, the application of AB could have mitigated the crash outcome. Analysis of those real crash cases showed the potential for an expert rider to avoid the collision. An early reaction of the rider, associated with a correct application of the brakes would have avoided 18 of the 37 car following/crossing scenarios. Conversely, according to the analysis, an expert rider would not have been able to avoid 19 of the 37 cases. In 14 of those 19 cases, the AB would have contributed to mitigating the crash outcome.

Twenty-two eyes in 11 diabetic subjects were examined several times within a 12-month period using both visual acuity tests. The most commonly used visual acuity test in Denmark (the decimal progression chart) was compared to the Freiburg visual acuity test (automated testing) in a paired study. Correlation analysis revealed agreement between the two methods (r(2)=0.79; slope=0.82; y-axis intercept=0.01). The mean visual acuity was found to be 15% higher (P<0.0001) with the decimal progression chart than with the Freiburg visual acuity test. The reproducibility was the same in both tests (coefficient of variation: 12% for each test); however, the variation within the 12-month examination period differed significantly. The coefficient of variation was 17% using the decimal progression chart, 35% with the Freiburg visual acuity test. The reproducibility of the two visual acuity tests is comparable under optimal testing conditions in diabetic subjects with macular oedema. However, it appears that the Freiburg visual acuity test is significantly better for detection of biological variation.\n\nA study on the suitability of the PTW microDiamond detector for kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nDamodar, Joshita; Odgers, David; Pope, Dane; Hill, Robin\n\n2018-05-01\n\nKilovoltage x-ray beams are widely used in treating skin cancers and in biological irradiators. In this work, we have evaluated four dosimeters (ionization chambers and solid state detectors) in their suitability for relative dosimetry of kilovoltage x-ray beams in the energy range of 50 - 280kVp. The solid state detectors, which have not been investigated with low energy x-rays, were the PTW 60019 microDiamond synthetic diamond detector and the PTW 60012 diode. The two ionization chambers used were the PTW Advanced Markus parallel plate chamber and the PTW PinPoint small volume chamber. For each of the dosimeters, percentage depth doses were measured in water over the full range of x-ray beams and for field sizes ranging from 2cm diameter to 12 Ã 12cm. In addition, depth doses were measured for a narrow aperture (7mm diameter) using the PTW microDiamond detector. For comparison, the measured data was compared with Monte Carlo calculated doses using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo package. The depth dose results indicate that the Advanced Markus parallel plate and PinPoint ionization chambers were suitable for depth dose measurements in the beam quality range with an uncertainty of less than 3%, including in the regions closer to the surface of the water as compared with Monte Carlo depth dose data for all six energy beams. The response of the PTW Diode E detector was accurate to within 4% for all field sizes in the energy range of 50-125kVp but showed larger variations for higher energies of up to 12% with the 12 Ã 12cm field size. In comparison, the microDiamond detector had good agreement over all energies for both smaller and larger field sizes generally within 1% as compared to the Advanced Markus chamber field and Monte Carlo calculations. The only exceptions were in measuring the dose at the surface of the water phantom where larger differences were found. For the 7mm diameter field, the agreement between the microDiamond detector and Monte Carlo calculations was\n\nEpidermolysis bullosa care in Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nBruckner-Tuderman, Leena\n\n2010-04-01\n\nUntil 2003, no structures existed in Germany for special care of patients with rare diseases, such as epidermolysis bullosa (EB). At that point, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research announced a clinical research program-networks for rare diseases. The Network Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB Network), coordinated from the Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Freiburg, has operated since October 2003 with the goal of improving diagnostics and clinical management, elucidating disease mechanisms, and development of novel therapies for EB (www.netzwerk-eb.de). Future goals of the EB Network include securing the clinical-diagnostic and IT structures established with grant support and focusing research on molecular disease mechanisms in EB and novel biologically valid therapies. Intensive collaborations with other networks for rare genetic diseases will generate durable structures in Germany and form a basis for future international consortia. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A virtual phantom planning exercise was planned and independently measured using the PTW Octavius(Â®) phantom and seven29(Â®) 2D array (PTW-Freiburg GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). MCS and MU were compared with the median gamma index pass rates (2%/2 and 3%/3âmm) and plan quality. The treatment planning systems (TPS) were grouped by VMAT modelling being specifically designed for the linear accelerator manufacturer's own treatment delivery system (Type 1) or independent of vendor for VMAT delivery (Type 2). Differences in plan complexity (MCS and MU) between TPS types were compared. For Varian(Â®) linear accelerators (Varian(Â®) Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), MCS and MU were significantly correlated with gamma pass rates. Type 2 TPS created poorer quality, more complex plans with significantly higher MUs and MCS than Type 1 TPS. Plan quality was significantly correlated with MU for Type 2 plans. A statistically significant correlation was observed between MU and MCS for all plans (Râ=â-0.84, pâ<â0.01). MU and MCS have a role in assessing plan complexity in audits along with plan quality metrics. Plan complexity metrics give some indication of plan deliverability but should be analysed with plan quality. Complexity metrics were investigated for a national rotational audit involving 34 institutions and they showed value. The metrics found that more complex plans were created for planning systems which were independent of vendor for VMAT delivery.\n\nAn investigation of the operating characteristics of two PTW diamond detectors in photon and electron beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Angelis, C; Onori, S; Pacilio, M; Cirrone, G A P; Cuttone, G; Raffaele, L; Bucciolini, M; Mazzocchi, S\n\n2002-02-01\n\nThe dosimetric properties of two PTW Riga diamond detectors type 60003 were studied in high-energy photon and electron therapy beam. Properties under study were current-voltage characteristic, polarization effect, time stability of response, dose response, dose-rate dependence, temperature stability, and beam quality dependence of the sensitivity factor. Differences were shown between the two detectors for most of the previous properties. Also, the observed behavior was, to some extent, different from what was reported in the PTW technical specifications. The necessity to characterize each diamond detector individually was addressed.\n\nDetermination of recombination and polarity correction factors, kS and kP, for small cylindrical ionization chambers PTW 31021 and PTW 31022 in pulsed filtered and unfiltered beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nBruggmoser, Gregor; Saum, Rainer; Kranzer, Rafael\n\n2018-01-12\n\nThe aim of this technical communication is to provide correction factors for recombination and polarity effect for two new ionization chambers PTW PinPoint 3D (type 31022) and PTW Semiflex 3D (type 31021). The correction factors provided are for the (based on the) German DIN 6800-2 dosimetry protocol and the AAPM TG51 protocol. The measurements were made in filtered and unfiltered high-energy photon beams in a water equivalent phantom at maximum depth of the PDD and a field size on the surface of 10cmÃ10cm. The design of the new chamber types leads to an ion collection efficiency and a polarity effect that are well within the specifications requested by pertinent dosimetry protocols including the addendum of TG-51. It was confirmed that the recombination effect of both chambers mainly depends on dose per pulse and is independent of the filtration of the photon beam. Copyright Â© 2018.

Since its first detection in 2007 in Germany at the motorway A5 coming from Italy via Switzerland to Germany, it has been continuously introduced by vehicles, most probably from Italy. After a hint from an alert gardener in an allotment garden area in Freiburg, Southwest Germany, in 2015, a surveillance programme was started focusing on the garden area and adjacent areas as well as most of the cemeteries as potential infestation areas. The surveillance programme confirmed a high infestation of the allotment garden. The container index (CI) exceeded almost 30% in August 2015. In lethal gravid Aedes traps (GATs) and BG-Sentinel traps, 4038 adults were caught. It could be proven that the Aedes population is more or less still spatially restricted to the allotment garden area which is adjacent to a train station where trucks from Novara, Italy, arrive loaded on trains. Outside the garden area, only a few breeding sites with developmental stages and adults were found within a radius of approximately 600Â m from the highly infested garden area. It is most likely that Ae. albopictus females are constantly introduced as 'blind passengers' to Freiburg via trucks from Italy to Freiburg, Germany. After the first detection of the mass development of Ae. albopictus immediate and comprehensive control measures were initiated to reduce or even eliminate the Aedes population. Citizen awareness, especially of the gardeners, was increased by providing thorough information about the biology and control of Ae. albopictus. Beside environmental management, tablets based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) were applied. The success of the control activities by the gardeners is reflected by the data gained during monthly inspection of the garden plots. The number of gardens without any container increased from 17% in July to 22% in August and 35% in September, 2015\n\nIMRT plan verification with EBT2 and EBT3 films compared to PTW 2D-ARRAY seven29\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHanuÅ¡ovÃ¡, Tereza; HorÃ¡kovÃ¡, Ivana; KoniarovÃ¡, Irena\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare dosimetry with Gafchromic EBT2 and EBT3 films to the ion chamber array PTW seven29 in terms of their performance in clinical IMRT plan verification. A methodology for film processing and calibration was developed. Calibration curves were obtained in MATLAB and in FilmQA Pro. The best calibration curve was then used to calibrate EBT2 and EBT3 films for IMRT plan verification measurements. Films were placed in several coronal planes into an RW3 slab phantom and irradiated with a clinical IMRT plan for prostate and lymph nodes using 18 MV photon beams. Individual fields were tested and irradiated with gantry at 0Â°. Results were evaluated using gamma analysis with 3%/3 mm criteria in OmniPro I'mRT version 1.7. The same measurements were performed with the ion chamber array PTW seven29 in RW3 slabs (different depths) and in the OCTAVIUS II phantom (isocenter depth only; both original and nominal gantry angles). Results were evaluated in PTW VeriSoft version 3.1 using the same criteria. Altogether, 45 IMRT planes were tested with film and 25 planes with the PTW 2D-ARRAY seven29. Film measuerements showed different results than ion chamber matrix measurements. With PTW 2D-ARRAY seven29, worse results were obtained when the detector was placed into the OCTAVIUS phantom than into the RW3 slab phantom, and the worst pass rates were seen for rotational measurements. EBT2 films showed inconsistent results and could differ significantly for different planes in one field. EBT3 films seemed to give the best results of all the tested configurations.\n\n[The Freiburg speech intelligibility test : AÂ pillar of speech audiometry in German-speaking countries].\n\nPubMed\n\nHoth, S\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe Freiburg speech intelligibility test according to DINÂ 45621 was introduced around 60Â years ago. For decades, and still today, the Freiburg test has been aÂ standard whose relevance extends far beyond pure audiometry. It is used primarily to determine the speech perception threshold (based on two-digit numbers) and the ability to discriminate speech at suprathreshold presentation levels (based on monosyllabic nouns). Moreover, it is aÂ measure of the degree of disability, the requirement for and success of technical hearing aids (auxiliaries directives), and the compensation for disability and handicap (KÃ¶nigstein recommendation). In differential audiological diagnostics, the Freiburg test contributes to the distinction between low- and high-frequency hearing loss, as well as to identification of conductive, sensory, neural, and central disorders. Currently, the phonemic and perceptual balance of the monosyllabic test lists is subject to critical discussions. Obvious deficiencies exist for testing speech recognition in noise. In this respect, alternatives such as sentence or rhyme tests in closed-answer inventories are discussed.\n\nThe role of complexity metrics in a multi-institutional dosimetry audit of VMAT\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAgnew, Christina E; Hussein, Mohammad; Tsang, Yatman; McWilliam, Alan; Hounsell, Alan R; Clark, Catharine H\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: To demonstrate the benefit of complexity metrics such as the modulation complexity score (MCS) and monitor units (MUs) in multi-institutional audits of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery.

We tested it to find out the minimal required pre-irradiation dose, the dose linearity, dose rate dependency and the angular response as well as usability in the small animal radiation research platform, SARRP (Xstrahl Ltd., Camberley, UK). For a stable signal in the range of energies used in the study, we found a required pre-irradiation dose of 10Gy. The dose linearity and dose rate dependence measurements showed a very good performance of the microDiamond detector. Regarding the effect of angular dependency, the variation of the response signal is less than 0.5% within the first 15Â° of the polar angle. In the azimuthal angle, however, there are differences in detector response up to 20%, depending on the range of energies used in the study. In addition, we compared the detector to a radiosensitive film for a profile measurement of a 5Ã5mm 2 irradiation field. Both methods showed a good accordance with the field size, however, the film has a steeper dose gradient in the penumbra region but also a higher noise than the microDiamond detector. We demonstrated that the microDiamond detector is a useful measurement tool for small animal RT research due to its small size. Nevertheless, it seems to be very important to verify the response of the detector in the given set-up and energy range. Copyright Â© 2018.

Due to the specific structure of medical school and the high amount of mandatory lectures, students with children face serious problems in balancing family life and their studies at the same time. On the other hand, the freer, modular structure of the clinical curriculum in Freiburg has been mainly rated as positive by the interviewees. In order to improve the situation of students with children, the interviewees favour a more flexible curriculum in general as well as an increase in information and advice services offered by the faculty. In the first place, the results of the study encourage us to maintain the modular structure in the final two clinical years in Freiburg in view of current curriculum developments. Additionally, we aim to offer targeted support to students with children. Furthermore, a wider range of e-learning supported lectures is to help students manage their studies with childcare and family obligations.\n\nFreiburg RNA tools: a central online resource for RNA-focused research and teaching.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaden, Martin; Ali, Syed M; Alkhnbashi, Omer S; Busch, Anke; Costa, Fabrizio; Davis, Jason A; Eggenhofer, Florian; Gelhausen, Rick; Georg, Jens; Heyne, Steffen; Hiller, Michael; Kundu, Kousik; Kleinkauf, Robert; Lott, Steffen C; Mohamed, Mostafa M; Mattheis, Alexander; Miladi, Milad; Richter, Andreas S; Will, Sebastian; Wolff, Joachim; Wright, Patrick R; Backofen, Rolf\n\n2018-05-21\n\nThe Freiburg RNA tools webserver is a well established online resource for RNA-focused research.

Methods: Volumetric-modulated arc plans (5 head-and-neck and 3 prostate) collapsed to 40Â° gantry on the OCTAVIUS 4D phantom in QA mode on Monaco v5.0 (Elekta, CMS, Maryland Heights, MO) were delivered on a Elekta Agility linac. This study was divided into two parts: (1) error-free measurements by gantry-mounted EvolutionXX 2D array were reconstructed in COMPASS (IBA dosimetry, GmbH, Germany), and by OCTAVIUS 1500 array in Versoft v6.1 (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) to obtain the 3D doses (COM4D and OCTA4D). COM4D and OCTA4D weremoreÂ Â» compared to the raw measurement (OCTA3D) at the same detector plane for which OCTAVIUS 1500 was perpendicular to 0Â° gantry axis while the plans were delivered at gantry 40Â°; (2) beam steering errors of energy (Hump=-2%) and symmetry (2T=+2%) were introduced during the delivery of 5 plans to compare the MGDR doses COM4D-Hump (COM4D-2T), OCTA4D-Hump (OCTA4D-2T), with raw doses OCTA3D-Hump (OCTA3D-2T) and with OCTA3D to assess the error reconstruction and detection ability of MGDR tools. All comparisons used Î¥-criteria of 2%(local dose)/2mm and 3%/3mm. Results: Averaged Î¥ passing rates were 85% and 96% for COM4D,and 94% and 99% for OCTA4D at 2%/2mm and 3%/3mm criteria respectively. For error reconstruction, COM4D-Hump (COM4D-2T) showed 81% (93%) at 2%/2mm and 94% (98%) at 3%/3mm, while OCTA4D-Hump (OCTA4D-2T) showed 96% (96%) at 2%/2mm and 99% (99%) at 3%/3mm. For error detection, OCTA3D doses were compared to COM4D-Hump (COM4D-2T) showing Î¥ passing rates of 93% (93%) at 2%/2mm and 98% (98%), and to OCTA4D-Hump (OCTA4D -2T) showing 94% (99%) at 2%/2mm and 81% (96%) at 3%/3mm, respectively. Conclusion: OCTAVIUS MGDR showed better agreement to raw measurements in both error- and error-free comparisons. COMPASS MGDR deviated from the raw measurements possibly owing to beam modeling uncertainty.Â«Â less\n\nInsights into the Freiburg Anatomical Institute during National Socialism, 1933-1945.\n\nPubMed\n\nHildebrandt, Sabine\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe Anatomical Institute at the Albert-Ludwigs-UniversitÃ¤t Freiburg is among the anatomical departments for which a comprehensive account of its history during National Socialism (NS) is still missing. Previous investigations (such as in: GrÃ¼n et al., 2002) have revealed the political activities of some anatomists, but, in the absence of relevant body-registers, a more comprehensive examination of the anatomical body procurement has not been attempted. The inspection of records in university and municipal archives allows insight into the activities in the institute within the historical context. The Freiburg Institute shared the experience of the impact of NS politics with other German anatomies. Four anatomists were dismissed because of NS racial discrimination, and chairman von MÃ¶llendorf left for political reasons. His successor Nauck's appointment was politically motivated, as he was a staunch Nazi. His colleagues were also members of NS political organizations. Body procurement was controversial between the public and the anatomists in Freiburg prior to and following the Third Reich, and much of the anatomists' efforts focused on the improvement of the body supply. In 1935, and, again during the war, the number of bodies was sufficient for anatomical education. Among the traditional sources of body procurement were increasing numbers of NS victims. Forty-four of them can be identified, among them 21 forced laborers and their children who died of so-called natural causes, and 22 men who had been executed at Stuttgart prison on April 6, 1943. While the victims' names have been ascertained, their biographies still need restoration to ensure an appropriate commemoration. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Methods: 4D-MGDR measurements were divided into two parts: 1) square fields from 2Ã2 to 25Ã25 cm{sup 2} at 0Â°, 10Â° and 45Â° gantry, and 2) 8 VMAT plans (5 nasopharyngeal and 3 prostate) collapsed to gantry 40Â° in QA mode in Monaco v5.0 (Elekta, CMS, Maryland Heights, MO) were delivered on the OCTAVIUS 4D phantom with the OCTAVIUS 1500 detector plane perpendicular to either the incident beam to obtain the reconstructed dose (OCTA4D) or the 0Â° gantry axis tomoreÂ Â» obtain the raw doses (OCTA3D) in Verisoft 6.1 (PTW, Freiburg, Germany). Raw measurements of OCTA3D were limited to < 45Â° gantry to avoid >0.5% variation of detector angular response with respect to 0Â° gantry as determined previously. Reconstructed OCTA4D and raw OCTA3D doses for all plans were compared at the same detector plane using Î³ criteria of 2% (local dose)/2mm and 3%/3mm criteria. Results: At gantry 0Â° and 10Â°, the Î³ results for all OCTA4D on detector plane coinciding with OCTA3D were over 90% at 2%/2mm except for the largest field (25Ã25 cm{sup 2} ) showing >88%. For square field at 45Â° gantry, Î³ passing rate is > 90% for fields smaller than 15x 15cm2 but < 80% for field size of 20 x20 cm{sup 2} upward. For VMAT, Î³ results showed 94% and 99% passing rate at 2%/2mm and 3%/3mm, respectively. Conclusion: OCTAVIUS 4D system has compromised accuracy in reconstructing dose away from the central beam axis, possibly due to the off-axis softening correction and errors of the percent depth dose data necessary as input for MGDR. Good results in VMAT delivery suggested that the system is relatively reliable for VMAT with small segments.Â«Â less\n\nAir kerma calibration factors and chamber correction values for PTW soft x-ray, NACP and Roos ionization chambers at very low x-ray energies.\n\nPubMed\n\nIpe, N E; Rosser, K E; Moretti, C J; Manning, J W; Palmer, M J\n\n2001-08-01\n\nThis paper evaluates the characteristics of ionization chambers for the measurement of absorbed dose to water using very low-energy x-rays. The values of the chamber correction factor, k(ch), used in the IPEMB 1996 code of practice for the UK secondary standard ionization chambers (PTW type M23342 and PTW type M23344), the Roos (PTW type 34001) and NACP electron chambers are derived. The responses in air of the small and large soft x-ray chambers (PTW type M23342 and PTW type M23344) and the NACP and Roos electron ionization chambers were compared. Besides the soft x-ray chambers, the NACP and Roos chambers can be used for very low-energy x-ray dosimetry provided that they are used in the restricted energy range for which their response does not change by more than 5%. The chamber correction factor was found by comparing the absorbed dose to water determined using the dosimetry protocol recommended for low-energy x-rays with that for very low-energy x-rays. The overlap energy range was extended using data from Grosswendt and Knight. Chamber correction factors given in this paper are chamber dependent, varying from 1.037 to 1.066 for a PTW type M23344 chamber, which is very different from a value of unity given in the IPEMB code. However, the values of k(ch) determined in this paper agree with those given in the DIN standard within experimental uncertainty. The authors recommend that the very low-energy section of the IPEMB code is amended to include the most up-to-date values of k(ch).\n\nStarck Ta PTW strength model recommendation for use with SESAME 93524 EoS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSjue, Sky K.; Prime, Michael Bruce\n\n2017-02-27\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide a calibration of the Preston-Tonks- Wallace (PTW) strength model for use with the new SESAME equation of state (EoS) 93524.

The study has been conducted on a total of 80 children and four groups in Freiburg/Germany and Ankara/Turkey. The applications have been done in University of Freiburg, Cochlear Implant Center in Germany, and University of Hacettepe, ENT Department, Audiology and Speech Pathology Section in Turkey. In this study, the data have been collected by means of General Information Form and Cochlear Implant Information Form applied to parents. To determine the dominant multiple intelligence types of children, the TIMI (Teele Inventory of Multiple Intelligences) which was developed by Sue Teele have been used. The study results exposed that there was not a statistically significant difference on dominant intelligence areas and averages of scores of multiple intelligence types in control groups (p>0.05). Although, the dominant intelligence areas were different (except for first dominant intelligence) in cochlear implanted children in Turkey and Germany, there was not a statistically significant difference on averages of scores of dominant multiple intelligence types. Every hearing impaired child who started training, should be evaluated in terms of multiple intelligence areas and identified strengths and weaknesses. Multiple intelligence activities should be used in their educational programs. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Autonomous braking systems have been implemented in several types of vehicles and are presently addressed by research in the field of PTWs. A major concern in this context is the rider stability. Experiments with volunteers were performed in order to find out whether autonomous braking for PTWs will produce a greater instability of the rider in comparison to manual braking. The PTW's braking conditions were simulated in a laboratory with a motorcycle mock-up mounted on a sled, which was accelerated with an average of 0.35 g. The motion of the rider was captured in autonomous braking scenarios with and without pre-warning as well as in manual braking scenarios. No significant differences between the scenarios were found with respect to maximum forward displacement of the volunteer's torso and head (p<0.05). By performing clustering analysis on two kinematic parameters, two different strategies of the volunteers were identified. They were not related to the braking scenarios. A relation of the clusters with the initial posture represented by the elbow angle was revealed (p<0.05). It is concluded that autonomous braking at low deceleration will not cause significant instabilities of the rider in comparison to manual braking in idealized laboratory conditions. Based on this, further research into the development and implementation of autonomous braking systems for PTWs, e.g. by extensive riding tests, seems valuable. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Patients were selected to have lesions greater than or equal to 2cm. A mask might be needed depending on special locations. The lesions on the eyelid and face presented in this research were, however, treated without a mask. Cutting the flap into a shape conformal to the target and attaching it to the mask were usedmoreÂ Â» in order to make the treatment reproducible. Patients were scanned with a Philips Big Bore Brilliant CT. A 1cm margin was added to the lesion. An Elekta Oncentra Brachy treatment planning system ver. 4.3 was used for treatment planning. 40 Gy in 10 or 8 fractions was prescribed to the 1cm depth. The Freiburg flap was aligned and verified by CT scanning prior to treatment. Results: Three patients with squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin were treated with the Freiburg flap applicator. Lesion sizes ranged from 2cm to 6 cm in a maximum dimension. With treatment planning, we made a dose correction for compensating the dose deviation resulting from the incomplete scatter environment of the flap applicators exposed to air. The flap was also covered by a 4cm bolus in order to obtain more back scattered radiation during treatment. Six month follow up showed a very good cosmetic result. Conclusion: The Freiburg flap brachytherapy offers a non-invasive skin cancer treatment with a high skin dose delivered to the tumor while a low dose sparing the surrounding health tissue. It is a promising alternative to skin cancer surgery or external beam radiation therapy.Â«Â less\n\nAir density dependence of the soft X-ray PTW 34013 ionization chamber.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorres Del RÃ­o, Julia; Forastero, Cristina; Tornero-LÃ³pez, Ana M; LÃ³pez, JesÃºs J; Guirado, DamiÃ¡n; Perez-Calatayud, JosÃ©; Lallena, Antonio M\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe studied the dependence on air density of the response of the PTW 34013 ionization chamber, recently upgraded for dosimetry control of low energy X-ray beams. Measurements were performed by changing the pressure conditions inside a pressure chamber. The behavior of the measurements against the air density inside this chamber was analyzed. X-ray beams generated with 50, 70, 100, 150 and 200â¯kVp and the two electrometer polarities were considered. For all beams studied, measurements corrected with the conventional temperature and pressure factor showed a residual dependence on the air density that was described with a linear function of the air density. For the 50 and 70â¯kVp beams, corrected measurements remained â¼1% smaller than the value found at standard pressure/temperature conditions, for both electrometer polarities and for the air density range typical in clinical conditions. For air densities smaller than the standard one, measurements found for 100, 150 and 200â¯kVp beams were below or above the value found at standard pressure and temperature when the negative or positive electrometer polarities were used, respectively. The differences with the measurements at standard conditions were less than 1% for the 100â¯kVp beam and below 4% for the other two beams. The PTW 34013 ionization chamber showed a dependence on the air density that is not properly described with the usual temperature and pressure correction factor. This residual dependence is negligible for low energy beams, for which this chamber is recommended, but is more substantial for beams with energy above 80â¯kVp.

Freiburger Symposium 2011 der SCG-Division Industrielle Chemie Technology Progress, Success Key for our Production Sites.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaef, Olivier\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis short paper presents the abstracts of the different presentations during 10. Freiburger Symposium 2011 der SCG-Division Industrielle Chemie: Technology Progress, Success key for our production sites held Thursday and Friday, September 29 and 30, 2011 at the Ecole d'ingÃ©nieurs et d'architectes de Fribourg (Switzerland).\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWunderle, K; Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI; Godley, A\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this investigation is to characterize and quantify X-ray beam profiles for fluoroscopic x-ray beam spectra incorporating spectral (copper) filtration. Methods: A PTW (Freiburg, Germany) type 60016 silicon diode detector and PTW MP3 water tank were used to measure X-ray beam profiles for 60, 80, 100 and 120 kVp x-ray beams at five different copper filtration thicknesses ranging from 0â0.9 mm at 22 and 42 cm fields of view and depths of 1, 5, and 10 cm in both the anode-cathode axis (inplane) and cross-plane directions. All measurements were acquired on a Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) Artis ZeeGomoreÂ Â» fluoroscope inverted from the typical orientation providing an x-ray beam originating from above the water surface with the water level set at 60 cm from the focal spot. Results: X-ray beam profiles for beam spectra without copper filtration compared well to previously published data by Fetterly et al. [Med Phys, 28, 205 (2001)]. Our data collection benefited from the geometric orientation of the fluoroscope, providing a beam perpendicular to the tank water surface, rather than through a thin side wall as did the previously mentioned study. Profiles for beams with copper filtration were obtained which have not been previously investigated and published. Beam profiles in the anode-cathode axis near the surface and at lower x-ray energy exhibited substantial heel effect, which became less pronounced at greater depth. At higher energy with copper filtration in the beam, the dose falloff out-of-field became less pronounced, as would be anticipated given higher scatter photon energy. Conclusion: The x-ray beam profile data for the fluoroscopic x-ray beams incorporating copper filtration are intended for use as reference data for estimating doses to organs or soft tissue, including fetal dose, involving similar beam qualities or for comparison with mathematical models.Â«Â less\n\nEffect of the thermoplastic masks on dose distribution in the build-up region for photon beams\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPÃ³Åtorak, MichaÅ; Fujak, Edyta; KukoÅowicz, PaweÅ\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the influence of thermoplastic masks material (Klarity Medical&Equipment Co., Guangzhou, China) with different diameters of holes (Ï 0.25 cm and Ï 0.40 cm) on the dose distribution in the build-up region for photon beams. Measurements were made for external radiation beams produced by the linear accelerator (TrueBeam, Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) using the Markus parallel plane ionization chamber and the Unidos electrometer (both from PTW, Freiburg, Germany). Measurements were made in a solid water phantom for two photon energies 6 MV and 15 MV, at 90 cm source to skin distance, for four fields of 5 cm Ã 5 cm, 10 cm Ã 10 cm, 15 cm Ã 15 cm and 20 cm Ã 20 cm. Compared to the open field, the maximum dose with mask was closer to the surface of the phantom by about 1.4 mm and 1.2 mm for 6 MV and 15 MV X-Rays, respectively. The surface dose increase from 10% to 42% for 6 MV and from 5% to 28% for 15 MV X-Rays.\n\nPotential errors in relative dose measurements in kilovoltage photon beams due to polarity effects in plane-parallel ionisation chambers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDowdell, S.; Tyler, M.; McNamara, J.; Sloan, K.; Ceylan, A.; Rinks, A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nPlane-parallel ionisation chambers are regularly used to conduct relative dosimetry measurements for therapeutic kilovoltage beams during commissioning and routine quality assurance. This paper presents the first quantification of the polarity effect in kilovoltage photon beams for two types of commercially available plane-parallel ionisation chambers used for such measurements. Measurements were performed at various depths along the central axis in a solid water phantom and for different field sizes at 2âcm depth to determine the polarity effect for PTW Advanced Markus and Roos ionisation chambers (PTW-Freiburg, Germany). Data was acquired for kilovoltage beams between 100 kVp (half-value layer (HVL)ââ=ââ2.88âmm Al) and 250 kVp (HVLââ=ââ2.12âmm Cu) and field sizes of 3-15âcm diameter for 30âcm focus-source distance (FSD) and 4ââÃââ4âcm2-20ââÃââ20âcm2 for 50âcm FSD. Substantial polarity effects, up to 9.6%, were observed for the Advanced Markus chamber compared to a maximum 0.5% for the Roos chamber. The magnitude of the polarity effect was observed to increase with field size and beam energy but was consistent with depth. The polarity effect is directly influenced by chamber design, with potentially large polarity effects for some plane-parallel ionisation chambers. Depending on the specific chamber used, polarity corrections may be required for output factor measurements of kilovoltage photon beams. Failure to account for polarity effects could lead to an incorrect dose being delivered to the patient.\n\nDosimetric characteristics of a new unshielded silicon diode and its application in clinical photon and electron beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nGriessbach, Irmgard; Lapp, Markus; Bohsung, JÃ¶rg; Gademann, GÃ¼nther; Harder, Dietrich\n\n2005-12-01\n\nShielded p-silicon diodes, frequently applied in general photon-beam dosimetry, show certain imperfections when applied in the small photon fields occurring in stereotactic or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), in electron beams and in the buildup region of photon beam dose distributions. Using as a study object the shielded p-silicon diode PTW 60008, well known for its reliable performance in general photon dosimetry, we have identified these imperfections as effects of electron scattering at the metallic parts of the shielding. In order to overcome these difficulties a new, unshielded diode PTW 60012 has been designed and manufactured by PTW Freiburg. By comparison with reference detectors, such as thimble and plane-parallel ionization chambers and a diamond detector, we could show the absence of these imperfections. An excellent performance of the new unshielded diode for the special dosimetric tasks in small photon fields, electron beams and build-up regions of photon beams has been observed. The new diode also has an improved angular response. However, due to its over-response to low-energy scattered photons, its recommended range of use does not include output factor measurements in large photon fields, although this effect can be compensated by a thin auxiliary lead shield.\n\nFurther specimens of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Diptera, Culicidae) trapped in southwest Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nKampen, Helge; Kronefeld, Mandy; Zielke, Dorothee; Werner, Doreen\n\n2013-02-01\n\nAfter two previous demonstrations of introductions of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, into southern Germany in 2007 and 2011, another three specimens were trapped in the city of Freiburg in the Upper Rhine Valley. The females were caught in early September 2011 (n = 2) and mid-July 2012 (n = 1). The trap was located at a railway container station where cargo is transferred to trains from trucks predominantly coming from southern Europe where A. albopictus is widely distributed. The reported findings confirm vehicle transport of A. albopictus to be an important and probably frequent mode of importation, and suggest that more regular and intense monitoring for invasive mosquito species in the Upper Rhine Valley should be undertaken in order to detect an establishment and implement adequate control measures in good time.\n\nPTW-diamond detector: dose rate and particle type dependence.\n\nPubMed\n\nFidanzio, A; Azario, L; Miceli, R; Russo, A; Piermattei, A\n\n2000-11-01\n\nIn this paper the suitability of a PTW natural diamond detector (DD) for relative and reference dosimetry of photon and electron beams, with dose per pulse between 0.068 mGy and 0.472 mGy, was studied and the results were compared with those obtained by a stereotactic silicon detector (SFD). The results show that, in the range of the examined dose per pulse the DD sensitivity changes up to 1.8% while the SFD sensitivity changes up to 4.5%. The fitting parameter, delta, used to correct the dose per pulse dependence of solid state detectors, was delta = 0.993 +/- 0.002 and delta = 1.025 +/- 0.002 for the diamond detector and for the silicon diode, respectively. The delta values were found to be independent of particle type of two conventional beams (a 10 MV x-ray beam and a 21 MeV electron beam). So if delta is determined for a radiotherapy beam, it can be used to correct relative dosimetry for other conventional radiotherapy beams. Moreover the diamond detector shows a calibration factor which is independent of beam quality and particle type, so an empirical dosimetric formalism is proposed here to obtain the reference dosimetry. This formalism is based on a dose-to-water calibration factor and on an empirical coefficient, that takes into account the reading dependence on the dose per pulse.\n\nIs the PTW 60019 microDiamond a suitable candidate for small field reference dosimetry?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Coste, Vanessa; Francescon, Paolo; Marinelli, Marco; Masi, Laura; Paganini, Lucia; Pimpinella, Maria; Prestopino, Giuseppe; Russo, Serenella; Stravato, Antonella; Verona, Claudio; Verona-Rinati, Gianluca\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA systematic study of the PTW microDiamond (MD) output factors (OF) is reported, aimed at clarifying its response in small fields and investigating its suitability for small field reference dosimetry. Ten MDs were calibrated under 60Co irradiation. OF measurements were performed in 6 MV photon beams by a CyberKnife M6, a Varian DHX and an Elekta Synergy linacs. Two PTW silicon diodes E (Si-D) were used for comparison. The results obtained by the MDs were evaluated in terms of absorbed dose to water determination in reference conditions and OF measurements, and compared to the results reported in the recent literature. To this purpose, the Monte Carlo (MC) beam-quality correction factor, kQMD , was calculated for the MD, and the small field output correction factors, k{{Qclin},{{Q}msr}}{{fclin},{{f}msr}} , were calculated for both the MD and the Si-D by two different research groups. An empirical function was also derived, providing output correction factors within 0.5% from the MC values calculated for all of the three linacs. A high reproducibility of the dosimetric properties was observed among the ten MDs. The experimental kQMD values are in agreement within 1% with the MC calculated ones. Output correction factors withinââ+0.7% andââ-1.4% were obtained down to field sizes as narrow as 5âmm. The resulting MD and Si-D field factors are in agreement within 0.2% in the case of CyberKnife measurements and 1.6% in the other cases. This latter higher spread of the data was demonstrated to be due to a lower reproducibility of small beam sizes defined by jaws or multi leaf collimators. The results of the present study demonstrate the reproducibility of the MD response and provide a validation of the MC modelling of this device. In principle, accurate reference dosimetry is thus feasible by using the microDiamond dosimeter for field sizes down to 5âmm.\n\nThe covariance of air quality conditions in six cities in Southern Germany - The role of meteorology.\n\nPubMed\n\nDimitriou, Konstantinos; Kassomenos, Pavlos\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper analyzed air quality in six cities in Southern Germany (Ulm, Augsburg, Konstanz, Freiburg, Stuttgart and Munich), in conjunction with the prevailing synoptic conditions. Air quality was estimated through the calculation of a daily Air Stress Index (ASI) constituted by five independent components, each one expressing the contribution of one of the five main pollutants (PM 10 , O 3 , SO 2 , NO 2 and CO) to the total air stress. As it was deduced from ASI components, PM 10 from combustion sources and photochemically produced tropospheric O 3 are the most hazardous pollutants at the studied sites, throughout cold and warm periods respectively, yet PM 10 contribute substantially to the overall air stress during both seasons. The influence of anticyclonic high pressure systems, leading to atmospheric stagnation, was associated with increased ASI values, mainly due to the entrapment of PM 10 . Moderate air stress was generally estimated in all cities however a cleaner atmosphere was detected principally in Freiburg when North Europe was dominated by low pressure systems. Daily events of notably escalated ASI values were further analyzed with backward air mass trajectories. Throughout cold period, ASI episodes were commonly related to eastern airflows carrying exogenous PM 10 originated from eastern continental Europe. During warm period, ASI episodes were connected to the arrival of regionally circulated air parcels reflecting lack of dispersion and accumulation of pollutants in accordance with the synoptic analysis.

W. H.; van Asselen, B.; de Vries, J. H. W.; Kok, J. G. M.; Lagendijk, J. J. W.; Raaymakers, B. W.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAccurate small-field dosimetry is critical for a magnetic resonance linac (MRI-linac). The PTW 60019 microDiamond is close to an ideal detector for small field dosimetry due to its small physical size, high signal-to-noise ratio and approximate water equivalence. It is important to fully characterise the performance of the detector in a 1.5 T magnetic field prior to its use for MRI-linac commissioning and quality assurance. Standard techniques of detector testing have been implemented, or adapted where necessary to suit the capabilities of the MRI-linac. Detector warmup, constancy, dose linearity, dose rate linearity, field size dependence and leakage were within tolerance. Measurements with the detector were consistent with ion chamber measurements for medium sized fields. The effective point of measurement of the detector when used within a 1.5 T magnetic field was determined to be 0.80 Â± 0.23 mm below the top surface of the device, consistent with the existing vendor recommendation and alignment mark at 1.0âmm. The angular dependence was assessed. Variations of up to 9.7% were observed, which are significantly greater than in a 0 T environment. Within the expected range of use, the maximum effect is approximately 0.6% which is within tolerance. However for large beams within a magnetic field, the divergence and consequent variation in angle of photon incidence means that the microDiamond would not be ideal for characterising the profiles and it would not be suitable for determining large-field beam parameters such as symmetry. It would also require a correction factor prior to use for patient-specific QA measurements where radiation is delivered from different gantry angles. The results of this study demonstrate that the PTW 60019 microDiamond detector is suitable for measuring small radiation fields within a 1.5 T magnetic field and thus is suitable for use in MRI-linac commissioning and quality assurance.\n\nPerformance of a PTW 60019 microDiamond detector in a 1.5 T MRI-linac.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoodings, S J; Wolthaus, J W H; van Asselen, B; de Vries, J H W; Kok, J G M; Lagendijk, J J W; Raaymakers, B W\n\n2018-03-08\n\nAccurate small-field dosimetry is critical for a magnetic resonance linac (MRI-linac).

A general good agreement is observed for field sizes down to about 1 cm. However, evident inconsistencies can be noticed when comparing some experimental results and Monte Carlo simulations obtained for smaller irradiation fields. This issue was tentatively attributed by some authors to unintentional large variations of the MD active surface area. The aim of the present study is a nondestructive experimental determination ofmoreÂ Â» the MD active surface area and active volume. Methods: Ten MD dosimeters, one MD prototype, and three synthetic diamond samples were investigated in the present work. 2D maps of the MD response were recorded under scanned soft x-ray microbeam irradiation, leading to an experimental determination of the device active surface area. Profiles of the device responses were measured as well. In order to evaluate the MD active volume, the thickness of the diamond sensing layer was independently evaluated by capacitance measurements and alpha particle detection experiments. The MD sensitivity, measured at the PTW calibration laboratory, was also used to calculate the device active volume thickness. Results: An average active surface area diameter of (2.19 Â± 0.02) mm was evaluated by 2D maps and response profiles of all the MDs. Average active volume thicknesses of (1.01 Â± 0.13) Î¼m and (0.97 Â± 0.14) Î¼m were derived by capacitance and sensitivity measurements, respectively. The obtained results are well in agreement with the nominal values reported in the manufacturer dosimeter specifications. A homogeneous response was observed over the whole device active area. Besides the one from the device active volume, no contributions from other components of the housing nor from encapsulation materials were\n\nSU-F-T-643: Feasibility of Performing Patient Specific VMAT QA On Single Linac for Plans Treated in Beam-Matched Elekta Agility Linacs\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLeung, R; Lee, V; Cheung, S\n\n2016-06-15\n\nPurpose: The increasing application of VMAT demands a more efficient workflow and QA solution. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of performing VMAT QA measurements on one linac for plans treated on other beam-matched Elekta Agility linacs. Methods: A single model was used to create 24 clinically approved VMAT plans (12 head-and-neck and 12 prostate using 6MV and 10MV respectively) on Pinnacle v9.10 (Philips, Einhoven, Netherlands). All head-and-neck plans were delivered on three beam-matched machines while all prostate cases were delivered on two beam-matched 10MV Agility machines. All plans were delivered onto PTW Octavius 4D phantom with 1500 detectormoreÂ Â» array (PTW, Freiburg, Germany). Reconstructed volume doses were then compared with the Pinnacle reference plans in Verisoft 6.1 under 3%/3mm gamma criteria at local dose. Plans were considered clinically acceptable if >90% of the voxels passing the gamma criteria. Results: All measurements were passed (3D gamma passing rate >90%) and the result shows that the mean difference of 3D gamma of 12 head-and-neck cases is 1.2% with standard deviation of 0.6%. While for prostate cases, the mean difference of 3D gamma is 0.9% with standard deviation of 0.7%. Maximum difference of 3D gamma of all measurements between beam-matched machines is less than 2.5%. The differences of passing rates between different machines were statistically insignificant (p>0.05). Conclusion. The result suggests that ther Conclusion: The result suggests that there exists a 3D gamma threshold, in our case 92.5%, above which the VMAT QA performed in any one of beam-matched machine will also pass in another one. Therefore, VMAT QA efficiency may be increased and phantom set up time can be saved by implementing such method. A constant performance across all beam matched machines must be maintained to make this QA approach feasible.Â«Â less\n\nImpact of the Medical Faculty on Study Success in Freiburg: Results from Graduate Surveys.\n\nPubMed\n\nBiller, Silke; Boeker, Martin; Fabry, GÃ¶tz; Giesler, Marianne\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUsing the data from graduate surveys, this study aims to analyze which factors related to teaching and learning at the Freiburg Faculty of Medicine can influence study success. Study success and the factors influencing it have long been the subject of investigation, with study success being measured in terms of easily quantifiable indicators (final grades, student satisfaction, etc.). In recent years, it has also frequently been assessed in terms of graduate competency levels. Graduate surveys are considered suitable instruments for measuring these dimensions of study success. Data from three Freiburg graduate surveys conducted one and a half years after graduation were drawn upon for the analysis. Study success was operationalized using four indicators: results on the written section of the M2 exam, self-assessment of medical expertise and scientific expertise, and student satisfaction. Using multiple regression analyses, the predictive power was calculated for selected variables, also measured by the graduate surveys, for the different study success indicators. It was possible to identify models that contribute slightly or moderately to the prediction of study success. The score earned on the university entrance qualification demonstrated itself to be the strongest predictor for forecasting the M2 written exam: R(2) is between 0.08 and 0.22 for the three surveys. Different variables specific to degree program structure and teaching are helpful for predicting medical expertise (R(2)=0.04-0.32) and student satisfaction (R(2)=0.12-0.35). The two variables, structure and curricular sequencing of the degree program and combination of theory and practice, show themselves to be significant, sample-invariant predictors (Î²-weight(Structure)=0.21-0.58, Î²-weight(Combination)=0.27-0.56). For scientific expertise, no sample-independent predictors could be determined. Factors describing teaching hardly provide any assistance when predicting the written M2 exam score, which\n\nReviews in Modern Astronomy: Vol. 17: The Sun and Planetary Systems - Paradigms for the Universe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchielicke, Reinhard E.\n\n2004-09-01\n\nVolume 17 continues the Reviews of Modern Astronomy with fourteen invited reviews and Highlight Contributions which were presented during the International Scientific Conference of the Society on \"The Sun and Planetary Systems\", held at Freiburg, Germany, September 15 to 20, 2003.

Also, we demonstrate commissioning and validation results of this method to the Eclipse treatment planning system (version 13.0.29) for a Sumitomo dedicated proton line scanning beam nozzle. Methods: The in-air spot profiles at five beam-axis positions (Â±200, Â±100 and 0 mm) were obtained in trigger mode using a MP3 Water tank (PTW-Freiburg) and a pinpoint ionization chamber (model 31014, PTW-Freiburg). Low dose envelope (belowmoreÂ Â» 1% of the center dose) of the spot profile at isocenter was obtained by repeated point measurements to minimize dosimetry uncertainty. The double Gaussian (DG) model was used to fit and obtain optimal Ï1, Ï2 and their corresponding weightings through our in-house MATLAB (Mathworks) program. Ï1, Ï2 were assumed to expand linearly along the beam axis from a virtual source position calculated by back projecting fitted sigmas from the single Gaussian (SG) model. Absolute doses in water were validated using an Advanced Markus chamber at the depth of 2cm with Pristine Peak (BP) R90d ranging from 5â32 cm for 10Ã10 cm2 scanned fields. The field size factors were verified with square fields from 2 to 20 cm at 2cm and before BP depth. Results: The absolute dose outputs were found to be within Â±3%. For field size factor, the agreement between calculated and measurement were within Â±2% at 2cm and Â±3% before BP, except for the field size below 2Ã2 cm2. Conclusion: The double Gaussian model was found to be sufficient for characterizing the Sumitomo dedicated proton line scanning nozzle. With our effective double Gaussian fitting method, we are able to save significant proton beam time with acceptable output accuracy.Â«Â less\n\nA diamond detector in the dosimetry of high-energy electron and photon beams.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaub, W U; Kaulich, T W; NÃ¼sslin, F\n\n1999-09-01\n\nA diamond detector type 60003 (PTW Freiburg) was examined for the purpose of dosimetry with 4-20 MeV electron beams and 4-25 MV photon beams. Results were compared with those obtained by using a Markus chamber for electron beams and an ionization chamber for photon beams. Dose distributions were measured in a water phantom with the detector connected to a Unidos electrometer (PTW Freiburg). After a pre-irradiation of about 5 Gy the diamond detector shows a stability in response which is better than that of an ionization chamber. The current of the diamond detector was measured under variation of photon beam dose rate between 0.1 and 7 Gy min(-1). Different FSDs were chosen. Furthermore the pulse repetition frequency and the depth of the detector were changed. The electron beam dose rate was varied between 0.23 and 4.6 Gy min(-1) by changing the pulse-repetition frequency. The response shows no energy dependence within the covered photon-beam energy range. Between 4 MeV and 18 MeV electron beam energy it shows only a small energy dependence of about 2%, as expected from theory. For smaller electron energies the response increases significantly and an influence of the contact material used for the diamond detector can be surmised. A slight sublinearity of the current and dose rate was found. Detector current and dose rate are related by the expression i alpha Ddelta, where i is the detector current, D is the dose rate and delta is a correction factor of approximately 0.963. Depth-dose curves of photon beams, measured with the diamond detector, show a slight overestimation compared with measurements with the ionization chamber. This overestimation is compensated for by the above correction term. The superior spatial resolution of the diamond detector leads to minor deviations between depth-dose curves of electron beams measured with a Markus chamber and a diamond detector.\n\nHigh Temperature Characteristics of Pt/TaSi2/Pt/W and Pt/Ti/W Diffusion Barrier Systems for Ohmic Contacts to 4H-SiC\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOkojie, Robert S.; Lukco, Dorothy\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe degradation of ohmic contacts to 4H-SiC pressure sensors over time at high temperature is primarily due to two failure mechanisms: migrating bond pad Au and atmospheric O toward the ohmic contact SiC interface and the inter-metallic mixing between diffusion barrier systems (DBS) and the underlying ohmic contact metallization. We investigated the effectiveness of Pt/TaSi2/Pt/W (DBS-A) and Pt/Ti/W (DBS-B) in preventing Au and O diffusion through the underlying binary Ti/W or alloyed W50:Ni50 ohmic contacts to 4H-SiC and the DBS ohmic contact intermixing at temperature up to 700 C.\n\nSilicon diodes as an alternative to diamond detectors for depth dose curves and profile measurements of photon and electron radiation.\n\nPubMed\n\nScherf, Christian; Peter, Christiane; Moog, Jussi; Licher, JÃ¶rg; Kara, Eugen; Zink, Klemens; RÃ¶del, Claus; Ramm, Ulla\n\n2009-08-01\n\nDepth dose curves and lateral dose profiles should correspond to relative dose to water in any measured point, what can be more or less satisfied with different detectors. Diamond as detector material has similar dosimetric properties like water. Silicon diodes and ionization chambers are also commonly used to acquire dose profiles. The authors compared dose profiles measured in an MP3 water phantom with a diamond detector 60003, unshielded and shielded silicon diodes 60008 and 60012 and a 0.125-cm(3) thimble chamber 233642 (PTW, Freiburg, Germany) for 6- and 25-MV photons. Electron beams of 6, 12 and 18 MeV were investigated with the diamond detector, the unshielded diode and a Markus chamber 23343. The unshielded diode revealed relative dose differences at the water surface below +10% for 6-MV and +4% for 25-MV photons compared to the diamond data. These values decreased to less than 1% within the first millimeters of water depth. The shielded diode was only required to obtain correct d"
