        "text": "C. Calculation of DMU\n\nIn NCCHE, the DMU measurement in a patient‐specific condition is made with a patient‐specific aperture collimator and a range compensator, as shown in . To derive the DMU in the patient‐specific conditions by calculation, we defined the DMU in the patient‐specific conditions (DMUcalc,clinical) as a product of the standard DMU (DMUmeas,STD) and a clinical beam delivering condition factor (Fcalc,clinical). The DMUmeas,STD is a DMU measured in our standard beam measurement (STD) conditions, as shown in . Details of the STD conditions are described in the . The Fcalc,clinical can be written by multiplication of three factors: a beam‐spreading device factor (FBSD), a patient‐specific device factor (FPSD), and a field‐size correction factor (FFS(A)) in the following way.\n\nThe subscripts STD, BSD, PSD, and FS in equations denote beam delivery and measurement conditions, respectively, as summarized in ; the prefixes, meas and calc, of the subscripts in the equations denote that the value was obtained by either measurement or calculation.\n\nThe FBSD represents the effect of commonly used devices, such as the first and second scatterers, a range shifter, and a SOBP filter, on the DMU. It is defined as a ratio of measured DMUs in the BSD condition, as shown in to that in the STD condition. In the BSD condition, while the beam spreading devices are set in the same way as in the patient‐specific condition, a patient‐specific aperture collimator is replaced by a standard collimator (a collimator with a square aperture of 185 × 185 mm2), and a range compensator is removed. The FBSD is obtained by measurements since the combination of parameters of commonly used devices are limited.\n\nThe FPSD represents the effects of custom‐made devices for an individual patient (a patient‐specific aperture collimator and a range compensator) and an air‐gap between the collimator and the patient surface on the DMU. It is defined as a ratio of calculated DMUs by using the SMC in the BSD condition to that in the PSD condition, as shown in . In the PSD condition, all devices are set at a patient‐specific condition."
