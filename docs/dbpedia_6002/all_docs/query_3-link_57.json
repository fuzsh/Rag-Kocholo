A big part of this in my mind is down to the environment and attitude the city fostered. With its bike riding and pedestrian-friendly vibe combined with the fact that it felt just the right size. Not too big and dangerous but also enough people to feel excited. It is also a very beautiful and sunny city. This combined with that IES gives us the freedom to learn while providing support and help to stay safe and enjoy. IES had the perfect balance of providing group activity but not restricting us or keeping us too busy. They understood that we would want to get out into the city and take risks. I appreciated how they showed us how to do this in the safest way possible and did not control us too much. IES did most of the hard work to make settling in very easy and the staff were very supportive and friendly. It felt like a family from day one. The classes and professors were all very good and I liked how they emphasized that we should be speaking German. All of this combined led me to enjoy and feel at home in Freiburg all while pushing my comfort zone and experiencing new things.\n\nIf you did this all over again, what's one thing you would change?\n\nPros\n\nGood balance of fun and academics\n\nPublic transpertation\n\nAmazing city and nature\n\n35 people found this review helpful.\n\nPeter\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nWonderful Study Abroad Experience\n\nI had an incredible experience with the IES Freiburg program! The academics were strong, with passionate professors and a well-rounded curriculum that deepened my understanding of Freiburg and taught in German. I was able to also take a course at the local university. Cultural immersion was a highlight, from city tours to staying in German student housing. The support system was excellent, and I formed lifelong friendships. The program's flexibility allowed me to explore Europe. Overall, it was a life-changing adventure that enriched my education and worldview. Highly recommended!\n\nPros\n\nSmall program\n\nBeautiful city\n\nGerman-language focus\n\nCons\n\nFar from airport\n\nMedical care limitations\n\nTypically one semester\n\n52 people found this review helpful.\n\nNatalia\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nA fantastic and worthwhile experience\n\nThe European Union semester that IES Abroad offers is very much worth the time, money, and energy spent to get there. The IES staff was extremely helpful in making us feel welcome, heard, and understood as students and as people in a wholly new area. The courses offered were enlightening and brought such an amazing perspective on the European Union and European politics/history in general. It has enabled us to think critically of what's in front of us, which is wholly important when you are speaking with a staff member within the European Union's institutions. Most of all, the trips that IES Abroad offered were simply amazing. It has offered us a healthy mixture of studying and actually immersing yourself in the new environment you're in. I have no regrets choosing IES Abroad for my study abroad experience.\n\nPros\n\nField trips - IES Abroad's European Union Semester offers around 22 days worth of trips as a group\n\nWellness Walks - The staff in Freiburg really do make sure to include you and make the program feel like a community\n\nThe classes - The professors were very informative and personable\n\nCons\n\nAt first, the work was somewhat difficult in terms of magnitude. This was quickly resolved when we shared our concerns with the Academic Dean, however\n\nField Trip activities - Sometimes you are put into something you don't originally want to do, yet everything planned serves a purpose!\n\n53 people found this review helpful.\n\nJackie\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nLife-Changing Experience in Freiburg\n\nThere's a cliché that study abroad changes your life, and I'm here to say that that is 100% true. The academic opportunities, travel experiences, and connections provided by the IES Abroad Freiburg program all made for a truly life-changing experience for me, and I cannot recommend this program enough.\n\nAcademically, this program expanded my interests in a variety of subjects, such as migration and human rights, and inspired me to pursue these interests beyond the end of my time in Freiburg. The course-load was also very manageable, allowing for me to actually engage with the topics and readings rather than worrying about weekly small assignments.\n\nI took part in the EU program offered by IES Abroad Freiburg, which included various course-related trips across Germany and Europe. These travel experiences gave me the opportunity to apply what I learned in the classroom IRL and allowed for me to bond with my professors and IES staff members outside of the classroom. Furthermore, these trips included free time to explore the cities, expanding my worldview.\n\nFinally, the connections I made as a result of this program are connections I will honestly cherish for the rest of my life. The friends I made are some of the best people I have met, and the professors and IES Freiburg staff members were and continue to be great mentors.\n\nNot only did I grow academically because of this program, but all of the traveling and connections I made have taught me an abundance of life lessons that I'll always hold dear to my heart. Study abroad with IES Abroad Freiburg, and I guarantee you won't regret it!\n\n98 people found this review helpful.\n\nEleyna\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nIES Abroad in Freiburg!\n\nI was in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany for three awesome weeks before I was sent home due to COVID-19. When I arrived I was greeted by a local German student who lived in my building. I had some time in my room to rest and unpack before meeting the group of IES students and student guides for dinner at a local restaurant. We got to know each other and made plans to find grocery stores, cook dinner, and explore the city together. I was nervous about making friends, but once I was there it was pretty obvious that everyone wanted to hang out with everyone, since we were all in the same boat. This sense of group support and connection continued throughout my time there, and we kept the group chat going even when the program went remote. I also became friends with one of my flatmates!\n\nOur classes didn't start until we had already gone home, so unfortunately we never met our professors in person. Online classes were difficult because all online classes are, but the professors were really wonderful about trying to make the experience less stressful. The IES Abroad staff gave us mixed signals about COVID-19, which is understandable given the unprecedented nature of the crisis, but it was incredibly frustrating and stressful for the students. Our on-site staff told us IES would never send us home, but that was not based on any real policy, so when the Chicago office sent us home we had no warning at all. However, staff changes were made after the fact and they let us know by email.\n\nAll in all, I had a great experience and I still miss my time in person with IES. If COVID-19 hadn't happened, it would have been perfect! I absolutely recommend going abroad with IES!\n\nWhat was the most nerve-racking moment and how did you overcome it?\n\nThe scariest moment was when we all found out we had to go home. It felt like there was a mad rush out of the country, and we all thought we were taking the virus home to our families. It was devastating to leave my friends and the city I had just fallen in love with. I spent the last few days with my friends, taking in as much of the city as we possibly could. The biggest source of support through the experience was the group chat with everyone in the program.\n\n165 people found this review helpful.\n\nTimmy\n\n4/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nSimple, Traditional, Amazing\n\nI loved my study abroad experience and I loved the area. Freiburg is a medium-big traditional German college town in the Black Forest. This means that there were a lot of typical German traditions with a mixture of a feeling of open-mindedness. Freiburg is amazing also in the sense that it is a city with a lot of environmentally conscious policies and goals, which means that people have the right of way above cars and cyclists in the downtown area.\n\nI learned a lot about myself when I was away from my support group and family that feels way different from college. I felt like an adult which is incredibly exciting. I also learned to be more open-minded because I got to see the many ways that Germany tries to help its future through the development of different renewable energies like Biogas and how there is a cab service that is free for women after a certain time.\n\nThe academics offered where tough courses that challenges students in their ability to understand and retain information in german. The academics offered where tough courses that challenges students in their ability to understand and retain information in german. That being said the spacing of everything was weird because of where they decided to place breaks. That made it so that Midterms happened 2 weeks before the final and most teachers did not give prompts for the final until the week before the final essay was due which was terrible. Everyone in the administration was very nice and very good at giving us helpful tips on how to feel less homesick and trying to get students out of their dorms and explore the general area.\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nFreiburg is a great city to have as a base to return to when traveling in Europe because it's always very calming and small. Often if your plans are to go to large cities that have a lot to offer and do having a medium-sized city to return helps with unwinding from weekends of traveling. Also, Freiburg's public transport is good for getting used to European public transport systems. Freiburg covers a large area and offers many modes of transport and train lines to get around which is helpful for when going to bigger cities that are difficult to navigate. For traveling Freiburg is a good location because of an amazing company called FlixBus. FlixBus is an incredibly cheap way to travel through Europe via Bus. Most trips cost around 30 euros less than the train like Deutsche Bahn. The buses come with wifi and a place to charge your phone. It's a really nice bus and because of Freiburg's placement in Europe, it's a 1-hour drive to France and Switzerland and 4 hours to München.\n\n154 people found this review helpful.\n\nJovanna\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nStudy Abroad Here!\n\nI had an amazing time while studying abroad in Freiburg, Germany for IES European Union Summer Study Abroad Program! I had the opportunity to travel to so many countries that I wouldn't have ventured to otherwise like Russia, Bosnia, and Serbia. I had lifelong connections with the other students that traveled abroad with me and I absolutely love the faculty and staff at this location. They were very supportive and inclusive to students of color and the unique struggles that they may experience abroad. The courses were definitely immersive and eyeopening, to say the least. The coursework is manageable and still gives you time to explore and enjoy your time abroad! This program will help you get out of comfort zone as it did for and genuinely contribute to tour growth. If you're thinking of studying abroad, I strongly encourage choosing this program!\n\nWhat would you improve about this program?\n\nI wish this program was advertised at more HBCUs. I was the only black student on my program and clearly the only student from an HBCU (Spelman College). I think if this program were advertised to more HBCUs I wouldn't have been in that situation.\n\n157 people found this review helpful.\n\nRena\n\n4/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\n22 Cities & 12 Countries!\n\nAs I boarded the plane for Munich, I was anxious to discover what awaited me. I had quite a few concerns and reservations, but upon arrival I realized all of my concerns were anticipated by the program administration. I lived in an apartment complex with five German students, who became some of my closest friends in Freiburg. The program gave us many opportunities to befriend fellow IES students and German students, alike. We spent the semester eating $1 gelato, traveling between EU countries, and exploring all Freiburg has to offer. I overcame my fear of public speaking and formed really strong connections with many of my professors over the course of the semester. I had a wonderful experience, one filled with both personal and academic accomplishments. I highly recommend studying in Freiburg!\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nBudget wisely! You'll blow through your money quickly unless you take the time to sort out your finances at the start of the program.\n\n146 people found this review helpful.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nAlumni Interviews\n\nThese are in-depth Q&A sessions with verified alumni.\n\nMyiah S. Smith\n\nWhy did you choose this program?\n\nI choose IES Freiburg for a number of reasons over IES Berlin: because Freiburg was considered the “Green City of Germany”, and as a Culture and Politics major concentrating in Ecology & Fine Arts, it seemed appropriate to place myself in a leading city of ecological and green values.\n\nI also remember as an adolescent reading about the Black Forest and the German Alps, and I was in awe with the deep green trees set against the foggy backdrop of the forest. I fell in love with the photos, and knew that one day I would hike through them. Never did I imagine I’d study forestry of the Black Forest and Swiss/German Alps! As a native Washingtonian, I also welcomed the allure of a slower pace city with an opened mind. Rest assured that IES Freiburg was my best choice!\n\nWhat did your program provider assist you with, and what did you have to organize on your own?\n\nUsing the extensive abroad search and application profile provided by GU’s Office of Global Studies, I was able to utilize the resources to find a program perfect for my studies and interest. When I found IES Freiburg, only the Language and Area Program was available as an option. I then positioned my school, working alongside my dean and abroad advisor to add IES Freiburg Environmental Studies Program. In doing so, I was able to petition and get approved for a dual semester study abroad with two separate IES Freiburg programs. I appreciated the flexibility and assistance in the process.\n\nView Entire Interview\n\nWhat is one piece of advice you'd give to someone going on your program?\n\nI recommend IES Freiburg to those who are interested in the Environment, the European Union and politics, or those who are interested in German language and area studies. IES Freiburg is perfect if you like hands on learning with lots of trips, executions and activities. If you prefer programs which give you the range to explore and experience without the burden of overhead requirements and checklist, then this is perfect for you. IES Freiburg balances studies, program sponsored trips, monthly events, and a 24/7 on call staff that you are free to access at your discretion. Have fun and learn a lot!\n\nRequest what you want and advocate for your needs. Speak to a former participant, because IES Freiburg allows you to request specific housing (even rooms if available), so if you know where you want to live, kindly ask they place you there. Same goes for classes. Even if you get on site and find what you're studying no longer fills that annoying school requirement, request to switch out! Study up on what IES Freiburg has to offer, and don't be afraid to ask for something else!\n\nWhat does an average day/week look like as a participant of this program?\n\nI spent the weekdays in class, waking up at 8am (I am NOT a morning person) to catch the 8:28 tram (I'm very quick) into the city center of Freiburg, Germany. I’d make it to my 9am and spend the time engaging on theories about urban planning and the human scale, how to accomplish the three pillars of economic, social and environmental sustainability, and have deep discussions about human behavior and its impacts on the environment. I’d often be done with class no later than 2pm.\n\nMy class schedule varied greatly, because our program (IES ES) was set with intensive three week courses divided into 5 modules. Each module class typically started at 9am, but day to day it varied. Some days class would end at 12pm and start again at 3pm, and other days there’d be a full day trip. I enjoyed the variability because there wasn’t much of a dull day in class!\n\nAfter class was complete, I'd often grab a Doner with friends and talk about our day in class or our weekend plans. I’d return back to my student housing complex where I’d complete homework (if any) with other IES students. On Wednesday evenings, I would cook dinner with a friend I made from the other IES (Lang & Area) Freiburg program with his cohort of friends. On Thursdays, I would cook community dinner at the student housing complex. I usually cooked dinner once every week with a friend. If we weren’t cooking we’d have Netflix movie nights in the lounge and snack on German chips and cookies. Sometimes we'd go out during the week to grocery shop together, or go to the various markets. We’d explore the city, try new foods, explored new parks and ride random tram lines back and forth.\n\nOn the weekend, I was out dancing. I love to dance, and my close friend did too. Nearly every Friday, ladies night at Mamita Dance Club meant we'd get in for free. I’d spend the evening swaying, dancing bachata, and laughing all night. Such a great work out! On Saturday I’d sleep in to catch up on the mornings spent up before 11am during the week. Some Saturdays I’d go to the flea market, other days I would cook brunch with the IES students. The weekends consisted of chill outings, homemade food and deep discussions about the future, our hopes for the world, and what we’d do next weekend.\n\nHere and there IES Freiburg arranged non-academic and academic weekend trips (which entailed a lot of hiking for the IES ES students). I managed to travel to three other cities while studying abroad in Germany in my free time with other students. I visited a total of four out of country cities, and 2 cities during my time in German (all without missing class time)!\n\nGoing into your experience abroad, what was your biggest fear, and how did you overcome it? How did your views on the issue change?\n\nI knew before getting to Freiburg that the ES program would be very physically intensive, and it was. the first week was the hardest week, with the most amount of hiking. After getting accustomed to the lifestyle, I was able to adjust. Instead of taking the tram to class, I wish I had the courage to ride the $20 auction bike I had purchased. I solemnly rode it, despite Freiburg being a bike and pedestrian friendly city (like really, the city is actually designed around the pedestrian, not the car). I shouldn’t have allowed my hesitance to get into the way of the commute I’m sure I would have enjoyed. Besides, I could have saved the ticket money and spent it on a trip or execution. This spring I’ll be sure to ride my bike to class!\n\nHow was the living accommodation?\n\nI loved my housing placement, and IES filled my initial housing request, a mini apartment place all to myself! It had a bedroom space with floor length windows, a large closet, a full bed, a desk with chair, and a table complete with seating. I also really enjoyed my electric ceramic stove top, and the microwave was very much like an oven (it cooked pizza and fried fish sticks too!). My bathroom had a shower and standard utilities. It was a spacious accommodation, not too large or too small. I was happy that it was all mine that semester!\n\nThe housing complex, the FIZZ, consisted of single student apartments. There was a lounge space, laundry, and study rooms in each building. The tenant assistants, and the kitchen were on the main floor of the main building, where I was housed. The tram stop was right outside the door, making commutes to class and into the city very effortless! I really enjoyed the community, which consisted of university students and professors, they were a very vibrant bunch!\n\nStaff Interviews\n\nThese are in-depth Q&A sessions with program leaders.\n\nMichael Green\n\nWhat position do you hold at IES Abroad and what has been your career path?\n\nMichael: I am the Associate Vice President for College Relations. I knew I wanted to work in the field of study abroad from the day I returned from my first study abroad experience. It took me a few years to get into the field. I started out working in college admissions and enjoyed that. Eventually I did some international admissions work, then went to grad school at the Monterey Institute. Right out of grad school, I worked in business development for IIE in their San Francisco office. All of this led to my work with IES Abroad and I’ve been here nearly 11 years.\n\nDid YOU study abroad?! If so, where and what inspired you to go?\n\nMichael: I spent my junior year at Aberdeen University in Scotland on a program through the Great Lakes Colleges Association. It was a direct enrollment program that required you to be there for a full year. I truly loved it. I don’t think one particular thing inspired me to go.\n\nAs a kid I was always fascinated by far away things, starting with the kids on the other side of town. That fascination grew to make me want to know about people on the other side of the planet. My family heritage goes back to Scotland so I targeted it as my first international experience. I had a second study abroad experience in graduate school where I spent a summer studying and working in Russia.\n\nWhat is a setback for students, and how can they overcome it?\n\nMichael: Money seems to be the biggest challenge for students. I think that can in some ways be overcome when they select an undergraduate institution. They should carefully explore study abroad options and try to understand the financial support a school will provide when they study abroad. Many schools have generous financial aid policies that really incentivize going abroad.\n\nDescribe a situation where you felt proud to be a part of the IES team.\n\nMichael: The folks at IES Abroad are all thoughtful and hard-working people. They are truly student focused and our decision making is based on high academic standards and a commitment to the health and well-being of students. One of the things I am most proud of about working here is the way we handle crisis. I am a member of the crisis management team and over the years we have been tested by international events such as earthquakes, flu viruses, and nuclear accidents. When called on – the team responds with thoughtful decision making and execution of our plan that always puts students’ safety and well-being first, along with constant communication to parents and to schools. This is a result of good preparation and communication.\n\nWhat is the biggest struggle facing the study abroad industry today?\n\nMichael: I think study abroad faces the same struggle that higher education in general faces – the cost of attendance. The cost of higher education has grown faster than the rate of inflation for years and that is a problem for our society. IES Abroad has worked hard to be able to provide high quality, academically rigorous, study abroad programming at a cost that delivers value to students and the schools that send them on our programming. We’ve also developed customized programming for schools that want to provide shorter term programming in order to make study abroad accessible to a broad range of students.\n\nAbout IES Abroad\n\nIES Abroad offers 140 programs worldwide for college students. We are a highly charged force of study abroad enthusiasts. Every day we have the privilege of witnessing how study abroad changes our students’ lives. We also believe that every student should have the opportunity to go abroad—especially in a fun, safe, and superior academic and...\n\nOther Programs You Might Like\n\n103 reviews\n\n\n\n\n\nIES Abroad\n\nIES Abroad London\n\nEngland\n\n4.93 •103 reviews\n\nStudy abroad in London and discover all that this world-class, multi...\n\n99 reviews\n\n\n\n\n\nIES Abroad\n\nIES Abroad Madrid\n\nSpain\n\n4.94 •99 reviews\n\nMadrid will be your classroom.
