        "text": "With dizzying swarms of cyclists darting here and there, trams sliding past on polished rails and climate stickers adorning every available lamppost, it’s easy to see why Freiburg has been named Germany’s eco capital. I was often impressed by examples of the city’s forward-thinking when studying there on my Year Abroad. Could UK cities take a leaf out of Freiburg’s book?\n\nThe first thing that strikes you upon arrival is the cyclists (especially if you don’t look before crossing the road). Freiburg has an impressive number of them: 34% of its traffic is pedal powered. A mere 21 % is motorised, while the rest is made up of walkers and public transport users. But this dedication to green transport did not happen by itself. The city has implemented various policies to make leaving the car at home possible. For a start, they have tried to restrict urban sprawl, keeping it a ‘Stadt der kürzen Wege’ (city of short distances) to ensure transportation without perspiration for cyclists. Cycle paths/ lanes appeared alongside most roads I came across, and many of the streets in the centre were car-free. They’ve also got a hire bike system (Frelo) for those who don’t have their own. While hire bike stations are hardly unique to Freiburg, what did pique my interest was the rentable cargo bikes offered alongside normal ones, which could allow users to carry loads normally requiring a car boot. The Freiburgers were nothing if not inventive in this regard… I saw someone transporting a cello via bike, someone cycling along with another bike slung over their shoulder, and even someone dragging along a sofa on a bike trailer.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing idea I found to encourage cycling, however, was a kilometre currency system. While Freiburg is one of 15 German cities currently using Deutsche Bahn’s app and thus is not unique here either, I was still impressed enough to find it worth mentioning. Cyclists could track the number of kilometres they cycled round the city using an app and exchange these kilometres for vouchers. These vouchers could then be used get discounts off purchases at local shops. Sadly, I didn’t find out about it until the end of the year, so couldn’t profit from it, but I could at least admire the idea. It was good to see that people were given a positive incentive to cycle, instead of simply being discouraged from getting behind the wheel.\n\nThe cyclists cannot take all the credit for the city’s eco reputation, however. As a student I was both grateful for and impressed by the price of public transport. Everything is integrated; busses, trams and trains, so you can buy one ticket for all at a reasonable price. A semester ticket allowed you to go anywhere in the local area by whatever form of public transport you wished for 89 euros per semester (apart from bike rentals, though you still got discounts). As a plus, they had electric busses, further reducing emissions. Trams came regularly (every 4-6 minutes from where I was living) and offered an easy, sustainable way to get around the city if you didn’t have a bike or if it was too wet to cycle.\n\nTransport aside, my research post Year Abroad revealed the extent of the city’s commitment to solar power. As Germany’s sunniest city, it is in prime position for this. The city council building had solar panels plastered to every available patch of wall, making it Europe’s biggest public net-zero energy building. While it wasn’t perhaps the most beautiful building to look at, it certainly got top marks for innovation. It turns out that Freiburg also has at least 100 businesses in solar power, making green energy a key contributor to the local economy.\n\nYet with sunshine come shadows. Known as Germany’s Tuscany, Freiburg attracts sunseekers from across the country. The city struggles to cope with the steady flow of internal migration, which poses a threat to its attempts to restrict urban sprawl. Between Freiburg and Offenburg, only 18 km of undeveloped land now remain, with 50 km surrendered to bricks and mortar. Of particular concern is the development of the Mooswald, a species-rich woodland on the western edge of the city, sometimes termed the rainforest of Baden-Württemberg. Although the city council promises that inner city development is prioritised over the greenbelt, and new neighbourhoods are normally built according to environmentally friendly principles (e.g. passive heating), a green design cannot hope to replace the lost green of the surrounding woodland.\n\nOf course, it’s difficult to find a solution to the population growth, and speaking to fellow students, the need for affordable rentals is clearly strong. Many were still living with parents or even commuting from Switzerland because they couldn’t find a flat to rent. But still, the city’s expansion does beg the question as to how easy it will be to preserve the city’s Stadt der kürzen Wege approach. A smaller city means it’s easy to get to places by bike, but will this continue to be the case as it expands?\n\nFurthermore, Freiburg’s commitment to low-emission transport is perhaps not as strong as it first appears. For example, plans for a new Autobahn in the area are set to go ahead. Although Germany’s focus on road building in its 2030 transport plan have been criticised, given that 20% of the county’s greenhouse gases come from transport, the criticism appears to have fallen on deaf ears. And for a region that is supposed to be so set on sustainability, it’s disappointing to see it supporting this fossil-fuel friendly project.\n\nTravelling through the city’s surrounding farmland provided considerable food for thought, too. Back home in South-West England, I’m used to seeing hedgerows bordering small fields, and know how important they are for wildlife. Local farms, however, appeared to take the same approach as I have often seen in France – with large, monotonous fields stretching outwards without the slightest hint of a bush to separate them. I couldn’t help but feel they were missing something important. Unused grassland was also regularly strimmed, when it would have been better off tended by the hand of nature. A monoculture of neatly cut grass doesn’t leave much room for local wildlife…\n\nNevertheless, I was still mightily impressed by the Black Forest capital’s efforts to follow a sustainable lifestyle. While it doesn’t do everything perfectly and my time there did make me appreciate the UK’s hedgerows, there’s still plenty we could learn from it. The cycling culture, investment in green energy and public transport system offer a good example of how cities can be designed with the climate in mind, and I hope that one day more of our own cities can make sustainable commutes as accessible as they were there.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.bund-rvso.de/freiburg-oekohauptstadt-umwelthauptstadt.html\n\nhttps://www.freiburg.de/pb/231648.html\n\nhttps://www.freiburg.de/pb/234744.html\n\nhttps://www.mitwelt.org/breisgau-suedbaden-flaechenverbrauch.html\n\nhttps://www.freiburg.de/pb/,Lde/232753.html\n\nhttps://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?204416/Freiburg-Solar-Region\n\nhttps://www.energie-experten.org/projekte/freiburger-rathaus-ist-dank-pv-netto-nullenergiegebaeude\n\nhttps://www.mitwelt.org/ausbau-a5-autobahn-verkehr.html"
