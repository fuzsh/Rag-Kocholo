        "text": "RHEINTACHO is expanding\n\nRHEINTACHO Messtechnik GmbH headquarters in Freiburg and their components production site in Chropynè in the Czech Republic (east of Brno) are expanding. The expansion in Freiburg will create additional production capacity as well as optimising logistical procedures.\n\nThe opportunity to expand the premises arose at a location directly next to the current company premises in the industrial area of Freiburg, Haid. The family business, which has been in existence for 115 years, simply could not miss this unique opportunity. Thanks to the additional premises, logistical procedures can be newly set up and will be established for future demand. The additional premises will also provide the opportunity to construct internal production and assembly systems to an optimum standard for new product lines that are in development as well as ensuring the flow of materials in the future.\n\nFollowing their previous expansion in 2009, this is now the next step on a long-term path. It is also a clear commitment of the family company to autonomy and to Freiburg as their location.\n\nAt the same time, the plans for additional production capacity at P+P Technik s.r.o in Chropynè , Czech Republic, are in the final stages. RHEINTACHO has been involved with this company for quite some time. P+P Technik s.r.o supplies components for various products of RHEINTACHO Messtechnik GmbH in Freiburg. The development of the Czech facility will not only allow for production capacity development, but it will also increase the product range and create space for the installation of new manufacturing systems."
