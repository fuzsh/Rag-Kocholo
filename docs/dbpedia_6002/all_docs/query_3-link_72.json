        "text": "The University of Freiburg pursues ambitious sustainability goals in all areas: in research and teaching, in operations and governance.\n\nWhat this means, for example, is that researchers examine sustainability in a broad range of disciplines. And they pass their knowledge on to students in lectures and seminars. All students have the opportunity to be exposed to sustainability issues, whether in a single course, a sustainability-focused degree program, or a cross-disciplinary course of study. And the university itself is of course also making efforts to become more sustainable: by gradually becoming more climate-neutral, but also by creating a healthy environment in which its members can develop freely.\n\nThe university maintains contact with society in all these efforts, whether in the form of applied technical or social innovation or in the form of knowledge transfer.\n\nHere are just a few concrete examples of what sustainability looks like at the University of Freiburg:\n\nNews: The Latest on Sustainability Issues\n\nSustainability Report\n\nThe preparation of the report, as well as the coordination of sustainability activities and the further development of the corporate sustainability strategy, are the responsibility of the university’s sustainability manager.\n\nThe first sustainability report of the university is published as ePaper and also available as pdf: Sustainability Report 2021 of the University of Freiburg.\n\nSpotlight: Sustainability Council\n\nThe Sustainability Council is one of ten working groups in which members of the university are discussing questions of the future in an open, participatory think tank format.\n\nThe Sustainability Council identified the following goals for the university in its first phase of work:\n\ndeveloping a profile in the area of sustainability\n\nsetting and prioritizing goals for operational sustainability\n\nraising awareness for sustainability in research\n\nintroducing cross-disciplinary courses on the topic of sustainability\n\nincluding networks in the transformation processes\n\nenhancing the University of Freiburg’s (international) visibility as a sustainability university\n\nThe Sustainability Council stands in a tradition that is already well established in Freiburg: An initial “sustainable university” working group was established as early as 2005.\n\nSustainability in Research\n\nThe University of Freiburg is one of the most research-intensive institutions for sustainability research in Germany, with steadily increasing international visibility. This is reflected in our performance in the areas of publications and third-party funding, particularly in relation to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) “good health and well-being” (goal 3), “sustainable cities and communities” (goal 11), “climate action” (goal 13), and “life on land” (goal 15).\n\nSustainability is firmly embedded in the University of Freiburg’s research profile with the key research area ‘Pathways to Sustainability’.\n\nThere are currently more than fifty professorships with a sustainability focus at the University of Freiburg – and they extend across a wide range of faculties.\n\nSustainability research at the University of Freiburg is innovative, interdisciplinary, and international. It reflects the university’s broad understanding of the topic, in which the social, economic, and ecological aspects of sustainability are inextricably linked.\n\nThe Young Academy for Sustainability Research, for example, has been bringing together international postdocs from different disciplines in a novel format since its founding in 2021.\n\nThe Environmental Humanities initiative, launched on the basis of a FRIAS research focus on interdisciplinary resilience research, is devoted to sustainability issues from a humanities and social sciences perspective.\n\nThe new research group Transformational Sustainability Science aims to further develop transformative sustainability science in teaching and research. To this end, it develops methodological foundations and engages in empirical research.\n\nSpotlight: Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources\n\nResearch Group Transformational Sustainability\n\nThe University of Freiburg has created the research group Transformational Sustainability Science in collaboration with the newly established Humboldt Professorship for Sustainable Food Systems. The group is currently being set up under the leadership of Dr. Katja Brundiers (co-leader) and Prof. Dr. Arnim Wiek (co-leader), with doctoral students Alex Ramey and Susila Bhagavathula. The group aims to further develop transformative sustainability science in teaching and research at the University of Freiburg. To this end, it develops methodological foundations and engages in empirical research, particularly in the areas of the food economy and disasters (with a focus on heat). This is achieved through close co-operation with research institutions on sustainability at the University of Freiburg, in Germany, the USA and worldwide.\n\nJoint Research Projects with a Sustainability Focus\n\nCluster of Excellence livMatS: Materials Systems Inspired by Nature\n\nThe livMatS Pavilion at the Botanical Garden is a model for a novel materials system and the possibilities it opens up for sustainable construction: The pavilion illustrates how it becomes possible to create unique bioinspired architecture by combining natural materials with advanced digital technologies.\n\nCluster of Excellence CIBSS: Deciphering the Language of Life\n\nCollaborative Research Center ECOSENSE: Forest Ecosystems and Climate Change\n\nResearch Training Group ConFoBi: Forest Biodiversity\n\nSustainability in Studies & Teaching\n\nA wide range of degree programs across the faculties at the University of Freiburg bear a direct or indirect relation to sustainability. We are increasing the capacity of the programs in order to meet the high demand for these fields of study. In addition, we are constantly developing new programs.\n\nBelow you will find a selection of degree programs with a sustainability focus:\n\nSustainability doesn’t only play a role in relevant degree programs – the range of sustainability-related courses has grown across all fields of study in recent years.\n\nIn the context of its European university alliances, the University of Freiburg is also promoting sustainability as a core topic of the joint course offerings with its partner universities from the European confederations. Learn more in the section Cross-Border Sustainability.\n\nSpotlight: Sustainability Certificate\n\nStudent Involvement in Sustainability\n\nUniversity of Freiburg students have been involved for many years in numerous university groups on sustainability issues and several General Student Committee departments, e.g., the Environmental Department. The Sustainability Office Initiative has been collecting student ideas for a social-ecological university environment since 2018. Many students are also involved in numerous sustainability issues, from BUND to Weitblick, which are part of the Freiburg sustainability network.\n\nOnce a year, the student Sustainability Office coordinates the University Sustainability Days: Numerous student initiatives collaborate to put together a diverse program of workshops, lectures, panel discussions, and artistic action on the topic of sustainability, aimed at both students and the general public.\n\nSustainability Transfer\n\nInspiration from technology is indispensable in the area of sustainability, whether it’s about green technologies or the efficiency of political measures. At the same time, research is dependent on thought-provoking impulses from outside the university. Sustainability transfer means creating dialogue platforms on which science can enter into exchange with politics, business, and society. This concerns the transfer of research, technology, and knowledge.\n\nResearch and Technology Transfer\n\nSustainability Innovation Campus\n\nThe Sustainability Innovation Campus (ICN) is a joint initiative by the University of Freiburg (UFR) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), starting in 2024. Under the guiding principle “Transformations for Urban Regions of the Future: Climate Protection, Resource Conservation, and Well-Being“, the two universities are setting their sights on comprehensive social, technical, and economic innovations – along with a network of actors from science, industry, politics, administration, and civil society. Through this innovation ecosystem, the ICN aims to contribute to accelerating the transfer of innovations in the Upper Rhine region and thus to the ‘great transformation’ towards a sustainable society.\n\nCurrently, the Sustainability Innovation Campus is looking for start-up projects. Scientists from the University of Freiburg, KIT and cooperating universities and research institutions are invited to submit their project outlines by 30 November 2023. Details can be found in the official call for proposals.\n\nSustainability Center Freiburg (LZN)\n\nAt the Sustainability Center Freiburg (LZN), scientists translate findings from sustainability research into innovations. The LZN provides the infrastructure for the path to practice. The University of Freiburg and the five Freiburg Fraunhofer Institutes have been cooperating at the center since 2015. At the LZN, scientists from all these institutions investigate solutions for sustainable development together, from foundations to practical applications.\n\nLiving Labs on Sustainability Issues\n\nLiving labs on sustainability issues have almost become a tradition at the University of Freiburg: From 2015 to 2020, the project “Knowledge Dialogue Northern Black Forest” studied what opportunities the Black Forest National Park presents for the sustainable development of the entire region.\n\nTo the findings from five years of work at the living lab.\n\nThe next living lab, “Upper Rhine Innovation Region,” is currently being planned – find out more in the section Cross-Border Sustainability.\n\nKnowledge Transfer\n\nNumerous formats, like Studium Generale or Freiburg Horizons, cover sustainability issues in their regular programs.\n\nAn aspect of knowledge transfer that receives special attention is the dialogue with other stakeholders, such as the city. For example, “Freiburg 2038 – How We’re Preparing for Climate Change” was the topic of a FRIAS Fireside Chat with Freiburg’s Mayor Martin Horn.\n\nAnother means of fostering regular exchange between science and the city is the Freiburg Sustainability Council, in which Prof. Dr. Daniela Kleinschmit represents the University of Freiburg. The Sustainability Council supports the development and implementation of the municipal sustainability strategy in an advisory capacity.\n\nIn addition, Freiburg professors are involved individually in advisory boards and committees at the state and federal level.\n\nSustainable Operations: The University As a Living Lab\n\nFor more than twenty years, the University of Freiburg has repeatedly broken new ground with new ideas on how to expand operational sustainability and fulfill its function of setting an example in society.\n\nThe University as a Sustainable Place to Study and Work\n\nThe university should provide students and staff an environment that is attractive and participative in the long term. What this involves above all is an inclusive university culture that fosters diversity and creativity. Safe and healthy workplaces belong to a sustainable university, as do gender equality, family friendliness, and respect.\n\nMaintaining and continuously developing a sustainable place to study and work involves a large variety of large and small measures, from low-threshold offerings like workplace exercise during lunch break to institutional measures like the Family Service and Gender and Diversity Monitoring, with which university makes its own efforts in this area transparent.\n\nNumerous members of the university regularly make an active contribution, for example on the Day of Diversity or on Mental Health Day.\n\nThe Goal: A Climate-Neutral University\n\nThe university is currently pursuing the ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 at the latest. The Climate Protection Plan recently passed by the Rectorate contains clear and concrete measures with which the goals laid out in the Climate Change Act of the German federal government can be reached. The university’s Climate Protection Plan outlines both individual large-scale flagship projects, such as a new climate-neutral building for the Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources, and the improvement of energy efficiency in the university’s existing building stock.\n\nThe University of Freiburg has been measuring and documenting energy balances annually since 2009, retroactively from 2004 on.\n\nThe university has also published an annual environmental report since 2018.\n\nThe publication of the university’s first sustainability report is currently in preparation. The preparation of the report, as well as the coordination of sustainability activities and the further development of the operational sustainability strategy, are the responsibility of the university’s sustainability manager.\n\nSustainable University of Freiburg Work Group\n\nFrom environmental reports to the climate protection plan, from sustainable procurement to a mobility survey among employees:\n\nMany threads of operational sustainability converge in the Sustainable University Work Group. The members include employees from various relevant administrative departments and offices, staff councils, student representatives, and members of student sustainability initiatives.\n\nThe University of Freiburg has received numerous distinctions for its sustainability efforts since the founding of the work group in 2005, such as the Öko-Verkehrs-Siegel, the Environmental Award of the City of Freiburg, and the MobilSiegel.\n\nSpotlight: Hazardous Waste\n\nThe University of Freiburg’s reusable hazardous waste management system was introduced in 2001 and has led to major environmental and economic benefits as well as significantly fewer occupational accidents in this area. This system saves a considerable amount of material and reduces carbon emissions through the use of reusable canisters and reusable barrels. The university saved 78 tons of CO2 in this way in 2020. The University of Freiburg’s environmentally friendly hazardous waste management system has already been described in an article in the Journal of Environmental Safety.\n\nCross-Border Sustainability\n\nSustainability plays a central role in the University of Freiburg’s university alliances, whether in teaching projects (see Spotlight: Sustainability @EPICUR), in the conception of new degree programs (e.g., European Master in Continental Water Sustainability), or in the cross-border living lab “Upper Rhine Carbon-Neutral Innovation Region” currently in planning: This project seeks, through research expertise and in exchange with business, politics, and civil society, to transform the area around the decommissioned Fessenheim nuclear power plant into a pilot for an innovative, greenhouse emission-free economic region on the basis of a sustainable energy and transport concept.\n\nThe living lab is being planned within the context and Upper Rhine Cluster for Sustainability Research and was approved for funding in September 2022.\n\nThe Eucor Sustainability Focus Area, piloted by the University of Freiburg, encompasses all fields of the topic: research and teaching, transfer and infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022, for example, around thirty researchers from the Eucor universities (Basel, Freiburg, Karlsruhe, Mulhouse, Strasbourg) met to exchange ideas on their research about transformative cities, to network, and to initiate new research projects.\n\nIn the field of transfer, the existing Eucor city network has been addressing the topic of sustainability and possible city–university partnerships in a working group since 2022.\n\nIn the coming years (2023, 2024), the University of Freiburg will hold two transdisciplinary summer schools focusing on sustainability in collaboration with the Eucor alliance, the Öko-Institut e.V., and further partners. The Trinational Summer School 2023 will give students and doctoral candidates from the Eucor region the opportunity to experiment with transdisciplinary research formats using the example of climate adaptation of cities and municipalities.\n\nIn teaching, the existing sustainability certificate courses in Basel, Freiburg, and Karlsruhe will be open to students of all three institutions starting in fall 2022.\n\nSpotlight: Sustainability @ EPICUR\n\nThe University College Freiburg is coordinating the field of ecological and social sustainability in teaching for EPICUR. The alliance has already offered twenty-two digital courses on sustainability topics at all nine EPICUR universities since the project was launched in November 2019. In some cases, this involved the creation of entirely new lecture courses and seminars through cooperation between different teachers and team-teaching formats. An example is the University College Freiburg course “Sustainable Cities” (Dr. Sabine Sané), which uses international student exchange to go on “virtual field trips” and discuss what makes up a sustainable city."
