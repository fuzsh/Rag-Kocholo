        "text": "With around 14,000 employees, the University Medical Centre Freiburg is one of the largest of its kind in Germany and the biggest employer in the region. Freiburg also helps the Upper Rhine region take Germany’s top spot in the field of health management: around 60,000 people (22%) are employed by the numerous institutions, research facilities and companies, with 35,000 in Freiburg alone. Health tourism is booming as a result. With around 10.5 million overnight stays a year, of which 1.6 million are in Freiburg, the region is the most popular German travel destination and has a growing proportion of health-related travel.\n\nState-of-the-art medicine and entrepreneurship meet environmental awareness and a high standard of living in Green City Freiburg. HealthRegion Freiburg is unique in every respect – especially well-suited for a perfectly networked congress on medical or healthcare-related topics.\n\nEnvironmental politics, solar technology, sustainability and climate protection are the driving forces of the economic, political and urban development, which garners attention from an international audience. Science and the economy work in close partnership, for example at the Sustainability Center Freiburg, which is a collaboration between the University of Freiburg and the Fraunhofer Institutes.\n\nSustainability plays a special role in Green City Freiburg. With a 12,000-strong workforce in 2,000 companies, this sector contributes around EUR 650 million in value creation and plays a decisive part in the image of Green City Freiburg. In the solar industry alone, over 2,000 people are employed at 100 companies – three to four times more than the national average.\n\nGreen City Freiburg is the ideal location for congresses focusing on environmental and sustainability issues. As well as featuring conference locations that are suitable for ‘green’ meetings, Freiburg also offers a large audience of specialists from industry and research. Local research clusters will provide you with fascinating collaboration partners and speakers for your congress."
