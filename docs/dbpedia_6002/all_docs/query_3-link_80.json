        "text": "For more and more of us, living in the city is the norm. Globally, it is already more than half of the entire population. And the trend is on the rise. At the same time, we are developing a growing environmental awareness and a desire to live in a way that is as climate-friendly as possible.\n\nBoth together result in a major challenge that not only the fast-growing Asian, African and Latin American metropolises are facing, but also the European and North American cities. Thus, many urban developers (and ourselves) are looking at the task of making the growing urban spaces sustainable.\n\nWhat is sustainable development?\n\nSustainable urban development aims to minimize the barriers for us residents to live an environmentally friendly and socially responsible lifestyle. This means, first and foremost, that infrastructure is designed for pedestrians and cyclists and that public transport is expanded so that it is easy to stop using the car.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly projects are promoted and new green spaces are created, improving not only the microclimate and air quality in the city. You probably are familiar with this from your home town: These green oases also serve as meeting places and create space for a picnic with friends, for sports, music or simply for recreation.\n\nBuilding affordable housing is also part of sustainable urban development, as is the efficient use of existing land. The latter prevents the city from expanding further into the surrounding countryside, which would destroy ecosystems there. This means that abandoned inner-city areas are used for new buildings and vacant buildings are converted. In some cities, especially in Asia, some buildings are even built on top of existing structures, e.g., housing on flat roofs of parking garages. When building new constructions, sustainable urban planning focuses on recyclable, preferably renewable materials. This avoids waste and protects the environment.\n\nCities of the future\n\nOf course, there is much more to the sustainable development of urban areas than what we have touched on here. Where many people come together and face challenges, new ideas are born. Large cities and metropolitan areas have always been drivers of innovation and new developments, also in terms of sustainability. A sustainable city provides a high quality of life. But there is no such thing as a universal solution. Keep your eyes open at home. You‚Äôll see that different approaches are being experimented with everywhere. Sometimes they are profound and overarching, sometimes they are individual actions, projects or places, and sometimes the future is already here.\n\nSustainability on all levels in Milan\n\nPorta Nuova with Bosco Vertikale\n\nThe Porta Nuova district has reshaped Milan‚Äôs skyline. On an industrial site that had long been out of use in the middle of the northern Italian metropolis, a completely new district was created that invites people to stroll, relax and socialize. The empty, crumbling factory buildings have been replaced by high-rises designed by various architects. Not very sustainable, you might think, except for the fact that they were built inside the city limits and not outside. But: one of these skyscrapers is a model for biodiversity in urban spaces: Bosco Vertikale, the vertical forest.\n\nThe twin towers are 110 and 76 meters high and completely covered with vegetation. In the photo, they look more like a photomontage, don‚Äôt they? Almost 800 trees, 4500 shrubs and thousands of other plants, specially selected and prepared for this project, green the skyscrapers and provide a habitat for birds and insects in the middle of the metropolis. They bind CO2 and dust particles from the air, generate moisture and produce oxygen. The plants also have a positive physical and psychological effect on the residents. A piece of nature in the middle of Milan.\n\nThe Hotel Milano Scala\n\nOn the roof terrace of our Green Pearls¬Æ partner Hotel Milano Scala you will also find a green oasis. Above the rooftops of the vibrant city, you can end the evening surrounded by fruit, vegetables and herbs.\n\nGreen roofs, rooftop gardens, balconies and the like improve the city‚Äôs microclimate in a similar way to the Bosco Vertikale and thus truly form a kind of oasis. By the way, staying at the Milano Scala does not produce any (pollutant) emissions that would have to be bound by the plants. The entire hotel is supplied with energy via heat pumps and geothermal energy.\n\nNavigli Quarter\n\nIf you take the train from Milano Scala for about half an hour, you will find yourself in a different world. Everything is a little slower, a little quieter and a little more relaxed. The Navigli district slows down even the normally hectic Milanese and gradually draws visitors under its spell.\n\nThis part of Milan is characterized by the two canals, remnants of a time when Milan, like Venice or Amsterdam, was crisscrossed by waterways. Between them, artists and craftsmen, restaurants and bars have settled. Here you can buy souvenirs directly from the people themselves and thus support the local scene. The neighborhood is also known for its vintage and second-hand stores and markets. So even sustainable fashion fans get their money‚Äôs worth.\n\nBy the way, the Navigli district is only as tranquil as we have just described during the day. In the evening it turns into a party mile. We can only recommend that you spend the whole evening wandering from one bar to the next and at some point simply settle down by the canal to wait for the morning with a drink in your hand.\n\nBest practice for sustainable urban development in Freiburg\n\nThe Vauban District\n\nSimilar to Porto Nuova, no new area was developed for Vauban, but an existing one was converted. The transformation of the former military site began in the early 1990s. In 2006, it was completed: the energy-autonomous, practically car-free and sustainable Vauban district. An active community is still working to incorporate and implement the wishes of the residents and to further shape the neighborhood. Participation is the norm, and even as a guest, you can sense this in the interaction between the residents.\n\nThe houses are all passive, low-energy or even plus-energy houses. Almost no one has a car, and if they do, it is parked on the edge of the area in the parking garage. Cars may only go in for loading and unloading. The connection to public transportation and the well-developed network of bike paths make a car expendable for most people anyway.\n\nIn Vauban, great attention has been paid to the efficient use of renewable resources. Together with the traffic concept and the energy-efficient buildings, a real jewel of sustainable urban planning and a source of inspiration for private builders has been created here. So if you are currently building a house, a visit is worthwhile in multiple ways.\n\nGreen City Hotel Vauban\n\nThe Green City Hotel Vauban is located on the edge of the district, making it the ideal starting point for exploring the sustainable neighborhood on foot. Alternatively, get on your bike and follow the tour along the ‚ÄúGreen Spots‚Äù (sustainable projects in Freiburg). Very convenient: The hotel is such a Green Spot, so you can start cycling directly from there.\n\nThe hotel itself is a prime example of sustainability in action. Architecturally, it relies on resource-conserving and green practices paired with a clean, no-frills design. Heating and cooling are designed to be energy efficient, and electricity comes from a photovoltaic system integrated into the roof. It is also an inclusive business: half of the employees are people with disabilities. In general, the training and further education of the team is of great importance. The focus is clearly on the social aspect, both within the company and with external suppliers and producers.\n\nKeen for a sustainable city trip?

And if you are looking for a certain city: In this article we took a closer look at Paris, Freiburg and Milan.\n\nMicro forest and other plans in Erlangen\n\n‚ÄûStatt-Plan‚Äú Erlangen\n\nThe city in northeastern Bavaria is working hard on its image of a sustainable destination. Initiatives such as ‚ÄúFairlangen‚Äù and the ‚ÄúEducation for Environment and Sustainability‚Äù network are making their mark on the scene with informational offerings, discussion groups and other events. These include Fairlangen‚Äôs FairFinder and the so-called Statt-Plan, an alternative city map that presents sustainable stores, restaurants, caf√©s and much more. On the back, you‚Äôll find additional tips for an environmentally and socially responsible lifestyle. So if you‚Äôre in the mood for a different kind of tour through Erlangen, we can highly recommend the Statt-Plan.\n\nThe garden of the Creativhotel Luise\n\nThe starting point for your excursion could be the Creativhotel Luise. Not only will you get a delicious, ecological zero-waste breakfast, you can also take a look at the hotel‚Äôs huge garden. On a part of the almost 1500 square meters large area, a so-called micro forest is being created based on the Japanese model. A wide variety of trees and other plants are growing in a very confined space and should develop into an extremely diverse habitat over the next ten years.\n\nSince the 1980s, the Creativhotel has been operating according to ecological principles. Today, it is one of the first climate-positive hotel in Germany. In addition to the large garden, you can also relax on the green roof terrace and if you want, you can spend the night in a completely Regrowing Hotel Room¬Æ. Only natural and renewable materials were used for the interior design, thus demonstrating: It‚Äôs possible!\n\nParis at the forefront of sustainable urban planning\n\nGreen architecture in the √âcoQuartier Clichy-Batignolles\n\nThe Paris region has been strongly committed to sustainable development in the urban region, not just since the 2015 climate agreement. Environmentally conscious projects are promoted, social measures are taken and green building projects are supported. Among other things, there is the ‚ÄúEcoQuartier‚Äù quality seal, which focuses not only on the environmental friendliness of the neighborhood but also on the satisfaction of the residents. The development and construction of the corresponding urban area are monitored from the planning stage through the construction phase to completion and beyond, and are judged according to strict criteria.\n\nOne such EcoQuartier is the Clichy-Batignolles district, located in the northeast of the city and developed on a former railway freight yard. If you walk through the streets with an attentive eye, you will notice the different styles of the buildings (a must for all architecture fans!), which nevertheless create a harmonious overall picture. The facades are greened, made of wood or other resource-saving materials, and the houses all have a very low energy balance, some of which is comparable to that of passive houses. There are new metro stations and a large park in the center, providing a green balance for the residents. Besides, it was not only housing for the well-off population of Paris that was created here. Social buildings, residential and retirement homes, and public facilities were also built.\n\nOther green building projects are in the pipeline, including the reinvention of the Porte Maillot transport hub with the glass and planted ‚ÄúMille Arbres‚Äù building, reminiscent of a ship. Completion is scheduled for 2023, just in time for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe green H√¥tel Le Pavillon\n\nBut also outside the sustainable neighborhoods, there are still green havens. This definitely includes the H√¥tel Le Pavillon, which is completely dedicated to sustainability. The former monastery offers a quiet retreat thanks to its somewhat hidden location, yet it‚Äôs right in the middle of the action. Eiffel Tower, Seine or Champs-Elys√©es, everything is within walking distance. The rooms are individually decorated and offer relaxation without disturbing electromagnetic radiation. Locally and organically produced food comes from the own small garden.\n\nOur best practices show that sustainable urban development does not always happen on a very large (or high) scale. It can be driven by individual businesses as well as yourselves. A greened balcony makes for a better microclimate, supporting sustainable and regional stores and initiatives helps make it easy to create a low-impact lifestyle for all, and giving up your car means a reduction in environmental and air pollution. Our Green Pearls¬Æ partners are leading by example.\n\nAnd you? How do you support sustainable development in your hometown or city?
