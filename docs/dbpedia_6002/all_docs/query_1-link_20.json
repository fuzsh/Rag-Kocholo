        "text": "SC FREIBURG\n\nUEFA Europa League round of 16 first leg, Stadion am Wolfswinkel, Thursday 7 March 2024, 9pm CET (8pm GMT)\n\nWest Ham United return to southwest Germany to face SC Freiburg in the UEFA Europa League round of 16 this Thursday evening.\n\nThe Hammers travelled to the university city of Freiburg im Breisgau on matchday two of the group stage back in the first week of October last year, but a UEFA ban meant the Claret and Blue Army were not present at the Stadion am Wolfswinkel to celebrate the visitors’ 2-1 victory.\n\nThis time around, however, some 2,230 supporters will be in the stands to cheer David Moyes’ side on in their first-leg tie.\n\nFreiburg have won their three other home games in the Europa League, scoring 13 goals in victories over TSC, Olympiacos and Lens, who they came from two goals down to defeat 3-2 in extra-time to secure their progress from the knockout round play-offs.\n\nChristian Streich’s side have also played 12 home games in the Bundesliga, winning five, drawing five – including draws with Eintracht Frankfurt (3-3) and Bayern Munich (2-2) in recent weeks – and losing two, and lost at home to second-tier SC Paderborn in the German Cup second round back in November.\n\nHow to get there...\n\nThe nearest airport is EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg, to which flights are available from London’s Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, albeit prices have risen sharply due to the increased demand.\n\nFrom the airport, you can take a Flixbus coach to Freiburg, which takes 55 minutes and costs £21.30.\n\nStadion am Wolfswinkel is situated in the north of the city.\n\nThe best way to get there is to take the Line 4 on the VAG (tram) from Freiburg Hbf and get off at the ‘Europa-Park Stadion’ stop, from where it is a ten-minute walk to the ground. Alternatively, take the S-Bahn 1 line from Freiburg Hbf to Freiburg Messe/Universität, from where it is a 15-minute walk to the ground.\n\nYour match ticket entitles you to a free one-time return trip to the stadium from five hours before kick-off until the end of services.\n\nHowever, supporters should note that there is a strike planned by the German train drivers’ union which may disrupt long-distance Deutsche Bahn, regional and S-Bahn services from 2am CET on Thursday until 1pm CET on Friday.\n\nAdditionally, strike action by ground staff of German airline Lufthansa is expected to impact flights throughout the country and lead to cancellations during the same period.\n\nSupporters travelling to Germany are urged to check all services in advance and allow ample time to reach Freiburg.\n\nFurther information on the public transport system in Germany and alternative travel options can be found by clicking here.\n\nWhere to stay...\n\nAs a city with a population of around 240,000, Freiburg im Breisgau has plenty of hotel options, many of which are situated around the historic Altstadt (Old Town), which is itself situated just north of the Dreisam.\n\nThese hotels are situated close to Freiburg Hbf, which provides public transport links to the Stadion am Wolfswinkel.\n\nWhat to do…\n\nFreiburg im Breisgau’s most famous landmark is its Cathedral, Freiburger Münster, which has a beautiful 116-metre tall tower and was originally founded in 1200.\n\nThe cobbled Münsterplatz – Cathedral Square – is home to a market and many historic buildings.\n\nVisitors should also pay attention not to fall into one of the famous Freiburg Bächle – small water-filled runnels or streams that are supplied with water by the river Dreisam and can be seen along most streets and alleyways in the old city. The word Bächle comes from the German ‘Bach’, meaning brook.\n\nFor those in search of sustenance, the Altstadt is home to dozens of restaurants serving traditional German and international cuisine.\n\nWhat’s happened there before…\n\nWest Ham United have visited SC Freiburg have met just once previously, for the reverse UEFA Europa League Group A fixture played in southwest Germany in early October last year.\n\nLucas Paquetá headed the Irons into first-half lead before Hungary international Roland Sallai equalised four minutes after the break, but Nayef Aguerd ensured the visitors would prevail by netting a header 24 minutes from the end.\n\nHowever, the Hammers had faced opposition from the city previously, back in May 1924, when the Londoners became the first English team to visit the country following the end of the First World War in November 1918.\n\nFresh from completing their first campaign in the First Division, the Irons travelled for a five-match post-season tour which saw them make stops in Cologne, Mannheim, Mönchengladbach and Frankfurt before culminating their trip in Freiburg.\n\nAfter recording four wins out of four, Freiburger FC (pictured, above) proved too strong, winning 5-2 despite goals from West Ham’s Vic Watson and John Campbell. The result marked the Hammers’ first ever away defeat by continental European opposition.\n\nFormed in 1897, Freiburger FC were initially the dominant club in the city, winning the German national title in 1907, but have since been overtaken by SC Freiburg and now play in the regional sixth-tier Verbandsliga Südbaden."
