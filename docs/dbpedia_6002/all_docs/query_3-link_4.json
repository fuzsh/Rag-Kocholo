        "text": "With respect to climate protection, sustainability and future-proof concepts for living, it’s one of the pioneers. Freiburg was named Germany’s most sustainable city in 2012.\n\nThe magazine also introduces the concept of “biophilic architecture” and visits a restaurant in Finland with an innovative zero-waste approach.\n\nMore topics:\n\nIn harmony with nature: \"Biophilic Architecture”\n\nWood instead of concrete, curves instead of edges - architecture that loves life. Wood, natural materials, and exposure to sunlight play an essential role in \"Biophilic Architecture.”\n\nUrban Farming - Growing food in the city center\n\nCultivating fruit, herbs, and vegetables in urban city centers is becoming more and more important. Examples include farms on the roofs of Paris or in the port of Rotterdam. This could be the future.\n\n\"Nolla\" - The Zero-Waste Restaurant in Finland\n\n\"Nolla\" is the first Finnish restaurant that composts all of its food scraps and leftovers. What’s more: everything is made from recycled materials, including the furniture and dishes.\n\nSustainable and socially aware: Fashion by Progetto Quid\n\nProgetto Quid works with high-quality fabrics from leading Italian fashion brands that would otherwise be discarded. Socially disadvantaged women use them to craft limited collection designs.\n\nBroadcasting Hours:\n\nDW English\n\nSAT 14.11.2020 – 04:30 UTC\n\nSAT 14.11.2020 – 09:30 UTC\n\nSAT 14.11.2020 – 13:30 UTC\n\nSAT 14.11.2020 – 22:30 UTC\n\nSUN 15.11.2020 – 01:30 UTC\n\nSUN 15.11.2020 – 06:30 UTC\n\nSUN 15.11.2020 – 17:30 UTC\n\nMON 16.11.2020 – 00:02 UTC\n\nCape Town UTC +2 | Delhi UTC +5,5 | Hong Kong UTC +8\n\nLagos UTC +1 | Cape Town UTC +2 | Nairobi UTC +3\n\nSan Francisco UTC -8 | Edmonton UTC -7 | New York UTC -5\n\nLondon UTC +/-0 | Berlin UTC +1 | Moscow UTC +3\n\nDW Deutsch+\n\nSAT 14.11.2020 – 09:30 UTC\n\nSUN 15.11.2020 – 06:30 UTC\n\nVancouver UTC -8 | New York UTC -5 | Sao Paulo UTC -3"
