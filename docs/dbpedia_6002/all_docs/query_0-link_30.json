Tram\n\n26. 140 Years of Passion The Way Forward First Last Mile (FLM) is generally defined as the initial or the final segment of a public transport trip. The First Mile Last Mile is aimed at providing solution to:  Bus Alignment Efficiency  Bus and Pedestrian Network Permeability  Trunk-Feeder Direct Transfer Opportunities  Bus Travel Time Reliability First Mile Last Mile\n\n27. 140 Years of Passion The Way Forward Issues & Challenges in Implementation Uncompetitive travel time, cost, comfort, convenience and inflexibility of public transport use relative to use of private vehicles as private vehicles provide immediate availability & seamless delivery door to door. Poor integration between land use and public transport planning as the use of sustainable travel modes are not central in local land use planning. Policies mismatch between encouraging the use of national cars and the gradual removal of automotive import duty in National Automotive Policy with increase public transport use. Sustainability of public transport infrastructure due to Malaysia’s low to medium population density (90 persons per sqkm). 1 2 4 3\n\n28. 140 Years of Passion The Way Forward Goal 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Goal Target 11.2 By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons.

Changing Priority… The needs to change priority…\n\n30. 140 Years of Passion The Way Forward Integrating Transportation and Land Use Development “Express” and “Direct” buses run along its 5 structural axes (north, south, east, west, and southwest). A typical structural axis includes two side blocks and three roadways along key arterial corridors. This road system was created through a re- definition of the existing streets, not by resizing the streets or constructing overpasses. Mixed Use & High Density Development Central avenue is dedicated to bus transit Parallel street higher speed traffic Low Density Development The highest levels of residential and commercial development are concentrated in the two blocks at the centre of the spine, with diminishing densities in the blocks to either side.

The integration of land use, road systems and mass transit is a powerful tool for economic growth, social cohesiveness & inclusiveness, and improved environmental quality. Affordable technological solutions with creativity as substitute for financial resources. Public transportation & pedestrians should be given priority in transportation planning to encourage use of sustainable travel modes. Optimizing existing infrastructure to minimize cost. Partnership between key actors to enable integrated and collective solutions. Political will to support innovations and creativity in encouraging the use of sustainable travel modes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Lessons Learned 7\n\n37. 140 Years of Passion The Way Forward Wider Labor Force Better chance of matching the needs of a job with the skills of a worker and exchange of information & knowledge. GDP Growth Efficient transport can attract economic activity to cities, and boost productivity by improving connectivity and reducing time lost to travel. Lower Carbon Footprint Road transport contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). Health Benefits Reduce risk of depression through creation of opportunity for social inclusiveness and interaction and free from traffic congestion. Better Quality of Life Improve accessibility to facilities and amenities which contributes to a more equal distribution of wealth. Transit produces agglomeration which impacts correlate with one another… Social Equity The benefits of affordable and accessible public transport offers fair access to social goods & services to all communities. Why Public Transport Matters?\n\n38. 140 Years of Passion The Way Forward In making public transport as the rakyat’s mode of choice and in achieving 40% urban public transport mode share by 2030: • Integration of transport modes needs to be supported by integration of land use and transportation planning; • Integration requires collective and cross-functional efforts and supports from many agencies; • The vision and mission to encourage the use of sustainable transport mode need to be mutually carried out and embedded by all institutions and agencies to support aspirations of sustainable development; and • Investment in public transportation infrastructure needs to be encouraged by Government & private sectors for economic growth, social inclusiveness & improved quality of life for the rakyat.
