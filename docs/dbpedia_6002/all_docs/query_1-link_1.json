        "text": "Freiburg im Breisgau, city, Baden-Württemberg Land (state), southwestern Germany. It is picturesquely situated on the western slopes of the Black Forest, where the Dreisam River flows into the Rhine valley. It was founded and chartered in 1120 by the dukes of Zähringen as a free market town (hence its name). In 1218 it passed to the counts of Urach, who assumed the title of counts of Freiburg. Under the Habsburgs after 1368, it was the administrative centre for the outlying Austrian possessions from 1648 to 1805. It was captured in 1525 by the Bauernbund (Peasants’ and Farmers’ League), in 1632 and 1638 by the Swedes, during the Thirty Years’ War (1644) by the Bavarians, and in 1677, 1713, and later by the French, who fortified it. In 1806 it was returned, together with the Breisgau and Ortenau areas, to the ruling house of Baden. Almost all of the old part (the medieval Innenstadt) of the city was completely destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II.\n\nThe cultural and economic seat of the Black Forest and parts of the upper Rhine valley, Freiburg is a tourist and conference hub. It serves as the regional shopping and business centre for prosperous southern Baden. High technology (particularly biotechnology) also contributes to the local economy. In 2000, former military barracks were purchased by the city from the federal government, enabling the building of several thousand new housing units. About one-fourth of the city is residential, and the remainder comprises oak and pine forests, farmland, and parkland."
