        "text": "ZENTRUM LANDWASSER presents itself as a modern residential and supply complex and a new focal point in Freiburg’s Weststadt district. With a broad residential use concept and mixed-use retail and restaurant space in the ground floor colonnade, the neighbourhood will become a central hub for local amenities and socialising – offering the perfect accommodation for all age groups and lifestyles. ZENTRUM LANDWASSER is a “town within a city” in the dynamically growing district, with mixed use of housing, retail, fitness, gastronomy and services, ensuring a modern and needs-oriented quality of living with a future. It is not only the modern architecture by WWA Architects that is impressive, but also a sophisticated ESG concept as a Freiburg energy-efficient house that fulfils the requirements of the KfW-55 (EE) standard. The neighbourhood LELA – Living in Landwasser – comprises the around 150 rental flats on the upper floors of the buildings.\n\nElaborately designed, the entire neighbourhood offers a successful combination of functional areas and recreational spaces. A variety of planting areas and trees, combined with inviting seating, sculptures and an illuminated network of paths characterise the green spaces between the residential and commercial areas.\n\nIn the growing district of Landwasser, the LELA neighbourhood is an important residential and supply centre that not only inspires its new residents, but also the residents around it with the new possibilities of central local supply. In addition to the already excellent connections to the city centre, but also to the region, the location offers a quiet, green and low-noise environment, which also offers outstanding quality of living for families and senior citizens. This means that the light rail, bus and daycare centre can be reached in just one minute. The nearest primary school is just three minutes away. Other schools, daycare centres, playgrounds and the S-Bahn are also within easy walking distance.\n\nWhile a wide range of leisure and recreational facilities, cafés and restaurants provide amenities, the range of local amenities is less extensive. ZENTRUM LANDWASSER addresses this situation with its concept of living and supply, which offers numerous shopping opportunities to meet everyday needs with LIDL, REWE, DM and other retailers, and also ensures the future viability of the neighbourhood with gastronomic offerings, the Fitness Loft, medical practices and service providers such as hairdressers and nursing services.\n\nIt´s one of the most popular tourist destinations in south-west Germany and, at the same time, home to over 231,000 inhabitants, for whom it offers an excellent quality of life – Freiburg, the “capital of the Black Forest”. It presents itself in the most beautiful scenic location on the Baden Wine Route and the “Route Verte” and impresses with its medieval town centre and buildings from all eras of its long history, whether Freiburg Minster Cathedral or the historic department stores, the Alte Wache (Old Guardhouse) or the Colombischlössle manor house. The metropolis is not only known as a “Green City” for its commitment to the environment, but also as a trade fair location for important trade and public fairs in the fields of solar technology, information and media technology, medical technology and biotechnology. Freiburg has developed into an economic centre primarily due to the service sector, which, in conjunction with the University of Freiburg, the University Hospital and the public sector as the largest employer, has a decisive influence on the entire region.\n\nThe city’s cultural life is characterised by a lively music scene and diverse festivals. Numerous theatres, orchestras and choirs have made Freiburg an internationally-renowned city of culture. The city also has a well-established sporting reputation thanks to the local Bundesliga club SC Freiburg – and also favours American sports such as baseball and American football, not least thanks to the high number of students from all over the world.\n\nSurrounded by the Mooswald forest, Landwasser presents itself as a green district with many opportunities for sporting activities in nature or relaxing walks, practically on your doorstep. Built in the 1960s as a large housing estate, Landwasser offers a variety of buildings and good public transport connections, making it easy to reach the city centre in just 15 minutes. The infrastructure of the young district, which has been planned rather than developing organically, provides a good range of important amenities not only for single people and couples, but also for families with children, from shopping facilities to the market square, schools and educational institutions, youth centres and hospitals.\n\nThe popular Moosweiher pond and its surrounding large green area with mature trees, minigolf course and half-pipe offer the proverbial local recreation. Young and old meet here to swim, have a barbecue, sunbathe or play sport. In addition, the Mundenhof animal enclosures, the Seepark (Lake Park) and the surrounding Mooswald forest are popular leisure spots. Also worth seeing is the “Rote Otto”, a 12-metre-high group of figures that is considered a landmark of the district. A well-developed network of cycle paths connects Landwasser with the town and surrounding area."
