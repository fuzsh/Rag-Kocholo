        "text": "The aim of external respiration or lung respiration is to supply the body’s cells with oxygen and to release carbon dioxide. External respiration consists of inhalation (inspiration, active) and exhalation (expiration, passive), which can be divided into four steps:\n\nThe thorax rises and the diaphragm contracts.\n\nThe inhaled air thus flows into the lungs.\n\nThe respiratory muscles relax again.\n\nThe lungs follow their aspiration to collapse (as far as the thorax allows) and air flows out of them.\n\nThe following happens in detail: The inhaled, oxygen-rich air flows into the trachea via the mouth, nose and throat. At the same time, it is warmed, moistened and purified. The air then flows further into the bronchi, bronchioles and finally into the alveoli, which are surrounded by a network of very thin blood vessels (capillaries). Here, gas exchange takes place across the alveolocapillary membrane by diffusion. Inside the alveoli, there is a higher partial pressure of oxygen and a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide than in the blood. Due to this pressure gradient, oxygen (O2) is absorbed into the blood of the pulmonary circulation (binding to hemoglobin) and at the same time carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli. Via the blood circulation, the oxygen-loaded hemoglobin is transported into the tissues and cells. The carbon dioxide (CO2) produced there by metabolic processes in turn returns to the lungs via the blood and is then exhaled into the environment.\n\nThe regulation and control of our breathing takes place in the respiratory center. This is located in the medulla oblongata, an important regulatory and reflex center located in the continuation of the spinal cord in the brain area. Breathing is controlled automatically in the respiratory center, but it is the only basic automatic function of our body that can be influenced voluntarily (for example, when speaking, singing, and holding one’s breath).\n\nSeveral groups of neurons are located in the medulla oblongata. Through a complex interplay of these respiratory neurons, our rhythmic activity of inhaling and exhaling takes place. The neurons promote and inhibit each other (interplay between inspiratory and expiratory neurons). In this way, a basic breathing rhythm is made possible, which can be adapted to changing needs and conditions by higher brain centers and other areas of the body. This happens, for example, during sports: in order to meet the increased oxygen demand, the body has to breathe faster. Corresponding signals are transmitted to the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata via special mechanoreceptors in the joints and muscles.\n\nIn detail, involuntary respiratory regulation is influenced primarily by the carbon dioxide content, the pH value and the oxygen content of the blood. The most important role, however, is played by the carbon dioxide content. If the various receptors in the body measure a high level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood, the respiratory center increases the respiratory rate so that the excess CO2 in the alveoli can be released into the air we breathe. If, on the other hand, the CO2 concentration is too low, the respiratory rate is reduced.\n\nThe oxygen content in the blood, on the other hand, has less influence on automatic respiratory regulation. Adaptation reactions of the body only take place when the oxygen content drops drastically.\n\nIn addition to the respiratory neurons mentioned above, various sensors and receptors as well as influences from higher areas of the central nervous system (emotions or reflexes, e.g. coughing, sneezing, yawning and swallowing) play a role in involuntary respiratory regulation. Sensors and receptors that sense respiratory stimuli and transmit them to the respiratory center include chemosensors (e.g. in the aorta, brainstem), mechanosensors (lungs, respiratory muscles), sensors for deep sensitivity of the locomotor system, thermosensors (skin), and hormone receptors.\n\nThanks to the ability to control our breathing muscles at will, we can consciously change our breathing. This can be used, for example, for certain breathing techniques in sports or when relaxing. However, this control is limited in the case of stronger fluctuations in the concentrations of carbon dioxide, oxygen or a change in the blood pH value.\n\nDuring sleep, our breathing changes fundamentally, and so does our breathing rate, so that a healthy adult breathes an average of 12 to 16 times per minute (breathing at rest). During the waking state, breathing is mainly controlled by external influences. During sleep, on the other hand, breathing is essentially regulated by metabolism, with special “pacemakers” inside the body (e.g. baroreceptors) being predominantly active.\n\nSince respiratory minute volume and respiratory rate are reduced during sleep, arterial carbon dioxide increases and arterial oxygen partial pressure decreases. At the same time, the airway resistance of the upper airways increases and the natural protective reflex of the lungs (protection against over-expansion of the lungs during inhalation ) decreases.\n\nBreathing rate and depth vary depending on the sleep phase. Thus, during REM sleep there is an increased variability of respiratory rate and depth of breath.\n\nIn addition to non-diseased changes in our breathing during sleep, there are several sleep-related breathing disorders. These can have various causes:\n\nNarrowing of the upper airway due to slackening of the muscles (obstructive sleep apnea).\n\nCentral sleep apnea, which is due to a disorder of the respiratory center.\n\nHypoventilation syndrome, for example, due to severe obesity, muscular diseases, severe chronic lung diseases or severe curvatures of the spine\n\nThe breathing rate of women and men usually differs due to anatomical factors. Women have an average respiratory rate of 14 to 18 and men of 12 to 16.\n\nOn the one hand, the differences come from the volume of the upper body (thoracic volume): for example, the female thorax has an average volume of 4 liters, while the male thorax has an average volume of 5 liters. Secondly, there is a difference in breathing type between the sexes. Whereas in women chest breathing is predominant at rest, in men it is abdominal breathing. Furthermore, the respiratory tract is smaller in women than in men (nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi). The lungs also have a different volume on average: In women, this is approx. 4.5 to 5 liters (approx. 1.6% of total body weight) and in men approx. 6.5 to 7 liters (approx. 1.8% of total body weight).\n\nAn ECG (electrocardiogram) measures the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes attached to the skin. The ECG electrodes can also be used to determine the respiratory rate. This is done by means of so-called impedance pneumography. As we inhale and exhale, the volume of the chest (thorax) increases and decreases. During the increase in volume, the alternating current resistance (impedance) of the thorax increases, and during the decrease in volume, it decreases. With the help of two electrodes placed on the thorax, these changes in impedance can be measured. The fluctuations recorded in this way are displayed on a monitor as an impedance pneumogram (“breathing curve”). From this, the respiratory rate can be determined. A disadvantage of this method is that the signal is very susceptible to motion artifacts. Thus, every movement of the body influences the thoracic impedance."
