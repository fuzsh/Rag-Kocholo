Known as Germany’s sunniest city, this is a beautiful place to visit.\n\nIt also has a long history having been founded just over 900 years ago in 1120 by the Dukes of Zähringen as a free market town. Its name, Freiburg, comes from this with “Freie Burg” meaning Free Castle.\n\nHowever, the first reference of people living in this location is found in a document in 1008, and trade routes used to pass near here.\n\nIn 1091, Berthold II of Zähringen built a castle on what is today Schlossberg to control the trade routes. This resulted in a settlement growing at the foot of the castle in the Old Town area which became Freiburg.\n\nIn 1218, the Zähringer’s died out and the Counts of Urach came into power changing their name to the Counts of Freiburg. This was not a popular move and a new council constitution formalised the rights they had under the Zähringen which lead to councillors from 24 of the old ruling houses ruling Freiburg and yearly council changes, although the Counts were still in power.\n\nThere were many feuds between the Counts and the councillors. In fact in 1299, there was a brief battle between the citizens of Freiburg and Count Egino II and his brother-in-law, Conrad of Lichtenberg, the Bishop of Strasbourg after the citizens didn’t like the new demands from the Count.\n\nThe citizens won, but the Bishop was killed and the citizens had to pay a yearly reparation for this.\n\nEventually, the citizens of Freiburg were able to free themselves in 1368 by paying the Counts and choosing to move under the House of Habsburg for protection.\n\nThere were ups and downs of this decision. Freiburg had to support the Habsburgers in the wars again the Swiss Confederacy. In 1386 at the Battle of Sempach, their side lost and most the Freiburg nobility were killed. This lead to the guilds taking over the city council.\n\nIn 1520, Freiburg became an important Catholic centre after it did not take part in the Reformation.\n\nThe German Peasants War came to Freiburg in 1525 when 18,000 peasants captured Freiburg for a short time.\n\nThe first witch hunts took place in 1536 and unfortunately continued whenever the city needed scapegoats, like in 1564 when about a quarter of the city’s population died from the Black Death. It reached its peak in 1599 and there is a plaque today on the old city wall where the burnings took place.\n\nThere were many changes in the coming years after conflicts and war found Freiburg under the control of many different people including the Austrians, Swedes, Spanish, French and various closer neighbours as well. The Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) was particularly devastating for Freiburg. At the start, there were around 10,000 – 14,000 citizens in Freiburg. By the end, there were only 2,000.\n\nFrom this time until 1805, Freiburg was either occupied by the French or the administrative centre of Further Austria which was a Habsburg territory. At the end of this time, it became part of the ruling house of Baden.\n\nDuring World War II, Freiburg was badly damaged with the majority of the Old Town destroyed by Allied bombing. A few buildings did survive like the Münster. The Old Town was rebuilt to its Medieval plan.\n\nToday, Freiburg is a popular tourist and conference destination. It’s also a regional business and shopping hub. Technology production also plays a part in the local economy.\n\nTop 16 Things To Do In Freiburg Im Breisgau Germany\n\nHere are the best things to see in Freiburg Germany. Read through and select the ones that fit your interests and timeframe. If you only have one day to visit Freiburg tourist attractions, find our one day Freiburg places to visit itinerary below.\n\nNote that I sort these top things to do in Freiburg Germany based on geographical location starting with the central Old Town and Freiburger Münster and then listing the closest Freiburg things to do while working our way further away. The order isn’t based on what I think are the most important attractions.\n\nMany museums are closed on Mondays.\n\nAltstadt (Old Town)\n\nFreiburg’s Old Town is a charming place to wander and explore. Make sure you have some time on your list of the best things to do in Freiburg Germany to just wander and enjoy.\n\nThe Old Town dates back to before Freiburg’s founding in 1120, although it was largely rebuilt after World War II.\n\nIt’s an interesting mix of old and new and architecture styles which somehow works very well together. It didn’t feel as “museum-like” as some other Old Towns we have visited while still having some gorgeous areas and buildings which added to its charm.\n\nThe best way to explore the Old Town is on foot. It’s much better for pedestrians than many Old Towns in Germany and I didn’t feel we had to keep dodging vehicles.\n\nYou’ll find many of the Freiburg visiting places coming up are in the Old Town, and you can see a lot of worthwhile attractions here.\n\nIt’s in a pretty spot as well, bordered on one side by the Dreisam River and another by Schlossberg Mountain. The main train station is also located by the Old Town.\n\nFreiburger Münster (Cathedral)\n\nLocated in the central Münsterplatz, you won’t want to miss Freiburg’s 13th century Münster. Even set against the gorgeous Old Town, it has an impressive presence.\n\nIt took 300 years to build this Romanesque church which withstood even the battering Freiburg took in World War II. At the time of its completion in 1330, it had the highest tower in the world.\n\nIt makes for quite a sight both inside and outside with beautiful stained glass windows once paid for by the Medieval guilds and an amazing Renaissance altarpiece by Hans Baldung Grien.\n\nThe outside is elaborate with many carvings, gargoyles and spires. You won’t want to miss the tower which starts off square and becomes octagonal with a 116 metre high spire. It’s possible to see to France from here on clear days.\n\nThe church is free with a small fee to climb the tower to the 70 metre viewing platform. The tower has limited opening hours.\n\nThe area around the cathedral is a market daily except Sundays.\n\nMuseum Für Stadtgeschichte (City History Museum)\n\nLocated on Münsterplatz, if you want to learn more about Freiburg’s past, you’ll want your next stop to be at the Museum Für Stadtgeschichte (City History Museum).\n\nIts home was built by the sculptor, Christian Wentzinger, in 1761. There is a great staircase and ceiling fresco so be sure to look up. I also enjoyed the models of the city from around 1600 and 1700.\n\nThere’s also some photos of the city pre World War II that you can compare to after the bombing raid and today. Such a change!\n\nOn level 1 are some activities as well as exhibits which were great for keeping the kids interested. They could do a puzzle, stamp a coin and get an idea of how hard it would have been to get all the materials up high to build the church via lifting stone with a pulley. These activities are also good for keeping adults interested 🙂\n\nThe museum is mostly in German apart from some random parts that have been translated. Unfortunately, I didn’t have phone reception on the lower levels that made translating via the Google translate hard.\n\nHowever, there is enough of interest and the entry price is low enough that I feel this museum is worth the admission even if you don’t speak German. It’s a smaller museum, but it has a good collection to help you understand more about Freiburg’s past.\n\nI recommend you visit this one of the Freiburg im Breisgau things to do at the beginning of your journey to give a great appreciation to everything else as you walk around.\n\nThis museum is shut Mondays and has a small fee.\n\nBächle\n\nAs you walk around the Old Town, you won’t be able to miss Bächle, the little waterways that flow through the streets.\n\nThese were created in 1170 from the Dreisam River to provide industrial and cleaning water to the town as well as a way to stop fires, although they were also used as open sewers.\n\nThese days, there are still 15.5 kilometres of these channels, some of which are underground. They help keep things cool and add to the Medieval atmosphere. Note that if the weather has been dry, they may not contain water though.\n\nBe careful not to step into one unless you want to marry someone from Freiburg! The legend goes that this is what will happen if you do. My six year old did so watch this page to see if it comes true 😀\n\nAugustinermuseum\n\nArt lovers will not want to miss the Augustiner Museum particularly if you are looking for things to do in Freiburg on a rainy day as this is a great option.\n\nThis museum showcases work from the Middle Ages to the 19th century in a former Augustinian monastery. The building itself has been well renovated making a great home for this collection.\n\nThe collections include a great Sculpture Hall with masterpieces by Renaissance artists Hans Baldung Grien and Lucas Cranach the Elder as well as paintings by masters like Matthias Grünewald and the Master of the Housebook.\n\nYou can also find original stained glass from Freiburger Münster here.\n\nEntry is by admission and the Augustiner is shut on Mondays.\n\nRathausplatz (Town Hall Square)\n\nOne of the most charming areas to visit in Freiburg is Rathausplatz or Town Hall Square. It’s a great spot to take a time out from exploring, have a drink and soak in the atmosphere.\n\nDon’t miss the Old Town Hall which dates back to the 16th century and is built in the Renaissance style in red. It’s now home to the tourist office so you can take a look inside. Look for the double eagle of the Holy Roman Empire above the clock as well as the coats of arms along the gable which belong to Freiburg’s ruling families.\n\nThe New Town Hall is a pretty step-gabled design dating back to the 19th century. It is actually two Renaissance burgher houses that were joined together.\n\nYou can also take a look at the medieval Martinskirche church.\n\nMarkthalle (Market Hall)\n\nWhen you start feeling hungry, consider heading to Freiburg’s historic market hall. Here, you can find what amounts to an international food court.\n\nThere are over 20 stalls to chose from that pump out some great food from sushi to Argentine to Indian or Middle Eastern. Of course, since you have come all the to Germany, you could also eat something more local with their local wurst (sausage).\n\nWhatever you pick, you can have a great meal here in an historic place. On Friday and Saturday evenings, there can be live music or a DJ as well as a champagne bar, and it opens until late.\n\nIt is quite cramped inside with a lot of action.\n\nIt’s closed on Sundays and public holidays.\n\nMartinstor (City Gate)\n\nThere are two city gates you can still visit in Freiburg. This is the older of the two and can be found on the southwest side of the Old Town. A gate was first positioned here in 1202.\n\nThis gate was once part of Medieval fortifications but when the fortifications changed in the 1600s, it was no longer required.\n\nThe lower third of the gate is original with the upper part added at the start of the 20th century. Look out for the plaque on the Old Town side of the tower. This plaque is in memory of the victims of the witch trials. This site is where three convicted women were burnt in 1599.\n\nHowever, mostly this gate was used as a prison for debtors.\n\nSchwabentor (City Gate)\n\nThe other remaining gate, Schwabentor, dates back to the 13th century. You can see a mural of Freiburg’s patron saint, St George, slaying a dragon on its front.\n\nIt’s three storeys high and there are several other pictures as well. You can see a 1672 Baroque painting of a merchant and a painting of the “Boy of Thorn”.\n\nThis boy is drawn with a big head, an unhappy expression and no neck. He’s pulling a thorn from his foot and it’s thought that this is a reminder to residents to not stray from the right path.\n\nToday, a tram runs under this tower.\n\nMuseum Für Neue Kunst (Museum Of Contemporary Art)\n\nOnce art lovers have finished at the Augustinermuseum, they’ll want to head three minutes walk south to the other art option .\n\nIt takes off where the Augustiner finishes and highlights 20th century expressionist and abstract art with work by painters and sculptors.\n\nIt calls a Neo-Baroque building home which was built in 1902. Initially, it was an extension to the Female Educational and Etiquette Institute of the Adelhauser Neukloster.\n\nToday, this museum has a regional focus with many works from artists in the region including Julius Bissier who was born in Freiburg.\n\nThis museum has an entry fee and is closed on Mondays.\n\nColombischlössle/Archäologisches Museum (Archaeological Museum)\n\nInside a beautiful 19th century mansion, Colombischlössle, this museum has quite a grand marble entrance and cast-iron staircase. Built for the Countess Maria Antonia Gertrudis von Zea Bermudez y Colombi around 1860, it has a playful Gothic Tudor style. It’s surrounded by beautiful gardens, fountains and sculptures. Even without the museum, it’s worth a visit.\n\nHowever once you go inside, you’ll be glad you did. You’ll find treasures from the Stone Ages to the Celtics to the Romans and on to the Middle Ages.\n\nThis is a great way to learn more about this region of Germany.\n\nClosed on Mondays, there is a small fee to enter.\n\nSchlossberg (Castle Hill)\n\nSchlossberg is right behind the Old Town and the forested peak can’t be missed as you are exploring the city.\n\nAt 456 metres high, you can walk up Schlossberg from a path opposite the Schwabentor or take a ride up on the Schlossbergbahn (funicular railway). The railway is a fun way to go and gets you to part way up the peak in three minutes.\n\nThere are longer trails from here for serious hikers with some great options, as well as short walks for sightseers who want some great views.\n\nAt the top of Schlossberg is the Schlossbergturm (Schlossberg Tower). There are fantastic views from here across the city including of the Münster and the Black Forest.\n\nA strategic position, Schlossberg was fortified by at least the 1000s. These structures are in ruins today.\n\nWe had a great couple of hours wandering round here, checking out the views and enjoying nature. It’s the perfect spot for a picnic lunch while you look over the city.\n\nThe park area and tower are free. The cable car has a fee.\n\nClick here to read our full guide to visiting Schlossberg.\n\nAlter Friedhof (Old Cemetery)\n\nFor a different type of attraction, head to Alter Friedhof, just a short walk from the Old Town.\n\nThis cemetery was the final resting home for Freiburg’s citizens from 1683 to 1872. Today, it is considered a natural monument.\n\nThis cemetery has been left untouched thanks to Johann Christian Wentzinger. When he passed away in 1797, he left his estate to the city on the condition that his grave would be looked after forever. And so it has!\n\nIt’s a surprisingly nice place for a stroll. The wealthy citizens have gravestones that are works of Baroque and neoclassic art.\n\nIn the middle of the cemetery is St. Michael’s Chapel which was built in 1720. The cemetery itself is enclosed in high walls which help give it a secluded feel well away from the city.\n\nThe cemetery is open daily and entry is free.\n\nSeepark (Lake Park)\n\nWhen it comes to things to do near Freiburg Germany, this option is just a few kilometres northwest of the Old Town. It’s one of the most popular green areas in Freiburg and the perfect place to head to feel like you’ve escaped the city without going far.\n\nIn addition to the park itself, there is a swimming lake, pool, pedal boats, mini golf, playgrounds and restaurants. It’s a great place to give the kids a run around.\n\nThis 35 hectare park was once used for agriculture although the gravel soil did not work well for growing grain. In the 1920s, a gravel company moved in to mine sand and gravel. This was shut in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1986, the area was converted to host the State Horticultural Show. Since then, parts have been added to build the great park it is today.\n\nSeepark is open daily and entry is free.\n\nBlack Forest\n\nIf you are looking for day trips from Freiburg, this is sure to be your top pick! Germany’s Black Forest surrounds Freiburg so it’s easy to visit and should be on your must-do list.\n\nThe best way to explore the Black Forest is by foot on a hiking trail so I suggest you pick one and get hiking.

It generally opens early\n\nLearn more about the city’s past at the Museum Für Stadtgeschichte (City History Museum) which opens at 10am\n\nHead to Augustiner Museum to enjoy the art collection\n\nHave lunch at Markthalle\n\nTake some photos at insta-worthy Rathausplatz (Town Hall Square)\n\nWalk through the city gates at Martinstor and Schwabentor\n\nTake the Schlossbergbahn (funicular railway) up Schlossberg and climb the Schlossbergturm (Schlossberg Tower) for great views over Freiburg\n\nVisit the Colombischlössle/Archäologisches Museum (Archaeological Museum)\n\nIf you have the time and inclination, you can also visit the Museum Für Neue Kunst (Museum Of Contemporary Art) or walk through Alter Friedhof (Old Cemetery)\n\nNote that none of the museums open on Mondays. If you visit on a Monday, still walk around the Old Town past these museums so you see more of this great area. You can also visit Seepark or do part of a hike from Schlossberg.\n\nFreiburg Attractions Map\n\nBest Place To Stay In Freiburg Im Breisgau\n\nWhen it comes to where to stay in Freiburg, there is a great range of hotels and other accommodation options.

It’s in a beautiful part of the country with plenty of outdoor activity nearby with the Black Forest.\n\nWe visited here with our three kids aged 6 – 12 and they enjoyed running round the Old Town (and following the Bächle), taking the funicular railway up Schlossberg and, of course, visiting Europa Park.\n\nI also have an extra thing to do in Freiburg for families here which my kids enjoyed.\n\nMundenhof\n\nLocated just a ten minute drive from the Old Town, Mundenhof is the perfect Old Town timeout for families. This large animal park is located on a 38 hectare estate which dates back to the 9th century. It’s the largest zoo in Baden-Württemberg.\n\nThere is a good range of animals from water buffalos to llamas to farm animals. It is more of a big farm than the traditional lion-tiger-elephant zoo.\n\nThere are activities like wagon rides and camel rides especially in the school holiday period. We found it a relaxing afternoon with our kids.\n\nA really cool thing about Mundenhof is that entry is free. There is a 5 euro parking fee which helps support the zoo. It’s always open.\n\nFinal Words\n\nI hope you have found this guide to Freiburg things to see useful and that you have as good a time exploring Freiburg im Breisgau as we did.\n\nIt’s a very charming city with some nice attractions and a great Old Town, and I’m sure you will love it too.\n\nRead more guides to visiting Southern Germany here.
