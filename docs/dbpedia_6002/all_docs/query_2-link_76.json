        "text": "A great plus for process safety in the pharmaceutical industry\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, the quality of compressed air plays a decisive role. Impurities or oil contaminations in medicaments through compressed air can quickly have fatal consequences. To improve the process safety in the production, the Pfizer production location in Freiburg, Germany, relies on continuous quality control of the compressed air by means of the METPOINT OCV residual- oil monitoring device by BEKO TECHNOLOGIES.\n\nMonitoring compressed air in food processing\n\nAccording to ISO 8573-1, compressed air of class 1 must not contain more than 0.01 mg/m³ of oil (liquid, aerosol or vapor). This is as little as 4% of the concentration found in normal ambient air! There are however processes, where even 0.01 mg is still too much. This is especially the case in food processing where certain applications demand that oil content in the compressed air is less than 0.003 mg/m³. There are however only a few companies that are able to monitor such low concentrations. One of them is Heinrich Nölke GmbH & Co. KG, a well-known producer of sausages.\n\nClean compressed air for laser beams\n\nThe research centre from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) and the Technical University Munich (TUM) investigates the potential of light for the early diagnosis and therapy of serious diseases such as cancer. Compressed air, and in particular its purity, plays an important role in the use of intense laser light. It is therefore crucial for the researchers that the compressed air quality is monitored at all times."
