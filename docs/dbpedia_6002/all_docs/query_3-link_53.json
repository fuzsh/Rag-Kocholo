        "text": "1. Sustainable Traffic Management: Freiburg, Germany\n\n2. Background InformationFreiburg is a city in Germany with a population of over 200,000.In the early 1970s it was a city with major traffic problems.\n\n3. 5 Pillars of the PlanTraffic CalmingIncreasing Bicycle UseControlling ParkingConcentrating TrafficPublic Transport\n\n4. Pillar 1: Traffic CalmingCity centre turned into pedestrian zone in 1973.Cobbles on streets to slow traffic.30 km per hour speed limit on residential roads\n\n5. Pillar 2: Concentrating TrafficUsing key roads to concentrate traffic (BÃ¼ndelungsstrassen)Diverting traffic away from city centre and the most scenic location (Bank of the River Dreisam)\n\n6. Pillar 3: Limiting ParkingThere is no free, uncontrolled parking in the city centre.Parking is on a sliding scale to encourage commuters to park and ride from the outskirts.\n\n7. Pillar 4: Public TransportCity promotes public transport including Trams, and has added new routes in recent years.Monthly travel card for entire city and surrounding districts available cheaply.\n\n8. Pillar 5: Bicycle UseCity promotes bicycle use.More than 500km of interconnected bicycle lanes.More than 5,000 parking spaces for bikes in city centre.At many junctions bike have priority.\n\n9. Indicators of SuccessFrom 1967 to 1997 people using cars on a regular bases fell from 63% to 40%.4,000 fewer cars using the city centre each day (even though population increased).70% of local journeys are made using trams.3,000 km of public transport lines."
