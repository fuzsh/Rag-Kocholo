        "text": "Sharing my poem with my peers in the MSc Global Mental Health and Society program at The University of Edinburgh wasnâ€™t easy. At first, I was nervous about exposing such a personal part of my mental health journey. But then I realized: staying silent would only perpetuate the stigmaâ€”the false belief that thereâ€™s shame in experiencing real human emotions and challenges. As a mental health advocate, itâ€™s crucial to practice what I preach. I had to ask myself: ðŸ”¹ How would I treat someone else who has faced similar experiences? ðŸ”¹ Would I judge them for circumstances beyond their control? ðŸ”¹ Do I allow a diagnosis to dictate how I view and treat others? If the answer is no, then why should it define you? Letâ€™s continue to challenge the stigma by starting with how we view our own journeys. #MentalHealthAwareness #SmashTheStigma #TheYellowTulipProject\n\nI love this so much! Everything on this list I have said to my staff in the past week. Leaders are human and we need to treat our staff with compassion and help them grow. There should be zero expectation of anyone knowing everything. Mistakes are inevitable and space should be given for them to be made and lessons learned, for all individuals. If things arent working, its our job to HELP them figure out a solution. We hire people to do their jobs, let them do it and know they probably have a better grasp on some situations than we do so we should absolutely trust their judgment. When given training on yearly performance evaluations we are told that staff shouldn't be finding out about things they aren't doing well at that time, the same goes for the good things they are doing. A quick good job on x thing can go a long way.\n\nEvery workplace has phases, but the positive ones truly shape our professional journey. Simple phrases like the ones below create a positive team environment for my team. Here's to: 1. Team Collaboration and diverse perspectives 2. Continuous learning and development together 3. Celebrating successes and milestones - despite how little or large they may be 4. Prioritizing staff mental and physical health. Let's cherish these moments, support each other, and strive to create a positive work environment every day. #WorkplaceCulture #PositiveVibes #TeamSpirit #ProfessionalGrowth #InclusionMatters\n\nSomeone asked me this week how I was able to turn a project so quickly (and deliver a few days ahead of schedule) and I wasn't really sure how to answer that... until I saw this post. We use most (if not all) of these phrases as we build project plans, as well as when we move through projects...most of which touch many different teams within our fast paced department. This shows that creating a positive workplace really is the key (and baseline) for building trust, stream lining processes and working efficiently and effectively as a group.\n\nHappy to share this charming poem, \"Cottleston Pie,\" which encapsulates a profound truth in its simplicity. Just as a fly cannot become a bird, each of us possesses unique strengths and abilities that define our essence. This whimsical verse reminds us to embrace our individuality and appreciate the inherent beauty in diversity. In a world where comparison often leads to self-doubt, let us celebrate the uniqueness of each person's journey and find joy in our own capabilities. What insights does this poem evoke for you?
