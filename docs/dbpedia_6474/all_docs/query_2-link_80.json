        "text": "Sometimes writing touches on the more suffocating aspects of life. Marge Piercy’s “A Work of Artifice” captures that tension between care and captivity perfectly.\n\nAmerican poet and writer Marge Piercy (1936-) grew up and came of age in the Midwest. She first began publishing her poems in the 1960’s, and much of her writing reflects the social and political themes of that time, especially as they related to women’s lives. In 1976, Piercy published Woman on the Edge of Time, which has since been credited as the birthplace of the cyberpunk genre.\n\nPiercy’s poem “A Work of Artifice” similarly engages with the role of women in society. It begins by discussing a bonsai tree that must be cultivated and guided in order to form its shape. Without the care of man, the tree would grow much larger and appear much wilder than it does from in its pot. It quickly becomes evident that the narrator is hardly talking about a tree at all. For the narrator, the way that men control the bonsai tree is a metaphor for the way in which women have been controlled through “bound feet” and other standards of beauty and respectability. In this case, being loved and “pruned” means that neither a bonsai nor a woman will be allowed to reach her full potential.\n\nIn addition to the reading of the poem linked above, the full text of the poem, via Poem Hunter, is below.\n\n— — —"
