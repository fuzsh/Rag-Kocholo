        "text": "Woman on the Edge of Time by Marge Piercy\n\nCall Number: PS3566.I4 W65\n\nHailed as a classic of speculative fiction, Marge Piercy's landmark novel is a transformative vision of two futures--and what it takes to will one or the other into reality. Connie Ramos is a Mexican American woman living on the streets of New York. Once ambitious and proud, she has lost her child, her husband, her dignity--and now they want to take her sanity. After being unjustly committed to a mental institution, Connie is contacted by an envoy from the year 2137, who shows her a time of sexual and racial equality, environmental purity, and unprecedented self-actualization. But Connie also bears witness to another potential outcome: a society of grotesque exploitation in which the barrier between person and commodity has finally been eroded. One will become our world. And Connie herself may strike the decisive blow.\n\nHe, She and It by Marge Piercy\n\nCall Number: PS3566.I4 H44\n\nIn the middle of the twenty-first century, life as we know it has changed for all time. Shira Shipman's marriage has broken up, and her young son has been taken from her by the corporation that runs her zone, so she has returned to Tikva, the Jewish free town where she grew up. There, she is welcomed by Malkah, the brilliant grandmother who raised her, and meets an extraordinary man who is not a man at all, but a unique cyborg implanted with intelligence, emotions--and the ability to kill.\n\nWhat Are Big Girls Made Of? by Marge Piercy\n\nCall Number: PS3566.I4 W48 1997\n\nWhat Are Big Girls Made Of? is full of poems - funny, serious, angry, delightful - that illumine the experience of being a woman. The title poem is a lament for women who allow themselves to be caught in the painful dilemma of being retooled, refitted and redesigned to match the style of every decade. Some of the book's most beautiful poems are about the precarious balance of nature: white butterflies mating in Labor Day morning steam (a poem for Rosh Hashana); a little green snake slithering back to the camouflage safety of grass; the cool song of an October lunar eclipse, as opposed to the dangerous implications of the sun's disappearance; the death of an exquisite doe. Appropriately, from a poet who so winningly celebrates life in all its many variations, the book ends with the moving and simple The Art of Blessing the Day.\n\nSmall Changes by Marge Piercy\n\nCall Number: PS3566.I4 S62\n\nIn the choices two different women make, we discover the lives of all women. Small Changes is the explosive novel of women struggling to make their places in a man's world. Set against the early days of the feminist movement, it tells of two women and the choices they must face. Intelligent, sensual Miriam Berg trades her doctorate for a marriage and security, only to find herself hungry for a life of her own--but terrified of losing her husband. Shy, frightened Beth ran away from the very life Miriam seeks, ran away to a new world of different ideas, and a different kind of love--the love of another woman."
