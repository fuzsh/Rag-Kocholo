        "text": "Some readers may avoid Marge Piercy’s The Hunger Moon simply because of her reputation as a social activist and radical feminist, but that would be a mistake. Her new and selected poems, which span the past 30 years, deserve to be read without labels.\n\nThose who do so will quickly find that the poems are surprising, inviting, and engaging because Piercy always takes a bold, confident stance, even when she changes her perspective – over time – or shares wisdom that sounds almost commonplace.\n\n8 best books of April 2011: Amazon editors choose\n\nIn the opening poem, for example, she takes aim at complacency and laziness in relationships:\n\nWe walk all over the common miracles\n\nwithout bothering to wipe our feet.\n\nThen we wonder why we need more\n\nand more salt to taste our food.\n\nMy old man, my old lady, my\n\nball and chain: listen, even the cat\n\nyou found starving in the alley\n\nwho purrs you to sleep dancing\n\nwith kneading paws in your hair\n\nwill vanish if your heart closes its fist.\n\nThe poem establishes Piercy as a trustworthy guide, so readers follow her willingly through several pages where she describes how she felt about marriage and love years ago – as traps to be avoided. This earlier perspective is part of her evolution, which feels like an important and shared journey.\n\nThe same is true in the second section of poems, from “My Mother’s Body,” where Piercy casts a clear and sometimes withering eye at her mother, who allowed social expectations to smother her until “The anger turned inward, the anger/ turned inward where/ could it go except to make pain?/ It flowed into me with her milk.”\n\nThat relationship, always defined by tension, is a crucial theme for both the book and the poet. A young Piercy becomes an activist while her mother acts like a spectator in her own life. Later, when her mother dies, Piercy mellows and changes, finding meaning and solace in Jewish religious practices that her parents had not followed. (“What is to be said?” she asks her father. “Did you have a religion?/ If so, you never spoke of it to me.”)\n\nBut for herself, today, it’s a different story. In “The Head of the Year,” for example, she writes: “The light you seek hides/ in your belly. The light you/ crave longs to stream from/ your eyes. You are the moon/ that will wax in new goodness.”\n\nPiercy’s spiritual awakening is one reason “The Hunger Moon” is worth reading, as is her defense of people who have no voice.\n\nPerhaps more surprising, for those who don’t know her work well, are her nature poems and the many pages where her cats serve as friends, companions, children, and teachers. (“You feed me, I try to feed you, we are friends,” her cat tells her in “The cat’s song,” “although I am superior to you.”) Her beloved domestic animals become the nurturing family she lacked as a child, and they nudge her, quietly, toward other transformations – including a happy, stable marriage after two divorces.\n\n“The Hunger Moon” includes love poetry as well. In “The First Time I Tasted You,” Piercy writes:\n\nFrom your body I eat\n\nand drink all I will ever\n\nknow of passionate love\n\nfrom now till death\n\ndrains the chalice.\n\nPiercy’s affectionate lines to her husband, Ira, are sensual and sometimes graphic (as are some other poems). Yet her feelings for him may represent her most radical shift yet – the nonconformist poet finding peace in one of the oldest social conventions – something her mother did not do.\n\nThe new work in “The Hunger Moon” is rather uneven, but the selected poems deserve to be read over and over because they work together beautifully and demonstrate the poet’s considerable talent and skill. They also remind readers why Marge Piercy is a literary icon whose work and career are unmatched.\n\nElizabeth Lund regularly reviews poetry for the Monitor.\n\nJoin the Monitor's book discussion on Facebook and Twitter."
