        "text": "POETRY DISPATCH No.383 | October 5, 2012\n\nMARGE PIERCY\n\nEditor’s Note: We must remember to revisit our own bookshelves more frequently for lost books, lost authors, writers who once made a difference in our lives even though we’ve moved on to other places these days, other interests, other ideas, and the stories and poems and books which once spoke to us have been gathering dust for years. I find myself late at night searching for something among all my poetry titles—and find something else instead. An old friend. Hmmmmmm…Marge Piercy…where have you been, love?…it’s been such a long, long time…\n\nHmmmm, this is exactly the kind of poetry I had in mind…something I knew I had somewhere on my shelves. Exactly what the doctor would prescribe for a writing-friend to take to heart, mind, art…in a time of need.\n\nThumbing through the pages, rereading poems here and there, I recall putting this book in any number of hands: students, poets/writers who have never read it. Poets who are blocked, readers who just love to read poetry. Poets who are not quite beginners but new writers who have all the tools already at their disposal (perhaps born with them) yet are not sure what they should be making of everything. (For beginning poets…my preference would be ‘concrete’ imagery alone…haiku. Begin there.)\n\nWhat Marge Piercy brings to the table in MY MOTHER’S BODY is an honest simplicity of language, such an everydayness of narrative welcoming one-and-all, layering, spreading into a poetry of resonance both recognizable and profound in the mystery of afterthought. It’s all so good, so satisfying, you want to read it again immediately, to taste it twice, to re-live the narrative, to allow the poem to inhabit you till you see everything so clearly, so differently.\n\nThis is the kind of poetry that works best. The skill, the workmanship, the artistry is there…yet the poet isn’t addressing the reader in a second language, as too many poets do these days. Nor does the poet speak down leaving you with chunks of prose, nothing that glows with an inner light.\n\nSo I take this book off the shelf, prepare to put it in my briefcase to either mail or hand to a friend tomorrow. But then, with books like these that I’ve rediscovered, poems like these that re-energize my faith in the written word once again—I just can’t part with it. I even catch myself entertaining the notion of not revealing my love for this book to anyone, let alone pass it on one to someone who needs it at the moment much more than I. It’s mine. I will never let it go. Who knows when I may need it again?\n\nInstead I go to the computer…go to the internet…check the book dealers…find a good, affordable used copy…and send it to a friend who needs it. — Norbert Blei\n\nThe Listmaker\n\nI am a compiler of lists: 1 bag\n\nfine cracked corn, 1 sunflower seeds.\n\nThin tomato seedlings in hotbed;\n\ncheck dahlias for sprouting.\n\nWrite Kathy. Call Lou. Pay\n\noil bill. Decide about Montana.\n\nI find withered lists in pockets\n\nof raincoats, reminders to buy birthday\n\npresents for lovers who wear those warm\n\nsweaters now in other lives. And what\n\ndid I decide about Montana? To believe\n\nor disbelieve in its existence?\n\nTo rise at five some morning and fly there?\n\nA buried assent or denial rots beneath.\n\nI confess too that sometimes when I am listing\n\nwhat I must do on a Monday, I will put on\n\ntasks already completed for the neat pleasure\n\nof striking them out, checking them off.\n\nWhat do these lists mean? That I mistrust my memory,\n\nthat my attention, a huge hungry crow\n\nsettling to carrion even on the highway\n\nhates to rise and flap off, wants to continue\n\nfeasting on what it has let down upon\n\nfolding the tent of its broad dusty wings.\n\nThat I like to conquer chaos one square\n\nat a time like a board game.\n\nThat I fear the sins of omission more\n\nthan commission. That the whining saw\n\nof the mill of time shrieks always in my ears\n\nas I am borne with all the other logs\n\nforward to be dismantled and rebuilt\n\ninto chairs, into frogs, into running water.\n\nAll lists start where they halt, in intention.\n\nOnly the love that is work completes them.\n\nPeaches in November\n\nOn the peach’s wide sieve of branches\n\nthe buds crouch already in whitish caterpillar fur.\n\nAll winter they must hold tight, as the supple\n\nlimbs are strained wide by the snow’s weight,\n\nas the ice coats them and turns them to glinting\n\nsmall lights that splinter the sun to prickles.\n\nMust hold tight against the wet warm tongue\n\nof the thaw that lolls off the Gulf Stream\n\nsmelling of seaweed and the South, as if\n\nnot spring visited but summer in January.\n\nHold tight against the early March sun\n\nwith the wild tulips already opening\n\nagainst the brown earth like painted mouths\n\nwhen the ice will return as a thief\n\nto take what has too widely trusted.\n\nThe news they carry can only be told once\n\nto the bees each year. The bud is the idea\n\nof sweetness, of savor, of round heft\n\nwaiting to build itself. As the winter\n\nclamps down they hibernate in fur,\n\nlittle polar bears on red twigs\n\ndreaming of turning one sun into many.\n\nSix Underrated Pleasures\n\n1. Folding sheets\n\nThey must be clean.\n\nThere ought to be two of you\n\nto talk as you work, your\n\neyes and hands meeting.\n\nThey can be crisp, a little rough\n\nand fragrant from the line;\n\nor hot from the dryer\n\nas from an oven. A silver\n\ngrey kitten with amber\n\neyes to dart among\n\nthe sheets and wrestle and leap out\n\nhelps. But mostly pleasure\n\nlies in the clean linen\n\nslapping into shape.\n\nWhenever I fold a fitted sheet\n\nmaking the moves that are like\n\nclosing doors, I feel my mother.\n\nThe smell of clean laundry is hers.\n\n2. Picking pole beans\n\nGathering tomatoes has no art\n\nto it. Their ripe redness shouts.\n\nBut the scarlet runner beans twine\n\nhigh and jungly on their tripods.\n\nYou must reach in delicately,\n\npinch off the sizable beans\n\nbut leave the babies to swell\n\ninto flavor. It is hide-and-seek,\n\nstanding knee deep in squash\n\nplants running, while the bees\n\nmust be carefully disentangled\n\nfrom your hair. Early you may see\n\nthe hummingbird, but best to wait\n\nuntil the dew burns off.\n\nBasket on your arm, your fingers\n\ngo swimming through the raspy leaves\n\nto find prey just their size.\n\nThen comes the minor zest\n\nof nipping the ends off with your nails\n\nand snapping them in pieces,\n\ntheir retorts like soft pistolry.\n\nThen eat the littlest raw.\n\n3. Taking a hot bath\n\nSurely nobody has ever decided\n\nto go on a diet while in a tub.\n\nThe body is beautiful stretched\n\nout under water wavering.\n\nIt suggests a long island of pleasure\n\nwhole seascapes of calm sensual\n\nresponse, the nerves as gentle fronds\n\nof waterweed swaying in warm currents.\n\nThen if ever we must love ourselves i\n\nn the amniotic fluid floating\n\na ship at anchor in a perfect\n\nprotected blood-warm tropical bay.\n\nThe water enters us and the minor\n\npains depart, supplanted guests,\n\nthe aches, the strains, the chills.\n\nMuscles open like hungry clams.\n\nBorn again from my bath like a hot\n\nsweet-tempered, sweet-smelling baby,\n\nI am ready to seize sleep like a milky breast\n\nor start climbing my day hand over hand.\n\n4. Sleeping with cats\n\nI am at once source\n\nand sink of heat: giver\n\nand taker. I am a vast\n\nsoft mountain of slow breathing.\n\nThe smells I exude soothe them:\n\nthe lingering odor of sex,\n\nof soap, even of perfume,\n\nits afteraroma sunk into skin\n\nmingling with sweat and the traces\n\nof food and drink.\n\nThey are curled into flowers\n\nof fur, they are coiled\n\nhot seashells of flesh\n\nin my armpit, around my head\n\nas if someone said, Close\n\nyour eyes and draw a picture.\n\nNow open them and look.\n\n5. Planting bulbs\n\nNo task could be easier.\n\nJust dig the narrow hole,\n\ndrop in the handful of bone\n\nmeal and place the bulb\n\nlike a swollen brown garlic\n\nclove full of hidden resources.\n\nTheir skin is the paper\n\nof brown bags. The smooth\n\npale flesh peeks through.\n\nThree times its height\n\nis its depth, a parable\n\nagainst hard straining.\n\nThe art is imagining\n\nthe spring landscape poking\n\nthrough chrysanthemum, falling\n\nleaves, withered brown lushness\n\nof summer. The lines drawn\n\nnow, the colors mixed\n\nwill pop out of the soil\n\nafter the snow sinks from sight\n\ninto it. The circles,\n\nthe casual grace of tossed handfuls,\n\nthe soldierly rows will stand,\n\nthe colors sing sweet or sour.\n\nWhen the first sharp ears\n\npoke out, you are again\n\nmore audience than actor,\n\nas if someone said, Close\n\nyour eyes and draw a picture.\n\nNow open them and look.\n\n6. Canning\n\nWe pour a mild drink each,\n\nturn on the record player,\n\nBeethoven perhaps or Vivaldi,\n\nopera sometimes, and then together\n\nin the steamy kitchen we put up\n\ntomatoes, peaches, grapes, pears.\n\nEach fruit has a different\n\nritual: popping the grapes\n\nout of the skins like little\n\neyeballs, slipping the fuzz\n\nfrom the peaches and seeing\n\nthe blush painted on the flesh beneath.\n\nIt is part game: What shall\n\nwe magic wand this into?\n\nPeach conserve, chutney, jam,\n\nbrandied peaches. Tomatoes\n\nturn juice, sauce hot or mild\n\nor spicy, canned, ketchup.\n\nVinegars, brandies, treats\n\nfor the winter: pleasure\n\ndeferred. Canning is thrift\n\nitself in sensual form,\n\nsurplus made beautiful, light\n\nand heat caught in a jar.\n\nI find my mother sometimes\n\nissuing from the steam, aproned,\n\nred faced, her hair up in a net.\n\nSince her death we meet usually\n\nin garden or kitchen. Ghosts\n\ncome reliably to savors, I learn.\n\nIn the garden your ashes,\n\nin the kitchen your knowledge.\n\nLittle enough we can save\n\nfrom the furnace of the sun\n\nwhile the bones grow brittle as paper\n\nand the hair itself turns ashen.\n\nBut what we can put by, we do\n\nwith gaiety and invention\n\nwhile the music laps round us\n\nlike dancing light, but Mother,\n\nthis pleasure is only deferred.\n\nWe eat it all before it spoils.\n\n[from MY MOTHER’S BODY, Poems by Marge Piercy, Pandora Press, 1985]"
