For some reason, though, her book “The Twelve Spoke Wheel Flashing” ended up in my carry on, and I read her poems while accompanying my husband during the car shows. I will share a few of the pictures I took of the poems, framed by classic automobiles, starting this week.\n\nThe poem pictured to the right is an excellent example of Piercy at her best, when she is clear, thorough and cutting. Below is the full text of the dystopian piece.\n\nThe Meaningful Exchange\n\nThe man talks\n\nthe woman listens\n\nThe man is a teapot\n\nwith a dark green brew\n\nof troubles.\n\nHe pours into the woman.\n\nShe carries his sorrows away\n\nsloshing in her belly.\n\nThe man swings off lighter.\n\nSympathy quickens him.\n\nHe watches women pass.\n\nHe whistles.\n\nThe woman lumbers away.\n\nInside his troubles are\n\nsnaking up through her throat.\n\nHer body curls delicately\n\nabout them, worrying, nudging\n\nthem into some new meaningful shape\n\nsquatting now at the centre of her life.\n\nHow much lighter I feel,\n\nthe man says, ready\n\nfor business.\n\nHow heavy I feel, the woman\n\nsays: this must be love."
