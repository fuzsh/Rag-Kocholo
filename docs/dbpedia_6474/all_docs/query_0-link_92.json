        "text": "Click here for details and to register for our new Write Together session in early June. I’d love to see you in the Zoom room!\n\nOne of my grandmothers worked as a legal secretary in a Manhattan law firm, proud of her skill with shorthand and typing. Once, her boss, who was otherwise a good guy, yelled at her in front of the entire secretarial pool. Later that day he called her into his office to apologize. You shouted at me in public, she said, and you’ll apologize to me in public. Which he did.\n\nMy grandmother marched in the streets of New York as a suffragette. She had her first and only child at age forty and raised her with a love at once fierce and unconditional. This poem made me think of her, as I often do, and her hard, brave life. It hurts me to remember how much she always wanted to go to France. One of my first short stories, drafted while sitting on a bench on Sacré-Coeur, was about a young woman wandering the streets of Paris in honor of the grandmother who never had the means to travel.\n\nMy time in better dresses, by Marge Piercy\n\nI remember job hunting in my shoddy\n\nand nervous working class youth,\n\nhow I had to wear nylons and white\n\ngloves that were dirty in half an hour\n\nfor jobs that barely paid for shoes.\n\nDon’t put down Jew, my mother\n\nwarned, just say Protestant, it\n\ndoesn’t commit you to anything.\n\nAds could still say “white” and\n\nin my childhood, we weren’t.\n\nI worked in better dresses in Sam’s\n\ncut-rate department store, $3.98\n\nand up. I wasn’t trusted to sell.\n\nI put boxes together, wrapped,\n\ncleaned out dressing rooms.\n\nMy girlfriend and I bought a navy\n\ntaffeta dress with cutout top, wore it\n\none or the other to parties, till it failed\n\nmy sophistication test. The older\n\n“girls” in sales, divorced, sleek,\n\nimpressed me, but the man in charge\n\nI hated, the way his eyes stroked,\n\nstripped, discarded. How he docked\n\nour pay for lateness. How he sucked\n\non his power like a piece of candy.\n\nClick here for more information about Marge Piercy."
