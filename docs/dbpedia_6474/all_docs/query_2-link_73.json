        "text": "“What are Marge Piercy’s Best Books?” We looked at all of Piercy’s authored bibliography and ranked them against one another to answer that very question!\n\nWe took all of the books written by Marge Piercy and looked at their Goodreads, Amazon, and LibraryThing scores, ranking them against one another to see which books came out on top. The books are ranked in our list below based on which titles have the highest overall score between all 3 review sites in comparison with all of the other books by the same author. The process isn’t super scientific and in reality, most books aren’t “better” than other books as much as they are just different. That being said, we do enjoy seeing where our favorites landed, and if you aren’t familiar with the author at all, the rankings can help you see what books might be best to start with.\n\nThe full ranking chart is also included below the countdown on the bottom of the page.\n\nHappy Scrolling!\n\nThe Top Book’s Of Marge Piercy\n\n39 ) The Third Child\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 39\n\nAmazon: 33\n\nLibraryThing: 37\n\nUnder her mother’s constant scrutiny and lost in the shadow of her famous senator father, Melissa is the third child in the politically prominent Dickenson family, where ambition comes first and Melissa often comes last. In college, she meets Blake, a man of mixed race and apparently unknown parentage. His adoptive parents are lawyers whose defense of death-row cases in the past brought them head-to-head with Melissa’s father when he was the governor of Pennsylvania. While Melissa and Blake’s attraction is immediate and fiery, a dangerous secret lurks beneath their relationship — one that could destroy them … and their families.\n\n38 ) Breaking Camp Review Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 38\n\nAmazon: 34\n\nLibraryThing: 35\n\n37 ) Dance The Eagle To Sleep\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 33\n\nAmazon: 30\n\nLibraryThing: 36\n\nThey call themselves the Indians.

At five feet three inches, however, Suzanne Blume feels “too small for her role in the world.” To compensate, this pint-sized divorcee has transformed herself into a human dynamo, obsessively slicing and dicing the time she devotes to her mother, her two daughters, her students, and her e-mail boyfriend. Yet this rigorously arranged world is turned upside down when her problematic older daughter moves in, followed by her stubborn, ailing mother.\n\n35 ) Storm Tide\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 37\n\nAmazon: 28\n\nLibraryThing: 26\n\nAfter his dreams of playing baseball in the Majors fall short and his marriage ends, David Greene returns to his small hometown on Cape Cod.

Into this explosive mix, a young woman appears–a single mother at the end of her emotional rope. Crystal desperately needs David. Yet caught between two women, David bears witness to a heartbreaking turn of events that seems as inevitable as the push and pull of ocean waves. . . .\n\n34 ) Fly Away Home Review Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 29\n\nAmazon: 29\n\nLibraryThing: 29\n\nSuccessful Boston cookbook author Daria Walker, whose greatest pleasures are her home and family — and who loves her husband deeply — is devastated to learn he wants a divorce.

Dinah, an avante-garde compler, treasures her independence. Yet it takes Willie’s kindness and Susan’s fire to sustain her. Willie is a left-wing sculptor in a right-wing age. And Susan, his wife, is a fabric designer who craves glamour, wealth, and the attentions of the summer people who visit Cape Cod every year. Then one summer, the balance shifts. Passions are tested, honesty forsaken, and the trio must face the changes brought by their beautiful visitors . . .\n\n32 ) Going Down Fast Review Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 31\n\nAmazon: 23\n\nLibraryThing: 23\n\nAs a blighted neighborhood is invaded by a university — an institution that promises to bring new life — the people who live there are forced to go along with too many changes, too fast. There is Anna, a woman living through a succession of losses — marriage, job, home, and lover. And Rowley, a blue-eyed soul singer whose greatest limitation is his belief that he is powerless. Together with Leon, an underground filmmaker, and Caroline, a beautiful woman with a dark and desperate secret, they watch the progress of the wrecking ball, hoping, as always, for something better . . . maybe even love.\n\n31 ) Small Changes\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 25\n\nAmazon: 23\n\nLibraryThing: 28\n\nSet against the early days of the modern feminist movement, SMALL CHANGES tells the story of sensual Miriam Berg, who trades her doctorate for marriage and security, but still hungers for a life of her ow,n and shy, frightened Beth who is running from the life Miriam seeks and into a new world of different ideas and a different kind of love….\n\n30 ) Vida\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 27\n\nAmazon: 20\n\nLibraryThing: 27\n\nVida was their star–the beautiful, charismatic radical from the pages of LIFE magazine–the symbol of the passionate rebellion of the sixties. Now, ten years later, the shouting is over, but Vida is still on the run. Staying in Network hideouts, traveling disguised, fearing every glance, she finds her best protection is her distrust of everyone–a lesson learned from past treacheries. And now, knowing the dangers, she finds herself warming again toward a man, an outcast ten years younger than herself.\n\n29 ) Sex Wars\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 29\n\nAmazon: 18\n\nLibraryThing: 23\n\nPost–Civil War New York City is the battleground of the American dream. In this era of free love, emerging rights of women, and brutal sexual repression, Freydeh, a spirited young Jewish immigrant, toils at different jobs to earn passage to America for her family. Learning that her younger sister is adrift somewhere in the city, she begins a determined search that carries her from tenement to brothel to prison—as her story interweaves with those of some of the epoch’s most notorious figures: Elizabeth Cady Stanton; Susan B. Anthony; sexual freedom activist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president; and Anthony Comstock, founder of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, whose censorship laws are still on the books. In the tradition of her bestselling World War II epic Gone to Soldiers, Marge Piercy once again re-creates a turbulent period in American history and explores changing attitudes in a land of sacrifice, suffering, promise, and reward.\n\n28 ) The High Cost of Living\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 35\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 32\n\nFor Leslie, the cost of living–and loving–is getting higher and higher.

She pays tribute to the one loving constant that has offered her comfort and meaning even as the faces and events in her life have changed — her beloved cats. With searing honesty, Piercy tells of her strained childhood growing up in a religiously split, working-class family in Detroit. She examines her myriad friendships and relationships, including two painful early marriages, and reveals their effects on her creativity and career. More than a reminiscence of things past, however, Sleeping With Cats is also a celebration of the present and the future, as Piercy shares her views on aging, creativity, and finding a lasting and improbable love with a man fourteen years younger than herself. A chronicle of the turbulent and exciting journey of one artist’s life, Sleeping With Cats is a deeply intimate, unforgettable story.\n\n26 ) City of Darkness, City of Light\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 21\n\nAmazon: 27\n\nLibraryThing: 19\n\nIn her most splendid, thought-provoking novel yet, Marge Piercy brings to vibrant life three women who play prominent roles in the tumultuous, bloody French Revolution–as well as their more famous male counterparts.

Manon Philipon finds she has a talent for politics–albeit as the ghostwriter of her husband’s speeches. . . . And Pauline Léon knows one thing for certain: the women must apply the pressure or their male colleagues will let them starve. While illuminating the lives of Robespierre, Danton, and Condorcet, Piercy also opens to us the minds and hearts of women who change their world, live their ideals–and are prepared to die for them.\n\n25 ) The Longings of Women\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 26\n\nAmazon: 18\n\nLibraryThing: 20\n\n“Her marriage over, her life unraveling, writer Leila Landsman turns to work, and finds herself drawn to the sensational story of Becky Burgess, a young woman accused of killing her husband with the help of her teenage lover. Becky thought she’d escaped the grim poverty of her childhood when she married up, but her husband was soon planning to trade her in for a newer model. And that’s just what happened to Mary Burke, whose middle class life ended with her divorce. Now Leila’s housecleaner, Mary has a secret: she is homeless.\n\nThey are three very different women who share the same longings: to be seen for who they are, to be valued and loved, but most of all, to have a physical and emotional home that can’t be taken away….”\n\n23 ) Early Grrrl\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 18\n\nAmazon: 34\n\nLibraryThing: 11\n\nThe ‘Grrrl’ phenomenon is a contemporary expression of young women’s humor and rage exploding in books and zines, concerts, films, and the internet. In homage to a new generation of tough young feminists, Marge Piercy presents a gathering of poems that reveal the poet as an early ‘Grrrl.’ Comprising over ninety poems selected from four books now out of print; poems previously published in literary magazines but never before collected and very early poems never published, this volume presents the bold and passionate political verse for which Piercy is well known alongside poems celebrating the sensual pleasures of gardening and cooking and sex; funny poems about New Year’s Eve and warring boom boxes; vulnerable poems in which a young working class woman from the Midwest takes stock of herself and the limits of her world. For longtime fans and those new to Piercy’s early work, this volume is an indispensable addition to the oeuvre of one of America’s best-known and best-selling poets.\n\n23 ) Parti-Colored Blocks For a Quilt\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 18\n\nAmazon: 34\n\nLibraryThing: 11\n\nPiercy writes of women and poetry and of woman becoming poet\n\n22 ) The Cost of Lunch\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 35\n\nAmazon: 22\n\nLibraryThing: 4\n\nIn this collection of short stories, bestselling author Marge Piercy brings us glimpses into the lives of everyday women moving through and making sense of their daily internal and external worlds.

From the first-person account of hoarding and a girl’s narrative of sexual and spiritual discovery to the recounting of a past love affair, each story is a tangible, vivid snapshot in a varied and subtly curated gallery of work. Whether grappling with death, familial relationships, friendship, sex, illness, or religion, Piercy’s writing is as passionate, lucid, insightful, and thoughtfully alive as ever.\n\n20 ) Woman on the Edge of Time\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 18\n\nAmazon: 26\n\nLibraryThing: 16\n\nConnie Ramos is a Mexican American woman living on the streets of New York.

But Connie also bears witness to another potential outcome: a society of grotesque exploitation in which the barrier between person and commodity has finally been eroded. One will become our world. And Connie herself may strike the decisive blow.\n\n20 ) Hard Loving\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 15\n\nAmazon: 34\n\nLibraryThing: 11\n\nThese poems are tough and tender, gritty with the urban landscape yet alive with reverence for the earth, enraged at the violence and injustices of man yet hopeful at the prospect of true community.\n\n19 ) Available Light\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 22\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 34\n\nPierce’s most compelling book of poems expresses the delights of the senses and the hard play of emotion.

Feisty and funny as always, she turns a sharp eye on the world around her, bidding an ex-hausted farewell to the twentieth century and singing an “electronic breakdown blues” for the twenty-first. She memorializes movingly those who, like los desaparecidos and the victims of 9/11, disappear suddenly and without a trace. She writes an elegy for her mother, a woman who struggled with a deadening round of housework, washing on Monday, ironing on Tuesday, and so on, “until stroke broke / her open.” She remembers the scraps of lace, the touch of velvet, that were part of her maternal inheritance and first aroused her sensual curiosity. Here are paeans to the pleasures of the natural world (rosy ripe tomatoes, a mating dance of hawks) as the poet confronts her own mortality in the cycle of seasons and the eternity of the cosmos: “I am hurrying, I am running hard / toward I don’t know what, / but I mean to arrive before dark.” Other poems-about her grandmother’s passage from Russia to the New World, or the interrupting of a Passover seder to watch a comet pass-expand on Piercy’s appreciation of Jewish life that won her so much acclaim in The Art of Blessing the Day. Colors Passing Through Us is a moving celebration of the endurance of love and of the phenomenon of life itself-a book to treasure.\n\n10 ) Mars and her Children\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 15\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 21\n\nA major new collection of poems about women’s lives and the closing circle of nature, from a bestselling poet. These poems celebrate the beauties of nature and the eternal cycle of love, death and birth that is being interrupted by the assault on the environment.\n\n9 ) My Mother’s Body\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 7\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 25\n\nMy Mother’s Body, Marge Piercy’s tenth book of poetry, takes its title from one of her strongest and most moving poems, the climax of a powerful sequence of Poems to her mother. Rooted in an honest, harrowing, but ally ecstatic confrontation of the mother / daughter relationship in all its complexity and intimacy, it is at the same time an affirmation of continuity and identification.\n\n8 ) The Hunger Moon: New and Selected Poems\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 10\n\nAmazon: 11\n\nLibraryThing: 11\n\nThis new gathering of Marge Piercy’s poems—energetic, funny, political, full of vitality—brings us the heart of her mature work, the first selected since Circles on the Water in 1982. Here are poems that chart the milestone events and fierce passions of her middle years: the death of her mother, whom we meet first as a young woman, “awkwardly lovely, her face / pure as a single trill perfectly / prolonged on a violin,” and again as an older woman musing on what the afterlife may hold for her. There is a new marriage which she celebrates not only for romantic beginnings but also for the more intimate details that emerge over time: “love cherishes too the backpockets, / the pencil ends of childhood fears.” Some poems convey her long-held, never-wavering political convictions, which she declares in language unmistakably and colorfully her own, as when she encourages her feminist readers to go to the opera instead of the movies because at least there the heroine is real, “fifty and weighs as much as a ’65 Chevy with fins.” Living out to sea on Cape Cod settles her into the rhythm of seasons and provides poems of planting and harvests, odes to tomatoes and roses, tributes to the power and freedom of whales. And in these years she rediscovers her Jewish heritage, celebrating holidays and making of them something new and original. She begins to examine her own legacy: I have worn the faces, the masks of hieroglyphs, gods and demons, bat faced ghosts, sibyls and thieves, lover, loser, red rose and ragweed, these are the tracks I have left on the white crust of time.\n\n6 ) What are Big Girls Made Of\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 11\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 16\n\nOpening with a powerful cycle of elegies for her long-distant, half-brother, this major new collection by one of our bestselling poets then goes on to include both serious and funny poems about women and poems about the precarious balance of nature, ending with the beautiful, life-affirming “The Art of Blessing the Day.”\n\n6 ) The Moon is Always Female\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 6\n\nAmazon: 15\n\nLibraryThing: 7\n\nHer seventh and most wide ranging collection. In the 1st of 2 sections, the poems move from the amusingly elegiac to the erotic, the classical to the funny. The 2nd section is a series of 15 poems for a calendar based on lunar rather than solar divisions\n\n5 ) Made in Detroit\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 12\n\nAmazon: 14\n\nLibraryThing: 1\n\nA treasure trove of new poems by one of our most sought-after poets: poems that range from descriptions of the Detroit of her childhood to her current life on Cape Cod, from deep appreciations of the natural world to elegies for lost friends and relationships, from a vision of her Jewish heritage to a hard-hitting take on today’s political ironies. In her trademark style, combining the sublime with the gritty, Marge Piercy describes the night she was born: “the sky burned red / over Detroit and sirens sharpened their knives. / The elms made tents of solace over grimy / streets and alley cats purred me to sleep.” She writes in graphic, unflinching language about the poor, banished now by politicians because they are no longer “real people like corporations.” There are elegies for her peer group of poets, gone now, whose work she cherishes but from whom she cannot help but want more. There are laments for the suicide of dolphins and for her beloved cats, as she remembers “exactly how I loved each.” She continues to celebrate Jewish holidays in compellingly original ways and sings praises of her marriage and the small pleasures of daily life. This is a stunning collection that will please those who already know Marge Piercy’s work and offer a splendid introduction to it for those who don’t.\n\n4 ) Gone To Soldiers\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 5\n\nAmazon: 15\n\nLibraryThing: 3\n\nIn a stunning tour-de-force, Marge Piercy has woven a tapestry of World War II, of six women and four men, who fought and died, worked and worried, and moved through the dizzying days of the war. A compelling chronicle of humans in conflict with inhuman events, GONE TO SOLIDERS is an unforgettable reading experience and a stirring tribute to the remarkable survival of the human spirit.\n\n3 ) Circles on the Water\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 3\n\nAmazon: 11\n\nLibraryThing: 5\n\n2 ) The Art of Blessing the Day: Poems With a Jewish Theme\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 1\n\nAmazon: 10\n\nLibraryThing: 7\n\nThe Art of Blessing the Day: Poems with a Jewish Theme, by Marge Piercy, is that rare book of self-avowedly religious poetry whose devotional purpose actually enhances its poetic strength. Piercy’s poems, organized in chapters with thematic headings like “Family,” “Marriage,” and “Prayer,” are plainly presented as help for living. Readers will turn to poems such as “Putting the Good Things Away” when they need inspiration for understanding their self-sacrificing mothers. Yet Piercy’s devotions are real poems with a literary integrity whose strength and beauty are free of sentimentality.\n\n1 ) Stone, Paper, Knife\n\nReview Website Ranks:\n\nGoodreads: 14\n\nAmazon: 1\n\nLibraryThing: 2\n\nMarge Piercy’s Best Books\n\nMarge Piercy Review Website Bibliography Rankings"
