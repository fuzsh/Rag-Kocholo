        "text": "(born 1936). The realistic novels by U.S. author Marge Piercy are about people, especially women, struggling against the injustices of modern society. An important feminist author, Piercy portrayed young left-wing radicals with sympathy and understanding. She also wrote poems of love, humor, and anger, often about everyday life and Jewish themes. (See also feminism.)\n\nPiercy was born on March 31, 1936, in Detroit, Michigan. She received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan in 1957 and a master’s degree from Northwestern University in Illinois the next year. She was active in the civil rights and antiwar movements in the 1960s, before she committed herself to the women’s movement in 1969.\n\nPiercy’s first novel, Going Down Fast (1969), shows young liberals who become radicals in response to political and social corruption. In Dance the Eagle to Sleep (1970), students form a loving alternative society in the midst of a totalitarian America of the near future. Another Piercy novel that used science-fiction devices is Woman on the Edge of Time (1976), in which an abused woman views an ideal America where men and women live in complete equality and freedom. The rise of the antiwar movement in the 1960s, its decline into violence, and its dissolution are the background of Vida (1980), the story of a political activist. Women survive their encounters with sexist men in Braided Lives (1982), Fly Away Home (1984), and The Longings of Women (1994). Three Women (1999) explores mother-daughter relationships.\n\nPiercy expressed a variety of intimate feelings in her many poems, which were collected in volumes such as To Be of Use (1973), Circles on the Water (1982), and The Art of Blessing the Day (1999). With Ira Wood, her husband, she wrote the play The Last White Class (1978) and the novel Storm Tide (1998). Her memoir, Sleeping with Cats, was published in 2001."
