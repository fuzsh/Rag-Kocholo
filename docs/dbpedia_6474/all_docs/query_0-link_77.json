        "text": "MORE THAN ENOUGH\n\nby Marge Piercy\n\nThe first lily of June opens its red mouth.\n\nAll over the sand road where we walk\n\nmultiflora rose climbs trees cascading\n\nwhite or pink blossoms, simple, intense\n\nthe scene drifting like colored mist.\n\nThe arrowhead is spreading its creamy\n\nclumps of flower and the blackberries\n\nare blooming in the thickets. Season of\n\njoy for the bee. The green will never\n\nagain be so green, so purely and lushly\n\nnew, grass lifting its wheaty seedheads\n\ninto the wind. Rich fresh wine\n\nof June, we stagger into you smeared\n\nwith pollen, overcome as the turtle\n\nlaying her eggs in roadside sand.\n\nSOURCE: “More than Enough” appears in Marge Piercy‘s 176-page collection Colors Passing Through Us (Alfred A. Knopf, 2003), available at Amazon.com.\n\nIMAGE: “June Lily” by Paul Trunk. Prints available at fineartamerica.com."
