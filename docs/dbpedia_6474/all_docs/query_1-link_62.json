        "text": "A friend spoke this poem today. It was a perfect cap to the learning circle that we had just completed.\n\nMarge Piercy is an American poet, novelist, and activist. I enjoy how her writings so often point to the theme of keeping it real – “build real houses, weave real connections, create real nodes.”\n\nThe Seven Of Pentacles\n\nBy Marge Piercy\n\nUnder a sky the color of pea soup\n\nshe is looking at her work growing away there\n\nactively, thickly like grapevines or pole beans\n\nas things grow in the real world, slowly enough.\n\nIf you tend them properly, if you mulch, if you water,\n\nif you provide birds that eat insects a home and winter food,\n\nif the sun shines and you pick off caterpillars,\n\nif the praying mantis comes and the ladybugs and the bees,\n\nthen the plants flourish, but at their own internal clock.\n\nConnections are made slowly, sometimes they grow underground.\n\nYou cannot tell always by looking what is happening.\n\nMore than half the tree is spread out in the soil under your feet.\n\nPenetrate quietly as the earthworm that blows no trumpet.\n\nFight persistently as the creeper that brings down the tree.\n\nSpread like the squash plant that overruns the garden.\n\nGnaw in the dark and use the sun to make sugar.\n\nWeave real connections, create real nodes, build real houses.\n\nLive a life you can endure: Make love that is loving.\n\nKeep tangling and interweaving and taking more in,\n\na thicket and bramble wilderness to the outside but to us\n\ninterconnected with rabbit runs and burrows and lairs."
