        "text": "I love this so much! Everything on this list I have said to my staff in the past week. Leaders are human and we need to treat our staff with compassion and help them grow. There should be zero expectation of anyone knowing everything. Mistakes are inevitable and space should be given for them to be made and lessons learned, for all individuals. If things arent working, its our job to HELP them figure out a solution. We hire people to do their jobs, let them do it and know they probably have a better grasp on some situations than we do so we should absolutely trust their judgment. When given training on yearly performance evaluations we are told that staff shouldn't be finding out about things they aren't doing well at that time, the same goes for the good things they are doing. A quick good job on x thing can go a long way.\n\nEvery workplace has phases, but the positive ones truly shape our professional journey. Simple phrases like the ones below create a positive team environment for my team. Here's to: 1. Team Collaboration and diverse perspectives 2. Continuous learning and development together 3. Celebrating successes and milestones - despite how little or large they may be 4. Prioritizing staff mental and physical health. Let's cherish these moments, support each other, and strive to create a positive work environment every day. #WorkplaceCulture #PositiveVibes #TeamSpirit #ProfessionalGrowth #InclusionMatters"
