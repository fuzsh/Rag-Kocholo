        "text": "This article considers the question of feminist futurity through Marge Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time (1976). While dominant readings of this novel have focused on its relationship to the feminist utopian genre and feminist theory from the 1970s, this essay aims to critically reframe the novel through contemporary feminist theorising on time and futurity. Drawing on recent feminist and queer theory that suggests that the future might most productively be figured through more nuanced and renewed engagements with the past, I argue that readings of Piercy’s novel that frame it only through its contemporary moment obscure the novel’s critique of singular, linear models of time. The novel represents the future through the themes of loss, mourning and haunting, which I argue resist a model of time that moves linearly from past to future and instead bring the past and future into complex relation with each other. In this regard, Piercy’s novel is read as representing a form of feminist futurity that engages with progress in time as necessarily uneven, discontinuous and fractured, speaking to contemporary demands for a feminist futurity that might require more nuanced accounts of the past.\n\nFeminist dystopia is not isolated from or even antagonistic to the dystopian tradition at large: The history, development and characteristics of feminist dystopianism draw from feminist theory and social critique but also from the ways in which the literary utopia and dystopia have articulated cultural hopes and fears grounded in a critical as- sessment of the present moment. The concept ‘feminism’ as used in dystopian/utopian studies is usually implicitly understood to refer to a critique of social structures or cul- tural patterns that have disadvantaged women. Yet feminism has never been a coherent movement and has changed considerably since the first known critical engagements with the so-called woman question. Feminist dystopia is thus best studied as a nodal point that intersects with dystopian science fiction, feminist theory, and particularly feminist utopian writing. Feminist speculation about a better world goes back to the earliest examples of uto- pian writing with texts such as Christine de Pizan’s The Book of the City of Ladies (1404/05; cf. Johns 2010: 174). Feminist dystopia emerged in the 1970s from this tradi- tion by importing key elements of the literary dystopia, such as the focus on and exten- sion of repressive structures in the present and the satirical critique of these structures. However, since both classical utopia and dystopia have traditionally been affirmative of gender hierarchies, the feminist dystopia also includes a critique of the genre itself. My exploration of feminist dystopia in this chapter focuses on its initiating mo- ment in the 1970s. Joanna Russ’s The Female Man and Marge Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time have usually been read as examples of feminist utopian writing (with the notable exception of Booker and Thomas 2009), even though they are, like most femi- nist utopian writing in the 1970s utopian only in part, as Angelika Bammer argued in Partial Visions. I argue here that these two novels can be seen as prototypical feminist dystopian texts in the 1970s, constituting the beginnings of feminist dystopianism in the midst of the utopian renaissance. As such, the two novels have a lot in common: Both present the basic narrative world as dystopia for women; both include a partial utopia and its dystopian nemesis; both show that this utopia is only one of many possi- ble futures that depends on individual and collective action taken in the present mo- ment; and, finally, both novels are grounded in a powerful sense of utopian hope, while also expressing profound pessimism. The way in which these two novels incor- porate and mix science fiction, dystopia, utopia, and realist fiction, deploying the inter- relations and tensions between these genre traditions, undermines the rationalism and transparent storytelling practices of all of these traditions. In the wake of the complex critique articulated in these novels, the 1980s and 1990s produced a number of femi- nist dystopias that responded to cultural transformations by giving the dystopian ele- ment a more prominent presence. However, the paradigm established by Joanna Russ and Marge Piercy has continued to be productive in feminist fictions of the future.\n\nScience Fiction has always provided a platform for female writers to express their repressed desire for gender equity and ethical values through characters in alternative worlds. Through an Eco feministic reading of Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time, this article traces how Science Fiction writers envision social justice and ecological values. The novel oscillates between a dystopic reality and the fictional utopian future through the perspective of Connie while she is incarcerated in a mental hospital. As Devall and Sessions' observes \"the distance between what ought to be and what is now a reality in our technocratic industrial society\" (162) is evident in the novel. Apart from the external asylum that symbolizes the prison, life itself has become a prison for her under patriarchal domination. Her hallucinations symbolically imply her mental escape. Connie acts as a female voice, with her revolutionary thinking and actions to put a culmination to the system of domination by the capitalist society in which she is trapped. This paper attempts to analyse Piercy's treatment of gender, race, class, sexuality and ecological issues through the representation of marginalized communities like Connie. It opens up the future world of gender politics.\n\nThis paper will introduce two feminist utopian writings that present fictive worlds in whichmaternity is not only valued but stands at the center of the whole community, essentially includingevery citizen in reproductive work. Focusing on Charlotte Perkin Gilman‘s Herland (1915) and Marge Piercy‘s Women on the Edgeof Time (1976), this paper will trace the notion of motherhood in feminist utopian writing by working with a historical approach which examines the voices of first-wave and second-wave feminism correspondingly. Quinessentially, Gilman and Piercy put motherhood in the center of society to criticize the limiting definition of womenhood as motherhood and its imposition on women which restrain active participation in economical, political and societal issues by women in a patriarchal world. This andocentric reality stands in opposition to the feminist utopia that is flourishing in the hands of „mothers“. In the following pages these question will be subject: What is the feminist critique of motherhood? Who is qualified to be a mother? How do the maternal-centered worlds of Gilman and Piercy reflect feminist theories? How can utopian writing have realistic effects on political visions despite its fantastic content?"
