        "text": "Love and romance, with poems by Denise Rue, C. W. Emerson, Marge Piercy, Chuck Madansky and Dorothy Weil.\n\n7 minutes\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nIt’s that time of year when we give and get red roses and heart-shaped boxes of chocolates and love notes ranging from the goopy to the moving to the heart-poundingly sincere. It’s that time of year when we used to go out for a romantic dinner, but now in these Pandemic times, we stay home and remember when we used to go out for a romantic dinner.\n\nHere’s Denise Rue’s poem “The Language in Which I Love You” from Passager Issue 65. She said she wrote it “for the man I loved after my husband died. He too was widowed. It’s about the courage of the heart, how we go on after loss.”\n\nfor Rolando\n\nMi amor, I have tried to master the language learned at your mother’s knee,\n\narroz con pollo and pasteles on the stove, your father sipping Don Q,\n\ncousins dancing to Tito Rodriquez and Hector Lavoe.\n\nI have tried to master gender – the feminine artichoke, the masculine bone –\n\nmy tongue too tense to trill, a threshing machine of glottals and stops.\n\nSo I will love you in the language of unreasonable hope, blue ribbon’d\n\nand banjo-happy. The canary has died, the last chemicals\n\ndripped into veins. Aren’t we brave, to swim to each other’s shores,\n\nrefugee-hearted and stubborn, believing the promise\n\nof the manacle unclasped, your name tattooed on my wrist.\n\n“The Language in Which I Love You,” Denise Rue.\n\nNext, C. W. Emerson’s poem “Love and Bone.”\n\nIf we are only bodies –\n\nflesh and muscle, breath and bone,\n\ntemporary, fleeting,\n\nmotes of dust on a butterfly wing –\n\nthen let our time on earth\n\nbe a calendar of feasts:\n\ndays that bow, deep and shy,\n\nas if to hide how fine they are;\n\nand let the extravagant lace of evening\n\ncome and cover us like a veil –\n\nwe fortunate lovers,\n\nliving our lives,\n\nhere, in our carnal kingdom.\n\n“Love and Bone” by C.W. Emerson from Passager Issue 65. The author said, “My poetry teacher found the title too suggestive, but I like the juxtaposition of soft/love with hard /bone and the way they reverse positions.”\n\nIn 2011, Passager published an anthology of work from its first 21 years. The book was titled Burning Bright – from which this podcast got its name. Here from that anthology is the prolific Marge Piercy’s poem “They Don’t Tell You How Sex Changes.”\n\nSex impinges less as I grow older\n\nbut is more precious, that some\n\none, the one and only now,\n\nstill desires, that the furnace\n\ncan yet be lit and finally roar.\n\nIntimacy opens slowly as a rose –\n\nan old garden rose, a centifolia\n\nwith its crowded labyrinth of petals\n\ndark pink as labia, ruddy with\n\namorous perfume thick as honey.\n\nNo more quick ones in the bushes.\n\nWe like a bed and time that does\n\nnot press in constricting us.\n\nWe like to loll in moments before\n\nthe pulse rushes in toppling waves.\n\nWe take much pleasure in kissing\n\nthat once we passed through, gateway\n\nto what we really sought. We linger\n\nin sensuality keen as orgasm pro-\n\nlonged like an endless chord.\n\n“They Don’t Tell You How Sex Changes,” Marge Piercy.\n\nMarge Piercy lives in Wellfleet on Cape Cod. Chuck Madansky lives a few miles up-Cape in Dennis. Here’s his poem “Anniversary.”\n\nWe didn’t think of death when we first met.\n\nOur bodies felt each other out for truth.\n\nThe suns that never lighted us had set –\n\nthe brighter day we hoped for in our youth.\n\nYet there you were, a truth at last revealed:\n\nA grace, a gift, a molten light, a sun.\n\nWe found in love how broken could be healed,\n\nhow fetters on the spirit come undone.\n\nThough marriage long and deep has been a jewel,\n\nopening our eyes to every facet,\n\nthe truth is life itself, in death, is cruel,\n\nvoid of any way to leave or pass it.\n\nIn loving you, I’ve learned to love this life,\n\nworth dying for, as long as you’re my wife.\n\nFrom Passager Issue 70, “Anniversary” by Chuck Madansky.\n\nFinally, Dorothy Weil’s “The Gentleman Caller.”\n\nWhat will he wear?\n\nWill he have a smile on his face?\n\nWill he bring a corsage?\n\nOh, we have a date.\n\nWill he bare his teeth?\n\nDrag me by the hair\n\nOr put me down to sleep\n\nLike a good daddy?\n\nDo I know him?\n\nDoes he drive?\n\nIs he a bruiser?\n\nHe may forewarn me,\n\nTake things slow.\n\nHe may wear the mask of the ax man.\n\nOr a tuxedo.\n\nHe may creep up behind me\n\nWith a sudden blow.\n\nTorture might be his game.\n\nIs that his footstep on the stairs?\n\nI haven’t put my lipstick on,\n\nI haven’t brushed my hair . . .\n\n“The Gentleman Caller,” Dorothy Weil from Passager Issue 68.\n\nTo buy the anthology Burning Bright or subscribe to or learn more about Passager and its commitment to writers over 50, go to passagerbooks.com.\n\nYou can download Burning Bright from Spotify, Apple and Google Podcasts, Audible, and a host of other podcast apps.”\n\nFor Kendra, Mary, Christine, Rosanne, and the rest of the Passager staff, I’m Jon Shorr."
