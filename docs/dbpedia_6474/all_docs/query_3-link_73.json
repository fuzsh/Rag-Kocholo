        "text": "Years ago I attended a weekend workshop for writers led by Marge Piercy and her husband, Ira Wood. One of the enduring memories I have from that workshop was a question I asked Marge during the Q & A section of the workshop. She had mentioned earlier that she had written several novels (seems like it was 5 or 6) before she got her first book published.\n\nConsidering she said it took her a couple of years to write one novel, this was quite a feat of resilience, in my opinion. Not to mention that I was in a similar situation myself. So when given the opportunity, I asked her how she kept going during that time of getting several books rejected multiple times. Her answer surprised me. She said that she got angry!\n\nAt first my southern soul, trained since infanthood to be nice, was a bit shocked by this statement. Anger, said all my training, was not nice. But then it occurred to me that this was really about the healthiest and self-preserving thing she could do. Rather than being a victim to the process (and believe me I’ve met plenty of writer victims over the years), Marge Piercy took charge of the situation. She absolutely refused to give up. She spoke about becoming more political as a result. To the point that at the workshop she was incredibly frank about the reality of the writing profession and its injustices to all the wide-eyed, naive novices. She was so frank, in fact, that I wondered how many would-be writers were leaving their dreams at the door as they left. But I have thanked Marge Piercy many times for her honestly.\n\nI think there is wisdom in frankness, too. Over the years I’ve allowed myself to get angry over the inherent craziness in the process of getting my books out into the world. There is enough apathy, indifference, overwhelm and sometimes downright greed that goes on in the publishing world that not just writers are angry these days but agents and editors, as well. Great writers are passed over for the latest craze. Imprints are closed just as they’re about to sign your book to a contract. Endearing executive editors are replaced. Agents have stockpiles of fantastic material that they can’t sell because it’s too artful and not commercial enough. Not to mention everybody trying to keep up with the profound shifts occurring in the publishing industry with the advent of ebooks and indie publishing.\n\nSo if aspire to be a writer, or are already a professional, perhaps you need more than the most elaborate laptop on the market and all the typical writer’s tools. Maybe you should invest in a punching bag, too, or some other appropriate way to vent your anger. Marge Piercy would be proud of you, I bet. Whether seeking readers in traditional or indie ways, rev up your resilience and fight for what you believe in!"
