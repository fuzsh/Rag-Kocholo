        "text": "For the Young Who Want To\n\nBY MARGE PIERCY\n\nTalent is what they say\n\nyou have after the novel\n\nis published and favorably\n\nreviewed. Beforehand what\n\nyou have is a tedious\n\ndelusion, a hobby like knitting.\n\nWork is what you have done\n\nafter the play is produced\n\nand the audience claps.\n\nBefore that friends keep asking\n\nwhen you are planning to go\n\nout and get a job.\n\nGenius is what they know you\n\nhad after the third volume\n\nof remarkable poems. Earlier\n\nthey accuse you of withdrawing,\n\nask why you don’t have a baby,\n\ncall you a bum.\n\nThe reason people want M.F.A.’s,\n\ntake workshops with fancy names\n\nwhen all you can really\n\nlearn is a few techniques,\n\ntyping instructions and some-\n\nbody else’s mannerisms\n\nis that every artist lacks\n\na license to hang on the wall\n\nlike your optician, your vet\n\nproving you may be a clumsy sadist\n\nwhose fillings fall into the stew\n\nbut you’re certified a dentist.\n\nThe real writer is one\n\nwho really writes. Talent\n\nis an invention like phlogiston\n\nafter the fact of fire.\n\nWork is its own cure. You have to\n\nlike it better than being loved."
