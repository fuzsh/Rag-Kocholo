        "text": "By Marge Piercy\n\nThe hinge of the year\n\nthe great gates opening\n\nand then slowly slowly\n\nclosing on us.\n\nI always imagine those gates\n\nhanging over the ocean\n\nfiery over the stone grey\n\nwaters of evening.\n\nWe cast what we must\n\nchange about ourselves\n\nonto the waters flowing\n\nto the sea. The sins,\n\nerrors, bad habits, whatever\n\nyou call them, dissolve.\n\nWhen I was little I cried\n\nout I! I! I! I want, I want.\n\nOlder, I feel less important,\n\na worker bee in the hive\n\nof history, miles of hard\n\nlabor to make my sweetness.\n\nThe gates are closing\n\nThe light is failing\n\nI kneel before what I love\n\nimploring that it may live.\n\nSo much breaks, wears\n\ndown, fails in us. We must\n\nforgive our broken promises—\n\ntheir sharp shards in our hands.\n\nMarge Piercy, \"Ne’ilah\" from The Crooked Inheritance. Copyright © 2006 by Marge Piercy.
