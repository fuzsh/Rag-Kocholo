        "text": "CIRCLES ON THE WATER Selected Poems. By Marge Piercy. 299 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Cloth. $17.50. Paper. $8.95.\n\nTHIS selection of Marge Piercy's poems is gathered from 20 years of poetry and includes poems from seven books. Just cause for jubilation, since anyone who can survive 20 years of serious poetry writing in America right now deserves a medal of some sort. Also for retrospection: For those of Miss Piercy's age, this book will read like a cross section of their own archeology, for perhaps no other poet of this generation has more consistently identified herself with the political and social movements of her own times. Her earlier involvements were with the civil-rights and antiwar movements of the 60's, which generated in turn the women's-rights and antiwar movements of the 70's. For anyone interested in what's been happening on the cutting edge during the past two decades, she's clearly essential reading.\n\nMiss Piercy has the double vision of the utopian: a view of human possibility - harmony between the sexes, among races and between humankind and nature - that makes the present state of affairs clearly unacceptable by comparison. The huge discrepancy between what is and what could be generates anger, and many of these are angry poems - which, for those who want poetry to be nothing but beautiful, will mean points off. Because her poetry is so deliberately ''political'' - which, for some, means anything not about ghosts and roses - how you feel about it will depend on how you feel about subjects such as male-female relations, abortion, war and poverty. Those who don't like these subjects will use adjectives like ''shrill'' to describe the poems. It's only during certain phases of American intellectual history that divisions are made between ''poetry'' and ''politics,'' however; as Miss Piercy herself points out in her rather disarming introduction, the gap would not have been recognized by ''Sophocles, Virgil, Catullus, Chaucer, Dryden, Wordsworth, Shelley, Arnold, Whitman, Blake, Goethe.''\n\nAs Miss Piercy also points out, her poetry is both ''personal'' - that is, it has the recognizable speaking voice of an individual human being, not a voice issuing from behind a vatic ceremonial mask - and ''public,'' meaning both that it addresses itself to public issues and that it is for a public. With some of these poems, one can almost hear not only the reading voice but the murmurs of response and the spontaneous applause at appropriate rhetorical moments. Taken as a whole -and I recommend you do so only slowly, as this is rich fare - this collection presents the spectacle of an agile and passionate mind rooted firmly in time and place and engaging itself with the central dilemmas of its situation. How, for instance, is a heterosexual feminist to respond to (a) men as they are and (b) more extreme feminists who want her to divest herself of them? How is a socialist to comport herself in a country that provides her with at best a marginal constituency? How is a poet to speak for ''the people'' when she knows that poetry readers come mainly from the middle classes? Sometimes Miss Piercy's is a bewildered and lonely voice, albeit a voice that admits to such quailings. Her position has not been an easy or sheltered one. As she says, ''a strong woman is a woman strongly afraid.''\n\nIf poets could be divided into Prioresses and Wives of Bath, Miss Piercy would very definitely be a Wife of Bath. Low on fastidiousness and high on what Hazlitt called ''gusto,'' earthy, bawdy, interested in the dailiness of life rather than in metaphysics, highly conscious of the power relationships between men and women but seeing herself by no means as a passive victim, she is ready to enter the fray with every weapon at her command. She is, in sum, a celebrant of the body in all its phases, including those that used to be thought of as vulgar. Surprisingly, her poetry is more humorous than her novels, although not all of it is what you'd call funny. The Wife of Bath was sometimes a savage ironist, and so is Miss Piercy. Neither has much interest in being ladylike.\n\nMany of these poems are driven forward by a ferocious energy. Watching Miss Piercy attack a poem -''attack'' in the musical sense - is frequently like watching a very hungry person attack a steak. To hell with the niceties, and if there's no knife handy, use your fingers and teeth. The poem speeds ahead on the roller skates of its own statement, hardly stopping to breathe and accumulating figures of speech like burrs, like ticker tape, like passengers waiting for a train that won't slow down for them, like scars on a boxer, like this sentence, and many times it works, overwhelming the reader with the strength of cumulative suggestion, and sometimes you feel you've ended up in a bowl of alphabet soup. Examples of the former abound; for the latter, try the first two verses of ''Martha as the angel Gabriel,'' in which the subject is compared, within 13 lines, to a tugboat, an engine, a ''bulldog butterfly,'' a koala bear and a swallow. In her own words, since there is very little one can say about Miss Piercy that she hasn't said about herself, ''I lack a light touch./ I step on my own words, / a garden rake in the weeds./ .../ I am earnest into sermons when I should slip away./ I ram on.'' The pattern condensed here - criticism and self-doubt, the poet as clumsy blunderer, followed, however, by an absolute determination not to quit - knits itself into her work, over and over, in many variations.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
