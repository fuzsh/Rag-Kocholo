        "text": "Tales of the cat lady You can ask Marge Piercy about her books, but she'd rather talk about her felines If Marge Piercy has her way, and she often does, people around here will remember her as the cat lady. Whether they also remember Piercy as an influential writer — one whose works are studied at universities all over the country - is something she is willing to let time decide.\n\nWe can assume people who buy her memoir \"Sleeping With Cats,\" which was released a few weeks ago, will primarily be curious about Piercy because of the energy virtually sparking from the pages in her 15 books of poetr 15 more books of fiction. She is experimental, political, feminist. Everything about her writing, whether you agree with her or not, speaks of a woman living in her senses.\n\nThat she has an obsession with cats, and a love of Wellfleet, may seem less interesting than her friendships with other writers like Adrienne Rich or Margaret Atwood. But then, you underestimate Piercy's capacity to lend a unified meaning to fragments. It is what poets do.\n\nIn her memoir, Piercy traces how her development as a woman and a writer does, in fact, rest on \"a spine of cats.\"\n\nAnd in person, her quirky sense of freedom makes you wonder, why not?\n\n\"In the Cape Cod village where I live, there are people who have never read a word I have written and who may not be aware I have written at all, but they know if they have a cat problem, I am the person to call,\" she writes.\n\nA real live cat lady? You bet. Ask a few people in Wellfleet about Piercy. Nine of out of 10 immediately recognize her as \"the lady with all the cats\" or \"that woman my mother calls about cats\" or \"the woman in black who comes to the restaurant and has all those cats.\" Several people looked skeptical when told Piercy is also a writer, a few even becoming belligerent in their disbelief. Only two knew of her international reputation as a poet and fiction writer.\n\nBut this seeming double identity, literary author off the sand bar and cat lady on it, comes to make perfect sense if you just let Piercy talk you into it.\n\nThe rest of the world is what begins to look strange.\n\nWelcome to The JungleThe road to Piercy's house is right out of Proust. The beauty of the winding dirt road make the street's name, Swann's Way, seem perfect, perhaps even to Marcel. Just as the feisty George Eliot might approve of a plaque on the house, giving it the name of her classic, \"Middlemarsh.\"\n\nAside from the literary allusions everywhere, Piercy's home in Wellfleet is striking because of the sprawling gardens that a neighbor calls The Jungle.\n\nAuthorial notes\n\nMarge Piercy on writers, lady-like behavior and other things:\n\nWriters: \"Writers are fairly unimportant in contemporary society. Sports heroes and movie stars and so forth, that's what people talk about. They don't talk much about writers.\"\n\nOuter Cape couples: \"Every woman I know in New York is alone. Beautiful, attractive, intelligent women are alone in New York. And often the same in Boston. Here everybody gets coupled. You want a woman, you want a man, you're 50 years old and overweight, you're going to hook up with somebody. Not all over the Cape, I'm talking about the outer Cape, everybody I know here who wants somebody finds somebody.\"\n\nOn politics: \"Right now, the country is tremendously far to the right. It's pretty frightening in a lot of ways. All fundamentalism and its increasing power is terrifying - Islam, Christianity, Judaism. They all belong together. They all hate everybody. They are not new, but their power is new. Nobody in 1969 would have believed it, that fundamentalism would have such a powerful hold over American politics.\n\n\"They all frighten me. All forms of fundamentalism. They all hate women and they all frighten me.\"\n\nOn self-honesty: \"Writing the memoir, I realized that I haven't been as good a person as I'd thought. I say I'm better now in my most intimate relationships.\"\n\nOn ladies: \"I'm not a lady. That bugs some women. I'm not a middle-class woman. And so sometimes I run into difficulty with women because of that. I have a temper. I say what I think.\n\n\"I'm an edgy person. I make raunchy jokes sometimes when I'm teaching. I say f without thinking about it.\"\n\nThis uninhibited terrain rambles to a gray cedar-shingled house at the top of a hill. It seems a long way to come for a girl from the heart of Detroit, and a quiet choice for a woman who has lived in cities all over the world.\n\n\"So our pasts always seem to lead us directly to our present choices,\" Piercy writes in her memoir. \"We turn and make a pattern of the chaos of our lives so that we belong exactly where we are.\"\n\nPiercy, 65, does seem at one with the setting as she opens the door at Middlemarch. Her hair is a dyed a lush black. She wears a loose black dress, black shoes and colored beads around her neck.\n\nShe shows me to a kitchen table in a room covered with cat toys and plants. Her voice is warm and blunt and funny. Then she rushes off to finish something on the computer.\n\nPuck takes over as host. He is a blue Abbysinian, and he is a flirt. He kisses my faces and climbs up my arm, nestling on my neck.\n\n\"He loves women. He doesn't do this to men who come in,\" Piercy says as she returns.\n\nShe smiles at the cat.\n\nPuck is not among the cats brought to life as part of the \"tight-knit family of two humans and five cats\" described in Piercy's memoir.\n\nLife has made a few changes. Oboe, a korat with a gray coat, died of old age. Not long after that loss, his mother, Dinah also died. Then Max, an orange tabby, was killed last August. Piercy says a coyote ate him - a story she details on her Web site.\n\nPuck arrived after the death of Max. He now seems a live spark in the family lineup of two humans, same, and four cats, somewhat different.\n\nPiercy introduces the other cats as if she were speaking of children. Malkah, sister to Max, is very reclusive with people she does not know. She's hiding upstairs. Then there is Efi, a Siamese, who thinks she is Malkah's daughter.\n\n\"Efi, Sugar, Efi, Sugar,\" Piercy yells upstairs. \"Sugar! Sugar! Sugar Ray! Sugar!\"\n\n\"Sugar Ray is Burmese,\" she says. \"He's a lover. Efi and Malkah are no doubt upstairs clutching each other upstairs. All the cats are very affectionate.\"\n\nOh, yes, there is also Ira Wood, the novelist and publisher of Leapfrog Press, who is Piercy's husband.\n\nA base in WellfleetSince 1971, Piercy has lived in Wellfleet. She got together with Wood five years later, and they married in 1982. He is deeply involved in town politics, and a group of creative types congregates at his press on Commercial Street.\n\nShe has composed most of her books of poetr fiction in Wellfleet. She spends many weekends teaching intensive writing workshops with Wood. And she travels all over the place promoting her work.\n\nJust this month, Piercy will go to Georgia for a conference, then to West Virginia to give a speech and workshop, and then keynote at another conference and reading in Pennsylvania. Then she will give a workshop in New Hampshire, and then go to a poetry festival in Waco, Texas. These are just the events she remembers offhand.\n\nAlways, she says, returning to Wellfleet is a gift.\n\n\"It gives back a lot. It is very healing to be here,\" she says, tossing out a piece of yarn for Puck.\n\nPiercy has certainly known chaos.\n\nHer memoir traces two difficult early marriages - including one that disastrously experimented with open relationships - along with the difficult childhood that made her so determined to find a voice.\n\nShe lives her life as a fight for autonomy on an individual and political level. Wellfleet offers a retreat. She can rise early with Wood, drink coffee, play with the cats. She can have privacy, write on a schedule. She can lend a pattern to chaos.\n\nBut these Wellfleet rituals also enable Piercy to continue to fight, to express and to make change.\n\n\"Writers have the same social responsibility as anyone else in the society,\" she says. \"We use up just as many resources as other people. We owe just as much back. We are no different from any other citizens except that I am able, sometimes, to reach people through writing.\"\n\nPiercy also does fund raising for women who need access to health care, along with co-publishing a newsletter called Roots of Choice. She is very involved with MassNARAL, an abortion-rights lobby group.\n\nThe heat of politicsPiercy says she loves the Cape for the \"water, water, water.\" But she also says the locals here are a passionate group.\n\n\"This is a very hot place politically. There are people who haven't spoken to each other for 20 years because of some political issue in town,\" Piercy says, describing how Wood was a selectman for three years.\n\n\"There's nothing like being a selectmen. People call you up at 5 a.m. and say, 'My road isn't plowed.'\"\n\nAnd where else could she live where people call her for cat advice rather than literary connections?\n\nJust yesterday, Piercy says, a woman from Wellfleet called to ask if she knew anything about a stray, white cat hanging around town. Piercy had a theory.\n\nA poet wanted to know what to do with her old cat, who wasn't eating.\n\nA reporter called, about the memoir, but the first question was about her own cat. Why was it straining in the litter box? Maybe later Piercy even mentioned the new collection of poetry she just finished pulling together. Or maybe she described the research she is doing for a contemporary novel in second draft.\n\nBut is any of this more important than how to treat a cat's urinary problems?\n\nPiercy smiles at Puck.\n\nIn truth, there is no contest between any of these moments. The cats, the writing, the haven in Wellfleet, all these things come together to create an unlikely, fluid and hard-won life.\n\nPiercy says it best in her memoir: \"I have been a busy actor in my life.\""
