        "text": "If they come in the night\n\nLong ago on a night of danger and vigil\n\na friend said, why are you happy?\n\nHe explained (we lay together\n\non a cold hard floor) what prison\n\nmeant because he had done\n\ntime, and I talked of the death\n\nof friends. Why are you happy\n\nthen, he asked, close to\n\nangry.\n\nI said, I like my life. If I\n\nhave to give it back, if they\n\ntake it from me, let me\n\nnot feel I wasted any, let me\n\nnot feel I forgot to love anyone\n\nI meant to love, that I forgot\n\nto give what I held in my hands,\n\nthat I forgot to do some little\n\npiece of the work that wanted\n\nto come through.\n\nSun and moonshine, starshine,\n\nthe muted light off the waters\n\nof the bay at night, the white\n\nlight of the fog stealing in,\n\nthe first spears of morning\n\ntouching a face\n\nI love. We all lose\n\neverything. We lose\n\nourselves. We are lost.\n\nOnly what we manage to do\n\nlasts, what love sculpts from us;\n\nbut what I count, my rubies, my\n\nchildren, are those moments\n\nwide open when I know clearly\n\nwho I am, who you are, what we\n\ndo, a marigold, an oakleaf, a meteor,\n\nwith all my senses hungry and filled\n\nat once like a pitcher with light.\n\nIt has been a hard and heavy few weeks in the headlines, and this poem – found via Abby Rasminsky – made me think of Ukraine and also of my own life. I hope it moves you."
