        "text": "October 2, 2008, 12:22 pm <strong>Tech</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Basic</strong> <strong>Computer</strong> <strong>User</strong> Last week, I wrote an entry on my blog that began like this: “One of <strong>the</strong>se days, I’m going to write a book called, ‘The <strong>Basic</strong>s.’ It’s going to be a compendium of <strong>the</strong> essential tech bits that you just assume everyone knows–but you’re wrong. “(I’ll never <strong>for</strong>get watching a book editor at a publishing house painstakingly drag across a word in a word processor to select it. After 10 minutes of this, I couldn’t stand it. ‘Why don’t you just double-click <strong>the</strong> word?’ She had no clue you could do that!)” Many readers chimed in with o<strong>the</strong>r “basics” that <strong>the</strong>y assumed every computer user knew–but soon discovered that what’s common knowledge isn’t <strong>the</strong> same as universal knowledge. I’m sure <strong>the</strong> basics could fill a book, but here are a few to get you started. All of <strong>the</strong>se are things that certain friends, family or coworkers, over <strong>the</strong> years, did *not* know. Clip, save and pass along to…well, you know who <strong>the</strong>y are. * You can double-click a word to highlight it in any document, e-mail or Web page. * When you get an e-mail message from eBay or your bank, claiming that you have an account problem or a question from a buyer, it’s probably a “phishing scam” intended to trick you into typing your password. Don’t click <strong>the</strong> link in <strong>the</strong> message. If in doubt, go into your browser and type “www.ebay.com” (or whatever) manually. * Nobody, but nobody, is going to give you half of $80 million to help <strong>the</strong>m liberate <strong>the</strong> funds of a deceased millionaire…from Nigeria or anywhere else. * You can hide all windows, revealing only what’s on <strong>the</strong> computer desktop, with one keystroke: hit <strong>the</strong> Windows key and “D” simultaneously in Windows, or press F11 on Macs (on recent Mac laptops, Command+F3; Command is <strong>the</strong> key with <strong>the</strong> cloverleaf logo). That’s great when you want examine or delete something you’ve just downloaded to <strong>the</strong> desktop, <strong>for</strong> example. Press <strong>the</strong> keystroke again to return to what you were doing. * You can enlarge <strong>the</strong> text on any Web page. In Windows, press Ctrl and <strong>the</strong> plus or minus keys (<strong>for</strong> bigger or smaller fonts); on <strong>the</strong> Mac, it’s <strong>the</strong> Command key and plus or minus. * You can also enlarge <strong>the</strong> entire Web page or document by pressing <strong>the</strong> Control key as you turn <strong>the</strong> wheel on top of your mouse.
