PT MBA 2nd Year Trimester VI, NMIMS The billion dollar acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook Subject – Strategy Implementation Submitted by: Neha Kumar – A029 Rashi Kapur – A039 Sonal Rajadhyax – A050 Tarannoom Rehmani – A053 Yuvraj Tandon – A059\n\n2. Facebook www.facebook.com Facebook is an online social networking service founded on February 4, 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League and Stanford University. It gradually added students at various other universities before it opened to high-school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old to become a registered user of the website. In 2012, Facebook was valued at $104 billion, and by January 2014 its market capitalization had risen to over $134 billion. At the end of January 2014, 1.23 billion users were active on the website every month, while on December 31, 2013, 945 million of them were identified by the company as mobile users. History Zuckerberg wrote a program called Facemash on October 28, 2003 while attending Harvard as a sophomore. The site used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person. To accomplish this, Zuckerberg hacked into protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied private dormitory ID images. Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online. The site was quickly forwarded to several campus groups but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped. The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"Thefacebook\" and received its first investment later that month from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. Traffic to Facebook increased steadily after 2009. More people visited Facebook than Google for the week ending March 13, 2010. In March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, a store selling applications that operate via the site. The store is now available to iPhone, Android and mobile web users. Facebook held an initial public offering on May 17 2012, negotiating a share price of $38 apiece. The company was valued at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.\n\n3. Management The ownership percentages of the company, as of 2012, are: Mark Zuckerberg: 28% Accel Partners: 10% Digital Sky Technologies: 10% Dustin Moskovitz: 6% Eduardo Saverin: 5% Sean Parker: 4% Peter Thiel: 3% Greylock Partners: 1 - 2% Meritech Capital Partners: 1 - 2% Microsoft: 1.3% Li Ka-shing: 0.8% Interpublic Group: < 0.5% Social impact Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. The website is the most popular for uploading photos, with 50 billion uploaded cumulatively. With its availability on many mobile devices, Facebook allows users to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It can also unite\n\n4. people with common interests and/or beliefs through groups and other pages, and has been known to reunite lost family members and friends because of the widespread reach of its network. Some argue that Facebook is beneficial to one's social life because they can continuously stay in contact with their friends and relatives, while others say that it can cause increased antisocial tendencies because people are not directly communicating with each other. Vision and Mission In Zuckerberg’s words, “Facebook was started not just to be a company, but to fulfill a vision of connecting the world.” He elaborates the mission statement as “Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. We do this by giving people the power to share whatever they want and be connected to whoever they want, no matter where they are.\" The three pillars outlined for this strategy are: 1. To build the best and most ubiquitous mobile product 2. To build a platform where every new app that is created can be social and enable people to share 3. To build strong monetization and economic engine that will build Facebook into one of the world’s most valuable companies WhatsApp www.whatsapp.com WhatsApp is an early stage technology startup; a publicity-shy 55-person outfit based down the road from Facebook.It offers the WhatsApp Messenger which is a cross-platform instant messaging service for smartphones. In addition to text messaging, users can send each other images, video and audio media messages as well as their location using integrated mapping features. Unlike many companies in Silicon Valley, which drink up as much funding as possible, it was run leanly on funding of about $60m, half as much as the much smaller Snapchat. Unlike most internet companies, it does not take advertising, instead charging a modest subscription fee of $1 a year from users. But quietly, over four years, it grew to almost half the size of Facebook. Lured by the promise of a cheap and fast alternative to text messaging, 450 million users log on every month with a million more joining each month. As of January, 2014, 400 million photos are shared each day, and the messaging system handles more than 10 billion messages each day. The billion dollar Acquisition On February 19, 2014, Facebook Inc. announced it is acquiring WhatsApp Inc. for US$19 billion. Facebook, who was advised by Allen & Co, will pay $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares and $3 billion in restricted stock units to be granted to WhatsApp founders and employees that will\n\n5. vest over four years. The transaction is the largest purchase of a company backed by venture capitalists. The $19billion price tag is definitely aggressive; with many Wall Street analysts downgrading Facebook from ―buy‖ to ―hold‖ soon after the deal was announced. However, as Facebook embarks on a strategy to develop a portfolio of apps to help the company hang on to users adapting to mobile, owning a messaging service, so core to the use of a phone, may not be a bad idea. Facebook’s billion dollar acquisition of messaging service Whatsapp, announced last month, is one of many signs of large businesses’ insatiable appetite for customer data and better reach to a younger audience. One example is the $1.1 billion Yahoo acquisition of Tumblr, which many described as a lot of money for a list of names. An even larger example is Microsoft ’s $8.5 billion purchase of Skype, where they paid a premium way above what they might have to get customer data. The big appeal of this instant-messaging app that works across all smartphones was that it was nearly free - barring the low cost of a basic mobile data plan - unlike SMS text. And it caters to those you care about most: the people in the address book on your phone. WhatsApp did to SMS what Skype did to international phone calls. Its most popular feature today is its handling of groups. That one thing takes it into the realm of social media. WhatsApp groups are the new social groups in many of the countries. The average school kid today - many of whom are by choice not on Facebook - belongs to at least a half-dozen WhatsApp groups. WhatsApp is a clear leader in mobile messaging in countries like India, Brazil, Europe and Latin America. A big reason for this success is the inflexible focus by the two founders of WhatsApp - very much like Google's focus - on speed and simplicity. The company's product philosophy, scribbled on a cheap notepaper by its American co-founders Brian Acton and pinned on Ukrainian co-founder and CEO Jan Koum's desk, says it all: 'No Ads, No Games, No Gimmicks'. Whatsapp has been the top driver for smartphone penetration in emerging markets. Meanwhile Facebook has broadened its scope with the 'Facebook for Every Phone' app. Together; the two add up to a potent army driving up connected smartphone usage. The Strategy behind this Acquisition $19 billion dwarfs almost everything else about the Facebook-WhatsApp deal. And when it comes to money matters- almost everyone seems worried about how Facebook is planning to get returns on this massive investment. Advertisement revenues indeed form the financial bedrock of Facebook. It's no secret that the portion of a brand's Facebook fans who see posts that aren’t supported by ad spend is dropping. Many brands' organic reach via Facebook has been declining and eventually, there may be no space left for brands that haven't paid to promote their posts.\n\n6. WhatsApp owners, on the other hand, have been vocal about being averse to advertisements on their messaging platform. They also seem to be antipathetic to most other existing ways of making money from consumer internet services. There may be no greater testament to the viral nature of WhatsApp than the fact that the company has accomplished all this without investing a penny in marketing. Unlike their smaller competitors, it hasn't spent anything on user acquisition. Yet like the world's greatest brands, it's created a strong emotional connection with consumers. All of WhatsApp's growth has come from happy customers encouraging their friends to try the service. The acquisition thus, though high on strategic value, is becoming difficult to justify in terms of metrics that Facebook is generally valued against. A detailed analysis of the move reveals the following probable reasons behind the acquisition: In 2012, Facebook monthly users increased by more than 17%. In 2013 however, growth of monthly users slowed to 11%. Even more troubling is that the more profitable U.S. and Canadian demographic only had a 3% increase in users in 2013, compared with 5.5% increase in 2012. In October 2013, for the first time, Facebook acknowledged many investors’ concerns — that Facebook is experiencing slowing growth in daily users, especially in the key teen demographic. In 2012, Facebook was the primary social networking site for teenagers but, this year Twitter has overtaken Facebook as the number one social networking website. As teens' log-off from Facebook, people aged 30 and over were logging-in. The older generation began signing up in 2010 as a lot of these users were apparently parents who wanted to spy on their kids. At this point, Facebook was starting to look like a mature blue-chip company that has mostly saturated its potential market share. Facebook had enough cash on hand to ―purchase‖ users and generate growth. It recognized that organic growth is slowing and they need other means to grow revenue. The WhatsApp purchase allows Facebook to acquire a company that already has an impressive number of monthly users, and more importantly, a company that is growing their user base.\n\n7. Facebook, the world's No.1 social network with 1.2 billion users, generates the majority of its revenue by showing ads that target users by age, gender and other traits. Facebook routinely makes use of user information for advertising purposes and can now incorporate the data of WhatsApp users into the user profiling business model. Information analysis is a challenge facing Facebook and other companies that make acquisitions with data, better knowledge of customers’ spending habits and a better reach in mind. But if this area is managed properly, a treasure trove of information can be monetized. Facebook has proved it can monetize the mobile platform, generating more than half of its advertising revenue from its apps, and mine user data to give marketers increasingly accurate targeting. If we carefully translate their mission statement, it conveys to every user that ―your social life over the internet will be conducted via our network‖. WhatsApp, like Instagram, before Zuckerberg bought that too, was muscling in on Facebook’s turf. It is not only massively popular among the younger users abandoning Facebook but a phenomenon in Asia and Africa, where smartphones are getting cheaper but text messaging is still prohibitively expensive. As his company’s growth slows down in the rich world, Zuckerberg can’t afford to see Facebook’s geographical reach Monthly active users (MAUs) per region, Dec. 2013\n\n8. another internet service become the go-to form of communication for the 6 billion or so people that don’t have Facebook. WhatsApp offers levels of engagement even higher than Facebook with more than 70 per cent of WhatsApp users coming back every day and sending almost as many messages as text messages sent in the world. Facebook’s strategy thus would be to grab control of as much of the internet as possible, by eliminating any threat necessary. Facebook has not been successful with its mobile chat apps and therefore, the company has decided to invest in the leader of that sector. The rise of mobile has lived up to the hype and is set to grow further. WhatsApp has been a serious threat to global carriers’ business for the past 3 to 4 years. Companies like Vodafone and Telefonica, with 800 million customers worldwide, were challenged by this tiny startup’s freemium model, which eroded their revenue from text messaging. Over the top messaging services (OTT), where content is delivered via the Internet instead of through mobile networks, resulted in phone carriers losing $33 billion in texting fees. WhatsApp enabled users to move between countries with a single mobile identity. Customers took advantage of carriers’ cheap data plans (especially low in highly competitive mobile markets), and combined them with free, flexible, and easy to use OTT options like WhatsApp to get the most functionality for the lowest cost. The convergence of mobile and social networks has made it difficult for carriers to compete with free OTT services, forcing them to reconsider longstanding business models. Facebook has the product and design expertise to rediscover and reclaim the value carriers have lost in recent years. The company has proven adept at understanding user needs and building products that serve those needs, which is a strong foundation for developing new monetization strategies. This acquisition represents the first of many strategic moves to facilitate the communications habits of users across the globe, rather than simply folding new users into Facebook’s existing businesses and extracting value accordingly. By keeping WhatsApp independent, Facebook aims to dominate global communications— not just social networking. It now appears to be building an ecosystem including photo-sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp that could help it dominate the mobile segment of global communication.\n\n10.

Company Market Cap (millions) Number of Monthly Users (millions) Revenue (millions) Facebook $173,540 1,230 $7,870 LinkedIn $23,530 277 $1,530 Twitter $20,130 243 $665 Pandora $7,320 73 $655 From this table we can see that a higher number of users tend to correlate with higher market cap and revenue. As we have seen, Facebook is having trouble generating new users organically, which helps explain the recent purchase of WhatsApp for $19 billion. WhatsApp has also recently announced that it is adding a voice service as well, putting more pressure on telecom companies. The valuation seems to make sense when looking at its monthly users compared with Twitter and LinkedIn. Facebook is paying less for WhatsApp than the current market cap of LinkedIn and Pandora, yet it has more monthly users than either of them."
