        "text": "Citation preview\n\nAdditional Praise For The New Polymath “Don’t know what a Polymath is? If you learn and become one before your competitors do, you can eat rather than be eaten. Mirchandani’s thoroughly insightful work will become 21st Century Acumen.” —Don Tapscott, Author of 14 books, including (with Anthony Williams) MacroWikinomics: Rebooting Business and the World “The New Polymath brings to life the powerful idea of innovating by bringing the right mix of people together, regardless of function or geography. It’s must reading for anyone leading multi-disciplinary teams or looking to drive innovation.” —Chris Curran, CTO, Diamond Management & Technology Consultants “Every 10 to 15 years the technology industry reinvents itself, taking all the achievements and knowledge from the prior generation and turning them into a platform for new innovation. That regular cycle of rebirth has transformed the way we work, live and play⎯around the world. Mirchandani has done a fabulous job shining a light on examples of people and organizations that take what exists around us and turn it into what is possible. These are the innovators that inspire us.” —Dave Duffield, Co-CEO and Chief Customer Advocate, Workday; Former Chairman and CEO, PeopleSoft, Inc. “Mirchandani has long been not only one of the leading enterprise software analysts, but someone who has always understood the value of innovation and ideas in the marketplace. The New Polymath is both a key discussion on how to innovate and who is innovating but also an appreciation of how we innovate. This isn’t just a useful book, it’s a must read.” —Paul Greenberg, Author of CRM at the Speed of Light “Mirchandani describes a future of possibilities⎯‘fortunate accidents of innovation’⎯enabled by the convergence of technologies with a dose of ideas from ‘left field.’ As the founder of Rural Sourcing, we believed in the untapped potential of our young people in Rural America. The possibilities are limitless when there are no geographic\n\nboundaries to our workforce and we can truly move the work to the worker rather than the worker to the work.” —Kathy Brittain-White, Former EVP and CIO, Cardinal Health; Founder, Rural Sourcing, Inc. “The New Polymath takes a close look at the rate of innovation, not just in the U.S. but around the world, chronicling the rapid evolution of technologies and business. If you are wondering about the future, then find time to read this book.” —Om Malik, Author of Broadbandits: Inside the $750 Billion Telecom Heist & Founder, GigaOM. “Mirchandani has done a great job tying together many of the multidimensional forces which are fueling a new generation of technological innovations aimed at addressing some of our most important business and social challenges.” —Jeffrey M. Kaplan, Managing Director of THINKstrategies and Founder of the SaaS Showplace “Mirchandani produces the ultimate journey through the world of information technology innovation and its impact on today’s globally integrated society. Not many evangelists have lived through IT/business innovation with the unique proximity of Mirchandani⎯his case discussions, interviews and perspectives are a truly enlightening experience to enjoy.” —Phil Fersht, Founder & CEO, Horses for Sources “At Science Debate, we focus the attention of Presidential candidates on the Top 14 Science Questions Facing America. Solving them requires collaboration between technologists, economists, industrialists and governments. The New Polymath profiles numerous examples of this crosssilo innovation.” —Shawn Lawrence Otto, CEO and Cofounder, Science Debate, Inc “As I watch Meg Whitman, my boss at eBay for seven years, pursuing one of the toughest jobs in the country⎯the Governor of California⎯and I am now focused on changing the world of work the same way we changed the world of ecommerce, I am inspired by this book. As you’ll see when we all aim higher, and embrace the power of ‘AND,’ we are all capable of contributing far more than we imagined!” —Maynard Webb, Chairman and CEO, LiveOps; Former COO, eBay\n\nThe New Polymath\n\nThe New Polymath Proﬁles in CompoundTechnology Innovations\n\nVINNIE MIRCHANDANI\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\nCopyright © 2010 by John Wiley & Sons.

Let me tell you how much darker it was eleven years ago when I started salesforce.com. Companies were paying hundreds of thousands to buy enterprise software, and then they were blowing millions to install it. The worst part? It didn’t even work very well. A change was necessary, but the change we were advocating—delivering services through the Internet—wasn’t readily accepted, or even understood. The industry was suffering from “The Innovators Dilemma,” a concept popularly attributed to mature technology companies. There were too many defenders of the status quo (analysts, media, investors) who were financially integrated into the current model and too self-interested to consider the potential for a better future. But innovation was far from dead; it was just emanating from a different place than we were expecting. And, in fact, a revolution was underway. The rapid evolution of the Internet sparked an industrywide transformation. Innovative companies such as Amazon.com, eBay, and Yahoo! changed everything for consumers and changed the business landscape as well. Inspired by the consumer Web, we developed a better way to serve enterprise customers. We knew we could deliver business applications cheaply through a Web site that was easy to use. The skeptics didn’t think much of it (history always repeats; there’s always persecution with some new ideas), but in just a few years we were able to transform the enterprise software industry. The old model of how people bought and built software was disrupted and the packaged services that companies used to buy separately from software vendors, systems integrators, hosting providers, and offshore application management firms were compounded into a single contract and service agreement. The idea—and the rapid adoption of the cloud computing model— addressed the challenge of massive waste in most IT budgets. A recent Galorath study showed that our model led to a five-year cost savings of xvii\n\nxviii\n\nForeword\n\n78 percent and a development and time savings of 75 percent. Recycledcountertop maker Vetrazzo built a custom ERP suite at half the cost associated with a traditional software implementation; Japan Post Network created a custom app for 40,000 users in only two months; and HaagenDazs Shoppe built a franchise management app with no capital expense. We can look back and see that the last decade was the end of the dark ages and, in fact, the start of a period of enlightenment. Now, in this new decade, the Renaissance continues—and matures. There has been massive innovation in mobile and social technologies that, when brought to the enterprise, will create more value for users, customers, and vendors by an order of magnitude over what we saw in the last wave. And while information technology continues to massively evolve, newer sectors of biotechnology and green technology have also been growing exponentially. This sets us up for the next revolution. The best companies—from established corporations to pioneering start-ups—are creating incredible value by succeeding in a new way: amalgamating distinct strands of technology (infotech, cleantech, healthtech, nanotech, biotech) to create compound new products, services, and processes that address the big and small problems in this world. These are what Mirchandani calls the New Polymaths (Greek for the Renaissance men and women who excelled at multiple disciplines) and nothing captures this powerful, emerging pattern in the marketplace like this book. I am honored that salesforce.com which amalgamates the consumer Web, social, and mobile technologies—as well as philanthropy to effect change— is profiled as a New Polymath. I am also humbled. These pages are filled with incredible examples of passionate entrepreneurs, established leaders, and multinational companies innovatively leveraging technology to tackle big problems, “grand challenges,” related to health, hunger, and natural disasters—and, of course, information technology. You’ll meet individuals like Elizabeth Horn, the mother of a child with autism, who has created ChARMtracker, a Web-based treatment management software to get children, parents, and the medical community the important cause/effect data they need to identify biomarkers that may help guide treatments in the future. You’ll be inspired by the “refugees” from information technology, like Ray Lane, who fled Oracle and now, as a VC, is investing in a new generation of cleantech companies addressing various energy and environmental challenges. You’ll travel the halls of General Electric’s Global Research Center and see how it brought together multiple technologies to respond to problems in healthtech with access to clean water supply. The book shows us that the future can be brighter because people and companies are doing more by leveraging various technologies to make it so.\n\nForeword\n\nxix\n\nIn what we can expect from someone as knowledgeable, prescient, and committed to industry disruption as Mirchandani, the most pivotal trends a company needs to know are illuminated. Through his R-E-N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E framework (each letter is a chapter that discusses a building block for the New Polymath), we learn about 11 key ideas: Residence; Exotics; Networks (Bluetooth to broadband); Arsonists; Interfaces; Sustainability; Singularity; Analytics; Networks (social); Cloud Computing; and Ethics. This is the first book to reveal why these changes are important and how to take full advantage of them for your business. Mirchandani not only explores thought-provoking topics, but he walks us through compelling case studies and high-impact examples, such as how the Schumacher Group, through its aggressive deployment of cloud computing and MAXroam, will make the entire world one area code with no mobile roaming charges. We also learn where innovation is coming from (and where it’s not), especially in telecom, where we see the biggest breakthroughs from Apple and Skype and Google and Ericsson, and less from the telcos themselves—an important theme, which we see mirrored in other industries (e.g., IT, publishing, music). One of the best parts about this book is its courage to take a stand. Mirchandani is never afraid of saying what is required of us (he was known as a “growling tiger” at Gartner) and he closes his RENAISSANCE framework with a focus on ethics with conviction and compassion. This deftly harkens back to the historical polymath like Plato and Socrates, who were also philosophers—and is an idea that is timeless. Ethics must not be an afterthought, but woven into the culture of innovation. We live in a time of great change and with that comes great responsibility. In today’s business world, Milton Friedman’s famous mantra “the business of business is business” is dated. The business of business is not only business. The business of business is to do good while doing well. There is a way to combine creativity, ingenuity, and business acumen to address social issues—from substandard health care or schools in developing nations to problems with homelessness or illiteracy. We combined philanthropy into our business model. Our 1-1-1 model (1 percent employees’ time; 1 percent equity; 1 percent product donation) has allowed us to donate more than $19 million in grants, deliver our service to over 8,000 nonprofits for no charge, and give more than 178,000 hours of community service. This charge also changed our company. It established us as a meaningful place to work and made us more committed to the success of our employees and our customers. And it was easy. Being a polymath isn’t that difficult—and it always yields multidimensional rewards. The New Polymath—a book about how to unlock innovation—is told through the perspective of a true innovation seeker who is dedicated to\n\nxx\n\nForeword\n\nimplementing productive and disruptive change. And what better guide to walk us through examples of a modern-day polymath than a true polymath himself? Mirchandani’s varied career as a technology advisor, outsourcing executive, industry analyst, entrepreneur, and implementation consultant makes him one of the industry’s most provocative thought leaders. Most important, his fresh insights and wise counsel prepares us for how to best navigate, compete, and flourish in this Renaissance. The well-researched examples in this book will inspire you. But the people who are going to change the world aren’t only in this book. They are reading this book. Join them—as entrepreneurs, as executives, as leaders. You are in a position to make a contribution to people’s lives in a meaningful way. No large enterprise was ever built by addressing only a small market. And the world’s problems are not a small market. We are now in a time of extraordinary opportunity. People always ask me: What’s in store for the future? Where is technology going? Where is philanthropy going? Predicting the future is simple. The future is whatever we imagine. What’s ahead of us is whatever we innovate. What do you see in the future? I see less disease. I see less poverty. I see new sources of energy, amazing advances in healthtech, and a planet on which the next generation can still breathe. I see hope because I know there’s a generation of talented people out there combining a renaissance of new technologies to help us make pivotal changes. You have the power to create or join organizations that address society’s issues. You do not have to decide between making a social contribution or building a successful company or career. You can do many things. You can be a polymath. As Mirchandani says, “It’s time for AND not OR.” Read on; be inspired. I’m looking forward to enjoying the future that we create. Aloha, MARC BENIOFF Chairman and CEO of salesforce.com\n\nPreface\n\nM\n\nick Jones of the band Foreigner says a fan who stood in the rain for hours to get a glimpse of the band inspired their hit “Juke Box Hero.” Impressed with his dedication, the band rewarded him with a backstage tour and, of course, the song. Substitute innovation for rock concert, and that describes this fan. Over the last five years, I have cataloged close to 2,000 technologies, companies, and projects on my innovation blog. They cover more than 40 technology categories, from cloud computing to nanotechnology.1 The innovation blog is my antidote from the day job, where I don’t see enough innovation but plenty of greed and waste. For the last 15 years, at the research firm Gartner and in my own businesses since, I have helped clients navigate technology scenarios. I also write another blog on the economics of technology.2 Based on a back-of-napkin calculation, my fingerprints are on $10 billion of technology contracts. Don’t be too impressed—as a race, we spend more than $3 trillion a year on information technology. Much of it, unfortunately, is fat. When I first started at Gartner, if I saved a client 10 to 15 percent, I would feel we had justified our fees. In the last couple of years, I have renegotiated some contract renewals at 75 percent of the incumbent price. It is waste that makes the much-maligned $600 military commode look like chump change. Printer ink for $5,000-plus a gallon— yes, more than 1,000 times what you pay for gasoline. Twenty-minute calls to software help desks, which amortize to over $10,000 each. Even more painful is when I see clients take savings that I and others deliver and apply them to compliance and control projects, not toward innovation. You can see why I don’t mind standing in the rain for hours to catch glimpses of innovation. Not all my innovation posts are business-related—several are about innovations that apply more to life and play. One was about the mostplanned Space Shuttle mission, which fortunately never flew. Mission xxi\n\nxxii\n\nPreface\n\nSTS-400 required two shuttles simultaneously at launch pads, ready to go, in May 2009 in case Atlantis needed rescuing. Atlantis was on a severely delayed trip to the Hubble Space Telescope, which unlike the International Space Station could not provide it shelter for weeks. The planning called for multiple rescue spacewalks and crash-landing sequences. Another post was about technology used in the Haitian earthquake relief and how it benefited from software written to coordinate Asian tsunami relief in 2004 and sensitive microphones and heat-seeking sensors developed after the 9/11 rescue experience. One of my inspirations to start the blog was a visit to the Marriott Marquis in New York a few years ago. On previous stays, I had noticed long— sometimes seemed like 30 minutes long—waits for the elevator. You often had to also change elevators at the “hub”—the eighth-floor lobby level. How do you add new or bigger elevators in a hotel without causing months of chaos? Particularly in a hotel that is bang in the middle of bustling Times Square—and that is a tourist attraction by itself. Innovatively, the hotel found a way out without adding any new elevators. A relatively simple solution of kiosks helped optimize the use of elevators. Users punch their destination floors in the kiosks, and algorithms group the users and direct them to specific elevators. Software and some electronics on the elevators had obviated months of likely chaos. Nice, but hardly a complex problem compared to the some of the grand challenges the National Academy of Engineering has laid out, including ensuring plenty of clean water around the world and reverse engineering the brain. Fortunately, as the database of posts grew year after year, I started to notice two patterns. I was seeing ever-more complex products and services that blended a variety of technologies. An example was General Electric’s plans for the Net Zero Home (as in zero annual energy costs), which plans to bring together solar, wind, next-gen battery, smart grid interface technology, and energy management software to efficient appliances, water heaters, and other devices at home. Or the BP CTO group, which effortlessly weaves sensory networks, predictive analytics, and other technologies to bring innovation to a variety of refineries, exploration sites, and other aspects of its global reach. I was also seeing refugees from information technology increasingly move into cleantech and healthtech. Ray Lane, ex Oracle, and Bill Joy, ex Sun, are key leaders at Kleiner Perkins, which has made 50-plus investments in cleantech. Little in Kleiner’s past success as a venture capitalist in information technology (including blockbuster investments in Netscape, Amazon, eBay, and others) prepared it for a world of methane and selenium. Yet here the company is reinventing itself utilizing new sciences. Similarly, Shai Agassi left the German software giant SAP to found Better\n\nPreface\n\nxxiii\n\nPlace, focused on services that electric cars increasingly call for. Likewise, Google, Microsoft, and others are increasingly offering products in the healthtech market. Those are modern-day polymaths, I thought. Polymath, as in Greek for someone who excels in many disciplines, like Isaac Newton, the English physicist, astronomer, and philosopher, and Hypatia of Alexandria, who was a mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, and teacher. We call them Renaissance men and women these days. They exemplify an AND not OR mind-set. Put many of them together and we have a fighting chance at solving some of our grand (and day-to-day) challenges. I have had an interest, going back to 1993, in polymaths. How can I be so precise? That was the year a few Americans like me qualified for a green passport, instead of the usual blue-colored ones that had become standard in 1976. No, there was nothing special about us, and it did not recognize us as members of the Green Party. Celebrating 200 years of U.S. Consular Service, the Passport Office decided to issue green Benjamin Franklin commemorative passports that year. Besides making me an owner of a collector’s item, the green passport reacquainted me with Franklin. The last page in that passport described him as someone with “distinguished parallel careers as author, journalist, scientist, inventor, political philosopher and statesman.” That led me to read more about Franklin and to research other polymaths, including the ultimate polymath, Leonardo da Vinci, who was an artist, sculptor, architect, and so much more. Look up the term “Renaissance man” in an encyclopedia and Leonardo should be on prominent display. So now I am fascinated when I meet someone like Andrea Olivieri, who is direttore di crociera in the Costa family of cruise ships. His job is to play master of ceremonies for the ship’s varied entertainment. He introduces them in rapid-fire Italian, Spanish, German, French, and English. Then my wife pointed out that he is himself the star of many an event on the ship. He leads a lecture with PowerPoint slides and video clips that touch on the Fibonacci sequence, quantum physics, fractal geometry, and lots more. He leads another session that elaborates on his ship’s technology—its azipod, its thrusters, and its satellite communications. His job requires him to be charming and alert at all hours. But he is a chemical engineer by training and he has an MBA from the University of Southern California. He leads star-gazers at night on the ship’s deck and points to “Taurus, the Bull defending the Seven Sisters from Orion the Hunter.” He keeps switching between Taurus and il Toro, Italian for “bull,” during that session. I later found out he also speaks Portuguese and is an avid sailor. He would have set Christopher Columbus straight. Leonardo would be proud of the modern-day Renaissance man from his country, hailing as he does from the city of Genoa.\n\nxxiv\n\nPreface\n\nInvoking the Spirit of the Renaissance This book asks, What would Leonardo do today in the midst of our technology bounty? How wide would his vision of AND not OR be today? Which disciplines would he choose to focus on: Nanotechnology? Biochemistry? Would he work on architecture of next-generation green cities? Prepare for the Mars shot? Or would he be told to quit dabbling and be good at one thing—like plastics, à la Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate ? Given that the grand challenges have grown exponentially in the five centuries since Leonardo lived, the new polymath can no longer be just one person but a collection of many. How would Leonardo leverage other Leonardos and Olivieris? Of course, the Renaissance was not just about Leonardo. It was also about Michelangelo and tens of other polymaths. This book brings out the diversity of today’s Renaissance. There are hundreds of innovator companies and their products profiled, including large companies, such as Best Buy and Starbucks. There are plenty of smaller companies, such as Schumacher Group with its aggressive deployment of cloud computing. I profile start-ups, such as Altimeter Group and also profile individuals, such as Karin Morton and Dennis Howlett, and technologies that are allowing them to be extremely productive and connected with the world for a pittance. The book covers many aspects of infotech, but it also touches on healthtech and cleantech. There are plenty of examples from manufacturing and financial services industries. But we also profile education companies like DeVry and dairies run by farmers like Tony McCormack. There are several examples from the larger countries, such as Germany, Japan, and China. In addition, we also profile examples from Estonia, Rwanda, and the United Arab Emirates, and innovative cities like San Francisco. There are examples from larger technology vendors like Microsoft, IBM, and HP, but many more from start-ups and mid-caps. I cover customer, human resource, finance, and other business processes, not just research and development. CIOs and vendor executives, venture capitalists, and industry analysts; various journalists and bloggers are cited. The spirit of Leonardo and Franklin—AND not OR—pervades this book. The bulk of the book is organized around eight polymath enterprises and 11 chapters around the acronym R-E-N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E. Each letter explores a certain group of technologies and the problems they are solving—or, in some cases, new issues and challenges they are raising. So, the first S covers Sustainability and cleantech components. The second S is for Singularity and covers healthtech. Each of those chapters profiles 5, 10, or 15 of the innovators just described, most speaking in the first person. GE and BP CTO cut across a wide range of the R-E-N-A-I-S-S-A-\n\nPreface\n\nxxv\n\nN-C-E building blocks. The other six polymaths—Cognizant, Plantronics, Hambrecht, Kleiner Perkins cleantech, the National Hurricane Center, and salesforce.com are associated with specific R-E-N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E building blocks—so salesforce.com is associated with the chapter covering C for cloud computing. Polygons, as we may remember from high school geometry, can be three-sided triangles or five-sided pentagons or eight-sided octagons. They can be convex or concave. Their sides need not be equal. In other words, they can be virtually millions of shapes. The polymaths I profile in this book represent similar diversity. So comparing number of products, locations, and the like, if salesforce. com is a triangle, the units of GE profiled would be an eight-sided octagon or a 10-sided decagon. If we profiled the whole global organization, it could be a 20-sided icosagon. Given the breadth of challenges China is tackling at the same time, that country would be a 50-sided pentacontagon. The “more-sided” polymaths are trying to solve the really big, hairy problems. The “fewer-sided” ones are a bit less ambitious, but they are helping us run our enterprises and lives much better. We need all kinds. Given their diversity, there is no single “cookbook” for innovation, but in Chapter 22 we do summarize ten common themes.\n\nFlow of the Book The book is organized in three parts: 䊏\n\n䊏\n\n䊏\n\nPart I sets the stage for the challenges of today and opportunities for polymaths of today and profiles GE, a new polymath. Part II is organized around an acronym—R-E-N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E—each letter of which discusses a building block for the new polymath to leverage. I, for example, stands for interfaces. This part also profiles another six polymaths associated with one of the specific building blocks: salesforce.com with cloud computing. Part III is focused on how helping you groom your own new polymath. It profiles the BP CTO group, its tools and processes, and its vast ecosystem of innovation ideas. We also bring together common threads from the seven other polymath profiles and the 11 building blocks in Part II. Let’s go through each individually.\n\nxxvi\n\nPreface\n\nPart I: Sprezzatura: The Art of Making the Complex Look Easy This part is made up of two setup chapters and one polymath profile: Chapter 1, “The New Polymath: In an Age of ‘Wicked Problems’ and Technology Abundance.” This chapter provides a historical perspective of polymaths like Leonardo and contrasts them to modern ones like Apple and its CEO, Steve Jobs. But the Renaissance was so called because there were plenty of Leonardos. Similarly, in our New Renaissance, even though most of attention seems to go to innovation in mobile and social technologies, there is plenty of complex industrial innovation going on. Chapter 2, “Modern-Day Dark Ages: So Much Stagnation.” Renaissance, by definition is “rebirth.” The European Renaissance was an escape from the Black Death—the plague that decimated Europe—and the Dark Ages, a time of little intellectual progress. We describe the modern dark ages—massive waste in infotech, the rancor around sustainability and cleantech, and the wildly inconsistent availability of healthtech around the globe. Chapter 3, “Polymath Profile #1: General Electric.” Here we present the first of our eight polymath profiles and explore four aspects of innovation at GE at its Global Research Center: its “Magic Factory,” at corporate IT, how it brought together multiple technologies in its Net Zero Home concept and with an agile—a rapid deployment—project in the highly regulated environment at GE Healthcare. It showcases how GE is rising to help respond to some of the challenges we discussed in Chapter 2.\n\nPart II: The R-E-N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E Framework: Building Blocks for the New Polymath This part is the bulk of the book with 11 chapters depicting the R-E-N-AI-S-S-A-N-C-E framework—each of which discusses a building block for the new polymath to leverage. C, for example, stands for cloud computing. This part also interweaves another six polymaths associated with one of the specific building blocks—for example, Plantronics with Networks: Chapter 4, “Residence: Better Technologically Equipped Than the Office.” This chapter explores consumerization of technology and how in industry after industry customers are becoming technologically more savvy than employees. And the economics in the consumer world are dramatically lower even at their bite-size\n\nPreface\n\nxxvii\n\nprocurement units. The consumerization trend has been accelerating for the last decade, yet in many enterprises, the prime response has been a sexier graphical user interface around their business applications to make them more alluring to younger staff. Chapter 5, “Exotics: Innovation from Left Field.” “Not invented here” used to be a defense mechanism. When former communist countries have some of the best telecom infrastructure in the world, something has really changed. When public utilities are hotbeds of innovation, you know the changes are tectonic. There are few barriers to entry—other than closed minds—and innovation is coming from all kinds of new geographies, verticals, and business processes. The next polymath profile for Cognizant is associated with this chapter. Chapter 6, “Polymath Profile #2: Cognizant.” Francisco D’Souza, the CEO of Cognizant, seeks out “innovation from left field.” Over the last few years, he has grown 50 technology service delivery centers in India, Argentina, Hungary, the Philippines, China, and elsewhere. That’s something far more mature companies have not done as successfully. Chapter 7, “Networks: Bluetooth to Broadband.” The radio spectrum is sliced thinly into land mobile, land mobile satellite, maritime mobile, maritime mobile satellite, and many more. These divisions reflect the proliferation of gadgets, the number of phone numbers and sign-on IDs and passwords we possess. Most telecommunications innovation is not coming from telcos; it is coming from the likes of Apple, Skype, Google and Ericsson. That in itself is a sea change. The polymath profile for Plantronics is associated with this chapter. Chapter 8, “Polymath Profile #3: Plantronics.” Neil Armstrong used a Plantronics headset when he spoke his famous words from the moon in 1969. Since then, Plantronics has navigated call centers spawned by toll-free calling, the growth of small and home offices, and now mobile communications. Its devices are polymaths that “unify” communications: They converge landline, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), and mobile calls with audio streaming and software telephony while bringing a keen sense of consumer tastes in their design. Chapter 9, “Arsonists (and Other Disruptors).” In technology, we have long benefited from Moore’s Law—where the next generation of technology disrupts the previous one. Well, at least we like to think so. In fact, the majority of technology spend is in software, services, and telecom, which has little to do with transistor economies. So we need external disruptors like Rimini Street, Zoho, and Cartridge\n\nxxviii\n\nPreface\n\nWorld, and HP disrupting Cisco in networking, or SAP disrupting Oracle in analytical tools. These rebels are helping innovate economics in technology. The profile on Bill Hambrecht that follows is associated with this chapter. Chapter 10, “Polymath Profile #4: W. R. Hambrecht.” Bill Hambrecht had a successful investment bank that took public a number of disruptive technology vendors. Instead of retiring after that successful three-decade career, he launched a new firm to disrupt the established Wall Street method of pricing initial public offerings. Recently he has launched the United Football League in a market long dominated by the NFL. Chapter 11, “Interfaces: For All Our Senses.” How we interact with computers is undergoing a radical shift. The keyboard and the mouse are still around, but auto companies, in particular, are innovating with new approaches involving haptics, voice, and location. There are all kinds of exotic bar codes and scanners, even brain– machine interfaces. As consumer and work generational differences become more pronounced, organizations will need to leverage an even wider range of interfaces. Chapter 12, “Sustainability: Delivering to Both the Green and Gold Agendas.” Sustainability is about reducing demand for fossil fuels and increasing supplies of renewable fuels, such as solar and wind. It is also about local, organic produce, and other lifestyle changes people are making. In this chapter, we explore how individuals, enterprises, cities, and countries—often with competing agendas— actually make technology one of the least complex areas to navigate. The profile in Chapter 13 is associated with this chapter. Chapter 13, “Polymath Profile #5: Kleiner Perkins Cleantech.” Kleiner, the storied venture capitalist—which made whopping investments in infotech, from Netscape to Amazon to Google—has moved into cleantech. It has a portfolio of 50-plus companies doing work with smart grids, next-generation batteries, and wind technology. To do so, it has had to learn, polymath style, new sciences and disciplines far removed from its historical roots. Chapter 14, “Singularity: Human–Machine Convergence.” There is a convergence coming. Human beings are gradually leveraging personalized medicine, replacement body parts, and other technological advances to live better and become much more productive. In many enterprises, over 75 percent of messaging today is between nonhumans—it is called the “Internet of things.” Sensors, motes, devices, servers, and robots are doing so much that humans did before. Smart enterprises are leveraging this convergence of humans and things.\n\nPreface\n\nxxix\n\nChapter 15, “Analytics: Spreadsheets, Search, and Semantics.” If you think you are drowning in data, this chapter will depress you. Think of a quadrant with internal/external as the x-axis and structured/ unstructured as the y-axis. So far, most enterprises primarily have tackled the internal/structured quadrant. That’s why most business forecasts failed so miserably in the last economic meltdown. Opportunities to better visualize that growing mountain of data and the need to store it more efficiently lead to innovation in deduplication and optimized tiering of storage devices. The profile in Chapter 16 is associated with this chapter. Chapter 16, “Polymath Profile #6: National Hurricane Center.” The NHC mines a wide range of data sources: satellites, dropsondes, “Hurricane Hunters” and water based sensors. That’s not data you can Google or get from Bloomberg. It then crunches multiple models on supercomputers and presents them in a wide range of reports and graphs. Of course, what matters is that it reduces, year after year, the “false positives” that cause unnecessary and expensive evacuations. That is why we present the NHC as the polymath when it comes to analytics. Chapter 17, “Networks Again: Communities, Crowds, Contracts, and Collaboration.” The networks this time are about people or, as Cisco calls it, it’s about the human network. Love it or ban it, you have to admire the massive scale at Facebook. More than 400 million members and a billion chat messages each day. At peak times, it serves more than 1.2 million photos every second. It is teaching us about communities. An even more interesting development concerns the use of crowds as a talent source. Of course, employees and contractors continue to be the major talent source for companies. Technology is helping manage that talent in a number of recruiting, training, and administrative areas. No wonder the term “human resources management” is considered so 1990s. It is now about talent management in its various forms. Chapter 18, “Clouds: Technology-as-a-Service.” Cloud computing is an exciting new paradigm where you can buy applications, development platforms, and IT infrastructure “by the drink.” This market is spawning a new generation of vendors, tools, and metrics. It is also forcing vendors to become polymaths and understand many new disciplines around operations, data centers, networks, and more. The salesforce.com profile in the next chapter is associated with this chapter. Chapter 19, “Polymath Profile #7: salesforce.com.” salesforce.com is a cloud computing pioneer that combines services that enterprises used to buy separately from software vendors, systems integrators,\n\nxxx\n\nPreface\n\nhosting providers, and offshore application management firms. Marc Benioff, the colorful leader of the company, has launched a new religion with its own set of passionate supporters and detractors. Chapter 20, “Ethics: In an Age of Cyberwar and Cloning.” Look back at historical polymaths and you see many were also philosophers. This chapter, different from the preceding ones, is not so much about innovative companies or products but includes perspectives from several industry observers on the ethical issues being spawned by technology. These include issues around privacy, the biofuel/ food trade-off, “God powers” around genetics and nanotechnology, tech/life balance, government surveillance, and censorship. Ethics cannot be an afterthought as we innovate.\n\nPart III: Grooming Your Own New Polymath This part has one polymath profile and two other chapters that focus on tools to help develop and nurture your own polymath enterprise. Chapter 21, “Polymath Profile #8: BP CTO.” See the tools and vast innovation sources this small group leverages as it rolls out sensory networks, predictive analytics, 3-D virtualization—years ahead of mainstream market adoption—to the vast BP energy family across the globe. Chapter 22, “Moon Shots for Budding Polymaths.” This chapter weaves together learning from the eight polymath profiles and the hundreds of other innovators whose voices were presented in the R-E-N-A-I-S-S-A-N-C-E chapters. It does so in the form of conferences that develop challenges to the enterprise that wants to become a polymath. We bring to life 10 polymaths from history to host this event and help guide the discussions. “Epilogue.” Markets continue to evolve, technologies continue to converge, and new disruptive players continue to emerge. This chapter presents a Zen Buddhist concept that refers to wide openness when studying a subject. It is a good approach to finding innovation even in the midst of constant change and turmoil.\n\nWhat Got Left Out? What about space exploration? What about new converging markets like bioinformatics? Why not open source in the chapter on arsonists? What about new contracting and intellectual property issues in the world of\n\nPreface\n\nxxxi\n\nmassively shared, multitenancy clouds? What about peers and competitors of companies profiled in this book—are they sitting still, or innovating on their own? These are all fair questions. As I wrote the book, I felt like Francis Ford Coppola editing The Godfather. Plenty was originally left behind in the director’s cut. In fact, the studio made him add almost 50 minutes back to the movie when it was released. In my case, some of those “50 minutes” can be found in online materials at www.thenewpolymath.com and on my two blogs. These are living, breathing documents—compared to a printed book that can be only a snapshot. Of course, I would welcome reader comments and conversations. Regarding ethics in Chapter 20, for example, I would be delighted to hear that some of you had a brown-bag lunch where you discussed (or argued) with your peers or friends the various sides of each scenario. Your attorneys probably will have guidelines on how and where you can discuss ethical topics around your own products, but the key is to get comfortable discussing the tough, often emotional, topics. The goal of the book, of course, is not to make you uncomfortable. We know the ratio of “oh no” to “aha” is off kilter. This book’s goal is to help you reverse that ratio in big and small innovation opportunities. Join me in the rain—fellow Juke Box Heroes!\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI\n\nprofile hundreds of innovators in this book. Many more helped coordinate those conversations. To each, a heartfelt thank-you. In this section, I want to acknowledge those who went out of their way to be generous, such as Mark Mastrianni at GE. I cold-called him. He could have ignored me. He’s not naive either. He told me he did his homework on me, and then called me back. On weekends and nights he shared time around his busy schedule and made other introductions in the GE family. When I told him I owed him a nice dinner, he said, “Now you know I am not a big fan of SG&A in technology. Don’t go increasing yours. Besides, GE policy would not let me.” Wow! Many people opened up their Rolodexes and said you should also talk to so and so. The winner in this category is Zach Nelson. Not only did he spend time talking about NetSuite (in Chapter 18), he also introduced me to his wife, Elizabeth Horn, who discusses ChARM (in Chapter 14). Autism is not easy on parents, so I particularly appreciated their openness. Zach also introduced me to the legendary Bill Hambrecht, profiled in Chapter 10, and to Steve Yeffa of Cartridge World, a customer of his, profiled in Chapter 9. Ray Lane at Kleiner offered me introductions to several more of his cleantech portfolio companies than I have profiled. Carol Comeaux allowed me to pick from a wide portfolio of BP CTO group innovation projects. Karen Auby kept showcasing product after product at Plantronics. Carlye Adler offered episode after episode of Marc Benioff’s exhilarating decade at salesforce.com and along with Jane Hynes details of Benioff ’s own experience writing a bestselling book. Balakrishna Narasimhan (Nara) and others at Appirio showcased their own operations and their projects at Avon and Starbucks, among others. Troy Angrignon, who shared his personal guiding principles (in Chapter 20), was full of other introductions and ideas. Peggy Taylor at B Cubed Ventures offered several introductions beyond FICO I profile in Chapter 15. My entire list of blogger colleagues xxxiii\n\nxxxiv\n\nAcknowledgments\n\noffered input, and you hear many of their voices in the chapters that follow. Judith Rothrock of JRocket Marketing introduced me to Agresso, which is profiled in Chapter 9, and whose Swedish customer, Offentliga Dokument, is profiled in Chapter 11 and to Corefino, profiled in Chapter 17. She also inspired me to bring the 10 polymaths from history back to life in Chapter 22. She had invited me to her annual Grape Escape Analyst Event, which was held at the historic Old State House in Boston. There was President John Adams, circa 1809, in his traditional costume mingling with an audience two centuries later talking about his peer founding fathers and his uncomfortable time as the first U.S. ambassador to England. Paul Greenberg, author of a very successful book on CRM and with a brutal travel schedule, somehow found hours to coach me. Jeffrey Word, David Axson, Howard Dresner, Nenshad Bardoliwalla, Jon Reed, and Phil Simon—each a seasoned author—usually responded within minutes to my queries about the mysteries of the publishing process. Jim Spath, Charlotte Otter, Kimberly Baker, Gretchen Lindquist, Dennis Howlett, Sean Mirchandani and Debbie Brown unselfishly proofed and critiqued various drafts. May every author have such a supportive ecosystem. Everyone I interviewed has shared personal details or proprietary business nuances some would say they were stupid to share. Innovation, after all, brings competitive advantage. The reality is that they are big believers in sharing and learning from others. Most of them spent hours patiently explaining things to me. As far as competitive advantage: Trust me, they have moved on to newer innovations. Brian Sommer, my cofounder in a prior start-up, and Charlie Bess of EDS, now part of HP, deserve credit for inspiring some of my thinking. At various points I had discussed coauthoring a book with each. The style we had discussed would have been more in our voices, less that of the polymaths and innovators I ended up profiling. In the future, perhaps I can still collaborate with them—as I mentioned, there is plenty more to cover. Brian does contribute a perspective in Chapter 20 as he asks: “Where are the 10 Commandments for Technology?” How do you express enough gratitude to those who review books? It takes passion for technology and a love of reading to take time out of busy schedules and pore through hours of proofs. So many executives, successful authors and industry observers (listed on the back cover and in the front pages) took time out to review this book—it is testament to their commitment to helping technology make work, life, and play better. Of course, I owe a debt of gratitude to Benioff—for the foreword. He is a colorful, passionate technology leader who you will read about in Chapter 19—but what I admire is how he treats his people and how responsive he is even to casual acquaintances. While he is clearly a tech-\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nxxxv\n\nnology pioneer, he is also a philanthropy pioneer. His 1-1-1 model—1 percent of equity to a foundation, 1 percent of the company’s product to nonprofits, and 1 percent of employee time to community service is a generous and innovative way to help society. Finally, I want to thank John DeRemigis, Emilie Herman, and Andy Wheeler at John Wiley & Sons, Inc.—of course, for their editing and marketing efforts on the book, but just as important, for continuing to encourage me to stick with the title. I loved it to start with but got increasingly nervous as I presented at various conferences and polled audiences. Very few had heard the term “polymath.” Here we are with new polymaths throughout the book, and many of them from the past, like Thomas Jefferson and Shen Kuo, brought back to life. We need all the help we can get with the grand and not-so-grand challenges we all face today.\n\nPrologue The Field of Polymath Dreams\n\nI\n\nt had been a glorious few days. This Tuscan evening promised to be the icing on the cake. The rows of long tables had been laid out in a field with a stunning view of rolling mustard fields and grapevines. In the distance was the walled medieval town of Sam Gimignano, whose castles and towers had been home for many of the guests. Crisp linen, Italian lace, and Murano crystal decorated the tables. Christine Virsunen, who arranged all the conference logistics, had lived up to her promise with the meals: Little of the food had seen the inside of a fridge. As she had planned the meals, for a moment she had wished she could have had her Bay-area suppliers, Riverdog Farms and Driscoll’s, do the catering. Then she chided herself—how can you go wrong with the local pecorino cheese, the Panzanella bread salad, and the bistecca alla fiorentina? Of course, she had panicked when they had arrived. Not just her, the whole conference was thrown into a tizzy. There had been no voice announcing they might come. They had shown up from the past, nonetheless like Shoeless Jackson and the others in the movie. Karin Morton tried to text “OMG” to her mother on her iPod Touch and forgot there was no Wi-Fi in that conference room. After years of fattening her Brazilian telephone carriers, she had weaned herself off voice or data plans on any carrier. She did fine with Skype wherever she could find Wi-Fi. So she did the next best thing without Wi-Fi—just kept whispering “wow!” to herself as they walked in one by one. They—as in Michelangelo and Plato. And Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, Isaac Newton, Socrates, Hypatia of Alexandria, Shen Kuo, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and Benjamin Franklin. Yes, 10 polymaths from history. They said they had heard about this gathering of modern-day technology polymaths and decided to partake. xxxvii\n\nxxxviii\n\nPrologue: The Field of Polymath Dreams\n\nSo the conference agenda had been redone so each of these historic giants could lead sessions and impart their wisdom. Frankly, the polymaths from the past seemed more fascinated with today’s technologies. Leonardo insisted on sitting next to the GE Aircraft Engines team—and hearing about how aviation has evolved since his vision of Flying Machines. Shen Kuo acknowledged he was mightily impressed—and terrified—by the pace of change in modern China. Newton was fascinated to hear about the Hubble Space Telescope. There were awkward moments. Google had to rush to the conference a still-experimental contraption that brought its Voice and Translate features together so the Masters could communicate with the group. Leonardo and Michelangelo still hated each other after six centuries. Someone asked Ben Franklin to reconcile his views on chastity with his many mistresses. Everyone worried if the Italian Polizia would come knocking for these visa-less visitors. It was mostly magical, though. The group had chuckled at how different the old and new “earth is flat” arguments are and yet how the arguers continue to be so passionate. There were back-to-the-future conversations. Would Google Maps have changed the course of the spread of the Black Plague and European history? How would GPS have affected Columbus’s travels and world history? Then Karin started whispering to herself again. Michelangelo had stood up and called everyone to attention. He toasted the uomo universale, the Italian term for polymath. He invoked the zeitgeist his Renaissance-era contemporary Leon Battista Alberti summarized as: “A man can do all things if he but wills them.”\n\nPART I\n\nSprezzatura The Art of Making the Complex Look Easy\n\nS\n\nprezzatura is a term from the Italian Renaissance that would translate to what we would today call “being cool”—a certain nonchalance even when tackling complex assignments. It is a good way to describe this leadin part, which consists of three chapters: 䊏\n\n䊏\n\n䊏\n\nChapter 1 defines the new polymath and explains how many of them are coming together to solve many of our “grand challenges.” Chapter 2 lays out the modern-day version of the Dark Ages. In spite of huge budgets for infotech, cleantech, and healthtech, there is plenty of “nothingness” and stagnation. Chapter 3 looks at our first polymath profile—General Electric—and showcases how its research and development and information technology units are tackling some of the challenges in infotech, cleantech, and healthtech.\n\n1\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nThe New Polymath: In an Age of “Wicked Problems” and Technology Abundance\n\nT\n\nhe dying curator at the Louvre assumes the position of the Vitruvian Man. An ultraviolet light reveals an anagram scribbled in invisible ink next to him, pointing to the Mona Lisa. The bulletproof glass case around the Mona Lisa shows another puzzle, which decodes to Madonna of the Rocks. Behind that painting is a key, a clue to a whole new set of adventures, including speculation about who really sat with Jesus at The Last Supper. Contrived? Blasphemous? Whatever you may think of Dan Brown’s book The Da Vinci Code1 or Tom Hanks’s acting in the movie, they introduced the work of Leonardo da Vinci to a new set of fans. The book and movie, however, only scratched the surface of Leonardo’s body of work. Martin Kemp has spent a lifetime studying Leonardo. He helped design the parachute based on a drawing of Leonardo’s that was used in a successful 3,000-foot jump. He collaborated on a contraption that mimicked Leonardo’s flying machine. More substantively, the Oxford University professor has written several books on Leonardo’s works. He also organized “Universal Leonardo,” a European tour of the artist’s work. Long after the exhibits ended, a Web site keeps their visuals alive, showing Leonardo’s portfolio: 25 paintings, 22 manuscripts, 10 inventions, and 50 drawings.2 Even that doesn’t cover Leonardo’s work as an architect for bridges and even entire cities, his talent as a musician especially on the lyre, the fables he wrote for children, his unfinished sculptures of horses, his work on botany and on human anatomy. President John F. Kennedy said, when honoring Nobel Prize winners at a White House dinner in 1962, “I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered 3\n\n4\n\nSprezzatura\n\ntogether in the White House—with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.”3 Kennedy was describing a polymath—which is Greek for someone of learning in many fields of study. In modern times, we call polymaths Renaissance men and women. Over the centuries, around the world, we have seen polymaths such as Cicero, the Roman orator, philosopher, statesman, and lawyer; Hypatia of Alexandria, a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher; Akbar “the Great,” the Mughal Indian emperor gifted in many skills; Isaac Newton, the English physicist, astronomer, and philosopher; and Mary Somerville, from Scotland, who wrote on a wide range of subjects, including astronomy, geology, and physics. We met some of these polymaths in the prologue and will meet others in Chapter 22. Even among these giants, Leonardo set a high-water mark. Mention Renaissance man, and most people will immediately think of Leonardo.\n\nThe Modern-Day Technology Polymath Fast-forward six centuries and travel six thousand miles west from the small town of Cupertino in the heel of the boot of Italy, Leonardo’s birth country, to a modern-day Leonardo, who is holding court in the namesake town in California. Steve Jobs is explaining one major reason for the iPhone’s success— Apple’s ability to integrate hardware and software engineering: “We realized that almost all—maybe all—of future consumer electronics, the primary technology was going to be software. And we were pretty good at software. . . . None of the handset manufacturers really are strong in software.”4 That is a modern polymath at work—integrating multiple modern disciplines. An AND versus an OR mind-set. Tear down an iPhone 3GS and it shows Bluetooth AND Wi-Fi AND GPS transceivers AND lenses AND chips AND circuits AND batteries—a marvel of miniaturization. It functions as a Web access device, a camera, a music player, a navigation device, a compass, a voice recorder, a modem, and more—and, of course, it is also a phone. That is a polymath as devices go. Historically, the telecommunications device market has been fragmented. Nokia, successful in many parts of the world, is a small player in the U.S. market. Japan, which is the gadget exporter to the world, spectacularly failed with its mobile devices outside its shores. Then along came Apple and launched the 3G version of the iPhone in 22 countries in 2008, with another 50-plus countries following over the next few months. Among the carriers it coordinated the rollout with were\n\nThe New Polymath: In an Age of “Wicked Problems” and Technology Abundance\n\n5\n\nVimpelCom in Russia, three companies in Hong Kong, Etisalat in Dubai, and Telia in Sweden. Most readers would not call them household names. That is a Renaissance enterprise as global citizenship goes. If there is one negative in the iPhone’s huge success, it concerns problems with AT&T’s cellular network—the company with which Apple signed an exclusive agreement for the U.S. market. Can you imagine if Apple had also taken on the task of integrating the network piece? The idea isn’t farfetched for a company that had tackled music with iTunes and is now poised to focus on TV shows and publishing with the iPad and for an executive who also made movies at Pixar. Okay, so we have unrealistic expectations. And why not? Like Leonardo, Steve Jobs and Apple have raised the bar for modern polymaths. Yes, but . . . Apple is impressive, but surely music and mobile apps pale when we look at the complex challenges the world faces. So it is good to see what companies like BASF are doing to help with the world’s food supply chain. BASF brands itself “The Chemical Company.” That moniker is too narrow when you look at the technologies it deploys in its quest for better strains of rice. Its Metanomics unit in Berlin, Germany, studies the changes that occur when an individual gene in a plant’s genetic code is modified. A few hundred miles away, the Ghent, Belgium greenhouse of its CropDesign unit, uses robots, conveyor belts, radio-frequency identification chips, high-resolution cameras, and software algorithms to find the best rice seedlings. The metabolite research from Berlin and the phenotype research from Ghent are combined into “bio-informatics” knowledge base, one of the largest gene-function databases in the world. What’s impressive is the wide range of infotech and biotech components it leverages. That is the New Polymath—comfortable with a wide range of technologies. Comfortable, of course, means deeply specialized. Modern cars now run on tens of millions of lines of code of software. As showcased in Chapter 11, you could argue the auto industry is miles ahead of the average software vendor when it comes to innovation in user interfaces. Modern polymaths don’t just dabble in multiple technologies; they often lead the specialists in many of them. The emergence of such polymaths is timely. We face many “grand challenges.”\n\nOur “Grand Challenges” John Kao, a former Harvard Business School professor and entrepreneur, says we face “wicked problems” of global concern—around climate, disease, and financial meltdowns. Kao founded the Institute of Large Scale\n\n6\n\nSprezzatura\n\nInnovation, where he convenes innovation-savvy officials from around the world so they can explore models for collaboration and stewardship.5 Others call these hairy issues the world’s “grand challenges.” The tradition of grand challenges dates back to David Hilbert, the mathematician. Preparing for a conference in 1900, he asked a colleague what a compelling presentation topic would be and was recommended the following: “Most alluring would be the attempt to look into the future and compile a list of problems on which mathematicians should test themselves during the coming century.”6 The end result was Hilbert’s list of 23 (he dropped 1 from an original list of 24 in his final paper) problems that continue to challenge us, even into the twenty-first century. Hilbert’s challenges have led to many lists of grand challenges over the last few years across many disciplines. One of the better-known lists is one developed by the National Academy of Engineering in 2008, which challenges: 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏 䊏\n\nMake solar energy economical Provide energy from fusion Develop carbon sequestration methods Manage the nitrogen cycle Provide access to clean water Restore and improve urban infrastructure Advance health informatics Engineer better medicines Reverse-engineer the brain Prevent nuclear terror Secure cyberspace Enhance virtual reality Advance personalized learning Engineer the tools of scientific discovery7\n\nIn 2000, the United Nations (UN) adopted eight millennium development goals to be achieved by 2015. They are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\n\nEradicate extreme poverty and hunger Achieve universal primary education Promote gender equality and empower women Reduce child mortality Improve maternal health Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases Ensure environmental sustainability Develop a Global Partnership for Development8\n\nThe New Polymath: In an Age of “Wicked Problems” and Technology Abundance\n\n7\n\nWhile cynics will say the UN missed “boil oceans,” it is tracking these goals along 21 quantifiable targets that are measured by 60 indicators. There is a lot to be accomplished in the five years left—which should motivate plenty of innovation. Compared to those challenges, a list of seven IT challenges that Gartner, the research firm, issued in 2008 sounds downright mundane:9 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.\n\nNever having to manually recharge devices Improve parallel programming Develop nontactile, natural computing interfaces Improve automated speech translation Develop persistent and reliable long-term storage Increase programmer productivity 100-fold Improve financial models for IT investing\n\n“Challenge” has entered the lexicon of many innovation shops. In the BP CTO profile in Chapter 21, you hear the challenges their business unit customers invite them to help solve. In turn, they throw out challenges to their “seeker” network. Why just look at the big, hairy UN challenges? Frank Scavo, president of Computer Economics, an IT research and advisory firm that provides metrics for IT management, also sees “grand challenges” in small to midsize enterprises. Scavo elaborates: These growing organizations need plenty of IT support. And today’s small organization is often multinational from day one. So, Quickbooks used to be fine for many companies till they crossed a certain revenue threshold. Often that’s not true anymore. They are also dealing with more tech-savvy consumers than a small company did a few years ago. But with limited IT budgets, they have to seek resources that can wear many hats.\n\nAn Extinct Species in Our Complex World? As Yogi Berra quipped, “The future ain’t what it used to be.” Ray Kurzweil, famous for his vision of singularity (described more in Chapter 14), is a bit more precise: “We won’t experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today’s rate).”10 With that explosion in knowledge, we survive by specializing. Sometimes organizations encourage it to mitigate risk. Scavo again: “I have seen several instances where small and midsize businesses are effectively held hostage by one or two key IT staff members, who are the\n\n8\n\nSprezzatura\n\nonly ones who understand critical systems. So, they need to take advantage of local IT services firms that can supplement internal staff with less than full-time resources.” Polymaths are a dying species as Edward Carr, the editorial director of the Economist, wrote in his essay “The Last Days of the Polymath”: “Isaiah Berlin once divided thinkers into two types. Foxes, he wrote, know many things; whereas hedgehogs know one big thing. The foxes used to roam free across the hills. Today the hedgehogs rule.”11 Carr calls the hedgehogs “monomaths.” He may be right to talk about the end of individuals as polymaths. But he does not explore a new generation of technology polymaths, such as Nathan Myhrvold and Bill Joy, who make Leonardo look like a mental midget. Carr certainly does not factor in the new polymath enterprise where many “monomaths” with a variety of technical disciplines and technologies create an Apple or a Google or a BASF.\n\nLeonardo 2.0 “Penguins, it turns out, have amazing sphincter muscles. And they are able to project like there is no tomorrow,” says Nathan Myhrvold in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria.12 Nathan is also said to be fascinated with fossilized dinosaur vomit. Don’t let that put you off. Myhrvold was CTO at Microsoft before he left to start Intellectual Ventures (IV). The company is less than a decade old, but it already has thousands of patents in a wide range of interests. Along with Bill Gates, his former boss at Microsoft, one of its entities filed for patents that would slow hurricanes by pumping in the paths of the storms cold, deep-ocean water.13 IV’s Web site shows less exotic areas of interest, such as “computer software and hardware, user interface design,” but also shows ambitious ones, including “advanced medical procedures, digital imaging, nanotechnology, nuclear energy and advanced particle physics.”14 The organization reflects Myhrvold’s personal diversity. He has a doctorate in theoretical and mathematical physics with a master’s degree in mathematical economics from Princeton University. He also has a master’s degree in geophysics and space physics plus a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from UCLA.15 He started college when he was just 14 and worked as a postdoctoral fellow under the famous Stephen Hawking. Malcolm Gladwell, of The Tipping Point fame, describes the kind of talent Myhrvold has access to at IV: “You know how musicians will say, ‘My teacher was So-and-So, and his teacher was So-and-So,’ right back\n\nThe New Polymath: In an Age of “Wicked Problems” and Technology Abundance\n\n9\n\nto Beethoven? So Lowell Wood was the great protégé of Edward Teller. He was at Lawrence Livermore. He was the technical director of Star Wars (the defense initiative).”16 Recently, Myhrvold stirred up another radical idea: Pump sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to accomplish global cooling, as happens when active volcanoes explode. He thinks that most current global warming blame on carbon is bunk and has told the authors of SuperFreakonomics the current anticarbon thinking hurts billions of poor people around the world.17 Less controversially, Myhrvold: 䊏\n\n䊏\n\n䊏\n\n䊏 䊏 䊏\n\n䊏\n\n䊏\n\nIs an accomplished cook, winning several world barbecue championships. He is also an assistant chef at a French restaurant. Is working on a book on molecular gastronomy, which explores physical and chemical changes to food in the cooking process. Has been involved in major archeological finds (several T. Rex skeletons). Has studied penguins and their “projectiles.” Is a prize-winning wildlife photographer. Has built a section of Babbage’s Difference Engine #2, the predecessor of the modern computer. Has funded Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) projects, such as the Alien Telescope Array. Has explored active volcanoes—he got the sulfur dioxide ideas above by studying weather impact after volcanoes blow.\n\nYes, he is definitely a polymath for our times. Unlike what Carr would predict, Myhrvold is not being targeted by “monomaths.” He has been accused of being a “patent troll.”18 Large incumbent companies with patents of their own are worried that either IV or a company it transfers patents to may come after them. Of course, those who accuse Myhrvold conveniently stay quiet about how they themselves take advantage of an overwhelmed U.S. Patent Office and a system where patent litigation is often more lucrative than revenues from patents: “Our patent system for most innovations has become patently absurd,” wrote a Wall Street Journal editorial.19 Indeed, by itself the patent gridlock is a grand challenge, which the U.S. Congress has tried multiple times to reform over the last decade. Bill Joy, like Myhrvold, has roots in software. In fact, he is quite a legend in that sector. His fingerprints are all over the UNIX operating system, the Java language, and the Sun SPARC processor, earning him the moniker “Edison of the Internet” from Fortune magazine.20 His personal interests are more mainstream—no culinary or dinosaur razzle-dazzle: an\n\n10\n\nSprezzatura\n\nart gallery in San Francisco, on the board of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, and work with some architects. Joy, by the way, is no fan of Microsoft—the run-ins between Sun, the company he cofounded with Scott McNealy and others, and Microsoft were legendary. One of his gentle jabs included: “I’ve often wondered why they [Microsoft] can’t, for once, do something new. I mean really, really new?” Not surprisingly, even after leaving Sun, Joy continues on the other bank of the river from Myhrvold. For the last several years, as we show in Chapter 13, he has been helping the firm of Kleiner Perkins, a more traditional venture capitalist than IV’s model, make cleantech investments. He is in the business of reducing our dependence on carbon-based energy. Unlike Myhrvold, who is having to defend his patent strategies, Joy spent a couple of years defending an article he wrote in Wired magazine in 2000 that raised significant ethical issues regarding nanotechnology, genetics, and robotics. We discuss those issues in Chapter 20. Two modern polymaths, very different in style and approach—but we should all be grateful because both are helping us look at the wicked problems we face. They embody AND not OR. But just as important, they are building a version of the new polymath: the IV and Kleiner talent ecosystem and product portfolio. Even more assuring, while they may not be as visible as Jobs, Joy, or Myhrvold, there are plenty more big thinkers around building other new polymath enterprises, leveraging a breathtaking variety of technical disciplines and technologies.\n\nDon’t Forget Michelangelo, Raphael, and . . . Baldesar Castiglione’s Book of the Courtier is considered one of the most comprehensive perspectives of life during the Renaissance in Europe. Born into the nobility in 1478, Castiglione held court in Urbino, considered one of the most refined cities in Italy, and later he was the papal nuncio to Spain.21 The book describes conversations between members of a court over the course of four evenings about what makes a “perfect gentlemen” (and to a lesser extent, a perfect lady). The breadth of expectations is wide: In volleying, in running bulls … he should be outstanding among the Spaniards. Painting, since it is a worthy and beneficial art The man who does not enjoy music can be sure there is no harmony in his soul. He should have knowledge of Greek as well as Latin.\n\nThe New Polymath: In an Age of “Wicked Problems” and Technology Abundance\n\n11\n\nWell-equipped as to horses, weapons and dress … Swim, jump, run, cast the stone … Attractive manners, wisdom, speech, gestures … It sounds like Castiglione’s characters were describing someone as gifted as Leonardo. Amazingly, the group discusses Leonardo only once in those evenings, and then only as a painter. Why? Because there were so many other multidisciplinary people to talk about, such as Michelangelo and Raphael. If the characters in Castiglione’s book were having their conversation today and discussing technology innovation, they would surely mention Apple. And Google. And Kleiner. And IV. They would, however, only mention them once or twice as they stepped back and looked at the emerging innovation at companies like CME and Redbeacon. In September 2009, CME—the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is the world’s largest derivatives exchange—was honored at an InformationWeek 500 awards ceremony in southern California. The magazine described why: “The trading volume grew more than 300% a year. In that same time, the average time for a quote or order to come into and back from CME’s data center was collapsed from 180 milliseconds to less than 6 … and cut maintenance and capital expenses 90%.”22 A few hundred miles to the north and a few hours apart, Mike Arrington was handing a $50,000 check to Redbeacon at his TechCrunch50 event. Founded by ex-Google employees, Redbeacon, a consumer shopping site, does not just return local business listings, leaving users to sort through dozens of entries. Instead, it manages the quote process and allows users to book appointments with qualified suppliers.23 Arrington was an attorney at Wilson Sonsini, a Silicon Valley law firm that has helped countless start-ups get founded, funded, and go public. He is now one of the most influential players in the technology start-up world, with product reviews and commentary on his TechCrunch site. Redbeacon was one of 50 finalists that got to present for six minutes—yes, just six minutes—to five judges, including Arrington and an audience of two thousand. That day, 499 other established companies were honored in the InformationWeek 500. More than 1,000 start-ups competed to show at the TechCrunch event. Many more chose not to be or were not considered for either honor. The speed of processing at the CME and the rate at which start-ups are forming is breathtaking, but neither can compete with what is happening in China.\n\n12\n\nSprezzatura\n\nThe general thinking was that once China showed off its progress at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, things would slow down in the country. The country, however, is redefining scope and time to market over and over again. A bullet-train system will cover 16,000 miles at an investment of $300 billion by 2020. The nation will have 244 airports by then—almost 100 more than it had in 2006. In the West, we take years to get approvals just to extend existing airports. In Chapter 12, on sustainability, we talk more about China’s cleantech investments and ambitions. A National Geographic article titled “China’s Instant Cities” shows the hurry the whole country is in: In 23 minutes, they designed an office, a hallway, and three living rooms for factory managers. On the top floor, the workers’ dormitories required another 14 minutes. All told, they had mapped out a 21,500-square-foot (2,000 square meters) factory, from bottom to top, in one hour and four minutes. Boss Gao handed the scrap of paper to the contractor. The man asked when they wanted the estimate. “How about this afternoon?” The contractor looked at his watch. It was 3:48 p.m. “I can’t do it that fast!” “Well, then tell me early in the morning.” 24 You can argue about China’s autocratic approach to solutions, its ethics, and even the quality of its construction, but few could disagree that it is redefining time to market. Yes, Castiglione’s characters would only mention Apple or Kleiner once or twice, just like they barely touched on Leonardo. They would also talk about “faux” innovators.\n\n“Spray Painters” in the New Renaissance The CIO is presenting about the exciting opportunity for his public utility with the coming trend of “smart grids” and other industry innovations. Unfortunately, his back-office system was designed for manual meter reading every 30 to 60 days. In the new world of smart meters, communications with customers would become much more real time. The meters would facilitate consumers selling surplus energy from their solar panels and wind turbines back to the grid, as is already common in Germany. That is a good reason to upgrade your customer systems. The CIO has done the numbers, and the cost of custom modifications to his old “house” would have been expensive on its own. The packaged solution from SAP is a less-risky decision.\n\nThe New Polymath: In an Age of “Wicked Problems” and Technology Abundance\n\n13\n\nHe then presents a slide that draws attention. It shows Accenture would need 40,000 person-days to implement the system. Some back-of-napkin numbers show the project would cost $150 million to $200 million over the next few years, considering what the company would pay SAP, Accenture, its infrastructure provider, and its internal staff. The expensive back-office investment would likely smother the benefits offered by the smart grid. Over the last couple of decades, companies around the world have spent more than $2 trillion on similarly well-intentioned SAP projects that would not meet most definitions of “innovation.” Can you imagine what China could deliver for $2 trillion as it redefines time and economics in its rush to develop bullet trains and wind farms while we have been investing it in back-office systems? We are not just picking on SAP and Accenture—later in the book, we show ways in which both are also innovating. Or consider the opportunistic behavior around sustainability. Terrachoice has been surveying brands for several years and concluded, in its 2009 report, that 98 percent of “green” products are committing at least one of what it calls its “Seven Sins of Greenwashing.”25 Those sins range from false claims to irrelevant statements on product labels. It defines “greenwashing” as “the act of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental benefits of a product or service.” Let us note that there is innovation and then there is innovation by association—“spray-painted” innovation. Fortunately, as we describe next, there is also plenty of unheralded innovation going on.\n\nLess Visible Signs of Our New Renaissance Most people have heard of the iPhone. Many of us have seen a DIAD but probably cannot recall what it is. It is the device that helps UPS drivers in their brown trucks deliver 22 million packages a day during the peak holiday season. It was introduced back in 1990, way before the iPhone. Now in its fourth generation, it does many of the things an iPhone does. And its battery lasts much longer than the iPhone’s.26 A delivery information acquisition device (DIAD) allows the driver to scan the package bar code, collect the receiver’s signature electronically, type in the receiver’s last name, and push a single key to complete the transaction via the mobile network or by Wi-Fi—no need to activate a cell phone or return to the vehicle. It supports a Bluetooth wireless personal area network and an infrared port to communicate with peripheral devices and customer PCs/printers. It also has a GPS chip to allow UPS to track the whereabouts of its trucks.\n\n14\n\nSprezzatura\n\nEvery UPS driver logs into a central ODS (On-Demand Services) system first thing in the morning. This allows dispatchers to access the driver via the DIAD throughout the day via text messages. Virtually all drivers start their day with a list of predefined customer pickup locations. ODS allows the addition of a one-time pickup to a driver’s work list on the fly, depending on which driver is nearest. The 100,000 DIADs are only a small part of the technology landscape at UPS, which uses 15 mainframes, more than 11,000 servers, and 150,000 workstations. UPS says its package tracking is done by the world’s largest DB2 site (the IBM database software). It is the largest user of mobile minutes in the world. UPS.com, available in 32 languages, handles 35 million tracking requests on a peak day during holiday season. Its technology helps optimize truck routes and minimize left turns. It is investing in a variety of fuel-efficient trucks and techniques, such as continuous descent approach, to glide its planes for fuel efficiency and noise reduction. Yet most of us do not marvel when Mr. Brown—the UPS delivery person—stops by. We similarly do not realize how broadly talented are colleagues like Gretchen Lindquist and Edgar Moore. Lindquist works in IT security for a large multinational in Houston, Texas. She is also a soprano soloist at her local church. Her husband, Moore, is professor of music at a local college and a conductor of a men’s chorus. Lindquist is also his recording engineer. Their music has made her a linguist of sorts: “Having learned Latin by rote repetition at Mass as a small child before I could even read, learning to sing works in Latin such as the Verdi Requiem was not too difficult. However, learning to sing in new-to-me languages such as Catalan, Polish, and Russian was a matter of a lot of listening and repetition, and that was how I did it.” Lindquist’s master’s thesis was focused on a Renaissance-era bishop, Marco Girolamo Vida, and his work De Dignitatae Republicae (“On the dignity of the republic”), which is about the timeless question of the value of civic life and government. The thesis contrasted the bishop’s views on statecraft with those of Machiavelli and Erasmus. The couple spends as much time on the road as they can. Lindquist says: “We both enjoy combining cultural/artistic activities and active recreation when we travel. I have taken a pair of inline skates along and gone skating in various U.S. and international cities including New York, Denver, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, London, Aberdeen, Dubai, and Singapore.” There is more to Lindquist, including “gardening, three dogs, animal activism and environmentalism, and healthy gourmet cooking.” In his spare\n\nThe New Polymath: In an Age of “Wicked Problems” and Technology Abundance\n\n15\n\ntime, Moore rebuilds classic British cars and is a Hollywood movie buff, and he almost became a baseball umpire. Their varied talents, travels, and experiences probably do not show in her company’s or his college’s skills database. But they should. Put several Lindquists and Moores together, and we can create polymaths of innovative enterprises. Or how about the Amish? Hold on now. The Amish, with their straw hats and horse buggies, did not adopt two of the most impactful technologies of the twentieth century: electricity and the automobile. Why would they care about the technology of the twenty-first? “The Amish are not Luddites—though their view of technology veers sharply from the mainstream,” says Dr. Donald Kraybill, senior fellow at the Young Center for Anabaptist & Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. He is leader of a research project with a working title of “From the Buggy to the Byte: How the Amish Tame Technology.”27 He continues: Amish engineers are expert at stripping electric motors from shop equipment and replacing them with air or hydraulic ones powered by diesel engines, which are common in change-minded settlements. This socalled Amish electricity [air and hydraulic power] is widely used to operate state-of-the-art machinery—table saws, sanders, grinders, drill presses, and large metal presses. In some Amish settlements, battery-powered word processors are accepted, but not computers. One Old Order inventor, assisted by nonAmish technicians, developed a classic word processor, essentially a basic computer with a Microsoft operating system. With a small monitor, it supports word processing and spreadsheet software, but it has been neutered to disable the use of email, Internet access, video games, and other interactive media. An Amish shop developed an alternator that mounts on the axle of a buggy and uses the wheel rotation to recharge the battery which powers lights and signals. And get this—the manufacturing is contracted to a factory in China. It certainly sounds like we can learn from the Amish as we look for sustainable technologies. The UPS DIAD, Lindquist and Moore, the Amish—no, they will never be written about in the same vein as Leonardo or Apple, but they are also signs of our New Renaissance.\n\n16\n\nSprezzatura\n\nRecap For the most part today, most of us seem to specialize: We are monomaths in a world of exploding knowledge. Of course, there are exceptions, such as Jobs and Joy. And, importantly, well-designed enterprises are taking individual monomaths, leveraging a wide array of technologies and becoming the new polymaths. And as during the European Renaissance, there are plenty of polymaths. Though a lot of attention these days seems to go to innovation in mobile and social technologies, plenty of complex, hairy “industrial innovation” is also going on. This is encouraging because we face a daunting series of challenges at the global, enterprise, and individual level. We need polymaths to help with those grand challenges and our more routine ones.\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nModern-Day Dark Ages: So Much Stagnation\n\nR\n\nenaissance, or rebirth, by definition follows something terminal. The European Renaissance followed its Dark Ages. While today’s historians use more politically correct terms and don’t call them Dark Ages, most agree there were decades, if not centuries, of “nothingness.” Life went on, but there was little enlightenment. The establishment—the clergy and the nobility—seemed okay with the stagnation. Similarly, there is so much “nothingness” today. In IT, it’s about lack of nutrition and much of the spending is wasted. In sustainability and cleantech, it’s about lack of agreement—there’s rancor in spite of so many global concerns. In health care, it’s about lack of availability—much of the world does not have access to advances, some even after decades of progress. It’s fine to throw out grand challenges like reverse-engineering the brain, but in many ways, would it not be easier to just bring light to our Dark Ages? Let’s explain—starting with information technology.\n\n“Empty Calories” in Infotech The research firm Gartner expected global IT and telecom spending to be $3.3 trillion in 2010. Robert Mahowald, a director at IDC, another IT research firm that collects market data by sector—software, telecom, and so on—says there is some cross-selling between sectors, but, in total, it is safe to say that the global spend is in excess of $3 trillion a year. Neither IDC nor Gartner, however, tabulates internal corporate IT costs: salaries, benefits, and internal burdened charges. If they did, it would reveal that most enterprises spend 80 percent to 90 percent of their IT and telecom budget with outside vendors. That is a dangerously high dependence on a supply chain. Many enterprises don’t 17\n\n18\n\nSprezzatura\n\neven realize this because only a fraction shows up in the budget of the CIO. Research and development (R&D) technology is charged to product development, telecom to call centers and business intelligence to the corporate planning group. Mobile charges come via expense reports and Amazon Web Services via corporate cards and are charged to even more budgets. Even in automobile and aerospace, which have much more mature supply chain management, companies such as Ford and Boeing get around 70 percent of components from suppliers. In those industries, supplier consolidation and tiering makes sense because Ford and Boeing are dominant customers and can dictate design standards and justifiable economics. In technology, by contrast, buyers have little leverage—even companies as big as Ford and Boeing make up less than 0.5 percent of an IBM’s or Oracle’s revenue. The top 25 global technology vendors, such as HP and AT&T, now make up more than 50 percent of the volume of the IT amount spent externally. The top 25 global technology buyers (dominated by large banks and government entities), however, barely make up 5 percent of the total spend.1 As a result, buyers have little control over vendor product design and innovation strategy when they individually control so little of a vendor’s revenue. With a few exceptions, such as Apple, Intel, and Google, the bigger technology vendors have not been innovating much. The three biggest chunks of external technology spend are in telecommunications, outsourcing, and software. Telecommunications vendors invest in capital expenditures (capex), outsourcing vendors in training their people, and software vendors in tweaking older versions. Not much is spent on breakthrough R&D or real innovation. Would you believe Verizon does not use the word “research” anywhere in its 10-K? Why should it invest in R&D when it can just leverage all the cool stuff that Apple and Google are delivering? Even those companies spend only 10 percent or so of revenues on R&D. Outsourcing vendors—by the way, over half of IBM’s revenues are from outsourcing—typically spend less than 2 percent of revenues on R&D, and much of that is on “solution centers,” which are more about marketing than research. They, in turn, conveniently leverage innovation coming out of salesforce.com and Dell. Software vendors invest somewhat more in R&D than do telecom and outsourcing vendors—but parse that spend and you find much of it is going toward version 7, 8, or 12 of their products, some first introduced 10 to 20 years ago. So it is not really impactful innovation. Also, many of the software R&D dollars go toward porting products to new hardware platforms and devices or in “localization” to newer countries. Here’s the irony: Some technology vendors spend more on internal IT than they do on R&D. The attitude toward real innovation is that “It’s somebody else’s job.” When pushed, the stock answer from most technology vendors is that too much R&D spending offers only diminishing returns.\n\nModern-Day Dark Ages: So Much Stagnation\n\n19\n\nIn contrast, they do not believe they get diminishing returns from their sales and general and administrative (SG&A) cos"
