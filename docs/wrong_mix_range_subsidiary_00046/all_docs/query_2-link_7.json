DATA MINING SOLUTIONS  Definition - Data Mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science that discovers patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems.  Philosophy – The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.  Areas Covered:  Virtual HTS and HCS Data  Predictive Toxicology  Life sciences and health related issues trending on social media  FDA datasets  Micro-biomes  Chemo-genomics  Predicting and preventing diseases through gene analysis  Both big an small molecules  Deliverable: Converting raw data into actionable information after detecting patterns and trends, and applying a number of verified algorithms.  Benefits: Improves prediction of early stage drug safety testing. Data mining (as opposed to conventional statistical analysis) can uncover patterns and relationships in large data volumes that are completely unexpected. Patterns can be used to extrapolate and predict. Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n8. DATA MINING PROCESS & ALGORIGHTMS Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n9. DATA MINING CASE STUDIES @ Roche: Used DM techniques to set up models for the diagnostic of diabetes high risk group to analyze existing samples sets (including Diabetes II patients and healthy subjects), to identify the factors (age, sex, race, height, weight, BMI value, ADA value) that may cause Diabetes II, and predict the probability of the subjects developing Diabetes II in the next 7 and half years, in order to take preventive measures a traditional statistical methods are not as accurate as DM methods. @ GSK: Data Mining Human Gut Microbiota for therapeutic targets. This could lead to a systems-level understanding of the global physiology of the host–microbiota superorganism in health and disease. Such knowledge will provide a platform for the identification and development of new therapeutic strategies for chronic diseases possibly involving microbial as well as human-host targets that improve upon existing probiotics, prebiotics or antibiotics used text analytics to analyze public discussion boards on BabyCenter.com and WhattoExpect.com, to learn what factors motivate parents to either go ahead or delay vaccinating their children for diseases like measles and mumps. Data mining was used to identify unrecognized drug interaction (pravastatin and paroxetine) that suggested raising blood glucose level manifold. However this would need a careful crystallization of the problem statement by experts to make the exercise useful. Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n10. DATA MINING CASE STUDIES @ Bayer: GI adverse effect of short term Aspirin use. Meta analysis of AE comparison with similar drugs for mktg. & drug improvement. @ Pfizer: Uses mining to determine if certain AE’s are being reported with greater frequency than expected. large-scale semantic Web-based data mining and network methods to seek to uncover previously undiscovered historical links between chemical compounds, drugs, biological pathways, targets, genes and diseases. By using big data to bring together genomic data, clinical trials and EMR data, Pfizer was able to develop precise drug ‘Xalkori’ which proves very effective for around 5% of patients suffering from cancer who suffer mutation of their ALK gene. Through data mining, this sub section of population was identified which had a healthy lifestyle, yet got affected by cancer. It funded a study that would use genomic data mining to identify antigens in NTS (non-typhoidal salmonella) that may be used as targets for vaccine development. @ Johnson & Johnson: Has built an open source data management system called Transmart. The idea is to combine genomic data sets, from internal and external sources, using the platform's data standards and processing capabilities. This facilitates data mining which provides immense opportunities. Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n11. DATA MINING CASE STUDIES @ Novartis: In HTS, used Ontology Based Pattern Identification (OPI) algorithm to predict patters by which they were able to find out 1500 scaffold families with significant structure-HTS activity profile relationships. @ Astra Zeneca It uses data-mining tools to identify plausible preclinical Gastro Intestinal effects that may be associated with nausea and that could be of potential use in its prediction. A total of 86 marketed drugs were used in this analysis, and the main outcome was a confirmation that nausogenic and non-nausogenic drugs can be clearly separated based on their preclinical GI observations. . Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n12. CHEMOGENOMICS DATA MINING Chemogenomics is rapidly emerging as a way of helping discover new disease therapies and uncovering new uses for existing drugs. There are large structure activity databases set up by pharmaceutical companies and commercial vendors. These databases can be mined to derive insights into common properties or structural features among ligands linked to common features of the receptors to which they bind. These insights can then used for the rational compilation of screening sets or the knowledge-based synthesis of chemical libraries to accelerate lead finding. Can be used to reposition drugs and find new applications for existing drugs/molecules/compounds. Four Canadian government research funding agencies will spend around US$6.7 million to create a cloud computing facility and data mining tools that will enable researchers to access and use data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium. DM could lead to a systems-level understanding of the global physiology of the host–microbiota superorganism in health and disease. Such knowledge will provide a platform for the identification and development of new therapeutic strategies for chronic diseases possibly involving microbial as well as human-host targets that improve upon existing probiotics, prebiotics or antibiotics We can collect or organize known GPCR and non GPCR ligands and mining models can be trained based on such properties. New compounds can automatically be classified as ligand or non ligand based compound. Design and knowledge based synthesis of chemical libraries targeting subfamily of purinergic GPCR . Chemical scoffolds can be synthesized. Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n13.

FDA Janus: Janus creates an integrated data platform for most commercial tools for review, analysis and reporting. It reduces overall cost of information gathering and submissions, development process as well as review and analysis of information. It provides a common data model that is based on the SDTM standard to represent four classes of clinical data submitted to regulatory agencies: tabulation datasets, patient profiles, listings, etc. It provides central access to standardized data, and provides common data views across collaborative partners. It supports cross-trial analyses for data mining and helps detect clinical trends and address clinical hypotheses, and performs more advanced, robust analysis. This enables the ability to contrast and compare data from multiple clinical trials to help improve efficacy and safety. It facilitates a more efficient review process and ability to locate and query data more easily through automated processes and data standards. It provides a potentially broader data view for all clinical trials with proper security, de-identified patient data, and proper agreements in place to share data.Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n17. ERP v/s DWH People confuse between ERP and DWH. They are different as shown below: Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow ERP DWH  Detailed  Summarized  Facilitate data entry & storage  Facilitate quick analysis  Used by Operations  Used by Strategists  End users need to be trained  Generalist end users  No AdHoc reporting  Facilitates ad hoc reports  ERP for biochemical less available  Easily integrates and stores biochemical data\n\n18. DATABASE SOLUTIONS Drug discovery analytics is traditionally performed on Relational Database Management Systems. However with new discoveries, it does not remain an optimal choice. Discoveries require newer technologies. Commercial RDBMS have kept pace by introducing newer features (such as column store indexes) We design the RDBMS to consolidate data from disparate sources to facilitate analytics. We also convert existing DBMS systems to leverage newly introduced features. We also undertake performance enhancements, provide additional security and other maintenance tasks. Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n19. BIG DATA SOLUTIONS Definition – A collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications. The challenges include capture, curation, storage, search, sharing, transfer, analysis and visualization. The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to \"spot business trends, determine quality of research, prevent diseases, link legal citations, combat crime, and determine real-time roadway traffic conditions. Philosophy – To handle such huge data generated by Omics, regular computers are used that are networked/set up in such a way to make it loss proof and leverage individuals processors to work in synergy and solve bigger problems Companies have started offering cloud storage for big data and publicly available. Areas Covered:  Finding cause of diseases  Repositioning of drugs  Prescription of more effective drugs and procedures. Deliverable - We collect information about possible sources of data for related research area. We analyze the data for volume variety and velocity. We do a small pilot prototype of the big data set up using source big data on cloud. We set up programs to collect and process the data and then try to solve the hypothesis Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow\n\n20. BIG DATA SOLUTIONS Accommodator Consultancy Services Lucknow Use Case 1: Researchers found that previously undetected mutations in a single gene (called LMX1B) triggered focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a disease that scars the kidneys’ filtering system. This was possible after genome data was collected and compared for healthy and diseased individuals. Use Case 2: Big data approach already has predicted the efficacy of drug repurposing for treating colitis — a form of inflammatory bowel disease — small-cell lung cancer and other conditions, according to Scott Saywell, vice president, corporate development, NuMedii. Use Case 3: For patients, the use of big data analytics in drug development results in less trial and error when physicians prescribe drugs. This tighter targeting of drugs to disease also results in fewer side effects. According to new draft policy by Dept. of Biotechnology, Govt. of India, genome based prescription and treatment will be top priority in next few years. The draft policy envisages converting half of hospitals currently engaged in treatment of human diseases to that of prediction and prevention of diseases using genomic tools. It also aims to provide all available genetic screening tests to general public at affordable prices. Genome data processing and analysis has been possible by Big Data as genome (and other omics technologies) for just one individual results in data that tops 80 story building when translated on a paper.\n\n21.
