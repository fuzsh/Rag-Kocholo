        "text": "GUEST BLOGGER: Bill Gasarch This is my last day guest blogging, so I'll end where I began, THREE points on LUDDITES I) Janos Simon corrected my history of Luddites, for which I thank him. If you are interested, go to HIS comment on MY post from Monday Jan 23 for a link to a very nice article. II) My father and father-in-law offer an interesting contrast: FATHER-IN-LAW (Engineering Major, career mostly in Business, now retired): LUDDITE: Does not program his VCR. Not sure if he doesn't know how to or just doesn't want to. So he HAS to be home on Sunday to watch Desperate Housewives (a show I found distasteful- My father in law is hipper than I am). NON-LUDDITE: Took a course on C at a local community college when he was 70. Pays all his bills on line. FATHER (English Major, High School English Teacher and Vice Principal, now retired) LUDDITE: Got a computer recently and still can't get email or pay his bills on line. NON-LUDDITE: Uses his VCR to tape ALOT of shows. He needs it since he watches ALOT: West Wing, My Name is Earl, The Sopranos, Sex in the City when it was on (a show I find distasteful- My dad is hipper than I am), 6 feet under, Deadwood, all four Law and Orders, and all three CSI's, Without a trace, other stuff I can't recall. This from the man who restricted me, wisely, to no more than an hour of TV a night when I was a kid.) III) Stuart Kurtz emailed me some more questions for my Luddite quiz. I asked him if I could post them and he suggested asking for other inputs. No one replied, so here are his: STUART BEGIN: 9) Do you write emails (or blog posts) in a) variable width fonts with formatting, b) variable width fonts without formatting, c) fixed width fonts, d) What's a blog?, e) What's email?, or f) What's writing? 10) Do you indicate emphasis by a) using italic or slanted font, b) using a bold faced font, c) metadiscourse, i.e., \"I want to emphasize that... \", d) ALL CAPS, or e) Shouting and waving your arms. 11) Does your mouse have a) four buttons, b) three buttons, c) two buttons, d) one button, e) control characters are good enough for RMS, and they're good enough for me, or f) four feet and a tail. 12) What's your favorite programming language? a) Ruby or Python, b) Java c) Lisp, d) C++, e) Awk, f) IBM-360 assembly language, g) C, h) Lisp, or i) graduate student. [I know Lisp occurs twice, but c and h are still different answers. Note that there's no point asking for Perl -- as Perl programmers can only write, not read.] STUART END. bill g. P.S. I am supposed to say ``Now that I've guest blogged for a week I'm even more impressed with Lance getting a topic out every day'' But this is NOT TRUE. I was SO IMPRESSED with Lance in the first place that I can't be ``more impressed''\n\nGUEST BLOGGER BILL GASARCH TOPIC: How much is what we do influenced by non-scientific criteria? (BEFORE I START TODAYS BLOG- A REQUEST. EMAIL ME OTHER LUDDITE QUESTIONS- I WILL POST THE BEST ONES ON FRIDAY) I) AN INCOMPLETE SUMMARY OF Thomas Kuhn's book The Structure of Scientific Revolution: For long periods of time a field of science will agree on the basic terms and problems of the field and will all work with that worldview (also called a paradigm). This is called Normal Science. This is GOOD since if people were working with different paradigms progress would be hard. BUT there comes a time when some problems just cannot be solved using the usual techniques. There will be an effort to jam this problem and some approaches to it into the current paradigm, but eventually, the old paradigm will fall and a new one will take its place. The new one will help to answer some old questions, and pose new ones that could not have even been asked in the old one. Newtonian Phy vs Einstein is the usual example, though there are others on a much less cosmic scale. II) People after him have misconstrued his work to saying that science has NO objective truth, that it ALL depends on the Paradigm. This is, of course, hogwash. More so when they claim that its a tool by the elite to dominate the masses, or some such (look up SOKAL HOAX on google for one view of this view). III) But a fair question CAN be raised along these lines: How MUCH of what scientists do depends on political or personality or other factors VERSUS how much is driven by objective scientific principles? A few examples a) What if in response to Russell's paradox the math world essentially axiomized what set theorist now call V=L (every object is constructable). Then we would know LOTs more about L, we would KNOW that the Axiom of Choice is true, and we would know that Cont Hyp is true. We might know that there were these weird other models that are unnatural where CH is false, but we wouldn't care. (Some Set Theorists tell me this could never happen- that people would be interested in other models. They are wrong.) b) What if in response to the Banach Tarski paradox mathematicians rejected some version of the axiom of choice? This would have been quite possible before AC began being used in so many places. c) The people who believe in constructive methods only (e.g, Brouwer) are portrayed as cranky old men holding onto an old paradigm that no longer worked. But if they had won then people like Hilbert would be viewed as crazy rebels who fortunately were never taken seriously. (This one I am less sure of- nonconstructive techniques are SO powerful that I think they may be inevitable.) d) If Computing Devices were invented either earlier or later then they were would have a drastic effect on Theory. While we think that P vs NP is a natural problem, it only came out once the technology was in place. Was it inevitable that it arise? Probably Was it inevitable that it be considered important? Hard to say. e) There is ALOT of work in Quantum Computing because (i) Peter Shor proved FACTORING in Quantum P hence giving the problem new interest, or (ii) There is (or actually was) lots of Grant money in it. (of course these two are linked) f) Do schools like MIT have too big an influence on what gets studied? (They have less influence now than the used to.) MORE GENERALLY, if I had the time and the energy I would do research on history/phil of math asking the question HOW MUCH DO EXTERNAL FORCES EFFECT WHAT IS STUDIED ? and I would do it WITHOUT an ax to grind.\n\nGUEST BLOGGER: Bill Gasarch (I will be guest blogging this week while Lance is on Vacation.) Are you a Luddite? The original Luddites were workers who, scared of lower wages via technology, destroyed factory machines. This was around 1811. Their leader was General Ned Ludd. (Not sure if General was an honorary title) TODAY the term has come to mean someone who does not adapt to technology or does not like technology. If you are NOT one, you can use Google to find out more about them. Are you a Luddite? I offer the following questions and let you score yourselves. 1) At a conference do you use a) Powerpoint with fancy animation and pictures off the web. b) Powerpoint with nice backgrounds, but nothing much else c) pdf files d) physical slides made using latex e) physical slides made using magic markers and overlays f) physical slides without overlays g) chalk h) draw diagrams in the sand with a twig 2) Same as question 1 but for large classroom lecture (over 50), small classroom lectures (under 10), seminars (8 people who actually know something). 3) For writing papers do you use a) LaTeX (or some other package) b) Typewriter (YOU HAVE A TYPEWRITER? MIGHT BE WORTH SOMETHING ON EBAY! c) Handwritten and give to your secretary to type (YOU HAVE A SECRETARY? MIGHT BE WORTH SOMETHING ON EBAY!) d) Quill pen and inkwell on parchment. 4) When listening to talks do you a) Take notes with an e-pen that automatically puts it online b) Take notes in an e-notebook c) Take notes in a p-notebook (thats paper) c) Not take notes at all d) Fall asleep 5) When you applied to grad school did you a) Check out the website of the school b) Ask your roomate who also majored in CS and Math c) Ask your roomate who majored in Political Science d) Apply to schools you heard were good e) Apply to schools randomly (time bounded Kolmogorov Random) 6) If you need a result that is already known do you a) Goto Google b) Goto the library c) Goto your own file cabinet d) Rederive the result by yourself 7) Which of these might you most likely say? a) When is the next version coming out so I can update? b) I'll update in 2 years (and you do) c) I'll update in 2 years (but you don't) d) You can have my chalk when you pry it from my cold dead hands. 8) Do you play music on a) MP3's b) CD's c) LP's d) 78's e) Wax Cylinders (WAX CYLINDERS! MIGHT BE WORTH SOMETHING ON EBAY!) bill g. Postscript: Thanks to my collegue Jack Lutz for catching that I spelled Luddite wrong originally. I used him instead of a spell checker, and note that the error he found would not have been discovered with a spell checker.\n\nI am on vacation next week and I've lined up Bill Gasarch as a guest Blogger in my absence. But today we have a guest post from Kamal Jain. This is a long post but well worth reading through.\n\nThis post is prompted by recent development and discussions on electronic publishing, which themselves are prompted by book scanning initiative of Google and Open Content Alliance. Although, I am not talking about paper books being converted into electronic format, I like the idea of having the books available in a searchable electronic format. And certainly this is a must have feature for any newly written book.\n\nRecently, I got two invitations to write for books. The first was to write a book on Network Coding. I felt that I was not the best person so I did not accept. If I had, then I would have insisted on a free electronic copy. Second, I got an invitation to co-write a chapter on Cost Sharing with Mohammad Mahdian for a book, Algorithmic Game Theory, edited by, Noam Nisan, Tim Roughgarden, Eva Tardos and Vijay Vazirani. I agreed to this because I felt that such a book is a great idea and I could make a positive contribution. My selfish motive was to spread knowledge of the subject to which I have contributed. And, I guess that was also the expected motive of the other contributors. This I could say because the explicit incentive offered in the invitation to the contributors was that the editors (originally Eva and Vijay only) have made an excellent deal with a publisher, Springer Verlag. The deal they have is $40 for up to six hundred pages. I am not sure whether it is a paper back or hard-cover. But that was not my focus anyway. My focus is the absence of any electronic publishing component in the deal. Because of that, I felt this is not such a good deal in today's electronic age. On one side we are talking about scanning paper books, starting electronic journals, writing wikis, blogs and on the other we do not even make a deal on electronic publishing of newly written books. I wrote an email back to the editors that I do not think Springer deal is a good one. I was hoping to get back a response and start a discussion with them on this, which IMO, was obligatory for them because I point blank disagreed with the incentive they explicitly offered. At this point I am assuming that there is no electronic publishing agreement with the publisher. This was the background.\n\nNow, I realize that this is not something to discuss with the editors in private. This is an important issue which is likely to reoccur in other situations. So I requested this space from Lance so that I could discuss with the whole community. Following are some of my random thoughts and I like to hear everybody's thoughts too, random or not :-) Please press the comment button and put your thoughts in writing so that Springer and other publishers would know what we want from them.\n\nThere are at least two kinds of books. First kind, written by individual authors. Second kind, written collaboratively by the community like the above proposed Algorithmic Game Theory. Individual authors write books for various reasons and it is up to them what kind of deal they lock with the publishers. The books written by a community has a predetermined goal and that is to spread the knowledge of the subject. It is not up to one or two persons to lock whatever deal they think is great. So the community must form unspoken guidelines to facilitate the negotiation between editors and publishers. These unspoken guidelines must include minimum desires of the community. Such a set of guidelines would have resolved the prisoner's dilemma for me. I did not like the absence of electronic publishing agreement. If I decline the invitation then the book still has gone ahead without my contribution and if I accept the invitation, which I did, then I know that my efforts are not optimally used. But in case it were a common expectation from the editors to negotiate an electronic publishing agreement, then I know that I could reject the invitation because others invitee would also do the same, thereby insisting that the editors go back to the publisher and make an electronic publishing agreement. One would ask why publishers have any electronic publishing agreement. For information, Reinhard Diestel's book, Graph Theory, has a free searchable and hyperlinked electronic edition and further this book is published by Springer Verlag. Let us first discuss what Springer provides to us and what we provide to Springer. Then we should discuss whether we are getting the optimal deal.\n\nSpringer does the marketing which sells the book.\n\nSpringer provides the brand name which sells the book.\n\nSpringer provides the brand name which makes the line in our resume about the book a bit bolder.\n\nSpringer prints and binds the book, for which the buyer pays.\n\nSpringer gave peanut financial support ($2000) to pay to students to draw pictures. This fund is for those contributors who do not have their own funds.\n\nWe give to Springer\n\nFree content and transfer copyright so that they can legally publish the content. I am assuming there is no royalties involved in a community written book.\n\nWord of mouth marketing.\n\nUse our own funds for other expenses.\n\nOur university or companies resources.\n\nWhat are the possible deals we could have:\n\nStatus Quo. Springer publishes the book and sells them. Takes the copyright and does not provide free electronic copy. In future, if Springer wants, makes more money from electronic copy too.\n\nReinhard Diestel model. Provides free searchable and hyperlinked electronic edition. A user can't conveniently print the pages.\n\nSpringer publishes the book and sells them. Takes an exclusive time bound license, say one year. After one year, Springer still keeps the exclusive license on the paper publishing, but we could put the free electronic copies on our webpages.\n\nSpringer publishes the book and sells them. Takes the exclusive right to publish the book in paper format — that's all it needs to legally publish the book. We keep all other rights. We put the book in electronic format on our webpages or at some cheap servers.\n\nNote that in all the above 4 options Springer is still getting something for free — the content. So it still is a good deal for Springer. 1. is the best deal for Springer. The only reason Springer could insist on 1. is because we do not insist with unity (Reinhard probably insisted very hard). If we insist then we could possibly get them to agree on 4. It is an irony that this book is about Game Theory, and the game theory principles are not used to get a better deal. Mohammad suggested that even if Springer wins on getting the first deal, we could still put our chapters on our webpages. This does not make sense because of three reasons. First, there are going to be cross-references. Second, the chapters together provide a synergy and that's the reason we all agreed to put our chapters together. Third, if we could all put chapters on our webpages then why can't we compile them together and put on a single webpage. A book is more than the sum of its chapters. A question which is typically raised about free electronic version is the following. If people could download the book for free then why would they buy from Springer? I think people would still buy, libraries would buy, professors would buy and anybody who needs to read a significant part of the book would buy. Still, for a moment let us assume that people won't buy the paper book in the presence of a free electronic version. In this case, it simply means people want only the free electronic version and not the paid paper version. That is having only the electronic version is what everybody desires. Then, under this assumption, why even deal with Springer?\n\nBecause, as mentioned above, Springer provides some value. We could still avoid Springer and create these values ourselves. We anyway will be spending couple of thousand hours on this book (my experience on working with Vijay is that it takes at least few hours per page). There are at least two ways to avoid Springer.\n\nWe go to a small publisher and get the book published. Transfer the exclusive right to publish the book in paper format. We keep all other rights.\n\nWe publish only the electronic version.\n\nWhat role would Springer play?\n\nSpringer does the marketing. We will discuss this later to see how we could do the marketing ourselves.\n\nSpringer provides the brand name to sell the book. I think the brand name of the editors and the authors is much more in this case. This is also the case with any good book written by a community.\n\nSpringer provides the brand name to make the line related to this book in our resume a bit bolder. First, most authors contributing in the book already have enough lines in their resume that they can do with one fewer line. Second, this line is minor for a community written book. Each person contributes a chapter, may be equivalent to writing one or two journal papers.\n\nSpringer prints and binds the book. I do not know how much it costs to print and bind the book. \"The Search\" by John Battelle is a three hundred page hard-bound book and available at 16 bucks at Amazon. Well The Search probably will sell more than this technical book. But it shows that $40 for Algorithmic Game Theory could very well be an optimum profit making point for Springer rather than a favor as they want to portray to us. A small publisher would be able to beat that even in the presence of competing free electronic version.\n\nThe last is the peanut financial support. I am sure we could arrange $2000 bucks without Springer. Even if we fail, grad student would be happy to contribute this for a credit. If I do not personally have time to draw pictures, then I do not mind having a co-author who does that for me. A picture is worth thousand words. If I am claiming authorship for writing thousand words then anybody who draws pictures deserves the equal credit.\n\nSo the only value Springer provides is marketing. There are various ways we could do that too.\n\nWe create a pamphlet and a poster which we distribute to the program chair of various conferences.\n\nPut the electronic version at one place. Let each of the contributor links to it. If there are fifty links from places like, Cornell, Georgia Tech, Stanford then on searches related to the keyword in the book, the book should show up at the top.\n\nLet Citeseer crawl the book, let Google crawl the book, let us upload it on Wikipedia.\n\nEven if it is not sufficient then we could market for money via search engine paid listing. We could raise the money by having only one or two ads in the book, let us say in the content and index pages. If we have an electronic version we could even have Google Adsense ads at the book download page. Certainly Google Adsense would put ads for academic people. In this case, if we are anyway buying something we could buy through those ads.\n\nOne question which one could raise is that many people in the world still live on the other side of the digital divide. But such people do not have $40 bucks either. The solution for them is to have a publisher in India or China to publish this book and sells to these people.\n\nPre-bottom line is we give more to Springer than it is giving back in return. Game theoretically it is not a fair solution and we could do better. I am not sure whether there is any electronic publishing deal which the editors of this book have with the publisher, if they had then they probably would have told me. In any case this posting is about many others future books which will be written co-operatively. Bottom line is, any book which is not written for money must be available free of charge in an electronic format.\n\nThe Internet has led to a complete shifts in how we deal with storing and sharing information, but when it comes to academic papers the changes we see are ad hoc and added in a piecemeal basis.\n\nSuppose we could start from scratch and create a proper system for research papers. Here is how I would envision such a system.\n\nXML has become the standard for storing information on the internet; it gives a simple machine-readable method for creating tree structures. Academic papers have such a tree structure (Sections, subsections, theorems, proofs, etc.) that would lend it itself well to XML. Mathematical equations should also be written using XML, we already have a MathML specification for doing this.\n\nA academic paper XML file would only have content information, not any formatting information. For this we would use XSL files, themselves XML files that describe how to format the document. You would use different XSL files depending on whether the paper is viewed on the screen or printed, and different publishers can develop their own XSL files to have consistent looking papers. LaTeX, the system used by most theoretical computer scientists, has similar capabilities but because LaTeX does not enforce any standards, changing style files often requires considerable editing.\n\nResearchers will not have to create these XML files directly (unless they want to) but can use word processors that will save the documents according to those standards.\n\nFor citations we should just point to a unique identifier for a paper, no longer should we need to cut and paste bibliographic information. The formatting program can go online based on the identifier to get the information to create a human readable bibliography with web links if appropriate. Most publishers already use Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), we just need DOIs to point to an XML file giving bibliographic information, have DOIs for unpublished papers and have a method for DOIs to point to a later version of a paper.\n\nThe author information on academic papers are often useless (like my postal address) or out of date as academics change locations. Each academic research should get their own DOI-like number that points to an XML file giving personal and contact information and then we only need add these DOIs to the academic papers.\n\nMost importantly we need to have enforced standards for each of these XML documents (via XML schemas). If we can truly separate the content from the formatting of documents, and make that content available in an easy machine-readable forms, not only can researchers focus more on the writing and less on the style but will also open the door to applications that we cannot even imagine today."
