        "text": "Quantum poetry for the skeptics had long roots, and, also here, Peter Shor along with Jennifer Shor had a pioneering role. Volker Strassen’s response is the earliest poem known to me on the skeptics’ side. We will start with Jennifer and Peter’s poem and to Volker Strassen’s response and move on to other heroic quantum poem-writers Daniel Gottesman and John Preskill. (Here is a link to Part I in the series.)\n\nClassic Quantum Poetry and Art\n\nJennifer and Peter Shor and Volker Strassen (before 1998)\n\n(source)\n\nHere is what Peter wrote:\n\n” My wife and I wrote the following for a poetry contest by Science News. It didn’t win, so I posted it on my web page.\n\nIf computers that you build are quantum,\n\nThen spies of all factions will want ’em.\n\nOur codes will all fail,\n\nAnd they’ll read our email,\n\nTill we’ve crypto that’s quantum, and daunt ’em.\n\nJennifer and Peter Shor\n\nWhen he introduced me at the 1998 International Congress of Mathematicians, Prof. Volker Strassen recited my limerick, and added a reply:\n\nTo read our E-mail, how mean\n\nof the spies and their quantum machine;\n\nBe comforted though,\n\nthey do not yet know\n\nhow to factorize twelve or fifteen.\n\nVolker Strassen”\n\nEarly sonnet and poetic art work by Daniel Gottesman\n\n(Here is the link Quantum Error Correction Sonnet.)\n\nQuantum Error Correction Sonnet\n\nBy Daniel Gottesman\n\nWe cannot clone, perforce; instead, we split\n\nCoherence to protect it from that wrong\n\nThat would destroy our valued quantum bit\n\nAnd make our computation take too long.\n\nCorrect a flip and phase – that will suffice.\n\nIf in our code another error’s bred,\n\nWe simply measure it, then God plays dice,\n\nCollapsing it to X or Y or Zed.\n\nWe start with noisy seven, nine, or five\n\nAnd end with perfect one. To better spot\n\nThose flaws we must avoid, we first must strive\n\nTo find which ones commute and which do not.\n\nWith group and eigenstate, we’ve learned to fix\n\nYour quantum errors with our quantum tricks.\n\nFebruary 25, 1999\n\nAbove: Daniel’s artistic view of quantum error correction\n\nJohn Preskill\n\nJohn is a prolific poet, I am not aware of poetry he wrote specifically for quantum computer skeptics (It’s never too late for that, go John!), but he has several other quantum poems. (See also below for a poetic slogan by John.) His anyon poem\n\nAnyon, Anyon (click for the full poem.)\n\nStarts with\n\nAnyon, anyon, where do you roam?\n\nBraid for a while before you go home.\n\nHere is a recent haiku by John\n\nQubits very cold\n\nA dil fridge holds them gently\n\nMustn’t decohere\n\n#QuantumHaiku\n\nAnd a 2001 poem quantum cryptography. (The link contains some attempts to find rhymes for “Daniel Gottesman”.)\n\nQuantum Cryptography\n\nAlice said to her friend Eve,\n\n“Why do you practice to deceive?\n\nYou know I need to talk to Bob.\n\nWithout that I won’t have a job.\n\n“Bob can’t know where my note has been.\n\nHe thinks that you are listening in.\n\nHe wonders if it’s safe enough\n\nFor me to send him secret stuff.\n\n“And Bob’s right not to trust you, Eve,\n\nWith quantum tricks stuffed up your sleeve.\n\nBut he thinks we can freeze you out,\n\nWith quantum tricks we’ve learned about.\n\n“With quantum states, what we achieve\n\nDefeats whatever you conceive.\n\nSo even Bob has to believe\n\nThat you can’t hear us, can you Eve?”\n\nJohn Preskill, November 1, 2001\n\nPoetic classic quantum slogans and quotes\n\nJohn Preskill: slogan for quantum error correction (classic, 1997)\n\nWe can fight entanglement with entanglement\n\nDaniel Gottesman: slogan for quantum error correction (1999, see sonnet above)\n\nWith group and eigenstate, we’ve learned to fix\n\nYour quantum errors with our quantum tricks.\n\nScott Aaronson: (source) (repeatedly in various forms since 2012 or so.)\n\nThe number one application of quantum computers is to disprove Gil Kalai who said they are impossible.\n\nGil Kalai (2013):\n\nThe importance of quantum error-correction to physics is similar to the importance of non-deterministic computation to the theory of computing. Their importance is that they cannot be achieved.\n\n(source)\n\nJohn Martinis (2014) (source)\n\nECH ≠ MNP\n\nECH stands for “Experimentally Crazy Hard” and refers to monumental experimental physics achievements. MNP refers to “Maximum Nature Publications”.\n\n(Martinis led the Sycamore experiment, and Nature is the journal where the sycamore paper appeared.)\n\nDavid Deutsch\n\nQuantum computation is a distinctively new way of harnessing nature. It will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes.\n\nTo me quantum computation is a new and deeper and better way to understand the laws of physics, and hence understanding physical reality as a whole.\n\nQuantum computers as seen by Michel Dyakonov, myself, and Alexander Vlasov\n\nMotivation"
