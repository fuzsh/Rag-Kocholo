        "text": "The objective of the thesis is to model a hybrid quantum processor capable of executing quantum algorithms. The hybrid quantum processor has a co-processor architecture, in which a quantum processing module is embedded within a classical MIPS-R2000 processor. The model is designed and simulated using VHDL. A quantum assembly language (QASM) and its assembler are developed to allow programmers to describe quantum circuits. The model’s architecture is designed to execute the instructions of the QASM language. Assembly languages containing both quantum QASM instructions as well as classical MIPS instructions are also executable on this model. In addition to that, quantum C++ classes and functions are developed to allow programmers to describe quantum algorithms using C++ and simulate them on the proposed model. Unlike previous work on modeling pre-specified quantum circuits using VHDL, the proposed work is considered a general purpose model capable of modeling arbitrary quantum circuits and algorithms. The QASM language on its own succeeded in simulating “pure” quantum circuits which only contain quantum gates, such as: EPR creation circuit, Toffoli gate circuit, and quantum Fourier transform circuit. The quantum teleportation circuit, which contains classical components as well as quantum gates, was simulated using a C/C++ program containing quantum functions or macros, which was compiled to a hybrid assembly language containing both QASM and MIPS instructions. The proposed model can execute programs written in other high-level quantum programming languages, if compilers are developed to translate such languages into the proposed low-level QASM language.\n\nThere exist quantum algorithms that are more efficient than their classical counterparts; such algorithms were invented by Shor in 1994 and then Grover in 1996. A lack of invention since Grover's algorithm has been commonly attributed to the non-intuitive nature of quantum algorithms to the classically trained person. Thus, the idea of using computers to automatically generate quantum algorithms based on an evolutionary model emerged. A limitation of this approach is that quantum computers do not yet exist and quantum simulation on a classical machine has an exponential order overhead. Nevertheless, early research into evolving quantum algorithms has shown promise. This paper provides an introduction into quantum and evolutionary algorithms for the computer scientist not familiar with these fields. The exciting field of using evolutionary algorithms to evolve quantum algorithms is then reviewed."
