        "text": "üèÜProud to Receive the Certificate of Excellence in Quantum Cryptography! üèÜ I'm absolutely delighted to share a significant milestone in my learning journey - the Certificate of Excellence for successfully completing the Quantum30 Learning Challenge in Quantum Cryptography! üöÄ Over the past 30 days, I've had the privilege of diving deep into the captivating world of quantum mysteries and cryptographic marvels. From grasping the fundamentals of quantum mechanics to exploring advanced cryptographic algorithms, this journey has been nothing short of transformative. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Quantum Computing India for curating this exceptional learning experience. The seamless blend of theory, practical application, and the support of a vibrant community made this challenge an unforgettable exploration of the quantum realm. This certificate is not just a recognition of my efforts but also a testament to the power of continuous learning and the boundless opportunities that await in the fields of quantum computing and cryptography. Here's to the pursuit of knowledge, the thrill of discovery, and the incredible potential of quantum cryptography! üåü #CertificateOfExcellence #QuantumCryptography #Quantum30 #LifelongLearning #AchievementUnlocked #QuantumComputingIndia #LinkedIn\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Peter Shor's groundbreaking algorithm opened the door to quantum computing's immense potential. It demonstrated how a hypothetical quantum computer could factor large numbers into their prime components far more efficiently than classical machines, challenging the foundations of internet security relying on public-key cryptography. Fast forward to today, Oded Regev, a computer scientist at New York University, has unveiled a groundbreaking variant of Shor's algorithm, altering the relationship between the size of the number being factored and the required quantum operations. This development marks a significant leap forward in quantum computing and cryptography. It's an exciting breakthrough that has the potential to revolutionize the industry and reshape our understanding of computational complexity. While further optimization is needed to apply this algorithm practically, it represents a remarkable advancement in the field. The broader message here is clear: quantum computing researchers must remain open to unexpected surprises and continue exploring new frontiers in this ever-evolving landscape. Don't miss this enlightening article that delves into the future of quantum computing and its potential impacts on our digital world. https://lnkd.in/gKthh8We #QuantumComputing #Cryptography #Innovation #Tech #IP #VC #Patents #DeepTech #Quantum\n\nQuantum computing has a hype problem \"Established applications for quantum computers do exist. The best known is Peter Shor‚Äôs 1994 theoretical demonstration that a quantum computer can solve the hard problem of finding the prime factors of large numbers exponentially faster than all classical schemes. Prime factorization is at the heart of breaking the universally used RSA-based cryptography, so Shor‚Äôs factorization scheme immediately attracted the attention of national governments everywhere, leading to considerable quantum-computing research funding. \" \"There are proposals to use small-scale quantum computers for drug design, as a way to quickly calculate molecular structure, which is a baffling application given that quantum chemistry is a minuscule part of the whole process. Equally perplexing are claims that near-term quantum computers will help in finance. No technical papers convincingly demonstrate that small quantum computers, let alone NISQ machines, can lead to significant optimization in algorithmic trading or risk evaluation or arbitrage or hedging or targeting and prediction or asset trading or risk profiling. This however has not prevented several investment banks from jumping on the quantum-computing bandwagon.\" By Sankar Das Sarma at MIT Technology Review Link https://lnkd.in/ddjbKVws\n\nQuantum leaps in learning! I had an incredible time at the \"Introduction to Quantum Computing\" live workshop with UCL Quantum Science and Technology Institute last week! The highlight? Getting our hands dirty with IBM's Quantum Platform for the first practice lessons. It was just pure, fascinating fun! Huge thanks to the UCLQ team for this eye-opening experience. It's amazing to see how quantum theory comes to life in practical applications. https://lnkd.in/eH4-fqqP Quantum computers are coming, and they're not here for the office ping-pong tournament. These subatomic smarty-pants are threatening to crash our crypto party faster than you can say \"Schr√∂dinger's cat.\" Imagine a nerd with superpowers who can read your diary, steal your lunch money, and solve your Rubik's cube ‚Äì all before you've had your morning coffee. That's quantum computing for ya! So, unless you want your firewalls to become as effective as a chocolate teapot, it's time to quantum-proof your cyber defenses. Remember, in the quantum world, your bits and bytes are like an all-you-can-eat buffet for these qubit-crunching monsters. Don't let your data become quantum toast! Upgrade your crypto game now, or risk becoming the punchline in the cosmic joke of cybersecurity.\n\nDay 16 of the #quantum30 challenge with Quantum Computing India: The beginner's path to quantum computing üñ•‚öô Today was the sixteenth day (delayed) of the Quantum30 challenge, where we learned about Quantum Cryptography. Here are some of my valuable takeaways from today's learning: ‚≠êThe current cryptographic codes that are being used online are mostly called public key systems. ‚≠êIt's an algorithm that encrypts a message into a mess that is not understandable but predictable by the receiver. Since the key is public, anyone can encrypt the message but only the receiver can decrypt it. ‚≠êThe method is easy to do but hard to undo. One of the most common forms of this is the division of a very large number into primes. The idea is that it is easy to multiply the numbers but hard to find the factors when only the product is given. ‚≠êThese keys are widely used as they are practically very safe; for the large numbers that are being used, it will take millions of years to find the prime factors on a standard computer. However, a quantum computer could speed up the process incredibly fast and we will no longer have the time advantage of this encryption. ‚≠êScientists are currently working on encryption methods where a quantum computer does not bring any advantage, called post-quantum cryptography. ‚≠êQuantum key distribution - Usage of quantum particles along with their properties like superposition and the dual wave nature in order to securely exchange encryption keys. ‚≠êQKD works because if an intruder tries to measure the spin of the photons, the act of measuring changes the key itself. This means that the sender and the receiver will find out if someone has tried to listen in to the message due to the mismatch in the received key. #quantumcomputing #quantum30 #quantumcomputingindia #quantumscience"
