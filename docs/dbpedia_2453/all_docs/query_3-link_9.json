        "text": "The Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science is sponsored jointly by the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the Association for Computing Machinery, Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (ACM-SIGACT). The award is presented annually, with the presentation taking place alternately at the International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP) and the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC). The nineteenth prize will be awarded at the 43rd ACM symposium on the Theory of Computingto be held as part of FCRC in San Jose, California, in June 2011. The Prize is named in honor of Kurt Gödel in recognition of his major contributions to mathematical logic and of his interest, discovered in a letter he wrote to John von Neumann shortly before von Neumann’s death, in what has become the famous “P versus NP” question. The Prize includes an award of USD 5000.\n\nAWARD COMMITTEE : The winner of the Prize is selected by a committee of six members. The EATCS President and the SIGACT Chair each appoint three members to the committee, to serve staggered three-year terms. The committee is chaired alternately by representatives of EATCS and SIGACT. The 2011 Award Committee consists of Sanjeev Arora (Princeton), Josep Diaz (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya), Cynthia Dwork (Microsoft Research), Mogens Nielsen (University of Aarhus), Mike Paterson (University of Warwick) and Eli Upfal (Brown University).\n\nELIGIBILITY : The last change of rules goes back to the 2005 Prize. The (parametric) rule can be found on websites of both SIGACT and EATCS. The rule for the 2011 Prize is given below and supersedes any different interpretation of the parametric rule. Any research paper or series of papers by a single author or by a team of authors is deemed eligible if\n\n(i)the paper was published in a recognized refereed journal no later than December 10, 2010;\n\n(ii)the main results were not published (in either preliminary or final form) in a journal or conference proceedings before January 1st, 1998.\n\nThe research work nominated for the award should be in the area of theoretical computer science. The term “theoretical computer science” is meant to encompass, but is not restricted to, those areas covered by ICALP and STOC. Nominations are encouraged from the broadest spectrum of the theoretical computer science community so as to ensure that potential award winning papers are not overlooked. The Award Committee shall have the ultimate authority to decide whether a particular paper is eligible for the Prize.\n\nNOMINATIONS : Nominations for the award should be submitted by email to the Award Committee Chair : Eli Upfal eli@cs.brown.edu . To be considered, nominations for the 2011 Prize must be received by December 10, 2010. Nominations may be made by any member of the scientific community. It is the duty of the Award Committee to actively solicit nominations. A nomination should contain a brief summary of the technical content of the paper(s) and a brief explanation of its significance. A printable copy of the research paper or papers should accompany the nomination. The nomination must state the date and venue of the first conference or workshop publication or state that no such publication has occurred. The work may be in any language. However, if it is not in English, a more extended summary written in English should be enclosed. Additional recommendations in favor of the nominated work may also be enclosed. To be considered for the award, the paper or series of papers must be recommended by at least two individuals, either in the form of two distinct nominations or one nomination including recommendations from two different people. Those intending to submit a nomination are encouraged to contact the Award Committee Chair by email well in advance. The Award Committee will accept informal proposals of potential nominees, as well as tentative offers to prepare formal nominations. The “Subject” line of all related messages should begin with\n\n“Gödel 2011”.\n\nSELECTION PROCESS: Although the Award Committee is encouraged to consult with the theoretical computer science community at large, the Award Committee is solely responsible for the selection of the winner of the award. The Prize may be shared by more than one paper or series of papers, and the Award Committee reserves the right to declare no winner at all. All matters relating to the selection process that are not specified here are left to the discretion of the Award Committee.\n\nPAST WINNERS:\n\n2010: S. Arora.
