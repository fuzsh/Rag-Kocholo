        "text": "American mathematician\n\nNot to be confused with the British politician Peter Shore.\n\nPeter Williston Shor (born August 14, 1959) is an American professor of applied mathematics at MIT. He is known for his work on quantum computation, in particular for devising Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring exponentially faster than the best currently-known algorithm running on a classical computer.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nShor was born in New York City to Joan Bopp Shor and S. W. Williston Shor.[10][11] He grew up in Washington, D.C. and Mill Valley, California.[10] While attending Tamalpais High School, he placed third in the 1977 USA Mathematical Olympiad.[12] After graduation that year, he won a silver medal at the International Math Olympiad in Yugoslavia (the U.S. team achieved the most points per country that year).[13][14] He received his B.S. in Mathematics in 1981 for undergraduate work at Caltech,[15] and was a Putnam Fellow in 1978. He earned his PhD in Applied Mathematics from MIT in 1985.[16] His doctoral advisor was F. Thomson Leighton, and his thesis was on probabilistic analysis of bin-packing algorithms.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter being awarded his PhD by MIT, he spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and then accepted a position at Bell Labs in New Providence, New Jersey. It was there he developed Shor's algorithm. This development was inspired by Simon's problem, where he first solved the discrete log problem (which relates point-finding on a hypercube to a torus) and,\n\n\"Later that week, I was able to solve the factoring problem as well. There’s a strange relation between discrete log and factoring.\"[17]\n\nDue to their similarity as HSP problems, Shor discovered a related factoring problem (Shor's algorithm) that same week for which he was awarded the Nevanlinna Prize at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998[18][19] and the Gödel Prize in 1999.[20] In 1999, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.[21] In 2017, he received the Dirac Medal of the ICTP and for 2019 the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences.[22]\n\nShor began his MIT position in 2003. Currently, he is the Henry Adams Morss and Henry Adams Morss, Jr. Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at MIT.[23] He also is affiliated with CSAIL.[24]\n\nHe received a Distinguished Alumni Award from Caltech in 2007.[15]\n\nOn October 1, 2011, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[25][26] He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2019 \"for contributions to quantum-computing, information theory, and randomized algorithms\".[27] He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2002.[28] In 2020, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering contributions to quantum computation.[29]\n\nIn an interview published in Nature on October 30, 2020, Shor said that he considers post-quantum cryptography to be a solution to the quantum threat, although a lot of engineering effort is required to switch from vulnerable algorithms.[30]\n\nAlong with three others, Shor was awarded the 2023 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for \"foundational work in the field of quantum information.\"[9]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nEntanglement-assisted classical capacity\n\nKeller's conjecture\n\nStabilizer code\n\nQuantum capacity\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter W.
