        "text": "Abstract:Â\n\nQuantum communication allowsÂ two communicating parties (Alice and Bob)Â to share a secret at a distance - the encryption key.Â Relying on the basicÂ principle of quantum mechanics - measurement affects the measured state, Alice and Bob canÂ verify the security of the key, since any eavesdropper (Eve) will be revealed by the measurement traces she leaves behind.Â\n\nI will discuss the current limits on the speed of quantum communication, which are primarily due to the limitations of the standard quantum measurement of optical states (single photons or very weak light). I will reviewÂ theÂ broad context of quantum measurement, and the standard homodyne methods that are limited by the electronic bandwidth of photo-detectors. I will then describe our recently demonstrated parallel optical homodyne measurement that allows to overcome thisÂ limitÂ completely1. Using optical parametric amplification, we could measure quantum optical squeezing simultaneously across a bandwidth of 55THz.\n\nFinally, I willÂ discuss our implementation of this new measurement method for broadband, parallel Quantum communication, where many quantum channels (up to 1000) can be multiplexed over a single broadband squeezer and using a single measurement device.Â\n\n1 Yaakov Shaked, Yoad Michael, Rafi Vered, Leon Bello, Michael Rosenbluh and Avi Peâer, âLiftingÂ theÂ BandwidthÂ limitÂ of Optical Homodyne Measurementâ,Â Nature Comm.Â 9, 609 (2018)"
