Fetzer's Program Verification: The Very Idea (1988) is one of the two most frequently cited position papers on the subject of program verification. The other one is Social Processes and Proofs by De Millo, Lipton, and Perlis (1979), previously discussed on LtU. Fetzer's paper generated a lot of heated discussion, both in the subsequent issues of CACM and on Usenet.\n\nIt's not clear to me what all the fuss is about. Fetzer's main thesis seems pretty uncontroversial:\n\nThe notion of program verification appears to trade upon an equivocation. Algorithms, as logical structures, are appropriate subjects for deductive verification. Programs, as causal models of those structures, are not. The success of program verification as a generally applicable and completely reliable method for guaranteeing program performance is not even a theoretical possibility.\n\n(See also part I, part II, and part III.)\n\nComment viewing options\n\nSelect your preferred way to display the comments and click \"Save settings\" to activate your changes."
