        "text": "uantum computing and quantum information science is a rapidly growing field that has sparked a lot of interest in the world. While the field itself and its applications are yet to be considered as mature, quantum technologies are expected to profoundly impact technology by completely revolutionizing the foundations on which technology as we know it today is built on. In this week's People in Computing ACM Selects, we spotlight key researchers and scientists making meaningful contributions to the development of quantum technologies. We hope that this first ACM Selects on quantum computing will help provide some context on the landscape of quantum technologies and some of the key directions that research in this area is taking.\n\nWe highly encourage learning more about their contributions, and invite you to consider participating in ACMâs activities on these topics, be it through our professional community,â global policyâ activitiesâ, ongoing work in âprofessional ethicsâ, and/or through our âchapters, âSIGsâ, âlocal meetups and/or âconferencesâ.\n\nWe value your feedback and look forward to your guidance on how we can continue to improve ACM Selects together. Your suggestions and opinions on how we can do better are welcome via email through selects-feedback@acm.org.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHow 'Spooky' is Quantum Physics? The Answer could be Incalculable\n\nFirst published in Nature, Vol. 577, 23 January 2020.\n\nMost of us relate quantum physics with science fiction - Albert Einstein himself even dubbed a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics as being âspooky action at a distanceâ. It is an area that is generally perceived as complex, difficult to understand, weird but also cool.Â\n\nâ\n\nTo kick off this round of Selects, we hope that this ACM News article which conveys the complexity, weirdness and excitement behind quantum information science will spark your curiosity and inspire you to explore this area.\n\n[ Read more ]\n\nÂ â...spooky action at a distance.âÂ\n\n- Albert Einsteinâ\n\nPeter Shor\n\nPeter Shor is the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics since 2003, and Chair of the Applied Mathematics Committee at MIT since 2015.

Although nearly 3 decades old, his discovery holds great significance. Given a âlargeâ number of quantum computers in the world, they would have the capability of breaking down the encryption techniques used on the Internet today.\n\n[ Read more ]\n\nâ\n\nWhy haven't more quantum algorithms been found?\n\nFirst published in Journal of the ACM, Vol. 50, No. 1, January 2003.\n\nâNearly a decade after the discovery of Shorâs algorithm, Peter Shor observed that few quantum algorithms had been discovered and set out to find out why. In this paper, he sheds light on possible reasons for this and shares his thoughts on the directions that research at the time could take to yield the discovery of more quantum algorithms.\n\n[ Read more ]\n\nâ\n\nQuantum Computing Pioneer Warns of Complacency over Internet Security\n\nFirst published in Nature, Vol. 587, 12 November 2020.\n\nIn this article, Peter Shor looks back on the moment of the Shorâs algorithmâs discovery and tells the story of the impact and perception that his discovery had on the world of physics and computer science at the time. While reviewing the current stage of development in quantum computing, he pondered the road to a post-quantum world and the potential state of unpreparedness it carries, emphasising the importance of ensuring cybersecurity is maintained to minimize the risk of unpreparedness.\n\n[ Read more ]\n\nElham Kashefi\n\nElham Kashefi is the Professor of Quantum Computing at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, and Directeur de recherche au CNRS at LIP6 Sorbonne Universite. Elham is a pioneer in the field of quantum technology, as the co-founder of the fields of quantum cloud computing and quantum computing verification and as co-Founder of VeriQloud Ltd, through her innovative work in trans-disciplinary interaction of hybrid quantum-classical solutions from theoretical investigation to actual experimental and industrial commercialisation. Previously, she served as the Associate Director of the NQIT Hub before being elected as the lead for the software activities within the quantum computing and simulation hub. For her work in application development for quantum computing and communication, she has been awarded several UK, EU and US grants and fellowships\n\n[ Read their bio ]\n\nCyber security in the quantum era\n\nFirst published in Communications of the ACM, Vol. 62, No. 4, March 2019.\n\nThe advent of quantum computers equally poses threats to and creates opportunities of bolstering cybersecurity and in this Communications of the ACM review article, Elham Kashefi and Petros Wallden debunk some myths associated with the capabilities of quantum computing and share their insights on cybersecurity in a quantum-enhanced world\n\n[ Read more ]\n\nâ\n\nJohn Martinis\n\nJohn Martinis, an alumnus of the University of California, Berkeley, is one of the world's foremost experts on quantum computing.
