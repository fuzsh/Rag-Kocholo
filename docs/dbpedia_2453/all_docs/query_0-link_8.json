        "text": "Around 1989, a striking letter written in March 1956 from Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann came to light. It poses some problems about the complexity of algorithms; in particular, it asks a question that can be seen as the first formulation of the P = ? NP question. This paper discusses some of the background to this letter, including von Neumann&#39;s own ideas on complexity theory. Von Neumann had already raised explicit questions about the complexity of Tarski&#39;s decision procedure for elementary algebra and geometry in a letter of 1949 to J. C. C. McKinsey. The paper concludes with a discussion of why theoretical computer science did not emerge as a separate discipline until the 1960s.\n\nThis article constructs a Turing Machine which can solve for β which is RE-complete. Such a machine is only possible if there is something wrong with the foundations of computer science and mathematics. We therefore check our work by looking very closely at Cantor's diagonalization and construct a novel formal language as an Abelian group which allows us, through equivalence relations, to provide a non-trivial counterexample to Cantor's argument. As if that wasn't enough, we then discover that the impredicative nature of Gödel's diagonalization lemma leads to logical tautology, invalidating any meaning behind the method, leaving no doubt that diagonalization is flawed. Our discovery in regards to these foundational arguments opens the door to solving the P vs NP problem.\n\nG��del's incompleteness results are two of the most fundamental and important contributuions to logic and the foundations of mathematics. G��del showed that no axiomatizable formal system strong enough to capture elementary number theory can prove every true sentence in its language. This theorem is an important limiting result regarding the power of formal axiomatics, but has also been of immense importance in other areas, eg, the theory of computability.\n\nThis article presents the stimulating lectures delivered by the world's most prominent computer scientists upon their receipt of the ACM Turing Award. This collection appeal to everyone interested in the history and development of computer science, and in the perspective and thoughts, which remain relevant today."
