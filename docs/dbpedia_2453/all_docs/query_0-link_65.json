He launched a blog, called Not Even Wrong, two years ago to contest the underpinnings of string theory. It was a hit and has become a lively forum for bickering scientists. You have a Ph.D. in physics. Why did you end up in a math department? W: Well, one reason actually had to do with string theory. After I received my Ph.D. in theoretical physics, it became clear that if you wanted to keep working in theoretical physics, especially in the mathematical end of theoretical physics, you would pretty much have to do string theory. And I really wasn't very interested in that, so I thought the math department would be a better idea. What year was this? W: I got my Ph.D. in '84, which is right around the time the string theory fad started. One effect of it was if you were doing something else involving mathematics and physics, people just don't want to hear about it, they were just not interested. If you started looking for a job, you found out that nobody really wants what you're doing. Why are you so interested in the problems with string theory? W: In the mid-eighties, my reaction to it was it didn't seem that promising to me and there were all these other smart people doing it. I thought, within a couple of years either it will get somewhere, in which case they'll all want to work on it, or it won't go anywhere and they'll give up. It seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing for people to be doing. And as the years went on—and we're now 21 years past this—it became more and more disturbing that this had taken on a very different character than just a few years of people working on a very speculative idea. It had reached this kind of critical mass and totally had taken over the field. I think much of it has really gotten to the point where it's not even a legitimate science anymore. How is it not a legitimate science? W: At this point they really don't even have a plausible idea about how to ever make a prediction out of this, or how to use this in order to really explain anything about the world. So there's an ongoing discussion now almost at the level of philosophy of science: Is this even a science? I think I am not the only one who thinks this has gone past the point where it's not even really a science anymore. And yet they are clearly working with math, which is scientific. How do you describe what they are doing? W: The science writer John Horgan has a nice line about this. He calls it science fiction in mathematical form. They are certainly using mathematics, and they are building models and writing down equations for them, but the models they are working with just aren't connected to the real world. There isn't even any plausible way you could imagine that they are going to be able to connect that to the real world and to use these models to explain some experiment we are seeing. Even string theorists admit that it is not really a theory. What is it? W: The best way to say it is what people have now is really an approximation to a theory. The kinds of equations that they have now are the kinds of equations you would get in an approximation scheme to some underlying theory, but nobody knows what the underlying theory is. What about the positive things that have come out of string theory? W: It has had a very good effect on mathematics. It's gone through several different stages. In the mid-eighties, it went through something called conformal field theory, and some truly great mathematics was done because of that. And more recently there has been a lot of work in what's called topological string theory and this has led to a lot of fantastic mathematics recently, and a bit earlier on there was something called mirror symmetry which give you a completely new information about higher dimensional spaces. So from the point of view of mathematics, it's been a big success. Also, over the last ten years, there has been some very interesting work using string theory to understand the theory of the strong interactions. So if string theory is so useful, what are your issues? W: I think what most bothers me about it, the problem with it, is the way it has driven out other sorts of research. The way in which it has been pursued has made it virtually impossible to work on other things in the field. Why is string theory such a phenomenon? W: One of the big factors is that the field is a victim of its own success. The standard model, which was in place by around 1973, has been absurdly successful. There are literally zero experimental results that disagree with this model. Normally, one thing that has kept physics from becoming overly speculative or going off into the wrong direction is that sooner or later an experimentalist comes along and shows you that that was the wrong direction. That just hasn't happened. Another aspect has to do with Edward Witten, who is the most amazing figure in the field. He legitimately is an incredible genius. And throughout the early eighties he was doing stuff that was ten times more interesting than anyone else in the field. No one had ever seen anyone like him. He got interested in this in 1984, and he was pushing the idea very strongly. So I think it was a combination of by far the most influential person in the field pushing the idea very strongly, combined with the fact that there weren't any other good ideas around, and there wasn't anything from experiments telling us which way to go. By now you have several generations of physicists—this has been going on for more than 20 years—who have spent their whole career doing this. People don't like to give up on something they have their lives invested in and try something else. It's not human nature. Doesn't string theory fit a physics need? W: Certainly the reason people originally got interested in it was that it held out hopes of unifying the standard model in particle physics and general relativity, the theory of gravitation. And I think there are still some people who believe in that promise. The other thing to say about string theory is that nobody really quite knows what it is. It's still a very mysterious business. It really is more of a set of hopes that some things that people already understand are an approximation of some deeper theory, although nobody knows what it is. Why is your blog called Not Even Wrong? W: It's a famous quote from Wolfgang Pauli, a well-known physicist from the earlier part of the century. I certainly wasn't the first one to use it or the first one even to apply it to string theory. Pauli supposedly was asked about some paper, and he just described it as, \"That paper is not even wrong.\" Meaning that it is just so undefined that you can't even tell if it is wrong or not. It's appropriate for string theory. It's so ill-formulated that you really can't tell whether it's wrong or not. Sometimes people use it as a term of abuse, as in, \"That's so stupid, it's not even wrong.\" But it also has an implication that something is not well-defined enough that you can even decide whether it is wrong or not. What inspired you to start a blog? W: Since I'm responsible for the computer system in the department, I'd played a little bit with the software. I thought, I've got a lot of things I want to say and this may be a good forum with which to do this. So I guess it was about a year and a half ago that I started it. I was immediately surprised at how much attention it started getting. Had you felt you were not getting much reaction for earlier articles on this subject? W: I wrote something and initially tried to get Physics Today to publish it, but they wouldn't, and then I put it up on a physics web archive, and I got quite an amazing reaction to it. I probably heard from at least 50 to 100 physicists who said, \"We've always thought this. It's great that someone is saying this.\" And I heard from only 2 or 3 people who said, \"You don't know what you're talking about.\" So there was a huge positive reaction. How many hits do you get on your blog? W: Very quickly it was a few hundred, and then a thousand, then a couple thousand, and now its up to about 5,000 per day. Do you know of people who have changed their mind about what they were pursuing in physics because of your blog? W: People have told me that my blog has had an effect on students who were trying to decide whether to go into string theory or not. Brian Greene, one of the most prominent advocates of string theory, is in your department. How has your high profile as an anti-string theorist affected your relationship? W: We get along fine. He's a very reasonable guy. We disagree about string theory to some extent, but unlike a lot of other string theorists, Brian is certainly someone who is willing to publicly admit that string theory is something that may very well be wrong. Have you influenced each other at all? W: The few times I ever thought there was something to string theory was after hearing Brian talk. He's certainly a very convincing speaker. I haven't talked to him much about it, so I have no idea whether I've succeeded in making him more skeptical about the prospects of string theory or not. This is not something you sit down and talk about? W: No, we haven't discussed it very much at all. It seems people's attitude toward string theory has changed recently. Is that true? W: I think definitely up until last year or so it was very rare to see anything skeptical about string theory. I think within the last year this idea has really gotten out there, has become much more commonplace, that there quite possibly is a problem with all of this. Any idea why the climate has changed? W: Well, one thing is, in string theory itself, things are really not going well. Regularly, every year or two, there would be some new idea they would come out with, so the field was kind of bubbling along. I think what's happened in the last two or three years, there really haven't been any new ideas to try. The other problem is that there's been a split within the string theory community. There are some who have basically decided that whatever this theory is, it has infinitely complex possible solutions [known as the string theory landscape]. As for the dream that there's going to be one solution of string theory and it's going to be the real world, I think a lot of them have given up on that. So they're trying to pursue this idea that string theory really is an infinitely complex thing. I think a lot of other string theorists are well aware that if you go down that road you really can't predict anything and you're in danger of leaving what is normal science. Do you think there was a backlash because string theory was pushed into the public spotlight too early or too hard? W: I think it was certainly oversold. I think if you talk to most string theorists, they actually see themselves as suffering from this overselling of the theory. They're actually not happy that they have to contend with that. Can you compare this time in physics to another time in physics? Is this an exciting time? W: I'm afraid I don't think it is an exciting time. It's a very difficult and challenging time. I think it really is an unparalleled situation in the history of physics. There is this new accelerator that will come online in Geneva at CERN, the LHC, Large Hadron Collider. And there are a lot of good reasons to believe that that accelerator will finally have enough energy to start to get some interesting data. And so I think what's going on among theorists is people are just kind of waiting and hanging in there for a couple of years and hoping that this will really finally return the field to a much healthier state, where there will be new experimental results coming in which will start telling us what direction to go in. So I think when you do hear people saying that this is an exciting time, often what they are referring to is that it's exciting that two or three years from now we're going to finally start getting some new data which will turn things around. How do you respond to critics who say you are unqualified to discuss string theory? W: I have a PhD from Princeton in particle theory and have been thinking about this subject for twenty years. The only criticism of what I've been doing over the years that I would actually agree with is that I should have spent less time thinking about string theory and complaining about it and learning about it just to criticize it, instead of devoting time to more positive things that I should be pursuing. To you, in a perfect world, what would today's field of physics be like? How would you imagine it would be functioning at its best capacity? W: Broadly, I think what the field needs is for people to acknowledge that this particular speculative idea doesn't really work and there aren't any obvious good ideas out there. I think it would actually be healthier for theoretical physics these days to take a look at how mathematicians operate, because mathematics has always been a less faddish subject. In mathematics there is much more of a culture where people spread out and devote their lives to thinking hard about something that interests them. There has always been much more of a culture in physics that you want to work on something where you can get results and produce a paper a few months from now. And when the problems are very hard and no one knows what to do, I think people need to be willing to dig in and spend years thinking about something different than what other people are thinking. And there really isn't the kind of institutional support within the physics community for this kind of behavior, whereas there is in mathematics. I think it would be a lot healthier if physicists would acknowledge that they are in a different situation than we've been in historically because of this lack of experiment, and under the circumstances people do need to behave differently. Is part of it that, often, mathematicians are not searching for a larger meaning? Do you think that because physicists are looking for larger meaning, it's throwing off their objectivity? W: The thing that keeps mathematicians honest is the notion of mathematical rigor and mathematical proof. Mathematicians have this very strong culture where everything you say has to be very precise and you have to be able to rigorously prove it. Whereas physicists have never worried too much about that because even if you are doing something that is logically a bit inconsistent, it doesn't really matter because it is all going to get sorted out by the experiment in the end. I think physicists need to spend a lot more time being clear about exactly what's working and what isn't. We have to think about what really is beautiful -- what really is a powerful, beautiful new idea and what isn't. Do you think physicists have lost the idea of what is beautiful and powerful because they have gotten carried away? W: I see what's happening in the field is that they are getting backed into a corner. They've got this underlying speculative idea that they don't want to give up on. If an idea doesn't work, you can always make it try to work by making it more complicated, so a lot of what is going on is that they're being forced into more complicated and more ugly things, to the extent that some of them are even trying to make a virtue of this. They're saying, well, the world really is this incredibly complicated, ugly, Rube Goldberg kind of place. That's just the way it is.You might also likeDiscover Interview: The Math Behind the Physics Behind the UniverseThe Extremely Long Odds Against the Destruction of EarthNothingness of Space Could Illuminate the Theory of EverythingThe Large Hadron Collider Will Finally Start Smashing in SeptemberTesting String TheoryDiscover Interview: Roger Penrose Says Physics Is Wrong, From String Theory to Quantum MechanicsGravity LeaksPhysicists Are Close to Uncovering the Fundamental Rules of Reality3 Ideas That Are Pushing the Edge of Science\n\n数学\n\n2014-15/0339/en_head.json.gz/14669\n\nSearch this site: Plus Blog Mathematical theatre at the Science Museum: X&Y What is the shape of the Universe? Is it finite or infinite? Does it have an edge? In their new show X&Y Marcus du Sautoy and Victoria Gould use mathematics and the theatre to navigate the known and unknown reaches of our world. Through a series of surreal episodes, X and Y, trapped in a Universe they don't understand and confronted for the first time with another human being, tackle some of the biggest philosophical and scientific questions on the books: where did the Universe come from, does time have an end, is there something on the other side, do we have free will, can we ever prove anything about our Universe for sure or is there always room for another surprise? Marcus and Victoria met while working on A disappearing number, Complicite's multi award-winning play about mathematics. X&Y has developed from that collaboration and pursues many of the questions at the heart of A disappearing number. X&Y is on at the Science Museum in London 10 - 16 October 2013.

If you like the Rubik's cube then you might love the Magic Cube. Rather than having colours on the little square faces it has number on it. So your task is not only to put the large faces together in the right way, but also to figure out what this right way is. Which numbers should occur together on the same face and in what order? Jonathan Kinlay, the inventor of the Magic Cube, has estimated that there are 140 x 1021 different configurations of the Magic Cube. That's 140 followed by 21 zeroes and 3000 more configurations than on an ordinary Rubik's cube. To celebrate the launch of the Magic Cube, Kinlay's company Innovation Factory is running a competition to see who can solve the cube first. To start it off they will be shipping a version the puzzle directly to 100 of the world's leading quantitative experts, a list that includes people at MIT, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. You can join too by nominating yourself (or someone else). Innovation Factory will accept up to 20 nominees (in addition to those that have already been picked). The competition will launch in September and run for 60 days. To nominate someone please send an email to MagicCubeCompetition@IF-Chicago.com, giving the name and email, mailing address of the nominee and a brief explanation of why you think they should be included in the competition. If you don't get accepted, don't worry — the Magic Cube will go on sale after the competition has ended. The winner will receive lots of glory and a metal version of the Magic Cube precision-machined from solid aluminium, and they will be featured on the Innovation Factory website. As a warm-up you can read about the ordinary Rubik's cube on Plus.

Since then, these groups have proliferated both in number and influence to the point they are now major players in the environmental arena. In 1992, representatives of 13,000 NGOs convened in Rio de Janeiro for a UN-sponsored Earth Summit-the largest ever gathering of environmentalists and heads of state. The Summit yielded the Convention on Biological Diversity-an important treaty, ratified by 178 nations, which calls for the assessment and protection of threatened plants and animals. “That conference would not have taken place if NGOs hadn’t pushed for it,” comments William Moomaw, an environmental policy specialist at Tufts University. “Without NGOs”, he adds, “there wouldn’t be a Kyoto Protocol aimed at curbing the release of greenhouse gases. Society needs a voice that’s not always provided by governments or the corporate sector, which is why NGOs have flourished.” Today there are more than 20,000 NGOs. These organizations have become a “third force” on the world stage, taking “their place at the table of business and governments,” according to Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson. When Wilson advised conservation groups in the 1970s, their role was “basically that of beggars and evangelists,” raising awareness about problems in the hopes that someone would follow through. By the 1990s, groups such as the Nature Conservancy and Conservation International had the clout to buy up large tracts of land. Actions by both private organizations and governments have brought about 9 percent of the world’s land mass and 1 percent of its waters under some form of protection. Over the decades, NGOs like the World Wildlife Fund and Natural Resources Defense Council have grown from shoestring operations into empires with a million or more members and multi-million dollar budgets. Along with the change in size has come a different attitude. “People got tired of the gloom and doom approach,” says Bud Ris, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists from 1984 through 2003. “They wanted to hear about solutions.” Getting results today often entails a very different approach. “In the early days, the process was adversarial because that was the only way to get anyone’s attention. But some companies have finally gotten the message,” Moomaw says, leading to unlikely alliances between environmental groups and their former rivals in industry. The Conservation Law Foundation, for example, is now forging partnerships with companies that, a decade ago, they might have sued. Minireviews are written by Steve Nadis, a writer based in Cambridge, Massachusetts who has worked for the Union of Concerned Scientists and the World Resources Institute. His articles have appeared in Nature, Scientific American, the Atlantic Monthly and other magazines. He was a 1997/98 Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT. Protecting the Amazon About one third of the world’s tropical rainforests lie in the Amazon Basin, an ecologically-rich region that is home to more than a fifth of the known plant and animal species. But the Amazon is disappearing fast: About 15 percent of its original forests are gone, and deforestation continues at a frightening clip. Ten thousand square miles of rainforest-more than twice the size of the state of Connecticut-were lost from July 2001 through June 2002, according to a satellite image survey carried out by the Brazilian government. Drastic measures are needed to save this region of unparalleled biological diversity, and the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) initiative, which was launched in September 2002, is aggressively confronting the challenge. Under ARPA, the Brazilian government has pledged to set aside at least 10 percent of its Amazon land within a decade, thereby safeguarding over 190,000 square miles-an area larger than the entire U.S. National Park System. The government asked the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the world’s largest privately-funded conservation group, to help devise the conservation plan. WWF and other participating organizations proposed a plan that included strictly-protected parks and managed reserves where indigenous people will be allowed to hunt, fish and farm on a limited basis. WWF and its partners are now identifying new Amazon regions that should be considered for federal protection. Tumucumaque National Park, which was created in 2003, is the biggest single addition to ARPA. At 15,000 square miles, Tumucumaque is the world’s largest tropical rainforest reserve-six times bigger than the Florida Everglades. No major roads have yet been cut into the pristine forest where jaguars, sloths, harpy eagles and other creatures are thought to roam. Information furnished by local indigenous tribes equipped with Global Positioning System handsets was combined with aerial photos to create the most detailed map of an Amazon region ever produced. Later in 2003, the 2,600 square mile Chandless State Park, which provides habitat for rare spider monkeys and endangered species such as the jaguar and Goeldi’s tamarin, was added to ARPA. Within a half year of the project's inauguration, more than 20,000 square miles of Brazilian land came under protection. Advocates of the initiative hope momentum is gathering. “Nothing like ARPA has ever been attempted before,” says WWF vice president Guillermo Castilleja. “WWF, together with the other partners in this program, share a vision to make ARPA the most successful large-scale forest conservation effort in history.” NGO Minireviews are written by Steve Nadis, a writer based in Cambridge, Massachusetts who has worked for the Union of Concerned Scientists and the World Resources Institute.

Protecting the Cardamoms For decades, the Cardamom Mountains in southwestern Cambodia remained off limits to most people. The dense forested mountains-scented with the sweet spice for which they’re named-had been the last stronghold of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime. Ironically, the presence of the armed guerillas, along with the minefields and booby traps they laid, helped make the Cardamoms a largely untouched wilderness area. The Khmer Rouge movement collapsed in the late 1990s, leaving its mountain sanctuary up for grabs. The cash-poor Cambodian government sold five logging concessions to timber companies for parcels in the central mountains. Several roads had been cut into the heart of the range, paving the way for farmers, hunters, and settlers. That’s when Conservation International (CI) stepped in. The Washington-based conservation giant, which is helping to protect more than 100 million acres worldwide, helped finance a Cardamom wildlife survey in 2000 conducted by Flora and Fauna International, a British NGO. The survey confirmed ecologists’ suspicions that the region is a biological treasure trove. Covering just six percent of Cambodia, the Cardamoms are home to most of the country’s large mammals and also shelter about half of its birds, reptiles and amphibians. Threatened species found there include the Indochinese tiger, the Asian elephant, the Malaysian sun bear, the pileated gibbon and the Siamese crocodile. Even rarer species such as the Javan rhinoceros and the khiting vor-a bizarre half-sheep, half-antelope creature thought to exist though never seen before-are rumored to inhabit the mountain slopes. Convinced of the area’s importance, CI struck a deal with the Cambodian government in 2001 that prohibited logging in the mountains while their permanent status was being determined. A year later, Cambodia announced the creation of a million-acre protected forest in the central Cardamoms. The new park abuts two existing sanctuaries, adding up to a combined preserve of 2.44 million acres. It is the largest and most pristine wildlife refuges in the Southeast Asia mainland, covering nearly one-fourth of the total mountain range. CI’s work is not yet done. It now hopes to expand conservation corridors that would link the Cardamoms with the coast, thereby securing key elephant habitats. CI is also paying 50 forest rangers, at a cost of about $250,000 per year, to patrol the park and prevent poaching and illegal logging. The organization knows from experience that creating a wilderness preserve is just the first step; a continued presence is required to make it last. Room to Roam: Yellowstone To Yukon National Parks, even spacious ones like Yellowstone Park (the largest in the United States), are not big enough to accommodate predators like grizzly bears and wolves. Radio-collar tracking studies have shown that a single wolf can rove over a 60,000 square mile area. Other research indicates that the 400 or so grizzly bears thought to occupy Yellowstone need an area 10 times bigger than the park’s confines to thrive. Roads and other obstacles further limit the bears’ range. Small, isolated populations can become inbred; the loss of genetic hardiness brings a greater susceptibility to disease and famine. A new breed of conservationist believes the traditional “patchwork” approach of cordoning off scattered wildlife enclaves is far from optimal. “Little island parks,” claims Canadian environmental lawyer Harvey Locke, can become “islands of extinction.” A decade ago, Locke and other conservationists conceived of the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) plan for creating a continuous, 2,000 mile seam of protected or otherwise managed land, half a million square miles in all, that stretches from Yellowstone to the Yukon Territories. This “bright green thread” championed by Y2Y proponents will tie wilderness areas together by means of wildlife corridors at least 30 miles wide. Y2Y spokesperson Jeff Gailus calls the effort “the biggest, boldest conservation initiative in history.” He and his colleagues are taking a long-term perspective, thinking in terms of a 50- to 100-year process. In the meantime, they’re trying to encourage the U.S. and Canadian governments-as well as environmental groups, big and small-to preserve additional land or, failing that, to make sure land management practices conform to the needs of wildlife. It’s an ambitious task, admits Gailus, “but we’re not starting from scratch.” The Y2Y plan incorporates 11 existing national parks, along with dozens of other parks and protected areas. And the team is steadily expanding the base: The government of British Columbia recently protected 24,000 square miles in the northeastern section of the province as part of an agreement with native Americans, wildlife advocates and industry representatives. In a similar arrangement, Canada has begun to protect nearly 40,000 square miles in the Mackenzie Valley. Meanwhile, conservationists are trying to establish wildlife-friendly links between the Glacier-Waterton National Park complex and Banff and Jasper to the north. With a staff of just 10 people operating out of offices in Canmore, Alberta and Missoula, Montana, the Y2Y organization cannot begin to manage the vast sweep of land under consideration. The success of Y2Y rests instead on collaborations with 180 other participating groups. “People aren’t working alone anymore to protect their own river, mountain, or valley,” says Gailus. “We’re all working together toward a greater vision, which makes it even more rewarding.” The Last Great Places: The Nature Conservancy Palmyra Atoll-a string of islands in the center of the Pacific, 1,000 miles south of Hawaii-had, by some miracle, emerged from the 20th century virtually intact, without being ruined, or colonized by humans. Still, plans were afoot to “develop” this tropical paradise, a U.S. territory. One proposal called for building a resort and casino; another scenario envisioned a spent nuclear fuel repository. The Nature Conservancy (TNC), unenthused about either prospect, came up with a simple strategy for saving Palmyra. In November 2000, they bought the whole package-680 acres of land and 15,500 acres of coral reefs and lagoons-for $30 million. Some might consider that an unusual approach to conservation, but it’s standard practice for TNC, which has already protected more than 116 million acres of land and waters worldwide. As part of the largest private conservation campaign ever initiated, the group has recently pledged to spend $1 billion to save 200 of the “Last Great Places on Earth,” Palmyra being one of them. In 2001, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established the Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge to protect the atoll and its surrounding waters. Palmyra was a coveted addition to the national refuge system because it contains one of the last undeveloped atolls in the entire Pacific and some of the most spectacular corals found anywhere, as well as hosting diverse marine species. More than 130 different hard corals grow there-three times more species than are found in the Caribbean Sea or in all the Hawaiian Islands put together. The islands also provide a habitat for more than one million nesting seabirds-their only sanctuary within 450,000 square miles of ocean. Palmyra supports one of the world’s largest colonies of red-footed boobies, second only to the Galapagos Islands. Migratory birds, such as the bristle-thighed curlew, make their first rest stop there while passing through from Alaska. Seabirds are by no means the only visitors to Palmyra. Pilot whales, bottled-nosed dolphins, tiger sharks, manta rays, sea turtles, giant clams, parrot fish, lumphead wrasses and groupers are also well represented. Through its purchase, TNC is trying to ensure that the atoll remains a wildlife haven for the indefinite future. In so doing, various commercial plans for the site, including the construction of an offshore bank, manufacturing center, fish processing plant, and missile launch site have been thwarted. Although TNC is in favor of progress, they believe that sometimes means keeping things the way they are. Call for Calm in the Seas: Natural Resources Defense Council In the past half-century, the oceans have become at least 10 times noisier due to the growing din from shipping, mining, drilling, military sonar systems and other human activities. The problem of underwater noise pollution is not widely known to terrestrial creatures like humans. But to ocean denizens such as whales and dolphins-who rely on sound to communicate with one another, navigate, avoid peril and find food-a vastly noisier world would be hard to ignore. Marine mammals certainly have their champions in environmental circles to the extent that the “save the whales” rallying cry has long been a cliche. But on the noise pollution front, the Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), has taken the lead. NRDC’s efforts in this area are largely due to the initiative of one man, senior attorney Joel Reynolds. In 1994, Reynolds heard about clandestine experiments the U.S. Navy was conducting off the California coast. After questioning military officials and scientists, and wading through volumes of documents during a nine-month investigation, Reynolds learned about a Navy technique for detecting enemy submarines through the use of “low-frequency active” (LFA) sonar. The Navy had tested the technology repeatedly without studying how it affected marine life, despite its own calculations showing the sonar emitted sound levels of 140 decibels-comparable to a space-shuttle launch-300 miles from the source. The Navy also failed to obtain permits mandated by the Marine Mammal Protection and Endangered Species Acts. In response to pressure from Reynolds, the Navy agreed to study the effects of LFA on marine life. The agency later admitted that one of its mid-frequency sonar systems contributed to the March 2000 deaths of at least eight Cuvier’s beaked whales that had beached themselves in the Bahamas. Reynolds and NRDC won a major lawsuit in October 2003, when a federal court ruled that the Navy could only test its LFA system in a limited area of the North Pacific, with additional restrictions imposed to protect migratory species. But the battle is far from over. The Navy has appealed its loss-a move NRDC has vowed to fight. The successful lawsuit is only a first step, Reynolds explains, as it only applies to the U.S. Navy-not to other countries who are developing similar systems-and only pertains to low-frequency sonar. Since the problem of undersea noise is international in scope, NRDC has recently launched an international program to combat it-a measure that may offer some relief to whales and dolphins whose movements are not constrained by political boundaries. Protecting Fisheries: Conservation Law Foundation The waters off New England once teemed with millions of cod-a term that encompasses 10 families and more than 200 species of fish worldwide. The abundance of cod lured Pilgrims to New England in the early 1600s and kept those settlers from starving, helping to convert the region into an economic powerhouse. For centuries, the sea’s bounty appeared limitless, but all that changed in the last century with the advent of technology that enabled people to remove fish from the seas faster than they could reproduce. By the 1990s, populations of cod, haddock, flounder and other “groundfish” dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded, signaling the collapse of famed fisheries in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. A Boston-based advocacy group, Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), is working to mitigate this environmental disaster. CLF, a group founded by lawyers, is not afraid to use the arm of the law to achieve its ends. The organization began investigating the state of fisheries in the late 1980s in response to pleas from fishermen for help in stemming the decline in fish stocks. CLF filed a lawsuit in 1991 after concluding that a management plan endorsed by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) did little to address overfishing. The settlement led to a more stringent policy and the unprecedented closures of fisheries. In 2000, CLF was the lead agency in another suit against NMFS for failing to prevent overfishing and for sanctioning inadequate fishery rebuilding plans. Two fishing groups intervened on behalf of the conservation coalition. CLF scored a big victory, as did the cause of marine conservation, when the federal court ruled in its favor a year later. CLF is now waiting to see whether NMFS’s new management plan complies with the Sustainable Fisheries Act. “If the right plan is approved, the outlook is very good for many, though not all, groundfish species,” says Priscilla Brooks, who heads CLF’s Marine Resources Project. Populations of haddock and yellowtail flounder have almost fully rebounded, although cod stocks remain low as overfishing persists. “Our goal is to reduce pressure on cod and hope it responds positively,” says Brooks. “Once we can get stocks to come back up, the trick then will be to establish sustainable fishing practices so we don’t drive them back down again.” Her group vows to closely monitor the status of overtaxed groundfish, which constitute a New England treasure. CLF realizes that vigilance alone will not save the day, but without a watchful eye, we may soon bid farewell to cod and other prized species. An Urban Success Story: Charles River Watershed Association Once regarded as a glorified sewer separating Boston from Cambridge, the Charles River is on the mend. According to the Charles River Watershed Association (CRWA), which monitors the river daily, the waterway is clean enough for swimming, except after heavy downpours when some sewage seeps in through storm drains. Within a few years, the Charles could be “fishable and swimmable” every summer day, regardless of storms-at which point the river of “Dirty Water” fame will become a thing of the past. “This is an urban success story,” claims Kari Dolan, a researcher with the National Wildlife Federation. Much of the credit for this remarkable turnaround goes to CRWA, one of the nation’s first watershed organizations, which was formed in 1965 to address concerns over the river’s declining state. In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave the river a “D” for water quality, but since 1998, the Charles has received “B’s”-largely because CRWA has identified pollution sources by measuring bacteria and chemical toxins at various sites, while the EPA has shut down those sources. It has been a fruitful partnership, with CRWA providing the research that guides the cleanup process and EPA supplying the enforcement muscle. Although the Charles has come a long way, there’s still much to be done. Going from a “B” to an “A” in EPA ratings will be harder than going from “D” to “B”, mainly due to all the contaminants lodged in river sediments. Removing them would require dredging-a costly job. For CRWA, the cleanup itself is just half the story. The group is equally focused on preserving the river flow through strategies that keep rainwater in the Charles River watershed, a 300-square-mile basin, rather than discharging it through sewers into Boston Harbor. Their agenda goes beyond fishing and swimming, setting the broader goal of restoring the watershed through innovative water conservation and recovery techniques. CRWA’s efforts are clearly paying off. There are other measures of success than EPA report cards, one being the increased presence of blue herons, osprey, marsh hawks, turtles and other forms of wildlife along the river and its banks. “The Charles was written off for 50 years, but most Bostonians don’t write it off anymore,” says the group’s executive director Robert Zimmerman. “It’s important to put nature on display in urban areas so people realize the environment is not confined to places like Yellowstone.” Restoring Wetlands: The Wetlands Institute, The Trustees of Reservations Since the 1800s, the 273-mile-long Illinois River has been dammed, channelized and otherwise transformed, serving at various times as a canal between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes, as well as a sewer for Chicago. To redress more than a century of abuse, The Wetlands Initiative (TWI), a Chicago-based non-profit group, recently began restoring 2,600 acres of Illinois River floodplain near Hennepin, Illinois-the first step in TWI's plan to revive broad stretches of wetlands alongside the river and its tributaries. If TWI realizes its goals, the project will be the largest wetlands restoration in the history of Illinois, a state that has already lost 90 percent of its wetlands. Work at Hennepin got started in 2001 after TWI purchased the floodplain site that once supported two lakes (Hennepin and Hopper) as well as wetland, prairie and fen communities. Since the 1920s, however, the land had been pumped dry to permit corn and soybean cultivation. TWI turned off the pumps, allowing precipitation and groundwater to refill the lake beds. In response, the adjacent wetlands and marshes quickly sprang back to life. Frogs, birds and plants returned after nearly a century’s absence. The sounds of Western chorus frogs, American toads and spring peepers were also heard. Muskrats and beavers began reshaping the landscape, and state-threatened bird species, such as the pied-bill grebe and black tern, magically appeared. Meanwhile, a more modest effort is underway in Hingham, Massachusetts to resuscitate a 15-acre salt marsh that spans a narrow peninsula called World’s End. It’s not a big undertaking as restoration ventures go, but salt marshes are endangered ecosystems, and every marsh that can be revived can yield environmental benefits. The Trustees of Reservations (TTOR), the non-profit land conservation organization which owns the land, hope to inspire similar projects along the East Coast. A once-thriving salt marsh was drained for agriculture in the early 1600s by the first European settlers, who installed two dikes to keep saltwater out of the area. In 2003, TTOR took steps to reverse some of the centuries-long damage inflicted by humans. The first priority, restoring tidal flows into and out of the former marsh, was accomplished by installing four-foot by eight-foot concrete culverts in the middle of each dike. Since then, dense stands of phragmites, an invasive reed, have retreated, making way for native salt marsh grasses. A popular destination for hikers and picnickers, World’s End now offers unique opportunities for witnessing a wetland restoration in progress, says TTOR ecologist Andy Walsh. “People can come here to see a coastal zone in transition-a salt marsh coming back to life.” Defending Bats and Insects: Bat Conservation International, Xerces Society In 1992, a spelunker named Steve Smith searched for artifacts in an abandoned mine in Iron Mountain, Michigan, just before the mine was scheduled to be sealed from the public for good. Instead of uncovering artifacts, Smith found thousands of bats and realized they would soon be entombed. Smith alerted Bat Conservation International (BCI) in Austin, Texas. Merlin Tuttle, who started the group in 1982, immediately flew to Michigan where he saw signs of a million brown bats hibernating in the mine. Tuttle persuaded officials from the town and mining company to jettison their plans for covering the mine’s entrances with backfill. Instead, steel gates-with bars spaced widely enough to let bats fly through, while keeping people out-were installed at the entrances. That decision saved a million bats from certain death and protected their home, prompting BCI to look at other mines throughout the country. In 1993, BCI and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management started the North American Bats and Mines Project to prevent the loss of bats due to the closure of abandoned mines. The program is important because more than half of North America’s 46 bat species find sanctuary in mines, after having been driven from traditional roosts in caves and forests. Nearly 2,000 bat-friendly gates have been installed to date, at a cost of roughly $5,000 apiece. BCI has been successful in getting mining companies to share the expenses. The Xerces Society, like BCI, is focused on preserving noncharismatic creatures like insects. “We’re equal opportunity, so long as it doesn’t have a backbone,” says the group’s executive director Scott Hoffman Black. Xerces petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service a few years ago when it learned that fewer than 200 butterflies called Carson wandering skippers were left in this country, confined to two sites in California and Nevada. In 2000, the agency protected the skipper under the Endangered Species Act, which provided a legal mandate for preserving its habitat. Xerces, which has a staff of just six, is now trying to save an orange, black, and white checkered butterfly called the Taylor’s checkerspot, whose prairie habitat in the Pacific Northwest has shrunk by more than 99 percent and whose population now numbers in the hundreds. The group is conducting surveys to see where the butterfly lives, while also working with land trusts-the Nature Conservancy as well as smaller, local organizations-to safeguard critical sites. “It’s a combination of advocacy, land management, and science,” says Xerces staffer Matthew Shepherd, “wrapped up in one small butterfly with a two-inch wingspan.” NEB Nature Conservancy: Trees, Water & People Trees, Water & People (TWP) is dedicated to improving people’s lives by helping communities to protect, conserve and manage the natural resources upon which their long-term well being depends. To that end, TWP has developed ongoing watershed protection, sustainable agriculture, reforestation and appropriate technology programs in cooperation with communities throughout Central America. Throughout Central America, native forests are being felled at an alarming rate. If current deforestation trends are not slowed, many scientists agree that the region could be completely void of native forests in the next century. Such massive deforestation causes severe soil erosion, water degradation, loss of wildlife habitat and therefore precious biodiversity. While it is essential to protect natural resources and prevent deforestation, the forest is a resource essential to the survival of human populations. Millions of families throughout Central America rely on forests and land to provide fuel to cook meals, wood to build homes, water to drink and space to live and grow crops. Programs designed to help these communities meet their current needs without endangering long-term ecosystem health are essential. Since establishment in 1998, Trees, Water & People has helped hundreds of low-income communities to balance the needs of human populations with the long-term health of the ecosystem that supports them. In less than six years, TWP and community volunteers have planted nearly 1,000,000 trees, helping to prevent soil erosion, protect native forests and ensure the future of regional biodiversity. TWP staff and local volunteers have also provided sustainable agriculture and watershed protection training to more than 50,000 community members. Finally, in order to compliment their reforestation and watershed protection programs, TWP also works with families to introduce improved cooking stoves that reduce the demand for fuel wood by approximately 70%. These stoves are a huge improvement over traditional open fire cooking stoves still used by most of Central America’s rural population. Not only do they save forests and the life they support, but by removing all smoke from the home via a chimney, they protect families from life-endangering respiratory ailments caused by indoor air pollution.

The river basin has been used by various cultures for thousands of years.Some archaeologists believe Paria Canyon was inhabited for at least 10,000 years before the first Europeans arrived in the 1770s. The nature of its geography probably made Paria Canyon a travel route between what is now southern Utah and northern Arizona.From about A.D. 200 to A.D. 1200, the Anasazi occupied the region and may have had small farms and granaries in some stretches of the canyon. Paiute people later occupied and traversed much of the area 600 years before the first Europeans entered the mouth of the canyon. The word \"Paria\" is Paiute, and may mean water that tastes salty.Most archaeological sites located in Paria Canyon are petroglyphs or rock art sites. Petroglyphs are images or symbols carved, incised, or pecked into the rocks while pictographs are painted on the rock. No habitations or large villages have been found in the canyon, leading researchers to conclude that the canyon was primarily used as a travel route in prehistoric times.More Recent ResidentsTwo missionaries, Fathers Dominguez and Escalante, were the first documented European visitors in the region in 1776. They attempted to establish a route from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Monterey, California. On their return route to Santa Fe, after failing to reach California, the expedition camped several days at the mouth of Paria Canyon, which would become the site of Lees Ferry 100 years later. They succeeded in exiting the canyon through what is now Dominguez Pass, which is located high on the northeast rim of the lower canyon.

Lees Ferry was established in 1871 by John D. Lee, who was the first settler and operator of the ferry. Lee's diary mentioned how rugged Paria Canyon was in the late 1800s. Crampton and Rusho write that Lee, during his eight-day trip through Paria Canyon, struggled for two days and one night without stopping because a safe place to camp out of flash flood danger could not be found.\"We concluded to drive down the creek (Paria), which took us some eight days of toil, fatigue, and labour through brush, water, ice, and quicksand -- without seeing the sun for 48 hours.\"John D. LeeUtah State Historical SocietyIn 1870, the small settlement of Pahreah, which was located northwest of the modern-day Paria Contact Station, included 47 families, a church and a post office. This frontier settlement, like many in the West, was frequented by Native Americans, pioneers and the occasional outlaw. John Wesley Powell, the first director of the United States Geological Survey, in surveying the region, used the spelling Paria, which is the name found on modern topographical maps.Jacob Hamblin, envoy for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, reported his observations about Pahreah on March 27, 1870.\"The settlement was progressing with a guardhouse and a small corral, where men can cook and lodge safely with 20-25 horses.\" (Feduska 6)Pahreah TownsiteUtah State Historical SocietyBy that time, Pahreah also had vegetable farms, fruit and nut orchards, and cattle.Unfortunately, severe flooding during the 1880s brought alkaline soil and entrenched arroyos and by 1889, only eight families remained at the settlement. By the 1930s the town of Pahreah had vanished. Near the abandoned settlement, now a ghost town being slowly swept away by the river, a western movie set was built. Here famous characters like Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and others came to life. Zane Grey, a famous western writer during the 1920s, had some of his novels filmed in the area, including Revelation, Heritage of the Desert, and A Biography of Buffalo Jones. Today, the ghost town and movie set can be visited by traveling 30-miles east from Kanab along U.S. Highway 89.The Arizona Strip, a portion of Arizona geographically isolated from the rest of the state by the Colorado River, has always been a difficult area to access.According to Crampton and Rusho (1992), Zane Grey described Paria Creek in 1907 thus:\"Dawn opened my eyes to what seemed the strangest and most wonderful place in the world. Paria Creek watered this secluded and desert bound spot.\"Zane GreyJane FosterCrampton and Rusho (1992) also wrote that south of Paria Canyon in House Rock Valley, two men named Uncle Jim Owens and Buffalo Jones, established a Buffalo Ranch in the early 1900s.\"The original intent of the ranch was to produce hybrid offspring from buffalo and cattle called cattalo.\"AZ Game & Fish DepartmentThe attempt failed, but today the buffalo herd is managed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department. The Buffalo Ranch is 22-miles south of U.S. Highway 89A, and can be reached by USFS Road 8910.Water DevelopmentWater is the essence of life in the West. According to James J. Ligner of the U. S. Geological Survey, the gaging station on the Colorado River at the mouth of the Paria River is:\"The most important station in the United States.\" (Reilly, 1997).This remote gaging station was important in the development of the Colorado River Compact of 1922, an agreement among western states to divide the Colorado River into an upper basin, which is located north of its confluence with the Paria River, and a lower basin south of the confluence. The compact allocates the water from the Colorado River to individual states. Vermilion Cliffs National Monument Monument Manager: Kevin Wright345 E.

This book celebrates the top twenty technological advances of the twentieth century that fundamentally changed society. These advances have influenced where and how we live, what we eat, what we do for work or leisure, and even how we think about our world and the universe. Mathematics has played a major role in bringing these innovations to reality. Many mathematical theories and models of real world problems have helped scientists and engineers grapple with seemingly impossible tasks. Today, mathematical techniques reach even further into our society. In addition to making technology more efficient and effective, mathematical techniques help organizations deal with financial, manufacturing, and even marketing issues. This poster is a tribute to the National Academy of Engineering as well as the men and women who have focused their brilliance to transform the modern world. The poster is a mosaic of the ways mathematics helps us utilize and benefit from these great technological achievements. Some achievements will be familiar. Some will be a surprise.

If you like the Rubik's cube then you might love the Magic Cube. Rather than having colours on the little square faces it has number on it. So your task is not only to put the large faces together in the right way, but also to figure out what this right way is. Which numbers should occur together on the same face and in what order? Jonathan Kinlay, the inventor of the Magic Cube, has estimated that there are 140 x 1021 different configurations of the Magic Cube. That's 140 followed by 21 zeroes and 3000 more configurations than on an ordinary Rubik's cube. To celebrate the launch of the Magic Cube, Kinlay's company Innovation Factory is running a competition to see who can solve the cube first. To start it off they will be shipping a version the puzzle directly to 100 of the world's leading quantitative experts, a list that includes people at MIT, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. You can join too by nominating yourself (or someone else). Innovation Factory will accept up to 20 nominees (in addition to those that have already been picked). The competition will launch in September and run for 60 days. To nominate someone please send an email to MagicCubeCompetition@IF-Chicago.com, giving the name and email, mailing address of the nominee and a brief explanation of why you think they should be included in the competition. If you don't get accepted, don't worry — the Magic Cube will go on sale after the competition has ended. The winner will receive lots of glory and a metal version of the Magic Cube precision-machined from solid aluminium, and they will be featured on the Innovation Factory website.

The mixed factorial design is, in fact, a combination of these two. It is a factorial design that includes both between and within subjects variables. One special type of mixed design, that is particularly common and powerful, is the pre-post-control design. This is a design in which all subjects are given a pre-test and a post-test, and these two together serve as a within-subjects factor (test). Participants are also divided into two groups. One group is the focus of the experiment (i.e., experimental group) and one group is a base line (i.e., control) group. So, for example, if we are interested in examining the effects of a new type of cognitive therapy on depression, we would give a depression pre-test to a group of persons diagnosed as clinically depressed and randomly assign them into two groups (traditional and cognitive therapy). After the patients were treated according to their assigned condition for some period of time, lets say a month, they would be given a measure of depression again (post-test). This design would consist of one within subject variable (test), with two levels (pre and post), and one between subjects variable (therapy), with two levels (traditional and cognitive) (Figure 1). Pre-Test Post-Test Cognitive Therapy Cognitive Pre Cognitive Post Traditional Therapy Traditional Pre Traditional Post Figure 1. Example of Pre-Post-Control Design When a researchers uses the pre-post-control design he or she is usually looking for an interaction such that one cell in particular stands out, and that is the experimental groups post test score. Ideally the pre-test scores will be equivalent. It is the post-test score difference between the experimental and control group that is important (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Hypothetical Means for Experiment in Figure 1 Therefore, in terms of post-hoc tests the most important comparison is between the post-test mean for the experimental group and the post-test mean for the control group (see Figure 3). Figure 3. Comparison of Post-Test Means Also, it is typical for the experimenter to expect a change in the experimental group from pre to post, but not in the control group, which would make the important post-hoc comparisons between pre- and post-test for the experimental groups and between pre- and post-test for the control group (see Figure 4). Figure 4. Comparison of Pre vs. Post Test Means for Both Groups Of course, the pre-post-control design is not the only type of mixed design. Another common type of mixed design (and within-subjects design in general) is one that includes a change over time, so that one independent variable consists of multiple measures of one group of people over time. So, for example, we might be interested in comparing the interest of males vs. females in math and science over some time period during development. More specifically, we could give a group of school children a measure of interest in math and science at age 10 and then give the same group of students the same measure of interest at age 18. Our design then would look like Figure 5, and one set of possible means would look like the means in Figure 6, which would represent an interaction. Age 10 Age 18 Males Males-Age 10 Males-Age 18 Females Females-Age 10 Females-Age 18 Figure 5. Mixed Design with Time as a Within-Subjects Factor Figure 6. Hypothetical Means for the Experiment in Figure 5 The two-way mixed analysis of variance is the most complex type of design/analysis that is covered in the PsychConnections.com modules. The VirtualStatistician and experimental psych modules cover the inferential tests listed below. Although, of course, there are many more types of statistical tests, there are an amazing number of experiments, both within psychological and biological sciences that you can answer with the designs/analyses listed below. Of course, there are many variations, since the examples in the modules are limited to two levels of the independent variables and two independent variables, but adding levels and independent variables is just a slight extension of what is covered. There are also cases in which there are no continuous variables, in which case you would often use a \"non-parametric\" technique, and complex modeling of many continuous variables which would require \"multivariate\" analyses. However, in cases where an experimenter uses a traditional method, in which groups are formed and variables are manipulated the designs and analyses covered in these modules will often work fine. Further, these more complex types of data analyses such as multivariate techniques are extensions of the basic \"univariate\" techniques coverd in the modules, so that this knowledge can serve as an important and necessary foundation for the understanding of these techniques.

Informally, we may suppose that we're tracking the position of a car on a two-lane road with no passing lanes. Assuming the car never pulls off the road, we can abstractly study the car's position by assigning it a variable, . Since the car's position changes as the time changes, we say that is dependent on time, or . This tells where the car is at each specific time. Differentiation gives us a function which represents the car's speed, that is the rate of change of its position with respect to time. Equivalently, differentiation gives us the slope at any point of the graph of a non-linear function. For a linear function, of form , is the slope. For non-linear functions, such as , the slope can depend on ; differentiation gives us a function which represents this slope. The Definition of Slope[edit] Historically, the primary motivation for the study of differentiation was the tangent line problem: for a given curve, find the slope of the straight line that is tangent to the curve at a given point. The word tangent comes from the Latin word tangens, which means touching. Thus, to solve the tangent line problem, we need to find the slope of a line that is \"touching\" a given curve at a given point, or, in modern language, that has the same slope. But what exactly do we mean by \"slope\" for a curve? The solution is obvious in some cases: for example, a line is its own tangent; the slope at any point is . For the parabola , the slope at the point is ; the tangent line is horizontal. But how can you find the slope of, say, at ? This is in general a nontrivial question, but first we will deal carefully with the slope of lines. Of a line[edit] Three lines with different slopes The slope of a line, also called the gradient of the line, is a measure of its inclination. A line that is horizontal has slope 0, a line from the bottom left to the top right has a positive slope and a line from the top left to the bottom right has a negative slope. The slope can be defined in two (equivalent) ways. The first way is to express it as how much the line climbs for a given motion horizontally. We denote a change in a quantity using the symbol (pronounced \"delta\"). Thus, a change in is written as . We can therefore write this definition of slope as: An example may make this definition clearer. If we have two points on a line, and , the change in from to is given by: Likewise, the change in from to is given by: This leads to the very important result below. The slope of the line between the points and is Alternatively, we can define slope trigonometrically, using the tangent function: where is the angle from the rightward-pointing horizontal to the line, measured counter-clockwise. If you recall that the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate on the unit circle, you should be able to spot the equivalence here. Of a graph of a function[edit] The graphs of most functions we are interested in are not straight lines (although they can be), but rather curves. We cannot define the slope of a curve in the same way as we can for a line. In order for us to understand how to find the slope of a curve at a point, we will first have to cover the idea of tangency. Intuitively, a tangent is a line which just touches a curve at a point, such that the angle between them at that point is zero. Consider the following four curves and lines:\n\n数学\n\n2014-15/0340/en_head.json.gz/10117\n\nSearch this site: Plus Blog News from the world of maths: The mathematics of monopoly on More or less The mathematics of monopoly on More or less More or Less, BBC Radio 4's program that takes you on a journey through the often abused but ever ubiquitous world of numbers, has recently returned to the airways, and next Monday (17th December 4.30 pm), regular Plus contributors Rob Eastaway and John Haigh are featuring on the program discussing the maths of Monopoly.

News from the world of maths: Christopher Zeeman Medal for Maths Communication Christopher Zeeman Medal for Maths Communication The Christopher Zeeman Medal, the first award dedicated to recognising excellence in the communication of mathematics has been launched by the London Mathematical Society (LMS) and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA). The LMS and IMA want to honour mathematicians who have excelled in promoting mathematics and engaging with the general public. They may be academic mathematicians based in universities, mathematics school teachers, industrial mathematicians, those working in the financial sector or indeed mathematicians from any number of other fields. Most importantly, these mathematicians will have worked exceptionally to bring mathematics to a non-specialist audience. Whether it is through giving public lectures, writing books, appearing on radio or television, organising events or through an entirely separate medium, the LMS and IMA want to celebrate the achievements of mathematicians who work to inspire others. In a joint statement, the presidents of the LMS and IMA said, \"We are delighted to be able to show how much we need and value mathematicians who can promote their subject successfully. This role is vital to inspiring the next generation of mathematicians as well as helping the wider public to enjoy mathematics.\" The award is named after Professor Sir Christopher Zeeman, FRS, whose notable career was pioneering not only in his fields of topology and catastrophe theory, but who was also ground-breaking in bringing his beloved mathematics to the wider public. Sir Christopher was the first mathematician to be asked to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in 1978, a full 160 years since they began. His \"Mathematics into pictures\" lectures, have been cited by many young UK mathematicians as their inspiration. They also led to the creation of the Ri's Mathematics Masterclasses, weekly lectures delivered to schoolchildren across the UK via a network of 50 centres. Sir Christopher's skill as a communicator has been recognised in the wider community. In 1988, he was the third recipient of the Royal Society's Faraday Prize, awarded annually to a scientist or engineer who has excelled in communicating science to public audiences. His award was made \"for the contributions he has made to the popularization of mathematics\". On the announcement of the medal, Sir Christopher said, \"I am extremely honoured to have such an important award bear my name. I hope this medal will encourage more mathematicians to see communicating their work to the wider public as a key part of their role.\" Nominations for the medal are now invited. To receive a nomination form, please contact: The Secretary to the Christopher Zeeman Medal London Mathematical Society De Morgan House 57-58 Russell Square London WC1B 4HS Or email prizes@lms.ac.uk. Forms should be returned by February 2008. posted by Plus @ 2:39 PM\n\n数学\n\n2014-15/0340/en_head.json.gz/10345\n\nAbstract linear spaces Algebra index History Topics Index Cartesian geometry, introduced by Fermat and Descartes around 1636, had a very large influence on mathematics bringing algebraic methods into geometry. By the middle of the 19th Century however there was some dissatisfaction with these coordinate methods and people began to search for direct methods, i.e. methods of synthetic geometry which were coordinate free. It is possible however to trace the beginning of the vector concept back to the beginning of the 19th Century with the work of Bolzano. In 1804 he published a work on the foundations of elementary geometry Betrachtungen über einige Gegenstände der Elementargoemetrie. Bolzano, in this book, considers points, lines and planes as undefined elements and defines operations on them. This is an important step in the axiomatisation of geometry and an early move towards the necessary abstraction for the concept of a linear space to arise. The move away from coordinate geometry was mainly due to the work of Poncelet and Chasles who were the founders of synthetic geometry. The parallel development in analysis was to move from spaces of concrete objects such as sequence spaces towards abstract linear spaces. Instead of substitutions defined by matrices, abstract linear operators must be defined on abstract linear spaces. In 1827 Möbius published Der barycentrische Calcul a geometrical book which studies transformations of lines and conics. The novel feature of this work is the introduction of barycentric coordinates. Given any triangle ABC then if weights a, b and c are placed at A, B and C respectively then a point P, the centre of gravity, is determined. Möbius showed that every point P in the plane is determined by the homogeneous coordinates [a,b,c], the weights required to be placed at A, B and C to give the centre of gravity at P. The importance here is that Möbius was considering directed quantities, an early appearence of vectors. In 1837 Möbius published a book on statics in which he clearly states the idea of resolving a vector quantity along two specified axes. Between these two works of Möbius, a geometrical work by Bellavitis was published in 1832 which also contains vector type quantities. His basic objects are line segments AB and he considers AB and BA as two distinct objects. He defines two line segments as 'equipollent' if they are equal and parallel, so, in modern notation, two line segments are equipollent if they represent the same vector. Bellavitis then defines the 'equipollent sum of line segments' and obtains an 'equipollent calculus' which is essentially a vector space. In 1814 Argand had represented the complex numbers as points on the plane, that is as ordered pairs of real numbers. Hamilton represented the complex numbers as a two dimensional vector space over the reals although of course he did not use these general abstract terms. He presented these results in a paper to the Irish Academy in 1833. He spent the next 10 years of his life trying to define a multiplication on the 3-dimensional vector space over the reals. Hamilton's quaternions, published in 1843, was an important example of a 4-dimensional vector space but, particularly with Tait's work on quaternions published in 1873, there was to be some competition between vector and quaternion methods. You can see a picture of the plaque commemorating where Hamilton discovered the Quaternions and a (fanciful) engraving of when he carved the rules. In 1857 Cayley introduced matrix algebras, helping the move towards more general abstract systems by adding to the different types of structural laws being studied. In 1858 Cayley noticed that the quaternions could be represented by matrices. In 1867 Laguerre wrote a letter to Hermite Sur le calcul des systèmes linéaires. His systèmes linéaires is a table of coefficients of a system of linear equations denoted by a single upper-case letter and Laguerre defines addition, subtraction and multiplication of of these linear sysyems. In this work Laguerre aims to unify algebraic systems such as complex numbers, Hamilton's quaternions and notions introduced by Galois and by Cauchy. Laguerre's work on linear systems was followed up by a paper by Carvallo in 1891. In this paper he defines operators on vector functions and draws a clear distinction between operators and matrices. To understand the difference between the notions of an operator and a matrix, it suffices to say that, if one changes the coordinate system, one obtains a different matrix to represent the same vector function, but the same operator. Another mathematician who was moving towards geometry without coordinates was Grassmann. His work is highly original but the notion of barycentric coordinates introduced by Möbius was his main motivation. Grassmann's contribution Die Ausdehnungslehre appeared in several different versions. The first was in 1844 but it was a very difficult work to read, and clearly did not find favour with mathematicians, so Grassmann tried to produce a more readable version which appeared in 1862. Clebsch inspired Grassmann to work on this new version. Grassmann studied an algebra whose elements are not specified, so are abstract quantities. He considers systems of elements on which he defines a formal operation of addition, scalar multiplication and multiplication. He starts with undefined elements which he calls 'simple quantities' and generates more complex quantities using specified rules. But ... I go further, since I call these not just quantities but simple quantities. There are other quantities which are themselves compounded quantities and whose characteristics are as distinct relative to each other as the characteristics of the different simple quantities are to each other. These quantities come about through addition of higher forms ... His work contains the familiar laws of vector spaces but, since he also has a multiplication defined, his structures satisfy the properties of what are today called algebras. The precise structures are now known as Grassmann algebras. The ideas of linearly independent and linearly dependent sets of elements are clearly contained in Grassmann's work as is the idea of dimension (although he does not use the term). The scalar product also appears in Grassmann's 1844 work. Grassmann's 1862 version of Die Ausdehnungslehre has a long introduction in which Grassmann gives a summary of his theory. In this introduction he also defends his formal methods which had clearly been objected to by a number of mathematicians. Grassmann's justification comes very close to saying that he is setting up an axiomatic theory and this shows that he is well ahead of his time. Cauchy and Saint-Venant have some claims to have invented similar systems to Grassmann. Saint-Venant's claim is a fair one since he published a work in 1845 in which he multiples line segments in an analogous way to Grassmann. In fact when Grassmann read Saint-Venant's paper he realised that Saint-Venant had not read his 1844 work and sent two copies of the relevant parts to Cauchy, asking him to pass one copy to Saint-Venant. However, rather typically of Cauchy, in 1853 he published Sur les clefs algébrique in Comptes Rendus which describes a formal symbolic method which coincides with that of Grassmann's method (but makes no reference to Grassmann). Grassmann complained to the Académie des Sciences that his work had priority over Cauchy's and, in 1854, a committee was set up to investigate who had priority. We still await the committee's report! The first to see the importance of Grassmann's work was Hankel. In 1867 he wrote a paper Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme concerning formal systems where combination of the symbols are abstractly defined. He credits Grassmann's Die Ausdehnungslehre as giving the foundation for his work. The first to give an axiomatic definition of a real linear space was Peano in a book published in Torino in 1888. He credits Leibniz, Möbius's 1827 work, Grassmann's 1844 work and Hamilton's work on quaternions as providing ideas which led him to his formal calculus. Peano's 1888 book Calcolo geometrico secondo l'Ausdehnungslehre di H. Grassmann preceduto dalle operazioni della logica deduttiva is remarkable. It gives the basic calculus of set operation introducing the modern notation ∩, ∪, for intersection, union and an element of. It was many years before this notation was to become accepted, in fact Peano's book seems to have had very little influence for many years. It is equally remarkable for containing an almost modern introduction to linear spaces and linear algebra. In Chapter IX of the book Peano gives axioms for a linear space. It is hard to believe that Peano writes the following in 1888. It could almost come from a 1988 book! The first is for equality of elements (a = b) if and only if (b = a), if (a = b) and (b = c) then (a = c). The sum of two objects a and b is defined, i.e. an object is defined denoted by a + b, also belonging to the system, which satisfies: If (a = b) then (a + c = b + c), a + b = b + a, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, and the common value of the last equality is denoted by a + b + c. If a is an object of the system and m a positive integer, then we understand by ma the sum of m objects equal to a. It is easy to see that for objects a, b, ... of the system and positive integers m, n, ... one has If (a = b) then (ma = mb), m(a+b) = ma+mb, (m+n)a = ma+na, m(na) = mna, 1a = a. We suppose that for any real number m the notation ma has a meaning such that the preceeding equations are valid. Peano goes on to state the existence of a zero object 0 and says that 0a = 0, that a - b means a + (-b) and states it is easy to show that a - a = 0 and 0 + a = a. Peano defines a linear system to be any system of objects satisfying his four conditions. He goes on to define dependent objects and independent objects. He then defines dimension. Definition: The number of the dimensions of a linear system is the maximal number of linearly independent objects in the system. He proves that finite dimensional spaces have a basis and gives examples of infinite dimensional linear spaces. Peano considers entire functions f(x) of a variable x, defines the sum of f1(x) and f2(x) and the product of f(x) by a real number m. He says:- If one considers only functions of degree n, then these functions form a linear system with n + 1 dimensions, the entire functions of arbitrary degree form a linear system with infinitely many dimensions. Peano defines linear operators on a linear space, shows that by using coordinates one obtains a matrix. He defines the sum and product of linear operators. In the 1890's Pincherle worked on a formal theory of linear operators on an infinite dimensional vector space. However Pincherle did not base his work on that of Peano, rather on the abstract operator theory of Leibniz and d'Alembert. Like so much work in this area it had very little immediate impact and axiomatic infinite dimensional vector spaces were not studied again until Banach and his associates took up the topic in the 1920's. Although never attaining the level of abstraction which Peano had achieved, Hilbert and his student Schmidt looked at infinite dimensional spaces of functions in 1904. Schmidt introduced a move towards abstraction in 1908 introducing geometrical language into Hilbert space theory. The fully axiomatic approach appeared in Banach's 1920 doctoral dissertation.

His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it:) and his fecundity.“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.”“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.”“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All real things—”“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?”“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?”Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.”“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; “that…very clear indeed.”“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,” continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. “Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?”“I have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?”“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.”“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.“Easier, far easier down than up.”“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.”“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present movement. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. “You can move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.”“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”“Oh, this,” began Filby, “is all—-”“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.“It’s against reason,” said Filby.“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will never convince me.”“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—-”“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time as the driver determines.”Filby contented himself with laughter.“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man. “Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the Very Young Man thought.“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The German Scholars have improved Greek so much.”“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!”“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic basis.”“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—-”“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify that?”“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s all humbug, you know.”The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory.The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s anecdote collapsed.The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted-is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table, was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fire-place. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?” said the psychologist.“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one"
