Can you stack up the blocks so that one block is suspended over the edge of the table; that is, can you stack the blocks so that one particular block is supported by other blocks, but no part of the table is directly below the particular block?\n\nThough seemingly simple, this question has inspired some very interesting mathematics that combines basic physics, combinatorics, and computer science. This talk will focus on concrete examples, and will discuss some classical results and also recent work by Mike Paterson and Uri Zwick and by Paterson, Peres, Thorup, Winkler, and Zwick.\n\nThe block stacking problem is an age-old question that is sometimes called the book-stacking problem, and it also works quite well with a deck of cards (as pointed out by Ron Graham at the 2009 Joint Mathematics Meetings). Speaking of which, it would be great if some of you could bring along decks of cards to stack with. Also, Jay---can we have this talk in a room with desks? I conducted a thought experiment involving stacking slices of pizza on the edge of a paper plate I was holding in my mind, and, well, let's just say the carpet in my thought experiment may never be quite the same.\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nP.S. I have been told that \"stack\", \"variety\", and even \"scheme\" are remarkable and sometimes hard to understand concepts in algebraic geometry (if you don't believe me, check out the top google hit for stack variety scheme ). As far as I can tell, these are totally unrelated to stacking blocks.\n\nOctober 31, 2008\n\nSpeaker: Vidit Nanda\n\nTitle: Buffon's Needle Problem\n\nAbstract: It is a fine winter morning in Paris. Le Comte de Buffon, nursing a level-7 hangover from various cognac-related excesses of the night before, screams angrily at the help who have bungled his breakfast again. As the veal (medium rare) and the wine (Merlot, bien entendu) sink in, he rummons the strength to stand and ponder the following:\n\n\"Suppose that you drop a short needle on ruled paper - what is then the probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines? \"\n\nWe will solve Buffon's Needle Problem twice. Once in the standard way, and once with the cute - yet insightful - trick of Barbier from 1860. The answer provides a way for anyone with the simple luxuries of 1) a needle, 2) a sheet of ruled paper, and 3) infinite time to estimate Pi accurately.\n\nApril 25, 2008\n\nSpeaker: Eduardo Osorio\n\nTitle: Untitled\n\nAbstract: Hi Pizza seminar attendees. This Friday I will give a very basic talk on a small Financial Math result that has popped up in way too many get togethers with friends and I have been never able to explain it satisfactorily. We'll see if I can do it this time.\n\nA call option is a financial contract between two parties, the buyer and the seller. The buyer (or holder) of the option has the right, but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying instrument) from the seller at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). The seller is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer decides to exercise such an option.\n\nA European call option allows the holder to exercise the option only on the agreed expiration date. An American call option allows exercise at any time during the life of the option. Because of this early exercise feature, the american call option on a stock (say a Google stock) is at least as valuable as its European counterpart. Well, it turns out that in the case that the stock price follows the dynamics of a Geometric Brownian Motion (a model widely used) the early exercise feature for a call on a stock (paying no dividends) is worthless. I will attempt to introduce (very) shortly and roughly how to price these options, and then I will show that their price is the same.\n\nFebruary 29, 2008\n\nSpeaker: Eric Rowland\n\nTitle: The Crazy Thue-Morse Sequence\n\nAbstract: Since this talk falls on February 29th, I decided that I should choose a subject matter that is equally unusual and mysterious. So I will talk about the Thue-Morse sequence -- a sequence of 0s and 1s with a very regular but nonperiodic structure. It begins\n\n0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 ... .\n\nWe'll see this sequence cropping up in infinitely long games of chess, strange iterated products, multigrades (sets of integers for which $\\sum_{a \\in A} a^i = \\sum_{b \\in B} b^i$ holds for several different values of $i$), and alfalfa. I'll also talk about the class of automatic sequences (of which Thue-Morse is the first example) and a generalization to infinite alphabets (namely the integers).\n\nApril 20, 2007\n\nSpeaker: John Bryk\n\nTitle: In Which John Bryk Proves Something Neat about Transcendental Numbers\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn the mid-1930's, Gelfond and Schneider independently proved that if a and b are algebraic numbers, then a^b is transcendental (excluding the trivial cases a = 0, 1 or b rational). I had never bothered to look up the proof myself, partly because transcendental number theory isn't my cup of tea, and partly because I imagined the proof to be quite hard. Although the former is still true, I recently found out that the latter isn't.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss transcendental numbers. The main result I will prove roughly states that if f and g are well-behaved analytic functions algebraically independent over the rationals, then f(z) and g(z) are both algebraic for only finitely many z. The proof uses little more than linear algebra and the maximum modulus principle. Immediate consequences of the theorem include the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem as well as the classical facts that e and pi are transcendental.\n\nApril 21, 2006\n\nSpeaker: Philip Matchett Wood\n\nTitle: The Pentagon Game\n\nAbstract: This talk is based on the work of Richard Schwartz, and named for his two daughters Lucy and Lily.\n\nSuppose you have a regular pentagon in the plane that is centered at the origin. Suppose also that this pentagon may be moved around in the plane by being reflected over a line containing one of its edges. So you always have five possible moves that can be made.\n\nNow, suppose that one night while you are sleeping someone _else_ makes 50 random moves of your pentagon. When you wake up, how long will it take you to move the pentagon back to being centered at the origin?\n\nJust to give an idea that moving the pentagon back to the origin might not be easy, note that using the edge reflection moves, the positions of the center of the pentagon are dense in the plane. So, for example, when you wake up,you might find that the origin is _inside_ your pentagon, but the pentagon is_still_ not centered.\n\nWant to find out more?

In this talk we won’t go that far, but we should have enough time to eat some pizza and discuss what Kakutani proved...\n\nFebruary 10, 2006\n\nSpeaker: Prof R. Falk & Prof G. Cherlin\n\nTitle:Two Faculty Glimpses\n\nAbstract (from Prof Cherlin):\n\nModel theory deals with very general algebraic systems, but frequently leads back to algebraic geometry and specifically to algebraic groups. I aim to indicate why that is. Part of the explanation is conjectural.\n\nAbstract (from Prof Falk):\n\nTitle: Approximation of Partial Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method:\n\nThe finite element method is one of the major advances in numerical computing of the past century. It has become an indispensable tool for simulation of a wide variety of phenomena arising in science and engineering. A tremendous asset of finite elements is that they not only provide a methodology to develop numerical algorithms for simulation, but also a theoretical framework in which to assess the accuracy of the computed solutions.\n\nThis talk introduces the basic ideas of approximation of partial differential equations by the finite element method. These include variational formulations of boundary value problems (on which the finite element method is based), the construction and approximation properties of finite element (i.e, piecewise polynomial) spaces, and a discussion of rigorous error estimates for such approximation schemes."
