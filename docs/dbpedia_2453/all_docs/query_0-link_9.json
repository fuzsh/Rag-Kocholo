        "text": "Zierler:\n\nOK, this is David Zierler, Oral Historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is February 26, 2021. I am so happy to be here with Professor John Preskill. John, it's great to see you. Thank you so much for joining me.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, I'm glad to do it, David.\n\nZierler:\n\nTo start, would you please tell me your titles and institutional affiliations? And you'll notice I pluralize everything because I know you have more than one.\n\nPreskill:\n\nOh, OK. Well, I am the Richard P. Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology, and I'm the Director of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at Caltech. And we can leave it at that.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhen were you named to the Feynman Chair?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, when Kip [Thorne] retired. Actually, the background on that is interesting because the donor endowed the chair around 1990. So there was a lot of discussion at Caltech about how we would make use of the leverage of being able to offer the Feynman Chair in Theoretical Physics to someone. And Kip and I actually went on a secret mission to Cambridge to offer it to Stephen Hawking in 1991.\n\nZierler:\n\nOh, wow. I did not know that.\n\nPreskill:\n\nYeah. And so, he was very polite. Of course, he already was the Lucasian Professor obviously. So, the upshot of that was that Stephen didn't accept the Feynman Chair, but he did agree to make regular visits to Caltech. Which he did for many years. He would come for a variable amount of time, typically a month or six weeks in the depths of the Cambridge winter and enjoy the California sunshine. But then, Kip wound up being the Feynman Chair. And I guess I'd have to look up when he retired. It was probably about ten years ago. And I became the Feynman Chair at that point.\n\nZierler:\n\nIs it known who the donor was back in 1990? Or is that anonymous?\n\nPreskill:\n\nI think I can say. Actually, it's an interesting fellow who's still with us. Mike Scott is his name. And he was, at one time in the early days, the CEO of Apple Computer. When Steve Jobs and Wozniak founded Apple Computer, and they wanted to produce the Apple II, they needed to raise capital, and their investors insisted that they bring in someone with business experience to help manage the company, and that was Mike Scott, who was at Apple for just a few years and had other interesting experiences in his career. But the connection with Feynman is that Mike Scott was a Caltech alum who was among the class that attended the Feynman lectures at ‘61-‘62, ‘62-‘63, the whole two-year sequence. And like many of the students who attended, he was profoundly impressed by that experience. And I think that's what induced him to endow a chair in Feynman's honor.\n\nZierler:\n\nJohn, you knew Feynman, and Feynman being who he was, what did it mean for you when you were named with this honor?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, it gives you a sense of impostor syndrome, right? Who can live up to that title? But I guess I just shrug it off and carry on.\n\nZierler:\n\n[laugh] Tell me about the origins of IQIM, the Institute.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, of course, I started out my career doing particle physics and with occasional forays into cosmology. So the backstory of IQIM is, I made a mid-career shift in research interests in the mid-1990s. And that happened around 1994, when I learned about Peter Shor's factoring algorithm. But I was primed, I think, to get interested in the subject of quantum information and quantum computing for a couple of reasons. One was that just the previous year, the SSC had been canceled. And for my generation of particle physicists, this was really a terrible blow because we had come along a little bit too late to participate in erecting the Standard Model. I started graduate school in 1975, and so, there was still controversy about what the right electroweak model was at that stage. But the J/psi had been discovered the year before, all the great stuff had been done. Not that there wasn't still a lot of interesting particle physics to do.\n\nBut our big hope for beyond the Standard Model physics, we were going to be the generation that would unravel the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and all the new physics associated with it, and the SSC was going to be the source of the rich phenomenology that we thought we were going to mine as theorists to probe more deeply into nature's secrets. And when the SSC was canceled for complicated political reasons, even though they had already been digging the tunnel in Texas and had sunk a couple of billion dollars in it, one realized it was going to be quite a while before we were going to have the experimental input that we needed to really understand what was going on with physics beyond the Standard Model, which it was generally believed would be discovered when we got up to those energies. And so, I was sort of in a mood to think about different things.\n\nAnd in fact, while I was sort of waiting, as many of us were, for the SSC to come along, I had already been doing things which were not very phenomenological, like thinking about black holes and how they process information. So, I had sort of become acquainted with principles of quantum information—which were not so widely known by physicists except for a small community—just because I thought that might be useful for understanding what's going on with black holes. And when Shor discovered this factoring algorithm, about a month later Artur Ekert, who was a pioneer of quantum cryptography, visited Caltech and gave a talk. And he mentioned this recent breakthrough that Shor had discovered that you could efficiently factor with quantum computers. And it's possible I've embellished the memory in hindsight, but I was quite amazed by this.\n\nFeynman had been interested in quantum computing, and I knew that. And I wasn't very impressed by the whole subject. I didn't quite see the point of it. But I realized with the discovery of Shor's algorithm that it really meant there was a big difference between what problems we'd be able to solve and which ones we'd never be able to solve with computing technology because it's a quantum world instead of a classical one. Things became possible thanks to quantum mechanics that just wouldn't be possible in a different type of physical world. And I still think that's one of the most amazing things we've ever learned about quantum physics, the difference between quantum and classical. Sorry, I'm giving a rather longwinded answer to your question.\n\nZierler:\n\nNo, this is the intellectual origins of the Institute.\n\nPreskill:\n\nCorrect. And so, I had a colleague at Caltech, Jeff Kimble, still at Caltech, and he was also quite excited about this surge of interest in quantum computing. He was a quantum optics guy. And he had made experimental advances in squeezing states of light and using them for metrology and stuff. But it's different now. Atomic Molecular Optic physics is widely recognized by most physicists as an intellectually rich and exciting field. And that's happened largely, I think, in the last 25 years, because of the connections with quantum computing and because of the connections with condensed matter, the possibility of simulating interesting states of quantum matter using these AMO systems. But back then, there was sort of a feeling in the quantum optics community that they didn't get respect because, from the perspective or somebody like me, what was the point, you know? As a particle physicist, I was trying to understand new laws of nature. But what can you do with quantum optics in the lab that you couldn't just figure out with pencil and paper what was going to happen?\n\nAnd quantum computing, at least in principle, kind of changed that. Because I think it drove home that you should be able to do experiments where you're learning something from the experiment that you couldn't just simulate or calculate. And so, Jeff would have to say himself what got him excited, but I think he realized he had experimental tools that were very relevant to exploring quantum information. And I got excited from the theory perspective and wanted to learn more about what was experimentally possible. So, we formed what we called the Quantum Computing Club at the time, and we started having joint group meetings. And so, I learned some things. I've never been deeply knowledgeable, really, about how experiments work, but I learned a lot more than I had known about what you could do with quantum optics tools. And meanwhile, I was trying to understand whether you could protect quantum computers from noise, which led to the development of the idea of quantum error correction.\n\nBut actually, we wound up getting a DARPA grant. This was kind of interesting. The Department of Defense agencies had an immediate interest in quantum computing after Shor's algorithm because of the applications to cryptology. And they were the early supporters of the research in the field. Including the development of experimental tools. And DARPA, in particular, put out a call, and we submitted a proposal, and we got funded for a project which we called QUIC. I guess it was Quantum Information and Computation, but QUIC for short. And there were five PIs, and that helped Jeff do his first teleportation experiment in the lab, and I worked on quantum error correction ideas, and stuff like that. It was a five-year award, and after two years, they cut it. There was a new program manager. This was, I learned, not unprecedented for DARPA --- a new program manager comes in, and what you think is a multi-year commitment turns out not to be.\n\nBut I had learned something under Jeff's tutelage, that with money, you can do things. As a theorist and particle physicist, I had it pretty easy as far as funding a group because at Caltech, we had this big DOE high energy physics umbrella grant, which was mostly for experimentalists, and the theorists were a little pimple on it. And that was enough for us to support post-docs and so on. And we also had Caltech funding for theoretical physics post-docs, which helped a lot. But when we had this DARPA funding, I was, for example, able to bring in Alexei Kitaev as a year-long visitor and pay him a salary. I'd never had the resources to do that sort of thing. So that was kind of an eye opener for me.\n\nIn my naivete, I'd never worried much about raising money, and applying for grants, and stuff because I sort of had it made with this DOE grant, which was always renewed time after time. But then, with Jeff's encouragement, we applied for a quantum computing center. Actually, NSF started to show an interest in quantum information in the late ‘90s, and they asked a group of us, including me, to organize a workshop because that's how they do things, which took place in the fall of 1999. These were the waning days of the Clinton Administration. And the conventional wisdom at the time was that, partly due to Al Gore's influence, NSF got a surge of funding for a program they called Information Technology Research, which included a lot of practical things, but also sort of a lunatic fringe of blue sky research. And that's what we were part of.\n\nWe applied to this ITR program, and we asked for a big center, which would encompass experiment and theory. And the NSF program manager involved, a guy named Mike Foster, said he wasn't interested in the experiment, only in the theory. So we wound up getting a million dollars a year just for a theory institute. This was in the fall of 2000, which was the Institute for Quantum Information. There was no Matter then, just a theory institute. But the timing was great because there were all these young people who were excited about the field, who were getting PhDs. We were able to build a group of really strong post-docs and attract Caltech students into research in that area. And we could pretty much get any outstanding post-doc we wanted because there wasn't so much competition then. There's a lot more now. So, we had an amazing group of young people in the early 2000s who came through, many of whom are leaders of research in quantum information now, like Patrick Hayden, and Guifré Vidal, and Frank Verstraete, and quite a few others.\n\nZierler:\n\nToday, of course, there are several centers that have a similar research focus. But at the time, there were not, of course. You were really at the vanguard of all of this. So, the question is, what was your model? What other centers were out there that you might have used to base your ideas on…on where this ultimately would develop?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, actually, my model was the experience that I had with the particle theory group, which I didn't appreciate immediately was a bit culturally different than most research efforts in AMO physics and what was then the nascent interest in quantum information—which was I wanted to bring in the best young scientists and give them a lot of freedom, to create a community of people who had some common interests, but also complementary backgrounds. So, I deliberately would put a computer scientist in the same office with a physicist so those guys would talk. And I guess that was the model. Now, the Institute, the next one which had a big investment, was the Perimeter Institute. When it was founded, they saw quantum information as a core part of their mission. And then, later, there was another institute at Waterloo, The Institute for Quantum Computing, which had a lot of resources, all thanks to Mike Lazaridis, and the Canadian government, and government of Ontario.\n\nBut we got off to such a quick start, and we already had a track record of bringing in great people who did great research while they were at Caltech, and then went on to later career success. And we were able to continue to recruit the best young people very successfully. The first thing I did with the IQI funding is, we hired Alexei Kitaev. This is interesting, too. When I got that DARPA money, I thought, “Hey, I could bring in a long-term visitor with this funding. So, who should that be?” And so, I asked a few colleagues for suggestions. And indirectly, I heard from Richard Joza that he had met this amazing young Russian at a conference. The conference was in Japan. That was Kitaev. And I didn't know much about Kitaev, but he had a paper on the arXiv, which I then read and was blown away by. He had sort of reformulated Shor's algorithm in a more general and powerful way.\n\nAnd so, I arranged to have him visit in 1997. Actually, the legend about that paper that he wrote is, in 1994 he heard about Shor having discovered that you could factor with a quantum computer. He was at the Landau Institute in Russia. And he wasn't in the in-group that had access to the preprint. It wasn't posted on the arXiv, although the arXiv existed at that time. But it was just kind of circulating around by email. And he wasn't able to get it. So he had to figure it out for himself. Now, it's a huge advantage to know that it's possible, so he had it on good authority that Peter Shor had discovered an algorithm for factoring large numbers efficiently on a quantum computer, and then he figured it out. His approach was different and more general than Shor's. That was the paper I read, his version of what we now call the Hidden Subgroup Problem. He called it the Abelian Stabilizer Problem, and Shor's algorithm fit into that framework.\n\nSo, this guy is clearly very interesting. And I arranged it for him to first come for a shorter visit. It was his first time in the US, I think. And the first day that we met and sat down for coffee, he started telling me about this idea he had to use non-Abelian anyons for quantum computing. And here's something funny. I was very interested in non-Abelian anyons. That was one of the things I was fooling around with waiting for the SSC to turn on. Non-Abelian anyons are particles in a two-dimensional medium which have exotic statistics, more general than bosons or fermions. And non-Abelian means that you can actually have a state of many of these particles be modified just by braiding them around one another.\n\nAnd what Kitaev had realized is that this was an approach to quantum computing that would be resistant to noise because it was topological. The effect of exchanging a pair of these anyons, because the information is encoded in a very, very nonlocal way, the environment buffeting the system locally doesn't interfere with it. This was a very brilliant idea. And I understood it immediately after 15 minutes of taking about it over coffee because I knew about non-Abelian anyons, and I was very interested in quantum error correction. And it had never occurred to me that these two things that I was very interested in were related. And I guess that shows that I'm not Kitaev.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut you can spot a Kitaev when you see one.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, that's true, and I was ahead of my time in that regard. He was underappreciated for sure in 1997. And so, he came back the next year supported by this DARPA grant as a visiting professor. And we actually jointly taught a course on quantum computing. And then, when we got the NSF award in 2000, the first thing I tried to do was hire him. Of course, I couldn't hire him as a professor by myself. That had to go through the usual Caltech hiring process. But I could hire him, although it had to be approved by a committee, as what we called at the time a senior research associate. Now, we call it a research professor. It's a position that we have at Caltech for people who are world-leading researchers with stature comparable to a tenured professor, but it's a soft money position, and it's paid out of a grant. No teaching responsibilities.\n\nZierler:\n\nThis is what Sean Carroll has, for example.\n\nPreskill:\n\nThat's what Sean has. And that's what John Schwarz had, actually, when I first came to Caltech. That's another story, speaking of someone who was underappreciated for a while. Yeah. And so, we had Kitaev, and we had this amazing group of young people. And then, a lot of students came through and trained. I think probably in terms of impact on science, leading the IQI and establishing it is the most impactful thing I've done when you look at all the people who came through and how they've become scientific leaders. But anyway, to come around to answering your question, for ten years, we were just the IQI, and we went through several cycles of renewal at NSF. And Jeff spearheaded this. I wouldn't have thought to request a grant to start a theory institute if Jeff Kimble hadn't been pushing me, so I'm grateful to him for that.\n\nAnd in 2010, we applied for the Physics Frontier Center program at NSF, very competitive thing. There are ten of them in the country in different areas of physics. And that turned out to be successful, and as a result, what had been the IQI expanded to a larger center that did encompass both theory and experiment, pretty much as we had envisioned back when we originally proposed it in 2000. We had something like that in mind, but NSF at that time said, “We only want the theory.” But in 2011 we became the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter. And now, that's been around for almost ten years, since 2011, and has been very successful.\n\nZierler:\n\nJohn, that's a great overview of your current titles and affiliations. So before we take it all the way back and develop your personal history, I'd like to ask a very in-the-moment question. As you say, of course, we're all working from our home offices now. As a theoretical physicist, I wonder if in some ways, these past 11 months have been more productive for you because the social and physical isolation perhaps has given you a bit more headspace or bandwidth to work on some equations or problems that you might otherwise not have. On the other hand, I wonder if your style as a scientist really depends on in-person, interpersonal interaction, and in many ways, your research agenda has suffered as a result.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, as the question suggests, it's a complicated issue with tradeoffs. One big change for me is I was traveling a lot. And I get, of course, as we all do, lots of invitations, most of which I turn down. But for opportunities to lecture, attend conferences, and things like that, there were a certain number of them which I really thought I had to accept. So the last couple of years, I had been making lots of trips. And it was really a bit of a relief to put a stop to that for a while and not be chasing around so much.\n\nOn the other hand, the kinds of interactions you have when you visit other places to attend a conference or give a talk and so on, the kinds of informal interactions, those are not very well simulated in the Zoom era, although there are various attempts to do that. And so, you do miss that kind of thing where you go to dinner or lunch and just chat. And sometimes, that's a good way of probing questions and coming up with ideas. So, I think we've all suffered a bit from missing that kind of interaction.\n\nIn my group, it hasn't been too bad. We have our group meetings on Zoom, and I'm able to keep up with what students and post-docs are doing, and so on. But I think it's hard for the new students. They can attend meetings and stuff like that, but it's hard to become sort of integrated into the community in our online existence compared to when we're able to hang around and chat in our offices or at a coffee break. But in response to your question, yeah, I think I have had a bit more time for reflection than was the case, say, in the previous couple of years, and that has been helpful. And it's also given me a little more time, maybe, for reading and catching up on things.\n\nOne thing that I had been increasingly feeling was missing from my education or knowledge base was the students are more and more interested in machine learning, and I really just didn't know much about it. And I still know only a limited amount about it. But I did take some time to read textbooks and papers, and I also am collaborating with some students who know a lot more about machine learning than I do. And so, that's been a plus over the last year.\n\nIt's interesting with the experimentalists. They seem to be much more challenged than we are as theorists. Some of the labs were closed down for a while. Now, they're operating under socially distanced protocols, and that slows things down. But I've also had several experimentalists tell me that they're getting the best data ever because the lab is so quiet. There's nobody walking around, people aren't opening and shutting doors. And a lot of experiments are operating remotely or with minimal physical presence in the lab of group members, and that's had some benefits. So, it's not all bad, even for the experimentalists.\n\nZierler:\n\nThe big question going forward, what are the best aspects of the current dynamic that you plan to continue using once we're out of the pandemic?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, I don't know. I think the model of doing seminars and conferences online will have a place going forward. Like I said, it's not really the same in terms of the personal interactions as a face-to-face conference. But it's still pretty effective. So, I've attended workshops, and, of course, things get recorded, so you can watch them later. That was happening anyway. Usually, when there was an event, people were making videos. But since it's just not feasible to travel to all the things that one wants to attend, having that option of participating in a meeting with people all over the world is something we'll probably take advantage of more than we have in the past, going forward.\n\nZierler:\n\nWell, let's take it all the way back to the beginning. Tell me about your parents and where they're from.\n\nPreskill:\n\nI grew up in Chicago. My dad, Alfred Preskill, his parents were Eastern European Jews, his mom from Latvia, his dad from Lithuania. And like many Jews, they came to the United States in the 1880s or 1890s. In the case of my grandfather, he and his brothers would've been drafted into the Tsar's army if they had stuck around in Lithuania. That was one of the incentives for leaving. And they all came to Chicago. And that's where my grandfather met my grandmother.\n\nZierler:\n\nI assume Preskill is an Anglicized name.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, according to family folklore, in Lithuania, it had a similar sound. And I've sometimes pondered whether it's related to names like Peskin and Peshkin. But we think in Lithuania, they were saying it more or less the way I do as Preskill. And there are several alternative spellings that were adopted when people immigrated. So, there are some Preskills still around the Chicago area, but there are also other spellings, like Preaskil. So anyway, my grandfather's business that he started was a harness shop. He would make the rig that you would use to attach your horse to your buggy. But when automobiles came in, he realized that wasn't a good business model, so he opened a hardware store. And when my dad was a kid, he used to work in the hardware store. So even in later life, he considered himself to be an expert on tools.\n\nAnd my mom has a rather different origin story. She actually converted to Judaism when she married my father, and then later in life, she actually got bat mitzvahed. Much later in life. But she did not grow up Jewish. She grew up in Cleveland. Her father was a lawyer, and his family had been, for many generations, farmers. And my mom's mother also came from a family that had been farming in Pennsylvania and Ohio for many generations. We think they go back to before the American Revolution in Pennsylvania. But when my mom was a kid, she would work in my grandfather's law office. He was a probate lawyer, did wills. And very successful in the sense that he was very highly regarded in his profession. He wrote a textbook on Ohio probate law that was widely used and had some high-level connections.\n\nOne of the famous family stories is my mom, as a teenage girl, was working the switchboard in the office, and she cut off the Vice President of the United States by pulling the plug while he was talking to my grandfather. She wound up going to law school, and it was pretty unusual for women to attend law school. She was the only one in her class at what was then called Western Reserve, now Case Western Reserve in Cleveland. And I think she might've gone into practice with my grandfather. But then, World War II came.\n\nAnd going back to my dad for a minute, he wound up going to the University of Chicago. He was very good student. He graduated high school at 16, and he graduated law school at 20. At the University of Chicago, he was able to get a bachelor's degree and a law degree more or less concurrently. And that was 1932. It was the Depression. Nobody wanted to hang around in school. Everybody had to go out and earn a living if you could get a job. So, he was in a big hurry. Because he was 20, he couldn't take the bar exam because he was still a minor. He had to wait til he was 21. And he passed the bar exam and worked for a law firm for a while. But when the war came, he was 4F because of a medical condition. He was about 30 then, but he couldn't enlist.\n\nSo, the way he did public service was he became a federal employee. He moved to Baltimore and worked for what was then called the Federal Security Agency, which was setting the legal foundations for the Social Security system, which was still sort of being fleshed out. And that's where he met my mom. When the war came, she also thought she should work for the government, and they wound up in Baltimore. The reason they were in Baltimore is a lot of the federal agencies moved out of DC because that was being taken over for military purposes. And that's where they met. They were both lawyers in the same office, and they got married 1944 and moved back to Chicago.\n\nMy mom did give up the law when she had her first child, my older brother David, in 1947. But she was really a remarkably capable woman. And so, she volunteered for everything. She was the President of the PTA, the League of Women Voters, and a local philanthropic organization. And she learned Sign Language so she could work with the deaf, and she worked with kids with Cerebral Palsy, and she volunteered in the hospital, and as a tutor at the high school. She was really a dynamo and has a very different personality than me—I'm quite introverted, she was very extroverted.\n\nZierler:\n\nI wonder, as a product of her generation, if her decision to leave law was because that was sort of externally expected of her. In other words, in latter generations, the same person would not have done that.\n\nPreskill:\n\nI think that's right.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid she ever express regret or frustration with that?\n\nPreskill:\n\nNot to me. And like I said, she managed to have a lot of impact outside the home in quite a number of ways. She was pretty amazing in that respect. My dad started to think the law was boring, so he joined a business called Allied Radio, which my uncle was involved in. And he worked there for over 20 years in marketing, became the VP of marketing. So one of the ways that impacted me was he would bring home these kits. Allied Radio made what were called Knight Kits you could assemble yourself with a soldering iron—radios, and walkie-talkies, a photoelectric relay, and things like that. So that was my introduction to electronics, starting when I was around 10. I really enjoyed putting those things together. And I was surprisingly uncurious about how they worked, actually. I built radios, and I was very proud that I was able to break the iron curtain and hear a broadcast in Russia on a shortwave radio, but I didn't really understand what the tuning coil, and the capacitors, and the resistors were doing. I just thought it was fun to put them together.\n\nZierler:\n\nGrowing up, how Jewishly connected was your family? Particularly with your mom, was she more interested in doing stuff than your dad in certain regards?\n\nPreskill:\n\nMy dad was the more interested one, and we belonged to a reform congregation on the North Shore of Chicago. We moved to Highland Park, one of the northern suburbs. Or they did, before the first child was born. And we belonged to this huge congregation called North Shore Congregation Israel with over 1,000 families. And he was involved in the temple one way or another at various times in his life. He was the Chair of the Board of Religious Education there for a while.\n\nAnd later, actually, after he retired he was very interested in studying Torah, and Talmud, and stuff like that with classes that the rabbi would lead. My dad was quite scholarly—I think he might have been an academic if he hadn’t come of age during the Depression. And my brothers and I went to religious school. It was usually on Sunday, actually. Reform Judaism. And you could be bar mitzvahed. I chose not to be 'cause I wasn't too keen on the idea of having to go to Hebrew school after school from 3rd grade through 7th grade. And my parents said that was OK if I didn't want to.\n\nBut I did get involved. I became, actually, when I was in high school, the audio-visual supervisor at the Temple. And so, one of my responsibilities was to make sure that the rabbi's sermons were recorded at every Friday night service. I had a crew of volunteers who would sign up. And if something went wrong, and we failed to record the sermon, the rabbi was not pleased. So, there was a little pressure there. And then, at the religious school, as the supervisor of audio-visual activities, we used to show movies sometimes, so we had to thread the projector. And that was also a bit stressful because every once in a while, the film would break, and you'd have to do emergency film repair with some magic tape or something. But that was my most active role in my youth at the Temple.\n\nZierler:\n\nJohn, you went to public schools throughout your childhood?\n\nPreskill:\n\nHighland Park High School. Highland Park public school all the way in the town we lived in. It was a good school system. And there were a lot of Jewish kids in the community. We had a tracking system, which was a pretty common practice back then, where for each discipline, they would put the kids in—I don't actually know how they decided this—level 1 English, level 2, and level 3. And the level 1 would feed into the AP classes. And so, even though it was a big school, there were over 2,000 students, if you were in those level 1 classes, it was the same kids you'd see in most of your classes year after year.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas stuff like the space race, the moon landing, formative to your development as a kid?\n\nPreskill:\n\nHugely, yes. I still remember vividly, or at least I think I do, my dad bringing home a newspaper in early 1961. It was the Daily News, the afternoon newspaper in Chicago, with this huge headline, a couple inches high: “Russian First Space Man.” Yuri Gagarin was orbiting the Earth. And it was a huge deal. Of course, the US had a space program, too. The Mercury astronauts had been chosen, and they were training, and the Russians kind of beat us to the punch with Yuri Gagarin's first flight. And Alan Shepard's first flight was a month later or so, I don't remember exactly. But those Mercury astronauts were heroes. Whenever there was a flight, Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, and so on, it was a huge national event. And it seemed like the world came to a standstill, and we were holding our breath while these guys were flying into space and managing to return to the Earth.\n\nAnd, of course, in those days, there were three TV networks, and they all had news organizations. And they'd all stop regular programming so they could cover these missions. And so, I ate everything up. I read everything I could. So [in] 1961, I was 8 years old. But I could go to the library and get a book about rockets. And there'd be a feature story in TIME magazine or whatever, lots of newspaper coverage, and I'd read all that stuff. I wanted to know everything about how Mercury was going to lead to Gemini, which was going to lead to Apollo. And so, I very avidly followed all that, and I think it did have a significant role in awakening my interest in science.\n\nZierler:\n\nJohn, were politics a topic of discussion at the dinner table as a kid? Would you have known if your parents were voting for Nixon or Kennedy?\n\nPreskill:\n\nI remember watching the Kennedy-Nixon debate, as a matter of fact. I don't remember my dad being there, but my mom was. And they were Democrats. Well, I shouldn't say that. My mom always identified as an independent. She always said she'd vote for the best candidate. Usually, it was a Democrat, but not always. And things were a little less polarized then than now. So the idea that you could, in a given year, prefer the candidate of one party, which was different than that of the previous election, did not seem wildly unlikely.\n\nZierler:\n\nIn middle school or high school, were there any standout math or science teachers who exerted a real influence on you?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, there was one in high school. His name was Donald Ens. He was a math teacher. He was a young guy. There was an English teacher, too, who I admired a lot. But the thing about Mr. Ens was he really loved math. And at that time—after a few years of being very interested in space, and rockets, and then chemistry—I had a chemistry lab, and building the radios and stuff, I decided really, the coolest thing was math. And the thing I loved the most in the reading I did was Gödel's Theorem. The idea that there were limits to what we could prove or what we could know is true in mathematics. That really impressed me. And Mr. Ens loved that kind of stuff, too. So, I had somebody I could talk to about those sorts of things.\n\nAnd in fact, when I was thinking about where to go to college, I had some rather funny notions, and one was that if you wanted to do math, Princeton was the place to be. And I'm not sure what that was based on, maybe because Einstein had been there or something. But that was firmly implanted in my head. And another idea I had was that you shouldn't go to Harvard. Because I had a friend whose older brother went to Harvard and majored in biochemistry. And when he'd come back from college, he'd always complain that all the classes were taught by graduate students. And they had all these famous professors, but you never saw them. So I thought, “Well, that doesn't sound good.”\n\nAt least Princeton claimed to be a more undergraduate-focused institution. So that's where I decided I wanted to go, and indeed, where I went. And when I went to Princeton, I was thinking I'd major in math. I talked my way into a graduate-level course on Set Theory and Logic my freshman year taught by a guy named Dana Scott, who was a distinguished logician and philosopher. And I had to get permission from the guidance office, and I had to pass out of freshman English, and stuff. I was very insistent that I had to take this class because this was going to be my future, Set Theory and Logic. And I wasn't sure if Dana Scott would be teaching it again. And it was a fun class.\n\nZierler:\n\nJohn, this was a pure math environment, not an applied math environment?\n\nPreskill:\n\nThat's right. But I realized, by the end of my freshman year, several things. One of them, I think, I'd known all along. I'm just not cut out intellectually to be a mathematician. I'm just not good enough at that kind of thing. Meanwhile, I was taking freshman physics, and in the spring term, we used this book by Purcell, Electricity and Magnetism, which is a great book, and it's still used in some places. And that really impressed me because I was learning in my math class calculus on manifolds, and about differential forms, and things like that. It was all very abstract, and very beautiful and fun. But no hint of what it was good for.\n\nWell, maybe I'm exaggerating. But certainly, the emphasis was not on what you do with this stuff. But then, in Electricity and Magnetism, learning Maxwell's equations, and why you would want to take the curl or divergence of a vector field for some useful purpose, the fact that I could piece those two things together, this very abstract math and then this physics class, which was making use of those concepts, that made me appreciate that maybe physics was a more natural home for me.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you sense, even as an undergraduate, the hierarchy of theory above experimentation in those days?\n\nPreskill:\n\nYeah, and in fact, even back in high school, I had this very snooty attitude that theorists were somehow superior. I was terrible, looking back. I thought that the intellectual pinnacle was to do theory, and that experiment just didn't appeal to me personally, let's put it that way. And so, maybe I had a perspective, which, of course, is completely wrong, that experiment was not the best route to a deep understanding of the secrets of nature, that thinking would do that. It's completely wrong. But I really did have that attitude.\n\nZierler:\n\nCan you either affirm or deny the famous quote attributed to Wightman that he referred to the experimentalists as “the help?”\n\nPreskill:\n\nArthur Wightman said that?\n\nZierler:\n\nAllegedly.\n\nPreskill:\n\nHe was my senior thesis advisor.\n\nZierler:\n\nThat's right.\n\nPreskill:\n\n“The help.” Well, I'm not sure I knew that. He was a wonderful man, but I'm surprised he would say that.\n\nZierler:\n\nIt may be apocryphal, I don't know.\n\nPreskill:\n\nAlthough, of course, he was a mathematical physicist and proved theorems, when he was young he did more practical things. He worked out details like how ionizing radiation deposits energy in materials and things like that. So, he had some appreciation for that type of knowledge building. Actually, another college teacher who had a big impact on me was John Wheeler. My sophomore year, he taught a class that I took for the whole year, covered everything in physics. We called it Honors Physics. And we did classical mechanics, and E&M, and stat mech, and quantum physics, and waves all in one year. And it was a very idiosyncratic course, to put it mildly.\n\nOf course, to us undergraduates, there was something kind of god-like about Wheeler. So, this was 1972. The thought that he had worked with Niels Bohr seemed unimaginable --- that anyone could be that old. He was 61 at the time. Here, I'm 68, so it doesn't seem so old now, but at the time, it sure did. And he always came to class in a suit and tie, and that also made him seem like a denizen from another generation. And, of course, he had this marvelous ability to use the blackboard to draw intricate illustrations on the spot. But the thing that was most memorable is–here's what he did on the first day of class, or at least how I remember it. We're going to do classical mechanics. We're going to use Goldstein. We're going to learn Lagrangian Mechanics. And we're going to learn Hamiltonian Mechanics from this book. And I'd already dipped into the book a little, I was excited.\n\nAnd so, I figured he was going to tell us about the calculus of variations, and the Euler-Lagrange Equations, and stuff. I kind of had a hint what that was about. But he comes in, and he goes up to the board, and he draws A on the board and B. And then, he draws a line going from A to B. And he said, “An electron is going to travel from A to B. How does it know how to go? What path should it take? Well, of course, it takes all the paths. It adds them all together with an E to the iS …” “What?” He was trying to explain that what we were learning was the classical limit of quantum theory. Although Goldstein wasn't saying it that way, he thought it was important for us to know right from the start that that was the context, and that you could understand why this calculus of variations stuff was relevant by thinking about how the phase when it's stationary would add up constructively.\n\nOf course, this is a wonderful insight coming from Feynman, who was Wheeler's student. And I thought this was great. I just was dazzled. And a lot of students, understandably, were a bit upset because then, we had to do the homework problems in Goldstein, which said, “Here's a couple of springs and a mass. Write down the Lagrangian.” What were we supposed to say? “Well, the mass is going to follow all the paths. Add them up with an E to the iS.” That didn't really help you do the homework. But Wheeler was inspiring.\n\nZierler:\n\nThis obviously planted a seed in you later on.\n\nPreskill:\n\nIt did. And here's another thing he said, which I never forgot. And this was later in the year. He came into class, and he told everyone to take out a piece of paper. He said, “I want you to write down, on your piece of paper, all of the equations of physics. Everything that one needs to know in order to derive everything else in the world.” I don't know how much time we had, a few minutes. You could write down the Maxwell Equation and the Schrödinger Equation. Fluid mechanics. Maybe the definition of entropy, and so on. And then, he collected all the papers. And he put them on a table in the front of the room, and he said, “Here on the table are all the equations of physics.” And then, he said, “Fly.” And he's talking to the equations. “Fly.” Nothing happened. The papers just sat there. And he said, “What went wrong? Here are all the equations of physics, but they won't fly. Yet, the universe flies.” That was Wheeler. [laugh]\n\nZierler:\n\nOn the social side of things, you may have heard the quip that at Princeton, the 60s came in the early 1970s. It was a little later to the game than places like Harvard or Berkeley. Were you political at all? Were you involved in any of the anti-war protests or Civil Rights things that were going on at campus in those days?\n\nPreskill:\n\nI participated, but rather passively. I guess it was before I was in college in 1970 was when a lot of campuses shut down after the invasion of Cambodia. I was in high school then. When I was at Princeton, there were some anti-war protests, and I would attend, sometimes with my friends. But it was not something that I devoted much of my time or my mindfulness to. I was pretty focused.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas the draft something you needed to contend with?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, yeah. So, by that time, there was a lottery. And there would be an event where they would, on national television, take balls out of an urn, and it was based on your birthday. So, you would get a number for each date of the calendar year, and if you had a high number attached to your birthdate, then you were unlikely to be called. And if you had a low number, there was a serious possibility of being called. And I had a high number, January 19. My number was over 300. So, I knew it was pretty clear I didn't have to worry about being drafted.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas a senior thesis at Princeton standard? Or was that an above and beyond kind of thing for you?\n\nPreskill:\n\nEvery Princeton student does it. So, it's a big deal. You spend a lot of your senior year doing it. Actually, there were junior papers as well that I think everyone had to do. In physics, we had to do one the first term and second term. And actually, looking back, maybe this was sort of formative as well. So, you're a junior, you don't have any idea what to do for a research project. You're supposed to knock on doors and talk to faculty, see if they have suggestions, say you're interested in working on something. “What do you propose?” And so, I don't know why, I guess maybe I was assigned to him, I went to see Marc Davis who's a cosmologist, he's been at Berkeley for many years now, but he was at Princeton then. And so, he asked me what I was interested in. And what I said was, I was interested in the interpretation of quantum theory. And he said, “Well, you know what --- you might be interested in is the EPR Paradox,” which I had never heard of.\n\nAnd so, he explained a little about what it was. He didn't really know. But that piqued my curiosity, and it turned out that there was a new instructor who had just arrived at Princeton that year named Stuart Freedman, and he had just done an experiment with John Clauser to test the Bell Inequality. And so, I went to him and asked him to fill me in a little bit about that. And he said something that stuck, which I thought was really weird. He had done the experiment with Clauser, which seemed to confirm violation of the Bell Inequality. But there was a competing experiment that had found a different result, that the Bell Inequality was satisfied, so the idea of local realism seemed to be confirmed by that competing experiment, which was done by a Russian group. And I said, “Well, how do you account for the discrepancy?” And he didn't give a scientific answer, he gave a political one, which was, “Well, it has to do with dialectical materialism. So, there's a bias in favor of local realism.” I thought, “Boy, could that really be it?” Anyway, it just kind of shocked me that he said that.\n\nSo I wound up reading up on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper and other papers, and I wrote my JP on that. That's what we called junior paper, JP. And I didn't really think much more about that stuff for some time. But then, when I came back to quantum information, of course, a lot of it was about entanglement. So maybe having had that experience in my formative years helped make me receptive to those kinds of ideas, I don't know.\n\nBut in the case of the senior thesis, again, the onus is on the student to find an advisor. And I had had an experience I guess late in my junior year. I used to go to the bookstore, the Princeton U Store, where there were various physics books on display, and I'd browse through them. Every once in a while, I'd buy one. And I found this book by Streater and Wightman, which was called PCT, Spin and Statistics, and All That. And I thought that was a very charming title. And so, I started browsing through it, and having still a sort of mathematical predilection, it appealed to me that there was rigorous mathematics about Quantum Field Theory. And I thought, “Boy, if I really want to understand Quantum Field Theory, I should understand what all this is about.”\n\nAnd I decided I would ask Arthur Wightman to be my thesis advisor. But then, a kind of really embarrassing thing happened. I won an award that fall at the beginning of my senior year because I had the highest academic standing in my class. And the President of Princeton in the opening ceremony presented this award, and we chatted a little. And he asked me, “Who are you going to do your thesis with?” And I said, “Oh, I'm planning to do it with Arthur Wightman.” But at this point, I'd never spoken to Wightman, he had no idea who I was. You know how it is with professors, they're hard to catch. So I went to his class, and I went up to talk to him after class. And I told him who I was, and he says, “Oh, yeah, I've heard about you from a surprising source.” He had talked to President Bowen who had said, “Oh, I talked to this guy Preskill who's going to do a thesis with you,” and Wightman had said, “What?” So that was pretty humiliating. But because Arthur Wightman was such a sweet man, I didn't stay embarrassed for long.\n\nAnd looking back, he spent an extraordinary amount of time with me that year. And I had sort of a typical undergraduate’s sense of entitlement. Whenever I saw him in his office, I figured I could barge in and start asking questions. And he never turned me away that I recall. He had sort of a gift for making you feel at ease, like he was really enjoying talking to you. At least I always felt that way. You know how sometimes people wish you'd go away, you can tell, even if they don't come right out and say it. But he was never like that.\n\nZierler:\n\nIn many ways, a senior thesis is a tryout for real scholarship later on. And so, with that in mind, I'm curious how parochial your worldview was, or not, given the extraordinary excitement and advance in particle physics in the early 1970s. Were you aware of what Sam Ting was doing? Were you aware of Grand Unification with Glashow and Georgi? Were these things on your radar? Or was your world of physics really confined to Princeton?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, I guess it was a little insular. Of course, at Princeton, asymptotic freedom was discovered by Gross and Wilczek while I was there, and also by Politzer at Harvard. But I was not so aware of that. I do remember the J/psi, the so-called November Revolution. I was a senior, and we had a speaker from the SLAC experiment actually, from SPEAR, who, not long after the discovery was announced, described the event. So even the undergraduates, the excitement bubbled down to us about the discovery of the J/psi and a lot of discussion of what it could mean, what it could be. And so, I was aware of that excitement, but I wasn't clued into the latest developments the way you are when you're a graduate student. Not as an undergraduate. I did read, under the tutelage of Arthur Wightman, a paper by Sidney Coleman that I found very remarkable, and that was part of the reason I wanted to go to Harvard. It was the paper by Coleman and Erick Weinberg.\n\nErick Weinberg had been Sidney's student at Harvard. And this was the paper about spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by radiative corrections. Very beautiful paper, which I studied in detail as an undergraduate and made use of ideas from it in my senior thesis. So that was fairly current. I guess that paper came out in '73, and I was reading it the next year. And I went into that particular paper in some depth. But I don't think I was aware of Grand Unification until I got to Harvard. Although, the original papers appeared when I was a senior in college.\n\nZierler:\n\nIn terms of Wightman's mentorship, did he essentially hand you a thesis problem to work on? Or you more or less came up with it on your own?\n\nPreskill:\n\nHe handed it to me, and it was way too hard. Way too hard. It was to prove that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the Yukawa Theory. And I mean prove it in the sense of rigorous mathematics. That’s a problem about one plus one dimensional field theory, but the tools that he wanted me to use had just been developed that year, the Osterwalder-Schrader Axioms for Euclidian Quantum Field Theory. And he believed that those tools would enable one to show that this theory of fermions and scalars would have a phase in which a discrete symmetry was spontaneously broken. And I tried to do that, and I kind of nibbled around the edges but didn't really make much headway towards a proof. The problem wasn't solved for quite some time. Maybe it took another 15 years before it was solved by real mathematicians. So, I really was not very well equipped for it either intellectually or by background, but I learned a lot. And I think most senior theses turned out that way.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat kind of advice did you get, or not, in terms of choosing graduate programs, particular professors to work with?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, I did talk to Wightman about that, I recall. Actually, here's something else, though, which maybe is worth mentioning. At that time, the attitude was widespread that if you tried to get a PhD in physics, you'd never get a job. In the ‘60s, there was a surge of hiring sort of in the post-Sputnik building of science. And so, all these young people got hired as professors in theoretical physics in particular, and all the jobs were filled. And it wouldn't be until the late 1990s that they'd start to retire and there'd be an opportunity to get a faculty job again. I heard this all the time, including from faculty when I was an undergraduate of Princeton. “If your goal is to get a PhD in physics and go on in academia, think again. Because there aren't any jobs.” But somehow, although that should've been very discouraging, it wasn't. I'm not really that conceited of a person, I'm well-aware of my limitations, but somehow, I thought, “Well, for me, it'll be different. And if you don't try, how are you going to know?” Didn't bother me so much.\n\nBut anyway, Wightman was quite positive about Sidney Coleman in particular as a potential mentor. The other thing, which I got more from talking to other students, was there was this kind of cultural divide at the time between so-called East Coast and West Coast physics. And at least the buzz with the students was, “The exciting stuff is happening at Princeton and Harvard, and Caltech and Berkeley are still doing what they were doing in the ‘60s, and they haven't caught up. What's exciting is gauge theories. And they're still doing S-matrix theory at Berkeley, so you better not go there.”\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat about the theory group at SLAC? Was that something you considered?\n\nPreskill:\n\nNo, not so much. Who would I have been aware of? Of course, I knew Sid Drell because I had read his textbook.\n\nZierler:\n\nBjorken, for example?\n\nPreskill:\n\nYeah. I don't know. I wasn't too excited about Stanford or SLAC. And at Caltech, the feeling was the glory days were behind. That's what the students were saying in the mid-70s, that Gell-Mann and Feynman were in their declining years. I had one friend who graduated a year ahead of me, good friend, Orlando Alvarez, who had been a Princeton undergrad. And he went to Harvard. I talked to him a lot, and I figured, “Well, if it's good enough for Orlando, that's probably where I should go.” And I was aware of Steve Weinberg. He had been hired at Harvard relatively recently, I think in '73 he had moved from MIT. He was sort of supposed to fill Schwinger's shoes. And I was aware of the Weinberg-Salam Model, so I knew he was supposed to be a big deal.\n\nBut to the extent that I did it, reading papers to get an idea of what people were doing or what would be interesting that faculty members at Harvard, for example, were working on-- I was very impressed by Coleman's papers at the time, less so by Weinberg's. A lot of that had to do with Coleman’s style, which was extremely clear and clever. He would use methods that he would explain very brilliantly, and which you might not have thought of yourself.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo Coleman was really the primary motivation for you wanting to go to Harvard?\n\nPreskill:\n\nThat's how I recall it. It didn't turn out quite that way because I became Steve Weinberg's student.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you have any interactions with Coleman before you got to Harvard? Did he ever come to Princeton? Did you know him personally?\n\nPreskill:\n\nIt's funny because he was at Princeton on leave at the time asymptotic freedom was being discovered. But at that time, I guess I was a sophomore. I don't remember interacting with him at all or even being aware he was there. So, I had not met him. I knew him by reputation and by reading his papers. And getting an assurance from Arthur Wightman that he was doing extremely interesting things. And like I said, I was aware that Weinberg was a big shot. I don't know if I was so aware of Glashow when I was an undergrad. But yeah, I decided I wanted to go Harvard, and that's how it turned out. And as a first-year graduate student, I took Sidney's Field Theory course, which was very popular, and the room would be filled to the rafters. In fact, that was the year that videos were made of all the lectures. And those videos were later used as part of the basis for a version of Coleman's Field Theory lectures that were recently published.\n\nAnd so, those lectures were beautiful. Coleman was a legendary lecturer, always extremely clear and entertaining. But it was the kind of thing where while you were listening, you thought everything was perfectly clear, but then afterward, it would be very hard to remember why it had been so clear. So, I would go over my notes at great length afterwards and try to re-derive everything. Sometimes I would go and watch the videos, actually, with another friend from the class. And I was determined to master whatever he talked about.\n\nSo, that was a very memorable experience. There wasn't any other course I took at Harvard that was taught nearly as well, even though they were taught by distinguished people. That same year, I took Weinberg's gravity course based on his book, Gravitation and Cosmology. General Relativity course. I liked the book, but his lectures weren’t very good. It seemed like he would come in unprepared, and then he'd open the book and start copying equations out of it. It was very uninspiring. And Shelly Glashow was not a very good lecturer, either. And you kind of got the impression he was winging it. I remember taking group theory from Shelly. It was fun, but it always seemed like very little preparation had gone into the lecture.\n\nZierler:\n\nIt's been said that pedagogy is much more prized at Princeton than it is at Harvard. I wonder if you had that experience, even though those are very different perspectives as an undergraduate to a graduate student.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, no, I've never really thought about it that way. But I guess that does align with my experience. I thought there were some very well-taught classes when I was an undergrad. Actually, I'd mentioned taking that freshman course on electricity and magnetism. I didn't mention the instructor. It was Val Fitch. And, of course, he won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of CP-violation, which I didn't know at the time. But he was an inspiring teacher. And I took another course from him on more advanced so-called modern physics, in which he discussed at great length the K-Kbar system, and flavor mixing, and CP-violation. And I wasn't aware until told by another one of the students that that was his research bread and butter. But he sure seemed to know a lot about it. [laugh] And so, that was another very memorable class.\n\nZierler:\n\nIf Steve Weinberg didn't give you a great impression as a student in his class, how did you end up becoming his student?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, everybody wanted to work with Sidney because he could explain things so clearly, and he was receptive to a certain degree to supervising students. But in a way which was only half-joking, I rather vividly remember him saying, “I have graduate students like a dog has fleas.” And, of course, he meant it as a joke, and I actually thought it was funny. But he really had a lot of students, and his personal habits were different than they were in later years. This was before he was married and before he'd been diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes. And he was a very heavy smoker and kept unconventional hours. He'd stay up all night and then go to sleep at dawn, and he'd come in in the afternoon. He always insisted that his lectures be scheduled for the afternoon because he would be sleeping in the morning. And when he would arrive in mid-afternoon, sometimes late afternoon, students would be queued up outside his office because they wanted a moment with Sidney. And I just thought, “Who needs it? I've got to stand in line to get a few minutes with my advisor?” So that was part of it.\n\nBut meanwhile, I guess I became more acquainted with some of the things Weinberg was doing, and I realized, although I wasn't that impressed by the quality of the instruction in his cosmology class, I thought cosmology was really interesting, and the idea of someone who was pursuing research that was relevant to both particle physics and cosmology appealed to me. And even more so, when the idea started to bubble up that we could learn things about particle physics by studying cosmology. Grand Unification had a lot to do with that. Of course, I did learn about Grand Unification. I would say that was one of the obvious exciting things going on in my early years in graduate school. And it became more exciting when Georgi, Quinn, and Weinberg computed, from the running of the couplings, the Grand Unification scale. Originally, Georgi and Glashow had just noted the scale had to be high, or else the proton would be too short-lived.\n\nBut by actually calculating the coupling unification scale, that seemed to indicate at first that proton decay might be right on the edge of observability, and that helped to stimulate the early experiments to detect proton decay, which wound up detecting neutrinos from Supernova 1987A and all that. But the idea that you could observationally learn something about these incredibly high-energy scales by doing the right kinds of observations was exciting to me. And then, the idea came along that baryogenesis, the origin of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe, had an explanation coming from Grand Unification, where there would be baryon-number-violating interactions, and the history of the very early universe, I thought that was very exciting.\n\nAnd Steve jumped on that, too. The first paper I remember about that was by a guy named Yoshimura. And I thought that was a really cool idea right away. Actually, around the same time, Dimopoulis and Susskind were working on this, though I wasn't as keenly aware of what they were doing, but the idea that you could understand the excess of matter over antimatter using Grand Unification and early universe cosmology, I thought that was really exciting. There was a bit of a courtship in getting to know Steve. Steve was really only interested in talking about what he was interested in generally. And I didn't spend all that much time talking to him. And when I did, he was usually pumping me for information. But the way I managed to get his attention is I thought at the time that the other really exciting thing going on in theoretical particle physics was the connection of topology with particle physics.\n\nAnd the two main aspects of that that were intriguing were that 't Hooft and Polyakov had pointed out that in unified theories, there could be magnetic monopoles. And also the idea of instantons, which came around the same time—again, with Polyakov and 't Hooft having a key role. These were quantum tunneling events that occur in Yang-Mills Theory, and they had consequences for QCD, in particular, providing a way of solving what people were calling at the time the U1 problem. There seemed to be a symmetry that QCD should have, which wasn't really a good symmetry.\n\nAnd it turned out that was due to a so-called anomaly, that the symmetry was good at the classical level but broken by quantum effects. And to understand how that worked, you had to use these topological ideas, or at least that's how people understood it at the time, having to do with instantons. And Steve got interested in instantons at some point, and I had been actually working on a problem relating to instantons, so I knew a lot about it. And so, I was always able to answer his questions. He would ask me technical questions about instantons, which he was trying to learn, and I actually knew.\n\nSo that's how he learned my name. But yeah, he was certainly inspiring in many ways, but he never gave me much guidance, and I didn't really mind that so much. But I got guidance from other people, most of all, from the post-docs. And, of course, you learn a lot from your other students. But there were remarkable post-docs at Harvard at the time. The two who I was most inspired by were Ed Witten and Michael Peskin. And Peskin, really, was the closest thing I had to a mentor in graduate school.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was Peskin working on at that point?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, we worked together on a project, actually, which had to do with instantons. And also, with my friend Orlando Alvarez, who I'd mentioned had come to Harvard from Princeton a year ahead of me. We were trying to use these instanton ideas to compute contributions to electroproduction, high-energy inelastic scattering. And we did, we worked on that a lot. It was the first serious research project I worked on. Orlando and I did most of the calculations, but Michael kind of got us started. And we had some pretty interesting results. So that was sort of how I came up to speed on these instanton methods. And my first seminars were about that work, which I'm ashamed to say, and I find a little bit inexplicable, we never published, never wrote it up, although we really did have some good results. We all sort of got distracted by other things. Not long after, Misha Shifman, and Vainshtein, and Zakharov covered some similar ideas in their papers.\n\nThe key thing that we realized is that when you do these instanton calculations, they have infrared divergences, and they show up as the instanton has a size, and you have to integrate overall the possible sizes. And if nothing cuts off that integral, it looks like you get infinite results. But what we realized is those infrared-sensitive pieces could be factored into matrix elements, and so there were other short-distance pieces that you really could compute. It was really pretty nice work. We should've written a paper. We didn't. But it still helped me get going because it gave me some confidence that I could do research that people were interested in. Howard Georgi was interested in what we were doing.\n\nAnd also, Ed Witten seemed to be interested. And my first talk at a conference was actually at Caltech. That was in early 1979, there was a meeting where students were encouraged to attend, and some of us went from Harvard, and I met other students there for the first time from Princeton and other places. But there was a session in which students could volunteer to give 20-minute talks, so I signed up for that. And I was quite excited because it was an evening session, but Feynman came, and he was in the audience. He was sort of listening to the talks. Every once in a while, he'd go out in the hallway and just have informal conversations with people.\n\nBut anyway, this session went on, and on, and on. It started at 7:00, and I didn't get to talk until 10 pm. Feynman was long gone. I had a terrible cold. I could barely speak audibly because I was so hoarse. But I gave the talk, and it went well. And again, that also helped to build confidence. And I gave similar talks at Harvard. And so, then I started to feel like I was ready to do serious research.\n\nZierler:\n\nIn what ways did this work feed into what ultimately would be your thesis research?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, what you might be surprised to hear is that the work I did in graduate school, which became well-known, which was about magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe, was not in my thesis at all. I wrote my thesis on something different. Actually, I think it's interesting that I drew on what I learned from Sidney Coleman and from Steve Weinberg to find my problem having to do with monopoles in the early universe. I was very interested in this idea that magnetic monopoles could be understood using topological ideas applied to unified gauge theories, and that Grand Unified theories should have these magnetic monopoles. But the question I remember discussing with some of the other students, Steve Parke was one of them, was, “Who cares? Because these things are so heavy, you'll never see them experimentally. They're completely irrelevant to any physics we'll be able to do in our lifetimes. So why are you even bothering to learn about these magnetic monopoles?”\n\nZierler:\n\nThis is the very early beginnings of Henry Tye’s and Alan Guth's collaboration. Were you aware of what they were doing? Did you know either of them?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, I knew Alan Guth, but I wasn't aware what they were doing until later. Alan Guth was an instructor at Princeton when I was an undergrad. And speaking of great instruction at Princeton, he taught a beautiful class on classical mechanics, which I took as a junior, Goldstein Classical Mechanics. And, really, he's one of the best lecturers. He was Coleman-caliber. And he was clearly working very, very hard on that class. He told me later he was putting an enormous amount of time into it, as I'm sure he must've been. And so, I knew him for that reason. He remembered me later as a student in that class.\n\nBut no, I didn't know that Guth and Tye were interested in the issue of production of magnetic monopoles in the early universe. And there were other things that I didn't know and found out later, which preceded my work. One was Kibble had written this paper in 1976 on topological defects that could be produced in a cosmological setting. His focus was mostly on cosmic strings. I didn't know about that at the time.\n\nAnd there was also a paper by Zeldovich and Khlopov about magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe. I didn't know about their work, either. But I started working on it myself. And Steve was not interested. I tried to explain it to him. “Look, there's something really interesting here,” speaking to Steve Weinberg. Grand Unified theories, we have reasons to believe they're the truth. They make this prediction, these very heavy magnetic monopoles. If there's a phase transition in the early universe, these could be created in such a phase transition, and they should still be around. In fact, there should be so many of them around that the universe would've been closed by monopoles, and it wouldn't look anything like the universe we inhabit. And first of all, he said, “Well, I'm not really sure about the magnetic monopoles existing, and I'm not really sure why I should believe you that they were produced in the early universe. This is all so speculative.”\n\nAnd it was a little discouraging that my PhD advisor thought I was barking up the wrong tree. But there were other people who did encourage me. Michael Peskin was one. And some people, I actually got some technical advice from. One was Bert Halperin, a condensed matter physicist, but he knew a lot about topological defects in the condensed matter setting. And he helped me to set up a calculation of how many of these monopoles would be created in a phase transition. And another was Ed Purcell, who was, of course, a wonderful man. And I knew Ed because I was TA for his quantum mechanics class. And he was very interested in magnetic monopoles, and in fact, had been involved in searches for them some years earlier, and followed subsequent efforts to detect magnetic monopoles or put limits on their abundance. And actually, there had been a little bit of a false alarm around the time I was entering graduate school. Price claimed to have detected a magnetic monopole in a cosmic ray event, which was later debunked by Luis Alvarez and others as just a misinterpretation of something that could be explained by more conventional phenomena.\n\nZierler:\n\nIt's almost too delicious to think of how, in some ways, Bert Halperin, as a condensed matter theorist, was more helpful in developing your dissertation idea than Steve Weinberg. Can you explain a little bit the science for how Bert's background might've actually been useful? Because at first glance, it's hard to see how condensed matter theory would be relevant for this line of inquiry.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, as I mentioned, what I thought was the most exciting thing in my first few years of graduate school that was happening was these topological ideas coming into particle physics, particularly in the theory of magnetic monopoles and instantons. But topological ideas were also becoming increasingly useful in condensed matter, where in different materials, there can be topological defects associated with spontaneous breaking of symmetries. Not usually gauge symmetries in the case of the magnetic monopoles. Well, actually, in the case of a superconductor, a vortex in a superconductor is an example of a topological defect in a gauge theory. That is sort of a prototypical example of such a topological defect. Bert knew everything about superconductors. He knew all about vortices. But also, there were point-like defects that occurred in three-dimensional materials like liquid crystals. And Bert knew about that, too.\n\nFurthermore, what I was interested in is what would happen if there was a phase transition in the early universe. If it's SU5, for example—which is the gauge group—it had been understood in the previous few years that at high temperature, even if the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken—if the Higgs phenomenon occurs at low temperature, at high temperature that symmetry would be restored. So, you would expect very early in the universe that the SU5 symmetry was still intact, but as the universe cooled, the symmetry breaking would occur. There might be a sequence of phase transitions, but there should at least at some point be a transition to the phase in which SU3 cross SU2 cross U1, the symmetry of the Standard Model, is the unbroken remaining gauge symmetry. And one could show that the breakdown of SU5 to the Standard Model would give rise to stable magnetic monopoles. The question was, how abundantly would they be created?\n\nAnd there were a couple of ways of looking at that, one of which was really the idea that Kibble had discussed, although I didn't know his paper at the time, which is that there's an order parameter, which is fluctuating around, you're in the symmetric phase, but then it freezes out. Like, for example, if you're cooling a material, and it goes from paramagnetic phase to a ferromagnetic phase, the magnetization locks in, and all the spins line up. And that is the same kind of phenomenon where the symmetry is restored at high temperature and then becomes spontaneously broken at a critical point.\n\nAnd I thought the same thing would happen in a unified gauge theory. And that that would give rise to the possibility of magnetic monopoles, for one thing, just because of relativistic causality. When the magnetization turns on, the magnetization at one point in space has no way of knowing to line up with the magnetization of another point in space because there hasn't been time for a light signal to travel between this domain and that domain. And so, as the spins start to line up, there will be knots that get locked in. Those are the topological defects. And that's how magnetic monopoles can form.\n\nI had that idea, but Bert told me a different idea, which was that even if the phase transition were a smooth phase transition, if it were second order, that because the order parameters would be fluctuating, you would expect to get a lot of defects, even not taking into account the effects of relativistic causality, and that's what he showed me how to calculate. Which, because I wound up writing a very short letter-length article, got squeezed down to, like, a paragraph or something without many details. That was another thing. Steve did give me one piece of advice. I asked him where I should publish the result that he didn't find very interesting, and he made a suggestion which really surprised me. He said Nature. The particle physics students didn't read Nature. That was where there were papers about astronomy and stuff like that, or biology. But Steve at least had the notion that there was something of broad interest about what I was doing because it related to cosmology, to particle physics, and even to condensed matter ideas.\n\nZierler:\n\nIt was of broad interest, but not particularly interesting to him.\n\nPreskill:\n\nNot interesting enough, but broad. [laugh] But Bert said, “No, Physical Review Letters would be better.” So that's where I submitted it, and it was rejected because first of all, it wasn't novel enough. It'd actually be interesting for me to dig up that referee report. I think I still have it. But also, that it didn't seem to be right because I had overestimated the abundance of the monopoles for some reason which the reviewer didn't explain. But the editors, to their credit, said, “Well, we'll give you a chance to respond and resubmit.” But it was a very bad day because I was already in my fourth year of graduate school. I had no papers. And this was my first one. And it got rejected. And I was pretty depressed. So, I remember my wife thought this would cheer me up—we went shopping, and we bought a color TV set. Up until then, our TV set was this little black and white TV set. And it did cheer me up a little to have a color TV. But anyway, I resubmitted the single-author paper, and it did get accepted.\n\nBut what really seems funny and odd to me, looking back, is that when I was applying for post-docs, I had no publications. I had this one preprint, the one about magnetic monopole production in the early universe. And nothing had been published, and that was it. And yet, that didn't seem to be too big an impediment to getting good post-doc offers because that one paper was getting a fair amount of attention. Now, coming back to Henry Tye and Alan Guth, after my preprint came out, Alan invited me to visit Cornell. I don't think Henry was there. I think he was traveling. It was during the summer.\n\nZierler:\n\nHe was probably in China at that point.\n\nPreskill:\n\nYeah, I think that's probably right. But Alan was there, and, of course, like I said, I knew him from my undergraduate days. And by that time, Michael Peskin was at Cornell. And I think Steve Shenker was there. Yeah, I think he was still a student there. Steve Shenker was there. And Ken Wilson. That was the first time I had a chance to sit-- Ken Wilson is one of my heroes. And although I had met him during his visit to Harvard, I'm sure he didn't know me. But during that visit, I got a chance to sit down with Ken and chat. I think that may be really the only time that we ever had a serious talk about physics, so that was memorable.\n\nZierler:\n\nDo you remember what you talked about?\n\nPreskill:\n\nYeah, magnetic monopoles. And actually, he thought my paper was wrong. And he thought it was wrong because he thought the magnetic monopoles would be confined. And he was wrong. And I'm not sure I convinced him.\n\nZierler:\n\nYou were confident at this point though.\n\nPreskill:\n\nI knew a lot about magnetic monopoles. Yeah. But anyway, I talked to Alan a lot. I don't remember, was their paper out yet? Not sure. But they had some of the same ideas, and I guess you've already talked to Alan. But I'd been pretty careful in analyzing if a significant number of monopoles were produced, how many of them would survive. And I had an argument, which I thought was pretty convincing, that unless something nonstandard happened in the cosmology, it just couldn't work, that the production of the monopoles was unavoidable. It would be copious, they wouldn't annihilate fast enough, and the universe would be closed by them many times over, and that couldn't be our cosmology, so there had to be some way out.\n\nAnd during the following fall, I probably should've thought about that more. Because I figured there had to be something about the phase transition that was unconventional. But by that time, I had gotten interested in a different topic, which is what I did end up writing my thesis on, which was technicolor, as we called it at the time. The breaking of electroweak symmetry by strong interaction. So, of course, Alan famously continued thinking about it and had the insight that inflation could blow the monopoles away, but he also, to his credit, realized that that could explain the flatness and isotropy of the universe. And, of course, that idea was very explosive when it came out. That paper had a lot of impact right away. I remember him coming to Harvard and giving a talk about it, which was received with a lot of excitement.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you see the transition to technicolor as switching gears? Was it related?\n\nPreskill:\n\nIt wasn't that closely related, but I thought the ideas were quite exciting. I was particularly inspired by a paper by Lenny Susskind, which is actually a little ironic because Steve Weinberg had written a related paper. He didn't call it technicolor, but he did call it dynamical breaking of electroweak symmetry, which is what it is. And his paper was, in a way, sort of typical Weinberg style. He calculated everything, and he correctly discussed all the issues. It was a little dry.\n\nAnd Lenny Susskind is also one of my heroes because of his creativity as a scientist, but also he's a very charismatic communicator in writing and in person. And this was an inspiring paper. And what he realized, which Weinberg had not, was something quite simple, which was, in the Weinberg-Salam Model, the so-called rho parameter, which basically says that the ratio of the W to Z mass is determined by the Weinberg mixing angle theta-W. Steve, by the way, always claimed the W in theta-W stood for weak, and he wouldn't call it the Weinberg angle. He called it the weak mixing angle, in a burst of modesty.\n\nBut at any rate, Murray Gell-Mann always liked to say in his snide way, “Oh, we call this angle theta-W because W stands for the last letter in the word Glashow.” [laugh] Anyway, Murray and Steve were not fans of one another. So what Lenny said in his paper was that you could understand how the Weinberg angle was related to the W of Z masses just from a symmetry consideration, and that in the dynamical symmetry breaking scenario, that symmetry would naturally be present, and that the dynamics that you needed was dynamics that we already understood fairly well from QCD—the breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD, which is responsible for the pion being much lighter than other hadrons. That could occur with this new strong interaction with a similar structure to QCD, but which becomes strong at a higher scale, at the weak scale like a TeV, or a few hundred GeV rather than a few hundred MeV, as in QCD. That could account for how the electroweak symmetries get broken. And Lenny called this new strong interaction “technicolor.”\n\nAnd what I found so appealing about this was that because it was dynamical, it should be highly constrained. One thing I found very curious and was very interested in, for some years, starting when I was in graduate school is, where do the quark and lepton masses come from? In the Standard Model, they're just free parameters. You write down Yukawa couplings, they can be anything, and those determine the mixing angles like the Cabibbo angle and the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, it's all free parameters. Same thing for all the masses. And what fun is that? You'd like to be able to explain where those masses come from. And I thought in a dynamical scenario, we'd be able to do that much better.\n\nI was very interested in those ideas for a couple of years, and it turned out that these dynamical scenarios are so constrained that it was very hard to come up with a viable phenomenology. Because you didn't have the same kind of freedom you do when you have Higgs fields, where you can choose Yukawa couplings to be whatever you want. Explaining the masses of the quarks, and leptons, and all that became very challenging. Actually, I'll tell you something funny. When I first came to Caltech, that was in 1983, I thought the important problem in particle physics was to explain those quark and lepton masses. I thought, “If we could do that, if we could understand what that hint was telling us, that would be a good path to understanding what's beyond the Standard Model.”\n\nAnd so, to remind myself that was important, I made a chart which showed all the masses, the spectrum of quarks and leptons, and I posted it in my office on the bulletin board so I'd see it every day to remind me, “This is the important thing to think about.” And then, a couple of years went by, and one day, I was talking to Mark Wise in my office, who occupied the office next door, and we looked at that chart, which had been on the bulletin board, roasting in the sun every afternoon, and the masses had all faded away. They'd been bleached by the sun. And we took that to be some kind of metaphor for how this problem somehow was too elusive to admit an easy solution. And by that time, I wasn't thinking about it anymore.\n\nZierler:\n\nI want to ask, at this point, when you're really starting to solidify your identity in theoretical physics, going from magnetic monopoles to technicolor, did you feel at the time that you dipped a toe into cosmology, and then went sort of back to your home intellectual environment of particle theory?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, yeah. I don't know if I looked at it that way. But because I got excited about technicolor, I sort of dropped the cosmology ball for a while and focused on technicolor. My interest in cosmology got reactivated partly because of another experimental false alarm. In 1982, Blas Cabrera thought he saw a magnetic monopole. It was on Valentine's Day, 1982. I was still at Harvard. By then, I was on the faculty. And that seemed incredible and really exciting. And hard to explain. He had this little loop of superconducting wire and saw the flux jump, which he interpreted as evidence that a magnetic monopole had passed through the loop. And so, one needed to understand why magnetic monopoles would be plentiful enough for Blas Cabrera to detect one, and at the same time, not do other things, which the astrophysicists told us would be bad. Parker, in particular, had gotten a bound on the abundance of monopoles from observing that if there's a magnetic monopole plasma in the galaxy, it'll short out the galactic magnetic field on some time scale short compared to the galactic rotation time, which cranks up the dynamo.\n\nAnd so, was there something wrong with that argument? Guess that wasn't really cosmology. But at any rate, we did realize that if the monopoles were very heavy, the story was changed because Parker had assumed they got relativistic velocities, which for the types of monopoles predicted by grand unified theories, needn't be the case. They'd more likely have typical virial velocities in the galaxy like 10 to the minus 3 c. Of course, it turned out Blas Cabrera never saw another magnetic monopole. But it was exciting for a while. And actually, that helped to elevate my star a little bit maybe because now everybody was excited about magnetic monopoles and where they came from. And I was asked to give talks about that and things like that.\n\nZierler:\n\nTo clarify, when you say that Cabrera never saw another one, is that to suggest it's possible that what he saw was a magnetic monopole?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, it seems extremely unlikely, right? Because he would've had to be incredibly lucky to see that one and be consistent with other bounds we have on the flux. So no, I don't think he ever explained, or at least never publicly explained, what went wrong or what the right interpretation was of the event he saw. But no, it wasn't a magnetic monopole, sad to say.\n\nYeah, so then, the next foray into cosmology which had some impact concerned axions and predicting that they could potentially be the dark matter. And probably Alan Guth told you about this workshop, the Nuffield Workshop in 1982 in Cambridge. I was there. It was organized by Stephen Hawking and Gary Gibbons. It was a pretty exciting event. And the big topic there was whether inflation could explain the origin of galaxies by seeding the density perturbations from which galaxies grew. And there was a lot of disagreement at the beginning of that three-week workshop about what inflation predicted.\n\nAnd I'm sure you discussed this with Alan, but after the idea of inflation, which seemed very exciting, trouble was brewing because how inflation ended was unclear. And Alan and others had done computations of how as bubbles of true vacuum appeared in the false vacuum in a phase transition, whether those bubbles would succeed in filling up the universe and giving rise to a reheated universe that would then be described by Big Bang cosmology, and he couldn't get this to work. But then, around I guess it must've been the end of 1981, the idea by Andrei Linde, and Albrecht and Steinhardt, that instead of having to go through a barrier, the universe could sort of roll off the table to end inflation. The energy density would be high because you'd be on a plateau of a potential function, but rolling along, and then you'd start to oscillate in the potential after you roll off this flat part. And that would give rise to reheating.\n\nSo, what everybody was interested in was what kind of perturbations of density would be produced in that transition from the inflationary phase to the more standard radiation-dominated phase. And so, Alan, and Starobinsky, and Turner, Steinhardt, and Bardeen, and Hawking, they were all trying to calculate those things. So that was sort of the focal point of excitement. But I went there to talk about magnetic monopoles and to think about what axions might have to do with cosmology. And Frank Wilczek was there, too, who had an interest in axions, as the founder of them—\n\nActually, just to backpedal for a second, this is sort of a funny story. Or maybe, I don't know, sort of a typical experience of a graduate student. In the fall of 1977, I crank up my courage, and I go to see Steve Weinberg. I'd like suggestions for a research problem to work on. And so, he responded immediately with the thing that he was thinking about that day. What was it? Well, he had just read this paper by Peccei and Quinn that would explain potentially the solution to the strong CP problem, why CP is a very good symmetry of the strong interactions. And their idea has something to do with the Higgs sector, and how you can introduce another Higgs field, and that can help. “So what might be interesting to work out is, what's the phenomenology of this type of model with more than one Higgs field?”\n\nSo, I thought that sounded interesting. So, like any graduate student would, I spent the next couple of weeks reading everything I could find on Higgs phenomenology. But then, Steve, after a few weeks, announced he was giving a seminar, and he explained the idea, which we now called the axion. He actually called it the Higglet, because it was a little Higgs, a light Higgs, at the time.\n\nZierler:\n\nThe Higglet never caught on.\n\nPreskill:\n\n[laugh] Higglet didn't catch on. And Frank's good at names, isn't he?\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nPreskill:\n\nAnd so, Steve was trying to figure out at that point whether the Higglet was ruled out by experiments that had already been done. But I was a little miffed because I thought, “Boy, Steve suggested this problem. Why didn't he tell me that he was making progress? And here I am, spending every waking hour learning about Higgs phenomenology, so I'll be ready to dive in.” But, of course, I'm sure Steve didn't give it another thought. I doubt he remembered that he had even mentioned it to me. I just happened to walk into his office at the time he was looking at the paper or something. Anyway, I was reminded of that. [laugh]\n\nZierler:\n\nWhile we're still on graduate school, who was on your committee?\n\nPreskill:\n\nWeinberg, Coleman, Georgi, and Estia Eichten, who was junior faculty at Harvard at that time. I do have a very disturbing memory of my exam, actually. You're not going to believe it when I tell you this, probably. Well, here's the thing. I didn't understand what a PhD defense was. Somehow, I didn't realize I was expected to give a presentation. How could I have not known this? All the other students seemed to know it. So, I thought, “Well, they've all read my thesis, and they'll come in, and they'll ask me questions about it.” I had nothing prepared. My thesis was related to technicolor. Didn't have anything to do with cosmology and magnetic monopoles. But actually, it was something Steve was very interested in.\n\nI'll tell you something funny about that, too. It was very Weinbergian, what I did. I studied what's called the vacuum alignment problem. And what that means is, you have spontaneous symmetry breaking, but you also have some explicit breaking of the symmetry. And the explicit breaking of the symmetry determines which of the degenerate vacua will actually get preferred. If you have a ferromagnet, and you turn on a small magnetic field, then the lower energy vacuum will be the true vacuum. And so, in this case, I had some global symmetries, but then because I also introduced gauge interactions, that explicitly broke some of those symmetries. And the interesting thing was that the way that the symmetry breaking aligned with the gauge symmetry gave rise to some phenomenological predictions, that there would be light mesons coming from the technicolor sector that you might be able to see in collider experiments and stuff like that.\n\nAnd I gave a talk about this in early 1980 at Harvard. And Steve was there, and he seemed enthusiastic about it. And then, maybe a month or two later. Now, I mentioned Michael Peskin earlier. Michael, that year, the 1979-1980 academic year, was spending the year in France at Saclay as a visitor, and he had written a paper on a very similar topic with very similar conclusions while he was in France, and I hadn't been communicating with him. And he sent it to Weinberg. And so, I don't remember exactly why, but I came into Steve's office, and he said, “I have this paper from Peskin. It's very interesting, and he does blah, blah, blah.” And I said, “But, Steve, that's what I talked about at that seminar two months ago.” He didn't remember that at all. Later, maybe he recollected, he was apologetic about expressing that enthusiasm about Peskin's paper without realizing that much of it overlapped with the content of my thesis.\n\nSo anyway, that's what was in the thesis, so I figured I had a receptive audience because I knew Howard was also quite interested, and Estia, too. But I didn't prepare anything. And Arthur Jaffe also came, and he brought Cliff Taubes, who was his graduate student and was actually my officemate. And Cliff became a famous topologist. He’s won many awards, and he's a great mathematician now. They thought I was going to talk about magnetic monopoles, which they were both interested in, so they came in to hear my talk. And I just got up there, and Steve said, “OK, now you can begin.” And I thought, “What”\" I had nothing prepared. So I just started mumbling about what was in my thesis very stream-of-consciousness. It must've been excruciating to listen to. And that was my PhD exam.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut you survived. You lived to tell the tale.\n\nPreskill:\n\nI lived, yeah. But I try not to think about it. But that's what really happened.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas the game plan to stay at Harvard already buttoned up before your defense?\n\nPreskill:\n\nYes. So, I became a junior fellow after my PhD in the Harvard Society of Fellows. The Society of Fellows, at least in those days, would appoint eight new fellows every year, and they were in all fields. Not just science, in fact, humanities as well. But it was kind of typical to have one or two theoretical physicists in a class, and pretty often, they were Harvard graduate students, not always, who became junior fellows. Some of my predecessors the previous year or two were Paul Steinhardt, who got a Harvard PhD and became a junior fellow, and also Ian Affleck, who later became a very distinguished condensed matter theorist, though he was doing particle theory at the time. So, in my year, I became a junior fellow, and also in that same year was Mark Wise, who became a good friend. He had been a graduate student with Fred Gilman at Stanford. And Cliff Taubes, who was doing topology. We were all junior fellows together.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas your sense that the Society was essentially finishing school to see if you could elevate to become a Harvard professor?\n\nPreskill:\n\nI didn't really look at it that way because it was so rare for junior fellows, or even Harvard junior faculty, to become tenured professors.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo as naive as you were about what a thesis defense was, you clearly understood the culture of not promoting from within at Harvard.\n\nPreskill:\n\nOh, that was well-known. Although, actually, we used to joke about it, the students, because we were aware that there had been, in recent years, strong assistant professors doing excellent research who had not gotten tenure at Harvard. Tom Applequist was one who was a couple years ahead of when I arrived. And actually, I had two collaborators who were junior faculty while I was in graduate school, Estia Eichten and Ken Lane. And there was not any serious expectation that they would become tenured professors at Harvard, and they didn't. But, of course, they both went on to good careers. And that was the typical pattern with the Harvard junior faculty, and with the junior fellows, that they would usually go elsewhere and be successful. Now, I did something unusual. I was a junior fellow for only one year, even though it was a three-year appointment. I became an assistant professor and then an associate professor in the following two years.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd, of course, the associate professor is not tenured.\n\nPreskill:\n\nNo, and I didn't really think it was likely that I would get tenure, and I wound up going to Caltech.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut to be promoted to associate is an indication that it's a step in the right direction.\n\nPreskill:\n\nWell, maybe so. But actually, what happened was this. My wife had just gotten her business degree at MIT at the Sloan School, what everybody else calls an MBA, but they call a Master's of Science in Management, and she was working at a company that seemed like a real up-and-coming company, Digital Equipment Corporation, which made the VAX minicomputer and other products. And it looked like she was off to a great start in her career, and we wanted to have the flexibility of staying in the Boston area longer. And I thought if I transitioned into the junior faculty slot, although it would mean I'd have to teach and other stuff, we would at least have the flexibility to stick around longer. As it turned out, I didn't do that. I was only at Harvard for three years.\n\nActually, I remember I was visiting Santa Barbara. This was at the very beginnings of what was then the Institute for Theoretical Phy"
