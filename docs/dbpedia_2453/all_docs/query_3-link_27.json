        "text": "Turing's work on computability, extending those of Goedel and the other early logicians, paved the way for the development of modern computers. Before Turing and Goedel, the concept of computability was murky. It was Turing who realized that there could be a universal computer---a computer whose hardware does not have to be separately modified for every change in application. Although we all take this for granted now, as we install various programs on our laptop computers, the mathematical idea of it was and is profound. Turing's early work introduced the formal concept of subroutines in computation, computational languages, and so on, which laid the groundwork for the later development of computers as we know them.\n\nThe work of Oliver Heaviside and Laplace put the electrical theories in a firm footing.\n\nHeaviside invented an operational calculus for solving differential equations arising out of electrical network analysis, which was justified rigorously later by Laplace Transforms(but which makes full sense only incorporating the theory of distributions).\n\nThis might not seem important enough historically. But, all power generation, motors, the light you have in your room, and indeed all uses of electricity were able to be set up properly thanks to the work of these people, and the midnight oil they burned. We wouldn't have computers or MO without electricity distribution everywhere, for instance.\n\nEvery time I see a question like this I am reminded of something V.I. Arnold wrote, which I take the liberty of quoting here:\n\nAll mathematics is divided into three parts: cryptography (paid for by CIA, KGB and the like), hydrodynamics (supported by manufacturers of atomic submarines) and celestial mechanics (financed by military and by other institutions dealing with missiles, such as NASA.).\n\nCryptography has generated number theory, algebraic geometry over finite fields, algebra \\footnote{The creator of modern algebra, Vi`ete, was the cryptographer of King Henry~I/V of France.}, combinatorics and computers.\n\nHydrodynamics procreated complex analysis, partial derivative equations, Lie groups and algebra theory, cohomology theory and scientific computing.\n\nCelestial mechanics is the origin of dynamical systems, linear algebra, topology, variational calculus and symplectic geometry.\n\nThe existence of mysterious relations between all these different domains is the most striking and delightful feature of mathematics (having no rational explanation).\n\nThe idea that new knowledge can be obtained by careful deduction from previous truths has in my opinion had an enormous impact on european history and is certainly not a trivial one. Be it found in the work of Plato (think of the Meno, the Theaetetus or the famous warning sign in the Academy), Aristotle, Descartes (whose prime example of analysis in the philosophical sense was the derivation of the equation of the tangent to a curve), Spinoza (Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata), Kant (with his discussion of analytic and synthetic knowledge) or even arguably in modern guise, this idea has been tied to mathematics.\n\nConsequently, if I were to teach such a class, I would first try to convey how crucial the ideas of Plato, Bacon, Descartes, Galileo, Newton, Kant (and so on...) have been in shaping the way we think about society, politics, moral, history, even religion. Then I would try to convince my audience that these ideas have been intrinsically linked with contemporary mathematical thoughts, and ultimately with the concept of proof and reasoning as understood in mathematics.\n\nSo perhaps my suggestion for the most influential mathematical idea in terms of what has influenced science/history or changed the way humans think would be the idea that mathematics is possible, and that playing this game of proving theorems is in fact a deeply worthy activity.\n\nStructuralism in mathematics. It may have started in linguistics, but it reached mathematics next, promoted largely through Weil and Bourbaki, category theory, and then the grand vision of Grothendieck. Structuralism is not so much a single mathematical idea as a way of thinking about properties and definitions, what mathematical objects are, and how we should study them. The ideas expanded out from mathematics swiftly, and in the course of 20th century intellectual development, it is hard to find an idea as pervasive and influential as the structuralist approach.\n\n(There is a book by Amir Aczel on Bourbaki that some of the story. I found the book to be unfortunately rather poorly written, but informative nonetheless.)\n\nStructuralism is literally everywhere. It contains the idea the objects are characterised by their relationships relative to all other objects, rather than having an inherent identity of their own. For example, one sees an element of this in passing from old notions of groups and collections of transformations of something to the more abstract notion of a set equipped with the structure of a group multiplication law. Through Levi-Strauss, structuralism was introduced into anthropology. It created a large school of thought in history, sociology, political science, and so on.\n\nUp above, I see that the Google PageRank algorithm was mentioned. One can view this as an example of structuralism in action - the rank of a website is computed by the algorithm as a certain function of its relationship to all other websites rather than as a function of the content of the site itself.\n\nAnalytic geometry, both in the sense of Fermat and Descartes, and in the modern sense of \"Feynman diagrams\" encrypting algebraic axioms. Certainly the former precedes Wallis, Newton, and Leibniz, and from a modern perspective, it seems trivial, too trivial to mention. But that geometric problems can be dealt with analytically (algebraically), and vice versa, helped formulate and inform the revolutions of science.\n\nI agree that we have not yet understood the role that algebraic diagrammatics play in our understanding of mathematics, physics, or even how they will affect the average person in the street. However, I will be surprised if they are not at least as important as the use of arrows to indicate functions. (They are a generalization thereof).\n\nCan you say something about the audience of this course? Popular math? Undergrads? grads? That might set some appropriate response parameters.\n\nIf this were a graduate-level course (I suspect not, but I feel like addressing this option anyway :)), I'd probably point to categories, sheaves, and cohomology -- and maybe just \"cohomology\" as a general concept, if I had to pick one. Also, the link provided by algebraic geometry between manifolds, varieties, and commutative algebra.\n\nFor an undergraduate non-major course, I don't think there's any way of overstating the historical significance of calculus. The scope of problems, both mathematical and physical, that were instantaneously solvable by mathematicians all over the world after its development and deployment, was mind-boggling.\n\nI think there are probably more important ideas than those above if the scope of the question is how much impact they've had on humanities' development (e.g., development of serious linear algebra would certainly go in there for applications to just about everything, someone else mentioned RSA), but the above are my votes for ideas that have changed the way that people (or at least mathematicians) have thought about mathematics.\n\nA couple of years ago, I saw a talk by Keith Devlin around his book The unfinished game. In his talk, the three revolutions were (and excuse me as I butcher this a little bit, this is from memory)\n\nnumbering systems\n\nmeasurements (Galileo)\n\nprobability theory\n\nSo where's calculus and algebra and geometry? The argument was that these three have entered everyone's life to stay. Everyone uses numbers daily, measures things (temperature, speed), and talks about probabilities (chances of rain and so on).\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean that people do any of this well, are aware of the intricacies involved, or, for probabilities, have a good intuition. But the point is that these revolutions now completely permeate everyday life (unlike calculus!) to the extent that it is very difficult to imagine what went on in people's minds before these inventions came on the scene. (If you've ever tried to do euclidean geometry by requiring that numbers can only be described as proportions of physical magnitudes, you know what I mean.)\n\nThe thought-provoking part of course is that the first two items don't seem to belong at all in the same order of mathematics as probability."
