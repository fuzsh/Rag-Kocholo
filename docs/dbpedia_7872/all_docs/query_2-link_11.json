        "text": "REPRINTED with permission from Voice of America News\n\nBy Navbahor Imamova\n\nWASHINGTON -- U.S.-based diplomats from Central Asia, a region long dominated by Russia and more recently China, say they are eager for more engagement with the United States.\n\nMany American foreign policy experts agree that a more robust relationship would be mutually beneficial, though U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations express deep concerns about human rights and authoritarian rule in the five countries: Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nMichael Delaney, a former U.S. trade official, argued in favor of greater engagement this week at a webinar organized by the American-Uzbekistan Chamber of Commerce.\n\nHe noted that three of the five republics are World Trade Organization members and the other two are in the accession process — a goal actively encouraged by the U.S. government.\n\n\"I've always believed that this is a geographically disadvantaged area. There are relatively small national economies,\" he said. But, he said, collectively the region represents a potentially more connected market, about 80 million people.\n\nKey issues\n\nIn this virtual gathering, all five Central Asian ambassadors to Washington expressed eagerness to work on issues the U.S. has long pushed for, such as water and energy sustainability, security cooperation, environmental protection and climate, and connectivity.\n\nKazakhstan's Ambassador Yerzhan Ashikbayev said that despite all factors, the United States does not want to leave the field to China, its global competitor, which actively invests in the region.\n\n\"Recent visit by 20 companies to Kazakhstan as a part of certified U.S. trade mission, including technology giants like Apple, Microsoft, Google, but also other partners like Boeing, have shown a growing interest,\" Ashikbayev said.\n\nThe Kazakh diplomat described a \"synergy\" of economies and diplomatic efforts. All Central Asian states are committed to dialogue, trade and multilateralism, he said. \"As we are witnessing the return of the divisive bloc mentalities almost unseen for 30 years, it's in our best interest to prevent Central Asia from turning into another battleground of global powers.\"\n\nDuring his first tour of Central Asia earlier this year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, meeting separately with the foreign ministers of all five countries.\n\nThat was deeply appreciated, said Meret Orazov, Turkmenistan's longtime ambassador, who also praised the regular bilateral consultations the U.S. holds with these countries.\n\nUzbek Ambassador Furqat Sidiqov sees the U.S. as an important partner, with \"long-standing friendship and cooperation which have only grown stronger over the years.\"\n\n\"The U.S. has played a significant role in promoting dialogue and cooperation among the Central Asian nations through initiatives such as the C5+1,\" he said, referring to a diplomatic platform comprising Washington and the region's five governments.\n\n\"This is where we address common concerns and enhance integration,\" said Sidiqov. \"We encourage the U.S. to bolster this mechanism.\"\n\nTashkent regards Afghanistan as key to Central Asia's development, potentially linking the landlocked region to the markets and seaports of South Asia. Sidiqov said his country counts on American assistance.\n\n'Possibility of positive change'\n\nFred Starr, chairman of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute in Washington, ardently advocates for the U.S. to adopt closer political, economic and people-to-people ties with the region.\n\nIn a recent paper, he wrote that among dozens of officials, diplomats, entrepreneurs, experts, journalists and civil society leaders interviewed in Central Asia, \"even those most critical of American positions saw the possibility of positive change and … all acknowledged that the need for change is on both sides, theirs as well as ours.\"\n\nThis is the only region that doesn't have its own organization, said Starr, arguing that the U.S. could support this effort. \"We have not done so, probably because we think that this is somehow going to interfere with their relations with their other big neighbors, the north and east, but it's not going to. It's not against anyone.\"\n\n\"Easy to do, low cost, very big outcome,\" he added, also underscoring that \"there is a feeling the U.S. should be much more attentive to security.\"\n\n\"Japan, the European Union, Russia, China, their top leaders have visited. … No U.S. president has ever set foot in Central Asia,\" he said. He added that regional officials are left to wonder, \"Are we so insignificant that they can't take the time to visit?\"\n\nStarr urges U.S. President Joe Biden to convene the C5+1 in New York during the 78th session of the U.N. General Assembly in September. \"This would not be a big drain on the president's time, but it would be symbolically extremely important,\" he said. \"All of them want this to happen.\"\n\nRead at VOA News\n\nWhy Russians Support the War: Jeffrey Gedmin interviews S. Frederick Starr on the resurgence of Imperial Russia.\n\nThe American Purpose, May 23, 2023\n\nJeffrey Gedmin: Do we have a Putin problem or a Russia problem today?\n\nS. Frederick Starr: We have a Putin problem because we have a Russia problem. Bluntly, the mass of Russians are passive and easily manipulated—down to the moment they aren’t. Two decades ago they made a deal with Vladimir Putin, as they have done with many of his predecessors: You give us a basic income, prospects for a better future, and a country we can take pride in, and we will give you a free hand. This is the same formula for autocracy that prevailed in Soviet times, and, before that, under the czars. The difference is that this time Russia’s leader—Putin—and his entourage have adopted a bizarre and dangerous ideology, “Eurasianism,” that empowers them to expand Russian power at will over the entire former territory of the USSR and even beyond. It is a grand and awful vision that puffs up ruler and ruled alike.\n\nWhat do most Russians think of this deal? It leaves them bereft of the normal rights of citizenship but free from its day-to-day responsibilities. So instead of debating, voting, and demonstrating, Russians store up their frustrations and then release them in elemental, often destructive, and usually futile acts of rebellion. This “Russia problem” leaves the prospect of change in Russia today in the hands of alienated members of Putin’s immediate entourage, many of whom share his vision of Russia’s destiny and are anyway subject to Putin’s ample levers for control. Thus, our “Putin problem” arises from our “Russia problem.”\n\nClick to continue reading..."
