        "text": "Yul Brynner: A Biography\n\nFamily Photos\n\nYuliy Borisovich Bryner, Yul Brynner Юлий Борисович Бринер, (July 11, 1920 – October 10, 1985) was a Russian stage and film actor. He was best known for his portrayal of Mongkut, king of Siam, in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor for the film version; he also played the role more than 4,500 times onstage. He is also remembered as-:\n\nRameses II in the 1956 Cecil B. DeMille blockbuster The Ten Commandments,\n\nGeneral Bounine in Anastasia and\n\nChris Adams in The Magnificent Seven.\n\nBrynner was noted for his distinctive voice and for his shaven head, which he maintained as a personal trademark long after adopting it for his initial role in The King and I. He was also a photographer and the author of two books.\n\nIn 1952 he received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of The King in The King and I (musical).\n\n1956 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the King of Siam in The King and I\n\n1957 \"Top 10 Stars of the Year\" list\n\n1958 \"Top 10 Stars of the Year\" list\n\n1985 Special Tony Award honoring his 4,525 performances in The King and I.\n\nEarly life\n\nYul Brynner was born Yuliy Borisovich Bryner in 1920. He exaggerated his background and early life for the press, claiming that he was born Taidje Khan of part-Mongol parentage, on the Russian island of Sakhalin. In reality, he was born at home in a four-storey residence at 15 Aleutskaya Street, Vladivostok, in the Far Eastern Republic (present-day Primorsky Krai, Russia). He also occasionally referred to himself as Julius Briner, Jules Bryner, or Youl Bryner. A biography written by his son, Rock Brynner, in 1989 clarified these issues.\n\nHis father, Boris Yuliyevich Bryner, was a mining engineer whose father, Jules Bryner, was Swiss, and whose mother, Natalya Iosifovna Kurkutova, was a native of Irkutsk and was partly of Buryat ancestry. His mother, Marousia Dimitrievna (née Blagovidova), came from the intelligentsia and studied to be an actress and singer; she was the granddaughter of a doctor who had converted from Judaism to the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nHe also had a strong personal connection to the Romani people, thanks to his close association with the Dmitrievitch family, with whom he performed in Paris night clubs in the 1930s. In 1977, he was named Honorary President of the International Romani Union, an office that he kept until his death.\n\nAfter Boris Bryner abandoned his family, his mother took Yul and his sister, Vera Bryner, to Harbin, Manchuria (present day China), where they attended a school run by the YMCA. In 1934 she took them to Paris. By 1940, Brynner had returned to China and he emigrated from Dairen aboard the S.S. President Cleveland, arriving in the U.S. October 25, 1940. During World War II, Brynner worked as a French-speaking radio announcer and commentator for the U.S. Office of War Information, broadcasting propaganda to occupied France.\n\nCareer\n\nYul Brynner began acting and modeling in his twenties and early in his career he was photographed nude by George Platt Lynes. After his radio work during World War II Brynner moved into the nascent television industry, directing and acting in live productions in New York. In 1949 Brynner made his film debut in Port of New York, his only film with his natural head of hair.\n\nHis best-known role remains that of King Mongkut of Siam in the Broadway production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical The King and I which he played 4,525 times on stage over the span of his career. He appeared in the original production and later touring productions as well as a 1977 Broadway revival, London Production in 1979 and another Broadway revival in 1985. He also appeared in the film version for which he won an Academy Award as Best Actor and in a short-lived TV version (Anna and the King) on CBS in 1972. Brynner is one of only nine people who have won both a Tony Award and an Academy Award for the same role. His connection to the story and the role of King Mongkut is so deep he was mentioned in the song \"One Night in Bangkok\" from the 1984 musical Chess whose second act is set in Bangkok.\n\nIn 1951 Brynner shaved his head for his role in The King and I. Following the huge success of the Broadway production and subsequent film, Brynner continued to shave his head for the rest of his life though he would sometimes wear a wig for certain roles. Brynner's shaved head was very unusual at the time and his striking appearance helped to give him an iconic appeal.[15] Some fans shaved off their hair to emulate him, and a shaved head was often referred to as the \"Yul Brynner look\".\n\nBrynner made an immediate impact upon launching his mainstream film career in 1956 and quickly gained superstar status after appearing not only in The King and I that year but also in starring roles in The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston which remains one of the top five highest grossing films in history when adjusted for inflation and Anastasia with Ingrid Bergman. Brynner, at 5'10\", was reportedly concerned about being overshadowed by Heston's height and physical presence in The Ten Commandments and prepared his impressive physique seen in the film with an intensive weight-lifting program.\n\nHe later starred in films such as the epic Solomon and Sheba (1959), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Taras Bulba (1962) and Kings of the Sun (1963). He co-starred with Marlon Brando in Morituri (1965), Katharine Hepburn in The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969) and William Shatner in a film version of The Brothers Karamazov (1958). He played the titular role of The Ultimate Warrior (1975) and starred with Barbara Bouchet in Death Rage (1976). Among his final feature film appearances were in Michael Crichton's Westworld (1973) and its sequel Futureworld (1976). Brynner also appeared in drag (as a torch singer) in an unbilled role in the Peter Sellers comedy The Magic Christian (1969).\n\nPhotographer, author, and musician\n\nIn addition to his work as a performer, Brynner was an active photographer and wrote two books. His daughter Victoria put together Yul Brynner: Photographer (ISBN 0-8109-3144-3) a collection of his photographs of family, friends, and fellow actors, as well as those he took while serving as a UN special consultant on refugees. Brynner wrote Bring Forth the Children: A Journey to the Forgotten People of Europe and the Middle East (1960) with photographs by himself and Magnum photographer Inge Morath and also The Yul Brynner Cookbook: Food Fit for the King and You (1983 ISBN 0-8128-2882-8).\n\nA student of music from childhood, Brynner was an accomplished guitarist and singer. In his early period in Europe he often played and sang gypsy songs in Parisian nightclubs with Aliosha Dimitrievitch. He sang some of those same songs in the film The Brothers Karamazov. In 1967 he and Dimitrievitch released a record album The Gypsy and I: Yul Brynner Sings Gypsy Songs (Vanguard VSD 79265).\n\nPersonal life\n\nBrynner was married four times, the first three ending in divorce. He fathered three children and adopted two. He and his first wife, actress Virginia Gilmore (1944–1960), had one child, Rock Yul Brynner, born on December 23, 1946. His father nicknamed him \"Rock\" when he was six in honor of boxer Rocky Graziano. Rock is a historian, novelist, and university history lecturer at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York and Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Connecticut. In 2006, Rock wrote a book about his father and his family history titled Empire and Odyssey: The Brynners in Far East Russia and Beyond. Rock regularly returns to Vladivostok, the city of his father's birth, for the \"Pacific Meridian\" Film Festival.\n\nHis daughter Lark Brynner (born 1959) was born out of wedlock and raised by her mother, Frankie Tilden, who was 20 years old when her daughter was born. Brynner supported her financially. His second wife, from 1960 to 1967, Doris Kleiner, was a Chilean model whom he married on the set during shooting of The Magnificent Seven in 1960. They had one child, Victoria Brynner (born November 1962), whose godmother was Audrey Hepburn.\n\nHis third wife, Jacqueline Thion de la Chaume (1971–1981), was a French socialite, the widow of Philippe de Croisset (the victim of a car accident; he was the son of French playwright Francis de Croisset and a publishing executive). Brynner and Jacqueline adopted two Vietnamese children: Mia (1974), and Melody (1975). The first house that he ever owned was the Manoir de Cricqueboeuf, a sixteenth-century manor house that he and Jacqueline purchased.\n\nAt the age of 63, he married his fourth wife, Kathy Lee, a 24-year-old ballerina from a small town in Malaysia whom he had met in a production of The King and I in which she had a small dancing role. They remained married for the last 2 years (1983–1985) of Brynner's life.\n\nAccording to Marlene Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva (as she wrote in her memoir Marlene Dietrich, 1994), he had a passionate affair with the famous actress during the first production of The King and I.\n\nCitizenship\n\nBrynner, a Russian-born citizen, renounced his naturalized US citizenship in June 1965 at the US Embassy in Berne, Switzerland for tax reasons. He had lost his tax exemption as an American resident abroad by working too long in the U.S. and would have been bankrupted by his tax and penalty debt.\n\nDeath\n\nBrynner died of lung cancer on October 10, 1985 in New York City, the same day as his Battle of Neretva co-star Orson Welles.\n\nKnowing he was dying of cancer, Brynner starred in a run of farewell performances of his most famous role, The King and I, on Broadway from January 7 to June 30, 1985, with Mary Beth Peil as Anna Leonowens. His last performance marked the 4,633rd time he had played the role of the King.\n\nThroughout his life Brynner was often seen with a cigarette in his hand. In January 1985, nine months before his death, he gave an interview on Good Morning America, expressing his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial. A clip from that interview was made into a public service announcement by the American Cancer Society and released after his death. It includes the warning \"Now that I'm gone, I tell you don't smoke. Whatever you do, just don't smoke. If I could take back that smoking, we wouldn't be talking about any cancer. I'm convinced of that.\" This advertisement is now featured in the Body Worlds exhibition.\n\nHis remains are interred in France on the grounds of the Saint-Michel-de-Bois-Aubry Russian Orthodox monastery near Luzé between Tours and Poitiers.\n\nYul Brynner Park\n\nOn September 28th, 2012, an eight-foot-tall statue was inaugurated at Yul Brynner Park, in front of the home where he was born at Aleutskaya St. No. 15 in Vladivostok, Russia. Created by local sculptor Alexei Bokiy, the monument was carved in granite from China. The grounds for the park were donated by the city of Vladivostok, which also paid additional costs. Vladivostok Mayor Igor Pushkariov, U.S. Consul General Sylvia Curran, and Rock Brynner participated in the ceremony, along with hundreds of city residents.\n\nBrynner has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6162 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nThe cottage at his childhood country home, at Sidimi near Vladivostok, is now a family museum.\n\nAwards\n\nIn 1952 he received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of The King in The King and I (musical).\n\nHe won the 1956 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the King of Siam in The King and I and made the \"Top 10 Stars of the Year\" list in both 1957 and 1958.\n\nIn 1985 he received a Special Tony Award honoring his 4,525 performances in The King and I.\n\nFilmography\n\n▪ Port of New York (1949)\n\n▪ The King and I (1956)\n\n▪ The Ten Commandments (1956)\n\n▪ Anastasia (1956)\n\n▪ The Brothers Karamazov (1958)\n\n▪ The Buccaneer (1958)\n\n▪ The Journey (1959)\n\n▪ The Sound and the Fury (1959)\n\n▪ Solomon and Sheba (1959)\n\n▪ Once More, with Feeling!

His mother, Marousia Dimitrievna (née Blagovidova), came from the intelligentsia and studied to be an actress and singer. He felt a strong personal connection to the Romani people; in 1977, Yul Brynner was named Honorary President of the International Romani Union, an office that he kept until his death.[8][9] Boris Briner's work required extensive travel, and in 1923 he fell in love with an actress, Katya Kornukova, at the Moscow Art Theatre, and soon after abandoned his family. Yul's mother took him and his sister, Vera (born 1916), to Harbin, Manchuria (present day China), where they attended a school run by the YMCA. In 1932, fearing a war between China and Japan, she took them to Paris.[7] Brynner played his guitar in Russian nightclubs in Paris, sometimes accompanying his sister, playing Russian and gypsy songs. He trained as a trapeze acrobat and worked in a French circus troupe for three years, and had a brief flirtation with professional Soccer for PSG, but after sustaining a back injury, he turned to acting.[7][10] In 1938, his mother was diagnosed with leukemia, and they briefly moved back to Harbin.[7] In 1940, speaking very little English, Brynner and his mother emigrated to the US aboard the S.S. President Cleveland, arriving in New York City on October 25, 1940, where his sister already lived.[3][7] Vera, a singer, starred in The Consul on Broadway in 1950[11] and appeared at The Metropolitan Opera as Prince Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus and on television in the title role of Carmen. She later taught voice in New York.[12] Career[edit]\n\nDuring World War II, Brynner worked as a French-speaking radio announcer and commentator for the US Office of War Information, broadcasting propaganda to occupied France.[13] At the same time, he studied acting in Connecticut with the Russian teacher Michael Chekhov. Brynner’s first Broadway performance was a small part in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night in December 1941. Brynner found little acting work during the next few years,[7] but among other acting stints, he co-starred in a 1946 production of Lute Song with Mary Martin. He also did some modeling work and was photographed nude by George Platt Lynes.[14] Brynner married his first wife, actress Virginia Gilmore, in 1944, and soon after began working as a director at the new CBS television studios, directing Studio One, among other shows. In 1949, he made his film debut in Port of New York, his only film with his natural head of hair.[citation needed] The next year, at the urging of Martin, he auditioned for Rodgers and Hammerstein's new musical in New York. He recalled that, as he was finding success as a director on television, he was reluctant to go back on the stage. Once he read the script, however, he was fascinated by the character of the King and was eager to do the project.[15] woman kneeling in front of a standing man; the two are conversing and each is gesturing with one hand as if ringing a small bell\n\nBrynner with Gertrude Lawrence in the original production of The King and I (1951) His best-known role remains that of King Mongkut of Siam in The King and I, which he played 4,625 times on stage over the span of his career. He appeared in the original 1951 production and later touring productions as well as a 1977 Broadway revival, a London Production in 1979 and another Broadway revival in 1985. He won Tony Awards for both the first and the last of these Broadway productions. He also appeared in the 1956 film version, for which he won an Academy Award as Best Actor and in a short-lived TV version (Anna and the King) on CBS in 1972. Brynner is one of only nine people who have won both a Tony Award and an Academy Award for the same role.[16] His connection to the story and the role of King Mongkut is so deep that he was mentioned in the song \"One Night in Bangkok\" from the 1984 musical Chess whose second act is set in Bangkok. In 1951 Brynner shaved his head for his role in The King and I.[17][18] Following the huge success of the Broadway production and subsequent film, Brynner continued to shave his head for the rest of his life, though he would sometimes wear a wig for certain roles. Brynner's shaved head was unusual at the time, and his striking appearance helped to give him an iconic appeal.[19] Some fans shaved off their hair to emulate him,[20] and a shaved head was often referred to as the \"Yul Brynner look\".[21][22][23] Brynner reprised his \"Shall We Dance?\" segment with Patricia Morison on the TV special General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein, broadcast March 28, 1954 on all four American TV networks of the time. Brynner made an immediate impact upon launching his mainstream film career in 1956 and quickly gained superstar status after appearing not only in The King and I that year but also in starring roles in The Ten Commandments, and Anastasia with Ingrid Bergman. Brynner, at 5'8\" was reportedly concerned about being overshadowed by co-star Charlton Heston's height and physical presence in The Ten Commandments and prepared his impressive physique seen in the film with an intensive weight-lifting program.[citation needed] He appeared in more than 40 other films over the next two decades,[7] including the epic Solomon and Sheba (1959), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Taras Bulba (1962) and Kings of the Sun (1963). He co-starred with Marlon Brando in Morituri (1965), Katharine Hepburn in The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969) and Lee J. Cobb in a film version of The Brothers Karamazov (1958). He played the titular role of The Ultimate Warrior (1975) and starred with Barbara Bouchet in Death Rage (1976). Among his final feature film appearances were in Michael Crichton's Westworld (1973) and its sequel Futureworld (1976). Brynner also appeared in drag (as a torch singer) in an unbilled role in the Peter Sellers comedy The Magic Christian (1969).[24] Photographer, author, and musician[edit]\n\nIn addition to his work as a director and performer, Brynner was an active photographer and wrote two books. His daughter Victoria put together Yul Brynner: Photographer (ISBN 0-8109-3144-3) a collection of his photographs of family, friends, and fellow actors, as well as those he took while serving as a UN special consultant on refugees. Brynner wrote Bring Forth the Children: A Journey to the Forgotten People of Europe and the Middle East (1960), with photographs by himself and Magnum photographer Inge Morath, and The Yul Brynner Cookbook: Food Fit for the King and You (1983 ISBN 0-8128-2882-8). Brynner was an accomplished guitarist. In his early period in Europe he often played and sang gypsy songs in Parisian nightclubs with Aliosha Dimitrievitch. He sang some of those same songs in the film The Brothers Karamazov. In 1967 he and Dimitrievitch released a record album The Gypsy and I: Yul Brynner Sings Gypsy Songs (Vanguard VSD 79265).[citation needed] Personal life[edit]\n\nBrynner married four times. The first three ended in divorce. He fathered three children and adopted two. He and his first wife, actress Virginia Gilmore (1944–1960), had one child, Rock Yul Brynner (born December 23, 1946). His father nicknamed him \"Rock\" when he was six years old in honor of boxer Rocky Graziano. Rock is a historian, novelist, and university history lecturer at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York and Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Connecticut. In 2006, Rock wrote a book about his father and his family history titled Empire and Odyssey: The Brynners in Far East Russia and Beyond. He regularly returns to Vladivostok, the city of his father's birth, for the \"Pacific Meridian\" Film Festival. Brynner's daughter, Lark Brynner, was born out of wedlock in 1959 and raised by her mother, Frankie Tilden, who was 20 years old when Lark was born. Brynner supported her financially. His second wife, from 1960 to 1967, Doris Kleiner, was a Chilean model whom he married on the set during shooting of The Magnificent Seven in 1960. They had one child, Victoria Brynner (born November 1962), whose godmother was Audrey Hepburn.[25] His third wife, Jacqueline Thion de la Chaume (1971–1981), a French socialite, was the widow of Philippe de Croisset (son of French playwright Francis de Croisset and a publishing executive). Brynner and Jacqueline adopted two Vietnamese children: Mia (1974) and Melody (1975). The first house Brynner owned was the Manoir de Criqueboeuf, a sixteenth-century manor house that he and Jacqueline purchased.[26] His 1980 announcement that he would continue in the role of the King for another long tour and Broadway run, together with his affairs with female fans and his neglect of his wife and children, purportedly broke up this marriage.[27] On April 4, 1983, aged 62, Brynner married his fourth and last wife, Kathyyam Lee (born 1957/1958), a 24-year-old ballerina from Malaysia, whom he had met in a production of The King and I in which she had a small dancing role. They remained married for the last 2 years (1983–85) of Brynner's life.[28] Citizenship[edit]\n\nBrynner, a Swiss citizen, was naturalized as a U.S. citizen, but in June 1965, he renounced his US citizenship at the US Embassy in Berne, Switzerland for tax reasons. He had lost his tax exemption as an American resident abroad by working too long in the United States and would have been bankrupted by his tax and penalty debts.[26] Illness and death[edit]\n\nBrynner began smoking heavily at age 12 and, although his promotional photos often showed him with a cigarette in-hand, he quit the habit in 1971. In September 1983, Brynner found a lump on his vocal cords. In Los Angeles, only hours before his 4,000th performance in The King and I, he received the test results. His throat was fine, but he had inoperable lung cancer. Brynner and the national tour of the musical were forced to take a few months off while he underwent radiation therapy, which hurt his throat and made it impossible for him to sing or speak easily.[7] The tour then resumed.[29][30] In January 1985, nine months before his death, the tour reached New York for a farewell Broadway run. Aware he was dying, Brynner gave an interview on Good Morning America discussing the dangers of smoking and expressing his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial. The Broadway production of The King and I ran from January 7 to June 30 of that year, with Mary Beth Peil as Anna. His last performance marked the 4,625th time he had played the role of the King. Meanwhile, Brynner and the American Cancer Society created a public service announcement using a clip from the Good Morning America interview. Brynner died of lung cancer on October 10, 1985 in New York City on the same day as his Battle of Neretva co-star Orson Welles.[31][32] Only a few days after his death, the public service announcement was showing on all the major US television networks and was shown in many other countries. The PSA showed him expressing his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial after discovering how sick he was, and that his death was imminent. He then looked directly into the camera for 30 seconds and said, \"Now that I'm gone, I tell you: Don’t smoke. Whatever you do, just don’t smoke. If I could take back that smoking, we wouldn't be talking about any cancer. I'm convinced of that.\" His remains are interred in France on the grounds of the Saint-Michel-de-Bois-Aubry Russian Orthodox monastery near Luzé between Tours and Poitiers. Awards[edit]\n\nIn 1952, he received the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of The King in The King and I (musical). In 1985, he received a Special Tony Award honoring his 4,625 performances in The King and I.[33] He won the 1956 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the King of Siam in The King and I and made the \"Top 10 Stars of the Year\" list in both 1957 and 1958. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6162 Hollywood Blvd. Honors[edit]\n\nOn September 28, 2012, an 2.4-metre (8-foot) tall statue was inaugurated at Yul Brynner Park, in front of the home where he was born at Aleutskaya St. No. 15 in Vladivostok, Russia. Created by local sculptor Alexei Bokiy, the monument was carved in granite from China. The grounds for the park were donated by the city of Vladivostok, which also paid additional costs. Vladivostok Mayor Igor Pushkariov, US Consul General Sylvia Curran, and Yul's son, Rock Brynner, participated in the ceremony, along with hundreds of local residents.[citation needed] Other[edit]\n\nThe cottage at his childhood country home, at Sidimi, near Vladivostok, is a family museum.[citation needed] In a label-initiated publicity stunt, the 1960s surf group \"The De-Fenders\" shaved their heads and re-cast themselves as \"The Brymers\", inspired by Brynner.[34] Filmography[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1949 Port of New York Paul Vicola 1956 The King and I King Mongkut of Siam Academy Award for Best Actor National Board of Review Award for Best Actor (also for Anastasia and The Ten Commandments) New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor (2nd place) Nominated-Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy Anastasia General Sergei Pavlovich Bounine National Board of Review Award for Best Actor (also for The King and I and The Ten Commandments) The Ten Commandments Rameses National Board of Review Award for Best Actor (also for The King and I and Anastasia) 1958 The Brothers Karamazov Dmitri Karamazov The Buccaneer Jean Lafitte 1959 The Journey Major Surov The Sound and the Fury Jason Compson Solomon and Sheba Solomon 1960 Once More, with Feeling!

Famed as much for his baldness, he was the first bald movie idol, as for his performances. He was the son of Boris Bryner, a Swiss-Mongolian engineer and inventor, and Marousia Blagavidova, the daughter of a Russian doctor. He was born in their hometown of Vladivostok and named Yul after his grandfather Jules Bryner. Raised in Russia, China and France he dropped out of school and became a musician, playing guitar in nightclubs among the Russian gypsies. He became an apprentice at the Theatre des Mathurins and worked as a trapeze artists with the famed Cirque d'Hiver company. He traveled to the U.S. in 1941 to study with acting teacher Michael Chekhov and toured the country with Chekhov's theatrical troupe. In 1941 he debuted in New York as Fabian in Twelfth Night (billed as Youl Bryner). He worked in the TV series, \"Mr. Jones and His Neighbors\" and then starred with his wife, Virginia Gilmore, in the first TV talk show, \"Mr. and Mrs.\" In 1950 he was the director of a children's puppet show on CBS, \"Life with Snarky Parker.\" He made his film debut in Port of New York (1949), two years later, Mary Martin recommended him for the part he would always be known for, the King in Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical \"The King and I.\" Brynner became an immediate sensation in the role, repeating it for film and winning the Oscar for Best Actor. One of only eight actors to have won both a Tony and an Oscar for having portrayed the same roles on stage and screen. For the next 20 years he maintained a starring film career (37 movies) despite the exotic nature of his persona and almost all with the same shaven head and indefinable accent. In the 1970s, he returned to the stage and spent most of the rest of his life touring the world in The King and I. Besides his Tony and Oscar awards, Brynner is a recipient of the presitigious Connor Award, given by the brothers of the Phi Alpha Tau fraternity based out of Emerson College in Boston and has a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
