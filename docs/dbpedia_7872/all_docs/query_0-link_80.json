        "text": "Seth Binzer, who went by his stage name Shifty Shellshock, was found in his Los Angeles home earlier this week.\n\nHe died on Monday (24 June), according to the examiner's website. At the time of writing, no cause of death has been revealed.\n\nHe founded the rap-rock band in Los Angeles in 1995 alongside Brett Mazur.\n\nCrazy Town’s 1999 single ‘Butterfly’ reached number one in the US singles chart and number three in the UK singles chart, and became an early 2000s anthem.\n\nThe band also had hits including 'Drowning' and 'Revolving Door'. However, when commercial success alluded them in 2002 for their sophomore album, the members soon disbanded.\n\nCrazy Town reformed in 2007 and went on to release their comeback third album, ‘The Brimstone Sluggers’, in 2015.\n\nBinzer had struggled with drug addiction in the past, appearing in two seasons of reality TV shows Celebrity Rehab and Sober House. He also made headlines last year when he was arrested for drink-driving.\n\nThe band last toured in 2023.\n\n“RIP old friend… remember you best as a kid in a skateboard with the entire world in front of you… sending love to your family,” wrote photographer Mike Azria in a comment on the singer’s latest Instagram update.\n\nBinzer is survived by his three sons, Gage, Halo and Phoenix, which he singer had with three different partners, Melissa Clark, Tracey Shelor, and British model Jasmine Lennard."
