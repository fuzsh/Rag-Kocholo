        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews &cet.\n\nI recently watched, over a period of several months, the nine RKO pictures in the 2007 DVD set Astaire and Rogers: The Complete Film Collection (to me, inexplicably unavailable on Blu-ray).* I’ve seen them all, of course, more than once and, in the cases of the three best pictures in the series (The Gay Divorcee, Top Hat, Swing Time) on multiple occasions, but had not until last autumn watched them in sequence. What follows, culled from my monthly video reports, does not aspire to being a definitive overview of the series. If you’re interested in that you can do no better than to get your hands on a copy of Arlene Croce’s The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book (1972; reissued in 2010) which is, as Pauline Kael observed in The New Yorker when it was first published, “the best book that will ever be written about Astaire and Rogers.” At best, these capsule reviews might, I hope, whet your appetite for the finest series of musicals ever made in this country or, if you have also watched and loved them, remind you of the reasons for your love.\n\nBefore we go further (and this may stop you cold) understand that I regard Fred Astaire as the single most important figure in the development of the American musical movie and, in Ethan Mordden’s designation, the most wonderful man in musicals. That isn’t to suggest that he had no limitations. He wasn’t much of a listener, for one thing — Rogers had it all over her partner in that respect — and his acting hasn’t the depth she brought to what she did dramatically. I also think she’s funnier than he is; she had a grounding in comedy where his was mostly in dance. And while he was, in his way, a handsome man, he was certainly no romantic paragon. His head was curiously shaped, like a less amusing version of Stan Laurel, with a long chin and a wide head accentuated by his thinning hair and, on film, his high-forehead toupées. His singing may strike you as an acquired taste as well, thin in the higher registers and lacking that conventional power the more obvious talents in musical theatre had, sometimes to their own detriment. (Al Jolson is especially problematic in this respect.) Astaire also had large hands; he reminds me a bit of Sergei Rachmaninoff, whose freakish digital reach influenced the way he composed for the piano, to the despair of later exponents of his music. Astaire dealt with his hands, about which he was understandably self-conscious, by turning his fingers inward. If you watch him closely you’ll notice that while he’s dancing his hands are seldom open or his fingers splayed. Other dancers, with smaller hands, use their finger-widths in more overt ways, as expressive extensions of their exuberance. Astaire tried to make his disappear.\n\nSo, what, with all these seeming defects, makes Astaire so marvelous? Gore Vidal once ventured that style was, “knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.” Astaire put it more simply: “Do it big, do it right, and do it with style.” But anyone can “do it big.” Bigness is a kind of style, I suppose — no one was bigger as a theatrical singer than Ethel Merman. Yet for Merman, the bigness of her vocalizing was a part of who she was as a performer. Mary Martin, with her entrancing coloratura soprano, could be quite demure. Merman couldn’t be Mary Martin, and didn’t try. Yet when she nailed a note, like that “Ohhhhhhh…” near the climax of “I Got Rhythm,” she was doing more than stopping the show; she was telling the listener that she was so crazy in love she’d become effervescent. That’s character. (The song made her an instant Broadway star in 1930.) Astaire as I’ve said didn’t have that power, and he didn’t have anything like Merman’s range. No popular singer, however, including Bing Crosby, was more sought-after by more great songwriters than Astaire. He understood instinctively the importance of a lyric, and he gave the words the sort of emphasis, without ostentation, that made lyricists like Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter and Irving Berlin swoon; no one ever made their words sound so inevitable, so surprising or so attractive. Astaire also understood rhythm better than any male singer of his day, again including Crosby. It’s not surprising that, while he could play the piano decently (those large hands must have been an asset), his real instrument was the drum-kit. That Fred Astaire was a great dancer was understood by everyone who’d seen him, but what is less well perceived is how beautifully he moved off the dance floor, a trait he shared with Cary Grant. At the beginning of the middling caper picture The Midas Run, the camera catches the lower half of a man walking jauntily along a London street, and in seconds you know it can’t be anyone but Astaire. The walk is of a piece with his general gracefulness and his unerring sense of style in the clothing he wore, another thing he shared with Grant. He was an enormously appealing man.\n\nAstaire was also, in addition to his dancing (and although it’s not generally discussed or understood) a great choreographer for the screen. He worked out his own routines, with his friend and collaborator Hermes Pan, who doubled for Fred’s female partners as they created the dances. It was Fred Astaire more than anyone else who set the best style for shooting dance for the screen, keeping the full figures of the dancers in the frame and, whenever possible, filming in long, unbroken medium takes that captured the excitement of performance, both for the audience and for the dancers. There are not, I don’t think, any more exuberant, joyous dance duets in movies than “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain)?” in Top Hat, “Let Yourself Go” in Follow the Fleet and “Pick Yourself Up” in Swing Time, and no more devastating emotional dances than “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” in Fleet and “Never Gonna Dance,” again in Swing Time, and much of the thrill, and the pleasure, those numbers convey is due to how they were filmed. Astaire was as well a modern in his aversion to what he called “mushy stuff,” a disdain he shared with the best lyricists of the time. The love songs he sang came at romance, as Emily Dickinson would say, “slant,” and there’s no on-screen kissing in the Astaire-Rogers pictures until Carefree. Perhaps it came in part from his being yoked to his sister Adele all those years in vaudeville, in London and on Broadway, but the breeziness of Astaire’s attitude, refreshing in the 1930s, still comes across as a tonic.\n\nAstaire isn’t everything, of course, in the Astaire and Rogers movies. Ginger holds half the appeal, and what he wasn’t, she was (and vice-versa.) She wasn’t a terribly good singer, which accounts for most of the songs in their pictures being sung by Fred, but she had a gift for high comic invention Astaire hadn’t, and despite a certain coarseness in her looks and personality she was often adorable. Not the natural dancer he was, she had to work harder at it. Sometimes the work shows, but what we remember most about her dancing is how much fun she seems to be having even when, as the records show, she may have been in physical agony. Rogers’ challenge dances with Fred are the one of the things I most look forward to when I sit down to watch an Astaire-Rogers picture, along with anticipating the display of his seemingly bottomless charm and the superb music America’s best composers of popular songs turned out when they knew they were writing for him.\n\nFlying Down to Rio (1933) Remembered chiefly as the first picture in which Fred Astaire danced with Ginger Rogers. This happens in a silly but infectious number called the “Carioca,” which among other things involves the partners pressing their foreheads together. Somehow Fred and Ginger carried off that indignity with enough panache that movie audiences of 1933 demanded more of them, and you can see why; their joy in performing together was obvious. (Of course, having spent his entire performing life partnered with his sister Adele, recently retired to England, Fred was most definitely not in the mood to be yoked again to another dancer. After The Gay Divorcee in 1934 became one of the biggest hits of its year, however, the matter was effectively out of his hands.)\n\nWhile the plot, based on an unpublished comedy by the playwright and lyricist Anne Caldwell,† is perfunctory, the leads, Dolores del Río and Gene Raymond, are engaging, and the picture has a nifty gimmick: Scenes of Brazilian life that, through the creative use of the optical printer, become living picture-postcards, each flipping past to reveal the next. There is also, in Fred’s enthusiastic title number, a shocking moment (presumably the work of the movie’s producer, Merian C. Cooper, the begettor of King Kong) when during an aerial routine a young woman falls screaming from a trapeze below a biplane. She’s rescued, of course, but it’s an electrifying bit, and I wonder if George Roy Hill and William Goldman had it in mind when they made The Great Waldo Pepper 40 years later. As Arlene Croce wrote in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book, “Merian C. Cooper brought terror to the movie musical.”\n\nThe songs, which include a very likeable solo number for Ginger called “Music Makes Me,” were by Vincent Youmans, with spritely lyrics by Gus Kahn and Edward Eliscu. Flying Down to Rio is also notable for pairing two incomparable comic sissies, Franklin Pangborn and Eric Blore, as a hotel manager and his simpering assistant. Blore would come into full flower, as it were, in his later Astaire & Rogers appearances.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee (1935) After their brief duet on “The Carioca” in Flying Down to Rio set up a public clamor for more, a re-teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers by RKO was inevitable. Their first starring vehicle was an adaptation of Astaire’s last Broadway success (The Gay Divorce, a title apparently taboo under the Production Code) and in the blinkered tradition of Hollywood studio lunacy the entire Cole Porter stage score was tossed with the exception of “Night and Day,” its biggest hit. Although the movie isn’t as buoyant as the team’s best work it’s a lively picture, funny, absurd and engaging. It also sets the template for the Astaire-Rogers series: Initial dislike of Fred by Ginger (or like followed by misunderstanding leading to dislike, or some other variation on the theme), cast of wacky supporting actors (such as Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Erik Rhodes, the wisecracking Helen Broderick or, here, the charming Alice Brady), screwball complications, a romantic dance and, if we’re lucky, a challenge. I’m one of those oddballs — Pauline Kael was another — who prefer the non-romantic Fred & Ginger routines to their more celebrated ballroom turns, except (as in Follow the Fleet and Swing Time) when the duets are dramatic. Many think the essence of Astaire and Rogers are items like “Cheek to Cheek” and, here, “Night and Day,” and they’re marvelous expressions of romance but they don’t, at least for me, carry the absolute joy of “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” “Let Yourself Go” and “Pick Yourself Up”… the latter pair of which, juxtaposed that way, sound like an answer in one of those ironic double-feature puzzles. Dances like those sum up the appeal of Astaire and Rogers as a team far more than the formal love-duets; although they, like the ballroom dances, were thoroughly worked out, they feel spontaneous in a way the romantic dances never can. You get a sense, despite the sweat, of the joy of performance in “Isn’t it a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain?),” for example, and despite Astaire’s displeasure at being part of a team again after his sister Adele broke up the act, of the pleasure each performer took in the other.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee was directed by Mark Sandrich, who guided Astaire and Rogers in more pictures than anyone else, and his crisp style is as much a part of the team’s work as those white Art Deco sets and the loopy plots, usually cobbled by Allan Scott or Dwight Taylor. (This one was written by by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman, but the original stage book was by Taylor.) David Abel’s beautiful cinematography, evident here, was on display in five of the nine pictures Astaire and Rogers made together at RKO as well as Holiday Inn, also directed by Sandrich. In this initial offering, the producers (or producer, since Pardo S. Berman was credited) hadn’t yet grasped that Astaire and Rogers were what people wanted to see, not elaborate musical numbers with a cast of thousands, so we get “The Continental” for 17 exhausting minutes, only a few of which are given over to Ginger and Fred. Worse, the creators assigned an entirely extraneous number to Edward Everett Horton(!) and a young Betty Grable, “Let’s K-nock K-nees,” which when I see it always makes me think of Arlene Croce’s riposte in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book: “Must we?” The “Night and Day” dance, on the other hand, based on the stage version choreographed by Fred, is one of the duets people who love the team remember best, and it’s beautifully worked out. The picture ends with another of Fred’s cleverly conceived dances from the stage show, in which he and Rogers sail over the sofas and chairs of his hotel suite, and it’s so casually charming it makes you grin in deep appreciation.\n\nA personal note: I first saw The Gay Divocee at a summer afternoon library screening about 40 years ago. Seated behind my friend and me were a pair of elderly Jewish women, complete with Molly Picon immigrant accents. When the picture began with nightclub patrons, including Fred, playing with little legless dolls through which their forefingers were inserted to make them “dance,” one of the women cooed happily to her companion, “Cute!… is that cute?”\n\nI can never see this movie without recalling the pleasure my friend and I got from that, at that moment and for years afterward in the remembering.\n\nRoberta (1935) Such were the vagaries of the 1930s Hollywood studio system that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, fresh from their triumph in The Gay Divorcee, were cast as supporting characters in this adaptation of the Jerome Kern/Otto Harbach stage musical. One doesn’t mind so much that their over-the-title co-star is the charming Irene Dunne; that Randolph Scott is given equal weight is practically an offense against God and Mammon. His performance in this, and in the subsequent Follow the Fleet (see below) leave one to marvel that he ever had an important career, or that he may have been the love of Cary Grant’s young life. I hope at least he was good in bed, because he certainly stinks up this movie.\n\nWhen Fred and Ginger are on screen, or Helen Westley as Dunne’s eponymous dress-designing aunt, or Dunne herself is singing “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” Roberta is first-rate entertainment. So let’s concentrate on those strengths, shall we, and forget if we can Scott’s performance and the number of times he says something is “swell”? Fred plays a bandleader, and gets a lively number (“Let’s Begin”) with his musicians, notably Candy Candido, with whom he does a kind of genderfuck bit avant la lettre. Ginger is Fred’s American former girlfriend, passing herself off as a Polish countess (I’m not kidding) in Paris. Although Astaire and Rogers do one of their ballroom specialties, to “Lovely to Look At” and “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” their two other numbers are a lot more fun: The satirical “I Won’t Dance” and “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” one of those joyous episodes of thoroughly worked-out yet seemingly impromptu hoofing that were, even more than their signature romantic duets, their peculiar specialty. On the debit side, Dunne has to perform “Yesterdays,” featuring one of Harbach’s worst sets of lyrics. No singer, not even one as lyrical as Irene Dunne, can be expected to triumph with lyrics like,\n\nYesterdays\n\nDays I knew as happy sweet\n\nSequestered days […]\n\nThen gay youth was mine\n\nAnd truth was mine\n\nJoyous free and flaming life\n\nForsooth was mine\n\nWho in the 1930s talked like that, let alone sang? That last bit is so convoluted and linguistically passé it occasioned one of Billie Holiday’s few recorded lyric flubs.\n\nWilliam A. Seiter, most of whose pictures were mediocrities, directed with intelligence and a certain gracefulness of style that does what it can to make the material seem more interesting than it is. Alan Scott was one of the three credited screenwriters, and the author of the movie’s “additional dialogue” was the same Glenn Tryon who starred in the 1926 silent comedy 45 Minutes from Hollywood, with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in brief cameos, and who would go on to star in two movies (Lonesome and Broadway) for the expressionistic Hungarian director Paul Fejos before drifting into screenwriting and direction.\n\nTop Hat (1935) No one should be forced to choose a single Astaire-Rogers musical, and I am always torn between this one and Swing Time. Top Hat is probably the better movie: it’s swifter, more sparkling, lays some nice emphasis on those two incomparable sissies Eric Blore and Edward Everett Horton, and boasts a perfect Irving Berlin score including a title song that elegantly sums up the appeal of Fred Astaire, whom Graham Greene once called the human equivalent of Mickey Mouse. That isn’t the insult it seems; in the early ‘30s Mickey was not yet the figure of dull respectability he became; he was rambunctious, elastic, mischievous, even slightly cruel — just like Fred.\n\nPerhaps inspired by their “Let Yourself Go” duet in Follow the Fleet Astaire and Rogers also get a challenge-dance here to “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain?)” that is not only among their half-dozen or so best routines, it’s also a rapturous expression of the sheer joy of performance. If these two didn’t fall in love after a number like that, one of them would have to be frigid and the other gay. After the requisite complications, masquerades and misunderstandings, the pair performs Berlin’s lilting, sensuous “Cheek to Cheek” in a Venice ballroom and featuring Ginger’s feathered dress which, although it drove her partner to distraction, proved that she understood what looked best on her when she danced with him; and another of those new dance sensations, “The Piccolino,” led off by Ginger’s charming verse and chorus. This brings me to a side-note: However wonderful a performer Fred Astaire was — and aside from his status as the finest dancer the movies have ever known he was also one of the American songbook’s great stylists — compare the way he listens to Ginger singing with the way in which she takes in his vocalizations: He smiles a lot but looks faintly glazed; she hangs on every word whether she’s facing him or not, and always seems to be hearing them for the first time. She not only (in the cartoonist Bob Thaves’ memorable phrase) “did everything Fred did, backwards and in heels”; at times she also acted him off the screen.\n\nAll of the members of the RKO Astaire-Rogers machine were involved here: The producer Pando S. Berman; the director Mark Sandrich (he made five of their pictures, and his style is modest but elegant and his pacing is nearly always perfect); the screenwriters Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor; the cinematographer David Abel, whose polished black-and-white photography is what we think of when we remember the Astaire-Rogers pictures, along with those gloriously anachronistic all-white Art Deco sets designed by Carroll Clark but erroneously attributed to the wonderfully-named Van Nest Polglase (Venice never looked so clean); the choreography was by Fred with Hermes Pan; the musical direction and orchestrations were by Hal Bourne; and the cast includes Erik Rhodes as a silly, English-mangling Italian co-respondent, Horton as Fred’s manager, the vermouth-dry Helen Broderick as his wife and Blore as his butler Bates, who feuds with him throughout and whose machinations resolve the plot. The main titles, incidentally, are fairly unique for their time, with first Fred’s feet and legs dancing into the frame and appearing above his name, and then Ginger’s. It’s a marvelously stylish gesture, almost a shorthand, one that hints at the spirited revelry to come.\n\nProduced on a relatively lavish Depression-era budget of $609,000, Top Hat brought in $3.2 million at the box-office, and became the most profitable RKO release of the decade.\n\nFollow the Fleet (1936) Adhering to the pattern set by Roberta in 1935 (and why would you want to?) RKO once again made Astaire and Rogers more or less subservient to Randolph Scott. As if that wasn’t bad enough the men play sailors, and Astaire’s idea of expressing his working-class bona fides is to constantly be chewing gum.\n\nWell, at least Irving Berlin wrote the songs. Ginger gets the sexy “Let Yourself Go,” which she and Fred then dance to, in an “impromptu” ballroom contest exhibition. It’s one of their most joyous numbers, performed by both of them with a rubber-legged, loose-limbed panache that makes you smile broadly throughout. Most of Fred’s numbers are done with his Navy band (“We Saw The Sea,” “I’d Rather Lead A Band,” “I’m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket”) but Harriet Hilliard, the future Mrs. Ozzie Nelson (and mother of Ricky) has a splendid solo in “Get Thee Behind Me, Satan.” I know I’m in the minority in believing this to be one of Berlin’s finest ballads, but it is in any case beautifully framed by the director Mark Sandrich and his cinematographer David Abel, and at least partially redeems the horrible “Why, without your glasses you’re beautiful!” old-maid cliché Hilliard is forced to endure before she sings. (Berlin originally wrote the song, interestingly, for Rogers to perform in Top Hat. Obviously, he thought well of it.) What makes Follow the Fleet special, however, and secures it a place in movie musical history (or at least, in Astaire-Rogers iconography) is the “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” number. It was the most dramatic entry in the series until “Never Gonna Dance” in Swing Time displaced it a year later, and its seriousness of intent — it begins with Fred and Ginger in a gambling den, separately losing their bankrolls and contemplating suicide — is almost shocking in the context of so light an entertainment, and the dance between them is so charged with unstated emotionalism it’s hair-raising.\n\nThe screenplay was credited to Allan and Scott Dwight Taylor with “Additional Dialogue,” as they used to say, by Lew Lipton. At least in this one Randolph Scott doesn’t say “Swell!” every other line. Sharp eyes will spot Betty Grable as a trio singer, Lucille Ball in a small role and Humphrey Bogart as a sailor. The Hubert Osbourne 1922 play Shore Leave, on which Follow the Fleet was based, incidentally, had a long afterlife: It was also the source for the 1927 Vincent Youmans musical Hit the Deck, itself filmed by MGM in 1955.\n\nSwing Time (1936) With the 1935 Top Hat one of the two best Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals, containing a pair of the team’s most exhilarating dances and, in Jerome Kern’s music and Dorothy Fields’ lyrics, just about the greatest score of its kind ever written for a movie musical. Despite its occasional longueurs (and a truly silly finale) the picture inspired Astaire to one of his supreme achievements as a choreographer: The dance with Rogers to “Never Gonna Dance.” This breathless medley not only dramatically recaps the romance of the characters in this movie but almost everything for which we love these two. The final portion, shot in a single fluid take, required 46 re-takes and somewhere in the middle of it all Rogers’ feet started to bleed.\n\nThe Howard Lindsay/Allan Scott screenplay is a bit overstuffed, or maybe it only feels that way because it was directed by George Stevens, seldom remembered for concision. It has the same clean, Art Deco look as its predecessors, thanks in part to David Abel’s gorgeous cinematography, and there’s a good supporting cast which includes Victor Moore as Astaire’s card-sharp sidekick, the always witty Helen Broderick as Moore’s eventual inamorata and, as a dyspeptic dance-school manager, the peerless Eric Blore. Kern, who more than any figure until Richard Rodgers had the most profound influence on the Broadway musical, composed a score so rich in melodic invention it dwarfs the work of almost everyone else in movies, and Fields matches him in words. Her lyrics always sparkled, but she was also a musical dramatist, beautifully evidenced in the witty “A Fine Romance”: It’s hard to imagine any male lyricist of the time other than perhaps Cole Porter writing a couplet like, “I never mussed the crease in your blue serge pants/I never get the chance,” and I am always moved by the way she constructed the lyrics for “Never Gonna Dance.” First, there is the repeated Depression-era invocation of the wolf at the door; second, the unspoken metaphor of the movies’ greatest male dancer seeming to put up his dancing shoes (“on beautiful trees”) as renunciation of an unrequited romance; third, her sharp sense of rhythmic and dramatic ascension. Ginger’s character is called Penny here, and from Fred’s repetition of the phrase, “‘Though I’m left without a penny…” Fields builds to, “So, I’m left without my Penny…” [Emphasis mine.] That’s as good in its way as Stephen Sondheim in A Little Night Music‘s “The Miller’s Son” repeating, “We’ll go dancing” and finally resolving the image as, “We’ll have dancing.”\n\nKern was uncomfortable with swing, so the rapturous “Waltz in Swing Time” was cobbled together by the orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett from themes the composer provided. Of the lyrical ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” Fields said, “The first time Jerry played that melody for me I went out and started to cry. The release absolutely killed me. I couldn’t stop, it was so beautiful.” (The song is also, at 68 bars, more than twice the length of the 32-bar standard.) The single number in Swing Time that raises eyebrows today is Fred’s “Bojangles of Harlem”; although Astaire is wearing tan make-up on his head and neck, it’s not “blackface,” which is exaggerated and used to demean and ridicule (even when black performers did it themselves) — here it’s the dancing equivalent of an actor playing Othello. Oddly, however, although Fields’ lyric certainly evokes Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, the dancer whose moves Astaire imitates in his solo is John W. Bubbles, from whom he took tap lessons, and he’s dressed in a manner similar to Bubbles’ starring role as Sportin’ Life in Porgy and Bess. If there is shame to be apportioned to the number it may lie in the music sheets bearing a notation on a certain passage as corresponding to Fred’s “jig dance,” in acknowledgment of an old child’s toy, which often (but not always) depicted a stereotyped black man. Jig (or “jigger”) dance toys do not, however, automatically represent a racist viewpoint, so one could argue about this matter endlessly instead of enjoying Astaire’s performance, especially when he’s dancing in front of, and competing with, three gigantic, identically-dressed silhouettes.‡\n\nIn Swing Time Fred’s a dancer (although he makes his living as a gambler… I said the finale was silly, and it is, but not any sillier than that plot-point) but when he meets Ginger, a dance instructor, pretends he isn’t so she’ll be forced to teach him. This leads to what seems to me the most joyous dance in the series, “Pick Yourself Up,” wherein when Astaire is forced to show off to save Rogers’ job they, in Arlene Croce‘s memorable phrase, “leave the place in flames.” With “Never Gonna Dance,” Astaire’s and Rogers’ characters bid heartbreaking adieu to each other in dance, and it’s arguably the most dramatic dance number the movies had ever seen to that time. Nothing the pair did before or after comes close… which of course means no one else could either.\n\nShall We Dance (1937) The financial returns on this, the seventh teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, were less than half those of its predecessor, which suggested to some that the partnership was slipping with the public but there’s little reason, it seems to me, to suppose that. Rather, it was the way the team was being treated by their studio that pushed the audience away. It certainly didn’t help that they were expected to accept Fred as a Russian ballet star, a thing I’m surprised Astaire didn’t quash in the writing; he had no sympathy with the ballet and certainly little aptitude for it, and the central complication (are the pair married or aren’t they?) is at best mildly diverting and at worst annoying. It’s telling that, in addition to the credited scenarists Allan Scott and Ernest Pagano, Lee Loeb and Harold Buchman got story credit, P.J. Wolfson adaptation credit and at least three uncredited writers (Anne Morrison Chapin, James Gow and Edmund H. North) either worked on the treatment or the final script. The whole thing has a feeling of polished desperation about it, and that many writers on as slight a story as this surely indicates something.\n\nGeorge Gershwin, whose last full score this was, complained bitterly that the filmmakers did not exploit his and his brother Ira’s songs sufficiently, and he had a point. Fred sings a brief “(I’ve Got) Beginner’s Luck” to Ginger but there is no dance to go with the vocal, for example, and where a dance of loss seems absolutely required after he sings “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” to her, they’re on a fog-bound ferry so there’s no place for them to dance. Astaire has a great routine with a luxury liner’s engine room crew to “Slap That Bass,” one of his engaging specialties, but I don’t see how the song could have become a hit. “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” did eventually find its way into the American song book, despite rather than due to Fred and Ginger’s Central Park roller skating routine to it as did “They All Laughed,” which Rogers sings wearing a wonderfully designed flowered skirt that shows off her remarkably slender waist and which she and Astaire perform in one of their charming challenge dances. But the title number had no real chance to catch on, not only because the dance to it is based on a gimmick (a chorus of dancers wearing Ginger masks and which Rogers joins to Fred’s consternation) but largely because it is introduced by the gruesome contortions of the alleged prima ballerina Harriet Hoctor, the worst routine in the Astaire-Rogers filmography. And to think they offered her the lead in this picture!\n\nCarefree (1938) The seventh teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is the slightest of their RKO musicals, the first to lose money, and the one with the least dancing. Another of those pictures whose complicated screenwriting credits betray a certain amount of panic (the script was by Allan Scott and Ernest Pagano from an “original idea” by Marian Ainslee and Guy Endore, its “story and adaptation” by the redoubtable Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde, credited that same year with Bringing Up Baby) the picture casts Astaire as a dancing psychoanalyst trying to break through Rogers’ resistance to marrying Ralph Bellamy (it takes a shrink to figure that out?) and in the process falling for her himself. There are some good lines and funny situations, as when Ginger, a radio singer, wrecks her own live show under hypnosis, but there are also items that make you squirm, such as the way, again having been hypnotized, she hunts Astaire down with a shotgun, repeatedly proclaiming that “men like him should be shot down like dogs.” Fun-nee!\n\nAdding to the troubles are an ill-conceived dream sequence set to one of Irving Berlin’s less interesting tunes, which by its conception demanded to be filmed in color but which RKO refused to do, making a hash of a song Berlin pointedly called “I Used to Be Color Blind.” (It also contains a slow-motion dance, a device I resist on principle, and a prolonged kiss between Fred and Ginger, which is just plain objectionable.) There’s an extended New Dance Sensation called “The Yam,” whose melody Berlin later adapted for his war-time anthem “Any Bonds Today?” and which illustrates that a certain degree of democratization in the Astaire and Rogers universe is unwelcome; instead of those gleaming, absurd but oddly endearing white Art Deco sets complete with extras in evening dress that were the series’ mainstay from Flying Down to Rio through Swing Time we’re in a woodsy country club with patrons joining in the dance, and who wants that? Fortunately, Fred and Ginger get a good Berlin ballad (“Change Partners”) and subsequent dance routine in which he uses his big, expressive hands in an attempt to re-hypnotize her. Even better, Astaire has a jaw-dropping bit, set to a wordless tune (“Since They Turned ‘Loch Lomond’ into Swing”) in which he rhythmically hits one golf ball after another, sending every one of them soaring in perfect arcs, the entire routine performed in long, sustained camera shots. Was there nothing the man couldn’t do?\n\nThe Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939) Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers’ last RKO picture is also their most unusual: A “biopic” celebrating the first great, and most influential, ballroom dance team in America. Astaire’s approach to the dancing was so scrupulous (Vernon Castle was one of his youthful idols) that aficionados of Astaire and Rogers may be disappointed because they are dancing in character, and keeping to the style that made the Castles household names in the period between 1912 and 1918, especially their wildly popular “Castle Walk.” Astaire and Rogers were far better-looking than the Castles, and their teaming, still fresh on this, their ninth collaboration, makes their Vernon and Irene the most romantic pair imaginable. The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle is not, thankfully, a musical biography — no phony, Cole Porter-being-inspired-to-compose-“Night and Day”-by-raindrops moments here. The music is made up almost entirely of period instrumentals that accompany the Castles as they dance. There is only one original song (“Only When You’re in My Arms” by Con Conrad, Herman Ruby and Bert Kalmar), and it’s used as a diegetic source, Vernon singing the lyric as he works up the nerve to propose to Irene Foote. I’m always a little annoyed when I see the picture that the Foote’s family retainer was changed to a white man and played by Walter Brennan, although given the prevailing tendency in Hollywood to depict black men and women as “coons” for comic relief, it’s probably just as well that Walter Ash was written white.\n\nThis is the only RKO “Fred & Ginger” in which the pair portray a married couple (they’re also married in The Barkleys of Broadway, but that was 10 years later, at MGM) and while there is some tension between Vernon and Irene early on in their story, the typical screwball courting elements are, obviously, absent. Similarly, although the Castles’ eventual agent is played by the wry, eccentric Edna May Oliver and she becomes a genial confidante to the pair, she isn’t a full-blown zany like Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Helen Broderick or Alice Brady in the earlier Astaire-Rogers pictures. She’s only mildly zany. (Speaking of zanies: You may recognize Leonid Kinskey as the artist in Paris whom Oliver patronizes from his appearance as the bartender Sasha in Casablanca, ardent for Madeline Lebeau.) The movie is pleasantly directed by H. C. Potter, Robert de Grasse provided rich, warm photography, and there are some striking visual effects by Vernon L. Walker, particularly the sequence where the couple dances across a map of the United States. However, the affecting grief of the scene in which Walter breaks the news of Vernon’s shocking death to Irene, and Rogers’ fine acting of it, is almost canceled out by the terrible dialogue Brennan is given to speak. Astaire is engaging, as he nearly always is, yet in some ways Vernon and Irene Castle is a showcase for Rogers, from her hilariously overblown rendition of “The Yama-Yama Man” to the moment, late in the picture, when Irene unexpectedly meets Vernon, an RAF volunteer, in a nightclub and as he embraces her she whispers, “Oh, Vernon” in a way that in its emotion and anxiety seems to anticipate her husband’s later needless death. Rogers gives a beautiful performance in what Arlene Croce in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book rightly calls “a very dear film.”\n\nFor the record, the screenplay was by Richard Sherman, Oscar Hammerstein II and Dorothy Yost. The movie is often referred to as a flop. It wasn’t — it was popular with the public — but its budget (approximately $1,196,000) meant that even its high gross ($1,825,000) did not allow it to break even.\n\n*Swing Time has been made available on Blu-ray in the Criterion Collection, presumably because the inveterate auteurists at Criterion regard it as a director’s picture rather than as a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie.\n\n†Caldwell, one of the most prolific librettists of her time, frequently collaborated with Jerome Kern. Together the pair wrote one of the most charming numbers heard in a stage musical (She’s a Good Fellow, 1919) of the early 20th century, “The Bullfrog Patrol.” This delightful harmonized duet, originally performed by the Duncan Sisters, virtually defines what the Germans mean by the term Ohrwurm, which we translate as “earworm.” Caldwell is virtually forgotten today, but my hat is off to a lyricist who could write a line like, “I wish that Bolsheviki froggy-dog would croak!” I realize the song is written (and composed) in a minstrel form, which today puts it, I suppose, automatically beyond the… er… pale… but listening to Jeanne Lehman and Rebecca Luker’s 1992 version of it always gives me enormous pleasure.\n\n‡And no, Virginia, “jig” when applied to dance is not racist terminology, despite the teeth-gnashing of the Woke Ignoratti. (Nor is it, even if Millennials and their Gen-Z successors believe so, interchangeable with the word “gig.”) “Jigger,” it will shock them to learn, is innocent as well. These people are like the old movie censors: By their hysteria they suggest that their own racist impulses are at work in their protestations; by their volubility, they only encourage the rest of us to use the words they object to more often.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Dark Crystal (1982) This Jim Henson/Franz Oz collaboration was visually impressive and dramatically anemic in 1982, and the passage of four decades has not diminished the former nor improved the latter. Its David Odell screenplay (from a screen story by Henson) is an oleo of warmed-over Tolkein crossed with Henson’s old ”Land of Gorch” sketches for “Saturday Night.” The picture is short on both humor and wonder, although the puppetry is, as usual for Henson, beautifully designed and managed. It’s essentially Elves vs. Orcs for control of the future, with the Orcs represented by vulture-like creatures called Skeksis, and the outcome is never in doubt. Since there is no suspense, and the characters are defined more by what species they are than by what they say or do, there’s little to occupy either mind or heart. (The most interesting characters are the astronomer Aughra, whose voice was provided by Billie Whitelaw, and the Skeksis Chamberlain skekSil, voiced by Barry Dennen.) It’s certainly worth seeing once, for the puppet designs and for Oswald Morris’ richly textured photography. The recent 4K UHD edition is sumptuous-looking.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee (1935) After their brief duet on “The Carioca” in Flying Down to Rio set up a public clamor for more, a re-teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers by RKO was inevitable. Their first starring vehicle was an adaptation of Astaire’s last Broadway success (The Gay Divorce, a title apparently taboo under the Production Code) and in the blinkered tradition of Hollywood studio lunacy the entire Cole Porter stage score was tossed with the exception of “Night and Day,” its biggest hit. Although the movie isn’t as buoyant as the team’s best work it’s a lively picture, funny, absurd and engaging. It also sets the template for the Astaire-Rogers series: Initial dislike of Fred by Ginger (or like followed by misunderstanding leading to dislike, or some other variation on the theme), cast of wacky supporting actors (such as Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Erik Rhodes, the wisecracking Helen Broderick or, here, the charming Alice Brady), screwball complications, a romantic dance and, if we’re lucky, a challenge. I’m one of those oddballs — Pauline Kael was another — who prefer the non-romantic Fred & Ginger routines to their more celebrated ballroom turns, except (as in Follow the Fleet and Swing Time) when the duets are dramatic. Many think the essence of Astaire and Rogers are items like “Cheek to Cheek” and, here, “Night and Day,” and they’re marvelous expressions of romance but they don’t, at least for me, carry the absolute joy of “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” “Let Yourself Go” and “Pick Yourself Up”… the latter pair of which, juxtaposed that way, sound like an answer in one of those ironic double-feature puzzles. Dances like those sum up the appeal of Astaire and Rogers as a team far more than the formal love-duets; although they, like the ballroom dances, were thoroughly worked out, they feel spontaneous in a way the romantic dances never can. You get a sense, despite the sweat, of the joy of performance in “Isn’t it a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain?),” for example, and despite Astaire’s displeasure at being part of a team again after his sister Adele broke up the act, of the pleasure each performer took in the other.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee was directed by Mark Sandrich, who guided Astaire and Rogers in more pictures than anyone else, and his crisp style is as much a part of the team’s work as those white Art Deco sets and the loopy plots, usually cobbled by Allan Scott or Dwight Taylor. (This one was written by by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman, but the original stage book was by Taylor.) David Abel’s beautiful cinematography, evident here, was on display in five of the nine pictures Astaire and Rogers made together at RKO as well as Holiday Inn, also directed by Sandrich. In this initial offering, the producers (or producer, since Pardo S. Berman was credited) hadn’t yet grasped that Astaire and Rogers were what people wanted to see, not elaborate musical numbers with a cast of thousands, so we get “The Continental” for 17 exhausting minutes, only a few of which are given over to Ginger and Fred. Worse, the creators assigned an entirely extraneous number to Edward Everett Horton(!) and a young Betty Grable, “Let’s K-nock K-nees,” which when I see it always makes me think of Arlene Croce’s riposte in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book: “Must we?” The “Night and Day” dance, on the other hand, based on the stage version choreographed by Fred, is one of the duets people who love the team remember best, and it’s beautifully worked out. The picture ends with another of Fred’s cleverly conceived dances from the stage show, in which he and Rogers sail over the sofas and chairs of his hotel suite, and it’s so casually charming it makes you grin in deep appreciation.\n\nA personal note: I first saw The Gay Divocee at a summer afternoon library screening about 40 years ago. Seated behind my friend and me were a pair of elderly Jewish women, complete with Molly Picon accents. When the picture began with nightclub patrons, including Fred, playing with little legless dolls through which their forefingers were inserted to make them “dance,” one of the women cooed happily to her companion, “Cute!… is that cute?”\n\nI can never see this movie without recalling the pleasure my friend and I got from that, at that moment and for years afterward in the remembering.\n\nTwilight’s Last Gleaming (1977) A very effective nuclear-nightmare thriller directed by Robert Aldrich which did not find much love when it was released but which deserves a far wider audience. Based by Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch on a good early ’70s novel by the reliable Walter Wager the story, about a band of escaped convicts led by a former Army general who take over a missile launching site, while far-fetched, is taut and tidy and builds nicely to its unexpected conclusion. Burt Lancaster is the general (of course) and his gang includes the always-wonderful Paul Winfield and a typically weaselly Burt Young. On the government side are the unmatchable Melvyn Douglas as the Secretary of Defense, Joseph Cotten as the Secretary of State, Richard Widmark as a duplicitous Air Force general, the excellent Gerald S. O’Loughlin as the White House chief of staff, and Charles Durning as the president. The part was offered to Henry Fonda, who passed, and Durning not only delivers a superb performance, but the role turns out to be the great one of the picture.\n\nCohen and Huebsch cannily upped the ante for Lancaster, making what in Wager is merely a bid for money and freedom far more selfless and democratically sound (the general becomes a kind of Ellsberg figure), making the climax both shocking and inevitable. Aldrich, whose direction seems to me ideal for a movie of this kind, makes extensive use of split-screen throughout the picture, feeling that “you couldn’t tell that story in less than three hours without them.” There are times when the split-screens feel excessive, although it’s possible they would seem less so on a big theater screen. Yet they’re brilliantly manipulated overall, and even when the dialogue in one panel overlaps with that in another, you never miss who is speaking or what is being said; as with Howard Hawks’ overlapping dialogue, nothing of importance is lost. The movie’s crystalline cinematography is by Robert B. Hauser, the kinetic editing is by Michael Luciano, William Martin and Maury Winetrobe and Jerry Goldsmith provided a brief but very effective musical score. The terrific supporting cast includes Richard Jaeckel, William Marshall, Leif Erickson, Charles Aidman, Charles McGraw, John Ratzenberger and, in too brief a role, Roscoe Lee Browne.\n\nRoberta (1935) Such were the vagaries of the 1930s Hollywood studio system that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, fresh from their triumph in The Gay Divorcee, were cast as supporting characters in this adaptation of the Jerome Kern/Otto Harbach stage musical. One doesn’t mind so much that their over-the-title co-star is the charming Irene Dunne; that Randolph Scott is given equal weight is practically an offense against God and Mammon. His performance in this, and in the subsequent Follow the Fleet (see below) leave one to marvel that he ever had an important career, or that he may have been the love of Cary Grant’s young life. I hope at least he was good in bed, because he certainly stinks up this movie.\n\nWhen Fred and Ginger are on screen, or Helen Westley as Dunne’s eponymous dress-designing aunt, or Dunne herself is singing “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” Roberta is first-rate entertainment. So let’s concentrate on those strengths, shall we, and forget if we can Scott’s performance and the number of times he says something is “swell”? Fred plays a bandleader, and gets a lively number (“Let’s Begin”) with his musicians, notably Candy Candido, with whom he does a kind of genderfuck bit avant la lettre. Ginger is Fred’s American former girlfriend, passing herself off as a Polish countess (I’m not kidding) in Paris. Although Astaire and Rogers do one of their ballroom specialties, to “Lovely to Look At” and “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” their two other numbers are a lot more fun: The satirical “I Won’t Dance” and “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” one of those joyous episodes of thoroughly worked-out yet seemingly impromptu hoofing that were, even more than their signature romantic duets, their peculiar specialty. On the debit side, Dunne has to perform “Yesterdays,” featuring one of Harbach’s worst sets of lyrics. No singer, not even one as lyrical as Irene Dunne, can be expected to triumph with lyrics like,\n\nYesterdays\n\nDays I knew as happy sweet\n\nSequestered days […]\n\nThen gay youth was mine\n\nAnd truth was mine\n\nJoyous free and flaming life\n\nForsooth was mine\n\nWho in the 1930s talked like that, let alone sang? That last bit is so convoluted and linguistically passé it occasioned one of Billie Holiday’s few recorded lyric flubs.\n\nWilliam A. Seiter, most of whose pictures were mediocrities, directed with intelligence and a certain gracefulness of style that does what it can to make the material seem more interesting than it is. Alan Scott was one of the three credited screenwriters, and the author of the movie’s “additional dialogue” was the same Glenn Tryon who starred in the 1926 silent comedy 45 Minutes from Hollywood, with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in brief cameos, and who would go on to star in two movies (Lonesome and Broadway) for the expressionistic Hungarian director Paul Fejos before drifting into screenwriting and direction.\n\nBetty Boop: The Essential Collection, Volume I – IV (1930 – 1938) These four Blu-Rays from the sadly now defunct Olive Films represent both the best of the series produced by Max Fleischer and directed by his brother Dave, and the worst. The Fleischers weren’t entirely to blame for the decline of the Betty Boop cartoons; once the Production Code went into full force, Betty was made less sexy and more respectable, and it killed her character: Her innocent sexuality was what made her so appealing; without that she had no real reason for being. External pressures to one side, there is absolutely no excuse for items like the 1937 Betty and Grampy short Zula Hula with its astonishingly crude and insensitive African caricatures. The Fleischers have been criticized for things like turning Louis Armstrong into a cartoon cannibal chasing Bimbo and Koko the Clown in I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead, You Rascal You (1932) but the natives in Zula Hula are offensive beyond my ability to comprehend the why of them. You could almost forgive that if the damn thing was funny, but none of the later Boops is amusing in the slightest. It was as if, having been robbed of the slight, daring whiff of salaciousness that clung to Betty’s character, the Fleischers didn’t know what the hell to do with her. The animation in the shorts continued to be exceptional, but what good is that if you aren’t laughing?\n\nFortunately the discs contain all the great Betty Boop cartoons from the early ’30s, when the Fleischers’ invention, sense of humor and casual surrealism were in their glory. (Speaking of stereotypes: There are several “pansy” gags in the Bettys; when a Frankenstein monster threatens her in Betty Boop’s Penthouse and she hits him with plant spray he turns first into a ballet dancer and then into a literal pansy.) One of the visual aspects of the Boop shorts I like best are the thick, Art Nouveau lines around the characters; it gives them a distinctive look that can’t be mistaken for the product of any other studio. The Fleischers were enamored of the Rotoscope technique Max had developed and used it, I think, excessively. This is nowhere better illustrated than in the 1938 Thrills and Chills, in which when Betty skates on the ice she becomes weirdly elongated, and it’s obvious her head and body have been drawn over those of a live model… and the business just goes on and on, as if Dave was so in love with the process he just couldn’t stop Rotoscoping.\n\nJust as Disney and Ub Iwerks were the products of their Midwestern upbringings, the Fleischers were New York to their core. That’s reflected not only in the daring sexiness of the shorts but in their soundtracks, which not only tend to the jazzy; several times they employ jazz and swing musicians, especially Cab Calloway, who is in three Betty Boop cartoons, cleverly Rotoscoped. In the bizarre Minnie the Moocher (1932) he appears as a walrus with a bobtail; in the fantastic The Old Man of the Mountain (1933) he’s the eponymous villain; and in what may be the single best entry in the series, the 1933 Snow-White, the Wicked Queen in her witch guise transforms Koko into a ghost with long human legs who dances to “Saint James Infirmary” via Calloway’s hip vocal and trademark sliding movements. Other disc highlights: The wildly surrealistic Bimbo’s Initiation (1931) satirizing fraternity rites; the clever Stop That Noise (1935); the two-strip Technicolor Poor Cinderella (1934) featuring Max’s beloved 3D effects, achieved through the use of small motorized sets against which the animated drawings were superimposed; the charming Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (1934); the melodrama spoof She Wronged Him Right (1934); and Betty Boop’s Bizzy Bee (1932) in which she runs a diner whose sole menu item seems to be hotcakes.\n\nSunset (1988) An amiable pastiche written and directed by Blake Edwards (based on unpublished manuscript by Rod Amateau) set in late-1920s Hollywood and teaming Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix to investigate a murder mystery involving studio power, gangsters and the fabled corrupt Los Angeles law enforcement James Ellroy has built a career on. That Earp is played by James Garner and Mix by Bruce Willis, on the cusp of his Die Hard stardom, is a good indication of the charm factor attending this slight but most enjoyable fantasia from one of the last great American purveyors of pleasure at the movies.\n\nGarner had played Earp 20 years earlier, in the post-OK Corral The Hour of the Gun, and it was bitter portraiture, grim and obsessive. The Earp of Sunset is more mellow if no less tough and determined and Garner gives the sort of relaxed, intensely likable performance that had become his personal metier, nicely matched by Willis’ laconic good humor. The autumnal cinematography was the work of Anthony B. Richmond, Henry Mancini provided a tuneful, engaging musical score, and the rich supporting cast includes Mariel Hemingway, Kathleen Quinlan, the director’s daughter Jennifer Edwards, Richard Bradford, M. Emmet Walsh, Joe Dallesandro, Dann Florek, Dermot Mulroney, the wonderful Patricia Hodge as the wronged woman in the case and Malcolm McDowell as her shady, dangerous husband. A truly sick character, McDowell’s is perhaps the ultimate creative expression of the difference between a beloved public clown and his dark private persona. Edwards, who had directed Peter Sellers in six pictures, had been around Hollywood for decades and who suffered throughout his life his own periods of debilitating depression — not for nothing was he known by his friends as “Blackie” — knew that comedy produces more than its share of unusually disturbed individuals.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Earp really did serve as a technical advisor in Hollywood, for Mix and others.\n\nThe Last Picture Show (1971) Criterion’s new 4K UHD edition of Peter Bogdanovich’s 1992 Director’s Cut convinces me that this rich evocation by the filmmaker and Larry McMurtry of the latter’s early novel depicting adolescence in a blighted 1950s Texas town is not only among the finest of all American movies of the 1970s but quite possibly Bogdanovich’s best work.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941) John Huston’s debut as a screenwriter-director and the second important step in Humphrey Bogart’s ascendancy to stardom following High Sierra retains its status as one of the most perfect entertainments of the studio era. The “Warner 100” 4K UHD edition brings out of the rich quality of Arthur Edeson’s already sumptuous lighting.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Another old favorite revisited in its recent 4K UHD restoration. Last year’s 4K Cinderella unaccountably destroyed the beauty of Marc Davis’ miraculous rendering of its heroine’s fairy-dust transformation before the ball. This version of Snow White on the other hand is mouth-watering, the movie’s already remarkable look burnished and enhanced by the process.\n\nTexasville (1990; Black-and-White Director’s Cut) Included on the new Criterion edition of The Last Picture Show, this warm-hearted sequel is presented in the form its director envisioned; In black-and-white, and lengthened by nearly 30 minutes, deepening the relationships and bringing out more of its comic values.\n\nTop Hat (1935) No one should be forced to choose a single Astaire-Rogers musical, and I am always torn between this one and Swing Time. Top Hat is probably the better movie: it’s swifter, more sparkling, lays some nice emphasis on those two incomparable sissies Eric Blore and Edward Everett Horton, and boasts a perfect Irving Berlin score including a title song that elegantly sums up the appeal of Fred Astaire, whom Graham Greene once called the human equivalent of Mickey Mouse. That isn’t the insult it seems; in the early ‘30s Mickey was not yet the figure of dull respectability he became; he was rambunctious, elastic, mischievous, even slightly cruel — just like Fred.\n\nPerhaps inspired by their “Let Yourself Go” duet in Follow the Fleet Astaire and Rogers also get a challenge-dance here to “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain?)” that is not only among their half-dozen or so best routines, it’s also a rapturous expression of the sheer joy of performance. If these two didn’t fall in love after a number like that, one of them would have to be frigid and the other gay. After the requisite complications, masquerades and misunderstandings, the pair performs Berlin’s lilting, sensuous “Cheek to Cheek” in a Venice ballroom and featuring Ginger’s feathered dress which, although it drove her partner to distraction, proved that she understood what looked best on her when she danced with him; and another of those new dance sensations, “The Piccolino,” led off by Ginger’s charming verse and chorus. This brings me to a side-note: However wonderful a performer Fred Astaire was — and aside from his status as the finest dancer the movies have ever known he was also one of the American songbook’s great stylists — compare the way he listens to Ginger singing with the way in which she takes in his vocalizations: He smiles a lot but looks faintly glazed; she hangs on every word whether she’s facing him or not, and always seems to be hearing them for the first time. She not only (in the cartoonist Bob Thaves’ memorable phrase) “did everything Fred did, backwards and in heels”; at times she also acted him off the screen.\n\nAll of the members of the RKO Astaire-Rogers machine were involved here: The producer Pando S. Berman; the director Mark Sandrich (he made five of their pictures, and his style is modest but elegant and his pacing is nearly always perfect); the screenwriters Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor; the cinematographer David Abel, whose polished black-and-white photography is what we think of when we remember the Astaire-Rogers pictures, along with those gloriously anachronistic all-white Art Deco sets designed by Carroll Clark but erroneously attributed the wonderfully-named Van Nest Polglase (Venice never looked so clean); the choreography was by Fred with Hermes Pan; the musical direction and orchestrations were by Hal Bourne; and the cast includes Erik Rhodes as a silly, English-mangling Italian co-respondent, Horton as Fred’s manager, the vermouth-dry Helen Broderick as his wife and Blore as his butler Bates, who feuds with him throughout and whose machinations resolve the plot. The main titles, incidentally, are fairly unique for their time, with first Fred’s feet and legs dancing into the frame and appearing above his name, and then Ginger’s. It’s a marvelously stylish gesture, almost a shorthand, one that hints at the spirited revelry to come.\n\nProduced on a relatively lavish Depression-era budget of $609,000, Top Hat brought in $3.2 million at the box-office, and became the most profitable RKO release of the decade.\n\nFollow the Fleet (1936) Adhering to the pattern set by Roberta in 1935 (and why would you want to?) RKO once again made Astaire and Rogers more or less subservient to Randolph Scott. As if that wasn’t bad enough the men play sailors, and Astaire’s idea of expressing his working-class bona fides is to constantly be chewing gum.\n\nWell, at least Irving Berlin wrote the songs. Ginger gets the sexy “Let Yourself Go,” which she and Fred then dance to, in an “impromptu” ballroom contest exhibition. It’s one of their most joyous numbers, performed by both of them with a rubber-legged, loose-limbed panache that makes you smile broadly throughout. Most of Fred’s numbers are done with his Navy band (“We Saw The Sea,” “I’d Rather Lead A Band,” “I’m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket”) but Harriet Hilliard, the future Mrs. Ozzie Nelson (and mother of Ricky) has a splendid solo in “Get Thee Behind Me, Satan.” I know I’m in the minority in believing this to be one of Berlin’s finest ballads, but it is in any case beautifully framed by the director Mark Sandrich and his cinematographer David Abel, and at least partially redeems the horrible “Why, without your glasses you’re beautiful!” old-maid cliché Hilliard is forced to endure before she sings. (Berlin originally wrote the song, interestingly, for Rogers to perform in Top Hat. Obviously, he thought well of it.) What makes Follow the Fleet special, however, and secures it a place in movie musical history (or at least, in Astaire-Rogers iconography) is the “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” number. It was the most dramatic entry in the series until “Never Gonna Dance” in Swing Time displaced it a year later, and its seriousness of intent — it begins with Fred and Ginger in a gambling den, separately losing their bankrolls and contemplating suicide — is almost shocking in the context of so light an entertainment, and the dance between them is so charged with unstated emotionalism it’s hair-raising.\n\nThe screenplay was credited to Allan and Scott Dwight Taylor with “Additional Dialogue,” as they used to say, by Lew Lipton. At least in this one Randolph Scott doesn’t say “Swell!” every other line. Sharp eyes will spot Betty Grable as a trio singer, Lucille Ball in a small role and Humphrey Bogart as a sailor. The Hubert Osbourne 1922 play Shore Leave, on which Follow the Fleet was based, incidentally, had a long afterlife: It was also the source for the 1927 Vincent Youmans musical Hit the Deck, itself filmed by MGM in 1955.\n\nTouch of Evil (1958) Kino’s 4K UHD edition of the dark, unsettling Orson Welles thriller reminds us that this skewed police procedural is one of the key pictures, both in Welles’ filmography, and of the decade in which it was made.\n\nThe Trial (1962) Orson Welles‘ adaptation of the Kafka novel has always been the movie of his I like least… or was, anyway, before I saw his television film of the Isek Dinesen The Immortal Story, which I like even less. I feel in this a bit like the filmmaker’s disciple Peter Bogdanovich, whom Welles never tired of twitting by referring to The Trial as “that picture you hate.” It’s difficult to say exactly what it is about it that leaves me cold; it’s one of those movies that works in nearly every individual scene yet never comes together for me in a fully satisfying manner. In the early ’80s I heard an academic posit on “All Things Considered” that Dr. Strangelove could not be considered an entirely successful satire because there isn’t a single sane character in it, but Candide is brilliant satire and no one could consider its eponymous hero remotely sane until the end. Still, there is no one in Welles’ version of The Trial with whom we can entirely identify, and perhaps that’s the problem. The confusion of Anthony Perkins’ Josef K. about what is happening to him is palpable (Perkins is very good) but, at least as the writer-director of this movie envisions him, K. is snide and ambitious and guilty of indeterminate social crimes that distance him from us as surely as he distances himself from his insurance company employees by occupying an elevated office from which to conspicuously lord it over them.\n\nWelles was famously forced to improvise his sets for The Trial when the funding fell through, filming the picture in the then largely abandoned Gare d’Orsay, which has since become the Musée d’Orsay, and the riveted walls give the images an otherworldly quality that adds measurably to the picture’s feeling of an endless nightmare. The new 4K UHD Criterion print restores it to something I assume approximates its original pictorial brilliance, light and shadow beautifully in balance. (The richly textured cinematography was by Edmond Richard.) In addition to Perkins, Welles gets marvelous performances from Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli, Suzanne Flon, Akim Tamiroff, Madeleine Robinson, William Chappell and himself as the satanic Advocate, smoke cigar rising from his head like something emerging from the vents of Hell.\n\nFor the record, I admit I liked The Trial a little better this time. Perhaps in another 10 years and another five screenings I’ll come to consider it one of Welles’ best… but I doubt it.\n\nCopyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs always, click on the highlighted text for links and fuller reviews.\n\nApril 2023\n\nRodgers & Hammerstein’s “Cinderella” (1957) / The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella (1976) / Walt Disney’s Cinderella (1950) The most pleasing and cherished (at least, by me) musical versions of the Perrault fairy tale.\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989) The utterly charming musical fable that announced a new Renaissance in Disney animation and was perhaps its fullest flowering.\n\nThe Big Country (1958) A large, pacifist Western nicely directed by William Wyler on a widescreen color canvas. Based by the screenwriters James R. Webb, Sy Bartlett and Robert Wilder on a literate Saturday Evening Post serial by Donald Hamilton, it’s a fish-out-water tale, about a retired sea captain (Gregory Peck) coming West to marry and realizing he’s landed in the middle of a range-war between his wealthy prospective father-in-law (Charles Bickford) and the uncouth patriarch (Burl Ives) of a rattle-trap community, both dependent on the same source of water for the respective lives of their cattle. The Big Country was one of those huge widescreen spectacles designed to pry television viewers away from their sets and back into the theaters, and it fails to the extent that it didn’t go all the way; Wyler, who left the production unfinished to begin Ben-Hur in Rome, overshot, resulting in a picture that was much too long and had to be drastically edited down. The cuts are often noticeably poor, too many shots subsequently don’t match and Carroll Baker disappears from the picture, her story unresolved.\n\nStill, the performances are good, especially those of Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Chuck Connors, Burl Ives and, of all people. Charlton Heston as Peck’s rival for Baker’s hand. His character isn’t the vicious sexual opportunist of Hamilton’s story but Heston still doesn’t play for sympathy, and when he’s seen naked from the waist up it almost seems the Technirama process was developed just to contain his big chest. There’s a beautifully controlled sequence of him and Peck in an epic fistfight, the point of which is to prove to Heston’s character just how futile such violence really is. Franz F. Planer’s cinematography is often exquisite, and while it is largely comprised of a theme and variations, Jerome Moross’ music constitutes one of the most remarkable, and well-remembered, of all American Western movie scores.\n\nMy Sister Eileen (1955) Harry Cohn of Columbia wanted to make a movie of the Leonard Bernstein-Betty Comden and Adolph Green musical Wonderful Town, wouldn’t pay the asking price for the rights, and made the movie anyway. This is one of those bland, dispiriting, shrill and occasionally downright stupid 1950s movie musicals of the type that turn people away from all musicals, and that despite Betty Garrett and Jack Lemmon in the leading roles and a spirited challenge-dance between Tommy Rall and Bob Fosse in a Greenwich Village alley that almost convinces you the movie was worth filming. (Fosse also choreographed.) Blake Edwards and Richard Quine wrote the often witless screenplay and Jule Styne and Leo Robin the ho-hum song score, with studio lawyers standing over the shoulders of all four of them to make sure nothing was too close to anything in Wonderful Town.\n\nIf you can’t make the picture you want, what the hell is the point of making it at all?\n\nWonderful Town (1958 CBS Television live broadcast) I’ve been in love with the television cast album of Wonderful Town for nearly 50 years, after discovering it in a cache of Broadway LPs selling for 50 cents apiece in a thrift store when I was 13. The 1953 show itself is a bit of a nothing, yet another adaptation of Ruth McKenney’s humorous autobiographical stories and the play Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov made from them, accenting (and wanly satirizing) the eccentricities of all those artsy/crazy Greenwich Village types of the popular imagination circa 1935.\n\nBut that score! Leonard Bernstein only composed five Broadway musicals, but four of them were classics: On the Town, Candide, West Side Story and this one, which contains arguably his most crowd-pleasing set of songs, with witty, funny (the two are not always aligned) and literate lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the whole thing written in two weeks and for a star, Rosalind Russell, with a range of about four notes. Those songs dazzled me in 1974, and still make me grin today, although it’s taken me nearly a half-century to finally “get” all the 1930s references in the show’s two best numbers, Russell’s wildly inventive advertisement for a dive-bar, “Swing” and her hilariously tongue-twisting attempt to interview members of the Brazilian Navy, “Conga!”\n\nThe existing video for Wonderful Town is a much-replicated copy of a kinescope, barely watchable. But it preserves one of the great musical-comedy scores, more or less intact (“Pass That Football” is on the LP and subsequent CD but was dropped from the final broadcast) as well as its most inspired performance. As Ruth, Rosalind Russell does nearly everything she did well, and more; her wry way with a comic line makes even a mild wisecrack sound like something out of Sheridan or Wilde, and she gets such a work-out in “Conga!” you can’t imagine her performing it six nights a week plus matinees. In the brilliantly contrived “Conversation Piece,” her spoken attempt to salvage the ongoing wreck of a small gathering is beyond price and the way she delivers it is almost like a song, her final line a comedic dying fall:\n\nI was re-reading Moby-Dick the other day.\n\nI haven’t picked that up since, uh…\n\nWell, I don’t suppose any of us has.\n\nWell, it’s…\n\n…worth picking up again.\n\nIt’s about this…\n\n…whale.\n\nEat a Bowl of Tea (1989) A lively and colorful, if not scrupulously faithful, adaptation by the screenwriter Judith Rascoe and the director Wayne Wang of Louis Chu’s 1961 novel of Chinese-American mores in late-1940s New York. Beautifully lit by the cinematographer Amir Mokri and well performed by a cast of terrific actors, Eat a Bowl of Tea is consistently diverting but doesn’t solve one of the novel’s more nettlesome flaws, the contradictory actions and character of the young Chinese wife Mei Oi (Cora Miao). I suppose a latter-day feminist would roll her eyes at me for wondering why this traditional Old World bride would take a lover, especially one as loathsome as the odious little gangster Ah Song, who seduces and essentially rapes her. Mei Oi’s reasons for infidelity are explicable — her young husband, Ben Loy, is impotent with her, leading her to think he does not love her — but her actions seem to go against reason. Wang has a nice eye for period flavor and is a fine judge of behavior, Russell Wong makes an engaging Ben Loy, Victor Wong is splendid as his father Wah Gay, Hui Fun has some lovely moments as his mainland Chinese mother and there is a marvelous sequence in which Wah Gay stalks Ah Song with a butcher knife, wonderfully shot and edited to Pat Suzuki’s rendition of “How High the Moon.” The recording is an anachronism, as it also was in the movie of Neil Simon’s Biloxi Blues, but it works so well it’s hard to envision the sequence without it; the filmmakers alter forever the way we hear that music.\n\nPoltergeist (1982) The luscious-looking 4K UHD edition of my favorite spook movie. Only cavil: The typically paltry “extras.”\n\nMay 2023\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) Although I last watched John Ford’s late-period masterwork only a year and a half ago, I could not resist revisiting it in its new “Paramount Presents” 4K UHD iteration. I first saw this sober rumination on notoriety and violence — in the James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck screenplay, as in Dorothy M. Johnson’s original short story, the two seem inextricably wedded — on a big theater screen in the early 1980s and have viewed it numerous time since in various home-video formats. It has never looked as good in any of them.\n\nThe Sons of Katie Elder (1965) One of those utterly inconsequential Westerns directed by Henry Hathaway which cause you to wonder how his name could ever have meant anything to anyone. It’s one thing to see John Wayne and Dean Martin together; that’s one of the pleasures of watching Rio Bravo. But to be asked to accept them as brothers is really pushing at the limits of credulity. Worse, as their youngest sibling, Michael Anderson Jr. at 22 gives a performance of such juvenile brattiness even a pacifist could be forgiven for longing to see his older brothers beat him to a bloody mass. Lucien Ballard’s photography is, as always with this painter of light, exemplary, Elmer Bernstein contributed one of his rousing Western scores, and the supporting cast includes James Gregory as the chief villain, George Kennedy as a sadistic hired killer and that noted man-boy (as the voice actor as Billy West deemed him) Percy Helton. Dennis Hopper, as was his wont, overacts appallingly.\n\nThe Reluctant Dragon (1941) / Saludos Amigos (1942) / The Three Caballeros (1944) / Make Mine Music (1946) / Melody Time (1948) / Fun and Fancy Free (1947) After years of avoiding them except in excerpt form — the only way to really enjoy the best segments in them — I finally sat down with the entire run of Walt Disney’s animated anthology movies, which constituted his studio’s entire feature output between Bambi in 1942 and Cinderella in 1950.\n\n10 Rillington Place (1971) While this documentary-like representation of the activities of the British murderer and sexual sadist John Christie is scrupulously detailed and in no way exploitative, it left me profoundly depressed. Richard Attenborough’s performance as Christie is also above reproach, among the most chillingly delineated portraits of banal human evil ever committed to film. John Hurt is equally impressive as Timothy Evans, the husband and father of two of Christie’s victims, executed for the crimes before Christie’s serial guilt came to light. (His brother-in-law maintains that Evans, not Christie, murdered his sister and their little daughter.) The taut screenplay by Clive Exton and the matter-of-fact direction by Richard Fleischer seem to me exemplary, yet the depiction of post-war squalor and the accumulation of quietly disturbing detail are profoundly unsettling and are perhaps most safely consumed by those with less susceptible sensibilities than mine.\n\nAnnie Hall (1977) Woody Allen’s sixth picture as writer and director was my Star Wars, the movie I saw over and over when I was 16 and 17. I had been an avid Allen fan before this, but nothing in his filmography to that date had prepared any of us who admired him for the look of Annie Hall, its form and style or the sheer leap by its maker from workmanlike director of crazy-quilt satire to inspired chronicler of contemporary human comedy. Yet for all my youthful love of Annie Hall I have avoided seeing it again, for decades — not because of Allen’s legal difficulties over the absurd accusations of child-molestation brought (and in the case of their little daughter, thoroughly coached) by a spurned harpy and serial collector of children, but due to the diminishing quality of his movies, and the obsessive, hostile manner in which a man who had previously exhibited a consistent ability to create fully-dimensional women characters suddenly kept giving us blonde dim-bulb/whore stand-ins for Mia Farrow; my ardor for new Woody Allen movies was tested with Bullets Over Broadway (1994), cratered with the appalling Mighty Aphrodite (1995) and was, finally, extinguished with the 1998 Celebrity, which constitutes the whiniest, nastiest cri de cœur against the public by an American filmmaker since Allen’s Stardust Memories in 1980. I have seen none of his subsequent pictures, and don’t intend to.\n\nHappily, revisiting Annie Hall 46(!) years on gave me the deep pleasure so conspicuously absent from what he was churning out three decades ago, and reminded me anew of what I had so admired in 1977. Yes, Alvy Singer, the Allen character, is annoyingly self-righteous, snarkily sarcastic, blind to his considerable flaws and utterly and self-destructively inflexible, character defects I was too young to recognize at 16 due in part to my youth, in part to my longstanding amusement at Allen’s humor but largely I think because the moving frame around Alvy was so fresh and dazzling to me; when I saw Hannah and Her Sisters ten years later, the nearly identical Allen character nearly sent me out of the theater in a rage. Throughout the action of Annie Hall Alvy addresses the camera, has pointed exchanges with strangers on the street, revisits his childhood home and school classroom both as an observer and to debate the figures of his past, has his and Annie’s thoughts expressed in subtitles, finds himself in an animated cartoon with Snow White’s sexy stepmother, watches as Annie’s spirit disengages while he’s making love to her body (“That’s what I call detached!”) and, memorably, produces Marshall McLuhan from behind a movie theater display to deflate a pompous academic.\n\nAll of this befits a movie that evolved drastically in the shooting. Allen’s and Marshall Brickman’s original screenplay (and the film they delivered to the editor Ralph Rosenblum) was less clearly defined narratively — a murder mystery plot later resurfaced 16 years later as the charming Manhattan Murder Mystery — and Alvy’s romance with Annie was only one part of several threads. Perhaps this is why Allen dismissed Annie Hall not long after its release, claiming “it massages the prejudice of the middle class.” Or maybe it was the movie’s being given all those Academy Awards he deplored? In any event, the picture was gloriously photographed by Gordon Willis, featured Colleen Dewhurst, Carol Kane, Paul Simon and Shelley Duvall (“Trans-splendid!”) in telling small roles and, as Annie, Diane Keaton in her first good one after The Godfather Part II and her fullest screen character to date. Hers was a performance of such quirky richness it exploded in the popular consciousness, even as Annie’s eccentric fashion sense propelled for a time an American mania for mismatched schmattes.\n\nMy middle class prejudices may have been massaged, but to my relief I enjoyed seeing Annie Hall nearly as much in 2023 as I did in 1977.\n\nTargets (1968) The late Peter Boganovich’s first complete movie as a screenwriter/director, one of the most remarkably assured debuts in American movie history. Watching it in the new Criterion restoration I was struck anew by how smoothly Bogdanovich (and his uncredited co-scenarist, Samuel Fuller) moves from his and his then-wife Polly Platt’s Charles Whitman-derived sniper story to the parallel plot involving Boris Karloff as, essentially, himself, and back again. The fluidity of storytelling is as remarkable as the long sequences achieved without a cut and the shockingly casual manner by which a deceptively mild-mannered young man disposes of his family and various assorted strangers.\n\nThe Golden Age of Comedy (1957) The first of Robert Youngson’s silent comedy compilations, and allegedly the first of its type by anyone. Drawing from the Mack Sennett and Hal Roach output, Youngson highlights the work of Laurel and Hardy, Will Rogers, Ben Turpin, Carole Lombard, Billy Bevan, and Cameo the Wonder Dog beating Ben Turpin at checkers. Boy, did I ever need those laughs — and boy, did Youngson deliver! The Rogers excerpts didn’t do much for me, and I’ve never quite understood the alleged appeal of that overgrown infant Harry Langdon. But the Laurel & Hardy clips are a riot, especially the epic pie fight from Battle of the Century, the long sequence of tit-for-tat (are we allowed to say that now?) with automobiles from Two Tars and the climax of You’re Darn Tootin’ in which Stan gets a crowd of men on the street kicking each other in the shins and angrily tearing off each other’s trousers. I nearly hurt myself laughing.\n\nAnna and the King of Siam (1946) The first film adaptation of the Margaret Landon novel, based on the somewhat dubious memoirs of Anna Leonowens, from a screenplay by Talbot Jennings and Sally Benson. Irene Dunne is Anna and the then little-known (at least in America) Rex Harrison is King Mongkut. Since Harrison always had a slight Mandarin cast to his eyes, his appearance in the picture isn’t as far a stretch as might be imagined, and he fully captures Landon’s Mongkut in all his tics and mercurial moods. The true figure of the King is a very different story, and the Thais are understandably sensitive about it. Neither this picture nor the eventual The King and I goes more than skin-deep into politics, but Mongkut was, quite rightly, very much aware that Siam was threatened by, on one side, the French and, on the other, by British imperial designs, and that how he governed was carefully watched by both, each eagerly seeking the slightest pretext to invade his land and depose him.\n\nLee J. Cobb cuts an impressive figure as the Kralahome, Gale Sondergaard is a sensitive Lady Thiang and Linda Darnell is rather good as Tuptim, whose story here differs vastly (and horribly) from the version we know best, in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Bernard Herrmann contributed one of his fascinating ethnic scores, Arthur Miller shot the picture with his usual intelligent eye for black-and-white beauty and the movie as a whole was directed well if not exceptionally by John Cromwell. Oddly, the moment I most remembered from seeing this on television as a boy was the death of Anna’s young son, a thing that never happened and which seems to have been dragged into the narrative to jerk a few tears and make Anna even more lonely and isolated than she was in life.\n\nThe King and I (1956) One of those rather perfunctory 1950s Hollywood adaptations of a Broadway musical success, and, like 20th Century-Fox’s contemporary films of Carousel and South Pacific, particularly dispiriting because it is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s four finest shows. Their first, and the first to reach the screen, was the splendid Oklahoma! of the year before, personally produced by R&H and showing everywhere the evidence of their care for its quality. Realizing they would have to spend considerable portions of their lives overseeing these pictures, the pair quite sensibly gave up on movies and returned to Broadway, but we are the poorer for their having done so. The King and I isn’t bad, and it preserves Yul Brynner’s performance as the King, which alone would justify its existence. But it’s almost entirely set-bound, and “not bad” is hardly good enough for a show this rich in music, lyrics, character, incident and narrative.\n\nMost of the great score made it to the screen, but the 1951 show’s best number, Anna’s soliloquy “Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?” although filmed, was later cut, and lost. That most of Anna’s singing is done, not by Deborah Kerr, who plays her, but that least chameleon-like of vocal ghosts, the ubiquitous Marni Nixon, is a rather large mark against the picture anyway, but the loss of that number is particularly egregious. Not only is it, with the “Soliloquy” from Carousel, one of Hammerstein’s two finest lyrics, but it gives Anna the aria she needs in the second act. Without it, she’s a little bit lost. Kerr, if you love her as I do, makes a splendid Anna, warm, intelligent and passionate in equal measure, and Brynner, shirt strategically open to reveal his chiseled chest, is funny, sexy, sharp, imperious, sly and in many ways magnificent.\n\nDays of Thrills and Laughter (1961) The third Robert Youngson anthology of silent comedy clips has the most impressive musical score of the series I’ve heard so far (by Jack Shaindlin, with apt and often witty arrangements by the splendid Broadway orchestrator Ted Royal), amusing and informative narration, and in the extended train sequence from the 1927 Play Safe, the damnedest, most jaw-dropping series of comic stunts in any picture that didn’t star Buster Keaton. Placing, as his title indicates, equal emphasis on the comedic and the stirring, Youngson features lengthy bits from Douglas Fairbanks, Harry Houdini and Pearl White along with Snub Pollard, Charley Chase getting thoroughly soaked and many of the choicest bits of physical humor from two of Chaplin’s best Mutuals, The Cure and The Adventurer. But the piece de resistance is the long train climax from Play Safe with the astonishing Monty Banks (né Mario Bianchi), as hilarious as he is hair-raising. I had, until this compilation, never seen Banks before, and he’s a true revelation.* You’d never think to look at his unprepossessing frame what an astonishing athlete he was but in action he almost makes Buster Keaton seem anemic.\n\n*Eliot M. Camarena informs me that, according to Banks’ Wikipedia entry, Kevin Brownlow explained the astounding “car-to-train transfer stunt” in his wonderful 1980 documentary series “Hollywood,” which both of us did see… yet, remarkably, neither of us remembers Monty Banks!\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross"
