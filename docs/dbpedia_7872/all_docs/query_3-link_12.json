        "text": "On Easter Sunday, my mother would have my brother and I watched the epid Hollywoof Film ‘The Ten Commandements’. It is one Chartlon Heston’s (1923-2008) best roles and his agtonist in the film, Yul Brynner (1920-1985), delivers an equally compelling performance a Ramesses II. In fact, it remains the film by which I have always recognized Brynner. However, like most great stars of his era, often called the “Golden Era of Hollywood”, there was more to his life than the public was able to see. His son Rock Brynner decided to turn memories of his childhood into this memoir of the time he spent with his father, one of Hollywood’s leading men.\n\nThe book is an autobiography and biography at the same time. Rock tells the story of his father’s life while giving us insight into his own struggle as he grows up in the public spotlight. Yul Brynner has always remained something of a mystery. He never fully explained his upbringing in interviews but instead chose to spread misinformation and in some cases complete fabrications. The real story of the Brynner name is told here, putting to rest any outlandish rumors that have persisted throughout the years about Yul’s origins. If there was ever an instance of the apple does not fall far from the tree, it is definitely to be found here as the actions of Yul’s grandfather Jules and father Boris serve as a blueprint for the way Yul later lived his own life. Was it heriditary? I do not believe so but it is apparent that within the Brynner family, history continued to repeat itself in ways that will leave some readers speechless.\n\nYul Brynner remains the center of the story all the way throughout the book. His son lets us following along as his father leaves his native Switzterland and emigrates to New York and into a completely new world. From there, he would eventually make it west to Hollywood. The trials and tribulations endured by Brynner are reminiscent of the long paths taken by other stars to finally achieve stardom. He was a tenaciou individual, undaunted by adversity and determined to leave his mark on the film world. The fact that I am writing about him in 2020 shows that he was indeed successful. But what I found to be even more interesting was the fact that when he arrived in America, he spoke almost no English. Incredibly, the films later in his career reveal no trace of this fact.\n\nSimilar to other leading men and women in Hollywood, Yul’s life was filled with indescretions, controversy and financial troubles which hung over him like a dark cloud. The Unites States Government proved to be a formidable enemy, even pushing Yul to make a big move abroad that affected sitautions and events around him for the rest of his life. Rock does not hide anything and reveals the unorthodox world of the place they call Tinsel Town.\n\nRock supplements his dad’s story with his own that begins in a house with a roaming father with an eye for the opposite sex and a mother with an addiction that would later drive a wedge in between husband and wife. Virginia Gilmore’s (1919-1986) role as wife of Yul Brynner and mother of Rock Brynner proved to be no easy task and as we see in the book, it took an enormous toll on her well-being. Sadly, she never remarried after Yul Brynner. By contrast, Yul remarried several times and with each marriage came even more surreal events that would be added to his story. Rock is forced to confront his own demons and as I read the book, I could not help to feel as if he was spiraling out of control but in a way different from his father, whose own demons were catching up with him. And while I would hesitate to label the household as dysfunctional, there were certainly things that would not be accepted today even many homes around the world. But this is life as Rock remembers it: the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nOne aspect of the story that will be of interest to readers is Yul Brynner’s health. His appearance in an anti-smoking commerical after his death had an eerie film to it as nearly everyone by then was aware that Brynner had long since been dead. I found the back story regarding his health to be eye-opening and it also provided insight into the many ways we live our lives even at the expense of longevity. I do believe that if Yul Brynner were live, he would warn many about the perilous behaviour that helped to cause his own demise.\n\nOther celebrities make appearances throughout the book and the anecdotes by Rock Brynner are interesting and reveals small bits of information about some of the greatest stars to ever grace the silver screen. Not all of the storys have happy endings, some are dark such as small sections regarding the late Steve McQueen (1930-1980). Rock finds himself immeresed in this usual but highly seductive lifestlyle that would give rise to his own pitfalls that haunted him for many years. His struggle is equally as poignant as the story of his father’s life. Father and son had a great bond but differences of opinion that later became a source of tension between the two. Regardless, Rock never wavers in support of love of his father and is with him up until Yul’s final moments which are recalled towards the end of the book.\n\nIf you remember Yul Brynner and have always been captivated by his work, then this book is a must read. And even if you are not, there is enough interesting information in the book to hold your attention all the way through. Great read.\n\n“Mr. Brynner is, quite simply, the King. Man and role have long since merged into a fixed image that is as much a part of our Collective Consciousness as the Statue of Liberty.” –Frank Rich, The New York Times\n\nISBN-10: 067169006X\n\nISBN-13: 978-0671690069\n\nMany years have passed since I studied philosophy in college. Names such as Kant and Freud were part of my regularly assigned reading. However, one name I was not particularly exposed to was Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), the late Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who is widely held high regard as a pioneer in the field of psychology. I saw this biography on Amazon and decided to take another look at his life and beliefs. When starting the book I had no judgments about Jung but was sure I would learn a new way of looking at the human mind and what lies behind our thoughts and actions. And while I did find some very interesting concepts put forth by Jung, there is far more to the book than meets the eye.\n\nFirst and foremost, the book is an autobiography and Jung takes center stage. He begins with his childhood in Keswill, Switzerland which is idyllic of life in Europe in the years prior to the outbreak of the First World War. He is soon joined by a younger sister but quickly learns that his family is slightly different from others in terms of status and finances. His parents Paul Achilles Jung (1842–1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848–1923) are common people but from early on, the differences between mother and father become vividly clear. For young Carl, his relationship with each would help shape his future endeavors. His father admonishment to never become a theologian was partly followed mainly due to Jung being somewhat of a rebel as he explains early in his story. His anecdotes about his actions as a kid make it clear early on that his life was destined to be anything but ordinary.\n\nOne thing I did notice is that Jung does not mention many parts of his life with exact details but rather summarizes the main events. In fact, only the major occurrences that are discussed in detail are the death of his father in 1896 and mother in 1922. His wife’s death in 1955 is mentioned in passing during a passage about another topic. Even his children are rarely mentioned. We can only guess as to why they receive such scant attention. Regardless, the story is still highly engaging and Jung has plenty of discuss regarding his thoughts on human psychology, allowing his brilliant mind to be put on full display.\n\nAs the book progresses, Jung begins to travel abroad and his trips across Africa, India, America and the Middle East, result in highly interesting observations from the visitor’s point of view. His ability to place himself in another person’s shoes and objectively examine his European background are food for thought and shows Jung’s evolution into the figure that the world holds in high esteem. He is not without fault however and relates his shortcomings. His relationship with Sigmund Freud is an interesting part of the book and Jung explains why it ran its course and where he felt that Freud has psychology wrong. In the appendix to the book are several letters from Freud to Jung that some readers may find interesting. Letters from Jung to Freud are not included here.\n\nA book about Carl Jung would be incomplete without some discussion of the psyche, the unconscious and God. All three and much is discussed in detail presenting compelling arguments that might challenge your current thoughts on them and how they relate to your own life. Love also finds a place in the discussion and Jung’s opinion of it and how man handles it, provides an insightful and valuable explanation of a topic and liberates, confuses and in some cases destroys. Jung has answers as to why and I believe his reasoning is still valid today, having stood the test of time.\n\nReaders familiar with Jung’s work will find the book easier to follow along than readers who are not. However, one does not need prior knowledge of Jung’s work to follow the story. In fact, I felt that he is very clear in his thoughts and even someone who has no exposure to psychology can quickly pick up the material. His experiences provide a wealth of material into the human psyche and can spark discussions that can last for hours. His gift in this book is a gift that keeps on giving. His thoughts are not the final word but a starting point for future discourse. If you are fan of Carl Gustav Jung and want to know more about the man behind the legend, his memories, dreams and reflections are exactly what you are looking for.\n\nASIN: 0679723951\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) is known primarily from his time in the White House and untimely death but many forget that he was also an accomplished writer. In the well-received “A Nation of Immigrants“, he gives his take on how immigration built the nation known as America. Images of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty will surely come to the minds of readers who decided to read Kennedy’s work. However, there is more to the immigrant story in America and often forgotten are the many other groups who have emigrated to the land of opportunity. Roger Daniels decided to take a further look into the Chinese and Japanese experience in America and what he found may surprise many of us.\n\nThe story begins in 1849 as California becomes ground zero for the gold rush. We learn right away that over 300,000 Chinese came to America to work in mines and in other trades, such as building cross-continental railroads. By 1882, the gold rush was over, the railroads had been nearly completed and hundreds of thousands of Chinese now found themselves out of work. They were far away from China in a new country that did not rush to embrace them. In fact, what happened after the gold rush opened my eyes to the Asian experience in America and revealed many dark parts of American history.\n\nThis book could easily be added as required reading in high school classroom and in a college syllabus. It reads like a textbook but the exception is that is has not been heavily sanitized. Daniels had no intention of sugar coating anything and the facts that are presented here are beyond sobering. Paranoia, suspicion and fear of a “yellow invasion”, gave birth to some of the most discriminatory laws passed in United States history. Beginning with the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1870 and the later Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the anti-Chinese movement gained in momentum and threatened the very existence of Chinese-Americans. Similarly, Japanese immigrants who arrived to America by way of Hawaii, soon found that their new home was not so welcoming. The anti-Chinese movement soon became part of larger anti-Asian sentiment spreading across the United States. And contrary to what we may think about Asian immigration, the Pacific played an even more important role than the Atlantic. Exactly how is explained in detail by Daniels.\n\nAs the world found itself embroiled in two world wars, the Chinese and Japanese in America were struggling simply for recognition as human beings. California remained the battle ground in the struggle between natives and new immigrants from the Far East. San Francisco was the scene of some of the most absurd moments in the book and will cause readers today to wonder at how such inhumane treatment of others was tolerated and endorsed in the late 1800s into the early 1900s. The Alien Land Act of 1913 is a prime example of some of the draconian laws passed to disenfranchise America’s Asian citizens. However, in spite of outright racist treatment and propaganda, the Chinese and Japanese remained firm in their belief of the American dream. World War II became the moment where life for the Japanese in America was turned upside down and would test the patriotism of even the most ardent believers in the United States.\n\nThe book is not a full examination of the Japanese internment in camps during the war. However, Daniels does a thorough job of explaining how the program developed, what President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) knew and the effect it had on the Japanese mindset both during and following the war. High focused is placed on the Japanese American Citizens League, which played an integral role in the affairs of Japanese Americans in many ways, some of which will surprise some. However, its importance cannot be understated. What I did find to be mind-boggling was that the U.S. Military never had a deep suspicion on a whole of Japanese Americans taking up arms in defense of Toyko, but the media and politicians clearly had a different agenda.\n\nToday, the treatment revealed in the book would cause shock and outrage. I have many friends whose families originate throughout Asia. They are as American as I am but the thought of legislation being passed to bar them from citizenship, prevent them from assimilating in society or to prevent them from even entering the country, is beyond horrifying. However, this was the reality for thousands of Chinese and Japanese in the United States before the passage of civil rights bills and Supreme Court decisions that struck down bans of segregation and interracial marriage. America has come a long way but there is still work to be done.\n\nWhile reading Daniel’s words, I could not help but to feel that some of the divisive rhetoric employed by politicians then is also heard now. Fears of “invasion” and “threats to our way of life” permeated beliefs in the 1800s and 1900s, resulting in regrettable treatment of Chinese and Japanese Americans. And in some cases, that rhetoric proved to be deadly. That same danger exist today. If we are to continue to move forward, then we must remember that less than one hundred and fifty years ago, anyone who was not White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, found that life in America was a contradiction to the belief that all men are created equal. If we fail to remember the past, we are doomed to repeat it. I truly hope we do not. Roger Daniels has given us a guide to study and learn from so that we do make the same mistakes. Highly recommended.\n\nISBN-10: 0295970189\n\nISBN-13: 978-0295970189\n\nWhen I saw this book on Amazon, I was a skeptical as to what I found find inside of it. However, the nearly five star reviews convinced me to inspect it a bit further. I took the plunge and ordered it to see exactly what Shelby Steele had to say about race, a topic that continues to either unite or divide people in America. The phrase “content of our character” is known to many of us. It was the pivotal moment of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s (1929-1968) “I Have a Dream” speech on August 28, 1963. Fifty-seven years have passed since that monumental moment in American history and the question remains, do we judge each other on the content of our character? Further, have we progressed as a society or is America still the same place it was when Jim Crow made life miserable for millions of black Americans and others who emigrated to the United States in search of opportunity?\n\nThe book was published in 1991, making it twenty-nine years old. At first, I wondered if the material would have any relevance to current day America. To my surprise and satisfaction, Shelby’s message is still relevant today. He does not place blame on white Americans or absolve them of guilt or responsibility for America’s past sins. Instead, his focus is on black America and the message he conveys is an attempt to introduce a different dialogue about race. Skeptics will be tempted to write him off as someone who has animosity towards his own upbringing. That is not the case and at no point in the book does Steele express any type of regret or dissatisfaction about his own ethnicity. His goal is to show that American has progressed when it comes to race and for black Americans to truly live the American dream, there are things that have to change. First and foremost is the role race plays in all of our lives for better or worse.\n\nAs I read through the book, I could not help but to think of John McWhorten’s “Losing the Race: Self Sabotage in Black America“, which explores some of the same issues as Steele does here. In fact, McWhorten references Steele on several occasions as he discusses the concepts of victimology, separatism and anti-intellectualism. Steeled does focus on each but does not distinctly define them as McWhorten does. His discussion about an identity formed out of being a victim stands out as an observation that warrants much further discussion and is exactly what McWhorten believes in his equally moving book.\n\nBy his own admission, Steel is what would be considered to be middle class. He is successful but not extremely wealthy, a father of children he loves and in what will be a surprise to some, married to a white woman. However, he cannot and does not refute his race and explains the tightrope that black middle class Americans walk on daily. As a black American, I firmly believe that education is key to moving up in life and pursuing values that will help me to assimilate into mainstream America. Yet should I also accept and embody the concept that no matter what I do, I am still regulated to a lower standard of living because my skin is dark? That is the question black Americans will find themselves confronted with while reading this book. Today, there are black CEOs, governors, attorney generals, vice-presidents, movie stars, pilots, etc. Steele believes that black Americans have and continue to advance in society. And while he does not ignore the fact that racism exist, our successes and failures cannot always be attributed to it.\n\nOf course, there is the elephant in the room in the form of affirmative action, a subject that almost always results in heated discussion. Steele does not shy away from the matter and his words are similar to McWhorten’s beliefs as well. The idea behind affirmative action was rooted in the right principles. However, moving forward decades later, does it hurt black people more than it helps? Further, by accepting someone with lower qualifications solely on the basis of their race, do we inadvertently discriminate against others well qualified on the basis of their skin being white? Surely, the question does not have a simple answer but I do believe, as do Steel and McWhorten, that the system of affirmative action needs to be reevaluated to see if in fact, it has really made the change that it was intended to be.\n\nBy no means does Steele provide the final word on the subject of race. As we all know, discrimination still exist. But I do think the material is gold and provides a wealth of food for thought with regards to race and the advancement of black Americans. Former President Barack Obama ran his campaign on a simple slogan, “yes we can”. I believe as does Steele, that black Americans can and will succeed but only after accepting hard truths that can reshape our minds and provide a new vision for long term success. And as we move forward, we shall seek to be judged solely on the content of our character.\n\nISBN-10: 006097415X\n\nISBN-13: 978-0060974152\n\nOn December 25, 1979, the armed forces of the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in support of pro-Communist forces engaged in a power struggle with insurgent forces known as the mujahideen. Soviet forces marched into the capital city of Kabul and later succeeded in staging a coup in which President Hafizullah Amin (1929-1979) was removed and replaced with Soviet loyalist Babrak Karmal (1929-1966). Thousands of Afghan citizens were rendered homeless as bombs fells and brutal fighting produced collateral damage. For Enjeela Ahmadi-Miller, the war changed her life in ways she could have never imagined.\n\nThis moving autobiography is Ahmadi-Miller’s story of life in Afghanistan and her family’s journey across cities and countries in search of a better life far removed from war torn Kabul. As the book begins, we are taken inside her home where she and her seven siblings are being raised by their parents Abdullah and Miriam. Their daily routine is what we would expect of large family and the interactions between siblings is something that anyone with brothers and sisters can easily relate to. Her parents care deeply for each other but Abdullah, whom Enjeela affectionately calls Padar, has a vice that eventually fractures their marriage. Though they are able to move past it, changes in the Afghan government coupled with a crackdown on opposition voices, results in Miriam making the decision to leave the country with half of their children, leaving Padar and the rest behind. He is determined never to leave Afghanistan and is certain they can ride out the war. However, the reality of the conflict begins to hit home as he finds himself suspected by the Soviets of secretly working for the United States. Time begins to run out and Padar decides that they will join their mother who has settled in India. He sends his children on their journey with a trusted friend, Masood, and promises to join them in neighboring Pakistan. Masood is a loyal and dedicated friend who serves as their guardian as they traverse across mountains, valleys and small villages across Afghanistan and Pakistan. Enjeela and her siblings soon experience the realities of the world that have a profound effect on all them.\n\nAs they move through Afghanistan and later Pakistan, they encounter many dark realities of life that children in the west are never exposed to. Soviet fighters had engulfed the city and their presence alone is enough to cause fear and consternation among the local populace. Enjeela has plenty to tell us and her memories of the migration between the two countries are filled with anecdotes that reveal the brutal reality that is life in remote locations. Nomads, rebels, shepherds and bandits roam freely resulting in Masood keeping a watchful eye over his group. Mina enters the story and young Enjeela soon makes a new friend. But over time, Mina’s life at home reveals a dark side of Afghanistan that Enjeela was unaware of. She is slowly growing up on this trip but in ways she could never have imagined. Their bond as siblings and support for each other are tested time and again as they are forced to use critical thought in situations that could have easily gone the wrong way.\n\nPakistan proves to be a refuge for the group of siblings who eventually realize that they are in fact refugees. But they have many guardian angels along the way and their roles in the story were unexpected but definitely welcomed. Those moments add a touch of humanity to a story filled with adversity. Padar eventually reenters the story and the Ahmadi family that has survived thus far, is determined to make it to India. The next leg of their journey to what they believe is their final destination, is by far the most dangerous and the escapades that ensue are what we would describe as “close calls”. Padar remains the voice of reason and their source of eternal faith. Throughout the book he is anchor upon which everyone relies for support and reassurance. His strengths and flaws are on display but it is clear that Enjeela truly loves him and the two have a special bond. After a series of mishaps, Padar and the four siblings finally reach India where a sense of normalcy sets in again. However, their mother Miriam has her own struggle and needs the support of her family at this time more than ever. Her plight and the family’s status in India, forces her and Padar to make another life altering decision that will take the family across several continents to place none of them ever thought they would live in.\n\nThis book came as a recommendation on Amazon and at first glance, the cover caught my attention. I have always been fascinated about the Middle East, a region which many westerners still struggle to understand. Enjeela’s story shows a side of Islam that is often omitted and her observations about what true Islam is and how we should treat each other, are insightful and thought provoking. My only complaint is that I wish the book had continued for a few more chapters to see how life changed for the Ahmadi family after their final move. Perhaps that part is not as important or possibly boilerplate in development. Regardless, this story of her early years in the Middle East and the struggle to survive and emigrate is enough to inspire anyone that decides to read this story. And her account goes to show that broken circles can be repaired.\n\nASIN: B07DK7FBDS\n\nIn November, 2019, I had the opportunity to read “The War Outside My Window: The Civil War Diary of LeRoy Wiley Gresham 1860-1865” by author Janet E. Croon. The book is a collection of the diary entries made by LeRoy Wiley Gresham (1847-1868) during the American Civil War. He lived in Macon, Georgia and was born into a slave-owning family committed to the Confederacy. Before reading the book I had no idea who Gresham was. But what I found after reading his diary, is that he was a bright young man whose intellect improves as the journal progresses. However, I also noticed that throughout the book he is in poor health that does not improve but instead declines as the diary moves towards 1863 and beyond. LeRoy did not know he was dying until nearly right before his passing. His parents and older sibling Thomas, most likely knew how severe his condition was but kept it hidden from him probably with the thought that telling him would break the will he had left following the devastating injury in 1856 that resulted in his left leg being crushed by a falling chimney. We know that tuberculosis is what eventually took his life but at the time, there was much about his condition that doctors did not know and were unable to treat. Dennis A. Rasbach, M.D., F.A.C.S., has taken a look at LeRoy’s medical history to understand how his condition progressed and the various treatments prescribed to him by his treating physicians.\n\nDr. Rasbach has concluded that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is what ultimately took Leroy’s life. It is formally known as Pott’s Disease, name after the late English surgeon Percival Pott (1714-1788). Today, tuberculosis is rarely heard of and a diagnosis y would raise eyebrows and result in reactions of shock and surprise. But during the time in which LeRoy lived, tuberculosis was the world’s deadliest killer and a diagnosis such as the one received by LeRoy, almost always resulted in death. Dr. Rasbach elaborates further with the following statement:\n\n“In the second half of the nineteenth century, tuberculosis was the deadliest disease in the world, accounting for one-third of all deaths. Even today, a quarter of the world’s population is infected with TB, and the disease remains one of the top ten causes of death, claiming 1.7 million lives annually, mostly in poor and underdeveloped countries.”\n\nThroughout the diary, LeRoy utilizes a number of medications and remedies to combat his deteriorating condition. Each are examined in detail to see why doctors resorted to those specific remedies and how they affected his daily condition. Readers might express surprise at some of the things LeRoy was given to take, most notably significant servings of alcohol. Today, we would not even think of giving a teenage alcohol to treat a condition but in the 1800s, it was a widely accepted method of treatment. Incredibly, some of the things LeRoy used are still used today. Dr. Rasbach mentions where and some readers might be surprised to see exactly where.\n\nThe second half of the book is a collection of journal entries related mainly to his health which he notes is declining rapidly. The descriptions are graphic and I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for those around him to tend to him daily. He often complains of his back, headaches, upset stomach and contracted legs making it impossible for him to even think of walking. The pain is so bad that in one entry, he writes “saw off my leg”. This young man lived in daily pain and sadly, his doctors and family were powerless to help as the medicines we have today did not exist at the time. For LeRoy, it was a slow and agonizing death. But he gave us plenty of clues about his health and in hindsight, Dr. Rasbach has connected all of the dots, revealing the culprit behind LeRoy’s death at just eighteen years of age.\n\nIf you have read LeRoy’s journal and want to know more about the health condition that plagued him throughout the book, this is a must read. And even if you have not read it but want to know more about the deadly history of tuberculosis, this book will be a valuable addition to any library.\n\nASIN: B07D7G7RJ8\n\nThe looming exit from the European Union by England will undoubtedly be watched by the whole world, which has been kept in suspense by the referendum in 2016 and failure of former British Prime Minster Theresa May to garner enough votes for a formal separation. Current Prime Minister Boris Johnson has declared it will happen and on January 31, 2020, he will be proven right or wrong on the matter. In Northern Ireland, there is fear and uncertainty regarding how the move by England will affect Ulster County, the loyalist stronghold composed of majority that stands firmly behind the Crown. The Irish Republican Army (“IRA”) will be following as well to see how the move will affect its goal for a united Ireland free of British interference. Time will tell how the departure from the European Union will affect both Britain and other nations. Recently, I decided to do some further reading on Northern Ireland and I came across this book by Tim Pat Coogan about an Irish revolutionary I was previously unfamiliar with. His name was Michael Collins (1890-1922) and this is the story of his group of assassins known as the Twelve Apostles and their fight for freedom from Downing Street by famed author Tim Pat Coogan.\n\nI believe that readers will find this book enjoyable if they have a sound base of knowledge regarding the conflict in Northern Ireland. In fact, the author Tim Pat Coogan, has written extensively about the “Troubles”, and in his book “1916: The Easter Rising“, he explains the movements of the IRA and the seizure of the General Post Office and other critical facilities in Dublin. That uprising is considered by many to be the defining moment in the Republican goal of a united Ireland and liberation from British rule. The execution of IRA members in the wake of the uprising turned them into the martyrs and set the stage for the decades running battle between Loyalist and Republican forces.\n\nCollins is the focus here and the author wastes no time in getting into the story. From the beginning it is clear that Collins is man with strong convictions and had no repulsion to using violence as a tool of effecting change. He was a complex character but firmly committed to the expulsion of the Crown. I warn readers that this book does not have a happy ending. In fact, the story is gritty and acts of violence occur throughout. But I do believe that if you choose to read this book, that is something you already know and have accepted. Collins and his group that are known as the Twelve Apostles carry out acts of aggression that will shock many readers. The events in the book take place between the years 1916 and 1922 and their savagery rival violence seen even today. As for Collins, Coogan remarks in the introduction that:\n\n” The Jewish leader Yitzhak Shamir both studied the methods of Michael Collins, and used the code name Michael as his own nom de guerre. And in the state of Israel which Shamir helped to form, I was made aware of a guilty foreboding on the part of those Israeli citizens who knew their history, that one day the Arabs too might produce a Michael Collins – and that if they did, there would not be a supermarket left standing in Israel“.\n\nI completely agree and shudder to think of how the Gaza strip would be today if a Collins type figure had in fact existed and acted on behalf of the Palestinians.\n\nIn America, the murder of a policeman or elected official spurs outrage and swift action by law enforcement. Nearly every criminal will tell you that no one wants to be charged with murdering a cop. But for Collins and the Apostles, everyone was fair game. No one escapes the wrath of the IRA and its band of enforcers are eerily similar to the mafia’s own Murder, Inc., based out of Brooklyn, New York. The Apostles have a hit list and they go through it with deadly precision as part of their mission to obtain Ireland’s freedom. Coogan tells the stories in all of their detail and at times, it felt as is a movie was being filmed. The assassinations and attacks are brazen and deadly, with an increasing body count that will cause some readers to sit in disbelief.\n\nIn December, 1921, the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, resulting in the creation of the Irish Free State, which was composed of 26 out of 32 counties in Ireland. The remaining six in Northern Ireland chose to leave and remain in firm support of England. Collins became head of the Irish Free State and held the position until his own death in 1922. The treaty was rejected by hardliners within the IRA and tensions led to the Irish Civil War of 1922, in which the IRA split into factions. Collins now found himself at odds with those he had once stood next to in the fight for Ireland’s freedom including Éamon de Valera (1882-1975) who leaves and then re-enters the story at pivotal moments. De Valera late formed Fianna Fáil in 1926 after separating from the anti-treaty Sinn Féin party. Incredibly, he lived until the age of 92, when he died from complications of pneumonia and heart failure on August 19, 1975.\n\nIf you want to know more about the uprising in 1916 and the residual effects in the years that followed, this book is a must read. However, it ends after Collins’ death, which comes after the Apostles have parted ways in the wake of the Irish Civil War. Readers looking for a longer account of the conflict will be satisfied with Kevin Toolis’ “Rebel Hearts: Journeys Within the IRA’s Soul” and Peter Taylor’s “Provos: The IRA and Sinn Fein“. Both are highly informative and give excellent explanations about why the IRA continues to fight. And for a more personal story, I highly recommend Dennis O’ Hearn’s “Nothing But an Unfinished Song: The Life and Times of Bobby Sands“, which is the definitive biography of the iconic IRA figure. Tim Pat Coogan has done it again with an excellent account of the activities of Michael Collins and the origins of the long running feud known as The “Troubles”.\n\nASIN: B073YFPTRR\n\nIn the state of South Dakota, the Pine Ridge Reservation is home to the descendants of the Oglala Sioux Native American tribe. The children of Pine Ridge aspire to enroll in the Red Cloud High School with hopes of attending college. Many of their parent, suffer from alcoholism, a plague that has followed the Oglala Sioux since their first encounter with white settlers in the early 1800s. Poverty and discrimination have resulted in depression and despair which has yet to be fully addressed. The true story of the Native American experience remains misunderstood and in some cases neglected. They current day Oglala are the descendants of indigenous people whose home was a North American continent in which life was simple yet effective with languages largely unwritten and passed down through oral teaching. The Sioux were only one of hundreds of tribes, some of whom are now extinct such as the Canarsie Indians. Chief Luther Standing Bear (1868-1939) was born in Rosebud, South Dakota into the Oglala Sioux tribe and this is his story of his life and his people.\n\nI found this enjoyable autobiography on Amazon while browsing through recommendations. I have always been curious about Native American history and the title quickly caught my attention. This story begins in Rosebud, South Dakota during Standing Bear’s childhood. Life is simple for the Sioux and he takes us through the motions, explaining daily life and the many customs practiced by their tribe. There is a good amount of information about the Sioux and their approach to life. Readers today may find some things strange but it is imperative to remember that this was a community that had no exposure at that time, to modern technology.\n\nLife for the Sioux changes as the United States Government increases its policy of expansionism and begins to seize land home to native tribes. The new settlers introduce the Sioux to new foods and customs, and his descriptions about them are eye-opening and highlight the stark difference in culture between the two groups. But over time, the two groups become more acquainted with each other and the white settlers become determined to give the Sioux a formal education. Standing Bear enrolls the Carlisle Indian School under the direction of Captain Pratt who becomes one of the most important figures in his life as we read the book. And it is at this point, that his life is never the same and his path of education would take him places he never imagined. He adopted the English first name of Luther and it remained with him for the rest of his life.\n\nAs Standing Bear increases his knowledge and his expertise of the English language, he is accepted to work in a store owned by former United States Postmaster General John Wanamaker (1838-1922) which changes his view of the world and he soon realize that he must do what is possible to help his people the Sioux. He makes the tough decision to return to his home, with the intention of using his education and teaching skills to improve life for the Sioux. But the story soon take takes yet another turn as he meets and marries Nellie De Cory with whom he would father several children. And it is not long before opportunity comes knocking again and soon husband, wife and child are off to London as part of the traveling Buffalo Bill Show. He recalls life in England and how he and fellow tribesmen adjusted to show business on the road in a foreign country. Throughout all, he is the undisputed leader who lives an exemplary lifestyle founded on principle. His heritage as a Sioux is of the utmost importance and the words of his father are never far from his mind throughout the book.\n\nUpon his return to the United States, his life takes a series of turns, and his next destination was California, headquarters for the motion picture industry. He finds work in Hollywood for a short time as an actor but quickly realizes that no one understands how to accurately portray Indians on screen. The non-existent presence of authentic Indians in motion pictures is not lost on him and he informs us at the book’s closing that he is planning on opening an Indian Employment Agency to help other Native Americans find work. However, his ultimate goal was to help other Indians make the transition from the plains to the white man’s world. Their world is foreign to us but Standing Bear knows this and his purpose here is to help you understand and appreciate the Sioux. On February 20, 1939, Standing Bear died from complications of the flue while filming ‘Union Pacific’ directed by Cecil B. DeMille (1881-1959). He was seventy-years old and had lived an extraordinary life as described within the pages of this book.\n\nASIN: B074TP7THN\n\nOn September 22, 1980, the Iraqi military marched into neighboring Iran under the orders of President Saddam Hussein (1937-2006). Tensions between Hussein and Ruhollah Khomeini (1902-1989) had been brewing over control of the Shatt al-Arab river, Iraqi nationalism and Khomeini’s calls for the Ba’ath party to overthrow the Iraqi government. The conflict raged for eight years before a cease-fired was signed in August, 1988. It is estimated that the war resulted in the deaths of nearly 1.5 million Iraqis and Iranians. On both sides, villages were destroyed, leaving thousands homeless and families permanently separated. Children as young as thirteen were conscripted to serve, becoming trained killers before the age of twenty-one. After the cease-fire, prisoners of war remained held in prisons on both sides before they were slowly repatriated. This book is the story of two of those prisoners who survived the war, living to tell their story about the war that changed their lives.\n\nZahed Haftlang was born in the town of Masjed Soleyman in Khuzestan Province, Iran. His relationship with his father, whom we come to know as “Baba”, is not good and serves as the main catalyst for his flight from home. At the age of thirteen, he joined Iran’s Basij paramilitary and for six years he fought in the war before being captured by the Iraqi army. in 1982. By Iraqi protocols, he should have been executed, but his captor showed mercy and transported him back to base for medical treatment. Along the way, he suffers more injuries at the hands of Iraqi soldiers but arrives in stable condition. He was then joined by other captured Iranian soldiers and for the next seventeen years, he remained there as a prisoner of war before being released in 1999.\n\nNajah Aboud was born in Iraq and grew up in the Shula neighborhood in Baghdad. At the age of eighteen, he joined the Iraqi army and was formally discharged in his early twenties. He was called back to serve at the age of twenty-eight when the war broke out. In 1982, he was captured by Iranian forces and and spent seventeen years as a prisoner of war.\n\nThe two stories are interesting and although parallel, they show two different sides of the war. What is clear from the beginning is that neither man wanted the conflict but rather a normal life that would include a career, marriage and children. Their goals are simple and under normal circumstances achievable. In fact, Najah had been operating the Bruce Lee Restaurant before the war destroyed his efforts. The arrival of the war changed all of their dreams each one recounts how destruction settled in as the bombs fell and all hell broke loose. It is at this point in the book that the stories change gears and the ugly realities of the war become vividly clear.\n\nWhat I noticed in each account is that on both sides of the war, chaos reigned. Neither goes through any type of basic training but rather are thrown into positions and forced to learn through baptism by fire. Their recollections of battle scenes and the horrors of war are graphic and sobering. Make no mistake, they do not sugar coat this part of the book, it is as real as it gets. Eventually, both are captured and their experiences as prisoners of war are where their accounts diverge, showing a very stark difference in treatment of prisoners of war. For Najah, his time served in Iranian camps is quite mild although mundane. He longs for his fiance Alyaa and son Amjad. But for Zahed, the Iraqi camp is nothing short of a nightmare. The descriptions given by him of his time as a prisoner of war are beyond shocking. Inhumane would be an understatement to describe his treatment at the hands of officials, most notably the antagonist Mira Sahib, whose sadistic behavior is repulsive. By the time Zahed is released, he is a shell of himself and man haunted by the war in which he fought. A shining light comes in the form of Maryam, whose entry into his life influences the decisions he makes as love becomes a very real possibility. Najah continues to carry his own own scars as well without any information of his future wife and son.\n\nThe realization that both Iraq and Iran suffered tremendously during the war hits home and they both realize that moving abroad is the only way to help their families and themselves. In a twist of fate, both end up in search of a new life in North America. Vancouver, Canada is the destination and fate intervenes in ways that no one could have ever imagined for them both. Upon arrival life is tough for both, but various figures enter the story, each to serve a different purpose in their lives. And even after adjusting to life in the U.S., there is still much they must deal with regarding their former lives as soldiers on the front line.\n\nThe ending of the book is beyond moving and puts the finishing touch on two incredible stories. Both express their gratitude to author Meredith May for writing this book and I do too. It truly is an exciting and emotional book to read but crucial in understand the effect of war on all involved.\n\nASIN: B01IA7TLL8\n\nThe African-American experience is a reflection of America’s dark past and its bright future. Jim-Crow, anti-miscegenation laws and other legal conditions, provided roadblocks to the social and economic advancement of black Americans and other minorities. However, over time, individuals once considered minorities have made great strides and achieved great success. In spite of this, black America finds itself confronted with issues that cause many to wonder what is really holding black men, women and children back? When I saw this book on Amazon, I thought to myself that whoever wrote this book is beyond brave and was undoubtedly subject to attacks from all angles by those who wish to refute his conclusions. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the book was written by a black American, John McWhorter, who is a professor in English and comparative literature at Columbia University. He has also worked at the University of California, Berkeley. His experiences while tenuring at UC, Berkeley are what form the backbone of this book.\n\nMcWhorter provides three conditions which are adversarial to the black Americans: Victimology, Separatism and Anti-Intellectualism. He provides compelling arguments for each and I do believe that many black Americans who decided to read this book will find common ground on many of the ideas he presents. There are those who will have a knee-jerk reaction and write off the book as the ravings of a deranged self-hating crackpot. But to do so would unfortunately result in the point McWhorter being proved.\n\nVictimology is presented as the idea that black Americans are eternal victims resulting from the brutal system of discrimination in America. But as McWhorter explains, the America that existed in 1960 and prior, is different from the America today. Furthermore, the victim role can be a curse in disguise. Its permeation into “woke” discussions and the rhetoric of numerous public figures, has created a cycle of which the very people inside are sometimes unaware of. McWhorter hopes to end that cycle and discusses why the idea of the eternal victim does nothing to help black Americans. Sure, there are true victims among us, typically older black men and women born well before 1965. The younger generation finds itself at an advantage that older generations could only dream of.\n\nSeparatism touches of the idea of a separate black existence, culture and consciousness. But in the era of integration beyond anything Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) could have imagined at the time, does separatism do more harm than good? And if equality truly is the end goal, does it benefit black Americans to maintain a separate existence based on “blackness”? The author provides an in-depth analysis of the many pitfalls of separatism and why it needs to be abandoned so that black Americans can form the social connections necessary for advancement in society.\n\nAnti-Intellectualism is without a doubt the most controversial part of the book. But McWhorter does not shy away from it and confronts the subject head on. His idea is frank and addresses the ingrained aversion to higher learning, which comes in the form of books, literature and other things considered to be for white people. I have no doubt that some readers will either cringe or be filled with anger at McWhorter’s words, calling him a sell-out and possibly other unprintable names. But if we pay close attention, he does not lay blame at the feet of black America for its anti-intellectual culture. He readily acknowledges that the creation of the culture is the result of legal and condoned oppression and discrimination. The goal is to fix what was inherited and remove the obstacles that impede success for black Americans.\n\nAs always, there are exceptions to every situation. Here is no different and there are thousands if not millions of black Americans who do exceedingly well in education and in life. And many of them love books and intellectualism. McWhorter is fully aware of this and states such. But unfortunately, they are often in the minority. And that is the trend which must be reversed. Only then, can black America as a group, claim to be fully integrated in American society. While addressing the education issue, McWhorter touches on affirmative action, one of the most debated practices in American academia. It was implemented with the best intentions, to help correct what had been going wrong for so many years. But more than 40 years later, is it still needed? This book was published in 2001, but even today, questions remain about the effectiveness and contribution to true equality of affirmative action. McWhorter’s confessions about his own advancement might surprise some readers.\n\nIn McWhorter’s defense, he does not ignore that racism still exist. The cover of the book may convey the notion that black America is its own worst enemy but I can assure you that is not the case. To highlight his full awareness that racism does play a role in our lives, he recalls random acts of discrimination he faced during his youth. The point of his book is not to absolve white Americans of all guilt but instead to call attention to where black America has to work a little harder. He is not shaming black America or putting it down. His mission is to reverse trends that hold back rather than promote intellectualism and achievement for millions of black men and women. His words are tough and some truths are uncomfortable but I truly believe that if the message in the book is to be accepted and understood, there will be a brighter future in which black America can win the race.\n\nISBN-10: 0060935936\n\nISBN-13: 978-0060935931"
