        "text": "Long before she was America’s glamorous first lady, Nancy Reagan was simply Anne Frances Robbins from Flushing.\n\nThe daughter of stage actress Edith Luckett and car salesman Kenneth Seymour Robbins, Reagan was born July 6, 1921, and lived her early days at 417 Amity St. — now 149-40 Roosevelt Ave. — in what’s currently a heavily immigrant block of Queens.\n\nHer parents divorced, and she moved to Chicago with her mother, who got remarried to neurosurgeon Dr. Loyal Davis. The doctor adopted Nancy.\n\nNot long after Nancy Davis graduated from Smith College in Massachusetts, she returned to the Big Apple as a young aspiring actress. She scored her first big acting break, cast in Broadway’s “Lute Song” in 1946.\n\nThe production was headlined by Yul Brynner while Davis played the role of lady-in-waiting Si-Tchun. The musical was staged at the Plymouth Theatre, now the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on 45th Street.\n\nNancy Reagan was a frequent visitor to New York City during the Reagan White House, including a famous moment with her hubby, President-elect George H.W. Bush met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe meeting led to an iconic picture of the three men, with Lady Liberty in the background, signaling the end of the Cold War.\n\nIn various other trips to New York, she greeted Prince Charles, made public statements against drug abuse and supported various art institutions.\n\nIn 1988, Nancy Reagan addressed the UN General Assembly and blamed addicts in the United States — more than narcotics producers overseas — for that era’s drug epidemic.\n\nThe simple wood-frame Flushing house where Nancy Reagan spent her early childhood is now deserted and in disrepair.\n\nJose Guevara, a 69-year-old carpenter who lives next door to the property, said Sunday he’s grateful to the Reagans because he got his green card during the 40th president’s term.\n\nEveryone in the neighborhood knows the house that Nancy Reagan once called home.\n\n“Some people ask me, ‘Where do you live?’ and I say, `Queens,’ ” Guevara said, “I tell them next door to where a first lady lived.”\n\nNew Yorkers who knew Nancy Reagan opened their hearts on Sunday to mourn her passing:\n\n“She was an elegant woman. She was a great first lady and she served the nation very well. We can have political differences but there is no doubt that she was a great first lady and she will be missed,” Gov. Cuomo said.\n\nMayor de Blasio added, “New Yorkers are deeply saddened by the passing of First Lady Nancy Reagan, a warm and intelligent woman who loved this country and President Reagan with compassion and grace. She is missed throughout the five boroughs today, particularly in Flushing, Queens where she was born.”\n\nAccording to US Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), “You didn’t have to be a Reagan Republican to admire and respect Nancy Reagan. She was a tower of strength alongside her husband, had strong beliefs, and was not afraid to chart her own course politically. She persuaded her husband to support the Brady Law, and their advocacy was instrumental in helping us pass it.”\n\nAnd Ed Cox, state GOP chairman and son-in-law of former President Richard Nixon, said: “Nancy Reagan will go down as the one of the most influential First Ladies in the US because of the love between her and Ron.”\n\nFormer Mayor Mike Bloomberg added, “I had the good fortune to know Nancy as a friend. The first time we met, before I ran for mayor of New York, I had the honor of sitting next to her at a dinner. When I confessed to her that I was a Democrat, she replied, `Oh, that’s okay. Ronnie started as a Democrat, too. There’s still hope for you.’ When I saw her several years later, after I had won election on the Republican line, she had a glimmer in her eye as she reminded me of this story. She also reminded me that, as someone who spent her earliest years in Queens, she had a special place in her heart for New York City.”\n\nFormer Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who served in Reagan’s Justice Department, said, “Nancy Reagan was a full partner in all the historical achievements of her husband President Ronald Reagan’s career. She was his most important confidante, advisor, friend and the love of his life. Judith and I extend our condolences and prayers to the Reagan family and to the extended family, all of us who loved them so much.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Carl Campanile"
