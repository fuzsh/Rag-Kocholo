        "text": "The first time was special, one summer's evening a long time ago in a chilly seaside resort on the east coast of Scotland. I'll never forget those moments of sheer physical pleasure. Seeing The Magnificent Seven was a seminal experience for my generation - like first sex, but more fondly remembered now. And for me more important.\n\nI'm not sure if it was the first film I ever saw in the cinema, but it is the first I remember seeing. Its images, dialogue and music seared themselves in my memory - Yul Brynner dressed in black, Steve McQueen riding shotgun on the hearse, and James Coburn unwinding himself from his slumbers to accommodate the foolish gunman who thinks he can draw quicker than Coburn can throw his knife. He was wrong.\n\nThe Playhouse in North Berwick is long gone. But The Magnificent Seven is very much alive, 40 years after it first appeared. It changed the nature of the western, but its influence went way beyond the genre. Without it, there would have been no Bug's Life, which relocated the story in the insect world, and no Westworld, in which tourists were terrorised by Brynner as an out-of-control robot version of his Magnificent Seven character.\n\nJames Coburn a tall, slim, silver-haired figure in black jeans and blue jumper extends a hand twisted by the arthritis that took 10 years out of his career, and left him unable to walk for 18 months at the start of the 90s, before he managed to alleviate it with dietary sulphur. But his blue eyes sparkle as brightly as ever.\n\n\"Forty years,\" he says, in that deep, laconic tone that rumbled across a string of great films in the 60s and 70s, including The Great Escape, Charade and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. He went on making westerns even after the genre's death notice had been published and in the 90s, he was in Young Guns II and Maverick. He survived Hudson Hawk as well as debilitating illness and finally won an Oscar last year for his performance as Nick Nolte's embittered father in Paul Schrader's little-seen drama Affliction.\n\nHe can work again now, but admits he is very choosy. The Magnificent Seven is an awesome yardstick. \"Is it really 40 years?,\" he wonders as we settle into a booth in Hollywood's Polo Lounge, where multimillion dollar film deals are a part of the routine. It is Coburn's local and a small army of attendants dance attendance.\n\nCoburn is now 71. He got the part in The Magnificent Seven, after a chance meeting with Robert Vaughn. Coburn had been a huge fan of Seven Samurai, the 1954 Japanese film on which The Magnificent Seven was based. He was studying with Stella Adler and working in television in New York when he saw Akira Kurosawa's film. \"I hadn't seen a film like that, ever,\" he says \"To see all these characters... the big fight in the rain and the mud... He just blew me away.\" Coburn saw it 15 times.\n\nHe remembers reading in the trades that Brynner and Anthony Quinn had acquired the rights to remake it as a western in which a bunch of poor Mexican villagers hire seven gunmen from north of the border to protect them from bandits. He was under the impression that the pact had fallen apart and the project was abandoned, until he met Vaughn in the street one day.\n\n\"I said 'Hi, man, what are you doing?' And he said 'I'm going to do The Magnificent Seven.' And, like, my heart just fell.\" Shooting was only weeks away and Coburn feared all the parts would be cast. And they were, more or less. Coburn had recently made his film debut as a bounty hunter in Budd Boetticher's western Ride Lonesome and seemed a more natural candidate for the film than Vaughn, whom he had met on the drama course at LA City College.\n\nCoburn was born in Nebraska, but his father moved the family to LA during the Depression in pursuit of work. Vaughn came from a very different background. \"He had come up from Minnesota, very erudite, carrying everything in a briefcase. He looked like he was a golf pro... red pants, checkered shirt.\"\n\nVaughn was to play Lee, the southern gent who has lost his nerve. Brynner, McQueen, Charles Bronson, Horst Buchholz and Brad Dexter were also in place. The role of Britt, the most skilled knifeman and gunman of them all, was written as an older man and was destined for either Sterling Hayden, the rangy star of The Asphalt Jungle and Johnny Guitar, or John Ireland, whose western credits included Red River and Gunfight at the OK Corral.\n\nCoburn says they were quibbling over money and he managed to set up a meeting with director John Sturges just in case. \"This was on a Friday afternoon and it had to be cast by Saturday night because an actors' strike was going to take place then. Any film that wasn't cast by Saturday midnight, you couldn't do it... He said 'Well,' [Coburn adopts a high, screechy whine of a voice] 'we'll let you know by three o'clock.' And duly I get a call saying 'Well, run over and pick up your knives'... It was a real thrilling gig to get that, because it was a role that I always coveted.\"\n\nIt took him no time to learn the rudiments of knives. \"I learned how to throw them one afternoon,\" he says, \"and just practised from then on.\" A laugh issues from deep in some subterranean cavern. There were stories of friction from the Mexican location, with one newspaper reporting a feud between the icy Yul Brynner, who had recently won a best-actor Oscar for The King and I, and the volatile Steve McQueen.\n\nMcQueen had grown up on a farm and was at home with guns and horses, whereas Brynner was a Russian emigrant who felt more comfortable discussing philosophy in sophisticated nightclubs. Legend has it that for one scene Brynner chose to stand on a mound of earth, which McQueen tried to kick away during the take. Coburn plays down the animosity, but admits there were some ground rules, as far as Brynner was concerned. \"He was the king. Heh-heh-heh... When he would march on to the set, nobody could come within 12 feet of him.\"\n\nCoburn got on well with McQueen, though he acknowledges he had a fiercely competitive streak. \"He was a giant egoist,\" says Coburn, who had worked with him on the TV western series Wanted: Dead or Alive and made several other films with him. \"We were shooting Hell is For Heroes and he said 'Why don't they just make a film about one guy - me?' \"\n\nCoburn became a major Hollywood leading man in the role of Our Man Flint, which briefly rivalled James Bond in the 60s, and he became the very epitome of cool (Austin Powers watches the sequel, In Like Flint, in his sequel). Vaughn went on to become co-star of TV's The Man from UNCLE, a 60s sensation. And Bronson made the unlikely transition from heavy to superstar-hero thanks to Michael Winner and the Death Wish films.\n\nNo other western managed to assemble so many actors destined to become stars. \"Well, eh,\" says Coburn, \"what's his name, the guy that nobody can remember, didn't.\" He means stock heavy Brad Dexter. \"He got the part because of Frank Sinatra. He saved Frank Sinatra's life out in Hawaii islands... swimming. A big wave took him out and Brad went out and got him... John Sturges had worked with Frank Sinatra, so Frank asked John to give Brad a part.\"\n\nCoburn had reservations about the German actor, Horst Buchholz, as the young Mexican who fancies himself as a gunslinger. \"John was enamoured though... He shot a lot of film of Horst. I thought he missed there, but that was the one place. I think everybody else was cast quite well.\" McQueen's manager, Hilly Elkins, subsequently became Coburn's manager too. \"I met Hilly on The Magnificent Seven, because Steve always had problems. He creates problems, so he had Hilly come down and solve these problems. Of course they were just imaginary, heh-heh. That was one of Steve's great things: he would create a situation and call somebody else in to solve it... something to do with the script probably.\"\n\nCoburn and McQueen shared many similar interests and became close friends. \"We would always hang out together, smoke grass, get high and go up the mountains and drive fast cars.\"\n\nOne of the biggest problems on The Magnificent Seven was the Mexican official who insisted the Mexican peasants' outfits must always be pristine white. \"They didn't want Mexicans to look like they had dirt,\" says Coburn, which explains why they look as if they have just stepped out of a Persil commercial.\n\nIt was a great script. In the Guardian's Cinefile column, Colin Bateman, author of Divorcing Jack, cited \"We deal in lead\" as his all-time favourite piece of movie dialogue. Mine is Brynner's closing speech: \"The old man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost. We always lose.\" Then Brynner and McQueen ride off into the sunset. And Buchholz, the only other survivor, unfastens his gunbelt and joins the women in the cornfield. Is there a more powerful, scene in cinema?\n\nClint Eastwood gets the credit for pioneering the taciturn western hero, but Coburn has only four words in that unforgettable, four-minute introductory scene in The Magnificent Seven, where he is challenged to a duel, knife against gun, first for sport - \"You lost\", and then for real - \"Call it\".\n\nThe other guy did all the talking, but the audience is focused on Coburn. Sturges was a former film editor who knew exactly what he wanted and storyboarded every scene. Sturges also directed The Great Escape, which reunited Coburn, McQueen and Bronson, Ice Station Zebra, Gunfight at the OK Corral, Bad Day at Black Rock, and Last Train From Gun Hill, a neglected western masterpiece.\n\nAnd yet, as Coburn puts it, \"you've never heard of a John Sturges film\". But why should Sturges's name remain so obscure when Ford, Leone and Peckinpah are lionised? \"Peckinpah!\" Coburn worked with him on a string of films and was his Pat Garrett opposite Kris Kristofferson's Billy the Kid. \"Difficult is not the word... Sam created a lot of chaos. He liked chaos. He liked to work with it and keep everybody on edge, where John was just the opposite way round - he liked everything under control. \"He didn't impose a directorial style on any picture. He imposed more of an editorial style, which is getting the shot, telling the story clearly. Sam liked ambiguity. He didn't like it on the nose. If it was on the nose, it was wrong. If it was right, it was wrong in his language. He liked to have the audience work.\"\n\nAnd yet The Magnificent Seven was an ambiguous western. Far removed from High Noon, its heroes were not lawmen but professional gunfighters, ready to die, not for the forward march of civilisation, but for adventure, gold and, maybe, some tenuous notion of honour. \"These guys sacrificed themselves to be who they were, because they didn't have anything else to do,\" says Coburn. \"They were the samurai of the day - the era of the gunfighter was over.\"\n\nWhen I grew up no one was looking for adventurers to ride across the Rio Grande any more. But for me, and for many of my generation, it's not over. In our imaginations, we still saddle up with Brynner, McQueen and Coburn."
