        "meta_description": "Shanghai's Russian connection began as a transhipment point for tea from Russian tea factories in Hankou destined for Russia. The Russian diaspora which had arrived in Shanghai broken and confused left the city with little promise of regaining a sense of cultural pride and national identity, as it dispersed to several countries and locations. The Second World War caused the break-up of the large Russian emigre communities in Europe, such as those in Paris, Warsaw and the Baltic countries, which were absorbed either by Hitler or Stalin. Russian refugees retained their freedom after the Pacific War began, unlike the Americans, British, Belgians and Dutch residents, who were eventually interned in 'civic assembly centres', mostly during February-March 1943. Russians did accept offers of employment in Australia, which recruited the young and able-bodied to participate in the post-war development of its large and underpopulated country.",
