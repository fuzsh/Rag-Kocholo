        "text": "Why “covered expat” (“covered expatriate”) status matters, even if you have no assets! The “Forever Taint”!\n\nThe point of this post is to explain why “covered expatriate” status does matter, even for those with no assets. Most people in the world, probably think the tax expatriation provisions only are for the rich, wealthy and worldwide private jet owners. This is how the press (and members of Congress) typically portray those who renounce U.S. citizenship. The press articles typically cover the likes of Ms. Tina Turner and Mr. Eduardo Saverin, co-founder of Facebook. See,Tina Turner – Famous People Who Renounced U.S. Citizenship.\n\nMost articles focus on the “net worth test” (US$2M) and the “income tax liability test” (“US$125K+/-). See, Revisiting the consequences of becoming a “covered expatriate” for failing to comply with Section 877(a)(2)(C).\n\nUnfortunately, U.S. “expatriation tax law”, applies to the poorest former U.S. citizen (and certain long-term LPRs), wherever they reside if they do not comply with the certification requirements of Section 877(a)(2)(C). See, Accidental Americans” – Rush to Renounce U.S. Citizenship to Avoid the Ugly U.S. Tax Web” International Tax Journal, CCH Wolters Kluwer, Nov./Dec. 2012, Vol. 38 Issue 6, p45.\n\nSo far so clear? But you are surely asking yourself, “this does not explain how this costs me any money or taxes, if I have no assets to begin with . . . “?\n\nIf the certification requirements are not satisfied, the individual with no assets should have no U.S. income tax to pay as he or she will have no unrealized gains. If there are no “unrealized gains”, there can be no tax base and hence no income tax caused by the “mark to market regime”.\n\nHowever, there are two points of potential taxation under the law. First, when the USC or LPR leaves the U.S. (“expatriates”); which does not cause taxation in this example for the individual without “unrealized gains.” However, there is second point of taxation, under the law, which arises when a U.S. person receives a covered gift or bequest. IRC Section 2801. This might not happen until decades into the future, long after the expatriation event.\n\nIncidentally, someone could have significant assets, without any unrealized gains. Both individuals (the rich and the poor) would be in the same position as they leave/expatriate from the U.S.; i.e., and have no U.S. income tax to pay. For instance, USC “A” with US$5,000 in total assets, would have the same income tax to pay ($0) as USC “B” with US$15M of cash in the bank; assuming no other assets. Neither would have unrealized gains upon which to cause any U.S. tax. This is because US dollars/”cash” have a tax basis – the same as the currency amount. Hence, there is no unrealized gains in US dollars-cash.\n\nHowever, if in this case, assume both individuals (USC “A” and USC “B”) cannot satisfy the certification requirements of Section 877(a)(2)(C), and hence both would be “covered expatriates.” So what does that mean to them during their lifetimes (what U.S. tax might they have to pay)?\n\nThe potential U.S. tax created to both USC “A” and USC “B” in this circumstance, is IF AND WHEN, they were ever to make a future gift or bequest (directly or indirectly – e.g., through trust) to a U.S. person. At that point in time, the U.S. beneficiary will have to pay effectively a 40% tax on the fair market value of the property received. This tax is created under Internal Revenue Code Section 2801, that was passed in 2008. See, The “Hidden Tax” of Expatriation – Section 2801 and its “Forever Taint.” A common example is a child or sibling who is a dual national, who might inherit assets in the future.\n\nThe 40% tax is a lot of tax to pay – as there are virtually no deductions or exemptions from the amount of tax paid.\n\nI have proposed a series of recommendations to the Treasury regarding concepts and provisions that hopefully will be incorporated into their propose regulation project under Section 2801. More to come on this important topic.\n\nYou might say – “I have no future U.S. beneficiaries and/or I have no assets. Why do I care?”\n\nVery simply, you should care, if –\n\nYou may grow your future assets (or inherit assets from others) while not being a U.S. citizen (post-expatriation). If that is your goal or your lot in life, you might end up with much more in assets than you have today (assuming you are the same as USC “A” in the example), while having virtually no assets today; and\n\nYou may have family and friends who will become U.S. residents, even if none of them are today.\n\nAssume USC “A” renounces citizenship and in 40 years leaves a bequest to a daughter of US$120,000; the daughter has moved to the U.S. In this case, the U.S. tax law would impose more than a US$40,000 tax on the daughter when she receives the inheritance. This is a very high tax burden to pay, on what is a relatively modest inheritance. This is one, of multiple scenarios of why “covered expatriate” status can be so important – over the long run.\n\nIn my practice, over the years, I have seen numerous cases where one single family member moves to the U.S. temporarily for work or study, e.g., graduate school, gets married and decides to stay on and live in the U.S., even for a while. Often times, they will have children, who will be U.S. citizens by birth in the U.S. Hence, a U.S. person is now part of the family tree.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhy vested Social Security Retirement Benefits are not lost when a USC or LPR sheds their citizenship or immigration status. The Answer to: What happens to social security benefits to former USCs and LPRS including a “covered expatriate”?\n\nThe law of the Social Security Act is a bit obscure for persons who are not (i..e, no longer are) U.S. citizens. It is “obscure” because the law is silent as to former U.S. citizens. For basic background, see, Social Security Retirement Benefits – for former USCs and LPRs (Intersection of U.S. Tax and Social Security Law)\n\nWhile USCs have broad, largely unfettered rights to social security (including when they reside exclusively outside the United States), former USCs and LPRs fall into a different category, specifically including the tax treatment of those benefits.\n\nAlso, the U.S. Congress has imposed limitations, first under the so-called Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and later by the Social Security Protection Act of 2004.\n\nFor the “Accidental American” who has spent virtually all of their lives outside the U.S. (and has never been employed by a U.S. employer), this discussion will largely be irrelevant to you as you will probably have no rights to Social Security Retirement Benefits.\n\nHowever, for the former USC or LPR who falls into any of the following categories, and worked full-time for the requisite 40 quarters, they should have Social Security Retirement Benefits that are due and payable when they meet the age requirements:\n\nself-employed (and paid and filed self-employment tax returns – paying social security); or\n\nemployed within the United States (even by a foreign employer); or\n\nemployed outside the United States by a U.S. employer.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of how and when these federal employment taxes apply (including at what rates), please see “Comparative Overview of U.S. and Mexican Federal Employment Taxes,” CCH International Tax Journal, November–December 2009. Current Social Security Tax Rates, and the taxable base – contribution base (which adjusts annually) can be reviewed on the Social Security Website.\n\nThe 1996 and 2004 statutory amendments reflected above, do not modify the rights of former USCs or LPRs. They do affect the rights of individuals who were not USCs or LPRs; namely who did not have legal immigration status while working and living in the U.S.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of this part of the law, please see the Congressional Research Report of 2010 titled Social Security Benefits for Noncitizens.\n\nThe final conclusion about whether the Social Security Act restricts social security retirement benefits to “covered expatriates”, can NOT be expressly found in the statute or the regulations themselves. There is no affirmative answer in Title 42 or the regulations thereunder, regarding “covered expatriates.” It is silent on the issue and not expressly addressed.\n\nMost importantly, throughout the Social Security Act and regulations thereunder, because of the “silence” of the statute, there are no restrictions expressly imposed on “covered expatriates” or any other former USCs or LPRs. This category of persons, “covered expatriates” is not somehow identified or segregated in the law for disparate treatment. The law provides generally that Social Security Retirement Benefits are available to non-citizens and those who no longer have LPR status; provided they meet the previous work and eligibility requirements. Shedding USC or LPR does not strip these individuals of these benefits.\n\nWhile it is always hard (impossible) to “prove a negative”; our office has also received telephonic confirmation from technical support personnel of the Social Security Administration, that the above conclusion is a correct interpretation of the law.\n\nStay tuned to another post about how the U.S. imposes income and withholding taxes on Social Security benefits to “covered expatriates”; which is indeed different than for current USCs (and some LPRs) residing overseas.\n\n请点击这里查看本帖子的中文版本。 （Please click here to view the above in Chinese.）\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe IRS does not give a “Certificate of Expatriation” or similar tax document . . .\n\nAfter a U.S. citizen has formally renounced (or relinquished) their U.S. citizenship, the U.S. Department of State provides a “Certificate of Loss of Nationality” (“CLN”). This form can be located here at – Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States, Form DS-4083 (CLN)\n\nAlso, lawful permanent residents who formally abandon their “green card” status will do so by filing an Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status Form I-407.\n\nThose LPRs who mail the Form I-407, will never receive any type of confirmation from the government, other than their own copies of documents filed and proof of mailing it (e.g., certified mail, return receipt). If the Form I-407 is presented to the U.S. Consulate or Embassy, the individual should receive a stamped copy of the form which should be given to the former LPR by the consular officer.\n\nHowever, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) which has very different responsibilities as compared to the U.S. Department of State, does not issue any sort of similar document to the CLN. There is no equivalent “Tax CLN.” Indeed, many individuals feel let down or “without closure” when they learn that it is a one-way flow of information; from the individual to the IRS. The IRS does not have an obligation to even confirm receipt of the documents filed with the IRS.\n\nThis is quite disorienting for many USCs and LPRs residing overseas, where the revenue authority in their country will regularly give a confirmation of tax documents received. Sometimes, a government will provide a confirmation of the taxes owing and paid through some specific type of feedback or response.\n\nThe IRS does no such a thing; and there is no document that will come from the IRS certifying “tax expatriation” has occurred.\n\nThe legal burden is therefore generally on the taxpayer to be able to prove the filing of the tax returns and IRS Form 8854. See, How many former U.S. citizens and long-term lawful permanent residents have filed (or will file) IRS Form 8854?\n\nFiling the returns through an overnight courier service (e.g., DHL, Federal Express, etc.) and maintaining the proof of mailing and delivery is always important. If the tax documents are filed from the U.S., they should always be sent with such proof, or via U.S. certified mail, return receipt. One recommendation/pointer, is to ask the IRS to stamp date the receipt (e.g., a copy of the cover/transmittal letter) and return it to you in a self-addressed return envelope.\n\nAll of this is quite important, particularly to get the “clock ticking” against the IRS to bring an audit, under the statute of limitations period. See, When the U.S. Tax Law has no Statute of Limitations against the IRS; i.e., for the U.S. citizen and LPR residing outside the U.S.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSurprise – You are Not a Citizen After All . . . NYT Article – After Forming Deep Roots in U.S., Man Discovers He Isn’t a Citizen\n\nThe New York Times has a fascinating article titled After Forming Deep Roots in U.S., Man Discovers He Isn’t a Citizen, May 12, 2014, by Lizette Alvarez.\n\nThe article discusses the “opposite” of someone considering expatriation; rather when a long-term resident of the U.S., who always thought he was a U.S. citizen, discovers he is not, to his dismay.\n\nIronically, if Mr. Mario Hernandez was never a U.S. citizen (and never a lawful permanent resident) he would be able to leave the U.S. without having adverse U.S. income tax consequences (nor his family and friends having adverse gift or inheritance tax consequences), if he can comply with the certification requirement of Section 877(a)(2)C). Never being a USC or a LPR is a blessing in disguise, when it comes to the application of the “expatriation tax” rules.\n\nSince the resources dedicated in tax-expatriation.com focus on USCs and LPRs who reside outside the U.S., this is just a theoretical observation that surely would not be in the interest of this gentleman who has lived most of his life in the U.S. and has always considered himself a “U.S. person.”\n\nNYT’s article –\n\n. . . Mario Hernandez made a discovery recently that rattled him to his core: He is not an American citizen. In fact, he is not even a United States resident.\n\nNobody had ever told him. Not his mother or his grandparents. Not the United States Army, where he served for three years in the 1970s. Not the election supervisors in four states who tallied his votes in every major election since Jimmy Carter won the White House. Not the two state agencies where he was employed, one in Washington State and the other in Florida. And not the two federal agencies, including the Justice Department, where he spent most of his career as a prison supervisor handling notorious inmates and undergoing thorough background checks every five years. Citizenship is a requirement for the job.\n\nThe revelation came only after Mr. Hernandez and his wife, Bonita, started planning a trip to celebrate his recent retirement from the Bureau of Prisons after 22 years. The two had settled on a Caribbean cruise, which would have been Mr. Hernandez’s first time out of the country since arriving in 1965 as a Cuban refugee. On a cruise line website, he found out that a United States passport was a requirement. He did not have one and wondered whether he even had naturalization papers.\n\nThe article highlights a number of key considerations. First, how any U.S. citizen, living in any part of the world, must have a U.S. passport to enter into the U.S. See an earlier post – Coming to America. . . Accidental Americans Beware – The Law Requires a U.S. Passport!\n\nThere are a host of practical problems for people who live both in and outside of the U.S. who do not have a U.S. passport. This article highlights a very important example.\n\nThe article also demonstrates the complexity of anyone knowing with certainty, their own citizenship status and whether they are a “U.S. person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Imagine, the difficulties that financial institutions and companies throughout the world will have to comply with FATCA, as they attempt to identify whether their existing or new customer accounts or owners validly hold USC or LPR status. See, The Catch 22 of Opening a Bank Account in Your Own Country – for USCs and LPRs.\n\nIncidentally, in the case of Mr. Mario Hernandez, he was a “U.S. person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes for all of the years he resided in the U.S. This is true, even if he had no legal immigration status to live in the U.S. Anyone satisfying the physical residency rules (“substantial presence test”), regardless of their legal or illegal immigration status, will be a U.S. income tax resident and subject to income tax and reporting on their worldwide income. See, “Tax Simplification: The Need for Consistent Tax Treatment of All Individuals (Citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents and Non-Citizens Regardless of Immigration Status) Residing Overseas, Including the Repeal of U.S. Citizenship Based Taxation,” by Patrick W. Martin and Professor Reuven Avi-Yonah, 2013.\n\n请点击这里查看本帖子的中文版本。 （Please click here to view the above in Chinese.）\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLoss of US Nationality – Renunciation versus Relinquishment?\n\n[The following is a Guest Post from Immigration Lawyer Ms. Teodora Purcell and does not address tax issues.\n\nA word of caution – Do not be lulled in to thinking that by “relinquishment” you have escaped the federal tax consequences of Sections 877, 877A, 2801, 7701(a)(50), et. seq. See, Why Section 7701(a)(50) is so important for those who “relinquished” citizenship years ago (without a CLN)] See also, How many former U.S. citizens and long-term lawful permanent residents have filed (or will file) IRS Form 8854?]\n\nLoss of US Nationality – Renunciation versus Relinquishment?\n\nIf you are a US citizen or a US non-citizen national,[1] you can lose your nationality (“expatriate”) by committing certain acts specified in the immigration statute [2] voluntarily and with the intention to relinquish your nationality.[3]\n\nExpatriation is a personal right that cannot be exercised by another, for example, a parent cannot renounce the US citizenship of a minor child. Your motivation is also not relevant, unless you later claim you gave up your US citizenship under duress or involuntary\n\nHow can you lose US nationality?\n\nYou can lose your US nationality as a result of renunciation or relinquishment and if you make such a claim, the burden is on you to show by preponderance of the evidence (i.e. more likely than not) that all requirements have been met.[4]\n\nThe most unequivocal and the formal way of losing your US nationality is by virtue of renunciation, i.e. when you formally give up your US citizenship by taking a sworn renunciation oath before a diplomatic or consular officer abroad[5].\n\nOther expatriating acts under the immigration statute include: entering or serving in the armed forces of a foreign state engaged in hostilities against the United States or serving as a commissioned or non-commissioned officer in the armed forces of a foreign state; or accepting policy level employment with a foreign government after the age of 18 (if you have the nationality of that foreign state or an oath of allegiance is required in accepting the position);; or if are convicted of treason against the US Government.[6]\n\nThe expatriating act must occur abroad (except for an oath of renunciation taken during the state of war or conviction of treason) for it to be effective.[7]\n\nIf you perform an expatriating act listed in the statute, there is a rebuttable presumption that it was voluntarily.\n\nIf you relinquish your US citizenship, you must establish not only the expatriating act, but also your intent to expatriate and complete a detailed questionnaire (Form DS-4079, Request for Determining Possible Loss of US Citizenship) [8] have an interview with a US diplomatic or consular officer abroad, and get it approved by a Department of State (DOS) official which will issue a Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States, Form DS-4083 (CLN)[9].\n\nFormal renunciation of citizenship at a US Consulate is the quicker and more unequivocal way to give up your US citizenship.[10]\n\nHowever, if you renounce your US citizenship, it is much more difficult to establish a lack of intent or duress if you seek reconsideration at a later time.\n\n[1] INA § 308\n\n[2] Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”)\n\n[3] INA § 349\n\n[4] INA § 349(a)\n\n[5] INA § 349(a)(5).
