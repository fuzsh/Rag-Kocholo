        "text": "Karaoke is the only music heard these days in the two remaining Russian Orthodox churches here. Now they are both restaurants. But a short walk away, in a part of the city once called Little Russia, stands a tall plinth topped by an elegant bust of the poet Alexander Pushkin.\n\nErected in 1937 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death as a result of a duel, its presence serves as a reminder that with a population of roughly 25,000, Russians were by far the most populous group of Europeans living in Shanghai in the 1920s. Stateless victims of the 1917 Revolution, the White Russians were absorbed into the polyglot world of old Shanghai, cultured outcasts who did much to give the \"Whore of the East\" its reputation for sin, nightlife and glamour.\n\nThen there were the Bolsheviks. Without Soviet gold, advisers and weapons, it is quite possible that modern China might be a different place than it is today, a fact largely overlooked as Shanghai, along with the rest of the country, prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.\n\nBut history is written by those who pay the bills, and these days Russia can scarcely afford the cover charge. Shanghai's stately Russian Embassy, commissioned by Czar Nicholas II in 1916, caught fire recently and looks as though it hasn't been painted since Mao swam the Yangtse.\n\nHeavy curtains guard the eyes of the gothic pile that squats where the Suzhou Creek meets the Huangpu River, a unique vantage point from which to survey Shanghai's magnificent old Bund. When China and the Soviet Union had their falling out in the late 1950s it was converted into a seamen's club and, although the Russians reclaimed it in 1986, the building hasn't really recovered from the indignities visited upon it by marauding Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nVladimir Gaissine, the Russian vice consul here, complains that most of his consulate's tiny budget, with the ruble being devalued almost daily, goes to \"entertaining visiting generals and bigwigs from Moscow.\" Consular staff members, unable to afford expensive foreign schools in Shanghai on their meager salaries, have organized a makeshift school, where parents take turns trying to teach their children.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
