        "text": "Rational Resistance to Cultural Assimilation\n\nSocial scientists have studied Black immigrant assimilation for decades, motivated by the observation that Black immigrants seem to resist assimilation into the racialized US landscape, with important implications for their integration.5 Relying first on Caribbean immigrant experiences but more recently extending the analysis to African immigrants to the US, scholars have found that – in contrast to other immigrant groups – resistance to assimilation among Black immigrants yields better economic (Portes and Zhou, 1993; Waters, 1999) and health (Hamilton, 2014; Koya and Egede, 2007) outcomes. Indeed, the selection effect of immigration to the U.S. has led to the arrival of relatively highly-educated Black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean (Tesfai, 2017). In the United States, these immigrants are then perceived as African Americans (Bonilla-Silva, 2004a), exposed to racial discrimination and prejudice; as a result, for these immigrants, assimilation means the possibility of down-ward social mobility (Mittelberg and Waters (1992), p. 425). Haitian immigrants to the US, for example, transition from a context where race is fluid and somewhat endogenous to class – upper-class Blacks, for example, are perceived as closer to white Europeans – to a context where race is a sticky and exogenous social identity (Mittelberg and Waters, 1992; Vickerman, 1999).\n\nAs a result, Black immigrants to the US tend to adopt a process of selective assimilation, in which they retain elements of their immigrant culture and identification (Portes and Zhou, 1993; Waters et al., 2010). A case study of Ethiopian immigrants in Washington DC finds that these immigrants prefer to identify as “African”, “Ethiopian American,” or “Ethiopian,” rather than “Black” (Chako, 2003). African immigrant students in Atlanta also use ethnicity as a buffer against discrimination (Ogundipe, 2011). These deliberate efforts to resist assimilation do not appear to dissipate over immigrant generations. The children of middle-income Nigerian immigrants to the US adopt a hybrid identity, in which they distance themselves from low-income African Americans (Imoagene, 2017). And an ethnographic study of West Indian and West African immigrant children in New York City, reveals that these second and one-and-a-half generation immigrants deliberately retain elements of their immigrant culture through cuisine, fashion, and language (Sall, 2019). Black immigrants are rational when they resist assimilating into American culture and being misidentified as African Americans: they resist a lowering of their social and economic status (Hamilton, 2019).\n\nCentral to literature on Black immigrant integration is the recognition that Black immigrants resist assimilation because they are otherwise indistinguishable from the stigmatized and marginalized African American population. In reference to Afro-Caribbean immigrants and African Americans, Rogers (2001) notes, “under the peculiar American system of racial ascription, the two groups are practically indistinguishable by phenotype” (p. 174). Ogundipe (2011), echoing an insight from Bryce-Laporte (1972), describes Black immigrants as “invisible” and Butterfield (2004) reports that second-generation West Indians are frustrated by the fact that “their phenotype places them into a situation in which they are assumed to be African American” (p. 83). Tormala and Deaux (2006) emphasize how this racial lumping translates into increased discrimination: “at automatic and nonconscious levels, Black immigrants and Black Americans are perceived in the same way. Whether by passersby, customers walking around a store, or drivers in an upper-class neighborhood, Black immigrants will be categorized as Black and subjected to the same kinds of race-based bias and discrimination as American Blacks” (p. 137).\n\nThis fact puts Black immigrants in a decidedly different position vis-à-vis the American racial landscape than most other immigrant groups. Earlier waves of immigrants were able to avoid discrimination – even when such stigma was assumed to be driven by racial difference – by distancing themselves from African Americans (Kim, 2003; Loewen, 1971; McClain et al., 2006) or culturally assimilating into white American culture, with some groups even “becoming white” (Ignatiev, 1995; Jacobson, 1998; Roediger, 2005; Sacks, 1998). Those for whom assimilation as white is limited by phenotypic and cultural characteristics – as is the case for many Asians and non-Black Latinos – are typically seen as perpetual foreigners, which the American racial hierarchy tends to place in a middle ranking, well below white Americans but still above African Americans (Kim, 1999; Forman, Goar and Lewis, 2002; Alco, 2003; Kim, 2003; Bonilla-Silva, 2004b; Greer, 2013; Trietler, 2013).6 For such groups, assimilation moves them up in the racial hierarchy, even if not all the way to the top. However, Black immigrants face a markedly different situation: the social and institutional legacies of chattel slavery in the United States, such as the uniquely-American one drop rule that ascribes a Black identity to anyone with identifiable African heritage (Davis, 1991), make it virtually impossible to escape racial classification as Black for most immigrants from Africa.7 Thus, it is only among those ascribed a Black racial identity that overtly signaling foreign heritage results in moving up, rather than down, the racial hierarchy.\n\nHistorical accounts of African Americans donning turbans and robes, claiming to be foreign dignitaries, and successfully accessing spaces that were off limits to African Americans in the Jim Crow era (Kramer, 2011), exemplify the value of a foreign identity relative to an African American one. For those African Americans, signaling foreign heritage was a strategy to escape Black subjugation when passing as white was not an option. Similarly, most African immigrants today do not have the option to assimilate as white Americans and, thus, the loss of a foreign status results in default classification as African American. As a result, the risk to Black immigrants comes not from assimilation into African American culture, but from assimilating into any facet of American culture that erases the visibility of their foreign heritage.8\n\nResearch suggests that Black immigrants are aware of the benefits of foreign heritage within the American racial hierarchy. Thus, as documented by Waters (1999), Black immigrants prioritize and signal an ethnic or national identity that differentiates them from African Americans. In particular, Waters finds that “by evoking their foreign status” Black immigrants aim to “‘exit’ from the stigmatized black category” (Waters, 1999, p.151). Subsequent work on Black immigrants echoes this finding: it shows that Black immigrants strategically distance themselves from African Americans in order to reduce their exposure to race-based discrimination (e.g., Chako, 2003; Foner, 1998; Greer, 2013; Guenther, Pendaz and Makene, 2011; Howard, 2003; Imoagene, 2017; Mensah and Williams, 2015; Ogundipe, 2011; Portes, 2004; Rogers, 2006; Trietler, 2013; Husain, 2019).9 The evidence as to whether African Americans are actually subject to more race-based discrimination than Black immigrants is limited, yet it is certainly a commonly reported belief among Black immigrants.10 In particular, Black immigrants who are able to “foster a perception of themselves as different from the bottom…of the racial hierarchy” (Trietler, 2013) expect to be granted a form of “elevated minority status” (Greer, 2013), in which they are still subject to race-based discrimination, but of a less extreme form: they are viewed as “different, special, and good” Blacks (Rogers, 2006).11\n\nBlack immigrants can signal an ethnic or national identity in numerous ways in order to differentiate themselves from African Americans. For example, not Americanizing one’s own name, giving one’s children ethnic names, wearing national or ethnic-signaling attire, using their native languages in public, valuing ingroup over outgroup marriages, and choosing to live in particular neighborhoods – behaviors referred to elsewhere as “ethnic embeddedness” (Waters et al., 2010) – all signal an identity separate from African Americans. While such outward signals of ethnic and national identity among immigrants are certainly shaped by a multitude of factors – including underlying strength of group attachment or efforts to reinforce community commitments, among others – we follow others in arguing that they also serve as investments in distinctiveness.\n\nInvestments in ethnocultural distinctiveness are not trivial. Immigrants to the United States, from the earlier wave of European immigration to the more recent wave of immigration from Latin America and Asia, all follow an assimilationist trend over time (Waters and Jiménez, 2005): within two generations, immigrants become “more like other native-born Americans than their parents were” across all measurable outcomes (Waters and Pineau, 2015, p.3). Absent concerted efforts to remain distinctive, immigrant groups assimilate, not necessarily because they seek this out, but rather as a result of weaker incentives to resist it. Racism in the US means that all Black immigrants are likely to resist assimilation more than non-Black groups, but that they may do so at different rates based on the strength of group-specific disincentives for assimilation. Our argument concerns this relative difference in incentives, and its implications for assimilation.\n\nWe focus, in particular, on variation in immigrants’ distinctiveness based on physical appearance, which shapes whether they are perceived to have recent immigrant heritage or not. Black immigrants to the United States are a diverse group, and not all are equally likely to be mistaken for African Americans. Recognition of this within-group variation in immigrant visibility is our central theoretical contribution. While existing research highlights the role of racial discrimination in the assimilation of Black immigrants relative to other immigrant groups, we focus on the differential risks of cultural assimilation among Black immigrants with different propensities to be misidentified as African American and the incentives that creates for reification of ethnic boundaries. This within-group approach provides significant analytical leverage: it allows us to disaggregate race-of-immigrant effects and focus on the constituent component of immigrant race – phenotypic overlap with African Americans – that is theoretically posited to shape assimilation outcomes (Sen and Wasow, 2016). In addition, focusing on variation among Black immigrants allows us to better isolate the role of racial discrimination in driving assimilation outcomes, while holding constant many other facets of the immigrant experience that also shape ethnocultural behaviors. Thus, we argue that while it is not the sole factor shaping immigrant assimilation, a Black immigrant’s propensity to be misidentified as African American creates incentives to adopt or maintain ethnic markers as a means to mitigate race-based discrimination.\n\nResults\n\nWe present our results in four sections below. First, we use the qualitative data from our in-depth interviews and the accompanying lab experiment to show clear regional patterns to phenotypic overlap with African Americans, with immigrants from the Horn of Africa region being less commonly miscategorized as African American. Second, this finding leads us to focus on variation in phenotypic overlap with African Americans among a single national origin group – Somalis. In particular, we leverage the difference in risk of racial lumping between ethnic Somali, who have less phenotypic overlap with African Americans, and ethnic Somali Bantu, who are phenotypically closer to African Americans. Third, we use survey data to show that the Somali Bantu resist assimilation more across a host of cultural indicators. Fourth, we provide evidence for our mechanism, i.e. that this difference in assimilation is driven by differential concern about racial discrimination.\n\nOur interviews and lab experiment allow us to establish that some African immigrants are more identifiable as such, while others are more often mistaken for African Americans. The data also suggest that one of the strongest correlates of being misclassified as African American is the region from which the immigrant or their parents migrated. In particular, immigrants from the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia) reported being much more visible as immigrants within the larger American context. In our student interviews, respondents with heritage from outside the Horn repeatedly mentioned that others perceived them to be African Americans. Ross, who immigrated from Benin as a child, said “You are Black. There are not going to know, oh you are African” and Joyce, an Ivoirian American, said “when you first see me you see Black. You don’t see that I’m African or whatever. It doesn’t really matter I’m still Black.” Jackie, a second generation Nigerian American, similarly said “people looking at me on the outside without looking at my name…they are going to be like “oh she’s African American.”‘ Another second generation Nigerian American, Paul, also felt that most Americans assume he’s African American: “People from other races when they look at me, they don’t really see different parts of Africa, they see African American.” And Sarah, a recent immigrant from Ghana, recalled, “my roommate, she didn’t recognize me as African before I told her ‘I’m African, I came from Ghana.’ I think they can’t really tell until you say it, or start speaking.”\n\nIn contrast, interview subjects from the Horn clearly recognized that Americans distinguish them from African Americans. One respondent of Ethiopian heritage, Rachel, remarked that people say that she is “black but not ‘Black’.” Cara, a first generation Somali immigrant, said that Americans “almost always they know I’m East African” and Mary, a recent immigrant from Ethiopia, said “they know that I’m not [African American], either I’m mixed or Somali or East African.” Similarly, Nancy, an Ethiopian immigrant who came to the U.S. as a child, said “I was always mistaken as native American or Latina, or something, they always said I looked exotic.” Marlum, an American whose parents are Somali, remarked that other people often say to her “you look foreign.”\n\nMost of these respondents from the Horn of Africa focused on their physical appearance as marking them distinct from African Americans. Thomas, a recent immigrant from Eritrea, remarked that Americans know he and other Eritreans are not African Americans “by our looks” and Rachel, a second generation Ethiopian American said “I’m not sure what they mistake me as, especially since I’m a lighter complexion. I’ve gotten different, you know, non-Black… they think I’m not Black or not African.” Ariel, a second generation Ethiopian American, recounted, “From what I’ve experienced, people don’t assume I’m African. Even when I tell them, they go, ‘Oh, you’re light,’ or some other stupid comment.” Cara, originally from Somalia, noted that “we have different hair” and Thomas, originally from Eritrea, said “most of the Eastern Africans look alike, with a light skin color and a different look than most African nations.” Halima, a 1.5 generation Somali immigrant, noted that “people say that our features are kind of different as East Africans compared to African Americans.”\n\nThese stark patterns are consistent with existing knowledge about phenotypic differences within Africa. Those who hail from the Horn of Africa region are primarily Afroasiatic peoples, who are, on average, phenotypically distinct from the Bantu and Nilotic groups that comprise the majority of the rest of the continent and from which most African Americans descend (Tishkoff et al., 2009). Existing evidence suggests that many Afroasiatic peoples do not consider themselves Black or ethnically African, although they acknowledge that they are typically ascribed a Black racial identity within the US context (e.g., Eno and Eno, 2010; Habecker, 2012).\n\nThe lab portion of our study further corroborated the self-reports that African immigrants from the Horn of Africa are less often mistaken for African Americans. In particular, student participants correctly identified photographs of African immigrants from the Horn as immigrants 75% of the time, compared to only 51% for African immigrants not from the Horn (t = 2.77, p < 0.05).19 This difference, however, disappears when the name or video stimuli are provided instead of the photo, which suggests that immigrants with Horn of Africa origins are more visible as immigrants based primarily on physical appearance.20\n\nThe results of our student study highlight that region of origin within Africa has a strong bearing on immigrant visibility vis-à-vis Blacks in the American context. However, the study was limited to university students, and there are likely to be other significant differences between immigrants from the Horn and other regions. Our next step was thus to expand to an off-campus community context, and to try to isolate visibility due to Afroasiatic heritage while holding many other factors constant. This led us to a focus on two distinct ethnic communities from Somalia: ethnic Somali (referred to within the Somali diaspora as Somali Somali) and Somali Bantu.\n\nThe distinction between these two communities is due, in large part, to the fact that ethnic Somali have largely Afroasiatic heritage, while the Somali Bantu – a minority of around 5% within Somalia – are of Bantu-Nilotic origins. The ethnic Bantu are a heterogenous group, but within Somalia they are all called Jareer (hard hair) to distinguish them from ethnic Somalis, who are perceived to have softer hair (Eno and Kusow, 2014). Today, the ethnic boundary, both within Somalia and in the US, is relatively impermeable (Menkhaus, 2003; Besteman, 2016).\n\nHowever, while long victimized (Besteman, 2012, 2016; Eno and Kusow, 2014; Grady, 2015), the construction of a distinct Somali Bantu ethnic identity is a recent one, dated to the discussion of “Somali farmers with Black African physical features” (Menkhaus, 2003, p.335) by the international community during the 1991 famine in Somalia. The term was coined to describe a class of subsistence farmers with no status in the Somali lineage system and with a shared history of discrimination at the hands of ethnic Somalis (Declich, 2000; Deramo, 2016; Menkhaus, 2003). Until that point, these “riverine identities remained diverse [and] localized” (Besteman, 2012, p.288) and the individuals now identified as Somali Bantu possessed “almost none of the features typically associated with a cohesive ethnic group” (Menkhaus, 2010, p.93). Eventually, the Somali Bantu were identified by the US State Department as eligible for refugee priority status as a persecuted ethnic group in need of resettlement. After a decade in camps for refugees and the internally displaced, approximately 10,000 Somali Bantus were resettled throughout the US in the early 2000s.\n\nEthnic Somalis also resettled in the United States as refugees beginning in the 1980s and in significant numbers after the collapse of Somalia in 1991. Although they escaped violence and resettled as refugees, their status in Somalia was never as dire as that of the Somali Bantu. Indeed, all ethnic Somalis belong to a clan – each of different Arab lineage – and while the clans themselves occupy clear positions in a hierarchical structure, they are socially, economically, and politically superior to the non-clan ethnic minorities of the country. To be sure, many ethnic Somalis also suffered tremendously at the hands of the country’s dictator, Siad Barre, who terrorized certain clans such as the Hawiye and the Isaaq as he lost his grip on power after the end of the Cold War.\n\nWe focus our study on these two communities in the context of Columbus, OH. Columbus offers a unique opportunity because it is home to the second largest Somali population in the US (after Minneapolis), but unlike most other concentrations of Somalis, includes large populations of both ethnic Bantus and ethnic Somalis. The estimated size of the ethnic Somali community in Columbus is around 55,000 individuals, while the size of the Somali Bantu community is estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000 individuals.21 Columbus is also home to a large African American population, about 28% according to the 2010 Census, and the city suffers from stark racial inequality and severe segregation. This means that the risk of systematic racial discrimination for new Black immigrants is quite real.\n\nIn April of 2017, we conducted a series of focus group discussions with the Somali community in Columbus to further probe our intuition that the differential risk of racial lumping that we had identified in the lab would apply to the ethnic differences among Somalis. Recruited via our research assistants’ social networks, our focus group participants were organized into eight groups of 10, for a total sample size of 80. To facilitate widespread participation, we organized the groups by gender, ethnicity, and age. These focus groups were administered by coethnic interviewers in both English and the group’s ethnic language (Af-Maay or Af-Somali), and lasted approximately one and a half hours. They were held on a university campus or at community centers near Somali neighborhoods. We compensated participants for their time ($30), and we never recorded their names. We did record, transcribe, translate, and code the focus group conversations. We instructed focus group facilitators to ask questions and direct the conversation toward the following topics: life in the United States, identity and attitudes about race, American perceptions of Somalis/Bantus in the US, discrimination, social and cultural engagement with Americans, and political participation and attitudes.\n\nWe draw two main inferences from our analysis of how ethnic Bantus and ethnic Somalis responded to questions about American perceptions of their identity. First, while both ethnic Somalis and ethnic Bantus report that they are sometimes mistaken for African Americans, especially by white Americans, only ethnic Somalis also mention being ascribed other non-Black identities, such as mixed-race, Arab, or Indian. This suggests a larger identity repertoire to which ethnic Somalis are ascribed compared to ethnic Bantus. Second, when the participants discussed which characteristics differentiated them from African Americans, ethnic Somalis would often refer to physical traits such as the shape of their face or their hair, while ethnic Bantus only referred to their accent or dress. These patterns are consistent with the claim that ethnic Bantus are more likely to be ascribed an African American identity based on their appearance than are ethnic Somalis.\n\nWe first note that both ethnic Bantus and ethnic Somalis report that they are sometimes mistaken for African American. One ethnic Bantu male respondent explained that “When we are first seen, people think we are African American” and another concurred “For me, from far away, people think you are African American.” Similarly, among older ethnic Bantu male respondents, we were told: “Some people might think we are the same when they look at us but our culture is different”; younger ethnic Bantu female participants concurred: “Most of them think we are Black but we are Somali Bantu.”\n\nEthnic Somalis sometimes echoed this sentiment. The older ethnic Somali male participants claimed that ”the white man sees you as a Black man”, “In mainstream America, we are Black men. There is only Black and white. That is it. Do you get it? You are a Black man.” Older ethnic Somali female participants concurred: “For most of the white people they are unable to distinguish them, Black is Black,” as did younger ethnic Somali male participants: “when I’m out by myself I’m just a Black guy.”\n\nAt the same time, however, ethnic Somalis – but, importantly, not ethnic Bantus – raised numerous examples of also being mistaken for other identities. One older ethnic Somali woman claimed that “for us adults, they may think we are from other countries such as the Middle East.” Another mentioned being asked if she is from India, while a younger ethnic Somali woman who wears a headscarf said she has been mistaken for an Arab. One young ethnic Somali male respondent remembers being identified as mixed-race: “I think they kinda assume that I was mixed. Maybe cause of my hair, you know.” One older ethnic Somali man recounted a story of another participant being stopped by a police officer while they were together. He said, “You remember what he wrote? He wrote that you were white.” In fact, one ethnic Somali explicitly noted the ethnic difference at the heart of our research strategy, saying, “There is also differences in the Somali community. So, you’re obviously gonna be able to tell that an [ethnic Somali clan name] is not African American, you know. But then if you meet a Bantu Somali maybe, or a darker ethnic Somali person, then there’s a chance that they pass as African American.” These differences confirm that ethnic Somalis have a wider repertoire of identities ascribed to them in the US context, including non-African American identities, than do ethnic Bantus.\n\nSecond, when discussing what drives their visibility as immigrants or foreigners, ethnic Bantu respondents consistently referred to factors such as language, dress, and culture, while ethnic Somalis added other more exogenous characteristics, such as the color of their skin, the shape of their face, the texture of their hair, or more generally their features. One respondent put it clearly: “Even though we are all Black, there [are] a lot of characteristics that distinguish us. For us Somalis, we look alike and we have the same color, even if some are lighter than others, but it is clear that we are Somalis and clearly distinguishable from other Blacks. ” One respondent claimed “I think a lot of the differences that people might see would be physical features like hair texture for the most part,” and another echoed that Somalis looked different due to, ”regular facial features, the nose maybe, the the size of a forehead, the the hair texture and all that.” Someone else agreed unequivocally: “I don’t have to tell them where I am from, they already know from my face.” When asked if this was because of the way he dressed, the participant emphasized that it was “from the face.”\n\nOur choice to study the experience of ethnic Somalis and ethnic Bantus allows us to isolate the effects of an immigrant’s perceived phenotypic overlap while holding other characteristics constant: both groups come from the same country, both are Muslim, both migrated as refugees. At the same time, as evidenced by the above discussion, these groups face different risks of being mistaken for African Americans, allowing us to analyze the extent to which this drives resistance to assimilation. In so doing, our research design closely follows those of Laitin (1986) and Adida, Laitin and Valfort (2016), which compare two groups that are similar in a number of potentially confounding ways, but differ on the key variable of interest.22\n\nWe leverage the difference in phenotypic overlap with African Americans among the ethnic Somali and Somali Bantu of Columbus to better understand how the risk of being mistaken for African American is related to cultural assimilation. We conceptualize cultural assimilation, and investment in ethnic markers, with a focus on endogamy (marriage within one’s ethnic group) and naming practices. We follow a rich literature in the social sciences that considers endogamy and naming to be indicators of assimilation (Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson, 2017; Biavaschi, Giuletti and Siddique, 2017; Fouka, 2019; Kalmijn, 1998; Qian and Lichter, 2007; Saavedra, 2018). It is worth noting that these measures capture the maintenance or loss of markers of recent foreign heritage, rather than which specific facets of American culture (e.g., white or Black culture) are adopted in their stead. We also create an aggregate measure of resistance to assimilation using the mean of standardized components. of the appendix reports summary statistics for each of the three variables and the index measure of resistance to assimilation.\n\nWe first report simple differences-in-means between ethnic Somalis and ethnic Bantus on three measures of cultural markers: whether the respondent is married to a coethnic, whether the respondent prefers that their children marry a coethnic, and whether the respondent prefers to give their child a first name that signals their ethnicity. Our preliminary results are striking: on all three measures of investment in cultural markers, ethnic Bantu respondents score significantly higher than do ethnic Somali respondents. Ethnic Bantus are more likely to have a coethnic spouse (97% vs. 89%, χ2 = 10.36, p < 0.01), to value the importance of their child marrying a coethnic (2.72 vs. 2.01 on a four-point scale, t = 11.83, p < 0.001), and to prefer that their children have an ethnically-distinct first name (91% vs. 59%, χ2 = 66.16, p < 0.001). Thus, we also see a large ethnic difference for the index of resistance to cultural assimilation (0.37 vs. −0.38, t = 12.22, p < 0.001).\n\nTo gauge the differences in cultural assimilation and ethnic markers by ethnic group, controlling for the potentially confounding differences between the two groups, we estimate the below model for each measure of cultural assimilation:\n\nyi=β1Bantui+β2Xi+∈i\n\nwhere i is the survey respondent, Y is a measure of resistance to assimilation, β1 captures the difference between ethnic Bantus and ethnic Somalis, and X is a vector of controls, including a respondent’s age, sex, education level (primary education completed or not), household income, employment status, and immigrant generation (second generation or not).\n\nThe results, presented in , illustrate patterns that are consistent with our theoretical expectations.23 Controlling for potential confounds, we observe that ethnic Bantus invest in cultural markers more than do their ethnic Somali counterparts. In particular, married Somali Bantu are significantly more likely to have a coethnic spouse, to say that they prefer that their children marry a coethnic, and to prefer ethnic names for their children. Model 4 of confirms that ethnic Bantus score significantly higher on the overall index of resistance to cultural assimilation.\n\nTable 1:\n\n(1)(2)(3)(4)Coethnic SpouseChild Coethnic SpouseChild Ethnic NameResist Assim.

But are these differences really driven by efforts to avoid race-based discrimination? We recognize that immigrants may resist assimilation for a host of different reasons; this section provides evidence consistent with our argument that differential racism avoidance is likely to account for at least some of the observed difference in assimilation across the two groups.\n\nFirst, because the theorized mechanism of racism avoidance is driven by exposure to race-based discrimination in the US, we expect that ethnic differences in assimilation resistance increases with time in the US. In below, based on Models 1 and 2 of , we show patterns of resistance to assimilation by immigrant generation and by years in the US.24 Consistent with expectation, these results show that while resistance for ethnic Somalis decreases with generation and remains stable over time among the first generation, resistance to assimilation actually increases over time among ethnic Bantu immigrants and does not decline in the second generation. These results bolster our claim that it is something about the experience in the United States – which we argue is the systemic discrimination faced by African Americans – that puts these two Somali ethnic groups on divergent paths of assimilation.25 These results also help rule out the possibility that the ethnic differences that we document are driven by pre-emigration group differences in cultural investment. Even if ethnic Bantus bring stronger ethnic attachments with them from Somalia – a doubtful claim given accounts of the creation of the ethnic Bantu identity – we observe increased investment in ethnic markers that is unique to the ethnic Bantus since their migration to the United States.\n\nSecond, if differential risk of racism is indeed what is driving ethnic differences in assimilation, then ethnic Bantu should report a greater perceived threat of racial discrimination. Our qualitative data corroborates such a pattern. When asked explicitly about whether their Somali heritage protected them from racial discrimination, ethnic Bantu focus group participants were more likely than ethnic Somali to report that it did. For example, an older Somali Bantu man told us, “Yes. I am not Black American. With my Bantu origin, I have not had anything bad done to me.” Another ethnic Bantu emphasized the protective importance of their cultural identity, explaining, “we want our children to get education, and to learn the culture of our people…we have some kids that want to be gangsters; we want them to be protected.”26 Our quantitative data also reveal ethnic differences in perceived risk of racial discrimination. In particular, Somali Bantu survey respondents perceive their ethnic identity to be more protective relative to African Americans than do ethnic Somali: while 64% of Somali Bantu respondents believe that African Americans face more discrimination than do their own coethnics, only 20% of ethnic Somali think the same (χ2 = 66.9, p < 0.001).27 In addition, when asked to rank the degree to which four different identities expose each respondent to discrimination, Somali Bantu respondents ranked their racial identity significantly higher than did ethnic Somali (t = 4.75, p < 0.001).28 Together, these results bolster the claim that Somali Bantu resist assimilation more than ethnic Somali because of their heightened concern about race-based discrimination.\n\nThird, if Somali Bantu immigrants invest more in ethnic cultural markers than do ethnic Somalis in order to avoid being misidentified as African American, then we should also observe concerted efforts by ethnic Bantus to distance themselves – both attitudinally and behaviorally – from African Americans. Our focus group data suggest that Somali Bantus enact such distancing more strongly than ethnic Somalis. When asked whether they identified as African American, all four ethnic Bantu focus groups said no with full consensus, while three of the four ethnic Somali focus groups responded affirmatively, with only a few dissenters. An older Bantu woman exclaimed, “we cannot be like those people! We want peace in our household and protection for our kids so that they may get education and be in high positions.” We observe a similar pattern in two behavioral measures we obtain from our survey. The first looks at the make-up of the respondent’s five closest friends. We find that Somali Bantu respondents are much less likely to report having at least one African American friend than are ethnic Somali respondents (10% vs. 43%, χ2 = 67.03, p < 0.001).29 The second measure looks at where respondents live within the Columbus, Ohio area with respect to African Americans. Respondents reported their residential zip code, which we then linked to US census data to calculate the proportion of residents who are African American (see of the appendix). We find that Somali Bantu live in areas of the city with much smaller African American populations than do ethnic Somali (15% vs. 39%, t = 15.41, p < 0.001).30 The greater propensity for Somali Bantu to distance themselves both socially and physically from African Americans is consistent with our interpretation that their resistance to assimilation is driven by fear of being misidentified as African American."
