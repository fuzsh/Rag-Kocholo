Trieste taxation lawsuit:

action for annulment before the Court of Cassation.

The Court of Cassation in Rome lodged its decision No. 8600/22 in civil lawsuit RG 3337/2021, with which the International Provisional Representative of the Free Territory of Trieste â I.P.R. F.T.T. and 599 natural and legal persons, including businesses, request the demonstration of the general system of taxation that is to be enforced in Trieste.

The I.P.R. F.T.T. impugned the Supreme Court's decision with Writ of Summon for annulment No. 23050/22, because the Supreme Court's decision is against the law, as well as subversive of legality and of the international legal order established by the port-WWII Treaties of Peace, which recognize the present-day Free Territory of Trieste as an independent and neutral European sovereign State, with an international Free Port open to the ships and freight of all States, without discrimination.
