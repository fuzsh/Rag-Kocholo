        "text": "The Italian Republic, a young and fragile state, is a country in Southern Europe. It borders Austria to the East, the hostile Socialist Republic of Italy to the West, and Switzerland in a small strip to its northwest.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn the aftermath of the armistice at Venice and the end of the Weltkrieg in Italy, the Republic of Italy was proclaimed in Milan, Florence and Turin by furious nationalists, republicans and socialists - all of whom were determined to oust the foolhardy Savoyards. This act would spark the Italian Civil War which would last over a year. As the war progressed, it became apparent that the left and right wings of the Republic had irrevocable differences, and what started as small acts of sabotage became a full-fledged conflict between Reds and Whites. The Whites were driven back on all fronts by the Reds and were eventually forced to seek accommodation with the hated Austrians. The partnership was successful in stopping the newly-declared Socialist Republic of Italy, but after the ceasefire, the Republicans in Milan were forced to accede to the Italian Federation as the Republic of Lombardy-Venetia.\n\nThis arrangement worked well enough until 1926, when a war scare following the collapse of the British Empire allowed the Austrian-dominated Federation system to disintegrate. Austria withdrew its troops from the south, and a furious Sicily withdrew from the Federation, followed by Sardinia. The Federation now fulfilled little purpose, and when it came time to renew the delegates to the Federation Council in Milan in 1930, Prime Minister and Interim Head Ivanoe Bonomi chose not to, allowing the Federation to lapse, instead declaring the Italian Republic.\n\nSince the civil war, the Republic of Italy has slowly rebuilt herself. The cooperation with the Austrians has blossomed into a much stronger relationship, even if many more far-right nationalists bristle at the extensive influence that Austria has within the Republic. The Associazione Nazionalista Italiana in particular often rails against Austria's influence.\n\nIn 1927 Ivanoe Bonomi was first elected to the position of Prime Minister of the Republic with a Liberal Democrat majority. His government oversaw the transition into a Republic and was returned to power in 1932. However, this was not a clear landslide and he had to enter into a coalition with the Lega Democratica Riformista under Carlo Rossi. This coalition has seen much growth in the economy and prosperity for the Italians of the Republic.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nWith the proclamation of a Republic in 1919, Italy changed from a Kingdom to a parliamentary style republic. The Prime Minister of the republic is elected during the General Elections that are held every five years, though the Prime Minister holds the right to call for a new election at any time. Since the civil war ended a number of parties have formed often from the particular stances taken in the civil war. the province of Veneto has certain amount of autonomy, granted by the Treaty of Trieste.\n\nLega Democratica Riformista - Social Democrats\n\nPartito Liberale Democratico - Social Liberals\n\nPartito Liberale Italiano - Market Liberals\n\nPartito Popolare Italiano - Social Conservatives\n\nAssociazione Nazionalista Italiana - Nationalist Populist\n\nCabinet of Ivanoe Bonomi in 1936[]\n\nHead of State: Ivanoe Bonomi\n\nHead of Government: Carlo Rossi\n\nForeign Minister: Alberto Cianca\n\nEconomy Minister: Mario Bracci\n\nIntelligence Minister: Enrico Martino\n\nMilitary[]\n\nEsercito Nazionale Repubblicano[]\n\nThe Army of the Republic of Italy is called the Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano or the National Republic Army. Despite the break with the Kingdom of Italy when they proclaimed the Republic, the ENR is based upon the old army of the Kingdom. In particular with the Alps nearby, the Alpini make up a good portion of their army.\n\nThe army starts out with a total of 10 divisions in 1936. The army consists of 2 Alpini divisions with artillery support, 3 standard infantry divisions, and 5 infantry divisions with artillery support.\n\nMarina Nazionale Repubblicana[]\n\nThe Navy of the Republic of Italy is currently stationed in Venice. As with most things in the nation, the navy traces itself to the founding of the republic. Many of the captains and sailors mutinied and declared for the Republic while vessels mothballed in Venice were handed over to the Republican Navy under the alliance with Austro-Hungary. It consists of 1 battleship, 2 light cruisers, 16 destroyers, and 11 submarines.\n\nAeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana[]\n\nThe Air Force of the Republic is the youngest of the three branches of the Military. During the Weltkrieg, the Corpo Aeronautico Militare(as the Air Force was known then) was part of the Army and not a separate branch. Once the civil war came to an end the government proclaimed the ANR separate from the Army.\n\nIt has attracted a number of far-right people thanks in part to the support Italo Balbo has given the Air Force.\n\nIt starts in 1936 with 25 fighters.\n\nForeign Relations[]\n\nThe Italian Republic is recognized as the legitimate government of at least Northern Italy by most of the world, though many also recognize the Papal States in Rome, the Two Sicilies, and Sardinia-Piedmont.\n\nItaly has very good relations with Austria-Hungary, with the relationship being so close and the economies being so intertwined some consider the Italian Republic a puppet state of Austria. Some political parties such as the ANI and PLI wish to end the dependence on Austria, even if it means an end to the alliance.\n\nWhen the civil war ended, the Republic technically never declared peace with the Socialists and regard themselves as the legitimate government of northern Italy. Since the Federation dissolved, Italy has both recognized and claimed the territory of the remaining states in Italy, and most parties have pledged to aid each other against the Syndicalists.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nIndustry[]\n\nDespite the Republic's decently sized navy, they lack any dockyards. They have 8 civilian and 3 military factories in january of 1936.\n\nNatural Resources[]\n\nThe Italian Republic starts with 26 units of aluminum and 56 units of steel\n\nSee Also[]"
