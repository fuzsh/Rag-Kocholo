Schaeri now places increased emphasis on the vulnerability of the international zone in Vienna, and he expresses a fear that the Communists may be enabled to overthrow the Austrian Government by the in- adequate armament of the Vienna police and the necessity for unanimity among the occupying powers before the Allied pokers can intervene.

The Department has informed US Embassy London that the US would not be averse to a mutually satisfactory British-Argen- tine-Chilean settlement of overlapping claims in the islands \"which would safeguard essential points of British interest.\" GENERAL 2. Support for Chinese resolution on Kashmir case--The US delegation to the UN reports that the US, UK, Canada, and Belgium have agreed to support amended Chinese proposals to the Security Council for the settlement of the Kashmir case, upon the understanding however, that they were not committed to the plan and remained free to accept changes suggested either by India or Pakistan. UK Cabinet Minister Noel-Baker has told the US delegation that he is optimistic about the pos- sibilities of a settlement on the basis of these Chinese pro- posals. EUROPE 3. DENMARK: Acute nervousness continueg--US Ambassador Marvel has been told by Foreign Minister Rasmussen that the Danish Government is acutely nervous. Rasmussen con- siders that for the immediate future Denmark has little chance of being invited to join the Brussels treaty; he referred to the view of Netherlands Premier and Foreign Minister that no country should be invited until the five original members had \"consolidated their situation.\" Rasmussen also doubts that participation would ensure potential military assistance. 1 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 e) Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Referring to his Government's mid-March request for US arms, Rasmussen said Denmark might be forced to follow Norway in requesting US military guarantees. He declared that he disliked Joining Norway in breaking up Scandinavian solidarity, but, because it is satisfied that Sweden would remain neutral, Denmark must determine her course independently. 4. TRIESTE: Implications of possible transfer to Italy--US Poli- tical Adviser Joyce reports that the initial emotional outburst of enthusiasm in Trieste over the US-UK-French recommenda- tion for the return of the Territory to Italy has been followed by \"sober second thoughts\" on the implications of an Italian Trieste. Joyce attributes this moderated enthusiasm to the belief prevalent in Trieste that (a) without UK-US military pro- tection and economic support, Trieste as part of Italy would inevitably stagnate and lose half of its population; and (b) Italy Is in no position politically, economically or militarily to pro- tect its northern frontiers against a Communist and hostile Yugoslavia, unless US-UK troops remain in Trieste or the Halo-Yugoslav border is guaranteed under a military alliance between the US, the UK, and France. 5. GREECE: Griswold pessimistic er ros ts--AMAG Chief Griswold reports that, because the Greeks are increasingly fearful of the international situation, a crushing defeat of the guerrillas will not create the psychological factors essential for economic recovery to the extent previously anticipated. Although Griswold says that the internal military situation in Greece is improving, he fears that as the guerrillas south of the actual frontier zone are seriously threatened by the Greek Army, foreign aid to the guerrillas may be increased to such an extent that serious military and political as well as psycho- logical consequences might develop�especially if the guerrillas should succeed in capturing any town sufficiently large for a \"capital\" for the Markos junta. Griswold adds that many Greeks are trying to avoid taking sides in the present struggle, because they fear ultimate Communist domination and desire to be with - 2 - TOP ET � Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 � the winning side, or at least not to have opposed it. For this reason, Griswold doubts that invasion by Soviet or Satellite forces would galvanize Greece into unity as did the Italian in- vasion in 1940. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees that it would now be diffi- cult to unify the Greeks against an attack by the Satellites. The issues are more complicated than in 1940, and the Greeks are now psychologically exhausted. Moreover, even should the Satellites decide to take over Greece by violence, their method would be infiltration�however rapid�rather than a frontal attack which could be recognized and resisted as such.) 6. GERMANY: USSR may close Eastern Zone border--US Political Adviser Murphy reports from Frankfurt that a usually reliable source has advised US intelligence authorities that all gendarme officials from southern and western Thuringia met on 15 March at Soviet instigation and were informed of an alert plan for which they were to prepare immediately. The plan is allegedly to be put into effect when Soviet officials move to abolish the Christian Democratic Union and the Liberal Democratic Party and arrest the parties' leaders. The gendarmes reportedly will reinforce the border police in order to prevent the escape of the political leaders Into the western Zones. (CIA Comment: Although US border detachments have not reported physical evidence of a tightening of the harder, such a Soviet move may be imminent; this step might also be taken in connection with a purge of \"unreliable\" elements from the Social- ist Unity Party The move probably would not foreshadow inter- ( ruption of US, UK, and French traffic with Berlin.) 7. FRANCE: Italians must go home to vote--US Ambassador Caffery repOrts that the French Government has refused to allow Italian diplomatic representatives to distribute ballots for the 18 April elections to the approximately 600,000 Italians resident in France, - 3 - Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Claps/ a though Italian law permits such voting. The French have in- formed the Italian Government that they cannot permit a pro- cedure which amounts to holding Italian elections in France, but they will allow Italian consular authorities to circulate registration cards for use by Italians who may wish to return home to vote. Caffery adds that the French estimate that _several hundred thousand of these Italians would vote Commun- ist if they were given an opportunity to vote in France, but that few would return home to vote. (CIA Comment: While French refusal to permit Italian nationals to vote in France might appreciably reduce the Italian Communist vote, it will give Italian Communists useful propa- ganda against the \"undemocratic\" processes of the western powers.) 8. SPAIN: UK-French view an participation in recovery plan-- US Ambassador Caffery has been reliably informed that Bidault has told the Portuguese Foreign Minister that it is politically impossible for either France or the UK to include Spain in the European recovery program or in the Western European Union at this time. Bidault reportedly added that the Frencti and UK attitude might become much more favorable if the Franco regime gives some outward evidence of democratic evolution. FAR EAST 9. BURMA: Nye� 1,II.g_v_milaagrigia--us Embassy Rangoon reports a complete breach between the Government and almost all Burmese newspapers has developed as a result of recently- imposed Government censorship regulations. Even those which formerly supported the Government now are charging it with fascist tendencies. The Peoples Volunteer Organization (PV0), one of the two principal groups in the Anti-Fascist League (the government party), has invited Burmese Communists and other anti-government groups to meet on 28 March and launch a cam- paign to oust the Socialists from the League and thus from the Government. In addition, more trade unions are threatening to Join Communist-instigated strikes already in progress. - 4 - Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/16/18 006749453 TO ET (CIA Comment: The proposed anti-government meeting under PVO sponsorship will presumably end the uneasy PV0- Socialist cooperation in the Government. The Socialists in the Government control the police and may be expected to resist ejection from the Government by the quasi-military PVO. Armed conflict between these two groups is almost certain. Such a rift between the two strongest non-Communist groups in Burma would greatly increase the possibility of eventual Communist control of Burma.) - - C?oP L RET Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 , Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 sty .

The US deputy remarks that the French and UK delegates are not disposed to make further concessions. The US delegation feels that the US position has not been strengthened by the London discussions and that continuance of these discussions will not be helpful. (CIA Comment: The USSR probably will make further minor compromises as a means of prolonging negotiations and placing the onus of responsibility on the western powers for the eventual breakdown in the treaty negotiations.) Effect of treaty discussions on Austrian Socialists-- The US delegation to the Austrian treaty negotiations reports that Austrian Socialist leaders now in London consider that the Austrian treaty \"must be obtained at any cost\" The Socialists apparently believe that the US does not desire to conclude a treaty at this time., The US delegation observes thatif this Socialist interpretation of the US position is offi- cial, it raises a serious question concerning the possible impact of any break in the London negotiations on the Austrian Socialist Party. (CIA Comment: While the prospect of prolonged quad- ripartite occupation will be discouraging to both major Parties of the Austrian coalition Government, CIA doubts that a break- down in the present treaty discussions, of itself, will precipi- tate a collapse of the coalition. Recommendations to counter possible Soviet action-- US Legation Vienna suggests that, in the event of a breakdown In the London negotiations, the US take the following short-term action to counter possible Soviet moves in eastern Austria: (a) establish promptly a food reserve in Vienna to enable the US to assist the Socialists in retaining control of the trade unions; (b) distribute arms, including automatic weapons, to the Austrian police; and (c) at the close of the negotiations, join with France and the UK in issuing a statement that the TOl S T I3/44 TIA Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 three powers will remain in Austria until a satisfactory treaty is concluded and will meanwhile take all necessary measures to assist Austria to preserve its independence, sovereignty, and unity� (CIA Comment: CIA believes that these measures can effectively check Communist action in eastern Austria, so long as the USSR continues to assume a relatively passive role.) - 3 - Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 el\" Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 2 5 MAR 1948 4 E.

The Embassy believes that: (a) British officials dealing with the Palestine problem personally approve of the new US attitude; but (b) the British Cabinet and politicians are afraid that the British public would react strongly if an attempt were made to keep UK troops in Palestine, even for a short while beyond the announced period. 2.

Griswold points out that the Greek Army is now totally committed, no replacements are available, and the call-up is needed to provide adequate replacements for both the army and the National Defense Corps. Griswold adds that the increase would have sub- stantial morale value \\ among both civilians and the military-- particularly, the Defense Corps where morale is poor, in part because of resentment that younger men without family attach- ments have not been called up. - 2 - TOP SE CO ENT1AL Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 b SEeRET EUROPE 24 MR 1948 642 1, DENMARK: Precautions_talmmainst US Ambassador Marvel reports that the Danes have taken the precautionary measures of cancelling Army and Navy leaves (customarily granted during the five-day Easter holiday) and of alerting the police, because \"there is some Danish thinking\" that the USSR may attempt to take the isles of Laaland and Falster (southeastern part of Denmark). Danish officials have told Marvel that all-out resistance will be offered to such a move. Marvel believes that the likelihood of such Soviet action at present is remote. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees that Soviet seizure of these islands is at present unlikely, The USSR would presum- ably take such a step only as a part of a much larger military operation which appears unlikely during 1948.) 2, SWITZERLAND: Italians to return for A ril elections-- According to US Legation Bern, arrangements have been made for over half of the approximately 100,000 Italians in Switzer- land to return to Italy to vote in the April elections, A great majority of these Italians are expected to vote against the Communists. 3.

FRANCE: �frenothenin of French-Italian border--US A ,sas- sador Caffery has learned from a reliable official that the French intend to strengthen their troops along the French- Italian frontier (until after the Italian elections) and possibly also along the French-Spanish border, in order to forestall possible coordination of a Communist offensive in France with Communist action in northern Italy and Spain. (CIA Comment: In view of the current decrease in � Italian Communist prospects for victory in the April elections, the Communists may launch a surprise insurrection, concen- � trating their efforts in north Italy., Their ability to ma irA in control of that area would depend upon the extent of aid re- ceived from Communists in other countries.) FAR EAST 5, KOREA: New Soviet maneuver en power--US Political Adviser Langdon reports that a /tatter has been received from the Soviet Commander in North Korea,stating that the US has failed to fulfill agreements concerning payments for electric power supplied to Smith Korea by North Korea and therefore: (a) the USS e \"can no longer act as mediator between the US Command and the North Korean People's Committee\" in the matter ,./ supplying power to South Korea; and (b) any further negotiations on this matter must be conducted directly with the People's Committee., Langdon considers the Soviet letter an attempt to expedite payment by the implied threat that the People's Committee will shut off power more readily than the USSR. � (CIA Comment: US inability to meet the difficult Soviet terms concerning method of payment has long been a source of friction in the power negotiations. CIA believes that, In addition to being an attempt to press for a settlement, the Soviet action represents another step toward recognition of the autonomy of the North Korean regime.) - 2 - TOP ET Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 pmenetift�,�..

US-Fttnch-UK policy on Czechoslovakia--The Department of State has suggested to the US delegation to the UN that in handling the Czechoslovak case, the US: (a) should not be the active proponent in making charges against the USSR or In advancing any proposals in the case; (b) should support the establishment of a Security Council investigating com- mission until vetoed by the USSR, while avoiding any open Showdown with the USSR; and (c) should fully exploit the political opportunities of the case, possibly laying the founda- tion for reference to the General Assembly or the \"Little\" Assembly of the general problem of indirect aggression. US Embassy Paris has learned from a Foreign Office official that preliminary French thinking, While favoring full debate on the Czechoslovak case, questions the wisdom of pressing for establishment of an investigating commission. � The French feel that such a move would only bring about another veto by the USSR, thereby again demonstrating the impotence of the UN.

The speech, which has been given wide distribution, apparently has had a markedly heartening effect on the morale cf democratic-minded elements, and it has hardened the will to resist Communist forces in those countries most directly menaced by Soviet- Satellite political and economic penetration. The speech has been widely hailed by democratic leaders as the maximum possible support to the recently establishee Western European Union. This enthusiastic response has in general been accom- panied by expressed hopes of ultimate US military guarantees, in support of the European recovery program and western union, and by a declared recognition that the long-range effectiveness of the President's statements will depend upon the extent to which the US Congress implements his proposals. Non-Commun- ist European spokesmen and press commentators have widely described the speech as a \"final\" or blunt warning to the USSR, but expressions of opinion that the speech may hasten the atIvent of war are outnumbered by expressions of relief that the address did not take the form of an ultimatum and, while firm in tone, avoided provocative language, In some parts of the non-Communist world, the response was tempered or equivocal. Official Chinese reaction is still lacking, but the Chinese press moderated its praise with undis- guised disappointment, and even strong criticism, because the Far East in general and China in particular were not mentioned in the President's message. The initial enthusiastic response by the Government-controlled press in Spain was followed by a semi-official expression of pique at Spain's exclusion from the European recovery program.

With the exception of a 22 March editorial in PRAVDA which may give an indication, the USSR itself does not appear to have laid down its formal propaganda line on the address; this is pre- sumably because the Kremlin customarily takes at least a week to formulate its response to a major foreign pronounce- ment or action. In the meantime, the Soviet press has given little attention to the speech and has relied for comment pre- dominantly on selected reprints of criticism expressed by US or foreign sources. The Soviet and world Communist press has thus made maximuna use of Henry Wallace's attacks on the speech, both as appropriate comment and as indications of division within the US. PRAVDA's lone editorial comment sought to dispose of the speech as primarily election campaign propaganda designed to divert US public attention from the effects of ill-advised internal and foreign policies. The Com- munist press outside the USSR, pending guidance from Moscow, has followed a familiar pattern: (1) by citing the speech as further evidence of US imperialism, war-mongering, and in- terference in the affairs of other nations, and of I e evolution of a police state and capitalist dictatorship in the US; (2) by contrasting Soviet efforts toward demobilization and peace with US militaristic tendencies; and (3) by reiterating standard attacks on US motives and intentions.. An indication of specific significant reactions by areas follows: UK: British reaction, Including that of Foreign Office officials, has been extremely fa.vorable. Foreign Office officials have expressed their \"genuine and hearty approval.\" The re- sponsible press considers that the speech marks an historic milestone in the development of US foreign policy because it 'reflects a US decision that military support is necessary to bolster economic aid abroad; the prevailing belief is that, if the President's recommendations are implemented, international Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Communism can be e .ectively contained. An undercurrent of anxiety lest the speech increase general tension is over- shadowed by an. overwhelming reaction of relief that the US appears to be moving to support its foreign economic program with military guarantees. THE DOMINIONS: Official reaction is largely lacking. Other reaction, however, has been favorable in Canada and New Zealand, though mixed in Australia. The Australian press considers the US to be in a state of \"war jitters.\" SCANDINAVIA: Official reaction is lacking; indica- tions are, however, that it is generally favorable. The Swedish Foreign Minister, however, still appears to cling to his deep-set confidence in a policy of strict neutrality. EUROPE: In non-Communist official circles, the re- sponse has generally ranged from favorable to enthusiastic. One exception is in Spain where semi-official expressions of pique at Spain's exclusion from the European recovery program followed praise which was initially expressed by the government- controlled press. The Foreign Ministers of France, the Benelux countries, and Austria have warmly approved the address and expressed the belief that it will give new courage to anti-Com- munists everywhere. French reaction was also marked by relief that the message was couched in non-provocative terms and by some expressions of official concern lest US public and Congressional reaction should be unfavorable and tend to dis- illusion those Frenchmen who have been heartened by the address. This concern also has found expression in Austria. In Finland and Trieste the speech has reportedly resulted in a marked bolstering of the will to resist among anti-Communists. The Finns may thereby be emboldened to turn down Soviet proposals for any alliance except a conventional friendship pact, In Trieste, however, some concern has been expressed that the speech came \"too late,\" will \"bring war closer,\" and may cause a Communist resort to violence or lead to Yugoslav occupation of the area, Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 ttPk'�' CO NEAR EAST: The speech to Congress was given ex- tensive coverage and in most instances was received very favorably. The general Arab reaction to the speech is not yet known. The most enthusiastic reception was evidenced In Greece and Turkey. President Inonu of Turkey praised the speech as \"the only language the USSR would understand.\" The Greek press generally interpreted the speech as evidence of a new and firmer US policy, but some fear was expressed that war may have been brought closer, FAR EAST: Although official comment is still lacking, the principal significant Chinese reaction has been expressed regret that the President failed to mention the Far East. Praise for the address thus has been tempered by disappointment and even by predictions that a policy of 'Europe first\" will lead to catastrophe. President Roxas of the Philippines has given his strong personal support to the speech. LATIN AMERICA: Reports of reaction have so far been received from 8 of the 20 Republics, indicating favorable response from all groups except the Communists.

PAKISTAN: Alarm over tribal situation in Kashmir--US Ambassador Ailing in Karachi reportsa i-Wn recently characterized the Kashmir tribal situation as \"a million times more dangerous\" than it was a few months ago. Ailing is convinced that any plan for solving the Kashmir dispute which does not have both the appearance and sub- stance of providing a strictly impartial plebiscite under neutral control is almost certain to make matters worse. Ailing believes that if a plan providing these elements is offered, the Government of Pakistan can with good hope of success prevail upon the tribesmen and Kashmiris to cease fighting. General Bucher (the British Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army) has concurrently expressed to US Am- bassador Grady in New Delhi the belief that Pakistan is fearful lest the 80,000 tribal raiders (only 12,000 of whom are actually in Kashmir) might turn against Pakistan after having exhausted the possibilities of obtaining loot in Kash- mir, thus causing the breakdown of public order in West Punjab (Pakistan). According to Grady, Bucher himself believes that the tribesmen cannot pillage additional terri- tory in Kashmir without suffering heavy losses from the Indian troops and may therefore move south into the East Punjab (India) for further looting.

However the Embassy considers that some Gov- ernment reorganization in the near future is probable and be- lieves that this will result in more effective leadership and more positive policies than now exist. (CYA Comment: CIA believes that Chiang is probably capable of overcoming the reported internal opposition and will remain in power at the present time, but in so doing will have to make adjustments with various factions within the Kuomintang. These maneuvers may take place at the current meetings of the Partys Central Executive Committee currently In session. However, CIA believes that any change in the compositlot of the present Government, directed toward either eliminating Chiang or reducing his influence, would weaken Nationalist will to continue fighting the Communists and would increase Nationalist tendencies to seek a compromise political solution of the civil war.) -3 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 Approved for Release: 2018/10/18 006749453 � .

The US delegation indicates that, in order to help Hatta work out the complex problem of demobilizing over 200,000 Republican troops within a time limit acceptable to the Dutch, it proposes to adopt the following plans: (a) secure at least a token Dutch demobilization at once and give it wide publicity; (b) widen demilitarized zones wherever possible; (c) offer Premier Hatta, if both parties approve, the services of a US military adviser., (CIA Comment: The reduction and merger of Dutch and Republican forces was the issue over which negotiations collapsed In July 1947. An agreement on this matter, even if only \"in principle,\" represents a significant advance toward the restora- tion of peace in Indonesia.
