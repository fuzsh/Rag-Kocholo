This measure will certainly give rise- to polemics and -opposition. The Association of tenants of Trieste and Venezia Giulia have already submitted memorondum to AMC- containing two very-interesting questions. The first concerns the houseowners' risht to double the rent in cases where he himself only OCCUP?-qiii one 'flat; the second proposes that all controversies should be brought beforo a 1.:agistrote. The above-mentioned Association protests against the proposed eXtension of'thesc measures to Tricto,1 stressing that (in the first case) it would cause hardship to poorer people and (in the second case) that the present method of mediation by thc Rent Claims Office ( instituted in 1 950 by Ai K1-1 a Order 175) is quite satisfactory.

In point of fact Triestine inrodentism sprang from the bourthaisie t the time of the Risorgimento when this beurgodgo was the only bulwark ainst Habsburg-controlled finance and big business. The cry \"Italy\" which snald.be heard everywhere in Venezia Giulia after the bleak May days of 1945 was something more than the desire of the nepulation for reunion with the motherland it was a desperate cry for freedom dictated by the instinct for physical survival. The exodus from POIa and the ether Istrian towns as the- result of a dire necessity: one does net decide to roam the world Unless. driven by deadly danger. Just as absurd as its definition of irredentism are \"Corriere's remarks about la and Italian capitalism. Fascism or no fascism, Italian industry, in the throes of 'a huge economic crisis, had to be saved at all costs, even by state help, and, if need bp, by the expropriation of private capitalists. Esd IRS not taken in hand Trieste's:disorganised and impoverished industries and Shipping in 1933, their- collapse would have been inevitable. Trieste's ships and shipyards could not be sold under the hammer, they had to continue work in order to provide occupation and bread for thousands. So the shareholders lost their meneyvbut the public nterest was saved, and by. fitting our merehant marine into thenntianal-framework, its efficiency was greatly and effectively increased. . It is a deliberate exaggeration to say thatTrieste's shipping interests were sacrificed to those of otherItalian ports, as a comparison of Trieste's and Genoa's sailing lists of 1938 clearly shows. Our shipyards and furnaces became part of the newly- Created FTT.. But how could they axist without Italian =missions and the vast Italian market? It is a significant fact thnt when the recanversion of the IRI enterprises into private firms was suggested, the Italian heavy and engineering industries Showed not the slightest eagerness to embank upon the venture.

Cold terrorism (editorial) A &Alice at Trkstois political and economic history of the past fifty years reveals the roasons why this port has for the time being lost its original function which it so brilliantly performed under the Austrian regimo. At one time all comm;mcial inerests is Trios-to were resolutely opposed to annexation by Italy; but din'etly aftor the collapse of the Austrian empire they changed sides with the agility of smart businossmen, and took an active part in the finauoing and support of fascism. Approved For Release 2001/12/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010600200001-0 Approved For Release 2001/12/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R010600200001-0 In 1933 Mussolini founded the ira (Institute for Industrial Reoonstruotioi. which on the pretext of nationalising the major Italian industries made them subservient to the fascist interests. The industrial leaders then in power were not eliminated but assigned to posts of command inside the new structure. Soon the deep contrast between Trieste's natural function and Italian capitalist .policy became painfully clear. Genoa, Naples, and Venice claimed and obtained economic priority over Trieste. Spozndic meek attempts DTI de by Triestine merchants and shippers to oppose this trend were of no avail; they had no choice but to follow suit. It was a process which step by step turned :the exponents of Trieste's economy . into adversaries of Trieste, bent on dismantling the economic armoury of their own city, with the result ? that all our representetive industnial plants gradually passed into the ownership of the IRI and its affiliations. At present the Fiadder which controls nearly all Italian metal worte 'possesses 75 per cent of the sham capital of the Ilva Couroany. The Vinmare entirely owns Lloyd Triestine and does its best to switch Trieste's traditional shipping lines to -America and the Levant over to the large Italian ports. There is not one big banking institute in Italy, the Bence Commerciale Italiana included, that is not under direct IR' control. These larvelopments, backed, either voluntarily or under compulsion, the industrial loaders of Trieste, find their political expression in rrodontista as the only means by which these people can, hope to retain their dominant position and influence. Of eoursc, they cannot afford to state plainly and crudely the motives underlying their longing for reincorporation; so they make a great fuss about ideological and national arguments, flags, and s entiment e, invoking racial incompatibility, shedding tears and fabricat- ing myths. Those who refuse to be impreseed by those histrionic tricks, are boycotted and subjected to a system of morel isolation and persecution in the form of press attacks, cartoons in comic papers, libel and politicel smear which can best be described as \"cold terrorism\". There . era:, however, forces in Trieste able and determined to resist this drive. They are rallied around the banner of the Independentist Mavement which not only aspires to act as a mouthpiece for the universal diacontent over the present state of affairs but is engaged in coebating it also in the economic field which is the all-important background against which ti-p present etruggle is being waged. Indepandontism is, in this some, a social movement as it strives to restore Trieste 's. rateral economic functions., to wrench its productive potentlel from the claws of selfish monopolists and to denonstrate the perfect viability of an economically independent F.T.T. At the same time it endeavours to warn the governing powers in Trieste against the dangers in- volved:. by their protection of industrial irredentism and the consequent attraction exorcised on the local political forces by the extremist right-and- left-wing currents* .Independentism is a political middle-way. movement, averse to fanaticisn and biassed against no one. It is neither anti-Italian nor enti-Slav and, least of all, arti-Triestine and coapletely inmene. to \"cold eerrorism\". -a- Citizen's defence (editorial) This editorial is written in connection with the so-called \"Egidi case\". neidi is an Italian who was accused of murdering a young girl in the outskirts ,..47 Rome. The accusation was based on his confession totho wine during the investigation by the home Police. But once in front of the Magistrate, he re tracted everything, declaring that he admitted the crime only be Call so badly tortured during the first police interrogation. Iie was discharged by the Court because of insufficient proof, and his case, subsequently brought to the attention of the Italian Parliament, is becoming a public scandal in Italy.

For this I am accused of breaking My oath of fidelity to the FTI\". \"Tob truthful I never considered I had sworn an oath to the PTT, a territory which was never juridically constituted., and not entitled permanently to fly the sacred flag of San Giusto from the City Hall\". I did swear to respect the Italian laws which are still in force in this territory, as well as the emergency trorisions issued by the authorities of occupation, but I challenge anyone to prove that on the basis of those. laws and regulations the Mayor of Trieste is obliged continuously to fly the flag from the balconies of the City Hall\". \"I was right to pro, est against the illegal use of the City's flag by certain bodies and private offices, which expropriated this flag and transformed, it into a coat-of*-arms of a never constituted lilree Territory.

(editorial by Diego de Castro) Last week. Dc Gasperi received the new Yugoslav ambassador Velebit who presented his credentials. The ovill was a strictly formal one and no rofer(zice to the problem of Trieste is likely to have been made at that interview. ? Therefore the general interest at the moment focusses on the person 'of ambassador Velobit hitself who is one of the most outstanding figures in Yugoslav public life. In the recent war ha was charged by Tito with the very delicate task of acting as liaison officer, as it were, between the Germans and the partisans. Residing in Zagreb during the German occupation, he conCerned himself with the xchange of prisoners of war and by order of Stalin and on behalf of Tito, offered the German enerei Glaise not only a truce but also partisan help for an attack on the Anglo-Americans should they at t enT t a landing in Istria. Th c story o: tot i abrupt switch-over. re inind s me of a re cent pamphlet published jointly by Christopher Mayhew, and secretary Zor Foreim Affair under Bevin, and his wife ? Coolly who was one of the first women omployod in the British diplomatic service. This pamphlet is entitled: nhat is Titoism?\" In perusing it the Italian reader feels inclined to ?::)eoulate on whether the passing of government from Labour into Conservative hands should be ntad as a good or evil event. Pamphlets of this kind. are terribly dangerous as they serve the purpose of making the Lain points of Yugoslav propaganda, collected at. their source in Belgrade, palatable toWestern mentality. It was in Belgrade that Mrs, Cecily Mayhew was for some turn employed as a staff member of the British Embassy soon after 194.9 vihen the Anglo-Saxons has already begun to view Tito and his regime through the rose-coloured lenses of optimism. The way in which the Mayhew pamphlet is written, is perfectly suited to influence the ;judgement of the average British or American reader as it openly, although in the mildest of terms, criticises the Yugoslav government; hinting, for example, at jails in full operation and at press and political freedom as aims yet to be achieved, but it takes good care to add that this lack of freedom is a great. deal more human and tolerable than in any other communist-ruled country.

This touch of romanticism and solf-sacrificing horoism raisos Yugoslavia's resistance to Moscow almost to the glories of a myth, comparablo to our Risorgimonto, only that the Balkan jails are a good deal 11102.\"J torriblo than Silvio Pellico's priSonlond cominformist executions much moro cruel and. cynical than thio -,Ihich disgraced the name of Radotzky.

And the+ cas is furthor ageecavated by the fact that a British foreign secretary and a woman who belonged. to the diplomatic corps are its anthors. Tho pamphlet reflocte faithfully the Labour mentality in regard to Tito. 17o are far from suspecting Mr. and Mrs. Mayhew of had faith, but we cannot help- seeing in their work the area) naive and fallacious confidence with which the past Labour regime hoped to convert a communist dictator of the Balkan variety to the icieftls of honest and lo.yel. socialism. It is rumourod: that it was- the British who oncouragod Tito to continue his idoo- logical campaign against Moscow. Tito, unwilling woutonly to provoke his groat enemy, hesitated to obey. But from the Mayhew pamphlet omoogos unmistakably the dosixo of its authors for the ideological triumph of Titoist socialism and its gradual approach to tho Western socialist doctrine. They try to domonstrate with a welter of. arguments that Tito's and Stalin's communist theorios are entirely different in essence. These oxortions are as sterile and preposterous as in the middle ages were the heatod discussions about the sex of the angels. Hard and merciless facts have nothing to dd with lofty theories and ideological daydreams: The now Conservative Government, headed by the ingenious sceptic Churchill, should resolutely drop all pretence of supporting Tito for ideological motives, and confess frankly that it does no for reasons of military and political convopience. It is an open question, however, whe- ther Churchill will not try to take., his rovengo on Stalin for the loss of British erostigo in Yug)slavia during the war by attempting to enhance: this prestige through concessions to the Yugoslav government.

Any objection which all citizens are entitled to make before the Court of Appeal, must be submitted ithin 20 days after the notification or within 30 days after the publication of the corrected lists. Taking all this into account the most convenient date for the elections to be hold would be after May 31st of any year in order to give everyone an opportunity to lodge their claims or protests against exclusion from the ,Aectoral lists. .If, on the other hand, the elections were held at an earlier dAe, e.g. on the 10th or 20th of April, the Pro-electoral tasks would coincide 1,vith the annual revisions of the cacatoral lists, thus causing tremendous onf us ion.
