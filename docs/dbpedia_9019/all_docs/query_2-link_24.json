One Triestine lira was equivalent to 3 Italian lira, the symbol of the Triestine lira was Â£ also known as the Pound Sign. For the areas under the administration of the Yugoslav Army, which still formally belonged to Italy (Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste), the Economic Bank for Istria, Rijeka and the Slovenian Littoral in October 1945 printed special occupation money with a value expressed in lira. Ten Liras were worth one Yugoslav dinar.\n\nThe banknotes were printed in Ljubljana and Zagreb, in nine denominations from 1 to 1,000 lira, and were withdrawn from circulation in September 1947 when they were replaced by Yugoslav dinar banknotes.\n\nReferences[edit]"
