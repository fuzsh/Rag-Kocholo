        "text": "13\n\nCOMPETING MONEYS AND VENICE’S FIRST BIMETALLIC STANDARD\n\nAFTER BEING ON A SILVER STANDARD for centuries, Venice shifted to a bimetallic standard, or rather to a series of bimetallic standards, as the use of gold increased. Some shifts occurred in usage independently of their legal formulation, just as in England the shift from a silver to a gold standard during the eighteenth century occurred in practice before it was recognized in legislation.1 In Venice, however, as in Florence, the simultaneous use of several different monetary standards—reflected in the simultaneous use of several moneys of account, each linked to a different coin—interfered with any complete transition from a silver to a gold standard during the fourteenth century. At the same time, efforts to unify Venice’s monetary system with a bimetallic standard were complicated by Venice’s position as a central bullion market.\n\ni. SILVER AND BILLON COINS CIRCULATING WITHIN VENICE\n\nBack before Venice began minting gold, it had a different kind of bimetallic problem, a problem arising from treating as legal tender both the grosso which was 96 percent silver and the piccolo which was 75 percent copper and only 25 percent silver as coined by Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo (1268–75). In his day, Venice may for a time have had two standards of exchange value, one based on the billon piccolo, the other on the silver grosso, but they were tied together into a single standard after 1282, when the exchange was maintained at the rate of 32 lire di piccoli for 1 lira di grossi.2\n\nThat standard was bimetallic in that it was based on the use of the two metals copper and silver, and like any bimetallic standard, it was potentially unstable. Its stability was threatened by any substantial variation in the market value of the two coins. The market value was determined mainly by the metal they contained but partly by the labor they embodied and by the level of demand relative to the quantity minted.\n\nThe metallic content of both coins remained substantially unchanged for many decades after 1282. According to the minting regulations, a freshly coined grosso contained 36 times as much silver as a piccolo, even though the piccolo was accepted in exchange at its legal value, which was 1/32 that of the grosso. About half of the difference between the legal and metallic values (between 1/36 and 1/32) can be attributed to the higher cost of manufacturing piccoli. For grossi the cost of manufacture was roughly 2 percent of the value of the product, while for piccoli it was roughly 8 percent. The 6 percentage points of difference were enough to raise from 1/32 to 1/34 the comparative value of the piccolo. As explained in our introductory discussion of metallic equivalents of moneys of account, 1/34 can be called the relative “cost value” of the piccolo—a valuation including not only its silver value but also the value of the added labor required to manufacture the smaller coin.3\n\nThe other half of the difference between the silver value and the legal value can be attributed to seigniorage, or potential seigniorage. It was a profit that the government could collect so long as it used its monopoly of coinage to restrict the amount available to such an extent that the coins had scarcity value. The utility of having small coins for small purchases and making change gave the piccoli an exchange value higher than their cost value so long as the supply of piccoli was limited. If great quantities of piccoli had been minted, they would no longer have been accepted as worth 1/32 of a grosso. Grossi would have commanded a premium, or piccoli would have functioned as “bad money” according to Gresham’s law. Grossi as “good money” would have been driven into hoards or into export. In 1282, any such undermining of the circulation of the grosso in Venice and its dominance as the standard of value had been prevented by the restrictions placed on the coinage of piccoli under the successor to Lorenzo Tiepolo and continued under Giovanni Dandolo (1280–89).4 Thereafter, as long as the number of piccoli in circulation did not exceed the need for coins of that denomination, the utility-scarcity value of the piccoli, added to their full cost value, gave them an exchange value equal to their legal value, and Venice’s billon coinage acted jointly with its fine silver coinage in supporting a single monetary standard.\n\nVenice’s main monetary problem under Giovanni Dandolo was well characterized by Roberto Cessi as “the defense of the grosso.”5 A unified stable monetary standard depended on maintaining the use and prestige of the grosso against two threats. One came from the increased use of the new type of gold coin minted by Florence and Genoa, an innovation that was accompanied by a fall in the value of silver compared with that of gold. Under Giovanni Dandolo, Venice tried to parry that threat by issuing its gold ducat in 1284–85 on terms that would enhance the relative value of the silver grosso, as will be explained below, in section iv.\n\nA second threat came from the other side, from the circulation of billon or silver coins containing much less silver than the grosso but winning acceptance within Venice at more than their intrinsic value. The restrictions placed on the minting of piccoli by the mint statutes of about 1278, reinforced probably by the reluctance of both craftsmen and officials of the mint to turn out the small coin of low value which required more work for less return, led to the production of even fewer than were needed. Before the end of the dogeship of Giovanni Dandolo, special instructions were given to the mintmasters to produce more piccoli, and in 1291 the restrictions were treated as obsolete. By that date, a shortage of piccoli had opened the way for an influx of billon and silver coins of foreign manufacture which was causing alarm.\n\nThe lack of any general prohibition against the use of foreign coin favored this influx. Products of the imperial mint at Verona were still generally accepted in Venice even by government officials,6 and other nearby mints increased their output in the last quarter of the thirteenth century. Silver mines in the upper valley of the Adige became very productive, and both pennies and groats from the mint of the count of Tyrol at Merano were widely diffused in Italy between 1270 and 1306. Many bore the imperial eagle and were sometimes referred to as aquilini. Weighing 1.6 grams and, if they were like earlier issues at Verona, 0.956 fine, these groats were intermediate in value between Venetian piccoli and Venetian grossi. The Tyrolese issues were called “Kreuzer” in German-speaking lands, where they also circulated widely, and sometimes “de croce” in Italy. From their values in money of account both Tyrolese and Veronese groats were named “pieces of xx” or “pieces of xxii” (“vigintiarii” or “denarii a vigintiduobus”).7 Among coins being imported by Germans in 1277, along with florins and groats in general, pennies from Tyrol and pieces of xx (“Zwanziger”) are mentioned specifically. They were subjected to a tax of 5 percent (revised in 1332). The tax may have been meant to discourage the importation of coin instead of bullion but certainly did not forbid it.8 In the 1320s a Venetian notary recorded that many payments of lire di grossi were made in “pieces of xx,”9 although they could not be used to pay debts to the Commune.10\n\nGROAT OF TYROL, TYPE 1\n\nCoined at Merano by Count Mainardo II (1259–ca. 1274), these groats were valued at Venice legally at 20 or 22 piccoli.\n\nObv.: + :COMES:TIROL: Eagle with wings spread, facing right.\n\nRev.: .DE.

Museo Bottacin, inv. no. 2 (CNI, 6:98, no. 50.)\n\nLess-esteemed silver coins came to Venice from the other direction when new silver mines were opened in the Balkans. Saxon miners driven from Transylvania by Mongol raids in the 1240s developed a rich find at Brescoa (Brskovo), east of Ragusa. Much of its product was brought to Venice, mainly by Ragusans. Some came as tableware or jewelry, and some was welcomed as bullion, but when it came as coin, it took forms that were not welcomed. A mint at Brescoa of the king of Rascia (Serbia) by 1276 was turning out groats that so closely resembled Venetian grossi that the Venetians called them counterfeits. Although they bore the name of the Serbian king, their design and weight made it easy to confuse them with the issues of the Venetian mint. Serbian groats and similar coins from Bosnian mines and mints penetrated other cities of northern Italy, as well as Venice, Dalmatia, parts of Greece, and many interior Balkan valleys where little money had previously circulated.11 By 1282 they were circulating in Venice to an alarming extent, and the Great Council forbade their use. All Venetian officials, including those overseas, except the counts in Ragusa, where they continued to circulate, were ordered to be on the lookout for them, to cut them up, and to turn the scrap coin in to the mint. All moneychangers and their “boys over twelve years of age” were required to take an oath to do the same. But the penalty on Venetians for possessing the Rascian groats was relatively light: only 1/10 of the forbidden coin would be taken without compensation; the rest would be paid for as bullion.12 Probably as effective in reducing their importation was the reduction in that same year of the mint charges on the coinage of piccoli from 24 percent to 13 percent, a reduction that gave some encouragement to importing bullion rather than coin, although the low mint charge on grossi, about 2.1 percent, was more important for that purpose.13 But the intrusion of groats from Serbia and Bosnia continued, and the ban on their use was reiterated by the Great Council in 1290 with more severe penalties, including confiscation of 50 percent of any that had been bought by a moneychanger.14 The doge, the Ducal Council, and the Quarantia followed this up in 1291 with orders that four tables be set up at the Rialto where everyone who had imported such money should turn it in to be paid for as bullion.15\n\nGROAT OF TYROL, TYPE 2\n\nIssued in great quantity by Count Mainardo and his sons (1274–1310), these aquilini, so called because of the eagle pictured on the reverse, circulated very extensively at Venice.\n\nObv.: ME IN AR DV’ Long cross with a short cross superimposed.\n\nRev.: + COMES TIROL Eagle with wings spread, facing left.\n\nAR, 21.8 mm, 1.543 gr. Museo Bottacin, inv. no. 6. (CNI, 6: 102, no. 12.)\n\nA more tolerant attitude was adopted a few years later. A decree of 1294 stipulated that the Serbian groats would be paid for at the rate previously established in valuing certified sterling bars—225 soldi per mark.16 Doing so implied that the Serbian groats were also 0.925 fine. Although they were supposed to be turned in within fifteen days, they might be accepted after fifteen days as a means of payment, provided they were valued at only 28 denari. Whoever accepted them was ordered to take them to the mint within eight days; if he did not—and was caught—he lost only 3 piccoli per groat. In effect that permitted them to circulate at 25 piccoli. In 1299, when their circulation was similarly made legal, but at 24 piccoli, mintmasters were instructed to check every month to see whether their intrinsic value had diminished. The change was made, the law declared, perhaps having in mind the teenage boys referred to earlier, so that fewer souls would be endangered by perjury.17 In short, the Great Council became reconciled to letting these groats circulate at their intrinsic value, which was about 25 percent less than that of the grossi, while still requiring customs officials to send all they received to the mint for recoinage.\n\nThe extent to which the Serbian groats resembled the Venetian grossi without maintaining the same standard gained for king Stefan Uros II Milutin (1282–1321) the reputation—held also by his contemporary Philip the Fair of France—of being a counterfeiter, as reflected in Dante’s lines:\n\n“quel di Rascia\n\nChe male ha visto il conio di Vinegia.”\n\n(Paradiso, XIX. 140–41)\n\nIf the king of Rascia (Serbia) deserved Dante’s condemnation, it was not simply because the groats he coined resembled those of Venice. In fact, his coins bore letters and features that deliberately distinguished them from the Venetian coins.18 The Venetian decree of 1282 referred to them as “contrafactos,” to be sure, but that is not the only case in which competing coins were given that bad name simply because of their resemblance and ability to compete with a previously established home product.19 Such competitors should be distinguished from real counterfeits, that is, coins that pretended by false insignia to contain far more fine metal than they really did. The first issues of the king of Rascia were of about the same weight as the Venetian grossi and had a high silver content. They are an example of the kind of coin used in the well-studied monetary wars of the Netherlands, similar enough to those of the country into which they were introduced to be accepted but inferior enough to make profits for the mint from which they came. Presumably it was later issues, lighter and with a higher percentage of copper, that earned for the Serbian king his fame as a counterfeiter.20\n\nThe situation in Bologna in 1305 shows the extent to which the Rascian coinage had driven out Venetian grossi and could at about that date have inspired Dante’s lines. Bologna itself minted groats smaller than the Venetian, but the Venetian grossi were so well known in Bologna that when the Serbian groats of the same size as the Venetian first began to be used, the Bolognese called the Serbian coins “veneziani di Rassi.” By 1305 they were the most common coin in use. Their deterioration led to a motion to reduce immediately their legal value from 20 Bolognese denari piccoli to 19 and, after two months, to a motion to ban them completely. That motion was defeated; apparently the city councillors had too many old Rascian groats on hand to be willing to vote a reduction in their value. Instead they voted to distinguish between the new Rascian groats, some of which, the resolution said, were worth only 12, 16, or 18 denarii bononini, and the old issue, which should still be accepted as worth 20 denarii. Vigorous inquests then identified and obtained from a handful of moneychangers—half of them foreigners—confessions that they had indeed imported and passed off as worth 30 to a florin Rascian groats that they had obtained at more than 41 for a florin. But on a promise from Bolognese moneychangers that within the next four months they would have coined 60,000 lire of good Bolognese groats, inquests and prosecutions stopped.21\n\nGROSSO OF RASCIA\n\nOne of the imitations of the Venetian grosso issued by the king of Rascia (Serbia) Uros II Milutin (1274–1321).\n\nObv.: VROSIVS REX SSTEFANVS St. Stephen hands the banner to the king; both face front.\n\nRev.: Christ enthroned, flanked by IC XC.\n\nAR, 19.9 mm, 1.991 gr. Museo Bottacin, inv. dupl. no. 4295.\n\nWhile concern with invasion by Serbian groats was at its height in Bologna, it was waning in Venice. The office that had been created to suppress the Rascian grossi was charged in 1304 with inspecting the loading and armament of privately owned merchant galleys, an assignment that suggests that that office was no longer sufficiently occupied by its earlier assignment.22 But Communal offices were still under orders to melt down all the Rascian groats they received, and the Ternaria, the customs office that handled hides, cheeses, and other products imported largely from or through Dalmatia, came into the possession of so many that it itself was authorized to melt down the coins that it confiscated or collected.23 Such destruction of foreign coins was unusual; generally coins from foreign mints were allowed to circulate at their market value, although efforts were made to limit their use.24\n\nIn the effort to meet the competition of foreign coins within Venice, any reduction in the silver content of the Venetian grosso is noteworthy by its absence. The foreign groats would not have had Gresham’s law operating in their favor if the Venetian grossi had been debased to be as “bad” as their competitors. That would have helped to maintain the circulation within Venice of its own grossi, but it would have hurt the use of the grossi in Venice’s eastern markets, where the grosso had become a sort of international standard of value. Its acceptability facilitated Venetian purchases of raw materials and of eastern products for sale to western Europe and gave the Venetians good reason to keep high the reputation of the grosso by keeping its fineness and weight unchanged. When groats of less intrinsic value began coming in from Balkan mints, any temptation to drive out this “bad money” by lowering the silver content of the grosso, and thus making it no longer so vulnerably “good,” must have been checked by the desire to keep the grosso at a high rate of exchange.\n\nii. BIMETALLISM IN OVERSEAS TRADE\n\nAlthough some usages apply the term “bimetallism” to any monetary system in which two metals are legal tender, according to strict definitions it is a contradiction in terms to speak of international bimetallism. Webster’s definition assumes a single standard of value, not a number of independent standards such as those of different nations. But an international monetary system may be said to have had a single standard approximately when one money was widely used in settling trade balances and evaluating reserves (as was the English pound before World War I or the American dollar after World War II). If the coin that in this way served as an international standard equaled both a fixed amount of gold and a fixed amount of silver, or if two national currencies, one based on gold and the other on silver, maintained the same relative value for a considerable period of time, one may say that there was for that period and that area a kind of international bimetallic system.\n\nIn the Mediterranean world in which Venice’s trade developed, the Byzantine nomisma (earlier called the solidus and later the hyperpyron or perpero) came closest to dominating an international monetary system. Although the original nomismata were almost pure gold, the later perperi were a varying mixture of gold and silver, as explained above, in chapter 8. It may be viewed as being for a time an example of what is called symmetallism, that is, a standard of value based on a combination of both gold and silver in one coin or one ingot in fixed proportions. Once the Byzantine emperors had begun increasing the amount of silver, the proportions of the two metals did not stay fixed. Moreover, the value of the gold in a perpero was far greater that the value of the silver, so that changes in its value depended mainly on the changes in its gold content.\n\nDuring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries silver coins circulated increasingly not only in the Byzantine Empire but in the Moslem states that had been issuing coins imitating those of the Byzantine emperors. Silver coins were used to pay prices and settle contracts that had been stated in the moneys of account based on perperi or other gold coins. In the course of time, moneys of account that had originally been identified with gold coins shifted their base to silver coins or became payable in coins that were partly gold and partly silver. During the transition, much of the international trade of the eastern Mediterranean may be said to have used a nebulous kind of bimetallism.\n\nA crucial role in the transition from gold to silver was played by the Venetian grosso, especially by its relations to the perpero during the thirteenth century. In the whole area that Venice came to dominate as a result of the Fourth Crusade, the coins issued by the Comneni had been in general use and had determined existing standards of value. The Comneni hyperpyron, or perpero, was of the traditional weight, 4.4 grams, but contained enough silver and copper mixed with its gold that its value was about 7/8 that of the traditional gold coin. This Comnenian perpero became the basis of the most-used Byzantine money of account, the perpero, divided into 12 milieresia or 24 carats as units of account. When Enrico Dandolo coined the grosso and it was accepted as worth 26 denarii ven., 18 1/2 grossi sufficed to pay 1 perpero at the traditional rate of exchange in Venice, according to which 1 perpero was worth 40 soldi ven. At that rate of exchange, 1 gram of coined gold was considered to be worth a little more than 10 grams of coined silver.25\n\nFrom 10 to 1 about 1200, the bimetallic ratio fell, and the value of the perpero fell accordingly. In Genoa and Florence at the time of the coinage of the gold genovino and florin in 1252, gold was considered little more than 8.5 times as valuable as silver,26 and there is some reason to believe that gold fell to an even lower value in some places in the Levant in that decade.27\n\nThe valuation set on perperi was affected by the overthrow of the Byzantine Empire through the Fourth Crusade, which the coinage of the Venetian grosso had helped to finance, and by the subsequent political confusion. One result was the contemporaneous existence of many kinds of perperi. Whether the Latin emperors at Constantinople coined perperi is debated. No specimens have been found; yet surviving documents contain passages that seem to refer to them.28 Perperi certainly were coined by the Greek rulers at Nicaea, who claimed to be the legitimate successors of the Byzantine emperors. Those issued when the Nicaean Greek emperors regained Constantinople, which continued to be minted by the triumphant Michael Palaeologus, contained only about 16 carats of gold.29\n\nMeanwhile, in many regions that had once been part of the Byzantine Empire, the perpero as a money of account became based on the Venetian grosso rather than on the coins issued by Byzantine emperors. In this connection two different perperi can be clearly distinguished as moneys of account. That based on the Comnenian perpero became known as the “good old perpero.” Since it had been worth 40 soldi at Venice, a perpero paid in grossi was worth 18 1/2 grossi. Even after 1204, good old perperi are often quoted at 40 soldi.30 Some lower quotations may also refer to Comnenian gold perperi coins or a money of account based on them. Such perperi declined in value when gold became worth less than 10 times as much as silver,31 but good old perperi were mainly equated with 40 soldi a grossi and with 18 1/2 silver grossi.\n\nA second kind of perpero important as a money of account was the “current perpero,” worth about 26 soldi a grossi or 12 grossi coins.32 It was derived from perperi coins issued by Michael Palaeologus. Since these coins were only 16/24 gold, there was just about 8.6 times as much silver in 12 grossi as there was gold in 1 Palaeologian perpero (12 × 2.1 = [16/24] × 4.4 × 8.6). After allowing for the silver in these perperi which were 2/3 gold, the equating of 1 Palaeologian perpero with 12 grossi implies a bimetallic ratio as low as 8.16,33 but some Palaeologian perperi contained less than 16 carats of gold.34 Since in money of account 12 grossi coins equaled 26 soldi, the current perpero was rated in exchange at about 26 soldi.35\n\nThe subdivision of the perpero in Byzantine money of account was the miliaresion, of which 12 equaled 1 perpero; it could be considered materialized in the grosso when the perpero equaled 12 grossi.36 The equivalence of 1 perpero with 12 grossi seems indeed to have become firmly established in Crete about 1250, when Venetian power in Romania was at its height and before Genoa and Florence had spread the use of their new gold coins. That was the period in which the grosso was a prevalent means of payment, and gold reached its low near 8.5 to 1. With that bimetallic ratio, the “current perpero” as a money of account could be based on both the Palaeologian perpero coin and 12 Venetian grossi coins.\n\nIn Syria and other parts of Islam, the Arab conquerors had issued gold or electrum coins called “dinars,” which were similar in weight and equal in fineness to the gold coins of the Byzantine emperors. In the kingdoms established by the Christian Crusaders—regions called “Oltremare” in Venice, just as in England they were referred to as “Beyond-the-Sea”—the rulers also issued silver or billon pennies and groats of the type with which the French nobles were familiar, but their gold coins were similar to the Arab dinars. They became known at Venice as “saracen bezants” (“bisanti saracenati”) or simply “saracenati.” Many of these bezants came from the mints at Tyre and Acre, which were managed for local princes by Venetian entrepreneurs. Their gold content, like that of the perperi, was diminished. Those minted at Acre at the time of St. Louis were of 18 carats.37 After the fall of Acre, the last Christian stronghold in Palestine, saracenati circulated extensively in Cyprus, which was still ruled by the French nobles established there during the Third Crusade. The saracenati were reckoned as equal to 3 1/2 of a later Cypriot type of bezant called a “white bezant” (“bezante biancho”), which was more than 1/2 silver, a little less than 1/6 gold, the rest copper. The saracenati were also equated with 7 groats of a type derived from those coined in France and called “tornesi grossi.”38 While saracenati as coins were generally considered gold, saracenati as units of account were beginning to be paid at established rates in coins that were largely or entirely silver.\n\nThus both in Romania and in the Crusader states, the basic money of account was derived from a gold coin but was coming to be used more and more for accounts settled in silver coins at traditional rates. Even the gold coins were about 1/3 silver. As a whole, the Levantine moneys embodied a nebulous kind of bimetallism with unstable relations between coins and moneys of account.\n\nA comparison of the value of Venetian money with the values of the moneys of some of its important overseas trading partners is made possible by a clause in the Venetian Maritime Code of 1255 of Doge Renier Zeno. It made provisions regarding four moneys of account in which freight rates were set overseas for wares shipped to Venice: perperi of Romania, bezants of Oltremare, bezants of Barbary, and oncie of Sicily and Apulia. For each it specified the number of soldi to be collected in Venice from shipowners for penalties that had been imposed by Venetian consuls or other officials overseas. Because the amount of penalty was double the freight rate, the penalties were stated in the moneys of account used overseas in setting freight rates.39 The exchange rate probably included a surcharge levied on the shipowners, because they had paid the penalties, not at the time they were incurred, but at the conclusion of the voyage. A century or so later, shippers who paid in Constantinople or in Tana freights on wares shipped from Venice were required to pay an added 25 percent.40 The amount of the surcharge in 1255 is uncertain. It is here estimated to have been about 20 percent, with a margin of error making between 10 percent and 30 percent probable. Our comparisons investigate the extent to which the foreign moneys of account were based on gold or on silver and what the prevailing bimetallic ratios were about 1255.\n\nMAP 2\n\nFor each perpero of penalty imposed in Romania (mainly in Constantinople) the shipowners were to pay 32 soldi in Venice. Estimates of how that figure was reached may be made in either of two ways. If we assume that the Byzantine perpero was then based on the grosso and valued at 12 grossi, which was about the equivalent of 26 soldi, exchange at 32 soldi contained a surcharge of 6 soldi, which is 23 percent. If we assume that the Byzantine perpero was then based on a coin weighing 4.4 grams, 2/3 gold and 1/3 silver, then if the bimetallic ratio was 8.5 to 1, there was a surcharge of 18 percent.41 The difference between 18 percent and 23 percent is not so great as to discredit the above-formulated conclusion that at that date the perpero of Romania as a money of account had about the same value whether it was considered linked to the Byzantine coins called perperi or to the Venetian coins called grossi.\n\nFor each bezant of penalty incurred in Acre or other ports of the Crusader states, the shipowners were to pay 28 soldi. If the bezants referred to were “saracenati” that were 3/4 gold, 1/4 silver, no surcharge was included so long as the bimetallic ratio was 7.9 to 1 or more. This calculation suggests that the saracen bezants were then, as later, based on white bezants or other largely silver coin.42\n\nFor each bezant of Barbary the shipowners were to pay 18 soldi. There was then no coin in western North Africa called a bezant. The bezant was a money of account equal to 10 silver coins called by Arabs “dirhems” and by Europeans “migliaresi” or, in Venice, “miarexi.” Before 1262 or thereabouts, the link coin of the bezant was a dirhem weighing about 1.5 grams, which was called the “old dirhem” to distinguish it from a “new dirhem,” of the same weight but 0.937 fine and worth 20 percent more. It seems likely that the new dirhem was created between 1262 and 1272, shortly after the old dirhem had been debased so as to lose 20 percent of its value. The debasement may have had the purpose, as Robert Brunschvig has suggested, of lightening the burden of the tribute that Charles of Anjou as king of Naples-Sicily had imposed on Tunis.43 Being of the same weight but worth 20 percent less, the old dirhems must have been only 0.749 fine (0.937 × 0.80) after debasement, containing 1.12 grams of silver. Before debasement they probably had been 0.937 fine, as were the new dirhems, according to Pegolotti. In that case, the silver equivalent of the bezant of Tunis at the time of the Venetian Maritime Code of 1255 was 14.05 grams (0.937 × 1.5 × 10). In comparison, 18 Venetian soldi of that date represented 17.37 grams (18 × [19.3/20]) (cf. above, table 4). However, deducting a 20 percent estimated surcharge for late payment of the penalty leaves only 13.9 grams, sufficiently close to the silver value of the bezant of Tunis.\n\nThe long Byzantine and Moslem rule of Apulia and Sicily had established gold coin as the standard of value there, and that habit continued under the Norman rulers who united Sicily with southern Italy. The gold coin they minted was not the dinar, however, but the quarter of a dinar which Moslems called a “ruba’i” and the Italians called a “tarì.” Before the Swabian emperors succeeded the Norman kings, in 1194, the tarì had degenerated so that an improvement over earlier issues was required when the Swabian rulers declared the official fineness of the gold to be 18 1/3 carats. The weight of tarì coins was so extremely variable, from 0.23 grams to 1.89 grams, that they were accepted only by weight, and the basic money of account came to be an ounce of tarì. This money of account, the oncia of 26.4 grams, was divided into 30 tarì of account each figured as 0.88 grams, as accounting units, while tarì coins continued to vary. Emperor Frederick II issued a new style of large gold coin, the augustale, which weighed 1/5 of an oncia. He set its value at 1/4 of an oncia of account, since it contained 20–21 carats of gold, compared with the 16 1/3 carats in the tarì.44 Although not all coins issued were up to standard, as a money of account the oncia represented either 17.95 grams of pure gold, figuring from the tarì (0.88 × 30 × 0.68), or 18.48 grams (26.4 × [4/5] × 0.875), figuring from the augustale—roughly speaking, 18 grams of gold—and some silver mixed with the gold. For a penalty imposed in Apulia, Calabria, or Sicily, the payment per oncia required in Venice was 9 lire.45\n\nComparing the silver content of 9 lib. ven. (173.7 grams) with the gold content of an oncia gives a bimetallic ratio of 9.5 to 1;46 but if we allow for a 20 percent surcharge, the bimetallic ratio is reduced to 8 to 1, a not impossible ratio for 1255, since a contract concluded in Genoa in 1253 indicates a ratio of 8.16 to 1.47\n\nThis analysis of the exchange rates indicated by the Venetian Maritime Code of 1255 lends support to the conclusion that the bimetallic ratio was at that time as low as 8.5 in many parts of the Mediterranean. It indicates also that of the four areas mentioned as important for Venetian shipping, only the Neapolitan-Sicilian kingdom used a money of account based entirely on gold, and its gold was of uncertain quality. In the other three areas, silver coins were becoming important as means of payment and as determinants of the comparative values of the moneys of account, just as at Venice silver coins determined the value of Venetian moneys of account.\n\niii. THE NEW GOLD COINS OF WESTERN RIVALS\n\nIn the nebulous bimetallic and symmetallic systems of the eastern Mediterranean about 1250, the mixture of gold and silver in the same coin obscured the exact relation between their relative market values as metals and their monetary value as legal tender. Consequently, governmental authority and tradition had a wider range of influence in determining the values at which the coins were accepted. Rational calculation of the metallic value of coins became easier when the coins in use were of pure silver or pure gold.\n\nCoins that were more purely gold than any then in general circulation in the Mediterranean were issued by Genoa and Florence in 1252. Their initiative in coining gold was rooted in their commercial situation, especially that of Genoa, which probably issued its genovino before Florence issued its gold florin. They both depended heavily on trade with areas where gold coins had long been the main standard of value, namely, Naples, Sicily, North Africa, and Spain. The gold coins being minted in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1252 were not of consistent, dependable fineness. But the Genoese and Florentines needed gold coins in order to buy grain in Sicily. Their trade with North Africa and Spain supplied the needed gold. Both the genovino and the florin were given the gold content and the value in Sicilian money of account that seemed most likely to make them acceptable in Sicily.48\n\nWithin a few decades Florence had succeeded in having its gold coins accepted not only in all Italy but at the fairs of Champagne also, then in England and the Netherlands as well as in France.49 By the end of the century florins were so much used in the Levant that in a collection seized by the Mamluks in 1291 when they captured the last Crusader foothold in Palestine, about 600 out of 630 gold coins were florins.50\n\nWhen they coined the florin of 24-carat gold, or at least as nearly pure gold as was technically possible, the Florentines created a bimetallic standard and at the same time made the maintenance of such a standard more difficult. Previously, Florence, like Venice, might be said to have had a bimetallic monetary system but not a bimetallic standard, for the standard was provided by silver coins only. Gold coins—Byzantine, Spanish, or Neapolitan—did not have a value guaranteed by the state. The new florin, on the other hand, was officially declared worth 1 lira in the current Florentine and Pisan moneys of account, which were based on silver.51 Thus in 1252 Florence established a single bimetallic standard based on two kinds of coins, one containing all gold and no silver, the other containing silver and no gold.\n\nWithin a few years, Florentine rationalistic calculation destroyed this bimetallic standard. Gold rose in value far above the bimetallic ratio set by equating 1 gold florin with 1 lira composed of 20 Florentine silver groats or 240 billon pennies.52 The traditional Florentine lira then split into several moneys of account by processes not unlike those that separated the lira a grossi from the lira di piccoli at Venice. As gold rose in value, the Florentines rated their gold coin at more than 20 soldi of silver coins. Between 1272 and 1296 they used three moneys of account and spoke of three different kinds of soldi: (1) a soldo a oro, a denomination of account equal to 1/20 of a gold florin; (2) a soldo a fiorini, equal to the silver coin called a fiorino or its equivalent in similar silver coin; (3) a soldo di piccioli, equal to 12 of the billon coins called piccioli.\n\nBy 1279 the gold fiorino coin was quoted as worth 29 of the current silver florin coins. The gold florin was still equated with 1 lira, but that lira became distinguished by being called a lira a oro or fiorino a oro, and its subdivisions were called soldi and denari a oro. Accounts were still being kept largely in the more traditional money of account that had been based on the silver coin also called a florin. Its lira was distinguished by being called a lira a fiorini, and its subdivisions were called lire, soldi, and denari a fiorini. After 1279, in the leading merchant guild, the Calimala, in accounts kept in lire and soldi a fiorini, 1 gold florin was by law regularly counted as worth 29 silver florins. Accordingly they reckoned: 1 gold florin = 1 lira a oro = 20 soldi a oro = 29 soldi a fiorini; and 1 soldo a oro = 29/20 soldi a fiorini.\n\nTHE FLORENTINE GOLD FLORIN\n\nThe essentials of the design of the first florin issued in 1252 were preserved thereafter. This specimen was struck in the second semester of 1324, under the mint official Tano di Baroncello.\n\nObv.: .+ FLOR. .ENTIA Lily.\n\nRev.: .S.IOHA NNES.B St. John the Baptist, facing front.

Museo Bottacin, inv. no. 11 (Bernocchi, 2: 145 nos. 1312–13).\n\nSubsequently Florentine silver coins, as well as Florentine billon coins, declined in value—clearly so after 1296. These equations were still used,53 but “soldo a fiorini” no longer referred to silver coin. Instead, Florentine silver groats became linked to the Florentine lira di piccioli.54 The “soldo a fiorini” remained linked to gold; it was constantly worth 1/29 of a gold florin. It became a mere fractional denomination of account.55\n\nAs a result, after 1296 the gold florin coin had three different values in money of account: (1) 20 soldi a oro; (2) 29 soldi a fiorini; and (3) a number of soldi di piccioli which varied from year to year. In 1279 it was 33 soldi di piccioli; in 1302, 51 soldi di piccioli.56 These variations depended partly on changes in the bimetallic ratio, partly on changes in the quantity, weight, and fineness of the silver and billon coins. The widening gap between the values of the florin in soldi a oro and in soldi di piccioli showed that Florence no longer had a single bimetallic standard.\n\nPossibly Florence abandoned any attempt at a single bimetallic standard almost immediately, and the gold florin was quoted at 25, not 20, soldi a fiorini as early as 1260. But there is also evidence that from 1279 to 1296 a gold florin was invariably quoted at 29 soldi a fiorini, which indicates that the lira a fiorini was based equally on the gold florin and the silver florin.57 In that case, the lira a fiorini expressed a bimetallic standard in those years by being equal to both 20 silver florins and 20/29 of a gold florin.\n\nThis attempt at resurgence of a Florentine bimetallic standard is the more interesting because it overlaps the Venetian attempt at bimetallism, 1284–1296, described below as part of the “defense of the grosso.”\n\nThe short-lived, silver-based lira a fiorini, as recently described by Mario Bernocchi, had a role at Florence between 1260 and 1296 that was parallel in many respects to that of the lira a grossi in Venice. Both diverged in value from the lira di piccoli of their respective cities, continuing in different ways a traditional lira and giving the traditional money of account a new base in silver coin that was more than 90 percent fine. Since Florence was coining gold at the same time, however, whereas Venice coined gold only later, Florence had less need then for a money of account based on fine silver to serve as a standard of value. Its lira a fiorini was based on both gold and silver only very briefly.58 After 1296 it clung to the gold connection. All the accounts of the Bardi and Peruzzi, great Florentine firms of international merchant-bankers of the fourteenth century, were kept in lire, soldi, and denari a fiorini, with regular conversions of fiorini d’oro into lire, soldi, and denari a fiorini by use of the equation 1 fiorino d’oro = 29/20 lire a fiorini.59\n\nNo further effort was made by Florentines to maintain a bimetallic basis for a money of account. Thereafter they used two quite separate monetary standards, one based on gold, the other on silver. The lira di piccioli expressed the silver standard, while the gold standard was expressed by the lira a fiorini as well as by the lira a oro, usually named the fiorino d’oro.\n\niv. THE DUCAT AND VENICE’S FIRST BIMETALLIC STANDARD\n\nIn the face of the developments just described, the coinage of the ducat in 1284–85 can be considered part of the “defense of the grosso.” Within the city, foreign silver coins, more or less similar to Venetian grossi but of inferior value, were circulating increasingly. Overseas, especially in the Levant, more and more mints were issuing silver coins of good quality, and silver coins were increasingly determining the value of the moneys of account used in international trade and shipping. The golden perperi and bezants minted in the Levant were becoming ever more diverse and unreliable. Coins of practically pure gold, however, had been issued by Genoa and Florence, and for decades gold had been rising in value. Compared with silver coins or with obligations based on silver, gold coins and moneys of account based on gold were proving more reliable for storing away exchange value for future use.\n\nThe availability side by side of coins of pure gold and coins of almost pure silver raised the possibility of bimetallic standards more clearly defined than the nebulous bimetallic standards that had been in use in the Levant and were based on loosely defined relations between silver coins such as the Venetian grossi and coins containing both gold and silver, such as the Byzantine perperi. When in coining gold Venice imitated what Genoa and Florence had done thirty years earlier, Venice attempted to tie her gold coin to her existing moneys of account so as to create a bimetallic monetary standard. As we have just seen, the Florentines had quickly abandoned the bimetallic standard created when they first coined the florin. Subsequently they gave up any effort to maintain a single unified monetary standard. While continuing the use of a money of account based on silver or billon in local trade, they were content to use gold as the basis for the moneys of account that they employed in their international business. Venice, on the other hand, would not so easily give up using silver as a standard of value in international trade, especially for purchases in the Levant, which were more important to Venetian merchants than to Florentine merchants and for which the Venetians used silver received from the Germans.\n\nThe ratio that Venice established in its first bimetallic standard shows an effort to stop the rise of gold. To make its Levantine purchases on traditional and favorable terms, the Venetians needed to maintain the relative value of silver. When they voted in October 1284 to mint the ducat, they voted to make it of exactly the same weight and fineness as the florin, although with a distinctively Venetian design. The following spring, when the coin was actually minted, it was made legal tender for 40 soldi a grossi, the equivalent of 18.38 (480/26.111) silver grossi.60 When the ducat was valued at 40 soldi a grossi, coined gold was being valued only 10.9 (18.38 × [2.1/3.55]) times as much as coined silver, although in that decade the bimetallic ratio between coined gold and silver at Florence was about 11.6 to 1.61\n\nTHE VENETIAN GOLD DUCAT\n\nAn example of the first issue, struck under Doge Giovanni Dandolo (1280–89).\n\nObv.: .IODANDVL.

Museo Bottacin, inv. no. 81 (Papadopoli, 1: 137 no. 1).\n\nAn opportunity to check the rising value of gold and at the same time to obtain from the bullion trade more profits for Venetian merchants and more earnings for its craftsmen was being presented to the Venetians because German miners were exploiting the gold veins in the mines located in the Kingdom of Hungary. Florentines managed the Hungarian mints and turned much of that gold into Hungarian florins resembling those of Florence, but much gold bullion was brought to Venice by German merchants. Genoa and Florence had better commercial networks through which to obtain the gold from North Africa or Spain, but Venice was the Italian city best placed to offer a market for gold bullion mined in Hungary and Transylvania.62 The auction of the Germans’ gold by the Visdomini of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi is mentioned as early as 1272.63 Increased production of the Hungarian gold mines in the latter part of the century may well have given Venetians reason to hope that they could arrest the rising price of gold.\n\nConcern with keeping down the price of gold is apparent in the provisions made when the ducat was first coined. In 1284 the mint was instructed to buy gold at such a price that the ducats would not cost more than 18 grossi each.64 It is doubtful that gold bullion could have been obtained with that ceiling on its price, for that price implied a bimetallic ratio of 10.6 to 1, distinctly less than the 11.3 to 1 generally estimated as the ratio at that time65 and even less than the ratio of 10.9 to 1 between coined gold and coined silver implied by the official value of 40 soldi a grossi given the ducat the following year.66 An appropriation of 8,000 lire a grossi was then put at the disposal of the mintmasters for buying gold.67 Later in that same year, on 28 August 1285, they were authorized to borrow money at 8 percent with which to buy gold for minting in order to put the gold coins in circulation (“ut moneta auri currat”). The loans were to be repaid the following 8 June.68 In August 1286 the mintmasters were authorized to borrow up to 10,000 lire from the fund that had been accumulated at the office of the Procurators of San Marco, almost certainly in the form of grossi, assigned for payments on the public debt, and were required to pay the Procurators back in gold ducats within three days after their minting.69 With this provision, the government suggested that bondholders would soon have to accept payments on the public debt in the form of ducats instead of grossi.\n\nConcern with keeping down the price of gold while encouraging acceptance of the new coin is evident also in the inducements offered for importing gold coins from overseas. In December 1286 the mint was ordered to recoin into ducats 24,000 perperi just arrived from Constantinople and to do it with such charges that the government neither lost nor gained.70 In March 1287 it was provided that thereafter, those bringing perperi or tarì or other gold coin for reminting should receive 132 1/2 lire (2,650 soldi) a grossi for each mark instead of the 2,600 soldi paid for bullion certified by the officials of the Rialto.71\n\nThis special concern with attracting gold from overseas was later expressed in the lower mint charges on gold from “outside the gulf,” which meant in practice Africa and the Levant, compared with the mint charge on gold imported from “within the gulf,” meaning gold that the Germans brought by land or across the head of the Adriatic.72 Not until the 1340s was the lower seigniorage of only about 0.4 percent, represented by the mint’s paying out ducats at 39 soldi, extended to the Germans.73 Recoinage of gold coins from the Levant, such as high-quality Egyptian dinars and any very old perperi that contained more than the 3.55 grams of gold in the ducat (that is, perperi that were of more than 20 carats gold), was encouraged by forbidding rectors to accept in payment of taxes any bezants as worth more than 40 soldi, the minimal value set on the ducat. “Current” perperi and saracenati were to be valued at no more than 20 soldi (1/2 a ducat).74 Being thus made worth less as legal tender than as bullion, old good Levantine issues of gold or electrum coins were more likely to be brought to the mint to be converted into ducats."
