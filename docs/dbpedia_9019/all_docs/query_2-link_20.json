YuSoslavia lacks expert technicians and good mechanical workers, General chaos followed the break with Russia, and the situation is now such that t hn US should take over Rus.siats role, '6speeia lly in. tie field of armament, and thoroughly re-equip the Yugoslav army. Such reorganization requires time and money, together with control to. avoid waste. Until recently the Yugoslav Army was divided. into armies, three armoured. units, and one Guards division, Now new units,\"Korpuc\" are being organized ;which each contain a number of divisions. Nine I6'd0J (+ Yugoslav Communist Youth) divis ions, under the' orders of the Ministry of the Interior, and. the so-eall.od \"Popular Militia\" complete the military organization, The Yugoslav Army, however, remains an hetero c neous unanageablo human conglomeration, only theoretically divided. into soi,o thirty infantry divisions and three armoured units. The Yugoslav infantry division consists of three infantry reginr::nts, one artillery regiment, one battalion of engineers and other services, no more than 10,000 men in all.. Guns are scarce and of various types and calibres, there is a shortage of engineers, whirr the :Few motcr- vehicles are obsolete. The big armoured units (\"Korpus\") are mostly equipped with some Russian and out-dated armour:' although recently some new Yugoslav tanks have boon added. In conclusion: the Yugoslav soldier is worthy of'r6speot. With the means at his dispo:;al and with Arrr:rican help he will be ablo to wage'a guerilla, war in the \"central stronghold\" of the country. Such operations, if carried out with the sane spirit and energy shorn dur.~a.?ng the last war, must not be underrated, But it should not be forgotten that this \"central stronghold\" lies far from the fertile plains and the main cities of Yugoslavia and would leave the road to the West ,open to invading arriri.es, The situation intone $ - CLN exponents . cc of er with Taviani (Pb) Rome,' 5th Deem : - The Under-secretary of the For wi gn Minis try, Taviani, received the ?resident of the Istrian Committee for National Liberation (CLN) and the Secretary of the Istrian inter-zonal Committee of the Christian Democratic l?arty. The two Istrian re:presentativ::s explained to Taviard the present sitti.tion in the 1TTts,Zone B and called the attention of the (Italian) Government to the intention of the Yugoslav authorities to restict further the most fundamental rights of the population* . The ;ton. Taviani reassured the Istrian reprosentati-vvs,aftor whic h the Lmnorzll situation in the Zone was thoroughly examined in view of probable developments in the international field, !. liquidate the Fisheries Consortium? ? Questions at the City Council TLEJ Trirastino fishermen are concerned over the fate of their Fisheries: Consortium, the future, and the vary existence o:' which. is endangered by certain plans (AMC-sponsored) of its cor_unxi.ssionor. This was the subject Councillor Ca110pin's question raised at the last meeting of the City Council, and also of this article, the main points of which can be summed r: as follows: Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R011200160001-8 Approved For Release 2001/09/10 : CIA-RDP83-00415R0112b0160Q01-8. The intention to liquidate the Fishorios Consortium ap;.)carc clear from the following facts: 1) the interruption of th,i 'hydrographic studies and'roscarch'in our Gulf;' 2) the suspension of a snccial allowance to,fisherinen who improved their equipment\" j) trrs termination of--cQrtai,n services at the Consortium, i) the r1ismissalzi; of the Consortium's staff, ordered by AMG's commissioner; Is the planned liquidation of the Maher ss Con 3orti rm justified? There are many indications to the contrary. Th,j]ishorios Consortium qa s 'sot up *in 1932 .byk a decree ofI the Italian Ministry for Agricultnro, 1'orests and F:i sheries, to organ isv and. asist, all fisherman of Venezia Giulia# In the ,mr.-ediato post-war period the Consortium was reor .ni.s od and its authority extended to the neighbourin salt and deep-sea .,eaters, `\"he Consortium' s twenty-,years' . xperiunco gives a solid guarantee of efficiency to its members. The local fi hermcn believe that only through s-uah a union can they not - :, t heir equipment and improve their co nditiuns. Therefore they unanimouply domandea the continuation of their org--_rization, as it3 seen from 'a mot .on'sent by l owners of fishing-boats to h.MG's- Director for Civil Affairs, In this motion the fishermen demand\" \"that the statutory organisation of the Consortium bo' reestablished, an the oommisr. oner removed\"? Councillor Gallopin was right in oxposing this throat to the national character of tie organisation, as the 'planned liquichtion of the Fishorias Consortium probably hides the iirtontion to croate a now body, flit,; s cannot bo sec ted det ched Exam Rome baari the ark of t E~ T p , , , a m . n nor can a continued adrninl tratior. under ez oommIssi new be tolerated, Coni'iseation cif identity- rda in --Lono B - YMCts impudent reply (La) Yesterday the Yugoslav administration of Zone t finaUUy broke its silence on the question of thq :rurlwrs detsi.aed in Zone B since last October by the confiscation of their Tri yt:e identify cards.

Who arc now able to analyso scorn data ncernin ono of thu most important branches of Triestine economy, that of retail commorco: Instead of the usual seasonal improvemnt, lo-,,r purahas ing power om2I.vJIod consumers in October -of this year to be very cautious in buying' in the retail. market. This forced the Irorcthi ets to sell ridiculously :.l small quantititos on credit.

Here: than half th:i.l amount are dobonturos from 50 thousand to one million lire,, which indicates that small and msdium merchants woro unable to mat in Octolx;r almost twice as many obligations as during the rrovious montth. ? Since small debts, up to lO,QOO lire Dacha mostly duo to monthly instabrc nt. paymont;,,roachod a rather high total of 4 mihl.:i.on700 thousand lira, not paid during Octobe::r, it Is more than Ivor cloar that wages and. salaries must be rai^iod by 15 per cent, as domandod by the SU and t t COIL, It in not -only a question of justice to workers and employees, but also of measures to rove tho retail trade. Consumers, in fact, bought loss during October than diming the same month last year. ? This was because prices in October, as compared With those in Juno 1950, -eroro higher: by 13 per cent for :Food, by 35 per cent for toxtile , by 33 per cent for clothing, by 22 per cent for und0x?- weaar, and 1.1 par cent for footwear, as shown by the Zone Prusi(t-oncyls.

But the local Independentists do not give up.

It is, well--known that in Trieste MG eollecto manufacturing taxes and customs fees for account of the Italian Goverm::ent -,ma' uses these amounts for its own rm- poses, v:hich represents a f'urthor contribution by Italy to the cpono y of otu~ Zone and the entire ITT.
