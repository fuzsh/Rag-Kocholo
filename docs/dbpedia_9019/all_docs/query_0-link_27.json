        "text": "1954 marked the beginning of a brief but intense migratory flow from the city of Trieste towards Australia. Following a prolonged period of Anglo-American administration, the city had been returned to Italian jurisdiction once more; and with the dismantling of the Allied caretaker government and the subsequent economic integration of Trieste into the Italian State, a climate of uncertainty and precariousness had left the Triestines psychologically disenchanted and discouraged. Although historically Trieste did not have a tradition of migration, many chose to emigrate during this period. Among those who left were former employees of the Allied Military Government who were concerned for their future, but there were also others with stable employment. Importantly, Triestine migration displays many atypical characteristics when compared to Italian migration in general. Unlike many other Italian migrants, most Triestines came to Australia as part of complete nuclear family units, many were assisted passage migrants and a significant number of these were in possession of trade qualifications on their arrival. Importantly, furthermore, the Triestines are the only immigrants of Italian origin to have mass migrated from an urban environment. And, as this study highlights, this factor has impacted on the migratory experiences and the identity and community making process of this group. The Triestines who immigrated to Australia during this period were particularly aware of themselves as Triestines. Political and economic forces had historically fostered the development of a Triestine identity and during the post war period, when many of these immigrants had experienced a sense of betrayal, the act of migration served to strengthen a feeling of circumscribed Triestine identity once more. By narrating and analysing the immigrant experiences of this group, this research reveals that this identity was also reinforced by the migration experience and process as the urban mind-set of the Triestines initially set them apart as 'strangers' within both the Anglo-Saxon reality and the Italo-Australian one. By negotiating both similarities and difference in the context of a shared immigrant experience, the Triestines were, however, successfully able to become part of the Italo-Australian community, but they continued to maintain a distinct sense of their own identity as Triestines. What emerges from this study is that this enduring sense of identity can be seen to be tied, not to essentialist notions of identity, but to a continued and dynamic process of negotiation which allowed the triestini to adopt various 'positionalities' which became part of a dialectical process of identity construction.By examining the migrant experience of both first and subsequent generations of Triestines in the Australian city of Melbourne in a historical context, this study thus highlights the importance of both the past and the present experience in the process of migrant settlement and identity construction. The study is based on archival and field research, including interviews with 75 informants. It holds in balance a story of group formation (how the Triestines evolved as a group within Melbourne) with an account of group identity (who they were as Triestines)."
