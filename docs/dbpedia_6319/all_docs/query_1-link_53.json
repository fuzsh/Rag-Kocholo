        "text": "Countless poems, books, paintings, and songs have detailed the cool, mesmerizing luster of baby blues in all their shades from indigo to aquamarine. Symbolizing icy pain or cool romance, blue eyes have been lyrically intertwined with some of the most romantic and melancholy tunes throughout time.\n\nWe’ve rounded up the 20 best lyrics and songs about blue eyes, from Taylor Swift to Guns N’ Roses. If your eyes are blue, this one’s for you.\n\n“Tim McGraw” by Taylor Swift\n\n“He said the way my blue eyes shined put those Georgia stars to shame that night / I said that’s a lie.” The longing love song from Taylor Swift’s 2006 debut album made girls everywhere swoon with nostalgia for fleeting summer romance.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“Behind Blue Eyes” by The Who\n\n“No one knows what it’s like to be the bad man, to be the sad man / Behind blue eyes.” The Who’s Pete Townshend reportedly wrote the lyrics from the point of view of a villain who just wants to be a good guy.\n\n“Blue Eyes” by MIKA\n\n“Oh, your heart is broken to your surprise / You’re sick of crying for blue eyes.” Mika said in an interview that the song is about a woman who loses her heart on the London subway system, and goes to the lost and found to retrieve it.\n\n“Blue Eyes” by Elton John\n\n“Baby’s got blue eyes like a deep blue sea / On a blue blue day.” Our list would be soulless if not for this signature 1982 Grammy-nominated piano ballad, complete with a cinematic ocean-side video on Sydney’s Bondi to Bronte coastal walk.\n\n“Fast Cars and Freedom” by Rascal Flatts\n\nThis country jam is so infectious, when the band harmonizes on ?”I see a dust trail following an old red Nova / Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder” it’s impossible not to sing out in agreement.\n\n“Complexion (A Zulu Love)” by Kendrick Lamar\n\n“Dark as the midnight hour, I’m bright as the mornin’ sun / Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can’t run.” Lamar’s poignant track from To Pimp A Butterfly tells stories of colorism and racism while proclaiming “Complexion don’t mean a thing.”\n\n“Blue Eyes” by Haiki\n\nThis feel good Euro-dance track builds up from a simple groove into chants of, “I was lost in those blue eyes.” Perfect for chilling on an beach in Mykonos, but your backyard will do.\n\n“Shades of Cool” by Lana Del Rey\n\n“My baby lives in shades of blue / Blue eyes and jazz and attitude / He lives in California too / He drives a Chevy Malibu.” Lana details a blue, blue romance with a man who’s cool exterior only leads to an impenetrable icy heart.\n\n“Suite: Judy Blue Eyes” by Crosby, Stills & Nash\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash debuted this song at Woodstock, written by Steven Stills to his girlfriend at the time, singer Judy Collins. The classic 1969 prelude to their imminent breakup was all the more heartbreaking on lyrics like “This does not mean I don’t love you / I do, that’s forever.”\n\n“Hazey” by Glass Animals\n\n“Come back baby, don’t you cry / Don’t you drain those big blue eyes” is about an exhausting relationship with an abusive alcoholic, but not being able to leave.\n\n“I Still Miss Someone” by Stevie Nicks\n\nThis Johnny Cash song got an update in 1989 with Nicks’ signature waspy sound. “Oh, no I never got over those blue eyes, I see them everywhere / I miss those arms that held me when all the love was there.”\n\n“Baby Blue” by George Strait\n\nThis song about blue eyes from 1988 commemorates Jenifer Straight, George’s daughter who was killed at age 13 two years before the song was released. “And baby blue was the color of her eyes / Baby blue like the Colorado skies / Like a breath of spring, she came and left / And I still don’t know why / So here’s to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.”\n\n“Sweet Child O’ Mine” by Guns N’ Roses\n\n“She’s got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain / I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain.” The iconic rock jam got a classic reboot in Step Brothers, during the famous sing-along scene.\n\n“No Light, No Light” by Florence and the Machine\n\n“No light, no light in your bright blue eyes / I never knew daylight could be so violent.” Florence’s rich, haunting vocals soar on this Ceremonials track as she screams out for a lost love.\n\n“Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain” by Willie Nelson\n\n“In the twilight glow I see them, blue eyes cryin’ in the rain / When we kissed goodbye and parted, I knew we’d never meet again.” The sad ballad took a bare, unfiltered approach on Nelson’s take of the country classic, earning him his first Grammy for best country vocal performance.\n\n“Feels Like Summer” by Weezer\n\n“I’m not used to losing / Bye, bye, sugar blue eyes / You’re home with the angels / Thank you for being so kind.” Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo told Genius the song is about loss, and reminiscing about what it feels like to spend summer without someone.\n\n“Pale Blue Eyes” by The Velvet Underground\n\nReleased on the band’s self titled 1969 album, “Linger on your pale blue eyes” is about being in love with a married woman.\n\n“Hey Blue Eyes” by Bruce Springsteen\n\nFrom Springsteen’s 2014 EP American Beauty, this dark song about blue eyes is really a political metaphor.\n\n“Grey Blue Eyes” by Dave Matthews\n\n“Grey Blue Eyes” came from Dave Matthews’ 2003 solo album Some Devil, a moody collection of material deemed unfit for DMB. “Don’t forget my broken heart / You remember it from the start / You made it and it’s all a part / Of your grey blue eyes.”\n\n“Blue Eyes Blue” by Eric Clapton\n\nFrom the Runaway Bride soundtrack, “Blue Eyes Blue” finds a man left out in the cold after his woman leaves. “It was you who broke my heart in pieces / It was you, it was you who made my blue eyes blue.”"
