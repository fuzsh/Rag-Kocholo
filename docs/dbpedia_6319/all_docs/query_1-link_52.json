        "text": "Book 1 in the #1 New York Times Bestselling Raven Cycle Quartet\n\nThe Raven Boys\n\nEvery year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue never sees them--until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks to her.\n\nHis name is Gansey, a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.\n\nBut Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can't entirely explain. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul whose emotions range from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher who notices many things but says very little.\n\nFor as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She doesn't believe in true love, and never thought this would be a problem. But as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she's not so sure anymore.\n\nBook 2 in the #1 New York Times Bestselling Raven Cycle Quartet\n\nThe Dream Thieves\n\nRonan Lynch has secrets. Some he keeps from others. Some he keeps from himself.\n\nOne secret: Ronan can bring things out of his dreams.\n\nAnd sometimes he's not the only one who wants those things.\n\nRonan is one of the raven boys - a group of friends, practically brothers, searching for a dead king named Glendower, who they think is hidden somewhere in the hills by their elite private school, Aglionby Academy. The path to Glendower has long lived as an undercurrent beneath town. But now, like Ronan's secrets, it is beginning to rise to the surface - changing everything in its wake.\n\nBook 3 in the #1 New York Times Bestselling Raven Cycle Quartet\n\nBlue Lily, Lily Blue\n\nBlue Sargent has found things. For the first time in her life, she has friends she can trust, a group to which she can belong. The Raven Boys have taken her in as one of their own. Their problems have become hers, and her problems have become theirs.\n\nThe trick with found things, though, is how easily they can be lost.\n\nFriends can betray.\n\nMothers can disappear.\n\nIn a starred review, The Bulletin called The Dream Thieves, the previous book in The Raven Cycle, \"a complex web of magical intrigue and heart-stopping action.\" Now, with Blue Lily, Lily Blue, the web becomes even more complex, snaring readers at every turn.\n\nVisions can mislead.\n\nCertainties can unravel.\n\nBook 4 in the #1 New York Times Bestselling Raven Cycle Quartet\n\nThe Raven King\n\nAll her life, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love's death. She doesn't believe in true love and never thought this would be a problem, but as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she's not so sure anymore.In a starred review for Blue Lily, Lily Blue, Kirkus Reviews declared: \"Expect this truly one-of-a-kind series to come to a thundering close.\""
