        "text": "Me and the Boys in the Band is a song from Carly Rae Jepsen. It was released on August 18th 2020, through 604, School Boy and Interscope.\n\nThe song was released exclusively via YouTube. The music video has garnered over 900k views as of February 2024. [1]\n\nLyrics[]\n\nSong credits[]\n\nWriting and production[]\n\nWritten by: Carly Rae Jepsen • Tavish Crowe • Jack Antonoff\n\nProduced by: Jack Antonoff\n\nInstrumentation[]\n\nElectric guitar: Tavish Crowe\n\nAcoustic guitar: Carly Rae Jepsen\n\nDrums: Nik Pesut\n\nKeyboards: Jared Manerika\n\nSynthesizer: Jack Antonoff\n\nWriting and development[]\n\nMe and the Boys in the Band was initially written by Jepsen alongside her guitarist Tavish Crowe during The Dedicated Tour. Carly states the song started off as a 'challenge' not to write a love song and was one of many experiments born out of the idea. [2]\n\nThe song was written during Carly's breakup with then-boyfriend James Flannigan, and was inspired by how her bandmates had helped and supported her and the time they spend together whilst on tour. She explained, 'I was so amazed by the power of the friendships I had developed within my bandmates, of how they helped me get through that. Because it felt like a really huge moment in my life, and yet there were these two hours of joy that we’d be on stage together and we’d be kicking it on the road.' [3]\n\nDevelopment during quarantine[]\n\nPrior to quarantine in early 2020, Jepsen was preparing to release Dedicated Side B and had originally planned to tour the album - however, the tour was cancelled due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Afterwards, Carly explained how she had developed a 'deep appreciation' for travelling and touring alongside the band, and the song reemerged from that feeling. [3]\n\nWhilst in quarantine, Jepsen began thinking of a way she could release the song even though she was away from the band. The original song Jepsen and Crowe wrote previously was brought to Jack Antonoff, who worked to produce the final version of the track from home. Carly stated, 'When we showed it to Jack Antonoff, he helped us to develop it in a completely different way, where it got funkier in the best possible way.' Band members Tavish Crowe, Jared Manerika, and Nik Pesut also made contributions to the song remotely from home. [3][4]\n\nJepsen states the song would have 'never seen the light of day' if not for quarantine; 'the idea to share it made sense because of the real nostalgia we were all feeling for this life we had taken for granted; being on the road and having this band of brothers' she explained. 'It came from really missing the band boys. It was a jam that we started and came into fruition.' [2][5] In relation to her upcoming album, Carly stated the song was 'just for the moment' and likely wouldn't appear on the project. [3]\n\nRework from Talk To Me[]\n\nMe and the Boys in the Band samples portion of Jepsen's previous song Talk To Me, released as part of the Curiosity EP in 2012 - the bridge of Talk To Me was rewritten and reworked into the post-chorus of Me and the Boys in the Band.\n\nThemes and lyricism[]\n\nMe and the Boys in the Band is Jepsen's tribute to the band through quarantine, reminiscing on the days spent touring pre-pandemic. Although Jepsen states the song is decidedly not about love, it briefly touches upon the topic of a break-up on tour and having the band boys there to support her and help her in finding herself post-relationship.\n\nThe song is most likely written about the end of Jepsen's relationship with ex-boyfriend James Flannigan, as the pair broke up sometime after 2019, and additionally references Real Love, the Dedicated album track produced and co-written by Flannigan.\n\nUpon the release of the song, Jepsen stated the following: 'Through romantic relationships good and bad I have always found myself again in the late-night conversations with my band. Here's to all the shows we have played and have yet to play. The late-night dancers we turn into on the long bus drives and the tourists we become in the early mornings. Here’s to nostalgia city and keeping close the ones that know you best. Can’t wait for more.' [4]\n\nMusic video[]\n\nMe and the Boys in the Band received an official YouTube music video the day of release, on August 18th 2020, directed and edited by Jake Chamseddine. Currently, through the music video is the only way the song has been officially distributed. [6]\n\nThe video itself features a compilation of video clips filmed during quarantine of Jepsen and the band at home performing the song, as well as various photos and videos from before the pandemic of the group together in person, on tour, and performing together. Jepsen's portion of the at-home footage was recorded by her boyfriend Nick Theodorakis, who had spent the day filming for the video. [6][5]"
