        "text": "No Sleep Till BrooklynBeastie Boys\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\" is a parody of Heavy Metal. Kerry King of Slayer played guitar on the track - purposefully out of tune in parts.\n\nDixie ChickenLittle Feat\n\nThe Dixie Chicks got their name from the Little Feat song \"Dixie Chicken.\" In 2020 they became \"The Chicks\" because Dixie refers to the American South in times of slavery.\n\nSweetest ThingU2\n\nBono wrote \"Sweetest Thing\" for his wife to make up for working on her birthday. For the video, he staged an \"apology parade,\" complete with Irish step dancers and an elephant.\n\nAngieThe Rolling Stones\n\n\"Angie\" was the only ballad by The Rolling Stones to hit #1 in America.\n\n(I've Had) The Time of My LifeBill Medley & Jennifer Warnes\n\n\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" was a huge hit from the movie Dirty Dancing. It was used in the climactic dance scene at the end, which was actually the first scene shot for the movie.\n\nLady MarmaladeLabelle\n\nThe chorus of \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir\" in \"Lady Marmalade\" is French for \"Do you want to sleep with me tonight?\" When Labelle performed it on television, they had to change it to \"Voulez-vous danser avec moi ce soir\" (Do you want to dance with me tonight?).\n\nMuhammad Ali: His Musical Legacy and the Songs he InspiredSong Writing\n\nBefore he was the champ, Ali released an album called I Am The Greatest!, but his musical influence is best heard in the songs he inspired.\n\nSusanna Hoffs - \"Eternal Flame\"They're Playing My Song\n\nThe Prince-penned \"Manic Monday\" was the first song The Bangles heard coming from a car radio, but \"Eternal Flame\" is closest to Susanna's heart, perhaps because she sang it in \"various states of undress.\"\n\nAlbum Cover InspirationsSong Writing\n\nSome album art was at least \"inspired\" by others. A look at some very similar covers.\n\nDonnie Iris (Ah! Leah!, The Rapper)Songwriter Interviews\n\nBefore \"Rap\" was a form of music, it was something guys did to pick up girls in nightclubs. Donnie talks about \"The Rapper\" and reveals the identity of Leah.\n\nWolfgang Van HalenSongwriter Interviews\n\nWolfgang Van Halen breaks down the songs on his debut album, Mammoth WVH, and names the definitive Van Halen songs from the Sammy and Dave eras."
