This is the sweeping epic story of the Battle of Gettysburg as experienced by the soldiers who were there. In mid-July 1863, Union Lieutenant Frank A. Haskell wrote a letter to his brother which is considered one of the most vivid and well-written accounts of the battle of Gettysburg. Haskell's compelling words and moving eyewitness accounts from soldiers on both sides serve as our window to the largest battle ever fought on American soil.",

        "text": "Whenever I see that a history DVD is from PBS, I assume it will be excellent...or better. Their shows, such as \"The American Experience\" and \"American Masters\", are simply among the best documentaries you can find--expertly crafted, interesting and very educational. When I saw \"Gettysburg: The Boys in Blue & Gray\" I naturally thought it would be yet another excellent film. Well, I was mistaken. First, it was not really a history of the Battle of Gettysburg, as least not in the traditional sense. Second, it looked like a whole bunch of historical re-enactors get together and made a film--not exactly a professional one at that. The film simply consists of folks in Civil War uniforms running about like they are fighting the battle as folks read (often rather poorly--they obviously are NOT voice actors) letters or diary accounts of what occurred. I was not impressed and the show clearly isn't up to the usual quality standards of the PBS DVDs. I'd pass on this one."
