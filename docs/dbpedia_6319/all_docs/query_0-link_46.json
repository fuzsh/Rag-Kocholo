        "text": "What is dysgraphia?\n\nDysgraphia is a neurological condition in which someone has difficulty turning their thoughts into written language for their age and ability to think, despite exposure to adequate instruction and education. Dysgraphia can present with many different symptoms at different ages. It’s considered a learning difference.\n\nWriting is a complex process that involves many skills and brain functions, including:\n\nFine motor skills.\n\nSpatial perception (ability to perceive the space around you).\n\nWorking memory (ability to hold and manipulate information in your mind).\n\nOrthographic coding (ability to form, store and recall letters, numbers and symbols).\n\nLanguage processing.\n\nConceptualization.\n\nOrganization.\n\nBecause of this, dysgraphia is somewhat of a catch-all term to diagnose issues with writing and can be difficult to diagnose.\n\nDysgraphia generally appears when children are first learning to write. This is called developmental dysgraphia. People can also develop dysgraphia suddenly after some type of head or brain trauma. This is called acquired dysgraphia.\n\nDysgraphia is considered a “specific learning disorder” — more specifically, a “specific learning disorder in written expression.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Policy\n\nIs dysgraphia a form of dyslexia?\n\nDyslexia and dysgraphia are two distinct neurological conditions, though they’re easy to confuse because they share symptoms and often occur together.\n\nDyslexia is a learning difference that makes it harder for people to learn to read. If you have dyslexia, you may read more slowly or have trouble recognizing words. Often, people with dyslexia read at a lower level than expected. People with dyslexia may struggle to break words into sounds or relate letters to sounds when reading.\n\nDysgraphia involves difficulty with the act of writing. Difficulties can range from issues with physically writing words to issues with organizing and expressing thoughts in written form.\n\nIs dysgraphia a form of autism?\n\nDysgraphia isn’t a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Though dysgraphia commonly occurs in people with autism, you can have dysgraphia without having autism.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by:\n\nDifficulties in social communication differences.\n\nDeficits in social interactions.\n\nRestricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities.\n\nSensory problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho does dysgraphia affect?\n\nDysgraphia can affect children and adults. As with many neurodevelopmental conditions, dysgraphia is more common in children assigned male at birth (AMAB) than in children assigned female at birth (AFAB).\n\nYou’re more likely to have dysgraphia if other family members also have it, and dysgraphia is common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nHow common is dysgraphia?\n\nDysgraphia is common. Researchers estimate that 5% to 20% of people have dysgraphia. The estimated range is large because dysgraphia often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.\n\nHow is dysgraphia diagnosed?\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) includes dysgraphia under the “specific learning disorder” category, but doesn’t define it as a separate disorder and doesn’t have specific criteria for diagnosis. This can make dysgraphia difficult — but not impossible — to diagnose.\n\nSimilar to the assessment process for dyslexia, an assessment for dysgraphia involves careful consideration of your child’s:\n\nLearning strengths and weaknesses.\n\nEducational history.\n\nThe extent of their writing difficulties.\n\nThe type of writing difficulties they’re having.\n\nWhat impact targeted teaching therapy (remediation) and support has had on their current academic achievement levels.\n\nThe diagnosis of dysgraphia is typically made in an educational setting by a team assessment, which can include the following specialists:\n\nOccupational therapists.\n\nPhysical therapists.\n\nSpecial education teachers.\n\nEducational psychologists.\n\nSpeech therapists.\n\nNeuropsychologists.\n\nWhen should my child be tested for dysgraphia?\n\nTypically, early testing is best for learning differences. Your child can learn new writing strategies sooner when dysgraphia is diagnosed early. Depending on how your child is affected by dysgraphia, they may show signs of the condition as early as 5 years old or as late as young adulthood.\n\nAs writing demands in school increase with age, it’s important to diagnose dysgraphia as early as possible. It’s also important to remember that it’s never too late to get a diagnosis and help.\n\nYour child’s school may recommend an evaluation for learning disabilities with a certified educational psychologist. Ask the school administration for help finding one available to you.\n\nWhat tests will be done to diagnose dysgraphia?\n\nThere’s no medical testing required or available for diagnosing dysgraphia. Instead, healthcare providers and education specialists carefully assess your child’s writing difficulties to make a diagnosis.\n\nHealthcare providers may use the following assessments and tests in the diagnostic process:\n\nFormalized handwriting assessments: These tests can help measure the speed and legibility of your child’s writing.\n\nBeery Developmental Test of Visuomotor Integration (VMI): This test helps assess the extent to which your child can integrate their visual and motor skills, which is necessary for writing.\n\nThese tests don’t assess all the possible aspects of dysgraphia, so your child’s education team will likely rely on additional methods to diagnose dysgraphia. Depending on your child and their learning differences, more thorough academic testing may be done."
