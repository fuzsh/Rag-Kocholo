In fact, sentence structure is one among the most important grammatical components that acts as the foundation of a language. So here is what you need to know. In this article, you will learn what a sentence structure is and the different sentence structures. You will also find examples for every sentence structure that you can refer to. Also, try out the practice questions given.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat Do You Mean by Sentence Structure?\n\nBasic Parts and Components of a Sentence\n\nParts of a Sentence\n\nSubject\n\nPredicate\n\nComponents of a Sentence\n\nSubject\n\nVerb\n\nObject\n\nComplement\n\nAdjunct\n\nThe Different Types of Sentence Structures in English Grammar\n\nExamples of Sentence Structure\n\nSV\n\nSVO\n\nSVC\n\nSVA\n\nSVOC\n\nSVOA\n\nSVIODO\n\nASVC\n\nASVO\n\nASVIODO\n\nSVAA\n\nASVAA\n\nCheck Your Understanding of Sentence Structure\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on Sentence Structure in English\n\nWhat Do You Mean by Sentence Structure?\n\nSentence structure is a grammatical component that tells you exactly where and how each component of a sentence should be placed in order to blend and make sense. The Collins Dictionary defines sentence structure as “the grammatical arrangement of words in sentences.” In other words, the sentence structure is what defines the way a sentence will look and sound.\n\nBasic Parts and Components of a Sentence\n\nBefore we look into how sentence structure works, we will have to first learn about the basic structure of a sentence and the components that make up a sentence.\n\nParts of a Sentence\n\nA sentence, in the English language, consists of at least a subject and a predicate. In other words, a sentence should have a subject and a verb.\n\nSubject\n\nThe subject can be a noun or a pronoun that does the action.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe sun is shining.\n\nThe sky is clear.\n\nToday is Wednesday.\n\nPredicate\n\nThe verb is the action performed by the particular subject in the sentence.\n\nFor example:\n\nI love macaroni and cheese.\n\nMerin has a pet.\n\nAnusha can draw.\n\nComponents of a Sentence\n\nLike a sentence has two parts, it has five main components that make up the structure of a sentence, and they are,\n\nSubject\n\nVerb\n\nObject\n\nComplement\n\nAdjunct\n\nNow, let us look at each of these components in detail.\n\nSubject\n\nA noun that performs the action in a sentence is considered as the subject. It answers the question ‘who’ or in other words, a subject can be identified by asking the question ‘who’. A subject takes the first place in most cases, especially in declarative or assertive sentences.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe child kept crying.\n\nOur school team won the match.\n\nMy son is in the eighth grade.\n\nHard work pays.\n\nNo one came to the wedding.\n\nVerb\n\nIn every sentence the most important word can be said to be the verb. A verb shows action or activity or work done by the subject. Remember that all verbs including main verbs, helping verbs, stative verbs and action verbs come under this category. Most often, verbs appear immediately after the subject.\n\nFor example:\n\nNeena is writing a letter.\n\nIt was too dark.\n\nI feel tired.\n\nMy phone is not working.\n\nTarun’s dog ran away.\n\nObject\n\nAn object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action done by the subject. Objects are of two types and they are,\n\nDirect Object\n\nIndirect Object\n\nDirect Object\n\nA noun or pronoun that receives the action directly is the direct object in the sentence. It answers the question ‘what’. Direct objects mostly appear immediately after the verb and are the primary objects in the sentence.\n\nFor example:\n\nHarry bought a new car.\n\nMy mom made a cake.\n\nI met my friend.\n\nShe knows all the songs.\n\nWe watched a movie.\n\nIndirect Object\n\nAn indirect object is a noun or pronoun that is a secondary object. It can be identified by asking the question ‘whom’. When there is an indirect object in a sentence, it is mostly placed after the verb and before the direct object.\n\nFor example:\n\nVandhana gave Keerthana a cake.\n\nMy mom bought me a new dress.\n\nI gave him a chocolate.\n\nThey gave us coffee with breakfast.\n\nHe lent his friend a pen.\n\nComplement\n\nThe words required to complete the meaning of a sentence can be referred to as the complement of the sentence. A complement can be an adjective, a name, a position or a profession.\n\nFor example:\n\nIt grew dark.\n\nHe is a dentist.\n\nThat’s her dog, Bruno.\n\nComplements are further divided into two types based on which component it speaks about. The two types of complement are,\n\nSubject Complement\n\nObject Complement\n\nSubject Complement\n\nThe complement which expresses the quality or identity or condition of the subject is called Subject Complement.\n\nFor example:\n\nShe is a doctor.\n\nI am Sindhu.\n\nNandhu is clever.\n\nThe students are very excited.\n\nMy brother is a teacher.\n\nObject Complement\n\nThe complement which expresses the quality or identity or condition of an object is called Object Complement.\n\nFor example:\n\nThey made her angry.\n\nThe students elected Sreya the class leader.\n\nThey named their daughter, Thara.\n\nMarley met her friend, Ryan.\n\nNobody found the movie interesting.\n\nAdjunct\n\nAn adjunct is a word or a phrase that gives more information about an action, an event, a quality and so on. In short, it can be said that these words can include adverbs and adverb clauses. Adjuncts can be identified by asking questions ‘when’, ‘where’, ‘why’, ‘how’, ‘how often’ and ‘to what extent’. When using adjuncts, keep in mind that adjuncts can be used in the beginning, middle or end of the sentence and that there can be more than one adjunct in a sentence.\n\nTake a look at the following examples to understand how adjuncts can be used.\n\nYesterday, we met at the park.\n\nHe is very tired.\n\nDue to his ill-health, he could not come home for Christmas.\n\nMy father reads the newspaper everyday.\n\nThis workout routine is extremely exhausting.\n\nThe Different Types of Sentence Structures in English Grammar\n\nIn English grammar, there are a number of sentence structures that you can use to make your speech or writing sound or look a lot more organised, interesting and professional. Some of the commonly used sentence structures are as follows.\n\nSubject + Verb (SV)\n\nSubject + Verb + Object (SVO)\n\nSubject + Verb + Complement (SVC)\n\nSubject + Verb + Adjunct (SVA)\n\nSubject + Verb + Object + Complement (SVOC)\n\nSubject + Verb + Object + Adjunct (SVOA)\n\nSubject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object (SVIODO)\n\nAdjunct + Subject + Verb + Complement (ASVC)\n\nAdjunct + Subject + Verb + Object (ASVO)\n\nAdjunct + Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object (ASVIODO)\n\nSubject + Verb + Adjunct + Adjunct (SVAA)\n\nAdjunct + Subject + Verb + Adjunct + Adjunct (ASVAA)\n\nExamples of Sentence Structure\n\nLooking at examples will help you understand how each sentence structure works. So, here are a few examples for you.\n\nSV\n\nThe stars / are shining.\n\nSubject / Verb\n\nThe birds / are chirping.\n\nSubject / Verb\n\nIt / is raining.\n\nSubject / Verb\n\nSVO\n\nChildren / love / ice creams.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object\n\nNoah / does not like / bitter gourd.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object\n\nI / have / a pencil.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object\n\nSVC\n\nI / am / an Indian.\n\nSubject + Verb + Complement\n\nCarol / is / a nurse.\n\nSubject + Verb + Complement\n\nMy name / is / Gina.\n\nSubject + Verb + Complement\n\nSVA\n\nMadhu / reached / early.\n\nSubject / Verb / Adjunct\n\nAll of us / are leaving / for Tokyo.\n\nSubject / Verb / Adjunct\n\nHe / went / upstairs.\n\nSubject / Verb / Adjunct\n\nSVOC\n\nWe / lost / out cat, / Quinny.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object / Complement\n\nMy friends / make / me / happy.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object / Complement\n\nEveryone / found / the book / controversial.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object / Complement\n\nSVOA\n\nIt / is / my birthday / next month.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object / Adjunct\n\nLakshmi / reached / school / after 9 a.m.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object / Adjunct\n\nMy brother / plays / football / everyday.\n\nSubject / Verb / Object / Adjunct\n\nSVIODO\n\nThe Board / offered / me / the job.\n\nSubject / Verb / Indirect Object / Direct Object\n\nRohit / gave / Reshmi / his favourite book.\n\nSubject / Verb / Indirect Object / Direct Object\n\nNeetu / bought / herself / a hat.\n\nSubject / Verb / Indirect Object / Direct Object\n\nASVC\n\nSuddenly, / it / grew / dark.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Complement\n\nNormally, / the weather / is / good.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Complement\n\nOccassionally, / my dog / gets / restless.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Complement\n\nASVO\n\nLast week, / we / celebrated / Holi.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Object\n\nUsually, / we / get / a token.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Object\n\nEvery year, / we / visit / the orphanage.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Object\n\nASVIODO\n\nToday, / the teacher / gave / us / our papers.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Indirect Object / Direct Object\n\nYesterday, / my mom / bought / me / a bicycle.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Indirect Object / Direct Object\n\nEvery time he comes home, / my brother / gets / my mom / her favourite chocolates.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Indirect Object / Direct Object\n\nSVAA\n\nThey / go / to work / by bus.\n\nSubject / Verb / Adjunct / Adjunct\n\nWe / meet / every evening / on the way back home.\n\nSubject / Verb / Adjunct / Adjunct\n\nJancy / went / to the grocery store / last Saturday.\n\nSubject / Verb / Adjunct / Adjunct\n\nASVAA\n\nNormally, / my parents / come / by bus / to Pondicherry.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Adjunct / Adjunct\n\nLast year, / my friends and I / went / to Meghalaya / for a month.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Adjunct / Adjunct\n\nUsually, / Finn’s parents / would come / to the airport / as soon as his flight lands.\n\nAdjunct / Subject / Verb / Adjunct / Adjunct\n\nCheck Your Understanding of Sentence Structure\n\nNow that you have gone through a number of examples, apply your knowledge to identify the sentence structure of the following sentences.
