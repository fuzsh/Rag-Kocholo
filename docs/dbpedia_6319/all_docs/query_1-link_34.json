        "text": "The following titles have been mentioned in various places (most notably at the official PSB website and in their fan club publication Literally, the two main sources of the information that follows) as songs that Chris and Neil have written but haven't yet completed and/or formally released. In some cases they're early titles for songs eventually released under a different title, included here just to \"cover the bases\" since such titles are sometimes cited as unreleased tracks. I don't, however, include songs written by others that the Boys have recorded in unreleased cover versions, such as \"Homosexuality\" and \"So Long, Farewell.\"\n\nIf I've heard the song and am familiar enough with it to offer detailed commentary, a link is provided to its entry in the \"Unreleased Tracks\" section of this website. Otherwise, I offer just a few lines of what little I know about it from what I have read or have learned from others.\n\nA Roma\n\nThe early instrumental demo for \"I'm Not Scared.\" Neil recalls that he and Chris felt that it \"sounded a bit like Shannon\" (the American dance singer best known for \"Let the Music Play\"). I can't help but wonder whether the title, Italian for \"In Rome,\" was meant as a malodorous pun. It may even be punning on the fact that amyl nitrate \"poppers,\" long popular as a recreational drug, especially in the gay \"clubbing\" community, have often been advertised as \"aromas.\"\n\nAbout Time\n\nOriginally titled \"Multi-Kulti,\" Chris and Neil wrote this song in February 2011. German chancellor Angela Merkel served as its lyrical inspiration. Neil considers it \"quite a nice song,\" so chances are good it will see the light of day at some point.\n\nAdrenaline\n\nNeil composed an early version of this track in September 2020 under the title \"Suspension\" and then sent it to Chris for his input, after which it became \"Adrenaline\" (pronounced such that the last syllable rhymes with \"green\" rather than the more conventional \"grin\"). Neil says that it reminded him of Chris Isaak. Nonetheless producer James Ford later worked on it for possible inclusion on that album, but either it wasn't finished or it simply didn't make the cut.\n\nAnd I Was Like\n\nThe Boys have mentioned this song, which they worked on with producer Stuart Price, as a possible contender at one time for inclusion on Hotspot.\n\nAny Longer\n\nMentioned as an unreleased song in the 2020 edition of Annually. They began writing it in late November 2017. Nothing else is known about it at this time.\n\nBack On Everything\n\nNeil once alluded to an unreleased song by this name—or perhaps just an unreleased lyric he'd written to which music hadn't yet been applied—when describing how he had decided to use the title phrase repeatedly in the lyrics of \"Positive Role Model.\" The fact that he did decide to repurpose that line greatly decreases the chances of this song ever being completed and released.\n\nBackburner\n\nThe name of this unreleased track initially struck me as a placeholder (because this recording is, for the time being, on the \"backburner,\" awaiting further development) until Chris and Neil can come up with something permanent. Then again, Chris Heath in his book Pet Shop Boys, Literally records an incident in which the Boys' friend Janet Street-Porter uses the word \"backburner\" in a sentence, at which point Neil perks up and says that he'd like to write a song with that title. It's very important to note that a track titled \"Back Burner\" seemingly attributed to the Pet Shop Boys has turned up online, but that this is not the actual PSB track; rather, it's an extremely clever \"construction\" created by someone using samples of Neil's voice and Auto-Tune (or something like it).\n\nBalkan Beats\n\nOriginally an instrumental track composed by Chris around the time he and Neil were working on Elysium, it soon evolved into the song \"Hell\" when Neil realized that a concept and lyrics he was separately working on might go well with Chris's composition.\n\nBall Starts Rolling\n\nA song the Boys wrote and demoed in Spring 2011.\n\nBaroq\n\nBarry\n\nChris composed and recorded the basic backing track for a song by this title in December 2011.\n\nBeautiful Beast\n\nAn early and \"quite funny\" song (\"totally camp nonsense\" according to Neil) that hasn't yet been completed. The Boys wrote it around the same time they recorded \"Love Comes Quickly.\" It includes the line \"Then you caught me there within your snare, you beautiful beast.\" Their former manager Tom Watkins even mentions it in his 2016 memoir Let's Make Lots of Money (we all know, of course, where he got that title), where he cites an incident circa 1984-85 in which \"Neil and Chris were driving around in Dave Ambrose's car, playing him a couple of new songs they'd written. Dave liked 'Beautiful Beast', a campy travesty the world was never to hear.\" (Ambrose was an A&R man for EMI who signed the Boys to Parlophone in early 1985.)\n\nBeautiful Mistake\n\nDescribed by the Boys as \"Latin\" in style, \"a party tune\" that they worked on during the Hotspot sessions. It was originally titled \"FrÃ¼hling,\" the German word for spring (as in the season of the year).\n\nBefore My Time\n\nAlmost nothing is known about this track aside from the fact that Neil and Chris wrote it in April 1998 and that, in Neil's words, it \"was meant to sound like Air\" (a somewhat arty French synth duo). A supposed demo instrumental version has been floating around on the Internet for years, but from all indications that track is not by the Pet Shop Boys. Another alleged demo identified as \"Before My Time\" surfaced in late 2009, but it turned out actually to be the instrumental track for the 1986 release \"Innocent Love\" by the German singer Sandra.*\n\n*I'm both fascinated and repulsed by the fact that somebody at some point must have made the conscious decision to take a recording that they knew full well wasn't by the Pet Shop Boys, attach the documented name of an unreleased Tennant-Lowe song, and then foist it off on others as an unreleased PSB demo. If they did it in an attempt to make money, it's certainly contemptible but at least understandable. But if they did it with no profit motive in mind but simply to derive some sort of perverse pleasure over having deceived other people, then that seems almost incomprehensible. In fact, it makes sense to me only if I think of it as an expression of pure, naked evil, albeit of a remarkably petty natureâsort of a mosquito Hitler.\n\nBig Piano\n\nBounce\n\nBouncing Off the Walls\n\nA track, \"essentially an instrumental\" although Neil recorded vocals for it, composed in 2020 for the Boys' planned musical Naked (based on Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Emperor's New Clothes\").\n\nBubadubadubadum (aka \"All My Wasted Time\")\n\nBuggered If I Know\n\nLittle is known about this track except that it apparently stems from the Nightlife period and, according to Neil, \"starts off with something like Elgar and was intended by Chris to sound like Divine.\"\n\nCan I Be the One?\n\nThis track eventually became \"Love Life.\"\n\nCasanova in Love\n\nVirtually nothing is known about this reported track, although it seems extremely likely that it's an early version of the song that became \"Casanova in Hell.\"\n\nA Change Is as Good as a Rest\n\nNeil composed lyrics, which he described as \"quite sad,\" for a prospective song by this title during the 2018 sessions for Hotspot. They later became the basis for an unreleased song called \"Traveling\" (see below).\n\nChina\n\nThe Boys wrote this in mid-April 2005. No other information is available at this time aside from the fact that, perhaps aptly inspired, they immediately afterward had a Chinese dinner with Gary Barlow.\n\nCirco Loco\n\nA 2014 demo by Chris that evolved into \"Pazzo!\"\n\nCloud-Dweller\n\nThis song from November 2014âwhich Chris has described as \"trance-yâ¦ a bit like Patrick Cowley\" and \"probably not very good\"âborrows its title from a phrase used by Joseph Stalin in disdainful, dismissive reference to writer Boris Pasternak, meaning someone (to use the common English-language metaphor) \"with his head in the clouds.\"\n\nCollector's Item\n\nAgain from the Super period, originally an electroclash track titled \"Punk\" that with changes in style and lyrics evolved into \"Into Thin Air.\" (Among the original lyrics, which the Boys have described as satirical, were \"Collector's item, suitable for framing.\") Apparently, however, even after \"Into Thin Air,\" enough distinct material remained unused that they could resume working on a song with this same title a few years later during the Hotspot sessions.\n\nCover Me in Chamomile\n\nA brief fragment sung by Frances Barber, in the role of Billie Trix, in performances of the one-woman stage show Musik. Not yet a \"complete\" song, Barber said (in response to an audience member's question during a post-show Q&A) that Neil had sung the fragment to her during a visit to her home, after which it was added to the show.\n\nThe Day Before Tomorrow\n\nWritten during the Fundamental sessions, this track underwent a good deal of evolution and a number of title changes (including \"Introduction\") before Neil and Chris eventually settled on \"God Willing.\"\n\nDead of Night\n\nThis has sometimes been cited as an unreleased Tennant-Lowe song, but it's probably not really \"unreleased\" at all. Rather, it's almost certainly an early \"demo name\" for what became \"Jealousy\" (\"At dead of night, when strangers roam .\").\n\nDirty Tricks\n\nWritten while visiting Naples in early March 2005.\n\nDon't Ask Me\n\nThey recorded a demo with this name at Ray Roberts's Camden studio in 1984 around the same time they composed \"Rent.\" A recording purporting to be this track (but titled \"Don't Ask Me Why\") has surfaced online. Maybe it's authentic, but I wouldn't bet on it. It's possible the vocalist is a young, less experienced Neil, but I've heard AI simulations that sound more like him. And something about the music doesn't strike me as PSB—not even embryonic PSB.\n\nDon't Go\n\nNot a cover of the Yazoo hit from 1982, but an original composed by Chris in 2014. The Boys recorded a demo of it in Berlin that November.\n\nA Dream\n\nThe Boys wrote and worked on this song, an early version of \"Inside a Dream,\" in December 2011 during their demoing sessions leading up to the recording of Elysium.\n\nDreaming\n\nWritten in March 2008. Neil and Chris professed in mid-2009 to remembering nothing about it aside from a brief reference in Neil's diary.\n\nThe Enigma\n\nEven\n\nA song written in early 2008, which the Boys seriously considered incorporating into The Most Incredible Thing. Whether they actually did is uncertain at this point.\n\nEvery Little Moment\n\nAn early alternate title sometimes cited for the song that became \"For Every Moment.\"\n\nFaster\n\nBMI records list a song by this title composed by Tennant, Lowe, and Carl Craig, an American DJ/producer who remixed \"Inner Sanctum\" for the Boys. No further information is currently available about this unreleased track.\n\nFat Northern Bastards\n\nChris proposed recording this humorous song with UK TV/radio/recording personalities Ant and Dec. A very brief excerpt can be heard on the About Pet Shop Boys double-disc set released to their fan club members in the late 1990s. Chris says there that it includes a sample lifted from the Beach Boys' \"Barbara Ann\"—the \"ba-ba-ba\" vocal—which then morphs into the word \"bastards.\" The Boys seem quite fond of it, but I'll be surprised if it's ever officially released.\n\nFormer Children\n\nA song from early 2015 that has also been referred to simply as \"Children\" as well as the completely different \"Gramophone\" (see below). Neil has said that lyrically it's \"about how we're all former children.\"\n\nFranglais\n\nThis song was reportedly \"written around the time [the Boys] were still trying to rip-off the group Air's sound.\"\n\nFriendship\n\nA lyric that Neil had written around 2007, possibly never set to music—that is, not until he and Chris decided to use at least part of it as new lyrics for their \"Possibly More Mix\" of \"Did You See Me Coming?\"\n\nFuneral\n\nThe Boys wrote this track for their musical Naked in late January 2021.\n\nGet On It\n\nRecorded in April 1995 during the Bilingual sessions, but left unfinished. The Boys were considering it as a track for Ian Wright. \"It's really good, that one,\" noted Chris.\n\nGet Over It\n\nNot surprisingly (considering the final lyrics), an early working title for \"Legacy,\" which Neil and Chris worked on in early 2008.\n\nGive Me the Moonlight\n\nReportedly an early title for the song that ultimately evolved into \"Delusions of Grandeur,\" inspired by the fact that the chord progression is based on Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. It's possible—though by no means certain—that the title may also have been a nod to British singer Frankie Vaughan's big 1955 hit \"Give Me the Moonlight, Give Me the Girl,\" which became his signature tune.\n\nGramophone\n\nThis song, written in February 2015 and worked on early the following month, was originally titled \"Former Children,\" although there are suggestions that the Boys may have shifted the title back to its original.\n\nThe Grind 2\n\nThe title assigned by the Boys to their demo recording of a piece of music that opened Act 3 their ballet The Most Incredible Thing. This demo, however, had a \"world premiere\" of its own in early July 2010 as an audio component of \"Room Divider,\" a group exhibition of new works at the Wilkinson Gallery in London. In a modified form it eventually came to be titled \"Back to the Grind.\"\n\nHe Dreamed of Machines\n\nHeads Will Roll\n\nChris and Neil wrote this song in February 2011. It was considered a candidate for inclusion on Elysium (co-producer Andrew Dawson was, in Neil's words, \"rather keen\" on it), but they were unable to finish the recording of it on time. As late as 2017 it still remained unfinished.\n\nHeaven Is a Playground (aka simply as \"Heaven\")\n\nAn early version of \"Leaving\" with a different chorus and lyrics that Neil and Chris worked on in January and February 2010.\n\nHello Hello\n\nNeil's diary (as revealed in the January 2013 issue of Literally) noted that he and Chris had worked on a song by this name in the autumn of 2011, although they profess to remember nothing at all about it. \"It's obviously changed its name,\" says Neil.\n\nHe's Not Coming Home\n\nDemoed by the Boys in Berlin in November 2014, beginning with a piece that had been composed by Chris on the piano. They've described it as a \"very, very sad\" song that apparently concerns someone murdered by stabbing.\n\nHey Tito\n\nVirtually no information has been released about this track aside from its simple yet cryptic title and the fact that the Boys apparently wrote it in the late 1990s.\n\nHolding Back\n\nBMI records list a song by this title composed by Neil and Chris, and it appears on a cassette demo tape held by Neil in their 2024 BBC Imagine documentary, but no other information is available at this time.\n\nHome\n\nThe original title of the song that appeared on the album Release as \"Here.\" It was written for their musical Closer to Heaven but dropped. \"Home\" actually seems like a better title than \"Here,\" but Neil and Chris probably made the change on account of the inclusion of the song \"Home and Dry\" on Release as well.\n\nHope\n\nProbably written solely by Chris, this was to have been another recording with Ian Wright, a follow-up to \"Do the Right Thing.\" But it was never completed.\n\nHow Did I Get Here? / How Do I Dance?\n\nAlthough this 2021 song—alternately referred to both of the titles shown here—underwent lyrical and multiple title changes to become \"Why Am I Dancing?\" the Boys apparently still plan on using it in a slower ballad form (and surely with different lyrics) in their musical Naked. Considering the way that musicals often reprise songs, it's even possible that both titles will show up in the final score.\n\nHow Lucky I Am\n\nComposed in its original form during the Bilingual sessionsâand on occasion referred to with the slightly altered title \"How Lucky Am I?\"âthis song evolved several years later into \"The Night I Fell in Love.\"\n\nI Can Always Rely on You to Let Me Down\n\nThe Boys started work on this song in the mid- or late eighties, around the same time as \"It's a Sin,\" but apparently haven't yet finished it. But they like it well enough (it's \"a funny, catchy one\") that they haven't given up on the prospect of finalizing and recording it. By his own admission, Neil is especially keen on completing and releasing it at some point, often suggesting that they do so.\n\nI Dream of a Better Tomorrow\n\nComposed and demoed in January 2021 for their planned musical Naked.\n\nI Need You\n\nI'm not even 100% sure that this is the actual title, but a brief segment of its demo played during a PSB radio documentary in the late 1990s. The only words were Neil singing \"I need youah, ah, ah, ah.\" He described it as \"very eighties-sounding,\" to which Chris rejoined, \"I always liked that.\" He then added, \"I don't think we're eighties enough!\"\n\nI'm in Love with a Woman\n\nAn early song that the Boys had written for a duo who called themselves \"The Hudsons,\" of which their manager at the time, Tom Watkins, was a member. Watkins had apparently suggested the title, which he thought would be terrific (and somewhat risquÃ©) for a \"gay disco record.\" But after Chris and Neil had at least partly written the song, Watkins changed his mind about it. So they decided to repurpose the music and the \"Passion, love, sex, moneyâ¦\" bit from the original song, turning them into \"Paninaro.\"\n\nI'm Keeping My Fingers Crossed\n\nA very early Tennant/Lowe song, written pre-fame, that Neil says had \"the same umba-umba rhythm\" as New Order's \"Blue Monday\"only the Boys had written it before they had ever heard that song. As a result, hearing \"Blue Monday\" for the first time made Neil, as he puts it, \"a bit depressed.\" In fact, as Neil notes in a brief segment on the DVD The New Order Story, he told Chris that they should simply give up working on it because New Order had, in effect, beat them to the punch. So this song was never actually completed. (The title, incidentally, is often reported as \"Keeping My Fingers Crossed,\" without the initial \"I'm.\" The Boys themselves have apparently referred to it both ways.)\n\nI'm Not Crying, I'm Laughing\n\nWritten in March and April 2008 during the Yes sessions, this song evolved into \"All Over the World,\" though the final lyric and melody are completely different. \"It had the same introduction,\" according to Neil, adding, \"the 'oh-way-oh-oh-way-oh' was all there.\" But along the way he and Chris decided it was \"utter rubbish,\" so they scrapped it and used much of the backing track for the new song.\n\nIce Remembers\n\nChris composed a piece he titled \"Complexity\" in early 2021. After Neil got a hold of it, it became \"Ice Remembers,\" of which he said, \"I love this track.\" That bodes well for its future.\n\nIf Anyone Can, the Action Man Can\n\nEarly in the Nightlife sessions Chris had suggested that he and Neil should write an \"answer song\" in response to the 1997 hit \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua. So they began working on a musical tribute to the late sixties and early seventies cartoon/action figure Action Man, a licensed copy of the American \"G.I. Joe,\" renamed as appropriate for the U.K. market—in essence, a \"Barbie for boys.\" But Neil and Chris avowedly found the end result too embarrassing to release. (See? – They really aren't \"Shameless\" after all!) Instead they repurposed some of the music into what eventually become \"I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More.\" A short snippet, however, of the original track—its title phrase about Action Man—wound up in a couple of officially unreleased David Morales \"I Don't Know…\" remixes.\n\nImagine\n\nBMI records list a song by this title composed by Neil and Chris, but given the famed John Lennon song it seems unlikely the Boys would assign the same title to one of their own compositions. It's possible it could be an alternate title for \"In His Imagination,\" but that seems unlikely since the same BMI records list that title as well. So this remains a mystery for the time being.\n\nIn the Club or in the Queue\n\nIndie\n\nAn early demo of \"Up Against It.\" This was almost certainly never seriously considered as the final title and was probably only used by the Boys to refer to the instrumental track before Neil had written lyrics for it.\n\nIt's Up to You\n\nA primarily instrumental track from the recording sessions for Very that the Boys by their own admission \"struggled with.\" They overcame their difficulties by merging it with another, much older unfinished song to turn it into \"One in a Million.\"\n\nKing of Pop\n\nA title that Neil and Chris used for \"King of Rome\" for a while in early 2008. They first wrote it as \"King of Rome,\" retitled it \"King of Pop,\" and ultimately returned to its original title. Speaking before Michael Jackson's death, Neil conceded that he \"was thinking what a tragic figure Michael Jackson is, endlessly roaming the world.\" As prescient as that is, the Boys are probably quite glad that they decided against using this title and taking the song in that direction.\n\nKing's Lament\n\nAn instrumental segment composed by the Boys for the second staging in 2012 of their ballet The Most Incredible Thing. It has been described by the orchestrator, Sven Helbig, as \"four minutes of desperate orchestra music,\" and its melody is reportedly a variation on that of the released ballet track \"Help Me.\" Although it has of course been heard by those who have attended the live ballet in its \"rejiggered\" form, this particular piece has yet to be released in any recorded format.\n\nLife's Hard\n\nEven the title of this one is uncertain. In Chris Heath's book Pet Shop Boys, Literally Neil briefly describes this very early number: \"Our first Bobby O-influenced song.\" Part of the lyrics go—\n\nLife's hard\n\nIt's all you've got\n\nAnd all you get\n\nIs a broken heart\n\nLimbo\n\nChris and Neil worked on this song in December 2000. Neil has described it as \"really good track but it's only half-finished.\"\n\nLittle Boy Lost\n\nNeil has mentioned this as an unreleased song from which he took the line \"So afraid, plays the machines in the arcade\" for \"Birthday Boy.\" For this reason it will now probably never be completed and released.\n\nThe Living Daylights (aka \"James Bond Instrumental #2\")\n\nLiving in a Lonely Time\n\nThe Boys—apparently Neil mostly, though Chris will undoubtedly have input if he hasn't already—wrote a song with this title in late 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Chris said that \"it sounds like Gilbert O'Sullivan,\" which Neil took as a compliment. Neil added that he \"can imagine Cher singing it.\"\n\nLiving Legends\n\nA track dating back to the eighties, described as \"elegiac but danceable\" with \"a really gorgeous tune.\" It was at one time a serious candidate for inclusion on Behaviour. The Boys decided against finishing it in its original form, however, because it employed a \"list of famous names\" device, but Madonna then beat them to the punch with \"Vogue.\" Neil has stated that it subsequently \"turned into\" \"A Red Letter Day.\"\n\nLooking for Love\n\nThe Boys recorded two demos of a song by this name in 1984 at Ray Roberts's Camden studio.\n\nLoop #125\n\nThe \"placeholder title\" for an early version of \"KDX 125,\" recorded as a demo in 1992.\n\nLove and War\n\nFirst recorded in Glasgow as a demo while the Boys were writing songs in 1989-90 for Behaviour. Chris and Neil worked some more on it several years later during the Bilingual sessions, but as of November 2003 (when Neil answered a fan question about it on the official website) they still hadn't finished it. \"But,\" Neil added, \"we probably will one day.\" On another occasion he described it as \"a rock song\" and said that he has always imagined Canadian rocker Bryan Adams singing it. Included among the lyrics are the lines \"Now you know the score / That all is fair in love and war / And this is a war.â They've thought well enough of its prospects to go ahead and register it with BMI.\n\nLove Letters\n\nCo-written and recorded with David Morales in 1998 during the Nightlife sessions, using the same backup singers as \"New York City Boy,\" a song with this title is registered with BMI.\n\nLove Your Enemy\n\nReportedly somewhat in the style of Massive Attack, this track has been described by the Boys as having \"really nice string bit and such a loose feel that you don't want to do anything with it to spoil it.\" Their first attempt to record it was in April 1995, but it apparently remains unfinished to this day.\n\nLullaby\n\nOriginally titled \"Theme,\" the Boys wrote this in 2020 for their planned musical Naked.\n\nMaking Waves\n\nA still-unfinished song that the Boys began writing in June 2011 while touring with Take That.\n\nA Man from the Future\n\nMelancholy Melody\n\nSimply Chris playing an original melody on the piano, recorded \"live\" on a cassette recorder. It lasts a little less than 2½ minutes. The title is undoubtedly a placeholder.\n\nThe Memory and the Control\n\nMethod in Your Madness\n\nComposed in February 2015 during the Super sessions, Neil noted that this song was a strong candidate for inclusion on their next album, although that was not to be the case. Its lyrics are adapted from old, unused ones written by Neil way back in 1983. They've said it's very \"poppy\" (as Neil put it, \"in the Taylor Swift range\") and sounds like \"Pandemonium, Part 2.\"\n\nMid-life Crisis\n\nMoronic\n\nAn instrumental written by Chris in January 2008. He titled it \"Moronic\" because, in his own words, \"it is.\" It eventually evolved into \"The Grind,\" an early segment of The Most Incredible Thing. As Chris said in the July 2009 issue of Literally, \"It worked because it's during the daily grind of everyone's existence in this town [the setting of the ballet's storyline], so the moronic quality fitted the daily drudge.\"\n\nMunich\n\nAn instrumental composed by Chris in his Munich hotel room (hence the title) during the Boys' 2011 tour with Take That. A few years later, he and Neil decided to use it as the musical foundation for the song that became \"The Pop Kids.\"\n\nMy Side of the Story\n\nParty written in 2007 as a possible submission to Madonna. The Boys worked on it some more in April 2008, but as late as 2017 it has remained unfinished. They seem to think quite highly of it, however, so chances are good that they'll complete it at some point. It includes a reference to \"sex [sic] o'clock in America\" as well as the lines:\n\nI used to have a boyfriend\n\nHe used to have a girlfriend\n\nNobody ever understood\n\nMy side of the story\n\nThe Naked Truth\n\nComposed in late January 2021 for Naked.\n\nNaseem\n\nBack during the Bilingual era, Chris mentioned that he had recorded an instrumental track to which he had given the interim title \"Naseem\" because he was inspired at the time to try to finagle recording with U.K. professional boxer \"Prince\" Naseem Hamad. Chris described it as \"all drums… very tribal.\"\n\nNatural Wonders Every Child Should Know\n\nNearly But Not Quite\n\nI know nothing about this reported Tennant-Lowe track aside from its title.\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nStarting out as \"Say It Again,\" the Boys wrote and demoed this song, which Neil describes as \"quite nice,\" in mid-2020.\n\nThe Next Big Thing\n\nNeil has mentioned this as a song that he and Chris wrote with Xenomania during the 2008 Yes sessions. He describes it as \"actually quite good,\" so it may yet appear at some point. The chorus goes, \"Something tells me, baby, you're the next best thing….\" (That's a [sic] on \"best\" as opposed to \"big\" according to Literally 34.)\n\nNight and the City\n\nA song that the Boys wrote in the spring of 2011 following Neil's inspiration from having just watched the 1950 film noir of the same name.\n\nNo One's Got Nothing to Hide\n\nWritten in early 2021 for Naked, this song's double negative apparently isn't a grammatical flaw but an intentional, accurate statement meaning that everyone has something to hide.\n\nThe Noise\n\nNothing's Gonna Change My Love for You\n\nChris mentioned this title to an interviewer in late 1989 as belonging to a song that he and Neil had recently written. But then Neil immediately chimed in to say that another was titled \"I Should Be So Lucky.\" Considering that was the title of a fairly recent major U.K. hit by Kylie Minogue, it's enough to make one suspect they may have been having a little joke at the interviewer's expense.\n\nNu Sleaze (sometimes alternately written Nu-sleaze)\n\nPrimarily a \"Chris track\" in a swingbeat styleâapparently Chris sings lead in the verses, though Neil sings the chorusâthis was recorded during the Nightlife sessions. Originally titled \"Get Up On It,\" it took George Michael's \"Fastlove\" phrase \"Gotta get up to get down\" and reversed it, stating \"You've got to get down to get up.\" But the Boys never got around to finishing it. Although they had considered releasing it as a bonus track with the 2017 reissue of Nightlife, Chris vetoed its inclusion. But he decided that he liked the chorus enough to repurpose it for their Super track \"Burn.\"\n\nOh, Dear (aka \"Walking Down the High Street\")\n\nOne Day We'll Be Free\n\nAn early title for \"Discoteca.\"\n\nOnly in His Death\n\nOnly Love\n\nOnly Lovers\n\nAn early instrumental demo version of \"Dreaming of the Queen,\" recorded in 1992.\n\nThe Opera\n\nMentioned as unreleased in the January 2013 issue of Literally, quite possibly the same song as one that Neil had previously spoken of titled \"We're Not Going to the Opera\" (see below).\n\nOther Ranks\n\nOther Things\n\nUnfortunately I don't know anything about this one aside from its reported title.\n\nThe Out Crowd\n\nAn early title for a song, started in February 2011 and worked on during the following summer, that evolved into \"Hell.\" The title, however, was repurposed and surfaced once again during the Super sessions, this time applied to a different \"techno-y\" that had previously been titled \"Fruit and Flowers.\" The lyrics, according to Neil, are a takeoff on the pop classic \"The In Crowd,\" which went \"I'm in with the in crowd.\" In this case, however, it's about going \"out with the out crowd.\"\n\nPandering\n\nA song written in February 2008, during their Yes writing sessions.\n\nParticle\n\nPedal\n\nAn instrumental written in January 2008 that Chris has described as being \"adventurous musically.\" At one time the Boys alluded to it possibly going into The Most Incredible Thing, although whether it actually made it into the score remains to be seen.\n\nPet Shop Noise\n\nAn unreleased instrumental the Boys recorded in 1984 with their first producer, Bobby \"O\" Orlando. Despite the similarity in titles, it's completely different from the released track \"Pet Shop Boys.\" And although it is fundamentally an instrumental, it does include lines spoken by Neilâexcerpts of lyrics from other unreleased songs that he and Chris had already written at the time.\n\nPlaying Hard to Get\n\nThe Postman, He Delivers\n\nApparently also from the Nightlife sessions, little is known about this track aside from its wonderfully salacious title.\n\nPunk\n\nAn early descriptive \"placeholder title\" for an electroclash track that evolved first into \"Collector's Item\" (see above) and ultimately \"Into Thin Air.\"\n\nPutin's Underpants\n\nThe Boys wrote a song with this bizarre title (could it be anything but a political satire?) in early December 2022, developing it from \"Bass,\" a demo created by Chris. Neil told an interviewer for the German magazine Musikexpress that \"It's just a rough demo so far, we're still working on it. It's about Putin in his underpants, about his secrets, but also about the poisoned underpants that almost became [Alexei] Navalny's undoing in 2020.\" Chris then noted that he loved what Navalny said in court about how Putin would \"go down in history\" as \"Vladimir the underpants poisoner.\"\n\nRandom\n\nWritten by Neil and Chris with Xenomania in early 2008 during the incredibly productive Yes sessions, but apparently left unfinished.\n\nRevelation\n\nAn intermediary stage between \"Where the Wild Things Are\" and \"More Than a Dream.\"\n\nRich in Paradise\n\nA song that Chris mentioned in early 2016 as one that he was working on at the time. He had left himself a reminder on his smartphone to \"write a vocal melody\" for it.\n\nThe Road Not Taken\n\nThe Boys' setting to music of one of American poet Robert Frost's best-known poems, published in 1916. It's among the songs they've composed so far as part of a prospective project of setting poems to music \"for schoolchildren to sing.\"\n\nRoom with a View\n\nBMI records list a song by this title composed by Neil and Chris—or, more accurately, those records actually read \"Room with a Viewer\" (my emphasis), but that seems a likely error unless our musical heroes decided to write a song about a voyeur.\n\nRough with the Smooth\n\nDeveloped from a track titled \"Crafty\" composed by Chris in 2020, this song is slated for their musical Naked.\n\nSatisfaction Guaranteed\n\n\"A quick dance track\" that Chris worked on in November 2000, during the Release sessions. (It's possible, however, that this is not a PSB original but rather a cover of an old Gamble-Huff song recorded by Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes back in 1973.)\n\n7/4\n\nA still incomplete track, with only this working title derived from the fact that it's written in 7/4 time. Not much else is known about it, but it's almost certainly not a \"dance track.\" (Have you ever tried to dance to music in 7/4 time?) Could this, however, be an ancestor of one of the tracks in their Battleship Potemkin film score (\"Comrades!\" and \"Odessa\") written in seven-time?\n\nShame\n\nAn early version of \"To Step Aside.\"\n\nSick\n\nThe name Chris assigned to a backing track he began working on in February 2011. It quickly evolved into \"Memory of the Future.\"\n\nSooner or Later\n\nAn erroneous title supplied by Bobby \"O\" Orlando for \"Later Tonight,\" an early version of which the Boys recorded with him in 1984.\n\nThe Spell Is Broken\n\nAlternately referred to as \"A Spell Is Broken,\" Neil added lyrics in February 2021 to a \"moody\" older composition by Chris titled \"The Garden of Proserpine\" with plans on using it in their musical Naked.\n\nStick It On aka Smash Hits aka Six Free Stickers aka Six Little Stickers\n\nThis brief track, originally demoed in 1984 at Ray Roberts's Camden studio, surfaced in March 1985, after they had recorded and released the original Bobby O-produced version of \"West End Girls\" but before they recorded and released the big international hit version produced by Stephen Hague. It served as a radio commercial for Smash Hits magazine, where Neil was still working at the time. Apparently the first music written by Neil and Chris for which they earned any money, it can be heard in the 1996 BBC radio documentary About Pet Shop Boys, which was later released as a limited-edition CD for the official fan club. It could be heard again on the 2012 BBC Radio 4 broadcast \"Neil Tennant's Smash Hits Christmas.\" It has also appeared on YouTube and elsewhere online.\n\nSugar Man\n\nDeveloped from a demo by Chris called \"Down the Pub,\" Neil added lyrics in March 2021 to create this new song. Neil describes it as \"a good song\" that he and Chris nevertheless don't feel is a good fit for them. They would prefer a female singer to record it.\n\nTalk to Me\n\nA song with this title appears on a PSB demo tape held by Neil in the 2024 BBC Imagine documentary.\n\nTeddy Bear\n\nNeil worked on this song in late 2022, describing it as \"a sort of Phil Collins-esque ballad\" that's indeed about a teddy bear. As of early 2024, Chris apparently hadn't yet had a crack at it.\n\nTelegraph Boy\n\nThis rather scandalous track written by Neil and Chris in the late 1990s allegedly concerns \"telegram deliverers supplementing income as rent boys.\" It's unknown whether it has anything to do (except perhaps as an initial inspiration) with the infamous 1889 Cleveland Street scandal that rocked Victorian London, in which male prostitutes, working as telegraph messengers, were discovered to be providing \"illicit services\" to aristocratic clients, some of them with government connections. Given Neil's penchant for history, however, it wouldn't be all that surprising.\n\nThick as Thieves\n\nOriginally bearing the placeholder title of \"Fragment,\" this song was written and demoed by the Boys while they were working on songs for Elysium.\n\nThoughts Are Free\n\nThe Boys' setting of a German poem, \"Die Gedanken sind frei,\" that dates back at least to the early 1800s. (It has previously been set to music and has long served as a German folk songâwith both the poet and composer unknownâbut the new PSB music is original.) They worked on it in November 2011, again during their writing sessions for Elysium, although they envisioned it as part of their aforementioned project of putting various poems to music.\n\nThe Track That Wasn't\n\nApparently an early title for the brief track on Please that ultimately was released as \"Opportunities (Reprise).\"\n\nTraveling\n\nA song that avowedly \"sounds like [the band] Snow Patrol.\" Neil and Chris worked on this track, originally titled \"A Change Is as Good as a Rest,\" during the 2018 Hotspot sessions.\n\nThe Trial\n\nTwisted\n\nThough sharing a title with the classic Lambert, Hendricks, & Ross jazz-vocal song from the 1950s (later famously covered by Joni Mitchell), this is instead a PSB original composed by Chris in late January 2015. It sounds as though it's still an instrumental for which Neil hasn't yet supplied any lyrics.\n\nUnbelievable Scenes\n\nThe Boys reportedly wrote this in 1998 with a view toward offering it to Robbie Williams, but never finished it. They resurrected it in January 2005, at which time it began to evolve into \"Fugitive.\"\n\n\"Unreleased Demo\" (two different ones)\n\nOn October 13, 2022, the Boys posted in Instagram and on Facebook a brief (less than two-minute) wordless video showing scenes of their approach and entry into Seattle while on their Unity Tour. Its background music was what they themselves labeled an \"unreleased demo\"—a \"poppy\" but bass-heavy and somewhat repetitive instrumental. Nothing else is known of this track at this time, including when they actually wrote and recorded it. That is, is it something they'd had \"lying around\" for some time and decided finally to make use of in this way (perhaps feeling that otherwise it had little long-term potential), or was it a brand new composition? I suspect the former, but only they could answer that question for certain.\n\nOn November 17, 2023, they did it again, this time using Instagram to show a street scene in Mexico City, where they had recently arrived for a pair of upcoming concert performances. Once more it was a brief, uptempo, synth-heavy instrumental segment about which they provided no additional information.\n\nUprising\n\nAn instrumental composed by Chris in January 2021 for Naked.\n\nWaiting\n\nLike \"Dreamland,\" this unreleased song was written with Olly Alexander, but remained unfinished at least as of early 2020. As a means of describing it, the Boys have said it's \"from our chill-out album.\"\n\nA Wall\n\nAn early title for the song that became \"Building a Wall.\"\n\nWallish Walls\n\nA most curiously titled unreleased song mentioned in Annually 2020, named, according to Neil, after a place in County Durham in northern England. The Boys were working on it in early 2018.\n\nWe're Not Going to the Opera (aka \"The Opera\")\n\nPSB apparently worked on this song with co-producer Andrew Dawson during the sessions for Elysium, but either they didn't finish it or they simply decided against including it on the album. Neil described it on two separate occasions as \"a folk song about being gay in the 'eighties\" and \"a folk song about Clause 28.\" (Clause 28 was an extremely controversial law enacted in Britain in 1988, repealed in 2000, that outlawed the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools.)\n\nWhat Does It Feel Like?\n\nBMI records list a song by this title composed by Neil and Chris, but no other information is available about it at this time.\n\nWhat Would I Know?\n\nNeil considers this \"the worst song he's ever written.\" As such, it may never come to light, although the Boys felt enough about it to have it copyrighted, perhaps because Neil conceded that \"it's got a good middle bit.\"\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are\n\nThe Boys wrote this in collaboration with Xenomania's Miranda Cooper during the Yes sessions. They took it as far as the recording stage, complete with orchestration and a spoken intro. But then Neil and Chris decided to scrap it. They instead appropriated part of its melody for \"More Than a Dream,\" which indeed made it onto Yes.\n\nWhy Can't I?\n\nLike \"The Secret of Happiness,\" this unreleased song written in 2020 was inspired by the music of the Russian-born American songwriter Irving Berlin (1888-1989).\n\nWhy Do I Love You?\n\nAlso sometimes referred to more simply as \"Do I Love You?\" It was composed during the Super songwriting sessions, based on a Vivaldi chord change. It soon, however, evolved into \"The Dictator Decides,\" though with totally new lyrics. The original lyrics (which Neil feels were \"like Bryan Ferry\") included the lines:\n\nWhy do I love you?\n\nWhat am I to you?\n\nDo you see right through me\n\nWhen I speak to you?\n\nWill You Love Me?\n\nAnother of the unreleased Super era songs.\n\nWithout You\n\nWritten in January 2008 from the point of view of their late friend and associate Dainton Connell about his wife Mandy. Neil writes in his diary that he \"can imagine Suggs [the vocalist for Madness] singing it.\"\n\nYes in a No Kind of Way\n\nThis track apparently sounds, as Neil once described it, \"a bit like Madness and a bit like The Walker Brothers.\" He and Chris worked on it in 1994 but apparently haven't gotten around to finishing it.\n\nYou've Got to Start Somewhere\n\nYouth\n\nAn early working title for a song that evolved into \"Gin and Jag.\"\n\nYou're the Exception That Proves the Rule\n\nThis song was, like \"Pandemonium,\" one of several written for Kylie Minogue in 2007 or early 2008 but rejected. Neil has described it as \"a really good, funny song.\" Abandoning its lyrics, however, he and Chris decided to incorporate its music into The Most Incredible Thing as the instrumental \"The Competition.\"\n\nYou Don't Love Me\n\nNeil worked on a song by this name in October 2020.\n\nYou Know Where You Are with the Winter\n\nA song with this extremely intriguing title was mentioned as unreleased in Annually 2020. The Boys worked on it in late November 2017. Neil has described it as \"a Christmas song about how winter doesn't actually let you down the way summer can.\"\n\nZazoom\n\nBMI records list a song with this curious title composed by Neil and Chris, but no other information is available about it at this time..\n\nPlus a set of five brief unreleased \"radio jingles\" that Chris and Neil specially recorded on November 30, 2021 for their Boxing Day (December 26) evening \"takeover\" of BBC Radio 2 (which was actually pre-recorded on December 13):\n\nTakeover\n\nStrings\n\nBeautiful\n\nBoxing Day\n\nElectric\n\nIn addition, here are the titles of a few other unreleased tracks that have been reported by various other fansites (most notably Euphoric, So Pet Shop Boys, and the now seemingly defunct \"Pet Shop Boys Reality\") but about which I have no information whatsoever. If anyone can provide any details regarding these songs,\n\nNearly But Not Quite\n\nPrivate Places\n\nWhy Not?\n\nThere's also an unusual \"special case\" that I would be remiss to ignore â\n\nDo You Get Love? (aka \"At the End of the Day, Do You Get Love?\")\n\nThe first version of this song was co-written by Ray Roberts (together with a female singer with whom he was working at the time), at whose small studio the Boys composed and recorded some of their earliest demos. Neil, upon hearing it, liked its \"Do you get love?\" refrain and thought \"the backing track was lovely,\" but felt that the verse melody and lyrics could be improved to make it more \"romantic and wistful.\" Ray agreed, so Neil wrote a new melody and lyrics, after which Neil sangâ\"particularly high,\" as he has put it, \"full of sexual longing\"âatop the original backing on a new demo. It appears on a demo tape held by Neil in the 2024 BBC Imagine documentary. It was never intended to be a PSB track, however, the idea being that the original female singer would re-record it. But that never happened. If it ever had been completed and released, Neil surely would have merited a co-writing credit. Since, however, Mr. Roberts has now passed away, it's unlikely this song will ever reach the public's ears.\n\nFinally, here are the titles of several songs written solely by Neil before he met Chris:\n\nAll Things to All Men\n\nA Man on the Television\n\nCan You Hear the Dawn Break?\n\nThis was the most popular of the original songs that Neil wrote and performed with his \"hippie folk band\" Dust in the early 1970s, years before he met Chris. Noting that the music was \"based around the chord of E minor 7th,\" Neil quotes from the lyrics in the introduction to his 2018 book One Hundred Lyrics and a Poem. For copyright reasons I'll repeat just the first verse here:\n\nBaby, can you hear the dawn break?\n\nCan you see the sun shake?\n\nYou've come and I've gone\n\nCan you hear it break?\n\nThis song remained unheard by nearly all PSB fans until the April 16, 2022 episode of the BBC Radio 4 program This Cultural Life, which featured Neil as guest. During the show he talked about Dust and played a brief excerpt of \"Can You Hear the Dawn Break?\" from a recording of the song that had played once on the Newcastle radio station back in the early 1970s. The singer wasn't Neil, however, but rather one of the female members of Dust.\n\nThe Man Who Got There First\n\nNeil wrote this song in 1978 and revived it for studio development in mid-2021, possibly for what he describes (perhaps seriously, perhaps facetiously) as his prospective solo \"folk album.\"\n\nThe Sun of the Peaceful Day Before War\n\nTo the Waters and the Wild\n\nWhat Is the Colour of the Wind?\n\nThe Love Song\n\nFour other Dust songs dating from 1971. It's uncertain whether the fourth number, \"The Love Song,\" was actually written (solely or in part) by Neil, who has described it as an \"epic\" that was \"unbelievably pretentious and… went on interminably.\"\n\nI Heard What You Said\n\nA pre-PSB song written by Neil from which he repurposed some lyrics to become part of \"I Want to Wake Up.\"\n\nShe's in Love with the Man She Married\n\nNeil wrote this song in the late '70s. He says that it concerns a woman who has a brief holiday fling with a younger man, but she decides not to leave her husband because she's still in love with him. He and Chris toyed with the idea of recording it with Dusty Springfield, but nothing ever came of it.\n\nShe's So Eclectic\n\nWritten before he met Chris, this song is described by Neil in his One Hundred Lyrics and a Poem introduction as somewhat satirical and \"new wave\" in tone. It concerns a trendy young womanâpresumably his or at least his narrator's girlfriendâin terms of her eclecticism (\"She's got such catholic taste\") and how he's \"so, oh, o h, oh, oh-oh-oh fed up with it.\" (More of its lyrics are quoted in One Hundred Lyrics and a Poem.)\n\nSimple\n\nNeil wrote this in 1980 but worked on it in 2021 for his possible folk album.\n\nSnow\n\nSummer Rain\n\nThe Taxi-Driver\n\nTelephone Blues\n\nOther songs composed by Neil before he met Chris. He made simple solo demo recordings of some of them in 1981. He once noted that he had played some of them to publishing companies and, though they seemed to show interest, \"it had never come to anything.\" Neil wrote the last of this set, \"Telephone Blues,\" when he was 17, and it was among several of his songs performed in 1972 by the University Theatre in Newcastle in a short play that he wrote titled The Baby. Its lyrics, conceded as \"self-pitying\" by Neil himself, include the linesâ\n\nYou took my soul\n\nand you turned it to gold\n\nwith your alchemist's stone\n\nbut you left it cold\n\nNeil recorded a new demo of it in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown, so it's possible a PSB version may yet turn up.\n\nHas Anyone Seen My Cat?\n\nNeil wrote this songâhis very firstâwhen he was just nine years old. In fact, he and a childhood friend wrote an entire musical titled The Girl Who Pulled Tails, of which this song was a part. Now, how precocious is that?"
