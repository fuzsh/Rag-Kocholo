        "text": "On 1st November 1930, a concert was held in the College during which one of the songs performed by the orchestra was Le Rêve Passe by French composer Charles Helmer (Farragher C.S.Sp. and Wyer 191). This day can be noted as an important milestone for Blackrock as it was the first occasion that the music which was to become the inspiration for the College Anthem was played.\n\nLess than four years before this concert, Blackrock had adopted Fides et Robur as the College motto. Now, an anthem worthy of the school was sought after. At the time, other schools had anthems for use on rugby occasions. It was now Blackrock’s turn to compose such an anthem.\n\nFr Mackey with the help of his former mathematics teacher, Mr Hugh Holohan, set to work choosing a suitable tune for the anthem. In the early stages, they tried and tested extracts from Handel’s Messiah. However, Mr Holohan came to the belief that Blackrock owed too much to its French origins and that the anthem should be formed around a French composition. An excerpt from Le Rêve Passe was eventually selected and was met with enthusiastic approval (Farragher C.S.Sp. and Wyer 191).\n\nMr Holohan was asked by the College to compose the lyrics for the anthem although he had trouble in doing so. Fr Mackey stepped up to the task and wrote the words which embody the ideas of the school motto and have been sung with pride and enthusiasm by students ever since.\n\nRock boys are we,\n\nOur title is our glory!\n\nFearless and bold,\n\nWhatever the danger be.\n\nOnward we go, to flinch or falter never.\n\nRock boys together,\n\nThe blue and white for ever!\n\nThe anthem is sung to an excerpt from the melody of Le Rêve Passe. This excerpt is from the 1:08 mark in the above video."
