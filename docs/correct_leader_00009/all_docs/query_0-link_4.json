        "text": "Content created by Virtual Intern Nayantara Arora\n\nMargaret Thatcher served as Britain’s first female Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990. Her confidence, resilience, and uncompromising leadership style led her to reshape almost every aspect of British politics, from foreign policy to domestic economy.\n\nThatcher’s first exposure to the United States was through the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP). The IVLP served as a vital experience for Thatcher as she began her career.\n\nA 1990 handwritten note from 10 Downing Street – \"Forever more I shall be a friend to the United States\" – indicates a friendship that started with an IVLP experience.\n\nContent edited by Sallie Bestul, Regina Navarro-Gomez, and Jenna Williams"
