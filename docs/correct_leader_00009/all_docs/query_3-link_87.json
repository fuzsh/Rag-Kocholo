        "text": "Liz Truss has defeated Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest and will become the new prime minister.\n\nA total of 172,437 Tory members were eligible to vote in the contest and there was a turnout of 82 per cent, with Ms Truss securing 81,326 votes and Mr Sunak 60,399.\n\nMs Truss paid tribute to Boris Johnson in her acceptance speech, saying he was admired “from Kyiv to Carlisle”.\n\nShe added: “Thank you for putting your faith in me to lead our great Conservative Party, the greatest political party on Earth.\n\n“I know that our beliefs resonate with the British people: our beliefs in freedom, in the ability to control your own life, in low taxes, in personal responsibility.\n\n“I know that’s why people voted for us in such numbers in 2019 and as your party leader I intend to deliver what we promised those voters right across our great country.”\n\nMs Truss will become the country’s third-ever female prime minister.\n\nWho are the previous female PMs?\n\nAll three of the UK’s female prime ministers have been Conservatives.\n\nMargaret Thatcher became the first when she was elected in May 1979. She served for 11 years and 208 days, making her the seventh-longest serving prime minister in British history, and longest of the 20th century. She left office in November 1990, meaning her premiership spanned three decades.\n\nMs Thatcher enjoyed significant popularity from the British public, winning landslide elections in both 1983 and 1987, but is also one of the country’s most divisive leaders.\n\nBiographer Jason Campbell wrote in his book, The Iron Lady: Margaret Thatcher, from Grocer’s Daughter to Prime Minister: “Margaret Thatcher was not merely the first woman and the longest-serving prime minister of modern times, but the most admired, most hated, most idolised and most vilified public figure of the second half of the twentieth century.\n\n“To some she was the saviour of her country who created a vigorous enterprise economy which 20 years later was still outperforming the more regulated economies of the continent. To others, she was a narrow ideologue whose hard-faced policies legitimised greed, deliberately increased inequality and destroyed the nation’s sense of solidarity and civic pride. There is no reconciling these views: yet both are true.”\n\nMs Thatcher died in 2013, aged 87.\n\nThe second female prime minister was Theresa May, who succeeded David Cameron in July 2016 after he resigned in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union.\n\nMs May, who had previously served as home secretary, was named Tory leader when her last remaining competitor, Dame Andrea Leadsom, pulled out of the race.\n\nShe called a snap general election in April 2017 which turned out to be a disaster for both her and the Tory party, as it lost its parliamentary majority.\n\nMs May went on to face significant rebellion from within her own party over her Brexit deal, fighting and winning a confidence vote in December 2018.\n\nHer Brexit deal was repeatedly voted down in the House of Commons, and in March 2019 she eventually resigned, to be replaced by Mr Johnson. She remains MP for Maidenhead.\n\nWhich other countries have female leaders?\n\nThere are currently 31 countries with female presidents or prime ministers.\n\nThe longest-serving of these is Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina, who has been prime minister since 2009. She also held the position between 1996 and 2001.\n\nHere are all the current female heads of state and heads of government, and when they assumed office:\n\nSheikh Hasina – Bangladesh prime minister (2009)\n\nBidya Devi Bhandari – Nepal president (2015)\n\nTsai Ing-wen – Taiwan president (2016)\n\nAna Brnabić – Serbia prime minister (2017)\n\nHalimah Yacob – Singapore president (2017)\n\nJacinda Ardern – New Zealand prime minister (2017)\n\nKatrín Jakobsdóttir – Iceland prime minister (2017)\n\nPaula-Mae Weekes – Trinidad and Tobago president (2018)\n\nMia Mottley – Barbados prime minister (2018)\n\nSahle-Work Zewde – Ethiopia president (2018)\n\nSalome Zourabichvili – Georgia president (2018)\n\nZuzana Čaputová – Slovakia president (2019)\n\nMette Frederiksen – Denmark prime minister (2019)\n\nSanna Marin – Finland prime minister (2019)\n\nMaia Sandu – Moldova president (2020)\n\nKaterina Sakellaropoulou – Greece president (2020)\n\nRose Christiane Raponda – Gabon prime minister (2020)\n\nVictoire Tomegah Dogbé – Togo prime minister (2020)\n\nIngrida Šimonytė – Lithuania prime minister (2020)\n\nKaja Kallas – Estonia prime minister (2021)\n\nSamia Suluhu Hassan – Tanzania president (2021)\n\nVjosa Osmani – Kosovo president (2021)\n\nFiamē Naomi Mataʻafa – Samoa prime minister (2021)\n\nNatalia Gavrilița – Moldova prime minister (2021)\n\nNajla Bouden – Tunisia prime minister (2021)\n\nSandra Mason – Barbados president (2021)\n\nMagdalena Andersson – Sweden prime minister (2021)\n\nXiomara Castro – Honduras president (2022)\n\nKatalin Novák – Hungary president (2022)\n\nÉlisabeth Borne – France prime minister (2022)\n\nDroupadi Murmu – India president (2022)\n\nThe United States has notably never had a female president. Hillary Clinton came close to becoming the first in 2016, but was defeated by Donald Trump."
