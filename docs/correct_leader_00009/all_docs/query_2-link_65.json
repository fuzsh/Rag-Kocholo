        "meta_description": "On 8th April 2013, Margaret Thatcher passed away at the age of 88. The controversy over her funeral is the occasion for us to consider the sensitive question of her legacy not only in the decade that followed her resignation from office in November 1990 but also in the decade that culminated in the formation of a Coalition Government led by the Conservatives in May 2010. The term ‘legacy’ was associated with Margaret Thatcher before her death, almost immediately after she left office in November 1990. However, it was really at the turn of the 21st century that it became popular especially with the specialists of New Labour and the Third Way. Thatcher’s influence however was not limited to party politics. It filtered into all reaches of the very society she had considered non-existent. The result was that the transformation, which had begun under Margaret Thatcher, was almost completed in the first decade of the 21st century. However, after three consecutive defeats, Thatcherism was no longer considered as an electoral winner by the Conservative Party, and the legacy was proving a cumbersome one. David Cameron’s election victory in December 2005 signalled the onset of what many specialists describe as a new faction within the party, i.e. not a Thatcherite one. What seemed to be a clear repositioning of the Conservative Party to the centre ground was likely to relegate an ageing Margaret Thatcher and Thatcherism to history books and to the past.",

        "text": "5She was a self-proclaimed politician of convictions and her uncompromising and dogmatic style were very much at the origin of the eponymous trend that was sparked off before she became PM, whilst she was still party leader, although Thatcherism later developed into a much more complex mixture of style and policies. In spite of the –ism, Thatcherism is not easy to define. Thatcherism is not a unified set of ideas or body of doctrine. Rather it is a set of policies that are not always coherent and that, more often than not, are simple reactions to circumstances and difficulties. The Falklands War, and the attack by the IRA are two such examples. On both occasions her personal reaction became integral elements of what Thatcherism was supposed to entail. Monetarism, on the other hand, was a deliberate strategy underpinned by a distinct body of doctrine but the theory and the practice often differed and to a certain extent, it is more Margaret Thatcher’s doctrinaire approach and her famous ‘There is No Alternative’ that define Thatcherism than Monetarism itself. Her attempt to curb trade union power only became one of Thatcherism’s defining features after she defeated Arthur Scargill and his National Union of Mineworkers in 1984. These and many similar examples show that Thatcherism is more an attitude to power that depends on the persona of the leader than a doctrine, although it is supported by certain defining principles: right-wing Conservatism on law and order, immigration, taxes, a Neo-liberal belief in the supremacy of the free market against government intervention and state ownership, and a vision of the individual as a free agent of his/her own destiny rather than a member of a society closely related to the State.\n\nThe legacy on the Public Sector\n\n9On becoming Prime Minister in May 1979, one of Margaret Thatcher’s priorities was to cut public spending not only as part of her government’s economic programme to curb inflation and restore growth, but also to help roll back the state in order to roll forward individual initiative in a free market. The public sector was accused of having become so large that it “crowded out” the private sector, thus impairing economic growth and creating inflation. It was also described as monopolistic and not cost-effective. In addition, public sector workers were accused of lacking in efficiency and of pursing their own personal interest at the expense of customers, i.e. the taxpayers whom they served. Ever-growing, the state also encroached upon people’s lives and welfare policies were blamed for rendering recipients helpless and dependent on assistance. Public sector reforms were two-fold. The part of the public sector that the Thatcher governments could not do without would have to change its structure and culture, to become better value-for-money or, cost effective, and more competitive. The rest would be dismantled or privatised. Three sectors that were to be reformed with the aim of creating a public sector market and to introduce a private-sector management ethos, were the National Health Service (NHS), the civil service and education. All three are examined respectively by Peter Dorey, Louise Dalingwater, Françoise Granoulhac and Anne Beauvallet.\n\n12Françoise Granoulhac and Anne Beauvallet both consider the Thatcher legacy in education and although both stress there is indeed an important degree of continuity from Thatcher to Major, Blair and Cameron, they suggest different perspectives. Françoise Granoulhac first presents David Cameron’s election as leader of the Conservative Party in 2005 as “a break away from the burdensome Thatcher legacy in education and its market-based approach.” Although she insists that the Conservative Party’s vision of education owes more to New Labour’s managerial approach than to Thatcher’s, in terms of the pursing of the New Labour policy leading to the creation of academies, she is also keen to stress that David Cameron needed to distance himself from Blair. The result was the use of a whole new rhetoric with David Cameron emphasizing his duty to restore social justice which, in educational terms, meant helping all children achieve whatever their social background. However, for Françoise Granoulhac, the problem was that this new discourse did not involve a structural reform of the system. For David Cameron, the education market initiated by Margaret Thatcher and developed by Tony Blair was not the problem. Education was. It no longer delivered social justice or facilitated social promotion because it was not adapted to people, to communities. The reason for this was that it was controlled from the top by government officials, who were disconnected from the grassroots. Schools needed to be liberated from central government control, and therefore from the structural constraints established by Thatcher. The Conservative Party’s flagship policy was the creation of free schools that were supposed to be managed by parents, charities or faith groups, with government support. Another reason why schools were failing to deliver social justice was that they lacked strong leadership. Parents were called upon to become involved along with teachers. They were supposed to be the new actors of this revolution. There were, however, aspects of the Conservative Party’s educational programme that echoed the Thatcher years. Obviously, the fact that the expansion of the education market carried on unabated, was one. Also, the insistence on traditional values such as respect for authority and a return to basics was another. Michael Gove, the Coalition Government’s Education Secretary (2010-2015), is described by Françoise Granoulhac as “a true heir to Thatcher.” The problem was the 2008 crisis and the concomitant spending cuts introduced by the Coalition Government in 2010. The money that was supposed to flow from central government into the Big Society and its schools, via local authorities, only trickled. In the absence of appropriate public funding, some free schools fell into private ownership, that of companies specialised in the education business. This leads Françoise Granoulhac to consider what can be described as a Thatcherite turn in education as an “option by default” rather than David Cameron’s vision.\n\n13Anne Beauvallet contests this analysis, believing that the Thatcherite “enterprise culture” impressed upon the education system, its structure and syllabus, is “the legacy of the Thatcher years” and that “it is an enduring one.” Margaret Thatcher, who had been Education Secretary under Edward Heath (1970-74), had a very clear vision of the role of education, that depended on her personal values. This vision was a mixture of traditional Conservative and New Right thinking. She was a true Conservative in that she stressed the importance of traditional values such as respect for authority and hard work, the values which schools were supposed to transmit. In addition, she believed in the necessity for schools to all work together on a shared programme, or national curriculum, that would focus on the basics, “a basic curriculum with universal standards”, another entrenched Conservative value. The introduction of a national curriculum would not only help set standards, it would also counter the controversial methods used by some progressive or socialist teachers. Her market-based approach also meant that she believed education no longer matched the needs of the market. Her objective on becoming Prime Minister was three-fold: to reform the system so as to bypass local authorities, to create an education market to give parents the right to choose, and to push educational standards up by giving central government more control over programmes. The outcome was a transfer of power from local authorities to central government. The introduction of a public-private partnership initiative (PPI) into education was central to John Major’s reform. The role of PPI was then substantially increased by Tony Blair. The belief that pupils should be assessed more regularly to stop levels from declining, led to the further development (already existed but was not so pronounced) of a culture of assessment and targets. The best schools, i.e. those that were at the top of the league tables would attract the best pupils, for the consumer-parents would reward excellence. These schools would consequently have more funding which, in turn, would help them stay at the top. For Anne Beauvallet, this performance-based culture, overseen by the Office for Standards in Education, feeds into the neo-liberal ideology initiated by Margaret Thatcher. She concludes that, even if some schools, especially at primary level have been able to resist, the Thatcher legacy, in the field of education, is an enduring one. In this, she concurs with Peter Dorey’s position: Thatcherism was not a thing of the past in 2015.\n\n14The reform of the public sector is an element that forms an integral part of Thatcherism. To examine the policies of the governments from 1990 to 2015 in this regard, is therefore necessary to consider the question of her legacy. Thatcherism is also a set of emblematic policies, moments, issues, ideas: Europe, Monetarism, Neo-liberalism. What impact did these issues have on ensuing governments? Do they still influence parties, governments and political agendas today? Is Thatcher’s legacy still an aspect of present-day politics?\n\nThe legacy of an ‘ideology’ ?\n\n16Nathalie Champroux and Nicholas Sowels’ chapter on the Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), Monetarism, and fiscal policies is arguably the only one that quite clearly relegates Margaret Thatcher’s “pure” Monetarism to history books and denies that her legacy went beyond her years in office. The authors begin by examining the theoretical and ideological underpinnings of the MTFS. Like many other policies, Margaret Thatcher’s monetarism was not new. What was new however, for Nathalie Champroux and Nicholas Sowels, was the “Government’s determined focus on the strategy”: the monetary and fiscal policies of the MTFS were introduced in their pure monetarist form (money supply reduction and spending cuts) and their exclusive objective was to curb inflation. Although inflation almost doubled between 1979 and 1980, it started falling in 1981. Albeit late in coming, this reduction in inflation could be read as a sign that monetarism was working and that Margaret Thatcher had been vindicated in her dogmatic defence of it: “You turn if you want. The Lady’s not for turning.” Nathalie Champroux and Nicholas Sowels, however, contend that “there were fundamental flaws in the government’s management of the situation, and indeed in the whole pursuit of pure monetarism”. The essential problem was that the government had made policy commitments that “undermined the application of monetarism”. Cutting direct taxation was one of them. There were others, which meant that the government could be charged with incoherence and in fact, in spite of the tenacity with which Margaret Thatcher “stuck to monetarism and the MTFS”, Nathalie Champroux and Nicholas Sowels explain that the “pure” monetarist policies of the first two years were abandoned in favour of a more “mixed” version in the 1981 Budget. In the last part of their chapter, Nathalie Champroux and Nicholas Sowels suggest that: “it is tempting to declare that nothing remains of the early Monetary Thatcherism,” given that even Milton Friedman, the father of Monetarism, agreed that strict Monetarism had worked nowhere. Yet Monetarism is still used today as “an instrument to tackle high unemployment.” Nathalie Champroux and Nicholas Sowels argue that to use Monetarism for this purpose is the opposite “to Margaret Thatcher’s perception of the role of monetary policies” that were destined “to only cure monetary issues.” In addition, she would have disagreed with saying that tackling high unemployment was a priority. Was her legacy being trampled on? Obviously, with inflation at around 2% (Consumer Price Index) since 1993, priorities had changed and the 2008 financial crisis arguably exposed the failures of a model that she had contributed to developing. The Coalition Government’s Spending Review in October 2010, which planned cuts of 19% were reminiscent of the 1981 budget. The question of the Thatcher legacy was raised again. Nathalie Champroux and Nicholas Sowels conclude however that Britain’s economy is now very different and that although the neo-liberal model has become the orthodoxy in Britain as well as in many other countries, if not most parts of the world, the legacy of the MTFS and of Thatcher’s Monetarism was not an enduring one.\n\n19In the first part of his chapter, Dennis Kavanagh offers a sweeping survey of the period 1979-2015, starting with a presentation of the Thatcher years and an explanation of how the –ism came about. The conclusion is that Thatcherism was meant to endure given the depth of the transformations and the length of time the Conservatives were in office. In addition, a host of Think Tanks and policy groups, as well as a media almost entirely favourable to her, carried on spreading the ‘good word’ long after she had left office. Dennis Kavanagh quotes Margaret Thatcher in April 1992: ‘Thatcherism will live, it will live long after Thatcher has died because we had the courage to restore the great principles and put them into practice.” He also discusses Margaret Thatcher’s haunting presence after she left office, presenting John Major as the legatee whom she destroyed and Tony Blair as the one she moulded. It is indeed Tony Blair who is seen as her true heir because once he had accepted her views on the economy and on the need to preserve and even complete most of her reforms, he fulfilled her dream, according to Dennis Kavanagh, the dream of every politician, of leaving a legacy. However, the story of Margaret Thatcher’s legacy is also one of “discontinuity” with David Cameron the first and only Conservative leader to genuinely distance himself from Thatcherism and, most of all, the first to have enough political discipline to maintain this narrative. Dennis Kavanagh describes the Conservative leader’s attempts to do away with what he calls “a toxic legacy”, the necessary prerequisite to justify Tim Bale’s “brand decontamination.” This leads Dennis Kavanagh to describe Cameron’s Conservative Party as “Post-Thatcher”. There is, however, a notable difference between the Conservative Party that campaigned for the 2010 election and the Coalition Government that was formed in May. Most of the more progressive electoral pledges seem to have been either moved to the bottom of the agenda or quietly abandoned. Whether this was because of circumstances, or because David Cameron did not really believe in them in the first place, is another question. In many ways, however, David Cameron has proved a much more flexible Prime Minister than expected, sending what Dennis Kavanagh describes as “different signals.” This contributes to making his Conservatism an elusive subject for those who wish to analyse it. For this reason, he has proved to be a different style of politician from Thatcher, i.e. one who is lacking in convictions, whereas she tenaciously, or stubbornly, clung to hers. This, along with his distancing himself from the policies that symbolised Thatcherism, leads Dennis Kavanagh to conclude that: “Her style of leadership and her programme belong to a period and mood in modern British politics, one which she helped to shape. But both are now more suitable subjects for historians than a guide to contemporary politics.”"
