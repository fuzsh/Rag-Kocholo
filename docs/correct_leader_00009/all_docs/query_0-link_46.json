        "text": "Lady Margaret Thatcher—along with her great ally, President Reagan—fought and won a crucial battle of ideas in the 1970s and 1980s. Ten years after her death, it now falls to a new generation in the Western world to fight a new raft of ideological battles which will determine whether the cherished values of freedom and democracy will continue to thrive in the 21st century. Reducing the size of the state and rejecting leftist orthodoxy are also crucial to delivering the prosperity that will ensure the forces of freedom can prevail against authoritarian regimes. These are the themes that former British Prime Minister Liz Truss will take up as she delivers the 2023 Margaret Thatcher Freedom Lecture.\n\nThe Freedom Lecture honors the principles, ideals, vision, and legacy of Lady Thatcher. Previous lecturers have included Ambassador Nikki Haley, Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, conservative authors and commentators Charles Krauthammer and Victor Davis Hanson, and foreign statesmen including former Australian Prime Minister John Howard and former UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox MP.\n\nThe Rt Hon Liz Truss MP: Liz Truss served as the 56th Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and is a long-standing advocate for limited government, low taxes, and freedom, both at home in the UK and around the world. Continuously holding ministerial office between 2012 and 2022, she served three different prime ministers in six different roles around the cabinet table before her own tenure in 10 Downing Street, including Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Secretary of State for International Trade, and Foreign Secretary, as well as Minister for Women and Equalities.\n\nSign up to receive invitations to all public events."
