        "text": "Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on October 13, 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. Her father was a grocer and very active in the politics of Grantham, where he eventually served as mayor. Margaret excelled in school and gained entrance to the University of Oxford. She studied chemistry and was the first woman president of the Oxford University Conservative Association. She graduated in 1947.\n\nMargaret worked as a research chemist while studying to become a lawyer. From 1954 she worked as a tax law barrister. She married Denis Thatcher in 1951 and had twins in 1953.\n\nThatcher first ran for a seat in Parliament in 1950 but was unsuccessful. She succeeded in winning a seat in 1959. During the next two decades, Thatcher steadily rose within the Conservative Party. She became the second woman ever to hold a cabinet position when she was appointed secretary of state for education in 1970. Thatcher was elected leader of the party in 1975 and became prime minister in 1979. She was reelected in 1983 and in 1987.\n\nAs prime minister, Thatcher wanted the government to stop being so involved in businesses. This made a large impact on the economy and resulted in an increase in unemployment. Unemployment rose from 1.3 million in 1979 to over 3 million in 1986.\n\nHowever, Thatcher’s popularity was boosted by the Falkland Islands War in 1982. During her term, she passed laws that restricted the power of labor unions. Thatcher was also opposed to Britain being deeply involved in the European Community (later the European Union).\n\nAfter she resigned as party leader in 1990, Thatcher continued to be involved in the Conservative Party. She established a foundation and was made Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven in 1992. Three years later she became a member of the Order of the Garter, the highest British honor.\n\nThatcher retired from public speaking in 2002. She died on April 8, 2013, in London, England."
