        "text": "Domestic Policy\n\nMonetarism underpinned all Margaret Thatcher's policies. The beliefs were clear and are still what a free country needs to prosper. The aims were clear: to reduce the power of government, to reduce taxation and thereby promote private enterprise and individual rights, to give incentives to businessmen and encourage competition. Margaret Thatcher believed that these aims would produce economic and fiscal benefits for the people and enable her to use the political process to further the free society in all its aspects.\n\nThe economic lessons of these beliefs are going to be dealt with by Antonio Martino. In this he is fortunate, for monetarism and the free market are what most excited Margaret Thatcher. Suffice for me to say that what Thatcher pledged in her manifestos was delivered. She used simple imagery that everyone could understand. She was the grocer's daughter, the housekeeper of the nation who would balance the budget and the nation would only spend what it could afford.\n\nIt was only after 1987 when Chancellor Lawson shadowed the deutsche mark and Britain entered the ERM that the Conservatives learnt you cannot buck the market. The price was failure in 1997. But it is important to remember that at no point did the public lose faith in the free market which Margaret Thatcher did so much to encourage. The opposition have adopted this policy, and the last election was fought partly on the basis of who could best implement that policy -- a key part of Thatcher's legacy.\n\nThe monetary reforms of Margaret Thatcher were paralleled by moves to curb the power of the trade unions in Britain. Just as the Conservative Party already had taken up free market ideas in its manifesto for the 1970 election, so the intention to work with the trade unions was not entirely new. The Labour Party under Harold Wilson had introduced legislation \"in place of strife,\" and when it failed, the floodgates of intransigence were opened.\n\nCallaghan (himself a trade unionist) had tried to build a social contract between the Labour government and the trade unions. When consensus patently failed, in the winter of discontent of 1979, it left the field open for Margaret Thatcher. The time was ripe, but she made the difference. She had a will of iron and stood firm against a barrage of strikes and intimidation, until between 1982 and 1988 the unions were brought step by step within the law. After the final confrontation with the steel and coal industries, the proper balance between employer and workforce was restored. Men no longer had to join a trade union, and this, combined with the program of privatizing nationalized industries, resulted in a reduction of union membership from 13 million in 1979 to 8 million in 1996.\n\nThe defeat of the trade unions, together with privatization, represented one of Margaret Thatcher's greatest successes. The effect was to bring large sections of the working class within the Conservative fold. She had extended to them what had been regarded as middle-class ideals and had, through privatization, created popular capitalism and the beginnings of a shareholding democracy.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher took office, there were 3 million private shareholders; when she left, there were almost 11 and a half million. The tabloid newspapers latched onto this and joined their broadsheet cousins in publishing alongside the racing columns share market information and news. The popularity of privatization increased as each industry was floated on the stock exchange. When the gas industry was launched, the shares were oversubscribed by 500 percent.\n\nWorking people were given a further stake in society by the sale of locally subsidized housing, in which many of them lived. They were sold to tenants at knockdown prices, and between 1979 and 1989 owner occupation increased from 55 to 63 percent. Despite the setback of the recession of the early 1990s, the ambition of most of the electorate remained to own their own home.\n\nAs Margaret Thatcher drew the wider electorate into her beliefs, it should be remembered that she had originally had to fight all the way within her own party. Unlike an American President, who takes with him his whole machine, Margaret Thatcher was an outsider who inherited a Cabinet and party machine, both of which were consensual in attitude. This applied even more so to the civil service, which for 15 of the previous 19 years had been under socialist direction.\n\nShe used similar tactics to turn round all three to her way of thinking. She bypassed them until she had the members she wanted. She used subcommittees instead of full Cabinet to ensure her policies. She used outside think tanks: the Institute of Economic Affairs, which had given her the early tutelage in monetarism, and the Centre for Policy Studies, founded by her guru, Sir Keith Joseph. Like Heritage in America, they created the intellectual ideas for she and her followers to implement. She brought in outside advisers: academics like Alan Walters and Terry Burns and successful businessmen like Sir John Hoskins (computer magnate), Derek Rayner (M&S), and Sir Robin Ibbs.\n\nThe need to cut bureaucracy and public spending was tackled from the outset, and between 1979 and 1987 the number of civil servants was reduced by 22.5 percent (732,000 to 567,000). The truly radical changes were introduced between 1987 to 1990, inspired by Sir Robin Ibbs. Only a small core of advisers was to be retained to run government machinery, and most civil servants would work for new executive agencies, attached to ministries. Precise targets were to be set and held to. Although the reforms were properly effected after Margaret Thatcher had left office, she had changed the culture of the machinery of government.\n\nIt was more difficult to bring about cost cutting and reform in local government and the welfare services of health, social security, and education. The welfare needs were seen by the electorate as free and of right. It is difficult to take a bone away from a dog, and the early years of her premiership were taken up by more pressing matters.\n\nCost-cutting measures were undertaken in all the services, but despite cash limits being imposed, overall spending rose. (For example, in health, from 1980 to 1987 it increased by 60 percent). In education, my voucher scheme was turned down by\n\nCabinet, and only minor changes were introduced.\n\nIn local government, cost cutting had perverse repercussions. The spendthrift city authorities controlled by the extreme left were rate-capped and the worst of them all, the Greater London Council, abolished. Unfortunately, it allowed Councillors to blame government for shortfall in services and increased centralized control, which reduced freedom.\n\nMargaret Thatcher's populist instinct had made her more cautious in these areas, but after the election success of 1987, when she saw her monetary policies threatened by runaway costs, she introduced dramatic reform in all these areas. Again they were not properly implemented until she had been forced from office.\n\nThe changes that had been undertaken were to prove part of her undoing. The poll tax, which was an individual tax which replaced a property tax, was so unpopular it had to be withdrawn. The health and social security changes frightened the electorate and led to the debacle of 1997. In education, the setting up of grant-maintained schools to bring power and responsibility to individual schools as against the local authority was overturned by the present government.\n\nThere is a lesson in all this: Always tackle the controversial or unpopular measures at the beginning of an administration. Margaret Thatcher thought she was doing this after her great election success in 1987. She could not have foreseen she would have been forced out of office in three years. It was not that the ideas were wrong; the think tanks had provided mechanisms to introduce market principles. In these areas, however, only a few politicians had been willing to preach their virtues. Their time is yet to come, the message must still be reiterated.\n\nHow Did She Do It?\n\nHow did she do it? I believe there are several factors that contributed to Thatcher's \"Conservative Revolution.\"\n\nIdeas. There is no doubt that Thatcher's success is largely due to the power of ideas. She acknowledged the important role played by the Institute of Economic Affairs in providing the intellectual ammunition and the inspiration for her program. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the IEA, she said:\n\n[T]he Institute began at a time when despite free speech in a free country, there prevailed what I would call a censorship of fashion. Anyone who dared to challenge the conventional wisdom of the post-war years was frowned-upon, criticized, derided and pilloried as being reactionary or ignorant.... You set out to change public sentiment.... May I say how thankful we are to those academics, some of whom were very lonely, and to those journalists who joined your great endeavour. I do not think they ever numbered 364. They were the few. But they were right, and they saved Britain.\n\nWithout those ideas, Thatcher's revolution would have been impossible. However, let's not forget that most of them were already available 10 years earlier at the time of the Heath government. It can be argued that in 1979 the justification for a radical change in economic policy was stronger than ever before, but it is still true that ideas alone do not explain the revolution. They were a necessary, but certainly not a sufficient, cause for the change.\n\nCircumstances. It is true that by the end of the 1970s, the evidence of the failure of the statist policies pursued by both Labour and Tory governments was overwhelming. I believe that circumstances did play a role in Thatcher's success. However, the evidence of the failure of those anti-market policies was already in existence in 1970, even though it was not as conspicuous as in 1979.\n\nFurthermore, let's not forget that not everybody drew the same conclusions from that experience. Certainly not the Labour Party that in 1979 was as Socialist as ever. And, as far as academic economists are concerned, the vast majority was convinced that there was no need for a change in policy, as revealed by the 364 of them who signed a manifesto against the new policies of the Thatcher government. The evidence was undoubtedly there, and it helped Thatcher's cause, but it had been there before with no impact, and many educated people still failed to draw the correct conclusions from it.\n\nInterests. The trade unions had abused their power, and this made the case for reducing their influence stronger than ever. However, even this was not new: The danger omnipotent labor unions pose to a free society had been obvious for years, yet nobody had ever tried to tame them.\n\nLeadership. I believe that, while these factors played a role in Thatcher's success, the crucial element was her personality, her principled and uncompromising leadership. It can be said of her what Ted Kennedy said of Reagan:\n\nIt would be foolish to deny that his success was fundamentally rooted in a command of public ideas. Ronald Reagan may have forgotten names, but never his goals. He was a great communicator, not simply because of his personality or his teleprompter, but mostly because he had something to communicate.\n\nShe dared do what no one else had had the courage to do in Britain for decades: challenge the prevailing consensus, the common wisdom, the entrenched interests, and drive a reluctant party and a befuddled country in a radically new direction.\n\nI can testify to her unusual personality. I have had the chance to meet her several times even before I entered politics. Once, in 1991, there was a conference in Fiesole, near Florence, organized by the National Review Institute. During a coffee break, we were walking along the portico of the hotel. Tuscany's countryside looked magnificent under the afternoon sun. Mrs. Thatcher remarked: \"Yours is a beautiful country, with a rotten government.\" To which I replied: \"My dear lady, the opposite would be much worse.\"\n\nHer straightforward, direct way of putting things, so unusual for a political leader, earned her some enemies among other leaders but made for a refreshing contrast with the hypocrisy and vacuity of the accepted political discourse. At times, she probably overdid it. For example, on that same occasion in Fiesole, during her summing-up of the conference, she came out with the statement: \"Civilization is the exclusive prerogative of English-speaking peoples.\" I was the only non-English, non-American in the room. I looked at John O'Sullivan, who was sitting next to me. He smiled and said, \"You have been consigned to barbarism!\"\n\nShe can also be very kind and thoughtful. When we won the elections in Italy in 1994, she sent me a fax of congratulations. I called her to thank her for her kindness. She gave me her usual pep talk: \"You must do for Italy what I did for Britain.\" I attempted to explain that we were at a disadvantage compared to her. I said: \"You had a Constitution that was written in the hearts and the minds of your people. We don't. You had an independent judiciary. We don't. You had a clean and effective civil service. We don't. You had a single party majority. We don't. You had those think tanks, like the IEA, that provided you with the right ideas. We don't.\"\n\n\"However,\" I added, \"we have something which you didn't have.\" \"What's that?\" she said. \"Your example,\" I replied.\n\nAs to the relative importance of ideas and/or leadership, she gave her own view on the occasion of the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the IEA. After having listened to a series of speeches by distinguished academics, all praising the great importance of ideas, she thus concluded her remarks: \"Speaking as the eleventh speaker and the only woman, I hope you will recall that it may be the cock that crows but it is the hen who lays the eggs.\"\n\n1. I plead guilty: I am not qualified for a neutral, dispassionate evaluation of Mrs. Thatcher's economic legacy. I am partial to her. Also, of the many slurs I have received during my brief tenure in government--Euro-skeptic, anti-European--the one that bothered me the least was that supposedly ultimate insult: Anglophile. In many ways, I am a confirmed\n\nAnglophile.\n\n2. In this sense, a prophecy has been confirmed. In the entry \"Fascism\" in the Enciclopedia Italiana, signed by Benito Mussolini but apparently written by philosopher Giovanni Gentile, one reads: \"If the 19th century has been the century of the individual (for liberalism means individualism), it may be conjectured that this is the century of the State...that this is the century of authority, a Fascist century.\"\n\n3. In 1947, the founders of the Mont Pelerin Society thus expressed their concerns: \"The central values of civilization are in danger.... The position of the individual and the voluntary group are progressively undermined by extensions of arbitrary power. Even the most precious possession of Western Man, freedom of thought and expression, is threatened.... These developments have been fostered...by the growth of theories which question the desirability of the rule of law...by a decline of belief in private property and the competitive market....\" Their aim was to combat the prevailing consensus with an alternative vision of man, economy, and society. Their undertaking seemed hopeless. Joseph A. Schumpeter, for example, was not impressed. In 1949, after having listed a series of socialist principles which, as a result of the \"disintegration of capitalist society,\" were being \"taken for granted by the business class...and by the large number of economists who feel themselves to be opposed to (one hundred percent) socialism,\" he added: \"I believe that there is a mountain in Switzerland on which congresses of economists have been held which express disapproval of all or most of these things (e.g. socialist policies). But these anathemata have not even provoked attack.\" Joseph A. Schumpeter, \"The March into Socialism,\" 1949, reprinted in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, 3rd ed., Harper Torchbooks, The University Library, Harper & Row, New York, 1950, pp. 415-425.\n\n4. Joseph A. Schumpeter, for example, like many others was sure that capitalism was doomed and that socialism would prevail: \"Can capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can.... [T]he actual and prospective performance of the capitalist system is such...that its very success undermines the social institutions which protect it, and 'inevitably' creates conditions in which it will not be able to live and which strongly point to socialism as the heir apparent.\" Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, p. 61. By socialism, Schumpeter meant a society where \"the control over means of production and overproduction itself is vested with a central authority--or [where] the economic affairs of society belong to the public and not to the private sphere.\"\n\n5. Milton Friedman was among the first to show some optimism. In 1973, he declared: \"There are faint stirrings and hopeful signs. Even some of the intellectuals who were most strongly drawn to the New Deal in the thirties are rethinking their positions, dabbling just a little with free-market principles. They're moving slowly and taking each step as though they were exploring a virgin continent. But it's not dangerous. Some of us have lived here quite comfortably all along.\" Playboy interview, February 1973, reprinted in There's No Such Thing as a Free Lunch, Open Court, LaSalle, Illinois, 1975, pp. 1-38. The quoted language is on p. 38. At about the same time, David Friedman was even more blunt than his father: \"Socialism, as a coherent ideology, is dead and is not likely to be revived.... Yet many people...call themselves socialists. 'Socialism' has become a word with positive connotation and no content.\" David Friedman, The Machinery of Freedom, Guide to a Radical Capitalism, Harper Colophon Books, 1973, p. 129.\n\n6. I have dealt repeatedly with this issue on several occasions. See \"Are We Winning?\" Occasional Paper 29, Centre for Independent Studies, St. Leonards, Australia, 1990, pp. 1-11 (Foreword by Michael James); \"Liberalism in the Coming Decade,\" Cato Policy Report, Cato Institute, Washington, November-December 1990, pp. 1-13; Spanish translation \"El Liberalismo en la Proxima Decada,\" CEDICE (Centro de Divulgacion del Conocimiento Economico) A.C., Caracas, 1990, pp. 3-25; republished in David Boaz, ed., The Libertarian Reader, Classic & Contemporary Writings from Lao-Tzu to Milton Friedman, The Free Press, New York, 1997, pp. 355-362; \"Ideas and the Future of Liberty,\" in Libertarians and Liberalism, Essays in Honour of Gerard Radnitzky, Hardy Boullion, ed., Avebury Series in Philosophy, Avebury, 1996, pp. 288-297, reprinted as \"Ideas y el futuro de la libertad,\" Topicos de Actualidad 813, January 1996, CEES, Guatemala; The Modern Mask of Socialism, The Fifteenth Annual John Bonython Lectures, October 21, 1998, Occasional Paper 66, Centre for Independent Studies, St. Leonards, Australia, 1998, pp. 1-19; and The Sir Ronald Trotter Lecture 1998, New Zealand Business Roundtable, 1998, pp. 5-32.\n\n7. John Maynard Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, 1936, First Harbinger Edition, 1964, p. 383.\n\n8. \"If there is any set of opinions by the advocacy of which a newspaper can increase its sales, then the student...is bound to dwell on the limitations and defects and errors, if any, in that set of opinions; and never to advocate them unconditionally even in an ad hoc discussion.\" Quoted in A. C. Pigou, Economics in Practice (London, 1935), pp. 10-11.\n\n9. \"On Being an Economist,\" 1944, reprinted in What Do Economists Contribute? Daniel B. Klein, ed., New York University Press, New York, 1999, p. 146. Similar views have been expressed by William H. Hutt, for example; see Klein, ed., What Do Economists Contribute? p. 9.\n\n10. Which would suggest that their output has little, if any, impact in shaping those ideologies. G. J. Stigler, \"The Politics of Political Economists,\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. LXXIII (November 1959), reprinted in Essays in the History of Economics, University of Chicago Press, 1965, pp. 51-65. \"Lacking real expertise, and lacking also evangelical ardor, the economist has had little influence upon the evolution of economic policy.\" George J. Stigler, \"The Economist and the State,\" American Economic Review, March 1965. \"I believe that the economics profession has been basically more conservative than the educated classes generally\" (pp. 54-55). However, he repeated that \"economists exert a minor and scarcely detectable influence on the societies in which they live\" (p. 63), and \"[t]he main lesson I draw from our experience as preachers is that we are well received in the measure that we preach what the society wishes to hear\" (p. 13). G. J. Stigler, The Economist as Preacher, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1982.\n\n11. I concur with the view that knowledge is not merely information; \"it is also interpretation and judgment…. By providing powerful interpretation and scrupulous judgment, economists can take a more vital role in public discourse…. Error may be corrected when the individual discovers a new interpretation: knowledge includes not only information, but also insight: insight, that is to new and superior interpretation.\" Daniel B. Klein, \"Introduction,\" What Do Economists Contrib-ute? pp. 1 ff. The quoted passages are on pp. 5 and 6.\n\n12. I realize that this is a strong statement. There is an inevitable distortion of our perspectives produced by chronological selection. Few people who are great thinkers in the eyes of their contemporaries stand the test of time and are still con-sidered great by future generations. As a result, we are often led to believe that there are more great scholars among our contemporaries than there were in the past. However, even if we allow for this distortion, it seems still true to me that a very large number of the great liberal thinkers of all times belong to this century. Furthermore, even though ideas always have parents, in the sense that their origin can be traced back to past achievements, the case for freedom as presented by today's thinkers is more consistently argued and better supported than ever before.\n\n13. Angus Maddison, \"Phases of Capitalist Development,\" Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Quarterly Review, 1977, 103, as quoted by Samuel Brittan, \"How British Is the British Sickness?\" The Journal of Law & Economics, Vol. XXI, No. 2 (October 1978), pp. 245 ff.\n\n14. Daniel T. Jones, \"Output, Employment, and Labour Productivity in Europe Since 1955,\" as quoted by Brittan, \"How British Is the British Sickness?\" p. 247.\n\n15. Ibid.\n\n16. Mancur Olson, \"How Ideas Affect Societies: Is Britain the Wave of the Future?\" in Ideas Interests & Consequences, Institute of Economic Affairs, London, 1989, pp. 23 ff. He was also convinced that \"there are special circumstances in which ideas can play a large role\" and that \"widely accepted ideas can sometimes overcome the strongest organized interests\" (p. 24).\n\n17. I feel strongly about this because from the late 1950s and on, socialist economic thinking has been massively imported from Cambridge, UK, into Italy with devastating consequences for our economy. Just to give you an illustration of the extent to which bad British economics has colonized our universities, according to one of my students' dissertation, of the 50 textbooks on macroeconomics most used in Italian universities, 49 are Keynesian.\n\n18.

On the contrary, there are good reasons to believe that monetary instability hinders long-term projects and makes economic growth more difficult, as evidenced by the experience of a number of Latin American countries.\n\n20. There is no stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment: An unexpected acceleration of inflation may temporarily reduce unemployment below its \"natural rate,\" but this effect is short-lived. M. Friedman, \"The Role of Monetary Policy,\" The American Economic Review, Vol. 58, No. 1 (March 1968); M. Friedman, Unemployment versus Inflation?

Bordo and Anna J. Schwartz, \"The Importance of Stable Money: Theory and Evidence,\" Cato Journal 3, Spring 1983, pp. 63-82. Manipulation of monetary aggregates can influence interest rates only temporarily: As soon as inflationary expectations catch up with reality, the Keynesian \"liquidity effect\" is replaced by the \"Fisher effect,\" which will more than offset the initial impact of the unexpected change in monetary policy. See Daniel L. Thornton, \"The Effects of Monetary Policy on Short-Term Interest Rates,\" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May-June 1988, pp. 53 ff. Nominal interest rates tend to be higher, not lower, when monetary policy is loose. As for stabilization policies, it is now largely (though certainly not unanimously) agreed that our insufficient knowledge, unreliable short-run macroeconomic forecasts, and variable time lags in the impact of monetary policy decisions make it likely that policies aimed at stabilizing the short run may end up being pro-cyclical rather than anti-cyclical. Attempts at \"fine-tuning\" the economy often result in additional, avoidable instability. \"Monetarists...favor stable policy rules that reduce variability and uncertainty for private decision-makers. They argue that government serves the economy best by enhancing stability and acting predictably, not by trying to engineer carefully timed changes in policy actions which are frequently destabilizing.\" Allan H. Meltzer, \"Is Monetarism Dead?\" National Review, November 4, 1991, p. 31. See Milton Friedman, \"Commodity-Reserve Currency,\" Journal of Political Economy, Vol. LIX (June 1951), pp. 203-232; Milton Friedman, \"The Optimum Quantity of Money,\" in The Optimum Quantity of Money and Other Essays, Aldine Publishing Company, Chicago, 1969; Gottfried Haberler, Economic Growth & Stability: An Analysis of Economic Change and Policies, Nash Publishing, Los Angeles, 1974; Christina D.

The devastating consequences of the attempt to cure inflation by controlling wages and prices were brilliantly shown by Samuel Brittan and Peter Lilley in The Delusion of Incomes Policy, Temple Smith, London, 1977.\n\n22. Henry C. Simons, \"Some Reflections on Syndicalism,\" The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. LII, No. 1 (March 1944), pp. 1-25.\n\n23. Simons's analysis of the damages produced by restrictive union practices was absolutely devastating. Because of it, he risked being fired by the University of Chicago and was saved thanks only to the adamant defense of Frank Knight. He was well aware of the explosive nature of his criticism: \"Questioning the virtues of the organized labor movement is like attacking religion, monogamy, motherhood, or the home. Among the modern intelligentsia any doubts about collective bargaining admit of explanation only in terms of insanity, knavery, or subservience to 'the interests'. Discussion of skeptical views runs almost entirely in terms of how one came by such persuasion, as though they were symptoms of disease. One simply cannot argue that organization is injurious to labor; one is either for labor or against it, and the test is one's attitude toward unionism.\" He thought however, that too much was at stake for an honest scholar to remain silent: \"Here, possibly, is an awful dilemma: democracy cannot live with tight occupational monopolies; and it cannot destroy them, once they attain great power, without destroying itself in the process.\" In fact, the publication of the paper was delayed for three years. In the first of its footnotes, we read: \"The manuscript of this article was prepared in 1941. It was designed, not for publication, but as an exercise in formulating privately some persuasions or prejudices which kept creeping into discussions of other subjects or problems. Later, several friends looked at the manuscript. Some of them, though not all, questioned the presumption against publication. So the matter was referred to the editors. After they decided to publish, one insert and a few footnotes were added to the original draft.\"\n\n24. Olson attributes the gradual decline of economic performance to the accumulated power of vested interests: \"The different rates of growth in different periods and places that I have described can be understood only if we look at 'distributional coalitions', or special-interest organizations and collusions.... Britain has indeed only gradually become one of the slowest growing developed countries. It also has the dense and powerful network of special-interest organizations, and these again have accumulated gradually...that is, organizations of firms or individuals that combine to increase the price of what they sell, or to influence the government, or to do both. The professional organization, the trade union, the farm organization, the trade association, and the 'oligopolistic collusion' are the leading examples of these 'cartelistic' and lobbying organizations.\" M. Olson, \"How Ideas Affect Societies: Is Britain the Wave of the Future?\" pp. 29-31.\n\n25. Brittan, \"How British Is the British Sickness?\" p. 258.\n\n26. These provide a wonderful illustration of the devastating power of wrong ideas, confirming Frank H. Knight's wisdom: \"The problem is not that people know so little economics. The problem is that they know so much that ain't so.\"\n\n27. Alan Budd, \"Reaganomics--A UK Perspective,\" in Reaganomics and After, Institute of Economic Affairs, 1989, pp. 89 ff.

The quoted passage appears on pp. 80-81. \"In both countries the principal gain from taming public sector unions was not the direct saving in wage payments to the affected workers. Rather, it was the successful signaling to the US private sector that the government would not be frightened by the prospect of public inconvenience into intervening in labour disputes, and to the UK private sector that a new, non-inflationary attitude towards wage settlements by private sector employers would receive government support. In America, this contributed to a record stability in unit labour costs; in Britain, it provided an atmosphere and a legal climate in which courageous revolutionaries...could sweep away Luddite work rule which, until then, had prevented British industry from taking advantage of modern technology, and imprisoned it in a declining spiral acceptable to the ruling soft left of tenured academics, genteel, BBC-loving intellectuals, and paternalistic, 'wet' Tories.\"\n\n32.

Perhaps, since the principles and intentions are so similar and since Mrs. Thatcher came to power 20 months before President Reagan, one can say that the USA has had a moderately successful experiment in Thatcherism.\" Alan Budd, \"Reaganomics--A UK Perspective,\" pp. 89 ff., p. 109.\n\n35. \"Thirty Years On,\" in Thirty Years On, Anniversary Celebrations 1957-1987, Institute of Economic Affairs, London, 1987, pp. 33 ff.\n\n36.
