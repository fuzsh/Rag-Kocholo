        "text": "(1925–2013). The first woman to be elected prime minister of the United Kingdom was Margaret Thatcher, who was also the first woman to hold such a post in the history of Europe. The first prime minister since the 1820s to win three consecutive elections, Thatcher held office longer than any other 20th-century British leader.\n\nMargaret Hilda Roberts was born on October 13, 1925, at Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. She ran errands for the Conservative Party in the 1935 election and maintained this association as a member of the Oxford University Conservative Association. A science graduate of Oxford, she worked as a research chemist.\n\nHer first attempts to win a seat in Parliament were in 1950 and 1951. She lost both elections. In 1951 she married businessman Denis Thatcher. To equip herself for politics she began studying law, with an emphasis on taxation and patent policy. In 1959 Thatcher ran again for Parliament from a safe Conservative north London district and won. She served as secretary to the Ministry of Pensions and Insurance from 1961 to 1964 and as secretary of state for education and science in Edward Heath’s Cabinet from 1970 to 1974. After the Conservative Party’s loss of two general elections in 1974, she followed Heath as head of the party. When the Conservative Party won the 1979 elections, Thatcher became prime minister.\n\nShe belonged to the most conservative wing of her party, advocating cuts in taxation, an end to government controls, and reductions in public expenditures. Her early policies caused widespread unemployment and a number of business bankruptcies. A popular victory in the Falkland Islands conflict of 1982, however, led to a landslide victory in the 1983 elections. Her stature as a world leader increased when she visited the Soviet Union in March 1987, less than three months before she won another remarkable victory.\n\nThatcher’s declared objective was to “destroy socialism.” Her “unfinished revolution” to reshape British political, economic, and social life—mainly through privatization—was labeled Thatcherism. Because of her strong leadership, she was called the Iron Lady. She supported the NATO alliance and the European Communities, though her opposition to “Europe 1992” integration adversely affected her popularity and helped lead to her resignation in November 1990.\n\nDespite her official withdrawal from office, Thatcher continued to cast a shadow over world politics. She was especially outspoken in her opposition to Britain’s participation in several institutions of the European Union, and she outlined her position in her book Statecraft: Strategies for a Changing World (2002). In 1991 she established the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, which promotes democracy and free markets, particularly in the formerly communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe. She was made a peeress for life in the House of Lords in 1992, and in 1995 Queen Elizabeth II conferred upon her the Order of the Garter, the highest British civil and military honor. In March 2002, after suffering a series of minor strokes, Thatcher announced her retirement from public life. She died on April 8, 2013, in London, England."
