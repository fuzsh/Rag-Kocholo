        "meta_description": "Margaret Thatcher brought about sweeping changes to the civil service in the 1980s. The traditional concept of public, defined by Samuelson as “non-rivalrous” and “non-excludable”, was called into question by Thatcherism. Indeed, Thatcher’s doctrine, in line with neo-liberalism, was centred on competition. In order to achieve an efficient allocation of resources and to get the economy on track again, it was necessary to reduce the intervention of the state and endorse markets. Thatcher’s belief that the private sector was more capable of promoting competition and achieving efficiency gains led to the implementation of a vast programme of privatisations, including the privatisation of utilities, transport and telecommunications. Even in central public institutions where privatization was ruled out, the drive towards greater efficiency through the introduction of competition led to the marketisation of remaining public services and a blurring of the public and private spheres. The civil service has thus been reduced in size and scope. Some of the government’s central functions such as Recruitment and Assessment Services and HMSO have been sold to the private sector too. Rather than calling into question the privatisation and marketisation of the public sector, New Labour embraced Thatcherite free market reforms. Further measures to privatise government-owned entities have been initiated by the current coalition government and the marketisation of government services has been taken to another level. However, to say that the continuity in the civil service since the 1980s is a direct result of Thatcherism would be excluding a whole number of other influences that have brought about change to the civil service. Nevertheless, Thatcher certainly provided the impetus to bring about civil service reform and this, on the whole, was not called into question by her successors.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Rejection of the Post-War Keynesian model and the Rise of a New Right Paradigm\n\nReform of the civil service under Margaret Thatcher\n\n6The Financial Management Initiative (FMI) was also created to enable greater financial management of government departments. It called for changes to style and management, devolved authority and accountable management. New planning systems were introduced and short term targets. From 1984 onwards, all department had to follow a budget system, review activities, set objectives and priorities.\n\nContinuity and change in civil service reform from 1990 to 2010\n\nThe coalition government’s approach to civil service reform : a Thatcherite policy?\n\n17The major reforms by the coalition are very much in line with the cost-saving drives of the Rayner Scrutinies. Moreover, in August 2010, the government announced the appointment of the retailer Sir Philip Green. He was commissioned to examine government expenditure and identify savings. This is very much reminiscent of the appointment of Rayner under Margaret Thatcher.\n\n21The newly appointed head of the civil service, John Manzoni, emphasised four priorities when he addressed the Institute for Government in February. Two of them can be said to be very much in line with Thatcher ideology: namely developing functional leadership and performance management.\n\nThatcherite legacy : an optical illusion ?\n\n23It is clear from the aforementioned analysis that Thatcher’s policies to reform the civil service represented a clear break with the past and a number of her policies were continued under her predecessors. However, concluding that changes to the civil service since the 1980s are a direct legacy of Thatcherism would be missing some of the other major influences on civil service reform. Indeed, there were also other influences that have brought about the transformation of the public realm and the civil service. Such changes may therefore have been wrongly attributed to Thatcherism rather than other influences.\n\n25All such recommendations were implemented to some extent by Thatcher and her predecessors. Even the idea of contracting out can be said to have its origins in the Fulton Report. Indeed, the latter recommended that certain works could be ’hived off’ from central Government departments to autonomous boards or corporations. It recommended the hiving off of the Post Office, Royal Mint, Air Traffic Control and parts of the Social Services.\n\nNPM and neo-liberalism\n\n29 1) Marketisation, which means introducing market competition into public services by separating the purchaser from the provider, creating “quasi-markets” within the public sector (notably in healthcare, education, social services and social housing) and competitive tendering or outsourcing to the private sector;\n\n2) Disaggregation, which refers to the strengthening of central strategic capacity by decoupling policy and executive functions; tighter central control over policy and frameworks and a move from concentrating on process to output in control and accountability mechanisms and, finally\n\n3) Incentivisation, which means creating performance indicators to encourage greater entrepreneurialism, more results, overall greater efficiency, performance linked pay in order to create incentives for public sector staff to be more efficient, human resource management strategies and the deprivileging of professionals and public sector workers.\n\n30In the 1990s, international organisations such as the OECD and World Bank went as far as to recommend new public management in national governance systems. In the 1980s, many economies were experiencing the same pressures to reform. Indeed, recession meant that governments had to reassess and then reduce public expenditure. Like Britain, from the mid-70s, most OECD countries were facing a slowdown in growth and productivity and suffering from the 1970s energy crisis.\n\n31To increase efficiency and balance budgets, these international organisations encouraged governments to adopt similar practices to those of the private sector. Managers should be allowed powers to temper the power of professionals and unions to ensure continued efficiency. Financial control and accounting systems similar to the private sector were also held up as models.\n\n32However, Britain’s economic decline and fiscal crisis was comparatively worse than its key competitors and this may have led to the conservative governments applying NPM measures earlier than other countries. A number of academics have linked the rise of NPM policies with the rise of the New Right and Thatcherism in the UK, but Labour governments in some countries, such as Australia, also introduced NPM policies. NPM itself emerged from new institutional economics, which was based on public choice and transaction cost theories which underlined the need to reduce the intervention of the state and to establish representative forms of governance over bureaucracy, combined with the “managerialist” school of thought. The latter encouraged the establishment of effective managerial principles from the private sector. Public choice theory also underlined the need for centralisation to reduce the overriding influence of bureaucracy. The assumptions about private sector management techniques were that they were superior to public management and public administration.\n\n33Successive reforms of the civil service in the UK have clearly been influenced by NPM. Indeed, the New Steps report is very much in line with New Public Management theory. The report focuses on the need to improve management and to concentrate on outputs rather than inputs which are part and parcel of NPM. As a conclusion it states :\n\n41 Efficiency Unit, Improving Management in Government - the Next Steps, 1988, op.cit.\n\n“The key themes that emerge as obstacles in the way of real change are :\n\na) the lack of focus of top management on the service delivery and executive functions of government\n\nb) the effects of treating the civil service as a single organisation\n\nc) the lack of effective pressure to get better results ”\n\n34NPM did actually develop into what has been called post-NPM or digital governance under New Labour, which was intended to make up for the shortfalls of NPM (fragmented governance, lack of cohesion…) .\n\n35More generally, many of the reforms that have taken place since Margaret Thatcher’s arrival in government have been linked to neo-liberalism. Neo-liberalism, which draws on the principles of neo-classical economics advocates reduction of government spending, tax-based reforms, open markets and limited protectionism and the privatisation of state-run businesses. Thatcherism seems to have been inspired by neo-liberalism. However, the adherence to neo-liberal policies is not a unique feature of the UK. From the 1980s onwards, a series of European Directives encouraged the liberalisation of public sectors and notably the electricity sector, postal services, public transport… The contracting out of services such as hospital catering, rubbish collection and highway maintenance has now become common in France, Germany and Spain. The European Union has sought to go further with market reforms of public services.\n\nConclusion\n\n37The civil service has experienced a number of changes since the arrival of Margaret Thatcher in government. It has been reduced in size and scope. Some of the government’s central functions such as Recruitment and Assessment Services and HMSP have been sold to the private sector too. Indeed, Christopher Clifford of Nuffield College underlines how the civil service was transformed under Margaret Thatcher and its legacy within the civil service today:\n\n43 House of Lords, Select Committee on Public Service Report, op. cit.\n\n“I would say if you look at the history of the Civil Service as far back as Northcote-Trevelyan I cannot think of anything as radical or as far reaching as the Next Step and the later reforms.”\n\n38This has led to undermining the standing of the British civil service, which was previously held up as a model for its lack of political bias, integrity, impartiality, objectivity, loyalty and freedom from corruption. It would seem that seeking greater efficiency has resulted in division and disunity in the Civil Service. However, to say that the continuity in the civil service since the 1980s is a direct result of Thatcherism would be excluding a whole number of other influences that have brought about change to the civil service, notably the Fulton report of 1968, , the influence of NPM and post-NPM and neo-liberalism. Nevertheless, Thatcher certainly provided the impetus to bring about civil service reform and this, on the whole, was not called into question by her successors."
