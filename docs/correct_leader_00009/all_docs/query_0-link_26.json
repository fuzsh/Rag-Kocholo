        "text": "Margaret Thatcher's premiership was a time of immense social and economic change.\n\nElected just after the industrial unrest of the \"Winter of Discontent\", she embarked on a tough reform programme with the top priorities of tackling inflation and the unions.\n\nShe presided over a shift from centralised, state-controlled institutions to privatisation and economic reform.\n\nBut her policies divided the country as the service sector and home ownership boomed, but manufacturing declined and unemployment rose.\n\nBelow are some key indicators of Mrs Thatcher's years in power, May 1979 - November 1990, with the three preceding and following years for context.\n\nOne of Margaret Thatcher's first goals was taming inflation which had reached dizzying heights of over 25% in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe incoming Conservative government raised interest rates sharply and brought in tough public spending curbs.\n\nA recession followed and unemployment shot up. This also led to reduced wage demands and a slowing of the rate of inflation, although this crept up once more in the boom of the late 1980s.\n\nUnemployment had been rising throughout the 1970s as companies set about restructuring and modernising their businesses.\n\nBut it picked up speed after the Conservatives took power in 1979, rapidly rising to over three million out of work in 1983.\n\nUnemployment hit hardest in Northern Ireland, where one in five people was out of work in the early 1980s, along with the industrial areas of northern England and Scotland.\n\nAn economic boom later in the decade helped to bring unemployment down, but it was a slow process.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of high unemployment, the Coal Board announced in early 1984 that 20 uneconomic pits would have to close, putting 20,000 miners out of work.\n\nIt was the government's second attempt to close these pits, after a climb-down in 1981.\n\nMiners at the endangered Cortonwood colliery in Yorkshire walked out on 5 March 1984 in protest at the plans. Within a week, more than half the country's miners were on strike.\n\nThe dispute lasted a year and led to conflict not only with police but between miners who supported the strike and those who did not.\n\nWhen the miners returned to work, the pit closure programme continued."
