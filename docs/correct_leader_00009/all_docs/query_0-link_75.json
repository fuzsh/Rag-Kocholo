        "text": "The Campaign\n\nThe Conservatives' manifesto was formed around three pillars - defence, employment and economic prosperity. The Tories remained committed to membership of the European Community, an independent nuclear deterrent, trade union reform, further privatisation, a long-term reduction in taxation and a war on inflation.\n\nThe Labour manifesto, New Hope for Britain, was later dubbed \"the longest suicide note in history\". At its core was a 12-point plan with firm pledges including withdrawal from the Common Market, the abolition of the House of Lords, the cancellation of the Trident nuclear programme and the removal of Cruise missiles from Britain. The Alliance's first manifesto, Working Together for Britain, advocated proportional representation, devolution for Scotland and Wales and multilateral disarmament.\n\nA week into the campaign, Labour began to falter. Denis Healey, Labour's deputy leader, voiced his opinion on BBC's Newsnight that Britain's nuclear deterrent would only be disposed of if the USSR made \"adequate concessions\". This led Joan Ruddock, chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), to contend that this did not amount to a non-nuclear policy.\n\nThe Conservatives remained on top throughout the campaign. In an attempt to catch up, Labour tried to promote the idea of a Tory \"secret manifesto\", publishing private documents which, they believed, highlighted the Government's real plans. These \"revelations\" included the claim from Healey that Mrs Thatcher had lied about the trend of unemployment. Neil Kinnock, the shadow Secretary for Education, published a report by the National Economic Development Council which he claimed Ministers had supressed to hide the truth about Britain's economic performance.\n\nDefence was the key to Labour's downfall. Foot was forced to modify the manifesto's defence commitments, saying Labour would \"move towards\" a non-nuclear defence policy and the removal of nuclear bases. However, his speech was shot down the next day by the former Labour Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, who said Polaris had been an effective deterrent and should not be unilaterally given up.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alliance made few in-roads. Despite more television coverage than ever before the voters remained disinterested. With a fortnight to go before polling day, they decided to push David Steel into the spotlight but retain Roy Jenkins as their Prime Minister-designate. With the polls about to close, the Tories looked likely to romp home by benefiting from the split in the opposition vote.\n\nOne voter tried to change his mind...\n\nBack to the top"
