        "text": "Success story from one of my networking clients who 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗱 𝗮 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗷𝗼𝗯! She asked me to help her grow her network. She had moved to a new city for a job, and it wasn't going well. The company she moved for wasn't performing. She was worried about job security. She was looking for ideas to grow her network, So she joined my coaching group. I told her to make a list of 10 people she had worked with in the past and re-connect with them. One of them was a former boss. He lived in another state, but she re-connected anyway. He responded and they caught up on each other's lives. She didn't tell him about her concerns with her job. She simply asked how he was doing? They had a normal conversation catching up on what each other had been up to. Eventually he said, \"I have a position at my company. Would you be interested?\" She said yes. She interviewed and a month later had a new job. She said to me, \"𝗜𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗜 𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝟭𝟬 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗜 𝗮𝗹𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆 𝗸𝗻𝗲𝘄.

Do one of these: ✅ Comment on this post: this tells the algorithm you want me in your feed ✅ Follow me or the #theintrovertednetworker hashtag, or ✅ Ring the notification 🔔on my profile Doing these guarantees you'll see me in your newsfeed.\n\nDoes your job search seems to drag on month after month without producing results? So what do you do to stay sane as your job search drags on? First, take a good close look at how you have been conducting your search. It's possible that the lack of traction is related to your current process and practices. For instance, many job seekers understand the importance of networking but they don't actually do it. Next, here are some ideas for staying sane: - Visit your college career center - Take a bridge job - Take some self-assessment tests to learn more about You - Accept and release the past - Don't let the \"shoulds\" hold you back - Don't let negative people get you down - Follow what you enjoy most doing - Do some projects at home or in your community - Reduce expenses - Join meet-up groups virtually and in person - Be social, Go to weekly networking events near you - Go to professional gatherings in your industry - Volunteer, Do pro bono work, Help others - Be a mentor - Support other job seekers you may know - Visit your local public library - Don't give up - Go for walks, Get out of the house - Take a breather, Give yourself grace - Be disciplined, Set priorities and stick to them - Be open to doing something different, something new - Start a small business - Take courses, Learn something new every day Finally, don't beat yourself up over the lack of results. This 2024 job market is very weird right now. Hang in there. It will get better.\n\nI crossed 3000 followers on LinkedIn yesterday! Wow. What a journey. It wasn’t long ago that I was just another professional, blending into the crowd. But yesterday, I crossed the 3000-follower mark. How did I get here? 1️⃣ LISTEN first, speak second. I started by engaging with others. Genuinely. Asking questions. Offering help. 2️⃣ SHARE stories, not stats. Numbers are great, but stories? They connect. I shared my journey, my ups and downs. Authenticity resonates. 3️⃣ VALUE over volume. Quality over quantity. One valuable post is better than ten average ones. Focus on what truly matters to your audience. 4️⃣ NETWORK like a pro. Reach out. Build relationships. Not connections. Relationships. They matter. A lot. 5️⃣ CONSISTENCY is key. Regular posting. Consistent messaging. People notice. Trust builds over time. But here’s the real secret... YOU! Yes, you – my network. Every comment, every like, every share. You made this possible. Thank you! Why does this matter? Because if I can do it, so can you. Growing your LinkedIn presence isn’t just about numbers. It’s about creating opportunities. Finding connections. Building your brand. 3000 is not just a number. It’s a community. A support system. A network of professionals who are growing together. Need help?

Unlock your potential and make your LinkedIn profile work for you.\n\nDo you find LinkedIn 'weird'? Some of the points in this article I recognise: 💬 There's more sharing of 'personal stuff'. I don't see the problem with this. It's how we get to know each other, and it can help to educate in some instances. Many of us share some personal stuff with work colleagues when in an office. 💡 And if we don't want to learn about the people behind the profile we can easily Unfollow or Disconnect. 💡 And if you don't want to share your personal stuff you don't have to. 💬 LinkedIn has its own language. The examples in this article are just 'business language' in my experience. I used to hear them all the time in my corporate career and I hear far worse on The Apprentice! If you want a new corporate job then you may feel you need to use it. Or you may use it without thinking because you've always had a corporate career. 💡 Use the language you're comfortable with and that people you want to Connect with, will understand. 💬 We are all just brands and must always be selling. Sure, LinkedIn is a marketing tool, including marketing yourself if you're looking for a new role. It's also great for learning from people and helping others learn. 💡 The key thing is to be clear about what you want to use LinkedIn for and focus on that. 💬 Do we even still have lives outside work at all? Of course we do! And this is increasingly reflected on LinkedIn. If you work in an office would you expect people to not make friends, meet partners, etc? 💡 Decide what works and doesn't work for you. Where are your boundaries between professional, personal and private? If you've been thinking about using LinkedIn for your job search or career development but reading this article puts you off, DM me. I can help you understand how to use LinkedIn in a way that works for you 💛\n\nLinkedIn can be a depressing place. Conflicting advice, bad advice, scam artists, bloody “know-alls”!! Shiny happy people with their shiny happy careers. Or People at their wits end, trying to figure out how to make the platform work for them. Interact with too many posts of like-minded people can tell your feed to give you more of the same: Not healthy. It can be a brilliant source of support too! How to tap into the algorithm is a topic doing the rounds. I wouldn’t copy this format if you’re trying to do that 🤣 It’s hard to know what’s real. And it can get me down, too. For the sake of keeping it real, and new followers & connections, a little about me: I am a full-time carer and dad to my kids. One has autism and the other quite a few quirks of their own. 🧍♂️🧍♀️ My very hardworking wife & I are so proud of them 😊 CV Writing, interview prep, and all the other bits & pieces I do are almost hobbies. I hope that one day they will become something that pays all the bills! Because I’m bloody good! And I care deeply about the fortunes of those I work with, while not making a fortune myself. I’m fascinated by history, heritage & the arts. I worked in tourism for about 25 years, most notably at the Guinness Storehouse. ☘️ I love the Irish football team, and once told a large group I was invited to speak to that representing Ireland through my work with people from all over the world at Guinness was my equivalent of wearing the green jersey at Lansdowne Road. I wasn’t lying! I miss it every day, but it was time to step away. How people work, and how I can help them in their work is my professional passion: “Writing CVs that will make you blush” and all that ☺️ There will come a time when my kids don’t need me around all day. That’s where the next phase of my career lies. Seemingly I should end this post with a “CTA” - a call to action. I’m not going to do that, but here’s a few suggestions to keep you on the LinkedIn straight & narrow: 💡Actively follow individuals, companies, and organizations representing diverse industries, interests, and perspectives. ⭐️ Engage with a variety of content by liking, commenting, and sharing posts across different subjects. 🙋♂️ Show up as your true self. Always. 🧐 Periodically review and adjust your follow list to maintain a well-rounded feed. 🏖️ Take a break! Unless you make some or part of your living through the platform (and even if you do!), an occasional LinkedIn detox will do you no harm. I promise! 👀 Lastly - if you think I can help you, take a look at my profile. If I can help, I will 😊 As one of the people who was kind enough to give a testimonial wrote, I’m a “natural ‘go to’ person for lots of people owing to the fact that [I have] lots of experience in lots of areas.” And beyond the hall of mirrors that LinkedIn can sometimes become, I try to keep it real 😊 Go raibh maith agaibh Ger\n\n🚨 Featured #LinkedInQuestion 🚨: I'm in career transition and someone offered their connections to help me. When leveraging someone else's connections, do you only contact the connections for the companies that you have applied to or is there a certain process that should be used? ANSWER from Brenda Meller🥧: great question! The good news is that this person is volunteering to be of service to you. Here's what I would do: 1. Look at that person's connections and see if there is anyone who works for one of your target companies. 2. Message the person, tell them the name of the person, and ask if they would be open to making a LinkedIn introduction. I'd use this text (or some variation): \"Hi Laurie, thanks again for offering to leverage your connections to help me during my job search. I see you're connected to Bobbi Smith who works at ABC Company, which is one of my target companies. Would you be open to introducing us via a LinkedIn message? Thanks! Brenda Meller\" 3. Then, after they do the LinkedIn message introduction, reply to the group thread first and say something like this \"Hi Bobbi, nice to meet you here. I'll follow up separately and invite you to connect on LinkedIn.\" 4. Keep the original person in the loop as you go through the process. Let them know when you've made contact with their connection, as well as well you eventually land your next role. Thank them and offer to be a resource to them in the future to return the favor. Hope this helps!\n\nToday's post contains my final top tips on how to create a stand out LinkedIn Profile for anyone who is job searching or considering a career change. If you are reviewing your profile then have a look at the past few days for some key advice and then read on to make sure your profile is complete before you start applying for roles. 👌 Recommendations Absolutely crucial to have recommendations from all stages of your career. Start with education and ask teachers or professors then move onto all of your roles and focus on colleagues, managers, leaders and clients. Consider asking them to note specific projects or pieces of work and to use any keywords or phrases too. Remember that they must be directly connected with you on LinkedIn so a 1st connection. Be nice - give a recommendation back 🏆 Accomplishments This is not every pub quiz you won or scout badge you ever received but all of that extra learning and development you have done throughout your career. If you have certificates then even better! 🎸 Interests Sadly not where you can list all of your hobbies folks. This section pull s information automatically from organisations you are following and groups you are in. Rarely looked at but worth seeing what companies you are following and if you can enhance it a little. 🌎 If you are looking for roles internationally then you can translate certain parts of your profile into another language. Head to LinkedIn Help to get a full breakdown of how to do this as there are several steps. All the very best with your job search and if you ever need any extra support then don't hesitate to get in touch. _________________________________________________________________________________ 👋 Hi!
