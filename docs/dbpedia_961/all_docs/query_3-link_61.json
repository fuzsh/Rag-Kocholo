        "text": "As one of the best known, awarded, and financially successful composers in US history, John Williams is as easy to recall as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland or Leonard Bernstein, illustrating why he is \"America's composer\" time and again. With a massive list of awards that includes over 52 Oscar nominations (five wins), twenty-odd Gold and Platinum Records, and a slew of Emmy (two wins), Golden Globe (three wins), Grammy (25 wins), National Board of Review (including a Career Achievement Award), Saturn (six wins), American Film Institute (including a Lifetime Achievement Award) and BAFTA (seven wins) citations, along with honorary doctorate degrees numbering in the teens, Williams is undoubtedly one of the most respected composers for Cinema. He's led countless national and international orchestras, most notably as the nineteenth conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra from 1980-1993, helming three Pops tours of the US and Japan during his tenure. He currently serves as the Pop's Conductor Laureate. Also to his credit is a parallel career as an author of serious, and some not-so-serious, concert works - performed by the likes of Mstislav Rostropovich, André Previn, Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Gil Shaham, Leonard Slatkin, James Ingram, Dale Clevenger, and Joshua Bell. Of particular interests are his Essay for Strings, a jazzy Prelude & Fugue, the multimedia presentation American Journey (aka The Unfinished Journey (1999)), a Sinfonietta for Winds, a song cycle featuring poems by Rita Dove, concerti for flute, violin, clarinet, trumpet, tuba, cello, bassoon and horn, fanfares for the 1984, 1988 and 1996 Summer Olympics, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and a song co-written with Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman for the Special Olympics! But such a list probably warrants a more detailed background...\n\nBorn in Flushing, New York on February 8, 1932, John Towner Williams discovered music almost immediately, due in no small measure to being the son of a percussionist for CBS Radio and the Raymond Scott Quintet. After moving to Los Angeles in 1948, the young pianist and leader of his own jazz band started experimenting with arranging tunes; at age 15, he determined he was going to become a concert pianist; at 19, he premiered his first original composition, a piano sonata.\n\nHe attended both UCLA and the Los Angeles City College, studying orchestration under MGM musical associate Robert Van Eps and being privately tutored by composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, until conducting for the first time during three years with the U.S. Air Force. His return to the states brought him to Julliard, where renowned piano pedagogue Madame Rosina Lhevinne helped Williams hone his performance skills. He played in jazz clubs to pay his way; still, she encouraged him to focus on composing. So it was back to L.A., with the future maestro ready to break into the Hollywood scene.\n\nWilliams found work with the Hollywood studios as a piano player, eventually accompanying such fare such as the TV series Peter Gunn (1958), Süd Pazifik (1958), Manche mögen's heiß (1959), Das Appartement (1960), and Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962), as well as forming a surprising friendship with Bernard Herrmann. At age 24, \"Johnny Williams\" became a staff arranger at Columbia and then at 20th Century-Fox, orchestrating for Alfred Newman and Lionel Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman, and other Golden Age notables. In the field of popular music, he performed and arranged for the likes of Vic Damone, Doris Day, and Mahalia Jackson... all while courting actress/singer Barbara Ruick, who became his wife until her death in 1974. John & Barbara had three children; their daughter is now a doctor, and their two sons, Joseph Williams and Mark Towner Williams, are rock musicians.\n\nThe orchestrating gigs led to serious composing jobs for television, notably Alcoa Premiere (1961), Checkmate (1960), Gilligans Insel (1964), Verschollen zwischen fremden Welten (1965), Planet der Giganten (1968), and his Emmy-winning scores for Heidi kehrt heim (1968) and Das Geheimnis von Schloß Thornfield (1970). Daddy-O (1958) and Because They're Young (1960) brought his original music to the big theatres, but he was soon typecast doing comedies. His efforts in the genre helped guarantee his work on William Wyler's Wie klaut man eine Million? (1966), however, a major picture that immediately led to larger projects. Of course, his arrangements continued to garner attention, and he won his first Oscar for adapting Anatevka (1971).\n\nDuring the '70s, he was King of Disaster Scores with Die Höllenfahrt der Poseidon (1972), Erdbeben (1974) and Flammendes Inferno (1974). His psychological score for Spiegelbilder (1972) remains one of the most innovative works in soundtrack history. But his Americana - particularly Der Gauner (1969) - is what caught the ear of director Steven Spielberg, then preparing for his first feature, Sugarland Express (1974). When Spielberg reunited with Williams on Der weiße Hai (1975), they established themselves as a blockbuster team, the composer gained his first Academy Award for Original Score, and Spielberg promptly recommended Williams to a friend, George Lucas. In 1977, John Williams re-popularized the epic cinema sound of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Franz Waxman and other composers from the Hollywood Golden Age: Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) became the best selling score-only soundtrack of all time, and spawned countless musical imitators. For the next five years, though the music in Hollywood changed, John Williams wrote big, brassy scores for big, brassy films - Teufelskreis Alpha (1978), Superman - Der Film (1978), 1941 - Wo bitte geht's nach Hollywood (1979), Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981) ... An experiment during this period, Herzquietschen (1981), flopped. There was a long-term change of pace, nonetheless, as Williams fell in love with an interior designer and married once more.\n\nE.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982) brought about his third Oscar, and Menschen am Fluss (1984), Das Reich der Sonne (1987), Die Reisen des Mr. Leary (1988) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989) added variety to the 1980s, as he returned to television with work on Unglaubliche Geschichten (1985) and themes for NBC, including NBC Nightly News (1970). The '80s also brought the only exceptions to the composer's collaboration with Steven Spielberg - others scored both Spielberg's segment of Unheimliche Schattenlichter (1983) and Die Farbe Lila (1985).\n\nIntending to retire, the composer's output became sporadic during the 1990s, particularly after the exciting Jurassic Park (1993) and the masterful, Oscar-winning Schindlers Liste (1993). This lighter workload, coupled with a number of hilarious references on Die Simpsons (1989) actually seemed to renew interest in his music. Two Home Alone films (1990, 1992), JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991), Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), Sleepers (1996), Sieben Jahre in Tibet (1997), Der Soldat James Ryan (1998), Die Asche meiner Mutter (1999), and a return to familiar territory with Star Wars: Episode I - Die dunkle Bedrohung (1999) recalled his creative diversity of the '70s.\n\nIn this millennium, the artist shows no interest in slowing down. His relationships with Spielberg and Lucas continue in A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001), the remaining Star Wars prequels (2002, 2005), Minority Report (2002), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and a promised fourth Indiana Jones film. There is a more focused effort on concert works, as well, including a theme for the new Walt Disney Concert Hall and a rumored light opera. But one certain highlight is his musical magic for the world of Harry Potter (2001, 2002, 2004, etc.), which he also arranged into a concert suite geared toward teaching children about the symphony orchestra. His music remains on the whistling lips of people around the globe, in the concert halls, on the promenades, in album collections, sports arenas, and parades, and, this writer hopes, touching some place in ourselves. So keep those ears ready wherever you go, 'cause you will likely hear a bit of John Williams on your way.\n\nBorn on February 10, 1929, Jerry Goldsmith studied piano with Jakob Gimpel and composition, theory, and counterpoint with Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. He also attended classes in film composition given by Miklós Rózsa at the Univeristy of Southern California. In 1950, he was employed as a clerk typist in the music department at CBS. There, he was given his first embryonic assignments as a composer for radio shows such as \"Romance\" and \"CBS Radio Workshop\". He wrote one score a week for these shows, which were performed live on transmission. He stayed with CBS until 1960, having already scored Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959). He was hired by Revue Studios to score their series Thriller (1960). It was here that he met the influential film composer Alfred Newman who hired Goldsmith to score the film Einsam sind die Tapferen (1962), his first major feature film score. An experimentalist, Goldsmith constantly pushed forward the bounds of film music: Planet der Affen (1968) included horns blown without mouthpieces and a bass clarinetist fingering the notes but not blowing. He was unafraid to use the wide variety of electronic sounds and instruments which had become available, although he did not use them for their own sake.\n\nHe rose rapidly to the top of his profession in the early to mid-1960s, with scores such as Freud (1962), Träumende Lippen (1965) and Kanonenboot am Yangtse-Kiang (1966). In fact, he received Oscar nominations for all three and another in the 1960s for Planet der Affen (1968). From then onwards, his career and reputation was secure and he scored an astonishing variety of films during the next 30 years or so, from Patton: Rebell in Uniform (1970) to Star Trek - Der Film (1979) and from Chinatown (1974) to The Boys from Brazil - Geheimakte Viertes Reich (1978). He received 17 Oscar nominations but won only once, for Das Omen (1976) in 1977 (Goldsmith himself dismissed the thought of even getting a nomination for work on a \"horror show\"). He enjoyed giving concerts of his music and performed all over the world, notably in London, where he built up a strong relationship with London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nJerry Goldsmith died at age 75 on July 21, 2004 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nGerman-born composer Hans Zimmer is recognized as one of Hollywood's most innovative musical talents. He featured in the music video for The Buggles' single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which became a worldwide hit and helped usher in a new era of global entertainment as the first music video to be aired on MTV (August 1, 1981).\n\nHans Florian Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, then in West Germany, the son of Brigitte (Weil) and Hans Joachim Zimmer. He entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with famed composer and mentor Stanley Myers, which included the film Mein wunderbarer Waschsalon (1985). He soon began work on several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed A World Apart, and during these years Zimmer pioneered the use of combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.\n\nA turning point in Zimmer's career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director Barry Levinson. The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year and earned Zimmer his first Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Score. The next year, Zimmer composed the score for another Best Picture Oscar recipient, Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989), starring Jessica Tandy, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nHaving already scored two Best Picture winners, in the early 1990s, Zimmer cemented his position as a preeminent talent with the award-winning score for Der König der Löwen (1994). The soundtrack has sold over 15 million copies to date and earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, an American Music Award, a Tony, and two Grammy Awards. In total, Zimmer's work has been nominated for 7 Golden Globes, 7 Grammys and seven Oscars for Rain Man (1988), Gladiator (2000), Der König der Löwen (1994), Besser geht's nicht (1997), The Rendezvous mit einem Engel (1996), Der schmale Grat (1998), Der Prinz von Ägypten (1998), and Last Samurai (2003).\n\nWith his career in full swing, Zimmer was anxious to replicate the mentoring experience he had benefited from under Stanley Myers' guidance. With state-of-the-art technology and a supportive creative environment, Zimmer was able to offer film-scoring opportunities to young composers at his Santa Monica-based musical \"think tank.\" This approach helped launch the careers of such notable composers as Mark Mancina, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick Glennie-Smith, and Klaus Badelt.\n\nIn 2000, Zimmer scored the music for Gladiator (2000), for which he received an Oscar nomination, in addition to Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics Awards for his epic score. It sold more than three million copies worldwide and spawned a second album Gladiator: More Music From The Motion Picture, released on the Universal Classics/Decca label. Zimmer's other scores that year included Mission: Impossible II (2000), Der Weg nach El Dorado (2000), and Mit oder ohne - Was Männer haben sollten (2000), directed by Barry Levinson.\n\nSome of his other impressive scores include Pearl Harbor (2001), Ring (2002), four films directed by Ridley Scott; Tricks (2003), Hannibal (2001), Black Hawk Down (2001), and Thelma & Louise (1991), Penny Marshall's Unterwegs mit Jungs (2001), and Eine Klasse für sich (1992), Tony Scott's True Romance (1993), Tränen der Sonne (2003), Ron Howard's Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), Tage des Donners (1990), Fräulein Smillas Gespür für Schnee (1997), and the animated Spirit - Der wilde Mustang (2002) for which he also co-wrote four of the songs with Bryan Adams, including the Golden Globe nominated Here I Am.\n\nAt the 27th annual Flanders International Film Festival, Zimmer performed live for the first time in concert with a 100-piece orchestra and a 100-voice choir. Choosing selections from his impressive body of work, Zimmer performed newly orchestrated concert versions of Gladiator, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rain Man (1988), Der König der Löwen (1994), and Der schmale Grat (1998). The concert was recorded by Decca and released as a concert album entitled \"The Wings Of A Film: The Music Of Hans Zimmer.\"\n\nIn 2003, Zimmer completed his 100th film score for the film The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, for which he received both a Golden Globe and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination. Zimmer then scored Nancy Meyers' comedy Was das Herz begehrt (2003), the animated Dreamworks film, Große Haie - Kleine Fische (2004) (featuring voices of Will Smith, Renée Zellweger, Robert De Niro, Jack Black, and Martin Scorsese), and Jim Brooks' Spanglish (2004) starring Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni (for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination). His 2005 projects include Paramount's The Weather Man (2005) starring Nicolas Cage, Dreamworks' Madagascar (2005), and the Warner Bros. summer release, Batman Begins (2005).\n\nZimmer's additional honors and awards include the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review, and the Frederick Loewe Award in 2003 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. He has also received ASCAP's Henry Mancini Award for Lifetime Achievement. Hans and his wife live in Los Angeles and he is the father of four children.\n\nKnown for his wide-ranging talents, Mark Mancina's film scores traverse almost every genre: drama, action, comedy, suspense, and period epic. His dark, edgy music for the Oscar-winning Training Day (2001), is a benchmark score that expanded the boundaries of scoring street-wise drama, and is widely used as a temp track, while his breakout score for Speed (1994), another innovative work, influenced the sound of subsequent action movies. Mancina's orchestral originality on Für das Leben eines Freundes (1998), reflecting the haunting gloom of its subject, and his score for the period epic Moll Flanders (1996), which appeared on Billboard's Classical Crossover Chart, further point to Mancina's considerable compositional range. Other films include Twister (1996), Bad Boys - Harte Jungs (1995), Con Air (1997), Tödliches Vertrauen (2001), Tarzan (1999), Bärenbrüder (2003), Die Geistervilla (2003), and Sony's 3-D animated short, Early Bloomer (2003).\n\nBut Mancina's achievements as composer for some of the top-grossing films of recent years comprise only one aspect of his diverse career. Composer, producer, songwriter and three-time Grammy winner, he has also added Broadway to his list of accomplishments by writing, producing and arranging the score for Disney's Tony-winning stage production of The Lion King. The foundation for this expansion into theatre was set in the early 1990s when Oscar winning composer Hans Zimmer, recognizing Mancina's varied gifts, asked him to arrange and produce three Elton John songs for what would become the enormously successful original film version of The Lion King. Mancina's efforts on \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight,\" \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King,\" and \"Hakuna Matata\" were rewarded with a multi-platinum record that has sold over ten million copies worldwide, and earned him a Grammy for Best Musical Album for Children and two American Music Awards for Best Pop Album. On the heels of the success of Der König der Löwen (1994), Mancina went on to write and produce additional songs for a Lion King follow-up album entitled Rhythm of the Pridelands featuring South African artist 'Lebo M'. One of Mancina's original songs, \"He Lives In You,\" became a thematic centerpiece for The Lion King theatrical production which opened on Broadway in 1997, and has since been performed to great acclaim in numerous cities around the world. In his role as producer of music for the stage, Mancina collaborated with 'Lebo M', and director Julie Taymor to create the distinctive musical atmosphere of the Tony award winning show. Mancina received a Tony nomination, was awarded Britain's Ivor Novello Award for the London production, and earned his second Grammy for producing the Original Broadway Cast Album.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Mancina spent his childhood in Culver City, then Huntington Beach, California. Commencing his musical training at a very early age, he has performed all his life as a singer, guitarist and pianist. His film and television scores frequently feature Mancina's own performances on piano, guitar, bass, percussion, and drums, highlighting unique sounds harvested from a personal collection of traditional, exotic, and custom instruments from all over the world.\n\nAfter studying composition and performance as a classical guitar major at Cal State Fullerton, he went on to perform on Trevor Rabin's solo tour, and later to write and produce for Yes. He also worked on several records with producer Trevor Horn, including the song \"Crazy,\" performed by Grammy-winning artist Seal. In 1990, Mancina moved from Los Angeles to London for a year to work with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, producing and composing their \"Black Moon\" album for PolyGram. More recently, he has composed and arranged songs with Kenny Loggins. His extensive partnership with Phil Collins includes Disney's animated hit Tarzan (1999), for which Mancina composed the score and co-produced several Collins songs. The ballad \"You'll Be In My Heart,\" which Mancina arranged and co-produced, won the Oscar for Best Song. They renewed their collaborative efforts for the recent Brother Bear for which Mancina co-produced songs and co-composed the dramatic score. In addition to his work in film, theatre and the recording industry, Mancina also writes score and themes for many television projects, which have included \"The Outer Limits,\" \"Poltergeist,\" \"Millennium,\" \"Lifepod,\" and HBO's \"From the Earth to the Moon.\" Among his countless television commercial clients are Nike, Mountain Dew, Jaguar, Skittles, McDonald's, Verizon, Computer Associates, Goodyear, The U.S. Army, American Express and AT&T. Working from his studio in Pasadena, and his home studio, a mountaintop farmhouse/barn, he continues to expand his repertoire, and is currently developing songs for musicals and films.\n\nHenry Jackman has established himself as one of today's top composers by fusing his classical training with his experience as a successful record producer and creator of electronic music.\n\nJackman grew up in the southeast of England, where he began composing his first symphony at the age of six. He studied classical music at Oxford and sang in the St. Paul's Cathedral Choir-but simultaneously got involved in the underground rave scene and began producing popular electronica music and dance remixes, eventually working with artists such as Seal and The Art of Noise.\n\nIn 2006 he caught the attention of film composers Hans Zimmer and John Powell, and began writing additional music for Powell on Kung Fu Panda and then for Zimmer on The Dark Knight, The Da Vinci Code, and The Pirates of the Caribbean films, which rapidly led to scoring blockbuster films on his own. His first solo feature film then came to be 'Monsters v Aliens' directed by Rob Letterman.\n\n\"I've spent a lot of time working in the record industry,\" says Jackman, \"and for my money being a film composer is way more fun. You can be working on X-Men, and then a movie set in 17th-century Italy. It's not about showing off what you think is cool or what you want to hear, but 'what is this movie about, and what would best serve it?' That process just leads to strange and remarkable places.\"\n\nJackman is known for his recent scores for Marvel Studios' 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier', Showtime's 'The Comey Rule', The Russo Brothers' 'Cherry', as well as 'Jumanji: The Next Level', a continuation of the magical board game adventure story, and 'Detective Pikachu', following the story of the beloved Pikachu Pokémon character starring Ryan Reynolds. His other recent work includes 'Ralph Breaks the Internet', which was nominated for Best Animated Feature. His other diverse credits include Captain America: Civil War, Kong: Skull Island, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Big Hero 6, and Kingsman: The Golden Circle.\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams is one of Hollywood's most sought-after and prolific composers whose long list of film and television credits underscore the diverse range of his talents.

In addition, he wrote the music for Disney's live action feature film \"Mulan\" which was directed by Niki Caro with whom he worked previously having scored her film \"The Zookeeper's Wife.\" Gregson-Williams also co-wrote the original song \"Loyal Brave True\" for \"Mulan\" performed by Christina Aguilera. He and his brother, composer Rupert Gregson-Williams, wrote the original score for both seasons 1 & 2 of the HBO drama series \"The Gilded Age\". He also co-wrote the original score for the Netflix documentary \"Return to Space\" with his friend Mychael Danna, directed by Oscar-winning directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin for which he received an Emmy nomination.\n\nUpcoming 2023 releases include \"Meg 2: The Trench\" starring Jason and directed by Ben Wheatley and Aardman's animated feature \"Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget\" directed by Sam Fell and the action thriller \"Retribution\" directed by Nimród Antal and starring Liam Neeson.

Throughout his illustrious and successful career, Gregson-Williams has also collaborated with a diverse array of recording artists such as Regina Spektor, Imogen Heap, Tricky, Peter Murphy, Flea, Hybrid, Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, Trevor Horn, Trevor Rabin, Lebo M., Perry Farrell and Tony Visconti.\n\nBorn in England to a musical family, Gregson-Williams earned a music scholarship to St. John's College, Cambridge, at the age of 7 and later gained a coveted spot at London's Guildhall School of Music & Drama, from which he recently received an honorary fellowship. He started his film career as assistant to composer Richard Harvey and later as orchestrator and arranger for Stanley Myers, and then went on to compose his first scores for director Nicolas Roeg. His subsequent collaboration and friendship with composer Hans Zimmer led to Gregson-Williams providing music for such films as \"The Rock,\" \"Armageddon\" and \"The Prince of Egypt\" and helped launch his career in Hollywood.\n\nIn 2018, Gregson-Williams received the BMI Icon Award, in recognition of his unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers, as well as the Society of Composers & Lyricists' prestigious Ambassador Award.\n\nWith a vision and vocal style that is as unique as it is precise and all-embracing, Lisa Gerrard has established herself as one of the world's most highly acclaimed film composers, winning a Golden Globe for her work on the score for 'Gladiator' with Hans Zimmer.\n\nLisa also received an Oscar nomination for 'Gladiator' along with two further Golden Globe Award nominations for her scores to 'Ali' and 'The Insider'. Lisa's film work also includes 'Whale Rider', a feature which received an Academy Award nomination and garnered Lisa an international award for the score.\n\nHer musical journey began in the early 1980s when she and fellow Australian Brendan Perry formed duo 'Dead Can Dance'. In 2012 the band reunited for a sell-out world tour. With nine albums released between 1984 and 1995, the duo's musical canvas expanded with each release to take in a timeless mix of world-music influences, medieval chants, folk ballads, baroque stylings, Celtic flavours, electronics, samples and anything else that took their fancy. Several solo and collaborative albums were well received and Lisa made a natural progression to composing for films.\n\nIn 2009 Lisa scored the highly acclaimed feature 'Balibo' for which she won the 2009 Screen Music Award for Best Feature Film Score, an Aria Award and 3 further nominations. In 2010 Lisa finished her score for 'Oranges and Sunshine' and the controversial film 'Tears of Gaza'.

This was premiered both in Wroclaw, Poland and at the Barbican in London. Lisa's vocal performances continue to be heard across the world, with a number planned for 2018, including a performance of 'Gladiator Live' at The Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nIn 2016 Lisa collaborated with James Orr on the score for Paul Currie's thriller '2:22'.

The first single from the album 'Pora Sotunda' was released in November 2017 and Lisa plans to perform with the choir throughout Europe during 2018.\n\nEmmy Award-winning composer Geoff Zanelli is a standout in the film and television scoring industry, garnering accolades and recognition for his diverse musical voice. Zanelli has composed for directors such as Gore Verbinski and Ridley Scott; writer/directors David Koepp, Peter Hedges and David Duchovny; producers Jerry Bruckheimer, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg; as well as actor/producer Tom Hanks.\n\nZanelli will score the fifth installment of Disney's \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" coming to theaters in May 2017. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" fans have previously heard Zanelli's original music contributions in all four of the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films via his collaborative work with Zimmer.\n\nThis marks a return of Zanelli's strong scores for Disney, which began with his breakout score for the fantasy drama \"The Odd Life of Timothy Green\" starring Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton. Zanelli's organic and stirring score for the film also received critical acclaim, including a feature in Variety's Eye on the Oscars issue.\n\nZanelli recently collaborated with Grammy-award winning Mark Ronson on the co-written score and songs to Lionsgate's \"Mortdecai,\" marking his third time working with writer/director David Koepp; director Jared Hess for the comedy \"Masterminds;\" and Steve Martin and Edie Brickell to lend string arrangements to the Grammy-award winning album \"Love Has Come For You,\" and follow-up album \"So Familiar,\" which dominated the Bluegrass charts. He is currently writing the score and songs for \"Star Citizen: Squadron 42,\" the most crowd-funded game in history.\n\nIn 2006, Zanelli earned his first Emmy after scoring the original music for Steven Spielberg's miniseries \"Into The West.\" With this win, Zanelli became the youngest composer ever to be awarded the 'Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Original Dramatic Score)' accolade. A few years later, Spielberg once again tapped Zanelli to score HBO's \"The Pacific,\" which earned him his second Emmy nomination. Other credits include: DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures' \"Disturbia,\" 20th Century Fox's \"Hitman,\" Lionsgate's \"Gamer,\" DreamWork's \"Ghost Town,\" The Weinstein Company's \"Outlander\" and Columbia Pictures' \"Secret Window\" (co-written with Philip Glass) among many others. Additionally, Zanelli co-wrote the song \"Don't Make Me Wait\" for \"Disturbia.\"\n\nZanelli has contributed music to many feature films including: Disney's \"The Lone Ranger;\" the Golden Globe-nominated scores for Warner Bros.' \"The Last Samurai\" and Touchstone Pictures' \"Pearl Harbor;\" Paramount Pictures' \"Rango,\" MGM's \"Hannibal,\" Columbia Pictures' \"Angels & Demons,\" DreamWorks' \"Antz,\" \"Chicken Run,\" \"Shark Tale,\" and \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,\" working alongside composers Hans Zimmer, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams and Steve Jablonsky.\n\nZanelli has degrees in Film Scoring and Music Production & Engineering from the prestigious Berklee College of Music, which he attended on scholarship. He is an active alumnus at his alma mater and has participated in Berklee's Curriculum Review Initiative as well as given seminars to students studying composition. During his time at Berklee, Zanelli received the Doug Timm Award in recognition of his film scoring work and the Music Production/Engineering Scholar Award.\n\nA Southern California native, Zanelli began his musical career as a guitar player and songwriter. In 1994, he met Zimmer and was offered a job at Remote Control Productions. Now, Zanelli is known as a versatile composer in his own right, who combines music from different genres and cultures.\n\nTom Holkenborg, aka Junkie XL, is a Grammy-nominated multi-platinum producer, musician, composer and educator whose versatility puts him on the cutting edge of contemporary music, and whose thirst for innovation is helping to reimagine the world of composition.\n\nA full-contact composer, Holkenborg is hands-on at every stage of the composing process, a multi-instrumentalist who combines a mastery of studio engineering, classical musical training and an innate sense of curiosity. He's as adept working with a 50 piece philharmonic orchestra as he is with a wall of modular synths, playing a bass guitar or building his own physical and digital instruments. His drive to reimagine what's possible and share that knowledge with the next generation of composers is what makes Holkenborg a unique force, and one of the most in-demand film composers in the world.\n\nTom's film scoring credits have grossed over $2 billion at the box office and include Mad Max: Fury Road, Deadpool, Black Mass, Alita: Battle Angel, Divergent, Brimstone, Justice League: The Snyder Cut, Godzilla vs. Kong, The Dark Tower, Tomb Raider, Terminator: Dark Fate, the record setting Sonic the Hedgehog and forthcoming projects including The 355, Army of The Dead, 3000 Years of Longing and more. He has worked with directors and producers including Peter Jackson, Robert Rodriguez, James Cameron, George Miller, Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder and Tim Miller among many others.\n\nAn educator as well as a creator, Tom is committed to breaking down the barriers of entry in the world of film composition, creating the free SCORE Academy program in Los Angeles, a music composition program at the ArtEZ conservatorium in his home country of the Netherlands, and on YouTube, where he hosts his educational series StudioTime, which has been watched millions of times.\n\nTom is able to draw on his extensive knowledge of classical forms and structures while keeping one finger planted firmly on the pulse of popular music. When his eclectic background is paired with his skill as a multi-instrumentalist (he plays keyboards, guitar, drums, violin, and bass) and a mastery of studio technology, a portrait emerges of an artist for whom anything is possible. Outside of his own artistry Tom's desire to marry technology and classical composition to initiate change and evolution led him to partner with Orchestral Tools in 2019 to create Junkie XL Brass, his first sample library, making world-class sounds available to composers everywhere."
