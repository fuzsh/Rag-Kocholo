        "text": "HOW MUCH...\n\nThe other big consideration, of course, was cost. How much would this ideal green building cost us to construct? We already had a Â£5m gift from the Rufford Foundation, but we also knew we may need to raise more.\n\nWe believed from the beginning that there was a strong business case for this new building, as well as the advantages it would bring in terms of energy-efficiency and its other green credentials. We knew it would add value to our work and our organisation â and ultimately help us achieve our environmental aims.\n\nSee WWF-UK's strategic plan, 2013-2018, which included an outline of plans for a new green WWF building\n\nAs a charity we have to justify every pound we spend. And WWF-UKâs donors rightly expect their money to be spent on protecting vulnerable species and environments around the world.\n\nSo we needed to be sure that:\n\na) we wouldnât be diverting funds from our vital conservation projects â which are, after all, the whole reason WWF was set up and people donate to us. We knew the costs of any new building would have to be covered from separately-sourced funds. Andâ¦\n\nb) we could demonstrate the value in both environmental and financial terms.\n\nBalancing costs against ideals is always a challenge, especially for an environmentally-focused charity like WWF.\n\nSection of Hopkins Architects' original wooden model of the proposed Living Planet Centre\n\nThe choice of the brownfield car park site in Woking was partly cost-driven. The contract we agreed with Woking Borough Council was for a 999-year lease on the site, on which theyâre charging no rent for 20 years and then a âpeppercornâ rent of just Â£1,000 per year.\n\nThe council retains the ownership of and income from the public car park underneath our building.\n\nThe timing of the construction, which coincided with an economic downturn, was also a factor in helping to keep costs to a minimum.\n\nEarly concept sketch by Hopkins Architects â August 2010\n\nAnother early decision was about the size of our new building (which we'd decided to call the Living Planet Centre). We thought carefully about balancing how much space weâd need to accommodate 300 WWF colleagues and a large number of visitors, alongside minimising environmental impact and costs.\n\nBy having our own in-house facilities, including an auditorium and education suite, we could invite people to come to us, rather than paying for travel or external venue hire.\n\nKeeping the costs as low as possible was going to be a challenge given our environmental requirements. We can always try to improve on things like our ongoing energy consumption, but we knew we had one chance to make this the greenest building possible right from the construction stage â and thatâs what we were determined to do.\n\nWe wanted this to be a showcase â an âexemplarâ green building for the UK and the world. We wanted to make a statement that sometimes it is worth spending a bit more than the bare minimum to create something thatâs not only sustainable and environmentally sound, but also inspirational.\n\nEarly sketched idea of the building plan from Hopkins Architects (we're not sure what happened to the huge panda in the middle!)\n\nWe were demanding and single-minded with our designers and builders: we wanted them to deliver the most sustainable, green building that was technically possibly within our budget. And, despite some challenges and unavoidable minor changes, thatâs what we achieved.\n\nEarly model of inside front of new building\n\nIn terms of predicting total costs, we calculated that creating our new green building from scratch could be as much as Â£20 million (including relocation costs and other expenses). Not as much as some other, less efficiently-built offices, perhaps, but obviously a lot of money.\n\nSee the breakdown of total building costs.\n\nBreakdown of Living Planet Centre costs:\n\nConstruction Â£14.3m\n\nFees Â£2.5m\n\nFixtures and fittings Â£1.3m\n\nInterest and VAT Â£2.1m\n\nTotal Â£20.2m\n\nSo we had to build on the pledged Â£5 million from the Rufford Foundation by launching a targeted âcapital appealâ with the aim of raising at least Â£10 million.\n\nIn the end, after a huge amount of work and some wonderful acts of generosity, we managed to raise over Â£16.5 million from donors, charitable trusts and specific legacies â as well as gifts in kind and discounts on various materials and services.\n\nThe balance came from our own reserves. Crucially, we didnât divert any money from WWF-UKâs core conservation work to fund the building.\n\nAt the end of 2011 we selected contractors Willmott Dixon as our main construction partner to bring the architectsâ plans to life.\n\nIt was all systems go for our new Living Planet Centre!\n\nDESIGN FEATURES...\n\nSo letâs look more closely at some design elements of the Living Planet Centre.\n\nA) Exterior design\n\nB) Interior design\n\nC) Ventilation and temperature control\n\nD) Lighting\n\nE) Sound and acoustics\n\nF) Water systems\n\nG) WWF Experience (visitor zones)\n\nA) EXTERIOR DESIGN\n\nThe Living Planet Centre was designed to sit comfortably between the Basingstoke Canal on one side and Horsell Common (a site of special scientific interest) on the other, nestling among the mature local trees.\n\nThe Living Planet Centre nestles neatly between the local trees\n\nDespite the solidity of the timber, concrete and steel structure, thereâs a gentle, quite ânaturalâ look about the Living Planet Centre â one reviewer described it as âsoft and organicâ â which owes a lot to that curvaceous roofline.\n\nBut the dramatic sweep of the zinc-surfaced roof â 80m long with a 37.5m side-to-side span â also gives a fantastic sense of life and energy to the design. It has the look of a hi-tech stretched fabric, hooked down at the sides by giant steel cable ties.\n\nOne of our four wind cowls, with some of the solar panels, on the roof\n\nAmong the most striking external features of the Living Planet Centre are the four rooftop wind cowls â those funnel-like protrusions on top that some people feel give the building a bit of a ship-like appearance.\n\nWind cowls were also a prominent design feature of the pioneering BedZED âecovillageâ designed back in 2000 by Bill Dunster (who used to work at Hopkins Architects).\n\nThe wind cowls were an integral element in the design from the start â not just because they look great, but because theyâre a key part of the buildingâs efficient âpassiveâ ventilation system.\n\n> Find out more about how our wind cowls and ventilation system work in the Technology section.\n\nUp beside them on the roof thereâs also our substantial array of solar PV panels â covering more than 500 square metres of the roof area.\n\nAs you probably know, you donât just put solar panels up anywhere and hope for the best. There are careful calculations to be done first â not just about the angle of the roof and the changing direction of the sun, but also about possible shadows cast by neighbouring trees â and in our case even by the wind cowls on our roof.\n\n> Find out more about our solar panels in the Technology section.\n\nFront of the Living Planet Centre, showing the louvred 'brise soleil' shading system\n\nThereâs a lot of glass in the Living Planet Centre too, because we wanted as much natural light inside as possible. But that can also cause problems with glare and overheating indoors on very sunny days.\n\nOne of the solutions was to introduce subtle shading around the faÃ§ade that also doubles as a stylish design feature. The distinctive louvered slats across the front and rear of the building â which create a striking, slightly wood-cabin look â are technically known as a âbrise soleilâ (sun-break).\n\n> Find out more about the wood used in the Living Planet Centre in the Materials section.\n\nComputer modelling was used to work out the best ways to shade various parts of the Living Planet Centre, taking account of the position of the sun at different times of the year, and including the size and spacing of those wooden slats.\n\nThe way the roof extends and overhangs the walls also creates shading from the sun in certain places during the day, as do the guttering and the internal system of adjustable blinds.\n\n> Find out more about the lighting used in the Living Planet Centre.\n\nPODIUM AND PIAZZA\n\nThe whole site covers about 8,300 square metres â more than twice the area of the building itself â so there was a fair amount of landscaping to be done outside the Living Planet Centre.\n\nLandscape architects Grant Associates produced a comprehensive landscape management and nature conservation plan for us, with the overall aim of helping bring the âspirit of woodlandâ into the site. Theyâve cleverly combined beauty with practicality.\n\nOne of the practical elements is an âattenuation swaleâ next to the building. A swale is just a wide-bottomed shallow ditch â which in this case is used as a filtration pond to clean and temporarily store excess rainwater running off the building, and then release it gradually into the nearby Basingstoke canal. It helps to reduce (attenuate) flood impacts on local drains and sewers.\n\nItâs all part of our sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) â which has helped us create a small wetland and wild garden area next to the Living Planet Centre. In turn this attracts a variety of aquatic invertebrates (dragonflies, beetles etc), not to mention school parties and other welcome human visitors.\n\nThe small 'wetland' area near the back of the building\n\n> Find out more about our sustainable water systems.\n\nGrant Associates have also cultivated the podium area around the building with an eclectic mix of plant species, to help realise the designersâ vision of a âmagic carpetâ of native shrubs, herbaceous plants and grasses, plus non-native ornamental species to extend the growing season and add visual variety.\n\nWeâre very pleased we managed to keep most of the existing mature trees around the site â mainly limes and oaks. And the new trees weâve planted include other native varieties like birch and rowan, with shrubs of holly, elder, hawthorn, hazel and privet. And weâve planted a line of yew trees that will eventually mask the ground-floor car park from the nearby road.\n\nOther woodland ground flora weâve added include snowdrops, bluebells, wild garlic, primroses, and climbing plants like ivy and honeysuckle.\n\nAnd yes, the bamboo plants around the back of the building are a deliberate nod to our beloved panda logo â bamboo is the pandaâs favourite, after all.\n\nBefore we started work on the site we commissioned a very detailed ecological analysis and report on the location.\n\nThe area nearby where Horsell Common meets the Basingstoke Canal is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with as many as 21 species of dragonfly, for example.\n\nThe Basingstoke canal runs along one side of the Living Planet Centre Â©woking.gov.uk\n\nThe Basingstoke canal itself was only reopened in 1991, after some long and determined restoration work. You can now find lots of wildlife in and around it â including herons, kingfishers, ducks and fish.\n\nWe thought the canal might be home to water voles too â a rare and protected species in the UK â but the ecology report concluded this wasnât the case.\n\nWe did however find some bats using the canal area as a feeding corridor, so we've put up three bat boxes to encourage them to nest, along with five bird boxes (including swift boxes) and two bug boxes.\n\n(Birds spotted within the first few months of moving here included peregrine falcons, pied wagtails and even a red kite.)\n\nWe've installed several bat boxes and bird boxes on trees around the site\n\nWoking Borough Council took the opportunity to replace the pedestrian/cycle bridge across the canal. The new one is made from accoya, a long-lasting âhardenedâ softwood product made from sustainably sourced timber.\n\nThe bridge helps link the town centre to our new public piazza, and guides people towards the exhibition space â our WWF Experience â at the front of the building.\n\n> Find out more about the WWF Experience.\n\nThe information beacon outside the front of the building\n\nJust outside the front doors on the piazza weâve installed what we call our âbeaconâ, a large message board that displays updates on our work.\n\nWeâve put in a couple of lifts too, one outside and one inside the building. (The building is completely accessible for people with disabilities â another big improvement from older premises like Panda House.) The lifts are particularly energy-efficient, as you might expect â they even generate electricity as they operate.\n\n> Find out more about our energy use in the Living Planet Centre.\n\nAt the back of the Living Planet Centre thereâs an outdoor space which, thanks to our wireless internet connection, offers an alternative place for WWF folks to work, or to go and relax during breaks. There are also areas where we can grow our own plants, flowers and even fruit and veg. These can be irrigated using rainwater harvested from the roof.\n\nOur two bike sheds (one for the public) and our bin store have âgreen roofsâ. Theyâre covered with a living mat of sedum and saxifrage, low-growing perennial plants that are drought-tolerant and low-maintenance. They also act like a sponge to help soak up excess rainwater, as well as encouraging local biodiversity.\n\nAll of this landscaping and planting isnât just nice to look at. The plants and flowers play a valuable role in attracting all kinds of insects, as well as birds and bats, and generally enhancing wildlife diversity and the natural environment. Itâs also part of achieving our high BREEAM eco-rating.\n\nB) INterior DESIGN...\n\nOriginal computer graphic image showing the view from the reception area\n\nThe first things most people notice when they go inside the Living Planet Centre (especially if they knew the slightly gloomy restrictiveness of the old Panda House office) are the space, the light and the natural wood.\n\nOur public reception area (after sundown, with roof blinds closed and lights on)\n\nThe wood emphasis is even more noticeable inside than outside the building. A reviewer from the Architects Journal said walking into the âlight-filled arched interiorâ of the Living Planet Centre was like âstepping into a gigantic treehouseâ.\n\nThe actual floor area of the building â which is 3,675 square metres, spread over the two storeys â is only about 25% bigger than our previous offices in Godalming. The new public areas account for most of that increase.\n\nBut the high ceiling, open-atrium layout, large windows and general airy brightness make it feel so much more spacious than the old Panda House.\n\nThe upper âmezzanineâ floor is divided across two concrete platforms separated by the central atrium, each side supported on a few slender concrete pillars. The designers referred to the central walkway downstairs as âthe streetâ.\n\nTHE CEILING\n\nYou canât help gazing up at the stunning barrel-vaulted roof â known as a âgridshellâ design because itâs made from a grid of timber beams. In our case itâs dissected by rows of skylights that run the length of the building, letting natural light flood in.\n\nThis criss-crossing 'diagrid' design (short for diagonal grid) is a concept based on the inherent strength of triangular structures. (Architect magazine confirms that this technique is influenced by the geodesic domes developed by Richard Buckminster Fuller from the 1940s onwards, and has recently become a âhallmark of 21st-century modernismâ.)\n\nThe diagrid 'gridshell' roof from above, during construction\n\n> Find out more about the diagrid roof in the Materials section.\n\nThe four round, dial-like grills in the ceiling are part of the Living Planet Centreâs natural ventilation system â on hotter days they help unwanted warm or stale air escape from the building when necessary, drawn out through the roof by opening the external wind cowls.\n\nOne of the four ventilation outlets in the ceiling, which allows warm, stale air to escape\n\n> Find out more about our ventilation and heating system.\n\nThose magnificent big wooden beams are actually âglulamâ â theyâre made from smaller pieces of timber (FSC spruce in this case, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council) laminated/glued together to create larger beams.\n\nClose-up image of the glulam roof beams, during construction\n\nThe combination of the barrel-vault design and the interconnecting glulam beams creates an incredibly strong but lightweight roof structure.\n\nConstructing the diagrid glulam roof\n\nWe did originally consider using curved glulam beams, but the design team calculated that the arching effect could just as easily be achieved by joining together straight beams, and at a lower cost. So thatâs what we did.\n\n> Find out more about the wood used in the Living Planet Centre.\n\nAnother early concern we had with the diagrid idea was that it requires a larger number of joints, or ânodal connectionsâ, using steel joining plates. And that adds a considerable amount to the overall cost of the roof. So we swapped from a smaller to a larger-scale grid, with longer beams and fewer joining nodes â just one more example of how we saved materials and money.\n\nArchitectural drawings for roof joint 'nodes'\n\nThereâs also a lot more going on between and behind that timber grid than you might think.\n\nIt was always intended that the Living Planet Centre roof would be a structurally-efficient and column-free arch, but this presented some challenges for the design team.\n\nIn a building with a relatively thin shell (known as âlow-inertiaâ in the trade), the structure doesnât have the same thermal or acoustic properties as solid concrete, stone or brick might have. Which means itâs not as good at holding in heat (or sound) â and that has implications for the buildingâs energy efficiency, and acoustics.\n\nWe needed to add some thin but effective âthermal massâ to absorb and retain heat when required, and help stop the indoor temperature dropping too much on cold days or at night.\n\nThe extra thermal mass added by Energain tiles in the ceiling absorbs heat and slowly releases it as the building cools\n\nThe solution we opted for was using Energain tiles, which sit neatly behind the birch ply panels inside the diamond shapes in the roof grid, and absorb and release heat in very clever ways.\n\n> Find out more about Energain and thermal mass in the Materials section.\n\nCombined with just the right amount of acoustic damping, thatâs how we made the roof design work to help solve our thermal and sound issues.\n\n> Find out more about the building's acoustic damping in the Interior Design section.\n\nExample of exposed 'fair-faced' concrete soffits\n\nWe deliberately left some concrete exposed inside the building too â for instance the âsoffitsâ (underside) of the mezzanine balcony â which saved on paint and other decorating materials.\n\nWe happen to like the look of this crisp, smooth-finished concrete (âfair-facedâ concrete, as itâs called), and itâs also very useful as additional thermal mass, helping regulate the room temperature.\n\n> Find out more about the concrete used in the Living Planet Centre.\n\nGround floor, with trees\n\nThe other things you canât help but notice in the middle of the building are the trees! Three extra-large âweeping figsâ â which are suitably slow-growing, indoor-thriving trees from European sources â stretch all the way from their large ground-floor containers up to well above the height of the mezzanine.\n\n(Sir David Attenborough helped with the planting of these trees at our opening ceremony.)\n\nSir David Attenborough, helping plant our indoor fig trees at the opening of the Living Planet Centre\n\nAs well as being great for removing air pollutants and improving our everyday working experience, this very visible foliage also strongly reinforces the idea that this truly is a Living Planet Centre.\n\nPUBLIC SPACES\n\nThere are three main public and semi-public areas inside the Living Planet Centre.\n\nThe WWF Experience at the Living Planet Centre\n\n1) The WWF Experience, our visitor area, designed by Jason Bruges Studio.\n\n> Find out more in the WWF Experience section and in the âLife at the Living Planet Centreâ section.\n\nPupils from a local primary school in our Learning Zone\n\n2) Our specially-designed Learning Zone is aimed mainly at schools and is essentially kitted out like a classroom (with the emphasis on fun as well as learning), including smart boards, tables, sinks and activity areas.\n\n> Find out more about our education work in the Life at the Living Planet Centre section.\n\nThe multi-purpose Cisco Auditorium at the Living Planet Centre\n\n3) Our well-equipped, state-of-the-art 152-seat auditorium has been designed so that it's adaptable for all kinds of public and private uses.\n\n> Find out more in the Life at the Living Planet Centre section.\n\nWORKING SPACE\n\nThe rest of the building is given over to an open-plan workspace for more than 300 people â planning for which began way before the Living Planet Centre was constructed.\n\nSection view showing both working levels, ground and mezzanine\n\nWe started working with AMA Alexi Marmot Associates back in our old Panda House office, to examine the way we worked and how it could be improved in our new building.\n\nAMAâs surveys revealed, for one thing, that only between 40-60% of the desk space in Panda House was being used at any one time.\n\nSo they came up with three possible working scenarios for the new office, based on varying degrees of âhot-deskingâ.\n\nHot-desking is the idea that people donât automatically have dedicated areas or desks, or even a desk at all, and all possible workspaces should be used more effectively.\n\nComputer graphic of open-plan office area on mezzanine level\n\nOne scenario was that the directors would still have their own offices, but everyone else would hot-desk. But in the end we opted for the more egalitarian âdeep-greenâ plan: absolutely everyone would hot desk (even our chief executive).\n\nWe did allocate teams to certain 'zones' so they could work nearer together and have a home for their relevant storage.\n\nTo avoid a situation where lots of desks werenât being used, we agreed there should be fewer workstations than employees. This also allows (and encourages) flexible and collaborative working, in and away from the office space.\n\nNo more corded telephones, bulky desktop computers or cluttered desks\n\nOur new IT system and communications tools have made this possible. Laptop computers and headset phones have replaced desktop PCs and plug-in landlines.\n\nThereâs also minimal cabling to be seen around the workspace, largely thanks to the wireless network, which allows WWF colleagues and guests to log in using any mobile device.\n\n> Find out more about our IT and communications system.\n\nThereâs a clear-desk policy for everyone working in the building, to minimise clutter and maximise efficiency.\n\nThe idea is that you only bring in what you need for that dayâs work and take everything away when you leave. Everyoneâs given a âsmart boxâ to transport their essential items and there are lockers for overnight storage.\n\nEven the storage lockers look good at the Living Planet Centre\n\nAlthough itâs very different from the way we worked at our old offices, weâve found that the building lends itself to clear desk working and it happens naturally â with just an occasional need for reminders.\n\nSome of our 'quiet booths' for private working\n\nThere are spaces for private working too (âquiet boothsâ or âconcentration zonesâ) and a few small rooms that can be booked.\n\nMeeting rooms are booked and accessed electronically (and all named after places where WWF works â Amazon, Arctic, Borneo etc)\n\nThere are 17 meeting rooms of various sizes, as well as the boardroom, and we use our online room-booking system to help us get the most out of these spaces. If the booked host doesn't log into a room then it's made available for others to use.\n\nIn the boardroom at the Living Planet Centre\n\nThere are various âbreakoutâ areas for impromptu meetings, and comfy sofas for smaller groups or one-to-one discussions.\n\nFor more social interactions thereâs what we call the âmeet-and-eatâ area at the far end downstairs â a particularly bright, airy space, with a small kitchen, hot-drink facilities and places to chat informally.\n\nOur 'meet and eat' tables, next to our small kitchen and hot drinks area\n\nPeople are encouraged to eat their lunch together here, rather than alone at their desks, as often used to be the case. We think itâs healthier, as well as more sociable and better for team-building.\n\nOur tea and coffee area at the back of the building, with doors leading out to the terrace\n\nAnd when the weatherâs good we can step outside onto the paved terrace area at the back â and feel even closer to nature.\n\nThe rear of the Living Planet Centre, with desks for outdoor working, meeting or having lunch\n\nOne advantage of the office being up on stilts above the car park is that the views are that much better! In places, the tree canopy outside is at eye-level. Our thoughtful architects also carefully located the windows to give us the best views out over the local woods and canal.\n\nVENTILATION AND HEATING\n\nDiagram indicating elements of the building's natural heating and ventilation systems\n\nWe have âmixed-modeâ ventilation in the Living Planet Centre. That basically means we can open the windows when necessary but we can also control the airflow and temperature electronically - although without using conventional, energy-heavy air conditioning.\n\nWindows can be opened to let in cool, fresh air when wanted\n\nNatural ventilation is a cost-efficient way to improve indoor air quality and to reduce our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (to help address global warming and climate change). So itâs a crucial aspect of the Living Planet Centre design.\n\nA mini âtraffic lightâ system of green and red LED lights next to the windows shows us whether they should be opened for natural ventilation or kept closed to let the âbuilding management systemâ regulate the heating and cooling.\n\nThe Living Planet Centre is also fitted with internal CO2 sensors for health reasons â if CO2 concentrations increase inside the building, fresh air flow is increased.\n\nInstead of the usual kind of air-conditioning we use a combination of earth ducts, wind cowls and ground source heat pumps to regulate the temperature all around the building â including to cool the electrical and IT equipment in the Data Centre.\n\nEARTH DUCTS\n\nAlso called âearth tubesâ, we have six of these large-diameter pipes (theyâre almost big enough to walk through), with a combined length of 400m, buried about a metre under the building.\n\nPart of the concrete earth duct tubing being lowered into position onsite\n\nAir is drawn into these pipes at the surface and circulated underground. Because the ambient temperature below ground is a fairly constant 12Â°C, it means colder air entering these underground ducts will be warmed up to 12Â°C, whereas warmer air will be cooled to that level.\n\nAbove-ground top section of earth ducts, which draw in air to be cooled or heated underground\n\nThis air is then fed into our air-handling units for further heating or cooling as needed (assisted by our ground source heat pumps, more about which later) and then distributed around the building.\n\nFloor vents are used to enhance air flow around the building\n\nThe four, 4m-high funnel-like cowls on the roof are another low-energy way to improve airflow in the building. Basically theyâre wind-driven ventilators that can be opened and closed when needed.\n\nOne of our four wind cowls on the roof\n\nEach cowl rotates on specially designed bearings, aligning itself so its back faces into the wind. As the wind blows over the cowl, low pressure created inside it produces a vacuum, sucking out the warm, stale air from inside the building.\n\nAir also circulates through a specially designed gap (a âplenumâ) in the flooring system. The floor panels themselves are carefully sealed to be airtight, to avoid unwanted air leaks or draughts.\n\nSitting above an open-sided car park can raise design concerns over cold air leaking into the Living Planet Centre. The builders, and flooring installers in particular, had to be vigilant about âcold-bridgingâ (or âthermal bridgingâ) â avoiding potential weakspots in a buildingâs insulation, often at a junction between floors, walls, roofs or windows, where heat can escape or draughts come in.\n\nLIGHTING\n\nNatural daylight was always central to the design and layout of the Living Planet Centre â not only to cut down on electricity use but for health and wellbeing reasons too.\n\nNatural light is at the heart of our building's design\n\nOur careful design and planning stages took into consideration factors like seasonal variations â in both heating and lighting â as the sunâs position changes in relation to the building.\n\nThe large amount of glass (we have more than 100 glazed units), especially in the roof, means the inside of the building gets twice as much natural light as the average office.\n\nIn case the sunlight gets too glaring, we have a combination of fixed and automated shading panels of all shapes and sizes.\n\nAn intelligent control system (designed by Levolux) takes into account the position of the sun and daylight levels at any given time and automatically adjusts the position of the fabric roller blinds to partially or completely shade windows and rooflights.\n\nOur daylighting target for peopleâs desks was 300 lux (1 âluxâ is equivalent to the light of one candle per square metre). Low-energy desk lamps can increase that to 500 lux.\n\nThe natural daylight can be augmented by low-energy strip or spot-lighting when required\n\nOn less bright days we can turn on general overhead office lighting â a mix of energy-efficient fluorescent and LED lamps.\n\nOur total electrical lighting load is only 5.5 watts per square metre, considerably below the average for office space â but clever design makes it seem much brighter.\n\nWorking positions have low-energy anglepoise desk lamps\n\nLight sensors inside and outside the building detect when natural light levels fall and rise, and adjust the electric lighting appropriately.\n\nOccupancy (movement) sensors in meeting rooms and toilets, and a âlast-outâ function, help to make sure no unnecessary lights are left on.\n\nMovement sensors mean that the lights can sometimes go out in certain areas if everyone stays still for too long, but the system has a manual override. Besides, itâs a useful reminder that itâs not healthy to be sitting still in one place for too long!\n\nSOUND / ACOUSTICS\n\nThe Living Planet Centre design and planning process included careful consideration of the acoustics and sonic effects of the building.\n\nThere's acoustic damping fabric behind the slats in the ceiling panels\n\nItâs not just an issue of how noise (from outside and inside the building) would impact on the people working there, but also the environmental effects of noise on neighbours and local wildlife. We considered this right from the construction stage.\n\nInternally, a curved ceiling like the Living Planet Centreâs can cause acoustic problems in a building â with sound reflections becoming focused in certain areas, causing âloud spotsâ and echoes.\n\nAcoustic specialists Cole Jarman helped come up with a clever solution that would make 30% of the ceiling (as well as more than half the wall areas) acoustically absorptive, by hiding special panels of mineral fibre behind the roof and wall panels.\n\nSound-absorbing fabric panels, exposed during ceiling construction\n\nWeâve also installed a sound-masking system which generates subtle âwhite noiseâ at sound frequencies that mask background chatter and office noise â adding soothing hints of birdsong to enhance the feeling of calm.\n\nThe flooring had to be specially designed to counteract vibrations from footsteps and avoid transmitting any unwanted sounds around the building.\n\nAfter testing with a 3D model, extra fabric-covered acoustic panels were added to the side walls of the auditorium to improve sound quality\n\nAfter we moved in and tried out the various spaces, we added some more acoustic panels in the smaller meeting rooms, to make them better for teleconferencing, as well as reducing noise reverberations in the Learning Zone and boardroom.\n\nWATER SYSTEMS\n\nTo reduce the amount of fresh water we use from the mains supply for things like watering our plants and flushing our toilets, we harvest rainwater.\n\nRain falling on the roof, paved walkways, ramps and terrace is caught in gutters and gullies and diverted via attenuation tanks within the entrance level structure to a huge 35,000-litre holding tank underground.\n\nWe also recycle âgreywaterâ from hand basins and showers inside the building, and pass it through a filter and UV treatment unit for disinfection, before itâs reused in the toilets.\n\nWater recycling systems around the building\n\nIf thereâs not enough rain, mains water will be used. If thereâs too much rain, the excess goes into the wetland area as part of our sustainable urban drainage system. Once thatâs full, the water there will overflow into the nearby Basingstoke Canal.\n\nThe below-ground drainage system has been coordinated with the tree protection plan, and porous paving has been specified for surfacing the access paths and cycle racks area, to minimise the impact on tree roots.\n\nSink taps in the building are fitted with âpassive infraredâ motion sensors to save water. Showers have timer switches and the WC cisterns are dual-flush to reduce water use. We also use energy-efficient zip taps for instant hot water for drinks.\n\nOn-site construction of the Living Planet Centre began at Woking's Brewery Road council car park location in March 2012, and took just under 18 months to complete.\n\nView across Basingstoke canal as work begins on-site\n\nThe early construction site, showing driven concrete pile foundations\n\nSupporting columns at ground level, early in construction process\n\nWe selected Willmott Dixon to be our main building contractor, from a list of 14 companies. They are widely known as one of the first construction companies to put sustainability at the heart of their building work.\n\nOn-site with the builders, Willmott Dixon\n\nThey werenât simply going to be âthe builderâ on this job â it was much more than that.\n\nWe engaged them on a âdesign and buildâ contract, which means they were in overall charge of making sure this was going to be the greenest, lowest-carbon, most sustainable building they could possibly construct â meeting BREEAM âOutstandingâ standards â without going over our budget.\n\nThey were helped in this ambitious endeavour by the skilled planning of Atelier Ten, and together they made an impressively successful team.\n\nThey were also assisted by Sturgis Carbon Profiling, who came to be affectionately nicknamed âthe carbon policeâ.\n\nCARBON MEASURING\n\nOne of the first tasks was to analyse the âembodied carbonâ emissions (or carbon dioxide equivalent) for every material and component used in the building.\n\nThe carbon profiling calculations were largely based on whatâs known as the CEN/TC 350 standards for sustainable construction.\n\nThese standards cover four separate stages in the life of a building:\n\n1. PRODUCT MANUFACTURE â including extracting raw materials and processing them into usable components.\n\n2. CONSTRUCTION â including transport of the components to the site and assembly on-site.\n\nTop of the earth ducts being installed on-site\n\n3. IN-USE â this complex stage covers ongoing maintenance, repair and replacement of products, as well as their long-term energy and water use.\n\n4. END-OF-LIFE â when the building is eventually dismantled and the component parts are taken away and recycled or disposed of.\n\nIn other words it doesnât just involve calculating how much carbon each component would emit in its working lifetime â a lightbulbâs use of electricity, for instance. It also includes the carbon emitted when that component was originally produced, then transported, and whenever itâs replaced, and ultimately how itâs disposed of.\n\nThe total figure, for all the component parts, would be the âwhole-lifeâ emissions of the Living Planet Centre (based on the buildingâs life being 60 years, though itâs built to last longer than that).\n\n'Whole-life' carbon emission assessments for the Living Planet Centre\n\nThe Living Planet Centre is, in fact, the first building in the UK to have undergone this kind of full, whole-life carbon assessment.\n\nThe Living Planet Centre is also unique in that itâs been âdesigned for deconstructionâ. It means at the end of its life the Living Planet Centre can be dismantled (not just demolished) and the component parts reused or recycled.\n\nEven before construction began, Sturgisâs research and recommendations had managed to reduce the predicted whole-life carbon impact of the Living Planet Centre by 30% compared with the original design.\n\nBut now it was up to Willmott Dixon to push that down even further during the build, if we were to achieve that hard-to-get BREEAM Outstanding rating.\n\nAs Willmott Dixonâs sustainability manager Richard Bartlett said to Building magazine, stringent standards had to be met: âWith any job there are aspirations that fall by the wayside. But here, these were contractual obligations.â\n\nGREEN BUILDING SITE\n\nWe even monitored the building site itself, making sure it was as low-carbon, low-waste and sustainable as possible.\n\nFor instance...\n\nâ¢ 99% of construction waste didnât end up in landfill. We made sure âtake-backâ schemes were used, so that excess or unused materials could be returned to suppliers/manufacturers, and we did a lot of recycling.\n\nSome spare building materials went to the local Lighthouse project in Woking, helping turn a derelict building into a community centre. The remaining 1% of the site waste was classified as âhazardousâ and was subject to the CL:AIRE process for contaminated land.\n\nâ¢ Waste was minimised on site using agreed incentives with subcontractors. For instance, there were skip targets and economic rewards if fewer skips were filled. In the end we filled 72 skips, generating 70% less waste than weâd planned for.\n\nâ¢ We encouraged off-site construction of various components â including the roof â to maximise efficiency and minimise waste.\n\nâ¢ Willmott Dixon secured an early connection to the electricity grid, which helped minimise the use of diesel generators on site.\n\nâ¢ The temporary on-site buildings were well-insulated âeco-cabinsâ, fitted with low-energy lights, and the drying rooms had dehumidifiers, drastically reducing energy load during a very wet year. They even harvested rainwater from their roofs on the site.\n\nâ¢ Site and security lights were low-energy LEDs, and non-essential lights were on timer switches. Non-essential areas of the site were automatically switched off out of hours.\n\nAll on-site energy and water consumption were closely monitored. During the construction process we managed to reduce water to around half our initial target.\n\nONGOING IMPROVEMENTS\n\nThe team were constantly on the lookout for ways to lower the Living Planet Centreâs carbon profile â without increasing costs or reducing quality.\n\nOne example was the glue to be used in the wooden glulam beams. Originally this was going to be a synthetic adhesive with a high carbon footprint, which would have meant the wood beams wouldnât have been any lower-carbon than a steel structure. Sturgis suggested swapping to a natural polymer glue and the carbon count dropped significantly.\n\nThe original design spec also said the aluminium in the window frames should have 30% recycled content. But Willmott Dixon found an alternative supplier that could provide frames with 80% recycled aluminium.\n\nThe carbon analysis didnât always reveal predictable or intuitive results. Sometimes it turned out the carbon embodied in the manufacturing of an otherwise âecoâ product (an insulating material, say) could cancel out or even outweigh the long-term benefits of using that product.\n\nTake the windows again. âWhole-lifeâ analysis showed that triple-glazed windows were actually less carbon-efficient than simpler double-glazed units, even though they provided better insulation. The extra embedded carbon in the product itself outweighed the long-term energy savings. Not what you might expect.\n\nEND RESULTS: LOW CARBON, HIGH SUSTAINABILITY\n\nDuring the construction process, Willmott Dixon, Atelier Ten and the team managed to deliver a remarkable 42% reduction in the whole-life embodied carbon of the building, compared to a standard high-performance building.\n\nThat means weâre saving the equivalent of more than 5,400 tonnes of carbon over the buildingâs life. Without increasing the buildingâs costs.\n\nThose kind of dramatic savings at the construction stage show that even good, sustainably-minded design can be improved by careful use of materials and building techniques.\n\nThe Living Planet Centre set new standards in carbon-efficient design and construction. In total it has a whole-life carbon footprint thatâs just 35% of the average modern office building.\n\n'Grand Designs' presenter and WWF Ambassador Kevin McCloud was impressed when he visited the construction site, confirming it was going to be an \"exemplar building for offices and commercial buildings of the future.\"\n\nIn any kind of building, the production, use and disposal of materials can have big environmental and social impacts.\n\nWorking on the design and build of the Living Planet Centre it was absolutely key for us that we didnât simply know how the materials were sourced and manufactured, but how efficiently they would operate, how long theyâd last and how easily they could be disposed of (broken down or recycled) at the end of their use in the building.\n\nWe worked closely with our architects (Hopkins), environmental design consultants (Atelier Ten), structural engineers (Expedition Engineering), main contractors (Willmott Dixon) and specialist carbon-analysers (Sturgis Carbon Profiling) to examine the âwhole lifeâ carbon footprints of all the materials to be used in the Living Planet Centre.\n\nThe team also worked with organisations like WRAP (Waste Resources Action Programme) from early in the project, to help reduce waste through good design.\n\nThere were a number of questions we constantly had to ask ourselves at every stage, such as:\n\nâ¢ How can we reduce our use of materials?\n\nâ¢ Are all the products from sustainable sources?\n\nâ¢ Can we use more recycled materials?\n\nâ¢ How can we minimise waste?\n\nâ¢ Can we avoid/reduce hazardous products?\n\nâ¢ Can we use more locally-sourced materials?\n\nThe challenges we had to overcome included technical feasibility, cost and the performance required from a modern office building.\n\nWeâre very pleased to report that 98.5% of the materials used in the Living Planet Centre were certified as responsibly sourced (and the few that werenât were mainly small ancillary components that couldnât be certified).\n\nRead on for a breakdown of some of the main materials we usedâ¦\n\nTIMBER\n\nAll timber used in the construction of the Living Planet centre is FSC-certified or from recycled sources. We have achieved full FSC project certification for the building. (See more about FSC Project certification.)\n\nThe Forest Stewardship Council certifies sustainably sourced wood and other forest products\n\nWe believe that Forest Stewardship Council certification (FSC) is the only credible system that ensures environmentally and socially responsible management of forests. FSC covers the whole âChain of Custodyâ journey of the timber, from forest to final user.\n\nThe wood we used for the building included:\n\nSpruce (European whitewood) â used in the âglulamâ roof beams and âUltralam LVLâ external soffits.\n\nâ¢ Glulam (âglued laminated timberâ) â an eco-friendly product where smaller pieces of wood are glued together to create larger, extra-strong beams â using a natural polymer glue in our case. Our spruce glulam beams (all 828 of them) were premade off-site and assembled on-site, joined together using more than 7,200 bolts.\n\nâ¢ LVL (laminated veneer lumber) â a no-waste, economical construction-strength timber, like chunkier plywood.\n\nBirch â used for the plywood panelling in the ceiling and walls, cabinets and other joinery. And of course the sculpted plywood constructions of the four WWF Experience zones. The internal timber doors (made and fitted by Vicaima) were also finished in FSC birch to match the wall panelling.\n\nAsh â for the curved-edge reception desk and indoor balustrade railings.\n\nOur front reception desk, made from sustainable ash wood\n\nLarch â external louvres/brise soleil, bike and bin stores.\n\nCONCRETE\n\nAlthough thereâs a lot of wood on show at the Living Planet Centre, we still had to use a fair amount of concrete in the structure â for the foundations, basic frame, balconies and supports, etc. About 2,500 tonnes of concrete in all.\n\nConcrete is the most widely used material in the world (if you donât count water). But itâs not one of the greenest.\n\nThe cement component of concrete is a particularly energy-intensive material â it involves heating limestone, clay and other components to more than 1,000 Â°C. Cement alone is estimated to produce about 5% of the worldâs CO2 emissions.\n\nConcrete is clearly a very useful building material, but can be problematic if youâre trying to stay low-carbon. So we had to be very particular about our concrete.\n\nAfter a considered selection process, Willmott Dixon opted to source the concrete from Cemex â they had a local depot too, which helped cut transport impacts.\n\nCemex provided the high-quality, smooth (âfair-facedâ) finish we wanted, despite our demanding a high proportion of ârecycled aggregateâ (at least 40% GGBS, or ground granulated blast-furnace slag â a byproduct from iron and steel-making).\n\nâReinforcedâ concrete, as youâll probably know, has steel rods inside it for added strength, and that would normally increase the carbon count considerably. But by sourcing 98% recycled steel (thanks to Eco-Reinforcement) we saved at least another 250 tonnes of carbon.\n\nRecycled steel bars, which are used to reinforce the concrete\n\nWe also made cost and carbon savings by opting not to use pre-cast concrete units for the mezzanine structure. Instead we went for pouring and setting the concrete âin situâ.\n\nPouring concrete on-site during construction\n\nENERGAIN (thermal mass panels)\n\nClose-up view of an Energain panel â the 'phase change material' we used to add thermal mass inside the building\n\nâThermal massâ refers to the ability of any material to store and release heat. Heavyweight materials like concrete are generally good at storing heat â hence the use of concrete bricks in storage heaters.\n\nOn a warm day, as indoor temperatures climb, heat is absorbed by the thermal mass inside a building, which helps limit air temperature increase.\n\nWindows (or in our case wind cowls on the roof) can be opened overnight to let that stored heat escape. In the winter, of course, that stored heat is very useful for warming the building.\n\nBut because we werenât using concrete in the main ceiling at the Living Planet Centre, we needed something else to provide thermal mass. We opted for an innovative product called Energain.\n\nHopkins Architects' sketch of roof section showing Energain thermal mass panels\n\nEnergain boards are around a centimetre thick, and very much lighter than concrete, but they have hidden depths. Behind the thin layer of aluminium they contain whatâs known as a âphase change materialâ â in this case basically a kind of wax â which melts as it warms up. Itâs mixed with a special polymer so it doesnât leak out of the panels.\n\nHereâs the super-smart part: whenever the wax compound melts (at around 22Â°C/71Â°F) it absorbs heat from the room and stores it. Then when the temperature drops back (to 18Â°C/64Â°F or below), the wax in the panels re-solidifies and the stored heat is released back into the room.\n\nThe main role of the aluminium lining, by the way, is to help stop the wax drastically overheating, say in the unlikely event of a fire (the flash point of the wax is 148Â°C/298Â°F).\n\nGLASS AND ALUMINIUM\n\nMost of our glass and aluminium can be found in the roof, windows and doors.\n\nThe fantastic curving roof is a 2,000 square metre Ziplok standing seam system, supplied by RigiSystems. Itâs made from aluminium panels with an anti-corrosion MicroZinc coating that replicates the look of a traditional zinc roof.\n\nAnd itâs specially ârolledâ, as they put it, without âmicroribsâ, in order to match the sleek, clean aesthetics of the building.\n\nOur wind cowls are also made with recycled aluminium.\n\nOne of our aluminium wind cowls, designed by FlÃ¤kt Wood, being assembled by specialist engineers at ASGB\n\nThe huge amount of glazing in the roof and the walls is mainly thin-framed âglass curtain wallingâ. We chose Kawneerâs AA100 units, largely because their frames contain 80% recycled aluminium (well above the target of 30%). Kawneer also provided glass doors around the building.\n\nThe glass itself is mostly from the Pilkington Suncool range, which cuts solar radiation by more than 75% â taking some more of the strain off our internal cooling systems on the sunniest, warmest days.\n\nFLOORING, FURNITURE AND FITTINGS\n\nWe were equally fussy about sourcing materials for the flooring, furniture and fittings in the Living Planet Centre.\n\nWe werenât just strict about the environmental credentials of their manufacturers and the sustainability of the materials, but also about things like VOCs (volatile organic compounds) or other damaging emissions they may release during use.\n\nThe flooring panels in the building â âraised access systemsâ supplied by Mero-Schmidlin â mainly contain FSC-certified chipboard or sustainably-sourced gypsum (calcium sulphate).\n\nPart of the Mero-Schmidlin raised flooring system being installed\n\nMero raised flooring detail\n\nThe floor coverings vary depending on what best suited each area. For the entrance/reception zone and staircases, hard-wearing composite ceramic tiles were chosen â namely Strata MarrazzoCem tiles, which contain 75% recycled natural stone chips (marble and quartz).\n\nThe stairs contain 75% recycled marble and quartz chips to help resist wear-and-tear\n\nThe Biosfera carpet tiles are made from 100% recycled yarn â and were donated as a gift from manufacturers Interface. The material itself comes from industrial waste sources, like old fishing nets and fluff from used carpeting.\n\nThe carpets were installed using the glue-less âTac Tilesâ system, avoiding the VOCs from adhesives, and can be recycled at the end of their useful life.\n\nWhere possible, furniture items were FSC-credibly certified with FSC Chain of Custody and all the furniture we bought was assessed to be from credibly certified sources (based on evidence provided and checks we carried out).\n\nWe chose Scandinavian furniture supplier Kinnarps (pronounced as âShinnarpsâ in Swedish) to provide our desks, tables, chairs, high-backed sofas, etc. We knew they had a track record of providing high-quality sustainable products and we liked their bright, modern look and comfortable designs.\n\nKinnarps also gave us generous discounts on the furniture and were very helpful with advice and options to help us achieve the look we wanted â smart but simple and functional.\n\nENERGY â WHERE WE GET OURS AND HOW WE USE IT\n\nOur central aims for the Living Planet Centre included minimising the amount of energy weâd use and replacing carbon-intensive fossil fuels with renewable energy sources wherever possible.\n\nWe planned to do this in two main ways:\n\n1) The buildingâs power supply would be all-electric, with no in-house gas or oil boiler systems. Weâd use alternative, renewable sources of energy wherever possible, including solar PV (photovoltaic) panels, ground source heat pumps, earth ducts, etc.\n\n2) Weâd use energy more efficiently â reducing the amount we need to consume, improving thermal insulation and making better use of natural light, heat and ventilation.\n\nBearing in mind the Living Planet Centre was going to be a bigger building than our previous Panda House had been, and it would include new energy-consuming features like the visitor experience, auditorium and Learning Zone, this was never going to be easy.\n\nSo hereâs how weâve done it:\n\nSolar power from the roof\n\nWeâve put more than 400 solar PV panels (410 to be exact) along the roof of the building. We were originally thinking of integrating the PV panels into the glass on the roof, but the plans changed. Instead we opted to have standard Sunpower E-series panels (each 1560mm x 800mm, or 1.24m2) installed on the solid roof areas by EvoEnergy.\n\nWe have a couple of âinvertersâ in-house to convert the DC energy from the solar panels into the AC electricity used at the power sockets.\n\nIf we have solar power to spare we can also feed some back to the local electricity grid â earning ourselves a bit of extra income to offset other costs in the process.\n\nOur solar panels supply electricity for our lighting, as well as for the pumps and fans that circulate the warm and cool air around the building, and for opening and closing the windows and blinds, etc. In total they provided about 15% of the buildingâs âbase loadâ usage in our first year.\n\nCombined with power from Woking\n\nFor the additional âplug loadâ â the power used by plugging in computers, servers and any other electrical devices â we draw the extra electricity we need from Thameswey Energyâs local âcombined heat and powerâ (CHP) plant in Woking.\n\nWoking Borough Council (which part-owns Thameswey Energy) has a climate change strategy in place to reduce its CO2 emissions, and its CHP scheme is part of that.\n\nCHP infographic Â©Sarah Gerrity www.energy.gov\n\nCHP is a very efficient way to produce both heat and electricity. Itâs true it does use natural gas (a fossil fuel, albeit one of the cleanest) â but whereas in a conventional gas turbine around 60% of the fuel burnt is wasted as unused heat, a CHP unit reduces the wastage to as little as 10%.\n\nAnd because the energy is generated locally, there are also fewer of the losses associated with electricity transmission from large power stations.\n\nHeating from underground â ground source heat pumps\n\nEven with our energy-efficiency measures, effective insulation and âpassiveâ heating system (see âearth ductsâ and âEnergainâ earlier), when the weather is extreme it can take a lot more energy to heat or cool a building the size of the Living Planet Centre.\n\nOur very clever ground source heat pump (GSHP) system takes advantage of the year-round consistent temperature under the surface of the ground â in the same way as the earth ducts do.\n\nGSHP infographic Â© www.epa.gov\n\nGSHP infographic Â© www.epa.gov\n\nBut whereas the earth ducts use that constant underground 12Â°C to heat or cool air-filled tubes directly, the GSHP system uses a series of thinner (150mm/6in), fluid-filled polyethylene pipes in 20 boreholes going 100m into the ground.\n\nAnd hereâs the clever science bit. The liquid in those pipes â mainly water with some antifreeze â works as a âheat-transfer fluidâ. When the fluid is cold, heat energy from the ground is transferred into it through the pipes (grouted with bentonite to improve heat transfer even more).\n\nThe fluid then passes through a âheat exchangerâ, which compresses it, and that raises the temperature even more. The heat generated is removed by our 'air-handling units' and is used to warm the air in the Living Planet Centre. The cooled fluid goes back underground and the whole process repeats.\n\nThe air-handling units contain âthermal wheelsâ, heat-conducting metal rotors that can extract over 80% of heat energy from exhaust air and use it to warm colder fresh air.\n\nThe pump equipment itself uses a bit of electricity, but an efficient ground source heat pump can still generate up to four times as much energy as it consumes.\n\nInside our ground source heat pump control room\n\nIn the summertime, the same 12Â°C temperature underground cools the fluid in the pipes â so the whole process works in reverse, helping to reduce the heat inside the building.\n\nBy the way, if youâre wondering if âground source heatâ is the same as âgeothermal energyâ, technically itâs not â find out the difference between ground source and geothermal heat here...\n\nEven though you might hear the terms âground source heatâ and 'geothermal' used interchangeably sometimes, âgeothermalâ energy usually means tapping into volcanically heated rocks or water very deep below the Earthâs surface (or nearer the surface in places like Iceland).\n\nBut âground source heatâ (which can also be called âshallow geothermalâ) is a result of sunlight being absorbed into the ground (usually in the top 200 metres), and is more readily available. So itâs really more a type of solar power.\n\nEnergy monitoring\n\nA computer-based building management system has been installed, supplied by Trend, to help monitor, control and optimise technical building services (heating, ventilation, lighting, etc) and the energy consumed by devices used in the Living Planet Centre. This can be done either on-site or remotely.\n\nSub-metering has been installed to make it easier to keep an eye on high-energy-use areas within the building.\n\nDisplay screens around the building summarise and simplify our electricity use data to help encourage everyone to keep saving energy around the building\n\nEnergy Performance Certificate rating\n\nEnergy Performance Certificates (EPCs) were introduced by the UK government in response to the EU Energy Performance of Buildings directive.\n\nThe certificates look similar to the energy labels on new cars or electrical appliances like fridges â it uses the same kind of scale for energy efficiency, from A (best/lowest CO2 emissions) to G (worst).\n\nEPCs are based on actual energy use, and are designed to increase transparency and encourage improvement in the energy performance of buildings.\n\nThe Living Planet Centre has received an 'A'-rated Energy Performance Certificate.\n\nICT â INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY\n\nFor us, moving into the Living Planet Centre meant a chance to work in new and better ways â but it also meant we needed to upgrade most of our technologies. Our old IT (information technology) and communications systems were already stretched at Panda House.\n\nBut of course new, state-of-the-art ICT systems arenât cheap. So we were very fortunate to be able to team up with computer networking giants Cisco and their expert implementation partners Dimension Data.\n\nOur aim from the start was to help everyone at the Living Planet Centre to work more productively and efficiently. Cisco and Dimension Data have helped make this possible.\n\nCisco generously donated refurbished hardware, including ethernet and firewall equipment, that theyâd recently finished using at the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics (where they delivered the communications network infrastructure). They also provided big discounts on servers for our datacentre.\n\nDimension Dataâs advice and support was also central in getting all our systems operating effectively from day one, as well as training our own people to get the best from the new technologies.\n\nClear desks, borderless networks, smart working\n\nWe knew we wanted an integrated wireless system, in keeping with the âclear-deskâ ethos of the Living Planet Centre. There are also big health and safety benefits in having desktop power and USB sockets, which minimises loose cabling and trailing wires.\n\nWe don't use desktop PCs or landline phones on desks any more. Weâve provided laptops, but we also welcome a bring-your-own-device culture. Apart from anything else, it helps reduce the amount of hardware WWF-UK has to own and manage.\n\nWe couldnât do this at our old office. Itâs all been made possible by Ciscoâs âunified communications systemâ â now that everyoneâs using Jabber voice software on a variety of devices, complete with personal headsets (wired or Bluetooth).\n\nJabber can also be used for instant messaging or to tell team members where you are in the building, if youâre in a meeting or on a call.\n\nOur aim was that everyone at WWF-UK should be able to work together quickly, easily and securely from wherever they are in the building, and beyond. Ciscoâs âborderless network technologyâ helps us do just that.\n\nThe improved online collaboration extends to better document management, which lets dispersed teams work together on âliveâ documents, with better version control and more security for confidential files.\n\nAnd itâs all achieved in a smart, clutter-free way, with all the technology hardware and wiring subtly hidden out of sight.\n\nAnother significant change we made when we moved here was to drastically reduce the number of printers we have. We had 16 in our old office â weâve cut that to just four at the Living Planet Centre. Not everyone finds it easy, but itâs a deliberate statement about cutting down resource use and waste â and thereâs been a notable reduction in printing levels as a result.\n\nEfficient meetings â real and virtual\n\nOur new home has much better meeting rooms (complete with interactive smartboards) and also meeting management, with an online booking system and smart âsecurity fobâ entry.\n\nWeâve also increased and improved our video conferencing facilities â both top-end video meetings and low-cost webcam chats â to help minimise the need for long-distance travel, especially by plane.\n\nAudio-visuals\n\nSound and video systems around the building â including the display screens in the public reception area, in the auditorium, Learning Zone, boardroom and main office areas â were installed by Marquee AV.\n\nEquipment used included Tannoy passive array loudspeakers, Audica sound systems, Lab.gruppen amplifiers, Audio-Technica radio microphones, Christie projectors, Yamaha audio mixers, Symetrix digital processing and Tandberg video conferencing equipment. We also have induction-loop and infrared-assisted hearing systems.\n\nForward-looking ICT\n\nInside the Living Planet Centre's IT server room â the room is kept cool by the ground source pump system, and the heat generated by the server equipment is used to help warm the rest of the building\n\nEven our server room/datacentre is green and energy-conscious. Often rooms full of IT equipment need special cooling, but at the Living Planet Centre itâs just kept cool with the same low-energy cooling system used throughout the building. (Though we admit we do have a backup cooler unit in case of a power cut.)\n\nAfter their initial input, Cisco have continued to work with us to deliver sustainable technology, both in the UK and across the WWF global network â helping to shape our ICT strategy over the coming years.\n\nThe hardware recycling aspect is particularly important to us. We want to show other IT departments in organisations around the world what can be done, and that itâs possible to deliver forward-looking, sustainable ICT.\n\nWWF-UKâs Living Planet Centre is attracting an average of 25,000 visitors per year â which meets the target weâd aimed for.\n\nBy comparison, at our old building, Panda House in Godalming, fewer than 4,000 people used to visit per year â mostly conservation colleagues from around the world.\n\nPeople come to the Living Planet Centre for all kinds of reasons â not just to see what a showcase exemplar green building looks like, but for school trips, family outings, specialist talks, business meetingsâ¦ and of course to work.\n\nLetâs look in more detail at the day-to-day use of the Living Planet Centreâ¦\n\n1. Welcoming the public\n\n2. Schools and youth group visits\n\n3. Connecting with business and the community\n\n4. WWF-UK at work\n\nWelcoming the public\n\nOur âWWF Experienceâ â the four themed zones at the entrance area of the Living Planet Centre, which bring to life key aspects of our global work â is open to the public from 9am-5pm Monday-Friday (except public holidays).\n\nAnyone can drop in and explore the WWF Experience â itâs free. And it has proved hugely popular.\n\nHereâs how one local mum, Kerry J (whoâs also a blogger/photographer), described her WWF Experience visit with her eight-year-old daughter:\n\nâItâs small but perfectly and beautifully put together â a collection of amazingly crafted âpodsâ, each one covering a different part of our planet. You can just go and browse, or do a great little trail and claim your prize at the end. We did the trail and really enjoyed it.\n\nâThere is tons of interactivity, a visual feast for the eyes everywhere and lots of things to look at/through/touch. Itâs a great example of using modern technology to teach and learn in a positive way. My daughter was talking about it for days afterwards!â\n\nAs well as the WWF Experience, we also run various open days and family-focused community events at the Living Planet Centre â including hands-on activities and workshops during school holidays. (We also work with local gallery The Lightbox to deliver joint family workshops.)\n\nAnd we use our 150-seat auditorium for public film screenings, seminars, presentations and conferences.\n\nA Girls Power Tech event (part of a worldwide initiative led by Cisco to encourage more young women into technology jobs), held in our auditorium in 2015\n\nHereâs a taste of the kind of public events weâve hosted so far at the Living Planet Centre:\n\nGo wild! â creating your own wild animal mask (tigers, chimps, frogs, crocodiles, you name it) using fibre pens and tissue paper.\n\nExplore beneath the ocean â making fun floating jellyfish mobiles and colourful spiky seahorses on sticks.\n\nFairtrade Fortnight â weâve helped celebrate Fairtrade Fortnight with Woking Fairtrade Action Network, featuring a giant, 13-metre-long banana split!\n\nEarth Hour â celebrating the big annual WWF lights-out event in March, including acoustic concerts with performances from local and national acts. People can learn how to make their own sustainable tealight holders, or origami stars, or find out more about the night sky.\n\nIrish folk duo Hudson Taylor performed in the dark in the Living Planet Centre auditorium as part of WWF's Earth Hour 2015\n\nVOCE (Voices of Cambridge Ensemble) choir â uplifting choral performance in partnership with The Lightbox.\n\nâProject Wild Thingâ film screening â part of a film-led movement to get more children (and families) outdoors and reconnecting with nature.\n\nWoking Food and Drink Festival â helping promote sustainable and healthy eating as part of this large Woking Borough Council event: a great opportunity to work with other local organisations, including The Lightbox and Woking Fairtrade.\n\nSeed Pantry offering some plant-growing tips at the Living Planet Centre during the Woking Food Festival\n\nHeritage Open Days â national annual public celebration of heritage and architecture.\n\nThe Big Draw â as part of this annual national art event our visitors helped us create an amazing Amazon-inspired mural for the Learning Zone and across the Bedser Bridge over the canal.\n\nChristmas lights switch-on â we welcomed local schoolchildren to a special carol-singing evening to help us celebrate Christmas.\n\nChristmas crafts â making pom-pom and pine-cone penguin decorations, and sharing ideas for a planet-friendly Christmas.\n\nPart of the day of TEDx talks, the independently-organised TED event, held in our auditorium in January 2015\n\nTEDx Woking â we were hosts for a day of talks and discussions, part of the high-profile, independently-organised global TEDx events.\n\nWWF's Wear It Wild fundraising day at the Living Planet Centre\n\nBUILDING TOURS AND VISITS\n\nThe whole building is an educational resource. We invite politicians, business people, school governors, teachers, students, environmentalists, architects and the general public to come in for a tour of the Living Planet Centre and learn about its design and innovative use of materials.\n\nAnyone can book a âbehind the scenesâ tour of the Living Planet Centre. Weâve been offering public tours every other Friday, for individuals and groups, but we also welcome groups on bespoke tours throughout the week.\n\nThere was initially a little concern among some people working in the building that we might find the public tours a bit intrusive, or notice them adversely affecting our work.\n\nBusiness guests on a tour of the building â in this case from Granit chartered architects\n\nBut on the contrary â in our recent workplace survey, only 3.8% said they found the tours intrusive. Several people acknowledged that itâs inspiring to see visitors so interested in our building and our work!\n\nIn our first year we took more than 1,100 people on tours of the building and had visits from over 50 school and youth groups, bringing in another 1,600 people.\n\nJust a few of the comments from the Living Planet Centre visitorsâ book so far:\n\nâA wonderful, uplifting, inspiring, informative experience. What a bonus for Woking. I shall love to bring my family and friends here. Thank you.â\n\nâWe really enjoyed our visitâ¦ the interactive areas really let you see about our beautiful planet. We look forward to visiting again and will be donating. Many thanks!â\n\nâIt was fantastic. I liked how the music and videos worked together. I especially enjoyed learning about all the different animals in the wildlife exhibit zone, as it helps me with my college homework about our impact on the environment.â\n\nâAn awesome place to visit.â\n\nâSuch a great experience, I am sure that we would visit againâ¦ our brains are filled with facts!â\n\nâThis is one of the best things I have ever done.â\n\nâWhat a fabulous place, really good for all ages. I will be telling the childrenâs school to come.â\n\nItâs also a great venue for connecting with our existing supporters and members â for example weâve held:\n\nâ¢ âTeam Pandaâ training days â bringing together our challenge event fundraisers and offering advice on nutrition and training.\n\n'Team Panda' â some of our amazing active fundraisers, snapped outside the front of the Living Planet Centre\n\nâ¢ âConservation Championsâ dinner â for some of our most generous regular supporters.\n\nâ¢ âLegacyâ events â for people considering leaving gifts to WWF-UK.\n\nSCHOOLS AND YOUTH GROUP VISITS\n\nShort video about our Learning Zone and activities for younger visitors\n\nWe think itâs vital that we help young people to investigate the natural world, build their understanding of environmental issues and explore what they can do to make a difference.\n\nSo an education facility was always a key part of our vision for the Living Planet Centre, and our purpose-built Learning Zone, with its state-of-the-art facilities, really brings this to life.\n\nAlthough weâve been working with schools on environmental and sustainability issues for over 30 years, this is the first time weâve been able to welcome them to our âhomeâ. Weâve opened our doors to youth groups and families too.\n\nOur learning and creative workshops (tailored for various ages from 5-14) offer a unique, engaging and inspiring experience. Theyâre also a great way to help teachers deliver the curriculum, and youth leaders to support their members in achieving their badges and challenges.\n\nSchool pupils enjoying the Learning Zone at the Living Planet Centre\n\nThe Learning Zone itself is like a generous-sized classroom. Itâs about 90 square metres â so itâs comfortable for up to 35 children, plus their teachers or group leaders. Itâs kitted out with smartboards, tables, art tools, sinks, and storage space for coats, bags, etc.\n\nOur Learning Zone is like a decent-sized, well-equipped classroom\n\nWeâve also invested in 16 iPads and apps for the children to use. Easy-to-operate cameras, video and voice recording tools add to the fun, creativity and learning.\n\nWe have a wildlife-attracting wetland area on site too, just outside next to the canal, where we can expand the hands-on learning activities.\n\nWeâre working closely with schools and youth groups from the local area â because itâs our community, after all â but weâre also looking more widely around Surrey and out to Berkshire and Hampshire. For instance there are almost 3,000 schools within an hourâs travel of the Living Planet Centre. Some arrive by public transport, several local schools even walk.\n\nOur curriculum-linked schools workshops in the Learning Zone started in February 2014 and cover themes such as:\n\nâ¢ Amazing Amazon â with an exciting eBook-making session led by award-winning author Christiane Dorion.\n\nâ¢ Tropical Chocolate â a two-hour workshop giving children the chance to discover the products of the rainforest and to make their own delicious chocolate truffles, as well as designing their own environmentally-friendly packaging.\n\nâ¢ Meet the âGreen Ambassadorsâ â pupils create their own visitorsâ guide to the Living Planet Centre through the eyes of their favourite Green Ambassadors character.\n\nâ¢ Penguins and polar bears â invites pupils to become polar explorers and discover a world where temperatures fall far below freezing.\n\nWe also host sessions aimed at educators, such as âtrain the trainerâ events and feedback sessions for youth leaders. The Surrey Eco-Schools summit/workshop was attended by lots of key educationalists and teachers from the Surrey area. The Woking Schools Learning Partnership makes use of the Living Planet Centre regularly for educational training sessions.\n\nWe offer a range of engaging workshops for youth groups too, focusing on key species, topical environmental issues and WWF-UKâs campaigns.\n\nCONNECTING WITH BUSINESS AND THE COMMUNITY\n\nThe Living Planet Centre makes it easier for us to make connections â whether itâs with our fellow NGOs and environmental groups or corporate partners.\n\nIn our first year alone we hosted more than 50 business meetings, workshops, team away-days and events, involving groups like RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects), the Forestry Commission, Tearfund, the Green Building Council, Plan International, Chartered Institute of Building, Kingfisher, Sky, Dimension Data, Capgemini, PricewaterhouseCoopers and SABMiller.\n\nExamples of other business-oriented events weâve staged include:\n\nForest Priority campaign meeting â an opportunity to meet with representatives from a range of small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to discuss implementation of new environmental legislation.\n\nFIRME workshop â where colleagues from across the WWF network discussed financial plans for improving the health of our seas.\n\nOur auditorium is used for all kinds of events and ceremonies â for instance this was the setup for the Green Ambassadors Awards\n\nBusinesses and groups can also hire parts of the Living Planet Centre for their own events â for instance the 150-seat auditorium, the balcony area for receptions, the 20-seat boardroom, or smaller meeting rooms.\n\nBeing just 25 minutes on the train from London, offering flexible options and good technical facilities, the Living Planet Centre is an ideal venue for all kinds of events.\n\nAnd weâve welcomed local organisations like the Horsell Common Preservation Society, Woking Asian Business Forum, Surrey Ramblers Group, the Woking Chamber of Commerce and Surrey County Council.\n\nA few of our construction partners and suppliers, like Cisco, Kinnarps and Willmott Dixon, use the building regularly for events and meetings.\n\nIt all helps us spread awareness about our work to a wider audience, as well as raising revenue from hire fees.\n\nWe wanted our new forward-looking building to come with a new forward-looking work culture too.\n\nThe aim was always to be able to work more efficiently and effectively. We donât just want to do things in the same old ways, only with upgraded tools.\n\nThe changes have actually been quite far-reaching and have taken some getting used to.\n\nFor instance, weâve all been encouraged to alter how we work:\n\nâ¢ from using email to more instant messaging\n\nâ¢ from being based at one desk to being mobile and sharing spaces\n\nâ¢ from being paper-dependent to using more electronic information and storage\n\nâ¢ from having a cluttered desk to a clear desk\n\nâ¢ from travelling to meetings to using more audio/video conferencing.\n\nIt also extends to new approaches to management and teamwork â including the right kind of flexible working, where people can connect with each other easily whenever they need to.\n\nThe wireless network also helps people collaborate and stay connected anywhere and everywhere in and around the building.\n\nEveryone in the office is encouraged to be more active and move around more often than we used to, not to stay sitting in one place all the time.\n\nItâs good for us, physically and psychologically, to walk around and talk to different people. That includes at lunchtimes and breaks â which weâre all encouraged to take!\n\nTRAVELLING TO WORK\n\nWe did a lot of preparation work on travel plans before the move to Woking, including surveys, workshops and other research into various transport options.\n\nWe commissioned the University of Bath to monitor our travel methods. Research suggests that a big move like the one we were undergoing is an ideal time for people to change behaviour patterns and working habits â including the way we commute.\n\nAnd it turned out to be the case for us. People were positively encouraged to cycle to work at the Living Planet Centre, or at least use public transport wherever possible, rather than drive.\n\nIn the event, train use went up dramatically, from around 20% before the move to 56% afterwards. And car use dropped from 55% to 23%.\n\nThe change was helped by providing secure, covered storage for 30 bicycles, plus five showers and a clothes-drying room.\n\nMANAGING ELECTRICITY, WATER AND WASTE\n\nFigures show that our consumption of electricity is better (lower) than both âtypical practiceâ and âgood practiceâ benchmarks from the Better Buildings Partnership.\n\nWe have an environmental performance council that regularly reviews our energy use and sets targets for improvement.\n\nOverall, the Living Planet Centre produces nearly 25% less carbon emissions per square metre than our old Panda House building.\n\nAs for our figures on recycling and waste:\n\nâ¢ We send 0% of our office waste to landfill.\n\nâ¢ About 15% of our waste (by weight) canât be recycled or composted so itâs sent to an energy-from-waste site where waste is burned to generate electricity and/or heat.\n\nâ¢ Compost waste from the Living Planet Centre is taken away for anaerobic digestion, an industrial-scale process that produces biogas that can be used as fuel. Whatâs left can be used as fertiliser.\n\nâ¢ Office-generated waste is separated into compostables/recyclables/non-recyclables and is monitored and measured through monthly collections.\n\nOFFICE STORAGE\n\nBefore we moved to the new building we had 1,400 linear metres of stored files (over 4 linear metres per person). We allocated 2.2 linear metres per person for the Living Planet Centre, and thatâs proved ample.\n\nWe have a âdigital officeâ strategy to support this. It means we no longer need double-height storage cupboards, which makes the office more open and the sightlines clearer.\n\nWATER USE\n\nWater use in the Living Planet Centre is now being monitored. Our current water consumption is broken down as:\n\nâ¢ Mains water â 75 m3/month\n\nâ¢ Rainwater â 76 m3/month\n\nâ¢ Greywater (from sinks etc) â 2.5 m3/month\n\nBy way of comparison, our average water consumption at Panda House for the last five years we were there (2008-2013) was 1,633 m3 per year â which works out at around 136 m3 per month, entirely from mains water.\n\nWe anticipate that rainwater use will increase further and our mains water consumption will decrease even more, now that weâve resolved some initial problems with the drainage systems (for example the tanks that collect rainwater were leaking, so weâve put new lining in them).\n\nVISIBLE IMPACTS\n\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of the Living Planet Centre (to the public and to ourselves) and show our actual levels of consumption, weâve added low-energy screens around the building that show how and where weâre using electricity in the office, and how much of it is coming from the solar panels on our roof.\n\nThey also show how much mains water weâre saving by using rainwater and recycled greywater, and the composition of our waste. (It saves around 1,000 bathtubs of mains water per month!)\n\nWe have 40 meters measuring electricity use in different parts of the building, as well as water meters to measure how much greywater and rainwater weâre using.\n\nItâs great to be able to make this data available to everyone in an interesting way, rather than having technical graphs and statistics. Weâve created a powerful tool thatâs easy to understand â and we hope will inspire people to reduce their environmental impacts.\n\nLIVING PLANET CENTRE WORKPLACE SURVEY\n\nAfter weâd been in the building for a year we did another workplace survey, to assess the wellbeing, satisfaction and general mood of everyone working in the Living Planet Centre. And to see how things had changed since the last survey in Panda House.\n\nWe canât deny we had a few teething problems, as in any new building. Occasional technical glitches, odd issues with the heating in certain areas â and a few people still struggling a little with the general hot-desking idea.\n\nBut on the whole, the feeling is overwhelmingly positive â as our latest survey showed.\n\nHere are just a few sample comments:\n\nâThe whole prestigious environment I am sure impacts everyoneâs psyche: you feel youâre part of something special and you want to achieve something.â\n\nâI find the environment makes me feel part of a professional organisation while at the same time allowing me to exit the âbuzzâ and get real quiet time for tasks that need it.â\n\nâIâm sure many hate to admit it, but having the printers, bathrooms and bins concentrated in one area allows us to get up from our desk and walk a little â great to give us a much-deserved break from sitting down.â\n\nâI think the hot-desking system works well for my team, we are usually able to all sit in the same area and close to our filing. The IT systems are great and I now rarely use any paper. I like that my laptop moves seamlessly from wireless to wired connection.â\n\nâI particularly like the informal meeting areas as theyâre more âfriendlyâ and, I find, more productive!â\n\nâLovely bright spacious environment which is very conducive to knowledge-sharing and collaboration.â\n\nâThe woodland vista allows for daydreaming â very important!â\n\nâI love the natural light and the bird sounds!â (the people who enjoy spotting birds here have spotted 47 species so far).\n\nâIâm really proud to work in such an amazing building.
