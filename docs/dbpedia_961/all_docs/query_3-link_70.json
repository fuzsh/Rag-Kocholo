At the same time he ran the annual conference for the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies and edited their journal, moving it to an online format with John Wiley Ltd.\n\nOn a smaller scale, Chris co-organised the Queer People series of conferences at Christ’s College, Cambridge and the Variabilities conferences at Emory University, Atlanta and Winchester.\n\nFurther afield, Chris has been for many years an active member of the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies Queer Caucus and two years ago set up the Disability Studies Caucus.\n\nChris is in currently in discussion with four University Presses in the USA, the UK and Germany, to find the best home for a series of monographs and essay collections on disability history.\n\nPublications\n\n2019: Sight Correction: Vision and Blindness in the Eighteenth Century. Univ. of Virginia Press.\n\nThe Birth of a Clinic: the Treatment and Experience of Blindness in Eighteenth Century England\n\nA Monograph for Bucknell University Press\n\n(MS completed and with publisher)\n\nThis book will be the first major study of blindness in the eighteenth century. The book gives an alternative historiographical approach to Foucault of the way medical studies developed, considering both the doctors and patients, and lays the groundwork for a new methodology for contextual study of all types of historical texts.\n\n'A Manifesto for a Woman Writer: Delarivier Manley's Letters Written as Varronian Satire,' in The Ladies Pacquet Broke Open, eds. Aleksondra Hultquist and Elizabeth Matthews (London: Routledge, 2016)\n\nThis essay puts back the date of Aaron Santesso's ascription of Manley's use of Varronian Satire inThe New Atlantic (1710) to her first publication of 1696, making it clearer why Manley chose that form in her most important publication.\n\n'Blind Woman on the Rampage: Priscilla Pointon's Grand Tour of the Midlands and the question of the legitimacy of sources for biography,' in Voice and Context in Eighteenth-Century Verse: Order in Variety, eds. Jo Fowler and Allan Ingram, (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2015)\n\nThe essay explores the huge subscription list and Pointon's use of verse epistles and evaluates them as sources for biographical information.\n\nDevelopments in the Histories of Sexualities: In Search of the Normal\n\nBucknell University Press, 2015\n\nPaperback ISBN: 978-1-6114688-9\n\nSole editor: Contribution, Introduction.\n\nThis collection of essays marks my latest contribution to Queer Studies. My Introduction, while placing the essays in context also gestures towards the new position of \"Variability\". My introduction has been described by one anonymous reviewer as \"a major piece of scholarship\" and \"world leading\".\n\nThe Idea of Disability in the Eighteenth Century\n\nBucknell University Press, March 2014\n\n978-1-61148-559-2 Hardback\n\n978-1-61148-560-8 eBook\n\nContribution: Introduction and one essay\n\nThis is the first collection of essays about disability in the eighteenth century. The introduction explores my idea of Variability as an organising principle for the study of the multiplicity of the body in literature.\n\n\"Christopher Smart and Leicester House Opposition\", in Reading Christopher Smart in the Twenty-first Century. Eds. Min Wild and Noel Chevalier.\n\nBucknell University Press, 2013\n\nISBN: 978-1-61148-519-6\n\nThis essay revisits the work I did for my biography of Smart, and using new finds from the recently available Seaton Delaval archive makes a stronger case for Smart's involvement with Prince Frederick and John Lord Egmont's opposition to George II's ministry.\n\nDevelopments in the Histories of Sexualities: In Search of the Normal\n\nBucknell University Press, 2013\n\nISBN: 978-1-61148-500-4\n\nSole editor: Contribution, Introduction.\n\nThis collection of essays marks my latest contribution to Queer Studies. My Introduction, while placing the essays in context also gestures towards the new position of \"Variability\". My introduction has been described by one anonymous reviewer as \"a major piece of scholarship\" and \"world leading\".\n\nBeing the Body of Christ: Towards a Twenty-First-Century Homosexual Theology for the Anglican Church\n\nSeries: Gender, Theology and Spirituality, series editors Lisa Isherwood and Marcella Althaus Reid\n\nEquinox/Acumen Publishing, 2012\n\nISBN: 9781845539511\n\nMonograph\n\nThe book explores two parallel histories of the twentieth century Anglican Church. The first is tragic, telling of Oscar Wilde's rejection of it because of his homosexuality, and E. F. Benson's rejection of his homosexuality because of his father's position as Archbishop of Canterbury. The second history tells a happier tale, deriving from Edward Carpenter's positive writings about intermediate sexualities, and grounds a homosexual theology in the novels of Alan Hollinghurst and Jeanette Winterson, as well as in my recent experience of blindness.\n\nWilliam Blake and the Logic of Contraries\n\nEdwin Mellen Press, 2011\n\nISBN: 0-7734-1605-6\n\nMonograph\n\nThis book gives a reading of all Blake's illuminated work along with Vala, or The Four Zoas, in a radical re-reading of Blake's intentions gleaned from detailed research on the palimpsest of the Vala ms. There is a tight focus on Blake's use of the term \"contraries\" and as such it is very useful as a class text for advanced level students (I use the book very successfully in my classes), as well as a challenge to the current critical framework which, in my opinion, distorts Blake studies at present.\n\nThe Variable Body in History, eds. Stan Booth and Chris Mounsey (Oxford: Peter Lang, 2016)\n\nOther Publications\n\nBooks\n\nHow to Write Great Essays and Dissertations, Oxford University Press, 2013, ISBN: 978-0-19-967074-1\n\nThe 2nd edition of my successful handbook for writing undergraduate essays and dissertations: One Step Ahead in Essays and Dissertations is now in the design stage.
