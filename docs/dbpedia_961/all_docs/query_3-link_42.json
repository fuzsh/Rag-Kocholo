        "text": "Progress Notes | September 2021\n\nAlthough the summer temperatures are still with us here in Roanoke, there are certainly signs of fall around the VTCSOM campus, as we have a full house once again.\n\nBefore we get too far into this busy time of year, I’d like to reflect on some notable student research accomplishments over the summer.\n\nIn collaboration with Virginia Tech’s Translational Biology, Medicine, and Health (TBMH) program, Oscar Alcoreza became our first M.D./Ph.D. student to be awarded his Ph.D. in May. Oscar is now enjoying clinical rotations as a third-year student and is on track to graduate with the Class of 2023.\n\nThe second of our medical students to follow this path, Kenneth Young, officially entered the TBMH program and expects to earn his Ph.D. in 2023 before returning to medical school. We are grateful to the TBMH faculty for their mentorship and sponsorship of our students during their Ph.D. studies.\n\nAlex Miner, a third-year student, has spent the summer working under a prestigious Gold Foundation Student Summer Fellowship to follow her passions at the intersection of neuroscience and international health. Her research examined specific variables contributing to mental health inequities to develop interventions for patients with limited-English proficiency at the Bradley Free Clinic.\n\nIn addition, we celebrated the awarding of our first research grants under an endowment set up by Dr. Charles Schleupner. The five second-year student awardees were: Devra Asah, Kasen Hutchings, Caroline Kim, Katelynn Stebbins, and Benjamin Tintera.\n\nLook for more expanded stories about all of these in the near future, and please join me in congratulating these students on their commitment to research excellence!\n\nLee A. Learman\n\nDean\n\nRecognitions\n\nSpecial thanks to M2 Rockers Patrick Beck, Kacie Hoyt, MJ Milam, Kasen Hutchings, Kelly Ingram, and Megan Harrigan who presented an excellent \"Rockstar\" panel for the M1 students.\n\nCarilion Clinic president and CEO Nancy Howell Agee was listed as one of the top 25 women leaders in healthcare by Modern Healthcare Magazine.\n\nNL Bishop and Dave Trinkle were featured as guest speakers at Brain Injury Services of SWVA's Brain Injury Awareness and Veteran Appreciation Night.\n\nAshley DeWyer, class of 2023 is featured in this video about Rheumatic Heart Disease, part of a microdocumentary series produced by the Children's National Hospital.\n\nIsaiah Johnson will serve as interim Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology for Carilion Clinic and the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.\n\nDean Learman was a guest speaker at the second annual Black Fathers Festival.\n\nCongratulations to Paul Skolnik for appearing in a New York Times article about summer colds.\n\nWe say goodbye to Patrick Smith, systems support technician.\n\nRichard Vari received an Excellence in Teaching Award from the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at Virginia Tech.\n\nKudos to the advancement team for receiving national recognition at AAMC's GIA Awards for Excellence for their work on the Virtual Graduation Celebration for the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine's Class of 2020, which won a Bronze Award for Excellence.\n\nIn addition, a number of Carilion Clinic physicians and VTCSOM faculty were recognized in Carilion’s Cheers for Peers newsletter.\n\nPublishing\n\nAndrew Binks and Renée LeClair received a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Grant award, titled \"The impact of changing Medical Board Exam scores to Pass-Fail on student anxiety, curiosity and learning processes,\" from the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning.\n\nAndrew Binks and Jennifer Cleveland have received an Instructional Innovation Grant award titled: \"Escaping boredom and finding engagement – escape rooms in medical education,\" from the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning.\n\nAlyssa DeWyer, class of 2023, had “Establishment of a cardiac telehealth program to support cardiovascular diagnosis and care in a remote, resource-poor setting in Uganda” published in PLOS ONE.\n\nMiranda Gerrard, class of 2021, along with colleagues from Carilion Clinic and other institutions, published “Assessing presenting symptoms, co-morbidities, and risk factors for mortality in underserved patients with non-hereditary early-onset colorectal cancer” in Cureus.\n\nLee Learman and 16 other scholars recently had this report published in Phlebology: “The symptoms-varices-pathophysiology classification of pelvic venous disorders: A report of the American Vein & Lymphatic Society international working group on pelvic venous disorders.”\n\nChris McLaughlin, class of 2017, was the first of several authors on “Established primary care provider improves odds of survival to discharge for injured patients” in the Journal of Surgical Research.\n\nRobin Queen published “Sex-specific difference in dynamic balance following total hip replacement” in Innovation in Aging.\n\nRobin Queen and T.K.

Chen is now a fourth-year student, busy with rotations and electives.\n\nHumanism Notes\n\nCreating a deep well of humanism requires a full tank of self-awareness and wellness. The concept of “wellness” has been elaborated into eight distinct dimensions of holistic health: emotional, spiritual, intellectual, physical, environmental, financial, occupational, and social. Learn more about the eight dimensions (and watch the “Wheel of Life” video) to identify where you have untapped potential for increased wellness here.\n\nAll Virginia Tech employees are required to receive a COVID-19 vaccine unless they qualify for medical or religious excemption.
