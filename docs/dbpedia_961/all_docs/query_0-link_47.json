        "text": "Earn college credit as a high school student\n\nAt our five Alamo Colleges, the Dual Credit programs allow you to earn college credit for identified high school courses as an eligible high school student. For you to participate, your high school must be approved to offer dual credit courses or verification of your home school status.\n\nIf you qualify for Dual Credit, you may take courses in the 42-hour core curriculum listing or from the Professional and Technical Education (PTE) programs. Courses taken should be aligned with your degree plan or career choice."
