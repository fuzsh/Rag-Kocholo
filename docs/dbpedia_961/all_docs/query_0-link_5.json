        "text": "About my class\n\nWelcome to our wonderful world of music! My students are artistic, probing, and quick. They are engaged with new adventures and natural life exploits which are created in our music room. They absolutely love music class and enjoy a fun, safe, risk free environment. Each week, they learn rhythmic pattern reading, movement, music theory, singing, and vocabulary. Music class not only teaches them music skills, but they learn reading, writing, math, science, and social studies through many songs, instruments and games. My school has 97% who receive free or reduced meals. We are located in a low income, high crime-gang area. We have a high rate of multi-family homes as well. Many of my students' home language is other than English. With all of the obstacles they face, my students want to learn, grow in, create and express themselves through music. We hope you become a donor and pledge your support. Thank you!\n\nRead more"
