        "text": "Troy University is particularly proud of its financial aid programs. The University attempts to provide financial assistance to the maximum number of students possible. We recognize that in many instances students and/or parents are simply not able to meet the entire cost of a college education; consequently, the university participates in a variety of financial aid programs. The programs are comprehensive in nature and range from scholarships to work study.\n\nApproximately 70 percent of our students receive some form of financial assistance. Students are expected to be prepared with sufficient funds for maintenance, books and supplies for at least two weeks. Credit balance refunds are not issued until after the second week of classes.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nIt has been recognized that the cost of attending institutions of post-secondary education is greater than many families can handle alone. It is the philosophy of the financial aid office that no one should be denied a post-secondary education due to a lack of funds. Although it is primarily the responsibility of the student and/or family to pay college costs, this is not always possible. In such cases, the student should apply for financial aid to supplement family resources.\n\nParents/students should compare their award letters to our published Cost of Attendance (COA) to determine if sufficient funds are available for 100% of tuition, fees, room, board, books and supplies.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nGo to FAFSA on the Web at studentaid.gov to apply for financial aid.\n\nApply for a U.S. Department of Education FSA ID at studentaid.gov\n\nBe sure you are applying for the correct year using school code 001047.\n\nJust fill in the blanks when prompted.\n\nErrors are reduced because your answers are checked as you enter them.\n\nYour application reaches the federal processor immediately.\n\nDownload and complete all required forms on the financial aid website at www.troy.edu/financialaid\n\nAll students must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) annually for the academic year covering their enrollment periods. Financial aid is NEVER renewed automatically.\n\nPriority Dates\n\nThe FAFSA should be completed as soon after October 1 as possible for the approaching fall to be considered for all types of aid. October through April is the ideal completion period in order to have your funding available at the beginning of the fall semester. March 1st is our priority date - the date by which we would prefer you to have applied. Funds are awarded for the nine month (fall/spring) academic year - you are expected to save for summer enrollment from your fall/spring award. If you have any funds unused, these may be awarded for summer and a summer form should be completed (available from the website).\n\nIf your FAFSA information is received prior to May and your file is complete in May, your funds (assuming you complete the MPN with your lender, if required) should be ready to be placed on your account at the end of free/drop add.\n\nWork study funding is first come first serve. Money is not saved for students who have worked previously. The same is true for most other funding except for the Pell Grant and Stafford Loans.\n\nFinancial Aid Disbursement\n\nThe transmittal of financial aid will be made on the day after the drop/add period. Students will be able to receive refunds no later than 12 days after the start of classes for the term.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nStudents enrolling less than full time will have their financial aid awards reduced or cancelled according to the number of hours taken. Troy University reserves the right to adjust or cancel any aid if there is a change in academic or financial status of the aid recipient or to prevent institutional liability. Applications and brochures may be obtained by visiting the financial aid website at www.troy.edu and linking to the federal website. Financial aid may be in the form of grants, loans, scholarships or employment.\n\nGrants\n\nThe grants listed below are based on need. These grants are available only to undergraduate students who have not received a bachelor’s degree.\n\nPell Grants\n\nPell Grants help undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor’s or higher degree pay for their higher education. The U.S. Department of Education determines who is eligible by using a formula established by Congress and the information provided by the applicant on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This will produce an expected family contribution (EFC) number. The amount the applicant receives depends on the EFC, cost of attendance, enrollment status (full-time or part-time), and length of enrollment.\n\nFederal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG)\n\nFSEOG help undergraduates who hold no bachelor’s or higher degree and have exceptional financial need. Priority is given to students with the lowest EFC, determined by information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), who also receive Pell Grants. There is no guarantee that every eligible student will receive an FSEOG, so it is important to apply early to have a better chance of receiving a grant. FSEOG awards are based on the availability of funds at Troy University.\n\nFederal Work-Study\n\nThe federal work-study program is designed to encourage students to contribute to their educational expenses while decreasing their debt burden. Priority is given to students with the lowest EFC, determined by information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), who also receive Pell Grants. There is no guarantee that every eligible student will receive or renew a work-study award, so it is important to apply early to have a better chance of receiving a job. Work-study awards are based on the availability of funds at Troy University.\n\nDirect Stafford Loans\n\nDirect Stafford Loans require a FAFSA and include the following federal programs:\n\nSubsidized Loans\n\nSubsidized loans are awarded based on the student’s calculated need from the FAFSA. The interest is paid by the government while at least half-time enrollment is maintained. You are charged a fee by the federal government when you borrow; the amount of your loan sent to the school is reduced by that fee. Repayment begins six months after enrollment has ceased or dropped to below half-time status.\n\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans\n\nUnsubsidized loans are not based on calculated need, but still necessitate the filing of the FAFSA for eligibility determination. You are charged a fee by the Federal government when you borrow; the amount of your loan sent to the school is reduced by that fee. Interest is not paid by the Federal government, and the student is responsible for all interest associated with the loan. Interest payments can be capitalized (added to the loan at repayment) if no payments are made during enrollment.Repayment begins six months after enrollment has ceased or dropped below half time.\n\nDirect PLUS Loan\n\nDirect PLUS Loan is for parents of dependent students and is not based on need but a FAFSA is required. Parents may qualify for the PLUS Loan for the difference between your education costs and the amount of financial aid you are awarded.\n\nInterest rates for the Direct Stafford and Direct PLUS Loans vary. The federal government pays the interest on the subsidized Direct Stafford Loan until repayment begins. The borrower is responsible for all interest that accrues on the Unsubsidized Direct Stafford and Direct PLUS Loans from the time the loan is disbursed. More information can be found at https://studentaid.gov/.\n\nVeteran Benefits\n\nVeterans’ educational benefits are available for all eligible veterans and their dependents.
