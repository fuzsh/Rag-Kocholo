Findings from recent sales management research are blended with examples of current sales management practice into an effective pedagogical format. Topics are covered from the perspective of a sales management decision maker. This decision-making perspective is accomplished through a modular format that typically consists of discussing basic concepts, identifying critical decision areas, and presenting analytical approaches for improved sales management decision making. Company examples from the contempo- rary business world are used throughout the text to supplement module discussion. STRENGTHS OF THIS EDITION The sixth edition of Sales Management: Analysis and Decision Making has several important strengths. The authors teach sales management courses and interact with sales managers and sales management professors on a regular basis. These interactions with practicing professionals and students ensure that the text covers the appropriate sales management topics and employs effective pedagogy. This new edition continues what has been effective in previous editions, but contains changes that improve content and pedagogy. The key strengths of the sixth edition include: • The 10 modules and paperback format from the previous edition are maintained. This makes it easy for professors to cover the text in a semester or quarter, and still have sufficient time to use active learning exercises throughout the course. All of the important sales management topics are addressed and students can purchase the text for much less than a typical hardcover sales management book. • All new Opening Vignettes are used to introduce each module. These vignettes gen- erate student interest by presenting examples of current sales management practice in leading firms. • Revised “Sales Management in the 21st Century” boxes and new sales executives have been added in our Sales Executive Panel. • The introduction of an important trend—the move from an administrative to an entrepreneurial perspective—has been introduced in Module 1. The turbulent envi- ronment facing most sales organizations requires that sales managers act more as entrepreneurs and less as administrators to be successful. • New or expanded coverage of important topics such as customer relationship man- agement (CRM); outsourcing the salesforce; and key differences among sales leader- ship, management, and supervisory activities can be found throughout the text. • Role-play exercises for Ethical Dilemmas and the short cases are included at the end of each module. These role plays give professors the opportunity to involve students actively in exploring complex ethical and sales management situations. • New or updated exercises in the Building Sales Management Skills section can now be found at the end of each module. Many of these exercises require the use of the Internet, but all involve students actively in the learning process. P r e f a c e 31451_00_Prelims.qxd 15/03/05 15:22 PM Page v\n\n7. LEVEL AND ORGANIZATION This text was written for the undergraduate student enrolled in a one-semester or one- quarter sales management class. However, it is sufficiently rigorous to be used at the MBA level. A sales management model is used to present coverage in a logical sequence. The text is organized into five parts to correspond with the five stages in the sales management model. Part One, “Describing the Personal Selling Function,” is designed to provide stu- dents with an understanding of personal selling prior to addressing specific sales man- agement areas. We devote one module at the beginning of the text to this topic. Part Two, “Defining the Strategic Role of the Sales Function,” consists of two mod- ules; one discusses important relationships between personal selling and organizational strategies at the corporate, business, marketing, and sales levels. This module focuses on how strategic decisions at different organizational levels affect sales management deci- sions and personal selling practices. The second module in this part investigates alternative sales organization structures and examines analytical methods for determining salesforce size, territory design, and the allocation of selling effort. Part Three, “Developing the Salesforce,” changes the focus from organizational top- ics to people topics. The two modules in this part cover the critical decision areas in the recruitment and selection of salespeople and in training salespeople once they have been hired. Part Four, “Directing the Salesforce” continues the people orientation by discussing the leadership, management, and supervisory activities necessary for successful sales management and examining important areas of salesforce motivation and reward systems. Part Five, “Determining Salesforce Effectiveness and Performance,” concludes the sales management process by addressing evaluation and control procedures. Differences in evaluating the effectiveness of the sales organization and the performance of sales- people are highlighted and covered in separate modules. PEDAGOGY The following pedagogical format is used for each module to facilitate the learning process. Learning Objectives. Specific learning objectives for the module are stated in behav- ioral terms so that students will know what they should be able to do after the module has been covered. Opening Vignettes. All modules are introduced by an opening vignette that typi- cally consists of a recent, real-world company example addressing many of the key points to be discussed in the module. These opening vignettes are intended to gener- ate student interest in the topics to be covered and to illustrate the practicality of the module coverage. Key Words. Key words are highlighted in bold type throughout each module and summarized in list form at the end of the module to alert students to their importance. Boxed Inserts. Each module contains two boxed inserts titled “Sales Management in the 21st Century.” The comments in these boxes are provided by members of our Sales Executive Panel and were made specifically for our text. Figure Captions. Most figures in the text include a summarizing caption designed to make the figure understandable without reference to the module discussion. vi Preface 31451_00_Prelims.qxd 15/03/05 15:22 PM Page vi\n\n8. Module Summaries. A module summary recaps the key points covered in the module by restating and answering questions presented in the learning objectives at the begin- ning of the module. Developing Sales Management Knowledge. Ten discussion questions are presented at the end of each module to review key concepts covered in the module. Some of the questions require students to summarize what has been covered, while others are designed to be more thought-provoking and extend beyond module coverage. Building Sales Management Skills. Application exercises are supplied for each mod- ule, requiring students to apply what has been learned in the module to a specific sales management situation. Many of the application exercises require data analysis. Many modules also have an Internet exercise to get students involved with the latest technol- ogy. Role plays are also included in most modules. Making Sales Management Decisions. Each module concludes with two short cases. Most of these cases represent realistic and interesting sales management situa- tions. Several require data analysis. Most are designed so that students can role play their solutions. CASES The book contains a mixture of short, medium, and long cases. The 18 short cases at the end of modules can be used as a basis for class discussion, short written assignments, or role plays. The longer cases are more appropriate for detailed analysis and class dis- cussions or presentations by individuals or student groups. The longer cases are located at the end of the book.

Jason Karem is sales manager for Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Emerging Business Services Division. He manages nine sales associates who sell payroll, tax filing, time-and-attendance, and human resource–related services to business customers. Although each day is different and challenging, Jason describes a “typical day” for him. A majority of my time is spent out in the field with the sales associates, helping them master all of the business calls they make in a given day. 7:45 A.M.—Arrive at the office to revisit training topic for the morning, review sales calls for the afternoon, and handle administrative tasks such as e-mail and voice-mail. This is when I touch base with my boss to brainstorm any focus items for the week. 8:30 A.M.—Group training with the sales associates. This is a 45-minute training topic focused around either improving selling skills or building relationships with key business partners. We review the material for 15 minutes and break into groups for 30 minutes of role playing. The role playing is the most important part of any training, because it really helps the associates feel comfortable with what they will say when they get out in the field. It is the practice before game time. 9:30 A.M.–12:00 noon—Planning sessions with various salespeople on the team. The purpose of these sessions is to go over certain accounts or specific sales presentation items and to develop each person while assist- ing him or her close any outstanding quotes. During this time I typically make thank-you calls to partners that referred business to us in the past week and make executive thank-you calls to prospects that sales associates met with during the past week. The goal is to build that partner relationship even more and let the prospects know that we appreciate the opportunity to earn their business. 12–4 P.M.—Sales calls. During a field ride with my sales associates I have one goal: Help them improve. The way I do this is with a sales call feedback form, which outlines the whole sales call, from building rapport to closing the sale. We review the calls together and develop action items to talk about at our planning session at 4 P.M. 4–5 P.M.—Planning session with the sales associate. This is when we really focus on the items the associate wants to improve. Using a coaching and counseling model, I assist the salesperson in creating a game plan to take what he or she learned today and incorporate into tomorrow’s calls. This is primarily done through doing a mock sales call. First, I model the call to the associate and then the associate role plays the call back to me. If my associates can each get better at one item and closer to their goals, whether that item is a certain selling skill or strategizing on closing a deal, I feel I have done my job. That feeling is what energizes me into getting up the next morning and doing it all over again. 1 1 M o d u l e C H A N G I N G W O R L D O F S A L E S M A N A G E M E N T 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 1\n\n25. What an interesting day! Jason is a field sales manager. He works directly with the sales associates assigned to him. He conducts some of this work in the office, but much of his time is spent in the field making calls with sales associates, then coaching them to help them improve. Most of our focus is on field sales managers such as Jason. However, some of our discussion is more relevant to sales managers at various levels within a sales organization. These sales managers have different titles and may not have direct responsibility for specific salespeople, but they all perform sales management activities that affect all or most of the salespeople in a sales organization. Consider the following examples: • Clint Geffert is national account division manager for Respironics. His division sells respiratory equipment to home-care providers. There are 110 salespeople in this division. He travels about 95 percent of the time and has many sales management responsibilities.1 • Tony Bridge is regional sales manager with World Savings. He manages the mortgage origination department, which has three sales managers and 15 sales reps. Most of his time is spent on personnel issues, daily activity reports, and handling fires through- out the department.2 • Paul Gerrard is vice president of the central region for Hewlett-Packard’s enterprise and commercial sales division. He spends a large portion of his time communicating with the 340 sales managers and salespeople in his region. Much of this communication is through conference calls and e-mail. However, he is often in a different city each day and always starts the day with an informal coffee talk with sales managers and salespeople.3 • Brad Graver is western regional sales manager for Professional Office Services. He works directly with 30 sales reps to provide marketing services for healthcare firms. His reps are organized into protected geographical territories to serve mid- sized doctor’s offices.4 • Mary Kay Nedrich is director of sales training and development for Convergys. The training programs she develops for the company’s 100 salespeople include online ses- sions that salespeople can access as their schedule allows, as well as traditional seminars.5 • Randy Lofland is sales manager for Lanx Fabric. He is the one-person sales and market- ing department for the company. Instead of having salespeople, he works with six to eight distributors to reach customers. Sometimes he goes on sales calls with these distributors and sometimes he calls on customers by himself.6 These examples illustrate some of sales managers’ possible titles and activities. Depending on the company and position, sales managers may perform some or all of the sales management functions. Our objective in this module is to introduce the exciting world of sales management. We begin by presenting a general sales management model and discussing each stage in the sales management process. Then we examine some of the emerging trends in sales management, discuss the key characteristics of effective sales managers, and describe the basic format of each module. The goal is to “set the stage” for your journey into the dynamic and challenging world of sales management. SALES MANAGEMENT PROCESS The marketing communications tools available to any firm are typically classified as per- sonal selling, advertising, sales promotion, and publicity. Personal selling is defined as personal communication with an audience through paid personnel of an organization or its agents in such a way that the audience perceives the communicator’s organization as being the source of the message. This definition differentiates personal selling as per- sonal communication, whereas advertising and sales promotion are nonpersonal. Second, in personal selling the audience perceives the message as being delivered by the organization, whereas in publicity, even when it is in the form of personal communica- tion, the audience typically perceives the medium, not the organization, as being the source of the message. 2 Module One Changing World of Sales Management 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 2\n\n26. Sales management is simply management of an organization’s personal selling func- tion. Sales managers are involved in both the strategy (planning) and people (imple- mentation) aspects of personal selling, as well as in evaluating and controlling personal selling activities. They must be able to deal effectively with people in the personal selling function, with people in other functional areas in the organization, and with people outside the organization, especially customers. The sales management model presented in Figure 1.1 illustrates the major stages in the sales management process. Describing the Personal Selling Function Because sales managers are responsible for managing the personal selling function, they must thoroughly understand it. This text therefore devotes a module to that subject before discussing sales management activities. Module 2 (Overview of Personal Selling) presents the historical evolution of selling, a look at the contributions of personal selling to our economic and social systems, an examination of various personal selling approaches, and a comprehensive review of the sales process. The appendix discusses different sales jobs and career paths. Defining the Strategic Role of the Sales Function Many firms in the contemporary business world consist of collections of relatively autonomous business units that market multiple products to diverse customer groups. These multiple-business, multiple-product firms must develop and integrate strategic decisions at different organizational levels. Module 3 (Organizational Strategies and the Sales Function) discusses the key strategic decisions at the corporate, business, marketing, and sales levels and the basic relationships between these decisions and the personal selling and sales management functions. Corporate- and business-level strate- gic decisions typically provide guidelines within which sales managers and salespeople Module One Changing World of Sales Management 3 Describing the Personal Selling Function Defining the Strategic Role of the Sales Function Determining Salesforce Effectiveness and Performance Developing the Salesforce Directing the Salesforce Sales Management Model FIGURE 1.1 The four major stages of the sales management process and an understanding of personal selling are the focus of this book. 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 3\n\n27. must operate. This is especially true for firms focusing on a customer relationship management (CRM) strategy. By contrast, personal selling is an important component of marketing strategies in specific product market situations. The role of personal selling in a given marketing strategy has direct and important implications for sales managers. Strategic decisions at the corporate, business, and marketing levels must be trans- lated into strategies for individual accounts. We discuss the major elements of a sales strategy: account targeting strategy, relationship strategy, selling strategy, and sales channel strategy. Because personal selling is typically important in organizational marketing situations, we provide an explanation of organizational buyer behavior as a foundation for the development of sales strategies. Sales strategies are designed for individual accounts or groups of similar accounts. Therefore, an account targeting strategy is needed to identify and classify accounts into useful categories. Then, the type of relationship, the desired selling approach, and the most productive mix of sales channels are determined for each account category. These decisions result in an integrated sales strategy for each targeted account and account group. The development and integration of corporate, business, marketing, and sales strate- gies establishes the basic strategic direction for personal selling and sales management activities. However, an effective sales organization is necessary to implement these strate- gies successfully. Module 4 (Sales Organization Structure and Salesforce Deployment) presents the basic concepts in designing an effective sales organization structure: special- ization, centralization, span of control versus management levels, and line versus staff positions. Different decisions in any of these areas produce different sales organization structures. The appropriate structure for a firm depends on the specific characteristics of a given selling situation. If major account selling programs are used, specific attention must be directed toward determining the best organizational structure for serving these major accounts. Closely related to sales organization decisions are decisions on the amount and allocation of selling effort. We present specific methods for making salesforce deploy- ment decisions. Because the decisions on selling effort allocation, salesforce size, and territory design are interrelated, they should be addressed in an integrative manner. A number of different analytical approaches can assist in this endeavor, but “people” issues must also be considered. Developing the Salesforce The sales strategy, sales organization, and salesforce deployment decisions produce the basic structure for personal selling efforts and can be considered similar to the “machine” decisions in a production operation. Sales managers must also make a number of “people” decisions to ensure that the right types of salespeople are available and have the skills to operate the “machine” structure effectively and efficiently. Module 5 (Staffing the Salesforce: Recruitment and Selection) discusses the key activ- ities involved in planning and carrying out salesforce recruitment and selection pro- grams. These activities include determining the type of salespeople desired, identifying prospective salesperson candidates, and evaluating candidates to ensure that the best are hired. Legal and ethical issues are important considerations in the recruitment and selec- tion process. The ramifications of this process for salespeople’s subsequent adjustment to a new job (socialization) are also examined. Module 6 (Continual Development of the Salesforce: Sales Training) emphasizes the need for continuous training of salespeople and the important role that sales managers play in this activity. The sales training process consists of assessing training needs, devel- oping objectives, evaluating alternatives, designing the training program, carrying it out, and evaluating it. Sales managers face difficult decisions at each stage of the sales train- ing process, because it is not only extremely important but also expensive, and there are many sales training alternatives available. 4 Module One Changing World of Sales Management 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 4\n\n28. Directing the Salesforce Hiring the best salespeople and providing them with the skills required for success is one thing; directing their efforts to meet sales organization goals and objectives is another. Sales managers spend a great deal of their time in motivating, supervising, and leading members of the salesforce. Module 7 (Sales Leadership, Management, and Supervision) distinguishes between the leadership, management, and supervisory activities of a sales manager. Leadership activities focus on influencing salespeople through communication processes to attain specific goals and objectives. Management activities include all aspects of the sales man- agement process, such as recruiting, selecting, and training salespeople. Supervisory activities are concerned with day-to-day control of the salesforce under routine operat- ing conditions. Key issues and problems in sales leadership, management, and supervi- sion are discussed. Module 8 (Motivation and Reward System Management) presents several content and process theories of motivation that attempt to explain how individuals decide to spend effort on specific activities over extended periods of time. Sales managers can use these theories as a foundation for determining the best ways to get salespeople to spend the appropriate amount of time on the right activities over a period of time. These the- ories provide the basis for specific salesforce reward systems. Both compensation and noncompensation rewards are examined. The advantages and disadvantages of different compensation programs are investigated, as well as methods for sales expense reim- bursement. Specific guidelines for developing and managing a salesforce reward system are suggested. Determining Salesforce Effectiveness and Performance Sales managers must continually monitor the progress of the salesforce to determine current effectiveness and performance. This is a difficult task, because these evaluations should address both the effectiveness of units within the sales organization and the performance of individual salespeople. Module 9 (Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Organization) focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of sales organization units, such as territories, districts, regions, and zones. The sales organization audit is the most comprehensive approach for evaluating the effectiveness of the sales organization as a whole. Specific methods are presented for assessing the effectiveness of different sales organization units with regard to sales, costs, profitability, and productivity. Skill in using these analyses helps a sales manager to diag- nose specific problems and develop solutions to them. Module 10 (Evaluating the Performance of Salespeople) changes the focus to eval- uating the performance of people, both as individuals and in groups. These perform- ance evaluations are used for a variety of purposes by sales managers. Specific criteria to be evaluated and methods for providing the evaluative information are examined, and the use of this information in a diagnostic and problem-solving manner is described. A method for measuring salesperson job satisfaction, which is closely related to salesperson performance, is presented as well. SALES MANAGEMENT TRENDS The turbulent business environment presents a variety of challenges. Many sales organiza- tions face fierce global competition in both home and international markets. The purchas- ing function is increasingly viewed as an important way for organizations to lower costs and increase profits. Therefore, buyers are more demanding, better prepared, and highly skilled. The costs of maintaining salespeople in the field are escalating at the same time that sales organizations are being pressured to increase sales but decrease the costs of doing business. Thus, sales organizations are being challenged by competitors, customers, and even their own firms. Module One Changing World of Sales Management 5 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 5\n\n29. Many sales organizations are responding to these challenges by making dramatic changes in sales operations. Consider what some companies are doing. • The Bose Corporation’s sales organization is involved in hundreds of activities ranging from direct-to-consumer promotions to nationwide reseller programs. Since the sales organization is organized into regional groups, it is difficult to ensure that selling efforts are coordinated effectively. The company implemented a customized customer rela- tionship management (CRM) program to address this problem. The CRM program standardized the process for planning and managing sales activities, tracking leads, and monitoring reseller programs. The system also automates tracking inventory records and submitting expense reports.7 • Marriott salespeople represent hotel brands such as Ritz-Carlton, Courtyard, and Fairfield Inns. Because customers differ in purchasing preferences, Marriott employs several sales channels. Customers who already know what they want can make book- ings directly through the Internet or by calling one of Marriott’s event-booking centers staffed by inside salespeople. Customers who need help in making an appro- priate choice are serviced by the field salesforce. These salespeople try to identify the specific Marriott brand that will best meet a customer’s needs.8 • Salespeople at Johnson Control’s Automotive Systems Group (ASG) try to create long-term relationships with customers. To this end cross-functional sales teams work closely together, even going on joint sales calls. The marketing department does extensive consumer research on automobile buyers. Salespeople give this research to automobile manufacturers to add value to their relationship. Sometimes, salespeople set up offices at customer sites to service these customers more quickly.9 These situations illustrate some of the ways sales organizations are responding to the challenges facing them. Some of the changes are relatively minor, whereas others repre- sent radical departures from past operating methods. Even though many firms are making significant changes in sales management, the framework presented in Figure 1.1 is still relevant. All sales organizations must somehow address each stage of the sales management process. What is changing, however, are the types of decisions made at each stage and how these decisions affect other stages in the sales management process. We think that the challenges facing sales organizations will continue to increase. Therefore, successful sales organizations will be those that are willing to change and meet these challenges. Several of the most important sales management trends are pre- sented in Figure 1.2. Many of these trends are the result of a more strategic perspective toward sales organ- izations. As companies adopt a market orientation, the role of sales managers and sales- people becomes strategically more important. Market-oriented firms typically develop customer-centric cultures and establish organizational structures around customers rather than products. Market segmentation and prioritizing customers within target markets becomes increasingly important. Selling is viewed more as a core business process rather than a tactical activity. This strategic perspective considers the sales organ- ization as critical in delivering value to customers and generating profits for the firm. Sales managers and salespeople need to change many of their activities to be successful in a more strategic role.10 From Transactions to Relationships The traditional transaction selling model is increasingly being replaced by more relationship-oriented selling approaches. Instead of an emphasis on selling products in the short run, salespeople are being required to develop long-term relationships by solving customer problems, providing opportunities, and adding value to customer businesses over an extended period of time. Sometimes, the shift to a relationship approach is demanded by specific customers. For example, companies such as Ford, Xerox, and General Electric have drastically reduced the number of their suppliers. Instead of working with many suppliers for a particular product or service, these firms want to deal with only one supplier or a few suppliers. Because these buyers desire 6 Module One Changing World of Sales Management 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 6\n\n30. long-term relationships with fewer suppliers, suppliers have no choice but to adopt a relationship approach if they want to sell to them. In other cases, sales organizations have been more proactive in establishing a rela- tionship strategy. These sellers realize that their long-term success depends on having long-term customers. Helping customers improve their business operations is the best way to develop the long-term customer relationships that will lead to long-term success. The key sales management task is determining the appropriate type of relationship to pursue with specific customers. Some customers want and can best be served with a transaction approach. Others require some type of relationship strategy. There are, however, different types of relationships that might be established between buyers and sellers. These are difficult but critical decisions for sales organizations, because the type of relationship affects all other aspects of sales management. The relationship selling trend is exhibited in the following examples: • Texas Nameplate Company (TNC), with $4 million in annual sales, is the smallest company to win the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award. TNC focuses on retaining customers by being viewed as a trusted and valuable supplier. The company uses customer visits and response cards to generate feedback from customers and to take corrective action when problems are identified. Twice a year salespeople get a printout of customers who have not made a purchase during the past 12 months. The salespeople visit these customers, and one year they recovered 78 inactive accounts. This relationship orientation is working, as more than 62 percent of customers have been doing business with TNC for more than 10 years.11 • DXI sells software and services to companies that use ocean transportation. The com- pany’s online database with ocean transportation rates can help customers solve a variety of problems, but many customers viewed the company as just another vendor. Ed Ryan, vice president of sales and marketing, decided to change this. Module One Changing World of Sales Management 7 Sales Management Trends FIGURE 1.2 Transactions Relationships Individuals Teams Sales Volume Sales Productivity Management Leadership Administrative Entrepreneurial Global From To Local Many sales organizations are responding to the challenges facing them by making changes in their sales operations. 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 7\n\n31. He initiated a sales training program to help salespeople develop different types of relationships with different customers. Strategic resource relationships were estab- lished with the best customers. In these relationships, DXI is regarded as a consult- ant helping the customer improve its business by reducing transportation and other costs. DXI benefits from these relationships by generating higher margins and having more control over the sales process.12 • Salespeople from General Motors Service Parts Operation (GMSPO) used to focus entirely on selling car parts to dealers. Now, the emphasis is on helping the dealers improve business operations. The salespeople present detailed, easy-to-read reports on a dealer’s business in the form of a Dealer Business Profile and Dealer Dashboard. The salesperson and dealer discuss this information to identify problem areas and to devise solutions to these problems. This consultative service is valued by the dealer and helps to strengthen the relationship with GMSPO.13 We examine the move from transactions to relationships throughout the remainder of the text. However, particular attention to relationship selling approaches is provided in the personal selling module (Module 2). In addition, an important element of a sales strategy is determining the type of relationship desired with each account. This strategic decision is examined in detail in Module 3. From Individuals to Teams The importance of the “lone-wolf, superstar” salesperson is diminishing in many sales organizations, especially when the focus changes from just selling products to solving customer problems. In many situations, no one person possesses the knowledge and skills needed to identify and solve customer problems. Typically, some type of teamwork is required. This teamwork may be among individuals in the sales organization, between the sales and marketing departments, or among the functions within the business. Although there are many possible teamwork approaches, the trend from individuals to teams is becoming increasingly prevalent. One way to view teamwork approaches is presented in Exhibit 1.1.14 At one extreme is a core selling team—a formal sales team assigned to a specific customer. Team mem- bers can come from all business functional areas. Normally, a core selling team is headed by a sales manager. An example is the national account program employed by Nalco. When Nalco wins a national account, employees from Nalco and its customer form an 8 Module One Changing World of Sales Management EXHIBIT 1.1 Sales Teamwork Approaches Core Selling Team Selling Team Relatively permanent, customer- Relatively temporary, transaction- focused group focused group Membership determined by job Membership determined by assignment to a specific buying involvement in sales transaction for a organization particular good or service One team per buying unit One selling center per sales opportunity Membership relatively stable Membership very fluid Characteristics of team depend on Characteristics of team depend on characteristics of buying organization characteristics of sales opportunity Mission is strategic with respect to the Mission is tactical with respect to the buying organization sales opportunity Different teamwork approaches that sales organizations can use are represented by this continuum. 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 8\n\n32. account team. The team includes a Nalco senior executive who is paired with a senior executive from the customer company. The remainder of the team consists of people from sales and other functions at Nalco matched by the customer’s counterparts. As expressed by Jim Scott, Nalco’s vice president of corporate sales: “To be successful, you have to have people matched up from both the customer and supplier sides, from the executive level on down.”15 In the middle of this continuum is a formal sales team designed to close a transaction with a specific customer. For example, Lockheed Martin Information Technology put together a team of sales, management, technical, pricing, contracts, and executive lead- ership to try to win a contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The team set up a command center near the customer, followed the Win Plan sales process, and created the slogan “One Company, One Team.” All members of the team worked together to devise responses to the customer’s negotiating points. This team process was expensive and took one and a half years to complete, but the result was a $401 million contract.16 At the other extreme is a selling center where individuals are involved in a particular sales transaction in an informal teamwork approach. Individuals can come from any business function and can participate at any stage of the sales process. Often, it is the responsibility of the salesperson to orchestrate the resources of the selling organization to meet the needs of the buying organization. The Holophane Corporation imple- mented a sales automation system to facilitate teamwork among the business functions. All orders are entered directly into a database that is accessible to all departments involved in manufacturing and executing the order. As engineering and manufacturing work on the order, its status is continuously updated. Customer service personnel can easily respond to customer inquiries about the order or make changes in the order requested by customers. The sales automation system provides the information the busi- ness functions need to work as a team to meet customer needs.17 Between these two extremes is a variety of approaches that differ in degree of formality, composition of team members, number of teams, and other characteristics. The important point is that the need for teamwork and the development of various types of selling teams is likely to increase in the future. And, as sales organiza- tions move from a focus on individuals to an emphasis on teamwork, many aspects of sales management must change. Therefore, we examine the teamwork trend throughout the text. From Sales Volume to Sales Productivity The basic role of a sales organization has been to sell. Salespeople and sales managers are normally evaluated and rewarded according to total sales volume generated over some time period. Although sales volume is important, many companies are finding that all sales are not equal. Some sales are more profitable than others. Therefore, more sales organizations are focusing not just on “sales for the sake of sales,” but on the prof- itability of sales. This changes the focus from sales volume only to sales productivity. Sales productivity includes the costs associated with generating sales and serving cus- tomers. A sales productivity orientation emphasizes producing more sales for a given level of costs by doing things more effectively or more efficiently. Increasing sales productivity usually requires a sales organization to do some things differently. Consider the following examples: • Many companies use travel incentives to motivate salespeople. Because of tight budgets and tough economic times, companies are keenly interested in making sure the benefits from these incentive programs exceed program costs. TRAVEL’ round designs, administers, and fulfills the awards for sales organization travel incentive pro- grams. The company spent $1.5 million on Web technology to put these programs online. The cost savings from going online are tremendous. According to Bob Ryan, president of TRAVEL’round: “We can administer an incentive program online for 5,000 people for the same cost as for 50 people.”18 Module One Changing World of Sales Management 9 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 9\n\n33. • Intel’s Business Conferencing Group uses what it makes to increase sales productivity. The company used a multipoint videoconference to communicate the launch of its new Team-Station 4.0 videoconferencing system to about 40 sales reps in North America and Europe. The full-day program linked 20 sales offices and some reps in their homes. The videoconference was interactive as all participants could ask ques- tions at any time. The participants rated the program as very effective, and the cost savings in relation to bringing everyone to the same location were substantial.19 • Fisher Scientific International’s salespeople often show up for training programs in their pajamas. That is because the training programs are on the Web. The salespeo- ple can receive training programs in their homes, cars, hotel rooms, or wherever they bring their laptop computers. Using a Web-based product called Performance Learning System, salespeople receive product training, take an exam, or post mes- sages to product experts wherever and whenever they want. The company saves money on travel costs and the salespeople save valuable selling time.20 The common element in all these situations is that some changes were made to increase sales productivity. Some things were done differently to get “more bang for the sales buck.” This pressure to increase sales productivity is likely to intensify in the future for most sales organizations. In one sense, all sales management decisions can be viewed from a sales productivity perspective. Sales managers should continuously be trying to “do more with less.” Therefore, we address sales productivity throughout the sales management process. However, sales productivity is especially relevant when developing sales strategies (Module 3), organizing selling activities and deploying selling effort (Module 4), and evaluating sales organization effectiveness (Module 9). From Management to Leadership Many sales organizations use a hierarchical, bureaucratic structure. Sales managers operate at different levels with direct supervisory responsibility for the level below and direct account- ability to the management level above. Thus, field sales managers operate as the “boss” for the salespeople who report to them. They are responsible for the performance of these sales- people and exercise various types of control to get salespeople to produce desired results. Although this approach might work well in very stable environments, many sales organizations realize that this approach makes it difficult for them to be responsive in a rapidly changing environment. These sales organizations are “flattening” the hierarchy and empowering salespeople to make more decisions in the field. This changes the role of sales managers and their relationship with salespeople. The basic trend is for a sales manager to lead more and manage less. One study found that sales managers are playing more of a leadership role by emphasizing: • collaboration rather than control • coaching instead of criticism • salesperson empowerment rather than domination • sharing information rather than withholding it • adapting to individual salespeople rather than treating everyone the same.21 This emphasis on leadership means that a sales manager’s job is more to help salespeo- ple perform better and less to control and evaluate salespeople. This change in orienta- tion is illustrated in Exhibit 1.2.22 Several studies reinforce the importance of leadership skills for sales managers. One study of 900 salespeople found that the skills salespeople most desired from their sales managers were good communication skills, the ability to motivate, and training and coaching.23 Another study indicated that the major reason salespeople leave their firms is because of dissatisfaction with their sales manager.24 Similar results were found in another study in which salespeople suggested less loyalty to their firm because of con- cerns about their sales manager’s ability to lead them.25 Finally, a study of 130 global firms reported that leadership was the most important quality of sales executives.26 10 Module One Changing World of Sales Management 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 10\n\n34. Debbie Smith, North American sales manager for Extended Systems, agrees with the results of these studies: Salespeople want to know that you’re there for them. Managers need to show their reps that they’re prepared to listen and work with them. Managers who just hand out leads, sit in their office doing budgets, and talk to salespeople only when necessary are going to be hated by their people.27 The trend toward a leadership orientation by sales managers is examined throughout the text. However, Module 7 (Sales Leadership, Management, and Supervision) is devoted entirely to discussing the important leadership versus management and supervision issues. From Administrative to Entrepreneurial Consistent with the move from less management to more leadership, there is a trend from less emphasis on administrative activities to more of an entrepreneurial orientation through- out a sales organization. One study found that sales managers wanted to spend less of their time on administrative tasks and internal, nonsales functions and much more time with customers in selling and market development activities.28 This shift requires sales managers to be more entrepreneurial in their sales management and marketplace activities. An entrepreneurial orientation consists of three basic dimensions: proactiveness, risk- taking, and innovation. Sales managers exhibiting an entrepreneurial orientation do not just respond to whatever happens, they make things happen. These sales managers are willing to take calculated risks and to perform activities in new ways. They look for and pursue opportunities and leverage resources in unique ways. An entrepreneurial orien- tation is much different from the administrative orientation of the past.29 W. L. Gore & Associates provides an interesting example of an entrepreneurial orien- tation as well as several other sales management trends. No one in the company holds a title other than associate and technically no one is anyone else’s boss. All work gets done by small teams. Sales leaders emerge by earning followers. These sales leaders function more like coaches than bosses, and spend most of their time guiding, directing, and encouraging salespeople through face-to-face communication. Sales associates develop their own territo- ries and sales forecasts, and then discuss them with their sales leaders. The teams within each division are encouraged to generate their own ideas and strategies with a focus on customer retention and long-term success. This unusual but very entrepreneurial orientation has helped Gore grow to over $1 billion in annual sales.30 From Local to Global The marketplace is now global. Products and services are produced and marketed throughout the world. Most companies are involved in the international marketplace in some way now and are likely to become more involved internationally in the future. This trend toward a global orientation includes operating in international markets but goes Module One Changing World of Sales Management 11 Yesterday Today Natural resources defined power. Knowledge is power. Leaders commanded and controlled. Leaders empower and coach. Leaders were warriors. Leaders are facilitators. Managers directed. Managers delegate. Several important changes in effective leadership have occurred over the years. Leadership Trends EXHIBIT 1.2 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 11\n\n35. well beyond just this geographic dimension. Even companies that do business only in the domestic market, such as the United States or a region of the United States, might compete against firms from other countries, use international suppliers, work with inter- national partners, be affected by international events, serve customers from other coun- tries regardless of where the customers are currently located, and/or have employees from other countries and cultures. Any of these situations requires a sales organization to expand from a local to a more global focus. The most obvious need for a global orientation occurs when a company moves into unfamiliar international markets. More and more companies are having to do this to achieve growth objectives, because many local markets are not growing. Operating in international markets presents difficult challenges for sales managers. United Parcel Service (UPS) is a good example of a company facing these challenges. UPS delivers more than 1 million packages each day to over 200 countries. The company has invested $11 billion in technology to connect buyers and sellers around the world through e-commerce. Ted Gandolf, vice president of worldwide sales, thinks the technology infrastructure “helps us build credibility” to sell UPS services internationally.31 Less obvious, but of increasing importance, are the many situations in which a global orientation is needed to be effective in a sales organization’s domestic market. Competing against international competitors, serving customers from other countries and cultures, and managing a diverse salesforce are of particular relevance to sales managers. Few markets or sales organizations are homogeneous. Most are becoming more and more heterogeneous and diverse. Take the situation in the United States. One study projected that 75 percent of the pop- ulation growth in the United States will come from Asian, Hispanic, and African-American groups.32 Thus, in the years to come, an increasing proportion of the labor pool for sales organizations and customers for consumer marketers in the United States will come from these cultural groups. Jerry DiMonti, Century 21 People Services Realty, has taken advan- tage of this situation. His company operates in an area outside New York City with 89 nationalities. To sell effectively in this marketplace, his 33 sales agents include individu- als with Italian, French, African-American, Guatemalan, Puerto Rican, Jamaican, Nigerian, Jewish, Indian, and South African backgrounds. This diverse sales organization selling to diverse customers has increased company sales dramatically in the past two years.33 The pharmaceutical industry provides another example of the importance of cultural issues in sales situations. Cultural issues are often relevant in the relationship between a pharmaceutical sales rep and physicians, and between physicians and patients from different cultures. CPRi Communications has developed online training that allows pharmaceutical sales reps to role play interactions in cultural situations and to receive feedback from trainers.34 EFFECTIVE SALES MANAGERS Sales managers face many challenges in today’s business environment. They must be able to implement all stages of the sales management model (see Figure 1.1) and implement the sales management trends throughout this process. So, what does it take to be an effective sales manager? Several studies and evaluations of leading sales organizations suggest that effective sales managers employ a strategic perspective that focuses on customers; are able to attract, keep, and develop sales talent; and leverage technology throughout the sales organization.35 A Strategic Perspective Focused on Customers As emphasized earlier in this chapter, effective sales managers need to be more strategically oriented. This requires bringing a customer focus to the development of organiza- tional strategies and creating sales strategies to meet the needs of different customers in a profitable manner. 12 Module One Changing World of Sales Management 31451_01_ch1_p001-016.qxd 15/03/05 15:29 PM Page 12\n\n36. PeopleSoft represents a good example of a customer-focused strategic perspective. All of the company’s organizational strategies are built around customer satisfaction. Sales organization compensation is not only tied to sales quotas, but also to measures of customer satisfaction and the service customers receive from the PeopleSoft sales organization. Sales strategies emphasize a dedicated account executive for each major client. These clients have one point of contact with PeopleSoft. So, each customer can contact their account executive, and the account executive’s job is to do whatever is necessary to meet the customer’s needs.36 Attract,Keep,and Develop Sales Talent A critical part of sales management is related to people issues. Hiring the best salespeo- ple, making sure they stay with the sales organization, and helping them perform at their highest levels are some of the most important accomplishments of effective sales man- agers. One study found that “sales is essentially a talent-driven occupation.” World-class sales organizations hire the best people and engage them.37 General Electric does an especially good job with sales talent. It spends a great deal of time trying to hire the best salespeople; then its sales managers focus their attention on supporting and developing these salespeople. Sales managers help each salesperson develop a performance management plan and then meet with them three to four times a year to assess progress. Extensive product and selling skills training is also provided. These efforts have helped General Electric to attract and retain a talented salesforce.38 Leverage Technology The proper use of information and communication technologies can help salespeople and sales managers perform their jobs more effectively and efficiently. The key task is to select the right technology and ensure that it is used in the appropriate manner. Effective sales managers leverage technology to increase productivity throughout their sales organization. Charles Schwab integrates technology into its sales strategy so that customers can choose any sales channel they want to use for any interaction. A customer could use the Internet one day, visit a salesperson the next day, and use the phone on another day. Oracle has taken a different approach by shifting to an online sales model. Routine activities are performed electronically so that salespeople can spend more time building relationships with customers and less time with mundane paperwork.39 The most effective sales managers are those who find the proper blend of people and technology to meet the needs of customers and salespeople. In addition to these general perspectives, the best sales managers focus on a number of specific activities in their interactions with salespeople:40 • Prepare their sales team for constant change by being a role model and mentoring salespeople. • Earn the trust of salespeople by being dependable and competent, and exhibiting integrity. • Give salespeople continuous feedback in a positive manner. • Build enthusiasm throughout the sales team. • Get involved by being accessible to salespeople and visible to customers. • Grow and develop salespeople by emphasizing continuous job improvement and career development. As you can see, sales management is a complex, constantly evolving field. Each module in the text is designed to address key sales management issues and to illustrate the impor- tant changes being implemented by leading sales organizations.

Therefore, its aim is to provide comprehensive coverage of sales management in a manner that students will find interesting and readable. Each module blends recent research results with current sales management practice in a format designed to facilitate learning. At the beginning of each module, “Objectives” highlight the basic material that the student should expect to learn. These learning objectives are helpful in reviewing modules for future study. An opening vignette then illustrates many of the important ideas to be covered in the module, using examples of companies in various industries to illustrate the diversity and complexity of sales management. Most of the companies described in the vignettes are well known, and most of the situations represent real actions by these firms. Key words in the body of each module are printed in bold letters, and figures and exhibits are used liberally to illustrate and amplify the discussion in the text. Every figure contains an explanation so that it can be understood without reference to the text. Each module contains two boxed inserts entitled Sales Management in the 21st Century. The examples in both boxes have been provided specifically for this textbook by sales executives from various companies whom we recruited to serve as a Sales Executive Panel. To ensure that the textbook includes the latest practices from leading sales organizations, each executive was asked to provide specific examples of “best prac- tices” in their company. Backgrounds of each executive are provided at the end of this module. Sales managers are confronted with various ethical issues when performing their job activities. Many of these ethical issues are addressed in the Ethical Dilemma boxes that appear in the remaining modules. You will be presented with realistic ethical situations faced by sales managers and asked to recommend appropriate courses of action. A module summary is geared to the learning objectives presented at the beginning of the module. Understanding Sales Management Terms lists the key words that appear in bold throughout the module. Developing Sales Management Knowledge presents 10 questions to help you develop an understanding of important sales management issues and relationships. Building Sales Management Skills consists of exercises in which you can apply the sales management knowledge learned in the module. Making Sales Management Decisions includes two interesting case situations that allow you to make important sales management decisions. If you understand sales management terms, develop sales management knowledge, and build sales management skills, you will be prepared to make successful sales management decisions.
