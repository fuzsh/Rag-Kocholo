        "text": "Linda Howard\n\nFind books by Linda Howard (click here)\n\nFind eBooks by Linda Howard (click here)\n\nFind eAudiobooks by Linda Howard (click here)\n\nLinda Howard is known for her edgy and sensual Romances with sexy, tough heroes and women who know themselves and what they want. Although she has written other types of Romance, Howard writes mainly Contemporary Romance and Romantic Suspense. The romantic relationship is the most important element of these stories. Attraction between the main characters is immediate, with respect following soon after and trust taking a while longer. Howard‘s stories are fast-paced and she uses dialogue and multiple points of view to move the stories forward. Start with: Dream Man.\n\nGenre:Contemporary romances; Romantic suspense; Thrillers and suspense\n\nPace:Fast-paced\n\nTone:High-drama; Steamy; Suspenseful\n\nWriting Style:Compelling\n\nIf you like Linda Howard, then here is a list of similar authors\n\n(To go to the full list in NoveList Plus, click here)\n\n1. Garwood, Julie\n\nReason: Julie Garwood is a good match for Linda Howard as she also switched from writing Romances to Romantic Suspense. While Howard’s stories are grittier, they share the ability to craft a nice love story even if it is set in a scary situation. Readers also appreciate their skills in developing well-drawn characters and witty fast-paced dialogue. — Krista Biggs\n\n2. Robb, J. D., 1950-\n\nReason: J. D. Robb might appeal to Howard readers who enjoy solid mystery and gritty settings along with their spicy romance. Relationships (romantic, business, and family) among a group of people are important, along with the essential element of suspense and the military or police-centered cast of characters. — Katherine Johnson\n\n3. Gerard, Cindy\n\nReason: Linda Howard writes fast-paced, character-driven suspense stories where the attraction between the male and female protagonists is immediate but trust is slow in coming. Those who enjoy her might also enjoy Cindy Gerard, who writes character-driven romantic suspense stories full of sexual tension, plot twists, and danger. — Nanci Milone Hill\n\n4. Gould, Judith\n\nReason: Although Linda Howard’s work is slightly steamier, both she and Judith Gould share a deft hand at dramatic romantic suspense. Their complex characters and compelling plots are sure to keep readers engaged, thrilled, and utterly charmed. — Mike Nilsson\n\n5. Palmer, Diana\n\nReason: Linda Howard and Diana Palmer are known for their romances rife with suspense (romantic and other) and tough, sexy heroes that meet just the right women to get through to their softer sides. Romance is often the main element of the story, and the happy ending hard-won. — Melissa Gray\n\n6. Foster, Lori, 1958-\n\nReason: These authors both focus on contemporary romances and romantic suspense novels. Their heroines are no easy conquests — male and female characters alike are capable, strong, and determined, and the plots are fast-paced, steamy, and appropriately suspenseful. — Shauna Griffin\n\n7. Lowell, Elizabeth, 1944-\n\nReason: Both Linda Howard and Elizabeth Lowell write edgy and very sensual Romances, however, Howard fans should be aware that Lowell’s heroes can take lot longer than Howard’s to come to respect, much less trust, their heroines. Howard and Lowell are closest in style and characterization in their Frontier / Western titles. — Krista Biggs\n\n8. Krentz, Jayne Ann\n\nReason: Both Linda Howard and Jayne Ann Krentz write fast-paced Romantic Suspense with well-developed characters and witty dialogue. Keep in mind that the Romantic Suspense written by Jayne Ann Krentz is lighter in tone than that of Linda Howard – she creates a menacing atmosphere but does not portray explicit violence. — Krista Biggs\n\n9. Sutcliffe, Katherine\n\nReason: Katherine Sutcliffe, long known for Historical Romance, now also writes Contemporary Romantic Suspense. In these, her writing style has a dark edginess and erotic sensuality that should appeal to those who are Linda Howard fans. — Krista Biggs\n\nSeries by Linda Howard"
