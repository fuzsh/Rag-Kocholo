Roanne takes us back to her university days, where she stumbled upon computers for the first time. Little did she know that this encounter would ignite a passion within her, leading her on a remarkable path in the tech industry. Roanne emphasizes that getting into tech is achievable for anyone. Surprisingly, only about 20% of technology is actually about the technology itself. The remaining 80% revolves around people. It is the driving force behind technological advancements. Roanne highlights the importance of being genuinely interested in people as the first step towards building a successful technical career. Looking towards the future, Roanne expresses her love for being in the technology field. She describes it as an amazing career and industry. However, she acknowledges the rapid pace of technological change. Roanne eagerly awaits what lies ahead, knowing that whatever she is doing today may not be the same in two or three years. The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps her on her toes, ready to embrace new opportunities and challenges. Don't miss out on this insightful video featuring Roanne Steele, where she shares her passion for technology and her anticipation for the future. #Techstep #techforward #techworld #techpeople\n\nThanks to Women in Tech forum for having me on their recent panel. We discussed a topic incredibly close to my heart around future proofing your career, career progression and challenging yourself. I truly believe that if you sit inside your comfort zone for too long then three things happen: 1. You stop learning and therefore you stop growing. The best opportunities to develop your skills, or gain new ones, nearly always happen outside that circle of safety we can be accustomed to reside in. 2. You miss out on opportunities entirely. If you don‚Äôt open yourself to consider different roles, projects, new technologies or responsibilities then these opportunities don‚Äôt even seek you out. It‚Äôs like sitting inside a closed box‚Ä¶. the chances simply fly over the top without recognition of you even being there. 3. New talent overtakes you. People who stay comfortable where they are miss chances to progress and literally open the door for others who are willing to take the step through. You can hear my top three takeaways below. #womenintech #womenempowerment #lifeatnetapp NetApp NetApp Women in Technology\n\nDid you read our Top 10 Reasons why you should attend #DellTechWorld article?
