        "text": "Charles Dickens Book List – The Novels, Novellas and Short Stories of Charles Dickens\n\nWondering what books Dickens wrote? He was the author of 15 novels. (However, one of those is incomplete.) He also wrote short stories, essays, articles and novellas.\n\nNote that A Christmas Carol isn’t included in the list of novels. Because of its length, it’s classified as a novella.\n\nHere’s a list of all Dickens’s novels and a partial listing of his other work.\n\nThe 15 Novels by Charles Dickens Listed by Publication Date\n\nThe Pickwick Papers – 1836\n\nThe Pickwick Papers, also known as The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, was the first novel of Charles Dickens.\n\nChapman & Hall published it in monthly installments from March of 1836 until November 1837.\n\nDickens worked a very serious subject into comedic Pickwick Papers, that of the injustice of the justice system.\n\nOliver Twist – 1837\n\nThe second novel of Charles Dickens was Oliver Twist. The first edition had a longer title, Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy’s Progress.\n\nIt was initially published in monthly installments that began in February 1837 and ended in April 1839.\n\nDickens named the character Fagin after Bob Fagin, a fellow employee that young Charles Dickens met when he worked at a blacking factory.\n\nNicholas Nickleby – 1838\n\nThe first installment of Nicholas Nickleby was published on March 31, 1838 and the last installment was published on October 1, 1839.\n\nDickens’s mother, Elizabeth Dickens, was the model for the always-confused Mrs. Nickleby. Luckily for Charles, she didn’t recognize herself in the character. In fact, she asked someone if they “really believed there ever was such a woman”.\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop – 1840\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop was published in installments in the periodical, Master Humphrey’s Clock. The first installment was printed in April of 1840 and the last was printed in February of 1841.\n\nDickens was traumatized by the death of the book’s character, Little Nell. As he was writing the novel he felt as though he were experiencing the death of one of his children. It also brought back painful memories of the death of his sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth.\n\nBarnaby Rudge – 1841\n\nBarnaby Rudge was published in installments from February to November of 1841. It appeared in the magazine Master Humphrey’s Clock.\n\nThe historical novel is set during the Gordon Riots of 1780.\n\nMartin Chuzzlewit – 1843\n\nMartin Chuzzlewit was first published by Chapman & Hall in installments that began in January of 1843 and ran through July of 1844.\n\nThe novel was written after Dickens traveled to America in 1842. The trip left Dickens with a very unfavorable impression of the United States.\n\nDombey and Son – 1846\n\nDombey and Son was first published in installments that began in 1846 and ran through 1848.\n\nDickens gave a reading of the first installment of Dombey to some of his friends. It went very well and gave Dickens the idea of doing public readings.\n\nDavid Copperfield – 1849\n\nDavid Copperfield, Dickens’s eighth novel, was first published as a serial. The first installment was published in May of 1849. The last installment was issued in November of 1850.\n\nDavid Copperfield held a special place in Dickens’s heart. In the preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens wrote, “like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.”\n\nBleak House – 1852\n\nBleak House was published in installments from March 1852 through September 1853.\n\nThis novel has the distinction of being perhaps the only work of classic literature featuring a character that dies by spontaneous combustion\n\nHard Times – 1854\n\nThe novel first appeared in Dickens’s weekly periodical, Household Words. Hard Times was published in installments that began in April of 1854 and ran through August of 1854.\n\nHard Times takes an unsympathetic look at Utilitarianism. This no-nonsense movement relied heavily on statistics, rules and regulations.\n\nLittle Dorrit – 1855\n\nLittle Dorrit was published in installments from December of 1855 through June of 1857.\n\nThe Marshalsea debtors’ prison plays a large part in Little Dorrit. What very few people knew was that Dickens’s father had been sent to Marshalsea for three months.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities – 1859\n\nThe first chapters of A Tale of Two Cities appeared in print in April of 1859. The last chapter was printed in November of that same year.\n\nA play, The Frozen Deep, was the inspiration for A Tale of Two Cities. Not only did the play give Dickens the idea for A Tale of Two Cities, it brought about lasting changes to Dickens’s life in the form of Ellen Ternan.\n\nGreat Expectations – 1860\n\nGreat Expectations was initially published in All the Year Round, a weekly periodical founded and owned by Charles Dickens. There were nine monthly installments, running from December of 1860 until August 1861.\n\nIn the novel, Pip, like Dickens himself, dreams of becoming a gentleman. However, Pip comes to realize that there is more to life than wealth and station.\n\nOur Mutual Friend – 1864\n\nOur Mutual Friend is the last novel that Charles Dickens completed before his death.\n\nAn interesting feature of the novel is its focus on the “dust” business.\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood – 1870\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood was the fifteenth novel of Charles Dickens. Dickens was only halfway finished with the book when he died.\n\nPartial Listing of Novellas, Short Stories and Other Works by Charles Dickens in Alphabetical Order\n\nThe Battle of Life – Published in 1852\n\nTo Be Read at Dusk – Published in 1846, it’s the fourth of his Christmas books.\n\nA Child’s Dream of a Star – Published in 1850\n\nThe Chimes: A Goblin Story\n\nA Christmas Carol – Published in 1843\n\nA Christmas Tree\n\nThe Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home – Published in 1845\n\nA Dinner at Poplar Walk – This was Dickens’s first published work of fiction.

Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins wrote the first, second and fifth chapters of this collaborative work.\n\nMr. Minns and his Cousin – This was the second title for A Dinner at Poplar Walk.\n\nMrs. Lirriper’s Legacy – Published in 1864\n\nMrs. Lirriper’s Lodgings – Published in 1863\n\nNo Thoroughfare – This was co-written with Wilkie Collins.\n\nNobody’s Story\n\nPrince Bull – Published in 1855\n\nPublic Life of Mr. Trumble, Once Mayor of Mudfog\n\nSketches by Boz – Collection of essays originally published between 1833 and 1836.
