        "text": "Biography\n\nDr. Matthew Causey is currently Head of School of Creative Arts at TCD. He is Professor in Drama, College Fellow, and Director of the Arts Technology Research Laboratory. He is author of 'Theatre and Performance in Digital Culture: from simulation to embeddedness' (Routledge 2006). Recent publications include the essay 'Postdigital Performance' in 'Theatre Journal' (2017). He co-edited 'The Performing Subject in the Space of Technology: through the virtual towards the real' (Palgrave, 2015) which includes his chapter, 'The Right to be Forgotten and the Image-Crimes of Digital Culture'. He edited with Fintan Walsh 'Performance, Identity and the Neo-political Subject' (Routledge, 2014). His essay 'The Object of Desire of the Machine: the biopolitics of the posthuman' is anthologized in 'Resisting Biopolitics: philosophical, political and performative strategies' edited by Wilmer and Zukauskaite (Routledge, 2015). His theoretical writings on performance and techno-culture are published in 'Theatre Journal', 'Theatre Research Int'l', 'Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism', and 'TheatreForum' among others. In 2017 he was keynote speaker at the TaPRA (Theatre and Performance Research Association) Conference at Birkbeck University. In 2016 he keynoted at the 'Coimbra International Conference On the Virtual' at University of Coimbra, Department of Philosophy, Portugal. He was the keynote speaker at the Irish Museum of Modern Art's symposium on the artist John Gerrard. In 2015 he was keynote speaker at Ghent University's conference 'Does It Matter: Composite Bodies and Posthuman Prototypes in Contemporary Performing Arts' and the 'Digital Echoes' symposium at Coventry University. Funded by the HEA he created the Arts Technology Research Laboratory, which serves as an interdisciplinary postgraduate research centre in the area of art, technology and digital culture. He designed the Arts Strand of the HEA-funded Ireland-wide PhD in Digital Arts and Humanities which partners TCD, UCC, NUIM, NUIG and northern partners UU and QUB in a collaborative programme training researchers in new technologies, practices and theories of digital research. Dr. Causey is also a digital filmmaker and he has adapted, edited and directed three of Samuel Beckett's televisual works, 'Ghost Trio', 'Nacht und TrÃ¤ume' and ' but the clouds '. His film, 'Frank and Marie', was an official selection of both the Boston Irish Film Festival and Dublin's Darklight Digital Festival in 2004. As a musician he has recently produced two releases of original compositions, 'The Art of Living' and 'Obedientia Civium Urbis Felicitas' with his band Tujacques whose live performances included a spot at the Electric Picnic 2012. As a theatre-maker his performance work 'Tall Ships' was featured in the Dublin Fringe Festival 2014. Matthew's long career in theatre and performance, film and video stretches back to the seminal art period of the East Village and Soho in the 1970s and 80s. His original theatre works including 'Luminous Bodies', 'Paradise Regained', 'The Book of Ezekiel' and 'The Ecstasy of St. Zero, Retold' were performed throughout Soho during that time and were all chosen as 'Choices' in NYC's 'Village Voice'. The works were presented at such venues as the Envelope at the Performing Garage, the Open Space in Soho, and Soho Books. While working in the film industry in LA as an actor and editor he wrote/directed the experimental film 'Radio Word' (1983) featuring the machine-art provocateurs, Survival Research Laboratories. In the 1990s, after earning his PhD at Stanford University, he continued his work as an artist experimenting in new forms of computational and video art with his research group PTRL (Performance Technology Research Laboratory) at Georgia Tech where he was Asst Professor. Dr. Causey developed many intermedial works with PTRL including 'The Bacchae', 'Electricity (after Frankenstein)' and a production of 'Faust' was staged at Atlanta's 7 Stages."
