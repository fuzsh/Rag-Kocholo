Hold on to your hats and be prepared for polyester! Come on board the 506 Streetcar and explore Gerrard Street East in the 1970s and 1980s! We board at River and Gerrard, cross the bridge over the Don, cruise by the old grim jail, through “Chinatown 2” as it used to be called, past Riverdale High, the Indian Bazaar (Little India to many oldtimers) and on to East Toronto and the Main Subway Station.
