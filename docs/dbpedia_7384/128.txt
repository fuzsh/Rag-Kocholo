Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (21 June 1905 â€“ 15 April 1980) was a French existentialist philosopher. His philosophy centered around the individual and he stated that, "Hell is other people" in his play No Exit.[1]

Sartre criticized both bourgeois democracy and Leninism, believing they both "serialized" individuals and eliminated their freedom. He believed that revolution was impossible in his lifetime. However, he supported the Algerian War of Independence.[1]
