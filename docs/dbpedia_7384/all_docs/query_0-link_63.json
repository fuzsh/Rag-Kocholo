        "text": "Jean Paul Sartre had a great influence on many areas of modern thought. A writer of prodigious brilliance and originality, Sartre worked in many different genres: as a philosopher, a novelist, and a cultural critic.\n\nSartre is one of the key figures in the philosophy of Existentialism, which emphasises the existence of the individual or human subject who faces existential angst in an apparently absurd world. He is credited for revivifying and popularising Existentialism to the world after it had remained quite stagnant since the death of Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard.\n\nIt was no accident that his philosophy reached a wide public for the first time during the immediate aftermath of World War Two, France was an exhausted country and Sartre‚Äôs ideas brought a message of hope, the old frameworks of value on which people lived on were collapsing, including family values and Christian beliefs. Sartre saw that people were starting to take responsibility for their actions and for him this was a great opportunity for his philosophy.\n\nSartre was born in Paris, in 1905. The only child of his father, an officer of the French Navy, who died when he was just two years old. He was raised by his mother Anne-Marie, whom he was very fond of and his grandfather Charles Schweitzer, who introduced Sartre to classical literature at an early age.\n\nAs a teenager, he was frequently bullied, in part for having a strabismus in his right eye, a problem with eye alignment. He was also very short, standing at around 5 feet tall in his adulthood, he felt that he had an ugly physically appearance and focused all his energy on his mind.\n\nHe studied philosophy and psychology at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, one of the most prestigious graduate schools in Paris that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals.\n\nHe quickly developed a reputation as an unconventional bohemian figure. The student who came second to him in their final philosophy exams was the writer Simone de Beauvoir, a prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship, although it was quite open and they were not monogamous.\n\nSartre served as a meteorologist in World War Two and was captured by German troops, spending nine months in prison. During this time, he read Martin Heidegger‚Äôs Being and Time and was greatly influenced by it.\n\nSartre was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize. He was horrified by the idea of being incorporated into the establishment.\n\nBy this time, Sartre had become a household name. He was often seen frequenting caf√©s where he wrote while he chatted with his colleagues. He remained a simple man with few possessions and was actively committed as an activist, taking part in various strikes.\n\nOn one occasion he was arrested for civil disobedience. French president Charles de Gaulle intervened and pardoned him, saying that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt arrest Voltaire‚Äù.\n\nAlthough Sartre spend much of his later life trying to reconcile the individualist philosophy of Existentialism with the collective vision of Marxism, ending up in a sort of anarchism, we‚Äôll be focusing on thoughts of the Existentialist Sartre, not his later controversial political life.\n\nWe‚Äôll be exploring his main ideas which include: Nausea, the Absurdity of the World, Existence precedes Essence, Freedom, Bad Faith, The Look and Hell is Other People, among others.\n\nüìö Book recommendations\n\nAs an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases at no additional cost to you.\n\nüì∫Watch The Full Video!üß†\n\nGreatest Philosophers In History | Jean Paul Sartre\n\nThis video explores Sartre‚Äôs main ideas including: Nausea, the Absurdity of the World, Existence precedes Essence, Freedom, Bad Faith, The Look and Hell is Other People, among others.\n\nSupport Eternalised\n\nBuy Official Merch\n\n‚ÄúA room without books is like a body without a soul.‚Äù ‚Äî Cicero\n\nDiscord Community\n\nFollow Eternalised on social media!"
