        "text": "Ronald Aronson praises Jean-Paul Sartre’s existential Marxism in an essay in the Boston Review. I argue that existential Marxism is a case of a contradictio in adiecto. Sartre was never recognized as a Marxist by his contemporaries. He not only failed to show any interest in the question of economic exploitation, but most of the answers he gave in the Critique even contradicted Marxist theory. His expression of Marxism as the philosophy of our time seems to have rather been more an act of courtesy than the expression of deep conviction. As Sartre himself later said, Marxism and existentialism are quite separate philosophies.\n\nThe Legend of Three Ethics Sartre's three ethics-the ethics of freedom from the 1940s, the ethics of equality from the 1960s, and the ethics of fraternity from 1980. As catchy and striking as this answer to the question of Sartre's ethics is, it conceals more than it reveals. Not only does it hide the Nietzschean ethics of the early Sartre, but it also stages the publication of L'espoir maintenant (1980) as an ethics that it actually is not. L'espoir maintenant, the conversation between Sartre and Benny Lévy, is rather the conclusion of Sartre and Lévy's project on Pouvoir et liberté, which addresses the question of whether freedom is possible in relationships characterized by power. Sartre's answer to this question in an interview with Lotta Continua in 1977 was clear: libertà e potere non vanno in coppia-freedom and power do not go together. For Sartre, full freedom is only possible in an anarchist society in which people live together in fraternity/siblinghood in small groups based on similar designsfraternity is a basic concept of his first and, moreover, anarchist political philosophy of the 1970s, not of his ethics.\n\nThis essay is divided into three parts. In the first, I develop a new interpretation of Sartre&#39;s notion of an original project, or original choice, by emending his initial position in Being and Nothingness, and by extrapolating from his autobiography and his psychobiographies on Baudelaire and Flaubert. In the second part, I examine the early and late Sartre&#39;s paradoxical commitment to self-analysis, and go on to draw taut the tension in the late Sartre between individual freedom and relations to others. I demonstrate that the tension in the thought of the late Sartre can be explained and resolved only with reference to Sartre&#39;s own original projects. The third part is devoted to briefly analyzing what combination of factors in Sartre&#39;s developmental history led to his original projects, in view of a possible psychobiography on Sartre. Nearly everything covered in this essay is an attempt by Sartre to appropriate Freud as an instrument in his own thought (Pontalis, 1...\n\nThis paper attempts to understand the emergence of the concept of freedom under Sartre’s philosophy and dwell deeper into the understanding and implementation of the same. Furthermore this paper looks into the critical analysis of his theory and concepts pertaining to freedom prominently. Although human freedom today is the most fundamental idea that has driven the development of democratic politics around the world. It is taught as one of the essential tenets of human life from a very early age. Lack of freedom is used as reason for meddling in the affairs of others. Rarely does something as fundamental as freedom emerge as a contentious issue and rarer does it get redefined. However, Sartre’s philosophy does redefine it in a way that it may change your way of looking at life\n\nIn this essay, I attempt to remedy the relative neglect that has befallen Sartre’s analysis of social relations in the Critique of Dialectical Reason. I show that, contrary to the interpretation of certain commentators, Sartre’s analysis of social relations in this text does not contradict his earlier works. While his early work focuses on individual-to-individual social relations, the Critique of Dialectical Reason complements this by focusing on the way various group formations constrain or enhance the individual’s practical freedom. To outline my argument, I first discuss the relationship between Being and Nothingness and the Critique of Dialectical Reason before going on to identify the four group formations Sartre discusses in the Critique of Dialectical Reason and the implications each has for the individual’s practical freedom. I argue that while the group formations called the series and the institution constrain the individual’s practical freedom, the open, democratic group formations called the group-in-fusion and, in particular, the organized group, enhance the individual’s practical freedom. Because it is membership of an organized group that best enhances the individual’s practical freedom, I conclude by arguing that Sartre implicitly holds that the individual’s practical and political activity should be directed towards the establishment of a group formation that has the characteristics of an organized group."
