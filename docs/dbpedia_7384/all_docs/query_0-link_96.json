        "text": "1. Philosophical School of Thoughts Dr. SHAFAYAT ALI Assistant Professor/HOD Department of Mass Comm. Govt. College of Science, Wahdat Road, Lahore\n\n2. What are “schools of philosophy”?  The term “school of philosophy” is used to label particular philosophical beliefs or traditions.  It is NOT a physical school building.  A “school” is a group of people, especially philosophers, artists, or writers, whose thoughts, works, or styles demonstrate a common origin, influence or unifying belief.\n\n3. What are “schools of philosophy”?(cont.)  Basically, schools of philosophy are philosophical movements, wherein an idea gains popularity and becomes more widely believed.  A movement or school represents the broad views of many individual philosophers, even if they may not agree entirely in all respects. Because of this, members tend to agree on most points, but not necessarily all.\n\n4. Influential Schools of Philosophy  Different schools of philosophy gain and lose popularity over time. Some die out, while new ones continue to be developed.  However, many of the schools of philosophy developed by the ancient Greeks are still very influential today in Western civilization.\n\n5. Different Schools of Philosophical Thought  Absurdism  Agnosticism  Anarchism  Atheism  Atomism  Communitarianism  Confucianism Creationism Cynicism Deism Egoism Empiricism Epicureanism Existentialism Hedonism Humanism Idealism Intuitionism Irrationalism Liberalism Marxism Materialism Nihilism Objectivism ………………………….\n\n6. Different Schools of Philosophical Thought (cont.)  Phenomenology Spiritualism  Platonism Stoicism  Positivism Structuralism  Postmodernism Taoism  Pragmatism Transcendentalism  Pyhtagoreanism Transhumanism  Quietism Utilitarianism Rationalism Vitalism Realism Voluntaryism Skepticism Theism Solipsism Sophism and countless more -------------------------\n\n7. Summary  Absurdism – The world is too crazy to understand, just enjoy it.  Anarchy – No government, no rules, personal freedom, but no private property, no rights.  Confucianism – Chinese humanist philosophy emphasizing compassion.  Communitarianism – Community comes first, self comes second. Opposite of individualism.\n\n8. Summary (cont.)  Creationism – The world and all life was created by a divine power, exactly as told in holy texts.  Determinism – The future has already been decided and is unchangeable.  Existentialism – There is nothing but this life and the personal meaning you create for yourself in it.  Liberalism – Personal freedom and equality, but with inherent rights.\n\n9. Summary (cont.)  Nihilism – nothing means anything, there is no point to life, and no “good” or “bad”.  Empiricism – Philosophy of science; evidence (through direct experience) is the only way to gain true knowledge.  Stoicism – Suffering is natural, but if you live in accordance with nature you can limit that suffering.  Theism – Belief in a god or gods (i.e. Christianity, Islam, Judaism).\n\n10. Why so many?  Each of the previously mentioned philosophical schools represent a different way to think about and potentially understand the world and our place in it.  These various philosophies also approach the issue of ethics differently, some going so far as to claim that there really is no such thing as “right” or “wrong”.  All of the decisions made that affect our individual lives and our civilization as a whole have some philosophical foundation.\n\n11. Major Philosophical School of Thought Idealism Realism Pragmatism Existentialism\n\n12. IDEAISM  Idealism is based on the early writings of Plato.  It believes on that ideas are the only true reality .  Idealism is the approach that focuses on a subject matter curriculum that concentrates on the cultures great and enduring ideas, values are universal, absolute and perceptual.\n\n13. REALISM  Realism is based on the thinking of Aristotle .  Reality exists independent of the human mind. \n\n14. PRAGMATISM  Pragmatism is based on the thoughts of a number of nineteenth-century American philosophers.  Pragmatists believe that reality is constantly changing and that we learn best through applying our experiences and thoughts to solve problems.\n\n15. EXISTENTIALISM  Existentialism is based on the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre.  Individual interpret the world from their own perceptions and create their own realities."
