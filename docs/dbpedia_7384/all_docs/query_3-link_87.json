        "text": "Jean-Paul Sartre's 1961 famous and infamous preface to Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth has engendered the common impression of Sartre as an intellectual who was particularly hostile to Europe. In revising this perception, this article reviews Sartre's engagement with the idea of Europe over many decades. This certainly included critique, but also nuanced and positive considerations of what Europe and being European meant. This thinking about Europe is to be situated, first, in terms of Sartre's evolving philosophical project to reconcile freedom and facticity, and second, in political and intellectual contestations over Europe in the context of fascism and the Second World War, postwar international relations, and the emergence of the Third World. Sartre's contribution to these debates was an adumbration of a \" knotted Europe, \" the provincialization of Europe whilst retaining a commitment to universalism, and a notion of Europe as an ongoing project rather than an ossified identity. \" To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, doing away with oppressor and oppressed at the same time: what remains is a dead man and a free man. \" 1 These words are from Jean-Paul Sartre's infamous 1961 preface to Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, written at the height of the Algerian war of decolonization. His intervention—in equal parts famous and infamous—has engendered the perception that Sartre had a particularly hostile attitude toward Europe. He has consistently been represented as either anti-European or simply not interested in Europe. Ignoring or dismissing Sartre's Europeanism has been much the rule.\n\nThe Legend of Three Ethics Sartre's three ethics-the ethics of freedom from the 1940s, the ethics of equality from the 1960s, and the ethics of fraternity from 1980. As catchy and striking as this answer to the question of Sartre's ethics is, it conceals more than it reveals. Not only does it hide the Nietzschean ethics of the early Sartre, but it also stages the publication of L'espoir maintenant (1980) as an ethics that it actually is not. L'espoir maintenant, the conversation between Sartre and Benny Lévy, is rather the conclusion of Sartre and Lévy's project on Pouvoir et liberté, which addresses the question of whether freedom is possible in relationships characterized by power. Sartre's answer to this question in an interview with Lotta Continua in 1977 was clear: libertà e potere non vanno in coppia-freedom and power do not go together. For Sartre, full freedom is only possible in an anarchist society in which people live together in fraternity/siblinghood in small groups based on similar designsfraternity is a basic concept of his first and, moreover, anarchist political philosophy of the 1970s, not of his ethics."
