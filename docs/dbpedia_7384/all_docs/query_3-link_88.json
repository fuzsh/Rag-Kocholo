        "text": "The French Revolution began in the domain of philosophy and social theory. French materialist philosophy, social theory and socialist ideas were significant influences on the development of Communism and major contributors to Marx’s ideas. The following writers of Pre-Revolutionary France are significant:\n\nThe Rationalist philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes (1596-1650), materialist philosopher Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655);\n\nThe sociologist and political philosopher Charles Montesquieu (1689-1755)\n\nfounder of the \"Physiocrat\" School of political economy FranÃ§ois Quesnay (1694-1774);\n\nsensationalist and political theorist FranÃ§ois Voltaire (1694-1778);\n\nsocial critic, founder of linguistics and educational theorist Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), whose ideas the French Revolution tried to put into practice;\n\nleader of the Encyclopaedists and materialist Denis Diderot (1713-1784), sensationalist EtiÃ¨nne Condillac (1715-1780), mathematician and sensationalist Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783), Physiocrat Jean Condorcet (1743-1794);\n\nThe mathematician and determinist Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749-1827), proponent of social roots of character Claude HelvÃ©tius (1715-1771), materialist philosopher Paul Holbach (1723-1789), and\n\nThe socialist Claude-Henri Saint-Simon (1760-1825) was among the first to outline the ideas of socialism.\n\nMarx gives the following analysis of the history of French Materialism & Communism in The Holy Family, 1845\n\nIn his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Hegel presents the following summary of French Philosophy, 1830.\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789\n\nThe Great French Revolution of 1789 not only overthrew the monarchy in France, but ultimately led to the destruction of the Old Order across Europe. (See Babeuf and the Conspiracy of Equals). Analysis of the French Revolution and the numerous upheavals which followed it, were a central concern of all the nineteenth century Marxists.\n\nIn A Short History of the French Revolution for Socialists, Belfort Bax presents the analysis that Marxists made of the French Revolution in 1890, also\n\nJean-Paul Marat. The People's Friend, Bax 1900.\n\nBabeuf and the Conspiracy of the Equals, Bax 1911.\n\nSocialist History of the French Revolution, Jean Jaurès 1901.\n\nInterpretations of the French Revolution, George RudÃ© 1961.\n\nSee the French Revolution History Archive.\n\nThe earliest utopian socialists were French:\n\nMorelly was an early Utopian socialist, about whom little is known.\n\nFranÃ§ois Charles Fourier (1772-1837) was a French socialist much admired by Marx.\n\nÉtienne Cabet (1788-1856) inspired Utopian socialist settlements in America.\n\nPositivism, on the other hand, was the dominant current of bourgeois philosophy after the Revolution. The founder of positivism was Auguste Comte (1798-1857). The economist LÃ©on Walras (1834-1910) was one of the founders of modern economic science (as opposed to “political economy”) by applying the ideas of the ‘second positivism’ to economy, and the positivist mathematician and physicist Henri PoincarÃ© (1854-1912) was one of the first to deal with the problems of epistemology being thrown up by modern physics (the subject of Lenin’s Materialism and Empirio-criticism).\n\nForemost among the opponents of positivism was Louis-Auguste Blanqui (1805-1881), the founder of Communism.\n\nSee also the archive of another revolutionary of this period: Armand Barbès.\n\nIn left-wing of French political economy was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1803-1865), the founder of anarchism.\n\nSee the Anarchism Subject Archive, including James Guillaume, Ravachol, Mikhail Bakunin (though Russian, did much of his work in France).\n\nMarx-Engels Letters on France.\n\nWritings of Marx & Engels on France.\n\nThe First International in France\n\nWhen the First International was founded in 1864, its contacts in France were Proudhonists, who wanted to confine the International to study groups reading the works of Proudhon. Later the French section expanded and was a participant in the Commune.\n\nSee First International History Archive.\n\nAfter the fall of the Paris Commune, France became the centre of opposition to Marx within the International from Anarchists.\n\nSee The Conflict with Bakunin.\n\nThe Paris Commune of 1871\n\nWhen the workers of Paris seized power in 1871, this was the first working class revolution in history to succeed in gaining power, albeit for only a few weeks. See The Paris Commune History Archive, including:\n\nTimeline of Events in the M.I.A. History Archive;\n\nOverview of the Commune in the M.I.A. Encyclopedia;\n\nThe Civil War in France, includes Marx's major writings on these events.\n\nHistory of the Paris Commune of 1871 was written by Henri Lissagaray, a participant in the Commune and translated by Eleanor Marx.\n\nEscape from Post-Commune France, is a personal account of her experiences by Jenny Marx.\n\nMarx's French sons-in-law\n\nDespite Marx's personal dislike of Frenchmen, all three of his daughters fell in love with French men: Jenny Marx married Charles Longuet, Laura Marx married Paul Lafargue and at age 16, Eleanor fell in love with Henri Lissagaray but was forbidden by Marx to marry him, later marrying the Englishman Edward Aveling.\n\nSee the Paul Lafargue Archive.\n\nAnarchism in France\n\nAnarchism can be said to have originated in France (though Spain would have a claim as well). See the following:\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1803-1865), the founder of Anarchism;\n\nMikhail Bakunin Archive (1817-1876), the Russian nobleman who was won to anarchism while in exile in France;\n\nJames Guillaume (1844-1916), student of Bakunin, anarcho-syndicalist;\n\nRavachol Archive (1859-1892), violent anarchist executed for murder and grave-robbing;\n\nEmile Henry (1872-1894), anarchist terrorist;\n\nZo d'Axa (1864-1930), artist and writer;\n\nPierre Monatte (1881-1960), revolutionary syndicalist;\n\nEugene Lanti (1879-1947) was a French Communist who developed radical ideas about “a-nationalism.”\n\nThe PCF\n\nIn 1920, the French Socialist Party decided to affiliate to the Comintern and the French Communist Party was established. The PCF remains to this day a significant force in French politics.\n\nSee PCF History Archive.\n\nThe 1960s\n\nOne of the most traumatic events to shake post-war France was the Algerian Revolution of 1959 which triggered a crisis in France.\n\nSee Algeria and the defeat of French Humanism\n\nThe Algerian crisis had a significant effect on how the student uprising and General Strike of Paris May 1968 and the political developments in France after 1968.\n\nSee France – the struggle goes on, Tony Cliff August 1968;\n\nNew Passions and New Forces, Raya Dunyevskaya 1973;\n\nInterview with Simone de Beauvoir, 1976;\n\nThe Turn in the World Situation (1968 onwards), Pierre Frank 1969.\n\nTrotskyism in France\n\nTrotsky wrote important articles on the situation in France during the period when the Comintern policy was for “Popular Front”:\n\nA Program of Action for France (1934).\n\nRomain Rolland Executes an Assignment (1935).\n\nWhither France? (1936).\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Trotskyist movement played an important role in the Resistance, despite being caught between the Stalinists on one side and the Nazis on the other. See With the Masses, Against the Stream: French Trotskyism in the Second World War by Ian Birchall.\n\nSee also the archives for: Pierre Broué, Pierre Frank and Michel Pablo.\n\nSee The Manouchian Group – an archive about a group of mainly foreign communists, remembered as martyrs and heroes of the French Resistance.\n\nOther Marxists in Post-War France\n\nFrench Marxists (though some do not really warrant the name) were among the first to outline the views which became known as “post-modernism”. These include the structuralist Louis Althusser (1918-1980), the cultural critic Guy Debord, and post-modern theorist Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard. Pierre Bourdieu, the most eminent of recent French Marxists, died in 2001.\n\nThe French Marxist and Nobel-prize-winning microbiologist Jacques Monod (1910-1976) was one of the first to raise problems of ethics in Marxism in the post-1960s period.\n\nFrench Marxists contributed to the development of Marx's ideas in the domain of cognitive psychology, and made contacts with Soviet scientists such as Luria and Leontyev. See:\n\nGeorges Politzer's Critique of the Foundations of Psychology (1928);\n\nThe work of Henri Wallon (1879-1962);\n\nLucian Sève's Man in Marxist Theory (1968);\n\nFrench Philosophy\n\nFrench philosophy has continued to be a vital current of radical ideas. It's principal figures in the twentieth century were:\n\nThe French-Swiss structural linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) who has been so influential in 20th century French philosophy;\n\nThe sociologist Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) is the main non-Marxist source for modern sociology;\n\nThe structural anthropologist Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss (b. 1908) regarded himself as a Marxist;\n\nThe Russian/French interpreter of Hegel Alexander KojÃ¨ve (1902-1968) first introduced the idea of a “struggle for recognition”, and the Hegelian psychologist Jean Hyppolite founded “French Hegelianism”, one of the fore-runners of postmodern theory;\n\nThe Phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), Existentialist and radical critic of Marxism Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980), founder of modern women's movement Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), the first theorist of the National Liberation Movement, the French-Algerian Frantz Fanon, were all strongly influenced by Marxist ideas;\n\nThe psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901-1981), literary critic Roland Barthes (1915-1980), post-structuralist Michel Foucault (1926-1984), postmodern Hegelian philosopher Jacques Derrida (b. 1930) represent a dominant anti-Marxist stream of French philosophy."
