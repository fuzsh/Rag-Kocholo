His philosophy centered around the individual and he stated that, \"Hell is other people\" in his play No Exit.[1]\n\nSartre criticized both bourgeois democracy and Leninism, believing they both \"serialized\" individuals and eliminated their freedom. He believed that revolution was impossible in his lifetime. However, he supported the Algerian War of Independence.[1]"
