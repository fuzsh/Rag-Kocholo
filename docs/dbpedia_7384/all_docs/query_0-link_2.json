        "text": "I am well aware that my discourse on anarchism may be misunderstood by North American readers, for at least two reasons.\n\n1. The anarchism to which I refer could be called specifically “Latin” in the sense that my cultural references in terms of anarchism are essentially French, Spanish, Italian and Latin American. Indeed, I was formed in my young days by militants who, in the twenties and thirties, had been active as revolutionary syndicalists in the French CGT, as anarchosyndicalists in the Spanish CNT. My early years of militancy were immersed in the company of veterans of the Russian Revolution and the Spanish Civil War.\n\n2. For this reason, my vision of anarchism must seem very obsolete, and perhaps very rigid, if not shocking to the North American reader, whose references and tradition of anarchism will probably be very different from mine.\n\nThis paper was originally intended only as a commentary on W.L. Remley's book , Jean-Paul Sartre’s Anarchist Philosophy, but it has gone beyond this intention and taken on an unexpected dimension. I apologise to readers for the digressions that are scattered throughout this text and which may not have much to do with the substance of the subject.\n\nIntroduction\n\nI recently discovered from an exchange of emails with a friend in the United States that some English-language scholars recognise Jean-Paul Sartre as an anarchist thinker. At first sight this seemed totally incongruous to me: indeed, I have been a libertarian activist for over 50 years and I had never heard such a thing . So I asked a lot of comrades - old timers like me or academics - about Sartre’s alleged “anarchism”. “The collective memory of the movement has retained no trace of a rapprochement between Sartre and anarchism . In the French anarchist movement, he has always been considered as a “crapule stalinienne” (“Stalinist scoundrel”). It is true that when he no longer was in favour with the Communist Party, his Stalinist ex-comrades also called him a “jackal with a pen” and a “typewriting hyena”... In France we say: “One lends only to the rich”. French anarchists did not digest the article Sartre wrote in 1954 on his return from the Soviet Union, entitled “freedom of criticism is total in the USSR”, not only for the factual error it asserts, but also for the revelation of its author’s ideological blindness and his disconnection from reality.\n\nThere is, however, a certain injustice on the part of French anarchists in reducing Sartre to a “Stalinist scoundrel”. While it is true that he was once associated with the defence of any dictatorship waving a red flag, it is also true that he was later associated with the anti-Stalinist left that Ian Birchall describes in Sartre against Stalinism . No doubt French anarchists have not been able to grasp the tactical subtleties that led Sartre to break away from the Stalinist Communist Party and move towards Stalinist Maoist groups...\n\nIt seems that it never occurred to anyone in France that Sartre might have been an anarchist, unless one recognises that his was a non-committal anarchism, which had no connection with political anarchism and which only referred to a rebellious temperament. Before I recently read Alfred Betschart the most recent reference (to my knowledge) to an “anarchist” Sartre dated from 2006 in an article entitled “Sartre anarchiste ou democrate en prose” (Sartre anarchist, or democrat in prose) in which the author tells us that Sartre has moved from “an elitist anarchism to an egalitarian anarchism via his association with the communists and his criticism of indirect democracy”. The author concludes by saying that “the basis of Sartre’s political thought or feeling is anarchist”, which does not prevent him from saying a few pages later that in order to realise his political project, “Sartre relies on La cause du peuple”, the newspaper of a Maoist group viscerally anti-anarchist. All this is not very consistent and actually remains within the limits of a “non-committal anarchism, which had no connection with political anarchism”.\n\nThe French anarchists were unaware that Sartre’s thought could be interpreted as libertarian. Among the great French authors of that time who had the stature of Sartre, the one who was at the top of the anarchists’ hit parade, and by far, was Albert Camus. While we find in Sartre only superficial and never argued allusions of his sympathy for libertarian ideas, Camus’ relationship with the anarchist movement was real. He was connected with the Anarchist federation, in whose newspaper, Le Monde Libertaire, he published articles. He also published in La Revolution proletarienne, a revolutionary syndicalist journal founded in 1925 by Pierre Monatte, and in Solidaridad Obrera, a journal of the Spanish CNT.\n\nThere is an extensive literature on Camus’s links with anarchism, particularly Spanish anarchism, although he never explicitly declared himself an anarchist . So if the attribution of the term “anarchist” to Sartre is open to question (and questionable, in my opinion), Albert Camus’ proximity (but not explicit membership), to the libertarian movement is not in doubt .\n\nThe paradox is that if the French anarchist movement has always expressed sympathy for Camus, it could have leaned towards Sartre if he had not chosen to express his convictions in a way that anarchists could not accept. Indeed, Sartre’s (legitimate) anti-imperialism led him, under the pretext of efficiency, to become a fellow traveller with the communists . From 1952 to 1956 he praised the Soviet regime in the press, he denounced the execution of the Rosenbergs but said not a word about the repression of the workers’ insurrection in Berlin in June 1953, he supported the exclusion of Pierre Herve who had dared to call for more democracy in the Communist party. In short, he had abdicated his mission as a critical intellectual to become the leader of an intellectual movement that had submitted to the imperatives of the Soviet Union’s foreign policy. No anarchist could admit that.\n\nCamus, for his part, had positioned himself at the head of the anticommunist left, but not for the good reasons. He rejected the justifications for the revolutionary violence of national independence movements and never took a stand for Algerian independence, although many French anarchists had clandestinely supported this cause. Furthermore, he ignored the effects of the systemic violence of the capitalist system that Sartre condemned, the insidious violence of everyday life imposed by bourgeois society - points that the anarchists were sensitive to.\n\nWhy was Sartre not recognised as an anarchist? The first reason is probably that the image of Sartre as a Marxist thinker suited both the pro- and anti- Sartrians. The other reason, put forward by Alfred Betschart, is that Sartre became blind from the spring of 1973 onwards and was “unable to read or write coherent texts”:\n\n“The only possibility left for him to express himself was the interview. However, this medium does not allow for a systematic development of his own ideas. The core of Sartre's late political philosophy is generally only weakly expressed in the interviews and only reveals itself to the reader when he or she interprets and understands the statements in the interviews against the background of Being and Nothingness, the Critique, but also the Cahiers pour une morale.”\n\nIn addition, according to Betscharf, there was sometimes a long delay between the interview and its publication, up to six years. Moreover, these interviews were published in several languages; out of 24 significant interviews conducted between 1972 and 1980, only 14 were published in French. Interesting detail: “the importance of the other languages tended to increase over time, as interest in Sartre and his philosophy steadily declined in France in the 1970s.” Finally, even Sartre's close circle - Beauvoir, Aron - were not aware of Sartre's evolution in his last years: “This lack of awareness is probably also the main reason for the rejection of Sartre's last publication before his death”.\n\nAll the reasons offered by Betschart make it possible to understand, very trivially, why the idea of an anarchist Sartre never occurred to the French libertarian movement. More seriously, what Betschart says is coherent, but not very credible. If pro- and anti-Sartrians persisted with a Marxist Sartre, it is perhaps because appearances were seriously in their favour. Whether or not he was a Marxist may be a matter for in-depth research, which will lead to the conclusion that he was, or was not, or was in some way a Marxist, but the fact remains that we are dealing with an author who produced a considerable body of work which cannot be disputed to have been theoretically under the sign of Marxism, and practically in the immediate vicinity of communism. And while he was producing this considerable work, there was never any declaration of adherence to anarchism, even if, searching carefully, one can possibly find in the Critique a few passages that could lead one to believe in common views, if not in an adhesion, to anarchism.\n\nSecondly, I don't see how seeing well can explain why an author is a “Marxist” and becoming blind leads him to be an “anarchist”. Nor do I see how becoming blind could have led Sartre to break away from the hold of Marxism and encourage him to move towards anarchism. To say that becoming blind prevented him from writing “coherent texts” is not convincing when one considers the Critique of Dialectical Reason. Becoming blind does not prevent one from dictating one’s thoughts, although this is obviously not the same thing. After all Jorge Luis Borges also became blind and defined his progressive blindness as a “slow nightfall”.\n\nEven if we admit that the core of an author's thought can only be revealed imperfectly through interviews, we are entitled to ask ourselves why an author resolves to reveal the core of his thought in interviews at the end of his life, once he has become blind, and not before when he was in full possession of his means? Betschart says that Sartre reveals his thoughts only dimly in interviews, and suggests that to really grasp them one must interpret them through the prism of other works, which confirms in my opinion how “dim” Sartre’s anarchism is.\n\nToday's reader is supposed to “deduce” from a reading of the Critique of Dialectical Reason that Sartre develops anarchist themes in it, even though he writes in this work that Marxism is the only living philosophy of this time, but that it lacks an anthropology; that it cannot survive as it is, and that existentialism, by completing it, will transform it by being be absorbed by it.\n\nSartre is right when he says that Marxism lacks an anthropology:\n\n“There is a real contrast between anarchists and Marxists with respect to anthropology, for while anarchists have critically engaged themselves with ethnographic studies, Marxist attitudes to anthropology have usually been dismissive. (...) If one examines the writings of all the classical Marxists—Lenin, Trotsky, Gramsci, Lukacs—they are distinguished by a wholly Eurocentric perspective, and a complete disregard for anthropology.”\n\nThere is a point shared by all anarchist theorists: they are more sensitive to the scientific approach than to any dialectical approach. It is significant that most of the great anarchist thinkers after Proudhon and Bakunin, who forged the core of the doctrine, are not to be found among philosophers - who devote themselves to a speculative approach to the nature and origin of the state - but among geographers who take an anthropological approach to their discipline, sociologists, anthropologists, who focus on the observation, description and analysis of political systems. It is also significant that many anthropologists, without explicitly calling themselves anarchists, have a clearly anarchist approach to their work .\n\nWhat is anarchism?\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind when considering whether a person is anarchist is to define what anarchism is, and then to see how the person’s words and actions are consistent with the definition. In particular, one must be very careful about self-proclamation of anarchism. Anyone can believe themselves to have been an anarchist at one time or another, and such proclamations Sartre made must be taken with caution: “I was always more of an anarchist than a Marxist” or “You have to understand that my anarchism, as you call it, was really an expression of freedom, the freedom I described earlier, the freedom of a writer”. In many interviews Sartre calls himself an anarchist and commentators have been careful not to contradict him, probably because it gave them copy to publish, but also because they had no competence to judge. Especially since, if one takes as a yardstick extremely eocumene and vague definitions found in dictionaries, one has no trouble fitting Sartre into the right boxes.\n\nMost of these definitions see anarchism only as an opposition to power and the state, such as William Remley’s definition of anarchism as “a system that both opposes such things as government, authority, the state or domination, but also positively advocates voluntarism, mutuality, decentralized authority, and, most significantly, human freedom”. In doing so, two absolutely essential principles of anarchism are abandoned: Proudhon very clearly stated that to be an anarchist was to be opposed to the economic exploitation of capital, the political oppression of the state and the religious alienation of God:\n\n“I deny all at once, collectively, identically and synthetically, not only the exploitation of man by man, but also the government of man by man, and the adoration of man by man.”\n\nBy linking anarchism only to the problem of power, “enlightened” commentators obscure two fundamental aspects of anarchism: This is what Sartre does. The insistence on the harmfulness of power and government as opposed to “human freedom” is not enough to qualify anarchism. Sartre was more concerned with the denunciation of oppression than with that of exploitation.\n\nPeter Marshall writes that “Anarchy is usually defined as a society without government and anarchism as the social philosophy which aims at its realisation” . To note that anarchism is opposed to the state and to say that there is a consensus among anarchists on this issue is of course correct, but it is not enough. Anarchism was not “born of a moral protest against oppression and injustice”, as P. Marshall puts it, it was born in the working class within the International Workers’ Association (IWA), created by militants who were fighting against both economic exploitation and political oppression.\n\nThe IWA was not an anarchist organisation, but it was within it that anarchism took shape. It should be remembered that whenever anarchism took the form of an active mass movement, it was among the working class and the peasantry, i.e. among the exploited workers, not among the petty bourgeois intellectuals of Boulevard Saint-Germain.\n\nTo trace anarchism back to Taoism, to the Greek philosophers of antiquity, or to the Christian sects of the Middle Ages, makes no sense. It is all very well to fight against oppression and to demand a strong power to secure oneself against it. One can fight against oppression in order to establish another form of oppression.\n\nIt is obvious that whenever men and women suffered oppression, they fought against it, but that is not enough to make them anarchists. However, among these fighters, there were undeniable precursors, such as William Godwin. To define anarchism, as Marshall does, “as one who rejects all forms of external government and the State and believes that society and individuals would function well without them” is quite inadequate. Marshall is wrong when he says that “anarchism did not suddenly appear in the nineteenth century only when someone decided to call himself an anarchist”: indeed, Proudhon once declared himself an “anarchist” (he wrote “an-archist”) and the word was later taken up by workers who identified with his thinking. That said, I don’t think it’s the best thing Proudhon did, because using the term “anarchist” to designate a political movement with a constructive project is a bit like shooting yourself in the foot. Gaston Leval said that in his time many young people unfortunately joined the anarchist movement not with reference to its political project but with the idea of “sowing anarchy” in its most vulgar sense.\n\nBefore dealing with the question of Sartre’s hypothetical membership of anarchism, I would like to state what I mean by anarchism. The following is of course a very short summary. Then I’ll try to find out what the anarchism that Remley attributes to Sartre is made of, which amounts in a way to determining what anarchism is for Remley .\n\nFactually, the anarchist movement was born in the mid-19th century from the meeting of different causes:\n\nThe immemorial tendency of humanity to struggle against political oppression and economic exploitation;\n\nThe industrial revolution and the formation of the modern labour movement.\n\nAs a modern political doctrine, anarchism developed from three sources which enriched each other: Proudhon’s critique of French doctrinaire and utopian communism; Bakunin’s critique of German philosophy. But it is above all through the experience of social struggle and class solidarity within the International Worker’s Association that the collectivist or revolutionary socialist movement (which would only later be called “anarchist”) would appear as an organised mass movement.\n\nThe International Workers’ Association\n\nIn 1864, the International Workers’ Association, known as the “First International”, was created in London on the initiative of English trade unionists and French Proudhonian militants.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Marx had no role in its foundation:\n\n“It is not true that the International was the creation of Karl Marx.\n\nHe remained a complete stranger to the preparatory work which took place from 1862 to September 1864. He joined the International at the moment when the initiative of the English and French workers had just created it. Like the cuckoo, he came to lay his egg in a nest that was not his own.”\n\nThis organisation developed progressively and aroused fear within the capitalist class. The states of the European continent exercised an unfailing repression against the workers’ sections of the continent, often sending the troops to shoot at the strikers, as was the case in Belgium against the miners of the Borinage, or in Spain. Far from discouraging the workers, the repression strengthened the International, whose function was above all to organise workers’ solidarity across borders, thanks to relief funds, in particular.\n\nWe cannot yet speak of “anarchism” as a movement, but the ingredients are there: workers must fight for their complete emancipation by organising themselves without any interference from the state and capital. The legacy of Proudhon, who died in 1865, was also there. When Bakunin joined the IWA in 1868, he took up this legacy and radicalised it.\n\nDifferent currents coexisted within the International, but soon an opposition between the supporters of two “projects” became apparent:\n\nThose who wanted to maintain the trade union form in the International, i.e. an organisation which brought workers together on the basis of their role in the production process (Bakunin and his followers - the so-called “collectivists”);\n\nThose who wanted to encourage the working class to seize power through elections and to constitute themselves into national political parties (Marx and his followers).\n\nOne could summarize the situation by saying that there was a split between the supporters of a “counter-society” and the supporters of a “counter-state”.\n\nThe first option consisted in affirming that the International was the exclusive instrument through which the proletariat could overthrow the capitalist system and then organise the emancipated society. This role of organiser was possible thanks to the double structuring of the International Workers’ Association: vertically by the unions implanted in the firms, geographically by the “central sections” locally established.\n\nThe second option implied the transformation of the International Workers’ Association into a political instrument, the seizure of power by elections and its subordination to the party. The idea that the IWA was a political party was so firmly established in the minds of communists after Marx that the Bolshevik historian Iuri Steklov was convinced that the International operated on the principle of democratic centralism!\n\nTo Marx’s centralism, Bakunin and his comrades opposed federalism, i.e. a system of organisation based on both the autonomy of the sections and their coordination - a principle which was applied by the Paris Commune in 1871.\n\nThe conflict between the two currents led to the exclusion of two militants of the Jura Federation, Bakunin and James Guillaume, by a rigged congress held in The Hague in 1872 under the orders of Marx and his entourage. This produced a chain reaction: denunciation of the exclusions by the Jura Federation, then by all the federations of the International. In response, Marx and Engels had the entire organized labour movement of the time excluded from the IWA. This event, through the trauma it caused, was to have a decisive impact on the subsequent orientations of the anarchist movement.\n\nAgain, we cannot yet speak of anarchism, but just as the theoretical ingredients were found in Proudhon, the practical ingredients are found in Bakunin’s descriptions of the workers’ movement of his time.\n\nWhile the “authoritarian” wing of the International immediately collapsed, the excluded federations reconstituted a so-called “anti-authoritarian” IWA, which remained alive for a few years, but which in turn disappeared in 1878. The legacy of this experience was the formation of two currents:\n\n1. A current of “syndicalist” type, which twenty years later became revolutionary syndicalism and later on anarcho-syndicalism;\n\n2. An “anarchist” current properly speaking which will take with time different names: anarchist communist, communist anarchist, libertarian communist.\n\nOn individualism\n\nFrom the readings I have done of Sartre, it never occurred to me that he could have been anything like an anarchist. On the other hand, his thought is very clearly influenced by individualism, an individualism tinged with social preoccupations. The point is that in my opinion the concept of individualistic anarchism is a contradiction in terms. It is customary to regard Stirner as an anarchist, which seems to me quite impossible.\n\nBakunin met Stirner only once, or more precisely they were once in the same room without speaking to each other, during the 1848 revolution, before the former went to try to revolutionise Central Europe and the latter disappeared into oblivion. Bakunin mentions his name only once, in a very negative way, calling him a “nihilist”, which was not at all flattering under his pen. While Stirner was a contemporary of Proudhon, and hated Proudhon, he was never considered an anarchist during his lifetime, because nobody knew him, no one in the anarchist movement had ever thought of claiming Stirner as a reference author.\n\nHe was exhumed forty years later in the 1890s thanks to a total stranger named John Henry Mackay (Prussian despite his name), who somehow “established” Stirner as an anarchist individualist theorist, which in fact he was not - neither anarchist nor individualist. His concern was not with the individual, but with individuality. His book, The Ego and its Own, was written in a language that was difficult to follow because it used the codes of the leftwing Hegelian current of the 1840s and remained difficult to understand if one was not used to his rather abstruse language. At the time of its publication, books that exceeded a certain number of pages were subject to censorship in Prussia, and Stirner’s book passed because the censors didn’t understand it. Stirner came out of oblivion also thanks to Engels, strangely. Engels was determined to make Bakunin a disciple of Stirner in order to discredit the anarchists who persisted in taking part in the international socialist congresses organised by German social democracy. The social-democratic leaders, led by Engels, wanted to expel the anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists who promoted the idea of a general strike. They wanted to avoid at all costs that this idea should spread. Any socialist activist in favour of the general strike was labelled an anarchist, including Rosa Luxembourg, which made her desperate because she hated anarchists.\n\nIn Proudhon and Bakunin there is an extremely elaborate reflection on the individual, on individual freedom, on the individual in society, but it is a reflection linked to their global doctrine: the theory of the individual is for them an element that is integrated into a global reflection. There is no ground for an “individualist anarchism”. For the great thinkers of anarchism, the human being is a social being who can only develop and flourish in society. If this development is hindered by obstacles created by political power or by society, men and women have the possibility and the duty to revolt, but individual revolt is doomed to failure. Some anarchists thought it appropriate to create a separate anarchist-individualism as an exclusive path to emancipation. In reality, the current known as “anarchism-individualism” appeared only recently: it was the result of a series of cascading causes.\n\nWhen Marx and Engels excluded Bakunin and James Guillaume from the First International, followed by the exclusion of practically all the organised labour movement of the time, it created a trauma. The defeat of the federalist current in the International was thus blamed on the very principle of organisation. In reaction to the bureaucratisation and centralisation introduced by Marx, an opposition to all forms of organisation developed. But by advocating maximum decentralisation, federalism, which is the organisational principle of anarchism, was emptied of its content. The “anti-authoritarian” activists withdrew first to the small group of affinities supposed to be the guarantor of the absence of bureaucratisation (of “authority”), then to the individual, after which there was nothing left to decentralise, only the sacralisation of the ego. This is the process, briefly outlined, of the formation of individualism in the anarchist movement, but it is a process that leads to the negation of anarchism.\n\nAnarchism as a doctrine is based on the idea that society pre-exists the individual and that it is society that allows the individual, under certain conditions, to develop and flourish. individualist anarchism, on the other hand, asserts that the individual can only develop against society. Obviously, the same doctrine cannot be based on two antagonistic postulates.\n\nThe sovereignty of the individual?\n\nThis is what Remley writes about Sartre’s view of the sovereignty of the individual:\n\n“All of these essays from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s help to define the parameters of Sartre’s political position, and they give us an insight into his developing anarchistic attitude. In these essays, we see Sartre expressing several aspects that align him more closely to anarchist thought, especially to Proudhon and Bakunin. His concern for the sovereignty of the individual at the expense of state sovereignty, as well as his notion of function, was first enunciated in his ‘Theory of the State in Modern French Thought’. His ‘anarchist attitude’, as Michel Contat so aptly puts it, is readily apparent in his description of the individualistic, stoic ‘solitary man’.” (p. 138)\n\nI am afraid I must contradict Remley. The description of Proudhon or of Bakunin as an “individualistic, stoic ‘solitary man’” does not correspond at all to reality. Bakunin, following Proudhon, never was an individualist and never was solitary. He believed that individualism was the foundation of bourgeois ideology. According to him, man is a product of society: there can be no immutable human nature, an intimate metaphysical being which would in reality be a “Non-being”. As for “loneliness”, he was never lonely, neither concretely nor metaphorically - except, of course, during the eight years he spent isolated and chained in the Peter and Paul fortress for his participation in the German revolution in 1848-1849.\n\nBakunin considers that outside of society, man would not have ceased to be an animal without speech or reason. If the individual can develop today, it is thanks to the cumulative efforts of countless generations. The concepts of individual freedom and reason are the products of society. Society is not simply the product of the individuals who make it up, it is a historical creation. The more developed the individual is, the freer he is, and the more he is the product of society. The more he receives from society, the more he owes it. Created by society, man is also its creator: man’s individual life and his social life cannot be separated.\n\nPursuant to this viewpoint, it does not matter whether individuals really live in isolation or in highly integrated groups; a point completely at odds with Sartre’s position not only in the Critique, but also in all of his philosophical works. This is an ongoing discussion for Sartre and one that underlies the Critique’s foundation: Human history is essentially the story of human development in all its phases, contradictions, ramifications, successes and failures, and Sartre’s unfettered concern is for the human individual, which not only sets him apart from French liberalism and Marxism, but “brings him closer to anarchism”, Remley writes (p.143) The anarchists will not dispute that “Human history is essentially the story of human development in all its phases, contradictions”, etc. but it is wrong to say that their “unfettered concern is for the human individual”. If the “human individual” is far from being indifferent to the anarchists, it is a social individual, integrated in a society, in interaction with it.\n\nResponsibility\n\nTo pose the problem of the individual is also to pose the problem of man’s responsibility in history, the question of historical determinism, and consequently that of human emancipation.\n\nIf the individual, his thoughts, his actions are conditioned by the environment and by education, if, in short, he is entirely a social product, does he cease to be an individual? What then is his degree of independence and responsibility in his actions? There is, says Bakunin, an initial error in the way this problem is posed. It consists in “the absolute sense which our human vanity, supported by a theological and metaphysical aberration, gives to human responsibility. The whole error is in this word: absolute. Man is not absolutely responsible and the animal is not absolutely irresponsible. The responsibility of both is relative to the degree of reflection of which they are capable.”\n\nfreedom is “dominion over external things, founded on the respectful observation of the laws of nature; it is independence from the despotic pretensions and acts of men; it is science, work, political revolt, it is finally the organization, both thoughtful and free, of the social milieu, in accordance with the natural laws that are inherent in every human society.” There lies the responsibility of Man. But, asks Bakunin, “why then do we declare man absolutely responsible”? (a question that he asks by anticipation to Sartre, one could say ...)\n\nProudhon (whose ideas Bakunin is merely developing) and Bakunin are not so much interested in restoring the sovereignty of the individual in relation to that of the state: they know very well that the state will always be the winner until it is brought down. They are especially interested in the question of the independence of the individual from society.\n\nRevolt against society is much more difficult than revolt against the state. What Bakunin calls “social tyranny”, crushing and fatal, does not have the character of imperative violence, of legalized and formal despotism, which distinguishes the authority of the state. It is insidious: “it dominates men by customs, by manners, by the mass of feelings, prejudices and habits”. “It envelops man from birth (...) and forms the very basis of his own individual existence; so that each one is in some way its accomplice against himself.” (Emphasis added.) “It follows that, in order to revolt against this influence which society naturally exerts upon him, man must at least in part revolt against himself.”\n\nThis revolt requires both will and intelligence, and it can be developed through education - or self-education. The habit of thinking and wanting, received from outside through education or experience, can lead to a revolt against social determinisms. It constitutes in the individual an inner force “henceforth identified with his being” and allows him to continue to develop himself through a gymnastics, so to speak, of his thought and will. It is in this sense, says Bakunin, that man can become to a certain extent his own educator, his own instructor, the “producer of himself”.\n\nAccording to Bakunin, man obeys the laws of nature, of which society itself is only a production. Man is a product of the “external world”; he cannot do without it, but at the same time he must preserve himself from it. Each man at his birth and during all his life, is only “the result of an innumerable quantity of actions, of circumstances, and of innumerable conditions, material and social”. Man’s freedom is limited to his ability, “through knowledge and the thoughtful application of the laws of nature”, to free himself from the pressure exerted on him by the external world, “material and social”. “As for the arbitrary yoke of men, he overthrows it by revolutions.”\n\nFor Sartre, the choices we make define our identity. But they also engage the others, which weighs down our responsibility. In other words, Man is responsible for himself, but also for others. In Sartre’s philosophy Man is always free to choose, he cannot not choose: “there is no determinism, Man is free, Man is freedom” (Existentialism is a humanism). Bakunin would undoubtedly understand Sartre’s desire to make man assume his choices, but he was too respectful of the freedom of others to deprive them of the privilege of assuming their own choices. He would also find that there is something absolute, deeply religious in Sartre’s attitude, like Christ taking upon himself all the sins of men.\n\n“What Sartre devoted himself to with astonishing fervour was nothing less than the salvation of man on earth (for there is a Christian - and even an early Christian - in this radical atheist).”\n\nWe are far from Bakunin’s point of view: indeed, if I affirm myself as the product of my childhood, of the social conditions in which I lived, etc. that implies, from the point of view of Sartre, that I deny this fundamental freedom that I have to choose what I am. By saying that my responsibility is relative to the degree of reflection of which I am capable, Bakunin intends to say that the heart of the problem lies in my reflection; and precisely, by my reflection I am capable of revolting against what hinders my freedom. According to Bakunin, revolt is only a stage in the process of development of man’s will to freedom; this process finds its consecration in the consciousness acquired by the exploited class, of the necessity of collective action. What frees man from social determinisms is the use of this “instrument of intellectual emancipation called criticism, without which there can be no complete moral and social revolution”.\n\nFor Sartre, man must assume his choices and actions, without transferring responsibility to others. This is a somewhat proud attitude which forces him to contest any influence of determinism, social or otherwise, since in this case his responsibility would be attenuated. This is what separates Sartre from Bakunin: the former denies social determinisms - which corresponds to a kind of flight - while the latter affirms the necessity to confront them. This confrontation is not limited to the responsibility of the individual: indeed, Bakunin recognises the existence of collective responsibility: each people, he says, is “more or less in solidarity with and responsible for the acts committed by its state, in its name and by its arm, until it has overthrown and destroyed that state.” It is the responsibility of the victim to revolt against his persecutor; it is the responsibility of the exploited to revolt against their exploiters. Without this responsibility, no revolution is possible.\n\nAnarchism according to Sartre\n\nIn his review of Remley’s book , Stephen Hendley writes that Remley’s argument could be that “Sartre’s political philosophy is best thought of as a form of anarchism”. This suggests that regardless of Sartre’s intention, the reader could speculatively approach his work from a libertarian point of view, but this remains an assumption. Hendley adds that “throughout Parts Three and Four [of Remley’s book], there are numerous asides in which Remley draws attention to parallels and affinities [my emphasis] between Sartre’s thought and that of Proudhon (especially) and Bakunin”. Showing parallels and affinities between two works is an analogical method that does not prove any organic relationship between them: Sartre never explicitly quotes neither Proudhon nor Bakunin. Hendley adds that “Some of these [asides] are frustratingly short”, which suggests that there is not much substance to support the argument.\n\nTo emphasize the libertarian character of Sartre’s thought Remley refers to the four conditions defined by John Clark which “provide the ‘boundaries’ of the nature of anarchism”.\n\n“I have endeavoured to show that Sartre meets the full meaning of Clarks’ four-pronged approach to understanding anarchism, and his political philosophy is in a general lineage with Proudhon and Bakunin.” (p. 288)\n\nBut these four conditions, even if they have a sympathetic anti-authoritarian aspect, are very vague and are extremely reductive in defining “the nature of anarchism”. In particular, they don’t mention class struggle, which, in my opinion, is essential. The choosing of John Clark as a reference for the criterion defining anarchism is probably not accidental: although his work is of extreme interest, he is the representative of a “mild” current of anarchism, qualified by some as “reformist”. Most of my anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist comrades (two currents that represent the overwhelming majority of the anarchist movement in France) would consider the conditions put forward by John Clark as necessary, but certainly not sufficient.\n\nSartre’s vision of anarchism is anything but clear. He refers to “traditional anarchism” in the persons of Proudhon and Bakunin but at the same time takes a distance from them because they are “too individualistic” - which they are not. To blame Proudhon and Bakunin for being “individualists” is simply incredible. We have here a very reductive - or caricatured - vision of anarchism whose individualist current has always been extremely marginal compared to the communist (or anarchist-communist) and syndicalist (or anarcho-syndicalist) currents. And individualism is certainly not what defines Proudhon and Bakunin... so we are entitled to ask ourselves what knowledge Sartre really has of anarchism.\n\nAnarchism seen as “individualism”, or as essentially individualistic, is very much in line with most people’s view of the movement, as it has taken hold not only with the uninformed public, but also with most academics including Sartre, so it seems. In The Words, an autobiographical account, Sartre confides: “I was a right-wing anarchist”. In The Wall, Paul Hilbert, the hero of “Erostrate”, declares, “I was an anarchist, I had placed myself in the path of the Tsar and I carried with me an infernal machine.” This is the image of anarchism that Sartre conveyed from 1939 to 1964. One wonders why Sartre’s various visits to Spain, where he could not fail to see the hegemony of anarcho-syndicalism in the labour movement, did not inspire him with more positive characters than a “right-wing anarchist” and a terrorist.\n\nMost academics who insist obsessively on the question of the individual and the opposition to all forms of “authority” tend to obliterate the fact that anarchism advocates the socialisation of the means of production, federalism as the organising principle of society. They forget that Ukrainian anarchists organised an insurrectionary army (“authoritarian”, therefore) which successfully held out for several years against both the White Russians and the Bolsheviks; that during the civil war Spanish anarcho-syndicalists socialised factories and land over half the country before being militarily defeated by both fascism and Stalinism, and that all this was done despite the reluctance of some individualists to “authority”.\n\nThis leads me to believe that Sartre has only an extremely sketchy vision of anarchism, because in the 1970s no French intellectual could ignore the presence in Spain in the 1930s of an anarcho-syndicalist organization with more than one million members.\n\nFor Sartre, “anarchy” is a kind of individualism, which it is not. And when asked “how an anarchist should live today”, he answers “anarchy is for me a moral life” - obviously not a political doctrine -, and he adds in parentheses: “I would add that I have written nothing but moral books” , as if to signify that he has always been anarchist and that anarchism was only a question of morals. While there is no doubt that an anarchist must follow a certain morality, it is equally certain that he or she must fight against the capitalist system, and in an organised way, a point that Sartre seems to ignore.\n\nWondering about the kind of society that could be built without power, Saartre proposes to create communities - it is true that in the 70’s we are at the very heart of the movement. These communities would be “based on love, and not necessarily sexual love: filial love, maternal love, love between comrades. It is in the perspective of love that people’s relationships with each other should be established.” Such communities already exist, in Germany, in France, “where people live, work and make love together”. It is on this basis that an anarchist movement must be created, “in which the relations between power and action will be different from those that exist within the parties. Anarchist action has to conquer not parties but masses.” “It would be necessary to build communities where it would be possible, as far as possible, to live freely, as anarchists would like to live” - communities of 25, 50 people, he says, “who would establish real relationships among themselves, without any authority of one over the other.”\n\nThere is no indication of how Sartrean anarchism envisions the large-scale organization of industrial and agricultural production, transportation, production and distribution of electricity, gas, water, the organisation of a public health system, etc. We only know that it will be necessary “to create possibilities for people to live free with other people, because one cannot live free alone”. All this is not serious.\n\nOne would hardly imagine a “Peace and Love” Jean-Paul Sartre with flowers in his hair. From all that Sartre tells us about anarchism, we can conclude that he has absolutely no idea what it really is. Today he would probably be said to be a “lifestyle anarchist”.\n\nAlfred Betschart considers that Sartre went through several periods, the last of which, following a Marxist period, was from 1972 until his death. It was only during this last period that Sartre freed himself from all obstacles to the constitution of an independent philosophical thought. Being and Nothingness and the Critique would have expressed a methodological conflict between individualism and holism.\n\n“Only in his anarchist period, in which he no longer felt compelled to make concessions to Marxism, did Sartre succeed in further developing his philosophy, which was based primarily on an ontological and epistemological core of psychology and anthropology, into an independent political philosophy. Only now did he manage to separate himself from the elements of a political philosophy that was committed to methodical holism and to build up an independent political philosophy that was consistently based on that methodical individualism that formed the basis of his two main works. At the centre of Sartre’s political philosophy was the question of how people can live freely in groups according to their fundamental choice (also called project). Sartre increasingly saw the state as the main antagonist to such a life in freedom. In doing so, he took a position that he initially coyly described as libertaire and then increasingly uncoded as anarchist.”\n\nIf we follow Alfred Betschart, the fact that Sartre “no longer feels compelled to make concessions to Marxism” implies that at some point he felt compelled to do so. Why on earth did he feel compelled? And the fact that he made concessions to Marxism suggests that he never adhered to it. In other words, for a significant part of his life he lied to himself (and to his readers). And suddenly he frees himself from the weight of “methodical holism” [ methodological holism?] to adhere to “methodical individualism”, which we understand to be the foundation of his anarchism. The problem is that “methodical [methodological] individualism” never founded anarchism.\n\nIf we follow Alfred Betschart, the fact that Sartre “no longer feels compelled to make concessions to Marxism” implies that at some point he felt compelled to do so.

The problem is that “methodical [methodological] individualism” never founded anarchism.\n\nSartre does not seem to have understood that there is no contradiction in anarchism between methodological holism and methodological individualism. One does not have to choose, it is not one or the other:\n\n“Man constitutes himself with respect to himself as an independent and free person only by the degree of consciousness he has of himself, by the development of his thought; but since his thought can only be born and developed in human society, it is obvious that man can only constitute and recognise himself as a free person, within society. It was not, therefore the freedom of men that created society at the beginning of history, but quite the contrary, it was society that successively created the freedom of its members, organically united within it by nature, independently of any contract, of any premeditation and of any will on their part.”\n\nFor anarchist thinkers, human freedom is a product of society.\n\nConvergences\n\nBut in fact, the problem may not be to assert that Sartre was an anarchist strictly speaking, but to find out if his writings, or at least some of them, contain anarchist themes. I have noted certain convergences between Sartre and Bakunin, for example. But these are only convergences, not explicit references from the former to the latter.\n\nWilliam L. Remley’s book, Jean-Paul Sartre’s Anarchist Philosophy, is significant in this respect.\n\nRemley outlines Sartre’s project on page 220: “Sartre’s political philosophy appears to align itself at least with an understanding of anarchism generally. As I have argued, his theoretical anarchism comes into better focus when judged against the anarchists of the nineteenth century, especially Proudhon and Bakunin.” So Remley considers that Sartre’s political philosophy “appears to align itself at least with an understanding of anarchism generally”. [my emphasis] - a very vague formulation that suggests an obscure connection, to say the least. In particular, Sartre’s thought “comes closest to Proudhon whose entire theory of history, with its heavy emphasis on state (as well as religious) hierarchies, only leads to one outcome - oppression - exactly the conclusion Sartre reaches in the Critique.”\n\nI don’t know if there is much sense in detecting a “theory of history” in Proudhon. He was not a system-maker like Marx, he “could not compete with Marx as a founder of a school.” He was content to observe that the realities of an epoch are transitory and can evolve, while opposing the socialists who thought that the advent of an emancipated society would mark the end of history. History is made up of contradictions consisting of a plurality of irreducible elements, antagonistic and at the same time interdependent. These antinomies cannot be resolved in synthesis. There is therefore no end to history: “Terms are balanced either with each other or with other antinomic terms” but “a balance is not a synthesis” (Justice, “The Goods”).\n\nThe resolution of the antinomy is “impossible” because it is from the opposition of antinomic elements, from their mutual confrontation, that movement and life are born. “The problem consists in finding not their fusion - “which would be death - but their equilibrium, an equilibrium that is constantly unstable, variable according to the very development of societies.” (Theory of Property.) The idea behind this theory is that it is the permanent tensions within society that keep it alive, and these tensions will remain after the revolution, even in a noncontradictory way .\n\nAccording to the classical Marxist vision, the vulgar Marxism of the communist party training sessions, the contradiction that divides capitalist society is between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and all other contradictions in society must be subordinated to it: gender, skin colour, religion, sex etc. These are secondary contradictions which will be resolved once the class contradictions have been overcome: “the representatives of the secondary contradictions could bring in their concerns, but that these had to merge with and be subordinated to the main contradiction, as if in a crucible.”\n\nSartre's point of view went beyond this scheme, as it appears in On a raison de se revolter, where the question of feminism and homosexuality are raised. But this is to forget that Sartre was not innovating at all. In 1866 Bakunin affirmed the absolute equality of women's rights: “The woman, different from man, but not inferior to him, intelligent, hard-working and free like him, is the same as man, intelligent, hard-working and free like him, is declared his equal in rights as in all political and social functions and duties.”\n\nFrom the end of the 19th century the libertarian movement advocated for free unions, sex education, feminism and lesbian, gay and bisexual rights. For Emma Goldman, the fight against patriarchy had to be done in the same way as the fight against capitalism and the state. She was the first American to defend homosexual love in the public eye. For her there was no secondary contradiction, a view shared by most anarchists. .\n\nContrary to what Remley seems to think, Proudhon does not focus exclusively on the state (and religious) hierarchy leading to oppression. Some authors have suggested a curious division of labour between anarchism and Marxism, the former supposedly devoted to denouncing oppression and the latter to denouncing exploitation. Nothing could be further from the truth. If Proudhon wrote the System of Economic Contradictions, it was because he was aware that the capitalist regime was a regime of exploitation. He also wrote a Handbook of the Stock Exchange Speculator, which is a remarkable analysis of financial capitalism of the time. Moreover, it is often overlooked that Proudhon was far from ignorant in economic matters as he was an excellent accountant. “The exploitation of man by man, the government of man by man, under whatever name it is disguised, is oppression”, he writes in the First Memorandum on Property, and many other such quotations can be found throughout his works. Proudhon's anarchism is based on three pillars which he says are inseparable: the condemnation of the economic exploitation of the proletariat, of political oppression, to which he adds religious alienation in equal measure.\n\nAs for Bakunin, his “critique of science probably binds him to Sartre in a concrete manner.” I fear that Remley has a mistaken view of what Bakunin thought about science. He had nothing against science per se; he was, however, a strong critic of the power that scientists could hold. In The Knuto-Germanic Empire he writes thus:\n\n“A scientific body entrusted with the government of society would soon end up not dealing with science at all, but with an entirely different business; and this business, the business of all established powers, would be to perpetuate itself by making the society entrusted to its care ever more stupid and consequently more needy of its government and direction. (...)\n\n“What I preach, then, is, to a certain extent, the revolt of life against science, or rather against the government of science. Not to destroy science - God forbid! That would be a crime of lese humanite - but to put it back in its place, so that it can never leave it.”\n\nBakunin adds that “the government of the scientists would have as its first consequence to make science inaccessible to the people and would necessarily be an aristocratic government, because the present institution of science is an aristocratic institution. The aristocracy of intelligence!”\n\nDespite his observation that Sartre’s readers have little interest in his “selfproclamations” of anarchism, Remley intends to “shed a different light on an important aspect of Sartre’s politics”, namely “to view his political philosophy through the lens of anarchism” (p. 288)\n\nRemley proceeds by analogy. If, for example, I were studying Marx’s views on Bakunin, I would examine the texts in which the former expresses an opinion on the latter, or on anarchism in general, I would mention the passages where Marx quotes Bakunin or any other anarchist, and analyse the relevance of his remarks. There is no such thing with Sartre and anarchism. Remley mentions no passage where Sartre expresses an opinion on Bakunin or Proudhon. The only thing Remley clings to are passages in Sartre’s work that might be similar to what Proudhon or Bakunin said. Something like: “such a passage of Sartre’s fits well into the framework of anarchist thought”. Remley’s book is entirely constructed in this mode.\n\nRemley seeks “convergences” between Proudhon and Bakunin on the one hand, and Sartre on the other, in order to “solidify his anarchist credentials”. Let us examine some of these convergences.\n\nIf he evokes the point of view of Bakunin or Proudhon on a point, he adds that it is “also the position Sartre adopts”. (p. 13)\n\nSpeaking of the notion of “groups”, he says that it is “at the very heart of Sartre’s Critique, and is a fundamental aspect of anarchists political thought”. (p. 126)\n\nOn another question, “Sartre aligns himself more with anarchist thought as opposed to Marx”. (p. 126)\n\n“The revolutionary Sartre describes sees human relations from the viewpoint of work, a concept espoused by Proudhon in his anarchist humanism”. (p. 128)\n\nPraxis and action “share a significant role in the “ Critique ”, and each is a component of anarchist thinking”. (p. 129)\n\nSuch other aspect of Sartre’s critique of authority “comes within the meaning of anarchism”.(p. 131)\n\nSuch point Sartre develops is “an essential element of anarchism.” (p. 147)\n\n“Sartre is no different than the anarchists” (p. 134)\n\nAnd this other point of view is “very much in tune with anarchist thought.” (p. 173)\n\n“mirrors anarchist positions we discussed previously” (p. 177)\n\n“not unlike Proudhon and the other anarchists before him” (p. 183)\n\nSpeaking of the critique of institutions in society, Remley tells us that it is “all within the concept of anarchism.” (p. 197)\n\nRemley tells us that “Proudhon and Bakunin viewed their political positions as radical and essentially socialistic, which is also the position Sartre adopts.” (p. 13) This is quite correct, but exactly the same could be said of Marx and Engels. So it is not on the question of socialism that Sartre could be defined as “anarchist”.\n\nThe anarchists say that transforming society can only be the result of a common will, a common action. As Remley says: “individuals acting alone or as atomized organisms [...] are incapable of revolutionary activity”. (p. 126) But this observation is by no means limited to anarchism, it cannot be limited to a “fundamental aspect of anarchists political thought” (p. 126). It fits perfectly well with Marxism also.\n\n“Most anarchists, says Remley, including Proudhon and Bakunin, elevate the peasants to the level of true revolutionary, a position Sartre obviously agrees with.” I fear that Remley (and Sartre before him) has a distorted view of how Proudhon and Bakunin saw “the relationship of the proletariat to the peasantry - a view formed through the prism of Marx and Engels, as is the case for many academics.\n\nIt is true that the anarchists do not have the contempt shown by Marx and Engels and the Marxists as a whole towards the peasantry. But for the anarchists, the problem is not to “elevate the peasants to the level of true revolutionary”. The integration of the peasants into a revolutionary movement is a question of circumstances. In Ukraine, Makhno’s insurrectionary army was composed essentially of peasants and its programme consisted in inciting the peasants to socialise the land, which they actually did, but which the Bolsheviks totally failed to do! In Spain too, in areas where the anarchist movement was dominant, there was a huge movement to socialise the land. It can be said that the anarchists were the only ones who succeeded in such a project. But in both cases, this socialisation of land was only possible because the peasants realised that their situation would improve.\n\nIt is not true that Proudhon and Bakunin “elevate the peasants to the level of true revolutionary”: the peasants may in certain circumstances become actors in the revolution, but the working class remains the driving element.\n\nAccording to Marx’s view, Proudhon is the theorist of the petty bourgeoisie and the peasantry. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is true that for a while he envisaged an alliance between the working class and the petty bourgeoisie in the process of proletarianisation, but the idea passed him by. As for the peasantry, he simply noted that at his time 85% of the French population was rural, that it was difficult to talk to them about collectivisation of the land, and that you can’t make a revolution against the peasantry.\n\nContrary to Remley’s view, Proudhon despaired of the peasants’ attitude towards property - and therefore to revolution. The population’s attachment to property, including the working class, was so deeply rooted (and still is...) that it is necessary to find transitional measures to overcome this bias. The issue of ownership is in fact a false problem. If we look at things closely, it will be seen that Proudhon’s constant preoccupation has been to seek the best strategy to convince the population, and particularly the peasants, to accept the idea that production, society in general, should be organised in a non-state socialised manner. All of Proudhon’s variations on this theme are merely a reflection of his wanderings in search of a good solution.\n\nBakunin didn’t think otherwise.\n\nConcerning the Russian peasantry, Bakunin certainly has glorified its regular revolts against oppression, but he considered that its traditional institutions, such as the mir, did not constitute an element on which the revolution could be based: The mir has never had any internal evolution, he says, the only process which emerged from it was disintegration. Sensing the development of a new class of kulaks, he writes that “every muzhik who is a little well-to-do and a little stronger than the others is now striving with all his energy to free himself from the rural community that oppresses and suffocates him”. “Apathy” and “improductivity”, Bakunin says again, are the two main characteristics of the Russian rural community.\n\nBakunin’s reflections during the Franco-Prussian war (1870-1871) are particularly interesting. When he tackles the crucial question of the collectivisation of land, Bakunin affirms that imposing this would be a mistake, because it would lead to an uprising in the countryside. To reduce the uprising, it would be necessary to have an immense armed force, with military discipline, with generals, and the whole machine would have to be rebuilt, with the machinist, the dictator. We have in mind the problem of the relationship between workers and peasants during the Russian revolution, the requisitions which exacerbated the antagonisms between town and country and which led to forced collectivisation.\n\nAccording to Bakunin, collectivism in the countryside can only come about by force of circumstance, when the “conditions of privileged individualism, the political and legal institutions of the state, have disappeared of their own accord” - in other words a transition. The claim of the working class to impose a policy on the peasantry is a “political legacy of bourgeois revolutionaryism”. It inevitably leads to the reconstitution of a system of domination, this time based on the bureaucracy - the “state functionaries” - charged with the practical execution of this programme, thereby dispossessing the working class of all power. Here again we come back to the idea that the advent of the state bureaucracy is the price to pay for the failure of the proletarian revolution .\n\nI don’t know what “to see human relations from the point of view of work” means really. According to Proudhon, Labour is the source of the value of products; but there is also, beyond the simple hardship of work, a social servitude linked to work, which is a product of the relations between workers and employers. For human beings, work is above all a social institution and not a natural fact. But it is also a natural constraint that is aggravated by the servile social organisation. But all this also corresponds to the Marxist point of view, this observation is not specifically anarchist.\n\nViolence and action “share a significant role in the Critique, and each is an element of anarchist thinking” (p. 129) But violence and action play an important role in Marxism too. Proudhon had been traumatised by the bloody repression of the revolution in 1848 and had hoped for a peaceful transition to socialism. But he was not naive: if no solution is found, he wrote, “it will no longer be the right to work, nor the right to surplus value that the peasants and workers will invoke: it will be the right to war and reprisals .” The threat is clear. Violence is not desired, but it will be used if necessary.\n\nBakunin does not see things very differently. Contrary to popular belief, this man, who is generally presented as a furious revolutionary rushing to the first barricade within reach, was very cautious. He was, let us remember, a former artillery officer. He participated in four insurrections, in Paris and Prague in 1848, Dresden in 1849 and Lyon in 1870 . On each occasion he had made a pessimistic prognosis of their outcome and had tried to dissuade the protagonists from embarking on the adventure, but having failed to do so, he had nevertheless participated in the movement.\n\nOn Dresden and Lyon there are the testimonies of Engels and Wagner. When the Dresden uprising was defeated, he organised a strategic retreat that was a model of its kind. In the military “art”, a strategic retreat is the removal of a maximum number of men and material from a battlefield, in good order, with a minimum of casualties. Bakunin’s skill was recognised by Engels, himself a military enthusiast:\n\n“In Dresden, the struggle was kept on for four days in the “ “streets of the town. The shopkeepers of Dresden, the ‘communal guard,’ not only did not fight, but in many instances favoured the proceedings of the troops against the insurgents. These again consisted almost exclusively of working men from the surrounding manufacturing districts. They found an able and coolheaded commander in the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin, who afterwards was taken prisoner, and now is confined in the dungeons of Munkacs, Hungary. The intervention of numerous Prussian troops crushed this insurrection.”\n\nRichard Wagner evoked “the happy retreat from Dresden, which was made without any loss”. The Russian had had the trees of the Maximilian Alley cut down in order to “guarantee his left flank from an attack by the Prussian cavalry”, says Wagner, who adds that the lamentations of the inhabitants of the promenade had greatly amused Bakunin: “The tears of the Philistines are the nectar of the Gods”, the revolutionary had then declared.\n\nBakunin’s participation in the Lyon Commune in 1870, which Marx tried to ridicule from his seat in the British Museum, also earned the Russian revolutionary a laudatory appraisal from the Bolshevik historian Yuri Steklov. Steklov states that Bakunin’s intervention in Lyon was “a generous attempt to awaken the sleeping energy of the French proletariat and to direct it towards the struggle against the capitalist system and at the same time to repel the foreign invasion”. Steklov adds that Bakunin’s plan was not so ridiculous:\n\n“In Bakunin’s thinking, it was necessary to take advantage of the shocks caused by the war, of the incapacity of the bourgeoisie, of the patriotic protests of the masses, of their confused social tendencies, to attempt a decisive intervention of the workers in the great centres, to draw the peasantry behind it and thus begin the world social revolution. No one then proposed a better plan.”\n\nIf Proudhon was very reserved on the use of violence, the image of a pandestroyer usually conveyed concerning Bakunin is very far from corresponding to the real character. He had warned his friends against unwise decisions: “it is not necessary that the revolution should disgrace itself by a senseless movement and that the idea of a revolutionary uprising should fall into ridicule.” And when the Russian revolutionary states that “no one can want to destroy unless having at the least a distant vision, true or false, of the order of things that should to him follow that which currently exists” , he stood in contrast to Marx who opposed all anticipation concerning the post-revolutionary society in the name of so-called “scientific” socialism, and who did not want to propose “the recipes for the casseroles of the future society”\n\n“Self-proclaimed anarchist”\n\nAnother point that I think needs to be raised about the possibility of labelling Sartre an anarchist is whether his self-proclamations as an anarchist should be taken seriously.\n\nRemley tells us that “throughout his life Sartre often referred to himself as an anarchist”, but he seems surprised that “despite his self-proclamation, very few were interested”. One may well wonder why. Maybe people simply didn’t take his self-proclamations seriously. Indeed, the question is rather to know how seriously one can take the anarchist proclamations of an author whose written work contains nothing tangible to corroborate these proclamations - except a few occasional oral declarations - but whose action has shown that he systematically sided with communist organizations, first orthodox, then Marxist- Leninist, all fierce enemies of anarchism.\n\nAlfred Betschart writes in “Sartre’s anarchist political philosophy - a draft for a diverse society?”:\n\n“In a discussion between him, Benny Levy alias Pierre Victor and Philippe Gavi, which was published two years later under the title ‘On a reason de se revolter’, Sartre said that he considered himself a member of the antihierarchical-libertarian movement.”\n\nSo let’s look closer at what Sartre is actually saying in “On a reason de se revolter” (We are right to revolt). The interview published under this title was mainly with Pierre Victor (Benny Levy), a leader of a Maoist organisation, “La Gauche proletarienne” [Proletarian Left], which defined itself as antiauthoritarian, spontaneist and which many observers said adopted “libertarian” behaviour. It is true that at the time, just after May ‘68, the term “libertarian” was used for anything that challenged authority and hierarchy in any way. In the interview, the term “libertarian” is almost systematically associated with the term “anti-hierarchy” (pages 26, 63, 77, 78, 100, 188). Thus Sartre writes:\n\n“In the aftermath of the Liberation [from the German occupation], the P.C. [Communist Party] changed its attitude towards me completely” ... “For my part, I had become a convinced socialist, but anti-hierarchical - and libertarian - that is to say, for direct democracy. I was well aware that my aims were not those of the PC, but I thought we could have gone some way together. I was deeply disconcerted by this sudden break.”\n\nIt should be pointed out that anti-hierarchy and direct democracy are by far not enough to define anarchism. The very Maoist Proletarian Left also proclaimed itself to be against hierarchy and in favour of direct democracy (though probably not within the organisation). In fact, fifty pages later, Sartre explains why he joined the Maoists (not the anarchists). In this he contrasts with Daniel Guerin who, speaking of Sartre, wrote: “I am among those who have not always approved of Sartre’s incursions into politics, and while I believe myself to be a leftist, I do not intend to serve as a paravent to the Maoists (quite simply because I am a libertarian communist)”.\n\nTo Victor’s question (Victor was a Maoist leader): “You once said something that troubled me: that Revolution was possible, but that a slightly less ignoble society would probably emerge from it”, he replies:\n\n“What I wanted to say now are the objective reasons why I go with the Maoists. I’m with you: that doesn’t mean I agree with everything you do. It’s your conception of direct democracy that seems to me to be the essential link between you and me. Because, in the end, it is to establish this democracy that a writer who understands something of the meaning of his profession must strive.” (p. 75)\n\nSo Sartre claims to be a “libertarian”, but instead of turning to the anarchists, he turns to the Marxist-Leninists. And he explains that the role of the writer is to “write for everyone”: one must write for a “collective reader”, which “is only possible in a socialist democracy”, “in a direct democracy” - to which he concludes: “It is perhaps in China that it has the best chance of existing one day.” One may conclude that Communist China was the model of antiauthoritarian and dare I say it, “libertarian” direct democracy... The least one could say is that there is a certain confusion and a great deal of naivety in Sartre’s mind...\n\nAddressing Victor, Sartre lists the points he shares with him: “You only use legality to piss off the bourgeoisie”. “There is also, with you, the tendency - which I approve of - to give yourselves (...) unstable institutions, that is to say, institutions which include in themselves the possibility of being dissolved, when the situation changes.”\n\nBut the aim of anarchism has never been to give itself unstable institutions, despite the opposition of the state. Sartre concludes his list of points of satisfaction by saying: “I am happy with your relations with me.” By this he means that he appreciates that the Maoists consult him when they want to undertake an action: “you take great care to always ask me, before involving me in an action, if I agree with it...” (...) “For these actions, I am happy to be consulted by you.” (...) “For these various reasons, I believe I see in you, and not only in you but in the anti-hierarchical and libertarian movement, the announcement of a new politics, and the roots of the new men who will make it.” (p. 77)\n\nI would add that at the same time, in the mid-1970s, I and some comrades were discussing with Marxist-Leninists militants who told us, without laughing, that when the revolution broke out, we anarchists would be the first to be shot. (Probably with anti-authoritarian bullets and anti-hierarchical guns.)\n\nCommenting on his political itinerary, Sartre writes:\n\n“Before May ‘68, in France, there was another left, born in part from the JC [Jeunesses communistes — Communist Youth], with which I had already done some work. There were two attitudes in it: the Mao attitude, and the Italian attitude. For my part, I didn’t bother to choose between the two. Since they both were against the P.C.F. [French Communist Party], I naively thought that they could be brought together. The pro-Italianism disappeared, by inefficiency. It is the other one that has triumphed. But, at the beginning, my friendship for the Italians troubled me. And then, I had known the attitude of the Maoists through the Base Committees. These were committees that wanted to help Vietnam.\n\nI was connected with some of them, Puig [Puig Antich] was one of them. At the time, they represented for me the first appearance of the anti-hierarchical and libertarian movement that was to break out in May.” [My emphasis.]\n\nSalvador Puig Antich was a Catalan libertarian member of the MIL (Movimiento Iberico de Liberacion) who was executed by Franco in 1974. By saying that he was in contact with Puig Antich, who represented the “anti- hierarchical libertarian movement”, Sartre is only making an observation; he is absolutely not saying that he adheres to it.\n\nSartre knows that he will not see the revolution, that he will at best only see the beginning of it. He comments:\n\n“It is enough that I ally myself with you [the Maoists] to do as well as possible the part of the trip that falls to me. In another sense, it is my business to know what to expect from an action, since we are acting together. From this point of view, I don’t think that the meeting with the Maos changed me much. What has changed me, on the other hand, is what I see reappearing under new aspects: old things that I believed in as a teenager - moralism, for example - that I renounced in the name of realism when I began to work a little with the communists, and which I now find again in the anti-hierarchical and libertarian movement.” (p. 78)\n\nWe understand that the “anti-hierarchical and libertarian movement” is a ready-made formula designating a shapeless aggregate of protesters against the established order which has not much to do with anarchism.\n\nOn page 100 of the debate, Sartre returns to the Critique of Dialectical Reason, of which he says it was above all a challenge which said: “incorporate me into Marxism, and there will be a first beginning of an attempt to fill the original void of Marxism”. This clearly shows that he places himself in a perspective of revision of Marxism. To accomplish this goal, Sartre believed he “discovered the possibility in the works of Mao: not in the Little Red Book, but in the complete works.” This is a far cry from anarchism.\n\nSartre contrasts the method of Soviet Marxism, based on determinism, with that of Mao, which would be “dialectical”. If you believe in determinism, he says, “you have no way of explaining the anti-hierarchical and libertarian current that we have observed in various sectors of the French population.” (p. 100) If you are a determinist, you have no reason to claim freedom, he adds: you are necessarily conditioned. Clearly Sartre is unaware that this question was raised by Bakunin a hundred years earlier.\n\nFor the Russian revolutionary, freedom and determinism are not opposed: “freedom is the knowledge of necessity, says Bakunin” . freedom and Will can only be understood within the limits of nature and its laws:\n\n“Man’s freedom consists solely in this, that he obeys natural laws because he has recognised them as such himself, and not because they have been externally imposed on him by any foreign will, divine or human, collective or individual.”\n\nNeither Proudhon nor Bakunin evacuate a reflection on the individual: but it is a reflection which situates it in society. This society can be oppressive and the individual can then legitimately determine his methods of resistance. Bakunin says that it is much more difficult to resist society than to resist the state. Proudhon and Bakunin say that society is a condition of freedom - a freedom that must certainly be conquered. For Bakunin, freedom is the consciousness of necessity; Hegel says that “freedom has necessity as its presupposition”. With Bakunin, we always come back to Hegel.\n\nTo evaluate Sartre’s presumed anarchism, we would have to note all the passages in which he evokes it (under the heading of “libertarian”) and then synthesise them - a very tedious task. Let us content ourselves with “On a raison de se revolter”: towards the end of the text, Victor asks him if there is not “a danger in confusing under the same word ‘liberty’, the utopian notion of liberty linked to revolt, and then another notion which, in turn, refers to power and to power such as it is in oppressive societies”. (p. 352) Sartre replies:\n\n“I think that the two notions cannot be confused. There is the libertarian movement which manifests itself in revolt and then what it leads to, which is precisely the new form of power envisaged; it is only today that we can conceive of a new form of power which would really be freedom.”\n\nSo the libertarian movement is essentially defined by revolt, not revolution, and this revolt leads to a new form of power.\n\nIn “On a raison de se revolter”, the word “libertarian” is almost systematically associated, like a litany, with “anti-hierarchy” without any precision ever being given on the political content of this current. We remain in the most complete obscurity. On the other hand, we find many passages where Sartre clearly displays his closeness to Maoism, to the point of declaring himself “very happy” with it.\n\nWe have some reasons to conclude that his inclination is unambiguously towards Maoism, not anarchism.\n\nAbout dialectics\n\nIn the anarchist movement, the Critique of Dialectical Reason, published in 1960, is clearly a promotion of Marxist ideas, and this is how Sartre and most people saw it: it is nothing but a Marxist critique of soviet Marxism. The Critique, Sartre said in 1975, “is a work written against the communists, while being Marxist.” “It is not a question of rejecting Marxism in the name of a third way or an idealist humanism, but of reclaiming man within Marxism”, writes Sartre in “Questions of Method”, in the introduction to the Critique of Dialectical Reason. The reader of the Critique sees in it nothing more than a questioning of the relationship between Sartre and Marxism. So why question what Sartre himself says?\n\n“Before 1968, the communist movement represented, it seemed, the whole of the left, so that breaking with the Party created a kind of exile. When you were cut off from that left, you either went to the right, as those who went to the socialists did, or you remained in a kind of waiting game, and the only thing left to do was to try to think to the end what the communists refused to let us think.\n\n“Writing the Critique of Dialectical Reason was for me a way of settling accounts with my own thinking outside the action on thinking exercised by the Communist Party. The Critique is a work written against the communists, while being Marxist. I considered that true Marxism was completely twisted, distorted by the communists.”\n\n“My criticisms are not directed at [Marx] but at the Marxist scholasticism of 1949. Or, if you like, at Marx, through Stalinist neo-Marxism” says Sartre again. Finally, when Sartre writes in his Critique of Dialectical Reason: “Everything we have established in ‘Questions of Method’ derives from our agreement in principle with historical materialism”, it is hard to doubt his (albeit critical) adherence to Marxism.\n\nThere is a certain contradiction in claiming that the Critique of Dialectical Reason is an anarchist work, or one with an anarchist flavour, even though its author clearly declares himself a Marxist. It is not surprising, therefore, that anarchists did not show enthusiasm for Sartre’s book: because of their distrust of dialectics, they did not embrace Sartre’s project, expressed in Materialism and Revolution and continued in Critique of Dialectical Reason, to remedy the sclerosis of Marxism. As Bertell Ollman says, “dialectics as such explains nothing, proves nothing, predicts nothing and is the cause of nothing.” Anarchists were not enthusiastic about revising Marxism,\n\nCritique of Dialectical Reason contains, as a preface, an article published in 1957, entitled “Questions de methode” (Questions of Method), originally intended for a Polish journal, in which he affirms his Marxism - one can easily imagine that at that time a Polish journal would never have published an article showing even a hint of sympathy for anarchism. Significantly, the original title of “Questions of Method” was “Marxism and Existentialism”.\n\nIn this article, Sartre considers that historical materialism provides the only relevant interpretation of history, but that existentialism represents the only concrete approach to reality. This is a major contradiction, due to the fact that, according to Sartre, “Marxism has stopped” (Critique of Dialectical Reason).\n\nVincent Charbonnier comments on this “stoppage” of Marxism:\n\n“As a consequent Marxist, Sartre insists on the historical and historically determined character of the sclerosis of Marxism, which, he specifies, does not correspond ‘to a normal ageing’ and is ‘produced by a particular type of world situation’ which does not exhaust it.\n\n“This sclerosis results in particular from the fact that the ‘war of position(s)’, which followed the ebb of the revolutionary wave in Europe from the mid-1920s onwards, concomitantly with the end of counter-revolution in the USSR, was crystallised in the practical slogan of ‘building socialism in one country’ and, on the theoretical level, by the codification of a doctrine, the Dia-Mat, unifying nature and history with a series of ‘dialectical laws’.\n\n“Marxism came to a halt precisely because this philosophy ‘wants to change the world’, because it ‘is and wants to be practical’, but a real split took place within it, between theory on one side and praxis on the other. Its most disastrous consequence lies in the transformation of the latter into ‘empiricism without principles’ and of the former into ‘pure and fixed knowledge’: the ‘open’ concepts of Marxism have become ‘closed’ and ‘are no longer keys, interpretative schemes’ but are posited ‘for themselves as already totalised knowledge’.”\n\nBut it is not a question for Sartre of fundamentally questioning Marxism: the responsibility for this sclerosis lies with the Soviet regime and with some Marxist intellectuals (Engels, Lukacs , Roger Garaudy [another “crapule stalinienne” who ended up as a negationist]), who tend to take the results of Marxism for truths. Engels imagines that there is a “dialectic of nature” which Sartre finds aberrant. Sartre criticised Engels for not starting with nature in order to discover a possible “dialectic” but for starting with presuppositions in the belief that he would discover a “dialectic” in nature. On this point anarchists are in complete agreement with Sartre, but this does not make him an anarchist.\n\nIn his conclusion to “Questions of Method”, Sartre clearly formulates that existentialism “does not question anything, except a mechanistic determinism which is precisely not Marxist and which has been introduced from outside into this total philosophy.” Here again, anarchists would totally agree with him.\n\nBakunin had expressed the same reservations about Marx’s theory of history, without ever questioning the materialist conception: he simply criticised the mechanistic character of this conception. Unfortunately, he based his opinion on what he could have known about Marx’s thought during his lifetime, most of whose writings were not published. In reality Marx agreed with him. An anecdote illustrates this perfectly.\n\nThe Marxism to which many of Marx’s readers clung like a lifeline was a caricature of Marxism, a Reader’s Digest Marxism. His son-in-law, Lafargue, had written a book, Karl Marx’s Economic determinism, in which one finds statements such as: “Morality, as well as the other phenomena of human activity, falls under the law of economic determinism formulated by Marx”, etc. It was in connection with this book that Marx said, “If this is Marxism, I, Karl Marx, am not a Marxist.”\n\nThis anecdote was echoed twenty years later by Engels, who complained about people who read his friend’s work superficially: “What is called ‘Marxism’ in France is certainly a very special article, so much so that Marx said to Lafargue: ’What is certain is that I am not a Marxist’”.\n\nThe meaning of Marx’s sentence has often been distorted. It has been said that he did not want to give credence to the idea that he was a dogmatist or sectarian. This is not exactly the case: he wanted to distance himself from interpretations that reduced his thought to a kind of well-oiled machine. Marx did not say that he was not a “Marxist”, he said that the mechanistic Marxism popularised during his lifetime was not Marxism. This is not the same thing... In fact, Marxism had “stopped’ long before Sartre had noticed it.\n\nAlready in Being and Nothingness, Sartre’s individual is a social being, but limited to interpersonal relations. In Critique of the dialectical reason he goes further: groups, classes, organizations, institutions, and the rest of what we might call “society” are the main concerns of the text. Does this make Sartre more in line with the thinking of Proudhon, Bakunin and other anarchists? In my opinion, the fact that Sartre wants to situate man in his social environment - his class - and in the conflicts generated by the mode of production and the relations of production places him both within the framework of Marxism and anarchism. It places him within the framework of socialism, generically speaking.\n\nConvergences between Sartre’s thought and anarchism can also be found on their opposition to “dialectical materialism” - a concept totally rejected by anarchism : The concept of “dialectical materialism” has no more sense than “dialectical spiritualism”. As for “historical materialism”, it is worth pointing out that Marx never uses this expression. There is thus within the Marxist current a kind of obsessive fixation on this term which ends up paralysing all critical reflection . Marx advocates a “materialist conception of history”, which anarchists advocate just as well, an expression which in no way contradicts anarchist thought, subject to certain reservations formulated by Bakunin, with which Marx and Engels would eventually agree.\n\nThe fetishism of the “dialectic” is absent in Marx. In fact, when we reduce to the essentials the whole post-Marxist rigmarole on the question, the term “dialectic” is used simply to designate a process which evolves and transforms, or phenomena which interact. And they add “materialist” to make it sound more “scientific”.\n\nHenri Lefebvre writes that “In the 1844 Manuscript, the German Ideology and all the other writings of this period, Hegel’s Logic is treated with the utmost contempt. Marx and Engels are unsparing in their attacks on this ‘esoteric history of the abstract mind’, alien to living men, whose elect is the philosopher and whose organ is philosophy.” The Poverty of Philosophy is full of passages hostile towards Hegel’s method, but in actual fact it is not Hegel that Marx is attacking but Proudhon. In 1846, Proudhon published his System of Economic Contradictions, the subtitle of which was “Philosophy of Misery”. When he undertook this work, Proudhon was faced with a problem: how to explain the mechanisms of the capitalist system. Naturally, he began by attempting a historical method, but this was not appropriate: to make a chronology is not to expose a mode of operation. So he began to use categories whose logical series would constitute a “scaffolding”, in his own words - today we would say he made a simulation of the system. He began with what he considered the fundamental category, value, and then, by a kind of deduction, he worked out the chain of categories which constitute the capitalist system: the division of labour, machinismo, competition, monopoly, etc. At that time, Marx was aiming at the same project, but, insisting on using a historical method, he found himself in a dead end and was somewhat incensed that Proudhon had anticipated him.\n\nMarx then made a misunderstanding: obviously unable to recognise the interest of Proudhon's work, he had persuaded himself that Proudhon had resorted to Hegelian dialectics, which he therefore began to attack furiously. He accused Proudhon of crimes of which he was perfectly innocent. In fact, Proudhon's originality had consisted in applying the experimental method to political economy, and not at all in any “dialectical” method.\n\nIt is interesting to see how Lefebvre will transform the use of the experimental method - a perfectly scientific method - into a “dialectical” muddle. He writes that at the time of publication of The Poverty of Philosophy, “dialectical materialism did not exist, one of its essential elements, the dialectic, having been explicitly rejected.” Marx will waste years trying to find a way to expose the mechanisms of the capitalist system, without success. It was at that point that he wrote to Engels on 14 January 1858 that he had finally found the right method:\n\n“I have been greatly helped in working out my method because, purely by chance (Freiligrath found some volumes of Hegel which had belonged to Bakunin and sent them to me as a present) I have been browsing through Hegel's Logic again. When the time comes to resume this sort of work, I shall very much want to publish two or three papers which will render the rational element of the method which Hegel both discovered and turned into a mystery accessible to common sense.”\n\nLefebvre comments: “From this correspondence it follows that the dialectical method was rediscovered and rehabilitated by Marx at the time when he was beginning work on the Critique of Political Economy and Capital. In fact, in the 1873 afterword to Capital Marx explains in detail the method he employs, and what he explains is exactly what he had furiously criticised in Proudhon twenty-seven years earlier - without ever mentioning Proudhon, naturally.\n\nHenri Lefebvre, like all Marxist authors, presents Capital as a production of dialectical materialism, whereas it is a scientific work in which the experimental method is applied!\n\nMarx had sent Bakunin a copy of Book I of Capital. Here is the Russian revolutionary's account of it:\n\n“This work should have been translated into French long ago, for none, as far as I know, contains such a profound, such a luminous, such a scientific, such a decisive, and, if I may say so, such a mercilessly unmasking analysis of the formation of bourgeois capital and of the systematic and cruel exploitation which capital continues to exert on the labour of the proletariat. The only fault of this work, perfectly positivist, notwithstanding La Liberte of Brussels, - positivist in the sense that, based on a thorough study of economic facts, it admits of no other logic than the logic of facts - its only fault, I say, is to have been written, in part, but only in part, in a style that is too metaphysical and abstract, which has undoubtedly misled La Liberte of Brussels, and which makes it difficult to read and almost unapproachable for the majority of workers. And it is the workers in particular who should read it, however. The bourgeois will never read it, or if they do, they will not want to understand it, and if they do understand it, they will never speak of it; this work being nothing other than a death sentence, scientifically motivated and irrevocably pronounced, not against them as individuals, but against their class.”\n\nSo Capital is, according to Bakunin, the death sentence of the bourgeoisie, “scientifically motivated”.\n\nIndeed, it should be remembered that the term “scientific socialism” was first used by Proudhon in 1840 in his First Memoir on Property [What is Property?]. It is not certain that Marx first used the expression in the same sense. Indeed, at the same time, the word “science” was being used again and again in German universities. Didn’t the philosopher Hegel write the Science of Logic? But in German universities the word “science” did not have the same meaning as it has today. Thus, at the end of his first year of law school , Marx wrote to his father about a philosophy of law that he had attempted: “...I was able to realise, once again, that I would not get by without philosophy. I could therefore throw myself into the arms of this science in complete peace, and I wrote a new fundamental metaphysical system”. This is not a misuse of the word by Marx. In another passage of the quoted letter he says: “What drives Democritus away is on the one hand the desire to learn, which leaves him neither cease nor desist, and on the other hand the fact that he does not find satisfaction in true, i.e. philosophical, science.” So true science is philosophy. Conversely, when the young Marx wants to designate science, in the sense that we understand it today, he uses another expression: We thus learn that, since philosophy did not satisfy Democritus, he “threw himself into the arms of positive knowledge\n\nThese details no doubt shed new light on the notion of “scientific socialism” employed by Marx and Engels. It is a notion directly inherited from German philosophy, and not from scientific conceptions understood in the sense of “positive knowledge”. The “scientific socialism” of Marx and Engels is the application, to the study of the social sphere, of philosophical methods much more than a scientific approach in the sense that it can have today. Thus, when Marx or Engels criticise a book on economics, they give a disproportionate place to the criticism of the author’s philosophy (Duhring or Proudhon). This is because if there is a flaw in the philosophical system (and one always finds one, if one looks hard enough) the work is no longer “scientific”.\n\nIn general, Marx’s scientific knowledge was highly questionable. In describing the evils of excessive labour, he explains in Capital (i.e. in 1867) that continuous and uniform labour weakens the momentum and “tension of animal spirits” (die Spann und Schwungkraft der Lebensgeister). To speak of “animal spirits” in 1867 is to be far behind the knowledge of his time, and is shocking in a work that claims to be scientific. Indeed, Claude Bernard had published his Introduction to the Study of the Experimental Method two years earlier, and his Researches fourteen years earlier, and since then it has been said that the body’s energy works through the combustion of sugar, in the same way that the steam engine works through the combustion of coal. No doubt, if Marx had known this, he would not have failed to note the analogy.\n\nThe question of dialectics did not have, during Bakunin’s and Marx’s lifetime, the importance that it took on later. Besides, Marx used the term “dialectic” only belatedly in a positive sense. In German Ideology, written in 1846, the book in which Marx and Engels are said to have developed the foundations of their thought for the first time, we find neither the expression “historical materialism”, nor the word “dialectic” - except, of course, in the innumerable introductions, commentaries, prefaces and notes by the editors intended to enlighten the reader on concepts that Marx would have invented but which they he never named.\n\nThere is a curious debate among scholars about the influence of the Hegelian dialectic on Marx. In Dialectical Materialism, Henri Lefebvre points out that “We have to wait until the year 1858 to find the Hegelian dialectic being mentioned for the first time non-pejoratively.”\n\nIt is not without a certain perverse satisfaction that anarchists learn that it is thanks to Bakunin that Marx has worked out his method...\n\nMerleau-Ponty, on the contrary, states that “Marx begins with dialectical thought: it is all in this famous principle that one cannot destroy philosophy without realizing it” . We can therefore only note the extreme confusion that exists on the question of Marx’s method, due in large part to the fact that Marx himself never clearly explained himself on this matter. The authors who have dealt with this question seem unable to agree on the question, a fact that constitutes a serious handicap in terms of credibility for a method that claims to be scientific.\n\nOne naturally concludes that the only way to resolve this contradiction is to consider that the solutions offered by the various authors who have examined this question are only a mere reflect of the political stakes that their own interpretation of the Marxist method represents for them.\n\nIt is only in 1873, in the afterword to the second edition of Capital, that Marx mentions the dialectical content of his method. As for Engels, “historical materialism” does not appear in significant works such as the Anti-Duhring, of which Utopian Socialism and Scientific Socialism is an extract. It does, however, appear in the 1892 preface to the English edition of the text. By this time, Marx was dead.\n\nThe expressions “dialectical materialism” and “materialist dialectic” never appear in Marx’s writings. Engels uses the term only in 1886 in his Ludwig Feuerbach... and the expression is taken up by Dietzgen in 1887. It is not my purpose to trace the genesis of the use of these terms, but it is clear that they are apocryphal creations attributed without examination to Marx, and it is not known what his opinion on the matter would have been. In any case, he would probably have been opposed to the use of the expressions “materialist dialectic”, or “dialectical materialism”, which is a contradiction in terms that makes no more sense than the expression “materialist spiritualism” or “spiritualist materialism”. On this point Lucio Colletti comments: “what Engels and all of ‘dialectical materialism’ after him present as the highest and most developed form of materialism is none other than absolute idealism” : “’dialectical materialism’ is simply an idealism unaware of its own nature.”\n\n“The ‘dialectic of matter’, by which the finite becomes ideal and cancels itself out, is confused with the observation and ‘scientific verification’ of processes and changes that take place under their own force and at the level of simple matter of fact. There is no need to describe the extent to which this ‘mistake’ has affected and weighed upon the development of theoretical Marxism.”\n\nColletti concludes by saying that the philosophical critique of dialectical materialism “has been rendered useless by the critique of time"
