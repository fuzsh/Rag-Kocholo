        "text": "Western Philosophy\n\nSince the 1950s, Western philosophy has been divided\n\ninto analytic schools (focused on science, language, and communication)\n\nand the Continental schools (metaphysical, experiential approaches to meaning). Although\n\nthis is an artificial division, often based on the organization of university\n\nphilosophy departments more than philosophical theories, the division affects how\n\nwe discuss philosophy. Granted, the reason we can discuss philosophy is\n\nthat we are comfortable enough to sit in classes and cafés thinking grand\n\nthoughts and pondering existence.\n\nThe paradox… is that the scientific conception of the world does not\n\nclose the gap between knowledge and wisdom, but makes us feel it all\n\nthe more acutely… It is in advanced Western societies that the gap between\n\nknowledge and wisdom seems to widen into an abyss. In this sense, the\n\nspeculative question of the meaning of life is a consequence of luxury\n\nand affluence. Perhaps it was ever thus — philosophy only arises once\n\nthe basic exigencies of life have been provided.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Simon Critchley, p. 6\n\nIn the analytic tradition, philosophers attempt (often\n\nin vain) to understand the inherent reason and logic underlying existence.\n\nThe Continental schools are considered more experiential; existence is\n\nrandom and even absurd. As a more detailed review of Western philosophy before\n\nexistentialism demonstrates, the analytical and Continental can be traced through Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). The conclusions philosophers reach often reflect how they respond to Kant.\n\nCultural Differences\n\nWhile the history of Western philosophy runs through Kant, the differences between analytical and Continental philosophy are also cultural. The “Anglo-American” vs. “European” false dichotomy implied by labels like “Continental” do an injustice to the significant cultural differences within philosophy. These difference cannot be simplistically reduced to geopolitical maps. Instead, the differences might be considered as utilitarian-pragmatic philosophers arguing against idealistic-romantic philosophers.\n\nIn one camp, we have scientism. In the other, we have\n\nphilosopher-artists. It is a classic case of the scientist-artist divide\n\nmore than one of end goals or politics. The scientists want to reduce thought\n\nto equations (logical calculus) to prove their views, while the artists\n\nwant to seek to persuade audiences with parables and poetry.\n\n… [T]he best way of understanding the misunderstanding between opposed\n\nphilosophical traditions [is] in terms of the model of ‘the two cultures’.\n\nAccording to this model, analytic and Continental philosophy can be seen\n\nas expressions of opposed, indeed antagonistic, habits of thought – Benthamite\n\nempiricist-utilitarian and Coleridgean-hermeneutic-romantic — that make\n\nup the philosophical self-understanding of a specific culture.\n\nEssentially, this is a dispute between the scientific conception of\n\nthe world, advanced by Carnap and the Vienna Circle, and the existential\n\nor ‘hermeneutic’ experience of the world in Heidegger. This dispute is\n\nhighly significant for subsequent developments in philosophy insofar\n\nas Carnap’s views on Heidegger provide the background to Ayer’s attempted\n\nlogical positivist elimination of metaphysics in the British context,\n\nand Carnap had a vast influence on the professional development of analytic\n\nphilosophy in the United States after the Second World War, not the least\n\nthrough his most celebrated student, W. V. O. Quine.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, pp. 90-1\n\nAnalytical Philosophy\n\nScience has always been important to philosophers, with\n\nthe first philosophers being scholars in many fields. The theological and\n\nmetaphysical aspects of “truth” were also important to philosophers. Then came the industrial revolution and a shift towards analytical philosophy: searching for truth without considering the transcendent. Some texts suggest the analytic movement began with Ludwig Josef Johan Wittgenstein (1889–1951), an Austrian-born philosopher who lived and taught in Britain. Wittgenstein influenced logical positivism, linguistic analysis, and semiotics.\n\n… [S]cientific pretension requires that it is possible and necessary\n\nfor the conquest of real knowledge that the world be stripped of everything\n\nwhich human beings have ‘projected’ upon it — from colours to meanings,\n\nfrom smells to values. But this is to suppose that mind and world, subject\n\nand object, can be treated in logical isolation from one another and\n\nseparately examined.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; David E. Cooper, p. 15\n\nNot all analytical philosophers believe truth and reason\n\nare external to sentient existence. Most twentieth-century philosophical\n\ndebates argued not about “truth” but rather how and why we\n\ncreate understandings of truth. There are numerous complications underlying\n\nthese debates. Does language reflect truth? Or, does language create truth?\n\nCan any language or symbolic system accurately translate another language’s\n\ntruth? This is a bit tangled, since philosophers must use language to communicate\n\nwith each other.\n\nCarnap’s argument against metaphysics is not that its statements are\n\nfalse, but rather that they are simply meaningless. For logical positivists\n\nlike Carnap, meaning is rooted in the principle of verification, namely\n\nthat a word or sentence is meaningful only if it is in principle verifiable.\n\nBut what are the conditions for verification? They are two-fold: logical\n\nand empirical.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 100\n\nI suggest reading the works of Alfred\n\nJ. Ayer for an overview of logical positivism.\n\nLogical positivism insists there is a truth, which can\n\nbe communicated and shared. However, scholars specializing in the philosophy\n\nof science and the rhetoric of science have challenged the positivists\n\nby suggesting that insisting there is a truth is also a leap of faith.\n\nSuch arguments are circular and unlikely to be settled within philosophy\n\ndepartments.\n\nThis positivist habit of mind insisted that the ‘objective’ was synonymous\n\nwith the measurable and the ‘value free’. Its aim was to extract the\n\nsubject from the experiment in order to obtain a purely impersonal ‘view\n\nfrom nowhere’. This led to a number of significant discoveries, but it\n\nquickly became apparent that such an approach was inconsistent. The limiting\n\nof the knowable to the quantifiable was itself a value that was not quantifiable.\n\nThat is, the choice of this procedure was itself a ‘leap’ of sorts, an\n\nact of faith in a certain set of values that were not themselves measurable.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Thomas R. Flynn, p. 4\n\nUniversity philosophy programs in the United States,\n\nGreat Britain, Australia, and, to a lesser extent, Canada, have a marked\n\npreferences for analytical philosophy. As a result, some call the philosophical\n\nschools within the analytic tradition “Anglo-American philosophy.” However,\n\nthe dominance of analytic theories does not extend throughout the humanities\n\ndepartments, where the Continental traditions often hold sway.\n\nContinental Philosophy\n\nYes, Continental philosophy has something to do with “the” Continent. What, precisely,\n\nthat something is remains open to debate.\n\n… Continental philosophy is an invention, or, more accurately, a projection of the Anglo-American academy onto a Continental Europe that would not recognize the legitimacy of such an appellation — a little like asking for a Continental breakfast in Paris.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 32\n\nContinental philosophy might be viewed as a reaction\n\nto the analytical, scientific approach to philosophy. The more science\n\nexplains about the universe, the less important human existence seems.\n\nKnowlege and understanding actually increase our alienation from the universe\n\nand its natural laws. Humanity is reduced to nothing more than yet another\n\nrandom lifeform, an absurd accident on a spec of a planet. However, rejecting\n\nscience and knowledge completely can lead to various faiths and “–isms”\n\nthat are utter nonsense.\n\nMy contention is that what philosophy should be thinking through at\n\npresent is this dilemma which on the one side threatens to turn us into\n\nbeasts, and on the other side into lunatics… The appeal of much that\n\ngoes under the name of Continental philosophy, in my view, is that it\n\nattempts to unify or at least move closer together questions of knowledge\n\nand wisdom, of philosophical truth and existential meaning.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 9\n\nExistentialism grew out of the Continental traditions,\n\nespecially phenomenology. This was not a complete rejection of science\n\nand reason, but a call to examine life as it is experienced — something\n\nconsidered beyond science.\n\nExistentialism grew, in part, out of Husserl’s phenomenology, which in turn was a critical response to nineteenth-century materialism and positivism.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 13\n\nMany European thinkers embraced Marxism, which claimed to be a “scientific” analysis of history and culture. Unfortunately, the best logic and reason are incapable of predicting social evolution. Still, Marx developed a valuable theory of history and economics.\n\nThe problem with responding to scientism is that philosophy\n\ncan risk obscurantism, which deliberately ignores or even prevents the\n\nfacts and details of something from becoming known.\n\n… [T]here is a risk of obscurantism in some Continental philosophy,\n\nwhere social phenomena are explicated with reference to forces, entities,\n\nand categories so vast and vague as to explain everything and nothing\n\nat all.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 119\n\nEuropean philosophers began to focus on cultural concerns\n\nlate in the nineteenth century, a trend that continues. They also embraced\n\nreason and logic in their own way, with many of the philosophers coming\n\nfrom scientific and mathematical fields. However, they understood that\n\nscience could not find, or give, meaning to human existence. Science, for\n\nthese philosophers, was a tool but not necessarily the best philosophical\n\ntool.\n\nWhile the Existentialist is not, in any serious sense, an irrationalist,\n\nhe is certainly not a ‘rationalist’ in the philosophical sense that contrasts\n\nwith ‘empiricist’. He does not hold, that is, that the mind is innately\n\nequipped with, or predisposed towards, knowledge of certain truths about\n\nthe world. This is not because he is an ‘empiricist’, holding that all\n\nknowledge is the product of experience. The issue between the two camps\n\nis one of several which, for the Existentialist, rest on the false premise\n\nthat mind and world are logically independent of one another, like a\n\nspectator and the show before him. The ‘rationalist’ differs from the\n\n‘empiricist’ only in holding that the spectator arrives with a rich intellectual\n\napparatus through which the passing scene gets filtered.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 15\n\nPhenomenology and, later, existentialism, moved from\n\na focus on larger culture and communities to focus on the individual. This\n\nis not to claim that phenomenology and existentialism are not concerned\n\nwith groups and social philosophy, but there is a clear belief that the\n\nindividual can define the self. There is also a touch of utopianism, especially\n\nwithin the works of the thinkers associated with phenomenology. The belief\n\nof these Continental philosophers is that introspection can lead to a metaphysical\n\ntransformation. Some even hold this to be true for entire communities.\n\n… [T]he Continental tradition is concerned with giving a philosophical\n\ncritique of the social practices of the modern world that aspires towards\n\na notion of individual or societal emancipation. In other words, much\n\nContinental philosophy asks us to look at the world critically with the\n\nintention of identifying some sort of transformation, whether personal\n\nor collective.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 54\n\nPhenomenology and related movements are sometimes referred\n\nto as experiential because they are concerned with the experiences of the individual. How one person experiences life is unique. Relating to others is possible, but only within the limits of shared experiences. And pondering our experiences can lead to revelations, of a sort.\n\nContinental philosphy itself is divided by debates on\n\nhow much experience should trump reason, or if the two are one and the\n\nsame.\n\nThe question of the status of reason and rationality versus the irrationality\n\nof much of human existence is a conflict that is at the heart of disagreements\n\nin the Continental tradition to this day, for example in the modernism\n\n/ postmodernism debate that defined much of the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 20\n\nContinental Movements\n\nSimon Critchley provides a chart of major Continental\n\nmovements (p. 13). This not not a complete history, but rather a convenient\n\nway to consider various thinkers.\n\nWhat the Continental movements seem to share is an impulse\n\nto critique, to rebel against something. At times, it seems rebellion is\n\nits own purpose in Continental schools of thought, as if there cannot be\n\na moment of contentment. If there isn’t something wrong with the human\n\ncondition, what is the point of philosophy? And this doesn’t mean some\n\nminor “room for improvement,” to the Continental thinkers. Life itself\n\nis a crisis.\n\nFor much of the Continental tradition, philosophy is a means to criticize the present, to promote a reflective awareness of the present as being in crisis, whether this is expressed as a crisis of faith in a bourgeois philistine world (in Kierkegaard), a crisis of the European sciences (in Husserl), of the human sciences (in Foucault), of nihilism (in Nietzsche), of the forgetfulness of Being (in Heidegger), of bourgeois-capitalist society (in Marx), of the hegemony of instrumental rationality and the domination of nature (in Adorno and Max Horkheimer), or whatever. […] Philosophy in the Continental tradition has an emancipatory intent. For a philosopher, the real crisis would be a situation where crisis was not recognized. In such a world, philosophy would have no purpose, other than as a historical curiosity, an intellectual distraction, or a technical means of sharpening one’s common sense.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 73\n\nPhenomenology\n\nNo discussion of existentialism should occur without\n\nan introduction to phenomenology. Edmund Husserl and his assistant Martin Heidegger were not existentialists, though they contributed to the development of phenomenology and, therefore, existentialism. In this respect, all formal existential thought and scholarship descends from the works of Husserl.\n\nIf we return to the Existential philosophical lineage, after Nietzsche it is Edmund Husserl’s work on phenomenology which leads, quite directly, into the main Existential thought of the twentieth century. His ideas were seized upon by Jaspers, Heidegger and Sartre, among others. He argued that science could only know the world in a certain way which it had already presupposed, but that this was not the way the world was apprehended by individuals. The fact that an object is present or represented in our consciousness has no bearing on the way that that object is in the world.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 6\n\nThe basic assumption of phenomenology is that we experience\n\nthe world as a series of conscious observations and interpretations. We\n\nexplore existence at a distance, as observers of our own lives. Even when\n\nwe try to understand ourselves, we are then thinking about “I” as something\n\nexternal to our thoughts. You can try to think about thinking about yourself,\n\nbut there is always a strange, difficult to comprehend distance between\n\nthought and object.\n\nThough the phenomenological method developed by Edmund Husserl in the first third of the 20th century was adopted in one form or another by the existentialists of that same period, many, perhaps most, phenomenologists are not existentialists. But all accept the best-known and most significant claim of this approach, namely that all consciousness is consciousness of an other-than-consciousness. In other words, it is the very nature of consciousness to aim towards (to ‘intend’) an other. Even when it is directed towards itself in reflection, consciousness is directed as towards an ‘other’.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Thomas R. Flynn, p. 17\n\nKarl Jaspers’ approach to philosophy was closer to Husserl’s phenomenology than Sartre’s existentialism, though Jaspers used the term Existenzphilosophie to describe his approach to philosophical reasoning. The term suggests existentialism, but it requires some mental gymnastics to label Jaspers an existentialist. I could defend such a classification, but many scholars reject this outright and place him among the phenomenological thinkers, along with Maurice Merleau-Ponty. This raises the question: does existential phenomenology differ from existentialism?\n\nFor many philosophers, the word ‘existential’ is most at home in the\n\nexpression existential phenomenology. There is general agreement that the most significant versions of twentieth-century existentialism are developments, welcome or perverse, from phenomenology, the philosophy elaborated by Edmund Husserl in the early years of the century: Heidegger describes Being\n\nand Time as a work of phenomenology, while Merleau-Ponty and Sartre use the word in the title or subtitle of their main works.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 5\n\nHusserl’s phenomenology requires that we study experience, the world as it is lived and observed by humans. Science and, to some extent, analytic\n\nphilosophers are concerned with why and how things are as they end up being perceived. Phenomenology does not seek to explain phenomena, leaving such explanations to scientists; instead the phenomenologist wants us to focus clearly on the experienced phenomena.\n\nAs Husserl once said, the point of phenomenological method is not to explain (by finding causes) but to get us to see (by presenting essences or intelligible contours).\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 20\n\nPhenomenology is about meaning, and meaning occurs only\n\nwhen a living being uses an object or concept. Meaning comes from experience\n\nand application. The phenemologist attempts to separate the observed object\n\nfrom perceptions of the object. It’s a complex and confusing concept, admittedly.\n\n… [I]maging consciousness is a way of ‘derealizing’ the world of our\n\nperceptions that manifests its distinctive features to careful phenomenological\n\ndescription. If we imagine an apple that we previously perceived, for\n\ninstance, a careful description of the experience will reveal how the\n\nimagining differs from the perceiving of the same apple. For one thing,\n\nunlike the perceived apple, the imagined one has only those features\n\nthat we choose to give it. Images as such teach us nothing. And so it\n\nis with our other conscious acts. Each reveals its distinctive features\n\nto phenomenological description.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 20\n\nWhat is this phenomenological method for describing objects?\n\nIt reminds some students of a zen-like meditation on objects, including\n\nthe self. In the language of phenomenology, we must “bracket” reality to\n\nconsider objects properly. Yes, this does resemble spiritual meditation\n\nmore than traditional philosophy.\n\nIn a procedure akin to Descartes’ methodological doubt, the phenomenologist\n\nmust suspend belief, or ‘put in brackets’, any reality beyond consciousness\n\nand the ‘meanings’ in which consciousness trades. The scientist studies\n\ncolour by examining its physical properties, but the philosopher concerned\n\nwith the ‘meaning’ of colour must put aside the assumption of real, physical\n\nexistence made by the scientist.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 5\n\nThe problem with this nearly spiritual approach to observation,\n\ndespite its claims of a rigorous methodology, is that it potentially elevates\n\nthe philosopher to seer. When my students read Heidegger, they comment on the mystical nature of his works. They do not mean this as a compliment; philosophy should be more than sensing the “right” insights.\n\nThe assumption is that if the description is mounted rigorously, the\n\ninquirer will simply see for himself. The potential weakness, of course,\n\nis that, in response to the claim ‘I don’t see it’, the phenomenologist\n\ncan merely reply, ‘well, look more closely’.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 21\n\nThe stated goal of phenomenology is to describe lived\n\nexperience without obscuring the description through misapplication of\n\nscientific concepts. As you can see (pun intended) from the previous citations\n\nand examples, phenomenology itself can be obscure. Even phenomenolgists\n\ndidn’t always agree on the end results of their method. Merleau-Ponty suggested it was best to view phenomenology not as a single method towards truth, but as a set of methods with the shared goal of moving past theories, including those theories of past philosophers. He sought a “pre-theoretical” experience.\n\nMerleau-Ponty, in a nice turn of phrase, describes the task of phenomenology as ‘unveiling the pre-theoretical layer’ of human experience upon which the theoretical attitude of the scientific conception of the world is based.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 113\n\nSartre and Merleau-Ponty, extending the works of Heidegger, each argued in his own way that an ideal phenomenology was illusory. Humans cannot suspend belief in reality, even though philosophers often write of the absence of reality or universals. Merleau-Ponty wrote that it was absurd to even ask if the world is real. By implication, this would make humanity “unreal” — an even more absurd proposition than the existentialists could accept.\n\nFor the Existentialist, the question of whether descriptions of the\n\nworld are objective or subjective is a bad one. They are not objective,\n\nif this means being of a kind which a scrupulously detached spectator\n\nwould provide, for a spectator completely disengaged from the world could\n\nhave no conception of it at all. But nor are they subjective, if this\n\nmeans that they are glosses smeared over, and therefore occluding, the\n\nworld as it is in itself.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 16\n\nEventually, the existentialist thinkers came to describe\n\nthe ideal phenomenology as an impossible, illogical task. Though phenomenology\n\ncontinues to influence the social studies, language arts, and general humanities,\n\nthe existentialists realized the phenomenological method was destined to\n\nfall short of its aims.\n\nThe existentialists offer two reasons for rejecting Husserl’s phenomenological reduction. First, it makes our basic relationship to the world theoretical rather than practical, as if we were born theoreticians and later learned about practice. Husserl’s student, Martin Heidegger, on the contrary, insisted that we were originally ‘in the world’ instrumentally by means of our practical concerns and that philosophy should analyse this ‘pre-theoretical’ awareness in order to gain access to being. […] Even Husserl, later in life, seemed to acknowledge these claims by introducing the concept of the ‘lifeworld’ as the pre-theoretical basis of our theoretical reflection.\n\nBut the major existentialist objection is that being itself is not an\n\n‘essence’ subject to reduction and, as Merleau-Ponty famously phrased it, ‘a complete [phenomenological] reduction is impossible’ because you cannot ‘reduce’ the existing ‘reducer’. The existing individual is more than his or her ‘definition’ such as one might hope to capture in a theoretical concept.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 23\n\nExistentialism, the Label\n\nWithout question, the dominant figure in existentialism\n\nis Jean-Paul Sartre; according to various sources, he either coined the term (unilkely) or at least promoted it briefly (definitely). It is more likely Karl Jaspers or Gabriel Marcel coined the term, or a variation of it, while Sartre popularized the image of the chain-smoking French existentialist. To understand the current definition of existentialism, one must first recognize that the American view of existentialism was derived primarily from the writings of three French political activists (Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir), not intellectual purists. Americans learned the term existential after World War II. It was not until the late 1950s that the term was applied broadly to several divergent schools of thought.\n\nNone of the great existentialist tomes contains the word ‘existentialism’.\n\nReports on its origin differ, but it seems to have been coined towards\n\nthe end of World War II by the French philosopher Gabriel Marcel as a label for the currently emerging ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre and his close friend Simone de Beauvoir.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 1\n\nSartre would eventually write that existentialism was something of a phase he passed through on the way to Marxism. Sartre came to declare existentialism a minor footnote to Marxism, which illustrates Sartre’s interests were more in politics than pure philosophical theory. It could be argued that living authentically, possibly using Socrates as a model, we should do more than think about philosophy — it must be lived. Albert\n\nCamus was an absurdist, suggesting existentialism was more methodology than philosophy. Camus called existentialism “philosophical suicide” if used to ponder life. Considering Camus’ fascination with death, that’s quite a statement.\n\nI call the existential attitude philosophical suicide. How else to start\n\nfrom the world’s lack of meaning and end up by finding a meaning and\n\na depth to it?\n\n— Albert Camus as paraphrased; Introducing Existentialism; Richard Appignanesi, p. 36\n\nThough a twentieth-century creation (or evolution) of\n\nphilosophers, the label “existentialist” quickly was attached to any number\n\nof thinkers. Notably, the term was applied to various authors because the semi-official\n\nexistentialists were novelists, journalists, and essayists. Not to suggest that\n\nthe retroactive label wasn’t applied to philosophers, but it seems that\n\nliterary skills helped earn the label (posthumously).\n\nThe next stage was to rake through the remoter philosophical past in\n\nsearch of thinkers deserving of the label, the prime candidates being\n\nthe two enfants terribles of the nineteenth century, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, both of whom were known to have influenced Heidegger, Jaspers and Sartre. This intellectual archaeology was soon to know no bounds, with Pascal, Montaigne, even St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine, newly excavated as heralds of existentialism. And this labelling game was not confined to the field of philosophy. Novelists reckoned to have concerned themselves with such typically Sartrean themes as anxiety and conflict with others were soon included — Franz Kafka, for example.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 2\n\nExistentialism Is…\n\nExistentialism, broadly defined, is a set of philosophical\n\nsystems concerned with free will, choice, and personal responsibility. Because we make choices based on our experiences, beliefs, and biases, those choices are unique to us — and made without an objective form of truth. There are no “universal” guidelines for most decisions, existentialists believe. Instead, even trusting science is often a “leap\n\nof faith.” Existentialism is, at its core, individualistic.\n\nFree will requires an individual, and existentialists recognize\n\nthat individuality is a complex concept. Philosophy was shaken by the Industrial\n\nRevolution and the rise of “dehumanizing” technologies. Standing apart\n\nis nearly impossible and “for the existentialist, being an individual in\n\nour mass society is an achievement rather than a starting point” (Flynn,\n\np. 23). While modern psychology suggests we develop our individuality\n\nas we mature,\n\nit seems to accept that we are destined to be “individual” in basic sense.\n\nExistentialists reject the notion that all humans, or even most humans,\n\nwill be individuals. No, this is not the “self-actualized individual” of\n\nsome New Age belief system, but the individual who can and does confront\n\nthe disorienting absurdity and alienation of an aware and engaged existence.\n\nNo higher power or “Truth” offers security and reassurance to the existential individual:\n\nhe or she is alone, yet surrounded by The Other.\n\nThe individualism of existentialism means that any attempt\n\nto craft a system of existential philosophy or existential ethics runs\n\ncounter to its core nature. It is not a philosophy of universal truths,\n\nyet at the same time the existentialists considered the human condition\n\nof alienation to be universal.\n\n…[W]hat sets it [existentialism] apart from most other philosophies is that it begins\n\nwith the ‘individual’ rather than the ‘universal’ and so does not aim\n\nto arrive at general truths: its insistence on personal insights as the\n\nonly means to real understanding entails that it makes no claims to objective\n\nknowledge.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 1\n\nMost visitors complaining about primer content advocate for a pure Sartrean existentialism… which doesn’t exist.\n\nThe major thinkers associated with existentialism appear\n\nto agree on little, except for their emphasis on individualism. This intense\n\nfocus on the individual is not expressed uniformly. Some of the thinkers\n\nbelieved the individual should be pursuing a personal relationship with\n\na Creator, while others were concerned with the individual’s needs within\n\nMarxist theory. Even “individuality” is individual to the existentialists. When students (or readers of the primer) complain that a paragraph or slide doesn’t represent The Existentialism, the commenter demonstrates that indviduals select the existetnialist(s) and existentialism they want.\n\nCertainly, existentialism is not a school of thought nor reducible to\n\nany set of tenets. The three writers who appear invariably on every list\n\nof existentialists — Jaspers, Heidegger, and Sartre — are not in agreement on essentials. By the time we consider adding Rilke, Kafka, and Camus, it becomes plain that one essential feature shared by all these men is their perfervid individualism.\n\n— Existentialism:\n\nFrom Dostoevsky to Sartre; Walter Kaufmann, p. 11\n\nAs one of the common criticisms suggests, emphasizing individuality is not without risks. It might be admirable in the face of the Industrial Revolution and Information Age to resist dehumanization, but it can also lead to a perverse focus on the singular, isolated one who must still live among others.\n\nIt is commonly acknowledged that existentialism is a philosophy about\n\nthe concrete individual. This is both its glory and its shame. In an\n\nage of mass communication and mass destruction, it is to its credit that\n\nexistentialism defends the intrinsic value of what its main proponent Sartre calls the ‘free organic individual’, that is, the flesh-and-blood agent.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, preface p. ii\n\nThough individualism is stressed by existential writers,\n\nthey also address the struggles of balancing the self and “The Other” in\n\na social existence. The quandry of being both an isolated one and part\n\nof the larger many contributes to the alienation that is prominant in many existential works. Existentialism’s historical\n\ncontext contributes to this struggle.\n\nThis does not mean that Existential thinkers refuse to comment on ‘humanity’\n\nas a whole. On the contrary, it is usual for them to contrast precisely\n\nhow the individual is separated from the mass and is obliged to separate\n\nhim– or herself from it. Further, it is quite usual for this to be placed\n\nin the context of the ‘age’ within which the writers place themselves.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 20\n\nWe must never forget that existentialism is a Continental\n\nmovement specific to the experiences of the men and women responsible for the existential works. The thinkers’ lack of faith in science and technology, their disillusionment with the Industrial Revolution, was accompanied by a loss of faith in the traditions of European philosophy.\n\nExistentialism is as it is because the thinkers involved in it perceive\n\nthat there is not only a problem with philosophy itself, but there are\n\nalso problems with psychology and with the aims of science. It therefore\n\nattempts to carve out a way of thinking, a way of being even, or thinking\n\nabout being/Being, which at the same time corrects these errors and installs\n\nitself as a new kind of philosophy.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 22\n\nThemes of Existentialism\n\nDespite encompassing a staggering range of philosophical,\n\nreligious, and political ideologies, according to most scholars the underlying\n\nconcepts of existentialism are:\n\nHumans define themselves through the act of living (and dying).\n\nLiving is a series of interactions with other humans and their\n\nchoices.\n\nAlienation is a condition of modern life we cannot avoid.\n\nHumans have free will and with that comes despair.\n\nFree will implies responsibility for choices and actions.\n\nFree will also means that life itself is a choice, once one is\n\nself-aware.\n\nLife is a series of choices, creating anxiety and stress.\n\nDecisions seldom are without any negative consequences.\n\nOne must commit to decisions, or they aren’t authentic decisions.\n\nSome things are irrational or absurd, without explanation.\n\nLife either has no meaning (atheists) or the meaning cannot be\n\nunderstood (theists).\n\nEvents are random and even cruel, as opposed to a belief in Karma\n\nand universal justice.\n\nIllustrating the challenge of defining existentialism,\n\nscholars highlight different aspects of existentialism when trying to assembly\n\ndefinitions or lists of defining themes. Though scholars tend to select\n\noverlapping themes and concepts when describing existentialism, the different\n\nviews of what the core tenets are can be frustrating.\n\nFive Themes of Existentialism\n\nThere are five basic themes that the existentialist appropriates each\n\nin his or her own way. Rather than constituting a strict definition of\n\n‘existentialist’, they depict more of a family resemblance (a crisscrossing\n\nand overlapping of the themes) among these philosophers.\n\nExistence precedes essence. What you are (your essence) is the result of your choices (your existence) rather than the reverse. Essence is not destiny. You are what you make yourself to be.\n\nTime is of the essence. We are fundamentally time-bound beings. Unlike measurable, ‘clock’ time, lived time is qualitative: the ‘not yet’, the ‘already’, and the ‘present’ differ among themselves in meaning and value.\n\nHumanism. Existentialism is a person-centred philosophy. Though not anti-science, its focus is on the human individual’s pursuit of identity and meaning amidst the social and economic pressures of mass society for superficiality and conformism.\n\nFreedom/responsibility. Existentialism is a philosophy of freedom. Its basis is the fact that we can stand back from our lives and reflect on what we have been doing. In this sense, we are always ‘more’ than ourselves. But we are as responsible as we are free.\n\nEthical considerations are paramount. Though each existentialist understands the ethical, as with ‘freedom’, in his or her own way, the underlying concern is to invite us to examine the authenticity of our personal lives and of our society.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 8\n\nEssence, Existence, and Language\n\nThe desire to define ourselves is why groups\n\nadvocate for the ideal unbiased, neutral, person-centric language discussed later.\n\nI advise visitors to read the\n\nlexicon following this introduction. Existentialism, and philosophy in general, is infected with a variety of lexicons, unfortunately. Definitions of words vary by philosopher; no two seem to use a word to mean the same thing. I have done my best to assemble a basic\n\nlexicon. When thinkers differ in meanings, I attempt to explain when, how, and why — if we can ever understand why people change words. (Through the looking glass we venture.)\n\nMost visitors to this site have heard Jean-Paul\n\nSartre’s famous statement from Being and Nothingness, “Existence precedes and rules essence.” In general, it is accepted that people create an essence while all other things have an essence and are then created or understood by people.\n\nWhat a person is at any given time, his ‘essence’, is always a function\n\nof what he is on the way to becoming in pursuit of the projects issuing\n\nfrom a reflective concern for his life.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 3\n\nIf you have a new idea for a tool, the idea exists before the object you intend to create. However, you can understand your idea only via words or symbols already known. This means all comprehension of “essense” is limited by existing language. Questions of philosophy eventually confront matters of language and expression. What we know is complicated when we try to share knowledge or wisdom. Each time we communicate, some loss of meaning occurs.\n\nWhat does it mean to “exist” for an existential philosopher?\n\nAgain, language contributes to the haze.\n\nA more decisive reason, having to do with the etymology of the word\n\n‘exist’, helps to explain Heidegger’s use of it. In some of his writings he spells the word with a hyphen, ‘ex-ist’, thereby drawing attention to its derivation from the Greek and Latin words meaning ‘to stand out from’.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 4\n\nHow we relate to people and each other is limited by\n\nlanguage, even if we accept the idea that first a person exists, then he\n\nor she is free to define a “self” in the world. The concepts of language\n\nand symbols complicate the existence-essence relationship because how we\n\ndescribe something affects how others perceive that thing or person.\n\nA person has a ‘concreteness’, ‘particularity’ and ‘uniqueness’ which\n\nmake it impossible to equate him with an aggregate of instantiated universals.\n\n…Kierkegaard’s constant references to ‘the existing individual’, ‘the existing thinker’ and the like are intended to remind his readers — versed, presumably, in the traditional doctrine or its more recent Hegelian variation — that, with human beings, their existence is peculiarly ‘particular’, and known to themselves ‘immediately’.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 4\n\nLanguage and Truth\n\nFrequently, existential concepts have been expressed\n\nvia the literary arts. Words have power — especially in creative works.\n\nWe communicate via images, sounds, and touch. For most\n\nof us, what we think is converted to a form of “unspoken speech” in our\n\nminds. This means we can only understand and explain things in some form\n\nof spoken word. Philosophers dealing with ideas of deconstruction and postmodern\n\nlinguistics have come to appreciate the limits of language and the social\n\nimplications of words.\n\nTaken as a whole, the rich texture and density of Existential writing\n\nis not an aesthetic affectation; it is part of each philosopher’s attempt\n\nto render their thinking and experiences in a way which is a proper realization\n\nof those ideas, sensations and events. To speak with a ‘received language’\n\nwould be to speak inauthentically. It is natural, then, for each Existential\n\nphilosopher to create a way of speaking which can be considered unique.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 10\n\nThe question of “truth” is often linked to language by\n\nphilosophers. The pragmatists theorize that truth is the best, and generally\n\ndominant, description of a phenomenon. Some existentialists appear to embrace\n\nthis view of truth, though they are not in the same philosophical tradition\n\nas pragmatists.\n\nWhile he cannot accept a definition of truth as correspondence with\n\na reality independent of all human conceptions of it, the Existentialist\n\nis perfectly able to accept that beliefs can be objectively true in the\n\nsense of being warranted by criteria on which there is tried and tested\n\npublic agreement.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 17\n\nExistentialism has been questioning “truth” since Kierkegaard and Nietzsche pondered how we come to understand knowledge. Kierkegaard suggested truth was personal, a question of faith even when pondering mundane matters. The idea that truth could be individual was radical, especially since Kierkegaard focused on the “truth” of Christianity. For Nietzsche, the problem of truth was one of interpretation: you and I will interpret accurate data differently.\n\nNietzsche had insisted that all knowledge was interpretation and that there was no ‘original’ non-interpreted text. In other words, what counted as knowledge was interpretation ‘all the way down’.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 13\n\nThe analytical\n\nphilosophers have traditionally viewed language and grammars as closer to “truth” than Continental philosophers do. This is a fundamental, defining difference between analytic and Continental schools of thought. This can confuse readers unfamiliar with the conceptual differences, since Continental philosophers often sound certain. Even the existentialists seem to be making universal claims about humanity, but this is a rhetorical device.\n\nThe philosophical term for the study of Being is ‘ontology’ and Existentialism,\n\nwhen viewed as a philosophical endeavour, is essentially an ontological\n\nanalysis (as opposed to, say, ‘epistemology’, the study of knowledge).\n\nBeing is not open to scientific analysis — at least, not as we currently\n\nunderstand science. And yet Existentialism, and those writers who have\n\ncontributed to Existential thought, treat their pronouncements upon human\n\nbeing as if they were giving us ‘facts’.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 21\n\nLanguage and Identity\n\nIf we each define an essence by living and making choices,\n\nwe are still limited by words and other forms of text when we want to express\n\nthat essence to others. We accept, embrace, reject, and create our labels, trying to define ourselves… to ourselves and to others.\n\nA dog does not worry over its being and does not name itself ‘dog’;\n\nnor does it consciously worry over its future or how it can live its\n\nlife to its full potential.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, pp. 20-1\n\nFrench, as with most languages, is gender-specific even\n\nwhen naming objects. Simone de Beauvoir wondered how language affects gender identity. Language shapes us, while we also have some power to shape language. Because language is not static, we can argue for new words, new meanings, and even new grammars. Unfortunately, no language is a perfect representation of ideas, and our ideas are shaped by existing language. We are the words we use — which is why creating new words and modifying existing terminology appeals to some thinkers, as the existential lexicon illustrates.\n\nLife and Free Will\n\nMankind is the only known animal, according to earth-bound\n\nexistentialists, that defines itself through the act of living. In other words, first a man or woman exists, then the individual spends a lifetime changing his or her essence. Without life there can be no meaning; the search for meaning in existentialism is the search for self… which is why there is existential psychotherapy. (Imagine a therapist telling people life has no meaning!) If you must define yourself through living, then you are never able to say, “I am this” because even pondering self-definition changes you.\n\nWe can get nowhere, Heidegger argues, unless we consider the most fundamental of all questions — ‘What is the meaning of Being?’ and it is clear, both in Heidegger and in Sartre, that self and existence can have no fixed definition at all: to exist as a human being is precisely to ask the question ‘What is Being?’\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 2\n\nWhile essence and existence can be confusing concepts,\n\nthe basic nature of free will means that a person can only be defined in\n\nterms of his or her choices and the path towards the future charted by\n\nthose choices.\n\n… [At] any given point in an acorn’s career, it is possible to give\n\nan exhaustive description of it in terms of the properties — colour,\n\nmolecular structure, etc. — which belong to it at that moment. But no\n\ncomplete account can be given of a human being without reference to what\n\nhe is in the process of becoming — without reference, that is, to the\n\nprojects and intentions which he is on the way to realizing, and in terms\n\nof which sense is made of his present condition.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 3\n\nA student is in the process of becoming a graduate. The\n\nnew employee might be in the process of becoming a manager. The apprentice\n\nis training to be the master. We are each on several paths, as we are several\n\nthings and becoming several more at all times.\n\nAuthenticity\n\nUsually associated with Sartre, the notion of “authenticity” appears throughout the works of existential thinkers. The term actually traces back to Kierkegaard, who also explained the challenges of being true to yourself in the face of social pressures. To be authentic is to choose your own path in life, though that might or might not comply with social norms.\n\nKierkegaard also introduced the idea of ‘authenticity’ and the idea of ‘an authentic self’ for which we alone are responsible. He described how there was a public pressure to conform to society and that this necessarily led to ‘inauthenticity’, and that a certain feeling or mood, ‘anxiety’, indicated or revealed to us that the true nature of our lives is founded on choices which we must make based only on what we as individuals create as values. As such, we are therefore forced to make choices based on ‘nothing’ that is certain: our existence has no grounding, or, to put it in a more dramatically Existential way, we are suspended over an abyss.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, pp. 3-4\n\nThe demand for authenticity contributes to one of the criticisms\n\nof existentialism: since no one can be entirely authentic, can anyone be existential? Or is the pursuit of authentic existence sufficient, something like the pursuit of good in some religions? To this, existentialism adds another quandary, by insisting that questioning “being” is a human pursuit. What if some humans do not question what it is to be, much less to be authentically?\n\nIf to be human is to question being, are those people who do not question\n\nbeing somehow not human? In Existential terms they would certainly be\n\nconsidered ‘inauthentic’. Does that mean that to be authentic it is necessary\n\nto be (or aspire to be) a philosopher and to at least have read Being\n\nand Time and Being and Nothingness?\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 24\n\nChoosing Life, Pondering Death\n\nExistentialism is not (necessarily) depressing. Existentialism\n\nis about life: existentialists believe in living — and in fighting for\n\nlife. We define ourselves by living; suicide would indicate you have chosen\n\nto have no meaning.\n\n‘Death’ alone does not create meaningfulness, nor exactly does the self’s\n\nconfrontation with its own end. This is because death in the thinking\n\nof Heidegger and Sartre is not a future event isolated in time which is yet to happen; it is bound up with the now and how I project myself. Sartre takes issue with Heidegger’s notion that we are waiting upon death since, he argues, we can never know the moment of our death. This leads to a greater sense of urgency in Sartre for our lives are the projects we achieve, not the ones we intend to achieve. Camus understands death in a different way. It is the absurdity of life that we exist and that simultaneously death renders everything futile. Why not commit suicide, then? Because that would show that we were certain that life was not worth living, and to be certain we would have to know what the meaning of life is.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 19\n\nWhat happens when we realize that even life itself is\n\na choice? The initial response is existential “angst” and “despair” because\n\nthis means getting out of bed every day is a choice. For an existentialist,\n\nthe saying “Everything is political” becomes “Everything is philosophical”\n\n— including living. You are confronted by life, by the fact every action\n\nthroughout the day is a choice that sets more events in motion and necessitates\n\nyet more choices.\n\nThe existentialists conclude that human choice is subjective, because\n\nindividuals finally must make their own choices without help from such\n\nexternal standards as laws, ethical rules, or traditions. Because individuals\n\nmake their own choices, they are free; but because they freely choose,\n\nthey are completely responsible for their choices. The existentialists\n\nemphasize that freedom is necessarily accompanied by responsibility.\n\nFurthermore, since individuals are forced to choose for themselves, they\n\nhave their freedom — and therefore their responsibility — thrust upon\n\nthem. They are “condemned to be free.”\n\nFor existentialism, responsibility is the dark side of freedom. When\n\nindividuals realize that they are completely responsible for their decisions,\n\nactions, and beliefs, they are overcome by anxiety. They try to escape\n\nfrom this anxiety by ignoring or denying their freedom and their responsibility.\n\nBut because this amounts to ignoring or denying their actual situation,\n\nthey succeed only in deceiving themselves. The existentialists criticize\n\nthis flight from freedom and responsibility into self-deception. They\n\ninsist that individuals must accept full responsibility for their behavior,\n\nno matter how difficult. If an individual is to live meaningfully and\n\nauthentically, he or she must become fully aware of the true character\n\nof the human situation and bravely accept it.\n\n— World Book Multimedia Encyclopedia © 2001 by World Book, Inc.\n\nIvan Soll, Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy, University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\nAlienation and The Other\n\nExistentialism is rooted decidedly in post-Industrial\n\nRevolution Western culture. The migration of people from small farming\n\ncommunities to crowded cities revealed that even among thousands, or millions,\n\nof people it is possible to be alienated as an individual. Philosophers\n\nbegan to ask if it was possible for humans to be anything other than alienated\n\nfrom each other.\n\nBoth Kierkegaard and Nietzsche can be seen as outsiders, in their writings\n\nand in their lives, and it is a feature of Existentialism that its precepts\n\nand many of its examples present us with alienated figures. The refusal\n\nto conform to society’s received values is common to both these writers\n\nand is a strong thread that runs throughout Existentialism.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 5\n\nToday, alienation is an important concern of not only\n\nphilosophers, but also of psychologists and social theorists. Alienation,\n\nas a state of being, has implications both personal and social.\n\nThis is the sense that the most serious question with which philosophy\n\nhas to deal is that of alienation in its various forms — alienation from\n\nthe world, from one’s fellows, from oneself. It is to the alienation\n\nthreatened by a dualism of mind and body and by the scientific image\n\nof an objective reality untainted by human concerns, and not to the spectre\n\nof scepticism, which philosophy must, before all else, respond. Existentialism\n\nitself is just such a response.\n\n— Existentialism: A Reconstruction; Cooper, p. 8\n\nFor Continental philosophers, including those associated\n\nwith existentialism, the emergence of analytical\n\nphilosophy contributed to alienation. The Industrial Revolution was followed by a technology revolution and the emergence of the “knowledge economy” that emphasizes science and technical solutions to problems, including social problems.\n\nFrom a Continental perspective, the adoption of scientism in philosophy\n\nfails to grasp the critical and emancipatory function of philosophy:\n\nthat is, it fails to see the possible complicity between a scientific\n\nconception of the world and what Nietzsche saw as nihilism. It fails\n\nfundamentally to see the role that science and technology play in the\n\nalienation of human beings from the world. This alienation can happen\n\nin a number of ways, whether through turning the world into a causally\n\ndetermined realm of objects that stand against an isolated human subject,\n\nor through turning those objects into empty commodities that can be surveyed\n\nor traded with indifference.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 111\n\nAccording to existentialists, the scientific method separates\n\npeople from their actual, lived experiences. Existentialists believe their\n\nmethods are the only way to recognize the nature of and confront alienation.\n\nPhilosophy as Art\n\nI am expanding the page on existentialism’s contribution\n\nto art and literature.\n\nExistentialism is associated with literature, theatre,\n\nmusic, and film. Though not all “existential works” are by “existentialists,”\n\nmost people learn of existentialism through literary works. From Dostoevsky’s novels to Kafka’s short stories, novels have confronted existentialism and absurdism. The forefathers of existentialism, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche both wrote parables. Students throughout the Western world read Sartre’s plays and Camus’ novels.\n\n…[T]here is a certain ‘literariness’ to Existentialism, so that the\n\nprevalence of novels and other literary texts in the canon of Existential\n\nliterature would seem to remove it further from the possibility of being\n\na philosophy. Many of the ‘straight’ philosophical essays and books by\n\nthinkers such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche are themselves cast in a literary\n\nvein, rather than in the disciplined rhetoric of a rigorous philosophical\n\ndiscourse.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 1\n\nAs a writer, I know the power of creative writing, especially\n\nwhen you want to explore how an individual reacts to situations. Academic\n\nwriting tends to be not only dry but, bluntly, much of it is horrible.\n\nBy mastering other literary forms, the existentialists became more effective\n\nwriters in general. Few other philosophical schools of thought have had\n\nthe reach of existentialism outside academia, in no small part because\n\nthese thinkers were interesting authors.\n\nBecause of its dramatic conception of existence, its widespread use\n\nof powerful images in its arguments, and its appeal to personal response\n\nin its communications, existentialism has always been closely associated\n\nwith the fine arts. […] So strong is the influence ofexistentialist\n\nideas in the fine arts that, as we have seen, some would prefer to describe\n\nexistentialism as a literary movement. Certainly, authors like Dostoevsky\n\nand Kafka, playwrights like Beckett and Ionesco, and artists like Giacometti\n\nand Picasso exemplify many of the defining characteristics of existentialist\n\nthought.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 16\n\nMost stories, excluding generational or situational epics,\n\ndeal with one character’s journey. Stories are how we, as a culture, explore\n\nwhat it means to make choices about self-definition. The literature most\n\nclosely associated with existential themes tends toward psychological thriller.\n\nIt might be Sartre’s No\n\nExit or any work by Kafka — the literature features an element of mystery.\n\nThe novel form has been of particular use to the Existentialists, and\n\nquite often in the guise of a thriller, literally in works such as Crime\n\nand Punishment, and metaphysically in a novel like The\n\nTrial. The reason for this is not hard to fathom. Novels usually depend upon a central character, and throughout the history of the form the focus of the novel has more often than not been the psychological, the inner workings of the mind and consciousness. As such, therefore, it is tailor-made for working through an individual’s awakening to the exigencies of existence.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, pp. 10-1\n\nSartre went so far as to suggest that art without an underlying, activist philosophy was worthless. An authentic writer would always be advocating for a set of beliefs, ideals, or actions. Sartre called this a commitment, not only to the art form but to humanity.\n\nIn a famous set of essays, What is Literature? published in 1948, Sartre develops the concept of ‘committed literature’. His basic premise is that writing is a form of action for which responsibility must be taken, but that this responsibility carries over into the content and not just the form of what is communicated.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, p. 13\n\nBy communicating through art, existential thinkers of\n\nthe past and present aim to reach the mass audience — moving existentialism\n\nfrom university philosophy departments to the general public. Using art\n\nto reach the public illustrates trust in the public, an egalitarian view\n\nof philosophy.\n\nArt therefore has not simply been a pleasant and less demanding tool\n\nwith which to disseminate and explore ideas; it has been part of the\n\nExistential ‘concern’.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 10\n\nPolitics of Freedom\n\nPhilosophy is political, and most political theories\n\nhave been shaped by philosophy. Existentialism’s lack of a unified set\n\nof principles and its emphasis on individualism might imply that it is\n\nsomewhat removed from public political action.\n\nExistentialism might seem a refuge from politics. The focus on the subjective\n\nindividual would appear to make any consideration of politics and political\n\nactivity irrelevant.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 12\n\nExistentialism, however, is often associated with politics.\n\nThe political existentialists tended to be “leftist” during the twentieth century. These men and women felt compelled to be political, to act based on their ideals.\n\nCamus, Sartre, and even Nietzsche were involved in various wars because they believed passionately in fighting for the survival of their nations and peoples. The politics of the existentialists and their colleagues varies, but each seeks the most individual freedom for people within a society.\n\nLibertarianism and Existentialism\n\nLibertarianism is as often misunderstood as existentialism. There are libertarian socialists and libertarian anarchists. However, libertarianism in the United States and other Anglo-American cultures is most often associated with variations of Austrian economics.\n\nExplorers will find I write on classical liberalism, existentialism, and the rhetoric of fiction. The variations within existentialism and libertarianism make the thinkers interesting to study. Their use of storytelling in argumentation makes their writings interesting to me.\n\nBecause of this emphasis on radical individualism, existentialism\n\nis sometimes compared to Ayn\n\nRand’s objectivism (a mistake, generally) or political libertarianism. Like existentialists, Rand and her followers used the arts to further a philosophy. However, objectivism claims there are basic, universal truths of human nature and experience. Rand’s works and objectivism embody a neo-liberal philosophy of personal self-interest and, by some, of greed. Most of the existential thinkers of the twentieth century are associated with left-leaning democratic socialism and even communism. Yes, this is also contradictory on its face, reflecting the complexity of any attempt to unravel existentialism.\n\nWilliam Irwin has argued that existentialism and libertarianism\n\ncomplement each other, particularly in his book The Free Market Existentialist: Capitalism without Consumerism. As Irwin notes, because many contemporary philosophers and scholars view existentialism in terms of the French political philosophers Sartre, Camus, and de Beauvoir, it is difficult to consider neo-liberalism and classical liberalism as complementary to existentialism.\n\nIt’s Time To Embrace Free-Market Existentialism!\n\nCapitalism provides the most choices and opportunities for philosophical self-definition.\n\nWilliam Irwin | December 30, 2015\n\nA friend of mine was “horrified,” as he put it, when I told him about what I had planned in connecting existentialism and capitalism. He warned me that any other self-identifying existentialist would be horrified as well. What he could not tell me was why.\n\nI define existentialism as a philosophy that reacts to an apparently absurd or meaningless world by urging the individual to overcome alienation, oppression, and despair through freedom and self-creation in order to become a genuine person. Existentialism is a philosophy of action, not of wallowing in despair. It is stoicism without quietism.\n\n— It’s Time To Embrace Free-Market Existentialism; Irwin, Reason.com\n\nThough Irwin’s quip relating existentialism to stoicism is intentionally provocative, his overall argument is that individualism defines existentialism and, within current political realities, libertarianism has a similarly deep commitment to the individual. Both existentialism and libertarianism also assume some limits on that individual freedom for the sake of society. As philosophers differ on what constitutes individual freedom, so do “liberals” from the breadth of neo-liberalism. Most libertarians turn to John Stuart Mill, but can Mill be reconciled with existentialism? Is this any more extreme than how the words of Hegel and Kant have been extended? Irwin attempts to reconcile existentialism and libertarianism through the radical individualism of each.\n\nThe main link between existentialism and libertarianism is individualism. In both systems of thought, the individual is primary and the individual is responsible.\n\nLibertarians have long recognized the importance of strong property rights in securing autonomy, and existentialists have long recognized the importance of choosing meaning and subjective values for oneself in developing authenticity. One sense does not necessarily imply the other, but they do fit together well. Existentialists emphasize the importance of subjectively choosing one’s values and making one’s meaning, and libertarians champion the individual’s prerogative to live in any way that does not cause harm to others.\n\nExistentialism and libertarianism both value freedom and responsibility. As with individualism, the sense of freedom characteristic of existentialism is not exactly the same as the sense of freedom characteristic of libertarianism, but they are not foreign to each other.\n\n— It’s Time To Embrace Free-Market Existentialism; Irwin, Reason.com\n\nThe political existentialists of the twentieth century embraced socialism and communism because they viewed capitalism as dehumanizing, pitting one social class against another even with meritocracy sorting groups. Granted, as in the case of Sartre, this required ignoring the brutal nature of Soviet communism and other Marx-inspired nations. The “evils” of capitalism were more obvious to philosophers than the likely (and real) outcomes of systems that require one group of administrators to determine what is best for all citizens. The left-leaning philosophers did not anticipate the lack of personal freedom that followed centralized planning. That planning, however “scientific” or “methodical” failed, but the loss of freedoms endured.\n\nIrwin address the perceptions of capitalism throughout his text on “free-market existentialism” and argues that capitalism is disliked because philosophers assume the masses are easily manipulated and controlled. To dislike capitalism, you have to assume the consumers and workers are either less intelligent than the educated who critique the system or controlled in some other way. Irwin argues that you cannot assume capitalism has power to control people while other systems do not. He does not suggest capitalism is perfect, but that it allows for bad personal decisions to allow equally good personal decisions.\n\nOne of the great concerns of the political left is that capitalism makes us into mindless drones who simply buy and consume. Of course capitalism provides circumstances that make it easier for a person to live that way, but capitalism can’t make you do anything. It is possible to have capitalism without consumerism. Existentialism is actually the ideal balancing agent, the perfect accompaniment to capitalism, allowing us to reap the benefits of a free market while encouraging us to resist crass consumerism.\n\nFear of capitalism and free markets is just fear that people can’t be trusted to think and act for themselves.\n\n— It’s Time To Embrace Free-Market Existentialism; Irwin, Reason.com\n\nThis debate is unlikely to be resolved, though Irwin’s suggestion that the academic elites (at least in the humanities) are predisposed to dislike capitalism is supported by statistical profiles of academic disciplines. Marx lives on in academic departments Irwin notes, though rarely in economics programs.\n\nBeliefs of Existentialists\n\nThere were and are scholars\n\nof theology associated with existentialism. The most famous might be Kierkegaard; other theologically inclined thinkers include Karl Barth, Martin\n\nBuber, Gabriel Marcel, Reinhold\n\nNiebuhr, and Paul Tillich. Too often people link a lack of faith or secular beliefs with existential ideals.\n\nExistentialism is about being a saint without God; being your own hero,\n\nwithout all the sanction and support of religion or society.\n\n— Anita Brookner (b. 1938), British novelist, art historian.\n\nInterview in Writers\n\nat Work, Eighth Series, ed. George Plimpton (1988).\n\nExistential thinkers as diverse as Kierkegaard and Sartre were not concerned with which beliefs (or unbelief) someone held, but instead the existential thinkers worried that too many people accept the values of community leaders uncritically. Nietzsche worried about following the “herd” instead of establishing personal beliefs and values.\n\nThe “angst” of existential freedom arises, at least partially,\n\nfrom the impulse to develop beliefs and values independently of a community.\n\nNot everyone feels the need intellectually or emotionally to develop his\n\nor her own beliefs; Nietzsche suggests only a handful of individuals are capable of such independence. And, for the theistic existentialists, one can still decide religious values are authentic for his or her existence.\n\nThe accompanying table illustrates the range of ideals\n\nexpressed by the major existentialists. Not every existentialist follows\n\na perfect row in the grid. In particular, their political theories are\n\nmore varied than the three categories listed.\n\nReligious Predetermination Elitist Moralistic Intentions Agnostic Chance Communist Relativistic Actions Atheistic Free Will Anarchist Amoralistic Results\n\nThe first row might represent the writings of Blaise Pascal or Fyodor\n\nDostoevsky, both of whom defended fundamentalist religious beliefs, including their inherent contradictions. The last row is representative of Jean-Paul Sartre’s writings, if not his own beliefs. As previously stated, uniting the men and women behind this matrix of concepts is futile. Their thoughts are linked by a belief that this life is a near-futile struggle against forces aligned in opposition to the individual.\n\nThe Existentialists\n\nThe individuals listed represent major contributors to\n\nexistentialism and related philosophies. This chart is in philosophical\n\norder, not in the order of publication or life. Following the chart is\n\nfurther information on other existentialists or contributors to the philosophy.\n\nI would like to thank site visitor Eduardo Tenenbaum for his suggestions for this chart. This chart has been revised several times, based on further readings and suggestions from site visitors.\n\nName\n\nPhilosophy / Faith Contribution Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\nEastern Orthodox Russian novelist. Studied individual will, freedom,\n\nand anguish. Several of the characters created by Dostoevsky explore\n\nexistential issues of freedom and self-determination. Many of these\n\ncharacters are criminals. Søren Kierkegaard\n\nExistentialist;\n\nProtestant Theist Danish theologian and philosopher. Sometimes considered\n\nthe first existentialist, Kierkegaard’s works were popularized by Heidegger.\n\nFormulated the aesthetic, ethical and religious as modes of existence. Perhaps best known for describing the “leap of faith” required of Christians in modern circumstances. Friedrich\n\nNietzsche\n\nIndividualist;\n\nAnti-Christian German philosopher and philologist (classicist). Ideas\n\ninfluenced Heidegger and Sartre. Developed concepts of Will-to-Power,\n\nEternal Recurrence and Overman. Georg W. F. Hegel\n\nGerman Idealism;\n\nProtestant German idealist philosopher and social theorist. Influenced\n\nMarx, Husserl, Sartre, and many others. Hegel’s followers broke into\n\n“left” and “right” wings. First to promote the concept of phenomenology. Edmund Husserl\n\nPhenomenologist Austrian-born German philosopher and mathematician.\n\nExplored the subjective and objective nature of human experience. His\n\nmathematical training influenced his philosophical writings. Developed\n\nconcept of essences and being. Also, the concept of the Lifeworld Martin Heidegger\n\nPhenomenologist, Existentialist;\n\nTheist German philosopher and curiously metaphysical thinker\n\nwho disavowed metaphysics. Assistant to Husserl, wrote about Kierkegaard’s\n\nworks. Argued that confronting the question of the meaning of being,\n\nencompassing one’s own death, was central for an authentic human existence.\n\nProclaimed the end of metaphysics. Franz Kafka\n\nAbsurdist;\n\nJewish Austrian short story author, known for his depictions\n\nof absurd situations and illogical justice. Like Camus, Kafka admired\n\nthose who rebelled against the natural absurdity of existence. Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nExistentialist;\n\nAtheist French philosopher, playwright, and novelist. Student\n\nof Heidegger, colleague and lover of de Beauvoir. Likely the most influential\n\nfigure in existentialism. Gabriel\n\nMarcel\n\nHumanist;\n\nRoman-Catholic French contemporary of Sartre, attempted to craft a\n\ndefinition of existentialism that allowed for faith. Simone de Beauvoir\n\nExistentialist;\n\nAtheist French writer, existentialist, and feminist. Best known\n\nas a “feminist” writer, she was the editor of many of Sartre’s works.\n\nLover of Sartre, friend to Camus and Merleau-Ponty. Maurice Merleau-Ponty\n\nPhenomenologist, Existentialist;\n\nTheist French philosopher and educational theorist. One-time\n\nfriend of Sartre, Camus. Supporter of Husserlian Phenomenology. Affirmed\n\na reality beyond what humans could comprehend. Albert Camus\n\nExistentialist, Absurdist;\n\nAtheist French-Algerian author and journalist. Resistance member\n\nduring WWII with Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, de Beauvoir. Brought “humanism”\n\nto his existentialism. Karl Jaspers\n\nExistentialist;\n\nAgnostic, Theist German psychiatrist, philosopher, and theologian. Contemporary\n\nof Sartre, Camus, et al. Jaspers sought to make philosophy more open\n\nfor the general public… more relevant.\n\nOther Thinkers of Note\n\nOther figures important to understanding existentialism\n\ninclude:\n\nJean Wahl (1888–1974), French scholar\n\nNicolas Alexandrovich Berdyaev (1874–1948), Russian Neo-Romanticist\n\nJosé Ortega y Gasset (1883–1955), Spanish writer\n\nMiguel de Unamuno (1864–1936), Spanish philosopher\n\nLeo Isakovich Shestov Schwarzman (1866–1938), Russian Irrationalist\n\nQuestions to Ponder\n\nPhilosophy and religion exist to answer “why?” when we\n\nwant an excuse for human nature. Maybe science will explain away sociopaths\n\nand even mere anger someday. We can treat depression, anxiety, mania, and\n\nnumerous other “disorders” with pills. Alienation, despair, and anguish\n\nmay vanish. If they do, what of existentialism? Do humans need their pain?\n\nIs suffering what makes us stronger, as Nietzsche suspected?\n\nSome questions posed by the thinkers profiled on this\n\nsite:\n\nIf something worth living for is worth dying for, what about something\n\nnot worth dying for? (Camus)\n\nDid man create God to have a reason to live? (Dostoevsky)\n\nDoes society make women and men different or do we choose our roles?\n\n(Beauvoir)\n\nWould living forever add meaning to life? (Heidegger)\n\nHow do you really act in private? (Sartre)\n\nWithout love, without people, what is a person? (Kafka)\n\nAs this short review of concepts demonstrates, the label existentialist is applied broadly. Even these concepts are not universal within existentialist works, or at least the writings of people groups as the existentialists. There is no one or two sentence statement summarizing what more than a dozen famous and infamous people pondered. The only common factor seems to be “despair.”\n\nMajor Criticisms\n\nUnderstand, I don’t claim to be an “existentialist” but\n\nrather a rhetorician with an interest in existentialism’s influence on\n\nthe arts. While I agree with some of the criticisms of existentialism and\n\nits leading proponents, my primary interest is in broader existential questions,\n\nwhich are often at the core of great literature. Seldom is a good story\n\nabout a community — great stories tend to be about one individual trying\n\nto define his or her purpose in life. But, the criticisms should be discussed\n\nso readers are aware of complaints against existentialism.\n\nThere Is No Existentialism\n\nThe charge there is no clear “existentialism” is a fair\n\ncomplaint, since only a few people ever embraced the term officially during\n\nthe first half of the twentieth century. There is no one formal existential\n\nprogram, unless you start and stop with Jean-Paul\n\nSartre. Even then, Sartre was constantly revising his own thoughts on the matter. Existentialism often finds itself excluded from “serious” discussions of philosophy because it seems fleeting — and even anti-philosophical.\n\n… Sartre, while delivering a public lecture on Existentialism, at the\n\nsame time wanted to claim it for technicians and philosophers alone.\n\nOn the other hand, philosophy as a discipline has often had scant regard\n\nfor Existentialism, and Bertrand Russell famously omitted Heidegger (and\n\nHusserl) from his History of Western Philosophy. Hence Existentialism would appear to fall between two stools, appropriated by many who otherwise have nothing to do with philosophy, while itself wishing to shun these in preference for an embrace from Philosophy proper.\n\n—Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 22\n\nAlienated from Others\n\nAmong the criticisms of existentialism is that many of\n\nthe celebrated figures were alienated from their own families, friends,\n\nand communities. This personal alienation resulted in a psychological need\n\nto rationalize their personal isolation, according to some critics. Kierkegaard, Kafka, and Nietzsche had unusual relationships with the people closest to them, certainly. No one describes Sartre and de\n\nBeauvoir as a model couple. Camus also struggled with various relationships.\n\nDid a set of alienated thinkers develop a philosophy\n\nthat celebrates awareness of alienation as a sign of intelligence? If so,\n\nthe implication is that these thinkers wanted to validate themselves and\n\ntheir own failed social connections.\n\nLimits of Free Will\n\nBelief in pure free will would require rejecting all\n\nscience or embracing the narcissistic view that some individuals are inherently\n\nsuperior. If free will is constrained by a number of factors, then existentialism\n\nrests on a faulty foundation according to some critics. Most psychiatrists\n\nlong ago rejected notions of unconstrained free will.\n\nAdvancements in science have revealed the limits of “free\n\nwill” and the human brain. Neurology, psychiatry, and other disciplines\n\nsuggest a range of human conditions such as bipolar disorder, obsessive\n\ncompulsion, depression, attention deficit, and others are physical in origin.\n\nThe physical cause might be neurological damage or genetic mutation, but\n\nthe cause is still beyond “free will.” Evolutionary psychologists, sociologists,\n\nbehavioral economists, and other researchers suggest some behaviors are\n\nadaptations that help the human species survive.\n\nAnarchy, Nihilism, and Fatalism\n\nEspecially among various radical groups and students,\n\nexistentialism is associated with anarchism, nihilism, and fatalism. The\n\ncriticism that existentialism can lead someone to these radical political\n\nmovements is correct only insofar as people have found ways to co-opt Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and other existential thinkers. It is correct that misguided individuals use works associated with existentialism to justify political violence.\n\nHowever, the philosophers and writers associated with\n\nexistentialism present extremely complex analyses of rebellion and resistance\n\n— certainly not fatalistic views of social order. Having lived through\n\nWorld War II, the French existential figures Camus, de\n\nBeauvoir, and Sartre offered nuanced writings and speeches on revolutionary movements.\n\nWhen existentialism is associated with anarchy, this\n\nis not the anarchy of theory, in which people evolve into a cooperative\n\nsociety without the need for governmental, organizational controls. Instead,\n\nthis is the political movement that gained prominence in Europe during\n\nthe early twentieth century, particularly in Mediterranean nations. The\n\nmost famous anarchists’ movement is in Spain, tracing its history to the\n\nSpanish Civil War, but anarchists are influential in Greece, Italy, and\n\nsouthern France. The anarchists seek the violent overthrow of governments\n\nthey believe to be obstacles to equality and freedom.\n\nThe violent protests of anarchists, a common event at\n\ninternational economic conferences, pale in comparison to the goals of\n\npolitical nihilists. Associated with pre-Revolutionary Russia, nihilism\n\ntakes the belief that life is meaningless to an extreme. Originally the\n\nnihilists sought an embrace of science and logic, rejecting Romanticism.\n\nThey also rejected German Idealism. Eventually the movement was overtaken\n\nbe people who believed only the complete and total destruction of current\n\norder could free mankind. When people discuss nihilism and existentialism,\n\nthey are suggesting the extreme belief that society as it is must be destroyed\n\nto free people from traditions and beliefs that serve no purpose.\n\nFatalism is the most extreme political movement associated,\n\ncorrectly or not, with existentialism. Fatalism doesn’t assume a reconstituted\n\nsociety will be better, as anarchism or nihilism do. Fatalism calls for\n\nthe permanent, total destruction of humanity because life and existence\n\nis meaningless. The radical fatalist kills because killing quickens the\n\nend of humanity. Some fatalists seek to start larger conflicts, convinced\n\nwars and terrorism prove that mankind is unworthy of even an absurd existence.\n\nWhat is Not Existential?\n\nLacking one answer to what is “existential,” I am going\n\nto present what is not in an attempt to clarify things through the fog (a reference to Camus). By understanding what existentialism excludes, discussions of what might be included become somewhat clearer. Generally, what we consider existentialism does not support any of the following:\n\nThe “good life” in classical terms, such as a philosophical key to\n\nwealth, pleasure, or honor.\n\nA traditional embrace of social approval and social structure, trumping\n\nthe individual.\n\nA Tao-like acceptance what is, and accepting “being” as enough in life.\n\nA belief, or even faith, that science can and will make everything\n\nbetter.\n\nThe utopian ideal that people are good by nature, ruined by society\n\nor external forces.\n\nThere are, according to existentialism and its predecessor,\n\nphenomenology, some problems with Western philosophical traditions. The\n\nbasic problem is that humans are not good, sharing, generous creatures.\n\nChildren are what we remain our entire lives… greedy, manipulative, brats.\n\nSome people disguise it better than others. The people in charge of America\n\nwould be the people in charge of most countries: the best “political” people.\n\nOr, as one 60s radical said, “There were eventually leaders in every commune.”\n\nWatch a preschool class. I owned a children’s bookstore,\n\nand before that I was a teacher. Children are not nurtured to behave poorly\n\n— the challenge is to socialize a child. We struggle to be social creatures.\n\nSociety is unnatural. Rules are difficult.\n\n“Mine” is naturally a child’s way of thinking. It is\n\nsoon followed by “I didn’t do it!”\n\nExistentialism requires the active acceptance of our\n\nnature. Robert G. Olson noted that we spend our lives wanting more and\n\nmore. Once we realize the futility of wordly desire, we try to accept what\n\nwe have. We turn to philosophy or religion to accept less. We want to detach\n\nfrom our worldly needs — but we cannot do so. It is the human condition\n\nto desire. To want. To seek more, even when that “more” is “more of less.”\n\nIt is a desire to prove something to ourselves, as well as others.\n\nThe existentialists … mock the notion of a complete and fully satisfying\n\nlife. The life of every man, whether he explicitly recognizes it or not,\n\nis marked by irreparable losses. Man cannot help aspiring toward the\n\ngoods of this world, nor can he help aspiring toward the serene detachment\n\nfrom the things of this world which the traditional philosopher sought;\n\nbut it is not within his power to achieve either of these ambitions,\n\nor having achieved them to find therein the satisfaction he had anticipated.\n\n— An Introduction\n\nto Existentialism; Robert G. Olson, p. 14\n\nExistentialism assumes we are best when we struggle against\n\nour nature. Mankind is best challenging itself to improve, yet knowing\n\nperfection is not possible. Religions present rules, yet the believers\n\nknow they cannot live by all of those rules. The “sin-free” life is beyond\n\nhuman nature. Is that any less reason to try to be good, generous, caring,\n\nand compassionate? Perfectionism is considered unhealthy by psychiatrists\n\nfor a reason.\n\nThe Struggle\n\nThe word “existential” is used to describe so many people,\n\nfictional characters, choices, and situations that it has been reduced\n\nto meaning any dilemma revealing the true nature of a person. The notion\n\nof dilemma reduces “existential” to an adjective describing too many common\n\nchoices. Existentialism properly defines a broader philosophy, in which\n\nlife itself is a choice.\n\nWhy is Buddhism Not Existential?\n\nSiddharta Gautama was appalled by suffering and chaos\n\nin the world. So much so, he left his wife and son to meditate on the meaning\n\nof everything. Unfortunately, he didn’t find answers among the gurus. There\n\nwere no easy answers. In some ways, yes, Siddharta experienced an “existential”\n\ndiscovery: life is suffering.\n\nBut, Siddharta did not follow the existential notion\n\nof openly and physically rebelling or fighting to establish a meaning.\n\nHe did not openly challenge people and political leaders. Instead, he took\n\na different approach:\n\nWhen he met his first disciples at Benares after his enlightenment,\n\nthe Buddha outlines his system, which was based on one essential fact:\n\nall existence was dukkha. It consisted entirely of suffering; life was\n\nwholly awry. Things come and go in meaningless flux. Nothing has permanent\n\nsignificance. Religion starts with the perception that something is wrong.\n\n[…] The Buddha taught that is was possible to gain release from dukkha\n\nby living a life of compassion for all living beings, speaking and behaving\n\ngently, kindly and accurately, and refraining from anything like drugs\n\nor intoxicants that cloud the mind.\n\n— A History of God; Karen Armstrong, p. 32\n\nUnlike the existentialists, Siddharta is a stoic in nature:\n\naccept things as they are, don’t try to change them or control them. Curiously, the\n\nBuddha is rebellious in that his response rejects social norms. Siddharta was rejecting the Hindu teachings of his time, much as Kierkegaard challenged the ritualized nature of Christianity. But, Siddharta was not an “active” rebel (though all choices are active choices). He was, in many ways, teaching a passive resistance that the existentialists would reject.\n\nSources\n\nAppignanesi, Richard, and Oscar Zarate. Introducing\n\nExistentialism.
