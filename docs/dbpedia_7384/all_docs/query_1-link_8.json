        "text": "FRANCE got over the epochal disturbances of May 1968 quickly enough; Jean‐Paul Sartre has never got over them. They came without warning and stripped him of both his authority and his public. Ever since 1945 his had been the most rousing and intelligent voice to be heard on the French left. He might have the superior brain and vocabulary of a professional philosopher, but he saw himself too as the people's tribune. The political analyses and recommendations that tumbled so urgently from his restless mind were far too abstruse for the people; but there is no shortage of middleclass radicals in France and it was they, the young ones particularly, who soaked up whatever Sartre had to say. In all that time he had no rival as the director of progressive consciences; Andre Malraux had switched from left to right politically and gone in for active Gaullism; Camus had begun stoutly as a quieter, more responsible alternative to Sartre but had faded badly by the time he was killed in 1960.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Sartre made France think. He was the Left Bank intellectual. He had influence but, as he now admits, no power. His influence was largely upon the uninfluential because the political programs he envisaged were too reckless and extreme ever seriously to cross the mind of a practicing politician. Sartre's precise whereabouts on the left were usually something of a puzzle. Was he or wasn't he a Marxist? Officially not. He demanded a revolution, if only because revolution spells ruin for the bourgeoisie, that traditional bugbear of generations of French Romantics; but he never joined the Communist Party, and if he had, he would most likely have been drummed out of it within the week for failing to toe the party line. For Sartre is a compulsive heretic. He has read too much Hegel; he can't set eyes on a thesis, even a thesis of his own, without at once searching around for its antithesis. His existentialism, which is the one more or less systematic philosophy that has marked him permanently, goes deep. Existentialism teaches that where there's life there's change, that not until we are dead does anyone have the right to say who we were or what we stood for.\n\nToday, at the age of 72, Sartre is still struggling to evolve and to come to terms with May ‘68. He is nearly blind, and his writing days are over, but he can still think and still change his mind. We should salute such resilience. But no matter what he does now, he will never again impose himself as he did in the 1950's and 60's. His last fling was to accept the editorship of the banned Maoist paper La Cause du Peuple, and to challenge the Government to have him arrested. That was the final test of his pre‐eminence, but it fizzled out. The young may respect him now, but they won't listen to him. He is too senior, too wordy and too impractical to recruit fresh disciples in an age in which political styles are freer and more concise than they were. Nowadays a few well‐placed graffiti make better party propaganda than vast abstract manifestoes of the kind Sartre was best at.\n\nHe knows he is something of an anachronism but says that it doesn't depress him. Whether it depresses him or not, he has very obviously tried to modernize his politics so as to suit them to the 70's, and the spectacle is often embarrassing. In “Life/Situations” (which is a very competent translation of the volume published in French as “Situations X”), he proclaims what must be the hollowest, most speculative creed even he has put his name to: that of “libertarian socialism.” It sounds, so far as it goes, all very friendly, the pipe dream of some geneal anarchist. Under libertarian socialism, were it ever to come about, we poor alienated Westerners could expect to lead miraculously candid and useful lives. There would be no more exploitation of one person by another, no more government, no more secrets to come between us. Life would be one long love‐in.\n\nSo has Sartre, once the hard man of the apocalyptic left, finally gone soft? Not entirely, there is iron in his soul yet; if any violence needs to be done to an unwilling bourgeoisie before it is frog‐marched off into this classless future, he for one will welcome it. He will never make his peace with that part of society he is so aggrieved at having been born into; Sartre remains a bourgeois whose one hope of self‐respect is to bite the class that fed him.\n\nSalvation is out of the question, because to be saved you must be working‐class. The People, for Sartre, are born virtuous and remain virtuous; they don't even have to try. But where, today, are the People? Sartre seems unable to find them. Certainly People and proletariat are no longer one and the same, because the proletariat has let Sartre down. It has allowed itself to be “serialized” by its bourgeois masters; that is, to be treated as so many limp, innocuous units when it should have been banding together to win power by violence. So, weary of looking around him for signs that History is moving his way, Sartre looks far, far ahead to an impossible future, where he can just make out the People in the form of a mysterious New Man, whose speci fication he has at least taken the precaution of drawing up himself.\n\n“Life/Situations” contains four pieces written by Sartre himself: one on the case for Basque autonomy in Spain and on the virtues of decentralization generally; one on French Maoists, which starts with the perverse but typical disclaimer, “I am not a Maoist”; one on the contrast (and how forced it is) between the two kinds of justice — wicked, middle‐class lawyers’ justice, and good, instinctive popular justice; and one on the reasons for not voting in French elections. Some of the polemic is as stinging as of old, but much of it is tired, opportunistic and even sentimental.\n\nThe second, more encouraging half of the book contains three interviews with Sartre: one concerned with his giant, unfinished study of Flaubert, “The idiot of the Family”, one with his dilatoriness in coming out in favor of women's liberation, conducted by his liberated but constant companion, Simone de Beauvoir; and one with the way he saw himself in 1975.\n\nThis last, a “Self‐Portrait at Seventy,” is by far the longest of the interviews and the most sympathetic. It rambles but it rambles interestingly. It is never intimate, but it does look into Sartre's private life now and again: into his fondness for music, his carelessness about money (he has made a lot, spent a lot and sometimes given it away), the reorganization of his time now that he can no longer see to read. But mostly it is taken up with Sartre's ideas, both those he has discarded and those he has revised in answer to what he takes to be new circumstances. Sartre has not written everything he planned to write, but he claims to have said all he ever wanted to say. He feels no regrets; he has no sense of failure. The interview ends on a peal of “wild laughter.” But is all this cheerfulness real, or is it just a brave front? There are some terribly negative moments too, as when Sartre breaks out: “As far as the state of French politics goes, I don't see a lot I can do. It's so ro?ten what's happening in France now! And there's no hope in the immediate future; no party offers any hope at all....” The tone, then, is of an old man both naive and fiercely disappointed.\n\nHe is confident—and rightly so—that, whatever his present eclipse, people will read his books long after he is dead. The question is whether they will read the right ones, the ones he would like them to read, the didactic tomes of politics and philosophy rather than the plays, essays and novels. Sartre is ashamed of having been a writer and not a doer. Writing is a bourgeois habit, and to write well, with “good style,” is to make a bad habit worse. He has often tried deliberately not to write well, to let the words come and to censor nothing. But it is the well‐written books that people will come back to. For every doughty crypto ‐ existentialist who flogs himself through “Being and Nothingness” in the year 2001, dozens more will turn with pleasure to “Nausea,” that waspish and original novel which he wrote in his unregenerate prewar days as a mere individualist; or to “The Words,” an ideally elegant and amusing piece of autobiography, at fault only in being so short; to the literary essays; and even to “The Idiot of the Family,” which, among much that is unbelievable or incomprehensible, contains the most brilliant and memorable things so far written about Flaubert. History, supposedly the friend of all true Marxists, may play Sartre the unkind trick of registering him not, as he would like, as a thinker, but as a writer. I am quite sure, for my part, that it will."
