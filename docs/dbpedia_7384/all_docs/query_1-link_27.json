        "text": "February 1, 2020\n\nI was on the side of the author from the get-go because I have long believed that this is a topic both worthy of discussion and criminally neglected, but the fact is that it deserves a better book than this. Part of it is Sartre's own fault for using a vocabulary that is ridiculously difficult to parse, but Remley doesn't clarify much, preferring to more or less paraphrase Sartre's ideas while largely using the same vocabulary. I would also have liked to have seen Sartre's ideas related to modern-day anarchism and the ideas of the Occupy movement, horizontalism, direct democracy, and consensus, in order to demonstrate its continued relevance, rather than relating it to Bakunin and Proudhon, who undoubtedly influenced Sartre but who did not deserve the extensive attention they receive here (even though the book provides a good introduction to their ideas, it's hardly the remit implied by the title).\n\nSartre's description of the development of human organizations - from series to fused group to pledged group to institution and atrophy via bureaucratization - is an invaluable guide to understanding how hierarchical societies, political parties, and revolutions develop and eventually fail. It is simultaneously a coruscating critique of capitalism and Leninism. For this reason alone it is an invaluable sociological tool that deserves wider dissemination and understanding. Sadly, I think that while this book is a small step in the right direction, it is too academic to be of any great help to those who need it most."
