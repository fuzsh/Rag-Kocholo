Keywords : The Father, Theme, Characterization\n\n3. Introduction \"The Father\" is a short story written by Björnstjerne Björnson. The story was about a man who fathered a boy named Finn. Since Finn was born, the man went to the priest four times. Each time he went to the priest, he always asks for different favor on his son's behalf. In this story, the author uses a relationship between father and his son as the main theme.\n\n4. Biography Björnstjerne Martinius Björnson was born in December 8th, 1832, in Kvikne, Norway. He was the son of a pastor, grew up in the small farming community of Romsdalen. He was a poet, dramatist, novelist, journalist, editor, public speaker, theatre director, and one of the most prominent public figures in Norway. He was awarded The Nobel Prize for Literature in 1903. He died in Paris, France April 26th, 1910.\n\n5. Summary of the story \"The Father\" was about a man named Thord Overaas who fathered a son named Finn. Since Finn was born, the man came to the priest four times to ask for a different favor. The first time he came, he asked to baptized his son by himself. The second time that he came, he asked for his son to stand first in the communion. The third time that he came, he asked for the banns to be published to his son marriage. The last time he came to the priest, he donated all of his wealth after the death of his son.\n\n6. discussion 1. Theme The major theme of this story is family while the minor theme is a relationship between a father with his son. The story revolves around how the father always asks the priest something on the behalf of his son. He loves his son very much it seems like an obsession because he would ask for many favors to be able to make his son seems powerful. \"I did not wish to pay the priest until i heard what number the boy would have when he take his place in church to-morrow\" \"He will stand number one.\"\n\n7. discussion 2. Characterization 1. The Father / Thord Overaas : Thord was an arrogant and proud man. He shows it throughout the story when he directly asks the priest if he could baptize his son by himself, if his son would stand first in the communion and that the priest published the banns for his son marriage. He was also fearless, for asking all these favors. However, following the death of his son, he changed. He was not that arrogant, proud and fearless man anymore, he became kind, thoughtful and generous. He sold his farm and donated the money to the poor. \"I have something with me that i should like to give to the poor; I want it to be invested as a legacy in my son's name.\"\n\n8. discussion 2. The Priest : The priest was a good man, as he wished that Finn would become a true blessing for Thord. However, the priest represented someone who bows down to someone who has authority. Thord was a wealthy man and when he came to the priest for asking his favor he also paid the priest and the priest himself did everything Thord asked him. At last he also declared that Finn truly brought a blessing to Thord referring to when Thord sold his farm and donate his money for the poor. \"He will stand number one.\" \"So i have heard, and here are ten dollars for the priest.\"\n\n9. discussion 3. Finn Overaas : Finn was dependent on his father because his father used to give him everything even when he did not ask for. It is tragic that he lost his life on his way to make the wedding arrangement. He was a happy man who was about to marry the richest girl in town."
