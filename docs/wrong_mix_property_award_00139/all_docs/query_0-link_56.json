On Tuesday morning, May 17 1904, the Bjornson 'bautasten [obelisk],  which had been placed on the North Dakota Agricultural College grounds, near Old Main, was unveiled.  This Obelisk is in honor of Bjornstjerne Bjornson (1832-1910), the great Norwegian writer and statesman, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1903.
