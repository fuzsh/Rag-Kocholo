        "text": "The aim of this collection is to make possible the forging of a more robust, politically useful, and theoretically elaborate understanding of working-class literature(s). These essays map a substantial terrain: the history of working-class literature(s) in Russia/The Soviet Union, The USA, Finland, Sweden, The UK, and Mexico. Together they give a complex and comparative – albeit far from comprehensive – picture of working-class literature(s) from an international perspective, without losing sight of national specificities. By capturing a wide range of definitions and literatures, this collection gives a broad and rich picture of the many-facetted phenomenon of working-class literature(s), disrupts narrow understandings of the concept and phenomenon, as well as identifies and discusses some of the most important theoretical and historical questions brought to the fore by the study of this literature. If read as stand-alone chapters, each contribution gives an overview of the history and research of a particular nation’s working-class literature. If read as an edited collection (which we hope you do), they contribute toward a more complex understanding of the global phenomenon of working-class literature(s)....Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nIn this article, we compare the phenomenon of working-class literature in Sweden and the United States. After examining how working-class literatures have evolved in both countries, we analyze how they have been conceptualized in two academic fields: contemporary U.S. working-class studies and the study of Swedish literary history. We discuss the material and historical contexts shaping these conceptualizations, critique them on theoretical grounds, and offer ways that comparative approaches help us better understand the phenomenon of working-class literature. Our main argument is that our analysis makes visible two important features of this literature. The first of these, inscribed in the very concept of the term, is that working-class literature is both a literary phenomenon and a phenomenon relating to working-class life. The second feature – a far less obvious, but not less important one – is that working-class literatures are always historically and geographically situated and, thus, assume divergent shapes in different times and locations. We argue that working-class literature as a phenomenon is, therefore, always in a process of new formations. In doing so, we move away from narrow nationalistic views of working-class literature as a defined term and, using a comparative approach, allow for new vantage points in the analysis of the relationship between class and culture.\n\nDownload\n\nThis chapter deals with genre concieved as rhetorical action and cognitive schema associated with an exigence or social need, calling for utterance and action. Genres in this sense are chronotopes, permeated with addressivity and instruments of knowledge, interpretation, and communication rather than taxonomic systems. This concept of genre will be further illuminated by the example of early Swedish working-class fiction as a new literature of low-brow hybridicty and multigeneric origin, created by autodidactic authors without conventional education and cultural prestige. Focus will be on how this fiction came into generic being in the early 1900s’ by combining narrative traditions in the margins of classic realism, symbolism, and protomodernisms of the day. The aim of the chapter is to find out how addressivity and form-shaping ideologies are generated out of such blendings, how cognitive schemata are set at work, and how generic worlds as chronotopes will mediate the themes.\n\nDownload\n\nIn: Socialist Imaginations. Utopias, Myths, and the Masses. Eds.: Stefan Arvidsson, Jakub Benes & Anja Kirsch. Abingdon, Oxon & New York: Routledge, 2018. Pp. 116–166, 2018\n\nIn the late 1800s, various ideas of Socialism had spread in Sweden. Simultaneously, questions of religion, Christianity, and the Church were urgent, engaging even advocates of socialism. Yet, the resistance to both Christianity and Socialism was considerable, and reconciling the two was a delicate matter. This essay studies the intriguing interaction between Socialism and Christianity in Swedish prose fiction of the early 1900s, especially devotional narratives and working-class fiction. At issue is the tension between spiritual-idealistic and economic-materialistic tendencies, how the handling of this tension is depicted, and what imaginations of Socialism and Christianity this depiction testifies to. The analysis shows that the borders between Christian and socialist imaginations were not clear-borders between Christian and socialist imaginations were not clear-cut.\n\nDownload\n\nStudia Neophilologica, 2020\n\nThe conference ‘Is Economic Inequality also a Literary Problem?’ held at Uppsala University, Sweden, in 2017 raised the following questions: What does literature have to do with inequality? Does it contribute to its reproduction, or can it be a force of resistance? Is it fair to even ask of literature and literary studies that they address the problem of economic inequality? This essay claims the answers to these questions are conditioned by the historical contexts of the critics grappling with them and the literatures that they study. Employing an analysis of the theme of poverty in contemporary Swedish-language working-class literature, I argue that the consecration of this literature as an important strand in Swedish national literature has allowed it to express radical critique of the economic inequalities lying at the heart of capitalism. Furthermore, I argue that this insight could be used as a starting-point for challenging some of the more pessimistic views expressed by critics of working-class literature regarding its political potentials.\n\nDownload\n\nThis research paper tends to trace the origin and development of the mature proletarian revolutionary novel. The mature revolutionary proletarian novels will be discussed and highlighted in this study in terms of Marxist hermeneutics This new literary kind did not come into being prior to the imperialist era because the socioeconomic requirements for this literary genre were non-existent and the proletarian movement did not enter into its decisive historical stage of development. This new genre of the novel appeared simultaneously in the works of Robert Tressell, Martin Anderson Nexo, Upton Sinclair and Maxim Gorky in the beginning of the twentieth century. In this era of imperialism, the proletarian novel came into existence, when the socio-historical ethos brought the proletarian movement into being as well as helped to organise and develop it on international level. At the end of this analytical and comparative study of them, the noticeable point is that the proletarian novels of that period share astonishing similarities with one another. Applying Marxist literary hermeneutics to the art of novel writing of the famous proletarian novelists, this research paper will try to introduce new portrait of the personages of the novels of these proletarian novelists in an innovative perspective.\n\nDownload\n\nThe Journal of Working-Class Studies, 2019\n\nThis article discusses the tradition of Swedish working-class literature and the relationship between taste and class. First, I analyze the representation of this relationship in Swedish working-class writer Ivar Lo-Johansson's novel Kungsgatan [King Street] from 1935. Thereafter, I discuss the whole tradition of Swedish working-class literature-in which Lo-Johansson's novel occupies a central position. This tradition constitutes a challenge to received ideas about class and taste, mainly because its consecration as a central strand in Swedish literature and its dissemination to a mass audience in the working class make it problematic to uphold conventional distinctions between popular/working-class and high/bourgeois culture. Finally, I argue that the challenging of these distinctions is not only a key to a better understanding of Lo-Johansson's novel, but it also shows that Swedish working-class literature can serve as a catalyst for re-theorizations within working-class studies of the relationship between class and taste as something that is historically specific, rather than universal.\n\nDownload\n\nIn a recent meeting between the Polish prime minister, Beata Szydło, and her Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Polish prime minister promised to clamp down on anti-Semitism in Poland.
