        "text": "Every time a Norwegian athlete wins an international competition and the national anthem is played, we think of Bjørnson.\n\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson was the eldest of six siblings, born on a minister’s farm way up in a steep Norwegian valley. Few, if any, before him have been given the name Bjørnstjerne. He wasn’t too fond of school, but from early on he had a huge, passionate involvement he needed to share – first with his fellow townsmen, then with the nation, Europe and the whole world.\n\nRevolution and Freedom\n\nIn 1848, at the early age of 15, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson was already engrossed in events happening in faraway places. Inspired by the French Revolution in 1848 he wrote his first credited newspaper article in the local newspaper, entitled «Freedom’s Speech to the People of Molde». It was an ardent call to the citizens of the small coastal town of Molde to celebrate the Norwegian Day of Constitution. Norway was in union with Sweden, and that put a damper on the Norwegians’ celebration. Young Bjørnson thought that freedom should be celebrated no matter what.\n\nAuthor and Orator\n\nBjørnson continued writing, and he had his debut with the story of Synnøve Solbakken – a story from his contemporary society in 1857. He was very concerned about country life and farmers’ conditions. If Norway were to become a sovereign nation, we had to rely on our farmers and their knowledge. Bjørnson’s writing was often an entry in the ongoing public debate. He promoted smaller and larger issues about peace, equality, civil rights and minorities’ rights.\n\nNorwegian and European\n\nBjørnson’s home, the farm Aulestad, is beautifully situated on a hillside in the middle of inland Norway and was often a centre of events, because Bjørnson himself was smack bang in the centre of events – in Norway, the Nordic countries and Europe.He was often out traveling and stayed for longer periods at several places in Europe. His plays were performed on many European stages. His articles were published in European newspapers.\n\nNational Anthem\n\nBjørnson wrote stories, novels, plays, articles, speeches and letters. Best remembered today are probably his poems, that many composers have written tunes to. Ja, vi elsker dette landet («Yes, We Love This Country») is the most famous of all. This poem is the history of Norway in eight verses, and it is Norway’s national anthem. Every time a Norwegian athlete wins an international competition and the national anthem is played, we think of Bjørnson.\n\nWomen and Women’s Emancipation\n\nBjørnson was the author of his time who most often chose female main characters in his books and plays, which often had women’s names in the title. His literary women meant a great deal to many female readers, because Bjørnson gave women’s sentiments and experiences a central part in his works. This was no matter of course in his time, and young researchers still analyze how Bjørnson regarded and portrayed women.\n\nA Beheading and a Suicide Bomber\n\nAs a nine year old Bjørnstjerne was forced to witness the execution of a young man who was accused for murder. Bjørnstjerne’s father was a minister, and on the minister’s farm Bjørnstjerne became acquainted with the accused. He had a strong feeling that the young man was innocent. Much later Bjørnson wrote about this experience in the story Et stygt barndomsminne(«A Horrid Childhood Memory»). Was this the origin of Bjørnson’s strong sense of justice that followed him throughout his life and his works? And is his character Elias Sang in the drama Over evne II («Beyond Human Power II») the first suicide bomber in the literature?\n\nSynnøve and Bollywood\n\nBjørnson’s debut novel Synnøve Solbakken has often been criticized for romanticizing farm life and being national romantic. Is it? The unhappy love story between farm girl Synnøve and peasant boy Torbjørn appeals to many young people with immigrant backgrounds. The tradition where parents choose their childrens’ spouse is broken. Love conquers in the end. The story has a lot in common with classic films from both Hollywood and Bollywood, according to researchers.\n\nHappy Endings and Nobel Prize\n\nBjørnson’s works are influenced by his belief in the future and in progress, and most of his novels and dramas have a «happy ending». This satisfied Alfred Nobel’s statutes for the Nobel Prize for Literature, and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson was granted this honorary distinction in 1903 for his entire authorship.\n\nAmnesty Aulestad\n\nBjørnson’s motto was Fred er ei det beste, men at man noe vil! («Peace is not the ultimate; wanting to achieve something is»). An encouragement that is just as relevant today - in Frankfurt, in Norway and all over the world. Engagement will always be modern. New causes emerge, but engagement must subsist. It has been said about Bjørnson that he was Amnesty International with his main office at Aulestad 70–80 years before Amnesty International was founded. We need Bjørnstjernes in our time.\n\nLiterature and Nature\n\nIn close vicinity to Lillehammer, a town that today is known for literature, sports and nature, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson lived on the picturesque farm Aulestad. To experience this unique artist’s and Nobel Prize laureate’s home is definitely worth a visit."
