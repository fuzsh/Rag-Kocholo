Full message:

"As I write down these words, a mixture of gratitude and sadness fills my heart. After fighting for more than a year to get back on the court, I have to accept that I will not be able to play basketball anymore. So now, the time has come to announce my retirement, and I want to thank all of you who have supported me in the last years.

They say every athlete's journey is made from passion, sweat, and perseverance. My story was no different. But as life often teaches us, it is not without challenges. A knee injury forced me to retire earlier than expected. The time has come to say goodbye to the basketball court, a place that has been my sanctuary for almost my whole life. This journey, filled with highs and lows, victories and defeats, has been incredible.

To each organization I got to play for: I will be forever thankful for the opportunities and honored to have played in your jerseys. Also, a huge thank you to everyone working there - your work "behind the scenes" is impressive, and without you giving everything every day we players would not be able to perform.

To all the coaches I was given the opportunity to work with: I'm deeply grateful for being able to learn from and work with you.

To my fellow teammates: Thank you! The battles we fought, the victories we celebrated, and the laughter we shared will forever stay in my heart.

I want to thank all the fans for your cheers and support. Playing in front of you and achieving remarkable victories - I will never forget that feeling.

Dear Family and Friends, I want to thank you for your unwavering support. Your unconditional encouragement and faith in me have meant the world.

To my wife Viktoria, your love, understanding, and sacrifices have been my rock throughout my career. You've supported me through everything.

As I step away from the court, I carry with me the lessons that basketball has taught me - the importance of teamwork, the value of dedication, and the beauty of pushing yourself beyond limits.

Thank you, basketball and everyone who has been part of this journey - you've made it unforgettable.

As this journey ends, a new one begins - let's see where it takes me."
