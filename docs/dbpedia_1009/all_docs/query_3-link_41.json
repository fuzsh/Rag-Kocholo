        "text": "Now that is what you call a top game! 6,500 spectators in the sold-out Audi Dome certainly got their money’s worth from the encounter between FC Bayern Munich and medi bayreuth on the 20th matchday of the easyCredit German Basketball League. That was in no small part due to an outstanding display by the team of Head Coach Raoul Korner, which traded blows with Munich’s star ensemble in a high-class game and ended up losing only by the narrow margin of 88:96 (42:43).\n\nAfter medi took the lead for the first time, the league leaders had their best spell. Two quick buckets from downtown were followed by another from Danilo Barthel to give Bayern what would be its highest lead of the entire encounter (15:4 in the 4th minute). However, the Heroes Of Tomorrow kept in touch with two threes by York to make it 10:15 in the 6th minute. Although the home side then found it easier to score, medi also made its mark, with Gabe York cutting the gap to 20:26 after a pass from Amaize.\n\nRobin Amaize quickly halved the six-point deficit after the first period with a bucket from beyond the arc. Bastian Doreth also scored from outside on his return to his old club, forcing Munich to call its first timeout midway through the quarter. The Heroes Of Tomorrow also remained attentive after that and gave as good as it got. The reward: Assem Marei tied the scores at 39:39 in the 18th minute. The league leaders then went in at half-time with a narrow 43:42 lead.\n\nAs at the start of the encounter, medi bayreuth was again the first to put points on the board after the break, taking a lead that it did not relinquish until the 24th minute. Yet even then, medi was not to be shaken off. After a 3-point play by De’Mon Brooks, the Heroes Of Tomorrow were back in front by 49:47, after which an end-to-end affair ensued. After Bayreuth took its highest lead (54:50 in the 26th minute) after free throws by Robinson, the home side struck back. The momentum changed sides after an alley oop by Cunningham. Anton Gavel was able to equalize on a fast break after a steal and Bayern went into the final period 68:65 in front.\n\nThe Heroes Of Tomorrow also defied the top club for a long time in the final quarter. Many of their moves were channeled through Robin Amaize, who first tied the scores at 78:78 with a three in the 35th minute and then even put Bayreuth 83:81 ahead a minute later. However, Braydon Hobbs hit back immediately by draining a bucket from outside. The league leaders now displayed all their routine, aided by the fact that Bayreuth had reached its team foul limit. In addition, the Heroes Of Tomorrow’s shots no longer dropped as they wanted, with the result that Munich was again able to pull away by ten points at one stage in the final minute."
