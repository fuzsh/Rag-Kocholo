All five authors participated in study screening, selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from trial reports, and provided critical feedback on drafts. Ian Cameron (IC) and Helen Handoll (HH) co‐ordinated the production of the review, contacted trialists and, together with Jenson Mak (JM), revised the protocol. With regular discussion with IC on decisions taken, HH completed the first draft, including data entry and data analyses in Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2014). Ian Cameron and Helen Handoll are the guarantors of the review.\n\nContributions of the authors to the protocol and original review are provided in Handoll 2009.\n\nSources of support\n\nInternal sources\n\nUniversity of Teesside, Middlesbrough, UK\n\nJohn Walsh Centre for Rehabilitation Research, Kolling Institute, The University of Sydney, Australia, Australia\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK\n\nExternal sources\n\nNo sources of support provided\n\nDeclarations of interest\n\nNone of the authors have a conflict of interest. As Ian Cameron was an investigator in three of the included trials, these trials were assessed independently by other review authors.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Maria Clarke for her help with revising the search strategy, providing repeated search updates and her corrections of the references during editorial processing. We thank Joanne Elliott for her support and help, including during editorial processing of the review. We are grateful to the following for helpful comments and insights at the editorial and external review: Clemens Becker, Liz Bickerdike and Cameron Swift. We are grateful to the copy‐editor, Faith Armitage, for her corrections and suggestions for improving clarity. We thank Denise Mitchell for writing the Plain Language Summary.\n\nWe are also grateful to the trial investigators who have, sometimes on several occasions and over the years, provided additional data and clarification of their trials on this topic. For this version of the review, thanks are due to Maureen Ashe, Marta Baroni, Maria Crotty, Yngve Gustafson, Carmelinda Ruggiero, Ingvild Saltvedt, and Yeaing Shyu.\n\nThis project was supported by the National Institute for Health Research via Cochrane Infrastructure funding to the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group.

We relaxed the criteria for multidisciplinary care to explore the inclusion of trials that nonetheless featured a strong component of geriatrician or rehabilitation physician involvement. We included comparisons of different models of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. We also examined 'usual care' and the common care provided, especially in terms of their representativeness of current management, such as early surgery and early mobilisation.\n\nOutcomes\n\nWe restructured the types of outcome measures into main or 'critical' outcomes for presentation in summary of findings tables, other important clinical outcomes and economic outcomes. With the exception of treatment adherence, all of the outcomes collected in previous versions still feature (see Appendix 3). Previously, our primary focus was on one‐year follow‐up, which reflected that recovery from hip fracture is a protracted process. However, there is increasing loss to follow‐up over the year and some evidence of consistency between quality of life and 'poor outcome' (death or deterioration in residential status) at 4 and 12 months (Griffin 2015). Hence, a key shift in our reporting is the greater onus on interim outcome at around four months for quality of life and function outcomes, but particularly for trials conducted in an inpatient setting.\n\nFor the subgroup of trials testing ambulatory rehabilitation only, we also included number of fallers, number of fall‐related hospital admissions and new fractures. This was prompted by considerations of a potential change of emphasis in rehabilitation conducted outside the inpatient setting.\n\nThe selection of outcomes was informed by those listed in the commissioning brief generated from the Cochrane Programme Grant on the management of hip fracture (see Appendix 2).\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nWe updated data collection and analysis to be consistent with methodology presented in Higgins 2011. However, we framed GRADE assessment and production of the summary of findings tables in terms of 'certainty', rather than 'quality', of the evidence. A key change related to Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity, with the clear adoption of better‐defined intervention categories. In the Sensitivity analysis section, we added exploration of pooling using random‐effects compared with fixed‐effect models, and the effects of excluding trials unrepresentative of current interventions and care programmes.\n\nWhen pooling the data in a prespecified exploratory analysis from both settings, we restricted data from the ambulatory setting to supported discharge and home‐based rehabilitation.\n\nDifferences in version published 2009\n\nWe renamed 'outpatient' rehabilitation as 'ambulatory' rehabilitation because the latter term better covers the various settings: home, outpatient department or day hospital.\n\nWe clarified that supervision of multidisciplinary care, particularly in the ambulatory setting, could be by a specialist clinician other than a physician.\n\nWe assessed risk of bias using the tool outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2008).\n\nKeywords\n\nMeSH\n\nMedical Subject Headings Check Words\n\nAged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans;\n\nPICOs\n\nPICOs\n\nPopulation\n\nIntervention\n\nComparison\n\nOutcome\n\nThe PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\nSee more on using PICO in the Cochrane Handbook.\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nFigures and Tables -\n\nSummary of findings 1.
