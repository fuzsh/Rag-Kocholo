Advances in these areas will increase our understanding of past and future Earth system change, including the societal and environmental impacts of this change, as well as deliver significantly improved scientific support to international climate policy, such as the 7th IPCC Assessment Report and the UNFCCC Global Stocktake under the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nTruly conserving with conservative remapping methods\n\nKarl E. Taylor\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 415–430, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-415-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-415-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemapping gridded data in a way that preserves the conservative properties of the climate system can be essential in coupling model components and for accurate assessment of the system’s energy and mass constituents. Remapping packages capable of handling a wide variety of grids can, for some common grids, calculate remapping weights that are somewhat inaccurate. Correcting for these errors, guidelines are provided to ensure conservation when the weights are used in practice.\n\nThe Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) v1.0: a platform for characterizing parametric and structural uncertainty in future global, relative, and extreme sea-level change\n\nRobert E.

The Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS) is a new software package intended to support assessments of global mean, regional, and extreme sea-level rise. An early version of FACTS supported the development of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report sea-level projections.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nComparison of methods to estimate aerosol effective radiative forcings in climate models\n\nMark D. Zelinka, Christopher J. Smith, Yi Qin, and Karl E. Taylor\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8879–8898, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8879-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8879-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe primary uncertainty in how strongly Earth's climate has been perturbed by human activities comes from the unknown radiative impact of aerosol changes. Accurately quantifying these forcings – and their sub-components – in climate models is crucial for understanding the past and future simulated climate. In this study we describe biases in previously published estimates of aerosol radiative forcing in climate models and provide corrected estimates along with code for users to compute them.\n\nUniFHy v0.1.1: a community modelling framework for the terrestrial water cycle in Python\n\nThibault Hallouin, Richard J. Ellis, Douglas B. Clark, Simon J. Dadson, Andrew G. Hughes, Bryan N. Lawrence, Grenville M. S. Lister, and Jan Polcher\n\nGeosci.

It considers the hydrological cycle as three interconnected components, bringing flexibility in the choice of the physical processes and their spatio-temporal resolutions. It is designed to foster collaborations between land surface, hydrological, and groundwater modelling communities to develop the next-generation of land system models for integration in Earth system models.\n\nThe Antarctic contribution to 21st-century sea-level rise predicted by the UK Earth System Model with an interactive ice sheet\n\nAntony Siahaan, Robin S.

Under the low-greenhouse-gas SSP1–1.9 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenario, the ice sheet remains stable over the 21st century. Under the strong-greenhouse-gas SSP5–8.5 scenario, the model predicts strong increases in melting of large ice shelves and snow accumulation on the surface. The dominance of accumulation leads to a sea level fall at the end of the century.\n\nFAMOUS version xotzt (FAMOUS-ice): a general circulation model (GCM) capable of energy- and water-conserving coupling to an ice sheet model\n\nRobin S. Smith, Steve George, and Jonathan M. Gregory\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5769–5787, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5769-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5769-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany of the complex computer models used to study the physics of the natural world treat ice sheets as fixed and unchanging, capable of only simple interactions with the rest of the climate. This is partly because it is technically very difficult to usefully do anything more realistic. We have adapted a climate model so it can be joined together with a dynamical model of the Greenland ice sheet. This gives us a powerful tool to help us better understand how ice sheets and the climate interact.\n\nCoordinating an operational data distribution network for CMIP6 data\n\nRuth Petrie, SÃ©bastien Denvil, Sasha Ames, Guillaume Levavasseur, Sandro Fiore, Chris Allen, Fabrizio Antonio, Katharina Berger, Pierre-Antoine BretonniÃ¨re, Luca Cinquini, Eli Dart, Prashanth Dwarakanath, Kelsey Druken, Ben Evans, Laurent FranchistÃ©guy, SÃ©bastien Gardoll, Eric Gerbier, Mark Greenslade, David Hassell, Alan Iwi, Martin Juckes, Stephan Kindermann, Lukasz Lacinski, Maria Mirto, Atef Ben Nasser, Paola Nassisi, Eric Nienhouse, Sergey Nikonov, Alessandra Nuzzo, Clare Richards, Syazwan Ridzwan, Michel Rixen, Kim Serradell, Kate Snow, Ag Stephens, Martina Stockhause, Hans Vahlenkamp, and Rick Wagner\n\nGeosci.

Gregory, Steven E. George, and Robin S. Smith\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 4299–4322, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4299-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4299-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMelting of the Greenland ice sheet as a consequence of global warming could raise global-mean sea level by up to 7 m. We have studied this using a newly developed computer model. With recent climate maintained, sea level would rise by 0.5–2.5 m over many millennia due to Greenland ice loss: the warmer the climate, the greater the sea level rise. Beyond about 3.5 m it would become partially irreversible. In order to avoid this outcome, anthropogenic climate change must be reversed soon enough.\n\nThe future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Anthony Payne, Eric Larour, Helene Seroussi, William H.

In this work we address the problems arising from a mismatch of the modelled ice sheet geometry with the one used by the climate model. The proposed remapping method reproduces the original forcing data closely when applied to the original geometry and produces a physically meaningful forcing when applied to different modelled geometries.\n\nDocumenting numerical experiments in support of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)\n\nCharlotte Pascoe, Bryan N.

After years of relatively stable hardware, more diversity is arriving. It is possible that this hardware diversity and the pace of change may lead to an inability for modelling groups to manage their software development. This chasm between aspiration and reality may need to be bridged by large community efforts rather than traditional in-house efforts.\n\nDesign and results of the ice sheet model initialisation experiments initMIP-Greenland: an ISMIP6 intercomparison\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Tamsin Edwards, Matthew Beckley, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Andy Aschwanden, Reinhard Calov, Olivier Gagliardini, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Nicholas R.

Here, we build upon our previous work and propose a novel, prediction-oriented k-fold CV strategy for map accuracy estimation in which the distribution of geographical distances between prediction and training points is taken into account when constructing the CV folds. Our method produces more reliable estimates than other CV methods and can be used for large datasets.\n\nAccelerating Lagrangian transport simulations on graphics processing units: performance optimizations of Massive-Parallel Trajectory Calculations (MPTRAC) v2.6\n\nLars Hoffmann, Kaveh Haghighi Mood, Andreas Herten, Markus Hrywniak, Jiri Kraus, Jan Clemens, and Mingzhao Liu\n\nGeosci.

Model Dev., 14, 107–124, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-107-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-107-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetecting extreme weather events is a crucial step in understanding how they change due to climate change. Deep learning (DL) is remarkable at pattern recognition; however, it works best only when labeled datasets are available. We create ClimateNet – an expert-labeled curated dataset – to train a DL model for detecting weather events and predicting changes in extreme precipitation. This work paves the way for DL-based automated, high-fidelity, and highly precise analytics of climate data.\n\nA spatiotemporal weighted regression model (STWR v1.0) for analyzing local nonstationarity in space and time\n\nXiang Que, Xiaogang Ma, Chao Ma, and Qiyu Chen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 6149–6164, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-6149-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-6149-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a spatiotemporal weighted regression (STWR) model for exploring nonstationary spatiotemporal processes in nature and socioeconomics. A value change rate is introduced in the temporal kernel, which presents significant model fitting and accuracy in both simulated and real-world data. STWR fully incorporates observed data in the past and outperforms geographic temporal weighted regression (GTWR) and geographic weighted regression (GWR) models in several experiments.\n\nA new end-to-end workflow for the Community Earth System Model (version 2.0) for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)\n\nSheri Mickelson, Alice Bertini, Gary Strand, Kevin Paul, Eric Nienhouse, John Dennis, and Mariana Vertenstein\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 5567–5581, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-5567-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-5567-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEvery generation of MIP exercises introduces new layers of complexity and an exponential growth in the amount of data requested. CMIP6 required us to develop a new tool chain and forced us to change our methodologies. The new methods discussed in this paper provided us with an 18 times faster speedup over our existing methods. This allowed us to meet our deadlines and we were able to publish more than half a million data sets on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) for the CMIP6 project.\n\nHyLands 1.0: a hybrid landscape evolution model to simulate the impact of landslides and landslide-derived sediment on landscape evolution\n\nBenjamin Campforts, Charles M. Shobe, Philippe Steer, Matthias Vanmaercke, Dimitri Lague, and Jean Braun\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 3863–3886, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-3863-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-3863-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLandslides shape the Earthâs surface and are a dominant source of terrestrial sediment. Rivers, then, act as conveyor belts evacuating landslide-produced sediment. Understanding the interaction among rivers and landslides is important to predict the Earthâs surface response to past and future environmental changes and for mitigating natural hazards. We develop HyLands, a new numerical model that provides a toolbox to explore how landslides and rivers interact over several timescales.\n\nComparative analysis of atmospheric radiative transfer models using the Atmospheric Look-up table Generator (ALG) toolbox (version 2.0)\n\nJorge Vicent, Jochem Verrelst, Neus Sabater, Luis Alonso, Juan Pablo Rivera-Caicedo, Luca Martino, Jordi MuÃ±oz-MarÃ­, and JosÃ© Moreno\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 1945–1957, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1945-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1945-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe modeling of light propagation through the atmosphere is key to process satellite images and to understand atmospheric processes. However, existing atmospheric models can be complex to use in practical applications. Here we aim at providing a new software tool to facilitate using advanced models and to generate large databases of simulated data. As a test case, we use this tool to analyze differences between several atmospheric models, showing the capabilities of this open-source tool.\n\nFast domain-aware neural network emulation of a planetary boundary layer parameterization in a numerical weather forecast model\n\nJiali Wang, Prasanna Balaprakash, and Rao Kotamarthi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 4261–4274, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4261-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4261-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nParameterizations are frequently used in models representing physical phenomena and are often the computationally expensive portions of the code. Using model output from simulations performed using a weather model, we train deep neural networks to provide an accurate alternative to a physics-based parameterization. We demonstrate that a domain-aware deep neural network can successfully simulate the entire diurnal cycle of the boundary layer physics and the results are transferable.\n\nVISIR-1.b: ocean surface gravity waves and currents for energy-efficient navigation\n\nGianandrea Mannarini and Lorenzo Carelli\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 3449–3480, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-3449-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-3449-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe VISIR ship-routing model is updated in order to deal with ocean currents. The optimal tracks we computed through VISIR in the Atlantic ocean show great seasonal and regional variability, following a variable influence of surface gravity waves and currents. We assess how these tracks contribute to voyage energy-efficiency gains through a standard indicator (EEOI) of the International Maritime Organization. Also, the new model features are validated against an exact analytical benchmark.\n\nTopological data analysis and machine learning for recognizing atmospheric river patterns in large climate datasets\n\nGrzegorz Muszynski, Karthik Kashinath, Vitaliy Kurlin, Michael Wehner, and Prabhat\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 613–628, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-613-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-613-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the automated method for recognizing atmospheric rivers in climate data, i.e., climate model output and reanalysis product. The method is based on topological data analysis and machine learning, both of which are powerful tools that the climate science community often does not use. An advantage of the proposed method is that it is free of selection of subjective threshold conditions on a physical variable. This method is also suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of data.\n\nGlobal hydro-climatic biomes identified via multitask learning\n\nChristina Papagiannopoulou, Diego G. Miralles, Matthias Demuzere, Niko E. C. Verhoest, and Willem Waegeman\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 4139–4153, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4139-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4139-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCommon global land cover and climate classifications are based on vegetation–climatic characteristics derived from observational data, ignoring the interaction between the local climate and biome. Here, we model the interplay between vegetation and local climate by discovering spatial relationships among different locations. The resulting global hydro-climatic biomes correspond to regions of coherent climate–vegetation interactions that agree well with traditional global land cover maps.\n\nA run control framework to streamline profiling, porting, and tuning simulation runs and provenance tracking of geoscientific applications\n\nWendy Sharples, Ilya Zhukov, Markus Geimer, Klaus Goergen, Sebastian Luehrs, Thomas Breuer, Bibi Naz, Ketan Kulkarni, Slavko Brdar, and Stefan Kollet\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 2875–2895, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2875-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2875-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNext-generation geoscientific models are based on complex model implementations and workflows. Next-generation HPC systems require new programming paradigms and code optimization. In order to meet the challenge of running complex simulations on new massively parallel HPC systems, we developed a run control framework that facilitates code portability, code profiling, and provenance tracking to reduce both the duration and the cost of code migration and development, while ensuring reproducibility.\n\nAn improved logistic regression model based on a spatially weighted technique (ILRBSWT v1.0) and its application to mineral prospectivity mapping\n\nDaojun Zhang, Na Ren, and Xianhui Hou\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 2525–2539, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2525-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2525-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeographically weighted regression is a widely used method to deal with spatial heterogeneity, which is common in geostatistics. However, most existing software does not support logistic regression and cannot deal with missing data, which exist extensively in mineral prospectivity mapping. This work generalized logistic regression to spatial statistics based on a spatially weighted technique. The new model also supports an anisotropic local window, which is another innovative point.\n\nHigh-performance software framework for the calculation of satellite-to-satellite data matchups (MMS version 1.2)\n\nThomas Block, Sabine Embacher, Christopher J. Merchant, and Craig Donlon\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 2419–2427, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2419-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2419-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor calibration and validation purposes it is necessary to detect simultaneous data acquisitions from different spaceborne platforms. We present an algorithm and a software system which implements a general approach to resolve this problem. The multisensor matchup system (MMS) can detect simultaneous acquisitions in a large dataset (> 100 TB) and extract data for matching locations for further analysis. The MMS implements a flexible software infrastructure and allows for high parallelization.\n\nReverse engineering model structures for soil and ecosystem respiration: the potential of gene expression programming\n\nIulia Ilie, Peter Dittrich, Nuno Carvalhais, Martin Jung, Andreas Heinemeyer, Mirco Migliavacca, James I. L. Morison, Sebastian Sippel, Jens-Arne Subke, Matthew Wilkinson, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 3519–3545, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3519-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3519-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate representation of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes is essential for future climate projections, although some of the responses of CO2 fluxes to climate often remain uncertain. The increase in available data allows for new approaches in their modelling. We automatically developed models for ecosystem and soil carbon respiration using a machine learning approach. When compared with established respiration models, we found that they are better in prediction as well as offering new insights.\n\nA high-fidelity multiresolution digital elevation model for Earth systems\n\nXinqiao Duan, Lin Li, Haihong Zhu, and Shen Ying\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 239–253, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-239-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-239-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article proposes an optimized transformation for topographic datasets. The resulting topographic grid exhibits good surface approximation and quasi-uniform high-quality. Both features of the processed topography build a concrete base from which improved endogenous or exogenous parameters can be derived, and makes it suitable for Earth and environmental simulations.\n\nCPMIP: measurements of real computational performance of Earth system models in CMIP6\n\nVenkatramani Balaji, Eric Maisonnave, Niki Zadeh, Bryan N. Lawrence, Joachim Biercamp, Uwe Fladrich, Giovanni Aloisio, Rusty Benson, Arnaud Caubel, Jeffrey Durachta, Marie-Alice Foujols, Grenville Lister, Silvia Mocavero, Seth Underwood, and Garrett Wright\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 19–34, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-19-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-19-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models are among the most computationally expensive scientific applications in the world. We present a set of measures of computational performance that can be used to compare models that are independent of underlying hardware and the model formulation. They are easy to collect and reflect performance actually achieved in practice. We are preparing a systematic effort to collect these metrics for the world's climate models during CMIP6, the next Climate Model Intercomparison Project.\n\nAutomatic delineation of geomorphological slope units with r.slopeunits v1.0 and their optimization for landslide susceptibility modeling\n\nMassimiliano Alvioli, Ivan Marchesini, Paola Reichenbach, Mauro Rossi, Francesca Ardizzone, Federica Fiorucci, and Fausto Guzzetti\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 9, 3975–3991, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3975-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3975-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSlope units are morphological mapping units bounded by drainage and divide lines that maximize within-unit homogeneity and between-unit heterogeneity. We use r.slopeunits, a software for the automatic delination of slope units. We outline an objective procedure to optimize the software input parameters for landslide susceptibility (LS) zonation. Optimization is achieved by maximizing an objective function that simultaneously evaluates terrain aspect segmentation quality and LS model performance.\n\nCited articles\n\nBaker, A.
