One such indication can be bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, in some cases, the injury can be so severe that it becomes irreversible and creates complex medical decisions regarding life support and the continuation of care when no additional therapeutic options are feasible, particularly in cases of patients who were young and fully functional prior to an acute illness. In cases of full pulmonary replacement with mechanical support and the degree of functionality that can be attained utilizing modalities such as ECMO can obscure the true severity of illness and make end-of-life decisions significantly harder for families and caregivers.

Sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of malignancies, especially they include Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Type Sarcomas (STSNR). Therapeutic management of pediatric sarcomas is challenging. Multidisciplinary approach including chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. The correct management of affected patients can be demanding, especially in terms of preserving a good quality of life (QoL). In the present study we described our experience with a series of patients diagnosed with head and neck non-metastatic sarcoma between January 1995 and December 2020, referred to Pediatric Oncology or to Maxillo-Facial Surgery of University Hospital of Modena and Reggio Emilia.The survivors were asked to complete questionnaires on health-related quality of life (HRQoL; PedsQL and EORTC QLQ-H&N 43). We found satisfactory results in terms of global HRQoL; although outstanding issues persist, such as deterioration in masticatory function, and speech. Long-term sequelae of multimodality treatment may lead to both significant aesthetic-functional and psychosocial implications that need to be further investigate during the whole the care pathway.

However, rare but serious complications have been reported following NP swab acquisition. Here we present a case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation associated with NP specimen collection in a healthy healthcare provider undergoing COVID-19 testing during departmental screening. This response may have been caused by an exaggerated vagal tone triggered by the trigeminocardiac reflex. Less invasive collection methods, such as saliva testing, may be warranted in predisposed individuals.

Such tumors occur more frequently in adolescents or young adults, and their etiopathogenic mechanism is not well established. We report the case of a 20-year-old female with ovarian dysgenesis and female phenotype. A laparoscopic surgery was performed, and ovotestis was discovered. To achieve a histopathological examination, right oophorectomy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of dysgerminoma. In the case of hermaphroditism, mixed germ cell tumors can develop, leading to a more aggressive evolution with bilateral malignancy of the gonads, which requires the removal of both ovotestis. The patient was recalled. A histopathological examination revealed a seminoma, so laparoscopic left oophorectomy was performed. The management of this type of diagnosis primarily involves surgery, minimally invasive interventions being preferred. Not all pathologic conditions are readily identifiable by means of exploratory laparoscopy, as in our patient’s case. We consider that the optimal solution for these patients would be the preservation of fertility via egg donation and embryo transfer; the survival rate of such patients being 97–100%, if the tumor is diagnosed at an early age.

It is the most common malignancy in middle-age and elderly women already suffering from other comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Being a heterogeneous disease, it has variable subtype-specific outcomes and responses towards treatment. Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression are treated with anti-HER2-targeted drugs. With the advent of newer drugs, the usage of HER2 blockade and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer management helps to increase the probability of achieving pathological complete response. We herein present a case of a patient with breast cancer with long-standing CKD and on maintenance hemodialysis where treatment with conventional chemotherapy regimens was a concern and managed with an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC), namely T-DM1, in a neoadjuvant setting. The patient showed a favorable outcome, and the tolerance of T-DM1 in this patient was predictable. This is a first-of-its-kind case report, where T-DM1 was used in a neoadjuvant setting for a patient on simultaneous hemodialysis.

The research methodology consisted of an observational recording of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), which measure pain, stiffness, and physical function. No adverse events or adverse reactions were observed in the 38 patients. Statistically significant improvements in NPRS and WOMAC scores of the affected SI joint were reported after 90 days. The observational data suggests that Wharton’s jelly allograft applications are safe, minimally invasive, and efficacious. They may present an alternative to surgery for patients who fail conservative and procedural management of pain originating from chondral cartilage degeneration of the SI joint.

In the present study, we described a 67-year old woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who developed an infectious disease sustained by Cryptococcus neoformans. Biochemical data documented a decrease in lymphocytes count while clinical evaluation was suggestive on meningeal infection. The microbiological analysis of the serum, using a dilution pattern through the CrAg lateral flow assay (Immy, Norman, OK 73069, USA) detected the antigen of Cryptococcus (dilution 1/1280), and a treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg id) plus flucytosine (100 mg/kg per day orally in four divided doses) were started, showing an improvement of symptoms. This case report suggests that an antigen dilution can be used to perform a rapid diagnosis and to quickly start the pharmacological treatment.

All patients had undergone local broad spectrum antibiotic therapy for at least 5 days with no clinical improvement. After 48–72 h of wash-out they underwent scraping of the superior tarsal conjunctiva for cytological examination of cellular morphology in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The presence of pathogenic microorganisms was detected with this method in 62 of these patients, towards which specific therapy was carried out. Clinical improvement and eradication of microorganisms previously detected by SEM examination were observed in all positive patients over a time between 10 and 49 days. In three patients, no microorganisms were detected, but the presence of inflammatory cells (eosinophils and mast cells) or dry eye findings. This method could be useful to detect the presence of non-isolated microorganisms at common culture tests. The resolution of the infectious keratitis and the eradication of the pathogens at the subsequent cytological examination of cellular morphology in Scanning Electron Microscopy support the validity of the proposed method.

Pediatric health providers with symptoms of PTSD report problems with relationships and general life dissatisfaction as well as and anxiety, depression and burnout syndrome. Aim: The aim of this systematic review was to estimate the risk of developing secondary PTSD among pediatric health care providers as well as all additional contributing factors. In more detail, we investigated the PTSD symptomatology between pediatric health care providers and the extent to which parameters such as the job, gender, department and other factors had an impact on the mental health status of pediatric health care providers. Methodology: We searched all published English papers in PubMed, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library from September to November 2022. We excluded reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as letters to editors. From a total of 748 papers, we included only 12 research articles that met the admission criteria. Results: According to our results, the prevalence of secondary PTSD ranges from 13% to 94%. Burnout, nurses, the female gender, intensive care units, past traumatic life events and a psychiatric history identified as factors contributing to the development of secondary PTSD. Conclusions: Health policy-makers should take the specificity in the working environment of the pediatric sector seriously into consideration, especially emergency departments.

Solitary metastasis in an uncommon site is very rare; therefore, it has not often been reported. Identifying whether a solitary lesion is a metastatic lesion is important because it decisively influences the stage and treatment decisions. We report a series of cases of NSCLC diagnosis with uncommon solitary metastasis. (1) A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with poorly differentiated NSCLC after a bronchoscopic biopsy of a tumor in the bronchus of the right middle lobe. A hypermetabolic lesion was observed in the tail of the pancreas using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and metastasis of NSCLC was confirmed using endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). (2) A 77-year-old man was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma after a bronchoscopic biopsy of a tumor in the bronchus of the left upper lobe. A hypermetabolic lesion was observed in the bilateral lobes of the thyroid gland using PET/CT, and metastasis of the squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed by FNA and cytology. (3) A 79-year-old woman was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma by brushing cytology performed on the apicoposterior segmental bronchus of the left upper lobe. Hypermetabolic lesions were observed using PET/CT in the subcutaneous layer of the right back and the left breast, and metastases of adenocarcinoma were confirmed by biopsies in each lesion. These three patients were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy for stage IV lung cancer. With this case series, we recommend that, when a solitary lesion is observed in NSCLC patients, a tissue biopsy should be performed, even if the lesion is located in an organ where lung cancer metastasis is uncommon.

Here we report a case of sinonasal glomangiopericytoma with orbital extension, infrequently described in the literature. A 50 year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of a right paranasal painless swelling, which appeared 9 months ago and was slowly increasing in size since her first visit. A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor (18 × 25 × 37 mm) centered on the right ethmoidal cells, with adjacent nasal bone erosion and a right orbital invasion. The tumor was removed with a combined surgical approach (endoscopic and trans-sinusal frontal approach) after pre-surgical embolization. Based on the results of the histopathological examination, the diagnosis of a glomangiopericytoma was confirmed. The patient was discharged after one week, and an uneventful long-term follow-up.

It is usually associated with endocrine or metabolic diseases, in the absence of which the lesion is called primary xanthoma. Because of the lack of pathognomonic radiologic and clinical features, they require a differential diagnosis with a broad spectrum of lesions with a varying degree of malignant potential. We describe a case of primary mandibular xanthoma of a 16-year-old girl without typical cutaneous manifestations and alterations in lipid values. The temporomandibular joint involvement at the mandibular condyle is peculiar in the case described here. We present even a qualitative systematic review of the literature on primary xanthoma of the jaws in others to draw up treatment guidelines.

Recently, it has been reported that the Barthel Index (BI) can predict short-term prognosis. This study aimed to distinguish the BI items that can more accurately predict the short-term prognosis of terminal cancer patients from among the other BI items. This study compared the accuracy of predicting the 1-, 2-, and 3-week prognosis of BI and individual BI items in 158 cancer patients who died between January 2018 and June 2020 at the Onomichi Municipal Hospital in Japan. For predicting the 1- and 2-week prognosis, the BI item “feeding” scores of 0/5 and 10 showed higher accuracies (0.766 and 0.715, respectively) than BI scores between 0–15/20–100. For predicting a 3-week prognosis, the BI item “mobility” scores of 0, 5/10, 15 and the BI item “grooming” scores between 0/5 showed higher accuracies (0.627 and 0.614, respectively) than BI scores between 0–35/40–100. BI and individual BI items may be an option for prognostic prediction in terminal cancer patients.

An incidence of 2–21% of overall flap failure is still described. We investigated the roles of volume, length and number of fibula flap segments on flap survival using novel three-dimensional segmentation tools. We also analyzed the role of other possible risk factors. Seventy-one consecutive patients with a follow up of at least three months and who underwent free fibula flap reconstruction in a single center between 2002 and 2022 have been evaluated. A total of 166 fibula segments were analyzed. Malignancies were the main reason of resection (45.1%). In 69% of the cases a reconstruction of the mandible was performed. The flaps were mainly divided in two segments (39%) (range 1–4), with a mean length of 2.52 cm and a mean volume was 3.37 cm3. Total flap failure (TFF) occurred in 12 cases, (16.9%), while partial flap failure (PFF) appeared in 3 patients (4.2%). Volume, length and number of fibula flap segments did not seem to influence flap failure incidence in uni- and multivariate analysis. Reconstruction of the maxilla and use of a recipient vessel different from the facial artery seemed to significantly impact on flap failure. Smoking and previous surgeries showed a higher trend to flap failure, but they did not reach statistical significance. Prospective and multicentric analysis on a wider population should be assessed.

Methods: A total of 83 patients diagnosed with cataract who underwent uneventful phacoemulsification was included. Every patient was examined one week prior to and two weeks after the surgery. Pre- and postoperative assessment included examination of the anterior and posterior segment, keratometry, and optical biometry. Results: The pre- vs. postoperative axial length (AL) mean difference was 0.07 ± 0.18 mm (p < 0.001).The mean difference of the postoperative anterior chamber depth (ACD) vs. preoperative ACD values (1.11 ± 0.50 mm) was also statistically significant (p < 0.001). The linear regression function postoperative central corneal thickness (CCT) = 0.9004 × (preoperative CCT) + 0.0668, where it characterized a reduced positive correlation (R2) of 68.89% between the postoperative CCT and preoperative CCT. The mean pre-/post-operative differences in the K1 values were 0.08 ± 0.38 D, with a statistically significant difference between the two datasets (p = 0.0152). The mean pre/postoperative difference in the K2 values was 0.002 ± 0.58 D (p = 0.4854). Conclusions: ACD deepened significantly postoperatively. Regarding AL, there was a decrease after surgery, and a very good positive correlation between the post and preoperative values. The CCT values decreased with age. The 2.2-mm corneal incision during cataract surgery resulted in a relatively small postoperative residual astigmatism.
