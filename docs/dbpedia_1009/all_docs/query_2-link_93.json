Central to this study is the concept of homotopy types (also known as ∞-groupoids, animas, or spaces), which classify topological spaces up to weak homotopy equivalence. This subject is rich in both computational and structural aspects: On the one hand, it has been a long-term project to compute algebraic invariant of homotopy types, such as homotopy groups and homology groups of a given topological space. On the other hand, it encompasses the ongoing search for algebraic structures within homotopy types.\n\nRecently there have been many fruitful results in understanding homotopy types by using algebraic and higher categorical techniques. Examples include extension of Quillen’s Lie algebra model of rational homotopy types to higher v_n-periodic homotopy types, variants and generalizations of Mandell's results on models of finite type p-complete nilpotent CW-complexes, and significant progress in unstable motivic homotopy theory based on the theory of unstable localisation developed by Bousfield and Farjoun.\n\nWith these latest advances one can study homotopy types from an algebraic point of view by using tools from the theory of operadic calculus, Koszul duality, Goodwillie calculus, higher category theory and higher algebra. We hope to gather experts and early-career mathematicians working in unstable homotopy theory and adjacent fields at our workshop, to communicate these important results, to promote the exchange of ideas and to stimulate future research in this area.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nBenjamin Antieau (Northwestern University / MPIM Bonn)\n\nGregory Arone (Stockholm University)\n\nTom Bachmann (University of Mainz)\n\nShaul Barkan (Hebrew University Jerusalem)\n\nMark Behrens (University of Notre Dame)\n\nThomas Blom (University of Copenhagen / MPIM Bonn)\n\nRobert Burklund (University of Copenhagen)\n\nXiaowen Dong (University of Mainz)\n\nEmmanuel Farjoun (Hebrew University Jerusalem / MPIM Bonn) (tbc)\n\nKathryn Hess (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) (tbc)\n\nGijs Heuts (University of Utrecht)\n\nGeoffroy Horel (Université Sorbonne Paris Nord)\n\nNikolai Konovalov (MPIM Bonn / University of Chicago) (tbc)\n\nAdela Zhang (University of Copenhagen)\n\nOrganisers:\n\nTobias Barthel (MPIM Bonn)\n\nYuqing Shi (MPIM Bonn)\n\nRegistration:\n\nThe registration will follow soon.\n\nContact:\n\nconference$@$mpim-bonn$.$mpg$.$de\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPolicy for the Max Planck Society against discrimination, harassment and violence.\n\nOrganiser(s):\n\nTobias Barthel, Kaif Hilman, Dominik Kirstein and Jonas McCandless\n\nDetails:\n\nProgram and Abstracts of Workshop on \"Dualisable Categories & Continuous K-theory\"\n\nWorkshop on \"Dualisable Categories & Continuous K-theory\", September 9 - 13, 2024\n\nAlgebraic K-theory is an object that sits at the centre of large parts of algebra, geometry, and topology because of its universal role as a receptacle to count other mathematical objects with signs. However, since its invention, a phenomenon often called the Eilenberg swindle - which says that the algebraic K-theory of a category which is too large must necessarily be zero - has been accepted as a fundamental limit to the theory. Recently, Alexander Efimov introduced a construction called continuous K-theory which allows one to make sense of algebraic K-theory of certain large categories known as dualisable categories in a nontrivial way, thus surmounting the problem of the aforementioned Eilenberg swindle. These dualisable categories encompass geometrically interesting and previously inaccessible examples such as sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. This new direction in K-theory has seen many recent advancements such as the rigidity of non-commutative motives by Efimov and the polynomial functoriality of continuous K-theory by Akhil Mathew and collaborators.\n\nIn light of these developments, this workshop aims to bring the community of mathematicians in algebra, topology, and geometry up to speed on the latest results and perspectives spawned by the theory of dualisable categories and continuous K-theory. The workshop will consist of two main lecture series by Alexander Efimov and Akhil Mathew, augmented by multiple exercise sessions, which we hope will allow for the participants to obtain a working knowledge on the subject. There will also be research talks as well as a session of short contributed talks by participants.\n\nMain speakers:\n\nAlexander Efimov (Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem)\n\nAkhil Mathew (University of Chicago)\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMaxime Ramzi (University of Copenhagen)\n\nPeter Scholze (MPIM Bonn)\n\nMaria Yakerson (Oxford University)\n\nRegistration\n\nThe registration is closed as of July 31, 2024.\n\nContact:\n\ndualcat2024$@$mpim-bonn$.$mpg$.$de\n\nSchedule:\n\nThe schedule will follow in due time.

As such they are objects of the physical reality more than they are objects of the mathematical one. For three decades the world of type theories was relatively calm - innovation was largely occurring in the layers of programming above the type theories leading to proof assistants with more and more sophisticated systems for notation, implicit arguments and tactics.\n\nThe discovery of the univalent models led to the addition of new features to the existing type theories as well as to the development of entirely new ones such as cubicaltt. Eventually, these new type theories will become the cores of proof assistants with much more convenient than before environments for formal verification of mathematical arguments.\n\nIt is clear that the only way to ensure that these new proof assistants are reliable - that any proof of “false” in such a proof assistant can be mechanically transformed into a proof of “false” in one of the “consistency standards”, is to have a system where a new proof assistant has to be formally certified using an already certified proof assistant against an already certified formal system before it can become accepted as a reliable tool in pure mathematics.\n\nThe strongest consistency standard available in pure mathematics is ZFC. This means that as a prerequisite for such a certification system we need to have a mathematical theory of dependent type theories that can be formalized in ZFC. At the moment only fragments of this future theory exist. I will give an introduction to my vision of the theory by describing these fragments and pointing out the gaps.\n\nOrganizing committee\n\nMichael Batanin (Macquarie University)\n\nChristian Blohmann (MPIM Bonn)\n\nRalph Kaufmann (Purdue University)\n\nMartin Markl (Czech Academy of Sciences)\n\nRegistration\n\nTo register please usethis registration webform.
