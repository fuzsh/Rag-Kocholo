Our study aimed to assess the potential of IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, TNF, and eotaxin serum levels—as a single clinical tool or combined into a panel—for diagnosing TBI in multiple injured patients. Methods: Out of 110 prospectively enrolled polytrauma victims (median age, 39 years; median ISS, 33; 70.9% male) admitted to our level I trauma center over four years, we matched 41 individuals with concomitant TBI (TBI cohort) to 41 individuals without TBI (non-TBI cohort) based on age, gender, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and mortality. Patients’ protein levels were measured upon admission (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 during routine blood withdrawal using one separation gel tube each time. Results: The median serum levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF exhibited non-similar time courses in the two cohorts and showed no significant differences on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. However, the median eotaxin levels had similar trend lines in both cohorts, with consistently higher levels in the TBI cohort, reaching significance on days 0, 3, and 5. In both cohorts, the median eotaxin level significantly decreased from day 0 to day 1, then significantly increased until day 10. We also found a significant positive association between day 0 eotaxin serum levels and the presence of TBI, indicating that for every 20 pg/mL increase in eotaxin level, the odds of a prevalent TBI rose by 10.5%. ROC analysis provided a cutoff value of 154 pg/mL for the diagnostic test (sensitivity, 0.707; specificity, 0.683; AUC = 0.718). Conclusions: Our findings identified the brain as a significant source, solely of eotaxin release in humans who have suffered a TBI. Nevertheless, the eotaxin serum level assessed upon admission has limited diagnostic value. IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF do not indicate TBI in polytraumatized patients.

However, due to potential deterioration (e.g., in the case of an increasing hemorrhage) during the clinical course, the assessment of injury severity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be challenging. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether and to what extent the worsening of TBI affects the AIS and ISS. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 80 polytrauma patients admitted to the trauma room of our level I trauma center with computed-tomography-confirmed TBI. The initial AIS, ISS, and Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) values were reevaluated after follow-up imaging. Results: A total of 37.5% of the patients showed a significant increase in AIShead (3.7 vs. 4.1; p = 0.002) and the ISS (22.9 vs. 26.7, p = 0.0497). These changes resulted in an eight percent reduction in their TRISS-predicted survival probability (74.82% vs. 66.25%, p = 0.1835). Conclusions: The dynamic nature of intracranial hemorrhage complicates accurate injury severity assessment using the AIS and ISS, necessitating consideration in clinical studies and registries to prevent systematic bias in patient selection and subsequent data analysis.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between acute concussion symptoms and athlete fear avoidance, pain catastrophizing, depression, and anxiety. Anxiety and depression have previously been associated with the number of symptoms after a concussion, but no prior research has examined the possible link between athlete fear avoidance and acute concussion symptoms. Methods: Thirty-four collegiate athletes (mean age = 20.9 ± 1.8 years) were assessed within 48 h of a concussion using the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5, Athlete Fear Avoidance Questionnaire (AFAQ), Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Results showed a significant association between the athlete fear avoidance and the number of concussion symptoms (r = 0.493, p = 0.003), as well as depression and anxiety measured by HADS (r = 0.686, p < 0.001). Athlete fear avoidance and HADS scores were predictors of symptom severity, explaining 41% of the variance (p = 0.001). Athletes with higher fear avoidance tended to report more symptoms post concussion. Conclusions: This study underscores the link between athlete fear avoidance, anxiety, depression, and the severity of concussion symptoms. Administering the AFAQ to assess athlete fear avoidance at the initial assessment of a concussion may be helpful in interpreting the symptoms of an acute concussion.

This study examines the Ventricles to Intracranial Volume Ratio (VBR) as a metric for these changes and its correlation with behavioral scales. Methods: Thirty-one SCHI patients were included. VBR was derived from CT scans at 3, 30, and 90 days post-injury and compared with Levels of Cognitive Functioning (LCF), Disability Rating Scale (DRS), and Early Rehabilitation Barthel Index (ERBI) assessments at 30 and 90 days. Results: Ten patients were excluded post-decompressive craniectomy or ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Findings indicated a VBR decrease at 3 days, suggesting acute phase compression, followed by an increase from 30 to 90 days, indicative of post-acute brain atrophy. VBR correlated positively with the Marshall score in the initial 72 h, positioning it as an early indicator of subsequent brain atrophy. Nevertheless, in contrast to the Marshall score, VBR had stronger associations with DRS and ERBI at 90 days. Conclusions: VBR, alongside behavioral assessments, presents a robust framework for evaluating SCHI progression. It supports early functional outcome correlations informing therapeutic approaches. VBR’s reliability underscores its utility in neurorehabilitation for ongoing SCHI assessment and aiding clinical decisions.

The aim of the present study was to validate the Norwegian version of the clinician and patient Needs and Provision Complexity Scale (NPCS) Needs and Gets. Data on the NPCS from 60 adult patients with traumatic brain injury or atraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and symptoms lasting >5 months were assessed for inter-rater/test–retest reliability and agreement, as well as concurrent validity with the Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ). The clinician NPCS showed good–excellent inter-rater reliability, and the patient NPCS demonstrated good–excellent test–retest reliability. Absolute agreement was moderate–excellent across all clinician and patient items. Concurrent validity was significant, with large correlations between clinician NPCS-Needs and the NIS and FIM total scores, and small–medium correlations between the clinician and patient NPCS-Gets and the NIS and FIM total scores. There were no significant correlations between the NPCS and the CIQ. The study findings support the use of the Norwegian version of the NPCS to assess met and unmet healthcare and support needs for Norwegian-speaking adults with neurological disabilities.
