        "text": "Before Robin Benzing (208-F-1989, agency: BeoBasket) unleashed his scoring excellence in the easyCredit BBL with Ratiopharm Ulm and FC Bayern Munich and 4 years in the best league ACB in Europe in Spain, he first came on the scene in the summer of 2009 at the European U-20. That was so long ago, it wasn’t back in the day, but moreover feels like it was in another lifetime. He was the top player at tournament dominating like a Luka Doncic averaging (22.2ppg), 5.0rpg, 2.0apg, 1.2bpg, FGP: 53.1%, 3PT: 40.5%, FT: 80.0% and showing future NBA players and Euroleague players like Bogdan Bogdanovic, Nemanja Nedovic, Vladimir Lucic and Zoran Dragic who boss was. After that his career took off like crazy as he became a house hold name in Germany putting up great stats with Ulm for 2 seasons and then becoming a sturdy and solid role player for FC Bayern Munich for 4 seasons. He then played in Spain for Zaragoza where he averaged double figures in scoring in 3 of 4 seasons and also played a season in Turkey with Besiktas Sompo Japan Istanbul and last season at age 33 played with Fortitudo Kigili Bologna (Italy-Serie A) putting up potent stats averaging 13.3ppg, 2.5rpg, 1.8apg, FGP: 49.5%, 3PT: 38.5%, FT: 85.3%. He has always been a consistent player in his 17 year career and has played more than 100 games for the German national team and played at 5 European championships, 2 World championships and at the 2021 Olympic games. It is November 22 and Robin Benzing isn’t under contract with a professional team. He may be turning 34 in January 2023, but he still has the offensive qualities that the Fraport Skyliners could use right now.\n\nThere have been times in the last few years where basketball life has been extremely bad for the Fraport Skyliners, but currently it is at an all-time low. The club is currently at 1-6 and are the doormat of the easycredit BBL hanging out in the basement and the door out being seemingly held shut by angry and annoying Giessen fans. Where is Michael Hakim Jordan when you need him most? Well he is head coach at Lafayette(NCAA) and a type of tirade that he let go in 2010 in Frankfurt against his team Phoenix Hagen could help any team now. Phoenix Hagen somehow was saved that season. The Fraport Skyliners definitely aren’t a bad team, but they aren’t a good team either. The only thing that matters right now is achieving wins and somehow trying to get better step by step day by day. Even if they could have won 3 of the 7 games so far, at the end of the day the only thing counts are wins and that is something they are having a lot of difficulty doing. They want to be a good defensive team, but still allow 82 points per game. On offense they are the 17th worst offensive team scoring only 76 points per game. The biggest problem is that they just don’t have the personal to keep up with their competitors and aren’t getting enough firepower. On top of that, they have injury woes at the big man position with guys like Einaras Tubuties and Lorenz Brenneke out. The club got active a few days ago signing experienced American forward Marcus Lewis, but is he the right fit? They probably didn’t have any better candidates. He definitely has proved his scoring capabilities in places like Canada where he did it on a consistent rate for years, Finland where he was the third best scorer in the league, averaged double figures in scoring in the Basketball Champions league and in Poland. But can he keep doing it at a higher level like the easyCredit BBL? The Fraport Skyliners also need support under the boards and that is why a name like Robin Benzing has popped up. But is he the right player now?"
