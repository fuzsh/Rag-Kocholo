        "text": "Abstract\n\nProximal humerus fractures account for about 5% of fragility fractures. These involve a significant burden of disability and a reduced quality of life. This study aims to compare functional results and surgycal outcomes (closed reduction and internal fixation with the internal closure system of the proximal humerus) and the conservative management of proximal humerus fractures by 2-, 3-, 4-parts, in patients older than 55 years. Between January 2017 and April 2019, 65 patients with 2, 3 or 4-part fractures were retrospectively analyzed: 29 patients (5 males and 24 females) with an average age of 70.8±9.9 years treated non-surgically (conservative group (CG)) and 36 patients (11 males and 25 females) with an average age of 66.2±7.1 years treated surgically with plate fixation (operating group (OG)). Using different evaluation scores, we compared the OG and the CG. Through the DASH score we have seen how at 12 months there is a satisfactory result in patients with conservative treatment (p=0.0019). Constant-Murley scale shows no difference between the two treatments (p=0.2300). BARTHEL scale and SST score did not give statistically satisfactory results. Also, after one year of follow-up, patients treated with conservative therapy had a higher improvement in their Range of Motion (ROM) values than patients treated with surgical treatment. The results in terms of pain in NPRS at 3, 6, 12 months are better for conservative groups (p=0,0000). Our findings suggest that conservative treatment in proximal humeral fractures, particularly in multi-fragmented fractures in patients over 55 years of age, designs an excellent alternative to the surgical option."
