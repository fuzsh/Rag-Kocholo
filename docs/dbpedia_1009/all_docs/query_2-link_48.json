        "text": "(ai) it's a race. or how i learned to love when biased, biases, bias top down, ground up. we live in a millennial moment. we truly truly truly do. we are with every day becoming more aware of our universe, our earth, our people, politics, health, education, technology. all of it. we are optimizing for awareness, consciousness. and in this case of awareness we are only now as some like to phrase it, pulling the veil of ignorance away. and so in doing so we also have no one. i mean no one with any credibility to state what for, why, where to, when, who first. all of it. no one. it's a guess. a roll of the dice, so to speak. perhaps you can relate. you reach a point where you become aware (to a certain degree although not completely) of who you are. this is the reason that in previous posts i beat this drum. it is from this place. this intention that all manifests itself. this is the key. our behaviours are in a way the biases that are created through behaviours (data points) along the path to manifesting this root intention. ask yourself what is your intention. by doing so and those around you, you will very quickly determine if you are in synchronicity, or not. flow. when we are in flow. that's when. that's when we are in synchronicity. and oh btw not chemically induced. i.e. it's only in your head. this is not synchronicity. my belief is that life is magnificent as it is. it is beautiful. it is magical. all of that is there to be experienced as a life force. an infinite energy, timeless, unbounded, real, tangible, ever unfolding, ever growing, ever loving. this is synchronicity. so what. big deal. yeah it is. those that are creating the biases, the weights in these models are either in synchronicity or not. most indeed all of us are now and with (ai) uncovering the beginning of how incredibly messy, un-intuitive, illogical, indeed self-destructive, caught up in our own stories, wearing tinted glasses...we (all) are. and then what? huh? whatca going to do 'bout it, huh? what? observation. where our intentions are somehow (and through ai) uncovered, observed we have the ability for the first time to unleash ourselves from the single point of failure which is embedded within our minds and hearts. we will and can observe these antics. and in doing so offer a 'bias' which accelerates our intentions through behaviours and actions as an upgrade to our own sense of humanity. this is the optimistic version of course ;) there are forcing functions. make note of them all. they are everywhere. at all times. influencing. challenging. persuading you otherwise, always. 2023 was the iPhone moment (intentional btw) of OpenAI, everyone everywhere is talking about (ai). take a good hard look as to why. fear. fear of losing. losing $. losing relevance. losing control. losing power. losing popularity. losing. losing. losing. losing. losing, your(self). fear. 2024 synchronicity, there is nothing to fear. https://lnkd.in/eD9WFABk\n\n\"With or without you\". I don't know the details (and likely Mira Murati doesn't either), but does it really matter if it was technically a theft, or just perceptually? From the communications and perspective, while this may feed towards personal ambitions or longings, and get some PR value, the overall impact on the brand will likely be rather net negative. Seems like chasing momentum and traction, putting a bit too much of a reputation at a stake. May not end up well. OpenAI aside, in a broader perspective: 1. The law is far behind. e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g. It needs to evolve to catch up with accelerating peace of change. 2. Same goes for state and majority of our institutions. This needs to rapidly evolve, otherwise states will lose any relevance, giving it up to corporate and tech. Which means untamed capitalism. I had these thoughts a decade ago. FF to today - not much changed, and the tech keeps steamin' faster and faster What y'all think?\n\nIt is reported that the SAG-AFTRA Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) actors’ union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have reached a deal and will end the strike soon. Interestingly, the deal reportedly includes the first-ever protection for actors against artificial intelligence. Apparently, Film and TV producers must obtain consent from actors to create and use their digital replicas, as well as specify how they intend to use that digital likeness. Actors are entitled to compensation at their usual rate for the period of time they would otherwise have been paid for to do the work being performed by a digital replica. Would this set a precedent for other industries in the creative arts? It is also interesting that Hollywood is one of the first few industries in which the widespread use of AI has such a potential adverse impact. I guess when the livelihood of people are at stake, then we should not be so quick to replace them with the use of AI. https://lnkd.in/gvms4dxX #artificialintelligence #ethicalai RHTLaw Asia LLP #hollywood #sagaftra #digitalimaging #livelihoods #actors"
