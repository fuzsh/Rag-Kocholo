A number of studies have examined the measurement properties of these assessment instruments, although most have applied a classical psychometric approach rather than clinimetric principles.55.

Int J Clin Pract. 2012;66:11-5. Over the decades, this scientific discipline has provided instruments for the identification, classification, and temporal distinction of clinical phenomena. The CLIPROM criteria, which consider clinimetric criteria relevant for PROMs, are a recent contribution.1515. Carrozzino D, Patierno C, Guidi J, Montiel CB, Cao J, Charlson ME, et al. Clinimetric criteria for patient-reported outcome measures. Psychother Psychosom. 2021;90:222-32. Unlike classical psychometrics, clinimetrics applies unidimensionality to the assessment of construct validity and uses it to: 1) evaluate whether each item of a rating scale covers unique clinical information, 2) test whether symptoms belong to an underlying syndrome, and 3) determine the extent to which the total score of a tool is a statistically sufficient measure of the severity of the investigated clinical condition.1010.

However, evidence is lacking about its clinimetric validity. In recent years, there has also been a debate about the clinical utility of the PHQ-9. Some authors recommended it as a dimensional assessment of depression,4040. Bianchi R, Verkuilen J, Toker S, Schonfeld IS, Gerber M, Brähler E, et al.

Thus, such controversial issues should be clarified.\n\nThe present study proposes the first clinimetric analysis of the PHQ-9. Based on CLIPROM criteria,1515. Carrozzino D, Patierno C, Guidi J, Montiel CB, Cao J, Charlson ME, et al. Clinimetric criteria for patient-reported outcome measures. Psychother Psychosom. 2021;90:222-32. its main aims were to examine its construct validity using both Rasch and Mokken analyses and to determine the PHQ-9 clinical utility.1010. Bech P.

No exclusion criteria were applied. Participation was voluntary and uncompensated. The age distribution of the participants was as follows: 18-20 years, 344 (9.9%); 21-25 years, 1,060 (30.6%); 26-30 years, 310 (8.9%); < 18 years, four (0.1%), and > 30 years, 183 (5.3%). Age was not reported by 1,497 students, since this information was not made compulsory.\n\nProcedure\n\nAn invitation with a link to the online survey was sent on May 13, 2022 to the institutional email addresses of University of Florence (Italy) students. The online survey was kept active until May 30, 2022. A total of 3,464 students participated, who were instructed about the research protocol (i.e., a brief description of the study, the involved investigators, the duration and content of the survey, the assessment method and time required as well as a guarantee of anonymity). The students provided informed consent to participate via an online form. Due to the need to collect data anonymously, no strategies were applied to limit duplicate responses, although the length of the survey and its limited period of availability likely discouraged this practice. PHQ-9 data were collected from 3,398 participants and analyzed in the present paper. This study, called Mental Health Literacy among students (MATTERS), was supported by the European University for Well-being consortium via the 2021 second call for Seed Funding.\n\nMeasures\n\nThe PHQ-9 is a self-report measure for diagnostic, monitoring, and screening purposes, as well as for assessing depression severity.1717. Kroenke K, Spitzer RL, Williams JB. The PHQ-9: validity of a brief depression severity measure. J Gen Intern Med. 2001;16:606-13.,1818. Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB. Validation and utility of a self-report version of PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study. Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders. Patient Health Questionnaire. JAMA. 1999;282:1737-44. The instrument consists of two parts. The first section investigates nine depression symptoms listed in the DSM-IV: 1) lack of interest, 2) depressed mood, 3) sleeping difficulties, 4) tiredness, 5) appetite problems, 6) negative feelings about self, 7) concentration problems, 8) psychomotor agitation/retardation, and 9) suicidal ideation.1717.

Validation and utility of a self-report version of PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study. Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders. Patient Health Questionnaire. JAMA. 1999;282:1737-44. Respondents are asked to indicate how often they have been bothered by any of these symptoms in the last 2 weeks.1717. Kroenke K, Spitzer RL, Williams JB. The PHQ-9: validity of a brief depression severity measure. J Gen Intern Med. 2001;16:606-13.,1818. Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB. Validation and utility of a self-report version of PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study. Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders. Patient Health Questionnaire. JAMA. 1999;282:1737-44. Each symptom-item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). Because the second part of the scale assesses functional impairment caused by depression, it was not used in the present study and, thus, the total PHQ-9 score was based on the first section alone.1717. Kroenke K, Spitzer RL, Williams JB. The PHQ-9: validity of a brief depression severity measure. J Gen Intern Med. 2001;16:606-13.,1818. Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB. Validation and utility of a self-report version of PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study. Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders. Patient Health Questionnaire. JAMA. 1999;282:1737-44. Total scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutoff points for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.4444. Gilbody S, Richards D, Brealey S, Hewitt C.

Bech P. Clinical psychometrics. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell; 2012.,5151. Mokken RJ. A theory and procedure of scale analysis. The Netherlands: Mouton; 1971. was performed to further assess the PHQ-9 dimensionality or scalability. Mokken analysis was conducted using Stata version 7. The Stata LoevH command was used to compute Loevinger’s coefficients of homogeneity. According to Mokken,5151. Mokken RJ. A theory and procedure of scale analysis. The Netherlands: Mouton; 1971. Loevinger’s coefficients of homogeneity5252.Loevinger J. A systematic approach to the construction and evaluation of tests of ability. Psychol Monogr.1947;61:i-49 between 0.30 and 0.39 are considered acceptable, while a value ≥ 0.40 is a clear demonstration of a rating scale scalability.1010. Bech P. Clinical psychometrics. Oxford: Wiley Blackwell; 2012.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThis study was approved by the University of Florence ethics commission (no. 184, November 23, 2021).\n\nResults\n\nOverall and individual item fit to the Rasch model\n\nRasch model fit statistics are shown in Table 1. A significant item-trait interaction statistic (χ2 = 356.00, degrees of freedom = 81, p < 0.001) was found, thus revealing an initial misfit to the Rasch model expectations ( Table 1, Analysis 1). Misfit to the Rasch model remained after rescoring the disordered response categories ( Table 1, Analysis 2). However, fit to the Rasch model was achieved after adjusting the sample size to 500 respondents (χ2 = 42.22, degrees of freedom = 81, p = 0.999). The summary fit residuals for items and respondents were found to be within the acceptable limits of ± 2.5 ( Table 1, Analyses 1-3). Table 2 shows the Rasch model fit statistics for individual PHQ-9 items. Items 2, 4, 6, and 9 over-discriminated, while items 1, 5, and 7 under-discriminated ( Table 2).\n\nTable 1\n\nModel fit statistics for Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (n=3,398)\n\nTable 2\n\nIndividual item fit statistics for Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (n=3,398)\n\nDimensionality and scalability\n\nSignificant t-tests outside the critical value of 5% were found for opposing residuals, indicating that the PHQ-9 was multidimensional ( Table 1, Analyses 1-3). Mokken analysis showed that the total score had acceptable scalability, with Loevinger’s coefficient of homogeneity being 0.49. As shown in Table 3, individual PHQ-9 items also showed acceptable scalability, with Loevinger’s coefficients of homogeneity ranging from 0.44 to 0.56.\n\nTable 3\n\nMokken analysis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9\n\nLocal dependency\n\nLocal dependency was detected between items 2 (Feeling down, depressed or hopeless) and 6 (Feeling bad about yourself – or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down).\n\nDifferential item functioning\n\nItem 8 (Moving or speaking so slowly that other people have noticed – or the opposite – being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual) showed significant differential item functioning for age. Significant differential item functioning for degree was observed in item 6.\n\nPerson separation reliability index\n\nPerson separation reliability indices ranged from 0.82 to 0.85 ( Table 1, Analyses 1-3), indicating that the PHQ-9 could be reliably used to distinguish between different groups of individuals.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe PHQ-9 was found to have potential clinical utility, despite requiring substantial improvement. Local dependency was observed, and several over- and under-discriminating items were found. Item 2 (Feeling down, depressed or hopeless) had the largest misfit to the Rasch model, probably because it is a compound question, which makes it difficult for respondents to provide precise answers. Because feeling depressed and feeling hopeless might be core symptoms of different clinical pictures,5353. Woźniewicz A, Cosci F. Clinical utility of demoralization: A systematic review of the literature. Clin Psychol Rev. 2023;99:102227. they should be investigated in separate items.\n\nItem 6 (Feeling bad about yourself – or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down) had the same over-discrimination problem. Once again, this is a compound question referring to two different clinical dimensions.5353. Woźniewicz A, Cosci F. Clinical utility of demoralization: A systematic review of the literature. Clin Psychol Rev. 2023;99:102227.\n\n54. De Figueiredo JM, Frank JD. Subjective incompetence, the clinical hallmark of demoralization. Compr Psychiatry. 1982;23:353-63.-5555. Fava GA, Guidi J. Clinical characterization of demoralization. Psychother Psychosom. 2023;92:139-47. Such problematic over-discrimination might be the reason that the PHQ-9 overestimates depression severity, particularly when used as a dimensional measure.5656.

Symptom severity and guideline-based treatment recommendations for depressed patients: implications of DSM-5’s potential recommendation of the PHQ-9 as the measure of choice for depression severity. Psychother Psychosom. 2012;81:329-32. Indeed, it has been observed that, compared to other scales of depression severity assessment, the PHQ-9 is overinclusive in identifying patients with severe depression and underinclusive in identifying those with mild depression.5858. Zimmerman M. Symptom severity and guideline-based treatment recommendations for depressed patients: implications of DSM-5’s potential recommendation of the PHQ-9 as the measure of choice for depression severity. Psychother Psychosom. 2012;81:329-32. The present findings consistently show that the PHQ-9 includes a mixture of over- and under-discriminating items. The challenge lies in establishing appropriate cut-off values, since setting them too low can result in numerous false positive diagnoses of depression, which might result in antidepressant overprescription.5959.

For instance, item 9 (Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way) combines two separate clinical entities (i.e., suicidal ideation and self-harm thinking) into a single question. This could bias responses and become a source of misfit. A rewording of double- and triple-barreled items is needed4242. Christensen KS, Sparle-Christensen M.

Thus, one solution for item 9, for example, would be to split it into two subitems (Thoughts that you would be better off dead and Thoughts of hurting yourself in some way). The local dependency between items 2 and 6 (in line with Christensen & Sparle-Christensen4242. Christensen KS, Sparle-Christensen M. Comparing the construct validity of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) using Rasch analysis. J Affect Disord. 2023;333:44-50.) can be solved by reformulating them. Item 2 might be split into two subitems (Feeling down and depressed and Feeling hopeless), while item 6 needs simplification (e.g., Feeling guilty or blaming yourself).\n\nPaired t-tests of opposing residuals indicated that the PHQ-9 is multidimensional, while Mokken analysis showed that the items and the total score have acceptable scalability, which is an acceptable level of unidimensionality. This confirms the instrument’s conflicting construct validity results, which have been reported in the literature.3636. Boothroyd L, Dagnan D, Muncer S. PHQ-9: One factor or two?

Optom Vis Sci. 2009;86:139-45. The PHQ-9 multidimensionality might be related to the fact that it was found to cover more than one dimension of depression severity. Each item measures a different depressive symptom (e.g., item 1 measures anhedonia, item 2 measures depressed mood, item 3 measures sleep problems, etc.), but all nine items measure the same underlying construct, depression, which explains the acceptable level of unidimensionality in the total score.\n\nTherefore, future studies are needed, although it should be noted that the Person separation reliability indices were acceptable and that the PHQ-9 fit Rasch model expectations after adjustment for sample size. There is, thus, empirical justification for using the PHQ-9 as an overall index of depression, particularly when supplemented by other clinimetric indices, such as the Major Depression Inventory5050.

First, participants were recruited by convenience sampling, thus limiting generalizability of results. Future research using a sample of patients with depression is needed. Second, due to the cross-sectional design, the PHQ-9 incremental and predictive validity could not be evaluated. Third, no other measures of depression were used. In future investigations, depression should be assessed with other PROMs to test the PHQ-9 clinical and concurrent validity.\n\nThe present clinimetric analysis suggests that the PHQ-9 can be used as an overall index of depression, mainly for screening purposes. Substantial revision, particularly in item wording, is needed to improve its construct validity and clinical utility."
