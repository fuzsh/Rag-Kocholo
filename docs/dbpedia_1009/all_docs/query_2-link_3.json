        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nProximal humerus fractures are the third most common fragility fracture (about 5%) and they are associated with a substantial burden of disability and impaired quality of life [1]. Due to the increased life expectancy and the resulting ageing of the population, the incidence and frequency of these fractures is increasing. Most of them take place after the age of 50 [2]. In relation to frequency Roux et al. [3], report that the critical age for this type of trauma is 70 years and affects the dominant arm in 48% of cases. The main cause of this type of fracture in men is in 55% of cases a simple fall and in the remaining 45% a high energy trauma. In women, on the other hand, the percentage of fractures caused by simple falls rises to 82% of cases [3]. The risk factors predisposing to this traumatic event are two: bone fragility (related to the increase in osteoporotic state in women in the postmenopausal period) and the and high energy traumas, especially in the young population [3,4]. Traumatic mechanisms necessary to produce a proximal humerus fracture may be caused by direct trauma or because of an axial load transmitted to the humerus through the elbow or through the hand and forearm posed in extension or with the elbow blocked in extension [5].\n\nThe 20% of proximal humerus fractures requiring surgical treatment. Over the years, several methods have been proposed for proximal humeral fractures treatment but there is currently no universally recognized protocol [6]. The choice of an appropriate treatment depends on the type of fracture, bone quality, deforming forces, surgeon skills, compliance, and expectations of the patient. Most of proximal humeral fractures are undisplaced or minimally displaced and they can be treated conservatively through a period of immobilization with a brace and subsequent cautious mobilization. In 10–20% of cases, fractures can present a significant displaced and a surgical treatment is required. Surgery in combination with proper rehabilitation plays a key role in the patient's recovery activity. The aim of the surgery is to obtain a good bone fragments reduction in order to allow an early rehabilitation as soon as possible. Multiple treatment methods have been used in the surgical management of these fractures including proximal humeral nails (PHN), percutaneous K-wiring (PKW), percutaneous fixed angle locking plates (LP), open reduction and internal fixation with LP and partial or total arthroplasty. So, it becomes necessary to define valid criteria for the selection of patients with certain types of fractures to identify the appropriateness of the type of treatment [[7], [8], [9]]. Nowaday, the treatment of proximal humerus fractures, available therapeutic options and decision-making are still debated. Each type of surgery has advantages and disadvantages, and the treatment should be individualized according to a list of factors including patient characteristics (age, health status, dominant limb, gender, habitus, lifestyle), biomechanical characteristics of the joint (fracture morphology, trabecular and cortical bone quality, cuff function, vascular system integrity) and surgeon preferences. [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]].\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the functional results and the outcomes of operative (closed reduction and internal fixation with the proximal humerus internal locking system) and nonoperative management of proximal humerus fractures in patients older than 55 years. Our hypothesis was that the clinical outcomes of these 2 treatment methods should be similar.\n\n3. Results\n\nIn our case history a total of 65 patients with an average age of 68.5 ± 3.2 were evaluated. Divided into two study groups: the CG treated with conservative treatment was composed of 29 patients (5 males, 24 females) with an average age of 70.8 ± 9.9 years. The OG treated with plate fixation was composed of 36 patients (11 males, 25 females) with an average age of 66.2 ± 7.1 years.\n\nFractures in both groups were evaluated with Hertel's classification: in the first group 5 patients were classified as type 1; 1 patient type 2; 3 patients type 3; 1 patient type 4; 2 patients type 5; 9 patients type 7; 3 patients type 9; 1 patient type 11; and finally, 4 patients type 12. In the second group 3 patients were classified with fracture type 1 according to Hertel; 1 patient type 2; 1 patient type 5; 20 patients type 7; 2 patients type 9, and 9 patients type 12. ( ).\n\nThere are differences between the two groups in terms of DASH score. There is a more rapid improvement in operated patients than conservative treated patients from the third to the sixth month post-operative period, but it isn't statistically significant (p = 0,0520). Instead, there is a statistically significant difference between functional result at 12 months in favor of conservative treated patient (p = 0,0019). (Tabel 2).\n\nThe scores obtained with the Constant-Murley scale have no significant differences between the two groups (p = 0.2300) (Tabel 3).\n\nAt 12 months of follow up the relative Constant-Murley's score were on average of 95.2% ± 12.9 for the conservative treatment, instead of patients in the plate fixation group which presented a Constant-Murley's age related score with an average value of 83.2% ± 18.6.\n\nThe BARTHEL scale shows less level of disability for non-operative group in the 12° month, but this conclusion is not statistically significant (p = 0,1162) and this result was reached slower than the other group. (Tabel 4).\n\nThe SST score shows a better functional outcome for conservative group in the 12° month, but this conclusion is not statistically significant.

(Tabel 6, tabel 7).\n\nDASH, CMS, SST, BARTHEL scores and ROM improved significantly from 1° to 12° months after in both groups (P = 0.001). ( , , , , , , ). None of the patients reported complications in the 12 months of follow-up.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nDespite the high incidence and costs of proximal humerus fractures, there is currently no valid scientific evidence for the best treatment method [17]. Our study is a multidisciplinary analysis in which patients were managed by the same two surgeons, upper extremity specialist.\n\nThe CG was treated by the team of specialists of the Polyclinic “G.B. Morgagni” Mediterranean Foundation, Orthopedics Traumatology and Rehabilitation Unit, (Catania, Italy), where criteria for the choice of treatment type include calcar size less than 8 mm, decomposition of the medial hinge greater than 2 mm, as described by Hertel. Moreover, concomitant decisional elements were the maintenance of the glenohumeral relationship after fracture, due to the risk of subsequent impingement; the presence of relevant comorbidities that contraindicate surgery; the functional demand of the patient (generally lower in elderly subjects). ( a-b-c- d).\n\nThe OG was treated surgically according to decision-making criteria used by the team of specialists of the Orthopedics and Traumatology Unit, A.O.U. Policlinico-San Marco, University of Catania (Catania, Italy). In this center the surgical technique for proximal humerus fractures treatment mainly includes different options such as intramedullary nails, locking plate or shoulder replacement. For this study were selected only patients treated with non-contact-bridging - NCB ® (Plate for the proximal humerus - PH - Zimmer, Inc.; Warsaw, Indiana, USA) plate fixation. The indications provided by Zimmer, for the use of this plate involves the possibility of inserting it with MIS (Minimally Invasive Solution) approach for the reduction of 2-fragments fractures according to Neer; or in Open technique with Deltoid pectoral incision for 2-, 3-, 4-fragments fractures according to Neer. These patients were treated with MIS approach for all fractures from 1- to 4-fragments according to Neer. ( a-b-c-d).\n\nWhen choosing the type of treatment (conservative vs surgical), attention should be paid to medial comminution, varus angulation, and restoration of the calcar. In addition, other criteria used for taking the decision of surgery were age and functional demands of the patient, possible comorbidities, associated with the ASA physical status classification system risk calculation and the degree of fracture displacement.\n\nThe analysis of pain variation (NPRS) leads to a clear reduction of the algic component with both treatment methods. However, starting at T0 from a comparable NPRS value in both treatment groups, from 3 months to one year the reduction of the algic component is certainly greater in patients of the conservative treatment group. This difference could be related to complications associated with the use of plate, such as: intra-articular screw penetration, which was the most reported complication (9.5%), followed by varus collapse (6.8%), subacromial impingement (5.0%), avascular necrosis (4.6%), adhesive capsulitis (4.0%), non-union (1.5%), and deep infection (1.4%). Reoperation occurred at a rate of 13.8%. These data are according to Venkat Kavuri et al. [18] study of the complication of plate fixation. However, in our OG only one patient returned to operating room within first year post treatment.\n\nThe score increasing of the Constant-Murley scale is due, as is the case with the Barthel Index, to the reported decrease in pain, improved autonomy in daily activities and increased joint range. Comparing Constant-Murley's age-related scores, it was found that conservatively treated patients presented an average value of 95.2% ± 12.9, instead of patients in the plate fixation group which presented a Constant-Murley's age-related score with an average value of 83.2% ± 18.6. From this we can deduce how the functionality recovery of the fractured limb, in patients examinated, can be considered “good” for the plate's fixations' patients' group and “very good” in patients treated conservatively. In the plate fixation's group, Constatnt-Murley (good) is significantly reduced compared to the one of conservative treatment's group (very good). This could be attributed to the type of surgery used. In fact, plate fixation with MIS technique may not be enough to allow an anatomically perfect reconstruction, unlike plate fixation with deltoid-pectoral access. The MIS technique creates a reduction, improving the fracture condition but with possible imperfections in the restoration the glenohumeral joint surface. We cannot be sure of this hypothesis as part of the study was conducted during the covid-19 lockdown period when it was impossible to call patients into outpatient clinic and perform a new radiographic examination to confirm it. Therefore, to evaluate the outcomes of some patients in the plate fixation group, the scores were obtained by telephone.\n\nIn our case history, conservatively treated patients have demonstrated a greater improvement in ROM, on all planes of movement, than patients treated with plate fixation. The use of standardized intensive physio kinesitherapy programs in the conservative treatment group should be considered to better explain the greater improvement of this group. While plate fixation group's patients, physical therapy was prescribed and carried out in another rehabilitation center chosen by the patient and in some cases even at home. In addition, the use of MIS technique for even 3-, 4-fragment fractures may also be responsible for reducing the functional outcome in the plate fixation group. The use of a more expanded access with deltoid pectoral incision with Open technique, as indicated by the Zimmer, could have given a better anatomical reduction and improved functional outcome. So, improving surgical technique could possibly lead to better functional outcomes in patients treated with NCB. Or even the use of other minimally invasive techniques such as the use of the Galaxy external fixator created by Manson in collaboration with Orthofix, that is valid in those cases where the aim is to stabilize the fracture and mobilize the shoulder in the shortest time, especially in elderly patients. Even intramedullary nails and reverse shoulder prostheses can give more effective results in certain fractures.\n\nStudy Conclusions of John-Erik Bell et al. [19] was insufficient evidence available to determine whether operative intervention produced better long-term outcomes compared with non-operative management.\n\nBut they found that patients undergoing initial open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) were proportionally more likely to have revision surgery than were patients undergoing initial hemiarthroplasty. Also, Sproul RC et al. [20] in their systematic review of Twelve studies including 514 patients met the inclusion criteria. Analyzing the functional results and complications associated with proximal humerus locking plates, they showed that fixation of proximal humerus fractures with proximal humerus locking plates is associated with a high rate of complications and reoperation.\n\nOn the contrary, according to Zyto et al. [21] there is an indication for conservative treatment even in the case of more complex fractures, particularly in patients over 75 years of age.\n\nFjalestad and colleagues [22] conducted a randomized clinical trial of locked planting versus conservative treatment of 3-, 4- fragments fractures in 50 patients older than 60 years. They found no significative differences in Constant-Murley's score after 1 year of follow up.\n\nK. Okike et al. [23] conducted a comparison of locked plate fixation and nonoperative management in 207 patients over 60 years; in this study the outcomes of plate fixation were like those of conservative treatment, but with higher rate of complications for operative group patients.\n\nThese studies compare plate fixation to conservative treatment in subjects over 60 years of age. In our study, the age range of patients included was decreased to 55 years. According to our results, conservative treatment for proximal humerus fractures in patients older than 55 years would appear to be a valid option, according to conclusions obtained by Olerud et al. [24] in their randomized clinical trial of locking plate and non-operative treatment in patients over 55 years. Although outcomes were better in the operative group, differences did not reach statistical significance, and the operative group's reoperation rate was 30%. Also, Rick J. Sanders et al. [25] get similar results to our study. They show that patients treated non-operatively for a proximal humeral fracture achieve better ROM on midterm follow-up (>1 year) compared with patients treated with a locking plate.\n\nThe use of plate fixation is widely increasing, especially in elderly patients, even without definitive evidence supporting such management. On the contrary, as mentioned earlier, the literature shows that it may be frequently associated with a higher risk of complications related to the surgical procedure and the following need for reoperation. Hanson et al. [26] analyzed data from 124 patients with proximal humerus fracture (75 to one, 60 to two, 23 to three and 2 to four fragments) treated conservatively (average age 63.3 ± 14.8 years) and completed one year follow-up. It showed that the average Constant Murley score was only 8.2 points different from the healthy limb one year after the acute event and the difference in the average DASH score from the baseline assessment was 10.2 points. The authors concluded that it is difficult to demonstrate a significant advantage of surgical treatment over conservative treatment.\n\nConsidering the age above 55 years of the patients in the study, their possible associated comorbidities and the risk of these patients being exposed to a secondary surgery, in according to their residual function demand of the affected limb, it seems that there are no real benefits in the use of plate fixation compared to other minimally invasive techniques or conservative approach.\n\nAn important bias in the study that may have affected the results is the age differences between the two groups: CG treated with conservative treatment was composed of 29 patients (5 males, 24 females) with an average age of 70.8 ± 9.9 years; the OG treated with plate fixation was composed of 36 patients (11 males, 25 females) with an average age of 66.2 ± 7.1 years. (p = 0.0331).\n\nStudy limitations should be considered: like having considered fracture types as a common group in order to have a more numerous samples, without focusing on a single type; the choice of fracture treatment based on clinical judgement; and being a retrospective study. Limited number of samples (65 patients) due to difficulty of collecting data by telephone evaluation of some patients. This obstacle on collecting people and data was caused by SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period, when calling patients to outpatient clinic was impossible. Short follow-up period that was not adequate for obtaining long-term outcomes. These may have underpowered the study.\n\nCertainly, in the future, data will have to be rechecked, patients will have to be recalled and new clinical and radiographic examinations will have to be carried out. This re-evaluation could redefine the data currently available to us and on which our current considerations are based."
