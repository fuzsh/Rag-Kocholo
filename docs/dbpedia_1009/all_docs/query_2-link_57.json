The combination of the observation of a 100 ka periodicity in the new Î´O2⁄N2 record with a MIS5 multi-site multi-proxy study has revealed a potential influence of local climatic parameters on Î´O2⁄N2. Moreover, we propose that the varying delay between d18Oatm and precession for the last 800 ka is affected by the occurrence of ice sheet discharge events.\n\nImplementation of counted layers for coherent ice core chronology\n\nB.

Our 10Be-based accumulation rate is in good agreement with the one associated with the EDC3 timescale except for the warm MIS 9.3 optimum. This suggests that temperature reconstruction from water isotopes may be underestimated by 2.4K for the difference between the MIS 9.3 and present day. The CMIP5-PMIP3 models do not quantitatively reproduce changes in precipitation vs. temperature increase during glacialâinterglacial transitions.\n\nEvidence for a three-phase sequence during Heinrich Stadial 4 using a multiproxy approach based on Greenland ice core records\n\nM.

A precise understanding of the physical mechanism driving this relationship, however, remain ambiguous. By compiling data from 15 polar sites, we find a strong dependence of mean δO2/N2 on accumulation rate and temperature in addition to the well-documented insolation dependence. Snowpack modelling is used to investigate which physical properties drive the mechanistic dependence on these local parameters.\n\nOF-CEAS laser spectroscopy to measure water isotopes in dry environments: example of application in Antarctica\n\nThomas Lauwers, Elise FourrÃ©, Olivier Jossoud, Daniele Romanini, FrÃ©dÃ©ric PriÃ©, Giordano Nitti, Mathieu Casado, KÃ©vin Jaulin, Markus Miltner, Morgane FarradÃ¨che, ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, and AmaÃ«lle Landais\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2149,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2149, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Measurement Techniques (AMT).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater vapour isotopes are important tools to better understand processes governing the atmospheric hydrological cycle. In polar regions, their measurement helps to improve the interpretation of water isotopic records in ice cores. However, in situ water vapour isotopic monitoring is an important challenge, especially in dry places of East Antarctica. We present here an alternative laser spectroscopy technique adapted for such measurements, with a limit of detection down to 10 ppm humidity.\n\nAdvances in conceptual modelling of the variable nature of Dansgaard-Oeschger events\n\nJonathan Ortved Melcher, Sune HalkjÃ¦r, Peter Ditlevsen, Peter L.

The model consists of simplified equations inspired by ocean-current dynamics. We fine-tune this model to capture the Dansgaard-Oeschger events with unprecedented accuracy, providing deeper insights into past climate patterns. This helps us understand and predict complex climate changes, aiding future climate-change resilience efforts.\n\nZEMBA v1.0: An energy and moisture balance climate model to investigate Quaternary climate\n\nDaniel Francis James Gunning, Kerim Hestnes Nisancioglu, Emilie Capron, and Roderik van de Wal\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1384,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1384, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work documents the first results from ZEMBA: an energy balance model of the climate system. The model is a computationally efficient tool designed to study the response of climate to changes in the Earth’s orbit. We demonstrate ZEMBA reproduces many features of the Earth’s climate for both the pre-industrial period and the Earth’s most recent cold extreme- the Last Glacial Maximum. We intend to develop ZEMBA further and investigate the glacial cycles of the last 2.5 million years.\n\nRapid communication: Distribute paleoscience information across the next IPCC reports\n\nDarrell Kaufman and ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1845,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1845, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRather than reverting to a dedicated paleoclimate chapter, knowledge about pre-industrial climate should be further integrated with other lines of evidence throughout the 7th assessment reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nAge, thinning and spatial origin of the Beyond EPICA ice from a 2.5D ice flow model\n\nAilsa Chung, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Robert Mulvaney, Luca Vittuari, Massimo Frezzotti, Antonio Zanutta, David A. Lilien, Marie G. P. Cavitte, and Olaf Eisen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1650,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1650, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe applied an ice flow model to a flow line from the summit of Dome C to the Beyond EPICA ice core drill site on Little Dome C in Antarctica. Results show that the oldest ice at the drill site may be 1.12 Ma (at age density of 20 kyr/m) and originate from around 15 km upstream. We also discuss the nature of the 200–250 m thick basal layer which could be composed of accreted ice, stagnant ice, or even disturbed ice containing debris.\n\nReview article: Melt-affected ice cores for polar research in a warming world\n\nDorothea Elisabeth Moser, Elizabeth R. Thomas, Christoph Nehrbass-Ahles, Anja Eichler, and Eric Wolff\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2691–2718, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2691-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2691-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIncreasing temperatures worldwide lead to more melting of glaciers and ice caps, even in the polar regions. This is why ice-core scientists need to prepare to analyse records affected by melting and refreezing. In this paper, we present a summary of how near-surface melt forms, what structural imprints it leaves in snow, how various signatures used for ice-core climate reconstruction are altered, and how we can still extract valuable insights from melt-affected ice cores.\n\nLocal summer temperature changes over the past 440 ka revealed by the total air content in the Antarctic EPICA DomeÂ C ice core\n\nDominique Raynaud, Qiuzhen Yin, Emilie Capron, Zhipeng Wu, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, AndrÃ© Berger, and Vladimir Lipenkov\n\nClim. Past, 20, 1269–1282, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1269-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1269-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is a lack of reconstructions from Antarctic ice cores of the temperature during the summer, a critical season in terms of solar energy received, preventing a good understanding of the link between Antarctic past climate and astronomically induced insolation changes. Here, the variations in total air content in an Antarctic ice core are found to be correlated to local summer temperatures simulated with a climate model. This tracer can be used to reconstruct past local summer temperatures.\n\nIndicators of Global Climate Change 2023: annual update of key indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence\n\nPiers M.

It is designed to give an authoritative estimate of global warming to date and its causes. We find that in 2023, global warming reached 1.3 °C and is increasing at over 0.2 °C per decade. This is caused by all-time-high greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nShifts in Greenland interannual climate variability lead Dansgaard-Oeschger abrupt warming by hundreds of years\n\nChloe A. Brashear, Tyler R. Jones, Valerie Morris, Bruce H. Vaughn, William H. G. Roberts, William B. Skorski, Abigail G. Hughes, Richard Nunn, Sune Olander Rasmussen, Kurt M. Cuffey, Bo M.

RheinlÃ¦nder, Margit Simon, Giulia Sinnl, Silje Smith-Johnsen, and James W. C. White\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1003,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1003, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a series of spectral techniques to quantify the strength of high-frequency climate variability in Northeastern Greenland to 50,000 ka before present. Importantly, we find that variability consistently decreases hundreds of years prior to Dansgaard-Oeschger warming events. Model simulations suggest a change in North Atlantic sea ice behavior contributed to this pattern, thus providing new information on the conditions which proceeded abrupt climate change during the Last Glacial Period.\n\nAssessment of the southern polar and subpolar warming in the PMIP4 Last Interglacial simulations using paleoclimate data syntheses\n\nQinggang Gao, Emilie Capron, Louise C. Sime, Rachael H. Rhodes, Rahul Sivankutty, Xu Zhang, Bette L. Otto-Bliesner, and Martin Werner\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1261,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1261, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine sediment and ice core records suggest a warmer Southern Ocean and Antarctica at the early last interglacial, ~127 thousand years ago. However, when only forced by orbital parameters and greenhouse gas concentrations during that period, state-of-the-art climate models do not reproduce the magnitude of warming. Here we show that much of the warming at southern mid-to-high latitudes can be reproduced by a UK climate model HadCM3 with a 3000-year freshwater forcing over the North Atlantic.\n\nPreindustrial to present-day changes in atmospheric carbon monoxide: agreements and gaps between ice archives and global model reconstructions\n\nXavier FaÃ¯n, Sophie Szopa, Vaishali NaÃ¯k, Patricia Martinerie, David M. Etheridge, Rachael H. Rhodes, Cathy M. Trudinger, Vasilii V. Petrenko, KÃ©vin Fourteau, and Phillip Place\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-653,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-653, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) plays a crucial role in the atmosphere's oxidizing capacity. In this study, we analyse how historical (1850–2014) [CO] outputs from state-of-the-art global chemistry-climate models over Greenland and Antarctica are able to capture both absolute values and trends recorded in multi-site ice archives. A disparity in [CO] growth rates emerges in the Northern Hemisphere between models and observations from 1920–1975 CE, possibly linked to uncertainties in CO emission factors.\n\nNew estimates of sulfate diffusion rates in the EPICA Dome C ice core\n\nRachael H. Rhodes, Yvan Bollet-Quivogne, Piers R. F. Barnes, Mirko Severi, and Eric W. Wolff\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-19,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-19, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSome ionic components slowly move through the ice by diffusion but the rate of this diffusion, its exact mechanism(s), and the factors that might influence it, are poorly understood. In this study, we model how peaks in sulfate, deposited at Dome C on the Antarctic ice sheet after volcanic eruptions, change with depth and time. We find that the sulfate diffusion rate in ice is relatively fast in young ice near the surface, but the rate reduces markedly over time.\n\nEvaporative controls on Antarctic precipitation: an ECHAM6 model study using innovative water tracer diagnostics\n\nQinggang Gao, Louise C. Sime, Alison J. McLaren, Thomas J. Bracegirdle, Emilie Capron, Rachael H. Rhodes, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Xiaoxu Shi, and Martin Werner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 683–703, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-683-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-683-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctic precipitation is a crucial component of the climate system. Its spatio-temporal variability impacts sea level changes and the interpretation of water isotope measurements in ice cores. To better understand its climatic drivers, we developed water tracers in an atmospheric model to identify moisture source conditions from which precipitation originates. We find that mid-latitude surface winds exert an important control on moisture availability for Antarctic precipitation.\n\nThe Paleochrono-1.1 probabilistic model to derive optimized and consistent chronologies for several paleoclimatic sites\n\nFrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Marie Bouchet, Christo Buizert, Emilie Capron, Ellen Corrick, Russell Drysdale, Kenji Kawamura, AmaÃ«lle Landais, Robert Mulvaney, Ikumi Oyabu, and Sune Rasmussen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2911,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2911, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Paleochrono1 probablistic dating model allows to derive a common and optimized chronology for several paleoclimatic sites from various archives (ice cores, speleothems, marine cores, lake cores, etc.). It combines prior sedimentation scenarios with chronological information such as dated horizons, dated intervals, stratigraphic links and (for ice cores) Delta-depth observations. Paleochrono1 is available under the MIT open-source license.\n\nTotal Air Content measurements from the RECAP ice core\n\nSindhu Vudayagiri, Bo Vinther, Johannes Freitag, Peter L. Langen, and Thomas Blunier\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-237,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-237, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDuring the formation of ice from natural snowfall air is occluded in polar ice. The amount of air occluded (total air content) mainly reflects air pressure when the air is occluded and is therefore a proxy for elevation. However, there are several complications, such as melt, changes in firn structure and air pressure variability. We measured total air content in the RECAP ice core on the Renland Icecap in East Greenland. The core covers the period back to 121 thousand years before present.\n\nState-dependent impact of major volcanic eruptions observed in ice-core records of the last glacial period\n\nJohannes Lohmann, Jiamei Lin, Bo M. Vinther, Sune O. Rasmussen, and Anders Svensson\n\nClim. Past, 20, 313–333, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-313-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-313-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the first attempt to constrain the climatic impact of volcanic eruptions with return periods of hundreds of years by the oxygen isotope records of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores covering the last glacial period. A clear multi-annual volcanic cooling signal is seen, but its absolute magnitude is subject to the unknown glacial sensitivity of the proxy. Different proxy signals after eruptions during cooler versus warmer glacial stages may reflect a state-dependent climate response.\n\nEffective diffusivity of sulfuric acid in Antarctic ice cores\n\nTyler J. Fudge, Raphael Sauvage, Linh Vu, Benjamin H. Hills, Mirko Severi, and Edwin D. Waddington\n\nClim. Past, 20, 297–312, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-297-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-297-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use the oldest Antarctic ice core to estimate the rate of diffusion of sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is a marker of past volcanic activity and is critical in developing ice core timescales. The rate of diffusion is uncertain and is important to know, both for selecting future ice core locations and interpreting ice core records. We find the effective diffusivity of sulfate is 10 times smaller than previously estimated, indicating that the sulfuric acid signals will persist for longer.\n\nAccumulation rates over the past 260Â years archived in Elbrus ice core, Caucasus\n\nVladimir Mikhalenko, Stanislav Kutuzov, Pavel Toropov, Michel Legrand, Sergey Sokratov, Gleb Chernyakov, Ivan Lavrentiev, Susanne Preunkert, Anna Kozachek, Mstislav Vorobiev, Aleksandra Khairedinova, and Vladimir Lipenkov\n\nClim. Past, 20, 237–255, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-237-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-237-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we present a reconstruction of snow accumulation for both summer and winter over the past 260 years using ice-core records obtained from Mt. Elbrus in the Caucasus region. The accumulation record represents the historical precipitation patterns in a vast region encompassing the northern Caucasus, Black Sea, and southeastern Europe. Our findings show that the North Atlantic plays a crucial role in determining precipitation levels in this region.\n\nLaser Ablation – ICP-MS measurements for high resolution chemical ice core analyses with a first application to an ice core from Skytrain Ice Rise (Antarctica)\n\nHelene Hoffmann, Jason Day, Rachael Rhodes, Mackenzie Grieman, Jack Humby, Isobel Rowell, Christoph Nehrbass-Ahles, Robert Mulvaney, Sally Gibson, and Eric Wolff\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3071,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3071, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce cores are archives of past atmospheric conditions. In deep, old ice the layers containing this information get thinned to the millimetre scale or below. We installed a setup for high resolution (80 μm) chemical impurity measurements in ice cores using the laser ablation technique at the University of Cambridge. In a first application to Skytrain Ice Core from Antarctica we discuss the potential to detect fine layered structures in ice from Skytrain Ice Core up to an age of ~ 126 000 years.\n\nSouthern Hemisphere atmospheric history of carbon monoxide over the late Holocene reconstructed from multiple Antarctic ice archives\n\nXavier FaÃ¯n, David M.

Antarctica [CO] remained stable (–835 to 1500 CE), decreased during the Little Ice Age, and peaked around 1985 CE. Such evolution reflects stable biomass burning CO emissions before industrialization, followed by growth from CO anthropogenic sources, which decline after 1985 due to improved combustion.\n\nThe Antarctic Ice Core ChronologyÂ 2023 (AICC2023) chronological framework and associated timescale for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) DomeÂ C ice core\n\nMarie Bouchet, AmaÃ«lle Landais, Antoine Grisart, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, FrÃ©dÃ©ric PriÃ©, Roxanne Jacob, Elise FourrÃ©, Emilie Capron, Dominique Raynaud, Vladimir Ya Lipenkov, Marie-France Loutre, Thomas Extier, Anders Svensson, Etienne Legrain, Patricia Martinerie, Markus Leuenberger, Wei Jiang, Florian Ritterbusch, Zheng-Tian Lu, and Guo-Min Yang\n\nClim.

Precise ice core timescales are key to studying the mechanisms linking changes in the Earth’s orbit to the diverse climatic responses (temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations). To construct the chronology, new measurements from the oldest continuous ice core as well as glaciological modeling estimates were combined in a statistical model.\n\nFirn Seismic Anisotropy in the North East Greenland Ice Stream from Ambient Noise Surface Waves\n\nEmma Pearce, Dimitri Zigone, Coen Hofstede, Andreas Fichtner, Joachim Rimpot, Sune Olander Rasmussen, Johannes Freitag, and Olaf Eisen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2192,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2192, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur seismic study near EastGRIP camp in Greenland reveals varying firn properties by direction, crucial for studying ice stream stability, structure, surface mass balance and past climate conditions. We used dispersion curve analysis of Love and Rayleigh waves to show firn is non-uniform along and across flow of an ice stream due to wind patterns, seasonal variability and the proximity to the edge of the ice stream. This approach better informs firn structure advancing ice stream understanding.\n\nRevision of an open-split-based dual-inlet system for elemental and isotope ratio mass spectrometers with a focus on clumped-isotope measurements\n\nStephan RÃ¤ss, Peter Nyfeler, Paul Wheeler, Will Price, and Markus Christian Leuenberger\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 4489–4505, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4489-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4489-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to technological advances clumped-isotope studies have gained importance in recent years. Typically, these studies are performed with high-resolution isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IRMSs) along with a changeover-valve-based dual-inlet system (DIS). We are taking a different approach, namely performing clumped-isotope measurements with a compact low-resolution IRMS with an open-split-based DIS. Currently, we are working with pure-oxygen gas for which we are providing a proof of concept.\n\nMapping age and basal conditions of ice in the Dome Fuji region, Antarctica, by combining radar internal layer stratigraphy and flow modeling\n\nZhuo Wang, Ailsa Chung, Daniel Steinhage, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Johannes Freitag, and Olaf Eisen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4297–4314, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4297-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4297-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combine radar-based observed internal layer stratigraphy of the ice sheet with a 1-D ice flow model in the Dome Fuji region. This results in maps of age and age density of the basal ice, the basal thermal conditions, and reconstructed accumulation rates. Based on modeled age we then identify four potential candidates for ice which is potentially 1.5 Myr old. Our map of basal thermal conditions indicates that melting prevails over the presence of stagnant ice in the study area.\n\nCombining traditional and novel techniques to increase our understanding of the lock-in depth of atmospheric gases in polar ice cores - results from the EastGRIP region\n\nJulien Westhoff, Johannes Freitag, AnaÃ¯s Orsi, Patricia Martinerie, Ilka Weikusat, Michael Dyonisius, Xavier FaÃ¯n, Kevin Fourteau, and Thomas Blunier\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1904,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1904, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the EastGRIP area, Greenland, in detail with traditional and novel techniques. Due to the compaction of the ice, at a certain depth, atmospheric gases can no longer exchange and the atmosphere is trapped in air bubbles in the ice. We find this depth by pumping air from a borehole, modeling, and using a new technique based on the optical appearance of the ice. Our results suggest that the close-off depth lies around 58–61 m depth, and more precisely at 58.3 m depth.\n\nMulti-proxy speleothem-based reconstruction of mid-MISÂ 3 climate in South Africa\n\nJenny Maccali, Anna Nele Meckler, Stein-Erik Lauritzen, Torill Brekken, Helen Aase Rokkan, Alvaro Fernandez, Yves KrÃ¼ger, Jane Adigun, StÃ©phane Affolter, and Markus Leuenberger\n\nClim.

Here we present a short but high-resolution record of past changes in the hydroclimate and temperature on the southern coast of South Africa based on the study of a speleothem collected from Bloukrantz Cave. Overall, the paleoclimate indicators suggest stable temperature from 48.3 to 45.2 ka, whereas precipitation was variable, with marked short drier episodes.\n\nStagnant ice and age modelling in the Dome C region, Antarctica\n\nAilsa Chung, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Daniel Steinhage, Robert Mulvaney, Carlos MartÃ­n, Marie G.

Our results show that at the current ice core drilling sites on Little Dome C, the maximum age of the ice is almost 1.5 Ma. We also highlight a new potential drill site called North Patch with ice up to 2 Ma. Finally, we explore the nature of a stagnant ice layer at the base of the ice sheet which has been independently observed and modelled but is not well understood.\n\nAn age scale for new climate records from Sherman Island, West Antarctica\n\nIsobel Rowell, Carlos Martin, Robert Mulvaney, Helena Pryer, Dieter Tetzner, Emily Doyle, Hara Madhav Talasila, Jilu Li, and Eric Wolff\n\nClim. Past, 19, 1699–1714, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1699-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1699-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present an age scale for a new type of ice core from a vulnerable region in West Antarctic, which is lacking in longer-term (greater than a few centuries) ice core records. The Sherman Island core extends to greater than 1 kyr. We provide modelling evidence for the potential of a 10 kyr long core. We show that this new type of ice core can be robustly dated and that climate records from this core will be a significant addition to existing regional climate records.\n\nRegional variations in mineralogy of dust in ice cores obtained from northeastern and northwestern Greenland over the past 100 years\n\nNaoko Nagatsuka, Kumiko Goto-Azuma, Koji Fujita, Yuki Komuro, Motohiro Hirabayashi, Jun Ogata, Kaori Fukuda, Yoshimi Ogawa-Tsukagawa, Kyotaro Kitamura, Ayaka Yonekura, Fumio Nakazawa, Yukihiko Onuma, Naoyuki Kurita, Sune Olander Rasmussen, Giulia Sinnl, Trevor James Popp, and Dorthe Dahl-Jensen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1666,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1666, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new high-temporal-resolution record of mineral composition in a northeastern Greenland ice-core (EGRIP) over the past 100 years. The ice core dust composition and its variation differed significantly from a northwestern Greenland ice core, which is likely due to differences in the geological sources of the dust. Our results suggest that the EGRIP ice core dust was constantly supplied from Northern Eurasia, North America, and Asia with minor contribution from Greenland coast.\n\nAntarctic Ice Sheet paleo-constraint database\n\nBenoit S.

The database is intended to improve our understanding of past Antarctic changes and for ice sheet model calibrations.\n\nIce-core data used for the construction of the Greenland Ice-Core Chronology 2005 and 2021 (GICC05 and GICC21)\n\nSune Olander Rasmussen, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, Hubertus Fischer, Katrin Fuhrer, Steffen Bo Hansen, Margareta Hansson, Christine S.

The data series presented here were used for annual-layer identification when constructing the timescales named the Greenland Ice-Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) and the revised version GICC21. Hopefully, these high-resolution data sets will be useful also for other purposes.\n\nIce core chemistry database: an Antarctic compilation of sodium and sulfate records spanning the past 2000 years\n\nElizabeth R.

Here we have compiled a database of sodium and sulfate records from 105 ice core sites in Antarctica. The records span all, or part, of the past 2000 years. The records will improve our understanding of how winds and sea ice have changed in the past and how they have influenced the climate of Antarctica over the past 2000 years.\n\nSynchronizing ice-core and U â Th timescales in the Last Glacial Maximum using Hulu Cave 14C and new 10Be measurements from Greenland and Antarctica\n\nGiulia Sinnl, Florian Adolphi, Marcus Christl, Kees C. Welten, Thomas Woodruff, Marc Caffee, Anders Svensson, Raimund Muscheler, and Sune Olander Rasmussen\n\nClim. Past, 19, 1153–1175, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1153-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1153-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe record of past climate is preserved by several archives from different regions, such as ice cores from Greenland or Antarctica or speleothems from caves such as the Hulu Cave in China. In this study, these archives are aligned by taking advantage of the globally synchronous production of cosmogenic radionuclides. This produces a new perspective on the global climate in the period between 20 000 and 25 000 years ago.\n\nIndicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update of large-scale indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence\n\nPiers M.

We build on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports that are authoritative but published infrequently to create a set of key global climate indicators that can be tracked through time. Our hope is that this becomes an important annual publication that policymakers, media, scientists and the public can refer to.\n\nMethane, ethane, and propane production in Greenland ice core samples and a first isotopic characterization of excess methane\n\nMichaela MÃ¼hl, Jochen Schmitt, Barbara Seth, James E. Lee, Jon S. Edwards, Edward J. Brook, Thomas Blunier, and Hubertus Fischer\n\nClim. Past, 19, 999–1025, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-999-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-999-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur ice core measurements show that methane, ethane, and propane concentrations are significantly elevated above their past atmospheric background for Greenland ice samples containing mineral dust. The underlying co-production process happens during the classical discrete wet extraction of air from the ice sample and affects previous reconstructions of the inter-polar difference of methane as well as methane stable isotope records derived from dust-rich Greenland ice.\n\nChemical and visual characterisation of EGRIP glacial ice and cloudy bands within\n\nNicolas Stoll, Julien Westhoff, Pascal Bohleber, Anders Svensson, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, Carlo Barbante, and Ilka Weikusat\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2021–2043, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2021-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2021-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nImpurities in polar ice play a role regarding its climate signal and internal deformation. We bridge different scales using different methods to investigate ice from the Last Glacial Period derived from the EGRIP ice core in Greenland. We characterise different types of cloudy bands, i.e. frequently occurring milky layers in the ice, and analyse their chemistry with Raman spectroscopy and 2D imaging. We derive new insights into impurity localisation and deposition conditions.\n\nThe ST22 chronology for the Skytrain Ice Rise ice core â PartÂ 2: An age model to the last interglacial and disturbed deep stratigraphy\n\nRobert Mulvaney, Eric W.

Various measurements in the ice and air phases are used to match the ice core to other Antarctic cores that have already been dated, and a new age scale is constructed. The 651 m ice core includes ice that is confidently dated to 117 000–126 000 years ago, in the last interglacial. Older ice is found deeper down, but there are flow disturbances in the deeper ice.\n\nSpatial and temporal variations in surface snow chemistry along a traverse from Dome C toward South Pole in the framework of East Antarctic International Ice Sheet Traverse (EAIIST) project\n\nSimone Ventisette, Samuele Baldini, Claudio Artoni, Silvia Becagli, Laura Caiazzo, Barbara Delmonte, Massimo Frezzotti, Raffaello Nardin, Joel Savarino, Mirko Severi, Andrea Spolaor, Barbara Stenni, and Rita Traversi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-393,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-393, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper reports the spatial variability of concentration and fluxes of chemical impurities in superficial snow over unexplored area of the East Antarctic ice sheet. Pinatubo and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic eruptions in non-sea salt sulfate and dust snow pits record were used to achieve the accumulation rates. Deposition (wet, dry and uptake from snow surface) and post deposition processes are constrained. These knowledges are fundamental in Antarctic ice cores stratigraphies interpretation.\n\nA 1.5-million-year record of orbital and millennial climate variability in the North Atlantic\n\nDavid A. Hodell, Simon J. Crowhurst, Lucas Lourens, Vasiliki Margari, John Nicolson, James E. Rolfe, Luke C. Skinner, Nicola C. Thomas, Polychronis C. Tzedakis, Maryline J. Mleneck-Vautravers, and Eric W.

Our record demonstrates that longer-term orbital changes in Earth's climate were persistently overprinted by abrupt millennial-to-centennial climate variability. The occurrence of abrupt climate change is modulated by the slower variations in Earth's orbit and climate background state.\n\nTemporal variations of surface mass balance over the last 5000Â years around Dome Fuji, Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica\n\nIkumi Oyabu, Kenji Kawamura, Shuji Fujita, Ryo Inoue, Hideaki Motoyama, Kotaro Fukui, Motohiro Hirabayashi, Yu Hoshina, Naoyuki Kurita, Fumio Nakazawa, Hiroshi Ohno, Konosuke Sugiura, Toshitaka Suzuki, Shun Tsutaki, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Masashi Niwano, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Fuyuki Saito, and Masakazu Yoshimori\n\nClim.

We found a long-term decreasing trend in the preindustrial period, which may be associated with secular surface cooling and sea ice expansion. Centennial-scale variations were also found, which may partly be related to combinations of volcanic, solar and greenhouse gas forcings. The most rapid and intense increases of accumulation rate occurred since 1850 CE.\n\nFrequency of large volcanic eruptions over the past 200 000Â years\n\nEric W. Wolff, Andrea Burke, Laura Crick, Emily A. Doyle, Helen M. Innes, Sue H. Mahony, James W. B. Rae, Mirko Severi, and R. Stephen J. Sparks\n\nClim. Past, 19, 23–33, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-23-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-23-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge volcanic eruptions leave an imprint of a spike of sulfate deposition that can be measured in ice cores. Here we use a method that logs the number and size of large eruptions recorded in an Antarctic core in a consistent way through the last 200 000 years. The rate of recorded eruptions is variable but shows no trends. In particular, there is no increase in recorded eruptions during deglaciation periods. This is consistent with most recorded eruptions being from lower latitudes.\n\nAnalysis of high gas concentration and flux measurements at Swiss Beromünster tall tower\n\nAndreas Plach, Rolf RÃ¼fenacht, Simone Kotthaus, and Markus Leuenberger\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-1019,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-1019, 2022\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGreenhouse gases emissions are contributing to global warming and it is essential to better understand where they originate from and how they are transported. In this study we analyze greenhouse gas observations at a Swiss tall tower where measurements are taken more than 200 m above ground and investigate their origin by looking at the condition of the atmosphere at the time of the observations. We find that most pollution at this site is caused from emissions transported from further away.\n\nA database of radiogenic SrâNd isotopes at the âthree polesâ\n\nZhiheng Du, Jiao Yang, Lei Wang, Ninglian Wang, Anders Svensson, Zhen Zhang, Xiangyu Ma, Yaping Liu, Shimeng Wang, Jianzhong Xu, and Cunde Xiao\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 5349–5365, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5349-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5349-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA dataset of the radiogenic strontium and neodymium isotopic compositions from the three poles (the third pole, the Arctic, and Antarctica) were integrated to obtain new findings. The dataset enables us to map the standardized locations in the three poles, while the use of sorting criteria related to the sample type permits us to trace the dust sources and sinks. The purpose of this dataset is to try to determine the variable transport pathways of dust at three poles.\n\nHigh-resolution inverse modelling of European CH4 emissions using the novel FLEXPART-COSMO TM5 4DVAR inverse modelling system\n\nPeter Bergamaschi, Arjo Segers, Dominik Brunner, Jean-Matthieu Haussaire, Stephan Henne, Michel Ramonet, Tim Arnold, Tobias Biermann, Huilin Chen, Sebastien Conil, Marc Delmotte, Grant Forster, Arnoud Frumau, Dagmar Kubistin, Xin Lan, Markus Leuenberger, Matthias Lindauer, Morgan Lopez, Giovanni Manca, Jennifer MÃ¼ller-Williams, Simon O'Doherty, Bert Scheeren, Martin Steinbacher, Pamela Trisolino, Gabriela VÃ­tkovÃ¡, and Camille Yver Kwok\n\nAtmos.

The new system combines a high spatial resolution of 7 km x 7 km with a variational data assimilation technique, which allows CH4 emissions to be optimized from individual model grid cells. The high resolution allows the observations to be better reproduced, while the derived emissions show overall good consistency with two existing models.\n\nSub-millennial climate variability from high-resolution water isotopes in the EPICA Dome C ice core\n\nAntoine Grisart, Mathieu Casado, Vasileios Gkinis, Bo Vinther, Philippe Naveau, Mathieu Vrac, Thomas Laepple, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Minster, Frederic PriÃ©, Barbara Stenni, Elise FourrÃ©, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Jean Jouzel, Martin Werner, Katy Pol, ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, Maria Hoerhold, Trevor Popp, and Amaelle Landais\n\nClim.

Using this new combined water isotopes (δ18O and δD) dataset, we study the variability and possible influence of diffusion at the multi-decadal to multi-centennial scale. We observe a stronger variability at the onset of the interglacial interval corresponding to a warm period.\n\nCanadian forest fires, Icelandic volcanoes and increased local dust observed in six shallow Greenland firn cores\n\nHelle Astrid KjÃ¦r, Patrick Zens, Samuel Black, Kasper Holst Lund, Anders Svensson, and Paul Vallelonga\n\nClim. Past, 18, 2211–2230, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2211-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2211-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSix shallow cores from northern Greenland spanning a distance of 426 km were retrieved during a traversal in 2015. We identify several recent acid horizons associated with Icelandic eruptions and eruptions in the Barents Sea region and obtain a robust forest fire proxy associated primarily with Canadian forest fires. We also observe an increase in the large dust particle fluxes that we attribute to an activation of Greenland local sources in recent years (1998–2015).\n\nIce core evidence for major volcanic eruptions at the onset of DansgaardâOeschger warming events\n\nJohannes Lohmann and Anders Svensson\n\nClim. Past, 18, 2021–2043, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2021-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2021-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMajor volcanic eruptions are known to cause considerable short-term impacts on the global climate. Their influence on long-term climate variability and regime shifts is less well-understood. Here we show that very large, bipolar eruptions occurred more frequently than expected by chance just before abrupt climate change events in the last glacial period (Dansgaard–Oeschger events). Thus, such large eruptions may in some cases act as short-term triggers for abrupt regime shifts of the climate.\n\nInsolation evolution and ice volume legacies determine interglacial and glacial intensity\n\nTakahito Mitsui, Polychronis C. Tzedakis, and Eric W. Wolff\n\nClim. Past, 18, 1983–1996, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-1983-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-1983-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide simple quantitative models for the interglacial and glacial intensities over the last 800 000 years. Our results suggest that the memory of previous climate states and the time course of the insolation in both hemispheres are crucial for understanding interglacial and glacial intensities. In our model, the shift in interglacial intensities at the Mid-Brunhes Event (~430 ka) is ultimately attributed to the amplitude modulation of obliquity.\n\nThe ST22 chronology for the Skytrain Ice Rise ice core â Part 1: A stratigraphic chronology of the last 2000 years\n\nHelene M.

Within this framework an ice core was recently drilled at Skytrain Ice Rise. In this study we present a stratigraphic chronology of that ice core based on absolute age markers and annual layer counting for the last 2000 years.\n\nPM10 variation, composition, and source analysis in Tuscany (Italy) following the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions\n\nFabio Giardi, Silvia Nava, Giulia Calzolai, Giulia Pazzi, Massimo Chiari, Andrea Faggi, Bianca Patrizia Andreini, Chiara Collaveri, Elena Franchi, Guido Nincheri, Alessandra Amore, Silvia Becagli, Mirko Severi, Rita Traversi, and Franco Lucarelli\n\nAtmos.

However, the drastic decrease in this source of particulate matter during the months of national lockdown did not lead to an equal decrease in the total particulate load. This is due to the inverse behavior shown by different sources, especially secondary sources.\n\nSecondary aerosol formation in marine Arctic environments: a model measurement comparison at Ny-Ã lesund\n\nCarlton Xavier, Metin Baykara, Robin Wollesen de Jonge, Barbara AltstÃ¤dter, Petri Clusius, Ville Vakkari, Roseline Thakur, Lisa Beck, Silvia Becagli, Mirko Severi, Rita Traversi, Radovan Krejci, Peter Tunved, Mauro Mazzola, Birgit Wehner, Mikko SipilÃ¤, Markku Kulmala, Michael Boy, and Pontus Roldin\n\nAtmos.

We run the 1D model ADCHEM along air mass trajectories arriving at Ny-Ã lesund in May 2018. The model finds that ion-mediated H2SO4–NH3 nucleation can explain the observed new particle formation at Ny-Ã lesund. The growth of particles is driven via H2SO4 condensation and formation of methane sulfonic acid in the aqueous phase.\n\nFactors controlling atmospheric DMS and its oxidation products (MSA and nssSO42â) in the aerosol at Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica\n\nSilvia Becagli, Elena Barbaro, Simone Bonamano, Laura Caiazzo, Alcide di Sarra, Matteo Feltracco, Paolo Grigioni, Jost Heintzenberg, Luigi Lazzara, Michel Legrand, Alice Madonia, Marco Marcelli, Chiara Melillo, Daniela Meloni, Caterina Nuccio, Giandomenico Pace, Ki-Tae Park, Suzanne Preunkert, Mirko Severi, Marco Vecchiato, Roberta Zangrando, and Rita Traversi\n\nAtmos.

Based on ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, we reconstruct its climate impact potential over the Holocene. By aligning records on a well-dated chronology from Antarctica, we resolve long-standing inconsistencies in the dating of past volcanic eruptions. We reconstruct 850 eruptions (which, in total, injected 7410 Tg of sulfur in the stratosphere) and estimate how they changed the opacity of the atmosphere, a prerequisite for climate model simulations.\n\nStratigraphic templates for ice core records of the past 1.5 Myr\n\nEric W.

Dating such cores will be challenging. One method is to match records from the new core against datasets from existing marine sediment cores. Here we explore the options for doing this and assess how well the ice and marine records match over the existing 800 000-year time period. We are able to recommend a strategy for using marine data to place an age scale on the new ice cores.\n\nA multi-ice-core, annual-layer-counted Greenland ice-core chronology for the last 3800Â years: GICC21\n\nGiulia Sinnl, Mai Winstrup, Tobias Erhardt, Eliza Cook, Camilla Marie Jensen, Anders Svensson, Bo MÃ¸llesÃ¸e Vinther, Raimund Muscheler, and Sune Olander Rasmussen\n\nClim.

Our record displays warm summer events, which can be used to enhance our understanding of the past climate. We compare our data to anomalies in tree ring width, which also represents summer temperatures, and find a good correlation. Furthermore, we investigate an outstandingly warm event in the year 986 AD or 991 AD, which has not been analyzed before.\n\nPolarimetric radar reveals the spatial distribution of ice fabric at domes and divides in East Antarctica\n\nM. Reza Ershadi, Reinhard Drews, Carlos MartÃ­n, Olaf Eisen, Catherine Ritz, Hugh Corr, Julia Christmann, Ole Zeising, Angelika Humbert, and Robert Mulvaney\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1719–1739, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1719-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1719-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRadio waves transmitted through ice split up and inform us about the ice sheet interior and orientation of single ice crystals. This can be used to infer how ice flows and improve projections on how it will evolve in the future. Here we used an inverse approach and developed a new algorithm to infer ice properties from observed radar data. We applied this technique to the radar data obtained at two EPICA drilling sites, where ice cores were used to validate our results.\n\nAerosol optical properties calculated from size distributions, filter samples and absorption photometer data at Dome C, Antarctica, and their relationships with seasonal cycles of sources\n\nAki Virkkula, Henrik Grythe, John Backman, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Maurizio Busetto, Christian Lanconelli, Angelo Lupi, Silvia Becagli, Rita Traversi, Mirko Severi, Vito Vitale, Patrick Sheridan, and Elisabeth Andrews\n\nAtmos.

The equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass concentrations were compared with eBC measured at three other Antarctic sites: the South Pole (SPO) and two coastal sites, Neumayer and Syowa. Transport analysis suggests that South American BC emissions are the largest contributor to eBC at Dome C.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere atmospheric history of carbon monoxide since preindustrial times reconstructed from multiple Greenland ice cores\n\nXavier FaÃ¯n, Rachael H.

In this study, we analyzed five ice cores from Greenland at high resolution for CO concentrations by coupling laser spectrometry with continuous melting. By combining these new datasets, we produced an upper-bound estimate of past atmospheric CO abundance since preindustrial times for the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, covering the period from 1700 to 1957 CE.\n\nMagnitude, frequency and climate forcing of global volcanism during the last glacial period as seen in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores (60â9 ka)\n\nJiamei Lin, Anders Svensson, Christine S.

A total of 25 volcanic eruptions are found to be larger than any eruption in the last 2500 years, and we identify more eruptions than obtained from geological evidence. Towards the end of the glacial period, there is a notable increase in volcanic activity observed for Greenland.\n\nPhotochemical method for removing methane interference for improved gas analysis\n\nMerve Polat, Jesper Baldtzer Liisberg, Morten KrogsbÃ¸ll, Thomas Blunier, and Matthew S.

Tech., 14, 8041–8067, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-8041-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-8041-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have designed a process for removing methane from a gas stream so that nitrous oxide can be measured without interference. These are both key long-lived greenhouse gases frequently studied in relation to ice cores, plants, water treatment and so on. However, many researchers are not aware of the problem of methane interference, and in addition there have not been good methods available for solving the problem. Here we present and evaluate such a method.\n\nA detailed radiostratigraphic data set for the central East Antarctic Plateau spanning from the Holocene to the mid-Pleistocene\n\nMarie G. P.

This data set uses radar surveys collected over the span of 10 years, starting with an airborne international collaboration in 2008 to explore the region, up to the detailed ground-based surveys in support of the European Beyond EPICA – Oldest Ice (BE-OI) project.\n\nNew insights into the ââ¼â74 ka Toba eruption from sulfur isotopes of polar ice cores\n\nLaura Crick, Andrea Burke, William Hutchison, Mika Kohno, Kathryn A.

We have measured the sulfur isotopic composition for 11 Toba eruption candidates in two Antarctic ice cores. Sulfur isotopes allow us to distinguish between large eruptions that have erupted material into the stratosphere and smaller ones that reach lower altitudes. Using this we have identified the events most likely to be Toba and place the eruption on the transition into a cold period in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nDating of the GV7 East Antarctic ice core by high-resolution chemical records and focus on the accumulation rate variability in the last millennium\n\nRaffaello Nardin, Mirko Severi, Alessandra Amore, Silvia Becagli, Francois Burgay, Laura Caiazzo, Virginia Ciardini, Giuliano Dreossi, Massimo Frezzotti, Sang-Bum Hong, Ishaq Khan, Bianca Maria Narcisi, Marco Proposito, Claudio Scarchilli, Enricomaria Selmo, Andrea Spolaor, Barbara Stenni, and Rita Traversi\n\nClim.

Based on chemical and isotopic records from the 197 m Antarctic GV7(B) ice core, accurate dating was achieved and showed that the archive spans roughly the last 830 years. The relatively high accumulation rate allowed us to use the non-sea-salt sulfate seasonal pattern to count annual layers. The accumulation rate reconstruction exhibited a slight increase since the 18th century.\n\nA portable lightweight in situ analysis (LISA) box for ice and snow analysis\n\nHelle Astrid KjÃ¦r, Lisa Lolk Hauge, Marius Simonsen, Zurine Yoldi, Iben Koldtoft, Maria HÃ¶rhold, Johannes Freitag, Sepp Kipfstuhl, Anders Svensson, and Paul Vallelonga\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3719–3730, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3719-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3719-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce core analyses are often done in home laboratories after costly transport of samples from the field. This limits the amount of sample that can be analysed. Here, we present the first truly field-portable continuous flow analysis (CFA) system for the analysis of impurities in snow, firn and ice cores while still in the field: the lightweight in situ analysis (LISA) box. LISA is demonstrated in Greenland to reconstruct accumulation, conductivity and peroxide in snow cores.\n\nUpstream flow effects revealed in the EastGRIP ice core using Monte Carlo inversion of a two-dimensional ice-flow model\n\nTamara Annina Gerber, Christine SchÃ¸tt Hvidberg, Sune Olander Rasmussen, Steven Franke, Giulia Sinnl, Aslak Grinsted, Daniela Jansen, and Dorthe Dahl-Jensen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3655–3679, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3655-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3655-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate the ice flow in the onset region of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to determine the source area and past accumulation rates of ice found in the EastGRIP ice core. This information is required to correct for bias in ice-core records introduced by the upstream flow effects. Our results reveal that the increasing accumulation rate with increasing upstream distance is predominantly responsible for the constant annual layer thicknesses observed in the upper 900 m of the ice core.\n\nStratospheric carbon isotope fractionation and tropospheric histories of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-113 isotopologues\n\nMax Thomas, Johannes C.

We improve understanding of CFC destruction by measuring the isotopic fingerprint of the carbon in the three most abundant CFCs. These are the first such measurements in the main region where CFCs are destroyed â the stratosphere. We reconstruct the atmospheric isotope histories of these CFCs back to the 1950s by measuring air extracted from deep snow and using a model. The model and the measurements are generally consistent.\n\nBrief communication: New radar constraints support presence of ice older than 1.5 Myr at Little Dome C\n\nDavid A.

These data allow us to identify 50 % older internal horizons than previously traced in the area. We fit a model to the ages of those horizons at BELDC to determine the age of deep ice there. We find that there is likely to be 1.5 Myr old ice ~265 m above the bed, with sufficient resolution to preserve desired climatic information.\n\nGreenland climate simulations show high Eemian surface melt which could explain reduced total air content in ice cores\n\nAndreas Plach, Bo M.

Our simulations show more extensive melt than today. This is important for the interpretation of ice cores which are used to reconstruct the evolution of the ice sheet and the climate.\n\nLarge-scale features of Last Interglacial climate: results from evaluating the lig127k simulations for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)âPaleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP4)\n\nBette L.

We present a multi-model ensemble of 17 climate models, most of which have also completed the CMIP6 DECK experiments and are thus important for assessing future projections. The lig127ksimulations show strong summer warming over the NH continents. More than half of the models simulate a retreat of the Arctic minimum summer ice edge similar to the average for 2000–2018.\n\nRecent North Greenland temperature warming and accumulation\n\nHelle Astrid KjÃ¦r, Patrick Zens, Ross Edwards, Martin Olesen, Ruth Mottram, Gabriel Lewis, Christian Terkelsen Holme, Samuel Black, Kasper Holst Lund, Mikkel Schmidt, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, Bo Vinther, Anders Svensson, Nanna Karlsson, Jason E.

We find the model underestimate precipitation especially in north-eastern part of the ice cap- an important finding if aiming to reconstruct surface mass balance. Temperatures at 10 meters depth at 6 sites in Greenland were also determined and show a significant warming since the 1990's of 0.9 to 2.5 °C.\n\nOn the Role of Volcanism in Dansgaard-Oeschger Cycles\n\nJohannes Lohmann and Anders Svensson\n\nClim.

Their influence on long-term climate variability and regime shifts is less well understood. Here we show that very large, bipolar eruptions occurred more frequently than expected by chance just before abrupt climate change events in the last glacial period (the Dansgaard-Oeschger events). Thus, such large eruptions may in some cases act as short-term triggers to abrupt regime shifts of the climate.\n\nA first chronology for the East Greenland Ice-core Project (EGRIP) over the Holocene and last glacial termination\n\nSeyedhamidreza Mojtabavi, Frank Wilhelms, Eliza Cook, Siwan M.

After field measurements and processing of the ice-core data, the GICC05 timescale is transferred from the NGRIP core to the EGRIP core by means of matching volcanic events and common patterns (381 match points) in the ECM and DEP records. The new timescale is named GICC05-EGRIP-1 and extends back to around 15 kyr b2k.\n\nCambial-age related correlations of stable isotopes and tree-ring widths in wood samples of tree-line conifers\n\nTito Arosio, Malin M.

In this work we applied a correlation analysis on different cambial age to verify if these changes were correlated with tree-ring width values. The results prove a significant correlation between tree-ring-width and both hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes before 100 year of cambial age, but not afterwards, in both species.\n\nMillennial-scale atmospheric CO2 variations during the Marine Isotope Stage 6 period (190â135 ka)\n\nJinhwa Shin, Christoph Nehrbass-Ahles, Roberto Grilli, Jai Chowdhry Beeman, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, GrÃ©gory Teste, Amaelle Landais, LoÃ¯c Schmidely, Lucas Silva, Jochen Schmitt, Bernhard Bereiter, Thomas F.

The amplitude of CO2 is highly determined by the Northern Hemisphere stadial duration. Carbon dioxide maxima show different lags with respect to the corresponding abrupt CH4 jumps, the latter reflecting rapid warming in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAlpine Holocene tree-ring dataset: age-related trends in the stable isotopes of cellulose show species-specific patterns\n\nTito Arosio, Malin M. Ziehmer, Kurt Nicolussi, Christian SchlÃ¼chter, and Markus Leuenberger\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 4871–4882, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4871-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4871-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStable isotopes in tree-ring cellulose are tools for climatic reconstructions, but interpretation is challenging due to nonclimate trends. We analyzed the tree-age trends in tree-ring isotopes of deciduous larch and evergreen cembran pine. Samples covering the whole Holocene were collected at the tree line in the Alps. For cambial ages over 100 years, we prove the absence of age trends in Î´D, Î´18O, and Î´13C for both species. For lower cambial ages, trends differ for each isotope and species.\n\nComparison of Holocene temperature reconstructions based on GISP2 multiple-gas-isotope measurements\n\nMichael DÃ¶ring and Markus Christian Leuenberger\n\nClim.

We describe the ice age-scale and gas age-scale of the ice core for 0–763 m (83 000 years BP). Old ice near the bottom of the core implies the ice dome existed throughout the last glacial period and that ice streaming was active in the region. Variations in methane, similar to those used as evidence of early human influence on climate, were observed prior to significant human populations.\n\nBipolar volcanic synchronization of abrupt climate change in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores during the last glacial period\n\nAnders Svensson, Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, JÃ¸rgen Peder Steffensen, Thomas Blunier, Sune O.

Thereby the exact timing of unexplained, abrupt climatic changes occurring during the last glacial period can be determined in a global context. The study thus provides a step towards a full understanding of elements of the climate system that may also play an important role in the future.\n\nCMIP6/PMIP4 simulations of the mid-Holocene and Last Interglacial using HadGEM3: comparison to the pre-industrial era, previous model versions and proxy data\n\nCharles J.

Past, 16, 503–522, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-503-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-503-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify how the greenhouse gas records of East Antarctic ice cores (which are the oldest ice cores) might differ from the actual atmosphere history. It is required to properly interpret ice core data. For this, we measured the methane of five new East Antarctic ice core sections using a high-resolution technique. We found that in these very old ice cores, one can retrieve concentration variations occurring in only a few centuries, allowing climatologists to study climate's fast dynamics.\n\nFirst direct observation of sea salt aerosol production from blowing snow above sea ice\n\nMarkus M. Frey, Sarah J. Norris, Ian M. Brooks, Philip S. Anderson, Kouichi Nishimura, Xin Yang, Anna E. Jones, Michelle G. Nerentorp Mastromonaco, David H. Jones, and Eric W. Wolff\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 2549–2578, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2549-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-2549-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA winter sea ice expedition to Antarctica provided the first direct observations of sea salt aerosol (SSA) production during snow storms above sea ice, thereby validating a model hypothesis to account for winter time SSA maxima in Antarctica not explained otherwise. Defining SSA sources is important given the critical roles that aerosol plays for climate, for air quality and as a potential ice core proxy for sea ice conditions in the past.\n\nTowards an understanding of surface effects: testing of various materials in a small volume measurement chamber and its relevance for atmospheric trace gas analysis\n\nEce Satar, Peter Nyfeler, CÃ©line Pascale, Bernhard Niederhauser, and Markus Leuenberger\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 119–130, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-119-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-119-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo ensure the best preparation and measurement conditions for trace gases, usage of coated materials is in demand in gas metrology and atmospheric measurement communities. In this article, the previously introduced aluminum measurement chamber is used to investigate materials such as glass, aluminum, copper, brass, steel and three different commercially available coatings. Our measurements focus on temperature and pressure dependencies for the species CO2, CO, CH4 and H2O using a CRDS analyzer.\n\nInvestigation of adsorption and desorption behavior of small-volume cylinders and its relevance for atmospheric trace gas analysis\n\nEce Satar, Peter Nyfeler, Bernhard Bereiter, CÃ©line Pascale, Bernhard Niederhauser, and Markus Leuenberger\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 101–117, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-101-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-101-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGood-quality measurements of atmospheric trace gases are only possible with regular calibrations and stable measurements from the standard cylinders. This study investigates instabilities due to surface effects on newly built aluminum and steel cylinders. We present measurements over a set of temperature and pressure ranges for the amount fractions of CO2, CO, CH4 and H2O using a commercial and a novel laser spectroscopic analyzer.\n\nHigh-precision atmospheric oxygen measurement comparisons between a newly built CRDS analyzer and existing measurement techniques\n\nTesfaye A. Berhanu, John Hoffnagle, Chris Rella, David Kimhak, Peter Nyfeler, and Markus Leuenberger\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 6803–6826, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6803-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6803-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurate measurement of variations in atmospheric O2 can provide useful information about atmospheric, biospheric, and oceanic processes, which is a challenge for existing measurement techniques. Here, we introduce a newly built high-precision, stable CRDS analyzer (Picarro G2207) that can measure O2 mixing ratios with a short-term precision of < 1 ppm and only requires calibration every 12 h. Measurements from tower and mountain sites are also presented.\n\nMulti-tracer study of gas trapping in an East Antarctic ice core\n\nKÃ©vin Fourteau, Patricia Martinerie, Xavier FaÃ¯n, Christoph F. Schaller, Rebecca J. Tuckwell, Henning LÃ¶we, Laurent Arnaud, Olivier Magand, Elizabeth R. Thomas, Johannes Freitag, Robert Mulvaney, Martin Schneebeli, and Vladimir Ya. Lipenkov\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 3383–3403, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3383-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3383-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding gas trapping in polar ice is essential to study the relationship between greenhouse gases and past climates. New data of bubble closure, used in a simple gas-trapping model, show inconsistency with the final air content in ice. This suggests gas trapping is not fully understood. We also use a combination of high-resolution measurements to investigate the effect of polar snow stratification on gas trapping and find that all strata have similar pores, but that some close in advance.\n\nComparison of Holocene temperature reconstructions based on GISP2 multiple-gas-isotope measurements\n\nMichael DÃ¶ring and Markus Christian Leuenberger\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2019-132,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2019-132, 2019\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse Holocen temperatures reconstructed from gas-stable-isotope species measured on ancient air extracted from a Greenland ice core. Also, we compare two state of the art firn-models which are needed for the inversion of the gas-isotope data to paleo-temperature and provide detailed uncertainty estimations for the reconstructed temperature estimates. Finally, we compare our reconstructed temperatures to two recent reconstructions based on the same gas-isotope data as used here.\n\nThe penultimate deglaciation: protocol for Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) phase 4 transient numerical simulations between 140 and 127 ka, version 1.0\n\nLaurie Menviel, Emilie Capron, Aline Govin, Andrea Dutton, Lev Tarasov, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Russell N.

This design includes time-varying changes in orbital forcing, greenhouse gas concentrations, continental ice sheets as well as freshwater input from the disintegration of continental ice sheets. Key paleo-records for model-data comparison are also included.\n\nSea salt aerosol production via sublimating wind-blown saline snow particles over sea ice: parameterizations and relevant microphysical mechanisms\n\nXin Yang, Markus M. Frey, Rachael H. Rhodes, Sarah J. Norris, Ian M. Brooks, Philip S. Anderson, Kouichi Nishimura, Anna E. Jones, and Eric W. Wolff\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 8407–8424, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-8407-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-8407-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis is a comprehensive model–data comparison aiming to evaluate the proposed mechanism of sea salt aerosol (SSA) production from blowing snow on sea ice. Some key parameters such as snow salinity and blowing-snow size distribution were constrained by data collected in the Weddell Sea. The good agreement between modelled SSA and the cruise data strongly indicates that sea ice surface is a large SSA source in polar regions, a process which has not been considered in current climate models.\n\nA rapidly converging initialisation method to simulate the present-day Greenland ice sheet using the GRISLI ice sheet model (version 1.3)\n\nSÃ©bastien Le clec'h, AurÃ©lien Quiquet, Sylvie Charbit, Christophe Dumas, Masa Kageyama, and Catherine Ritz\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 2481–2499, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2481-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2481-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo provide reliable projections of the ice-sheet contribution to future sea-level rise, ice sheet models must be able to simulate the observed ice sheet present-day state. Using a low computational iterative minimisation procedure, based on the adjustment of the basal drag coefficient, we rapidly minimise the errors between the simulated and the observed Greenland ice thickness and ice velocity, and we succeed in stabilising the simulated Greenland ice sheet state under present-day conditions.\n\nAntarctic temperature and CO2: near-synchrony yet variable phasing during the last deglaciation\n\nJai Chowdhry Beeman, LÃ©a Gest, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Parrenin, Dominique Raynaud, Tyler J. Fudge, Christo Buizert, and Edward J. Brook\n\nClim. Past, 15, 913–926, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-913-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-913-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric CO2 was likely an important amplifier of global-scale orbitally-driven warming during the last deglaciation. However, the mechanisms responsible for the rise in CO2, and the coherent rise in Antarctic isotopic temperature records, are under debate. Using a stochastic method, we detect variable lags between coherent changes in Antarctic temperature and CO2. This implies that the climate mechanisms linking the two records changed or experienced modulations during the deglaciation.\n\nDecadal-scale progression of the onset of DansgaardâOeschger warming events\n\nTobias Erhardt, Emilie Capron, Sune Olander Rasmussen, Simon SchÃ¼pbach, Matthias Bigler, Florian Adolphi, and Hubertus Fischer\n\nClim. Past, 15, 811–825, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-811-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-811-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe cause of the rapid warming events documented in proxy records across the Northern Hemisphere during the last glacial has been a long-standing puzzle in paleo-climate research. Here, we use high-resolution ice-core data from to cores in Greenland to investigate the progression during the onset of these events on multi-annual timescales to test their plausible triggers. We show that atmospheric circulation changes preceded the warming in Greenland and the collapse of the sea ice by a decade.\n\nChallenges associated with the climatic interpretation of water stable isotope records from a highly resolved firn core from AdÃ©lie Land, coastal Antarctica\n\nSentia Goursaud, ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, Vincent Favier, Suzanne Preunkert, Michel Legrand, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Minster, and Martin Werner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1297–1324, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1297-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1297-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report new water stable isotope records from the first highly resolved firn core drilled in AdÃ©lie Land and covering 1998–2014. Using an updated database, we show that mean values are in line with the range of coastal values. Statistical analyses show no relationship between our record and local surface air temperature. Atmospheric back trajectories and isotopic simulations suggest that water stable isotopes in AdÃ©lie provide a fingerprint of the variability of atmospheric dynamics.\n\nA 2700-year annual timescale and accumulation history for an ice core from Roosevelt Island, West Antarctica\n\nMai Winstrup, Paul Vallelonga, Helle A.

We observe a long-term slightly decreasing trend in accumulation during most of the period but a rapid decline since the mid-1960s. The latter is linked to a recent strengthening of the Amundsen Sea Low and the expansion of regional sea ice. The year 1965 CE may thus mark the onset of significant increases in sea-ice extent in the eastern Ross Sea.\n\nAssessing the robustness of Antarctic temperature reconstructions over the past 2Â millennia using pseudoproxy and data assimilation experiments\n\nFranÃ§ois Klein, N"
