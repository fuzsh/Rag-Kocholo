        "text": "Highest Rated: 85% You Cannot Kill David Arquette (2020)\n\nLowest Rated: 4% Zoom (2006)\n\nBirthday: Jun 15, 1964\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham, Alabama, USA\n\nA former model whose cover-worthy appearance belied her knack for comedy, actress Courteney Cox was among the most popular performers on television throughout the 1990s and early millennium, thanks to her popular turn as Monica Gellar on \"Friends\" (NBC, 1994-2004). For millions of viewers, her performance as Gellar came to symbolize the over-achiever as she struggled to balance her career, love life and desire for a family with her host of obsessive-compulsive quirks, much to the delight of audiences. The success of \"Friends\" made Cox a household name, though she struggled to translate that fame into a film career; still, there were successes at the movies, including \"Scream\" (1996) and its sequels, as well as \"The Longest Yard\" (2005) and \"Bedtime Stories\" (2008). Television, however, remained her strongest palate, and she returned there on several occasions; most notably for the sexy drama \"Dirt\" (FX, 2007-08) and \"Cougar Town\" (ABC/TBS, 2009-2015), both of which she co-produced with her husband, actor David Arquette. Throughout her career shifts, she remained an enduring fan favorite, thanks to being immortalized on \"Friends,\" but also for her reputation as a performer who consistently sought new challenges rather than coasting on past glories.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n81% Scream 2 81% Scream 76% Scream VI 76% Scream 60% Scream 4\n\n47% Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\n\n41% Scream 3\n\n40% Shaking the Tree\n\nPhotos\n\nCourteney Cox Courteney Cox at arrivals for JUST BEFORE I GO Premiere, Arclight Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA April 20, 2015.
