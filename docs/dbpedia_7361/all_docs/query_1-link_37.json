        "text": "Courteney Cox shared photos on Saturday reflecting on the style evolution from her first formal outfit to her teenage daughter Coco's look at her first dance.\n\nThe \"Friends\" actress, 55, sported what appears to be a turtleneck and dress combination in the older photo, while her 15-year-old daughter wore a fitted red dress with a deep-V neckline for her first dance.\n\n\"Our first formals! I’m not saying times have changed but, someone is a little more 'formal' than someone else,\" Cox captioned her post.\n\n\"Obviously it was a little chillier in Alabama. #simplicitypatterns,\" she added.\n\nCoco is Cox's only daughter with ex-husband David Arquette, whom she divorced in 2013. She has been with her partner, musician Johnny McDaid, since 2013, and Arquette has been married to Christina McLarty since 2015.\n\nCox often shares photos of her daughter, expressing how grateful she is for their close bond.\n\nIn 2019 she shared a snap of Coco wearing the same dress that she wore to a 1998 premiere in Hollywood, alongside a photo of herself from the premiere.\n\nIn the caption, she mused on the moment. \"I’m not one to hold onto things but this was a damn good purchase! 21 years later...\" she wrote.\n\nMany of Cox's followers were amazed at the \"twinning\" moment, 21 years later, and took to the comments section.\n\n\"Oh wow…\" Cox's former \"Friends\" costar and close friend Lisa Kudrow wrote.\n\n\"Incredible!\" actress Demi Moore added."
