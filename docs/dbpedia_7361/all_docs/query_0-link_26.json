In a conversation for CBS Sunday Morning, Cox reflected on 2024 marking 30 years since the Friends premiere, noting that for the 10 years she was on the NBC sitcom, her co-stars were her “family,” going through “everything” together. Cox then reflected on Perry and talked about their close bond. She added that she has retained a connection with her co-star’s spirit."
