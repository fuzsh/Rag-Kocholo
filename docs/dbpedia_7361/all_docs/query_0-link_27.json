        "text": "\"It's the humidity!\" Cox mouthed to a voiceover of her 'Friends' character\n\nCourteney Cox is channeling her Friends character to poke fun at how Miami humidity has impacted her hair.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 22, Cox, who played Monica Geller on the long-running sitcom, shared a fun Instagram clip during her trip.\n\nIt begins with her indoors, with her hair tamed and sleek. She says, \"I love Miami!\" as she opens the door and steps onto a patio.\n\nAs soon as she reaches the outdoors, her hair transforms into voluminous curls.\n\nCox, 59, explains the change by mouthing a voiceover featuring one of Monica's most famous lines: \"It's the humidity!\"\n\nRelated: Matt Dillon, 60, Embraces Gray Hair at Cannes Film Festival — See His Silver Fox Moment\n\nMonica originally proclaimed the phrase during a season 9 episode of Friends called \"The One in Barbados Part 1,\" when the group heads to the Caribbean for vacation. Monica's hair gets bigger and bigger throughout the episode, due to the humidity, and her friends don't hesitate to make fun of it. At one point, Monica gets fed up and yells, \"It's the humidity!\"\n\nIn the comment section of Cox's post, faithful Friends fans referenced some of the jokes Monica's friends made about her hair in the episode.\n\nOne wrote, “that’s not true. I came with monica, i’m leaving with weird al.”\n\nAnother added, \"ARE YOU LEAVING THE SUPREMES?\"\n\nRelated: Khloé Kardashian Shows Off New 'Strawberry Red' Hair: ‘Strawberry Shortcake Vibes’\n\nCox hasn't shied away from making fun of her previous characters' hairstyles.\n\nIn January, she posted an Instagram video reacting to some of the most memorable looks she's rocked over the years. In the clip, someone approaches her wearing a grey sweatshirt with a photo of her Scream 3 character Gale Weathers sporting baby bangs.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"What is that? Don't wear that sweatshirt,\" she says. \"The bangs? Come on. That's ridiculous. It's embarrassing.\"\n\nShe then heads inside where a construction crew is working, and asks if they're \"almost done.\" The workers turn around, revealing that each of them is wearing a sweatshirt with a photo of Cox's characters' unforgettable hairdos, including Monica's famous humidity hair.\n\nShe quickly closes the tarp before she walks away as eerie music is heard playing over the video.\n\nFriends aired across 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004. Cox starred alongside Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
