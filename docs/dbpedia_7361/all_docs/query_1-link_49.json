        "text": "Four decades later, Courteney Cox‘s fire is still burning. The Friends star hopped onto the viral “asking my mom how she danced in the ’80s” TikTok trend on Sunday (June 9) when she posted a video featuring her Reagan-era moves by throwing back to the moment that started it all for her.\n\nWhile most of the moms who’ve responded have danced to British synth pop trio Bronski Beats’ “Smalltown Boy,” Cox’s video opened with her doing a classic 1980s arm shimmy before she appeared to have a change of heart. Cue the saxophones and a wardrobe switch, as Cox ditched her sweatshirt, unzipping it to uncover a Bruce Springsteen Born in the U.S.A. t-shirt while she busted into the dance that helped make her a star.\n\nThe video then pivoted back to 1984, when Cox got her first big break when she was pulled from the audience onto stage with The Boss for a dancing cameo in his “Dancing in the Dark” video. The video directed by famed auteur Brian De Palma was shot during a pair of Springsteen shows in St. Paul, Minn. and the rocker pulled the then 20-year-old Cox from the audience to dance with him onstage, not knowing that she was an actress who was chosen during a casting call in New York.\n\nSpringsteen and the E Street Band are in the midst of their 2024 European tour, with the band gearing up to play three shows at the Civitas Metropolitano in Madrid, Spain on June 12, 14 and 17.\n\nWatch Cox’s video below."
