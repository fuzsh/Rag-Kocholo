        "text": "Courteney Cox may be answering the Scream call one again, with sources saying the actor is in talks for the upcoming Scream VII.\n\nCox originated the role of reporter Gale Weathers in 1996’s Scream, and has appeared in its five sequels. The return of Cox adds another jolt to the project, which has been revamped following the departure of star Jenna Ortega, the firing of actor Melissa Barrera and the exit of director Christopher Landon last year. Spyglass has assembled a new iteration of the film, with Scream franchise creator Kevin Williamson stepping into the director’s chair and original star Neve Campbell agreeing to return after sitting out the previous installment over a salary dispute.\n\nScream launched in 1996 with the late Wes Craven going on to direct three sequels known for skewering horror genre tropes. In 2022, the fifth film reinvented the franchise under the direction of directing team Radio Silence, with Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette returning alongside a crew of new actors. They followed it up with Scream VI, which in 2023 became the franchise’s top grossing movie.\n\nCox, who became a top star in the 1990s as among the cast of NBC’s Friends, is repped by WME, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and Gersh.\n\nVariety first reported the news."
