        "text": "“Coco is so smart, so cool, and so creative,” actor and home scent brand founder Courteney Cox tells me over Zoom of her 20-year-old daughter, Coco Arquette. Ever since she launched Homecourt in 2022, Cox has been dreaming up a scent inspired by her daughter. “Not just because she's my daughter, but also because she's such a special person.” Today, the collection is officially here. “I'm blushing,” Arquette says of this tribute, named Cocomoi. “My mom is my rock, my best friend.”\n\nIt's not just a weaving of marketing magic to say that Arquette's Cocomoi is the daughter scent of Cox's namesake juice with the brand, Cece. Much like the mother-daughter duo, the two blends have notes in common: sweet cardamom, cedarwood, and vetivier. “I wanted it to be familial,” Cox shares. “We are similar human beings,\" Arquette says of her relationship with her mother. “We're both sensitive and emotional, but also really spunky.”\n\nOn top of the mother-daughter earthy notes, Cocomoi also has tropical coconut water and black pepper to make it unique. The scent is green in a youthful way, it's tropical in a sexy beach vacation way. The 5-piece collection starts with a candle in the brand's iconic minimalist ceramic vessel candle. This is also Homecourt's first full-fledged body collection, with other beachy products including perfume oil, body mist, body butter, and body wash. “I love being the Homecourt heiress,” Arquette jokes during our time together. “My apartment always smells incredible.”"
