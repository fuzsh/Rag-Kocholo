        "text": "Courteney Cox honored her late Friends co-star Matthew Perry by revisiting the moment that started their on-screen romance.\n\nThe actress took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a video of the scene in which their two characters — Cox’s Monica Geller and Perry’s Chandler Bing — sleep together for the first time in London, just before Monica’s brother Ross’ (David Schwimmer) wedding day — well, almost wedding day — per Variety.\n\n“I am so grateful for every moment I had with you Matty and I miss you every day,” Cox wrote. “When you work with someone as closely as I did with Matthew, there are thousands of moments I wish I could share. For now here’s one of my favorites.”\n\nThe reel includes “what aired” (the fully cut and edited scene), as well as “what happened,” in which viewers can hear the roaring cheers of the live studio audience.\n\nCox’s caption continued, “To give a little backstory, Chandler and Monica were supposed to have a one night fling in London. But because of the audience’s reaction, it became the beginning of their love story.”\n\nShe noted how “in this scene, before [they] started rolling, he whispered a funny line for [her] to say.” In the video, viewers hear Cox say, “Ok, your turn,” as the two pretended to go back under the covers and continue hooking up.\n\n“He told me to say it!” she exclaimed in the video. “He did!”\n\nCox concluded her post, “He often did things like that . He was funny and he was kind 🤍🕊️.”\n\nChandler and Monica’s romance became a staple of the show, so much so that Perry stopped the sitcom’s writers from going forward with a storyline in which his character would cheat on Monica. Lisa Cash, an actress who guest-starred on the show’s Season 5 episode entitled “The One in Vegas: Part 1,” revealed to TMZ that the writers originally intended for Chandler to cheat on Monica with her character.\n\n“The day before we were shooting in front of a live audience, I was told that [he] went to the writers and said the audience will never forgive him for cheating on Monica,” she shared. “Which, he was probably right. That would’ve changed possibly the course of the show and of his character.”\n\nFellow Friends cast member Matt LeBlanc also shared a heartfelt tribute in honor of Perry on Tuesday, where he wrote that “the times [they] had together are honestly among the favorite times of [his] life.”\n\nPerry’s five Friends also co-stars released a joint statement to People , expressing that they “are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew.”\n\n“We were more than just cast mates,” they wrote. “We are a family.”\n\nThey continued, “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss. In time we will say more, as and when we are able. For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”"
