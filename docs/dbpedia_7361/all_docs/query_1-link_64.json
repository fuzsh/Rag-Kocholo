        "text": "Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox have been BFFs ever since they first stepped onto the Friends set in 1994. That 30-year friendship means they have weathered plenty of ups and downs together in their lives with romances, marriages, and divorces. However, there might be one issue the dynamic duo doesn’t agree on, and it could be a sticking point in their bestie status.\n\nCox, who has been dating Snow Patrol singer Johnny McDaid on and off for over a decade, still isn’t living in the same country as her boyfriend — and Aniston is reportedly taking issue with that, according to OK! magazine. “Jennifer has always been wary of Johnny,” their source claimed. “She finds it really odd that Johnny won’t move to L.A. full-time to live with Courteney and insists on living in London.” Aniston apparently believes that “the whole long-distance thing after all these years is such a red flag.”\n\nThe possible friction in Aniston and Cox’s relationship over McDaid surfaced just weeks after the 59-year-old Cougar Town actress revealed that the musician had ended their engagement in therapy in 2015. It happened “within the first minute” of their session and she was blindsided by his revelation. “And I was like ‘What?’ And we were engaged. And I was so shocked, I was in so much pain, I also don’t like surprises,” Cox told Minnie Driver on her Minnie Questions podcast. “And he’s an incredible human being, so he wasn’t trying to surprise. He was in that much pain in the relationship.”\n\nCox took a moment to work on herself to “reclaim my voice, boundaries, what were my motives in life.” She doesn’t hold a grudge either because “I’m thankful that Johnny was so bold and brave because it was life-changing for me, and I’m sure for him.” The couple did not get engaged again but have kept their boyfriend-girlfriend status after their reconciliation. However, that may be another reason Aniston keeps a side-eye on McDaid — she saw how much pain Cox was in after their first split.\n\n“She’s always polite to him, but she thinks he ought to be thanking his lucky stars to have landed Courteney,” the insider added to OK! Let’s hope McDaid is treating Cox like the queen that she is because we are all now on boyfriend watch."
