        "text": "Courteney Cox just shared how she channels her inner Monica Geller to this day.\n\nIn an Instagram video, she shared snippets of her ultra-organized kitchen.\n\nFriends fans loved the connection, and jumped in by sharing their own Monica-isms.\n\nRachel Green may have believed she was Monica Geller‚Äôs best friend, but the truth is, no one stood between the New York City chef and her label maker. The beloved Friends star played by Courteney Cox was an organizing fiend‚Äîwhether she was categorizing family photos (‚ÄúWe got holidays, birthdays, candids!‚Äù), separating her ‚Äúeveryday use‚Äù towels from the ‚Äúfancy‚Äù ones, or numbering her coffee mugs, she couldn‚Äôt get enough. And as it turns out, Cox can‚Äôt either‚Äîshe showed off her house‚Äôs most Monica-esque arrangements in a recent Instagram.\n\n‚ÄúTell me you‚Äôre a Monica without telling me you‚Äôre a Monica,‚Äù she said to the camera, referencing an ongoing viral TikTok trend. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go first.‚Äù\n\nThe actress, 56, proceeded to reveal a sparkling organized silverware drawer, a cabinet of uniform, labeled spices, and a pantry full of dry goods decanted in jars and organized by function. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she nodded, confirming her hyper-attention to detail.\n\nFor Friends fans, any new show-related content is good content‚Äîso naturally, they absolutely loved the video. In less than 24 hours, it got over a million likes.\n\n‚ÄúShe was born for that role,‚Äù one person commented. ‚ÄúI had an orgasm when that drawer opened ü§§,‚Äù Modern Family star Sarah Hyland wrote. A few others chimed in with some relevant Monica quotes like, ‚ÄúNow I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, If I‚Äôm harsh with you, it‚Äôs only because you‚Äôre doing it wrong.‚Äù\n\nAfter seeing the arranged-to-perfection kitchen, plenty of people jumped on the trend to reveal their own Monica-isms, including the very popular Clea Shearer of The Home Edit, an organization company that has transformed spaces for all kinds of celebrities including Reese Witherspoon, Retta, and Khlo√© Kardashian.\n\n‚ÄúMonica Geller forever. Am I doing it right @courteneycoxofficial?‚Äù Shearer captioned her video. She went on to display the rainbow-esque color-coordinated nooks and crannies of her own house, including a skincare cabinet, a drawer of teas and supplements, and her pantry.\n\nNow, the one thing Instagram is dying to know is‚Äîwhere are the secret junk closets? If Monica had one, they must, too."
