        "text": "Whoever thought that we'd one day see a Friends x Snow Patrol crossover, but that's exactly what we have, in Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid's relationship. Friends alumni Courteney and Snow Patrol guitarist Johnny have been together for a solid seven years, since her divorce from ex-husband David Arquette. The couple have lived separately and also quietly got engaged and then happily un-engaged throughout that time. They're basically a great example of how relationships don't have to stick to a certain format. So the crossover isn't a Snow Patrol cover of 'Smelly Cat', but maybe it's better?\n\nHere's a definitive timeline of Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid's relationship, with the most recent update first.\n\nJuly 2021: We're all just a slightly obsessed with Courteney and Johnny, and who can blame us? Every time we get a little insight into their relationship on social media they're doing something cooler and even more adorable than the last time and we fall just a little bit more in love with their relationship. Well, get ready to fall head over heels...\n\nTo celebrate Johnny's birthday Courteney shared a post on Instagram, showing the pair side by side in none other than Monica's apartment. She captioned the cute post, \"Happy Birthday to my best friend and love. He's the kindest, most patient, best listener, curious, caring, not to mention talented and gorgeous partner. I love you jmd. x.\"\n\nOf course, fans were absolutely loving this colliding of worlds, while others just cracked jokes like, \"Chandler has changed a bit🤔.\"\n\nAnd here's the rest of Courteney and Johnny's relationship timeline...\n\nSeptember 2013: Courteney and Johnny have their first date, after reportedly being introduced by Ed Sheeran - our very own celebrity cupid.\n\nJanuary 2014: After several months of dating, Courteney and Johnny make things official in January 2014. They appear at a number of events throughout that year, looking very adorable together.\n\nCourteney and Johnny in November 2014\n\nApril 2014: Courteney makes her directorial debut with Just Before I Go, starring Sean William Scott, and Johnny works on three songs for the film's soundtrack.\n\nJune 2014: Johnny and Courteney get engaged and announce the news on Twitter. Along with a picture of the two of them Courteney tweets, \"I'm engaged to him!\".\n\nEd 'Cupid' Sheeran gets involved in the couple's news, since he was responsible for setting the pair up the previous year.\n\nNovember 2015: In shocking celebrity news Courteney and Johnny call off their engagement with reports suggesting the split was because they couldn't compromise on where to live. According to sources close to the pair McDaid was keen to move back to the UK while Courteney wanted to stay in Los Angeles.\n\nMarch 2016: The couple reunite in early 2016. They're the new and improved McCox; un-engaged and living on opposite sides of the Atlantic, with him staying put in the UK and her in LA. Not only do they set a really great example that a happy relationship comes in all different forms but they're cuter than ever.\n\nIn an appearance on The Ellen Show Courteney talks about their brief split and their relationship living so far apart, adding that the arrangement really works for them.\n\n\"He’s not my fiancé. We were engaged to be married, but now we’re just together,” she explained. “We broke off our engagement, and he moved to England, then we got back together, and it’s actually better than it was before.\"\n\n\"Everything’s better,\" she continued. “Not because he’s in London — although I think the distance after that breakup, we were apart for six months, that really showed us a lot. It’s just better.\"\n\n\"I mean, it’s expensive,\" Cox added. \"That’s an expensive relationship! We go back and forth a lot.\"\n\nJune 2017: They're a celebrity couple and they've been together for over three years so the baby rumours are long overdue. So it's no surprise when Courteney is asked in an interview about whether she and Johnny want to have children together.\n\nIn an interview with NewBeauty magazine she says, \"I would love to have a baby now. I mean, I could carry someone else's egg.\"\n\nCommenting on her age at the time, 53-year-old Cox said \"[I] may be one of the older people doing it, but I would love to, with Johnny that is. I know it's crazy, but I would.\"\n\nWhile Johnny doesn't have children, Courteney and her ex husband David Arquette share a daughter, 16-year-old Coco Arquette.\n\nMarch 2018: As they are bound to do, rumours of a re-engagement rumours start in early 2018, as several outlets report that the couple are set to marry again later that year. The rumour-mill goes absolutely wild and by June there's even a supposed date for the nuptials, with Jennifer Aniston as Maid of Honour and Ed Sheeran performing at the reception. As the year goes on it becomes increasingly clear that the rumours were just that.\n\nNovember 2018: After a marriage was rumoured to be taking place in June fans are flummoxed to see that 'McCox' are still not married. In an interview with The Belfast Telegraph McDaid speaks about the interest in the marriage story, saying, \"I think I've gotten married 15 times in the last year.\"\n\nTalking about the rumours McDaid said, \"I think people are curious. I'm often approached from a perspective of people thinking they know something when they don't.\n\n\"But often it's just funny. I think I've gotten married 15 times in the last year. There is a missing part of that equation, I'm on tour at the moment and Courteney is in LA.\n\n\"So it would be really difficult for me to get married unless I do it by proxy or over Skype or something.\" How very 2020 of you, Johnny.\n\n\"It is a bit bizarre but it comes with the territory,\" he added. \"I expect the curiosity but I also respect my relationship and my love.\n\n\"If you've ever been in love you know that love, it doesn't change when it is analysed or if it's public, it's still love, and it has what all relationships have - challenges and joys.\"\n\nFebruary 2019: Courteney wishes Johnny a happy Valentine's Day post with an adorable collage of pictures of the two of them.\n\nJune 2019: McCox are still going strong and enjoying their long distance relationship. This month Courteney left LA to spend some time with Johnny in Ireland.\n\nSeptember 2020: It's been seven years since their first date and Courteney posts an adorable video montage to Instagram to celebrate.\n\nShe captions the post, \"7 years ago today I had my first date with this incredible man... and my life was changed forever. I love you J ♥️ .\"\n\nOctober 2020: Courteney appeared on Foy Vance's podcast series where she revealed that she and Johnny McDaid haven't seen each other for over 200 days since the coronavirus crisis began in March of this year.\n\nAppearing on the podcast, Cox spoke about the difficulties the couple have had to handle as a result of the pandemic, explaining that since McDaid lives in the UK and she in the US the couple have been unable to spend time together in over six months.\n\n\"At first I was like, 'Wow what do I do with myself?' she told the podcast. \"I cook every day, I’ve learned to cook so much more, I’ve perfected it.\n\n\"Sundays are different,\" she continued. \"I miss a lot of it, although people are starting to go, 'OK, people have been quarantining, everyone's safe,' they like to come to the beach so I’m not that lonely.\n\n\"I have these two friends, they were gonna quarantine with me, which is great because if I can’t be with John, I don’t wanna be just by myself with Coco [Cox's 15-year-old daughter], I’m a little chicken,\" she said.\n\nDecember 2020: Courteney and Johnny have finally reunited after nine months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this month, the couple recorded a message for the Ráth Mór community thanking them for their hard work during a difficult period. It's unclear exactly when it was filmed, but it marks the first time the couple have appeared together on social media in over half a year."
