        "text": "Courteney Cox is detailing the moment fiancé Johnny McDaid once broke up with her mid-therapy session.\n\nDuring an appearance on the \"Minnie Questions\" podcast on Wednesday, Cox opened up about the \"really intense\" moment and explained why it strengthened their relationship in the end.\n\n\"We broke up in therapy. I didn’t know it was coming,\" said Cox, who first started dating the \"Snow Patrol\" singer in 2013 after being introduced by mutual friend, Ed Sheeran.\n\nCOURTENEY COX SAYS SHE HASN'T SEEN BOYFRIEND JOHNNY MCDAID IN PERSON IN 133 DAYS: ‘COVID SUCKS’\n\n\"We went to this therapist to talk about our boundaries [and] what we could and couldn’t accept about each other,\" the \"Friends\" alum added.\n\nBut, according to Cox, McDaid had other plans and broke off their engagement \"within the first minute\" of their session.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"I was like, ‘What?'\" she said. \"I was so shocked. I was in so much pain. I also don’t like surprises. And he's an incredible human being, so he wasn't trying to surprise. He was in that much pain in the relationship.\"\n\n\"There was that much that needed to be dealt with that he had to protect himself around his heart,\" she said. \"So as opposed to like going, ‘F--- him,’ getting in this mode of anger, I leaned in and I did the most work on myself by far.\"\n\nIn the end, that particular therapy session ended up being a positive turning point in the duo's relationship.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

They announced in 2019 that they'd ended their engagement, but were still in a relationship.\n\nLast year, the duo celebrated a big milestone: their 10-year anniversary.\n\nAPP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW POST\n\nCox paid tribute to the relationship with a heartfelt montage of various photos and videos of the two together."
