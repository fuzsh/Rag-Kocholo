        "text": "Courteney Cox made a hilarious recreation of her 1985 Tampax ad.\n\nCox, 57, wrote that the commercial “needed an update” to account for menopause.\n\nFans and followers loved the parody, and thanked the actress for getting real about aging.\n\nBefore Courteney Cox became Monica Geller, she was the first person to say “period” in a national commercial, thanks to her leg warmer-forward 1985 Tampax ad. Almost 40 years later, the Friends star decided it was time to give the commercial an age-appropriate update to account for menopause, and fans loved the hilarious recreation, to say the least.\n\nIn the Instagram clip, Cox wore an outfit almost identical to her ’80s gym attire pictured in the commercial—a purple leotard, tights, cropped tee, and leg warmers—and even used a similar locker room-esque bench as a prop. The only thing missing was a coiffed, hairspray-filled perm.\n\nThe original commercial began with the line: “Does your life change once a month because of your period?” And today’s Cox changed it to: “Did your life completely change because of menopause?” Continuing with the same cadence as the ad, she added: “Still getting hot flashes? Let me tell it to ya straight.”\n\nReplacing the line, “Tampax can change the way you feel about your period,” she quipped: “Menopause can change the way you feel about getting older,” adding with emphasis, “Menopause will eat you alive. It’s horrible. Nothing else can do that.”\n\nPerched on her bench in the same pose she delivered the lines four decades ago, she continued with her revamp in the perky tone of a spokesperson. “Plus, you get the added bonus of drier skin, and getting bald bald patches,” she said. “Now that’s something.”\n\nHer closing statement brought the moment full-circle. “Remember—there is nothing good about menopause,” she said. “It can actually change the way you feel about getting older.”\n\nIt’s pretty amazing that Cox was able to get through the spoof with a straight face. Because the timing and line delivery is comedic gold.\n\n“I didn’t think I could love you anymore... then you did this 😂😍,” one person commented. “Ok, you won the internet today Courteney,” another added. “I CAN’T! 😂😂😂 it’s the f-ing WORST & this is the f-ing BEST!!” someone else wrote.\n\nOthers thanked her for bringing the hushed struggles of menopause to light. “Thank you for this... so true and NO one speaks of it,” one person wrote. “This is so wonderfully honest,” another added.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the Scream star has gotten candid about aging. Earlier this year, she admitted to The Sunday Times that coming to grips with getting older was difficult at first, which is why she once tried to preserve her youth with facial fillers and other cosmetic procedures.\n\n“There was a time when you go, ‘Oh, I’m changing. I’m looking older.’ And I tried to chase that (youthfulness) for years,” she explained. “And I didn’t realize that … I’m actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now.”\n\nNow, she’s clearly embracing where she is in life, and making all of us laugh in the process."
