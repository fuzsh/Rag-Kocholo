She's funny like no other, STUNNING on the inside and out. Independent in the most gorgeous way, cares for everyone even if she doesn't know you.\"\n\nJennifer's post celebrating Courteney's 60th birthday was also peppered with sweet memories of the duo. From a throwback selfie of the women with Courteney's daughter Coco Arquette—who the actress shares with ex David Arquette—to a clip of the pair from Friends with a crying face edited over both of them, the 55-year-old included plenty of sweet, cheeky memories in her post."
