        "text": "Coco Arquette was basically destined to have a fragrance made in her honor. Of course, there's her name, which brings to mind tropical vacations or chocolatey baked goods—as well as Coco Chanel, a fragrance legend. Then, there's the fact that the 19-year-old is a budding It Girl, with 300k Instagram followers and an obvious creative flair. And of course, her mom happens to be Courteney Cox, who heads up Homecourt, a homecare brand with a cult following thanks to its sophisticated scents like Cipris Mint and Steeped Rose.\n\nAnd on July 15, the brand is venturing into personal fragrance and bodycare with the launch of Cocomoi, a fresh and warm fragrance inspired by and created with Coco herself. The fragrance—which has notes of coconut water, cedarwood, fig, vetiver, and black pepper—comes in a body wash, body mist, body cream, a rollerball fragrance, and a candle.\n\n\"Our number one best seller is Cece, which is a very personal sent to me, I've been wearing it for years and years and years—it's a combination of a bunch of oils and a perfume,\" Cox tells me over a Zoom with the pair. \"So I wanted to do something that meant as much to me as Cece does, and that was to do something around and inspired by my daughter, who obviously means even more to me than that.\"\n\nThe call makes me want to hop on a flight to see my mom—they interrupt each other with a quick hug as often as they do with a correction—and I can feel the love they have for each other and the new fragrance through the screen. Ahead, we chat everything Cocomoi, as well as the best beauty advice they've learned from each other, and what smells like home.\n\nThe Inspiration for Cocomoi\n\n\"I wanted to have this sense of family. I wanted to carry some of the notes over [from Cece] ,and that's what I will do when it comes to these very personal scents,\" says Cox. \"So it definitely has some cedar wood in it, it has coconut water, it has pepper and fig; it's just a beautiful scent that's sophisticated. I didn't want it to be just for a youthful group. I wanted it to be for everyone...\" she says, before Arquette jumps in to add that her \"closest guy friend\" loves and wears it, too.\n\nCox adds that the fragrance has a special meaning to her, and is inspired by her daughter's love of water—\"I still kind of want to be a mermaid,\" Arquette confirms. The duo wanted it to smell like summer, but in a sophisticated way, not straight-up sunscreen.\n\n\"It's not a strictly summer scent,\" says Arquette. \"It could be worn going out to a nice dinner, but also fresh out of the shower, about to go to the beach, or fresh out the shower and about to go to bed. It's fresh, but warm at the same time, which is hard to find.\"\n\nArquette helped create the mood board for the fragrance's campaign—\"she has a beautiful eye for detail,\" beamed her mom—so when I ask what outfit the fragrance would be, her answer comes easily: \"I would go off what we wore in the shoot, like crochet, earth tones. Airy, sophisticated, but the same time, a little bit sexy.\"\n\nHow CocoMoi Makes Them Feel\n\nArquette says that she's recently become a bit of a fragrance obsessive, ordering samples from websites like Scent Split. However, out of everything in her stash, Cocomoi gets her the most compliments. \"I feel confident [when I wear it], and I know that I smell good. I think one of my favorite comments is 'oh, you smell so good,' [because] I know you're gonna remember me.\"\n\n\"I feel great, I feel very proud of the scent,\" says Cox. \"We have a body wash and a body butter coming out, and we've created this body butter in a way... believe me, the trial and error, we go through everything. I'm never someone who is satisfied the first round, second, third, fourth, it might take me like nine or 10 [times] where people are just like, 'Oh my god, Courteney!' But we don't stop until it's perfect. And I can say this is perfect.\"\n\nThe Best Beauty Advice They Learned from Each Other\n\nWhen it comes to beauty advice, Arquette says that her mom taught her that \"less is more,\" and she introduced her to two of her favorite products: Shiseido's eyelash curler and Augustinus Bader's The Rich Cream. Then, of course, there's the classic warning from anyone who lived through the '90s: \"Not to pluck my eyebrows!\"\n\n\"So few people have those eyebrows!\" says Cox. \"With her, when she's fresh-faced with those eyebrows, and if she wants a little mascara, a little blush, fine, but I love her just like this—not just because she my child, I promise you! And for me less is more as well. That's my best piece of advice.\" However, Arquette, who tells me she's spent plenty of time watching beauty Youtubers over the years, has taught her mom a thing or two as well.\n\n\"I thought blush was always up here on your cheekbones,\" says Arquette. \"[Coco] does it kind of right on the apple of your cheek, a little bit above it, it kind of goes into where your concealer is, and it makes sense. She also taught me to put highlighter on my nose.\"\n\nThe Beauty Trends They're Loving\n\nDespite their aligned beauty philosophies, Cox and Arquette don't totally agree on the trends they're loving these days. \"I've seen a lot of people wearing no mascara recently, with a bold lip,\" says Arquette. \"I think that's so fun. I love lashes, and I have really long lashes—I will say, it's the one thing I'll be nice to myself about, so I always capitalize on my lashes. But I've been seeing so many people not wear mascara to parties, and I love that, it's fun.\"\n\n\"I don't want to do that,\" Cox quickly cuts in. \"I can't wear bold lipsticks. I did for a while, but times have changed! A beauty trend for me... I take a concealer, right now I'm using a Make concealer, and I just put that on my problem areas and then blend it out as my base.\"\n\nWhat Smells Like Home\n\nWhile Homecourt has only been around since 2022, Cox has always taken special care when it comes to the ambiance of her home. \"My mom has always put wool balls in the dryer that smell good,\" says Arquette, and her mom adds that she would put essential oils in them. \"I don't do that now that I live on my own in New York, I don't have time for the wool balls! I just remember my baby blanket, she's lost now, but my baby blanket smelled like lavender all the time, so the smell of lavender detergent is home to me. But the wool balls made it!\"\n\n\"Scents are really important to me,\" adds Cox. \"Home to me is when I come in and it smells like... well now I love burning Cece, the kitchen smells like Mandarin Basil. It's having something where it's like, 'Wow, that smells good,' and I know it cleaned the house. So it's a great feeling to have something that you know, you love the scent, but actually makes [your house] better, make it look shinier. I will even spray any of the scents on a Swiffer sometimes, and I go around the house just to do a touch up.\""
