        "text": "Courteney Cox believes that her late “Friends” co-star Matthew Perry still “visits” her 7 months after his untimely death.\n\nAppearing on “CBS Sunday Morning,” the actress, who starred as Monica Geller alongside Perry’s Chandler Bing for 10 seasons on the hit show, commemorated the 20th anniversary of the sitcom’s series finale.\n\nIn the show, the pair’s two characters ultimately end up together.\n\n“I think he’s probably one of the funniest human beings in the world. He’s just so funny,” Cox, 59, said. “He is genuinely a huge heart. Obviously struggled.”\n\n“I’m so thankful I got to work so closely with him for so many years. He visits me a lot, if we believe in that.”\n\nCox was then asked to elaborate on her spirituality, revealing that the late actor “guides” her.\n\n“I talk to my mom, my dad, Matthew. I feel like there are a lot of people that, I think, guide us,” she shared. “I do sense — I sense Matthew’s around for sure.”\n\nDays after his tragic death in Oct. 2023, the “Friends” cast — including Cox, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow — shared a joint statement.\n\n“We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family,” the cast wrote at the time.\n\n“In time we will say more, as and when we are able… For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”\n\nTwo weeks later, Cox shared a tribute of her own on social media, as well as a personal memory she had with Perry.\n\n“I am so grateful for every moment I had with you Matty and I miss you every day. When you work with someone as closely as I did with Matthew, there are thousands of moments I wish I could share. For now here’s one of my favorites,” she wrote alongside a clip from the show.\n\n“In this scene, before we started rolling, he whispered a funny line for me to say. He often did things like that. He was funny and he was kind.”\n\nPerry was pronounced dead on Oct. 28, 2023, at age 54 after being found unresponsive in a hot tub at his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif.\n\nIn December, the LA County Medical Examiner’s Office determined the actor died of “acute effects of ketamine.” The manner of death was accidental.\n\nThe autopsy also listed drowning, coronary artery disease and the opioid buprenorphine as contributors to his death.\n\nPerry — who was not married and had no children — had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse."
