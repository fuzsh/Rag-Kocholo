Quotes from/about Matteney, Links to videos, Candids, Fanfic links - just whatever pops into my mind & I think might interest you.\n\nPlease also check the MATTENEY TAG as I haven’t been able to update this page as often as I had hoped to.\n\nQUOTES\n\nMatthew about Courteney:\n\n“I love the show [Cougar Town], I think Courteney obviously is hilarious and a really good friend of mine.” - Interview promoting Mr Sunshine, 2011\n\n“Well.. Courteney and I have spoken on the phone about four times trying to plan a lunch.. which I think will happen at least by November or something. But yes, we’re very close.. in proximity now so..” - ET: Behind the Scenes of MP’s Sunny New Sitcom, January 12, 2011; watch here.\n\n“I was very lucky to marry Courteney Cox. Even on TV.”\n\n(about him getting involved with CC): “It’s certainly a bad thing. A bad idea. In general to, get in a relationship with somebody you work with ‘cause you’re gonna break up and then it’s gonna be bad, and you have to see the person everyday. But, y’know, I don’t wanna say that, and then, y’know, cut to 4 years from now, I’m married to Courteney Cox! And then they’ll play that at the wedding…”\n\n“Courteney is amazing. (…) She’s an amazing dramatic actress too, and that’s what has helped me a great deal in my career and on the show, because we can stop with the joking and have a real moment together.” - FRIENDS, TOW All the Ten Years (Book).\n\n“I was really closest with Courteney..” - MP on Final Friends & CC; watch here.\n\n“I’m a man who has his priorities straight. It’s a RollingStones cover and I’m checking Courteney out.”; watch here.\n\nWhen asked what it was like having worked with Courteney again after such a long time and the reporter phrased it, for lack of a better expression as “Was it like riding a bike?”, he replied with: - “Would Courteney be the bike?”\n\nAccording to Matthew, Courteney can even make a cemetery look good.\n\n“I realised why I was funny on Friends, cause I was just trying to show off for her [Courteney]. She’s very pretty and I just wanted to make her laugh all day long.”\n\n“We try to get together when we can,” Perry said. “Courteney is a great host, and she has a nice place in Malibu and we try to go out there as often as possible.” - Why Matthew Perry Can’t Quit, April 2015\n\nCourteney about Matthew:\n\n“I would love for Matthew to be on the show [Cougar Town].” - An Evening With CT, Panel April 2011, watch here (~1hr16mins)\n\n“I haven’t [seen Matthew’s show Mr Sunshine], but I saw his face on a bus and he looked so cute, I will watch it.” read here.\n\n“He’s got a great heart and great sense of humour. It’s the perfect combination.”\n\n“Matthew already emailed me this morning.. (…) but yeah; I got Matty’s mail already.” (Matthew congratulating her on her GG nomination in January 2010)\n\n”(…) Matthew, who I just love (…)”\n\n“I love you [Matthew Perry] so much.” - watch here.\n\n“Out of the guys, I’m closest to Matthew Perry. He’s a great friend. He cracks me up [on the set].”\n\n“We had so many nicknames on FRIENDS. Most of my names like my cooperation, my house, I just got different names that Matthew Perry came up with. He used to give me so much material, he’s really funny.” - Courteney Cox on Anderson, Feb 24, 2012. - watch here.\n\nOn a scale from 1 to 10, she loves Matthew a “13.6”.\n\nCourteney says she got her personality from Matthew.\n\n“He just came up with all these things and I just copied him forever.” - Courteney in January 2014 on Conan.\n\n“I was reading this quote that Matthew Perry said, which made me laugh,” she said, scrolling through her cellphone to find the quote. “I am getting recognized by a whole new generation of people who are very confused by how old I look.” - Courteney Cox puts her money where her heart is for JBIG, April 2015\n\nIn an email, Courteney Cox, his Friends co-star, cited Perry’s “ability to show very raw emotion and make close connections with his audience” as the reason “everyone loves him so much”. She said that 2012’s Go On - in which he played a character mourning the death of his wife - was her favorite of Perry’s recent work, and the most him. “I loved that Matthew found a way to make his character relatable by showing vulnerability in the personal struggles he was facing,” Cox wrote. - Why Matthew Perry Can’t Quit, April 2015\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\nSo how does Matthew feel about kicking his former TV wife off the tube — even if it is just for a few weeks?\n\n- Matthew tells Mark that he called Courteney and they had a laugh about it, (…) read here.\n\n“When someone asked Courteney if Matthew was a good kisser, she said “fantastic”, and when Matthew was asked the same thing, he said, “Very good. I definitely needed some alone time after that.” - source.\n\nWhen asked if there was ever a time that Matthew just couldn’t resist Courteney, he answered that it was the other way around; that she hadn’t been able to resist him (apparently!).\n\nVIDEOS\n\nSome cute vids of Matteney you should check out (some may have been linked in the QUOTES-section before):\n\nCourteney and Matthew behind the scenes for Cougar Town in Dec 2013\n\nCourteney and Matthew interview behind the scenes of “Go On” in 2013\n\n#1 Courteney & Matthew at the Daisy Does America premiere in 2006\n\n#2 Courteney & Matthew at the Daisy Does America premiere in 2006\n\nFriends-cast on Entertainment Tonight, 2003\n\nCourteney Cox (/w Matthew) on the Johnny Show, 1999\n\nCourteney Cox on Jay Leno (/w Matthew), 1997\n\nCourteney kissing Matthew Perry on Jay Leno (promoting “Fools Rush In”), 1998\n\nTV Guide Special Cover Story: FRIENDS.
