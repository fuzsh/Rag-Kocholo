        "text": "Credit: Latour/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nCourteney Cox and Johnny McDaid: A Timeline of Their Relationship\n\nCourteney Cox and Johnny McDaid have been going strong since fall 2013, and their 10-year relationship has only continued to bloom in the time since. After first being introduced by mutual friend Ed Sheeran, the former Friends star and Snow Patrol musician began dating in September 2013, entering a whirlwind romance that saw them getting engaged less than a year later in June 2014. Despite a blip in their relationship — the two called off their engagement in November 2014 but were back together by March 2015 — the stars have seemed incredibly happy together, frequently gushing about each other in interviews and on social media. “I know that I’ve never loved like I love this woman,” McDaid told Us Weekly in May 2016. For her part, Cox frequently shares cozy Instagram posts with the Irish guitarist. “He's the kindest, most patient, best listener, curious, caring, not to mention talented and gorgeous partner,” she captioned an Instagram birthday tribute to her beau in July 2021. “I love you jmd.” Scroll down to see Cox and McDaid’s romance through the years:\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Courteney Cox/Twitter\n\nJune 2014\n\nCox and McDaid announced their engagement on social media on June 26, 2014 with a sweet selfie.\n\nThe TV star later revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that the Snow Patrol singer popped the question while at her 50th birthday party at Aniston’s house — and that he asked her daughter, Coco, for permission. “He said, 'I'd like to marry your mom,' and gave her a little diamond ring,” she recalled. “She said, 'Great, I'm going to camp tomorrow. Let's do it right now.’”\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nAugust 2016\n\nCox explained to Bear Grylls why exactly she and McDaid split, calling the breakup “so brutal.”\n\n“There’s something about … you know, he’s from Ireland. And the way he regards love is precious. … I didn’t know how to regard love the way he does,” she explained, adding, “I didn’t know how to bring it in. It was always external. I definitely have learned a lot, and no matter what, I will be a better person from that breakup.”\n\nCredit: John Salangsang/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nJune 2017\n\nCox opened up about the possibility of having kids with McDaid.\n\n“I would love to have a baby now,” she told NewBeauty at the time, elaborating, “I mean, I could carry someone else’s egg. I may be one of the older people doing it, but I would love to, with Johnny that is.”\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nThe Cougar Town star once again revealed her true feelings about her longtime partner in an interview with People.\n\nMcDaid is “a great listener. And I've never met someone more patient,\" she told the outlet. \"He's a great advice-giver. I love his heart, his intentions. His morals. He's extremely talented and obviously musical, but he's a poet and a writer. He's just so smart, and I find that really sexy. And then he is gorgeous.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Courteney Cox/Instagram\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nThe couple playfully recreated the iconic Dirty Dancing lift via Instagram with the help of Ed Sheeran and photographer and director Jason Koenig. In the video, Cox convinces her longtime love to lift her up over his head like Patrick Swayze does with Jennifer Grey, but things go awry.\n\nMcDaid jumps toward his partner — instead of the other way around — before the footage cuts to show an ambulance driving away. “It’s ok we’re professionals,” Cox joked in the caption.\n\nCredit: JC Olivera/Getty Images for BMI\n\nApril 2024\n\n“So three years in, we broke up, and it was really intense. We broke up in therapy,” Cox revealed during an interview on Minnie Driver’s “Minnie Questions” podcast. “I didn’t know it was coming.”\n\nCox explained that she and McDaid were in therapy at the time to work out “boundaries” in their relationship. “I was in so much pain, I also don’t like surprises. And he’s an incredible human being so he wasn’t trying to surprise me,” she added. “He was in that much pain in the relationship. There was that much that needed to be dealt with that he had to protect himself around his heart.”\n\nCox went on to note that she was “so thankful” for their split, stating that they had a “different relationship” upon getting back together. “But also because it really taught me how I operated in the world — what were the things from my childhood that I needed,” she shared. “Whether it was to be adored by men. Things that I didn't know how to let go to be in a relationship. To not take things personally. My boundaries, I just went into myself and I had a great therapist.”"
