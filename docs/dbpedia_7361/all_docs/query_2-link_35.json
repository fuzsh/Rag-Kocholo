        "text": "Courtney Cox\n\nCourtney Cox was a member of the 2023-24 New York Times Fellowship class, a program for journalists early in their careers, working on The Upshot, a team that publishes analytical and explanatory journalism. She left The Times in May 2024. Below is the last version of her Times bio.\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nI make complex ideas easy to understand through data analysis and visualization, covering stories found in rabbit holes and spreadsheets. I’m a member of the team that produces Flashback, The Upshot’s weekly history quiz, so you’ll also frequently find me digging through academic journals, books and historical archives.\n\nMy Background\n\nI’m from bourbon and horse country: Lexington, Ky., where, in spring 2023, I completed a master’s degree in digital mapping (the most unusual, “smart-weird” degree, according to a College Consensus list).\n\nAs a self-described artsy person with a knack for puzzles and spreadsheets, I delight in transforming ungainly data into beautiful charts and maps.\n\nAs a hard-of-hearing/partly deaf reporter, I keep the topic of accessibility in the forefront of my mind. When designing data graphics and writing about numbers, I strive to create equitable experiences for all, including but not limited to people with visual, cognitive and vestibular disabilities and/or with neurodiverse identities. I’m always open to receiving ideas and feedback on the accessibility of my work.\n\nJournalistic Ethics"
