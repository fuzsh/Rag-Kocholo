        "text": "Even after death, Matthew Perry is still there for Courteney Cox. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the Friends star opened up about her ongoing connection with the late Perry, who died last year at the age of 54.\n\n“I think he’s probably one of the funniest human beings in the world. You know, he’s just so funny,” said Cox. “He is genuinely a huge heart, obviously struggled. I’m so thankful I got to work so closely with him for so many years. He visits me a lot, if we believe in that.”\n\nCox and Perry played friends turned lovers Monica and Chandler on Friends for a decade, from 1994 to 2004. This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Friends series finale, “The Last One,” which Cox commemorated on her Instagram page. “It’s been 20 years since the series finale of Friends,” she wrote. “I don’t know how we were able to act through all the tears. Forever grateful.”\n\nIn the interview promoting Cox’s new homeware line, Homecourt, CBS Sunday Morning reporter Jonathan Vigliotti pointed out that Cox is a spiritual person, prompting Cox to talk about her ongoing connection with her deceased parents, Richard Lewis Cox and Courteney Copeland, and Perry. “I talk to my mom, my dad, Matthew. I feel like there are a lot of people that, I think, guide us,” she said. “I do sense—I sense Matthew’s around, for sure.”\n\nOn October 28, 2023, Perry, who struggled for years with drug and alcohol use, was pronounced dead after he was found unresponsive in a hot tub at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. An autopsy found that Perry’s death was accidental and that he died of “acute effects of ketamine.” Other contributors to Perry’s death included drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of a drug, buprenorphine, used to treat opioid use disorder.\n\nAfter Perry’s passing, Cox paid tribute to Perry with Friends costars Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, and Matt LeBlanc. “We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew,” they said in a joint statement to People. “We were more than just castmates. We are a family.” Cox honored Perry individually on Instagram by posting an outtake from the iconic scene in which it’s first revealed that Monica and Chandler slept together.\n\n“Chandler and Monica were supposed to have a one night fling in London. But because of the audience’s reaction, it became the beginning of their love story,” she wrote. “In this scene, before we started rolling, he whispered a funny line for me to say. He often did things like that. He was funny and he was kind.”\n\nHollywood\n\nConan O’Brien Was Once “Jealous” After Ex Lisa Kudrow Praised Matthew Perry’s Performance on Friends\n\n“I make you laugh pretty hard. And you were like, ‘No, no, you don’t understand. This guy’s really [funny],’” O’Brien recalled of Kudrow’s initial reaction to her late costar.\n\nRoyals\n\nMeghan Markle Is One Year Older, Wants Us All to Be Wiser About Online Safety\n\nOn Sunday, the duchess and Prince Harry announced the Parents’ Network, an Archewell Foundation peer-support program for parents whose children have faced harms on social media and the internet.\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nRoyals\n\nMeghan Markle Reveals New Online Safety Initiative Is Part of Her Healing Journey During Emotional Interview\n\nThe Parents’ Network, a new initiative from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, is intended to assist families of children lost due to social media harm.\n\nCelebrity\n\nJennifer Aniston Slams J.D. Vance’s Resurfaced Remarks About “Childless Cat Ladies”\n\nAniston, who has been candid about her own struggle to conceive, also criticized Trump’s running mate for voting against the Right to IVF Act: “Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.”\n\nHollywood\n\n“He’s Absolutely Extraordinary”: Remembering Robin Williams\n\nOn the 10-year anniversary of Robin Williams’s untimely passing, we asked more than 20 of his costars, collaborators, and friends—including Billy Crystal, Matt Damon, Ben Stiller, Al Pacino, Sally Field, Jeff Bridges, and Julianne Moore—for their favorite memories of this kind, playful, and uniquely intelligent artist.\n\nCelebrity\n\nOprah Winfrey and Gayle King: “If We Were Gay, We’d Tell You”\n\nThey’ve been friends for nearly half a century, and, yeah, they’ve heard the rumors.\n\nMovies\n\nIt Ends With Us: The 5 Biggest Changes From Book to Movie\n\nThe big-screen version of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel ages up the characters and scraps a whole Ellen DeGeneres subplot.\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry Says Meghan Markle Isn’t Safe in the UK: “All It Takes Is One Lone Actor”\n\nIn a recent interview about his ongoing legal battles against a handful of British tabloids, the prince said the danger is that it only takes “one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read.”\n\nMovies\n\nAmy Adams Hears the Call of the Wild in Nightbitch\n\n“When people ask me what the movie is about, I’m like, ‘It’s about motherhood and rage,’” says director Marielle Heller in this exclusive first look. “And you either get that or you don’t.”"
