        "text": "Courteney Cox has shared how her bond with her late Friends co-star Matthew Perry has continued after his death.\n\nIn a conversation for CBS Sunday Morning, Cox reflected on 2024 marking 30 years since the Friends premiere. She told Vigliotti that for the 10 years she was on the NBC sitcom, her co-stars were her “family,” as they went through “everything” together.\n\nReflecting on Perry, Cox said, “I think he’s one of the funniest human beings in the world. He’s just so funny. He’s genuinely [got] a huge heart. [He] obviously struggled.”\n\nThe actress then said that she is “so thankful” she “got to work so closely with him for so many years” and has retained a connection with her co-star’s spirit.\n\n“He visits me a lot, if we believe in that,” she shared. “I talk to my mom, my dad, Matthew. I feel like there are a lot of people that are…I think they guide us.” Cox added that she senses that Perry’s spirit is “around for sure.”\n\nPerry died on Oct. 28, 2023 at age 54 from the acute effects of anesthetic ketamine. Weeks after his death, Cox penned a tribute on social media, looking back at her decades-long friendship with her former co-star.\n\n“I am so grateful for every moment I had with you Matty and I miss you every day,” she wrote in the caption of an Instagram post."
