        "text": "\"Yeah, it always hurt my feelings,\" Cox said. \"When every single cast member was nominated but me, it definitely hurt my feelings. I was happy for everybody, and then when it was finally like, 'Oh, I'm the only one?' It hurt.\"\n\nDavid Schwimmer (Ross Geller) and Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing) received one nod each for \"Friends,\" while Matt Le Blanc earned three nominations for the show for playing Joey Tribbiani. However, none of the three men won any of their nominations.\n\nJennifer Aniston earned five nominations for playing Rachel Green in \"Friends,\" taking home an award in 2002 (lead actress in a comedy series). But it's Phoebe Buffay actress Lisa Kudrow who received the most nominations for \"Friends\" with six nods in total. She won in 1998 for supporting actress in a comedy series.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAll five of Cox's costars have also been Emmy nominated for other projects throughout their careers. Cox has not. However, she did earn a Golden Globe nomination in 2010 for \"Cougar Town\" (best actress in a comedy/musical TV series) and this made her feel better about her previous shoutouts, the actress said.\n\n\"The only thing that made me feel good — because they've all won and they've gotten so many accolades — I got nominated for 'Cougar Town' the first year [out] — a Golden Globe. And I want to say, 'Oh, who cares?' It meant everything to me,\" Cox explained.\n\n\"I wanted my peers to respect me and I know that the Golden Globes is not your peers, necessarily, but it's like, 'Ah!' It took a little of the sting out.\"\n\nCox did the Howard Stern interview alongside Aniston and Kudrow and clarified that despite being upset that she was consistently snubbed by the Emmys, she always supported her costars no matter what and routed for them when they were nominated.\n\n\"I want them to win,\" Cox said. \"I've never wanted to take anything away from anyone. I just sometimes want to be included in certain things … And these girls on the show and the guys, everyone deserved every [nomination]. I'm in awe of both of your talent.\"\n\nAniston is the friend who has most recently received significant awards attention, earning Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for \"The Morning Show.\" She also won a Screen Actors' Guild award, too, and a second season is on its way this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Cox will next be seen in the 2022 instalment of \"Scream.\""
