        "text": "A year ago, I embarked on an incredible journey at Avaya and what a transformative year it has been! Time truly flew by, feeling like about five years packed into one. From a new job to a new house, engagement, marriage, and welcoming a baby, it's been a whirlwind 😅 Unlike many in my generation, I haven't hopped between companies frequently. Joining Avaya was my first big move since entering the workforce eleven years ago after college 🤯 and it was absolutely the right one! Grateful for the amazing experiences and the wonderful Avayans who have become like family during this past year. They've been there for so many significant milestones in my life, and I couldn't be more thankful. Excited to see what year 2 holds! After returning from maternity leave, my role has evolved, and I'm thrilled to be part of the dream team supporting our partnership with C1! It’s always a great day when you get to help elevate connected human experiences through innovation without disruption 😉(I love how well our taglines work together!) Now let’s go get it! 👏🏼\n\nDuring maternity leave I became more acquainted with a certain technology more than ever… contact centers. Insurance companies, hospitals, doctors offices, pharmacies, you name it.. I called them. Usually I called them on the brink of exhaustion, waiting for Finn to be hungry or need me to be quiet so he could nap, or staring at a pile of laundry or dishes I needed to attend to instead of picking up the phone *again*. It made me realize more than ever how important customer experience is, and proud to be part of a company that has been enabling contact centers to create great experiences for decades and continues to focus on innovation (without disruption) in this space. Digital channels are my best friend these days. Companies that will text with me? Oh, you are getting some of my money! 💰 Your agent already knows the details about my last four calls about my incorrect bill? I’ll still be annoyed about the bill, but thank you for not making me repeat myself 🙌🏼 You personalize our interaction and call me by my name when you answer? We are about to be pals. You connect me with an agent through a callback without sitting there for an hour on hold and I didn’t have to scream agent ten times? Now. We. Are. Cooking. With. Gas. 🔥 As you look to innovate your contact center to meet the needs of today’s customer, your friends at Avaya are here to help. These journeys don’t happen overnight, and thankfully Avaya Experience Platform allows you to innovate without disruption at your own pace. Your customers will thank you. Especially those tired mamas that just need those extra five minutes to soak up some newborn snuggles. Signed, A mama who got extra snuggles because of Avaya’s innovation *cute baby pic for tax*\n\nWith Mother’s Day just a few days away, I figured it was the perfect time to let y’all know I got the biggest promotion of my life last month becoming a mom! Our son, Finlay aka “Finn”, arrived on April Fools Day, and y’all know there isn’t a better day for my child to be born 🤪 To all the moms I have the pleasure of getting to work with, I’m so proud of you! I’m celebrating all of you this weekend, and everyday! I’ll be back early July after some more quality time thanks to Avaya with this cool little dude. I can’t wait for him to meet his channel family that has already loved on him so much… he will be trained up on the cloud in no time. Happy Mother’s Day! Time to call your mama!\n\nA little birdie told me that March is the perfect time to celebrate the women in our lives, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t celebrate this amazing lady! Although she needs no introduction, meet Samotria Holmes. Many of you know her as Samotria or Sam, but to me she will always be my Sammie! She was my first female leader in my career. I began reporting to Sammie about 6 months in at ScanSource. I remember a very distinct moment where I went to ask her if I could lower my margin on headsets for one of my partners so I could win more of their run rate business. Instead of just saying yes or no, Sammie said “this is your business. What do YOU think you should do?” Cue the lightbulb moment that I was capable and didn’t need my hand held… and we subsequently won millions of dollars business because she told my to trust my own knowledge of the business. Talk about a confidence booster. We all need (and deserve) a Sammie in our career. I’m so thankful I didn’t have to wait long to be led by her, because I don’t know if I’d be where I am today without her helping shape me. She made me more confident in my abilities, held me accountable to always do my best, and gave me grace and helped me learn from my mistakes (and I made plenty). Although it’s been almost 8 years since she was my sales leader, she’s stayed a part of my professional and personal life as one of my closest confidants, and basically a Cox family member at this point. Two weeks ago she stood on our front porch with us and officiated our wedding. If that isn’t special, I don’t know what is. If you haven’t found your Sammie yet, I hope you do soon! If you have, I hope you’ll take the time to celebrate her.. not just during women’s history month, but everyday. Thank you for being YOU, Sammie! 🫶🏼\n\nSince the channel is one big extended family anyway, I figured I’d let y’all in on a surprise! On our front porch in front of our families on Friday Craig and I made it official… I’m a married woman! You can tell that Bowie was just as excited for this as everyone else, although he’s thought we were married for years now (like many others 🤪). Y’all may start seeing my new last name, Gillespie, pop up, but I’ll always be Coco to y’all! I’ll let yall ease into it. It’s truly been a year of change over here and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Thank you to all the channel friends who have become family for being here and celebrating every moment with us!\n\nNothing better than getting to sit down with Brittany (Fuller) Caito and learn more about how this amazing woman juggles all of it! As I get close to the arrival of my first baby, having women like Brittany to look up to, seek advice from and have as a friend through all walks of life is so very important, and I’m so thankful! Not only is Brittany a beloved member of the channel community as a Senior NPM at Nextiva, she’s a board member of the Alliance of Channel Women leading the way for women to form deeper connections within our community, and so much more. Most important of all, she’s an amazing wife and a mother of two! I’m so proud to call her a friend, and an aunt of my soon to arrive son. Take a few minutes out of your day to learn more about Brittany, I know that I got some great pointers out of this conversation and hope you will too! #acw #womeninbusiness\n\nIt’s here! 🎉 My full episode of “Let’s Talk” with Travis Curnutte of Volli released today, and watching back through it made Monday a little more fun. I’m so thankful for the support and friendship I get from Travis, and hope you’ll take the time to watch and get to know him, too! He really is the Joe Rogan to my Theo Von 🤣 Somehow I figured out how to talk about Chick-fil-A, Harry Potter and Taylor Swift all in one sentence, so you know this is some hard hitting stuff 🤪 Of course, we covered my journey to Avaya and how I got started in this industry over a decade ago! Thank you for letting me talk about my journey in the channel, it’s people like you that make it so special! 🫶🏼 How to watch/listen:🎧 Youtube: https://lnkd.in/gArqUcqr Spotify: https://lnkd.in/eCn_pdP8 Google: https://lnkd.in/gEJQmmfR"
