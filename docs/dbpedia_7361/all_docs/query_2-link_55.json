        "text": "Prince Harry once debated telling Friends star Courteney Cox about his crush on her when he was crashing at her place in the US.\n\nMost recently, claims that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry calling their daughter the Queen’s nickname left her ‘angry’ surfaced. However, before Harry was a married man and a father of two (Archie, 4, and Lilibet, 2) he was a young man who liked to party. Given the Prince’s royal status, it wasn’t uncommon for him to hang out with A-list Hollywood celebrities. One time he almost confessed his crush to American actress Courteney Cox.\n\nPrince Harry debated telling Courteney Cox about his crush\n\nPrince Harry notes in his 2023 memoir Spare that he stayed in the Friends actor’s place in Los Angeles.\n\n“We went from the home of Thomas’s girlfriend to the home of Courteney Cox,” writes the 39-year-old. At the time, Courteney was traveling for a job and didn’t mind if the group, including Prince Harry, crashed at her place.\n\n“As a Friends fanatic, the idea of crashing at Monica’s was highly appealing,” Harry says in his autobiography. However, Courteney showed up at the house soon after the group came. Harry began wondering why the actress was back early and also wondered if they’d have to leave.\n\n“Of course not Harry, plenty of room” Courteney reportedly told him.\n\nThe smitten Duke notes how he still thought of Courteney as Monica. “And I was a Chandler,” he wrote. “I wondered if I’d ever work up the courage to tell her.”\n\nHe went on to claim there wasn’t enough tequila in California to give him the courage to confess his crush. Courteney soon invited more people over and it turned into a party.\n\nCourteney thinks Harry is a ‘nice person’\n\nTalking to Variety about her cameo in Prince Harry’s memoir, the 59-year-old actress said, “He did stay here for a couple of days — probably two or three. He’s a nice person.”\n\nCommenting on the Duke’s highly controversial book, she said, “I haven’t read the book. I do want to hear it because I’ve heard it’s entertaining. But yes, it’s gotten back to me about it.”\n\nHarry spoke about binge-watching Friends in his book. “Day after day, night after night, I sat around eating takeaway, watching 24. Or Friends. I think I might’ve watched every episode of Friends in 2013. I decided I was a Chandler,” he said.\n\nDuke was compared to Bridget Jones in a savage interview\n\nIn his book Spare, Harry recalled a savage interview with a journalist in which the journo called him Bridget Jones.\n\nFollowing Princess Charlotte’s birth, Harry was pushed to fifth place in the line of succession, with Prince George and Charlotte placed before him.\n\nHarry remembers the journalist told him “‘But you’re further down the line of succession.’ The journalist pressed: Fifth in line – hm. No longer even the Spare of the Spare.”\n\nThe awkward encounter didn’t stop there.\n\nThe journalist asked Harry, “Isn’t it time you settled down?” before dropping the bomb, “People are starting to compare you to Bridget Jones.”"
