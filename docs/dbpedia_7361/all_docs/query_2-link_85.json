        "text": "Courteney Cox has expressed her regret for the past use of anti-ageing injectables.\n\nThe former Friends star said she did not personally notice that she looked “a little off” until it was pointed out by others.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Courteney Cox on Sunrise.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nThe 58-year-old expressed her gratitude that she managed to remove all the product and is now as natural as she can be.\n\n“It’s a domino effect. You don’t realise that you look a little off, so then you keep doing more, ‘cause you look normal to yourself,” Cox said on the Gloss Angeles podcast.\n\n“You look in the mirror and go, ‘Oh, that looks good’ … You don’t realise what it looks like to the outside person.”\n\nThe actress said that, upon realising she had gone a step too far, she “had them removed” in 2017.\n\n“Thank God they are removable,” Cox said.\n\n“I messed up a lot and now luckily … I was able to reverse most of that.”\n\nShe said that, over time, her attitude to ageing has changed, calling the previous concerns she had “a waste of time”.\n\n“Thinking I was getting older when I was really young - that’s just a bummer, a waste of time,” Cox said.\n\nThe actress first spoke out about her plastic surgery regrets during a 2016 episode of NBC’s Running Wild.\n\n“I think there’s a pressure to maintain (your looks) not just because of fame, but just being a woman in this business,” she said at the time.\n\n“Getting older, I don’t think that’s the easiest thing. But I have learned lessons.\n\n“I think I was trying to keep up with getting older and trying to chase that. It’s something you can’t keep up with.\n\n“Sometimes you find yourself trying, and then you look at a picture of yourself and you go, ‘Oh God, I look horrible’.\n\n“I have done things that I regret, and luckily there are things that dissolve and go away.\n\n“So that’s good, because it’s not always been my best look.”\n\nCox was recently honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, celebrating on February 27 with close friends and family.\n\nAs part of the ceremony, her former co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow spoke about their 30-year-long friendship with Cox, who - apart from her iconic role as Monica Geller in Friends - has starred in Cougar Town, 3000 Miles to Graceland and the popular Scream franchise.\n\n“We’re very honoured to be here to speak on your behalf as your co-workers, your friends, and your family, your sisters - and that’s happened since we’ve known you for a very long time,” Aniston said.\n\nAniston then revealed the trio bonded on set over poker, even though Cox “loathed it from the bottom of her heart”.\n\n“She played with us ‘cause she wanted to bond with us,” Aniston said, before going on to refer to Cox’s obsession - not unlike that of the fastidious Monica Geller - with the finer details.\n\n“You really wanna hope that you don’t have any kind of, like, a stain or a spot on a wall or that a pillow is out of place or that a hair or something that needs to be plucked,” Aniston joked.\n\n“So, I’m just saying, thank God this (Hollywood) star is straight.”\n\nCox said she was overcome by the tribute.\n\n“I can’t believe all my friends are here. It’s so nice,” she said.\n\nAsked if she thought she’d ever see her name permanently cemented on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, she answered: “Not in a million years”.\n\n“I’m from Birmingham, Alabama,” she said.\n\n“It’s just not something you think would be a possibility.\n\n“But I did know that Friends was special.”\n\nFor more engaging celebrity content, visit 7Life on Facebook.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
