        "text": "Courteney Cox was photographed having a seemingly heated conversation with her 19-year-old daughter, Coco Arquette, at London’s Heathrow Airport Monday.\n\nThe “Friends” alum, 59, stoically looked at her daughter, who passionately pointed at her mother during their animated discussion.\n\nHowever, it’s unclear what the mother-daughter duo were discussing.\n\nFor their day of travel, the “Scream” franchise star went casual as she was spotted wearing blue denim jeans, a black zip-up sweater and matching jacket.\n\nAs for Arquette, she wore dark brown sweats with white sneakers and a mustard yellow backpack.\n\nDespite their animated conversation, they have always been close.\n\nIn fact, the mother-daughter duo were all smiles at the New York City premiere of “Scream 6” in March 2023.\n\nAt the time, Arquette stunned in a corseted red midi dress and black platform sandals while posing for photos with her mom on the red carpet.\n\nCox wore a black blazer layered over a clingy LBD, opaque tights and slingback pumps.\n\nThe actress shares her daughter with ex-husband David Arquette, whom she married in1999 after meeting on the set of “Scream.”\n\nDespite welcoming Coco in June 2004, they struggled to conceive a baby at the beginning of their marriage.\n\n“It was really weird because everyone in my family has kids,” Cox told NBC News in May 2004.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I mean, they pop out like it’s nobody’s business. No one in my family has a problem. So to me, I just thought this would not be a problem at all.”\n\nFilming “Friends” during her fertility journey was also “hard,” Cox added at the time.\n\n“I remember one time I just had a miscarriage and [Jennifer Aniston’s character] Rachel was giving birth. It was, like, that same time,” she explained, referencing the Season 8 finale of the hit NBC sitcom.\n\n“Oh, my God, it was terrible having to be funny.”\n\nNine years after Coco’s birth, Cox and David split. She went on to marry her current husband, Johnny McDaid, in 2013 and continues to have a “supportive” co-parenting relationship with David, 52.\n\n“We’ve communicated a lot because of Coco,” David, who now shares sons Charlie and Augustus with wife Christina McLarty, told Yahoo! Entertainment in August 2020.\n\n“We’ve been really open and supportive of each other,” he said of his “Scream” co-star.\n\n“We never went head-to-head [or] battled each other through the process of divorce and through the process of raising our kid, so it’s made for a … relationship that is out of respect.”"
