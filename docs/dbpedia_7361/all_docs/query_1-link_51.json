        "text": "Swiatek hit with none other than Courteney Cox Tuesday, where she debuted her On kit for the clay-court major at a special event organized by the performance apparel brand. Cox is most recognizably known for portraying Monica Geller on the iconic sitcom âFriendsâ for 10 years.\n\nThe two previously exchanged pleasantries on Instagram in October 2022.\n\n\"If we'd play doubles together, no one would have hit you,\" Swiatek commented on Cox's video of serves coming at her. The American responded, \"Ok come over and we'll take him on! I mean this.\"\n\nTennis notably appeared on the show as an episode arc involving Coxâs character. Early in Gellerâs relationship with Chandler Bing, played by the late Matthew Perry, the couple joined forces for a doubles match against Bingâs boss and wife.\n\nWith Geller taking no prisoners, Bing asked her to let them win the next game.\n\n\"Iâm sorry, I donât understand what you just said,\" responded the ever-competitive Geller.\n\nSwiatek can probably relate through her infamous dominant scorelines that fans refer to as âIgaâs Bakery Factoryâ throughout the year.\n\nThe world No. 1 is aiming to pull off a Roland Garros three-peat and collect her fourth crown in five years at the seasonâs second Grand Slam event. The draw will be revealed Thursday at 2 p.m. local time.\n\nThe 22-year-old defeated Karolina Muchova over three sets to clinch the 2023 title."
