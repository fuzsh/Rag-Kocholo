        "text": "After playing Monica Geller on Friends for ten years, we’re not surprised to learn that Courteney Cox shares a few of the same traits as her famous character.\n\nThe 56-year-old actress poked fun at the fact she is also a perfectionist when it comes to having an organized kitchen in a playful video she shared with fans on Instagram.\n\nCourteney put her spin on a popular Tell Me Without Telling Me TikTok challenge – which sees social media users ask others to reveal something without using direct mentioning or showing the subject matter.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Thursday, Courteney’s video read: ‘Tell me you’re a Monica without telling me you’re a Monica’\n\nThe actress then stated, ‘I’ll go first’, before she proceeded to showcase her immaculately tidy kitchen draws and cupboards that would make her character proud.\n\nShe then chucked in a tamers version of Monica’s famous catchphrase as she quipped: ‘I know’.\n\n‘Am I the only one? #monica #friends’, the Cougar Town star captioned the video.\n\nThe Dirt star probably has Monica on the brain because she recently met up withformer castmates Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry to film the Friends reunion.\n\nAfter lengthy delays, the cast wrapped production on their eagerly awaited reunion for HBO Max last week – which will air 17 years after the finale aired.\n\nThe gang – who played Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey and Chandler on the sitcom – haven’t been on screen as a sextet since the final episode in 2004, and will discuss their time on the show in the non-scripted special.\n\nDavid Schwimmer explained on The Graham Norton Show: ‘I’ll be David. Nothing is scripted and we are not in character.\n\n‘We are all ourselves, although there is one section of it that I don’t want to give away, but we all read something.’\n\nThe Friends Reunion will air on HBO Max in the US.\n\nGot A Showbiz Story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Friends reunion: Behind the scenes of HBO Max’s upcoming special"
