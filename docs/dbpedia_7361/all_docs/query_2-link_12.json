        "text": "Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid make love work.\n\nThe Friends alum and the Snow Patrol musician met at a star-studded house party Cox hosted in 2013, and she had an instant crush on him. Though they've had their share of ups and downs — including a brief split in 2014 and nine months spent living on separate continents due to the COVID-19 pandemic — their admiration for each other is unwavering.\n\n\"[He's] a great listener. And I've never met someone more patient,\" Cox told PEOPLE in January 2022. \"He's a great advice-giver. I love his heart, his intentions. His morals. He's extremely talented and obviously musical, but he's a poet and a writer. He's just so smart, and I find that really sexy. And then he is gorgeous.\"\n\nMcDaid is equally smitten. \"My thoughts are never without Court,\" he told PEOPLE in October 2018. \"She's my best friend. She's my partner, in everything. When I write her poems, it's just an extension of how I feel every second anyway.\"\n\nThe Irish musician is also close with Cox's daughter, Coco, whom she shares with ex-husband David Arquette. In fact, McDaid involved a then-10-year-old Coco in his proposal to Cox, though the couple ultimately called off their engagement and never got re-engaged following their reconciliation.\n\nFrom their first meeting to their reunion after months apart, here is everything to know about Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid's relationship.\n\n2013: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid meet\n\nThe couple first met at a star-studded house party at Cox's home in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring a March 2022 appearance on Howard Stern's radio show, the Friends alum reflected on her and McDaid's first encounter.\n\nShe explained that her friend Christa Miller had invited Ed Sheeran over to her house and he brought along his musician friends, including Taylor Swift and Snow Patrol members McDaid and Gary Lightbody. Meanwhile, Cox invited pals Sacha Baron Cohen, Isla Fisher and Friends costar Jennifer Aniston.\n\n\"I remember seeing Johnny and going, 'Oh, wow. He's really intense.' He's got the eyes, and he's playing the piano,\" Cox said. \"And I thought 'Oh he's really really handsome.' \"\n\nShe then told Fisher about her crush on the guitarist, who relayed the message to her husband, Cohen.\n\nCox recalled: \"Sacha walks up [to McDaid and Lightbody] and says, 'Hey! Courteney wants to f--- one of you from Snow Patrol. And it's not you, Gary.' \"\n\nIt turned out that McDaid was in L.A. working with Sheeran on his new album.\n\nDecember 8, 2013: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid are spotted together for the first time\n\nThe Cougar Town star and Snow Patrol guitarist were seen looking cozy at Aniston's annual holiday bash in Bel Air, California.

The evening was also special for McDaid, who contributed to the soundtrack.\n\n\"I've had a lot more support from him than him just being here tonight,\" Cox told PEOPLE at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere in New York City. \"Snow Patrol wrote three original songs for this movie. … I couldn't be happier. It really elevates the film in so many ways.\"\n\nPost-screening, McDaid and his bandmate Lightbody performed at the afterparty. They sang the songs from the film as well as their 2006 hit \"Chasing Cars.\"\n\n\"It was Courteney's night, but she wanted to cheer on her boyfriend,\" an onlooker told PEOPLE. \"She was swatting cameras away and told everyone in the crowd to quiet down … She was standing front row, singing and dancing along to their whole set.\"\n\nJune 15, 2014: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid celebrate her 50th birthday in Turks and Caicos\n\nCox and McDaid vacationed on the beach in Turks and Caicos to celebrate Cox's 50th birthday.

Then I was like, 'This is for real!' \"\n\nWhen asked about wedding plans, McDaid hugged Cox and told PEOPLE: \"I just want to be with this woman for the rest of my life. That is all that matters. The ceremonies are academic.\"\n\nApril 21, 2015: Courteney Cox's daughter Coco wants to plan her mom's wedding to Johnny McDaid\n\nIn early April 2015, Coco attended her dad's wedding to Christina McLarty, where she performed Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You.\"\n\n\"She sang two songs. She's just loving this wedding stuff,\" her mom bragged during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show later that month.\n\nCox added that her daughter was \"very excited\" about her own wedding. \"I was going to hire a wedding planner, but apparently she wants to do it,\" Cox said.\n\nIn fact, Coco had planned to be the maid of honor, flower girl and \"all the bridesmaids.\"\n\nDecember 2015: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid call off their engagement\n\nCox and McDaid ended their engagement nearly two years after they first met.\n\nAt the time, a source close to the couple told PEOPLE, \"They've been having problems for a long time.\"\n\nMarch 27, 2016: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid reunite for lunch\n\nThe pair appeared to be back on in March 2016, when they joined her daughter Coco for Easter lunch at a local restaurant before going shopping in Malibu, California.

And the way he regards love is precious. We have to treat it in a different way. It's more special — you coddle it. So I didn't know how to regard love the way he does. And I definitely made a lot of mistakes that I see — whether it's codependency or people-pleasing. I didn't know how to bring it in. It was always external.\"\n\nCox added that their relationship was in a \"new context\" after their \"brutal\" breakup.\n\n\"Everything's new,\" she said. \"And we have both really worked on ourselves on the parts that needed the most attention. And it feels really different.\"\n\nSeptember 21, 2016: Johnny McDaid gets a tattoo of Courteney Cox's initials\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram post, the Snow Patrol musician showed off the new ink he got in honor of Cox.\n\n\"Ta-two,\" McDaid wrote alongside a selfie of him and Cox.

She added that this was the third year they had spent the New Year there.\n\n\"It's the most beautiful place,\" Cox said. \"It's fantastic.

And you walk for 45 minutes and go to this small little place.\"\n\nJanuary 29, 2019: Courteney Cox clarifies relationship with Johnny McDaid\n\nWhile appearing on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, the actress defined their relationship status with McDaid.\n\n\"He's not my fiancé. We were engaged to be married, but now we're just together,\" she said. \"We broke off our engagement, and he moved to England, then we got back together, and it's actually better than it was before.\"\n\nCox added: \"I think the distance after that breakup — we were apart for six months — that really showed us a lot. It's just better.\"\n\nMarch 2020: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid live on different continents\n\nWhen the COVID-19 lockdowns began in early 2020, Cox and McDaid found themselves thousands of miles apart after McDaid got stuck abroad. Cox opened up about their temporary long-distance relationship on The Ellen Degeneres Show in May 2020.\n\n\"He was supposed to go to Switzerland to write and instead had to go to England,\" Cox said. \"Then all of a sudden, this all happened and they called a quarantine.\"\n\nShe added that this was the longest the couple had spent apart, but they were spending \"a lot of time on FaceTime.\"\n\n\"I have not seen him in so long,\" she said. \"But now it's like, oh my God, I just miss his physical touch, just all of it.
