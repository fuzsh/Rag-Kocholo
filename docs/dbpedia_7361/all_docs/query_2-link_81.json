        "text": "Morning everyone! On this fine Wednesday, I'm sitting here wondering whether we think the lovely Courteney Cox looks chic in this asymmetrical chignon or whether we feel she should leave this particular chignon style to 100-year-old ladies named Mildred.\n\nHere's the hairstyle in question, which she wore to an awards event last night.\n\nIt's fine from the front, yet from the side, something about it says old-lady to me. But here's the thing: My best friend Kim (who you may know from Save the Date) wore a very similar asymmetrical chignon for her wedding, and yet the old-lady thought never, ever crossed my mind in that scenario.\n\nSo maybe the thing that's tripping me up about Courteney's chignon is how it looks in combination with the round neckline of her plain black dress. Perhaps hairstyles like this need to be left for more formal occasions where one is wearing a more shoulder-baring gown. Or maybe I am wrong and Courteney's hair looks perfect for the occasion and I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is Courteney's sweeping side chignon working here?
