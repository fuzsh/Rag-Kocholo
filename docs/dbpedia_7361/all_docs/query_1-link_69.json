        "text": "He’s still there for her.\n\nCourteney Cox got sentimental about her late “Friends” co-star, Matthew Perry, while commemorating the 20th anniversary of the hit sitcom’s series finale.\n\n“I’m so thankful I got to work so closely with him for so many years. He visits me a lot, if we believe in that,” the actress, 59, said in an interview with “CBS Sunday Morning” published Sunday.\n\nCox, who starred as Monica Gellar alongside Perry’s Chandler Bing for 10 seasons, further elaborated when asked about her spirituality.\n\n“I talk to my mom, my dad, Matthew. I feel like there are a lot of people that, I think, guide us,” she explained.\n\n“I do sense — I sense Matthew’s around for sure.”\n\nPerry was pronounced dead on Oct. 28, 2023, at age 54 after being found unresponsive in a hot tub at his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif.\n\nIn December, the LA County Medical Examiner’s Office determined the actor died of “acute effects of ketamine.” The manner of death was accidental.\n\nThe autopsy also listed drowning, coronary artery disease and the opioid buprenorphine as contributors to his death.\n\nDays after his tragic passing, the “Friends” cast — including Cox, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow — shared a statement expressing their grief over the news.\n\n“We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just castmates. We are a family,” they wrote.\n\n“In time we will say more, as and when we are able,” they added. “For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”\n\nCox later paid tribute to Perry on Instagram in November when she posted a clip from one of their many scenes together on “Friends.”\n\n“I am so grateful for every moment I had with you Matty and I miss you every day,” the actress wrote. “When you work with someone as closely as I did with Matthew, there are thousands of moments I wish I could share.”\n\nShe added, “In this scene, before we started rolling, he whispered a funny line for me to say. He often did things like that. He was funny and he was kind.”"
