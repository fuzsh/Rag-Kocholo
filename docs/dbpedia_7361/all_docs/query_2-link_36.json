        "text": "[on producing her series Mix It Up (2003)] I want people to be happy, so I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do the show in the first place... just to see somebody, even if it's just for the day. To see their life change for that moment when they walk into the room and are that happy. It really makes you cry. It does. I hope I don't lose this feeling.\n\n[on playing Monica and Chandler on Friends (1994)] It's so much fun for us. I have a new love for the show since I've gotten into this relationship. Honestly, I was a little bored the first four years. I had some fun things to do and some good relationships, but Monica was developing and I felt like there was a lot of straight man stuff. Now we have something really fun to play - two really neurotic people trying to have a relationship. They're both afraid to commit, to get married, or take these steps. I have a really good time playing with him [Matthew Perry]. It's kind of like our relationship in real life - except we don't kiss.\n\nI can definitely act even if I don't appear to have any particular style. I know I'm not a method actress, but I do believe in being physically and emotionally prepared for the role. If I have a scene where I'm supposed to be emotionally drawn out, then I'll think of the saddest thing in my life. If I have to be five pounds lighter to be the right physical type, I'll run my little tail around the block to make the weight.\n\n[on how did trying to keep up with your appearance got her in trouble]Well, what would end up happening is that you go to a doctor who would say, you look great, but what would help is a little injection here or filler there. So you walk out and you don't look so bad and you think, no one noticed it's good. Then somebody tells you about another doctor. This person's amazing. They do this person who looks so natural. You meet them and they say, you should just do this. The next thing you know, you're layered and layered and layered. You have no idea because it's gradual until you go, oh sh*t, this doesn't look right. And it's worse in pictures than in real life. I have one friend who was like whoa, no more! I thought, I haven't done anything in six months.\n\n[on her daughter Coco wearing makeup]Coco loves makeup and she expresses herself through it. One of her favorite shows is RuPaul's Drag Race. She thinks it's beautiful artistry and she's really good at it. Luckily at school she can only wear mascara, but on the weekends you would think she's going out to a rager at 2 a.m. eyeliner, mascara, highlighter on her cheeks. I don't like seeing highlighter during the day. Well, to be honest, I don't even know how to use it. It makes sense if you're going out, but she begs to differ. I know some people think I should rein her in with the makeup, but it's a form of self-expression. As long as she's not sexualizing herself, it's really just what makes her feel good. Sometimes I do wish her shorts were longer. I'm not going to lie. But I want to keep an open relationship with her. I care more about what she's watching than what she's putting on her face.\n\n[on her diet]I'm a really good eater. About four years ago I found out I have something called a MTHFR gene mutation, which dictates how my body methyl ate's. I suffered miscarriages, my dad died of a really rare cancer, and depression runs in my family, which made my doctor think I should get this gene checked out. I discovered that I have the worst version of this mutation and my body doesn't methyl ate the way it's supposed to. Once I found out how I could absorb nutrients and protect myself from toxins, my whole life shifted\n\n[on her morning beauty routine] I start with the Clarisonic to wash my face and then I apply a hot towel. I don't know if that's good for my skin, but it's what the professionals do. I see Mila Moursi once a week for a facial and I've been using her products for years. I love the way they smell. They're rich and rejuvenating. They blend natural extracts, oils and peptides with the best scientific ingredients. I want natural, but not too natural. I want it to work. I don't want to just use plants and water. I always put on a peptide of some sort of Mila's Rejuvenating Serum or a lifting serum. Sometimes a vitamin C product. I also use her Firming Cream, Oxy Cellular and AntiWrinkle Cream. I alternate those, or sometimes use all of them, depending on how dry I am."
