        "text": "Courtney Cox, a digital cartographer and geospatial data analyst from Kentucky, is expected to graduate from the University of Kentucky this spring with a master’s degree in digital mapping. While working a temporary odd job in 2021, she enrolled in her first mapping course on a whim. Since then, she has completed a data fellowship with McClatchy’s Washington bureau and has been working as a disability writer for her state’s Human Development Institute. Outside of work and school, her favorite hobbies as of late include learning American Sign Language and training her puppy, Bowser."
