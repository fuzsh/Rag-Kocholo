        "text": "Courteney Cox was just as stunned to learn that the Duke of Sussex did mushrooms at her house as the rest of us.\n\nOn Monday, the Friends star received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame where she was joined by two of her co-stars, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow. To commemorate such a momentous professional achievement, the actor was interviewed by Variety about what it took to get to this moment, as well as how Prince Harry ended up doing psychedelics on her property a few years ago. In regards to this celebratory occasion, Cox confessed that she was a little nervous as “Speaking in public is the hardest thing for me. It’s why a lot of times I don’t present things because it’s like almost not worth it in my heart rate!” But she got through the day with a little help from Aniston and Kudrow who aren't just her on-screen pals, but her real, lifelong friends. “Friends taught me the importance of camaraderie and really sticking together. These friendships were at the most important time in my life, and we went through so many things together,” she explained. “And it just taught me about being there for each other—I know, that’s the song: ‘I’ll be there for you.’ But it’s true.”\n\nAnd when it comes to a certain royal house guest, Cox confirmed with a laugh, “He did stay here for a couple of days—probably two or three. He’s a really nice person.” She said that she also recently saw him at a birthday party and wanted to say hi, but decided not to as the royal was busy talking to other people. “I haven’t read the book. I do want to hear it, because I’ve heard it’s really entertaining,\" she said when asked directly about Harry's mushroom revelation. “But yes, it’s gotten back to me about it. I’m not saying there were mushrooms! I definitely wasn’t passing them out.”\n\nIn his memoir Spare, the prince writes that he was hanging out with some friends who knew Cox in Los Angeles in January 2016 when they suggested they move their party to her house. “As a Friends fanatic, the idea of crashing at Monica’s house was highly appealing,” he wrote. Harry then recalled that Cox invited more people over, including an unnamed individual who Harry identified as an actor from the “Batman Lego movie.” The royal explained that after asking the actor to say something as Batman, he obliged “in perfect gravelly Batmanese sa[ying]: ‘Hello, Harry,’” The actor then led him and his friend to Cox’s fridge to get a soft drink where they spotted “black diamond mushroom chocolates.” He continued, “Someone behind me said they were for everybody. ‘Help yourself, boys.’” The man declined the offer, but Harry ate some and then proceeded to start hallucinating in Cox’s bathroom where he thought that her silver trash can was talking to him."
