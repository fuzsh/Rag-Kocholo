        "text": "Courteney Cox channeled her ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù character, Monica Geller, as she got on her hands and knees to clean her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn the clip posted to social media on Wednesday, the actress can be seen running out onto Hollywood Boulevard after multiple people have stepped on her star to clean it.\n\nHowever, she also made several pitstops to clean her best friends Laura Dern and Jennifer Aniston‚Äôs stars, as well as her ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù co-star Reese Witherspoon‚Äôs.\n\n‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs gotta do it,‚Äù the ‚ÄúScream‚Äù actress captioned the funny clip, which was set to Dolly Parton‚Äôs famous ‚Äú9 To 5‚Äù song.\n\nAlthough her video reminded everyone of her ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù character, Cox was actually promoting her new cleaning brand, Homecourt, using the products to clean the Walk of Fame.\n\nFollowing the actress‚Äô funny antics, Witherspoon showed her appreciation that someone was looking after her star.\n\n‚ÄúThanks for keeping us clean, Court!! ü§©,‚Äù she commented on the video.\n\nFellow ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù alum Lisa Kudrow also commented on Cox‚Äôs video writing, ‚Äúonly the best thing ever.‚Äù\n\nDern ‚Äî who recently got a matching tattoo with Cox ‚Äî wrote on her own Instagram Story, ‚Äúthank you, Court, for cleaning us all up good! I‚Äôve been thinking about doing this for a while, but I needed the Homecourt surface cleaner to get these shining bright. üòÇ‚Äù\n\nJust one month ago, Cox was honored with her own Walk of Fame star.\n\nDespite Aniston and Kudrow showing up for their long-time best friend, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer were noticeably absent from the ceremony.\n\nHowever, the ‚ÄúRomy and Michelle‚Äù actress made sure Cox felt the love as she said during her speech, ‚ÄúCourteney, we just want to say that we are deeply, deeply proud to know you. You are the definition of a truly beautiful, talented, and, what‚Äôs most important, a truly good and decent human being ‚Ä¶ Thank you for enriching our lives personally.‚Äù\n\nAniston, who was visibly emotional, added, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of the funniest human beings on the planet Earth. Nothing makes me happier than a Courteney joke and always making us smile. And thank you for enriching our lives with your work. We are so proud of you.‚Äù"
