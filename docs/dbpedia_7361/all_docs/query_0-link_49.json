        "text": "Last summer, Courteney Cox’s home-care brand, Homecourt, sold out of its Mandarin Basile scent in just one month. It’s no wonder people snapped it up: The citrus-inspired fragrance—which initially launched in the hand wash, dish soap, candle, and surface cleaner—was concocted to “recall a crisp morning walk through an herb garden.” Who wouldn’t want to feel surrounded by that 24-7?\n\nThe speed in which the limited-edition scent flew off the virtual shelves is not lost on Cox. She’s giving us something extra-special to look forward to this spring by reintroducing Mandarin Basile—and its comforting notes of mandarin peel, Nigerian ginger, Egyptian basil, and fig leaves—to the Homecourt line. Right now, the popular aroma is available for preorder, but don’t fear a long lead time: The products are expected to begin shipping in early April (and if you bundle them with in-stock items in your cart now, they could arrive at your door even earlier than that).\n\nMandarin Basile Collection\n\nLike the rest of the Homecourt line, the hand wash, dish soap, and surface cleaner come in post-consumer recycled bottles with a reusable pump. The candle is hand-poured into a kiln-fired ceramic vessel and delivers 60 hours of burn time.\n\nIf you want to take the refreshing feeling a step further, let the combination of mandarin and basil inspire your next party. Last summer, Cox hosted a cocktail-making contest around the beloved combo.\n\nShop the Collection"
