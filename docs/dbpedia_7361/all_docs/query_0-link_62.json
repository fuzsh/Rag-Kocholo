        "text": "The bold and beautiful Courteney Cox has certainly left her mark on Hollywood. Whether it’s hitting the concert stage with Bruce Springsteen in the music video for “Dancing in the Dark,” getting all romantical with Michael J. Fox on Family Ties, being terrified (repeatedly) in the Scream franchise or playing iconic Monica Geller for a decade on Friends, a wide variety of Courtney Cox movies and TV shows have proven that the actress can do it all.\n\nAnd we’ve gathered the evidence in the form of 10 of the best of those Courteney Cox movies and TV shows, presented below for your pleasure. Keep reading to see where your favorites ranked.\n\n10. Barnyard (2006)\n\nCox voices Daisy the Cow in this family-friendly film. It follows Otis the Cow (Kevin James), who loves to sing and dance all around the farm when the farmer is gone. Soon, though, Otis realizes freedom isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and someone has to step up and run things. As it turns out, he might be the only cow qualified to do it.\n\nYou can watch this film on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n9. Scream 2 (1997): Courteney Cox Movies and TV Shows\n\nGhostface is back for the second time in this thriller. After two people are killed in a movie theater, Gale Weathers (Cox), Sydney (Neve Campbell), Deputy Dewey (David Arquette), and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must reunite to try to catch the copycat killer. The film is set two years after the first Scream film and also stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Timothy Olyphant.\n\nYou can watch this film on MAX.\n\n8. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)\n\nCourteney Cox teams up with Jim Carrey in the first-ever Ace Ventura Film. After the Miami Dolphins’ mascot goes missing, pet detective Ace Ventura (Carrey) jets off to crack the case. Realizing he can’t do it alone., he seeks the help of Dolphins representative Melissa Robinson (Cox), especially when the team’s players also start to disappear.\n\nWhen asked about working on the film and with Carrey, Cox said: “I remember when we first rehearsed, he was just playing it straighter. And then he turned it on when we started filming, and I thought, ‘Oh my God, he’s the funniest person.'”\n\nYou can watch this film on SlingTV.\n\n7. Scream VI (2023): Courteney Cox Movies and TV Shows\n\nScream VI marked Cox’s return to the franchise for the first time since 2011. This is Ghostface’s sixth appearance, and it follows four people trying to escape his brutal rampage. Cox worked with Jenna Ortega, Melissa Barrera, and Hayden Panettiere on this one.\n\nYou can watch this film on MAX.\n\n6. Family Ties (1987-1989)\n\nIn one of her first major roles, Cox played Lauren Miller, Alex P. Keaton’s (Michael J. Fox) girlfriend, in 19 episodes of Family Ties.\n\n“I was so nervous. It’s so hard to go into a hit show,” Cox told Variety in 2023. “I wasn’t a guest star; I was a recurring character, but every time I went, it felt like I was starting from scratch!”\n\n“Being on a show and watching Michael J. Fox was the greatest lesson in acting and comedy that I’ve ever seen. He was able to take one line, break it up into three different parts, and get three huge laughs. He’s just a master. It was a great experience — it was nerve-wracking!”\n\nYou can watch this TV show on PlutoTV.\n\n5. Shining Vale (2022-2023): Courteney Cox Movies and TV Shows\n\nThe actress’ most recent project is the thrilling mini-series, Shining Vale. After writer Patricia “Pat” Phelps (Cox) is caught cheating on her husband, Terry Phelps (Greg Kinnear), the two decide to move their entire family to a haunted house in the countryside. Soon after moving, though, Pat starts acting strange, and demons start haunting the family, causing everyone to start second-guessing everything they thought was true. This show is perfect for people who want Scream to be scarier.\n\nYou can watch this TV show on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n4. Scream 3 (2000)\n\nIn the third installment of the Scream franchise, Ghostface returns and begins to stab the stars of Gale Weathers (Cox) and Dwight Riley’s (Arquette) newest movie. There seems to be a pattern to these killings, though, and only `Sid’ Prescott (Neve Campbell) can solve it. First, though, she has to come out of hiding. Kelly Rutherford, Patrick Dempsey and Scott Foley also have appearances in this film.\n\nYou can watch this film on MAX.\n\n3. Cougar Town (2009-2015) Courteney Cox Movies and TV Shows\n\nBe prepared to laugh out loud while watching Cox take on the role of Jules Kiki Cobb in this TV show. Over the course of 102 episodes, Cobb works on discovering who she is, both mentally and physically, after her divorce. Cox earned a Golden Globe nomination for her work on this show, and many of her Friends co-stars guest starred throughout the serie’s run.\n\nYou can watch this TV show on Hulu.\n\n2. Scream (1996)\n\nIn the first ever Scream film, Cox plays news reporter Gale Weathers, who is in charge of covering the brutal murders of Ghostface and trying to figure out who exactly the person under the mask is. Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore, and Rose McGowan also appear.\n\nCox has spoken highly of Scream over the last couple of years, telling Variety in 2023, “You really care about the characters, because they were unique and you don’t laugh at them; you laugh with them because they’re smart. And they’re endearing.”\n\nYou can watch this film on MAX.\n\n1. Friends (1994-2004) Courteney Cox Movies and TV Shows\n\nComing in at No. 1 is none other than Cox’s most iconic and well-known role as clean freak Monica Geller on the award-winning sitcom Friends.\n\nHowever, despite people remembering Cox on Friends, she herself does not recall that much about working on it. “I don’t remember filming so many episodes,” she admitted in 2022 on Today’s Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist. “I should’ve watched all 10 seasons, because when I did the reunion and was asked questions, I was like, ‘I don’t remember being there.'”\n\nCox also admitted, “I’m kinda bummed that we didn’t spend more time taking pictures, because I don’t have a lot to look back at. I see it on TV sometimes, and I stop and go, ‘Oh my God, I don’t remember this at all.’ But it’s so funny.”\n\nYou can watch this TV show on MAX."
