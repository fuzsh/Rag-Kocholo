        "text": "All roads lead back to Ed Sheeran — and that much is true for Friends actress Courteney Cox! In celebration of her 10-year wedding anniversary, Cox posted a sweet video collage commemorating how Sheeran put her and her husband’s love story in motion.\n\n“10 years!!!” Cox captioned the post, which featured a collection of photos of her and her partner Johnny McDaid, a guitarist, pianist and background vocalist for alt-rock band Snow Patrol. Cox’s collage began with a throwback picture of her and Sheeran with the caption “10 years ago, this guy introduced me to…” A similar throwback picture of Sheeran and McDaid followed with the phrase-finishing caption “this guy.”\n\nThe Cougar Town actress wrapped up her post with a video of her, McDaid and Sheeran hanging out, with the singer spoofing his own song “Shape of You,” crooning, “Although your heart is fallin’ too / Johnny’s in love with your body / And last night you were in his room / And now his bed sheets smell like you / Every day, discoverin’ somethin’ brand new / Johnny’s beard is the shape of you.” An embarrassed Cox and McDaid giggled as Sheeran completed his hilarious a cappella reimagining of his Grammy-winning Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single. An instrumental version of the hit song played during the first part of the collage.\n\nSheeran introduced McDaid and Cox at a party back in 2013, and the couple began dating shortly thereafter, following the finalization of Cox’s divorce from Scream actor David Arquette in May 2013. By June 2014, Cox and McDaid announced their engagement, but ultimately called it off, as she revealed in 2019. Sheeran and McDaid have been musical collaborators since 2013, resulting in hits like “Bad Habits,” “The Joker and the Queen,” and “Photograph.”\n\nSheeran is gearing up for the release of Autumn Variations, his seventh studio album. The record will serve as the follow-up to – (Subtract), which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 back in May and spawned the Hot 100 top 20 single “Eyes Closed” (No. 19). Snow Patrol has earned four Hot 100 entries, including 2006’s “Chasing Cars” (No. 5). The band has also earned two top 10 titles on the Billboard 200 from seven career entries.\n\nCheck out Courteney Cox’s sweet anniversary post here:"
