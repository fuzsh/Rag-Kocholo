        "text": "What was your favorite part of the process in creating this line?\n\nI honestly love every part. From designing the bottles, the shape, the color, the font, to being involved in every process of the scents and coming up with what’s next for Homecourt.\n\nWhat are your top two favorite scents from the Homecourt line and why?\n\nThis is a hard one, I love them all! But I guess I would say CECE is my favorite because it’s my signature scent inspired by a mixture of perfumes I wear every day. I also really love the depth and layers that Ciprus Mint has.\n\nTell us a little bit about what inspired the design of the bottles and packaging?\n\nIt was really important for me to create something that was aesthetically beautiful and that I would be proud to leave out on my counter. I also want them to be effective, environmentally safe, and have luxurious scents that I constantly want to be surrounded by.\n\nWe heard architecture and home design has always been a passion of yours, can you tell us more about your background?\n\nYes, I’ve loved design for as long as I can remember, even as a kid. Before acting, I thought I was going to be an architect.\n\nWhat do you love most about your home?\n\nI love the setting being on the ocean and I love how it has a very indoor outdoor feel, yet feels inviting and warm.\n\nWhat are some tips for freshening up your home in the new year?\n\nMy motto is always A+ or out. If you don’t need it, let it go! I feel calmer without clutter."
