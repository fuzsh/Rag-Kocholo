Courteney Cox just shared how she channels her inner Monica Geller to this day.

In an Instagram video, she shared snippets of her ultra-organized kitchen.

Friends fans loved the connection, and jumped in by sharing their own Monica-isms.

Rachel Green may have believed she was Monica Geller’s best friend, but the truth is, no one stood between the New York City chef and her label maker. The beloved Friends star played by Courteney Cox was an organizing fiend—whether she was categorizing family photos (“We got holidays, birthdays, candids!”), separating her “everyday use” towels from the “fancy” ones, or numbering her coffee mugs, she couldn’t get enough. And as it turns out, Cox can’t either—she showed off her house’s most Monica-esque arrangements in a recent Instagram.

“Tell me you’re a Monica without telling me you’re a Monica,” she said to the camera, referencing an ongoing viral TikTok trend. “I’ll go first.”

The actress, 56, proceeded to reveal a sparkling organized silverware drawer, a cabinet of uniform, labeled spices, and a pantry full of dry goods decanted in jars and organized by function. “I know,” she nodded, confirming her hyper-attention to detail.

For Friends fans, any new show-related content is good content—so naturally, they absolutely loved the video. In less than 24 hours, it got over a million likes.

“She was born for that role,” one person commented. “I had an orgasm when that drawer opened 🤤,” Modern Family star Sarah Hyland wrote. A few others chimed in with some relevant Monica quotes like, “Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, If I’m harsh with you, it’s only because you’re doing it wrong.”

After seeing the arranged-to-perfection kitchen, plenty of people jumped on the trend to reveal their own Monica-isms, including the very popular Clea Shearer of The Home Edit, an organization company that has transformed spaces for all kinds of celebrities including Reese Witherspoon, Retta, and Khloé Kardashian.

“Monica Geller forever. Am I doing it right @courteneycoxofficial?” Shearer captioned her video. She went on to display the rainbow-esque color-coordinated nooks and crannies of her own house, including a skincare cabinet, a drawer of teas and supplements, and her pantry.

Now, the one thing Instagram is dying to know is—where are the secret junk closets? If Monica had one, they must, too.
