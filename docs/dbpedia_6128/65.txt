Hairspray (2007) - Movies in the Parking Lot

Saturday, Sept. 12

Movie Starts at 8:30 PM

Join us for an outdoor showing and sing-a-long of Hairspray in our parking lot! Park at the Medical Center and bring your lawn chairs with you. Tickets are available in sections that seat up to 2 guests, up to 4 guests, and up to 6 guests. Each section is surrounded on each side by a distance of at least 6 feet before the next section begins. No one outside of your group will be allowed to buy tickets in your section.

We will have our regular bar/concessions items as well as popcorn available at an outdoor bar. One person of each gender will be allowed in the building to use the restroom at a time (with the exception of parents with children). In compliance with Judge Becerra's Executive Order, we will require masks to enter the building for those over 10 years old. Masks are encouraged, but not required while watching the movie.

"From Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, executive producers of the OscarÂ®-winning Chicago, comes a new film version of the Tony Award-winning Broadway smash, based on John Waters' original cult classic 1988 musical-comedy film. Set in Waters' beloved native Baltimore during the 1960s TV dance-show craze, Hairspray tells the story of zaftig high school "hairhopper" Tracy Turnblad as she graduates from outsider to celebrity trendsetter. With the help of co-stars John Travolta, Queen Latifah, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer and more, she stars on "The Corny Collins Show," wins the heart of resident hunk Link Larkin and kicks down the barriers to racial integration on local television--all without messing up her hair!"

We encourage you to buy your tickets ahead of time. Walk-up sales available. No outside food or drink allowed!
