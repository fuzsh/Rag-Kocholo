Set in Waters’ beloved native Baltimore during the 1960s TV dance-show craze, Hairspray tells the story of zaftig high school “hairhopper” Tracy Turnblad as she graduates from outsider to celebrity trendsetter. With the help of co-stars John Travolta, Queen Latifah, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer and more, she stars on “The Corny Collins Show,” wins the heart of resident hunk Link Larkin and kicks down the barriers to racial integration on local television – all without messing up her hair!\n\nMovie tickets: $10 (plus applicable fees). Tickets on sale to the general public Friday, April 5 (10 a.m.)."
