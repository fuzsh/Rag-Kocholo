        "text": "Itâ€™s hard to believe but the 2007 version of Hairspray turned 15 years old this year. It feels like just yesterday we were all watching Tracy and Link singing Without Love whilst Tracy was stuck in a car boot.\n\nSince the movie came out a lot has changed in the cast memberâ€™s lives. Some of them were already household names and so continued being legends, others like Zac Efron went onto have incredible acting careers, and some have completely switched lanes like Tayla Parx, who played Little Inez, who has chosen to focus on music and been behind some of the biggest songs in the last few years. And occasionally the cast have acted together again in new projects.\n\nSo what has the cast of Hairspray been up to in the last 15 years? This is where they are now:\n\nTracy Turnblad â€“ Nikki Blonsky\n\nNikki Blonsky played lead character of Hairspray, Tracy Turnblad, as her first ever role as a professional actress and she went onto win two Criticâ€™ Choice Awards for the role.\n\nSince then sheâ€™s continued acting and starred in the ABC show Huge, the movies Geography Club and The Last Movie Star. In 2020 she came out as gay on TikTok and earlier this year she introduced her partner Hailey Jo Jenson to the world on Instagram.\n\nIn 2011 she gained her cosmetology licence and has worked as a hair and makeup stylist in between auditions. Now, sheâ€™s part of the cast of kids TV show The Adventures of Farful and has over 70,000 followers on TikTok.\n\nLink Larkin â€“ Zac Efron\n\nIâ€™m sorry but I cannot get over how young Zac looked in this movie? 15 years later Zac is still acting with notable roles in 17 Again, The Greatest Showman, Baywatch and Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile amongst many others.\n\nHeâ€™s also turned into a documentary maker with his Netflix docu-series Down To Earth With Zac Efron. During the pandemic Zac moved to Byron Bay in Australia.\n\nAfter Hairspray heâ€™s had a number of relationships, including Vanessa Hudgens, Sami MirÃ³ and Vanessa Valladares, who he dated whilst he lived in Australia.\n\nAmber Von Tussle â€“ Brittany Snow\n\nBrittany Snow played the bitchy Amber who was the girlfriend of Zac Efronâ€™s character Link Larkin. Since then her career has been pretty impressive.\n\nSheâ€™s starred in all the Pitch Perfect movies, Prom Night and Someone Great. Brittany has also had appearances on the TV shows Gossip Girl, Harryâ€™s Law and Almost Family amongst many others.\n\nIn 2019 she announced her engagement to Selling The OC cast member Brett Stanaland and they married a year later, just before the pandemic. Sheâ€™s done a bunch of charity work over the years particularly within the mental health field.\n\nSeaweed J.
