        "text": "In February 1988, filmmaker John Waters introduced the world to Tracy Turnblad, the “pleasantly plump” and bighearted teenage dancer, in his cult classic Hairspray. Here are three ways to celebrate the film’s thirtieth anniversary.\n\nSing Along\n\nAlthough the hip-shaking songs originated with the 2002 musical, that doesn’t mean you can’t celebrate the 1988 film with a sing-along. On February 24 at the Historic Cocoa Village Playhouse in Cocoa, Florida, tease up a beehive and sing along with the 2007 movie remake.\n\nSee the Play\n\nEarly this year, a new production will debut abroad—warming hearts across the United Kingdom. Closer to home, the musical hits the stage at North Carolina State’s University Theatre in Raleigh (February 21–25) and the Maryland Theatre in Hagerstown (April 13–15; 20–22).\n\nGet to Know John Waters"
