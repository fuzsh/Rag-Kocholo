        "text": "Variety reports that the movie musical will first arrive in stores on Blu-ray (high definition) and standard DVD; an HD DVD will follow after the Adam Shankman-directed film completes its overseas theatrical run. The industry paper notes that HD DVDs are not region coded.\n\n\"Hairspray\" will mark the first high definition DVD to be released by New Line. Matt Lasorsa, the executive vice-president of marketing for New Line, told Variety, \"We were waiting to launch with a blockbuster, and certainly 'Hairspray' is that.\"\n\n\"Hairspray\" opened in theatres nationwide July 20. During its first weekend, the film took in $27,800,000. The nearly $30 million box-office take for \"Hairspray\" was reportedly the biggest opening for any movie musical on record. Previous record holders included 1982's \"Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" ($11 million) and 2005's \"Rent\" ($10 million). Both \"Chicago\" and \"Dreamgirls\" opened in limited release. The \"Hairspray\" film surpassed the $100 million box-office mark the weekend of Aug. 17.\n\n\"Hairspray,\" John Waters' tale of a young girl's dream to dance on television in 1960's Baltimore, came back to the big screen with the addition of Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman's Tony Award-winning score and a cast of Hollywood heavyweights.\n\nShankman directed and choreographed the film, which was adapted by Leslie Dixon from Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan's Broadway book. The musical also boasts the Broadway score by Shaiman and Wittman with additional songs created for the film. Playing the young wannabe dancing queen Tracy Turnblad is newcomer Nikki Blonsky. Her parents, Edna and Wilbur Turnblad, are played by John Travolta and Christopher Walken, respectively. Filling out the cast of the racially-changing Baltimore landscape are Queen Latifah (as Motormouth Maybelle), Zac Efron (Link Larkin), Brittany Snow (Amber von Tussel), Michelle Pfeiffer (Velma von Tussel), James Marsden (Corny Collins), Elijah Kelly ( Seaweed), Amanda Bynes (Penny Pingleton) and Allison Janney (Prudy Pingleton). (Keep an eye out for Jerry Stiller and cameos by Waters, Shaiman, Wittman, Shankman and original \"Hairspray\" film star Rikki Lake.)\n\nThe New Line Cinema film is based on the still-running musical Hairspray, which itself was based on the 1988 John Waters film of the same name. Craig Zadan and Neil Meron (\"Chicago\") produced, with exec producers Shankman, Shaiman, Wittman, Garrett Grant and Jennifer Gibgot.\n\n\"Good Morning Baltimore,\" \"The Nicest Kids in Town,\" \"It Takes Two,\" \"(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs,\" \"I Can Hear The Bells,\" \"Welcome to the 60's,\" \"Run and Tell That,\" \"Big, Blonde & Beautiful\" \"(You're) Timeless To Me,\" \"I Know Where I've Been,\" \"Without Love,\" \"(It's) Hairspray,\" and \"You Can't Stop The Beat\" from the musical are all featured in the film.\n\nNew songs include \"Ladies' Choice,\" \"The New Girl in Town\" and \"Come So Far (Got So Far To Go).\"\n\nThe movie does not include \"Mama, I'm A Big Girl Now,\" but fans of the show tune can hear it over the end credits as all three incarnations of Tracy — Nikki Blonsky (new \"Hairspray\" film), Marissa Jaret Winokur (original Broadway star) and Rikki Lake (original \"Hairspray\" film) — join together in song."
