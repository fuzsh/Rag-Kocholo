        "text": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Hairspray, Broadway’s Tony Award-winning musical comedy phenomenon, will arrive to the IU Auditorium stage on February 6 and 7 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nHairspray is the story of 16-year-old Tracy Turnblad in 1960s Baltimore as she sets out to dance her way onto TV’s most popular show. Can a girl with big dreams (and even bigger hair) change the world? Featuring the beloved score of hit songs including “Welcome to the ‘60s,” “Good Morning Baltimore,” and “You Can’t Stop the Beat,” Hairspray is “fresh, winning, and deliriously tuneful!” (The New York Times).\n\n“Making its triumph return to our stage for the first time in 16 years, Hairspray returns bringing a production of exuberant energy, infectious tunes, and a powerful message of inclusivity,” said IU Auditorium Executive Director Maria Talbert. “You won’t be able to stop the beat of this show when you experience it live here at IU Auditorium.”\n\nThis new touring production reunites Broadway’s award-winning creative team, led by director Jack O’Brien and choreographer Jerry Mitchell, to bring Hairspray to a new generation of theater audiences. Hairspray is based on the New Line Cinema film written and directed by John Waters, who served as a creative consultant on the musical comedy. It features a book by Mark O’Donnell and Thomas Meehan.Hairspray features an original score by Academy Award-nominated Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman.\n\nHairspray premiered at Seattle’s 5th Avenue Theater in June 2002. The show was a smash hit when it transferred to Broadway, winning eight 2003 Tony Awards including Best Musical, and became the longest-running musical to play the Neil Simon Theater, running 2,642 performances from July 18, 2002, until January 4, 2009. It is the 22nd longest running show in Broadway history."
