        "text": "HAIRSPRAY is easily one of my favorite musicals. It's the story of teenager Tracy Turnblad in early-'60s Baltimore, Maryland, whose ambitions to be on a TV dancing show is dwarfed by her desire for racial equality. The campy 1988 movie was director John Waters' venture into the mainstream, the 2002 Broadway musicalized the story, the 2007 movie was a splashy adaptation of that stage show, and the 2016 live TV version was an apparent mixture of both.\n\nI honestly don't know what it is about HAIRSPRAY that always brings me back to it. I think what I like about the two film versions of the story is that I can enjoy them as separate vehicles occupying two different and distinct points of interest. The original 1988 film is campy and a little goofy. The story -- while meaningful -- is a little surreal and has some actors in the mix that aren't necessarily A-list marquee names. It finds a place in my heart because of its cheesiness, whereas the splashy 2007 movie musical is just that: a splashy and heartwarming musical that hits all the right cues.\n\nIn the original, John Waters uses a lot of his usual acting troupe (i.e. Divine, Mink Stole, etc.) and he'd go on to use Ricki Lake -- the lead in the original -- in movies like CRY-BABY and SERIAL MOM. Divine, in particular, was a favorite of Waters, and left his own stamp on the HAIRSPRAY brand. All future incarnations leave the part of Tracy's heavyset mother Edna Turnblad as a drag role. On Broadway, the role was originated by Harvey Fierstein, with such talented guys as Michael McKean, George Wendt, and John Pinette appearing in other versions. I think the 2007 movie is pretty well cast (even if I might've preferred someone besides John Travolta as Edna) and it was one of my favorite movies for a couple of years. The live TV version from 2016 was very well done as well, even if I thought some of the casting choices were mainly to attract the right viewers (yeah, I'm looking at you Ariana Grande).\n\nI have all three filmed adaptations of HAIRSPRAY in my movie collection. They are hopelessly addictive.\n\nAny fans?\n\n​\n\nOne thing that always sticks out to me concerning HAIRSPRAY is the continuing decision to have the role of Enda Turnblad to be a male performer in drag. Of course, this all was originated with the original 1988 film when filmmaker John Waters cast his long-time collaborator Divine in the role of Edna. When the show was revived on Broadway in 2000, actor Harvey Fierstein originated the role. When he decided to leave the production, he tried to persuade the producers to bring in Lainie Kazan, believing her casting would give HAIRSPRAY the \"best press\" attention. The productions rebuffed the idea, however, wishing to stay in the tradition of having a male performer in drag play Edna.\n\nHarvey Fierstein as Edna Turnblad\n\nMichael McKean as Edna Turnblad\n\nBruce Vilanch as Edna Turnblad\n\nPaul C. Vogt as Edna Turnblad\n\nGeorge Wendt as Edna Turnblad\n\nAs a native Georgian, we don't always get to see these musicals on the stage. Last November, the wife and I went and saw a production of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta. It was a fabulous experience. I had never seen a live musical performed professionally.\n\nSince then, I've been trying to locate a nearby performance of HAIRSPRAY for the two of us to see. There are some coming to around Athens, Columbus, and Augusta in March, but they're all on weekdays. It's very hard for me to get off work (especially when I'm anticipating to start a new job), and I feel like I've hit a dead-end in my search.\n\nHopefully one day I'll get to see my favorite musical on the stage.​\n\nThere was some controversy -- especially among theatre geeks and fans of the Broadway show -- about John Travolta's casting. The theatre fans really wanted Harvey Fierstein, who had originated the role on the stage. Fierstein said that he believed New Line Cinema -- who produced the 2007 film -- didn't ask him because he isn't a big enough movie \"name\" to get the foreign distributors to invest money. Travolta, an established star, got the gig instead.​\n\nI've seen Harvey Fierstein playing the role on YouTube and I think it shows the difference between playing a role on stage with playing the role on film. Fierstein plays the part more like a drag queen which may be more in keeping with the original and suits a stage performance. Travolta plays the part as a woman: he's not particularly over the top or grotesque and creates a more sympathetic character which works well in the film but some of the subtlety in the portrayal would be lost on the stage. I think they got the casting correct."
