        "text": "The 2007 musical Hairspray is an outlier in director Adam Shankman’s filmography in that it’s the only film he has made that has not fucking sucked. That might sound harsh, seeing as there are a number of films on his IMDB page that I have not seen but on the basis of their reputation, and also every film Shankman has made that isn’t Hairspray, I feel confident saying 2001’s The Wedding Planner, 2002’s A Walk to Remember, 2005’s Cheaper By the Dozen 2, 2008’s Bedtime Stories, 2019’s What Men Want and last year’s Disenchanted all blow chunks."
