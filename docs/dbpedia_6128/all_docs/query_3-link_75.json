        "text": "The Broadway musical Hairspray, winner of eight 2003 Tony Awards - including Best Musical, will play its final performance on 4 Jan 2009 - the musical had been selling tickets through to 28 Jun 2009.\n\nWhen the musical closes it will have played 2,641 regular performances and 31 previews.\n\nHairspray is the 19th longest running show in Broadway history and has currently grossed over $265 million during its Broadway run.\n\nHairspray opened at the Neil Simon Theatre on 15 Aug 2002, following previews from 18 Jul 2002.\n\nIn Hairspray, Baltimore's Tracy Turnblad, a big girl with big hair and an even bigger heart, has only one passion -- to dance. She wins a spot on the local TV dance programme, 'The Corny Collins Show' and, overnight, is transformed from outsider to irrepressible teen celebrity. But can a trendsetter in dance and fashion vanquish the program's reigning princess, win the heart of heartthrob Link Larkin, and integrate a television show?\n\nHairspray's cast currently features: George Wendt (Edna Turnblad), Marissa Perry (Tracy Turnblad), Ken Marks (Wilbur Turnblad), Niki Scalera (Penny Pingleton), Constantine Rousouli (Link Larkin), Charlotte Crossley (Motormouth Maybelle), Clarke Thorell (Corny Collins), Tevin Campbell (Seaweed J. Stubbs), Kate Loprest (Amber Von Tussle), Karen Mason (Velma Von Tussle), Susan Mosher (Prudy Pingleton/Gym Teacher/Matron), Kevin Meaney (Harriman F. Spritzer, Mr. Pinky, and others) and Naturi Naughton (Inez).\n\nThe original cast featured the return to Broadway of Harvey Fierstein after an absence of over twelve years. Fierstein will reprise his Tony-winning performance as the dangerously devoted stage mother 'Edna Turnblad' beginning 11 Nov 2008.\n\nStars from the world of television, film, and music joined the Hairspray cast at various times during its run, including Ashley Parker Angel, Lance Bass, Kathy Brier, Diana DeGarmo, Haylie Duff, Jenifer Lewis, Darlene Love, Jerry Mathers, Naturi Naughton, Aubrey Oï¿½Day, Alexa Vega, Bruce Vilanch, Paul Vogt, and George Wendt.\n\nHairspray is based on the New Line Cinema film written and directed by John Waters, who serves as a creative consultant on the musical comedy. It features a book by Mark Oï¿½Donnell and Thomas Meehan, and a score by five-time Academy Award nominee Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Shaiman and Scott Wittman. Hairspray is directed by Jack Oï¿½Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell; scenic design is by David Rockwell; costume design is by William Ivey Long; lighting design is by Kenneth Posner; and sound design is by Steve C. Kennedy.\n\nHairspray is the winner of eight 2003 Tony Awards, including best musical. The musical also swept every one of the yearï¿½s best musical awards, winning, in addition to the Tony, the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, and the Drama League Award.\n\nHairspray is produced by Margo Lion; Adam Epstein; The Baruch, Viertel, Routh & Frankel Group; James D. Stern/Douglas L. Meyer; Rick Steiner/Frederic H. Mayerson; SEL & GFO; New Line Cinema, in association with Clear Channel Entertainment; A. Gordon/E. McAllister; D. Harris/M. Swinsky; J. & B. Osher.\n\nIn 2007 the screen adaptation of Hairspray was released by New Line Cinema and featured an all-star cast that included John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Zac Efron, James Marsden, Christopher Walken, Amanda Bynes, and Nikki Blonsky. The film was a summer hit, grossing over $200 million worldwide, and another $100 million in domestic DVD sales.\n\nThe success of the film and the Broadway show has prompted New Line to engage original Hairspray creator John Waters to write a treatment for a sequel to the musical film, which would include new songs by Shaiman & Wittman, and is tentatively scheduled to be released in summer 2010."
