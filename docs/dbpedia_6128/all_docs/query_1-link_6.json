It's set in 1962 Baltimore, Maryland. The film follows Tracy Turnblad, an optimistic girl who wants to be on The Corny Collins Show, and rallies against the racial segregation.\n\nPlot[]\n\nMay 3, 1962: Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a pretty, cheerful and plus-sized high school student who resides in Baltimore, Maryland steps out of her bedroom in her apartment and has to endure a full day’s worth of school so that she and her best friend, Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), can watch their favorite TV show, The Corny Collins Show, a teen dance show telecast from station WYZT.\n\nThe teenagers featured on the show attend Patterson Park High School with Tracy and Penny, among them are the arrogant, spoiled and wealthy Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) and her boyfriend, Link Larkin (Zac Efron), the lead male dancer on the show who has already been performing for three years. Amber’s mother, Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer) manages WYZT and goes out of her way to make sure Amber is featured as much as possible on the show, even if it takes going so far as threatening to presumably fire a cameraman and put him in an \"ill-fitting tux while snapping bar mitzvah photos\", as she claims Baltimore is a small market without that many TV stations.\n\nThe Corny Collins Show is sponsored by Ultra Clutch Hairspray. Harriman Spritzer is the owner and president of Ultra Clutch Hairspray and has a lot of influence on the show. He and Velma must ensure that the show will remain racially segregated, despite protests from host Corny Collins (James Marsden) who wants to integrate both black and white dancers to perform on the show.\n\nUnder said influence, The Corny Collins Show maintains an all-white performing cast with the exception of a \"Rhythm and Blues Day\", or frequently referred to as \"Negro Day\". Rhythm and Blues Day is once a month held on the last Thursday. These special episodes have an all-black performing cast, including Seaweed J. Stubbs (Elijah Kelley) and is hosted by Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) who owns a local record shop in Baltimore doing business as Motormouth Records.\n\nTracy's reclusive mother, Edna Turnblad (John Travolta) and Penny's strict, Catholic mother, Prudy Pingleton (Allison Janney) disapprove of their daughters' fascination with the program, despite the fact that Prudy watches the show herself. Tracy's father, Wilbur Turnblad (Christopher Walken), is the proprietor of the nearby local Hardy Har Hut joke shop, and is more lenient as a result, letting Tracy dance on the show and try to make a difference on the grounds that in America, she needs to think big to be big.\n\nOne day, Corny Collins announces that Council dancer Brenda is going on a nine-month leave of absence, hinting that she is pregnant and that she is going on a maternity leave, and that auditions for a replacement who is just as fun-loving, but maybe not quite as free-wheeling, will be held the next morning during school hours, with Link encouraging them to cut school tomorrow and come down to WYZT to audition for the show if they wanna be one of the \"Nicest Kids in Town\", which Edna doesn't let her do on the grounds that her diet pill is wearing off, but more importantly, she thinks dancing on the show is not Tracy's future dream, but it is taking over her mother's coin-operated laundromat business, with a tip that she could \"take right to the bank\" that if she really wants to be a famous young lady, she has to learn how to take blood out of car seating and upholstery. When Tracy attends, after Wilbur lets her go to the audition for the show amid a tearful Tracy, Velma unfairly rejects her for being \"overweight\" as well as supportive of racial integration.\n\nAfter the auditions, geology teacher Ms. Whimsey sends Tracy to detention for cutting school to go do her dance on WYZT, where she meets Seaweed and the other “Negro Day” dancers. While she and Seaweed dance, Link sees her through the detention door's window and encourages her to dance like that at a record hop in the gym that Corny Collins will be hosting, ensuring her that if she does then Corny Collins will put her on the show for sure. Tracy immediately falls in love with Link, breaking out into a romantic musical number.\n\nAt the record hop, Tracy’s amazing dance moves attract the attention of Corny Collins, who appoints her to the Council and makes her the newest Nicest Kid in Town. Tracy instantly becomes one of Corny's most popular Council Members on the show, which threatens Amber's chances of winning the show's yearly \"Miss Teenage Hairspray\" pageant as well as her relationship with Link, who ends up growing fonder and fonder of Tracy. Later that day, Corny Collins finally preaches on the idea of racial integration on the show to an angered couple of Velma and Harriman, with the former Von Tussle matriarch suggesting that she fire Corny Collins and that the show replaces him with a new, better host, claiming that they regularly replace dog performers on Lassie. Harriman blames Velma for letting Tracy dance on the show, which, to reiterate, was really Corny's responsibility, which angers Velma even more. One day, three white female dancers from the show perform a song called \"The New Girl in Town\"; being replaced by three black female dancers performing the same song the next, which just happened to be Rhythm & Blues Thursday sponsored by Napaway Stubborn Hair Kink Remover and hosted by Motormouth Maybelle, who is told by a mad Velma to watch herself before she has her fired and that Negro Day is eliminated from the show (and the station) for good, claiming WYZT's key demos are cleaning ladies and lawn jockeys.\n\nThat night, over the phone, Mr. Pinky suggests that Tracy be the plus-size spokesgirl for his Hefty Hideaway boutique for ample women. Tracy convinces Edna to accompany her to the Hefty Hideaway as her agent, and in the process, helps cure her mother's agoraphobia, meaning that the last time Edna left the apartment was eleven years ago, in 1951. However, Edna wants to reconsider Tracy's opportunity after being embarrassed as usual by Velma and her daughter Amber in a local diner they are all eating at, but Tracy won't let her rethink a thing because she believes Velma only her and Edna claiming that the only reason for that is she does not want Amber to be defeated at the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant, which is in only a few days.\n\nAt school, Tracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two are instantly smitten. One afternoon, Amber arranges for Tracy to be sent to detention by drawing an inappropriate, disruptive portrait of special ed instructor Mr. Flak with \"breasts\". But her plan somewhat fails when a lovestruck Link follows her to the detention room by saying \"kiss my ass\" to Mr. Flak, who asks him to share Patrick Henry's immortal last words to the class. Seaweed invites all the girls and Link to follow him and his attractive, talented younger sister, Little Inez to a Sock Hop/platter party at the record shop. Meanwhile, as Amber is distraught by Link going with Tracy and everyone else, she just stays in her bedroom crying. When a disgruntled Edna finds Tracy at the shop and tries to take her home, Maybelle convinces her to stay and tells her to take pride in herself. Then, Maybelle sadly informs everyone at the shop that Velma has indeed terminated Negro Day from the Corny Collins show as well as from WYZT itself. Tracy suggests that Maybelle and the others, if not immediately integrated to dance on the show racially together, stage a Demonstration (people) protest march, which they plan for the next afternoon, a day before the \"Miss Teenage Hairspray\" pageant. Realizing that he now has a chance at stardom by singing at that pageant, Link decides to miss the demonstration protest, which disappoints Tracy to the brink of tears. After the party, Edna goes to the Hardy Har Hut, Wilbur's self-owned joke shop, so that she can flirt with him. However, Velma gets there first and, while unsuccessfully, tries to seduce Wilbur. Edna arrives and accuses Wilbur of infidelity. Edna, out of hatred for Velma and crushed by seeing Wilbur with her in the shop, forbids Tracy from ever being on the show anymore for what is most likely the 401st time, or so Tracy believes. Wilbur and Edna soon reconcile as Tracy talks to him about what happened.\n\nThe next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the apartment to join the big protest march, frightening Edna, who goes to tell Wilbur about it. The protest, which has a catchy chant of \"Two, four, six, eight, TV's gonna integrate!\", comes to a halt at a police roadblock set up by Velma. The protesters are arrested, but Tracy, who hits one of the officers on the head with a sign she is holding, runs to the Pingletons' house, where Penny hides her in a well-insulated fallout shelter with food (including Prudy's canned tuna), water, a gas mask, a first aid kit and Russian language textbooks. Prudy catches Tracy in the act and calls the cops before tying Penny to her bed, grounding her in her room forever with an everyday diet of saltine crackers and Tang orange drink mix and making her listen to a religious LP every day, and finally calling Penny a \"devil child\". Seaweed and his friends, having been bailed out by Wilbur, help Tracy and Penny escape. Meanwhile, Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her after hearing on the radio on what had happened and realizes that he loves her, Edna makes Link some pork to eat to calm him down. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape from her house.\n\nWith the pageant underway, Velma places police officers around WYZT to stop Tracy. She also changes the pageant tallies so Amber is guaranteed to win. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna \"incognito\", while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio in time to participate in the Miss Teenage Hairspray dance contest. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Little Inez, who has just arrived at WYZT with Maybelle, to the stage to dance in the pageant.\n\nLittle Inez receives the most votes and wins the pageant, officially integrating The Corny Collins Show. Velma loudly declares her frustration, informing her daughter of the tally-switching scheme. Unknown to Velma, Edna and Wilbur have turned a camera on her, and Velma's outburst is broadcast on the air, causing her to be fired from the program. Meanwhile, The Corny Collins Show set explodes into a celebration as Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss.\n\nCast and Characters[]\n\nROLE PERFORMER ROLE PERFORMER Tracy Edna Turnblad Nikki Blonsky Prudy Pingleton Allison Janney Edna Turnblad John Travolta Harriman F.
