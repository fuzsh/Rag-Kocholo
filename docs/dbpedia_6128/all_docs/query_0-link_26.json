        "text": "Character Breakdown\n\n​\n\nTRACY TURNBLAD\n\nOur story's unsuspecting protagonist, she is large and in charge. Confident, talented, and incredibly determined. A romantic with a good heart and desire to cut up the dance floor. Always on top of the latest trends. Tracy Turnblad is a young lady with big hair and an even bigger personality! She is the hero of our story and she is sweet but also strong in her convictions. She is bigger in size than the other girls, but she isn't shy about it - she can still dance with the best of them! Requires an excellent singer, dancer and actor, but most importantly, a young lady who has wonderful stage presence and can easily capture the audience's hearts. Tracy will be played by a white actress.\n\nGender: Female\n\nCharacter Age: 15 to 20\n\nVocal range top: G5\n\nVocal range bottom: G3\n\n​\n\n​\n\nEDNA TURNBLAD\n\nEdna Turnblad is Tracy's big and blonde, loving mother who doesn't spend much time outside the house. She works days and nights as a laundress in her home, and her lack of social interaction has made her a bundle of nerves. She has lost her confidence and dream to be a plus-size clothing designer. Boisterous and commanding.\n\nWe prefer this role to be played by a white make actor in drag, but this could also be fantastic role for a young white lady with great acting chops who can transform into an older character. Edna should be a proficient singer and be willing to sell it with strong character choices.\n\nGender: Male/Female\n\nCharacter Age: 30 to 50\n\nVocal range top: G5\n\nVocal range bottom: F3\n\n​\n\nWILBUR TURNBLAD\n\nEdna's simpleminded and loving husband and Tracy's supportive, kind father who just wants the best for his girls. He owns a joke shop. He also loves his wife, Edna, very much. This is a good role for a new performer. The actor playing Wilbur should complement Edna. Wilbur should be played by a white actor.\n\nGender: Male\n\nCharacter Age: 55 to 65\n\nVocal range top: A5\n\nVocal range bottom: A3\n\n​\n\nPENNY PINGLETON\n\nTracy's best friend and fun, dorky sidekick. Not the brightest girl, but she has good intentions. She is a young lady caught between her mother's very strict rules and her own wants and desires to be just another teenage girl. Bursting to get free of her mother's dominating control, she falls for Seaweed with childlike curiosity. This is a good role for an actress with a sweet voice and great comedic instincts. Penny should be played by a white actress.\n\nGender: Female\n\nCharacter Age: 15 to 20\n\nVocal range top: G5\n\nVocal range bottom: A3\n\n​\n\nPRUDY PINGLETON\n\nPenny's eccentric and loving mother. Very conservative, controlling, and closed minded, she wants the best for her daughter but is extreme in her means. Prudy Pingleton is a fun role for a performer who can really jump headfirst into a character role. Prudy should be a good actress, capable of capturing the conflict of being a caring mother who can't help but be overprotective. Prudy should be played by a white actress.\n\nGender: Female\n\nCharacter Age: 40 to 50\n\nVocal range top: B4\n\nVocal range bottom: D4\n\n​\n\nLINK LARKIN\n\nLink Larkin is Baltimore's biggest heartthrob, and Tracy's dream guy. He is extremely attractive and talented. Hoping to get his big break with a recording contract, he unexpectedly falls for Tracy. Link is considered the best performer in town, so we are looking for a young man who is a triple threat - a great actor, singer and dancer. He should have a lot of charisma and a sparkle in his eye. Think of any teenage idol who is able to reduce girls to tears - there's your guy! Link should be played by a white actor.\n\nGender: Male\n\nCharacter Age: 15 to 20\n\nVocal range top: A5\n\nVocal range bottom: G3\n\n​\n\nCORNY COLLINS\n\nCorny Collins, the host of \"The Corny Collins Show,\" is a Baltimore celebrity. Foremost, Corny is a charmer, so this role will be played by an experienced singer and actor with great energy and who is unafraid of being in the center spotlight. Corny should be played by a white actor/actress, and can be made into a female character (if needed).\n\nGender: Male\n\nCharacter Age: 25 to 35\n\nVocal range top: A4\n\nVocal range bottom: D3\n\n​\n\nAMBER VONTUSSLE\n\nLink's girlfriend and Tracy's nemesis, Amber Vontussle is a prom queen nightmare! She is pretty, thin, shallow, snobby, and racist. She is definitely \"The Corny Collins Show\" favorite, but she is competitive and has a bad attitude. Can't dance but is expected to win Miss Baltimore Hairspray. Always feels the need to be the center of attention. Amber is a great performer and should be played by a white actress.\n\nGender: Female\n\nCharacter Age: 15 to 20\n\nVocal range top: F5\n\nVocal range bottom: A3\n\n​\n\nVELMA VON TUSSLE\n\nVelma Von Tussle is a carbon copy of Amber - just twenty years older and meaner! She is the director of Corny Collin's show. She is a devious taskmaster and snobby racist. The former Miss Baltimore Crabs will go to any length to ensure her daughter wins Miss Teenage Baltimore. We will cast a white actress who is unafraid of being a little bit evil and who can make bold acting choices.\n\nGender: Female\n\nCharacter Age: 45 to 55\n\nVocal range top: E5\n\nVocal range bottom: G3\n\n​\n\nSEAWEED J. STUBBS\n\nTracy's classmate and friend, who is discriminated against due to his skin color. He is cocky but surprisingly lovable.\n\nHe is the object of Penny's affections, and together, they are determined to defy the segregation laws of the 1960s. Seaweed can do it all! This is a great role for an experienced young black performer who can sing, dance and act well.\n\nGender: Male\n\nAge: 15 to 20\n\nVocal range top: D5\n\nVocal range bottom: F3\n\n​\n\nLITTLE INEZ STUBBS\n\nLittle Inez Stubbs is Seaweed's little sister and a great breakout role for a black actress. Little Inez gets her moment in the spotlight, so we need a young lady who is a great singer and dancer. Someone with a quiet exterior who can and will be bold when the opportunity comes.\n\n​\n\nMOTORMOUTH MAYBELLE\n\nSeaweed and Little Inez's mother, she also appears as the Guest DJ on the Corny Collin's Negro Day show. Big, blonde, beautiful and proud of it. She is sassy and confident.\n\nMotormouth Maybelle is a soulful part for a black performer who can play an older age. In this story, she is the face of the Civil Rights Movement and sings the beautiful anthem, \"I Know Where I've Been.\" We need a performer with a great voice and more importantly, someone who has strong stage presence.\n\nGender: Female\n\nCharacter Age: 40 to 50\n\nVocal range top: E5\n\nVocal range bottom: F3\n\n​\n\nTHE DYNAMITES\n\nThe Dynamites (Judine, Kamilah and Shayna) are a dynamic musical trio, iconic of the Motown era and the 1960s. Think the Supremes. Need three young women who are singers and dancers who complement each other. They don't need to look alike, but a group that can be synchronous in their music and dance.\n\nGender: Female\n\nVocal range top: A5\n\nVocal range bottom: E4\n\nMR PINKY\n\nMr. Pinky owns a ladies' clothing shop and is a salesperson inside and out - he is always the first to give a compliment. This is a perfect character role for a young person who may be new to the stage but has wonderful energy and acting potential.\n\nGender: Male\n\n​\n\nCOUNCIL MEMBERS\n\nBrad, Tammy, Fender, Sketch, Shelley, IQ, Brenda and Lou Ann are the famed teenage performers on \"The Corny Collins Show.\" This is a great opportunity to feature your best singers and dancers, as they'll have to emulate some of the most famous dance moves from the 1960s. Find kids with a lot of personality, and encourage them to be bold in their characterizations of each teenage performer.\n\nGender: Both​\n\n​\n\nENSEMBLE\n\nCorny Collins' Kids (Tammy, Brad, Brenda, Sketch, Shelley, Etc.); Students; Protestors\n\nOther standout ensemble roles include:Gym Teacher, Cindy Watkins, Matron, Principal, Lorraine, Gilbert, Thad, Duane, Stooie, Beatnik Chick, Male Guard, Guard, Newscaster and Council Members. These roles give more texture to the lively world of 1960s Baltimore. This is truly a story about communities intersecting, so be sure to remind all of your actors that each role matters.\n\nGender: Both"
