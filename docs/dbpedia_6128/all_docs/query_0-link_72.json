I know all the words to all the songs and have seen it on stage three times.\n\nTracey, Edna, Maybelle, Seaweed, Velma, Penny, Corny, Amber, Inez and Wilbur all sing and act their hearts out throughout and never falter. I love them all. My favourites have to be Edna, her comedy and sassiness make me smile and John Travolta is amazing as her. Her duet with Wilbur, in “Your Timeless to Me”, is just so entertaining to watch. Maybelle is just brilliant as well, Her powerful voice belts through in “I Know Where I’ve Been” and her finale performance in “You Can’t Stop the Beat” is worthy of a standing ovation.\n\nThe songs are brilliant, and I have to control my self not to sing along or dance. I can’t even pick a favourite because they are so unique and entertaining. I cannot recommend this film enough. WATCH IT. You will not regret it, and you too will see why I like it so much.\n\nCharacter Rating – 10\n\nSong Rating – 10\n\nStory Rating – 10\n\nOverall Rating – 10\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1962, Tracy Turnblad is a heavyset high school student living in Baltimore. Along with her classmate Penny Pingleton, Tracy frequently watches The Corny Collins Show, a local teen dance television show.\n\nThe teenagers featured on the show attend Tracy and Penny’s school, among them Amber von Tussle and her boyfriend Link Larkin, the lead male dancer. Amber’s mother, Velma, manages WYZT, ensuring that Amber is prominently featured. Collins and the dancers on the show are white, and Velma only allows African-American kids on the show once a month on “Negro Day”, hosted by R&B disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle.\n\nOne day, one of the dancers on the show takes a leave of absence, and auditions for a replacement are held. Tracy attends, but Velma turns her down for her overweight physique and for supporting integration. Tracy is given detention for skipping school, and discovers the “Negro Day” kids practising in the detention room. Tracy befriends Seaweed, the students’ best dancer and Motormouth Maybelle’s son, who teaches Tracy several dance moves. As Tracy leaves detention, she inadvertently bumps into Link, and dreams of a life with him. At a record hop, Tracy’s moves attract the attention of Collins, and he chooses her to join the show.\n\nTracy becomes one of Corny’s most popular performers, threatening Amber’s chances of winning the show’s yearly “Miss Teenage Hairspray” pageant and her relationship with Link, as he grows fonder of Tracy. Mr. Pinky suggests that Tracy should be the spokes girl for his Hefty Hideaway boutique. Tracy persuades her agoraphobic mother, Edna, to accompany her to the boutique as her agent.\n\nTracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two are smitten. Later, when Tracy and Link are in detention, Seaweed invites the girls and Link to follow him and his sister, Little Inez, to a party at Maybelle’s store. Edna finds Tracy there and tries taking her home, but Maybelle convinces her to stay, and tells her to take pride in herself. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has cancelled “Negro Day”, and Tracy suggests that they march for integration. Edna returns to her husband Wilbur’s shop, but Velma gets there first, and tries to seduce him. After accusing Wilbur of infidelity, Edna forbids Tracy to be on the show. She changes her mind after she and Wilbur reconcile.\n\nThe next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest, which is halted by a police roadblock. The protesters engage in a brawl, while Tracy runs to the Pingletons’ home, and hides in a fallout shelter. However, Penny’s mother, Prudence, reports Tracy to the police before tying her daughter to her bed. Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her, and realises that he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape.\n\nWith the pageant underway, Velma places police officers around WYZT to prevent Tracy from entering. She also changes the pageant tallies, so Amber is guaranteed to win. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Seaweed’s sister, Little Inez, to the stage to dance in the pageant.\n\nAmber’s attempt to re-claim her championship crown fails. Little Inez wins the pageant after a late surge of support, successfully integrating The Corny Collins Show. Velma tells Amber about her rigging scheme in front of a camera planted by Edna, resulting in her firing. The Corny Collins Show set turns into a celebration as Tracy and Link kiss.\n\nSound Track\n\n“Good Morning Baltimore” – Tracy Turnblad\n\n“The Nicest Kids in Town” – Corny Collins and Council Members\n\n“It Takes Two” – Link Larkin\n\n“(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs” – Velma Von Tussle and Council Members\n\n“I Can Hear the Bells” – Tracy Turnblad\n\n“Ladies’ Choice” – Link Larkin\n\n“The Nicest Kids in Town (Reprise)” – Corny Collins, Council Members, Penny Pingleton, Edna Turnblad, Wilbur Turnblad\n\n“The New Girl in Town” – Amber Von Tussle, Tammy, Shelley, and The Dynamites\n\n“Welcome to the 60’s” – Tracy Turnblad, Edna Turnblad, The Dynamites, and Hefty Hideaway Employees\n\n“Run and Tell That” – Seaweed, Little Inez, and Detention Kids\n\n“Big, Blonde and Beautiful” – Motormouth Maybelle\n\n“Big, Blonde and Beautiful (Reprise)” – Velma and Edna\n\n“(You’re) Timeless to Me” – Wilbur Turnblad and Edna Turnblad\n\n“I Know Where I’ve Been” – Motormouth Maybelle\n\n“Without Love” – Link Larkin, Tracy Turnblad, Seaweed, Penny Pingleton, and Detention Kids\n\n“(It’s) Hairspray” – Corny Collins and Council Members\n\n“You Can’t Stop the Beat” – Company\n\n“Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)” – Company\n\n“Mama, I’m a Big Girl Now” – Ricki Lake, Marissa Jaret Winokur, and Nikki Blonsky with Harvey Fierstein"
