She becomes an overnight celebrity, a trendsetter in dance, fun and fashion. Perhaps her new status as a teen sensation is enough to topple Corny’s reigning dance queen and bring racial integration to the show.\n\nBe the first to know as soon as we announce new screenings and special events at Nitehawk Cinema!\n\nSign Up"
