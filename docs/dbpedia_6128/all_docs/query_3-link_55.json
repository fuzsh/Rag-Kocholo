        "text": "Hairspray is a lively musical set in 1962 Baltimore, USA, at a time of racial segregation. Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a refreshing teenager whose favourite pastime is watching the Corny Collins show, a singing and dancing television program which showcases high school students. When a position on the show becomes available Tracy goes to audition but because she is rather overweight she is laughed off the set.\n\nTracy shows great courage and determination in overcoming both social and racial prejudices to gain her spot on the Corny Collins show and achieve racial integration on the program as well. She also endears herself to the audience. This is much to the horror of former favourite Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) and her mother Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer), the producer of the show. Velma does her best to get rid of Tracy but this backfires spectacularly."
