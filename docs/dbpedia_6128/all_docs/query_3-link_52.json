From Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, executive producers of the OscarÂ®-winning Chicago, comes a new film version of the TonyAward-winning Broadway smash, based on John Waters' original cult classic 1988 musical-comedy film. Set in Waters' beloved native Baltimore during the 1960s TV dance-show craze, Hairspray tells the story of zaftig high school \"hairhopper\" Tracy Turnblad as she graduates from outsider to celebrity trend setter. With the help of co-stars John Travolta, Queen Latifah, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer and more, she stars on \"The Corny Collins Show,\" wins the heart of resident hunk Link Larkin and kicks down the barriers to racial integration on local television--all without messing up her hair!",

This is easily the most entertaining major studio release of 2007.\n\nNovember 21, 2019\n\nThe songs by composer Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Whitman are big, bold and deliriously infectious, the kind of music that leaves you wanting to stand up and shout, or at least get up and dance.\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\nThis film leaps at you with such joy and vigour and generosity you cannot reject it.\n\nAugust 23, 2018\n\nIf any movie musical could threaten the standing of retro favourite Grease, it's this one.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nDirector-choreographer Adam Shankman has come up with one of the purest entertainments of the summer.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nIt pays respect to the original while also carving its own image as a truly good musical.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nMuch as Hairspray serves as a showcase for the effervescent charms of newcomer Blonsky, its greatest trick is to revitalise the careers of a few old Hollywood faithfuls.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nIn alchemy the transmuting of materials between forms distills them to their purest elements. In film, the opposite is true. The more iterations, the more muddled things get. Hairspray is good at what it does but not everything it does is good.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
