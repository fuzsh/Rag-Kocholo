Among the changes were William Riker's promotion to captain and his new command, Riker's marriage to Counselor Deanna Troi, and Dr. Beverly Crusher's new career at Starfleet Medical. But the story of what set them on a path away from the Starship Enterprise has never been told...Until now.\n\nMore than two centuries ago, the Dokaalan sent an unmanned probe into the void, bearing a distress call for anyone who could save their doomed world. But the message reached Federation space too late to save the planet or its people.\n\nOr so it was believed...\n\nGenerations later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-E are stunned to discover the last of the Dokaalan—now only a colony fighting to stay alive in a decrepit asteroid mining complex. Although their home planet was destroyed long ago, the survivors hope to someday transform a nearby planet into a new home for their people. But bitter divisions exist among the Dokaalan, sowing the seeds of sabotage and terrorism—and placing Picard and the Enterprise in the middle of an escalating crisis that can only lead to total destruction!\n\nThis book title, A Star Trek: The Next Generation: Time #3: A Time to Sow (Miniature Edition), ISBN: 9781982134976, by Dayton Ward, Kevin Dilmore, published by Gallery Books (May 18, 2019) is available in paperback.
