He has written several things with his friend Kevin Dilmore and is the writer of several Star Trek based novels, including Open Secrets, among others.\n\nHe is also the author of his own original science fiction genre novels.

If you have been looking for an interesting sci-fi story to read, then check out all the action in a book that you’ll want to read to the very last page!\n\nThe operation started out small. A small group of reservists in the Marines are totally unprepared for what they discover. In Missouri’s mysterious back woods area, they manage to run into some visitors that are out of this world. That would be because they are extraterrestrial in origin and the bad news is that they are deadly.\n\nIt’s a strange place to have a first contact type of meeting like this, but you can’t really care about the location of a first encounter when you are stone cold dead. A fatal run in turns out to have dire consequences when this meeting quickly gets out of hand, escalating into a true crisis that is happening on a global scale.\n\nHumanity starts to question what they know as they figure out that aliens have come to Earth at last. Two different species are having an alien war against the other and now have chosen to invade the world using a clever network of portals. The hidden portals are able to span dimensions and now humanity is facing down a very unique situation that they have never seen before.\n\nThe aliens are given the names of Grays and Blues to distinguish them. The conflict level between the species is at an apocalyptic level, and it already took out their home. With their previous battle ground scorched, Earth is now the place that has turned into a grand, final place for battle in the middle of a really big war where the starting point is just not that clearly understood.\n\nNow the human race has to pick a side and they quickly attempt to align with the Blues. They are going to have to try and resist the Grays and brave an onslaught that will come at them on every part of the planet. From Washington to Atlanta and all over the globe, the human race is going to have to link up and stand strong if they want to get through this and live.\n\nWhat will happen at the end of this book? Pick up a copy for yourself to find out!\n\nCounterstrike is the second novel in the World War series of fiction by Dayton Ward. When a war between aliens that takes over a far away planet comes to the planet Earth thanks to some crafty portals, the history of humanity is never going to be the same again.\n\nThat’s all well and good, but the human race also has bigger fish to fry. They’ve gotten caught up in a nasty conflict between two raging alien species that want to take the other out. They already ruined a planet, and if the citizens of Earth don’t watch out, they’re next.\n\nNow humanity has to takes sides between the Chodrecai race and the Plysserians. The battle has been going on for generations, but it just has not been able to come to any type of conclusion. No side has won and no peace treaties have been signed. So the battle goes on.\n\nIt’s been several months following some of the strongest military forces on Earth forming their own alliance with one of the alien races. Joining the Plysserians, humanity is gambling on picking between a rock and a hard place.\n\nDoing so will mean that they choose to take on what the Chodrecai have to offer. In this case this is an offensive attack that has three prongs. Those that survive go on to fight the battle on Planet Earth. With unrest rampant and martial law in place, the resistance of sympathizers with the enemy grow stronger, and two Marines are trapped on a alien planet known as Jantashreena.\n\nEngineers and scientists are doing their best (Plysserian and human) to crack open the portals. Meanwhile, Earth is getting ready for a huge battle. As Colin Laney joins the fight, can Earth be saved? Read this book to find out!"
