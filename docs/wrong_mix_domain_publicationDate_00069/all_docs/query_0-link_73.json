        "text": "There’s a new Star Trek novel coming from franchise veteran novelist Dayton Ward titled Star Trek: The Next Generation – Pliable Truths and it will bridge the gap between the shows Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.\n\nThe story is set in the year 2369, which is the same year that the story for Deep Space Nine begins when Captain Jean-Luc Picard hands control of the space station over to Commander Sisko. Here’s the description of the novel that was provided:\n\n\"A thrilling new Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine adventure from New York Times bestselling author Dayton Ward! 2369: Shortly after Starfleet thwarts a Cardassian attack on a Federation star system, the Cardassian government orders an end to its fifty-year occupation of the planet Bajor. As a result, a newly installed Bajoran government requests immediate assistance from the Federation to mediate how the withdrawal will proceed and what recompense, if any, Bajorans are owed from their brutal oppressors. Captain Jean-Luc Picard is ordered by Starfleet Command to oversee these tense negotiations on Terok Nor, the massive Cardassian space station still orbiting Bajor, even as he still deals with his own recent trauma as a prisoner held and tortured by a Cardassian interrogator.\n\n\"As these critical peace talks get underway, Ensign Ro Laren receives a call for help from a friend thought long dead, exposing an insidious secret from inside Cardassian space. Now, Picard and the crew of the Starship Enterprise must act to prevent an interstellar incident from reigniting deadly hostilities between the Federation and the Cardassians, and shattering any hope of justice for the Bajoran people…\"\n\nThat sounds like an intriguing story, one that Star Trek fans are sure to be interested in checking out. Simon and Schuster will publish Star Trek: The Next Generation – Pliable Truths through Pocket Books on May 21st 2024."
