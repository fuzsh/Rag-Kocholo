        "text": "TERRIBLE BOOK WITH FAIR NARRATION (A SUR[RISE)\n\nThis takes place in the weeks leading up to DS9 Episode 1. Not much was revealed that we didnt already know from watching the DS9 series. Why was it bad? It just went on and on with annoying dialog and absolutely no action, drama or suspense until around chapter 30. It was dry, slow, and boring. To say nothing of the fact that the dialogue just got me annoyed. How.any true \"Trecker\" could rate this babble as good is a head scratcher. Kira was not like the kira of episode 1 at all. Garick had his witty moments, Dukot was Dukot but otherwise, Keiko's dialogue was poorly written and just made me fast forward when ever she was on. Oh, and the author need to research more the get the various characters of the Enterprises ranks correct.\n\nNow the narration. Petkoff is generally a good narrator and he has Picard, Worf, Laforfge, and Crusher down pat. But his narration of characters outside of his wheelhouse was terrible, especially O'Brian, Keiko, and Kiera. He should have watched more old episodes to get it right. It was a difficult listen. If a book is really good, I will listen over and over. I listened to the \"Pray\" trilogy so many times I can recite the narration. Ditto for \"Captian to Captian\" trilogy. In the other universe, I listened to the \"Thrawn Ascendency\"trilogy probably 20 times as well as \"Thrawn\"/ This one, I sent back to the bin."
