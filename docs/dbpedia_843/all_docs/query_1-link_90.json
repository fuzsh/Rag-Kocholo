(Gulf-Times.com)  QCB Governor: No immediate need for digital currencies in Qatar – The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not anticipate any immediate requirements to introduce digital versions of physical cash, its Governor Sheikh Abdulla bin Saoud Al Thani has said. However, QCB does monitor the developments in digital currencies by central banks in various other jurisdictions and will make appropriate policy decisions based on emerging information, he added in an interview featured in KPMG’s “Qatar Banking Perspectives 2021” report. Although the idea of a central-bank issued digital currency is gaining traction, in Qatar, he said, it is not required in the near future. “Close to ninety percent of the broad money in the system is already in the digital form of deposits with commercial banks. The share of currency in circulation is expected to reduce further with the introduction of additional national digitalization initiatives,” he said. In 2018, Qatar’s central bank banned bitcoin trading in an effort to “ensure the safety of the financial and banking system”. In December last year, the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) declared that all virtual asset services are banned in the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) except for digital asset services concerning token securities. The QFC is a special jurisdiction within the country with its own legal, business, tax, and regulatory infrastructure. Sheikh Abdulla said the restrictions on cryptocurrencies in Qatar are imposed due to the inherent risks associated with them since they pose significant challenges to the stability and integrity of the financial system. “Cryptocurrencies are in general considered as speculative assets and the probability of its use for unwarranted transactions cannot be ruled out.” However, he said QCB is closely monitoring technological and regulatory cryptocurrency developments and will take appropriate decisions in due course.

(Gulf-Times.com) International  Goldman cuts forecast for US economic growth in 2021 and 2022 – Goldman Sachs cut its US economic growth target to 5.6% for 2021 and to 4% for 2022 citing an expected decline in fiscal support through the end of next year and a more delayed recovery in consumer spending than previously expected. The firm previously expected 5.7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 and 4.4% growth in 2022, according to research released on Sunday from authors including its chief economist Jan Hatzius. They pointed to a “longer lasting virus drag on virus- sensitive consumer services” as well as an expectation that semiconductor supply likely will not improve until the first half of 2022, delaying inventory restocking until next year. And on top of the near-term virus drag, they also expect spending on some services and non-durable goods to stay persistently below pre- pandemic trends especially “if a shift to remote work results in some workers spending less overall.” On a quarterly basis Goldman cut both its fourth-quarter 2021 and first-quarter 2022 GDP estimates to 4.5% from 5% and shaved its second quarter 2022 estimate to 4% from 4.5% while reducing its third quarter estimate to 3% from 3.5%. However, it increased its fourth- quarter 2022 estimate to 1.75% from 1.5%. (Reuters)  Yellen confident US Congress will pass minimum global corporate tax – Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was confident the US Congress would approve legislation to implement the global corporate minimum tax agreed by 136 countries. Yellen said the actions to bring the US into compliance with the global minimum tax would likely be included in the so- called reconciliation budget bill containing President Joe Biden's proposed spending initiatives. Asked on ABC's \"This Week\" whether she was confident the measure would get through, Yellen said: \"Yes. I am confident that what we need to do to come into compliance with the minimum tax will be included in a reconciliation package. I hope that we, that it will be passed and we will be able to reassure the world that the US will do its part.\" The parliamentary maneuver known as budget reconciliation would allow Democrats to act without Republican votes. A group of 136 countries on Friday set a minimum global tax rate of 15% for big companies and sought to make it harder for them to avoid taxation in a landmark deal that Biden said leveled the playing field. Treasury officials and tax experts have said that the global minimum tax would not require a treaty to implement and could be achieved in the reconciliation bill because it is a voluntary agreement among countries to individually impose a minimum tax on overseas earnings of corporations. The US has had such a minimum tax since the end of 2017, so it is a matter of raising the rate to conform with the agreement. Treasury officials have said they regard the global minimum tax as less controversial than a higher overall corporate tax rate or a higher capital gains tax, because it puts the United States on a more competitive footing with other countries. The US Chamber of Commerce said it will review details of the Biden administration proposals closely. (Reuters)  UK business minister defends wages stance, says BoE can handle inflation – The British government is right to focus on driving up wages, business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said, expressing confidence in the Bank of England’s ability to curb rising inflation. BoE governor Andrew Bailey has said he is concerned about inflation running above the bank’s target of 2.0%, describing the need to prevent rising prices becoming permanently embedded. During an interview with Times Radio focused on soaring energy costs and supply chain disruption caused by labor shortages, Kwarteng was asked whether the people should start preparing for an interest rate rise to tackle inflation. In its September policy statement, the BoE nudged up its forecast for inflation at the end of the year to over 4%, and the bank’s chief economist has warned the size and duration of the jump is proving greater than expected. But Kwarteng defended the Conservative government’s plans to transform Britain into a high-wage economy, as set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a speech last week. Johnson’s new economic model includes arguing that the best response to labor shortages in industries like haulage is for firms to raise wages rather than to allow higher immigration.
