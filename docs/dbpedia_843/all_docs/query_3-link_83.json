        "text": "My career started in 1999 with Ernst & Young, the largest consulting firm worldwide. I climbed gradually through professional jobs where I built solid scientific and practical foundations. During this period, I worked on multiple consulting projects for selected clients in the Middle East spanning different fields of tax, zakat, audit, organizational and business development consulting with a professional team of consultants from various backgrounds\n\nIn 2003, I decided to move to executive arena. I was offered a role in the founding team of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (the âSCTHâ), where I enjoyed the opportunity to work in the incorporation process of this quasi-government agency, headed by His Royal Highness Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz. I supported SCTH in various projects and initiatives including management of the organizational development; re-engineering of administrative and financial processes; the development projects of the SCTHâs financial resources and the operations department; and finally management of the ERP through Oracle application, which included development of procedures and change management as the first quasi-governmental organization succeeded in implementing this system in the Kingdom.\n\nAfter launching the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage, I decided to move to another challenge, joining the incorporation team of Bank Albild in 2005, where I worked as manager of financial accounting. I was an associate member in the implementation of the core banking system, reviewing and testing the financial systems and the design of the chart of accounts and financial reports. I also participated in various developmental aspects and had the privilege of working with a group of professional staff and large number of international consultants in various fields.\n\nI was obsessed with the idea and ambition to establish a professional firm that provides financial and management consulting services. The opportunity came upon agreement with a number of peer consultants, previously colleagues in Ernst & Young Global Services. We established TeamOne Consulting, one of the first firms that obtained Capital Market Authorityâs license in 2006. I worked as the founder and director of the financial consulting and business development sector in the Middle East. I contributed to the development of TeamOne business from a start-up company to a well-known business at the level of Saudi Arabia, with more than 35 consultant as well as major consulting mandates with multiple private and government agencies.\n\nIn 2009, I decided to move to executive work to refine my consulting experience in practice. I chose to work in Alargan Projects Company, a leading real estate developer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with investments exceeding SAR 3 billion. I worked with Alargan as Deputy CEO for finance and support services. I supported this company in the development of its financial operations infrastructure, management of the financing portfolio as well as supporting the business development team to conduct feasibility studies for projects and capital investment options.\n\nOne of the most important projects I worked on during my services at TeamOne was the strategic development plan of the Saudi Automotive Services Company (SASCO), a TeamOne client then. Following a change at SASCOâs board, the new management offered me a role in implementing the transformation and development plan of the company. I joined SASCO as the Deputy CEO for Finance and Support Services and a key member in the company's strategy and business development team. We worked over four years to bring about a real qualitative leap in the company's projects and services. The success is now tangible as we see SASCO with its new identity and unique methodology is leading the way in its sector.\n\nFollowing SASCOâs success story, I decided to move to a slightly different business area. I was attracted by the Board of Directors of Manafea Holding, the investment house of Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi Sons, to assume the role of Deputy CEO for strategy and risk. Manafea is an investment company with a portfolio exceeding SAR 6 billion. It operates in multiple areas, e.g. real estates, financial investment, construction, tourism and private equity. I helped the company in developing its investment and project management strategy, building a business model, developing KPIs and Balanced Scorecard, financial modeling and risk management in various applications.\n\nDuring my career, I was honored to know a distinguished entrepreneur in Saudi Arabia, HE Mr. Sultan Bin Mohammed Alhudaithi. He entrusted me to establish a Capital Market Authorityâs licensed financial company for assets and portfolio management (Mulkia Investment). I started as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in November 2012 by developing the business plan then soliciting participation of founding investors. Then proceed to the stage of raising capital and, setting up all requirements of Capital Market Authority, Ministry of Commerce and Industry for licensing and incorporation and finally forming the team and management of the company in various stages until become operational. During my time with Mulkia, I established five public and private investment funds in real estates, equities, IPOâs and private equities. Assets under management amounted to more than SAR 1 billion.\n\nAfter a challenging phase in multiple executive positions in successful businesses that contributed to refining my skills and developing my acquaintances, I decided to move again to consulting services domain by establishing Quality and Time Consulting Company (QT). I have obtained a number of licenses in the financial, management and economic advisory. Launching again, with a select group of clients, to develop creative projects and transform ideas into reality.\n\nIn October 2017, I was nominated by the shareholders in the Saudi Fisheries Company for membership in the Board of Directors, the company is a public joint stock company working in the field of fish investment and trade. It started its activities in March 1981. The company suffers from a period of more than twenty years of deterioration in profits and operational efficiency. At the beginning of May 2018, the Board of Directors decided to assign me - on a temporary basis - the position of Managing Director to plan and implement a fundamental transformation plan for the companyâs business and restructure all of its activities to correct its financial and operational conditions and return it to a leadership position in the sector.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 2019, I established SANAD Commercial Services (SANAD), an executive support office for businessmen and emerging projects that provides a consulting, executive and advanced business platform in various fields for entrepreneurs. SANAD will be a dynamic entity that specializes in generating investment ideas, offering them to investors, establishing projects and managing them in its early stages.\n\nIn January 2021, an agreement was reached with His Excellency Dr. Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Mishal, one of the entrepreneurs in the Kingdom and the founder of a number of quality real estate projects, to support him and the management team of MADR Investment Company, a joint stock company specialized in structuring and implementing real estate investment opportunities mainly with the value of an investment portfolio Exceeding three billion riyals, to plan and implement a strategic transformation of the company and its listing in the financial market.\n\nIn February 2022, I founded RSEEM Investment Company, a start-up company established to invest money, commercial relationships and talents in unconventional pioneering projects in various sectors that are compatible with the characteristics of the economic environment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in harmony with the renewable opportunities that have been generated and continue to be generated from the transformation project we are living in as a tangible reality With Saudi Vision 2030 programs and initiatives. As a founder and CEO during this phase, I supervise all foundational activities of the business, attract and empower the management team, prepare and develop action plans and strategies, lead all functions, tasks and daily activities, prepare key performance indicators including the scorecard business model balanced. Managing risks, making decisions related to capital spending, managing projects related to the financial aspect, business development and transformation, including private equity operations, arranging financing projects, mergers and acquisitions, and managing real estate investment opportunities."
