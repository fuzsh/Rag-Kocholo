        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Kuwait’s speed skating players, of different ages, have obtained a number of awards at the Malaysian skating championship organized by the Malaysian Federation for one day. Adeeb Suleiman and Omar Mohammad ranked first in the 1000-m and 333-m contests of (A and B) adult and young categories, respectively. Hussein Al-Ansari came first in the young group (A). Abdullah Al-Shatti and Abdulrahman Waleed had the first positions each in the 500-meter races of the (B and A) adult category.\n\nFahad Al-Abdullah and Bader Al-Sarraf won the first places each in the 500-m races in the (B and A) young group, respectively. Kuwait’s Ambassador to Malaysia, Rashed Al-Saleh, congratulated the Kuwaiti team on this progress, which shows the development of this sport. Head of Kuwaiti delegation Meshal Fulaitah said achieving this accomplishment was because of the preparations of players, referring to the camp held in Malaysia for this event.\n\nSpeaking to KUNA in a statement, Fulaitah said the Kuwaiti skaters made outstanding performances in the contests. He noted that the aim of partaking in this tourney is to get prepared for the Asian Winter Games due in China in February. Both the ambassador and Fulaitah took part in, along with Malaysian officials, distributing prizes. Speed skating is a type of winter sport and one of the main contests in the Winter Olympic Games. — KUNA"
