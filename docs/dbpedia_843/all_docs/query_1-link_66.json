        "text": "A STORY OF SUCCESS AND PROMISING GROWTH\n\nGulf Insurance Group K.S.C (gig) was established in 1962 as Gulf Insurance Company. Gulf Insurance is a public shareholding company listed in the Kuwait Stock Exchange. It has become a consistent market leader in Kuwait in terms of premiums written, both in life and nonlife insurance.\n\nOur innovative and comprehensive insurance solutions cover a variety of risks related to Motor, Marine & Aviation, Property & Casualty, and Life & Health Insurance both in conventional and Takaful (Islamic insurance based on Shariah principles) basis. Gulf Insurance prides itself in its distinguished quality of products and superior customer service as well as providing utmost professional and personalized attention to both individual and corporate clients.\n\nOver the years, Gulf Insurance has grown from being a leading personal and commercial insurer in Kuwait into a regional insurance solutions provider in the Middle East and North Africa. Our subsidiaries and affiliates are located in Kuwait, KSA, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Algeria, Lebanon and Turkey. The expansion and success of our group could not be solely credited to our financial capabilities and award-winning services, it is largely due to our mutual trust with our clients and relationships built on clarity and transparency. It brings me pride to say that it is this trust and respect that has kept clients with us for over 50 years.\n\nWith our growing network of over 50 branches regionally and a team of over 2000 insurance experts, the group has always been recognized for its professional excellency. In 2012, after 50 years of Gulf Insurance, a decision was made to unite our group under one name and brand. We went from Gulf Insurance Company, to Gulf Insurance Group (gig) with a clear vision “to be the most admired insurance brand in the MENA region.”\n\ngig is strongly supported and strategized by our major shareholders, KIPCO, the biggest diversified holding company in the MENA region, and Fairfax Financial Holding, a Canadian based insurance business giant.\n\nINSURER OF CHOICE\n\nBy cultivating a team of over 150 life and non-life insurance consultants trained to offer clients the most practical advice and dedicated attention and with a growing network of over 15 branches accessible throughout Kuwait, the company has been able to realize its pledge to be the \"insurer of choice\".\n\nOver the years, gig has grown from being a leading personal and commercial insurer in Kuwait into a regional insurance solutions provider in Middle East and North Africa.\n\nITS SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE\n\nBKIC: Bahrain Kuwait Insurance Company - Bahrain & Kuwait\n\nGIRI: Gulf Insurance & Reinsurance - Kuwait\n\nAMIG: Arab Misr Insurance Group - Egypt\n\nAOIC: Arab Orient Insurance Company - Jordan\n\nELTC: Egyptian Life Takaful Company - Egypt\n\nDAIC: Dar Al Salam Insurance Company -Iraq\n\nSKIC: Syrian Kuwaiti Insurance Company - Syria\n\n2A: L’algerienne des assurances - Algeria\n\nGulf Sigorta - Turkey\n\nAND ITS AFFILIATE INCLUDES\n\nAlgerian Gulf Life Insurance Co. - Algeria\n\nBuruj Cooperative Insurance - KSA\n\nAlliance Insurance - UAE\n\nAl Argan International Real Estate Company - Kuwait\n\nETPL: Egyptian Takaful Property & Liability- Egypt\n\nUnited Network - Kuwait\n\nTECHNOLOGY EDGE\n\n'gig's state-of-the art internet based information technology system links of all its operations and that of subsidiaries to a mainframe.

(MRC) on a waste management program called \"Newair\" by recycling paper and plastic bottles by promoting environmental awareness within the company as an initiative in Corporate Social Responsibility \"CSR\". gig built a recycling structure committed to Go Green and to lead the way in such concept\n\nTHE JOURNEY AHEAD\n\ngig intends to implement many ambitious and futuristic projects in order to meet the ever-changing customer needs and exceed their expectations. Its dynamic leadership continuously strives to train and support human resources in order to develop the technical and administrative capabilities within the its group of companies.
