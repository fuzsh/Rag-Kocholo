Though euro<strong>bond</strong>s could reduce borrowing costs for eurozone stragglers, like Spain and Italy, they could increase them for Germany and some others. (AP) State aid for Air Malta gets EC approval THE European Commission on Wednesday cleared Malta to support the restructuring of its struggling flag carrier Air Malta with 130 million euros ($162.12 million) in state aid. “The restructuring measures foreseen, which include a significant capacity reduction and the sale of assets, should ensure long-term viability without continued state support, whilst avoiding undue distortions of competition,” the Commission said. (REUTERS) Japan expects to import 20% of LNG from N America JAPAN expects to import 15 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from North America per <strong>year</strong> from as early as 2016 once the United States lifts restrictions on exports to the world’s biggest LNG buyer. A group of Japanese cabinet ministers on Wednesday cited the volume estimate, which amounts to about 20 percent of Japan’s annual LNG imports, in a discussion on how to drive growth of the world’s third-biggest economy after last <strong>year</strong>’s Fukushima nuclear crisis, a government official said at a news conference. (REUTERS) Nokia Vice-President for Middle East Tom Farrell, in Doha, on Wednesday. Nokia pins hope of turnaround on Windows 8 ASIF IQBAL DOHA NOKIA, which was once the world leader in both feature phones and smart phones, is pinning its hope of a turnaround in its fortune on its forthcoming Windows 8 Phone and the transition that the company has made in the last few months, a top company official has said. “As a company, we are 16 months into our transition executing our new strategy, and this requires divestment of non-core businesses, exits from some sites and job losses,” Nokia Vice- President for Middle East, Tom Farrell told <strong>Qatar</strong> <strong>Tribune</strong> in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. According to Farrell, the company will change some members of the executive team, close down research facilities and plants and lay off <strong>10</strong>,000 employees and will get more aggressive about cost-cutting measures. “We are learning that it takes time to build a strong market-leading ecosystem. As a consequence, we are prioritising /focusing all investment on Lumia, Asha and location-based services,” Farrell said. Accepting that these measures were painful, the Nokia official said that the company was helping the affected employees and their families as best as it can. “Any company in transition goes through this painful process,” Farrell said. Talking about the company’s forthcoming Windows 8 Phone, QT Exclusive Farrell said, “We are excited about the future and have a special strategic partnership with Microsoft with full commitment from both sides to make Windows 8 a market success.” He, however, did not specify the phone launch date. Though Nokia hasn’t announced when it will be launching a phone capable of running on the new system, reports suggest the company’s product line will hit the market around the time Microsoft <strong>launches</strong> the software. Asked if Nokia feels threatened by the Chinese handset makers who are also exploring ways to use the Microsoft platform, Farrell said it was encouraging that more handset makers were hitching their trailer to the Microsoft smart phone system. “This is because it could actually increase the population of Windows phones, potentially motivating application developers to be more interested in creating solutions for the underlying software,” he said. Recently Microsoft cut a deal to provide Windows Phone 8 software to Huawei Technologies Company, a Chinese handset maker that competes with Nokia, especially in the lower-end smart phone market. Commenting on <strong>Qatar</strong> and the GCC markets, Farrell said, “In general, they are priority markets for us what with the huge smart phone market, the growth in this region and the strong base of Nokia customers who remain very loyal and attached to our brand. Now we intend to give them something special as we plan for the Lumia launch with our local partner CGC in <strong>Qatar</strong>.” ZAWYA DOW JONES DUBAI THE kingdom of <strong>Bahrain</strong> has launched a <strong>$1.5</strong> <strong>billion</strong>, <strong>10</strong>-<strong>year</strong> <strong>bond</strong>, after receiving strong demand, a banker aware of the transaction said on Wednesday. The <strong>bond</strong> was priced at 437.5 basis points over midswaps, tighter than the initial guidance of around 462.5 basis points over midswaps, the banker, who declined to be identified, said. Citigroup, Gulf International Bank, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are book runners for the <strong>issue</strong>, after the banks helped arrange investor meetings for <strong>Bahrain</strong> in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East starting last week. <strong>Bahrain</strong>, which is seen to have strong political and economic backing from its oil-rich neighbour Saudi Arabia, last <strong>issue</strong>d an Islamic <strong>bond</strong>, or sukuk, in November 2011.

Demand for the latest <strong>bond</strong> offering will help ease some concerns about investor appetite for the kingdom The International Monetary Fund, in its latest Article IV report on <strong>Bahrain</strong>, said while the impact of last <strong>year</strong>’s unrest on the economy was cushioned by high oil and commodity prices, the country needs to adopt policies geared to restoring confidence in the economy. <strong>Bahrain</strong>’s real GDP grew 1.8 percent in 2011, according to the IMF. Economists expect that higher oil prices and strong government spending will push GDP growth up to 3.8 percent in 2012. <strong>Bahrain</strong>i Finance Minister Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed al Khalifa.

Shares on Wall Street were up as contracts to purchase previously-owned US homes rose 5.9 percent in May, matching the two-<strong>year</strong> high seen in May, fuelling optimism the housing market was beginning to recover. “This is all the continuation of some pretty good news in the housing sector. Housing was keeping us down; if housing starts rallying this could be very helpful to the market,” said Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Data showing better-thanexpected demand for long-lasting US manufactured goods in May also provided support, although worries about slowing global growth offset some of the positive sentiment. On commodity markets, US oil prices briefly returned to above $80 per barrel the first time in nearly a week and Brent crude in London erased early losses as a strike by Norwegian oil workers dragged on. European Union leaders remained unusually divided ahead of a summit on Thursday and Friday over how to stem the bloc’s spreading debt crisis, now in its third <strong>year</strong>. “We think there are good reasons to doubt that European bank and sovereign deleveragings will be prevented from progressing to the next stage in a disorderly way, without a Plan B in place,” Bridgewater Associates, the The MSCI world equity index rose 0.8 percent, though was still down nearly half a percent for the week so far. world’s largest hedge fund with $120 <strong>billion</strong> in assets, said in a research note. “This ‘fat tail’ event must be considered a significant possibility,” it said. Germany’s Angela Merkel has already said that total debt liability would not be shared in her lifetime, giving little support to Italian and Spanish pleas for immediate action. Rome and Madrid have seen their borrowing costs spiral to a level which for Spain at least would not be sustainable. “This is like a slow motion car accident occurring over there and the market has certainly set this into prices,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, about the EU summit. Nearly two hours after the open, Wall Street’s Dow Jones industrial average was up 65.39 points, or 0.52 percent, at 12,600.06. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 8.62 points, or 0.65 percent, at 1,328.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 18.78 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,872.84. European shares rose 1.3 percent, heading for their largest gain in just over a week. The MSCI world equity index rose 0.8 percent, though was still down nearly half a percent for the week so far. The euro fell for a third day against the dollar and was last down 0.2 percent at $1.2461, not far from a more than two-week low of $1.2440 on Reuters data on Tuesday. Growing concerns that more peripheral eurozone nations will be shut out from capital markets and expectations that fiscal austerity will drag the region into a more painful recession will see the euro stay under pressure."
