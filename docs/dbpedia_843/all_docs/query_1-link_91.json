        "text": "Dear EGBC Members,\n\nI am pleased to update you that EmiratesGBC is continuing to take significant steps to help promote sustainable development at the national level in the UAE. We recently supported and participated in the “Implementation of Green Building Standards” Conference organized by the Emirates Standardization and Metrology Authority, and I personally had the pleasure of hosting a round table discussion during the conference that included key stakeholders in the region; including Dubai Municipality, ESMA and the Gulf Standards Organisation as well as International Standard organizations, which focused on what is needed in the region to develop and improve green building standards and codes. Over the last months EmiratesGBC has hosted its own events to bring attention to green building topics in the UAE. This included the important Focus Day that addressed the challenges and opportunities in greening existing buildings, which we conducted with support of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, RSB and Etihad ESCO. This month, we will be holding the 2nd Annual EGBC Awards which is taking place at the Grosvenor House on the 11th of June. I sincerely hope to see all our members and industry leaders take part in the Awards Gala and celebrate best practice in the industry.\n\nLastly, with the start of Ramadan occurring later this month, I wish you all a Ramadan Kareem and look forward to seeing you all at our upcoming events and activities.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSaeed Al Abbar\n\nEmiratesGBC and Dubai Chamber jointly hosted a Focus Day !\n\nEmiratesGBC and Dubai Chamber of Commerce & Industry jointly hosted a successful focus day on 28th May 2014, topic for which was “Challenges & Opportunities to Green Existing Buildings”.

High level authorities from Dubai Municipality, Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Etihad ESCO and Mabanina talked about the new Green Building Standards & its application to existing building stock, DSM Strategy for building regulations & retrofits, new ESCO guidelines and case studies, respectively. Dubai Chamber having recently been awarded the LEED Platinum certificate for EBOM presented an excellent case study of their building retrofits.

The Day is an initiative by United Nations and was created to be a driver for encouraging and boosting worldwide awareness and action for the betterment of the environment. This year, the theme is Small Island Development States (SIDS), the aim for which is to encourage a greater understanding of the importance of SIDS and the urgency to help protect the islands in the face of growing risks and vulnerabilities, particularly as a result of climate change. Take the pledge and support the environment !!\n\nEGBC Board Meeting\n\nThe EmiratesGBC Board of Directors held their 2nd quarterly meeting of the year on 15 May at the EmiratesGBC Headquarter office. The meeting was chaired by EmiratesGBC Chairman Saeed Al Abbar and key points concentrated primarily on strategic discussions for taking the Council forward, such as strengthening partnerships, growing membership and industry involvement, and expanding projects and resources. The board has developed task forces that will help provide\n\ndirection for new projects under development.\n\nEGBC News and Updates\n\nHave you registered for EmiratesGBC Awards 2014?\n\nAfter a successful commencement of the 1st Annual EGBC Awards last year, the 2nd Annual Awards Gala will be held on 11 June at Grosvenor House Dubai.

Following this meeting, the Green Key certification renewals of the Sheraton Deira Hotel in Dubai and Le Meridien Al Aqah Beach Resort in Fujairah have been validated, and their efforts towards sustainable practices strongly commended.\n\nIn the coming weeks, EmiratesGBC will actively work with the Federation for Environmental Education, Green Key International and the UAE National Jury to have the baseline criteria reviewed and revised before their implementation from 2015. One of the objectives of this process is to possibly tailor these criteria to better fit the UAE context (climatic conditions, state of the UAE Hospitality Sector…) and therefore better respond to the needs of the market regarding sustainability.\n\nFor more information on the Green Key Programme, feel free to contact Lora or Marie at greenkey@emiratesgbc.org or 04-3468244.\n\nJoin us for the next Technical Workshop\n\nIn June, EmiratesGBC is working with Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council (UPC) to offer members a technical workshop in Abu Dhabi, on the topic “Passive Measures in Façade Design and Construction – Abu Dhabi example“.
