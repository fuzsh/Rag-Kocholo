Kuwait Projects Company (KIPCO) Asset Management Company (KAMCO), Burgan Bank and Kuwait Financial Center (Markaz) have announced the issuance of 26.5 million Kuwaiti dinar bonds for Al-Argan.

Furthermore, the bonds have been rated 'BBB' by the ratings agency 'Capital Intelligence'. The maturity period for these bonds is five years and is issued in two tranches; the first tranche is worth KD 23.2 million with a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent annually.
