Established in 1994, and listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange, ALARGAN has grown from a family-owned business into a mature real estate development enterprise operating in the Middle East & North Africa with developments in the State of Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, the Kingdom of Bahrain & the Kingdom of Morocco. From a contracting company, ALARGAN expanded to provide a full range of services in the industry including architectural design, construction & contracting, property management, project management, real estate sales and marketing, hospitality and healthcare management, in addition to green & energy efficient development programs. The Company prides its leadership for being the first & only company in Kuwait to have obtained the LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Platinum Certification for design & construction of its headquarters located in ARGAN Business Park. The Platinum score is the highest achievable rating in the LEED rating system, awarded by US Green Building Council (USGBC). The Company also developed the first LEED Platinum home in its Telal Al Qurm development in Oman in April 2019 under the LEED for Homes® rating system by providing solar power generation along with other sustainable design features that lower energy, water & material use. Further in June 2019, the building performance of its headquarters in ARGAN Business Park was rewarded when the company re-certified its offices under the latest LEEDv4.1: Operations & Maintenance system to achieve a Platinum rating yet again. Due to the company’s pioneering efforts of using the latest rating system & the attainment of Platinum scores, the company won the prestigious LEED Earth recognition in 2019 for being at the forefront of implementing sustainability excellence in Kuwait.
