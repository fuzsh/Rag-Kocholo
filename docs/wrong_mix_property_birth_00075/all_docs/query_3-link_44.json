        "text": "It was the late spring of 1959. The music industry’s elite converged inside the Grand Ballroom of Los Angeles’ Beverly Hilton. Others were gathering at a function held simultaneously in New York City.\n\nThat night, the Grammy Award’s first show took place, and no one knew then that it would become a historic event for African-American performers.\n\nTwo Black performers left the event that night with Grammys in hand: Ella Jane Fitzgerald (1917–1996) for Best Vocal Performance, Female, and Best Jazz Performance, Individual; and William James “Count” Basie (1904–1984), for Best Performance by a Dance Band and Best Jazz Performance, Group. Recognition for the pair was well overdue as their roads to the Grammy were storied.\n\nFitzgerald was a teen when her mother died. Her aunt then took young Ella from her home in Yonkers, N.Y., back to Newport News, Va. Shortly after, Ella’s stepfather died. These events brought on depression. Ella began failing school and frequently skipped classes. After getting into trouble with the police, she was sent to a reform school. There she endured beatings by the caretakers. The brutality forced her to escape.\n\nAt age 15, she was alone and struggling to make a life for herself. But things would change when she was in New York City about five years later.\n\nIn 1934, young Ella performed at the Apollo’s Amateur Night. The crowd booed her; shouted “What’s she going to do?” A frightened Ella decided to sing. She asked the band to play Hoagy Carmichael’s “Judy,” one of her mother’s favorites. Her voice silenced the audience, and by the song’s end they begged for an encore.\n\nTwo years later, Ella made her first recording, “Love and Kisses,” under the Decca label. The rest was music history.\n\nLater dubbed “The First Lady of Song,” Ella was the most popular female jazz singer in the United States for more than half a century. On June 15, 1996, she died in her Beverly Hills home. She’d taken home 14 Grammys throughout her career.\n\nBasie, born in Red Bank, N.J., was one of the all-time great jazz band leaders. Dubbed the “King of Swing,” his career started in clubs and speakeasies in Asbury Park and Long Branch, N.J., then New York City (1924) and later Kansas City (1927).\n\nHis music served as inspiration for artists including John Lewis, Thelonious Monk, and Oscar Peterson. Along the way, he faced discrimination but overcame barriers to become one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century.\n\n“Every day, we used to say, ‘Not one drop of my self-worth depends on your acceptance of me,’” musician and producer Quincy Jones said of the racism that he and Basie experienced back then. “It was horrible. It ain’t much better now.”\n\nBasie wrote in a letter: “I can’t remember when I did not experience discrimination … And I didn’t let it bug me.”\n\nThe Count won nine Grammy awards over the course of his career. He died on April 26, 1984, in Hollywood, Fla.\n\nIsabelle Price\n\nBy Tamara Shiloh\n\nOur accomplishments never cease to amaze me. Imagine being a scientist who can detect hidden chemicals with just a simple test. Here’s another hidden gem.\n\nDr. Betty Harris is a brilliant scientist and inventor known for her work in chemistry. She was born on July 29, 1940, in Louisiana. From a young age, Betty was fascinated by science. She loved to learn how things worked and always asked lots of questions. Her passion for science led her to become a chemist.\n\nBy 1961, aged just 19, she had graduated from Southern University in Baton Rouge with a chemistry degree.\n\nShe did her research at Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, where she worked in the areas of hazardous waste treatment and environmental remediation as well as explosives chemistry. Areas of focus included explosives detection, synthesis and characterization of insensitive high explosives and sensitivity of weathered high explosives.\n\nHer invention, a spot test for TATB, represents a significant advancement in the detection of this crucial but stable explosive compound.\n\nTATB stands for 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene. It’s a type of explosive that is very stable and safe to handle, making it important for various safety applications. TATB is used in explosives because it doesn’t explode easily under heat or shock, which means it’s safer to store and use.\n\nHarris invented a special test called a “spot test” to detect TATB. Before her invention, finding TATB in materials was difficult and time-consuming. Her spot test made it quick and easy to detect this important chemical.\n\nThe spot test developed by Harris is a simple yet powerful method that involves a few straightforward steps. A small sample of the material in question is obtained. The sample is treated with a special chemical solution formulated by Harris. If TATB is present in the sample, the solution undergoes a color change, providing a clear and immediate indication of its presence.\n\nHarris’s spot test is important for several reasons. The test helps ensure that explosives are safe to handle and store. By detecting TATB quickly, accidents can be prevented. It is easy to use and provides fast results, saving time and resources.\n\nInventions like Harris’s help science to progress by making it easier to work with important chemicals.\n\nHer contributions extend beyond her scientific achievements. She is a passionate advocate for education and has been a mentor to countless young scientists, particularly encouraging girls and African American students to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields.\n\nHer dedication to fostering the next generation of scientists has earned her numerous accolades and respect in the academic community.\n\nHarris still lives in New Mexico.\n\nOakland Post\n\nBy California Black Media\n\nLast week, Gov. Gavin Newsom, several California government officials, private sector leaders and Americans from all walks of life paid tribute to former San Francisco Giant, Major League Baseball (MLB) great, and Negro Leagues icon Willie Mays, who passed away at 93 on June 18.\n\nNicknamed “The Say Hey Kid,” Mays made history as one of the greatest baseball players in MLB. A powerful hitter and center fielder, his sportsmanship and athleticism earned him a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nMays previously played in the Negro American League for the Birmingham Black Barons. He was a pioneer and legend in baseball as one of 10 Black players in the 1950s that secured a contract with a major league team.\n\nNewsom acknowledged Mays as a baseball icon and role model who broke barriers, set world records, and inspired future generations of athletes.\n\n“I am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend, Willie Mays,” said the Governor.\n\n“His impact extends far beyond baseball. He became an integral part of San Francisco’s cultural fabric and a cherished member of our community. His legacy will forever be intertwined with the legacy of the city he loved,” he said.\n\nThroughout his career, Mays was renowned for ‘The Catch’ during the 1954 World Series after catching a fly ball over his shoulder with his back to the diamond. This play was marked as one of the greatest catches in the history of baseball.\n\nSan Francisco Giants Chair Greg Johnson called Mays a hero and praised the 24-time All-Star athlete for his contributions to the game of baseball and the fabric of America.\n\n“Today we have lost a true legend,” said Johnson. “In the pantheon of baseball greats, Willie Mays’ combination of tremendous talent, keen intellect, showmanship, and boundless joy set him apart.”\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed called Mays “the greatest player of all time.\n\n“To a native San Franciscan, some things just go without question: it’s foggy in the summer, cable cars go halfway to the stars, and Willie Mays is the best there ever was,” wrote Breed in a statement. “It was an unbelievable opportunity of a lifetime to meet someone like Willie Mays. I remember hearing about the struggles that he endured because he was Black, and what he overcame to become an icon on the field.”\n\nSen. Steve Cortese (D-San Jose) said Mays contributions to baseball and the Bay Area are “immeasurable.”\n\nWatching Willie Mays play was a privilege I will never forget. As great as he was at the sport, he was an even better man. His work through the Say Hey Foundation stands as just one example of how he made our community stronger,” said Cortese.\n\nCalifornia Assembly Speaker Robert A. Rivas (D-Hollister) also saluted Mays.\n\n“The greatest. Rest in Peace, Willie Mays,” Rivas posted on the social media platform.\n\nOakland Post"
