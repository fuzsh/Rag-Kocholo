        "text": "New Theatrical Production\n\nFeaturing The Music of Ella Fitzgerald\n\nWill Hold Work Session & Private Industry Presentation\n\nStarring Dee Dee Bridgewater\n\nand Charity Angél Dawson\n\nELLA: An American Miracle, a new musical written by Anna Deavere Smith (Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992 and Notes From The Field) and featuring music from the Ella Fitzgerald songbook, is currently in development, with an upcoming work session held from August 25-September 21 to conclude with a private industry presentation.\n\nELLA: An American Miracle is produced by Steve J. Scarduzio and John Hart.\n\nELLA features two women who portray the extraordinary Ella Fitzgerald at different points in her life. Three-time Grammy Award-winning jazz singer, Tony Award winner, and Olivier Award nominee Dee Dee Bridgewater (The Wiz, Lady Day) will return to the theater for the first time in more than 30 years to portray the ghost of Ella. Among Bridgewater’s numerous accolades, her 1997 album Dear Ella won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album. Charity Angél Dawson (Chicago, Waitress) will portray Young Ella.\n\nAnna Deavere Smith said, “Composers wanted Ella Fitzgerald to sing their songs because listening to her, they knew how their songs were supposed to be sung. A jazz singer, a scat singer, she also famously both sang and defined the American song book. To say she had humble beginnings is a profound understatement. She sang America through some of its most discordant times. She was America’s love song. She was an American miracle.”\n\nIn addition to Bridgewater and Dawson, the cast for the workshop will feature Saint Aubyn, Angela Birchett, J. Bernard Calloway, Milanis Clark, Crystal Joy, Ken Marks, Jhardon Dishon Milton, Joshua Morgan, Rance Nix, Okwui Okpokwasili, Nick Rehberger, Jessica Rush, Deandre Sevon, and Erica Sweany.\n\nELLA: An American Miracle is directed by Philip Wm. McKinley (The Boy From Oz) and choreographed by Ellenore Scott (Funny Girl, Mr. Saturday Night), with musical direction by acclaimed jazz composer, pianist, music director, vocalist, and jazz instructor Mark G. Meadows. The stage production will feature costume design by Tony Award winner Ann Hould-Ward (Into The Woods, The Color Purple). ShowTown Theatricals serves as General Manager.\n\nELLA FITZGERALD. Born in Newport News, VA on April 25th, 1917, Ella Fitzgerald was the child of William Fitzgerald and Temperance “Tempie” Henry. After her parents parted ways, Ella went with her mother to Yonkers, NY, where they eventually moved in with her mother’s longtime partner, Joseph Da Silva. Following the death of her mother and stepfather, Ella faced difficulties in her home life, and was sent away to a reform school where she faced abuse at the hands of her caretakers. In 1934, Ella received the opportunity to compete in Amateur Night at the Apollo Theatre in New York. This is where Ella Fitzgerald found her home under the spotlight. In 1935, Ella met her mentor, bandleader Chick Webb. The two would continue to work together as Ella’s career continued to propel forward. In 1939, following the death of Chick Webb, Ella assumed leadership of the band, which was renamed “Ella Fitzgerald and Her Famous Band.” Her career would go on to span over 60 years with genres ranging from bee-bop to swing to scat, an artform Fitzgerald perfected and popularized. Ella became a frequent and favorite guest on television variety shows such as “The Bing Crosby Show,” “The Dinah Shore Show,” “The Frank Sinatra Show,” “The Ed Sullivan Show,” “The Tonight Show,” “The Nat King Cole Show,” “The Andy Williams Show,” and “The Dean Martin Show.” Ella also had celebrity fans, including her relationship with Marilyn Monroe, which led to her famously performing at the Mocambo, a popular nightclub in the 1950s. In her lifetime, she recorded over 200 albums, selling over 40 million, and was awarded 13 Grammys and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, along with several prestigious awards such as the Kennedy Center Honors, National Medal of Arts, and Commander of Arts and Letters award from France. Fitzgerald was awarded Honorary doctorates from Dartmouth, Yale, and Harvard University as well as a Magnum Opus Award from the University of Southern California. Since Ella’s death in 1996, her music continues to be in demand and was downloaded 1.9 billion times in 2021.\n\nDEE DEE BRIDGEWATER. Over the course of a multifaceted career spanning four decades, Grammy and Tony Award-winning Jazz giant Dee Dee Bridgewater has ascended to the upper echelon of vocalists, putting her unique spin on standards, as well as taking intrepid leaps of faith in re-envisioning jazz classics. The three-time Grammy winner most recently won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album for “Eleanora Fagan (1915-1959): To Billie With Love From Dee Dee.” Bridgewater’s career has always bridged musical genres. She earned her first professional experience as a member of the legendary Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band, and throughout the 70s she performed with such jazz notables as Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, and Dizzy Gillespie. After a foray into the pop world during the 1980s, she relocated to Paris and began to turn her attention back to Jazz. Bridgewater began self-producing with her 1993 album “Keeping Tradition” (Polydor/Verve) and created DDB Records in 2006 when she signed with the Universal Music Group as a producer (Bridgewater produces all of her own CDs). Releasing a series of critically acclaimed CD's, all but one, including her wildly successful double Grammy Award-winning tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, “Dear Ella,” have received Grammy nominations. Bridgewater also pursued a parallel career in musical theater, winning a Tony Award for her role as Glinda in The Wiz in 1975. Having recently completed a run as the lead role of Billie Holiday in the off-Broadway production of Lady Day, her other theatrical credits include Sophisticated Ladies, Black Ballad, Carmen, Cabaret and the Off-Broadway and West End Productions of Lady Day, for which Bridgewater received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical. As a Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Bridgewater continues to appeal for international solidarity to finance global grassroots projects in the fight against world hunger. In April 2017 she was the recipient of an NEA Jazz Masters Fellows Award with honors bestowed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. In December 2017, Bridgewater was presented with the ASCAP Foundation Champions award acknowledging her charitable contributions. 2019 brought her induction in the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in recognition of her contributions to music and in celebration of her latest CD, \"Memphis, Yes...I'm Ready.\"\n\nCHARITY ANGÉL DAWSON. Born in Tulsa Oklahoma, Charity Angél Dawson found her love for music during her adolescence, when she began singing with her mother and siblings in church. It was after relocating to Detroit, where Charity attended the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, that her passion for storytelling was sparked. That passion ultimately brought her to New York where she was trained at The American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Charity currently plays Mama Morton in the hit Broadway show Chicago. Other Broadway credits include Mrs. Doutbfire (Walnda Sellner), Waitress (Becky) and made her Broadway debut in the 2014 revival of Side Show as the Fortune Teller.
