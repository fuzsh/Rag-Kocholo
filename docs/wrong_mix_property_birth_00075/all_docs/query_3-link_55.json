        "text": "The first Grammy inaugural ceremony was held on 4th May 1959; the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences was officially composed two years earlier before its existence. In fact, two ceremonies were held simultaneously; first in Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills California, and the second in the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City. The Grammy Awards are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Science. The major objective of the Academy was to keep rock ‘n’ roll at bay. The winners are honored with a miniature gramophone trophy; hence the award is been nicknamed as “The Grammy Awards”. These awards were presented to the artists for their outstanding performance in the music industry for the year 1958. From 1959 to 1993, The Best Comedy Album award was included in the list of Award category. From 1959 to 1967, it was presented as Best Comedy Performance.
