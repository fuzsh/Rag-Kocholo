        "text": "Ella Fitzgerald\n\n-“Americans in general regarded Ella with the kind of affection that the British reserve for Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The extent of this affection gradually revealed itself to me while I was in the United States researching this book, and it came, I must confess, as a surprise. It crossed over the arbitrary boundaries imposed by age and ethnicity. Ella’s popularity was such that it seemed to transcend categories. She was beyond jazz, she was beyond popular music, and paradoxically she remained limited by them, as much through received notions of one or the other as through the way she applied her great talent to both.” (Nicholson, vii)\n\n-“Here was a women whose singing had won her practically every honor she might have dreamed could come her way: countless prestigious critics’ and listeners’ polls as top jazz; Grammy Awards; a Kennedy Center Award; the National Medal of Arts presented to her by the President of the United States; honorary doctorates in music from such bastions of the establishment as Yale, Dartmouth, the University of Maryland, and more. She had been presented to heads of state and feted by the rich and famous, and had collaborated with the very best artists in jazz and popular music, from Luis Armstrong and Duke Ellington to Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole. She was, quite simple, one of the most celebrated jazz musicians of all time.” (Nicholoson, xiii)\n\n-Born April 25, 191 7 in Newport News, Virginia\n\n-Died on June 15, 1996 at age 79 due to diabetes\n\n-Childhood had a lot of trauma\n\n-Born to unwed parents William Fitzgerald and Temperance Fitzgerald\n\n-Living in a small room with her mom she had to move to her aunts after her mom died when she just 15\n\n-Was a bad student and briefly employed by the mafia\n\n-Got into music by performing when she could and eventually landed a spot with a band that would one day be named Ella and her famous orchestra\n\n-She had three marriages, one drug dealer, one famous bass player and one he went to jail for stealing money from a women he was engaged to before Ella\n\n-She has had many solo projects and collaborations, signed deals with labels like Decca label and Verve records\n\n-Many innovations: “I think she brought scat singing to a new level of artistry,” said Sonny Rollins, one of the greatest improvisers in the history of jazz. “Scat singing is an art, but the way Ella uses interpolations of different songs into different parts of the melodies is really high art. I have always loved the way she did that. It’s one thing to put a melody of one song into another for effect, so the crowd likes it, but there’s also an artistic level involved with these excursions. Ella really brought that to a high level.”\n\n-has made over 150 albums and appeared in many films\n\nBillie Holiday, jazz hometown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nApril 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959\n\nBorn as Eleanora Fagan, also known as Lady Day\n\nKnown for “Strange Fruit”, sorrowful song about lynching\n\n- Very rough childhood, Mother, Sadie Fagan, very neglectful often left daughter with relatives\n\n- Eva Miller (older married half-sister) or Eva’s mother-in-law Martha Miller\n\n- Resulted in her skipping school, sent to reform school and finally drop out of school at 11\n\n- Influenced strongly by Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith, listened to them growing up\n\n- Began singing in churched, learned the Latin Mass\n\n- Stress on pronunciation in Latin chants created foundation for articulation used in singing\n\n- By 13 her and mother moved to Harlem\n\n- Her mother and she became prostitutes, her at 14\n\n- Brothel they worked at eventually was raided and they each spent time in prison\n\nOnce released she teamed up with tenor sax player, Kenneth Hollon. She created her stage name from admired actress Billie Dove and last name of father Clarence Holiday. The dynamic duo started playing in night clubs in Brooklyn like Elks Club, Grey Dawn, etc. As their reputation started to grow, she became more popular and booked more gigs. Around this time she also reconnected with her father who was in Fletcher Henderson’s band.\n\nJohn Hammond the producer of Covan’s, saw Holiday perform at said night club, and in turn Hammond became Holiday’s unofficial publicity agent. In 1933 only at 18 Holiday teamed up with jazz musician, Benny Goodman, coordinated by Hammond. She then introduced her recording debut, in which she sang “Your Mother’s Son-In-Law” and “Riffin’ the Scotch.” Hammond signed her with Brunswick Records so she could collab with Teddy Wilson, a famous jazz pianist. While working with Wilson, Holiday produced songs various songs like, “What a Little Moonlight Can Do” and “Miss Brown to You.\" The single “I Cried for You” became extremely popular and successful, sold 15,000 copies.\n\nIn 1937, Holiday auditioned with Count Basie, a big band, in Philadelphia. They traveled to different cities, performing one night shows. Holiday was very particular about how the song sounded and how it suited her style. Due to complaints made by other band members and refusing to sing a genre not related to her style, she was fired from the band. Shortly after, she was hired by Artie Shaw who led an all-white orchestra.\n\nIn this time it was very rare for an African American to travel with an all-white band, but it still didn’t stop Holiday from recording the single “I’m Gonna Lock My Heart”, which was the 6th most played song in 1938. Though Holiday earned more press with Artie Shaw, it was for the fact she was the only African American member. Holiday was forced to follow colored laws, therefore excluding her from facilities and activities the other band members could attend. Holiday eventually left the band for constantly being discriminated against.\n\nThis was also the time when Holiday was rivaled by jazz singer, Ella Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald had surpassed Holiday in popularity by this point in time, sparking a competition between them. Holiday was known to frequently drink and smoke marijuana in the recording studio which made booking difficult. The song “Strange Fruit” was introduced to Holiday at Columbia Records. The song was about the reality of lynching. This song gained recognition ‘Strange Fruit’ and made Holiday increasingly popular. Songs like “God Bless the Child”, “Am I Blue”, and “Solitude” portrayed such raw emotion through the narrative that it became an iconic trait of Holiday’s singing.\n\nBy 1947, Holiday had established a strong career and well-known reputation. Subsequently, Holiday was arrested in 1947 for possession of illegal drugs. Holiday plead guilty was sentenced to prison, but she was released by 1948 for good behavior. Despite her judgment, Holiday agreed to perform at Carnegie Hall. The show took down the house by selling over 2,000 tickets. Holiday continued to abuse substances and alcohol, which caused her many health problems later on.\n\nIn 1956, her autobiography was published along with a long track of classics and new songs which was dubbed Lady Sings the Blues. The record included “Strange Fruit”, “God Bless the Child”, “Trav’lin’ Light”, and eight new recordings. By the late 60’s, Holiday fell ill from cirrhosis of the liver, the failing functionality of the liver due to abiding damage. In 1959 at 44, Holiday died of heart failure and pulmonary edema, buildup of fluid in lungs, caused by the cirrhosis. Many mourned the death of one of the greatest and influential artists of the 21st century, and she is still relevant today throughout music history."
