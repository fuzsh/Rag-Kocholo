        "text": "Ella Fitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Virginia, but she spent most of her childhood in Yonkers, New York. Ella experienced some difficulties during her childhood: her father left the family when she was very young, and her mother died when she was a teenager. However, like her parents, Ella loved music. She sang and took piano lessons while growing up. While in her teens, Ella’s big break came when she won a talent contest at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, a neighborhood of New York City. A band director who saw her performance there got her an audition with the famous bandleader Chick Webb, who then hired her to be a part of his ensemble.\n\nIn 1938 Fitzgerald recorded a song based on the popular “A-Tisket, A-Tasket” nursery rhyme. That recording sold more than a million copies, and Fitzgerald became famous. During the 1940s she toured the United States with a popular jazz group. Fitzgerald also performed outside the country and soon became an international star. Audiences enjoyed the singer’s rare ability to glide between low and high notes. Fitzgerald also became a master of “scat,” which is a way of using the voice like an instrument by singing meaningless syllables.\n\nIn the 1950s, Fitzgerald began recording the “songbooks,” a series of albums celebrating the works of well-known American composers. One songbook was devoted to the music of brothers Ira and George Gershwin. Her versions reportedly inspired Ira to say, “I never knew how good our songs were until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them.” She also sang the music of Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, and others.\n\nDuring her long career Fitzgerald recorded more than 100 albums of several kinds of music, including jazz, ballads, show tunes, and pop songs. She performed with such artists as jazz greats Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie as well as singers Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby. In addition to winning many Grammy awards for her recordings, Fitzgerald was honored with lifetime achievement awards by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Despite health problems, she continued to record and perform in her later years. Fitzgerald died on June 15, 1996, in Beverly Hills, California."
