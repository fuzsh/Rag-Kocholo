        "text": "Patriotic Assembly Song of the Week\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy\n\nMusician of the Week\n\nElla Fitzgerald\n\nMonday\n\nListening Example: \"St. Louis Blues\"\n\nTo support the family, Ella’s Step father, Joe, dug ditches and was a part-time chauffeur, while Tempie worked at a laundromat and did some catering. Occasionally, Ella took on small jobs to contribute money as well. Perhaps naïve to the circumstances, Ella worked as a runner for local gamblers, picking up their bets and dropping off money.\n\nToday’s listening example is “St. Louis Blues”. This song is a radio recording from the famous Savoy club in Harlem. Here, Ella is singing with Chick Webb, the man who helped make her famous, and his orchestra. Notice how some of the song sounds like it’s in gibberish, or just made up sounds. That is called “scat” singing and it is a very important part of what made Ella so special.\n\nTuesday\n\nElla considered herself more of a tomboy, and often joined in on the neighborhood games of baseball. Sports aside, she enjoyed dancing and singing with her friends, and some evenings they would take the train into Harlem and watch various acts at the Apollo Theater.\n\nIn 1932, Tempie died from serious injuries that she received in a car accident. Ella took the loss very hard. After staying with Joe for a short time, Tempie's sister, Virginia took Ella home. Shortly afterward Joe suffered a heart attack and died, and her little sister Frances joined them.\n\nToday’s listening example is Ella’s 1965 appearance on the Ed Sullivan show with Duke Ellington. The name of the song is “It Don’t Mean a Thing if it ain’t got that swing”\n\nWednesday\n\nListening Example: \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\"\n\nUnable to adjust to the new circumstances, after her mother and step father died, Ella became increasingly unhappy and entered into a difficult period of her life. Her grades dropped dramatically, and she frequently skipped school. After getting into trouble with the police, she was taken into custody and sent to a reform school. Living there was even more unbearable, as she suffered beatings at the hands of her caretakers. Eventually Ella escaped from the reformatory. The 15-year-old found herself broke and alone during the Great Depression, and strove to endure.\n\nNever one to complain, Ella later reflected on her most difficult years with an appreciation for how they helped her to mature. She used the memories from these times to help gather emotions for performances, and felt she was more grateful for her success because she knew what it was like to struggle in life\n\nThursday\n\nListening Example: \"Love and Kisses\"\n\nThat unexpected performance at the Apollo helped to set Ella’s career in motion. She soon met Chick Webb, who was a bandleader and drummer. She later joined his band as a singer, regularly performed at one of the hottest clubs in Harlem, The Savoy, and in 1935 recorded “Love and Kisses” with Webb, which is today’s listening example.\n\nFriday\n\nListening Example: \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\"\n\nElla Fitzgerald with the Chick Webb Orchestra at The Savoy Ballroom\n\nShortly afterward, Ella began singing a rendition of the song, \"(If You Can't Sing It) You Have to Swing It.\" During this time, the era of big swing bands was shifting, and the focus was turning more toward bebop. Ella played with the new style, often using her voice to take on the role of another horn in the band. \"You Have to Swing It\" was one of the first times she began experimenting with scat singing, and her improvisation and vocalization thrilled fans. Throughout her career, Ella would master scat singing, turning it into a form of art.\n\nIn 1938, at the age of 21, Ella recorded a playful version of the nursery rhyme, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket.\" The album sold 1 million copies, hit number one, and stayed on the pop charts for 17 weeks. Suddenly, Ella Fitzgerald was famous.”A Tisket, A Tasket” is today’s listening example.\n\nResearch Credits"
