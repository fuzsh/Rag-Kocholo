        "text": "Today is the First Lady of Song’s birthday. Ella Fitzgerald was born in Newport News, Virginia, on April 25, 1917. Like Frank Sinatra, who was born two years earlier and lived two years longer, Fitzgerald embodied the spirit of twentieth century American popular music. They both did this through impeccable musicianship and a dedication to diction. We always knew exactly what they were singing about, both in meaning and in spirit.\n\nFitzgerald’s first collaboration was with the Chick Webb Orchestra and her rendition of the nursery rhyme, A-Tisket, A-Tasket, shot to the top of the charts in 1938 and gave her instant national recognition."
