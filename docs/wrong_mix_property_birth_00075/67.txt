Biography

Ella Fitzgerald is Notable.

Ella Fitzgerald was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Ella Fitzgerald was a legendary jazz singer whose prolific career spanned 60 years, during which she received numerous awards, including thirteen Grammy Awards. She was recognized with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992.[1]

Ella Fitzgerald, daughter of William Fitzgerald and Temperance Williams, was born on 25 April 1917 in Warwick, Virginia, United States.[2] At the time of her birth her father worked on a grain ship in Newport News, Virginia. At age two she was living with her parents in Newport News.[3]

By the time Ella was twelve, her mother had left her father and had married a Portuguese immigrant from Cape Verde, Antonio Corri. They were living in Yonkers, Westchester County, New York and Ella had a half-sister, Frances, born in 1923.[4] After Ella's mother died in 1932, leaving her orphaned, she ended up in the New York State Training School for Girls at Hudson, N.Y., a dilapidated reformatory where she spent a year before leaving to take her chances in New York City to try to make a career in show business.[5]

Ella's career started to take off after she won an amateur singing contest at the Apollo Theater in Harlem in 1934. She was hired with Chick Webb's band, and recorded her first hit with them in 1939. In 1942, she started her solo career. She won numerous awards including thirteen Grammy Awards[6] and was recognized for lifetime achievements with the Kennedy Center Award in 1979, the National Medal of Arts in 1987[7], and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992.[8]. She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1995 [9].

Ella married Ben Kornegay in St Louis, Missouri in 1941,[10] but the marriage was annulled in 1942.[1][11] She later married Ray Brown, a famed jazz bass player with the Dizzy Gillespie band, in Youngstown, Ohio in 1947. [12][13] Ray and Ella adopted an infant son, jazz musician Raymond Brown Jr, the child of her half-sister Frances, before they divorced in 1953.[13]

Ella passed away in 1996 in Los Angeles at the age of 79.[14]. She has a crypt in the Sunset Mission Mausoleum in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Ingelwood, California.[15]

Research Notes

Many articles list her stepfather as Joseph Da Silva, and her half-sister as Frances Da Silva, however the 1925 census lists the stepfather as Anthony Corri and her half-sister as Frances Corri.
