        "text": "A qualified holistic therapist and teacher, a Usui Reiki Master, KarunaÂ® Reiki Master and EFT Practitioner, with a background in teaching and coaching, I have helped many people through times of personal challenges and change. I work with people who wish to improve their health, general wellbeing and develop their abilities in creating a healthy, empowered and positive future. I enjoy helping people re-focus, re-energise and work towards their goals in a holistic way. As a holistic therapist and teacher, I regularly teach clients and students a range of energy healing therapies and techniques including: - Reiki at First, Second and Master levels (Usui and Karuna) - Meditation - Visualisation - Relaxation - Crystal Healing - Animal Reiki at all levels - Equine Reiki at all levels - Reiki Drumming - Reiki with Angels - Reiki with Colour I have been a Reiki Master and holistic therapist for many years and I enjoy helping others to connect and explore the mind, body and spiritual being. Practising natural energy healing helps to calm the mind, relax the body and in return helps to create a life with less tension, stress and the ability to deal with the daily distractions that demand attention in a more mindful way. When carried out on a regular basis, even for just a few minutes, natural healing techniques can have a positive impact on health and wellbeing. I enjoy sharing my knowledge through writing books on a variety of related subjects as well as creating MP3s for download. In love, light, peace and harmony.\n\nRead full bio"
