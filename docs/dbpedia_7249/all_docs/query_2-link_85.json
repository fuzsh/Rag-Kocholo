        "text": "Singer, actor, dancer. “Former child star.” Mother. The Voice winner. All of these titles apply to Alisan Porter, a versatile entertainer with a career in the spotlight that goes back to when she was a 3-year-old dazzling audiences on Star Search.\n\nThese days, Porter is busy juggling her schedule at home with her kids and splitting time on other projects with her husband — professional dancer Justin de Vera — while he spends time on the road backing major music stars, as he is right now with Peso Pluma.\n\nPorter also recently continued her music career, having just released a new EP of songs titled The Ride, and also commits herself to being a vocal coach and advocate for mental health.\n\nComing up, Porter will be one of stellar singers participating in the The 988 Lifeline Charity Event Featuring: “Heart & Soul” – A Musical Tribute to the Life & Times of Donny Hathaway, on Sept. 8 at the historic Orpheum Theatre in downtown Los Angeles. Click here for ticket information.\n\nCombining Get Together Foundation and Rock Cellar Productions, the event will be a major effort to raise awareness of the nationwide suicide prevention hotline (formerly an 800 number and now the three-digit) 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, and raise funds to help increase the level of care and support for those potentially at risk for suicide and their families.\n\nRock Cellar caught up with Alisan to talk about the show, her many-faceted career, new music and much more.\n\nRock Cellar: Thank you for pulling yourself away from hosting 60 million kids for a pool party, as it seemed on your Instagram.\n\nAlisan Porter: It was insane! Yeah, it was totally nuts. My son turned 12 and we just went for it. He had like 14 of his friends over, six or seven of which were girls. I was like, “What are we doing here?”\n\nRock Cellar: They grow up so fast!\n\nSo tell me about your new EP, The Ride. You shared another Instagram post with you talking about how you quit music, but then this new music happened. What’s the story there?\n\nAlisan Porter: Really, The Ride is my relationship with music. A lot of people think it’s about my life or a relationship — but it’s all about my relationship with music.\n\nAnd yeah, that reel was really interesting. I was at work, and you know, I like to be spontaneous on Instagram because I just think it’s more authentic. I quit music like every other day, because it’s impossible.\n\nBut I really was going through this moment where I was like, “Why am I doing this myself?” It’s just so difficult. It’s so hard to get anything to be anything unless you’re basically willing to sell your soul — which, maybe if I didn’t have kids, or maybe if I hadn’t had the type of career that I’ve had since I was three years old, maybe I would be more inclined to do that. But I just have never been.\n\nI came to this point where I was not inspired, not writing, not performing. I was on tour when COVID happened, and then it was kind of like, “Well…” I had made a record and then all the shows got canceled, and I was like, “Oh, this is ridiculous.”\n\nI started coaching during COVID, and that became so fulfilling, so great … and lucrative, too.\n\nRock Cellar: Well, that’s important.\n\nAlisan Porter: With a family, those things are good. Consistency is great. But I woke up two years ago in the middle of the night and my song “Meant For Me,” which is on the EP, was in my head. I literally have a voice note of me whispering it into the phone in the middle of the night from bed. And I was like, “Oh no, like, here we go.”\n\nOnce that happened, it was a spiral. Then I wrote “See in the Dark,” and then I wrote parts of “The Ride” and parts of “Rivers Dry,” and I had parts of “Bleedin'” from another session that I had done with with Shoshana Bean when I was writing for her. It was just one of those songs where I was like, “If nobody cuts this, I’m cutting it.” So that’s kind of how the whole EP came together.\n\nSpecifically the song “The Ride,” it just makes so much sense, it really is the story of my life in in the music biz.\n\nRock Cellar: You brought it up earlier, but what are the challenges of being a singer/songwriter trying to get your music heard these days? Even if it’s from someone who literally won The Voice, it seems like a challenge.\n\nAlisan Porter: I think it’s it’s interesting. You know, there are a lot of people who have won The Voice who are absolutely legit singer/songwriters who make their own music, and then there are some who, you know, are just singers. So I think it depends.\n\nIn general as an independent artist in this current social media climate, there’s a very specific way of doing things and getting your stuff out there, and it’s really just consistency. I’m thrilled with the response that I’ve been getting with this EP. Doing it all by myself, doing it with very little budget, doing it really for me. I’ve done it before, for the fame and the fortune, but this one was really just for me, and and I think that it’s gonna have a nice life.\n\nThat’s really all I wanted because at this point, am I gonna tour the world? I don’t know, maybe. Maybe I’m just gonna do my shows and play my music for the people who want to listen to it and enjoy that and move into other parts of the industry that I’m loving, like managing and producing, stuff like that. So I’m cool with the ride, you know, whatever the ride is, now I’m really okay with as long as it’s consistent and I get to do what I love.\n\nI think this project kind of moved me into that mindset. When you win The Voice, you don’t really have that mindset. You have the mindset of, “I’m going to be an overnight sensation and everyone’s going to finally know how great I am.” And that happens for maybe 10 to 12 minutes. So it’s a tough thing to find positivity in those moments, but looking back now and seeing how far I’ve come from that time … if I hadn’t had that I might not have been able to have the success that I have had in music. I know especially with followers and things like that, those are so important in the industry now. I am very grateful for that, and that happened because of The Voice.\n\nRock Cellar: You mentioned voice coaching. You have a Zoom masterclass coming up in August sometime. What’s that about?\n\nAlisan Porter: When COVID started, I was like, “What am I going to do? “And I thought, “Well, let me see if I can just share how this works for me with some other people,” and I ended up with a lot of kids. My cousin has a Zoom online dance studio, basically. He started it during COVID and it sort of blew up and he’s a hip-hop teacher and choreographer, and he has this Groove Interactive online program and I taught musical theater dance. I’m also a dancer, and I taught voice. I had these masterclasses where I shared how I connect to a song, I take everybody through a warmup and give them bits and pieces of how I break down a song, how I break down a vocal. And then everybody sings and we talk about it, and then they sing again. That’s kind of how it goes.\n\nAnd it’s just a really nice introduction into vocal performance and understanding how to tell a story, that kind of thing.\n\nRock Cellar: On that note of dancing, your husband Justin is a professional dancer and he’s going out right now with Peso Pluma?\n\nAlisan Porter: Yeah! We had a baby in 2021, he hasn’t gone on like a full-fledged tour since then. Our whole relationship, basically, he’s been on tour. That’s why we stay together. We have these nice breaks, it’s good. But he’s out right now and I’m really excited, this kind of music and this particular creative director and a choreographer really just showcases Justin the best.\n\nRock Cellar: Is it the same choreographer that did Peso Pluma at Coachella? Because that set was great.\n\nAlisan Porter: Yeah, they’re incredible. He’s worked for them before with Camila Cabello. He’s incredible. He’s doing what he does, and I’m doing what I do and I love that about our relationship, it really is just based in our art.\n\nRock Cellar: You’ve sung the national anthem before, I saw you share a video on Instagram from singing it at the White House. I asked Train’s Pat Monahan recently about this and his answer was hilarious — what’s your experience singing the anthem versus regular performing? What do you enjoy? Do you hate it? What’s it like?\n\nAlisan Porter: I mean, I sort of was like the Anthem Girl in Curly Sue, so it was like a thing that I did. I have a harder time singing the anthem these days with state of our country. But you know, I love Whitney Houston, she did the best anthem ever. She will always do the best anthem ever.\n\nAnd all I try to do is be as entertaining as that. I just try to be as as good as Whitney. I will never be better. But yeah, I mean as far as my own live shows and that kind of thing, I’m the most stoked about doing that. I have a big show coming up. Also, I’m opening for the Gin Blossoms in October at the Sagebrush Cantina. I’m really excited about that.\n\nRock Cellar: You’re also participating in the 988 Lifeline Charity Event featuring Heart & Soul, a musical tribute to Donny Hathaway, on Sept. 8 at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. How did you get involved in that?\n\nAlisan Porter: I was approached by Kevin Wachs — the executive producer of the upcoming show for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline — after he learned about my involvement with mental health awareness. He asked if I would participate in the show. I was thrilled to be able to lend my voice to this very important cause.\n\nI love Donny Hathaway. I’m a huge fan, always have been. And I’m also a huge proponent of mental health awareness. And you know, I have my own story with it. My mental health story surrounds sobriety. I’ve always been able to keep it together as long as I was sober, but if I’m not, it’s a whole different story. I’m always very quick to respond to being of service when it comes to that kind of stuff.\n\nRock Cellar: On that topic of sobriety and mental health, like you said, you’ve spoken about that in the past and your battle and your issues with it. Was it a challenge to open up about that at first in a public way?\n\nAlisan Porter: It was actually very freeing. I don’t really want to be like the quintessential child actor who blew it and left the industry and was a drug addict and all that. That’s not really my story. I definitely went through my struggles. I think I know more now that really it didn’t have as much to do with substance abuse as it did with … my natural state is, if you know about addiction, you know that it doesn’t matter what it is, it’s just that I have an addictive personality. I’ve learned to live my life in a way where I can exist and be productive and healthy and happy even with that.\n\nSo I basically found my — not the cure, because there’s never a cure — but a way of living that helps me with that.\n\nRock Cellar: How you stay grounded day to day, especially with the social media and how we’re just slammed with bad news all the time, compounded with our own internal struggles and thoughts and everything else?\n\nAlisan Porter: I have my moments. I’m not going to say that it’s all peachy keen, but like I said, as long as I put sobriety first, really, my life is so beautiful. I have a lot of quality problems. Bills are stressful and kids are stressful, but you know, through it I’m learning how to live my life as a sober person. All of those things I have gratitude for — gratitude that I have bills to pay, gratitude that I have a roof over my head, gratitude that I have children. All the other stuff comes second, but I’m able to sort of put that somewhere and co-exist and be happy.\n\nRock Cellar: Back to the 988 Lifeline campaign and awareness about mental health. This interview is actually being conducted two days before the seventh anniversary of Chester Bennington from Linkin Park’s death in 2017, when he passed away from suicide. This is such an obvious concern that everyone knows about, but it also feels like it isn’t discussed enough.\n\nAlisan Porter: I’m even watching right now, these young people on TikTok. There’s a mother talking about her daughter’s suicide and you know … I can’t even really fathom that occurring, much as I’m sure she didn’t either. I think we don’t really know what to do. If I cut myself cooking or something and needed to call 911, it’d be automatic, but it’s not automatic for me to know to call somewhere if I’m feeling suicidal. And I think that right now, especially with youth every day, maybe it’s just so different, right? I mean, everything is just so different. So for us to have different tools, I think is going to be really, really important, and if I can help shed any light on that I’m happy to take part.\n\nRock Cellar: There’s also a video on YouTube from a while back of you singing “Smells Like Teen Spirit” with the Postmodern Jukebox.\n\nAlisan Porter: Oh my gosh, that was forever ago!\n\nThat was all them. We had a conversation, I loved Nirvana growing up, I was a huge, huge fan in like eighth, ninth grade. I wrote KURT on my arm, even. But I really wanted to do something in the rock world, and I loved the idea of it being something like that. That was super, super fun.\n\nRock Cellar: You also were in the Broadway production of the Ten Commandments with Val Kilmer and Adam Lambert?\n\nAlisan Porter: Yes, I was 23. It was insane. Max Azria, rest his soul. He produced the event. He he was the designer and founder of BCBG. There was a show in France, he took that and brought it over to Broadway. I think it was some ridiculous amount of money that they spent and they got Val to play Moses, it was just a trip. It was amazing.\n\nAdam and I were the young leads, we’d met right before that. I had done a performance with him in this kind of rock circus show that ran a couple times a year in L.A., and he was in the audience and we ended up doing the show together.\n\nIt was insane. We had huge dressing rooms in what was the Kodak Theatre, we had like Nobu every day for lunch, we had parties at his house with Sean Lennon. It was a whole experience. It was definitely my most “Hollywood” job I ever had. The music was amazing, we really got to sing how we wanted to. It was kind of a disaster of a show, but at the same time, it was one of the most fulfilling projects I ever worked on.\n\nRock Cellar: Since you are a “former child star,” as they say. Some of them have a rough time after early stardom, while others have enduring careers like you’ve had in various areas. From being on Star Search at three years old to starring in Curly Sue and all that, you were thrust into the limelight pretty young. Do you have any particularly wild memories of when it hit you that, “OK, this is kind of out of control” in terms of what you were up to when most kids were barely even in school?\n\nAlisan Porter: There are some things I look back on now like, “Yes, that was all totally normal.” Now I’m like, “Oh yeah, I used to get my makeup done in the trailer while River Phoenix played ‘Here Comes the Sun’ to me on guitar. Or I remember eating Tofutti ice cream with Joaquin [Phoenix] and his family and them rolling cigarettes.\n\nI remember going to [her Parenthood co-star] Steve Martin‘s house and hanging out. One of the coolest things that ever happened to me when it comes to Steve Martin is that he sent me a postcard — I was probably eight years old. He was in London at the time, and he sent me a postcard of Princess Diana and wrote “the Princess wanted to say hi to you. Just hoping you and your family are doing well,” and so on. I still have that postcard. I need to find it, it’s probably one of my prized possessions.\n\nI don’t get starstruck very often but I feel like that’s pretty freakin’ cool.\n\nI mean, there have been a lot really crazy moments. I sang with Christina Aguilera … when I think about my career all at once, sometimes I’m like, “Oh, it’s been whatever,” but when I think about those types of moments that I have had, it’s pretty epic. Pretty cool.\n\nRock Cellar: As you grew older in the business, was there a shift that helped push you into other areas and away from acting?\n\nAlisan Porter: I think that the music was so powerfully ingrained in me that it just felt like acting was a job and music was my passion. And once I had done literally a decade of work nonstop in acting, I think at that point I was just a little burned out.\n\nI’ve acted on Broadway, I feel like I act when I sing, so it just sort of cross-pollinated to those moments. I can use it for the things that I’m really passionate about, but on its own I don’t know. I just don’t think I’m that good at it. Okay, I was good as a kid, but I could never keep a straight face. I hated learning lines. It just doesn’t come as naturally to me as singing or dancing.\n\nRock Cellar: So acting is harder than singing and dancing, at least in your experience?\n\nAlisan Porter: I’ve always been very blessed with singing, it’s always come very naturally to me. It’s always just been in my DNA, dancing as well. Not that I was the most amazing dancer, but I was good enough to be in A Chorus Line on Broadway. Acting I would say is at the bottom of the totem pole, but I wouldn’t say no to something that felt right. The only thing left on my bucket list as far as the industry goes would be a musical movie.\n\nI’m waiting to play Janis Joplin.\n\nRock Cellar: You were also on Pee-Wee’s Playhouse as a kid.\n\nAlisan Porter: It was absolutely magical. Totally magical. I will never forget that either. I mean, yeah, [Paul Reubens] was the best, and I actually reconnected with him shortly before he passed away.\n\nRock Cellar: Just out of the blue?\n\nAlisan Porter: Out of the blue. I’m still really close to my my manager, who’s been my manager my whole life, Doris Robinson, and she was close to him and they kept in touch. He called me, he said he wanted to send me a Christmas card. He called me and we had the best conversation.\n\nBut yeah that show … that was real. All those things moved. From being a fan of that show and then being able to be on it and experiencing him, he was so lovely to kids. He was so great to work with, he’s somebody I remember feeling like we were on the same level. He never made me feel like I was the kid coming in to do the acting, I was part of his experience.\n\nRock Cellar: What would you say was the best or most memorable concert you’ve attended as a fan?\n\nAlisan Porter: Joni Mitchell [at the Hollywood Bowl recently]. She’s my icon. Never in my wildest dreams had I thought that I would be able to see her live. I’m trying to think of what other show was life-changing.\n\nHonestly I think it was probably like Lilith Fair, when I was in high school. I would go every year to Lilith Fair, Tracy Chapman and Sarah McLachlan and Fiona Apple in her prime, that was fucking mind-blowing. I just saw Sarah McLachlan at the Bowl and I know every single word.\n\nSomehow I don’t even know all the words to my own songs, but somehow I knew every lyric to every single one of her songs. I think it was my teenage years came flooding back to me.\n\nRock Cellar: I don’t make music, but I’ve listened to it for going on 35 years now or whatever. I don’t remember where I parked or whether I fed the cats this morning, but I’ll remember the lyrics to a song I haven’t heard in 25 years if it pops up on Spotify or if I hear it at the store.\n\nAlisan Porter: Then that all took me back, I went in deep to like Paula Cole, I was listening to all of that … after I saw Sarah again, I just dove all the way back into the Meredith Brooks, Joan Osborne, all those records I was obsessed with back then. The Indigo Girls.\n\nAnd then I was like, “Oh, this is why I write the way I write,” I get it now.\n\nRock Cellar: Who do you want to see that you haven’t seen live?\n\nAlisan Porter: Chris Stapleton, he’s my favorite of all time.\n\nRock Cellar: What’s a song you wish you wrote?"
