        "text": "Jane Siberry radiated benevolence  a sly, purposeful, savvy benevolence  at Joe’s Pub on Friday night. She sang and spoke about beauty, love, harmony, understanding, grace and magic  actually, about a dog named Magic, and walking him through a city full of mundane and miraculous apparitions. She used that as a loose narrative thread to string together her songs, mostly from her two latest albums, “With What Shall I Keep Warm?” (2009) and “Dragon Dreams” (2008), both on her own Sheeba label.\n\nMs. Siberry is the Canadian songwriter best known for her “Calling All Angels,” which mingles uncertainty and benediction. She has been a fully independent musician since the mid-1990s, releasing her own albums. Although she has delved into various styles, toying with electronics and jazz, at the core of her music are folky guitar chords or a stately piano that hints at church and chamber music. Her voice has a reedy quaver and a tinge of breathiness like a breeze through a wheat field.\n\nIn 2006 Ms. Siberry got rid of many possessions and renamed herself Issa. But about a month ago, she said onstage, she decided to return to Jane Siberry. She said she is different, adding, “I now can take my personal journey and make it a bit more private again.” Fans could still know Issa as “a secret love name,” she said.\n\nAt Joe’s Pub she performed solo, playing piano or guitar and using recorded tracks that might incorporate cello, percussion or Celtic pipes. But she was singing about connections: between lovers, between mother and child, between friends, among all of humanity. “When we are queen,” she sang, “there will be more dancing and less worrying/And more singing and less hurrying.”\n\nIf that sounds a little hippie-ish, perhaps it is, but somehow it’s not naïve or cloying. Ms. Siberry is a down-to-earth earth mother who moves easily between parables and practicality.\n\nHer songs, and her recitations between them, could be creation myths or surreal voyages. “Someone came in a boat made of ice, and they’re sitting in a chair made of fire,” she offered in a spoken-word segment. But just as often she is intimate and direct. In the hymnlike “Mama Hereby,” she told her mother, “The pain we cause each other is killing me,” while in “You Had a Good Thing,” a breezy folk-rock song, she chided, “What you couldn’t get down to was treating our girlfriend right.”\n\nMs. Siberry wants everyone to be treated right. In her songs not only lovers but also waitresses, cubicle workers, problem teenagers and total strangers deserve random acts of kindness. She sees obstacles and human failings, but for the length of a song, with subtly climbing harmonies and her ever-encouraging voice, she insists it’s possible to rise above them."
