        "text": "Post by Ling-Ling on\n\nLoved this song as well. I bought the maxi back in the day, I might have to dig it out.\n\nAnd she is the true definition of a one-hit wonder. None of her other songs even charted. Most one-hit wonders at least have one other song chart.\n\nPost by Michael1973 on\n\nActually, she had one follow-up, at least on the Hot 100. It was called Welcome To The Real World. I think it peaked in the 50's.\n\nPost by Ling-Ling on\n\nIgnore that message then, LOL. I looked up her chart history, and didn't see anything about \"WTTRW.\" Could be a part on their error.\n\nPost by strong4PMB! on\n\nSince I asked about this on R&R...\n\nIs this the same song as Tonya Mitchell's of the same name? :o\n\nThen I listened to Jane's song and realized that they were different!\n\nPost by ClassicCase on\n\nGreat song. Only wished radio paid more and more attention to her other cuts on that one album. She also charted on the urban chart with that same song (Don't Wanna Fall In Love) and did exceptionally well with it. Which reminds me-I wonder if Jane still wears that piece of jewelry attachment that pierces from her earlobe to her left nostril. We know how painful THAT could be!\n\nPost by Daniel Shywaoub on\n\nI don't have access to my old Billboard stuff handy, but I believe 'Welcome To The Real World' got to #48 on the Hot 100. It was actually the first single, but it didn't chart until its rerelease after the big hit. I remember seeing the video a wee bit on MTV before DWFIL; of course, with her look she was quite the eyecatching attraction to viewers! She then barely made New & Active beginning in 11/5/93 with 'Do Whatcha Do', the first single from her sophomore album. It didn't 'do' enough to make it into my compendium, though...it would've made it to #110.\n\nPost by 620 Soul Train on\n\nThe Teddy Riley remix was what made the song go top ten on the Urban chart, I certainly bought it, I liked the original just as well. Depending on what mood I was in, I would choose a mix to play. I do wish they would have included the original mix on the Maxi single, a lot times they do.\n\nPost by jond7699 on\n\nI loved this song. It is still one of my favorite 90's songs. It peaked at #1 on my personal chart but only stayed there one week. I don't really remember \"Welcome To The Real World\"\n\nPost by prenatt1166 on\n\nUU-BRU Radio Playlist\n\n[red]For Week Ending March 24, 1990[/red]\n\n(Rank This Week, Last Week, Artist, Title)\n\n01 02 Jane Child - Don't Wanna Fall In Love\n\n02 01 Phil Collins - I Wish It Would Rain Down\n\n03 03 Madonna - Keep It Together\n\n04 06 Linda Ronstadt & Aaron Neville - All My Life\n\n05 05 Michael Damian - Was It Nothing At All\n\n06 04 Janet Jackson - Escapade\n\n07 09 Kiss - Forever\n\n08 10 Cher - Heart Of Stone\n\n09 11 Tommy Page/New Kids On The Block - I'll Be Your Everything\n\n10 13 Michael Bolton - How Can We Be Lovers\n\nDWFIL spent 4 weeks at #1. Jane Child was almost a one-hit wonder on my chart. The follow-up single, \"Welcome To The Real World\", spent a single week at #40 in June 1990.\n\nDWFIL was the #8 single of 1990.\n\nwww.keystonehighways.com/uubru1990.html"
