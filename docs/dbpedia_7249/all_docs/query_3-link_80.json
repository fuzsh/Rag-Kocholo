        "text": "James Horatio Torres of Alpine made 50 adventurous trips around the Sun before he was called home on July 02, in El Paso, surrounded by his loved ones. James earned his wings and flew into the palms of Jesus Christ.\n\nJames was born into a pioneering family in Alpine on May 24, 1974. The only son of Elva Torres, grandchild to Horacio & Paula Torres, greatgrandchild to Mama Jane Arriola Torres, and greatgreat- grandchild to Antonia and Gerado Arriola. James received his Holy Sacrament at Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church, where he was a lifelong member. James graduated from Alpine High School and then attended Sul Ross State University and San Antonio College.\n\nOur Beloved James was an only child, but he grew up with all his cousins whom he loved like brothers and sisters, growing up in a tight-knit family. In high school, he played for the Alpine Fightin’ Bucks when they almost went all the way to the state playoffs during the 1992-1993 school year. Their record still holds to this day a 13/0 season. During this school year, the Bucks also had a great baseball year. James loved football & baseball and his favorite team, win or lose, was the Dallas Cowboys. James was blessed to go see them play several times in his lifetime. James had the opportunity to fly in hot air balloons over Taos, NM, he rode in an old historic train from Alpine to Van Horn, he went fishing, camping, hiking, and skiing, in some of the most beautiful mountains, lakes and rivers in Texas, northern New Mexico, and southern Colorado.\n\nHis other passions in life were laughter, telling jokes, BBQs, music, being outdoors, and teaching those around him what he knew. He was very artistic and loved to work with his hands, working on yards, and building things. He was a great artist and always enjoyed helping others. He always advocated for those in need, especially the elderly, children, the homeless, the oppressed, and those who depend on others. James always counted his blessings. James was a proprietor who owned “Brewster County Lawn Services.”\n\nOur beloved James leaves behind in mourning and brokenhearted, his mother Elva, and his aunts and uncles: Laura Torres, Irma & Cruz Lechuga, Lolly Torres, Jerry Torres & Dara, Lydia Torres, Billy & Irene Torres, Pam Torres, Marta Torres. Also, his cousins (who were like brothers and sisters): Billy Jack, JoJo, & Victor Torres, John & Cruz Lechuga, Stephanie & Charles Melendez, Kim Torres, Amanda Torres, Kristen Hardwick & Tomei Gonzalez as well as several other nieces, nephews, cousins, greataunts, and great-uncles, and his good friends, Maddie & Julie Morton, and his emotional support kids, Blue & Chico. James, our hearts are broken, we love you and we miss you, and we will keep you in our hearts and in our prayers until we meet again.\n\nJames went on to join his beloved grandparents Paula & Horacio Torres, Uncle Raul (Magoo) Torres, greatgrandmother; Mama Jane, Aunt Kathy Torres, and all his family and friends who had gone before him. James now belongs to all the ages.\n\nJames will now go and complete his Baptismal Vows.\n\nThe Memorial Holy Rosary: will be recited on August 24 at 10 a.m. by Our Lady of Peace Rosary Group, at Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church in Alpine.\n\nThe Memorial Mass of the Resurrection: to be celebrated by Fr. Edroud Jean, at Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church in Alpine at 10:30 a.m. on August 24.\n\nThe Committal of Ashes: will follow at Holy Angels Catholic Cemetery where he will be laid to rest between his beloved grandparents.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please carry out an unexpected & unsolicited act of kindness for someone in need in his name or a donation to The Saint Vincent de Paul Society, the Bereavement Committee at Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church, or a dog shelter of your choice.\n\nPrayer for the Organ Donors Jesus, we pray that you will bless the lives of those who are organ donors- without them, there is no hope and there is no transplant.\n\nMay they be blessed for their compassion to restore Life for those who are critically ill.\n\nAmen"
