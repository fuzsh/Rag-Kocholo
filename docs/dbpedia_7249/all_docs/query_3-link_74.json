        "text": "With just 21 years around the sun, Dinah Jane has accomplished more than most. Her star initially rose alongside her pop sisters Fifth Harmony in her teens but in between chart-topping hits like “Work From Home” or “Worth It” was a longing for something more.\n\nThe “more” arrived this spring in the form of her debut collection, Dinah Jane 1, three tracks that play to her power vocals and confident nature. Leading single “Heard It Before” gives listeners the feels of the aughts with the help of producer extraordinaire, J. R. Rotem. Jane’s accompanying tracks like “Pass Me By” and “Fix it” are just as alluring given her honey coated vocals. Instead of jumping from genre to genre, the songs are in the vein of Jane’s R&B language, a move that transpired after a reflection into her musical identity.\n\nThe journey included experimentation with her first solo effort, “Bottled Up” with Ty Dolla $ign and Marc E. Bassey. The song was a bop by nature due to its similarity to her work in Fifth Harmony, which left Jane determined to find her sound.\n\n“Being a solo artist now made it hard to define who I was because I was singing so many different styles before,” Jane tells VIBE. “I had to take time for me to really cope and understand what it is that I really want to come out as my true identity. When I dropped my first record “Bottled Up” it was more me transitioning from Fifth Harmony to myself, I really love that I took some down time to understand who I was and who I want to be.”\n\nAfter a session with a producer in Atlanta, Jane arrived at the realization that the artists in her phone (Monica, Mariah Carey), was a sign for her to dig up her soulful roots. It’s hard to deny Jane’s vocals helped to build her former group and now, her own career.\n\n“The most challenging part about making music has been me being honest,” Jane said. “I have a tendency of holding back but keeping people’s image safe. I was always afraid to portray them as something that people didn’t know about and so my thing is like, ‘Oh, I don’t want them to think of my family like this or my friend who’s not my friend right now.’ I felt like if I wanted to create something authentic, real and raw I have to be honest not only to myself but to the public and stop putting a front that everything’s good.”\n\nWith a new attitude and direction, Jane is ready to fly above her worries. Check out our chat with the singer-songwriter below.\n\n***\n\nVIBE: When you were putting your three-pack together, what was going through your head? Was there a particular sound or moment you wanted to catch?\n\nDinah Jane: It was more like a certain direction. I felt like there was a part of me that had not been exposed yet as far as style. I really love that I took some down time to understand who I was and who I want to be. I started listening back to records where I was like, ‘Wow, this is something that I wish was mine.’ Some of Monica’s records, Faith Evans or Mariah Carey, by the way, she followed me on Instagram [Laughs].\n\nCongratulations!\n\nShe followed me on Instagram so I kind of got that verification that I should definitely do R&B. Those are artists that I’ve always been inspired by. I remember I went back to when I did my first audition on X Factor, and I said, “Who is that I want to sing and showcase my talent?” It was Beyoncé’s “If I Were A Boy.”\n\nI felt like if this is a perfect time for me to throw in a bowl of my favorite artists that I’ve always looked up to and mesh it into who I am now. When I did “Fix It,” I felt like it was so organic for me to go that direction and lean towards, so, when that happened the song became what it is now. I love the message behind it, I didn’t realize it would empower so many people.\n\n“Fix It” is actually my favorite out of the three. You just referenced your identity. Do you know what that is now? Or is that sonically or personally?\n\nI think more so sonically, that’s where I was lost the most because I had to put myself in a drawer for seven years. Now that I’m here, being a solo artist like I said, I was lost. Sonically I had to redefine who Dinah Jane was this whole time. I remember being in a session in Atlanta and this guy at the time asked me, “Who do you have on your phone? Let’s look through it.”\n\nThe most challenging part about making music has been me being honest.\n\nDinah Jane\n\nHe’s going through my phone and it’s all R&B, not even that much pop, just singers from back then. And he’s just like, “I was not expecting this, I thought you’d be the hype girl listening to all trap music.” I have that personality trust me, but musically this is me. That clicked in my head that I was heading somewhere else and I needed to jump back to my old ways.\n\nI love that. “Heard It All Before” has gotten so much love from your fans. I know you’re not supposed to look at the comments but one that stood out was “I love this sound, leave pop alone.” Do you ever feel trapped in one genre since you started within the pop bubble?\n\nIt’s funny that you say that. I feel like people or fans they kind of want to box you into who they think you are. I was telling someone, my fans they sometimes think they know me better than I know myself and it’s kind of scary. There are times where I’m like, “No I don’t have to be one way.” It’s crazy cause when I go to the studio I feel like I can be so versatile. I can do R&B easy but there are sometimes where I want to do those pop records, “Always Be My Baby” is that pop record to me and some people are good with it, some aren’t but I think it just comes with your fanbase.\n\nFor me, they know my potential, honestly, they saw me on X Factor or even my YouTube days when I was 11 or 12 years old. They’re like, “No Dinah, this is you, this is you, I want you to keep doing more of these.” Eventually, I’ll want to do some other things as well. But as of right now, it’s truly R&B.\n\nWhen it comes to creating you’re always challenging yourself. What were some of the challenges that you’ve been facing this year while making music?\n\nThe most challenging part about making music has been me being honest. I have a tendency of holding back but keeping people’s image safe. It’s always been my challenge and I felt like if I wanted to create something authentic and real and raw I have to be honest to myself as well, not only to myself but to the public and stop putting a front that everything’s good. My Mom always told me, “You’ve got to be real with yourself.”\n\nFor sure. All three of these songs are super straightforward. What was it about keeping that energy while you were making these songs?\n\nI was just trying to balance it. Like I said it was the most challenging part balancing that and I feel like with “Heard It All Before,” it was the most fun, relatable song to write because my best friend was going through something. I was like “What?! He said what?!” We were literally having a full on group chat about it. When I did the music video, I wanted it to be about the situation that I was in with my girl. We were like, “You know what we’ve heard that all before.” I just want to make this bundle relatable, sexy but then also swaggy and just not try so hard. So, when we put these three songs together, it felt so organic and true to who I was.\n\nEven in the video, you exude so much confidence. What does confidence mean to you?\n\nI think it’s self-love. When you truly love yourself, you can see it in your face. You can see it in the glow and the energy you’re giving to people. I wasn’t always this confident, I would definitely say I was never this confident but, thanks to my mom, she always expressed that to me.\n\nShe said, “Dinah, I know you don’t feel that beautiful today but you need to pick on the little things that matter. What’s your favorite feature? Your lips. What’s your favorite outfit you got going on? Pay attention to your best qualities other than that one negative thing you’re picking on.”\n\nThe confidence was never there but when you have people that are around you always encouraging you to love yourself and realizing your truth and worth, that’s when the confidence kicks in. It’s not something that’s overnight, it takes time. It took years for me to realize that. Like I said, you have to surround yourself by honest, real people who can definitely make you see what you’re not seeing.\n\nFacts. Have you become that vessel for your friends as well? Like passing all of that on. Your mom passed it to you, you pass it to your friends, are you that person?\n\nYeah, it’s like a telephone game. I have a younger sister who’s 17 and she’s always been insecure about her weight or her breakouts and I’m like, “You’re a teenager, you’re supposed to go through that phase. If I went through that you’ve got to go through it too.”\n\nIn a way, I have to guide her through the stages. I was just talking to her last night and she’s telling me about her friends and how she feels like she doesn’t fit in, or certain cousins where she feels like she has to be a certain way. I was like, “Don’t be a certain way, the way you carry yourself will vibrate and you will be so much more vibrant, it’ll grasp more onto you. Just be your true self, you don’t have to be anything else. I know who you are and you know who you are.”\n\nI feel like kind of being that older sister I feel like her mom sometimes. So I always feel this responsibility that she always feels 100.\n\nWhat are some other plans you have for yourself, with your music for the year?\n\nThis is the first bundle. People wanted it to be named an EP but I was like, “Nah. It cannot be an EP because an EP is at least five to seven songs top.”\n\nThis bundle is like a mini-project, it’s the anticipation for the actual album. So, I want you to keep getting the feel of who I am, keep giving you these sneak peeks and then boom, hit you with the album. That’s in the works, we’ll see what happens. That’s what we say now but sometimes things change, so don’t get too excited.\n\nHave you’ve been working with anybody? Any featured artists or any producers who are really understanding of who you are as an artist?\n\nAs far as features, I have one and then I’m working on another one.\n\nSo you can’t say who they are?\n\nI can’t say. As far as producers and writers, J.R. Rotem is literally my dog. We walked into the studio and all of his plaques are all over the wall, plastered everywhere and we were like, “We get it, you’re a legend. You’re going to make me a legend,” is what I felt in that room. I feel this great connection with him where we can be friends but also have that chemistry musically where he can connect with me instantly.\n\nI love how we did “Fix It,” he brought out all of the live instruments and he made it feel like you were actually on stage, he made it feel bigger than what it was. So, I give him so many props for that because I’ve never felt that way in a session where I felt like I was onstage and it was just me by myself, no one else, well of course with a whole a** band, but I just felt the topic and the song, the musicality behind it is what meshed so well because of him. He is my dog for sure and my therapist because if it weren’t for him this song would have not been made.\n\nStream Dinah Jane 1 below."
