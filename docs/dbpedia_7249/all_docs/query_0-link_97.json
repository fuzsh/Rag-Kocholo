        "text": "When it came to rock ’n’ roll, her peers were dismissive at best, contemptuous at worst. But in the mid-1960s, a fiercely open-minded journalist in Cleveland dared to start taking the music seriously, along with the artists who made it and the fans who loved it — and a beat was born.\n\nEverybody knows about Jane Scott’s review of a concert by a future Rock and Roll Hall of Famer at the Allen Theatre in 1975. “His name is Bruce Springsteen,” she wrote. “He will be the next superstar.”\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that this wasn’t the first time Jane revealed a gift for prophecy. Last week, deep in the bowels of The Plain Dealer’s library, I discovered a faded copy of another review of hers, from a LONG time ago. She wrote:\n\n“His name is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. HE will be the next superstar.”\n\nI didn’t realize The Plain Dealer was even publishing in the 1700s.\n\nAnother time, another place, who knows how Jane Scott might have rewritten history. How lucky we were to have her here with us. In OUR time. In THIS place.\n\nWhen the Beatles made their Cleveland debut in front of 11,000 hyperventilating girls at Public Hall in 1964, Jane was there. She wasn’t reviewing the show, though. That assignment fell to The Plain Dealer’s classical music critic, who panned the concert.\n\nQuote: “It sounded like a battery of air-raid sirens, cherry bombs and starving orangutans.” End quote.\n\nClearly, a fresh set of ears and a fresh set of eyes would be required to cover the rock ’n’ roll revolution.\n\nYet who could have guessed that one of the first reporters at a major daily newspaper to make a full-time beat of what many dismissed as greasy kids stuff would be a woman old enough to be the mother — or even the grandmother — of the readers she faithfully served and the rock stars she frequently disarmed with her sweet demeanor.\n\nBlonde hair. Red eyeglasses. Concert ticket pinned to her blouse. And a bulging purse stuffed with earplugs, sunscreen, peanut butter sandwiches and, for all I know, a pup tent.\n\nIf Jane didn’t write about it in her “What’s Happening” column, it wasn’t happening.\n\nHere in the rock ’n’ roll capital of the world, we couldn’t have asked for a more devoted chronicler. To me, Jane ranks right up there with Alan Freed. He first popularized rock ’n’ roll in Cleveland. But it was Jane who took up the torch and nurtured our passion for the music, for nearly half a century.\n\nWith insatiable curiosity, unflagging enthusiasm and an open mind, Jane covered not only rock, but R&B. Country. Folk. Disco. Punk. Rap. Grunge. You name it — Jane was hip to it.\n\nIn the 1990s, when I showed up instead of you-know-who backstage at a concert by Danzig, one of the heaviest heavy-metal bands around, the first thing I heard was: “Where’s Jane?”\n\nLet me share just a little medley of some of Jane’s greatest hits with you. And these clips, by the way, are real.\n\nHere she is on a 1972 concert by the Jackson 5, featuring 13-year-old Michael Jackson:\n\n“For most of the young girls, Mike was a mighty one,” Jane wrote.\n\n“Backstage, the group’s father, Joseph Jackson, said he gives the boys an allowance. Little Michael, who was up an hour after his bedtime, gets $5 a week.\n\n“‘I spend it on candy and things like that,’ ” Michael told Jane.\n\nWhen David Bowie launched his first U.S. tour in 1972 in Cleveland, Jane was right there, taking notes.\n\n“He looked like a young Katherine Hepburn, tall and imperially slim,” she wrote.\n\nA young Katherine Hepburn?! Only Jane could think of that — and get away with it.\n\nAnd here she is on The Material Girl in 1985:\n\n“Madonna . . . turned out to be sizzling rather than saintly, brash rather than heartwarming like Cyndi Lauper, but always a stunner.\n\n“Under all the trash and cockiness is a real talent.”\n\nIt’s often said that Jane never wrote an unkind word about anyone. While it’s true that she gave most artists the benefit of the doubt, and that this benefit was almost limitless, let’s not forget her write-up of a 1987 Beastie Boys concert. This was her lede: “The Beastie Boys are crude and lewd without a redeeming social value in sight.”\n\nWe don’t know if the Beastie Boys took Jane’s criticism to heart. Eventually, though, they went from fighting for their right to party to fighting for Tibetan freedom.\n\nYou’ve probably already heard the one about the time she went car-shopping with Jimi Hendrix. And the one about the time she had a beer backstage with Jim Morrison. And the one about the time she sang a duet with Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.\n\nSo let me wind down by telling you a story about Jane that you haven’t heard before.\n\nA few years ago, Michael Heaton and I dropped by Ennis Court in Lakewood to visit Jane for her birthday. By then, she was retired. But music remained a big part of Jane’s life.\n\nWhen Michael and I got there, Jane and the other residents were enjoying an afternoon performance by a high-school chorus. Michael slipped a notebook and pen to Jane. Instinctively, without hesitation, she began jotting down notes on the show.\n\nAfterward, word got around that the students were in the presence of true greatness: JANE SCOTT! The legendary journalist!\n\nOne by one, members of the school choir came over to meet Jane. Maybe they were hoping she might regale them with stories of rock’s glory days. But instead of telling the teenagers about the time she interviewed so-and-so, she began interviewing THEM.\n\nWhat’s YOUR name? How old are YOU? And, of course, the ever-popular: Where do YOU go to high school?\n\nYes, Jane was a fan of the music. Even more so, though, Jane was a fan of US. For her, the rapture of rock ’n’ roll never ended at the foot of the stage. It extended well past the spotlight, all the way to the nosebleed seats and beyond, to all of us.\n\nCould it be true? Could you really achieve transcendence in the middle of a Doobie Brothers concert, singing “Black Water” with thousands of fellow pilgrims?\n\nMusic “brings you together,” Jane told me once. “We’re all God’s children, every one of us.”\n\nThere is no shortage of ego in either the music business or the newspaper business. But Jane was ego-less. She wanted to hear about you, and she treated everyone with respect. Everybody had a story that made her want to whip out her notebook.\n\nMaybe you were the next big thing.\n\nOr maybe you were a fan at a show.\n\nOr maybe you were just a kid from Parma Heights. And you used to grab The Plain Dealer as soon as you rolled out of bed. And, over breakfast, you would devour Jane’s dispatches from the front lines of rock ’n’ roll. She made it sound like so much fun.\n\nJane was my hero. She was an inspiration. And she was my friend.\n\nThank you, Jane.\n\nLong after the screaming voices and wailing electric guitars and pounding drums stop ringing in our ears, the memory of your beautiful spirit will stay with us for the rest of our lives.\n\nLike a song we can’t get out of our heads. A song we all sang together. The sweetest song we ever heard.\n\nHer name was Jane Scott. She was a superstar, too. And tonight, in rock ’n’ roll heaven, no star shines brighter."
