        "text": "As you know on Fridays I usually write a music flashback post. But, this Friday I’m doing something a little different. Instead of just looking back, today we’ll be looking at some current music and comparing it to a nice Flashback Friday cut.\n\nThe first song is by rock trio Paramore. It’s called, “Ain’t It Fun” and was released in February of 2014. The lead vocalist Hayley Williams, and the song’s chorus reminds me a lot of a 90s singer named Jane Child and her 1990 hit song called, “Welcome To The Real World”. And, the two songs seem to even have a very similar message.\n\nNow let’s see if you agree.\n\nHere is Paramore’s Ain’t It Fun\n\nHere’s Jane Child’s Welcome To The Real World\n\nDid you remember Jane Child’s Welcome To The Real World?\n\nDid you think the Paramore song and the Jane Child song were similar?"
