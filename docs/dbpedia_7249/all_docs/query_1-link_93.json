        "text": "For some, this song could remind you of any number of 80’s - or 90’s pop songs. In fact, I had to double-check when this came out - I thought 1991 or so, but no, it was released in 1989. “Don’t Wanna Fall In Love” was written, played and produced by Jane Child peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1990 and no. 6 on the R&B chart - that didn’t happen often for a white artist.\n\nThis is one of those songs that though the production immediately screams the decade it came out, it just doesn’t feel dated. Those synths…love how you hear the hook of the song in the beginning, and her voice in the verses…whooo! Uplifting and powerful. Let’s note again that she played all the instruments (sans guitar, I believe) and did all the programming and production.\n\nI may have had a bit of a crush on Jane back then, thanks to that video - come on, she looks SO cool, with the braided mullet (what?), boots, overcoat…and that funky/cool/edgy nosering and chain that goes to the earring. Saw that video a lot back in 1989 and it still stands out - especially at 3:14 or so, at the end of that swirling bridge, when she shouts, “no!” Love that!\n\nThe inevitable question: whatever happend to her? Jane’s first success was her biggest, she did a couple of albums after that. According to Wikipedia, she’s married to the musical director of Let’s Make a Deal, with her third album, Surge, coming out in 2002. Interstingly, considering the timing of writing and publishing this post, she recorded a cover of Tina Turner’s “We Don’t Need Another Hero” in 1994. And check it out: Jane performed “Don’t Wanna Fall in Love” on the The Wayne Brady Show, with Wayne accompanying her, 10 years ago, still looking cool with long braids (no funky nose ring and chain combo, though).\n\nShare"
