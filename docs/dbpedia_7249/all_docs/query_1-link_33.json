Try here: Jane Child website\n\n****\n\nA short summary from Wiki: (More Wiki info here: WIKI – JANE CHILD)\n\nJane Child (born 15 February 1967, Toronto) is a Canadian dance-pop singer, producer and musician. She is perhaps best known for her 1990 hit song “Don’t Wanna Fall in Love”, which peaked at #1 on “Radio & Records”, and #2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for three weeks in the spring of that year. A remix of the single earned her a 1991 Juno Award for Dance Recording of the Year. She was known for her eclectic fashion style, which included spiked hair with long braids and wearing a nose chain.\n\n****\n\nNot an mp3 fanatic yet but might become one as MP3 album prices continue to feature sales – MP3s on sale at Amazon\n\n****\n\nSearch for Jane Child records, cassettes and CDs on EBay:\n\nVinyl\n\nCassettes\n\nCDs\n\nJane Child Memorabilia on EBay – not too precise a search.\n\n****\n\nWhat Jane Child music I have in my cassette collection."
