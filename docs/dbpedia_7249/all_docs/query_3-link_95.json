        "text": "What happened to Jane Doe? An unsolved abduction case in Boca Raton remains bizarre, frightening, and now riding on a renewed wave of intrigue due to a three-part crime documentary suggesting the suspect is a Swedish serial killer.\n\nEarlier this week, our CBS12 team contacted Jane Doe’s attorney and asked if she wanted to do an interview for this special report. We offered to keep her identity a secret, as her name has never been released. However, she declined.\n\nA former FBI agent agreed to sit down with CBS12’s Katie Bente to talk about the horrifying experience the young woman went through. He says something other cops won’t say: the Jane Doe case and two other crimes are all related.\n\nFormer FBI agent John MacVeigh says that in 2007, a monster chose Boca Raton as a hunting ground, targeting a high-end shopping mall to prey on unsuspecting women and their children. MacVeigh has spent the last 10 years of his career trying to find that monster.\n\n“It still haunts me. I mean, to this day this is the one case you know that I look this is 2024. The incident happened 2007, and we're still sitting here talking about it,” MacVeigh said.\n\nWe know one person has seen the suspect’s face and lived. But her name has never been made public.\n\nMacVeigh has met with her and gone over the sequence of events of August 7th. He was part of a task force created to look at the Jane Doe case and two other cases with striking similarities.\n\n“I definitely believe they're connected. I think it was a progression. I think, you know, whoever started this is modus operandi, or MO, they call it. Moved from accosting a single woman who probably fought back or resisted or did something and then the suspect then moved to a woman who had a small child and thinking that, well, maybe I can control her more, because I can threaten the child,” MacVeigh said.\n\n“What do you think the suspect's motive was?” Bente asked.\n\n“It’s control. I think it was something with women, something with the power. If this was just a robbery motive, he wouldn't have gone to the extremes of tying her up and blindfolding or driving around,” MacVeigh replied.\n\nAugust 7, 2007, was a Tuesday. Jane Doe and her 2-year-old son were leaving the mall and had gotten into their SUV in the Nordstrom parking garage when a man slipped into her backseat. He pointed a gun and demanded she take him to an . She drove to a Bank of America.\n\nThe machine only let her take out $600. The suspect forced Jane Doe back into her vehicle. Oddly, the man seemed to have a degree of sympathy for his hostages.\n\nSee also:\n\n“He parks and basically tells her, ‘Look, you're going to be here for a while. Do you need some water? Does your son need some water?’ He was very compassionate toward the son,” MacVeigh said.\n\nThen it appeared the suspect didn’t know what to do next. They switched seats, and he got behind the wheel. They drove onto Florida’s Turnpike, northbound. He used Jane’s SunPass, and she had no idea where they were going. But they didn’t get far. They exited at Atlantic in Delray and then drove south again, back to the mall.\n\nThat’s where something seemingly miraculous happened. In a parking spot near Bloomingdale's, the gunman decided he was going to let Jane and her little boy go. He zip-tied Jane to the seat, put blacked-out swim goggles over her eyes, and toy handcuffs around her wrists.\n\n“Just before he leaves, he explains her, like, look, don't get out of the car. I have your driver's license. I know where you live. If you call the police, tell them I'm a short, fat black man. And he basically leaves at that point,” MacVeigh said.\n\nJane Doe wiggled free of her bounds, ran to the valet stand at Saks, and they called the police.\n\nLater, when cops talked to Jane Doe, they released a sketch of the suspect.\n\n“I mean, it looks like it could really be anyone,” Bente said.\n\n“The problem is you have to think that the top half the head is totally unknown, dude, the glasses and the hat,” MacVeigh said. “I mean, if I pulled your hair back and put a hat and glasses on you, you could be it. I could be it.”\n\nSeventeen years later, a new documentary series, \"Under the Radar,\" suggests that Peter Mangs, a Swedish serial killer known for his racially motivated crimes in Europe, is behind the Jane Doe kidnapping.\n\nWhile he’s currently serving a life sentence in Sweden for a killing spree, the series claims he was visiting family in 2007. His father still lives in Boca Raton.\n\n“Had you ever heard of Peter Mangs prior to this documentary?” Bente asked.\n\n“No, no. No. I think it was a great injustice to the victims because you they left so much. You know, I was waiting for the aha moment,” MacVeigh replied. “From what I was just recently told was that they determined that the guy from Sweden, that's the Swedish killer, was not in the country at the time, even though they implied he was.”\n\nThe has been in touch with the filmmakers. They say they have evidence Peter Mangs was using multiple passports and claim that investigators are mistaken about the dates.\n\nSee also:\n\nFrom prison, Mangs has been writing letters to a Swedish producer and writing music full of clues and codes about unsolved cases in Florida.\n\nThere are intriguing scraps of information, even photos of Mangs at the mall, but there’s no solid evidence he was the gunman who held up Jane Doe.\n\n“Could there have been any DNA left over that could now help solve this cold case?” Bente asked.\n\n“The DNA world, and you know what, what they're doing now compared to what they did 30 years ago, is drastically different. But again, you have mixtures, and when you get mixtures of DNA, it's so hard for the serologist to identify a person from it,” MacVeigh replied.\n\nIn our area, many people believe Jane Doe was targeted by the same man who killed and . The Gorenberg case was five months before Jane Doe, and the Bochicchio case was four months afterward.\n\nJust like Jane Doe, the suspect abducted his victims at Town Center Mall and made them drive to a bank to withdraw cash. With the Bochicchio’s, there was a pair of blacked-out swim goggles.\n\nFor whatever reason, Jane Doe and her son were not killed. But in the other cases, armed robbery escalated to murder.\n\nThe community has been on edge all this time and eager for a break in any of the cases.\n\n“So about late 2008, 2009 we took a more proactive approach on the request from the state attorney's office to investigate it. We basically started from scratch to go back over the case, go over the leads, go over the evidence, determine what we had, what we didn't,” MacVeigh said.\n\nBut that task force disbanded. Officials say there was nothing to link the three crimes.\n\nRandi Gorenberg was driven from the mall to a park in unincorporated Palm Beach County and shot there, which is why her death is a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office case.\n\nJane Doe and the Bochicchio cases belong to the Boca Raton Police Department because the mall is located within the city limits of Boca Raton.\n\nNeither agency would appear on camera for this report.\n\n“Is there anything that detectives could do to move this case forward? Is there any next step that could be possible now?” Bente asked.\n\n“You know, there's always possibilities. I mean, the good thing about this show coming out is it's giving notice to the people again,” MacVeigh replied. “That's what you want. You want the story not to die.”\n\nThere are multiple cash rewards being offered for tips leading to an arrest.\n\nAs for the documentary, the producers say they are still pressing law enforcement agencies to follow up on what they’ve uncovered."
