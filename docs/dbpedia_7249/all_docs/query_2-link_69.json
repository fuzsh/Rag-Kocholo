        "text": "Just DanceLady Gaga\n\n\"Just Dance\" was Lady Gaga's first hit, and it also brought the techno-synth sound that had been popular in Europe for the previous decade to the United States.\n\nThe BestTina Turner\n\n\"The Best\" by Tina Turner was originally recorded by Bonnie Tyler; Turner's hit version added a bridge and a saxophone solo by Edgar Winter.\n\nTake On Mea-ha\n\n\"Take On Me\" was just a minor hit in Norway until a new version was released with the iconic video, making it a global smash.\n\nAfricaToto\n\nA key line in \"Africa\" is \"I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become,\" which is about drifting away from what you really want in life. Toto keyboard player David Paich, who wrote the song, felt his work was consuming him.\n\nBootyliciousDestiny's Child\n\nIn 2004, the word \"Bootylicious\" made the Oxford English Dictionary, three years after the Destiny's Child song was released. Definition: \"Blend of booty buttocks and delicious.\"\n\nZakk WyldeSongwriter Interviews\n\nWhen he was playing Ozzfest with Black Label Society, a kid told Zakk he was the best Ozzy guitarist - Zakk had to correct him.\n\nJanis IanSongwriter Interviews\n\nOne of the first successful female singer-songwriters, Janis had her first hit in 1967 at age 15.\n\nIncongruent Opening ActsSong Writing\n\nHere's what happens when an opening act is really out of place with the headliner, like when Beastie Boys opened for Madonna."
