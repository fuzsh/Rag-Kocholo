I attended because I think Jim’s work is remarkable. I love sharing his recorded music in preschool and school age storytimes at my library and recommend it wholeheartedly to parents and anyone working with young children. Jim’s songs are full of inventive word play, fresh and unexpected rhymes and playful prompts for children to join in the active fun. Both children and adults (including a legion of children’s librarians!) delight in Jim’s exuberantly silly songs.\n\nJim is an early childhood specialist, with a graduate degree in child development with an emphasis on play. He has created 6 albums, many of which are ALA Notable Children’s Recordings, including his newest, Jim Gill Presents Music Play for Folks of All Stripes.\n\nHe’s also written 2 delightful pictures books — the latest is A Soup Opera, a zany sing-along with CD, also an ALA Notable Children’s Recording (and fantastic material for a skit or puppet show!)\n\nLike Jim’s music, which features a host of musical styles and accomplished musicianship, his workshop was interactive and lively. What a treat to sing and dance with him to many of my favorite Jim Gill songs: Stick to the Glue, Knuckles Knees, Beethoven’s Five Finger Play, and of course, The Silly Dance Contest! We also saw, via video, children and adults playing together to two of his newest songs, the ingenious Truck Stop and Foot Notes.\n\nBesides the exhilaration of doing “the curl,” “the twirl,” “the hide” and “the slide” with Jim and a ballroom full of (really nice!) teachers (when we cut a rug to the List of Dances), here are my key takeaways from Jim’s workshop:\n\nSharing playful music with children and their caregivers — music with an element of a game, creative dramatics, word play, etc. — gives the adult and child an opportunity to play together. This is bonding and also provides many educational benefits for the child.\n\nWhen an adult joins in a child’s play, the play automatically becomes more sophisticated. Children are constantly learning from the subtle cues of adults.\n\nChildren develop skills vital to early literacy, such as phonological awareness, through active engagement in word play and rhyming games.\n\nYoung children become more engaged in these early literacy “building blocks” when the word play is combined with physical movement and active play.\n\nMusic play fosters broad listening skills — for instance, listening for the next chance to jump in a song like Jump Up, Turn Around. This primes the child for more demanding listening, such as anticipating words that rhyme.\n\nMusic play can help a child practice self-regulation, as in the song Can’t Wait to Celebrate, where there is an extended “freeze” before the child can cut loose and move. Current research is showing that, perhaps more than any other single ability, self-control is key to school success.\n\nJim starts with a game (many resulting from his lifelong work with families who have children with special needs) and then crafts a song around it. He sees music not as something for children and adults to consume, but as something for them to participate in.\n\nHis goal is for the play to continue at home.\n\nI was absolutely inspired by Jim’s creativity and passion for his work. He spent most of his presentation, literally, on his toes, he was so eager to share his message (which he later told me he does unconsciously when he’s excited). In fact, he reminded me of these words from Fred Rogers: “The thing I remember best about successful people I’ve met all through the years is their obvious delight in what they’re doing… They just love what they’re doing, and they love it in front of others.”\n\nAlthough I would never, ever give up the pleasure of dancing and giggling with a storytime group to Jim’s marvelous recorded music, since attending his workshop I’ve been inspired to share a few of his songs a cappella. “Songs where you don’t need any musical instrument, you just sing with the children, that’s when children use language and sing along the most,” he says. Two songs that are natural choices for simply singing and creating the rhythm with snapping fingers or stamping feet are Alabama, Mississippi and Hands are for Clapping. The possibilities for utilizing his wonderfully playful songs in programs seem nearly endless!\n\nWhat are your favorite ways to promote music play at your library?\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nOur guest blogger today is Sharon McClintock.
