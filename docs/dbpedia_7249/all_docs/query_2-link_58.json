        "text": "Chart Performance: Pop (#2), R&B (#6), and Dance (#11); 1990\n\nStory Behind The Song By Ed Osborne\n\nBorn in Scarborough, Ontario, Jane Child’s classical piano-playing mother taught her to sing, and her father – also classically trained – taught her to play the violin.\n\nBy age 12, Jane was singing in the Canadian Children’s Opera Company, and soon after studying at the Royal Conservatory of Music. Jane was well on her way to being a concert pianist when, at 15, she answered a summer job ad for a rock ‘n’ roll keyboard player.\n\nThe Royal Conservatory became history when Jane joined Summerhill, and spent the next year playing the dumps-and-dives circuit. By 1988 she was making the rounds with demo tape in hand.\n\nHer triple-threat ability to write, perform, and produce music impressed Warner Brothers so much, VP of A&R Mo Ostin gave Jane free rein in crafting her debut album. In mid-April, 1990, her single of Don’t Wanna Fall In Love began a three week stay at #2 on the pop chart, and hit #1 in radio airplay.\n\nThis content and all Song Meaning articles were created and written by Top 40 Contributing Editor Ed Osborne. © 2024 Ed Osborne.
