        "text": "Galusha Pennypacker was a second cousin to Samuel W. Pennypacker. They shared the same great-grandparents, Matthias and Mary Custer Pannebecker. Samuel wrote in his autobiography, When I was a child about seven years of age, my father one day took me to a house on Nutt’s Road on the north side about a half mile from Phoenixville and within a short distance of the Corner Stores. In the house was a modest, diffident boy, perhaps a little larger than myself. My father said to me: “Sam, this is your cousin, Galusha Pennypacker,” and we played together in the yard.\n\nGalusha was the son of Joseph J. and Tamson Workizer Pennypacker. There have always been discrepancies of his birthdate. Galusha wrote to Samuel on October 6, 1871, I was born at Valley Forge- passed but a few years of my life with my Grandfather, near Phoenixville. Was born on the farm owned by my mother at V.F., June 1st 1841. Since in Philadelphia, until my mother’s decease. Only child she had. {Some of my people say I was born in 1842 a year later). In 1838, Tamson inherited the farm owned by her father which was the house used by Baron von Steuben during the Valley Forge encampment. She was described as a very beautiful, intelligent, educated woman. She married Joseph Pennypacker on May 7, 1839. Galusha’s mother named him for the Baptist missionary, Elon Galusha.\n\nJoseph moved the family to Philadelphia where he operated a merchandise store. Tamson died on January 8, 1846 from smallpox. Shortly after her funeral, Joseph closed the store and left Galusha to live with his grandparents Joseph and Elizabeth Funk Pennypacker and Joseph left for California. The war with Mexico broke out in May of 1846, and Joseph served as an Aide-de-Camp on the staff of General William J. Worth. Galusha’s grandfather was against the war with Mexico and unhappy that his son was a part of it. After the war, Galusha’s father went to San Francisco and operated a newspaper.\n\nGalusha’s grandfather died in 1852, and his grandmother at age 73, along with his Aunt Elizabeth, raised him. When Elizabeth married in 1856, Galusha and his grandmother went to live with her eldest son Elijah Funk Pennypacker. Elijah was a member of the Pennsylvania legislature from 1831 to 1835 and member of the Canal Board. He supported Thaddeus Stevens with the highly controversial Free Public School Act of 1834. Elijah served as the surveyor for Phoenixville and as the president of the Iron Bank of Phoenixville. Elijah’s Whitehorse Farm served as a station on the Underground Railroad. Elijah’s nine children were all younger than Galusha.\n\nSamuel described Elijah in his autobiography, A mile away, at the Corner Stores, Elijah F. Pennypacker, a Quaker, six feet four inches in height and straight as an arrow, at one time president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, had a station on the Underground Railroad and when, as occasionally happened, an unknown negro was met wending his way northward, he was bidden “Godspeed.”\n\nElijah wrote to William Still, the Chairman of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society, on November 7, 1857, Respected Friend- There are three colored friends at my house now, who will reach the city by the Phil. & Reading train this evening. Please meet them. Thine, &c., E.F. Pennypacker We have within the past 2 mos. Passed 43 through our hands, transported most of them to Norristown in our own conveyance. E.F.P.\n\nGalusha was educated in the private schools of Phoenixville and Schuylkill Township including the one held in the Old Friends Meeting House. He went to work for the Chester County Times newspaper in West Chester in 1859. In 1860, he wrote to Dr. Isaac I. Hayes of Philadelphia about joining his arctic expedition which mapped Ellesmere Island. It appears Galusha was looking for an adventure.\n\nWhen President Abraham Lincoln issued his first call for troops, Galusha joined the 9th PA, a ninety-day regiment, on April 22, 1861. He was elected a lieutenant, but felt he was too young to serve in that capacity, and served as the unit’s quartermaster sergeant instead. At the expiration of the 9th PA, Pennypacker recruited a company for the 97th PA and was commissioned captain for Company A. On October 7, 1861, he was promoted to major. The Regiment left West Chester for Washington on November 16th. From Washington, the 97th PA was sent to Fortress Monroe, Virginia five days later. On December 8th, 1861 they were ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina.\n\nThe 97th PA took part on the siege on Fort Pulaski outside Savannah, Georgia, on February 7, 1862. Fort Pulaski was built with five-foot-thick brick walls and described as strong as the Rocky Mountains. This was a combined naval and army assault to take the fort that guarded Savannah harbor, thus strengthening the Union blockade. The Union Navy landed new 30-pound rifled Parrot cannons near the fort. The fort surrendered after one day’s bombardment.\n\nThe 97th PA took part in the occupation of Fort Clinch, Jacksonville, Florida and Fernandina, Florida. On June 10, 1862 they participated in the Battle of Grimball’s Station, South Carolina and on June 16, 1862, the Battle of Secessionville, James’ Island, South Carolina.\n\nFort Wagner on Morris Island covered the southern approach to Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The first attack on July 11, 1863 had Union losses at 339 to 12 for the Confederates. A second attack on July 18, is well known for the charge made by the 54th Massachusetts, a black regiment. The 97th PA served in reserve for this failed attack and were ordered to remove the wounded from the field while taking fire from the fort. Isaiah Price in his History of the Ninety-Seventh Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, during the War of the Rebellion, 1861-65 wrote, During the night, the enemy threw shot and shell continually over the ground where the men were seeking for the wounded, but no casualties occurred. The firing, however, so seriously frightened the ambulance drivers as to cause them to start off their teams at a run as soon as their load of wounded soldiers was ready, regardless of the piercing cries of the poor sufferers. This was summarily and effectually stopped by sending an armed guard with each wagon, with orders to shoot the driver if he drove out of a walk. The Confederates abandoned the Fort on September 6th.\n\nOn October 2, 1863, the 97th PA was sent again to Fernandina, Florida. Fernandina served as the railhead for the longest railroad in that state. In February of 1864, they took part in the expedition with the Navy schooner “Para” against Woodstock Mills and captured a million and a half feet of lumber, accomplishing their objective of cutting off supplies coming from Florida.\n\nOn April 23, 1864, the 97th PA was sent to Fortress Monroe to join the tenth corps and engaged in the Battle of Green Plains on May 20, 1864. The advance line was broken, therefore leaving a gap which the Confederates quickly filled. Pennypacker was in reserve with 300 men of the 97th and was ordered to advance in order to recapture the line. After recapturing the line, Pennypacker was ordered to charge the right of the rebel lines being told the center was already taken. Colonel Guss wrote, The major was in command and gallantly led the van. I saw every move they made. His word to them was, ‘Now boys, we charge and I will go first,’ and away they went with cheers. Within one hundred yards, the rebels opened with a murderous fire. The entire Union line was outnumbered 10 to 1. Pennypacker was wounded severely in the right arm, got back up, wounded in the left leg, got back up and was wounded a third time in the right side and was forced to retire. This charge got compared to the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaklava during the Crimean War. The 97th PA Regiment suffered 184 casualties with 44 men killed, 8 officers wounded, 120 men wounded and 12 men were taken prisoner. Pennypacker was sent to recuperate at Fortress Monroe, and later was sent home to West Chester.\n\nPennypacker returned to the regiment on August 12, 1864 and was appointed Lt. Colonel on August 13th and promoted to Colonel on August 15th in command of the entire regiment. In September, he commanded the brigade. Galusha stated to his Uncle Uriah that his duties have been quadriplicated. The 97th PA took part of the siege on Petersburg, Virginia. On September 28, 1864, at Fort Gilmer, Pennypacker’s horse was shot from underneath him, with him taking a wound to the ankle.\n\nFort Fisher, located on the peninsula of the Atlantic Ocean and Cape Fear River, guarded the approach to Wilmington, North Carolina, the last Confederate seaport. On January 15, 1865, a combined naval and land assault took place. Fort Fisher was an earthen fort with 16 traverses before reaching the inner part of the Fort. Major General Adelbert Ames’ Division was to take the fort. His first brigade commanded by Brevet Brigadier General Newton M. Curtis entered first and when it stalled, Pennypacker lead the second brigade which carried the division into the fort. The color bearer for the 97th PA was shot down and Pennypacker picked up the flag, leading the regiment and brigade over the third traverse. While planting the colors on the third traverse, Pennypacker was severely wounded in the thigh and pelvis. The three brigade commanders that entered the fort were all shot down in the attack and coffins were ordered for them. Colonel Louis Bell, in command of the third brigade died, however Curtis and Pennypacker recovered from their wounds. Curtis and Pennypacker were both hailed as the Hero of Fort Fisher. Pennypacker responded to the editor of the New York Times on December 20, 1914, As to the “Hero of Fort Fisher:” There were several of them- a good many of them. – The men who carried the muskets! The capture of Fort Fisher closed the last seaport to the Confederacy and in a few months the war would be over.\n\nGalusha spent more than a year recuperating from his wounds at Fortress Monroe and came home to West Chester on November 11, 1865 to much fanfare. He resigned his commission on April 30, 1866. With the reduction of the military, Pennsylvania was granted a colonelcy in the Regular Army and Galusha accepted it on December 1, 1866. He served in the South during Reconstruction, being adored by the people in Nashville, Mississippi and New Orleans before transferring to Fort Riley, Kansas. He retired from the military in 1883. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1891, for his service at Fort Fisher.\n\nSamuel and Galusha had corresponded throughout their lifetimes and passed away just a month apart in 1916.\n\nAfter Galusha retired, he presented Samuel with several items from his career. These items are part of the collections at Pennypacker Mills and are put on display from time to time, particularly during the annual Civil War Event, which occurs on the first weekend of June.\n\nReprinted with permission from the Pennypacker Express, Volume MMXV, No. 1, January -February 2015."
