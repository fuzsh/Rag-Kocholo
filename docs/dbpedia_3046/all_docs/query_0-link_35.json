        "text": "On May 7, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant issues orders for the Army of the Potomac to march toward Spotsylvania Court House, a small village where the Brock Road meets the road to Fredericksburg. Grant hopes to get between Gen. Robert E. Lee's army and Richmond or, at the very least, to draw the Confederates into the open where he can take advantage of superior Union numbers. It is Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's job to prevent the Federals from reaching Spotsylvania. For two days, a division of Stuart's cavalry, led by Fitzhugh Lee, battles Union horsemen for control of the Brock Road. Forced to relinquish his position near Todd's Tavern, Lee withdraws to a rise of ground known as Laurel Hill, on the south side of the Brock Road, on May 8. Laurel Hill is the last defensible position north of Spotsylvania: if the Confederates lose the hill, they will also lose the crossroads at the courthouse.\n\nFortunately for Stuart and Fitzhugh Lee, Maj. Gen. Richard Anderson reaches Spotsylvania by the morning of May 8 and is within two miles of Laurel Hill. Anderson's corps is going into bivouac near the Po River when one of Stuart's couriers arrives to warn him of the Union army's approach. The new corps commander instantly puts his troops back on the road and leads them toward Laurel Hill.\n\nForces Engaged\n\n152,000\n\nUnion\n\n100,000\n\nConfed.\n\n52,000\n\nMay 8. Believing Spotsylvania to be within his grasp, Union Maj. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren advances his Fifth Corps up to the hill where they are surprised to find Anderson's corps opposing them. Warren's attempts to drive back the Confederates are rebuffed with heavy losses and the two sides begin to entrench. During this fight, Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick, commander of the Union Sixth Corps, is shot dead, becoming the highest-ranking Union officer killed during the war.\n\nMay 9–10. Grant tries to break the deadlock at Spotsylvania over the next two days. On May 9, he sends a portion of Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's Second Corps across the Po River to find Lee's left flank. Spying Hancock's move, Lee shifts two divisions to counter the Federals at Block House Bridge, forcing the Yankees back across the river. Grant spends May 10 probing Lee's line for weaknesses, and nearly finds one, when a young colonel named Emory Upton briefly breaches the Confederate line with a tightly packed, fast-moving column of 12 regiments. Though Upton's assault is indecisive, it gives Grant an idea.\n\nMay 12. The Confederates have established a long line of earthworks, which includes a huge half-mile bulge, or salient, called the “mule shoe” because of its shape. Following up on Upton's attack, Grant masses 20,000 men of the Second Corps opposite the tip of the salient. Lee notes the Federal movement, but mistakenly believes that Grant is preparing to withdraw and removes his artillery from the area. So, when Hancock's men advance, on the morning of May 12, they strike the Confederate line where only infantry remain. After an initial breakthrough, Lee shifts reinforcements into the salient just as Grant hurls more troops at the Confederate works. Fighting devolves into a horrific, hand-to-hand, struggle—amid a torrential downpour. It lasts for 22 hours and claims roughly 17,000 casualties. The area is known thereafter as the Bloody Angle.\n\nThe stubborn stand by Confederates at the Bloody Angle gives Lee the time he needs to construct a new line of earthworks across the base of the salient. The Army of the Potomac, exhausted from its attacks, does not test the new line—at least, not right away. Instead, Grant slides his army to the left, followed by Lee sliding to his right. For three days, both sides consolidate their new lines.\n\nMay 18. Grant’s forces attack Lee’s new position early in the day and are met by massed artillery fire and easily repulsed. Stymied but undaunted, Grant calls off the attack.\n\nMay 19. Believing it best to continue moving his army to the southeast, Grant orders Hancock to pull back the Second Corps toward the Fredericksburg Road. Observing the movement, Lee sends Richard S. Ewell’s Second Corps forward as a reconnaissance force to determine where the Federals are going. Ewell’s men run into stiff resistance by a brigade of new heavy artillery-turned-infantry regiments at the Harris family farm.\n\nMay 20–21. In the evening, both sides pull out of their Spotsylvania defenses and move south and east toward the North Anna River."
