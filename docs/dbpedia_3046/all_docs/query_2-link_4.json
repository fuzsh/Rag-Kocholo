ROBINSON,\n\nLATE COLONEL COMMANDING\n\nAND DELIVERED BY HIM AT THE REGIMENTAL REUNION HELD AT\n\nOSWEGO FALLS, OSWEGO COUNTY, NEW YORK\n\nJUNE 5, 1895\n\n[NOTE TO THE READER]\n\nThe following is a transcription of Wardwell G. Robinson’s speech at the 1895 Reunion of the 184th NY Volunteer Infantry that was subsequently published.\n\nMy great / great Grandfather, William McGrath (enrolled as William McGraw) was a private in “D” Company under the command of Captain Sylvester E. Town. He participated in the Battle of Cedar Creek where he received injuries to his leg and back during the counterattack on Early’s troops. The injuries were not recorded at the time but for which he later received a pension.\n\nI have annotated the text to give the reader a better understanding of the people, places and events referenced in this document as well as appended additional materials for a greater appreciation of the history of this unit.\n\nThis compilation of documents relative to the actions of the 184th is dedicated to their sacred memory and the sacred memory of the 24th NY Volunteer Infantry, 81st Volunteer Infantry, 110th Volunteer Infantry, 147th NY Volunteer Infantry, 24th NY Cavalry, 21st NY Light Artillery, and all the other soldiers and sailors from Oswego, New York who sacrificed their blood, sweat, tears and lives for the preservation of the Union and the freedom of all men and women in this country.\n\nThe text is divided so as to show what appeared on the respective page of the original text.\n\nTHOMAS J. EBERT\n\nCLOVIS CA\n\nSEPTEMBER 6, 2006\n\nAN HISTORICAL ADDRESS.\n\nFellow soldiers and Gentlemen of the\n\nOne Hundred and Eighty-fourth Regiment\n\nOf New York State Infantry Volunteers\n\nPursuant and in obedience to a resolution passed at a reunion of the survivors of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Regiment held at Pulaski in June, 1893, whereby I was requested to prepare and present to your body a history of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Regiment [1] during the late civil war, I have the honor to present and submit the following paper.\n\nIn the outset I may be permitted to state that in the preparation of this paper I have been seriously hampered and embarrassed by the fact that for a time the regiment was separated or divided, and the further fact that I am unable to speak from a personal knowledge as to matters connected with what is known as the “Four Companies,” or the “Shenandoah Valley Companies,” also the further fact that the history of the regiment necessitates a two-fold history down to the point when the regiment became united in one organization in fact. These several facts to a great extent interfere with and mar the unity of the history.\n\nI beg leave to return my sincere thanks to Mr. Amos Youmans, of Fulton, N. Y.; to Mr. Squires, of New Haven, N. Y. and to Mr. M. V. Wadleigh, of Oswego, N. Y., for valuable data and assistance rendered me in the preparation of this paper, so far as the four companies are concerned; and to D. P. Morehouse, Esq. [2] of Oswego, N. Y., for a substantial copy of the names of the officers and privates appearing upon the muster-in rolls of the regiment, which are hereto attached, marked “Appendix A.”\n\nI am unable to narrate the many sad, pathetic, and humorous incidents connected with the regiment --- the camp songs and stories sung and told in camp, on the march, and on the picket line. They must be and are left to your individual recollections, to be remembered when calling to mind this portion of your life’s history, and to be repeated at the fireside to children and friends, as also rehearsed at Grand Army post camp-fires.\n\nThe moving causes of the civil war have become matters of history, and to rehearse them at this time would be inappropriate. I may, however, venture to say that in my judgment such causes were three in number:\n\n1. The jealousy on the part of the South, occasioned by the overshadowing political importance, wealth, and prosperity of the North, West and Northwest,\n\n2. The doctrine of States’ rights, or the reserved powers [3] of the several States not granted to the General Government; and\n\n3. The question of slavery.\n\nThe second and third causes or questions have been practically settled by the civil war. The first cause remains to some extent, but is rapidly being adjusted by the advancing prosperity of the South.\n\nThe progress of the war in the year 1863 and the early part of 1864 had been disastrous and barren of results to the Federal Government and army; the country at large, which was favorable to the Federal Government, was filled with consternation; the sympathizers at the North with the secessionists were outspoken in their predictions as the triumphant success of secession, and were giving all aid in their power to those engaged in destroying the unity of the United States; Canadian lake ports were filled with those plotting the dismemberment of the country. There was a feeling of deep gloom overspreading the whole loyal North; not a city, and hardly a village, town, or school district in this State but that had maimed and wounded exemplars of the fact that a sanguinary war was raging. The North had already contributed freely in men, money, and material, and the end was not yet. The “On-to-Richmond!” cry had ceased to delude the most sanguine, and the oft-repeated saying, “The war won’t last ninety days,” no longer found believers; on the contrary, it was everywhere and by every one recognized that the Republic was battling for its very existence.\n\nOswego County [4], in proportion to its population and size, had already contributed its quota, and even more than its quota, towards sustaining the burden of the war. How well Oswego County bore its burden is shown by the fact that it furnished in round numbers five thousand men in excess of its quota --- the quota being some seven thousand five hundred, while it furnished about twelve thousand five hundred men. In addition to raising five regiments --- the Twenty-fourth, Eighty-first, One Hundred and Tenth, One Hundred and Forty-seventh, and One Hundred and Eighty-fourth --- it furnished men to the following named organizations, viz.: Cavalry Regiments --- Seventh, Eleventh, Twelfth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-fourth, and First Veteran. Artillery Regiments --- Batteries F and G, First; Battery M Second; Third, Fourth, Sixth, Ninth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Sixteenth; independent battery, Twenty-first,. Engineers Regiments --- First (new), Fiftieth. Infantry Regiments --- Nineteenth, Twenty-first, Twenty-third, Thirty-seventh, One Hundred and Forty-sixth, One Hundred Eighty-ninth, One Hundred Ninety-third.\n\nIt was under these gloomy and terrible circumstances and conditions, thus briefly and inadequately stated, that Oswego County, again responding to the proclamation of the later-on martyred President Lincoln, calling for five hundred thousand additional troops to serve for one year, and which proclamation was dated July 18, 1864, set about the enlistment of another regiment to be added to the other Oswego County regiments that had already gone to war, and from which regiments maimed and wounded men were continually returning home as leaves falling to the earth from trees smitten by the autumn frost.\n\nUnder the auspices and direction of the War Committee of the county, whose chairman was the late Hon. Elias Root, a series of so-called war meetings was held throughout the county to promote the enlistment of men for the proposed regiment. These meetings were addressed by, so far as I now recollect, Hon. Cheney Ames, Hon. Henry Fitzhugh, Dr. A. Van Dyke, Hon. A. B. Getty, Hon. D. G. Fort, and others whose names I do not now call to mind. [5] The recruiting and formation of the regiment was authorized by Hon. Horatio Seymour, [6] Governor of this State, on the personal application of Hon. Elias Root as chairman of the War Committee of the County of Oswego. It is my recollection that these so-called war meetings did not continue for a time longer than from ten days to two weeks, for recruiting and enlistments proceeded rapidly and the number of men necessary to fill the regiment was soon obtained; in fact, there were some fourteen hundred men and over recruited for the regiment from Oswego County alone, and some two hundred and over from Madison and Cayuga counties. This excess of men went into and formed part of other organizations that were at this time in process of formation throughout the State. [7]\n\nThe companies of the regiment when recruited and enlisted, were clothed, mustered, and sent forward to Elmira, N. Y., the general rendezvous, by A. L. Scott, Esq. then Provost Marshal at the City of Oswego. Companies A, B, D and F were forwarded from Oswego to Elmira on the dates following: Company A, August 30th; Company B, August 31st; Companies D and F, September 5th. They remained at Elmira until on or about September 13, 1864, when they were forwarded to Washington, D. C. by General Devins, then in command at Elmira. The remaining companies of the regiment (C, E, G, H, I, and K) were on or about the 14th Day of September, 1864, clothed, mustered and sent forward to Elmira by Provost-Marshal Scott, where such companies remained until on or about the 16th day of September, 1864, when they were sent forward by General Devins, via Baltimore, to the Army of the James [8] at Bermuda Hundred, [9] near City Point, a place then and later on a very important point so far as the Federal forces were concerned, as it was the base of supplies for the armies then operating in front of Richmond, Petersburg, and points farther south, and at which pace an immense amount of army supplies of all kinds was gathered.\n\nSo great at this time (in 1864) was the need of men at the front, that the United States authorities, without waiting for the arrival of the six companies at Elmira, despatched, as I have stated, the four companies to Washington, [10] and, without waiting for the arrival and muster-in of the field and staff, despatched the six companies to Bermuda Hundred as above stated; in fact, every available man was sent to the front as rapidly as possible all over the country, and when regiments were not complete, companies and even detachments were forwarded to the front. It will be remembered that in the case of the Twenty-fourth, Eight-first, One Hundred and Tenth, and One Hundred and Forty –seventh regiments they each went to the seat of war as complete organizations, fully equipped, etc.\n\nI have always attributed, and at this time attribute, the comparatively small loss the One Hundred and Eighty Fourth Regiment sustained to the fact that the regiment was sent forward in detail as above mentioned. I never understood, and do not now understand, why the six companies should not have been ordered to join the four companies in the first instance. I can understand why, after the several portions of the regiment reached the front, a union could not readily be effected, growing out the fact that the commanding officer of whichever part of the army to which a portion of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth was attached would be averse to letting go such portion, or to diminishing his command by losing such a substantial body of men. I know that from the moment I was mustered in I was constant, in season and out of season, in using every effort in my power to effect the union of the several portions of the regiment. I at once upon my muster-in and even before that, called the attention of General Devins at Elmira to the unpleasant and unfortunate condition of affairs, and was assured by him that as soon as the field and staff reached the front this unfortunate state of affairs would at once be remedied. However, \"Man proposes, God disposes,\" and today I am satisfied that to the condition of affairs above mentioned, and for which none of us were or are responsible, we owe, by the favor of Heaven, the immunity of the regiment from greater loss and disaster.\n\nOn Friday, the 16th day of September, 1864 at Elmira, N.Y., and at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of that day, the writer, as Colonel, William D. Ferguson, as Major, and Howard M. Smith, as Adjutant, were severally mustered into the service of the United States. At 5 o'clock of the same day Major Ferguson, by order left Elmira, destined for Washington, to join the four companies and to take command thereof; and on the same day Adjutant Smith, by like order, left Elmira to join the six companies already sent forward to City Point. The writer, accompanied by Hon. Elias Root, left for Albany to attend to regimental business at the Adjutant-General's office of the State of New York.\n\nOn the 22nd day of September, 1864, at Elmira, N.Y., William P. McKinley, as Lieutenant-Colonel, and John Dunn, Jr. , as Quartermaster, were mustered into the service of the United States as of September 16, 1864.\n\nThe regiment thus organized, mustered, and enrolled, consisted of the following named field, staff and line officers:\n\nWardwell G. Robinson, [11] Colonel, enrolled by Governor Seymour; mustered September 16th, by Lieut. W.G. Fitch , [12] U.S.A.\n\nWilliam P. McKinley, Lieutenant-Colonel, enrolled by Governor Seymour; mustered September 16th, by Lieut. W.G. Fitch, U.S.A.\n\nWilliam D.

Smith; mustered November 1st, by Capt. Smith.\n\nJacob Post, Chaplain, enrolled at Harrison's Landing by W.G. Robinson; mustered December 31, by Lieut. L.H. Brown, A.C.M.\n\nCompany A – Joel S. Palmer, Captain; Cheever P. Strong, First Lieutenant; Marquis L. Branch, Second Lieutenant. Officers mustered at Elmira September 12, 1864. Ninety three- enlisted men, mustered between July 29 and September 4, 1864.\n\nCompany B – William S. Morse Captain; James H. Root, First Lieutenant; Charles H. Peavy, Second Lieutenant. Officers mustered at Elmira, September 16, 1864. Ninety-eight enlisted men, mustered between August 13 and September 1, 1864.\n\nCompany C – James W. Parkhurst, Captain; George A. Leonard, First Lieutenant; David Bothwell, Second Lieutenant. Officers mustered at Elmira, September 16, 1864. Ninety eight enlisted men, mustered between August 13 and September 1, 1864.\n\nCompany D – Sylvester R. Town, Captain; Augustus Phillips, First Lieutenant; Joel H. Warn, Second Lieutenant. Captain mustered at Elmira, September 14, First and Second Lieutenants, September 12, 1864. Eighty-five enlisted men, mustered between August 15 and September 1, 1864.\n\nCompany E – John Sheridan, Captain; John W. Francis, first Lieutenant; James H. Loomis, Second Lieutenant. Officers mustered at Elmira, September 12, 1864. Ninety-eight enlisted men, mustered between August 17 and September 5, 1864.\n\nCompany G. – James T. Outerson, Captain; Joseph H. Grant, First Lieutenant; Thomas W. Smith, Second Lieutenant, Officers mustered at Elmira, September 15, 1864. Ninety six enlisted men, mustered between August 19 and September 2, 1864.\n\nCompany H – Henry W. Ramsay, Captain; George W. Woodin, First Lieutenant; Thomas M. Watkins, Second Lieutenant. Officers mustered at Elmira, September 16, 1864. Ninety-eight enlisted men, mustered between August 20 and September 4, 1864.\n\nCompany I – George Wetmore, Captain; Edgar F. Morris, First Lieutenant; John H. Gilman, Second Lieutenant. Officers mustered at Elmira, September 16, 1864. Ninety-eight enlisted men, mustered between August 12 and September 5, 1864.\n\nCompany K. – Stephen J. Scriber, Captain; Merritt G. McCoon, First Lieutenant; no Second Lieutenant. Officers mustered at Elmira, September 15, 1864. Eighty-six enlisted men, mustered between August 22 and September 8, 1864. (Leonard S. Carter was afterward mustered as Second Lieutenant of Company K and Jerome H. Coe was promoted from Orderly Sergeant of Company K to First Lieutenant of same company, vice Merrit G. McCoon, resigned,).\n\nAfter the regiment was united, Sergeant M.V. Wadleigh, Company F, carried the National colors and Sergeant Burton Wheeler, Company C, the State colors.\n\nThe total of field staff, and line officers and enlisted men was nine hundred and fifty seven, according to the original muster-in rolls.\n\nOn the 23rd of September, 1864, the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, Quartermaster, Thomas G. Sinclair, Sutler, and James Raney, Sutler's clerk, left Elmira bound for City Point, via Baltimore and Fortress Monroe. Upon reaching City Point, it was learned that the regiment was encamped about two miles from Bermuda Hundred and about one or one and one-half miles for the front, and as was found, within hearing of the firing along the picket lines. The camp of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth was reached about 6 o'clock P.M. of the 26th day of September, 1864. It is the recollection of the writer that at this point and time Sutler Sinclair concluded not to go further, and somewhat later P.H. Ellis became Sutler of the Regiment.\n\nThe four companies [13] reached Washington at 10:30 P.M. of the 16th day of September, 1864, and remained at the Soldier's Rest in that city during that night. On the afternoon of the 17th of September, 1864, the men of the four companies marched to Fort Corcoran, on Arlington Heights, and remained at the fort for the following four days. Just where and when Major Ferguson joined the detachment is not entirely clear, but it must have been at the Soldier's Rest on the 16th of September or at Fort Corcoran on the 17th, for it seems to be reasonably clear and certain that the first company report made (that of Company A, Captain Palmer, Mr. Squires acting as company clerk), was made to Major Ferguson, as commander of the detachment, on Sunday morning, the 18th day of September, 1864.\n\nOn the 20th day of September, tents and rubber blankets were issued to the detachment. On the 21st, guns and accoutrements were issued. On the 22nd, forty rounds of ammunition were issued to each man, and on the same day the first dress parade of the detachment was had.\n\nOn the same or following day (September 23rd), the detachment was forwarded from Fort Corcoran by cars to Harper's Ferry, and, marching to Bolivar Heights, camped there until the 27th of September, when the detachment was assigned to and became a part of a provisional brigade commanded by Colonel Heine; [14] and on the same day, at about 3 o'clock P.M., the brigade struck tents and took up the line of march for Winchester, Va. [15] This provisional brigade was assigned to duty as a part of a guard to a supply train destined for General Sheridan's [16] army.\n\nOn the 28th of September the brigade and detachment went into camp a mile or two beyond and south of Winchester, the march being twenty-two miles. On the 29th of September the troops camped about three miles from Strasburg, or Fisher's Hill, a march of twenty-two miles. On September 30th the march was twenty five miles, to Mount Jackson, and on October 1st the march was about thirty-five miles to Harrisonburg, where the troops arrived at about midnight. During almost the entire march this day the troops were looking upon the unaccustomed sight of burning barns, houses, mills, and stacks of hay and straw that had been fired presumably by the Federal cavalry.\n\nOn Sunday, the 2nd of October, the day was passed in camp, and for part of the time the men of the detachment were engaged in scraping and beating the dried mud of the so-called \"sacred soil of Virginia\" from their clothes, and in scouring and removing the rust from their guns. No little part of the day was passed in cooking and eating fresh pork and mutton that had been obtained in generous quantities from the ample stores of the men connected with the wagon train, and which had been secured by judicious foraging in the enemy's country on the previous day's march. Song and jest were not wanting or unheard about the several camp-fires. Home and the loved ones were not forgotten, and from many went up the silent prayer to the Giver of all good, asking the blessings of Heaven to rest upon these so loved, upon the cause in which they were engaged, and upon themselves.\n\nOn the 3rd of October, 1864, the detachment started from Harrisonburg, destined for Winchester, having under escort a large number of white and colored refugees, some on foot and others in all sorts and descriptions of vehicles, also a number of Confederate prisoners and a large drove or herd of captured sheep, horses and cattle. At night of that day the detachment camped near New Market.\n\nOn the 4th of October the march was resumed, and the same night camped near Woodstock. On the 5th of October the march was continued, the detachment camping that night about eight miles from Winchester.\n\nDuring the week from October 5th to October 12th the detachment was engaged in marching to, remaining at, and marching from Martinsburg to Winchester.\n\nOn the 12th of October the detachment marched from Winchester to Newtown and camped for the night, and the next day marched to Front Royal and camped for the night.\n\nIt was at or about this time that the detachment was attached to and became a part of the First Brigade, Third Division of the Sixth Army Corps.\n\nOn the 14th day of October, 1864, the brigade left Front Royal, destined, as was supposed, for Petersburg, but after marching until in the afternoon, the column was countermarched, and later camped at Millwood.\n\nAt 3 o'clock A.M. of October 15th, the bugle call of \"Fall in!\" sounded; whereupon, after the column had been formed, a forced march of sixteen miles was made, through woods, fields, ditches, and over stone walls, to Newtown. Halting at that place for an hour, the column resumed its march to Middletown, and then through the fields to what was called and known as Cedar Creek camp, where it remained until the day of the battle hereinafter mentioned. While so camped, a detail was made of one hundred men from the detachment for picket duty, and this detail returned to camp on the 16th or 17th of October.\n\nOn the 19th of October 1864, occurred what is known as the battle of Cedar Creek, [17] and closely connected therewith is the famous ride of General Sheridan, so often told in story and sung in song. [18] I shall not attempt at this time to describe that battle. Suffice it to say that the Federal forces were at first driven from their encampment in confusion, through an attack made upon them at an early hour in the day by the Confederate forces, who were in superior numbers; that later in the day the Federal forces were rallied by General Sheridan, faced about, and making a gallant attack upon the Confederates, then flushed with victory, put them to utter rout. Taking everything into consideration, it was one of the most gallant and unique engagements of the war, and the memory of Sheridan's ride from Winchester to Cedar Creek on that memorable 19th of October, 1864 will long remain fresh and green in the annals of the civil war.\n\nThis battle of Cedar Creek was the first engagement in which the detachment participated, and wherein it received its baptism of fire. It can truthfully be said that it sustained its part well, and materially aided in the final triumphant repulse and defeat of the Confederates. In justly estimating and awarding to the detachment its fair and well-merited need of praise for its conduct on that occasion, it must be remembered that at the time of the engagement scarcely a month had elapsed wince the members of the detachment had been drawn from the peaceful avocations of home life, and had but little or no acquaintance with military drill, tactics or discipline.\n\nLieut. Augustus Phillips, of Company F, the acting Adjutant of the detachment, was severely wounded early in the engagement. Two privates (whose names I am unable to obtain) had started to remove him from the field of battle, but they had not proceeded far when he died, and at this time, the Confederates being on the advance and the Federals retiring, his body was left on the field of battle. After the battle was concluded the body was recovered, but it had been stripped of everything save a part of the underclothing. [19] I understand that Lieutenant Phillips was buried on the field of battle. [20] It is said that for a day or two preceding his death Lieutenant Phillips seemed to belaboring under a premonition of some disaster personal to himself.\n\nFrom the best information obtainable, the names of the enlisted men of the detachment killed at the battle of Cedar Creek are: Peter E. Eldred, of Company A [21]; Lester E. Wyburn of Company B [22]; Joseph Menway [23] and John Sabin of Company D [24] and John M. Wing, of Company F. [25] These five persons were buried on the field of battle. After the battle Private William H. Victory of Company A, was missing; he never returned to the detachment or the regiment, and his fate was never known.\n\nTo indicate the burial place of Peter E. Eldred, a marker or headboard was made from a part of a hardtack box and placed at the head of the grave, and his name, company, regiment, and when and where killed was carved thereon by Mr. Amos Youmans.\n\nThe following named enlisted men of Company A were wounded, viz: Andrew W. Fish, Richard Baker, Andrus L. Gilbert, Dwight Parkhurst, Henry Hale, George Baily, William Visgar, Franklin Collins, Tucker Woodson, John P. Coe, Aaron Stoughtenger.\n\nAndrew W. Fish [27] and Dwight Parkhurst [28] were sent to a hospital, where they died within about a month after the battle. After the battle Private Parkhurst was found lying on the field of battle, badly wounded through the hips; he had been nearly stripped of all his clothing by the Confederates. Men of other regiments found Mr. Parkhurst, who communicated the fact to the men of the detachment. The men who found Mr. Parkhurst had cared for him as best they could – had built a fire near him and had covered him with dry hides that had been left on the ground by the army butchers. The men of the detachment learning of Mr. Parkhurst's condition and whereabouts, Private Amos Youmans and three others proceeded to the place indicated, and, by means of a stretcher improvised from two pieces of fence-rail and a tent cloth, carried Mr. Parkhurst to a camp-fire of the detachment, and the next morning he was carried in an ambulance to the hospital.\n\nHenry Hale [29] was taken to a hospital, where he remained until sufficiently recovered to be sent to his home in Volney or Scriba, where he died shortly after his arrival.\n\nI am unable further to follow the ultimate fortunes of the other wounded men of company A above named. [30]\n\nThe following named enlisted men of Company B were wounded, viz.: James Allen, William Blackwood, John P. Kennedy, William J. Moore, Lewis Parmentier, George W. Reed, Matthias Strawback, Charles A. Wilks, Charles Woolson, Thomas M. Wood, Sergeant Daniel D. Hartigan, Sergeant Edwin Snyder, Corporal William P. Stevens, Corporal James Pearson.\n\nThe following named enlisted men of Company D were wounded, viz.: Charles D. Feriss, Joseph Flanagan, William Hewitt, Whitmore Percival [31], Dunham C. Shapley, Frederick Younglove, Sergeant Alfred Moran, Sergeant George G. Barber. Private John Sabin, of Company D, who was killed as heretofore stated, was shot while in close proximity to Sergeant M. V. Wadleigh.\n\nThe following named men of Company F were wounded, viz.: Willis E. Brunott, Joohn W. Budds, Job Babcock, James Lowden, David Marshall. Private James Allen of Company B [32], was removed from the field of battle to the field hospital, where he died from his wounds in a day or two after the battle. I am unable to state further as to the wounded men of Companies B, D, and F, above named.\n\nTo recapitualate, at the battle of Cedar Creek the detachment lost one officer and five enlisted men killed, thirty-eight enlisted men wounded, and one missing; making a total of forty-five killed, wounded and missing.\n\nAfter the battle had terminated, the detachment returned to the encampment from which it had been so unceremoniously driven in the early morning, and where it remained encamped until the 9th day of November, 1864. On that date it broke camp and marched to Camp Russell, near Winchester, where it remained, doing camp, guard, and picket duty, until the 3rd day of December, 1864, when it marched to Stephens Depot, a distance of about four miles from Winchester, and there embarked in cars for Washington, D.C., and reached its destination on the 4th of December 1864.\n\nWhile the detachment was a Camp Russell, Major Ferguson was taken sick and was obliged to absent himself from the detachment, and did not return to duty until after the detachment had reached and joined the regiment at Harrison's Landing. [33]\n\nAt Camp Russell a detail was made of from sixty to one hundred and fifty men under Captain Town, Lieutenant Warn, and another Lieutenant; the duty of the detail was that of guarding a wagon train destined for Martinsburg.\n\nIn the afternoon of the 4th of December the detachment boarded the steamer Charlotte Vanderbilt, en route for City Point, Va., which place it reached about or soon after noon of the 5th of December, 1864, and at once disembarked. Not long before reaching City Point the detachment passed Post Harrison's Landing, situated on the James River, at which place at that time was stationed the remaining portion of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Regiment. Upon passing Harrison's Landing the detachment loudly cheered.\n\nIt may, I think, be truthfully said that the campaign in the Shenandoah and Luray valleys involved three hundred and fifty or four hundred and fifty miles of hard marching, with alternate heat, cold, and rain; at times the line of march enveloped in stifling dust, then wading through the mud – and one never having seen or experienced the mud of that portion of Virginia can have no adequate conception of its stickiness. Many of the men were without tents, blankets or overcoats, and suffered severely from exposure to the elements. It may be added that the detachment at all times during that campaign did its full share of camp, guard, picket and fatigue duty. During the campaign, Lieut. Augustus Phillips acted as Adjutant until his death at Cedar Creek; thereinafter, Lieut. Joel H. Warn. Lieut. S.H. Brown acted as Quartermaster.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe fortunes of the four companies (who, under the circumstances, may almost be entitled to the appellation of the \"Lost tribes of Israel\") have new been followed until we have arrived at a fitting point to take up the history of the doings and wanderings of the six companies.\n\nIt will be remembered that it has heretofore been stated that the field and staff officers joined the six companies at a point near the front, at Bermuda Hundred, at about 6 o'clock P.M. of the 26th day of September, 1864. Perhaps it would be well, and liberty is asked to quote extracts from a paper diary kept of the principal matters occurring at this period, as it may serve more vividly to bring before you on this occasion what happened more than thirty years ago. There is every reason to believe that such extracts as may be made are truthful and may be implicitly relied on, for the several entries upon the diary were made at the time or substantially the time of the happening, of the several events therein recorded, and were not made for publication:\n\nWe reached the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth camp about 6 P.M.; found the boys camped in an opening; on either side of our regiment were camped Pennsylvania regiments of one years; found the boys had a few tents. We slept in the Adjutant's tent; it was somewhat crowded, there being six of us; however, about 9 P.M. we spread our blankets on the ground and laid down to sleep; while so lying, one could distinctly hear the picket firing at the front. Found the regiment in utter confusion, and things looking discouraging and squally. Had the pleasure on reaching the camp of meeting Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Spencer.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 27, 1864, after breakfasting upon hardtack and fried pork, orders were received from Colonel Potter to strike tents and for the regiment to be ready to move at 10:30 a.m. Tents were immediately struck, and at 11:30 A.M. the regiment marched to Bermuda Hundred, where orders were received to report to Brigadier-General Marston at Fort Pocahontas [34], or Wilson's Landing, sometimes known as Brandon. On leaving camp in the morning, three hundred and forty four men and twelve officers of a New Jersey regiment (Thirty-eight New Jersey, Colonel W.J. Sewell), by order of Colonel Potter, were placed in charge of the commanding officer of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth. [35]\n\nAt 1:30 P.M. the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth and other troops left Bermuda Hundred for Fort Pocahontas on the steamer Thomas Powell. The New Jersey troops were transported on the steamer Portsmouth. The One Hundred and Eighty Fourth Regiment reached Fort Pocahontas at 4 P.M. of the same day, and on reaching the landing or wharf, received orders that the One Hundred and Eighty fourth should disembark and that the New Jersey troops should return to Fort Powhatten, sometimes called Wynamoke, which had been passed on the way to Fort Pocahontas.\n\nWhile at the wharf at Fort Pocahontas, and either just before or at the time of the disembarkation of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth, General B.F. Butler passed across the wharf with his aides and went on board a small despatch boat lying at the wharf, bound for City Point or Bermuda Hundred, as was said. After landing, the tents of the one Hundred and Eighty-fourth were pitched inside the breast-works of the fort; got our supper, consisting of fried pork, hardtack, and tea.\n\nOn Wednesday, September 28, 1864, at about 9 A.M., an order was received for a detail of one hundred and twelve men and two commissioned officers for picket duty; the order was promulgated and executed. At 12 o'clock M. an order was received to send two companies to Harrison's Landing, and without delay two companies were despatched by the steamer Thomas Powell. The names of the two companies so sent forward to Harrison's Landing must be supplied by your recollection. At or about 3 P.M., by invitation, the writer accompanied Brigadier-General Marston and Dr. Rice [36] of the Eighty-first New York Volunteers, in a ride to and along the picket lines, inspecting same. While on such inspection, Brigadier-General Marston promised that the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth should be sent to Harrison's Landing. At 5 P.M. of this day, Lieutenant Morris and forty-two enlisted men arrived.\n\nOn Thursday, September 29th, letters were written to the Secretary of War, to D.C. Littlejohn, M.C., [37] and to Governor Seymour, urging the union of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth, and stating the manner in which it had become separated. At about 1 o'clock P.M. four companies of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth received orders to proceed to Harrison's Landing [38] without delay, and the greater portion of such four companies, together with the field and staff, embarked on the headquarters despatch boat, the steamer Ella, bound for Harrison's Landing, at which place they arrived at about 3:30 P.M., and immediately camped in quarters that had been used by the regiment commanded by Colonel Holman, that had been ordered to the front. Upon arriving at Harrison's Landing, a company of cavalry was found to be in temporary charge of the post Harrison's Landing, which was commanded by a Lieutenant Miles, from Massachusetts. There was also a detachment of Pennsylvania artillery at the post. It may here be remarked that Harrison's Landing was sometimes known as Berkeley, a manorial residence before the Revolution. It was at one time the residence of the Harrison family, and the birthplace of Ex-President William Henry Harrison. The fortifications were extensive and in the form of an oval, and at or near the apex of the fortification was a magazine stored with ammunition etc.; the breast-works, and the space enclosed, rested upon the James River. The post was in plain sight of City Point. The afternoon the regiment reached the post the booming of cannon at the front could be distinctly heard, and at night the firing was heavy and continuous, and the flash of the guns could be distinctly seen. The breast works at Harrison's Landing enclosed a space of perhaps twenty-five to thirty acres.\n\nOn the 30th of September the remainder of the four companies reached the post, leaving two companies at Fort Pocahontas. To-day, details were made for picket, camp, and guard duty. The farthest point at this time covered by our picket lines was at a point on Herring Creek, sometimes called \"The Wade,\" sometimes \"Widow Rowland's Mill,\" for at this point there was a grist-mill and residence owned or at least occupied by a widow lady by the name of Rowland, who was a native of New Jersey. On the farm connected with this and adjacent property at this time were to be distinctly seen the lines of McClellan's breast-works after he fell back to the James River through the Chickahominy region, and hundreds of tents and ridge poles could there be seen. The highway leading north from Harrison's Landing to \"The Wade\" extended, was one of the direct roads through the Chickahominy region or swamp to Richmond, and beyond \"The Wade\" and bearing northeast the road led to Charles City Court House, thence to Norfolk. The mansion house within the breastworks was at once designated and occupied as a post hospital. By order, the regimental commander was detached from the regiment and placed in command of the post.\n\nOn Saturday, October 1st, the pickets sent or brought in two deserters, who claimed that they had enlisted at Syracuse, N.Y. They were sent forward the same day be the mail boat to General Marston, at headquarters of the separate brigade. A full mail for the regiment reached the post today.\n\nOn Sunday, October 2nd, information was received that General Marston had been ordered to the front. Later, Dr Strong reached the post, bringing orders for him to remain at Harrison's Landing until further orders. The firing was very heavy and continuous today on General Grant's left (Petersburg). At about 11 P.M. the commanding officer of the post visited the camp guard, and upon arriving at the sally-port the sentinel was leaning against the parapet; upon being spoken to, he at once cried \"Halt!\" brought his gun up and fired, the ball from the gun passing uncomfortably near the officer.\n\nOn the night of the 3d of October, and in the absence at Fort Pocahontas of the commanding officer of Post Harrison's Landing, there was an alarm occasioned by one of the sentinels on guard firing at a white dog, calling out the force and manning the trenches. The incident was laughable, but rather inconvenient.\n\nOctober 5. – At 3 P.M. a despatch boat from City Point reached the wharf at Harrison's Landing, bringing Brigadier-General Hunt and a Colonel on General Mead's staff and an unknown officer; after giving certain instruction to the Post Commander, they left for City Point.\n\nOctober 7. – Orders were received that the command of the separate brigade and department had been temporarily turned over by General Marston to Lieutenant-Colonel Patterson, of the Second New Hampshire Volunteers. [39]\n\nOctober 8. – A scout named Myers, from Richmond, on his way to General Grant at City Point, came into the post. Lieutenant Grant, of Company G [40], as about this date appointed Post Commissary.\n\nOctober 9. – Lieutenant-Colonel Patterson, commanding the separate brigade, arrived on steamer Ella and rode out to picket line, vidette [41] post, and McClellan's fortifications, accompanied by the commandant at Harrison's Landing. After Lieutenant-Colonel Patterson left, a prisoner was sent in from the picket line; he was sent to the guardhouse, and later on to department headquarters at City Point; he had important intelligence for General Grant from Richmond.\n\nOctober 10. – At 10 A.M. the Post Commandant left on the steamer General Howard for General Butler's headquarters, via Bermuda Hundred and the upper pontoon bridge, on business of the post. Butler's headquarters were in a fine pine grove about one mile from Aiken's Landing. The General was at the extreme front, and the business was transacted with the acting Adjutant-General. Before returning, the celebrated Dutch Gap canal was visited, as also the place where our troops were at that time shelling the enemy. In the evening of the same day Captain Dan O'Brian, of the Twenty-fourth New York Volunteers reached Harrison's Landing.\n\nOctober 11 – There were several alarms on the picket lines and several shots fired. John C. Lake of Oswego, N.Y., arrived today.\n\nOctober 12. – On visiting the picket line it was reported by the Sergeant of the picket line that four strange men had been seen to leave Widow Rowland's at near daybreak. The next night six men were posted in Widow Rowland's barn, unknown to her, to capture the visitors if possible. At evening, James McKinley, Captain Corey, and James Kingsley, from the One Hundred and Forty-seventh Volunteers came into camp from City Point.\n\nOctober 13. – The post Commandant, accompanied by Lieutenant Miles and a cavalry escort, rode out to Harrison's plantation; nothing was found of importance, save a United States ambulance wagon. While returning to the post, was met by a cavalryman, who reported that three of the cavalry scouts, about three miles out from the Widow Rowland's, were attacked by guerillas and one of the scouts killed and one wounded. A hurried march was made to the post, whereupon a force of cavalry and twenty-five infantry were despatched to the scene of the attack. After some time the force returned, not having succeeded in finding the guerillas, but brought in the dead cavalryman. He had been shot three times through the chest, and his head was terribly bruised and crushed in. The wounded cavalryman will recover. Three cows were driven in today. A part of twenty went out tonight to drive in a quantity of stock understood to be herded about three miles outside the picket lines.\n\nOctober 14. – About 10 o'clock A.M. the raiding party returned, bringing with it five cows, two yearlings, three heifers, and two hogs. In the afternoon the Post Commandant, accompanied by Dr. Stone, rode out to an along the picket lines, and thence to Westover, where there was what remained of a fine old colonial mansion, antedating the Revolutionary War. A profusion of roses were in flower in the garden. A monument stood in the garden west of the house, upon which appeared an inscription nearly defaced by time, and which, by reason of its uniqueness, is here reproduced: [42]\n\nHere liethe the Honorable William Byrd, Esq. Being born to one of the amplest fortunes in this country, he was sent early to England for his education, where under the care and direction of Sir Robert Southwell, and even favored with his particular instruction, he made a happy proficiency in polite and various learning. By the means of the same noble friend he was introduced to the acquaintance of many of the first persons of that age for knowledge, wit, virtue, birth, or high station, and particularly contracted a most intimate and bosom friendship with the learned and illustrious Charles Boyle, Earl of Orrery. He was called to the Bar in the Middle Temple, studied for some time in the Low Countries, visited the Court of France, and was chosen Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nThus eminently fitted for the service and ornament of his country, he was made Receiver-General of His Majesty's revenues here, was thrice appointed publick agent to the Court and Ministry of England, and being thirty seven years a member, at last became President of the Council of this Colony. To all these were added a great elegancy of taste and life, the well-bred gentleman and polite companion, the splendid occonimist and prudent father of a family, with constant enemy of all exorbitant power and hearty friend to the liberties of his country. Nat. Mar. 28, 1674 Mort Aug. 26, 1744\n\nAn. Aetat 70.\n\nOctober 15. – Today Brigadier General Carr [43] inspected the infantry and artillery at the post. In consequence of the few cavalry at this time present (the rest were out scouting) at the post, they were excused from a formal inspection.\n\nOctober 16. – During the day a negro lad came to the post; you will probably remember him by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nOctober 17. – S.N.

A colored man woman and child came in from Richmond.\n\nOctober 24. – Six cavalrymen and fifteen infantry were sent out to protect the crew of the gunboat then lying in the James River opposite the post, while the crew were destroying boats in Herring Creek. Eight boats were destroyed by the gunboat crew; the boats so destroyed furnished the Confederates and guerillas the means to cross and recross the river at will.\n\nOctober 26. – The entire forces at the post were inspected by Lieutenant Thompson, Assistant Inspector-General. He was pleased to compliment the forces upon their appearances. Today a private by the name of Hall died at the post hospital; disease fever and dysentery.

Little they'll reek, in the graves where their comrades have laid them, the sigh of the breeze, the tempest's blast, and the ceaseless murmur of the waters of the River James as they flow to the ocean, singing their last requiem. Heavy firing all day at the front.\n\nOctober 29. – General Carr, the Captain of the monitor lying in the river abreast the post, and several other officers, visited the post.

[49] At about 8 A.M. a courier brought the news that a force of Confederate cavalrymen were outside, beyond \"The Wade.\" All the cavalry and fifty infantry, in charge of Lieutenant Smith, were at once despatched to meet them. In about an hour Lieutenant-Colonel McKinley, who had previously ridden out to water his horse, rode into the post and asked that an additional force be sent out. Lieutenant Gilman and eight men were at once sent out. After the last detachment was sent out the entire garrison was put under arms. About 3 P.M. the detachments returned; they had exchanged shots with the enemy, who were variously estimated at from thirty to one hundred strong. No Confederates were injured, so far as could be ascertained. One of the cavalrymen received a scalp wound; one had his horse shot dead; another cavalry horse received a rifle shot wound in the fleshy part of the ham. The picket reserve at night was strengthened with fifteen men and a Sergeant; arms stacked in the company streets.\n\nNovember 10. – Dr. A. S.

Very heavy musketry firing at the front. The Post Commandant returned to the post on the 19th inst.\n\nNovember 20. – A despatch boat from City Point brought intelligence from General Grant's headquarters that a force had left Richmond to attack Post Harrison's Landing, and ordering that extra vigilance be had and maintained; in consequence, the picket line, picket reserve, and vidette posts were strengthened and guns stacked in company streets, and men were ordered not to undress during night.\n\nNovember 24. – The steamer Pioneer arrived, bringing a large supply of Thanksgiving gifts, eatables, etc.\n\nNovember 25. – A new and more extensive picket line was established and vidette posts thrown out further toward Richmond. During battalion drill two gunboats came down the river from City Point, having in tow a number of small boats, and indulged in gunboat exercised in the river off the post. About this date Corporal Warren C. Emmons [51], of Company H, died, and was buried with military honors.

So strong was the impression that this might be the fact, that Lieutenant-Colonel McKinley was without delay despatched by the headquarters boat to City Point to investigate, and if true that the detachment had arrived, to use every means in his power, even an appeal to General Grant personally, to effect the union of the regiment, and, in case of necessity, to telegraph to the Post Commandant and he would go personally to City Point and endeavor by every means in his power to effect the desired object. The hours wore slowly away. Many eyes were watching for the coming of a steamer. The signal station was watched for intelligence; none came from that source. Later in the day a steamer was observed making its way down the river from the direction of City Point. The anxiety of the Post Commandant was a fever heat when, at about 6 P.M., the steamer rounded to the dock and the four companies, Captain Palmer in command, disembarked. [53] The long and earnestly desired event had happened – the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Regiment was for the first time in its history a unit. As may well be imagined, the greater part of the night was spent in mutual congratulations and in narrating to each other what had occurred in our army experience. Not the least of our congratulations was the fact that the six companies could now enjoy the benefit of the experience of the four companies, and that the field and staff would be reinforced by the experience and capacity of Major Ferguson.\n\nDecember 7. – In the afternoon the troops were marched to Westover in heavy marching order by the way of the reserve station, and thence to camp again.\n\nDecember 9. – Light snow, the first of the season here.\n\nDecember 14. – About 1 o'clock this morning a tug arrived from General Butler's headquarters with an order directing that the cavalry be ready to march at 10 A.M. with ten days rations and four day's forage.

The Post Commandant returned to Fort Pocahontas.\n\nDecember 24. – At Fort Pocahontas Major Tantum and party, with the Pioneer, went after the family and goods of a Mr. Pearman; returned safely same night with the parties and property, and next day were taken to Norfolk on the Pioneer.

About 8 A.M. General Sheridan had staff rode into our lines and to post headquarters where he (his staff having strolled about the post) remained for over an hour; after which General Sheridan and staff embarked upon the Swan for City Pont. Meanwhile his cavalry were marching to the pontoon bridge near Bermuda Hundred, and thence to City Point. By the Swan Major Ferguson proceeded to the headquarters of General Gibbon, and returned in the evening, bringing very satisfactory news. During the stay of General Sheridan at post headquarters, much was said by him about the progress of the war, future possibilities, probabilities and results, and the cavalry movement afterwards resulting in the battle of Five Forks [59] was clearly foreshadowed. Much was said about the enormous war supplies of all kinds then collected and stored at City Point, and the terrible effects that would result if by any chance the Confederates should capture that base of supplies; that the post Harrison's Landing was an important key to such movement, and must be held at all hazards; that if the forces then at Harrison's Landing had not done their whole duty in the past and did not enjoy the fullest confidence of those entrusted with the conduct of the war, they would long since have been removed and their place taken by troops considered more reliable; that while post and garrison life was irksome and tiresome, yet good soldiers had but one rule to follow, and that was to obey orders under any and all circumstances; that he was pleased with the post and that appearance of the officers and men, and the vigilance observed in those who were doing vidette and picket duty. This is but a meager outline of what was said by General Sheridan on this occasion and memory of what was said on the occasion referred to. The Post Commandant accompanied General Sheridan to the steamer, and on parting bade him God-speed.\n\nMarch 28. -- Paymaster Pearsons arrived.\n\nMarch 29. -- The regiment was paid off.\n\nMarch 30. -- Last night the cannonading at the front, especially Petersburg, was continuous, and it has continued all day. By order of General Carr, Company “I” was sent to Fort Pocahontas. Company ”I” was transported by the Swan.\n\nApril 1. -- Heavy firing on the left (Petersburg) all night.\n\nApril 2. -- Inspection of quarters. Intelligence was received this evening of the capture of Petersburg and a large number of prisoners. Heavy firing all day, and especially in the right (Richmond).\n\nApril 3. -- Richmond was taken this morning. [60] The news was received with great rejoicing. \"Glory to God in the highest.\" During the day an occasional gun can be heard at the front.\n\nApril 4. -- There was a rumor at evening that General Lee had surrendered with thirty thousand men. The rumor is not creditable -- it is too good to be true. The Major and party went out scouting today.\n\nApril 9. -- Sermon at the post hospital by Chaplain Post.\n\nApril 10. -- News of the surrender of General Lee and his army was received. \"Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.\"\n\nApril 13. -- About sunset a salute was fired at Richmond. Can it be for the surrender of Johnston? [61] It is to be hoped so.\n\nApril 19. -- About 10 A.M., Private Daniel Cole, of Company K, while on picket duty, was killed by the explosion of a shell which he had found in the woods near the picket line. He was endeavoring to remove the cap, and the same being rusty, he struck it to loosen it. A piece of the shell penetrated his right thigh and came out under the left arm. He was mangled horribly and killed instantly. Private Cole was buried with military honors. His grave was made under the trees on the river bank, within the fortifications.\n\nApril 25. -- The entire force at the post was reviewed by General Carr and staff. At or near evening General Rufus Ingalls, Chief Quartermaster of the Army of the Potomac, visited the post and post headquarters.\n\nApril 26. -- By order No. 66 of the War Department, the post flag was displayed at half mast and minute guns were fired every half-hour from sunrise to sunset, and by the same order the troops at the post were mustered at 10 A.M. to hear said order read. Order No 66 had reference to the death of President Lincoln.\n\nApril 27. -- The forces at the post were inspected by Lieutenant Saulpaugh, Brigade Inspector.\n\nApril 28. -- Intelligence of the surrender of General Johnston and forces was received, and by order from the War Department one hundred guns were fired. The good work marches on apace, and the end of this terrible war draws visibly near.\n\nApril 29. -- General Carr and party of officers and ladies arrived at the post and visited Westover.\n\nApril 30. [62] -- Troops mustered for pay by Lieutenant Saulpaugh.\n\nMay 4. -- Mr. Crenshaw, the owner of Harrison's Landing (Berkeley estate), and Mr. Elliott, the owner of the Westover estate visited the post.\n\nMay 7. -- Inspection of quarters and sermon from Chaplain Post.\n\nMay 12 or 13. -- The cavalry were ordered from and left the post. The force has been effective and very satisfactory.\n\nMay 14. -- Farewell sermon by Chaplain Post. The guards about the vacant cavalry quarters were doubled.\n\nMay 18. -- Inspection by Lieutenant Saulpaugh . At 12 o'clock noon General Carr and a party of citizens reached the post by headquarters boat and visited Westover.\n\nMay 19. -- Shirley, also called Carter's, General Lee's plantation and residence, [63] built before the Revolution, was visited by Major Ferguson, Quartermaster Dunn, and the writer. At about sunset orders were received by telegraph from City Point directing that the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth be ready to move at an hour's notice, and all surplus property be carried with the regiment.\n\nMay 20. -- By virtue of special orders No. 40, all the ordnance and ordnance stores, etc. were shipped to Colonel W. J. Sewell, thirty-eight New Jersey Volunteers, at Fort Powhattan.The writer here ventures to transcribe the last entry made in his diary at Post Harrison's Landing:\n\nSunday, May 21, 1865. -- Arose 5 A.M. Morning fine. No inspection today. In the afternoon rode around the picket line, visiting all the posts now occupied, as well as those heretofore occupied. It was a sad ride, and yet not unmingled with satisfaction, for I knew that while we had been at this post we had done our whole duty so far as the same had come to our knowledge. About sundown it clouded up, and during the whole evening have had a furious thunderstorm. This is probably the last night at Harrison's Landing.\n\nIt proved to be the last night at Post Harrison's Landing.\n\nAt this particular point in the regimental history it will not be inappropriate to state that during the sojourn of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth at Post Harrison's Landing the duties devolved upon the regiment were many and arduous, and were at all times discharged efficiently and cheerfully. From the very first day the regiment reached the post, camp, guard, vidette, and picket duty was commenced, and continued each and every day without intermission until the regiment left the post, excepting the few days when the inclemency of the weather forbade it. Squad, company, and battalion drill, inspections and dress parades were had with the utmost regularity. Various scouting parties were sent out that have not received mention in this paper. Inspections were had in strict accordance with the army regulations. Toward the latter part of the tour of duty at the post, scarcely a day passed that scouts and spies were not passing to and from City Point and to and from Richmond through the post, and may interesting incidents might be narrated in connection with such visitations by such persons. To narrate them would unduly lengthen this paper, and might savor of improper and undue personality on the part of the writer. It was not infrequent that torpedoes were seen floating down the river that had been set afloat by the Confederates higher up the stream, with the hope and expectation that some of them at least might chance to collide with out gunboats, monitors and other craft occupying the river, and thus destroy our craft. Two at least of these torpedoes were captured and brought on shore just above and west of our outer picket line.\n\nFor many days prior to the visit of General Sheridan to the post as herein narrated, gunboats were patrolling the river from time to time from a point a little below Westover. The occasion was not infrequent that monitors anchored off the post; from all which things, and from what was said, as well as from dispatches received at post headquarters from General Grant's headquarters from time to time, it was then believed, and time and reflection has confirmed that belief, that it was thought at army headquarters that an effort might be made at any time to capture Harrison's Landing, thus effecting a lodgment on the river from which to make a movement looking to the destruction of the depot of supplies and munitions of war at City Point, which, if effected, would have practically paralyzed the armies then operating at the front, and especially the army before Petersburg and farther south.\n\nIt was for the reasons enumerated, and for other reasons that might be stated, that the utmost vigilance was at all times insisted upon to guard against surprise. How well those duties were discharged, and vigilance at all times maintained, yon are the only living witnesses. Whether the vigilance of the troops at Harrison's Landing prevented an attack upon the post and then a movement on City Point, is and ever will remain an unknown quantity and an unsolvable problem. Suffice it to say, no attack was made during the occupancy of the post by the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth.\n\nMay 22, about noon, the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth commenced leaving by steamer for City Point, beginning on the right--first three companies, then four companies, and lastly two companies, with headquarters. One company remained at Fort Pocahontas until later. The One Hundred and Eighty-fourth camped a little south of the prison, called the \"bull-pen.\" A few days later the remaining company of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth (Company I) arrived at City Point from Fort Pocahontas.\n\nOn May 23d, headquarters of the regiment were located in quarters formerly occupied by Colonel Morrison, of the Sixteenth New York Heavy Artillery.\n\nOn May 27th, Hon. Elias Root and wife visited the camp of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth. About this date, the Colonel commanding the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth was detached and placed in command of the United States forces stationed at City Point.\n\nThe camp of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth, although selected with the greatest possible care, was unhealthy, for it had been camped on. So frequently that the ground was saturated with the offal and filth of previous camps. The weather was very warm and murky, and the water for use was unfit for drinking The consequence was, very soon fevers and bowel complaints made their appearance, and the sick-list swelled at a rapid rate, and; with it all, the daily detail from the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth for camp and, prison guard duty was largely increased.\n\nIt was difficult to maintain and enforce a proper discipline, for it was conceded on all hands that the civil war was practically at an end, and, after the tension of the past few months, caused by the suspense and vigilance required, the reaction and rebound was proportionately great.\n\nThe days at City Point were without special incident, and were passed by the regiment in the usual routine duties.\n\nOn May 29th, the Colonel of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth was returned to duty with the regiment.\n\nJune 11.-Special order No. 67 from department headquarters was received at the regimental headquarters. This was an order preparatory and looking toward the muster-out of the regiment.\n\nJune 12.-Lieutenant-Colonel McKinley's health became so much affected that he was ordered to the post hospital at City Point.\n\nJune 13.-A general court-martial was ordered by the commander of the Department of the Nottoway, of which court-martial the commanding officer of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth was appointed President. The medical officer in charge of the hospital reports Lieutenant-Colonel McKinley as very low.\n\nJune 18.-General Carr and Captain Johnson, his Acting Adjutant-General, were relieved from duty and ordered to their homes. The command of the separate brigade was then devolved on the commandant of the regiment, as also of the forces stationed at City Point. For the past few days troops have been passing City Point on their way to Washington to participate in the grand review, and thence to their homes.\n\nJune 19.-Quartermaster Dunn, Dr. Lovejoy, and the writer rode to Petersburg, where the writer had an interview with General Hartsuff; the General promised that the regiment be mastered out within ten days.\n\nJune 20.-An interview was had with Captain Remington, Chief Commissary of Musters, Department of Virginia, and instructions received to proceed at once to prepare muster-out rolls. These instructions were communicated to the company commanders, who at once proceeded to prepare discharge and descriptive lists. Quartermaster Dunn was sent to Richmond to obtain blank muster-out rolls, etc., and other necessary blanks.\n\nJune 21.-Quartermaster Dunn returned from Richmond with muster-out blanks, etc.\n\nJune 22.-Messengers Lieutenant Smith and Private Amos Youmans, carrying muster-out rolls, etc., left for department headquarters.\n\nJune 23.-Mrs. Ferguson, Captain Palmer, Lieutenant Leonard, and Sergeant Rich arrived at City Point and the camp of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth. Messrs. Smith and Youmans returned with corrected rolls, etc.\n\nJune 24.-The Ninety-sixth New York Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Heynes, commanding, arrived at City Point from Richmond.\n\nJune 25 (Sunday).-By order, the writer turned over the command of the forces stationed at City Point to Lieutenant-Colonel Heynes, of the Ninety-sixth New York Volunteers, and took command of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth; and by the same order the separate brigade ceased to exist. Lieutenant Smith and Private Youmans left for Richmond with corrected rolls, etc.\n\nJune 27.--The last dress parade of the regiment was had.\n\nJune 29 - Captain Remington, accompanied by two clerks, reached the regiment, and about 3 P.M. the muster-out commenced, and was finished about 4.30 P.M. Two transports (North Point and Robert Morris) reached City Point, and are here for the purpose of transporting the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth to Baltimore. Commenced placing on board these boats the baggage, etc., and during the night and early on the 30th of June the regiment embarked -- Companies. A, B, D, I, and F on the North Point, Major Ferguson in command. The remaining companies, together with the field and staff, embarked on the Robert Morris.\n\nThere was also embarked the body of one of our privates who died at the City Point [64] hospital the day before the embarkation of the regiment; the body was carried with us to Syracuse, N. Y. The transports so loaded left the dock at City Point about 4 A. M. arriving at Fortress Monroe about 2 p. M. After about an hour's delay at Fort Monroe, the transports left for Baltimore. Soon after leaving Fort Monroe the transports parted company. The North Point being much the faster boat was not seen again until the Robert Morris reached Baltimore.\n\nThe Robert Morris reached Baltimore Saturday, July 1, about 10 A. M. The North Point had already arrived, and the troops on her had disembarked.\n\nThe regiment thence proceeded to the Soldiers' Rest, and after having a dinner which the authorities had kindly provided, the regiment reformed and marched to the depot, where some unavoidable delay was encountered in consequence of a lack of proper transportation for the sick of the regiment. The cause of the delay having been obviated, the train left Baltimore bound for Elmira, which latter point, after a continuous ride, was reached about 4 P.M. of Sunday, July 2. For want of transportation, the regiment remained at Elmira, in Barracks No. 1, during the night. En route from Baltimore to Elmira, Orderly Sergeant Hiram Lincoln [65] and Private Castle, [66] both of Company H, died, and their remains were taken to their several homes.\n\nJuly 3.-The regiment took a, train for Binghamton, arriving at the last-named place at 12 M. After a vexatious delay for want of transportation, the regiment left at 5 P.M. for Syracuse, and arrived at that place about 12 o'clock midnight. The regiment without delay marched to the fair ground south of Syracuse, and encamped in due form. Instructions were duly given and promulgated that there must be no straggling, and camp guards were placed about the camp.\n\nJuly 4.-Daybreak revealed the fact that during the night all the regiment save about one hundred men and one or two officers had decamped and had availed themselves of a train of cars that had been sent to Syracuse by friends in Oswego, in waiting to convey the regiment to Oswego and places along the line of the road, and which would enable the men to meet their friends and participate in the national holiday. Had it not been that the regiment had in fact been mustered out of service and that the only reason that existed for the regiment remaining intact was to receive pay, the occurrence of such an unceremonious leave-taking would have been a grave breach of military discipline, and would never otherwise have occurred. It is proper to say that when the above mentioned instructions were given, it was deemed quite questionable whether they would be followed, but had they not been given, it might have been thought that the commanding officer of the regiment had been derelict in his duty.\n\nJuly 8.-The muster rolls for pay were completed and delivered by the mustering officer to the paymaster.\n\nJuly 11.-The larger portion of the regiment reported at camp for muster and pay.\n\nJuly 12.-At about 11 A. M. Major Storms, United States Paymaster, began paying, and paid the men of eight companies, when the funds then on hand were exhausted. Companies C and I were left unpaid.\n\nJuly 14.-About noon Companies C and I were paid – the former at the Second National Bank and the latter by Major Storms. After the companies and all the officers of the regiment save the commanding officer had been paid and discharged, the Colonel commanding was paid and discharged, and the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Regiment no longer existed in fact, but nevertheless remained as a memory.\n\nA few words may not be out of place in memory of those of the regiment who lost their lives on the field of battle, [67] as also those others who lost their lives by disease [68] in the discharge of their duty. Very fortunately, the number in both classes is relatively small. They have simply preceded us to that land whither all are hastening. The lives thus lost and lain down in the service of our country are mute testimonials of their devotion to the perpetuity of the institutions of our native land and its indivisibility. The observances upon Decoration Day proclaim the respect of the people for the sacrifices thus made by the dead. But, comrades and survivors of the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth, there is a solemn but unspoken warning that comes from every life now silent in the grave. It asks us not to keep our kisses for the dead; it pleads for tenderness and kindly sympathy toward those who are still at our side. They annoy us, perhaps, for they are human; they offend us daily, it may be, for they are not perfect; they tax our forbearance sorely and are often harsh and unjust to us. But the grave is only a little way before us all. When the face that frowned upon us is white and cold, and the lip that mocked us or said cruel things to vex us is forever silent, and the hand that menaced us has lost its last hold upon earth, will it be any comfort to us that we resented the injury and returned scorn for scorn? Perhaps the fault is not all on one side. It may be, to a juster judgment, we have sinned the most in these petty conflicts; but if we have not, and if the wrong has been wholly unprovoked, we shall do well to anticipate the day when the river of death divides as, and look Just now into the eyes we shun, with something of that tender, forgiving spirit we fain would show when we bend above the unanswering clay. Let us not wait for our friends and neighbors to die before we cover them with flowers. Let us make our present fellowship a fragrant offering that shall be a part of their life, and thus survive in memory beyond the tomb. Such flowers and offerings are perennial blossoms, gifted by the chemistry of the heart with perpetual beauty and fragrance through the eternal years.\n\nW. G. ROBINSON\n\nOswego, N.

In a speech delivered by Maj. H. H. Lyman of the 147th New York Volunteer Infantry the same summer and later reproduced in Oswego County in the Civil War (1962) pp. 1-4, he notes the following:\n\n“The population of Oswego County at the outbreak of the Rebellion was 75,600.\n\nIt was excelled by no other county in the State, in promptly and fully responding to its country’s calls, and is credited with having furnished 12,500 men for the War, as shown by the records of our War Committee. Many of these, however, were re-enlistments of men who had served in short term regiments; some had been discharged for disability, and re-entered the service; and some even, who had deserted, repented of their foolish action, and again entered the service.\n\nAs to the exact number of individual men, I am unable to state, but in round numbers, not far from 11,000, or fifteen per cent of its whole population, and seventy-five percent of its voting population.\n\nThese figures will seem almost incredible, until you know that nearly as many enlisted who were under the voting age as those who were over, ---- the average being about twenty-three years.\n\nWe had five regiments of infantry and two batteries of artillery, composed mostly, and some of them entirely of Oswego County men, namely, the 24th, 81st, 110th, 147th and 184th Infantry and Ames’ Battery and Barnes’ Battery. The 24th Cavalry was also called an Oswego Regiment, but actually had but three Oswego Companies and they were largely reenlistments from the old 24th Infantry.\n\nWe furnished a battalion each for the 12th Cavalry and the 189th and 193rd Infantry. We sent 300 men into the 1st Artillery and 241 into the United States Regulars, and being a lake county, with at that time a large sailor population, sent hundreds into the navy, besides many to the Engineers and other branches of the service.”\n\n5.

With the fall of Petersburg, Richmond was abandoned by both the Confederate Army and Government. Units of the Army of the James which had participated in the final phases of the battle occupied Richmond, while the Army of the Potomac pursued Lee west to Appomattox Courthouse. The 81st NY Volunteer Infantry, also from Oswego, was the first infantry unit to occupy the former Confederate capital.\n\n61.

Johnston remained in the field in North Carolina until it surrendered on April 26, 1865. The last active units of the Confederacy would surrender in Texas on June 2, 1865.\n\n62.
