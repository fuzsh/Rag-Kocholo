        "text": "\"A HISTORY OF DELAWARE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, AND ITS PEOPLE\"\n\nDelaware County in the Civil and Spanish American War\n\nPages 522-558\n\n[Source: A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and Its People, Volume 2, By John Woolf Jordan, 1914]\n\nTranscribed for Genealogy Trails by Jennifer Novotny\n\nDELAWARE COUNTY IN THE CIVIL WAR. When on Saturday, April 13, 1861, the American flag was shot from Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, and the little band of men who had so gallantly held out in the face of certain defeat marched out and Major Anderson officially surrendered, the first episode, in what was destined to be the greatest sectional conflict the world had ever seen, was completed. Northward the last echoes of the firing rolled, and in their flight aroused the passions which had been slumbering for forty years. Over North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland they came, leaving in their wake, martial alarm and a wild unreasoning excitement. Reaching Pennsylvania, they transformed a peaceful, industrious farming and manufacturing community into a place of excited madmen, drunk with patriotic fervor. In Chester, Media, Darby, Rockdale, Kellyville, and in every town, borough and hamlet in Delaware county, the pent-up feelings of the people broke all restraint. Merchants closed their shops, farmers left their plows, and everywhere were groups of men discussing the engrossing news. Patriotism was at its highest pitch, and from the top of every store, factory, public building and private dwelling the Stars and Stripes floated in the breeze. Many were the theories advanced as to the probable course of the Federal government, and great the speculation regarding the outcome of the struggle which all saw was inevitable. The following day was Sunday; every ear was strained for intelligence from Washington, and in its absence the suspense became unendurable. Monday morning, April 15, 1861, the public excitement was given direction, when President Lincoln issued his first call for seventy-five thousand volunteers to serve for a period of three months, unless sooner discharged.\n\nIn Media, that morning, the tolling of the court house bell summoned the people thither, and after patriotic speeches had been delivered, it was determined to form a rifle corps immediately. At Chester, on the evening of the same day, the old town hall, which had witnessed the formation of companies to take part in the Revolution, saw again a like scene which equalled in sternness and decisiveness of purpose that former one. To the present generation the issue of the preservation of the Union was as vital as that of obtaining liberty had been to their forefathers, and there were as many who were glad, nay anxious, to offer their lives to maintain the unity of their country. Theirs was a sterner duty, for here was no invader or oppressor to be fought, but brother would meet brother; father, son: and the wound of bullet could never equal the wound of heart caused by the thought that perchance a speeding shot had found a resting place in the body of a loved one.\n\nOn Wednesday night, at Media, a meeting was called in the court house; Edward Darlington was chosen chairman, with Charles D. Manley, Charles R. Williamson, James R. Cummins, John R. Roland, Robert Playford. and J. Crosby Fairlamb, vice-presidents: O. F. Bullard and Thomas V. Cooper, secretaries. The speakers were John M. Broomall, Joseph Addison Thompson and Hugh Jones Brooke. The many rumors of Confederate preparation for attack had keyed the feelings of the populace to a higher point, if such were possible, and no historical or oratorical goad was needed to spur them on to enlistment. Name after name was rapidly handed in, and in a short time the ranks of the Delaware County Union Rifles were filled, with many disappointed applicants, clamoring for a place in line with the fortunate ones who had been chosen. One Friday morning, April 19, the men assembled before the court house, and after a prayer by Rev. Gracey, in which he commended the company to the care of an allwise and omnipotent Providence, they marched to the cars and left for Philadelphia. In the afternoon they reached Harrisburg, encamping on the capitol grounds, and the next day, April 20, 1861, were mustered into service for three months, as Company F, 4th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers. The officers were : Captain, George Dunn; first lieutenant, T. V. Cooper; second lieutenant, A. McMuron; sergeants: William Callum, Richard Stiles, Thomas J. McMillan, J. L. Woodcock; corporals; Caleb Hooper, James Mulholland, John B. Sully, William Durell; musicians: William Quail, Henry Carnay. Privates: Henry J. Baker, Thomas Broomall, John Baggs, Peter Brantz, William Baggs, John Britton, Matthew Blair, Robert Coppock, John Cottingham, John Clowney, Thomas Coulter, James Conner, John B. Davis, Thomas Dyson, John M. Davis, William Eekil, James Evans, Abel Ford, Allen Ford, Lorenzo D. Farra, William Farra, David Grubb, Thomas Griffen, James Gorman, John W. Glen, Benjamin Graden, George W. Glen, Harry Greenwood, Hamilton Gillon, Robert Henderson, John Hollingsworth, Patrick Hughes, Daniel Harigan, Robert Johnson, Stephen Johnson, Jeremiah Ketzler, Thomas Kelly, Thomas Laden, Benjamin H. Magee, Michael Monahan, Michael Martin, John McCuen, William McGinnis, Richard J. Nuttle, John Palmer, John P. Potts, Joseph Parker, William Roberts, Amos R. Rap, Franklin Redmond, Antrim Redmond, Ephraim Stirk, George Stikes, Samuel N. Techton, William Townsend, John Yeehton, Baker E. Wright, James W. G. Weaver, James Walters, James Worrell, John Williams, Lee L. Yarnall.\n\nThe 4th Regiment, commanded by Col. John F. Hartranft, was ordered on the following day, April 21, to proceed to Philadelphia, where, under command of Col. Dare, of the 23rd Regiment, acting brigadier, it was dispatched to Perryville, Maryland. The next day it embarked on steamers for Annapolis, thence to Washington, a direct route, having been abandoned for fear of delay and possibly riots at Baltimore. The regiment had been rushed forward so rapidly that it had been impossible to uniform the men, but all were provided with muskets and carried ammunition in their pockets. Many of the men were taken ill, and the regiment encamped about two miles from the city, toward Bladensburg. On June 24 the regiment received marching orders and proceeded to Alexandria, where on Sunday, June 30, its pickets for the first time were engaged with a small detachment of the enemy. The 4th, in McDowell's army, formed part of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division. Its term of enlistment expired Sunday, July 31, 1861, and McDowell, planning an attack, desired the regiment to remain until the battle, now known as the First Bull Run, was fought. The men differed as to what course to pursue, but the regiment finally marched to Washington and thence by rail to Harrisburg, where it was mustered out of service. Gen. McDowell, in his report after his crushing defeat, censured the 4th Pennsylvania severely. The records show that in the majority of cases the men performed their duty well on many a bloody field in the following four years, when their valor and patriotism were tested to the full and they were not found wanting. The Delaware County Rifles, however, had been discharged from duty the day before, and were thus relieved from McDowell's unfavorable criticism.\n\nIn Chester, also, steps for the organization of a company were immediately taken. On Wednesday following the call for volunteers, more than a sufficient number had been enrolled to form a company, and the name Union Blues was adopted. An election of officers was immediately held, Henry B. Edwards being chosen captain, and to him Rev. Talbot presented a sword he bad worn when chaplain in the United States Navy. The company, in order to be ready to respond to orders at a minute's notice, began to drill and to equip. On Saturday morning, April 20, 1860, the Union Blues were ordered to Harrisburg, and on the evening of that day gathered in front of the Washington House in Chester, where they were addressed by Frederick J. Hinkson. He assured the volunteers that the citizens of the borough would see that their wives and families should suffer in no way during their absence. Several other addresses were made by prominent clergymen, among them Rev. Talbot, Rev. Sproul and Rev. Father Haviland. The latter divine contributed largely to a fund for equipping the soldiers and for maintaining their families, besides personally soliciting subscriptions. Toward evening, as the time of departure approached, crowds of people from the outlying districts came into town to witness the leavetaking of the \"Boys in Blue\" for the front. At the time there was a general feeling in the North that the trouble would be settled in a month or so, and at this first leavetaking there was not the air of gloom and depression that came in later years of the war, when families had been drawn upon until only the youngest son remained, leaving entire towns empty and cheer-less.\n\nThe Union Blues reached Camp Curtin at Harrisburg the following day, and on Monday, April 22, were mustered into the 9th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, for three months. On May 4, the regiment moved to West Chester, arriving there in the midst of a blinding snow and sleet storm, and quartered in the old depot. The next day Col. Longnecker selected a location for camp, calling it Camp Wayne, in honor of \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne of Revolutionary fame. On May 26, 1861, the 9th was ordered to Wilmington, Delaware, to prevent the organization of Confederate companies there, and camped at Hare's Corners, between Wilmington and New Castle. The regiment was ordered to Chambersburg June 6, to join Gen. Patterson's command, and was attached to the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, under Col. Miles. On Sunday, June 16, Col. Miles' brigade crossed the Potomac, the 9th regiment on the right of column, the troops wading the stream breast high. They were later ordered to recross and take a position covering the ford. On July 1 the brigade again crossed over in the direction of Martinsburg, and a week later Gen. Patterson ordered a movement in the direction of Winchester and Bunker Hill, but the order was countermanded. On the 17th of July, Longnecker's brigade marched toward Charlestown, encamping there and remaining until the 21st, when it marched on to Harper's Ferry. On the 22nd the 9th Regiment proceeded to Hagerstown, thence to Harrisburg, where it was mustered out of service, the term of enlistment having expired. The roll of Company 1, 9th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, is as follows:\n\nCaptain, Henry B. Edwards; first lieutenant, James G. Stacey; second lieutenant, William Blakeley; Sergeants: William B. Stevenson, John Beck, James Williams, William Eves; corporals: Isaac Weaver, William R. Thatcher, Charles Storey, Jesse Cummings; musicians: Ezra Dransfield and Alexander King.\n\nPrivates: John Booth, Joseph Barker, Joseph Brewster, Lewis Benner, John C. Barrowclough, Thomas Blythe, Isaac F. Badden, William H. Brown, David Burke, George Booth, Thomas W. Bruner, Edward Crowther, Edward Collison, Samuel Cross, Daniel Crowther, James Cliff, Allen Carr, Frederick Cutler, Frederick Crider, Simeon Davis, John John Doyle, William Elliott, Theodore Ettienne, Robert Fogg, John Farraday, Joseph Grooves, William P. Huff, James Hewes, George Helms, William F. Jester, James P. Kelley, Edward Kay, Jonathan Kershaw, Edward Lilley, Edward Lyons, Thomas McNamee, William McNeil, John Marshall, William Marlor, Samuel McDaniel, George McAffee, John C. Morton, John Phillips, Daniel Pithie, Thomas F. Pierce, Anthony Quinn, Francis Rodrigos, Robert Reaney, Samuel Shepherd, Francis Scott, Edgar Stevenson, William V. Shellinger, John Smith, Samuel Smith, Thomas Toy, Joseph Taylor, junior, Richard Turner, George W. Wilson, Joshua L. Wilson, John Wagner, Robert Wright, Alfred Woodhead, George Weigan, Reed L. Weaver.\n\nWhile the Delaware County Rifles and the Union Blues were the two largest companies formed in the county, the citizens immediately formed others, so that in case of another call they could take the field at once. All through the county, Home Guards were formed and drilled -at Chester, Media, Rockdale, Darby, Linwood, Kellyville, Wildeville, Glen Mills, Village Green, Upland, and other towns. So rapidly did these organizations become proficient in the handling of arms and in drill, that at Chester, on the Fourth of July, the Wayne Guards, Captain W. C. Gray; the Home Guards, Captain H. B. Taylor; Company A, Captain George E. Darlington; and the Upland Guards, Captain George K. Crozer, held a parade, while at the county seat, on the same day, the Village Green Guards, Captain Barton; Glen Mills Guards, Captain Willcox; Manchester Rifles, Captain Ballentine; and Upper Darby Home Guards, Captain Buckley, joined with the Media Home Guards in a parade.\n\nA meeting, at which were present people from all over the county, was held at the Media court house on Tuesday afternoon, April 23, 1861, under charge of H. Jones Brooke, for the purpose of raising money to equip troops and for the maintenance of those dependent upon the volunteers then in service. The response was generous and hearty, $2500 being contributed that day. Moreover, the county was divided into seven districts for the purpose of making a house to house canvass in the solicitation of subscriptions. The first district was composed of Chester, Ridley and Tinicum: the second, of Media, Nether and Upper Providence; and all of Middletown east of Edgemont road; the third, Marcus Hook, Linwood, Lower and Upper Chester, Bethel, and all of Aston south of Concord Road; the fourth, Concord, Birmingham, and Thornbury; the fifth, Aston, east of Concord Road and Edgemont; the sixth, Darby, Upper Darby and Springfield; and the seventh, Haverford, Marple, Newtown, and Radnor. Since all present were taxpayers, they called upon the county commissioners to appropriate at once $5000 and $20,000 later, for the support of the families of those who should enlist. The activity of the several committees was remarkable, for in two days they collected $2,700 in addition to which Samuel M. Felton, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad Company, contributed $1000, a company gift. Further evidence of the generosity of the company, as well as of the patriotic spirit of the directors, was given, when Mr. Felton informed the clerks in the employ of the road that in the event of any of them leaving to go to the front, their salaries would be paid during their absence, and that their positions would be open upon their return.\n\nIt would be difficult to pay a fitting tribute to the courage and fortitude of the women of the county, who, in stoical silence, watched their loved sons, husbands and fathers, march away with the possibility that the present would be the last farewell. We may admire and honor the soldier at the front for his dauntless courage, his uncomplaining endurance of hardships, his faithfulness to his cause, but, in all justice, we must grant the same measure of admiration and honor to his wife or mother, who, in the silent desolation of her home, waits for intelligence from the battle, longing for, yet dreading, the news that may either break her anxious heart, or consign her once more to ceaseless waiting for the unknown. There was no more suffering at the front during the terrible years from 1861 to 1865, than there was by many a hearthstone at home.\n\nTwenty-sixth Regiment - On May 31, 1861, a company recruited by William L. Grubb, from Chester and vicinity, for three years, was mustered into service as Company K, 26th Regiment. Immediately after, it was ordered to Washington, where the main body of the regiment was on guard over the quartermaster-general's stores, the arsenal, and the flying bridge at Georgetown. As the company's train passed through Chester, the great throng at the station cheered wildly until it passed out of sight. The 26th was assigned to Gen. Hooker's division, and in April, 1862, was transported to the Peninsula, engaging in the siege of Yorktown, and on May 5th, in front of Fort Magruder, at the battle of Williamstown, drove the enemy from the riflepits into the works, and held its position for eight hours, until reinforced by fresh troops, when the fort was taken. The regiment was engaged in the battle of White Oak Swamp from noon till night, and just before dusk broke the enemy's lines with a gallant bayonet charge, compelling them to retire, and the following day took part in the battle of Malvern Hill. On August 20 it was dispatched to the support of Gen. Pope, with Heintzelman's corps. During that campaign it was engaged at Bristoe Station on the 26th, and the following day connected the army with its base of supplies. On the 29th it marched to the battle of Bull Run, where Captain Meekins, of Company K, was killed, and the whole regiment suffered severely. The next day the 26th supported three different batteries, which kept them continually on the march, repelling charges at different points. When Burnside was defeated at Fredericksburg, it was in the front line of battle, engaged with the enemy for thirty hours, with slight intermission. At Chancellorsville, on May 2, 1863, the regiment was ordered to reconnoiter in front of Hooker's headquarters to feel the enemy, and on the 3rd was held as a support to batteries after it had fallen back to the entrenchment, a movement caused by the 72nd New York's breaking and leaving the flank of the 26th exposed to a heavy fire by which it lost one hundred men. In the Gettysburg campaign the regiment was under Gen. Sickles, and was on the field when the battle started on the extreme right of the division, suffering severely. Toward evening it sustained the attack of a Florida brigade, which it checked, and, charging, drove the latter into confusion, capturing many prisoners. The 26th entered the battle with 364 men; its loss was 216 killed and wounded, a terrible slaughter. The regiment was in Grant's campaign, on May 5, 1864, in the battle of the Wilderness, and held an exposed position on the left, although repeated efforts were made to dislodge it. On the 12th it took part in Hancock's memorable charge with the 2nd Corps at Spottsylvania Court House, capturing two Napoleon guns. It was engaged at the crossing of North Anna river; on the 27th of May crossed the Pamunkey river at Nelson's Ford, thence marching to Philadelphia, where its mustering out on June 18, 1864, in front of Independence Hall, saw the end of a career of glorious service and the hardest kind of fighting.\n\nThirtieth Regiment (First Reserves)- So nobly and so well did the men of Pennsylvania respond to President Lincoln's call for volunteers, that for a time it seemed probable that none save those already accepted, would be mustered into service. But Gov. Curtin, who perhaps had a better knowledge of the condition and requirements of the time than any other man in official circles in the North (excepting Simon Cameron), realized that many more troops would be needed, and determined to form several military camps, and there to mobilize the various organizations of the state, to equip and discipline them, and to have them in readiness for any emergency. This purpose Gov. Curtin carried into effect, and the name Pennsylvania Reserves will ever cling to the companies thus formed: and to Gov. Curtin, Pennsylvania owes much of the honor it received, for having played such important part in the war.\n\nIn May, 1861, Samuel A. Dyer recruited from Chester and vicinity a company of infantry, named the Keystone Guards. For ten days the company was quartered in the Chester town hall, maintained by the subscription of several citizens of the borough. After changing the name of the company to the Slifer Phalanx, in honor of Hon. Eli Slifer, then secretary of the commonwealth, the organization was mustered in at the Girard House, Philadelphia, May 31, 1861, where a handsome flag, the gift of the ladies of Chester, was presented to the company of Hon. Edward Darlington. On June 4th, the Slifer Phalanx left for Camp Wayne, at West Chester, where it became company C, 30th Regiment, 1st Pennsylvania Reserves.\n\nAnother Delaware county company which had difficulty in being accepted, but which was extricated from the difficulty by Gov. Curtin's formation of the Pennsylvania Reserves, was the Rockdale Rifle Guards, recruited by William Cooper Talley, at Crozerville and Rockdale. Subsequently the name was changed to the Archy Dick Volunteers, in honor of Archibald T. Dick, a deceased member of the bar of Delaware county, in which he had held an honored position. On May 30th, 1861, the company was mustered into the 30th Regiment, 1st Reserves, as Company F, for three years service. The organization of the regiment was not fully effected until June 9, 1861, when Biddle Roberts was chosen colonel, he appointing Lieutenant Joseph R. T. Coates, of Company C, quartermaster. On July 4, Gov. Curtin reviewed the First and Seventh Reserves at West Chester, and on the 21st the 1st Regiment was ordered to Washington. At about dusk of the next day the regiment reached Baltimore, and Col. Roberts was met outside of the city limits by the police authorities, who advised against attempting to pass through the streets because of the excitement and possible rioting. Col. Roberts, however, distributed ammunition among his men and ordered them to proceed, marching through the city without molestation. The regiment was mustered into the United States service at Camp Carroll, July 26, thence marching to Annapolis, where it was quartered until August 30th in the Naval School, and then moved to Tenallytown, Maryland, where it was assigned to the 1st Brigade, under Gen. Reynolds, of McCall's division. It took part in all the movements preceding the peninsular campaign, and in that campaign, at Mechanicsville, was on the extreme right of the Army of the Potomac. In the battle of June 26th, 1862, it was under command of Fitz John Porter. There the 1st held the center, and after a three hours fight repulsed the enemy, sleeping that night on the hard won field. The next morning it was ordered to fall back, the brigade retiring in the direction of Gaines' Mills. On the 27th, the 1st and 8th Reserves moved to the rear for ammunition. Their action alarmed Fitz John Porter, who thought they were in flight, and he appealed to Col. Roberts to stop them, which upon the general's promise to provide them with ammunition, the colonel did with a word, winning the general's warm approval for the prompt action, coolness and precision of the Reserves. At New Market, on the 30th, the 1st Reserves maintained its position for five hours, repulsing three heavy attacks with a gallantry that won special mention in McCall's official report. On August 29th and 30th, in Pope's campaign, it was marching nearly all the time, constantly under fire, and for the entire forty-eight hours was totally without food. On Sunday, September 14, 1862, at South Mountain, the regiment charged the gorge and summit of a hill held by a part of Hill's corps, gaining the summit with a brilliant rush. The 1st Reserves were ready at the break of dawn to resume the struggle, but the Confederates had withdrawn under cover of darkness. The following morning, Gen. Hooker came to the field to compliment the regiment personally. In that headlong charge, Second Lieutenant John H. Taylor, of Company C, fell, leading his command. On September 16, the eve of Antietam, the First's pickets were firing upon the enemy, and at daybreak of the 17th it engaged with the Confederates, fighting until relieved at 9 o'clock. During the greater part of the battle, Captain Talley commanded the regiment. Col. Roberts having command of the 1st Brigade, and after Hooker was wounded, March 1, 1863, Captain Talley was promoted to the colonelcy. At Fredericksburg, December 13, 1862, the 1st Reserves charged across an open plain under a heavy artillery fire, driving the enemy two hundred yards behind its entrenchments, when, finding he was flanked on the right, the enemy strongly reenforced in front and no supporting troops coming up in the rear. Col. Talley \"was compelled to retire after having opened the way to victory.\" An inspiring scene was enacted when the Reserves, on June 29, 1863, were marching with the main army to Gettysburg to repel Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania. Col. Talley, as soon as the state line was crossed, halted his troops, and, in a few earnest words, besought his men to fight as they had never fought before, to cleanse the soil of their native state from the polluting step of the invader. With this incentive and their colonel's heartfelt words ringing in their ears, the men were sent to the front immediately after arrival on the field, July 2, and by a splendid charge upon the right of Little Round Top, drove the enemy back upon their reserves. On July 1st, the 1st Regiment, commanded by Col. Talley, occupied the centre of the line in the terrific charges made by the 1st Brigade. The regiment also took part in the battle of Bristol Station, and in the numerous movements of the Army of the Potomac during the latter part of 1863. In Grant's campaign, on the 5th of May, 1864, it was engaged in the battle of the Wilderness, and on May 8, Spottsylvania. In that battle Col. Talley was in command of the brigade, and on the enemy's third charge through the pine thickets, was captured by soldiers of Ewell's corps, but the following day he and several hundred other prisoners were rescued by Sheridan's cavalry. The Pennsylvania Reserves saw their last day of service May 31, 1864, when the 1st Regiment played a prominent part in the battle of Bethesda Church. The next day the Reserves were ordered home, and on June 13th were mustered out of service at Philadelphia. On March 13th, 1865, Col. Talley received the rank of brigadier general of volunteers, by brevet, for distinguished services in the field.\n\nFifty-eighth Regiment. Delaware county receives no credit whatsoever in the official records for citizens enlisted in the 58th Regiment, except in so far as \"Philadelphia and vicinity\" applies to the county, a condition which is found in other organizations as well. The fact is that almost one-half of Company H was recruited in Delaware county, while in companies B, C, and K, many Delaware county men were the first to enlist.\n\nOn March 8, 1862, the 58th was ordered to Fortress Monroe, arriving there the following day, Sunday, while the battle between the \"Monitor\" and \"Merrimac\" was in progress. On May 10th it led the advance of Gen. Wool's troops, and after the surrender of the city of Norfolk on that day, the flag of the 58th was raised over the custom house, where it remained until the regiment was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina. While at Norfolk, First Lieutenant Thomas I. Leiper, of Company A, who had been appointed adjutant while the regiment was in Philadelphia, before being ordered to the front, was assigned to the staff of Gen. Thomas L. Kane, under whom he saw service in the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg. When on September 9, 1863, Leiper was promoted to the captaincy of Company A, he at once returned to his command. On June 27, 1862, the 58th was ordered to garrison Washington, North Carolina, at the head of navigation of the Pamlico river, and while there, heavy artillery practice was held daily. One of the most dashing raids of the entire war was made on December 16, when Captain Theodore Blakeley, of Company B, a daring soldier from Chester, with a detachment of one hundred men, made a foray into the country, fifteen miles to the south, and surprised a Confederate cavalry encampment, capturing a captain and sixty men, with their horses and equipment, so completely surprising them that they yielded without a single shot. Captain Blakeley was accorded the high honor of having his expedition especially mentioned in an order from department headquarters, and was complimented therefor. The regiment joined the Army of the James, May 1, 1864, and was in action in the operations against Richmond under Gen. Butler. On the 9th, the 58th was engaged near the Appomattox river, and the following day destroyed the Petersburg & Richmond railroad for a considerable distance, thus greatly handicapping the Confederates in their transportation of ammunition and supplies. The regiment was subsequently transferred to Grant's army, and at Cold Harbor, June 3d, charged the enemy's works, capturing the rifle pits, and in the words of a New York Herald correspondent, \"Here, however, the men found themselves close prisoners, for it was utterly impossible for a head or an arm to make its appearance without being riddled by bullets. For two long hours the regiment held its position until it was reenforced.\"\n\nIt was in the attack of the Army of the James, to which it had been returned, on the enemy's lines in front of Petersburg, when the outer works were carried. When on June 24 the re-enlisted soldiers were ordered to Philadelphia on the furlough granted to veterans re-entering the service, the second term men of the 58th were allowed twenty days beyond the usual time because of good conduct and commendable service. Great self-denial was shown by Captain Leiper, who remained at the front in command of the men who had not re-enlisted and the recruits assigned to the 58th. After the furlough the regiment rejoined the army on the north of the James, and on September 28, the 58th and the 108th Pennsylvania made a desperate assault upon Fort Harrison, under a scathing fire from sixteen heavy calibre guns, when the colors of the 58th were shot away three times. Out of the 228 men of that regiment who had made the charge, 128 were killed and wounded. Among the former was Captain Theodore Blakeley, of Chester. As a result of this determined and intrepid attack, the fort, with its cannon, small arms, battle flags and garrison was captured. Although it would seem that the 58th and 108th regiments had done sufficient service for one day, nevertheless they were ordered to assault Star Fort, a mile to the left of the fortification just captured. This they did, and although they were able to scale the works and spike the enemy's guns, their fatigue and lack of support obliged them to fall back under the heavy fire to which they were subjected by the enemy's gun-boats. In the final campaign of the war, resulting in the surrender of Gen. Lee, it acquitted itself with great credit, and after the disposal of the enemy's field force was assigned to duty in the lower counties of Virginia, being mustered out at City Point, Virginia, January 24, 1866.\n\nSixtieth Regiment {Third Cavalry). It is believed that the first Pennsylvania men to enlist for a term of three years were those of Captain William L. Law's company of cavalry, organized in Delaware county in July, 1861. As Pennsylvania's quota was full at the time, Col. William H. Young asked permission to raise a regiment in any part of the country, the organization to be known as Young's Light Kentucky Cavalry. Law's company, for some unknown reason, was not accepted as a whole in this regiment, the greater part of the men being assigned to Captain William K. Grant, of Company L and the remainder distributed among the other companies. The regiment, which was entirely recruited in Pennsylvania, excepting Company D (from Washington City), was later credited to the Keystone State, and Col. Young's resignation requested by Gov. Curtin.\n\nOn October 31, 1861, William W. Averill, an officer of the 5th United States Cavalry, was appointed Young's successor. The strict discipline and adherence to rules exacted by the new commander made him most unpopular with the men at first, for under Young their conduct had been lax and unsoldierly, but the honorable record which the regiment now bears is in large measure due to the training and discipline of Col. Averill. During the winter and spring of 1862 it was constantly in the advance of the army, and was the first Union force to enter the Manassas fortifications and ascertain that the enemy had abandoned the works. In the peninsular campaign, the regiment did most of the reconnoitering for the army staff, and during that week of fighting, while the base of the operations was being changed, was almost constantly in the saddle. At Antietam it was centrally engaged, and when in October the army crossed into Virginia, it covered the right flank, which brought it constantly into contact and battle with Stuart's and Hampton's commands, meetings which finally forced the latter to retire to the Blue Ridge. On March l6th the Southern cavalry learned that their neighbors of the North were quite as skilled in mounted warfare as they, when the 60th encountered Fitz Hugh Lee and Stuart's cavalry at Kelley's Ford and decisively defeated them. The 60th rode in the noted raid which, previous to the battle of Chancellorsville, traversed the country in Lee's rear and for a time severed his railroad communication with Richmond. On June 19th, 1863, it took part in Buford's and Gregg's attack on Stuart, between Culpeper Court House and Beverly Ford, in which the latter was so signally defeated that for a time it compelled a delay in the proposed invasion of Pennsylvania. Two weeks later it was in the engagement at Aldie, which resulted in cutting off Lee from the whole of Stuart's command, so that the former was without the greater part of his cavalry until after the battle of Gettysburg. On July 2, in that battle, the 60th Regiment sustained the charge of Hampton's division in the latter's attempt to gain the rear of the Union army, and although driven back by weight of numbers, when Custer arrived with reenforcements it rallied and joined in the charge, in which the enemy was defeated with heavy loss. After taking part in the action at Old Antietam Forge on July 10, and at Shepherdstown on the 16th, it led the brave charge near Culpeper Court House, September 13, and was complimented in a general order for valor. On October 14 it was engaged at Bristol Station, and the next day, when the cavalry covered the army wagon train of seventy miles, the 60th was detailed as rear guard and repulsed the attack of Gordon's division, holding its ground for over two hours, before supported. Once again Gen. Buford issued an order commending its skill and bravery. At New Hope Church, on September 26th, while dis-mounted, aided by the 1st Massachusetts, it maintained a position against the attacks of the Stonewall Brigade for two hours until Sykes' Regulars had time to advance to its support. It was constantly engaged in the Wilderness campaign under Grant, and acted as escort when Grant and Meade crossed the James on pontoon bridges. The history of the engagements preceding Lee's surrender is the history of the 60th Regiment, and when on April 3, Grant and Meade entered Petersburg, it formed part of the General's escort. At Lee's surrender it was in the advance between the lines of battle of the two armies. The 60th was mustered out of service August 7, 1865.\n\nNinety-seventh Regiment. Henry B. Guss, of West Chester, was authorized by the Secretary of War in the latter part of July, 1861, to raise a regiment for three years' service. The companies recruited mainly from Media, Chester and neighboring vicinities were composed almost entirely of men who had been in the three months' service, and had some knowledge of military tactics and duties. The following companies were enrolled : Company D, the Concordville Rifles, Captain William S. Mendenhall, recruited in the western end of the county; Company G, the Broomall Guards, (named in honor of Hon. J. M. Broomall), Captain Jesse L. Cummings, recruited mostly in Media, Chester and neighborhood: Company I. Brooke Guards (so called in honor of Hon. Hugh Jones Brooke, post commissary of Pennsylvania, who contributed largely to the outfit and comfort of the men), Captain George W. Hawkins, recruited mostly from Springfield and Ridley townships. The companies encamped at Camp Wayne, near West Chester, where Gov. Curtin presented the state colors to the regiment on November 12, the day it left for Washington. Shortly thereafter it was ordered to Fortress Monroe and subsequently to Port Royal, South Carolina, arriving off the harbor December 11, but was compelled by heavy weather to put out to sea, and disembarkation was delayed for three days. In January, 1862, it took part in the expedition to Warsaw Sound, Georgia, which resulted in the capture of Fort Pulaski, and on March 5 the 97th was landed from the transport in the Florida expedition, capturing Fermandina and Fort Church. In March, Gen. Hunter, relieving Gen. Sherman, ordered an evacuation of Florida. In a bold expedition to Legarsville, South Carolina, in June, 1862, Company G (Broomall Guards) and Company H occupied the town. In the Confederate attack at Secessionville, June 10, the 97th held the most exposed position and bore the brunt of the fight until the gunboats could get into position and open an effective fire. The physical condition of the regiment in the fall of that year was very poor, and its members suffered severely with intermittent fever, five hundred men being on the sick list at one time, while there were also many cases of yellow fever, a number of which proved fatal. In April, 1863, it was at Folly Island, Charleston Harbor, during the bombardment of Fort Sumter. One of the most humane acts in war history, and one which displayed the true bravery and true courage of a band of soldiers, more than any fighting against odds, or any other war peril could possibly do, was performed at the storming of Fort Wagner. The 54th Massachusetts Regiment (colored) led the assaulting column and suffered dreadfully under the murderous fire from the fort. When the attack failed, Companies C and D (Concordville Rifles), stacked their arms, and during the entire night busied themselves carrying off the wounded colored soldiers, urged on in their work of mercy by Brig. Gen. Stevenson with the oft repeated words, \"You know how much harder they will fare at the hands of the enemy than white men.\" With never a thought of self, these men crawled to the very brink of the enemy's entrenchment. dragging away the wounded black men. No nobler spectacle ever lightened the dark days of the war. War may dull men's finer feelings, but then it strengthened the bonds of human brotherhood, a gospel as old as creation.\n\nThe 97th was active in the siege of Fort Wagner, which was evacuated the night of September 6, 1863. The following month it was ordered to Florida, where it was engaged mainly in destroying Confederate supply stations. In April, 1864, it was attached to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of the James, under Gen. Butler. On May 9 it led the advance on Petersburg, detailed to destroy the railroad and telegraph wires: after the accomplishment it was engaged at Swift Creek. When Beauregard, on the 18th, attacked the Army of the James, the pickets of the 8th Maine were driven back and the 97th was ordered to retake the position, which was done under a hot and destructive fire of musketry. On the evening of the 19th, when four of the companies had been driven back with fearful slaughter and the line broken, the remainder of the regiment, including all of the Delaware county companies, was ordered to regain it. The attempt to obey the command was made eagerly, and the line advanced steadily, despite holes torn in their ranks by volleys of grape, canister, and a steady fusilade of musketry. At last they were recalled, having sustained the awful loss of 200 killed and wounded. Because of its well known calmness under fire and its dauntless courage, the regiment was constantly in the advance, and on June 30th, Captain Mendenhall, of Company D. (Concordville Rifles) with 300 men from the companies, was ordered to attack the enemy's works in front of the cemetery, to divert the latter's attention from the real point of assault. The order was gallantly obeyed, the works were captured and held until nightfall, although the real attack was not made. Over one-third of the force under Mendenhall was either killed or wounded. When the mine was exploded, July 30th, Captain Hawkins (Brooke Guards), in command of five companies, successfully charged the enemy's riflepits, an attack in which Captain Mendenhall was wounded.\n\nOn the 15th of August, the regiment took part in the action at Deep Bottom, and on the 16th at Strawberry Plains. At Bermuda Hundred, on the 25th, it was attacked by the enemy while being relieved, and a part of its line was captured, which, however, was shortly afterward retaken. It participated September 28th, in the capture of New Market Heights, and the same day in the unsuccessful attack on Fort Gilmore. In a short engagement with the enemy at Darbytown Roads, on October 27, 1864, Captain George W. Hawkins was mortally wounded. Here the relation of the 97th Regiment and Delaware county ceases, for the period of enlistment expired at the end of 1864, and when the regiment was reformed but little of its original elements remained.\n\nOne Hundred Sixth Regiment. The 106th Regiment was recruited in Philadelphia during the late summer and early fall of 1861, forming part of Baker's brigade. At the battle of Ball's Bluff, the 106th was just across the Potomac on the Maryland side, but for want of transportation could not cross to the assistance of the other division, which was overpowered by superior numbers, Col. Baker being mortally wounded. At the battle of Fair Oaks it supported Kirby's battery against Magruder's assault, the latter having sworn to regain possession of the battery, as it had been formerly under his command in the United States army. Magruder's efforts, however, were unsuccessful. At Savage Station, exposed to a severe and raking fire, it withstood for nearly three hours every attack made against it. at one time being engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict with the enemy. At Antietam the regiment suffered greatly. and at a fence near Dunker church one-third of the entire body was stricken down in ten minutes. At the battle of Fredericksburg, December 13. 1862, it charged under a heavy fire to within seventy-five yards of the enemy's works, and from noon until sundown held its ground, and on May 3, 1863, came to the support of Sedgwick, commanding the Sixth Corps, at Salem Church, when the latter was engaged with overwhelming odds. At Gettysburg the 106th arrived on the field at midnight of July 1, and took up a position behind the low stone wall on the right centre of the line in front and to the left of Mead's headquarters. The next day, when Sickles' line was broken, the 106th was part of Webb's brigade, which marched to the gap in the line. As it reached the crest of the hill, the enemy, less than sixty yards away, was advancing to what seemed certain victory. The brigade, giving one close volley of musketry, charged, striking the enemy on the left flank and hurling back the advancing column, the lorith and two companies of the 2nd New York pursuing them to the Emmitsburg road. The following day it was at Cemetery Hill, stationed on the right of the Baltimore Pike, near Rickett's battery, and there remained under a terrific cannonade until the end of the battle.\n\nDuring the Wilderness campaign it saw a great deal of action, taking part in Hancock's famous charge at Spottsylvania on the morning of May 12. It was engaged in the battle at the North Anna; and in the battle of Cold Harbor, the brigade of which the 106th was a part attempted to drive the enemy from its entrenchment, but was unsuccessful. The troops, dropping to the ground, remained there until night, when they threw up a breastwork which they held. The last engagements participated in by the regiment were before Petersburg, June 14, 1864, and the Jerusalem Plank Road a week later. The regiment was mustered out of service September 10, 1864.\n\nOne Hundred Twelfth Regiment (2nd Artillery). On the recommendation of Gen. McClellan, Charles Angeroth, of Philadelphia, in October, 1861, was authorized by the Secretary of War to recruit a battalion of heavy infantry, later enlarged to a regiment the 2nd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery, 112th of the line. On February 25, 1862, seven companies were ordered to Washington, where they remained in the fortification until the spring of 1864. By this time the regiment had been so increased that it numbered 3,300 men, and was divided into two regiments. The second body, receiving the name Second Provisional Heavy Artillery, was dispatched to the front, and as infantry was assigned to the Ninth Corps. It participated in all the battles of the Wilderness campaign and sustained great loss at Petersburg. In May, 1864, the original regiment was assigned to the 18th Army Corps, under Gen. Baldy Smith, Army of the Potomac. The story of the two divisions of this regiment entails a review of the year of battle ending with Lee's surrender. The Second division, Provisional regiment, was in hard service before Petersburg, losing about one thousand men in four months. It was part of the brigade which charged into the crater when the mine was exploded and after Fort Harrison had been captured, on September 29, 1864, the Second Pennsylvania Artillery and 89th New York were ordered to charge on Battery Gilmore, a movement which was disastrous because of lack of proper support, the 2nd Artillery losing in killed, wounded and prisoners, 200 men. The history of the regiment is indeed honorable, and its light of valor was surely hidden under a bushel when for so many months it remained in inactivity at the capitol, intrusted with the defence of the heart of the nation.\n\nOne Hundred Nineteenth Regiment, Peter C. Ellmaker, under authorization of Gov. Curtin, began recruiting for the 119th Pennsylvania, August 5th, 1862. William C. Gray, of Chester, had raised a company in Delaware county, known as the Delaware County Guards, which he offered to the authorities, to be credited to Delaware county, but was informed that the quota was full and that the company could not be accepted. Captain Gray offered the company to Col. Ellmaker, the offer was accepted, and the organization became Company E, 109th Regiment, August 10, 1862. Because of the dire need for troops, the regiment was ordered to Washington before its organization was complete, and assigned to duty at the arsenal. About the middle of October it joined the Army of the Potomac, in camp near Antietam 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, 6th Army Corps. The regiment was in action first at Fredericksburg, December 15, 1862, and although in a trying position and exposed to a heavy artillery fire, maintained its ground like a veteran command. Later, when the \"Light Division\" was formed, it was assigned to the 3d Brigade, 1st Division, under Gen. Russell. On April 28, 1863, when Hooker advanced under cover of darkness, the brigade crossed the Rappahannock at Banks Ford on pontoon boats, drove back the Confederate pickets, and held the right bank of the river. The following morning it moved forward and, driving the enemy from the riflepits, held the same until May 3, when the Confederates retreated. The 119th and 95th Pennsylvania regiments were detached and marched along the plank road in the direction of Chancellorsville. At Salem Church the 95th met the enemy, concealed in a wood, and a warm engagement at close quarters followed. The 119th, on the left of the road, was met by a vastly superior force, but stoutly maintained its position, although it suffered severely, losing 12 killed and 112 wounded out of 432 men. The following day, Sedgwick, learning that Hooker had been defeated and that the corps was outnumbered, recrossed the river.\n\nThe brigade was at Manchester, Maryland, when on July 1, 1863, it was hastily summoned to Gettysburg. At 9 o'clock that evening march was begun and was continued without halt until four the following afternoon, when the field of battle was reached. On the morning of July 3d it occupied the extreme left of the line, in the rear of Round Top, to meet any attempted flank movement, but nothing of the sort developing, the brigade was not engaged. The next day it was stationed at Little Round Top, and on the 5th was in the advance of the pursuit of the retreating army, with which it had a slight encounter at Fairfield. At this point pursuit was abandoned by Meade. but the 119th on July 13th came upon the enemy at Hagerstown, at once engaging their skirmishers, but during the night the Confederates decamped. On November 7, 1863. the Confederates held a strong position at Rappahannock Station, covering three pontoon bridges, when Gen. Russell, at his earnest request, was ordered to storm the woods. This he did in the face of a murderous fire, and carried the intrenchments with a brilliant bayonet charge, capturing the whole of the enemy. Public recognition was given to this gallant rush by Gen. Meade in his order thanking the regiment for the capture of four guns, 2000 small arms, eight battle flags, one bridge train and 1600 prisoners. The 119th lost seven killed and forty-three wounded in this short, though fierce conflict. In the wilderness campaign, on May 4th, 1864, the brigade crossed the Rapidan at Germania Ford, and at noon on the following clay entered the engagement, the 110th holding the centre. The fighting continued until nightfall, four color bearers being killed or wounded. On May 10 the fighting was very severe, and in a grand charge through a hail of bullets, grape and canister, the colors of the regiment were planted on the enemy's works, but lacking support it was forced to fall back, suffering severely on the retreat. The regiment used two hundred rounds of ammunition to a man in the terrific struggle, known as the \"Bloody Angle,\" or the \"Slaughter Pen,\" on the 12th, where the fighting continued from seven in the morning until sundown. In the eight days. May 4th-12th, out of 400 men available for duty, the regiment lost 215 killed and wounded. All during this time the 119th was led by Captains Landell and Gray, Col. Clark resuming command of the regiment on the 12th of the month.\n\nAt Cold Harbor, on June 1, the brigade received orders to feel the position of the enemy, and on the 12th lay within one hundred and fifty yards of the Confederate line, under constant fire. Major Gray, who had been in command of the regiment from the ist to the 12th, and had directed it in all the fierce fighting of that time, continued to do so at Bermuda Hundred and before Petersburg. When Early was in the Valley of the Shenandoah, the Sixth Corps was dispatched to the support of his army. On September 19th, at the battle of \\\\'inchester, the 119th drove the entire Confederate line for a half a mile until its advance was checked by the latter's falling back into a strong position. At 4 o'clock the Union line was strengthened, and. Sheridan leading it forward, drove the enemy, utterly routed. On September 20. the brigade was detached for garrison duty at Winchester, remaining there until the following November.\n\nAt Petersburg, the 119th was highly distinguished, for, with no aid whatever and under a heavy fire from front and flank, it stormed and carried a part of the enemy's intrenchments, capturing the opposing force, with artillery, small arms and colors. Col. Clark had been wounded early in the action, and the command developed upon Lieut. Col. Gray. On the 6th the fleeing enemy was overtaken in a strong position on Sailor's Creek, and the brigade, fording the stream in water waist deep, charged in a body, capturing the entire command. After marching to Danville, Virginia, to unite with Sherman's army, and after the surrender of Johnston, the regiment returned to Washington, being mustered out at Philadelphia, June 6th. On May 13, 1864, Major Gray was commissioned lieutenant-colonel by Gov. Curtin, and April 6, 1865, the president gave him the rank of lieutenant-colonel by brevet, for gallant and meritorious services before Petersburg and at the battle of Little Sailor Creek, March 10, 1865.\n\nOne Hundred Twenty-fourth Regiment. The three companies of this regiment recruited in Delaware county were Company B, (Delaware County Fusileers), Captain Simon Litzenberg, Company D (Gideon's Band), Captain Norris L. Yarnall, and Company H (Delaware County Volunteers), Captain James Barton, Jr. The regiment was for a time at Camp Curtin, but before organizing was hurried forward on August 12, 1862, to Washington. Here it was organized, with Joseph W. Hawley, of West Chester, as colonel; Simon Litzenberg, captain of the Delaware County Fusileers, lieutenant-colonel; and Isaac Lawrence Haldeman (previously on Davis's staff) first lieutenant of Gideon's Band, major; and was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 11th Corps. It reached Antietam creek on the evening of September 16, 1862, having marched all day without rations, and the hungry men were about to receive provisions when an order came summoning it to the support of Hooker, on the right wing. The fighting began in the dull gray light of the early morning, when company could hardly be distinguished from company. As it grew lighter the struggle grew more fierce and steady combat ensued until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when, after positions had been lost and recaptured several times, the enemy's guns were finally silenced. The exhausted men, who had been fighting for eight hours, on empty stomachs, were then ordered to the rear, where Gen. Hancock held them in readiness to support the batteries on the right, and there passed the night. The regiment, in its first battle, lost fifty men killed and wounded, among the latter being Col. Hawley. The 124th was subsequently assigned to the brigade commanded by Gen. Kane, and when it was transferred to the 12th Corps, Kane still continued its brigade commander, in Geary's division. It took an active part in the disastrous campaign culminating at Chancellorsville. On May 1, 1863, it held the right wing of the 12th Corps, and in the advance had pushed the enemy before until it was in danger of being flanked, when it was ordered to retire to its position of the evening previous. On May 2 it advanced along the Fredericksburg plank road, and the brigade, being unable to dislodge the enemy from their intrenchments, returned to the breastworks, which they had hardly reached, when the demoralized 11th Corps came rushing in from the extreme right wing. Geary's division immediately formed to check the pursuing enemy, and from 10 o'clock in morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon it held its position well, until, outflanked, it was compelled to retire to a second position, where it readily repulsed every attack. On the 6th it recrossed the Rappahannock, and on May 9 was forwarded to Harrisburg, where it was discharged on the 16th of the month, its term of service having expired.\n\nOne Hundred Fifty-second Regiment (Third Artillery). The Delaware county men recruited in this regiment were in the batteries ordered to the front to take part in the siege of Petersburg, being posted on the Bermuda front. The artillery regiments never received the full credit due them, because they never acted as a whole, although their conduct was just as gallant, their behavior as soldierly, and their bravery as conspicuous as any other regiment in the war.\n\nOne Hundred Sixtieth Regiment (Fifteenth Cavalry). William J. Palmer began recruiting a battalion of cavalry in Pennsylvania in the early start of August, 1862. which was subsequently increased to a full regiment. At the time of Lee's crossing the Potomac and advancing into Maryland, 250 picked men were ordered to the front, the remainder of the regiment to remain in the Cumberland valley. The detachment in the Antietam campaign did effective duty in skirmishing and scout work; and September 15 when the Confederate troops were on the retreat from Hagerstown. it charged through the village and captured thirty stragglers. The regiment was transported to Louisville, Kentucky, November 7, 1862, and a month later joined Rosecrans at Nashville. On December 26. Rosecrans, then preparing to give Bragg battle, ordered the 15th Cavalry to advance with Gen. Stanley's division, but the greater part of the regiment stacked arms and refused to obey the order. It is greatly to the credit of Delaware county that among the three hundred men who, deferring all their real or imaginary grievances until a future time for settlement, volunteered to go forward, were the following : Captain Edward Sellers ; Lieutenants Joseph R. Thomas, Edward C. Smith, Annesley N. Morton; Sergeants Isaac Bartram, Simeon Lord, Jr., Marshall L. Jones, George W. Lukins, Geoffrey P. Denis, John W. Caldwell ; Corporals Hiram P. Eves, Thomas A. Jones, Henry W. Pancoast, Benjamin Bartram ; Privates Horatio D. Snyder, Andrew J. Buchanan, Richard Pancoast, William Armstrong, Edward W. Jones, Augustus W. Markley, Samuel Trimble, Charles P. Sellers, Joseph S. Bunting, and William P. Powell. The brave and loyal conduct of those three hundred volunteers from the regiment on that occasion was the subject of a commendatory order issued by Gen. Rosecrans, and the historian Bates mentions it as follows: \"The conduct of the men who followed the gallant Rosegarten and Ward, even under the most discouraging circumstances, and met death in the face of the foe, will never cease to be regarded with admiration and gratitude.\"\n\nStanley, covering the entire right flank of the Union army with his command, attacked the enemy on the 27th, driving them nearly five miles, and on the 29th, in the engagement at Wilkinson's Cross Roads, charged the greatly superior force of the enemy and finally, overpowered, was compelled to retire, although he made one more desperate effort to dislodge them. The detachment suffered severely during the four days of the battle at Murfreesboro, when it was constantly on duty. On January 20, 1863, Rosecrans submitted a plan for the reorganization of the regiment, which was accepted, and the 15th Cavalry was thoroughly organized and equipped. On April 4, after its return to camp from a successful scouting expedition, Rosecrans received the regiment, expressing himself pleased with its good conduct and soldierly bearing. To show his good feeling toward the regiment, which had once taken exception to his orders, he detailed three of its companies to act as his personal escort, while the remainder was instructed to scout and become acquainted with the topography of the country in advance of the army. The regiment had become so expert in scouting that in January, 1865, it was especially detailed to watch the enemy, learn its movements, and harass its foraging parties. This duty brought it into frequent contact with the enemy and its conduct was uniformly commendable and meritorious. In one bold dash it captured Gen. Vance, part of his staff, 150 horses, and fifty men, besides recapturing twenty Union baggage wagons and prisoners. A week afterwards it partially repeated this daring stroke by capturing eighteen wagons, ninety mules and seventy-two of the enemy. The story of its many narrow escapes and death defying escapades while scouting about the body of the enemy, reads like a book of fiction, and the amount of information it was able to bring to the commanding general was of inestimable value, gaining frequent public praise from headquarters and more than atoning for an error committed in its youth. In pursuit of Hood's demoralized troops after the battle of Nashville, it was eminently successful and of great advantage to the Union cause, and on May 8, 1865, while searching for Jefferson Davis, near the banks of the Appalachee and Oconee rivers, it captured seven wagons, one containing $188,000 in coin, one with $1,588,000 in bank notes and other securities, one containing $4,000,000 of Confederate money, besides considerable specie, plate and valuables, belonging to private citizens in Macon. Two days later Company G captured Gen. Bragg, his wife and staff officers. At the close of the war the regiment went to Nashville, where it was mustered out of service. May 21, 1865.\n\nOne Hundred Eighty-eighth Regiment. Delaware county was represented in Companies B, C, F, E and H of the 188th Regiment, recruited out of the artillery in- 1864 as infantry and assigned to the i8th Corps, 3rd Division. It participated in the battle of Proctor's Creek, May 10, 1864, and June 1 was engaged at Cold Harbor, where it suffered heavily. On June 16 it was in the battle before Petersburg, and on the 28th it was in the force which charged and captured Fort Harrison, turning the guns of the fort upon the fleeing enemy. The same day it attacked Fort Gilmore, but was repulsed, the killed amounting to nearly sixty, and the wounded to more than one hundred. It was mustered out of service December 14, 1865.\n\nOne Hundred Ninety-seventh Regiment. This regiment was recruited under the auspices of the Coal Exchange Association of Philadelphia, and was known as the Third Coal Exchange Regiment. It was organized at Camp Cadwalader, July 22, 1864, with Captain John Woodock, of Delaware county, major, and many Delaware county men in Companies A and I. Shortly after organization it was ordered to Mankin's Woods, near Baltimore, and instead of being sent to the front as the regiment, mostly veterans, hoped, it was ordered to Rock Island, Illinois, where it was assigned to guarding prisoners of war. There were 9000 prisoners detained therein, and the duties of the 197th were so constant and arduous that the service bore almost as heavily upon the men as an active campaign, barring, of course, the casualties of battle. Immediately after the regiment's arrival at Rock Island, Captain Barton was appointed assistant provost marshal of the island, in which capacity he had direct charge over the prisoners. The prison covered about forty acres, surrounded by a board fence ten feet high, beyond which was a trench twelve feet wide, filled with water. The guard was mounted on an elevated platform on the outside of the fence, while within were barrack for the accommodation of the inmates. The prisoners were provided with comfortable clothing and food from the same larder which fed the men of the regiment, but, not-withstanding the excellent treatment, the incarceration broke many a proud Southern spirit, and melancholia and nostalgia were diseases far more destructive than an epidemic of fever, many deaths resulting therefrom. On November 11, 1864, the 197th was mustered out of service at Philadelphia.\n\nOne Hundred Ninety-eighth- Regiment. The regiment, which hundred forty-three Delaware county men among the number of Company K, was recruited under the auspices of the Union League in Philadelphia, in the summer of 1864. It required five weeks to fill its ranks. On the morning of September 19th it was reviewed before the League House, presented by that association with regimental colors, and immediately proceeded to Petersburg, where it became part of the 1st Brigade, 5th Division, 1st Corps, Army of the Potomac. On September 30, it participated in the battle of Peebles Farm, and was hardly in position when the enemy opened upon it with a heavy artillery and musketry fire, but holding its ground it finally gathered for a charge and drove the enemy from its first line of works.\n\nOn October 2 it held its lines under a fierce attack and severe fire. At the battle of Hatcher's Run, February 5, 1863, at 3 o'clock, the 3rd Brigade was being hard pressed when the 198th was ordered to its relief by Gen. Sickles, and. crossing an open field at doublequick it fell upon Mahone's \"fighting brigade.\" The enemy was repulsed, but during the night succeeded in capturing a part of the Union line by a massed attack. At the first alarm the 198th delivered a volley, and with muskets clubbed and bayonets drawn, charged the enemy in a hand-to-hand conflict, driving them back and regaining the works. At the battle of Lewis's Farm, March 29, the 198th encountered the enemy near the old saw mill, and, side by side with the 184th New York, charged the enemy across a clear field of one thousand yards, led by Gen. Sickles. The entire fire was reserved until close to the fortifications, when an effectual volley was given and the foe dislodged. The regiment's loss was appalling, it being learned later that three of the best Confederate brigades had opposed the Union troops in that engagement.\n\nOn March 31 it was in action at White Oaks Swamp and Five Forks. Its last battle was fought April 1st, when, after the Union assault had failed. Gen. Chamberlain, commanding the division, rode to Major Glenn, commanding the 198th, and asked, \"Major, can you take those works and hold them?\" The latter, turning to his forces, inquired \"Boys, will you follow me?\" and dashed forward, his troops following to a man. Twice, the color bearer was shot down, but the standard, caught up by another, was carried forward and planted on the enemy's works. For this magnificent deed Chamberlain promoted Glenn on the field, but the latter had little opportunity to enjoy his newly won honors, for later in the day he was fatally wounded. The regiment was mustered out of service at Arlington Heights, June 3, 1865.\n\nTwo Hundred Third Regiment. Delaware county was represented in the 203rd Regiment by Company B, nearly all of which was recruited as sharp-shooters for Gen. Birney's division, but upon the General's death they were disposed of as ordinary infantry. It was organized September 10, 1864, and on the 27th reached the army before Petersburg, being assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, l0th Corps, the same day. In the action at Chapin's Farm and New Market Road, the 203rd was employed in picketing Malvern Hill and escorting prisoners. On October 7 it participated in the battle, repulsing the enemy's assaults, and on the 27th was in action on the Darlington road. When the Army of the James was reorganized the 203rd was part of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 24th Corps. On December 13, 1864, it embarked on transports at Fortress Monroe and accompanied the naval expedition under Admiral Porter for the reduction of Fort Fisher, North Carolina. On January 15, 1865, when the attack on the fort was made, the regiment was in the Pennsylvania brigade which drove the enemy from the palisadings. The 203rd charged through an opening in the face of two guns, which it captured, carrying traverse after traverse, and when the 4th was charged. Col. Moore, his regiment flag in one hand and his sword in the other, fell dead while urging on his men. The fight continued from 3:30 in the afternoon until far into the night, when the enemy finally yielded. In this memorable assault the colonel, lieutenant-colonel, one captain and a lieutenant were killed, and two captains and four lieutenants wounded, among the wounded being Captain Benjamin Brooke, of Company B. Admiral Porter, in his report, pays this tribute to the men under his indirect command: \"Fort Fisher was really stronger than the Malakoff Tower, which defied so long the combined powers of England and France, and yet it was captured by a handful of men under the fire of the guns of the fleet, and in seven hours after the attack commenced in earnest.\"\n\nOn February 11, 1865, the regiment was in the advance on Wilmington, thrown out as skirmishers, and succeeded in getting possession of the riflepits in front of the enemy's works, but owing to the swampy ground and the dense underbrush the line of battle could not advance. Hence the regiment in the pits could not withdraw until night, when with cautions stealth they withdrew, a few at a time. The works were finally captured by a flank movement and the enemy compelled to abandon its fortifications. The 203rd was in active service in all the movements in North Carolina until Johnston's surrender, when it was assigned to duty at Raleigh, where on June 22, 1865, it was mustered out of service, Captain Brooke, on June 22, 1865, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\n\nTwo Hundred Thirteenth Regiment. This regiment was recruited, as was the 198th, under the auspices of the Union League Association of Philadelphia, and was organized March 2, 1865. On the 4th it was ordered to Annapolis, Maryland, where it was assigned to duty in guarding Camp Parole, part of it being ordered to Frederick City to protect the lines of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad. In April it was stationed at Washington, where it remained guarding the northern defenses of the city until November 18, 1863, when it was mustered out of service.\n\nDelaware County Militia. The northern invasion by Gen. Lee, begun September 5, 1862, aroused in Pennsylvania almost as much excitement as had the first announcement of war. It was believed that Lee in his advance through Maryland would gather many hitherto inactive sympathizers with the Southern cause to his standard, and, thus strengthened, march northward in invincible array, carrying everything before him and leaving in his wake such dreary desolation as had followed in the path of many a Union army in the south. In consequence of these forebodings. Gov. Curtin, of Pennsylvania, on September 4, 1862. ordered more military organizations to be formed, and a week later called 50,000 of the state militia to the field. The old state had responded nobly indeed when the danger was far from her door, but now that the enemy was at hand her exhausted supply of men seemed to be magically renewed, and company after company of militia was organized. William Frick, at that time a leading business man of Chester, within a few hours after the call was issued, hastened to Harrisburg to tender his services to the state in any capacity in which he might be used. Gov. Curtin immediately appointed him colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Militia, but he declined pleading that his knowledge of military tactics and movements was too imperfect to permit of the proper handling of so large a body of men, but upon the Governor insisting that he should at least be major of the organization, he was mustered into service in that capacity.\n\nSunday, as a day for religious services, was not observed in Delaware county on September 14, 1862, and it is believed that the Recording Angel will pardon the oversight, for all day preparations for sending the companies to the front were being made. On Monday, May 15, a company was fully recruited at Media, with Hon. J. M. Broomall as captain, which after being mustered in, left the following day for Harrisburg. The same day the Chester Guards, commanded by Captain William R. Thatcher, and the Mechanic Rifles, of Chester, Captain Jonathan Kershaw, left for the state capital. The two latter companies were equipped partly by the borough, which appropriated $1500 by public subscription. In Upper Darby, the Darby Rangers, Captain Charles A. Litzenberg; a company from Thornbury and Edgemont, under Captain James Wilcox; the Delaware County Guards of Concord and Aston, Captain John H. Barton; and the Upland Guards, Captain James Kirkman, were also dispatched to designated rendezvous. The last named organization had recruited so many men from the mills at Upland that the factories of that place were compelled to close, as every able bodied operator had left for the front. The blankets for the militia were supplied by Samuel Bancroft, of Upper Providence, who declined to receive any compensation whatever. While it is impossible in this work to pay tribute to all of the citizens of the county who either by their services or financial assistance served the Union cause, it is fitting at this point to say that nowhere in the state was there a more spontaneous answer to appeals for financial aid, and that on September 1st, 1862. Delaware county had sent more men to the front, in proportion to its population, than any other county in the state. The troops from this section were, after arriving in Harrisburg, assigned to various regiments and hastened to Camp McClure, at Chambersburg. The leaders seriously considered, just before the battle of Antietam. sending militia over the border line into Maryland and advancing them as far as Hagerstown, that they might be within supporting distance of Hagerstown. The companies were informed of this plan and told that if the move was made, none but volunteers would be taken forward. Again the Delaware county contingents responded bravely, less than a dozen signifying their intention of remaining behind. However, after the Union victory of September 17, 1862, when Lee retreated across the Potomac, the crisis having passed, the militia was relieved from further field service. Although never in actual battle, the value of the moral support thus rendered to the Union cause was inestimable, for besides the encouragement it offered to the leaders of the regular army, it had its effect upon foreign nations, who, had the outcome been different, or had the North suffered invasion with indifference, might have recognized the Confederate government.\n\nEmergency Troops. Hooker's defeat at Chancellorsville in May, 1863, once more aroused the hopes of the Confederate leaders that a bold, quick invasion of the northern states might terminate the war and compel the north to submit to terms of southern dictation. Gov. Curtin, who had all through the war kept in close touch with its every move, saw the threatening danger and began preparations to check its advance. Therefore, on June 12th, he issued proclamation asking the people of Pennsylvania to cooperate with him in raising a home force for the protection of the state. The mass of the people had been deceived so many times by threatened Confederate invasion, that the Governor's plan met with little favor and much opposition. It became so evident, however, that such was the intention of the enemy, that on June 15, 1863, President Lincoln called for 100,000 militia from four states, Pennsylvania's quota being placed at 50,000 men. A short time before midnight on the 15th, a Confederate force occupied Chambersburg. On Monday, June 15th, authentic information was received that Lee had invaded Pennsylvania, and for a second time since the initial call for volunteers, Delaware county was plunged into wildest excitement. In Chester a meeting was immediately held and a company recruited, the Chester and Linwood Guards consolidating, and many of the citizens, fully awake to the gravity of the situation, hastened to Philadelphia, these uniting with military organizations. In the Crozer United States Hospital at Upland, eighty convalescent Union soldiers and several men from Bancroft's Mills in Nether Providence, formed a company, with Lieutenant Frank Brown, of the 12th New Jersey, as commanding officer, and departed for Harrisburg the next day. On Wednesday they were ordered to return, transportation having been refused them at Philadelphia on the ground that they were in no fit physical condition to endure the rigors of a campaign. At Media, conditions were much the same as at Chester. On Wednesday, the 17th, messengers were sent in all directions to summon the people, and the court house bell rang out a general alarm, so that at noon a vast assemblage gathered in the courtroom, and steps at once taken for the enrollment of companies. That evening a company collected by Judge M. Broomall started for Harrisburg, Dr. D. A. Vernon and nearly every member of the Delaware County American staff volunteered and went to the front. The following day the Delaware county companies of the 124th Regiment, mustered out a month previously, again offered their services and left that night for the capital of the state, Company B, Captain Woodcock, and Company D, Captain Yarnall. The ranks not being filled, Lieutenant Buckley remained at Media to collect the recruits, following on Monday, the 21st, with a number of men. Captain James Wilcox, with a company from Glenn Mills, and Captain Benjamin Brooks, with a company from Radnor, left for Harrisburg on the 17th. John C. Beatty, of Springfield, suspended operations at his edge tool works that his employees might enlist. When the news was received at Darby on Monday, a strawberry festival was being held, which was immediately turned into a meeting and a full company organized. While the company was being recruited at the one end of the grounds, subscriptions were sought at the other for the support of the families of those who would enlist. The troops went to the front the following Wednesday morning, commanded by Captain Charles Andrews. At Lenni, thirty men joined the Media company, and on Wednesday a meeting was held at Black Horse, in Middletown, where a number of men enlisted. At Chester about fifty colored men volunteered to raise a company of their race, an offer which was not accepted.\n\nThe real seriousness of the condition of affairs was brought home to the public when on the afternoon of June 26th, Gordon's brigade of Early's division of Lee's army, occupied Gettysburg and moved onward toward Hanover and York. On that day Gov. Curtin issued a proclamation calling 60,000 militia to the field for forty days. Wild rumors filled the air, growing with each repetition, and none so wild but that it found ready ears to listen and willing lips to pass it on. On Sunday, the 28th, it was reported at Media that a Confederate force was marching toward Philadelphia, having come as far as Oxford already. Intense excitement and anxiety prevailed. By the discharge of cannon and the pealing of bells the townspeople were called to assemble. H. Jones Brooke was chairman of the meeting, with B. F. Baker secretary, Charles R. Williamson and Frederick Fairlamb collected $2300 to be used in the payment of bounties to induce enlistment and, when the people gathered, the fund was largely increased, Mr. Fairlamb pledging $1000 beyond the amount he had already contributed, if it were necessary. The greatest consternation prevailed after the report of the Confederate advance. Plate and valuables were packed for instant flight, and the money in the vaults of the Chester bank was collected and carted away by the officers of that institution to Philadelphia in order that it might be transported to New York. In Chester, on Monday, June 29th, a meeting of the citizens was held in the town hall, and, council being assembled, appropriated $10,000 for the maintenance of the families of volunteers. In answer to a call for additional men, in an hour eighty men enrolled under Captain William Frick. The store of George Baker was compelled to close for the reason that he and all in his employment enlisted in the ranks. Next day the company left for Harrisburg, its ranks swollen to over a hundred men. At Upland, on Monday morning, the 29th, the people gathered by common impulse, and in a trice a company of seventy-two was recruited, with George K. Crozer as captain. On Wednesday it went to Philadelphia, where it was attached to the 45th Regiment, Pennsylvania Militia (First Union League Regiment), Col. Frank Wheeler, and encamped for a day or two at the Falls of the Schuylkill. The regiment was soon ordered to Shippensburg, then to Greencastle, near the Maryland line, and after the retreat of Lee was stationed at Pottsville, returning home Saturday, August 22, 1863, having served longer than any other Delaware county Company of militia. At Rockdale and Lenni a company of fifty men was recruited in addition to the number already raised, and on Tuesday, July 2, was forwarded to the state capital. In fifteen days after President Lincoln's call on Pennsylvania of June 15, more than Delaware county's quota were on their way to Harrisburg. Over one thousand militiamen had been gathered to meet this new emergency.\n\nIn the meantime the Army of the Potomac was advancing steadily to meet Lee, who, learning of their approach, summoned his widely spread forces to concentrate at Gettysburg. Here he awaited the Union army, and while the militia waited for orders at Harrisburg, the armies of the north and of the south met death in a grapple at Gettysburg, and there men's bodies were strewn over the fields in more careless profusion than seed had been formerly strewn, and were watered by their blood as plentifully as spring showers moistened the crops in peaceful days. Here the battle was fought that dwarfed the slaughters of the Old World, that made Agincourt, Waterloo and Marathon seem but as a skirmishing of picket lines, and here the whole tide of the war turned in favor of the north, while the gallant southern soldiers, defeated in body but unconquered in spirit, retreated, to fight for two years with a courage that was admirable, for a lost cause. The militia companies from Delaware county were distributed as follows: Company C (Captain Broomall), Company F (Captain Woodcock), Company G (Captain Bunting), Company A (Captain Andrews), and Company I (Captain Platt, Captain Yarnall having been appointed lieutenant-colonel;, were assigned to the 29th Regiment, and stationed for a time at Huntingdon. Company G (Captain Brooke) was assigned to the 28th Regiment, Company A (Captain Frick), and Company F (Captain Huddleson), joined the 37th and were at Harrisburg, Carlisle, Shippensburg, and on the Maryland line; while Company F (Captain Black), was assigned to the 47th, Col. Wickersham, and was stationed at Williamsport, afterwards at Reading, and later in the mining regions of Schuylkill county, where outbreaks were feared. All the companies from Delaware county returned between the 1st and 5th of August, excepting Captain Crozer's, which, as has been said, was kept in service three weeks longer.\n\nIn addition to the service of Delaware county companies in the regiments named, there were many men from Delaware county, who entered and served in other Pennsylvania regiments and in regiments from other states. Ten physicians from the county served as surgeons in army and navy, and Delaware countians served in the 6th California, 48th Illinois, 6th New Jersey, 43rd Pennsylvania (1st Artillery), 64th Pennsylvania (4th Cavalry), 65th Pennsylvania (5th Cavalry), 66th Pennsylvania, 17th Pennsylvania (6th Cavalry, Rush's Lancers), 71st Pennsylvania (California three years service), 72nd Pennsylvania, 77th Pennsylvania (Baxter's Zouaves), 88th Pennsylvania, 89th Pennsylvania, 95th Pennsylvania, 99th Pennsylvania, 113th Pennsylvania, 118th Pennsylvania. 161st Pennsylvania. 181st Pennsylvania. Service in these regiments was arduous and many of their killed and wounded were men from Delaware county.\n\nAs soon as the government announced that colored men would be recruited, a number of men of that color, living in Delaware county, enlisted, although no colored company was enlisted from the county. The colored soldiers served in the regular United States army in the 3rd, 6th, 13th, 32nd, 177th regiments, and in the 54th Massachusetts. Drafts were made in several of the townships in Delaware county, the last time the fatal wheel turning being April 7, 1865. The men who were drafted in Upper and Lower Chichester responded and the greater part of them were held for service. On April 13, Secretary Stanton ordered all enlistments and drafting discontinued in every part of the country, and on April 25 the drafted men of Delaware; county were ordered to return to their homes.\n\nThe Navy. It is extremely difficult to treat the subject of the naval representatives of Delaware county who took part in the Civil War, with any degree of thoroughness, for the reason that enlistments in the navy were not made, as in the army, in bodies. An entire company was not assigned to one ship, probably but a few from the same county seeing service on the same vessel. It will, therefore, be impossible to mention the numerous enlistments, but only to give a brief sketch of the county's sons who have gained a degree of prominence in the service. The most noted family in the county whose name appears in naval warfare annals of the United States, is the Porter family, those remarkable sea captains Commodore David, the father; William David, Admiral David D. and Lieutenant Henry Ogden, his sons. The county likewise claims credit for Admiral Farragut, the hero of Mobile and New Orleans, who resided in Chester at the time of his appointment, and who was there educated.\n\nThe most noted of Porters to serve in the navy was Admiral David D. Porter, who is said to have been born in Philadelphia in 1813, but in a letter regarding the date stone on the Porter (Lloyd) house in Chester, he speaks of Chester as his birthplace. His boyhood was spent in Chester, and in 1829 he entered the United States navy as midshipman. He took part in the Mexican war, was in command of the Powhattan, of the Gulf Squadron, in 1861. He commanded the mortar boat fleet in the attack on the forts defending New Orleans in 1862, and did valiant service on the Mississippi and Red rivers in 1863 and 1864. He was a conspicuous figure at the siege of Vicksburg, and was there created a rear-admiral. In 1864 he was in command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and rendered most important service at Fort Fisher, in January, 1865. In 1866 he was created vice-admiral, and in 1876 admiral. His father, Captain David Porter, was one of the brightest ornaments of the early United States navy, and in the Essex, which he rendered famous in a battle with two British war vessels off the coast of Chili, he captured many prizes during the war with England, 1812-1814.\n\nWilliam David, brother of Admiral David D. Porter, was also a noted naval commander in the Civil War, and was so badly scalded by escaping steam that he ultimately died of its effects, May 1, 1864. This was in the attacks on Forts Henry and Donelson. Later, though in feeble health, he ran the batteries between Cairo and New Orleans, took part in the attack on Vicksburg, destroyed the dreaded ram \"Arkansas,\" near Baton Rouge, and assisted in the attack on Port Hudson. Theodoric Porter, another brother of the admiral, was killed in a skirmish with the Mexicans, April 18, 1846. It is said that he stayed out of camp the night before the battle of Palo Alto, and that his body was found the next morning, with several dead Mexicans lying around him.\n\nAnother brother, Henry Ogden Porter, was acting lieutenant in the navy during the Civil War, and fought his vessel, the gunboat \"Hatteras,\" off Mobile, in an engagement with the \"Alabama,\" until she sank, her flag proudly flying as she disappeared beneath the wave. He was rescued and died near Washington about 1870.\n\nAnother brother, Hamilton, was lieutenant in the navy, died of yellow fever, August 10, 1844. These Porter boys lived in Chester, and after the marriage of David Porter to Evelina, daughter of Major William Anderson, they lived in the historic old Lloyd house in Chester, purchased by Major Anderson and conveyed to David Porter, February 24, 1816. After the Porters ceased to use it as a residence, it passed through a variety of tenants until 1862, when it was leased to Prof. Jackson, a manufacturer of fireworks. On Friday morning, February 17, 1882, fire was discovered in the kitchen of the old building, and later an explosion of powder stored in the building, killing eighteen and wounding fifty-seven persons.\n\nCommodore Pierce Crosby, of Chester, entered the navy June 5, 1838, as midshipman, and at the outbreak of the Civil War held the rank of lieutenant. He was employed in Chesapeake Bay and the sounds of Carolina, and was complimented by Gen. Butler for his conduct at the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark. In April, 1862, he was in command of the gunboat \"Pinola,\" and during the night of the 23rd that vessel and the \"Itasca\" led the fleet when Farragut determined to run by Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and broke through the barrier of chains stretched across the Mississippi at these forts. He was at the capture of New Orleans, April 25, 1862, and when Farragut and his fleet ran the batteries at Vicksburg, June 30, and returned July 15, the same year, Crosby, in command of his vessel, shared in the glory of that daring deed. On September 13, 1862, he was promoted to captain, and during the year 1863-64, did effective service in command of the \"Florida\" and \"Keystone State.\" Rear Admiral Thatcher, in his dispatches of April 12 to the Navy Department, said, \"I am much indebted to Commodore Crosby, who has been untiring in freeing the Blakeley river of torpedoes, having succeeded in removing one hundred and fifty. A service demanding coolness, judgment and perseverance.\" In the year 1872 he was in command of the frigate \"Powhattan,\" and in 1877 was ordered to the navy yard at League Island, retaining command there until 1881.\n\nCommodore DeHaven Manley, son of Charles D. Manley, entered the United States navy September 25, 1856, and rose step by step until he reached the rank of commander April 5, 1874. Captain Henry Clay Cochran was appointed second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, and passed the examination August 29, 1861, but his youth prevented his being at once commissioned. He served as master's mate until March 10, 1863, when he was commissioned second lieutenant. On October 20, 1865, he was promoted first lieutenant. During the war he was in active \"service under Admirals Goldsborough, Dupont, Farragut, Porter and Lee, in the Atlantic Gulf and Mississippi squadrons.\n\nCASUALTIES TO DELAWARE COUNTIANS.\n\nTwenty-sixth Regiment.
