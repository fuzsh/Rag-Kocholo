        "text": "DECKER, HENRY S. (1833-1869). Second lieutenant, 8th New York Infantry, Company G. Decker was born in New York. After enlisting at New York City as a second lieutenant, he was commissioned into the 8th New York on April 23, 1861, and mustered out on August 2 of that year at New York City. The Mortuary Table for 1870 lists him as a clerk. He was a Freemason; members of his lodge were invited to attend his funeral. According to his obituary in the New York Herald, his death was due to a tumor. In 1893, Helen Decker, who is interred with him, received a pension, certificate 405,041. Section 190, lot 18207.\n\nDECKER, JOHN HULL (1845-1901). Private, 102nd Pennsylvania Infantry, Company I. Decker, who was born in Pennsylvania, enlisted as a private on August 16, 1861, mustered into the 102nd Pennsylvania that day, and was discharged for disability on February 28, 1863. His application for an invalid pension was granted, certificate 290,230. He last resided at 175 Underhill Avenue in Brooklyn. He died from phthisis. Josephine Decker applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1901, certificate 530,446. Section 196, lot 30809, grave 2.\n\nNavy medical records for Decker state he was injured in the engine room on April 29, 1862, when his fingers were caught between two pieces of heavy machinery, but he suffered no fracture and returned to duty on May 2. He returned to the ship’s infirmary on June 24, 1862, with conjunctivitis of the left eye that, according to the surgeon’s “medical survey,” did not stem from his service. He was discharged to the Naval Hospital in Brooklyn on October 15 and admitted there on October 25. The records again affirmed that the condition did not originate in the line of duty. Decker was discharged from the hospital on March 9, 1863; the surgeon’s certificate declared him unfit for duty due to chronic conjunctivitis. His pension records indicate he was officially discharged in June 1863. Decker re-enlisted in September 1864, served on the USS Grand Gulf, and was discharged in October 1865.\n\nDecker is listed as a smith in the 1865 Brooklyn Directory and a machinist in the 1867-1870 Brooklyn Directory; he still lived on Oakland Street. He is reported as an engineer in the 1870-1873 Brooklyn Directory, as a seaman in the 1873-1876 Brooklyn Directory and as a smith in the 1877 New York City Directory. The census of 1880 lists him as a sailor.\n\nHe applied for an invalid pension in 1886, claim 10,881. Decker cited disease of the eyes, recording that in April 1862, while in San Francisco, California, and aboard the Lancaster, he contracted conjunctivitis from washing from the same bucket in which others washed and that has now lost the sight of his left eye and badley (sic) affected his right eye. He indicated on the affidavit that he was unable to work as a blacksmith and could only work as a laborer; Navy records disputed his claim as to the origin of his disease. An inscription on his gravestone confirmed his service aboard the USS Lancaster. His last residence was at 351 Sackett Street in Brooklyn but he died at the Kings County Almshouse. Section 3, lot 21025, grave 36.\n\nDeCOSTA, ROBERT F. (1842-1875). Musician, 53rd New York Infantry, Company B. DeCosta, who was born in Massachusetts, was a clerk according to the census of 1860. According to the muster rolls, he was 5′ 4″ tall with blue eyes, brown hair and a fair complexion. He enlisted as a musician at New York City on August 31, 1861, mustered into the 53rd New York the same day, and mustered out on March 21, 1862, at Washington, D.C. As per the census of 1870, he was a store clerk. He last resided at 53 Broadway in Manhattan. According to records, he died of phthisis. Section 15, lot 17263, grave 27.\n\nDEERING, JOHN (1830-1907). Private, 102nd New York Infantry, Company I. An Irish native, Deering served as a private in Company I of the 102nd New York according to his pension record. Further details are unknown.

Section 105, lot 2912.\n\nDEFENDORF, WILSON (1812-1891). Captain, 6th New York Heavy Artillery, Company K; 10th Veterans Reserve Corps, Company D. A New Yorker by birth, Defendorf was a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy from 1835-37 according to his pension record. As per the New York Directory for 1857, he had a stock brokerage, Defendorf & Co., at 125½ Bowery and lived in Tarrytown, New York. Also successful as a realtor, he purchased and enlarged a house along the Hudson River in Upper Nyack, New York, which dated to 1730 on a 14-acre property.\n\nHe enlisted as a captain at Yonkers, New York, on August 25, 1862, and was commissioned into the 6th New York Heavy Artillery, a regiment that he raised, on September 10. As per his obituary in the New York Sun, the regiment, after two months in Yonkers, went to Baltimore, where they camped at Stewart’s Mansion, then to Camp Wellington, and from there to Harpers Ferry for six months. They were then sent to Fort Reno, Maryland, and then to Warrenton, Virginia. That obituary notes that Defendorf was promoted to quartermaster, serving in that capacity for seven months before being sick from overwork and sent to Washington, D.C., for three months before his transfer to the Invalid Corps. His pension record also indicates service in Company K of the 135th New York but that unit, raised in August 1862, and known as the Anthony Wayne Regiment of Infantry, became the 6th Artillery as of October 2, 1862. He was transferred into the 10th Veterans on September 11, 1863, from which he was discharged.\n\nAs per an article on the Defendorf’s estate in the White Plains Journal News on September 4, 1975, Defendorf returned after his military service to the house with its new wing, decorated with the most handsome furnishings of the day. Among his Civil War mementoes that were included in the décor were his regiment’s battle flag, his discharge certificate signed by Ulysses S. Grant, and a panoramic map of the Battle of Gettysburg, where his regiment fought with distinction. His spurs and battle sword along with family bibles were also prominently displayed.\n\nAt the time he applied for a passport in 1871, he was 5′ 5″ tall, with blue eyes, dark hair, a florid complexion, small nose and mouth, round chin, and high forehead. Defendorf’s obituary in the New York Evening Post states that he was one of the wealthiest residents of Rockland County, raised Company K of the 6th New York, and had “a good record for gallant service.” A resident of Upper Nyack, New York, at the time of his death, Defendorf Lane there is named for him. In 1918, Mary Defendorf applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 874,139. At the time the aforementioned article about the Defendorf estate was written in 1975, the property was seven acres and was preserved and lived in by descendants. Section 109, lot 8249.\n\nDeFRIESE (or DEBRIESE), GEORGE W. (1831-1906). Private, 5th New York Heavy Artillery, Company A. A native of New York City, the census of 1850 lists him as a silversmith. DeFriese enlisted as a private on August 15, 1864, at East Fishkill, New York, the same day that he mustered into the 5th New York Heavy Artillery. As per his muster roll, he was a teamster who was 5′ 5½” tall with blue eyes, black hair and a light complexion. He mustered out on June 22, 1865, at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.\n\nAccording to the New York City Directories of 1879 and 1891-1892 and the census of 1900, he was a silversmith. His pension application was approved in 1901, certificate 1,039,377. DeFriese last lived at 357 Quincy Street in Brooklyn. DeFriese died from pneumonia. His tombstone was inscribed in part, “A Faithful Union Soldier.” Anna C. Slater-DeFriese, his wife, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1906, certificate 620,136. Section 174, lot 17495, grave 3.\n\nDEGHUEE, HENRY JOSEPH (1840-1883). Rank unknown, 13th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company D. Born in Germany, he enlisted on April 23, 1861, mustered into the 13th Regiment, and mustered out on August 6, 1861. He is likely the Henry Deghuee listed as working in segars (cigars) at 162 Montague Street in the 1864 and 1865 Brooklyn Directories. His last residence was 420 Bergen Street in Brooklyn. In 1909, Emma Deghuee applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 696,073. Section 108, lot 3355.\n\nDeGROOT, GEORGE GORDON (1841-1865). First sergeant, 127th New York Infantry, Company D. DeGroot was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1862, he married Elizabeth O’Neil Ryder; they had one daughter. DeGroot enlisted at Brooklyn on August 20, 1862, as a sergeant, and mustered into the 127th New York, popularly known as “the Monitors,” on September 8. The 127th was recruited principally from Long Island and New York City. The regiment first participated in the defense of Washington, D.C., then left for Suffolk, Virginia. DeGroot repeatedly wrote to his brother Nicholas during his service, recording his perspective on the Civil War and offering a window into his personality. He wrote on November 9, 1862, from Upton, Virginia: “Us boys tore down a nice house…to floor our tents with, also his barn. There was of course no owner and no one disturbed us. It looks a shame, but wood has got to come from somewhere.” The following three excerpts express his feelings: On November 19, 1862, from Falls Church, Virginia, “A soldier is Uncle Sam’s nigger, and it don’t much matter where or what they do with them.” On January 16, 1863, he wrote, “I have had some trouble with some of the NY roughs, but I get along now first rate.” And, on February 11, 1863: “Bill Murphy cut two of his fingers off with the axe. This is soldiering in reality.”\n\nDeGroot’s letters continued to express his frustration as the fighting dragged on. On April 26, 1863, he wrote from Suffolk, Virginia:\n\nWe capture a few prisoners every day. One of the officers captured the other day (with the 6 pc artillery) said that it was a great feat to capture a few half-starving men, and what belong to us, as it seems the guns were captured from us at Bull Run….One house which the rebels kept in, our shells could hardly reach, and there was a 50-day furlough offered to the man that would burn it. It made a splendid fire last night so I presume somebody is lucky.\n\nOn May 19, 1863, he told his brother that his regiment was strict and that “I have been under arrest only once, 7 months ago for swimming across the Potomac.” In the wake of the Battle of Gettysburg, the 127th marched from Virginia to Frederick, Maryland, where he wrote to his brother on July 12, 1863, “All the men have either no shoes or no coat, some no hats and others hardly any pants….I wore no shirt at all up the peninsula.” In September 1863, the regiment headed to Charleston Harbor. He described Fort Sumter on September 9, 1863: “The rampart & fort looks more like a badly damaged cheese than old Sumpter (sic).” On October 15, 1863, he was promoted to first sergeant of his company. DeGroot wrote about the challenges related to his promotion which sometimes involved acting as orderly sergeant. He wrote on October 17, 1863: “I now have to make the men toe the mark or be reduced, and quite often risk my life in fights with them, as I have a rough company, and it takes a rough man to deal with them.” (He had previously written to his brother on March 20, 1863, “I am just the man to drill conscripts or niggers.”) His eagerness to fight was expressed in a letter to his brother on March 4, 1864, “To run a rebel through with a bayonet is fun and I could do it with a clearer conscience than I could killing a pig.”\n\nHis letters included descriptions of Fort Wagner and sketches including ones of his shanty at Coles Island on January 12, 1864, and of Fort Sumter on May 2, 1864. DeGroot’s first real action in battle came on July 31, 1864, in a failed amphibious assault on Fort Johnson, South Carolina. He wrote, “It looked like a much better chance for our lives & victory besides in landing than to row through their heavy fire against the tide, with the name of defeat besides.” After a Long Island newspaper was critical of the 127th in this assault, he wrote, “Some think of lynching the editor when caught.” Suffering from chronic health problems and several hospitalizations, he wrote, “I almost think at the rate I am losing strength, that David Jones locker will soon come.” He returned to the regiment in November 1864 after a furlough home. On December 29, 1864, 1864 he was badly wounded in action at DeVeaux’s Neck, South Carolina (also known as the Battle of Tulifinny), and died of his wounds on January 14, 1865, at the General Hospital in Hilton Head, South Carolina.\n\nHis obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on April 5, 1865, noted his death in South Carolina and extended an invitation to friends and family to attend his funeral. DeGroot was interred at Green-Wood on April 7, 1865; the funeral was held at the home of his parents at 147 Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. Elizabeth DeGroot applied for a widow’s pension on July 6, 1865. An archive of his letters and drawings was sold at auction in January 2016. Section 158, lot 16201.\n\nDEGRUSHE (OR DEGRUSHI, DeGRUSHE), JOHN B. (1842-1908). Private, 145th New York Infantry, Company I; 107th New York Infantry, Company H; Veteran Reserve Corps. Degrushe, who was born in Westchester County, New York, was a printer at the time he entered service. He was 5′ 6″ tall with blue eyes, dark brown hair and a fair complexion. He enlisted at New York City as a private on August 14, 1862, and mustered into the 145th New York on September 11. Although his muster roll indicates that he was present as a corporal on April 10, 1863, there is no evidence of a promotion on his soldier records. Further, his muster roll states that he subsequently held the rank of private when he was sick in Carver Hospital at Washington, D.C., as of April 26, 1863; he was still in the hospital on August 29, 1863. He returned to the muster rolls when he was transferred into the 107th New York on December 9, 1863. He transferred into the Veteran Reserve Corps on February 11, 1864, from which he was detached to Company H of the 1st New York. On July 14, 1865, he mustered out at Elmira, New York.\n\nAs per the census of 1870, he was a letter carrier; the 1877 New York City Directory identifies him as a printer. The census of 1880 reports that he was a clerk in a store. In 1890, his application for an invalid pension was granted, certificate 881,488. The Brooklyn Directories for 1892-1894 and 1894-1896 list him as a collector living on South 1st Street. His last address was on Reid Avenue in Brooklyn. His death was caused by emphysema. In 1916, Adelaide Degrushe applied for a widow’s pension from Georgia, application 1,076,761, but no certificate number is indicated. Section 199, lot 28937, grave 1.\n\nDE HAAS, MAURITS FREDERIK HENDRIK (1832-1895). Marine painter. Born in Rotterdam, Holland, he studied there and in The Hague, made sketches of English and Dutch coasts, then painted as artist to the Dutch Navy. His paintings of this period were mainly of the English Channel and the French coast; titles include Storm Off the Isle of Jersey and After the Wreck. He came to New York City in 1859 and settled there.\n\nDuring the Civil War, De Haas painted several naval scenes for Admiral David Farragut, including Farragut’s Fleet Passing the Forts Below New Orleans. He was one of the original members of the American Society of Painters in Water-colors, and won renown for his coastal scenes. His paintings were exhibited at the National Academy of Design (of which he was a member), the Boston Athenaeum, and the Maryland Historical Society. He was a tenant in the Tenth Street Studio Building 1864-1895. Section 184, lot 27875.\n\nDeHANNE, JEAN VICTOR (1834-1904). Major and captain by brevet; assistant surgeon, United States Volunteers, Medical Staff; private, 176th New York Infantry, Company B. A New Yorker by birth, he enlisted at Brooklyn as a private on October 7, 1862, mustered into the 176th New York two months later on December 18, and was discharged for disability on September 22, 1863, at New Orleans, Louisiana. On December 21, 1864, he re-enlisted as an assistant surgeon and was commissioned immediately into the United States Volunteers Medical Staff, participated in General William T. Sherman’s March to the Sea and the burning of Atlanta, and served until May 28, 1867. On June 3, 1867, he was brevetted captain and major for “faithful and meritorious service.”\n\nDeHanne subsequently served in the United States Army as an assistant surgeon until he retired on February 26, 1891. During that service, he was in Kansas at Fort Riley during the Indian Wars, and was at various Army posts in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma (then Indian territory), and also served at Fort Mackinac, Michigan, and Fort Concho, Texas. DeHanne is identified as a surgeon in the 1894-1896 Brooklyn Directory; during those years, he lived at 486 7th Street. He last lived in White Plains, New York. His death was attributed to stomach cancer. His widow, Sarah Rowley DeHanne and one son survived him. Section 71, lot 826, grave 1.\n\nDEININGER, GEORGE C. (1840-1911). Private, 55th New York Infantry, Company I; 3rd Light Artillery United States Army, Company C. Born in Germany, Deininger immigrated to New York in 1846. He enlisted as a private at Staten Island on August 22, 1861, mustered into the 55th New York six days later, and was wounded in action at Williamsburg, Virginia, on May 5, 1862. After his discharge on December 10, 1862, he mustered into the United States Army’s 3rd Light Artillery, and was discharged on February 16, 1864, by reason of reinstatement at Stevensburg, Virginia. His muster roll for that enlistment states that he was a tinsmith who was 5’6½” tall with a dark complexion.\n\nAs per the censuses of 1870 and 1880 and the Brooklyn Directory of 1872 and 1882, Deininger was employed as a watchman. The Brooklyn Directory of 1888-1889 shows that he was employed as a laborer. He sought a pension in 1889, application 730,607, but there is no certificate number. His pension record indicates that he also served in Company A of the 13th New York but it is unclear when he served in that unit. The Veterans Census of 1890 confirms his service during the Civil War. It is possible that he is the George Deininger who is identified as a painter in the Brooklyn Directory for 1890-1892. On December 19, 1896, he became a naturalized citizen. In 1910, the census shows that he was working as a janitor. He last resided at 5020 Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn. Deininger died from nephritis. Emma Deininger, who is interred with him, applied for a widow’s pension in 1919, application 1,110,676. Section B, lot 11005, grave 18.\n\nDeKAY, SIDNEY BROOKS (1845-1890). Major by brevet; first lieutenant, 8th Connecticut Infantry, Companies B and G; private, 71st Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company I. Born in New York, and the son of a Naval officer, George Coleman DeKay, Sidney DeKay first served for 30 days as a private in the 71st Regiment, New York State National Guard, in 1863. A year later, while a resident of New Haven, Connecticut, he enlisted as a first lieutenant on May 16, 1864, and was commissioned into Company B of the 8th Connecticut nine days later. Reporting from the field in Virginia, on January 8, 1865, Major General Benjamin Butler commended DeKay, aide-de-camp, for his cool courage and daring during the assault against Fort Fisher, North Carolina, on December 25-27, 1864. On March 13, 1865, he was brevetted to major. DeKay was transferred to Company G on July 1, 1865, and mustered out on December 12, 1865, at Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nThe 1872 Brooklyn Directory lists DeKay as a lawyer; in 1874, he was the military secretary to Governor John A. Dix. An article in the New York Daily Graphic on November 6, 1876, states that he was a United States Commissioner (pre-cursors to federal magistrates) investigating the collision in December 1875 of the White Star Line’s ocean liner Adriatic and the Harvest Queen, a sailing vessel, in which all lives were lost aboard the latter vessel. He is identified as a lawyer living in Staten Island in the 1875-1876, 1876-1878, 1879-1880 New York City Directories, the census of 1800, and the Phillips’ Business Directory for 1881-1882. The Veterans Schedule of 1890 validates his military service in the Civil War; he then lived in New Brighton, Staten Island. According to the 1891-1892 New York City Directory, his law practice was at 115 Broadway, the same address as in all the directories after 1881.\n\nAccording to his obituary in The New York Times, he was a member of the Loyal Legion, a fraternal organization of Union officers and later, their descendants, formed after the death of President Abraham Lincoln to thwart threats to national security; members of the organization were invited to attend his funeral. His brother, J. K.

On May 5, 1862, he was wounded in battle at Williamsburg, Virginia. Upon his promotion to major on October 8, 1862, he was transferred to the Field and Staff. On May 8, 1863, commanding officer Colonel Samuel B. Hayman complimented DeLacy’s leadership at Chancellorsville, Virginia, when he wrote that he was “active in rallying his men, and sustained his well-earned reputation acquired in other scenes of strife…” He mustered out of the 37th at New York City the next month on June 22.\n\nDeLacey continued his service when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on November 3, 1863, and commissioned into the 164th New York’s Field and Staff.

He was brevetted brigadier general on March 13, 1865, “for gallant and meritorious services.” On March 25, 1865, he was severely wounded on the picket-line at Petersburg, Virginia. Brigadier General William Hays, United States Army, wrote about the injury in his field report three days later stating, “This is the third or fourth time this meritorious officer has been wounded during the War.” He mustered out on July 15, 1865, at Washington, D.C.\n\nOn July 7, 1866, his application for an invalid pension was granted, certificate 75,791. DeLacy became a naturalized citizen on October 25, 1867. The census of 1870 states that he worked at the U.S. Custom House; the New York City Directory for 1877 and the census of 1880 indicate that he was a printer. The 1880-1882 Brooklyn Director shows that he was an assessor at the Municipal Building and a printer on John Street in Manhattan; during those years, he lived at 360 Dean Street in Brooklyn. He is also listed as a printer in the Phillips’ Business Directory for 1881-1882. As commander of his local G.A.R., he attended a meeting at the St. James Hotel to raise money to fund a home for ex-Confederate soldiers in Richmond, Virginia. According to the article in the New York Herald on April 6, 1884, a performance of Richard III would be held at the Metropolitan Opera for that purpose.\n\nAs per his obituary in the Sag Harbor Express, DeLacy served as an assessor for many years and was the chief clerk at the Key West Naval station at the time of his death; the obituary also confirmed his service in the Potomac region during the Civil War and his war wounds. His last residence was in Maplewood, New Jersey, where he died of gangrene. Maria Wilcox DeLacy, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1899, certificate 503,404.

Major general by brevet; brigadier general, United States Army. Born in New York City, and one of fourteen children, Delafield graduated first in his class of twenty-three from the United States Military Academy, class of 1818. As a West Point cadet in 1815, he was detailed as an acting assistant professor of mathematics. Commissioned as a lieutenant into the Corps of Engineers, he was one of the topographical engineers assigned to establish the northern boundary under the Treaty of Ghent which was signed after the War of 1812. He was then an assistant engineer for the construction of the defenses at Hampton Roads, Virginia (1819-1824), was in charge of surveys in the Mississippi delta region until 1832, and then designed the first cast-iron tubular arch bridge in the United States when he was superintendent of repairs on the Cumberland Road east of the Ohio River. Appointed superintendent of the Military Academy in 1838, he designed the new buildings and cadet uniforms with a distinctive castle insignia. He also introduced equestrian exercises at the Academy, giving cadets training for both the infantry and cavalry.\n\nDelafield was in charge of the construction of the coast defenses for New York Harbor from 1846-1855, where he superintended the building of Fort Richmond (later renamed Fort Wadsworth). He traveled to Europe with Major Alfred Mordecai and then Captain George B. McClellan to observe military operations there, was a military observer at the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, and then returned to his position as superintendent of the Military Academy from 1856 into 1861. His report on the aforementioned study trip, Report on the Art of War in Europe in 1854, 1855 and 1856 was suppressed during the Civil War because of fears that it would be useful to Confederate engineers due to its inclusion of drawings and descriptions of military fortifications.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Delafield was a lieutenant colonel beginning August 6, 1861, was promoted to colonel on June 1, 1863, and was Chief of Engineers, United States Army, with the rank of brigadier general, from April 22, 1864, upon the death of General Joseph Totten. Early in the war, Delafield, an adviser to Edwin D. Morgan, New York’s governor and a Union Army general, helped equip and send volunteers from New York to the Union Army as and was subsequently in command of defenses around New York Harbor from 1861 until April 1864. As per Cullum’s Register, a biographical encyclopedia of West Point graduates, Delafield supplied ordnance stores for the Atlantic and Lake defenses, was superintending engineer of the defenses at the Narrows entrance to New York Harbor, the fortifications at Governor’s Island, New York, and Sandy Hook, New Jersey. After the Civil War, he returned briefly to the United States Military Academy, serving until his retirement on August 8, 1866. He continued to be a member of the Commission on Encroachments of the Ocean at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, from February 20, 1864, through June 30, 1867. On March 13, 1865, he was promoted by brevet to major general for meritorious services in the Engineer Department.\n\nAfter his retirement from the military, he worked in engineering and served on two commissions related to improvements to Boston Harbor as well as to lighthouses. Delafield was also a regent of the Smithsonian Institution and a member of the Lighthouse Board. He died in Washington, D.C. His death was attributed to asthenia (abnormal loss of energy). The War Department noted his extensive lifetime achievements and concluded, “…As a tribute to his memory, the officers of the Corps of Engineers will wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty days, and the day after the receipt of this order, at West Point and Willet’s Point (an Engineer depot established by him), thirteen minute guns will be fired, beginning at noon, the national flag being displayed at half-staff during that time.”\n\nRufus Delafield’s (see) uncle, he was survived by his wife, Harriet Baldwin Covington Delafield whom he married in 1833, and five children; his first wife, Helen Summers, whom he married in 1824, died four months after their marriage. A collection of his letters, most addressed to General Joseph Totten, Chief of Army Engineers, dating 1846-1849, is housed at Syracuse University’s Library.

Acting ensign, United States Navy. A native of the Danish West Indies (his family traced their roots to France), his 1863 Draft Registration, filed under the name Louis Delen, indicates that he was white, married, lived in Manhattan and worked as a clerk. Delan enlisted as an acting ensign in the United States Navy on November 1, 1864. He resigned on April 12, 1865.\n\nIn 1866, he was living at 106 Bowery when he offered a reward for papers and a secretary desk that he had lost while moving. The 1870 census reports that he lived in Manhattan with his wife Annie and children and worked as a bookkeeper; the 1873-1876 Brooklyn Directory identifies him as a bookkeeper who lived at 1066 Pacific Street. Goulding’s Manual and General Statistical Guide for 1875, the 1894-1896 Brooklyn Directory and the 1897-1899 New York City Directory report that he was a clerk; at the time of the last named directory, he lived at 332 West 36th Street.\n\nA chess enthusiast, Delan wrote to the New York Sun in 1882 concerning moves to be made on a sample game. Interested in social issues, Delan was the “worthy conciller” of the Carpet and Furniture Employees’ Social and Benevolent Association in 1886, and placed a notice thanking employers who agreed to close their stores at 7:00 p.m. rather than remaining open later. In addition, he was elected as a delegate to the Union Labor Party’s national convention in 1888. The 1900 census reports that he lived at 216 East 85th Street in Manhattan with Mary, his wife of three years, and worked as a fur salesman; that census indicates that he had been in the United States for 50 years.\n\nHe died in Brooklyn. As per his will, filed in Kings County Surrogate Court under the name Louis P. Deland, he last lived at 442 Cleveland Street in Brooklyn, with his wife Mary. He died “by accident” and owned no personal property or real estate at the time of his death. Section 183, lot 23923.\n\nDELANO, WILLIAM H. (1832-1876). Sergeant, 176th New York Infantry, Company E.

Transferred to Company K of the same regiment on October 18, 1863, he was simultaneously promoted to second lieutenant. Discharge was for disability on September 26, 1864.\n\nHe likely is the Alexander D’Elom who is listed in the candies business in the 1866 Brooklyn Directory. He successfully applied for an invalid pension in 1879, certificate 192,095. According to an article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on January 9, 1890, D’Elom was installed as officer of the day at the annual ceremonies of the Rankin Post #10 of the G.A.R. which was held at Saengerbund Hall in Brooklyn; membership totaled 325 comrades. In 1897, the New York State Senate, in its report on the Grand Army of the Republic, noted that D’Elom, an assistant inspector of Kings County, would inspect Post #286. As per Trow’s Directory for 1899, D’Elom was president of the 139th Veteran Association. At the time of his death, he resided at 1188 St. Marks Avenue in Brooklyn. His wife, Eugenie, died in 1898.

My men, however, had been cautioned to reserve their fire. I let the enemy advance till within 30 yards of us, when at my command the men poured in a deadly volley, causing great havoc among them. The enemy, terrified at such a destructive fire from an unknown quarter (for they had not suspected our presence, as we were well concealed), came to a momentary halt, which proved to be the cause of their destruction, for at this critical moment a well-directed fire from the Sixty-first and first and second battalions completed their confusion.

Anecdotally, the divorce trial in 1916 included testimony from Rudolph Valentino, who had an unspecified relationship with Jack’s wife. The murder trial was sensational; Blanca Errázuris, the divorced wife of Jack, had gone to the house, known as “The Box,” to seek custody of their son, and when Jack refused, she shot him five times. Ultimately, she was acquitted after declaring temporary insanity and arguing that her husband cheated on her, spent her inheritance and corrupted their son.\n\nDeSaulles’s last residence was in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, at 514 Delaware Avenue.

They shot their rifles and then shoveled out the trenches. That battle was part of the Union campaign to capture Port Hudson and close off a Confederate escape route.\n\nColonel William R. Miles, who commanded Miles’s Legion, was a personal friend of Henry DeSaulles, wrote to DeSaulles’s father (during the time when Miles was held as a prisoner) on August 22, 1863, “On his couch of death your son requested me to write to you concerning his fate. While at the head of his company, in the gallant discharge of his duty, he fell, mortally wounded, on the evening of the 3rd of June, 1863 [at Port Hudson, Louisiana]. The ball entered his right breast. He lingered until the night of the 4th, when he calmly passed away. I was with him most of the night of the 3rd; and at intervals, when sufficiently calm to converse, three subjects alone seemed to occupy his thoughts-his mother, his father, and his country. I cannot refrain from saying of your son, that a truer gentleman never lived, a braver soldier never died.” DeSaulles’s father later wrote that Henry’s remains were originally placed in a family fault in New Orleans and subsequently were moved to New York “and interred at Greenwood Cemetery, in a piece of ornamental ground, which I own there.” Interment at Green-Wood was on April 26, 1869.

The youngster was buried at Green-Wood in lot 3330 on January 2, 1874.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, December 5, 1876, William, Elizabeth, and their daughter Annie attended a performance of the very popular The Two Orphans at the Brooklyn Theatre in downtown Brooklyn. As the performance proceeded, with over 1000 theatregoers in attendance, scenery caught fire and panic ensued. Intially it was thought that almost all had escaped, but it soon became apparent that the death toll was in the hundreds. Sadly, William, Elizabeth, and Annie all perished, three of the 278 who lost their lives that evening.\n\nOn December 8, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on the identification of William DeShay in a piece entitled “A Tattooed Arm”:\n\nIn the midst of shrieks and sighs and sobs, in the gloom of the misty old market building [where a makeshift morgue had been set up], last evening, a woman rushed up to one of the officers on duty and demanded to be shown at once the body of William DeShay. She was daft with excitement. The officer—a kind hearted, considerate man—talked to her soothingly and told her the body had not been identified as far as he knew. Then the woman became calmer and began moving along the rows of corpses, uttering a melancholy croon and swaying her body to and fro. Suddenly she paused, and kneeling down by one of the bodies stripped the charred sleeve off the dead man’s arm. Then she sunk almost prostrate over the repulsive form. DeShad was identified. The form of a woman was tattooed in the flesh of the arm.\n\nThe remains of Elizabeth and Annie were never identified.\n\nArrangements were soon made for the interment of 103 of the victims of the fire at Green-Wood in a mass grave. These were people whose remains had not been identified or whose family could not affort their burial. As per the Brooklyn Times Union on December 9, 1876, De Shay was “[a]mong the bodies unclaimed and buried by the city in a common grave.” That newspaper also noted that DeShay had lived in Williamsburg and worked at Chapman’s Dock dredging Newtown Creek. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on December 13, 1876, that relatives of victims of the fire were at the Coroner’s office to collect property found on the site of the fire; DeShay was named with the address of 771 Frost Street.\n\nAs per records of Surrogate’s Court, he left no wife or children and was survived by his brother, John L.

He, too, was struck and injured; he died of a fracture to his tibia a short time later.

Section 22, lot 8934.\n\nD’ESTIMAUVILLE (or D’ESTIMANVILLE), FREDERICK HENRIE (1835-1865). Ensign, United States Navy. Born in Quebec, Canada, in 1833, as per baptism records, his family immigrated to the United States in 1837. (Green-Wood records 1835 as his birth year.) The family lived in Philadelphia at some point. A Brooklyn resident, D’Estimauville served in the United States Navy during the Civil War. He enlisted on November 23, 1861, and was assigned to the USS Flambeau. According to an article in The New York Times on July 18, 1862, he was a captain’s clerk on the USS Flambeau when the vessel returned to Port Royal, South Carolina, after spending eight months in the Bahamas.\n\nOn January 31, 1863, D’Estimauville was part of a foraging party sent from the Flambeau to Bull’s Island, South Carolina, when they saw eleven uniformed Confederates come out of the plantation known as Gibbes’ Farm. D’Estimauville ran and eluded capture; two of the men were captured and another successfully fled back to the ship. The next day, D’Estimauville returned to the island as part of a small search party but after one in the group was shot and another killed, the mission was called off.\n\nHe was appointed acting ensign from the state of Pennsylvania on June 24, 1863, while attached to the Flambeau. He remained on that shipuntil February 20, 1864, when he was assigned to the USS Tecumseh as of February 26. A medical note dated April 25, 1864, states that D’Estimauville was treated for catarrh and “some derangement of the liver and bowels” which occurred in the line of duty aboard the Tecumseh and was fit to return to duty.\n\nHe became an ensign on October 13, 1864, at which time he was assigned to the USS Otsego. In October 1864, he was suffering from dysentery and ordered to report to the Norfolk Naval Hospital; however due to difficulty communicating with Norfolk and poor sanitation in Albemarle Sound (the outer banks of North Carolina), he was unable to go there and went to New York instead. Records indicate that he went to his father’s residence in November 1864 and wrote to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles requesting that his illness be treated in New York despite Welles’s order that he go to Norfolk. D’Estimauville’s father wrote to Welles that they would try to comply but that his son was paralyzed. Welles then ordered that D’Estimauville be treated at the Naval Hospital in New York as of December 17, 1864. His only daughter, Frederica Rebecca Jeanne, was born in Philadelphia three days later; he had married Rebecca Newbold Richardson on March 15, 1864. It was believed that his paralysis was caused by malaria contracted in Albemarle Sound. By February 9, 1865, he was able to raise his hands to his head. On February 19, he had a swollen throat. He asked to be discharged to his parents’ home to see his wife and newborn daughter but the surgeon refused saying that his wife said “he might as well die in the hospital as anywhere else.” Nonetheless, as per records of crew members of the Tecumseh, he attempted to go see his family but he was gasping for breath in a carriage that was taking him to his parents’ house and died before he could get back inside the hospital.\n\nOn February 23, 1865, records indicate that he died at the United States Naval Hospital in Brooklyn. Rebecca D’Estimauville, his widow, first sought a pension on April 12, 1865, testifying that her husband’s illness was contracted during his Naval service. According to a letter in his pension file dated July 14, 1865, a doctor testified that D’Estimauville was treated for croup caused by exposure on the USS Flambeau. His death certificate stated that he was admitted to the hospital on December 17, 1864, with partial paralysis, seemed to be recovering and independently left the hospital on February 19, 1865. The surgeon, who signed the certificate, stated that the illness did not occur in the line of duty. His widow asserted that he wanted to go home to his family to die and contested the comments on the death certificate. Her application was approved, certificate 1,760. In 1917, she reapplied for a widow’s pension under the name Rebecca Wyllie. He is listed as a graduate of the 14th class of Central High School of Philadelphia, a well-regarded academic public school as of 1836, in a book published in 1902; that school history states that he was deceased and served in the United States Navy. Section 72, lot 8333.\n\nDE THULSTRUP, THURE (1848-1930). Artist and illustrator of Civil War battles. Born Bror Thure Thulstrup in Stockholm, Sweden, into a military family (his father was Swedish minister of war 1850-1861), he graduated from the National Military Academy there. In 1870, he went to Paris and became an officer in the French Foreign Legion. He served in Algeria and fought against Germany in 1871 during the Franco-Prussian War, rising to the rank of captain.
