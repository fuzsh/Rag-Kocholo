        "text": "Attu Island is the westernmost in the Aleutian chain, nearly 1,100 miles from mainland Alaska. Some 20 miles long and 35 miles wide, it is one of the largest in the archipelago. The Allied invasion was called Operation SANDCRAB. It was the only land battle of World War II fought on U.S. territory. The main landing force was the 7th Infantry Division (7th ID), which conducted amphibious training at Fort Ord, California in April 1943 prior to heading north. A Navy Task Force of three battleships, an escort carrier, and seven destroyers supported the landing. Two naval covering forces of cruisers and destroyers were deployed to block any Japanese attempt to reinforce their troops on the island. The Eleventh Air Force flying from Adak and Amchitka, provided 54 B-24 Liberator bombers and 128 P-38 Lightning fighters to support the invasion forces.\n\nFollowing several days of delay due to inclement weather, the 7th ID landed on 11 May at three widely separated locations on the eastern side of the island. The final objective was the main Japanese base at Chichagof Harbor. Within five hours, MG Albert E. Brown, the commander of the 7th ID had 3,500 men ashore facing what intelligence reported was less than 1,500 Japanese. The troops began to push up the valleys to climb the high ridges they had to cross to get to Chichagof Harbor. They first encountered the Japanese as they ascended.\n\nFrom well-camouflaged positions on the ridges, determined Japanese troops poured machinegun and mortar fire on the advancing Americans. The attacks rapidly turned into bitter yard-by-yard fights. Poor weather prevented effective air and naval gunfire support. Reinforcements from the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Alaska Defense Command joined the 7th ID on Attu, bringing the U.S. strength to 15,000. MG Brown was relieved on 16 May. MG Eugene M. Landrum replaced him. It took two weeks for the infantrymen to gain the high ground overlooking Chichagof Harbor. On 29 May, between 700 and 1,000 Japanese troops staged a last-ditch “Banzai” charge against the American positions. In the wild melee that followed, the Japanese were wiped out to the man. This ended organized resistance, although mop-up operations continued for several days. The bloody battle of Attu was over, but the nature of the fight would affect future Allied operations.\n\nThe American troops on Attu reported 2,351 enemy dead. Only 28 Japanese surrendered. American casualties were 549 killed, 1,148 wounded, and about 2,100 were put out of action by disease and injury, mostly trench-foot. Only the battle of Iwo Jima surpassed Attu in terms of the rate of casualties sustained by the American forces. This costly battle impacted the American approach to taking Kiska. The need for units better trained to fight in the harsh environments caused the First Special Service Force to be ordered to the Aleutians.\n\nIn March 1943, prior to the battle of Attu, the Force was still training at Fort Harrison, Montana. Two months before, COL Frederick visited MG Buckner at the Alaska Defense Command headquarters at Fort Richardson. Buckner asked the Army staff to assign the FSSF to him for the upcoming campaign, but LTG Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander in the Mediterranean, wanted the FSSF for Operation HUSKY, the invasion of Sicily. The Army General Staff decreed that prior to being committed to any theater, the FSSF would undergo amphibious training in April and May, and then be evaluated by the Army Ground Forces (AGF) command. Still unassigned, the Force marked the end of its training at Fort Harrison with a parade in downtown Helena on 6 April 1943. On 11 April they boarded five trains headed east to Virginia.\n\nCamp Bradford near Virginia Beach, Virginia, was the home of the Naval Amphibious School, (now the Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek). Army units destined for the European Theater cycled through for amphibious training. There the Forcemen learned how to board various Navy landing craft and how to exit when the vessel hit the beach. The USS Neversail, the concrete landing craft mock-up, was used for learning boarding techniques. The well-trained, cohesive Forcemen set records for the speed with which they could climb fully-loaded down the cargo nets into the landing craft. Training in the use of small rubber boats (similar to today’s RB-7s) to infiltrate ahead of the landing craft was part of the program. After Camp Bradford, the FSSF moved to Burlington, Vermont for their unit evaluation.\n\nAt nearby Camp Ethan Allen, the Force was tested on its individual and unit proficiency by the staff of the XIII Corps in accordance with AGF policy for units scheduled for overseas deployment. In conjunction with the evaluation, the FSSF received some new American volunteers, did more rubber boat training on Lake Champlain, and polished their raiding and reconnaissance skills. The unit set extremely high standards in virtually every area, and passed with flying colors. They were ready for deployment to North Africa. The movement order finally came on 9 June 1943, but it was for the Aleutians and the invasion of Kiska.\n\nThe heavy casualties on Attu convinced RADM Kinkaid that he needed additional ground forces to invade Kiska. In concert with LTG Dewitt, the request was sent to GEN Marshall, who offered the First Special Service Force for inclusion in the invasion force. MG Buckner heartily endorsed the addition of the FSSF, and after completing their evaluations, the Force loaded trains for the West Coast, departing Burlington on 26 June. On 3 July they reached San Francisco where they prepared for the voyage to Alaska.\n\nThe 2,460-man Force sailed for the Aleutians on 11 July after drawing winter clothing and equipment. One of the lessons learned on Attu was the need for adequate raingear, boots, and sleeping bags to deal with the cold, wet conditions on the islands. Canadian Private (PVT) Jack Callowhill of 1st Company, Second Regiment recalled, “We got our winter issue on the boat. The mukluks were just the thing for the muskeg.” The Force Headquarters, Second Regiment, and the Service Battalion travelled in the Liberty ship SS John B. Floyd. A sister ship, the SS Nathaniel Wyeth carried the First and Third Regiments. Liberty Ships were designed for cargo, and when converted for use as troop transport, proved slow and uncomfortable. The eleven-day voyage was a memorable one.\n\nShortly after the convoy cleared San Francisco Bay it encountered a storm that battered the ships unmercifully for four days. PVT Thomas O’Brien, 5th Company, Second Regiment said, “I was one of those who got sick on that trip, and did I ever. It was rough as hell. I never got out of my bunk for five days. That’s how rough it was. I think ninety percent of the guys were sick.” Sergeant (SGT) Kenneth Betts, 1st Company, Second Regiment recalled the chaos below decks. “On our Liberty ships, the bunks were stacked eight or ten high. We were packed in there like sardines and we were rolling so violently that the bunks were torn right off the wall. It was a hell of a mess.” PVT Kenneth Gay, 3rd Company, First Regiment, said “They had welded those bunks in and the rolling just broke the frames.” It was with undisguised relief that the Forcemen saw Adak Island on 23 July.\n\nFive Army infantry regiments were already training on Adak Island. Frederick determined that there was not room enough for the FSSF and the next day the unit sailed to Amchitka, 40 miles east of Kiska, and established a bivouac site on the island. The troops quickly became acquainted with the vagaries of the Aleutian weather and terrain. PVT Harvey Watts of 4th Company, Third Regiment remembered how difficult it was to walk on the spongy, water-logged tundra. “You would sink up to your knees with each step. The mud could pull your boots off.” Ironically, most of the Army units had the Weasel, which proved to be ideal for negotiating the soggy muskeg. The Force, for whom the Weasel was originally designed, had not brought theirs. Once ashore, the men found that establishing bivouac sites was a labor intensive exercise.\n\nThe concept of Operation COTTAGE involved amphibious landings at two locations named the Northern and the Southern Sector on the 22-mile long island. On D-Day, the first landings would be in the Southern Sector. The First Regiment, FSSF, under Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Alfred C. Marshall would infiltrate by rubber boats on the west side of the island. The Force would secure the landing beaches for the U.S. 184th and 17th Infantry Regiments. On D+1, the FSSF Third Regiment, led by LTC Edwin A. Walker would land in rubber boats farther north and secure the beachhead for the U.S. 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment and the Canadian 13th Infantry Brigade. The two landing forces would conduct a pincer movement aimed at the main Japanese base at Kiska Harbor on the east side of the island. The U.S. 53rd Infantry Regiment and the Second Regiment, FSSF were in reserve. The second Regiment’s Forcemen were at the airfield on Amchitka, ready to parachute on Kiska to reinforce either sector as needed. A key part of the operation was a feint by a naval task force on the eastern side of the island to draw the Japanese away from the western landing beaches. D-Day was set for 15 August.\n\nThree weeks prior to the invasion the Allies began a daily bombardment of Kiska from the air and sea. The Eleventh Air Force stepped up their bombing campaign and by the time of the landings had dropped 425 tons of bombs on the island. The naval task force added another 330 tons of explosives during their shelling of Kiska before the assault. The marked slackening of Japanese anti-aircraft fires at the end of July was attributed to the effectiveness of the bombardment. The invasion commenced on 15 August under a heavy naval bombardment.\n\nThe First Regiment and COL Frederick’s command group boarded the destroyer USS Kane and one Landing Ship, Tank (LST) late in the day on 13 August. The Third Regiment rode in a single LST. The three vessels joined the main convoy sailing from Adak to be in position for their assault on Kiska at midnight on the 15th. The First Regiment with their attached team of Alaska Scouts pushed away from the Navy vessels at 0030 hours and began the arduous two-mile paddle against the current. They headed for their landing site at Quisling Cove (designated Beach 9-Blue). Coming ashore at 0120 hours, the Forcemen moved quickly to secure the other two landing beaches around Quisling Cove. They set up colored panels and lamps to mark the landing zones for the Southern Sector follow-on forces, scheduled to land at 0630 hours. The other Southern Sector landing beaches were 9-Yellow and 10-Scarlet (Lily Beach). Once the beaches were secure, the Force companies moved cautiously inland to establish defensive positions on the high ground overlooking the center of the island."
