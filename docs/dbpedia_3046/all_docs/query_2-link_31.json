(The rosters of Samuel Bates’ History of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5 are confusing on this point, indicating that a “John Brinsinger” enlisted in Company A, but was not on A company’s muster-out roster. However, this soldier’s pension record and Pennsylvania Veteran’s Burial Card show that he was a member of Company G at the time of muster out. Bates’ rosters also indicate that this soldier was a Veteran Volunteer. So, it is possible that John Bransinger enlisted with Company A, but transferred to Company G – or that Bransinger initially enlisted with an entirely different regiment, and then transferred to the 47th. (There is a John Brensinger shown on the Bates’ rosters as having enlisted in Company H, 176th Pennsylvania Infantry on 3 November 1862. That John Brensinger mustered out 2 June 1863.)

His brother, Corporal Amandus Sandt (also of A Company), however, was wounded during this same engagement (struck in the hip by a bullet). In order to save his brother’s life, Private Edwin Sandt and other members of the 47th Pennsylvania helped to carry Corporal Amandus Sandt from the field to the rear of the Union’s lines while under Confederate fire. Although several members of the litter group were felled by the enemy, Private Edwin Sandt and others survived, and were able to move Corporal Amandus Sandt to the safety of a cellar in a nearby house. Private Edwin Sandt then stayed with his brother, administering medical attention while the fighting raged around them until Confederate troops captured the house where they were hiding. Deeming Corporal Amandus Sandt too critically ill to move, the Confederate soldiers left him behind while taking Private Edwin Sandt prisoner. After being held initially as a prisoner of war at the Confederate Army’s Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, Private Edwin Sandt was then transferred to the Confederate prison camp at Salisbury, North Carolina, where he was held as a POW until being released. After receiving medical treatment, he then returned to his regiment, and continued to serve with his regiment until it was officially mustered out on 25 December 1865.
