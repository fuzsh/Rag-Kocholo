In war, as in peace, Through death the path to glory lies.\"\n\n5\n\nIntroduction.\n\nAT a meeting of the Regimental Reunion Association of survivors of the 73d Illinois Volunteers, held at Decatur, October 8, 1888, it was decided that a committee, consisting of three members of the Association, be appointed to prepare a history of the regiment. The object in view, at the time, was to have such history prepared, and have it read to the Association at its next meeting. After consideration of the matter by the Association, its President, Captain Charles Tilton, appointed W. H. Newlin, D. F. Lawler, and J. W. Sherrick as the committee to prepare such history. This action, as ratified or aquiesced in by the Association, may be said to be the beginning or foundation of this work. At the same meeting, a committee consisting of W. H. Newlin, E. J. Ingersoll, J. L. Morgan, and G. W. Patten, was appointed to collect evidence and prepare a report, or history, showing the positions held and the part performed by the 73d Illinois, and incidentally by the brigade, in the campaign in Tennessee, in 1864, from Columbia to Nashville.\n\nThe work of this committee, as completed and shown in full herein, seemed to strengthen the purpose as well as justify the labor of writing a full and complete history of the regiment from the time of its entry into service until its muster out. The investigation and search made by this committee, also disclosed the existence of more material out of which to make a history of the\n\n6\n\nregiment, than was before thought, or known, to be available for that purpose. The character and reliability of the material, as well as the amount, seemed to warrant the preparation of a history for publication. The facts, the data, and all the circumstances connected in and about the service and record of the regiment, if rightly used, put in proper shape, can be made to possess an attraction for the general reader. This was the thought and impression in the minds of many members of the Regimental Association; and many members, nearly all, favored the publication. It is assumed that every survivor of the regiment will become possessor of one or more copies as soon as he learns the work is complete. Representatives or descendants of those members of the regiment who were killed, or who died during the service or since, will likewise manifest an interest in the work.\n\nSurviving comrades of those regiments that were at some time in the same brigade with the 73d, will, as a rule, and as opportunity offers, become patrons of this effort to depict common trials and dangers. Neither of the classes we have just enumerated will we denominate as the \"general reader,\" or as belonging to that class, though of course, some of them may; but we will consider them our especial friends, and of the number on whom we shall depend. And as furnishing a contribution to history, giving some of the details and minutiae of the contest, we shall surely be able to gain some appreciation at the hands of the general public. Will not the present and the oncoming generation, the youth and middle-aged of to-day and to-morrow, those who are now reaping and enjoying, and those who will reap and enjoy, the benefits and blessings purchased by the services\n\n7\n\nand sacrifices of the soldiery of the war, appreciate and remunerate our labors as here culminated?\n\nWe apprehend they will, if the result of our labors shall appear in attractive and entertaining style, and tell a plain and simple story in becoming language. The reader, of whatever class, when once started in tracing our history as an organization, will have curiosity, if not interest enough, to continue to the end of the last chapter.\n\nIt has been our desire, and effort as well, to beget and constantly maintain an interest, on the part of the reader, in the narrative from beginning to end.\n\nThat portion of this work which deals with the organization of the regiment and its earlier experiences, and the events occurring while on the way to the theater of war before the first battle, though prepared with great care, will not, perhaps, prove as entertaining as will some other portions which chronicle more stirring events. After we commence active operations and get down to business, as we begin to snuff the smoke and smell the powder of battle, the interest will awaken; and as we perform our part at Perryville or Chaplain Hills, our initial struggle, and leave that field and proceed, after a quiet interval, to Murfreesboro, and the strife amid the cedar jungles and breaks of Stone River, the interest will not lag or diminish. Then, after a season of delay and comparative repose, when offensive movements are resumed, the interest will be maintained as we move on and count off Fairfield, Manchester, Estill's Springs, Elk River, Winchester, Cowan's Station, Stevenson, Bridgeport, the Tennessee River, Sand Mountain, Trenton, and Alpine, and take up our weary march through cove and gap, and along mountain side\n\n8\n\nand top, to Chickamauga's bloody field. The interest will have grown, and sympathy added, by the time we get that dreadful strain behind us. Then comes the falling back to Chattanooga -- the picket, forage, and fatigue duty, and the siege ; scant fare for man and beast ; then the battle and the victory at Missionary Ridge; the winter campaign and slavish march to Knoxville and Dandridge ; the return, and preparation for the great summer campaign to Atlanta, in which long list of engagements the 73d scored the following: Rocky Faced Ridge, Resaca, Adairsville, Dallas, New Hope Church, Pine Mountain, Lost Mountain, Kenesaw Mountain, Marietta, Peach Tree Creek, Atlanta, Jonesboro, Lovejoy's Station; then a brief respite, and the return to Chattanooga, and the fall campaign in the heart of Tennessee, in which was put at stake all that had been gained in our previous contests. Through all, the reader will not fail to follow us, and the interest will continue and increase as we make our reconnoissances and rapid marches, and approach and pass through the skirmishes at Columbia and Duck River, the skirmishes at Spring Hill, and from thence to Franklin; and then the loosened fury, the seething hot and red holocaust, of the battle at the latter place. Then, a little later, occur the battles of Nashville, and, for us, the combat ceases. Pursuit of the flying enemy; camp-life; movement from point to point; the muster out; the return to Illinois; the final payment and disbandment, close the three years' experience; and the curtain drops. We are again -- some of us -- in civil life.\n\nThere were many difficulties encountered by the committee in prosecuting the search for facts and details, while preparing this history, though all who could\n\n9\n\ndo so were willing to assist, and many have aided and encouraged the committee in its work. There are imperfections in the work, and some errors perhaps, but no wrong or injustice is intended. For all data and memoranda furnished, whether used or not, the thanks of the committee are hereby tendered. With earnest wishes for the well-being, both here and hereafter, of all who read this book, as well as of all who participated in the services here recorded or in the like services, we close.\n\nTHE COMMITTEE.\n\nW. H. NEWLIN,\n\nD. F. LAWLER,\n\nJ. W. SHERRICK.\n\n15\n\nTHE first brigade the 73d was in, embraced three other regiments, viz.: the 100th Illinois, and the 79th and 88th Indiana, commanded by E. N. Kirk, colonel of the 34th Illinois.\n\nThe second brigade organization which included the 73d, also included the 44th Illinois and the 2d and 15th Missouri Regiments, commanded by Colonel Laiboldt and Colonel Schaefer.\n\nFor all, or nearly all, the remainder of its term of service, the 73d was associated in brigade organization with six other regiments, viz.: the 36th, 44th, 74th, and 88th Illinois, the 24th Wisconsin, and the 125th Ohio, commanded by Colonel Frank Sherman, General Nathan Kimball, and Colonel (Brevet Brigadier-General) Emerson Opdycke.\n\nThere was a brigade formed a short time before the battle of Missionary Ridge -- when the army was reorganized -- that embraced all the regiments included in the two last brigade organizations above, except the 125th Ohio. It included nine regiments, the 22nd Indiana being one of the nine; but that regiment was soon sent elsewhere. In the course of time, the 2d and 15th Missouri Regiments dropped out, and the 125th Ohio came in, leaving the seven regiments as last above named. The 21st Michigan was for a short time in our brigade.\n\n17\n\nChapter I.\n\nA HISTORY OF THE SEVENTY-THIRD REGIMENT ILLINOIS INFANTRY VOLUNTEERS.\n\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS -- RENDEZVOUS -- ORGANIZATION OF \"THE PREACHER REGIMENT\" -- COMPLETE ROSTER -- DUTY, EXPERIENCE, AND INCIDENTS AT CAMP BUTLER.\n\nTHE call of President Abraham Lincoln for three hundred thousand volunteers, dated July 6, 1862, was the \"bugle-note\" that summoned the men -- and boys -- of the 73d to the field. Almost immediately steps were taken to secure enlistments in the several companies. The regiment, as organized, was credited to the State at large. The reason for this was, probably, the fact that so many counties were represented in it. With two exceptions, no county furnished more than one company; and in some of the companies more than two counties were represented. There were ten companies in the regiment, representing not less than ten counties; each of at least ten counties being represented in the regiment by a full company, or a considerable fraction thereof; while two or three, or more, counties were represented by smaller squads and individual members.\n\nCompany A was raised in Sangamon County, though\n\n18\n\nColes, Christian, and Tazewell Counties each had one or more representatives in it.\n\nCompany B was raised principally in Tazewell County, though Fulton, Henry, Mason, Menard, Montgomery, Sangamon, and Shelby Counties each had one or more representatives in it.\n\nCompany C was raised in Vermilion County, Edgar and Ford Counties each being credited with one man.\n\nCompany D was raised in Piatt County, one recruit being from Tazewell.\n\nCompany E was raised in Vermilion County, Champaign County being credited with three men.\n\nCompany F was raised principally in Logan County. Menard, Sangamon, and Woodford Counties each being represented.\n\nCompany G was raised principally in Schuyler and Jackson Counties, with representatives in the Company from Adams, Brown, McDonough, Stephenson, and Sangamon Counties.\n\nCompany H was raised principally in Adams and Pike Counties, though Brown, Hancock, and Sangamon Counties were represented in it.\n\nCompany I was raised principally in Sangamon County, with additions to it from the counties of Adams, Montgomery, Macoupin, Jackson, Gallatin, and Saline.\n\nCompany K was raised in the counties of Jackson and Saline, with some two or more men from each of the counties of Franklin, Gallatin, Williamson, and Perry.\n\nSome twelve or fifteen counties had quite a respectable representation in the regiment, Sangamon and Vermilion Counties having the largest; while nearly or quite as many more counties were represented by smaller squads and individual members.\n\n19\n\nSo many counties being represented in the 73d, justly entitled it to the distinction of being credited to the State at large. The complete roster of the regiment, which appears herein, shows more particularly the several localities in the State that contributed to its ranks. How came it that a territory so great in extent, or localities so far apart, were drawn upon for material for this regiment, when several other regiments were being raised at the same time ? We do not assume to be able to give the true answer to this question; but will venture two or three possible reasons, or explanations, which may sufficiently answer it. Within one week from the date of the call for three hundred thousand men, the active work of securing\n\n20\n\nenlistments and raising companies began. On the part of many volunteers or squads and companies of such, there was, doubtless, an ambition, or desire at least, to get into the first, or one of the first, regiments organized in the State under that call. This may have been one reason; but another and more probable explanation may be found in the following statement, viz.: James F. Jaquess, late chaplain of the 6th Illinois Cavalry, was authorized by Governor Richard Yates, early in June, 1862, to raise a regiment of infantry volunteers. By reason of his connection with the Illinois Methodist Episcopal Conference, as a minister of the gospel, and later as president of the Illinois Female College at Jacksonville, which was under the supervision and patronage of the Conference, Rev. Jaquess had become widely and favorably known in the central portions of Illinois.\n\nIn many, if not most, of the neighborhoods and localities from which the 73d was recruited, the solicitations and appeals, the \"drumming up\" for volunteers, were made and participated in by ministers of the gospel, either in the regular or local work. This fact may have been due, in some instances, to Colonel Jaquess's influence, remotely if not directly. At any rate, when the several companies and fractions thereof reached Camp Butler, they, and the \"preachers in charge,\" easily and naturally drifted into Colonel Jaquess's \"Preacher Regiment,\" the 73d Illinois.\n\n21\n\nAnother fact is probably also accounted for in the foregoing statement, which is that the large majority of the men of which the regiment was composed were young men -- boys between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five years -- and came, in large measure, from the educational, school, and Church walks of life. We do not wish to be understood as intimating that the farm, and shop, and business generally were not represented in the regiment; for these were largely represented in it.\n\nEnlistments in the several companies dated from July 12 to August 17, 1862, as a rule; the exceptions being mostly in cases of recruits sent to the regiment in the field. The dates of the reporting of the several companies, and parts of companies, at Camp Butler, varied from about July 24 to about August 18, 1862.\n\nBy the latter date, all the companies, excepting Company E, had the number of men necessary to entitle them to muster in, while some of the companies had more.\n\nTo expedite matters, hasten the muster-in of the regiment, an arrangement was effected whereby Company C, from Vermilion County, \"loaned\" to Company E, also from Vermilion, some fourteen men. This entitled the regiment to muster-in, the companies having an average of more than eighty-five men. Accordingly, on the 21st day of August, 1862, the 73d Illinois Volunteers was mustered into the service of the United States for the period of three years, by Captain Ewing, of the 13th United States Infantry. The roster of the 72d Illinois, as it appears in the revised reports of the adjutant-general of the State, shows that regiment as having been mustered into service August 21st, the same day that the 73d was mustered in, while the historical\n\n22\n\nsketch of the regiment distinctly states, it was mustered into service August 23d, and started the very same day for Cairo, where it arrived on the 24th. If the roster be correct as to date of the muster-in, then the 73d has equal claim with the 72d to being the first regiment mustered into the United States service from the State of Illinois, for the term of three years, in the year 1862; and, if the historical sketch be correct, then the 73d has superior claim to that honor. The 71st Illinois was the last three-months regiment, and the 74th Illinois was not mustered into service until September 4, 1862.\n\nAt Bloomington, Illinois, recently, we met a comrade who had served in the 114th Illinois. On finding we had served in the 73d, he said: \"And your regiment stole our number; we were to have had the number you got\" We replied that we didn't know so well about that. We admitted that our regiment might have \"foraged\" or \"flanked\" his regiment out of the number it expected. We hardly think the \"Preacher Regiment\" ever stole anything; that is, until after it was numbered.\n\nThe fond, reluctant farewells having been spoken, the last glances having been taken, and the sad separations from familiar scenes and hearth-stones having been effected, the men of the several companies which were included in the 73d were organized, drilled, and disciplined, preparatory to admission into the service of the General Government. In addition to becoming accustomed to camp life and fare, becoming inured to the use of \"army rations,\" the regiment, or details from the companies which, later on, composed it, did duty daily in guarding Confederate prisoners, of whom there were some two or three thousand at Camp Butler\n\n23\n\nat the time. This duty, and camp-guard and fatigue duty and squad and company drill, occupied the time up to about August 20th. On and before this date, the last proceeding, prior to the muster-in, was had -- the examination of the men by the medical authorities. This examination was, to all appearances at least, conducted in a thorough manner, though but very few of the men were pronounced unfit for army service. There were a few men, we remember, who were doubtful, as were also their messmates, as to whether or not they would pass this medical examination. Some of these, on being pronounced fit for service, were very well pleased.\n\nAs many in the volunteers of the 73d lived near their county boundary lines -- their homes in one county and their post-offices in another -- it is quite probable that a few counties are credited herein with men they did not furnish. In the roster, under the head of \"Residence,\" the name of the post-office is frequently given instead of the name of the county in which the residence was located. In ascertaining the names and number of the counties that furnished volunteers to the 73d, we looked to see what counties certain towns and post-offices were in, thus including in the list, no doubt, a few more counties than we should. All errors of this kind corrected, it would still appear that very many good counties were represented in a very good regiment by very good men.\n\nOn August 21, 1862, as before stated, the regiment was formally mustered into the United States service. The complete roster of the field and staff, commissioned and non-commissioned, and of the several companies, both commissioned and non-commissioned, including recruits, as shown on the rolls of the 73d, is as follows:\n\n24\n\nSEVENTY-THIRD INFANTRY REGIMENT.
