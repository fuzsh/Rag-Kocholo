It was constituted on 12 April 1808 as the 6th Infantry[1] and shares with other regiments the battle honors[2] of the original 2nd Infantry Regiment extending back to March 1791. What follows is a history of that original regiment and the new regiment still in existence. Since the formation of the original 2nd Infantry Regiment in 1791, an active unit bearing the name \"2nd Infantry\" has served under every president from President George Washington until the present.\n\nOriginal 2nd Infantry[]\n\nAlthough the present regiment was formed 12 April 1808, on 3 March 1791 Congress added to the Army a \"Second Regiment of Infantry\" to aid in combating Indian attacks in the Northwest Territory. On 4 March 1791 John Doughty was appointed Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the regiment but he resigned from the Army on 12 March 1791 in protest of the reduction of enlisted pay. Before resigning he appointed John Toomy as the first sergeant major of the regiment. Sergeant Major Toomy and Sergeant Pollesey, who was appointed regiment quartermaster, were charged with establishing the regiment's headquarters at Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania. On 22 October 1791 Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkinson was then appointed Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the regiment but he did not take command until January 1792. The regiment was to be made up as follows: a lieutenant colonel commandant, two majors, eight captains, eight lieutenants, eight ensigns, one surgeon, two surgeon's mates, and eight companies of about 100 men each.\n\nRecruiting began almost immediately in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. The companies were known by their commanding officer's name and the first one formed was under the command of Captain Robert Kirkwood. Between March 1791 and May 1792 all recruits passed through New Brunswick Recruit Barracks in New Jersey for outfitting and then on to Fort Pitt.\n\nFrom Fort Pitt the regiment moved down the Ohio River by barge to Fort Washington (Cincinnati) in the Northwest Territory, where Governor Arthur St. Clair had established his headquarters. On 4 October 1791, the Army under the command of St. Clair commenced a campaign against the Miami Indians. On 4 November 1791 about 60 miles from Fort Washington the Indians, numbering not more than one thousand, surprised the Army and put it to flight with great slaughter. The American Army numbered 1,483, of these 38 officers and 593 men were killed or missing and 31 officers and 252 men were wounded, many of whom later died. Of the 2nd Infantry it is estimated that 101 enlisted were killed, 54 wounded and 50 missing, presumed dead. Seven officers, including Major Jonathan Heart who was in command of the regiment and Captain Robert Kirkwood, were killed and one wounded. On the day of the battle St. Clair's army consisted of the following: US Battalion of the 5th Artillery, 2nd Infantry Regiment, 1st and 2nd Regiment of Levies, a company of Pennsylvania militia, and a Kentucky militia regiment. The 1st Infantry Regiment was not present at the battle.\n\nLegion of the United States[]\n\nIn 1792 Congress created the Legion of the United States which was a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery under the command of Major General Anthony Wayne. This Legion consisted of four sub-legions of which the Second Infantry became the \"Second Sub-Legion\". At this time only the 1st and 2d Infantry were actually organized, therefore it was necessary to go out and recruit infantry for the 3d and 4th Sub-Legions.[3] The new force was reformed and trained at the United States' first basic training facility at Legionville in Pennsylvania during the winter of 1792-93. The Legion fought in the Northwest Indian War finally defeating the Indians decisively at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in the Northwest Territory on 20 August 1794. The conflict with the Indians ended with the signing of the Treaty of Greenville on 2 August 1795. On 1 November 1796 the Legion was discontinued and the Second Sub-Legion again became the Second Regiment of Infantry. The unit colors of the 2nd Sub-Legion were red and white.\n\nMotto[]\n\nThe regiment's motto, \"NOLI ME TANGERE\" (Do Not Touch Me), was first applied in 1792 when Major General Anthony Wayne requested Secretary of War Henry Knox to send the newly formed Legion of the United States a legion standard and a standard for each of the four sub-legions. Each standard was to have this motto on a ribbon on the flag. This motto was carried over following the 1815 consolidations and was applied to the regiment's distinctive unit insignia in 1936.\n\nWar of 1812[]\n\nIn the War of 1812 units of the 2nd Infantry fought several engagements with the British. The regiment defended Fort Bowyer, in Alabama, on 15 September 1814 when 120 2nd infantrymen held off four British vessels and a motley force of 130 Royal Marines, 100 Spanish infantrymen, and some 600 Indians. The 2nd Infantry losses in the battle were 4 killed and 4 wounded while the British suffered 32 killed and 40 wounded and the loss of one ship. Major William Lawrence, who was in command of the fort, was brevetted for gallantry in this action, together with Captains Chamberlain, Brownlow and Bradley. Lieutenants Villard, Sturgis, Conway, H. Saunders, T. R. Saunders, Brooks, Davis and C. Saunders, were all mentioned by General Andrew Jackson in dispatches.[4]:415\n\nCaptain John M. Davis of the regiment was made a brevet major for gallantry at the siege of New Orleans in December 1814 and several companies of the 2nd Infantry were in New Orleans at the time of the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815.\n\nOn 11–12 February 1815, before learning of the 24 December 1814 signing of the Treaty of Ghent, the British attacked Fort Bowyer again. Major William Lawrence of the 2nd Infantry was still in command there. Jackson had reinforced Lawrence, who now commanded some 370 troops from the regiment, and had three long 32-pounders, eight 24s, six 12s, five 9s, a mortar and a howitzer. After a five day siege the wounded Major Lawrence surrendered Fort Bowyer. The British had captured the regiment's colors, which are on display at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, England.[5] This battle is considered the last land battle of the War of 1812.[6]\n\nIn the spring of 1815 the 2nd Infantry Regiment was consolidated with the 3rd, 7th and 44th Infantry Regiments, all located in Military District #7, to form a new 1st Infantry Regiment. Thus the chronicles of the original Second Infantry came to an end.\n\nOrigin of present 2nd Infantry[]\n\nAt the end of the War of 1812 an act of Congress dated 3 March 1815 drastically reduced the size of the Regular Army. Eight infantry regiments, one rifle regiment and an artillery regiment were formed from the remains of the 46 existing regiments, while the cavalry was eliminated. This was done with no regard for the traditions of the existing regiments. The old regiments which happened to be closest together were pooled to form new regiments and the numbers assigned the regiments were based on the seniority of the colonels commanding them.\n\nIn accordance with the act, on 17 May 1815 a new 2nd US Infantry was created by the consolidation of the 6th, 16th, 22nd, 23rd, and 32nd Regiments of Infantry, all then located in upper New York and Vermont. The date of organization of the present 2nd Infantry is that of the original 6th Infantry, 12 April 1808. The regiment's headquarters was in the cantonment at Sackett's Harbor. Colonel Hugh Brady became the regiment's commanding officer with Henry Leavenworth as major and Ninian Pinkney as lieutenant-colonel.[4]:415 The regimental number \"2\" was because Brady was the second most senior regimental commander in the United States Army. Colonel Brady was in command of the 22nd Infantry at the time of the consolidation and though he served in several other commands and reached the rank of major general, he remained colonel commandant of the 2nd Infantry Regiment until his death on 15 April 1851.\n\nThe War Department ruled that the present 2nd Infantry bear upon its colors the campaign honors of the regiments consolidated into its organization. Thus the colors bear the campaign streamers for Canada, Chippawa and Lundy's Lane, even though the original/old 2nd Infantry did not participate in any of the battles in Canada during the War of 1812. The present 2nd Infantry also allowed to keep the two battle honors earned by the original/old 2nd Infantry for the Miami Campaign (1790-1795) and Alabama 1814.[2]\n\nMilitary service[]\n\nFirst Indian War period[]\n\nIn the ensuing years the regiment was primarily concerned with manning and constructing forts around the Great Lakes. When the Black Hawk War of 1832 erupted the 2nd Infantry was sent to Illinois but did not actually participate in any fighting. The regiment returned to its posts on the Great Lakes. During the Second Seminole War, from 1838 to 1842, the regiment was in Florida, where it was on the move daily, fighting and building roads and installations. In April 1840 with Colonel Brady attending to other duty assignments Lieutenant Colonel Bennett C. Riley assumed command of the regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Riley remained in command of the regiment until January 1850. In 1843 the regiment returned to its posts on Lakes Ontario and Champlain in upstate New York.[4]:423\n\nRamrod[]\n\nIn 1843, Lieutenant Colonel Riley, who commanded the 2nd Infantry through the Seminole and Mexican Wars, presented the regiment with a drum major's baton made from either a cannon rammer or Cyprus wood with a silver knob inscribed with the date of presentation, the name of the officer giving it and the regimental motto, \"Noli Me Tangere\", At the time Headquarters and Companies C, D, F and K were stationed at Buffalo Barracks, New York. During the heroic assault to capture the fortress at Chapultapec, Mexico in September 1847 Sergeant Major Samuel C. Green broke the baton when he struck an enemy soldier in the head.[7] The flagstaff from that fortress was used to replace the broken wood on the baton, with the silver mountings transferred to it. Additional silver bands made from a tea set captured at the fortress were placed on the baton, one of them inscribed that the baton was made from the flag staff captured at Chapultapec. The baton had been in the constant possession of the regiment from 1843 until sometime in the 1990s when it was placed in the 1st Infantry Division Museum at Würzburg, Germany. In 2007 it was transferred to the 1st Infantry Division Museum at Fort Riley, Kansas and in late 2012 it was transferred to the Patton Museum at Fort Knox, Kentucky.[7]\n\nWar with Mexico[]\n\nWhen war broke out with Mexico in 1846, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was sent to Camargo, Mexico and joined General David E. Twiggs' Brigade. From September 1846 to December 1847 the regiment campaigned from the Rio Grande to Mexico City, fighting in battles at Veracruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Moline del Rey and Chapultepec. The regiment suffered 28 killed and 132 wounded in the war.\n\nSecond Indian War period[]\n\nIn September 1848 because of conflicts with the Indians in Oregon and California the regiment was sent west. The regiment sailed via Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn and Santiago, Chile, to California. Between 1849 and 1853 the regiment was in California occupying stations from Goose Lake on the north to Fort Yuma on the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the east, scouting, providing protection for the '49ers and fighting throughout the entire area. The regiment returned to New York in 1853 only to be sent to the Western Plains where it was occupied in the constructing or reconstructing of forts, building roads and scouting the hills and plains along the Missouri River as far west as Fort Kearny, Nebraska and Fort Laramie, Wyoming.\n\nAmerican Civil War[]\n\nDuring the Civil War the 2nd Infantry was involved in some of the first fighting of the war that took place at Wilson's Creek in Missouri and the first Battle of Bull Run. The regiment was assigned to the Army of the Potomac and fought in numerous major engagements such as Manassas, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg. By June 1864 the commissioned and enlisted strength of the regiment had reached such a low figure, less than 100 men, that at the request of the regimental commander the remaining enlisted men were transferred to Company C, and that company was given a full complement of officers and non-commissioned officers. From then until December 1864 the entire regiment consisted of just Company C. On 18 April 1869 the 2nd Infantry was consolidated with the 16th Infantry and the consolidated unit was designated as the 2nd Infantry. The regiment suffered 102 killed and 326 wounded during the Civil War.\n\nBetween the end of the war in 1865 and 1877 the regiment was deployed throughout the south enforcing the \"Reconstruction\" laws. On 10 February 1877 2nd Lieutenant Augustine McIntye was brutally murdered in Gelnier County, Georgia while in command of a detachment acting as a posse with two U.S. Marshals and revenue officers engaged in arresting illicit distillers.[4]:430\n\nThe 2nd Infantry bears nine battle honors from the Southern Campaign through its 1869 consolidation with the 16th Infantry. This unit was present at battles in that sector, including Atlanta, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Georgia 1864, Kentucky 1862, Mississippi 1862, Murfreesboro, Shiloh and Tennessee 1863\n\nThird Indian War period[]\n\nFrom 1877 to 1886 the regiment was in Washington, Oregon and Idaho Territory campaigning against the Nez Perce, then the Bannocks and then a band of the Eastern Shoshones called the Sheepeaters. During this entire period, the regiment suffered one soldier killed, two wounded, ten deaths by other causes and one death by drowning. In 1886 it moved to Fort Omaha, Nebraska to help fight the Sioux. The 2nd Infantry was on the Pine Ridge Reservation on 29 December 1890 when the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred and although the regiment was not involved; one officer from the regiment was wounded there. On the same day, in a separate attack by the Sioux Indians, three soldiers from the regiment were wounded. The regiment remained on the western plains until 1898.\n\nSpanish–American War[]\n\nIn 1898 the regiment was deployed to Cuba at the start of the Spanish–American War, with Headquarters, Band and Companies C and G sailing on the same ship with the Rough Riders. The regiment, under the command of LTC William Wherry, (regimental commander COL John C. Bates had been promoted to brigadier general of volunteers) fought in battles along the road to San Juan Heights and the battle of Santiago, where it fought on the extreme left of San Juan Heights. In August 1898, the regiment returned to the United States only to return to Cuba in January 1899. The regiment stayed in Cuba until September 1899 when it returned to the United States to prepare for deployment to the Philippines. The regiment suffered 22 dead and 50 wounded during their campaign in Cuba.\n\nPhilippine Insurrection[]\n\nIn August/September 1900 the 2nd Infantry was deployed to deal with the Philippine Insurrection during which it fought in over 25 engagements on several of the islands. Three soldiers were killed and twelve wounded between 4 November 1900 and 10 February 1902. In May 1903 the regiment returned to duty in the western United States, it was stationed at Fort Logan, Colorado and Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming. In February 1906 the regiment was redeployed to the Philippines and remained there until returning to the United States in March 1908. The 3rd Battalion went to Fort Assinniboine, Montana and the balance of the regiment to Fort Thomas, Kentucky for training and garrison duties until deploying to Hawaii in 1911.\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nWhen war broke out, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was on security duty in the Hawaiian Islands guarding interned German ships and sailors, as well as various U.S. installations. On 18 November 1917, the regiment, less Machine Gun Company and a detachment from Company H, turned out for the funeral of Hawaii's ex-queen Lilioukalani. In July 1918, it returned to the United States and was assigned to the 19th Division at Camp Dodge, Iowa. The war ended just as the regiment was about to deploy to France. In 1919, the regiment was relieved from the 19th Division and resumed as a separate regiment.\n\nPost World War I[]\n\nIn September 1919, following the 2nd Infantry Regiment's release from the 19th Division, it was stationed at Camp Sherman, Ohio. In October 1921 the 2nd Infantry Regiment was ordered to Fort Snelling, Minnesota and Fort Sheridan, Illinois but as they reached their destinations the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were eliminated and Headquarters and 1st Battalion were at Fort Sheridan as a training battalion. In August 1922 the 2nd Infantry Regiment was redesignated a combat regiment and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were reorganized using personnel from the 54th Infantry. In March 1923 the regiment was assigned to the 6th Division. Headquarters and 1st Battalion stayed at Fort Sheridan, 2nd Battalion was at Fort Wayne (Detroit), Michigan and 3rd Battalion was at Fort Brady, Michigan. Between August 1922 and October 1939 no major changes were made and the 2nd Infantry Regiment participated in the usual garrison training, maneuvers, field training and other duties.\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nIn 1939 prior to World War II, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was assigned to the 5th Infantry Division. In February 1942 the regiment was sent to Iceland for training, to provide security for U.S. bases located there, and to load and unload supply ships. It was then sent to England and then Ireland for training. In July 1944 the 2nd Infantry Regiment along with the 5th Infantry Division landed in Normandy, France. It became part of General George Patton's Third United States Army, leading the way in the breakout from the beaches of Normandy in Operation Cobra, capturing Rheims and then seized Metz after a major battle at Fort Driant. On 13 July 1944 SSGT Robert Bass was killed by enemy artillery fire. He was the first member of the 2nd Infantry and also the 5th Division killed in action in the war.\n\nWhen the Battle of the Bulge began the 2nd Infantry Regiment moved to the battle zone in the area of Nideranven, Luxembourg. In January 1945 the 2nd Infantry Regiment forced a crossing of the Sauer River and attacked into the Siegfried Line. The regiment then crossed the Rhine River near Oppenheim and secured the crossing for other Third Army units. The unit then spearheaded the attack into Czechoslovakia and was located near the town of Volary when the word came to cease all forward movement at 08:31 on 7 May 1945. In 276 days of combat the regiment captured 275 cities and towns, crossed 20 rivers, and captured 22,103 of the enemy. The regiment suffered 906 killed, 2,736 wounded and 295 missing or prisoner of war. 12 Distinguished Service Crosses, 184 Silver Stars and 664 Bronze Stars were awarded to soldiers of the regiment.\n\nPost World War II[]\n\nFollowing World War II the 2nd Infantry Regiment returned to the United States and was inactivated and activated several times and even returned to Germany for a period. During the Korean War the regiment was stationed at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania with the 5th Infantry Division training recruits for deployment to Korea. In June 1957, at the time of the Pentomic reorganization, the 2nd Infantry Regiment was stationed at Fort Ord, California with the 5th Infantry Division, serving as a training regiment. The 2nd Battalion was reorganized and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battle Group, 2nd Infantry and released from assignment with 5th Infantry Division and assigned to the 1st Infantry Division. At this time both the 1st and 3rd Battalions were inactivated.\n\nIn January 1959 the 2nd Battle Group was reassigned to the 24th Infantry Division in Germany. In February 1962 the 1st Battalion was activated and assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 5th Infantry Division. The 2d Battle Group, 2nd Infantry was reorganized and redesignated and concurrently relieved from assignment to the 24th Infantry Division and also assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 5th Infantry Division. Both battalions were stationed at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.\n\nVietnam[]\n\nWith the fighting in Vietnam escalating the change in assignment from NATO reinforcement to counterinsurgency in Vietnam, the 1st Infantry Division was restructured. Battle groups were redesignated as infantry battalions, Honest Johns and Davy Crocketts disappeared while the requirements for nine infantry battalions arose. When the division received orders to deploy to Vietnam it was told to leave its two armored battalions behind. Therefore, the division was in need of two more infantry battalions. As no pool of unassigned maneuver battalions existed, on 12 July 1965 the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 2nd Infantry from the 2d Brigade, 5th Infantry Division, at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, were relieved and assigned to the 1st Infantry Division with no change of station. The 1st Infantry Division also reorganized its two mechanized infantry battalions as standard infantry, bringing the number of infantry battalions in the division to nine.\n\nIn September 1965 the two battalions deployed to Vietnam, landing on the beach at Vũng Tàu in October 1965. From there they proceeded to their assigned areas, Phouc Vinh for the 1st Battalion and Lai Khe for the 2nd Battalion. The battalions initially fought as light infantry in the areas north and west of Saigon. In June–July 1966 it was determined that mechanized infantry would work in Vietnam. So, the 2nd Battalion changed over from 17 July-31 December 1966. On 2 January 1967 the 2nd Battalion officially became a mechanized infantry battalion.\n\nThe first major battles were fought by the 2nd Battalion at Ap Bau Bang on 12 November 1965 and Ap Nha Mat on 5 December 1965. Heavy losses were suffered at Ap Nha Mat and three soldiers are still listed as missing. The 1st Battalion sustained its first major casualties of the war on 21 December 1965 when the enemy ambushed the command group of Company B as the company was moving out of Bien Hoa on routine patrol. On 25 August 1966 a patrol from Company C, 1st Battalion became involved in what became known as the Battle of Bong Trang with heavy losses on both sides.\n\nDuring four and a half years the battalions were involved in major operations such as: Junction City, the largest operation conducted up to that time, Lam Son II, Paul Bunyan, Bu Dop, AKA, Battle of Hill 172, An Lộc and An Lộc II, plus numerous other operations and small unit actions. Contact with the enemy was almost daily. When the 1st Infantry Division stood down in March and April 1970 the 1st and 2nd Battalion's colors were cased and the soldiers were either reassigned to other units in Vietnam or returned to the United States to be discharged.\n\nLosses were 276 for the 1st Battalion and 266 for the 2nd Battalion. One soldier from Company B, 1st Battalion and three soldiers from Company B, 2nd Battalion are still listed as missing. The four are listed as \"body not recovered, Casualty Type: Hostile, died while missing\".\n\n\"Black Scarves\"\n\nOn 30 April 1966 in a sweep through the village of Lo Go, the 1st Battalion was engaged in heavy fighting and captured a large quantity of black cloth. This cloth was used by the Viet Cong to make their \"black pajama\" uniforms. At the direction of battalion commander LTC Richard Prillaman, this cloth was made into scarves to be worn by the battalion's soldiers. LTC Prillaman wanted to be able to distinguish his battalion from other division soldiers and to provide the soldiers with something more appropriate than the towels the men were wearing around their necks. It is from this use that the battalion has as its nickname \"Black Scarves\". The printing on the scarves was a different color for each company: HHC, yellow; Company A, red; Company B, white; Company C, blue; and Company D, green.\n\n\"Iron Fist\"\n\nThe following statement was in a press release from Headquarters, 1st Infantry Division, in January 1968 describing the 2nd Battalion's accomplishments. \"The 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry (Mechanized) The Iron Fist of the Big Red One is one of the most versatile units in the First Division. The use of armored personnel carriers for fast ground deployment adds greatly to the battalions reactionary capabilities.\" The 2nd Battalion soldiers called themselves Iron Fists from that time until the battalion returned to the United States and was inactivated in 1970.\n\nPost Vietnam[]\n\nIn early April 1970 an honor guard returned the 1st and 2nd Battalion's colors to Fort Riley, Kansas and on 15 April, the 2nd Battalion was inactivated. The 1st Battalion remained active and in October 1970 the battalion, along with the entire division, participated in Operation Reforger II in Germany. Following this it returned to Fort Riley and remained with the 1st Infantry Division until it was inactivated on 1 October 1983.\n\nOn 21 March 1973 the 2nd Battalion was relieved from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division and reassigned to the 9th Infantry Division. It was activated at Fort Lewis, Washington with the reflagging of the 1st Battalion, 60th Infantry. On 6 November 1987 the 2nd Battalion was reactivated as a \"motorized\" combined arms battalion-heavy (CAB-H). On 17 June 1988 the 2nd Battalion was inactivated and then in August 1988 was activated with the reflagging of the 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry, still with the 9th Division. In May 1991 the 2nd Battalion was inactivated and relieved from assignment to the 9th Infantry Division.\n\nOn 16 February 1996 the 2nd Battalion was reassigned to the 1st Infantry Division and on 27 March was activated at Rose Barracks, Vilseck, Germany as Task Force 2/2 Infantry with the reflagging of the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry. The 2nd Battalion deployed to Bosnia in support of Operation Joint Guard in 1996. In 1997 the battalion, as part of Task Force Eagle Stabilization Force (SFOR), was awarded the Army Superior Unit Award for actions such as Brčko riots and Hill 562.[8] The 2nd Battalion redeployed to Vilseck in October 1997.
