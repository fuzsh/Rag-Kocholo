Ellinger, Nov. 3, 1864.\n\nFIRST REGIMENT PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS.\n\nOn the 20th of April the First Pennsylvania Regiment of volunteer militia for the service of the national government was organized. Previous to the receipt of marching orders the men were furnished with muskets and muslin haversacks, and provided with hard-tack and bacon and about twelve round of ball-cartridge, which, for want of cartridge-boxes, were carried in their pockets. On the night of the 20th of April the regiment, under the command of brigadier-general George C. Wynkoop, left Harrisburg and proceeded to a point near Cockeysville, on the Northern Central Railroad. This movement was made with the design of protecting the bridges on this road and eventually of opening communication with Washington, which, since the passage of the Massachusetts troops, had been broken. But, upon the representation of leading public men of Maryland that a military occupation and a resort to violent measures at this time might precipitate a collision and lead to the secession of the State, the authorities ordered a retrograde movement, and on the following Monday evening the command retired to Camp Scott, near the town of York. The regiment remained there, drilling in anticipation of immediate service in the field, until the 14th of May, when it was detailed to guard the Northern Central Railroad from the Pennsylvania line to Druid Park, near Baltimore.\n\nOn the 25th of May, having been relieved by the Twelfth Pennsylvania Regiment, Col. Campbell, it was ordered to move to Catonsville, Maryland, to guard the roads leading to Frederick City and Harper's Ferry. Tents and camp equipage were here supplied, which had hitherto been wanting, all efforts to obtain them having proved fruitless. On the 29th it was ordered to advance about five miles to the village of Franklintown, where it was posted, and remained guarding the same avenues as before.\n\nOn the 3rd of June the regiment was ordered to Chambersburg to join the forces there concentrating. It was placed in camp, remaining several days, engaged in drill and field discipline. It was assigned to the Second Brigade, Second Division of general Patterson's army. The brigade was soon after ordered to Hagerstown, and advanced to and encamped near the village of Funkstown. While at this place upon one occasion the whole encampment was aroused at midnight in anticipation of the enemy and hurriedly marched to Williamsport, on the Potomac, which was reached at day-break. Remaining until the following evening, no enemy being discovered, it was ordered to return to camp, reaching it about midnight. The regiment was here supplied with new uniforms. Previous to this time the men had suffered for the want of adequate clothing, though the destitution had been greatly relieved by a partial supply sent by kind friends at Easton. A few days later, on the 21st of June, orders were received from the commanding general to prepare three days' cooked rations, and, taking transportation and ten days' rations, to move with all possible dispatch and occupy Frederick, Maryland. In obedience to this order the regiment struck tents the same evening, and on the 22nd arrived at Frederick and reported to Governor Hicks. The regiment remained here about two weeks, constantly improving in field exercises and military discipline. It was next ordered to Martinsburg, Virginia. Returning through Boonsborough, it encamped the same night on Kennedy's farm, and on the following day arrived at Williamsport. Fording the Potomac, it advanced to Falling Waters. Next day, resuming the march, it arrived at Martinsburg, meeting the whole division commanded by general Patterson.\n\nWhen, on the 14th of July, the division under general Patterson moved towards Bunker Hill, the First Regiment, in obedience to this order, remained at Martinsburg, which had now become the base of supply. Two days later the regiment was ordered to Charlestown, where it again met and rejoined the division. Here, on the 17th of July, an order was received to have the men prepared with ten days' cooked rations in haversacks, and be ready to move without baggage. On this day it had been arranged that a battle should be fought by the army under McDowell, but was delayed till four days later.\n\nThe plan of campaign, as disclosed by the orders of the general-in-chief, contemplated that the army under Patterson should keep in front of the enemy and prevent his advance into Maryland or Pennsylvania, and make demonstrations in favor of the army operating under McDowell in front of Washington, with a conditional purpose of striking the enemy a damaging blow, if a favorable opportunity offered. These demonstrations were continued till it was supposed that the contemplated battle before Washington had been fought. general Scott had given notice to general Patterson that the movement would commence on the 16th, again that it had been commenced on the 17th, and finally that the decisive battle would be fought on the 18th. On the 21st, the regiment was ordered to move to Harper's Ferry, from whence, on the 23d, it marched to Sandy Hook, and on the same evening took the train for Harrisburg, where the men were honorably discharged and mustered out.\n\nDuring the time that the regiment was in service, it did not participate in any battles; but its timely arrival in the field accomplished much good by checking any rash movement on the part of rebels in arms along our borders. The duties it was called upon to perform were faithfully done, and its good conduct, under all circumstances, was appreciated and acknowledged by its superior officers.\n\nROLL OF COMPANY E, FIRST REGIMENT (THREE MONTHS' SERVICE).\n\nRecruited at Harrisburg and mustered in April 18, 1861.\n\nCaptain.\n\nJacob M.

Recruiting commenced on the 15th of April, 1861, and as fast as companies and squads were accepted they reported at Camp Curtin, Harrisburg. On the 21st of Apri1, the officers of ten companies were ordered to hold an election at York for field officers of a regiment, at which the following were chosen and duly commissioned: Frederick S. Stumbaugh, of Chambersburg, colonel; Thomas Welsh, of Columbia, lieutenant-colonel; James Given, from captain of Company G, of West Chester, major. Isaac S. Waterbury was appointed adjutant.\n\nOn the evening of Saturday, April 20th, the same day on which the regiment was organized, it left Harrisburg by rail for Washington, but halted at Cockeysville, Md., at daylight on Sunday morning, the railroad bridge at that point having been destroyed. After remaining in bivouac and under arms for about forty-eight hours, the regiment was ordered back to York, Pa., where it remained in camp of instruction till the first day of June, when the command was ordered to Chambersburg. In the army organization which here ensued, the Second Regiment was assigned to the Second Brigade of the Second Division.\n\ngeneral Robert Patterson had been assigned by Governor Curtin on the 16th of April to the command of Pennsylvania troops, and a few days thereafter, while busily engaged in organizing and sending them forward to points threatened, he was, by the order of lieutenant-general Scott, placed in command of the \"Department of Washington,\" embracing the States of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, with headquarters at Philadelphia. The quota of Pennsylvania troops, with an excess of some ten regiments, having been organized and placed in the field, and all the lines of communication leading to Washington having been opened and securely guarded, general Patterson proceeded, on the 2nd of June, to Chambersburg, where a camp had been formed under major-general William H. Keim, and assumed command, with the design of operating against the rebel army in the Shenandoah Valley, which was now threatening the contiguous parts of Maryland and Pennsylvania.\n\nAs early as the 20th of June, general Scott had requested general Patterson to propose to him a plan of operations. On the 21st the latter submitted one, which in substance proposed to occupy Maryland Heights with a brigade, and to fortify and arm with heavy artillery; to make Frederick, Md., the base of supply, with a guard which should act as a sustaining force to the command on Maryland Heights; to send all other available force, horse, foot, and artillery, across the Potomac to unite with Col. Stone at Leesburg, to operate from that point as circumstances should demand. This plan was not approved by general Scott, and on the 25th of June he gave peremptory orders to general Patterson to keep in front of the enemy while he remained in force between Winchester and the Potomac. The army having been ordered to move to Williamsport, the Second Regiment broke camp at Chambersburg on the 16th of June, and moving by rail to Hagerstown, went into camp at the village of Funkstown. Remaining here until the 23d, it was ordered forward towards the Potomac and encamped about four miles from the river. Crossing the Potomac with general Patterson's combined army on the 2nd. of July, it advanced to Martinsburg. The enemy, having been pushed back from point to point, had finally established himself in an intrenched camp at Winchester. On the 15th of July, leaving two regiments at Martinsburg to guard his supplies, general Patterson marched with the remainder of his force to Bunker Hill, driving Johnston's advanced guard from the place, and on the 16th of July, the day on which, according to the telegrams of general Scott, Beauregard was to be attacked at Manassas, he made a demonstration in force, driving the enemy's pickets in upon his main line. On the 17th of June, general Patterson transferred his whole command by a rapid movement to Charlestown. The term of service of the Second Regiment having already expired, it moved on the 23d of July from Charlestown, and marching to Harper's Ferry, was taken by rail to Harrisburg, where, on the 26th of July, it was mustered out of service.\n\nROLL OF COMPANY I, SECOND REGIMENT (THREE MONTHS' SERVICE).\n\nRecruited at Harrisburg, and mustered in April 20, 1861.\n\nCaptain.\n\nWilliam B.

The Cameron Guards and the State Guards were both militia organizations, and were recruited to their maximum number after the President's first proclamation for volunteers was issued, and they formed constituent parts of the First and Second Regiments of Pennsylvania Volunteers. The patriotism of William F. Verbeke, Esq., of Harrisburg, was fired by the treasonable attack of the rebels on Fort Sumter, and promptly, on the call of the government for volunteers to defend her honor, Mr. Verbeke was foremost in the good work at Harrisburg in recruiting men for the military service. He was untiring in his energy, and lavish in the expenditure of his money in raising troops for the government. He quartered and fed the recruits at his own expense, and threw wide open the doors of his private residence to soldiers generally, generously feeding the hungry, lodging the weary, and nursing the sick. The compliment of naming the company in his honor and giving him the nomination of its officers was most worthily bestowed upon a true patriot, a generous-hearted and most exemplary citizen. The nominations of John Nevin for captain, H.C. Alleman for first lieutenant, and Henry Lyne for second lieutenant were unanimously ratified by the company. The company marched into Camp Curtin on the 30th of April, and were at once mustered into the United States service by captain Seneca G. Simmons, U.S.A., for the period of three months. The Verbeke Rifles completed the organization of the regiment, and its colonel, R.A. Oakford, was, placed in command of Camp Curtin, and lieutenant Alleman was made post-adjutant. The regiment was ordered to Lancaster, Pa., and on the 13th of May encamped on the Fair Grounds near that city, where they were formed into a brigade under general James S. Negley. Here they drilled until the 3d of June, when they embarked for Chambersburg, going into camp about six miles beyond that town, where they remained one week, and then marched to Hagerstown, Md., where they formed a part of the Second Division, under major-general Keim. Near this town they encamped a few days, and then marched to the Potomac River, near Williamsport, on the famous battle-field of Antietam, where some of them afterwards fell in that sanguinary struggle. On the 1st of July they forded the Potomac River at Williamsport, under major-general Patterson, and constituted a portion of the reserve at the battle of Falling Waters. They occupied Martinsburg on the following day, and celebrated the 4th of July by placing the \"stars and stripes\" on the Berkeley County court-house. Halting here a few days while armed recognizances were constantly thrown out to feel the whereabouts and strength of the enemy, a march to Bunker Hill was made, driving in the pickets of the rebel general, Joseph E. Johnston, who was found strongly fortified at Winchester, as was demonstrated by our recognizance. After a rest here of two days the army made a demonstration against Johnston's lines and then directed to the left, occupying Charlestown on the 12th of July, where they remained until the following Sunday, when they marched homewards and occupied Harper's Ferry, hearing distinctly the booming of the distant cannon at the battle of Bull Run. Remaining one week at Harper's Ferry, the regiment marched back to Hagerstown, and were mustered out of service at Carlisle on the following 8th of August, when they were paid off in gold. This company lost three of its men by death. lieutenant Lyne resigned just previous to the regiment crossing the Potomac, and was succeeded by First sergeant Samuel Wolfe, who was afterwards, as a lieutenant of the Forty-sixth Regiment, killed at the head of his command. During the last two months of their term of service captain Nevin and lieutenant Alleman acted upon a general court-martial in conjunction with their company duties, lieutenant Alleman being the judge-advocate of the court. With scarcely an exception all of the survivors of this company returned to the field, and while many of them became distinguished for gallantry, nearly all of them were promoted during the war to the grades of line-officers, while some of them reached the highest rank of field-officers. The Verbeke Rifles did their full duty, and its members acquitted themselves in subsequent organizations with credit to themselves, and honor to the good old county of Dauphin.\n\nROLL OF COMPANY E, FIFTEENTH REGIMENT (THREE MONTHS' SERVICE).\n\nRecruited at Harrisburg, and mustered in May 1, 1861.\n\nCaptain.\n\nJohn Nevin.\n\nFirst Lieutenant.\n\nH.C.

The other companies, as a general thing, served in the first campaign, and were recruited in Allegheny, Berks, Potter, Luzerne, and Northumberland Counties.\n\nRendezvousing at Camp Curtin, the regiment was organized on the 1st of September, 1861, by the selection of the following field-officers: Joseph F. Knipe, of Dauphin County, who had served during the three months' campaign on the staff of general E.C. Williams, colonel; James L. Selfridge, from captain of Company C, lieutenant-colonel; Arnold C. Lewis, major. On the 22nd of September, major Lewis, while attempting to enforce discipline in a case of insubordination, was shot and instantly killed by a private of Company I, who afterwards suffered the extreme penalty of the law for his offense. captain J.A. Matthews, of Company A, was promoted to major.\n\nUpon the resignation of general Patterson from the command of the Army of the Shenandoah, general Banks was appointed to succeed him. His forces were posted on the Upper Potomac, along the Maryland shore, in the neighborhood of Harper's Ferry. Soon after its organization, the Forty-sixth was ordered to general Banks' command. Upon its arrival it was assigned to the First Brigade (under general S.W. Crawford) of the Second Division of his corps. Little of interest, save the usual drill and camp duty and an occasional skirmish with the enemy, occurred until the opening of the spring campaign. In January, 1862, Stonewall Jackson, with a well-appointed force of all arms, having for some time occupied the Shenandoah Valley, had pushed out as far west as Hancock, where he was met and driven back by general Lander. Lander pursued but soon after died, and was succeeded in command by general Shields, who continued the pursuit\n\nto Winchester. On the 24th of February, general Banks commenced crossing the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, and occupied, in turn, Leesburg, Charlestown, Martinsburg, and Winchester. Shields continued the pursuit of Jackson as far as New Market, whence he returned to Winchester. In the mean time Banks had dispatched one division of his corps to Centreville, and had himself departed for Washington. Considering himself superior to the Union force remaining, Jackson turned upon Shields, and a severe engagement ensued in the neighborhood of Kernstown. Three companies of the Forty-sixth, under command of major Matthews, arrived upon the field in time to participate in the conflict. Jackson was beaten, and Banks returning gave chase, which was continued to Woodstock. In this pursuit the Forty-sixth was conspicuous, Col. Knipe manifesting his usual enterprise and daring.\n\nJackson, who was fearful of a union of the forces of Fremont and Banks, marched hastily across the mountain to McDowell, where he encountered the head of Fremont's column, under Milroy and Schenck, and defeated it, inflicting considerable loss. Returning with his characteristic celerity of movement, and masking his progress by his cavalry, he fell suddenly upon Col. Kenley, occupying an outpost at Front Royal, and, routing his small force, was making for the rear of Banks' army, before the latter was aware of an enemy's presence in his front. Turning his trains towards the Potomac, and dispersing the rebel cavalry which appeared upon his rear, Banks commenced his retreat down the valley. Finding that he must make a stand to save his trains, he drew up his little army in line of battle in front of Winchester, and with an entire force of only about seven thousand men prepared to meet Jackson with not less than twenty thousand. For five hours the unequal contest was maintained, the Forty-sixth holding its ground with unexampled coolness and bravery. At length, finding himself outflanked and likely to be overpowered, he withdrew and made his way to the Potomac, where his trains had already arrived and crossed in safety. In this engagement the Forty-sixth lost four killed, ten wounded, and three taken prisoners. The loss to the Union force in withdrawing through the streets of the town was considerable, the inhabitants, both male and female, vying with each other in pouring forth insults and deadly missiles. \"My retreating column,\" says general Banks in his official report, \"suffered serious loss in the streets of Winchester, males and females vied with each other in increasing the number of their victims by firing from the houses, throwing hand grenade s, hot water, and missiles of every description.\"\n\nUpon the appointment of general Pope to the command of the Army of Northern Virginia, the scattered forces upon the Rappahannock, the Shenandoah, and in West Virginia were concentrated and were organized in three corps, commanded respectively by Sigel (formerly Fremont), Banks. and McDowell. On the 7th of August. 1862, Crawford's brigade was stationed at Culpeper Court-House. The divisions of Ewell and Stonewall Jackson, followed by that of Hill, a force twenty-five thousand strong, had already arrived upon the Rapidan, and had commenced crossing, driving back the Union cavalry. On the 8th, Crawford was ordered forward towards Cedar Mountain, and on the following morning Banks followed with the rest of his corps, consisting of seven thousand men. Jackson, having pushed forward his columns with celerity, had taken position with his artillery on Cedar Mountain, at an elevation of two hundred feet above the surrounding plain, but had kept his infantry masked under the shadow of the forests. Four guns had been advanced farther to the front and lower down the side of the mountain. These, with the more elevated ones, opened on Crawford's brigade, and at five o'clock P.M. the Union forces in two columns advanced to the attack. The position of the Forty-sixth fell opposite the enemy's advanced pieces, and upon these the men charged with desperate valor. But before reaching them they had to pass an open field, now covered with shocks of full-ripened wheat. Here they were fearfully exposed, and the enemy's artillery, and his strong lines of infantry concealed from view, poured in a merciless storm of shot and shell. Three times was it led to the charge across that fatal plain, when Col. Knipe fell severely wounded, and the regiment was withdrawn. \"Had victory been possible,\" says Greeley, \"they would have won it. . . . The best blood of the Union was poured out like water. . .\n\ngeneral Crawford's brigade came out of the fight a mere skeleton.\" The loss in the Forty-sixth was thirty killed, thirty-four severely wounded, and six prisoners. Among the killed were Lieuts. Robert Wilson, S.H. Jones, and William P. Caldwell, and among the wounded Col. Knipe, major Matthews, Capts. Lukenbaugh, Brooks, and Foulke, and Lieuts. Selheimer, Caldwell, Craig, and Matthews.\n\nIn the battle of Antietam, Banks' corps was commanded by general Mansfield, and early in the day of September 17th was led to the support of Hooker, battling with a heavy force of the enemy on the extreme right of the line, across Antietam Creek. Crawford's brigade was sent to the support of Ricketts' division, and advanced carrying the woods to the right of and beyond the cornfield, and maintained its position until relieved by Sedgwick's division of Sumner's corps. The Forty-sixth was here led by Col. Knipe, although suffering from the effects of his wounds. The loss was six killed and three severely wounded. captain George A. Brooks, of Harrisburg, was among the killed. Soon after the battle of Antietam, Col. Knipe was promoted to brigadier-general, and assigned to the command of the brigade; lieutenant-Col. Selfridge was promoted to colonel; major Matthews to colonel of the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania, which was assigned to Knipe's brigade; captain William L. Foulke, of Company B, to lieutenant-colonel, and captain Cyrus Strouse, of Company K, to major. Upon the inauguration of the Fredericksburg campaign, the Forty-sixth, which was then lying with the division at Fairfax, was ordered forward, but did not arrive upon the field in time to be engaged.\n\nIn the reorganization of the army, which was made upon the accession of general Joseph Hooker to the chief command, Knipe's brigade became the Second of the First Division of the Twelfth Corps, the division being commanded by general A.S. Williams, and the corps by general Slocum.\n\nOn the 27th of April, 1863, the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps, which had been lying near Falmouth during the winter, marched north to Kelly's Ford, where they crossed the Rappahannock, thence to Germania Ford, where they crossed the Rapidan, and arrived at Chancellorsville without encountering serious opposition. Here it was joined by the Fifth Corps, and on the 30th by the Third Corps. There were three roads centring at Chancellorsville, the main direction of each being eastward. Upon each of these Hooker ordered an advance on the morning of the 1st of May, Meade upon the left, Sykes commanding a division of regulars belonging to the Fifth Corps in the centre, and Howard upon the right. At two o'clock P.M., the movement commenced, and after proceeding some three miles the central column encountered the enemy in considerable force, and Knipe's brigade was sent to its support, where it was engaged, and lost some men; whereupon Hooker ordered a retrograde movement and a concentration upon the line of the previous night with the Chancellor House as headquarters, Meade on the left, Slocum in the centre, and Howard somewhat in the air on the right. Desultory fighting continued during the day of the 2nd of May, when, at near nightfall, Stonewall Jackson, with twenty -five thousand men, burst like an avalanche upon Howard's corps, resting unsuspicious of danger, and drove it in rout and confusion in upon the centre. This brought the enemy upon Slocum's right, and during the early part of the night a sharp conflict was kept up, wherein Knipe's brigade was engaged, losing many in killed and wounded, and a considerable number of prisoners. Here fell major Strouse, his body riddled with bullets, while attempting to escape when called on to surrender. At midnight a countercharge was made by Birney's division, and a part of the guns lost by Howard, and his abandoned rifle-pits, were regained, and the enemy thrown into same confusion. On the morning of the 3d, Williams' brigade was sent to the support of Birney, and here the battle raged with great fury, the enemy losing heavily, and being broken and driven in great confusion. Upon the return of Hooker to the north bank of the Rappahannock the regiment occupied its old camp, where it remained until the advance of the army into Pennsylvania. The loss in the Chancellorsville campaign was four killed, a considerable number wounded, two severely, and two taken prisoners. major Strouse and lieutenant O.R. Priestly were among the killed.\n\nEarly in June, Lee commenced a movement north, marching down the Shenandoah Valley, and crossing the Potomac at Williamsport. On the 1st of July he met the Union army at Gettysburg. On the evening of the same day the Twelfth Corps arrived upon the field, and was posted on the right of the line holding the summits of Culp's Hill, where a formidable breastwork was thrown up. On the afternoon of the 2nd the First and Second Divisions were ordered to the support of the left, leaving their works unoccupied, save by a thin line of Green's brigade, of the Second Division. During their absence the enemy attacked and carried the left of the works, and, upon their return at evening, they found the rebels in possession. Dispositions were promptly made to retake them. Before dawn of the 3d a heavy fire of infantry and artillery was opened upon the enemy, and after an obstinate resistance of several hours he was driven back at the point of the bayonet. The Forty-sixth held the extreme right of the line, and after the reoccupation of the breast-works, was pushed across an open space beyond Spangler's Spring, and held a piece of wood fringing Rock Creek. The loss, owing to the sheltered position which the regiment occupied, was inconsiderable.\n\nUpon the withdrawal of Lee into Virginia, the Union army followed up his line of retreat, at the same time covering Washington until it reached the Rapidan. Here the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps were detached from the Army of the Potomac and ordered to the support of Rosecrans in Tennessee and Northern Georgia. Marching to Washington, the regiment proceeded by rail to Nashville. Here the First Division was detailed to guard time Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad from Tullahoma to Bridgeport. The country through which the road passes was infested with guerrillas and rebel cavalry, ever watchful for an opportunity to destroy the road and to wreck the trains. It was vital to the existence of the army that this line should be kept open and that it should be operated to its utmost capacity. The vigilance and fidelity with which this service was performed on the part of the Forty-sixth elicited the warm approval of its superior officers.\n\nEarly in January, 1864, a large proportion of the officers and men of the regiment having re-enlisted for a second term of three years, insuring its continuance as an organization, they were given a veteran furlough and proceeded to Pennsylvania.* Here its ranks were rapidly recruited, and upon its return the division rejoined the corps in winter-quarters in and about Chattanooga.\n\nOn the 6th of May Sherman's army, seventy thousand strong, with one hundred and fifty guns, broke up winter-quarters amid moved on the ever memorable Atlanta campaign. At Dalton, where Johnston, who commanded the rebel army, was first met, the enemy was turned out of a position strong by nature and well fortified by a flank movement through Snake Creek Gap, which had already been captured by Geary's division.\n\nFollowing up the retreating enemy, Sherman found him well intrenched at Resaca, prepared to dispute his further progress. Here Sherman again attempted a movement by the right flank; but Johnston, taking advantage of his antagonist's weakened lines in front, delivered a heavy and well-sustained attack, falling upon the divisions of Hooker and Schofield. He found Hooker not unprepared for the encounter, and after a bloody conflict Johnston was driven, with a loss of four guns and many prisoners. In this engagement the Forty-sixth participated, losing three killed and five wounded.\n\nPushing the enemy steadily back, on the 25th of May the regiment was again engaged at Pumpkinvine Creek and at New Hope Church. The country is here broken and the enemy was well intrenched, his lines stretching across Lost, Pine, and Kenesaw Mountains, from Dallas to Marietta, presenting an unbroken front. From the 25th of May until near the middle of June, Sherman, always fruitful in resources, operated against the enemy's lines, compelling him, by constant battering and picket firing and by frequent assaults gradually to give ground, taking first Pine Knob, then Lost Mountain, and at length the long line of breastworks connecting the latter with Kenesaw. Finally, on the 22nd of June, the enemy, finding himself slowly but surely pushed from his strong position, suddenly assumed the offensive and made a furious attack upon Hooker's corps, in position near the Culp House. It fell principally upon Knipe's brigade and was led by Hood, but signally failed. Hood was repulsed with heavy loss, including some prisoners. \"Williams' division,\" says general Thomas in his official report, skirmished itself into position on the right of Geary's division, the right of Williams resting at Culp's house, on the Powder Spring and Marietta road. About 4 P.M. the enemy in heavy force attacked Knipe's brigade in its advanced position before his men had time to throw up any works, and persisted in the assault until sundown, when they withdrew, their ranks hopelessly broken, each assault having been repelled with heavy loss.\" In the various engagements at Dallas, Pine Knob, Kenesaw Mountain, and Marietta, in all of which the Forty-sixth participated, the loss was fourteen killed and about thirty wounded. captain D.H. Chesebro and lieutenant J.W. Phillips were among the killed.\n\nOn the 16th of July Sherman crossed the Chattahoochee River, and sweeping around to the left, began closing in upon Atlanta, McPherson reaching out to strike the Augusta Railroad. While these movements were in full progress and the army only partially across Peach Tree Creek, a considerable stream running in a westerly direction in front of Atlanta, Hood again attacked, leading a heavy force and precipitating it with great violence upon the Union columns, falling principally upon Newton's and upon Hooker's corps. The Forty-sixth was much exposed and suffered severely; but with ranks undismayed, led by Col. Selfridge, who was in the thickest of the fight, conspicuous by his white, flowing locks, encouraging and steadying his men, they hurled back the rebel hordes at the point of the bayonet. With columns sadly decimated, Hood retreated from the field, leaving five hundred dead, one thousand severely wounded, and many prisoners in the hands of the victors. The loss in the regiment was ten killed and twenty-two wounded. captain S.T. Ketrer, Lieuts. H.J. Davis, Samuel Wolf, and David C. Selheimer, and Adj. Luther R. Whitman were among the killed.\n\nShifting the Army of the Tennessee from the left to the extreme right, Sherman was preparing to cut off the railroads and invest the city on the south, when Hood, detecting the movement, again fell upon the Union lines only partially formed. The attack was made with the rebel leader's characteristic impetuosity, but it fell like the beating of the mad waves of the sea against the immovable cliff. The regiment lost here six killed and a considerable number wounded.\n\nOn the 1st of September Atlanta surrendered and Sherman's victorious columns entered the city in triumph. The hard fighting of the regiment was now ended. general Knipe was here transferred to the command of cavalry and Col. Selfridge to the brigade, leaving Major Patrick Griffith in command of the regiment. On the 11th of November Sherman commenced his march to the sea. On the 21st of December he reached Savannah, and after a brief conflict at Fort McAllister took possession of the city. With but a brief respite he faced his columns to the north, and on the 17th of February Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, was taken without resistance, and a month later he reached Goldsborough, the end of his hostile wayfaring. Johnston surrendered on the 26th of April, and the army immediately commenced its homeward march. On the 16th of July, 1865, the Forty-sixth Regiment, after nearly four years of faithful service, was mustered out near Alexandria, Va.\n\nROLL OF COMPANY D, FORTY-SIXTH REGIMENT (THREE YEARS' SERVICE).\n\nRecruited in Dauphin Coasty.\n\nCaptains.\n\nGeorge A.

Campbell, of Cambria County, colonel; Barnabas McDermit, of Cambria County, lieutenant-colonel; John P. Linton, of Cambria County, major. Col. Campbell and many of the officers and men had served during the three months' campaign, and lieutenant-Col. McDermit possessed military experience acquired in the Mexican war. The men were drilled by squads and companies while in camp, and Company F, captain Davis, for some time performed guard duty at the State arsenal. On the 27th of February, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Washington, and upon its arrival went into camp near Bladensburg Cemetery. Here the altered flintlock muskets furnished by the State were exchanged for the Belgian rifles. On the 29th of March the regiment was ordered to proceed to Harper's Ferry, and report to Col. Miles. Upon his arrival Col. Campbell was directed to make a disposition of his force along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and Company F, captain G.W.P. Davis, was stationed at Sleepy Creek Bridge, seventeen miles west of Martinsburg. The country through which that portion of the railroad runs, which the regiment was required to guard, was considered by the rebels as their own territory, and the majority of the population in the vicinity was rebel at heart. Numerous guerrilla bands, led by daring and reckless chieftains, roved the country, pillaging and burning the property of Union inhabitants, and watchful for an opportunity to burn the railroad bridges, cut the wires of the telegraph, and destroy the road. To guard this great thoroughfare, of vital importance to the government, to suppress guerrilla warfare, to afford protection to the harassed and helpless people, was the duty which the regiment was assigned to perform. Col. Campbell at once assumed the offensive, and hunted them instead of waiting to let them hunt him. Almost daily, from some part of the line, squads were sent out to engage and capture these roving bands led by such partisans as Edwards, White, Imboden, and McNeil, and many were brought in.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the 25th of May, 1862, all the locomotives on the railroad west of Harper's Ferry were hurried through to Cumberland, the engineers bringing the first intelligence of the retreat of Banks and the approach of Stonewall Jackson to Martinsburg. At nine o'clock that night Col. Campbell received the following dispatch from Col. Miles: \"Concentrate your regiment at South Branch. general Banks defeated and driven through Martinsburg. Expect an attack here hourly. Mean to fight.\" The success of Jackson, and the consequent withdrawal from the road, had inspired the roving bands with new life, and they became more troublesome than ever, wandering up and down the country, pillaging indiscriminately from friend and foe. The several companies were kept constantly on the alert, and with an energy and enterprise rarely equaled, the territory was scoured, many of the squads penetrating the interior twenty and thirty miles, capturing and dispersing the guerrillas, restoring stolen property, and successfully protecting and preserving the road.\n\nThe rebel a"
