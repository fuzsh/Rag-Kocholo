Tredyffrin and Easttown soldiers fought in some of the most strategic battles of the 1864 campaigns, where battle was fierce and the enemy was engaged almost every day.\n\nGeneral Ulysses Grant was given command of all Union armies on March 9, 1864. He was most of all a soldier, a straight-forward man who would not be distracted from his major objectives. Politics, policy, and even lesser battle would not deter him. He set out to defeat the two main armies of the Confederacy: the Army of Northern Virginia under the command of General Robert E. Lee, and the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph C. Johnston.\n\nLocal fighting men would distinguish themselves in both these campaigns. Local infantry soldiers in the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James would fight at Bermuda Hundred, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor in Virginia. Farther south, local cavalry men rode through Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia with Union Generals William T. Sherman and Philip H. Sheridan.\n\nJanuary of 1864 did not foretell what was to come. Many local men were home on long furloughs. A number of regiments were nearing the end of their three-year enlistments; for some soldiers the furlough was a reward for re-enlisting. Winter months were the time for furloughs, as the soldiers spent these months in camps, waiting and preparing for the resumption of fighting in the spring.\n\nPage 144\n\nAt home in Reeseville in January 1864 was cavalry soldier Henry Clay Burns, son of Peter Burns Sr., whose place was just north of the Old Provincial [Conestoga] Road. Peter Burns Sr. was a carpenter, and was doing his part by working at the Naval Yard in Philadelphia.\n\nYoung Harry Burns was a sergeant in Company H of the 7th Cavalry of Pennsylvania Volunteers. His unit at this time was quartered at Columbia, Tennessee. With him in Company H were local friends Isaac \"Chalky\" Singles, Joseph D. Home, George L. Beatty, and James C. Smiley. All but Beatty re-enlisted. (Officers had suggested to Home that he was getting too old for re-enlistment, but Home said \"I enlisted in this fight to see it through, and I will.\" He was one who would come back without a scratch.)\n\nThe 7th Cavalry was a colorful outfit of veteran soldiers. Often they engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand battles with sword and sabre. When the local men went back to the camp at Columbia, several other younger local men went back with them to begin training at the camp. They included Jonathan M. Lewis, Ethelbert Lobb, William Mullen, Wesley Linsley, and John Linsley. There they met up with another local fellow, Joseph Kugler.\n\nWith new recruits, the ranks of the 7th Cavalry swelled to 1800 men. They set about making preparations for the spring campaigns. Their ccmmander, Colonel Spikes, had secured new Spencer carbines and new horse equipment, and the entire regiment was newly mounted.\n\nAlso home in January 1864 were some of the men re-enlisting in the 97th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. The regiment at that time was stationed at Fernandino, Florida. The 97th Regiment had been recruited in Chester County at the end of the three-month enlistment of the 9th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers. Local men were recruited for Company C, the Paoli Guards; and Company K, the Wayne Guards.\n\nCompany C was recruited by Isaiah Price, a West Chester dentist. Many of its earliest volunteers came from the Paoli area, hence the name of the company. Other men in the company came from just outside Tredyffrin Township -- Willistown, East Whiteland, Warren Tavern -- but for our purposes we will not include them here. The story of their valor, too, is deep in the history of the 97th Regiment, as Major Price wrote in 1875. Company C,the Paoli Guards, numbered 104 men.\n\nCompany K, the Wayne Guards, was originally recruited by William Wayne, of Easttown, a descendant of General Anthony Wayne of Revolutionary War fame. Captain Wayne was no longer with his company in 1864 however; he had been in action from April 1862 until January 1863, at which time he had been discharged on account of incapacitating disease by order of the Secretary of War.\n\nPage 145\n\nCommanding Company K in 1864 was Captain Samuel V. Black, a merchant from Spread Eagle. Company K numbered 89 men. (Records in some detail were kept for volunteers mustered in the regiment's companies, while those of draftees and substitutes were kept in separate, undetailed lists.)\n\nUp until 1864 the 97th Regiment had spent most of its time guarding the forts along the southern coast. More men were lost to the regiment by disease than by bullets. Northern soldiers found the damp southern climate debilitating; some died, others were permanently dismissed by reason of incapacitating disease, frequently listed as yellow fever or malarial fever. In addition to Captain Wayne, other men sent home on Surgeon's Certificate included Joseph Kugler, of Tredyffrin; Isaac Paschall, Tredyffrin; Jonathan Cook, Spread Eagle; John Famous, Spread Eagle; and Charles W. Brown, Spread Eagle. Private William C. Lewis, of Chester Valley, was also discharged after being wounded in action at James Island, South Carolina, on June 10, 1862.\n\nOn August 23, 1864 the 97th Regiment was ordered to move north from Fernandino, Florida to Virginia to reinforce the Army of the James under General Benjamin Butler. Those who had not re-enlisted at that time had only three months left of their enlistments..\n\nAt Yorktown the Regiment embarked on a fleet of about 100 ships and sailed to Bermuda Hundred Landing in Virginia. There, on May 7, 1864, they disembarked unhindered by any Confederate fire. The Army of the Potomac, in the meantime, was marching toward Richmond from the north. General Butler's orders were to march his 10th Army Corps, a force of some 33,000 men, from south of the James north toward Richmond.\n\nFrom Bermuda Hundred Landing Butler's forces went inland about eight miles and began to dig trenches and set up camp. Butler's earthworks extended from the James River to the tidewater of the Appomatox below. With the camp readied, Butler set off to destroy the railroad and to set up obstacles to impede the movement of the Confederate cavalry. Company C, the Paoli Guards, of the 97th Regiment, remained at camp on picket duty.\n\nThe weather had turned very warm, and the men on the march with Butler came upon heavy coats and haversacks shed by the fleeing Confederates. The Union men were surprised at the meagerness of the Rebel food supplies in the knapsacks: the Southerners had carried only a little corn meal and some slices of cold pork.\n\nAfter a few minor skirmishes with the enemy, the 10th Corps soon found itself chased back to Bermuda Hundred by the Confederate forces under General Beauregard. On May 16th General Beauregard attacked General Butler's headquarters.\n\nHistory has not been kind to General Butler; his name is often accompanied by the modifier \"inept\". Thus, in the worst of circumstances, the 97th Regiment proved its extraordinary valor in battle in the fighting at Bermuda Hundred from May 18 through May 20, 1864.\n\nPage 146\n\nOn May 18th, the first day of the Battle of Foster's Place at Bermuda Hundred, Company C was again on picket duty. The regimental commander, Colonel Guss, was away, and the regiment was under the command of Major Galusha Pennypacker of Phoenixville, then only twenty-two years old. In Samuel Bates' history of the Pennsylvania Volunteer armies, he wrote that on that day the Pennsylvania 97th advanced, under the command of Major Pennypacker and Major Price, in the face of hot musket fire. The line fought all day, and replacements did not arrive until after 10 p.m. In Major Isaiah Price's history of the 97th Regiment, he recorded that on this first day seventeen were mortally wounded, fifteen wounded too badly to return to battle, twenty-two less seriously wounded, and one captured. The fighting at Foster's Place continued the next day.\n\nSergeant Joseph Acker of Tredyffrin was among those killed outright at Foster's Place. Major Price wrote of the \"field accident\" that caused the death of a loyal young soldier. A very young lieutenant, a staff officer, he wrote, had been sent out from headquarters for observation. He asked if rebels were in a certain patch of woods. The men on the line had been under heavy fire, and were well aware of where the heaviest fire was coming from, and Sergeant Acker reported that the place was \"filled with rebels\". In spite of this, the lieutenant ordered Acker to take women with him and scout for Rebels in the woods. Major Price was away from the Company, on duty with Major Pennypacker, and no one who was nearby out-ranked the lieutenant. With no one to appeal to, the good soldier felt he must obey the command. (Price wrote that a lesser soldier might have refused.) As Sergeant Acker approached the woods he was shot through the heart. The two privates with him dragged his lifeless body back to camp. The lieutenant quickly withdrew from the line, it was further reported, never to be identified or held accountable.\n\nCorporal M. Davis Thomas of Paoli was also mortally wounded on the same day. Captain Black, commander of Company K, was also wounded but would soon be back in action.\n\nAt this point General Butler's campaign was degenerating into simply an effort to avoid being pushed back into the James River by General Beauregard's army. On May 20 the fighting at Bermuda Hundred continued in the Battle of Green Plains.\n\nDuring the night of May 19-20, Companies A, B, C and E had moved out on the line in preparation for a possible attack by the Confederates before morning. Major Price was in charge of the line. To the left of the 97th was the 9th Regiment of Maine Volunteers. All night the men on the line heard Confederate artillery moving into place.\n\nAs the morning of May 20 dawned the men could see, through occasional patches of light, that a mass of enemy troops had concentrated during the night all along the enemy line. (The soldiers would later prove to be General Pickett's army of 10,000 veterans.) They outnumbered the Federals by 10 to 1. The enemy had also built a full earth works on a knoll, about a half mile in front of the Union position, with an embrasure for three guns.\n\nPage 147\n\nMajor Price sent for Major Calvin, the field officer of the day, but he could not be found. As the morning mist cleared, the men saw that their worst fears were justified and that reinforcements were needed. When Major Calvin finally appeared, however, the mist had set in again. His conclusion was that Major Price was just \"figity\", and that only the usual pickets would be needed, even though Price insisted that an attack was coming and that reinforcements should be ready in place.\n\nAt that moment three Confederate regiments emerged from hiding and began firing directly into the 9th Maine. At this point Major Calvin left, and the men on the line were left to fend for themselves. The 9th Maine fled without firing a shot. Major Price tried to rally them, but continuing attacks sent them all to the rear.\n\nSoon attacks from the front, right, and rear sent the 97th back to the trenches, where a ravine or ditch gave the men cover. Finally, more men were sent up, including 300 men from the 97th who had not been on the line earlier. Although still badly outnumbered, at around four in the afternoon the Union soldiers were ordered to attack. This assault on the Rebel troops is known as the Battle of Green Plains. The charging men of the 97th Regiment made easy targets for the Confederates. Two-thirds of the first attacking line went down in a matter of minutes. The others watched from the ravine.\n\nThe soldiers in the ravine were able to hold off the Confederates who sought to take them captive. By creeping stealthily through the grass the Union men were also able to bring back some of the dead and wounded; the wounded they dragged back into the ravine, the dead they piled in front of the ravine, covering them with dirt, to protect the living.\n\nNow ammunition was running low. By good fortune a private from the 13th Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, which had been sent up during the attack, had somehow become separated from his company and was with the Pennsylvania 97th. He knew that some ammunition had been left in the grass by the Indiana soldiers, although to reach it meant crossing about a quarter of a mile of open space in full sight of the enemy's guns.\n\nEven though Corporal Isaac Cleaver of Easttown, a member of Company C, was already wounded with a ball in his foot, he volunteered to go with the Indiana soldier to salvage what they could. The two soldiers crept to the ammunition, piled it on blankets, and dragged it back to the ravine. (Isaac Cleaver was at this time only 21 years old. The incidents of that day foretell the nature of the man who would later become the most colorful and prominent of Berwyn's later 19th century leaders.)\n\nAs night fell the men were still huddled in the ravine, trying as best they could to treat the wounded. At around 10 p.m. the men decided to try to make it back to camp. Young Corporal Cleaver again came to their rescue, crawling across \"no-man's land\" and hailing a sentry who fortunately recognized his voice. At a pre-arranged signal, two shots, the men ran from the ravine and back into the Union lines.\n\nPage 148\n\nCleaver was sent back to a hospital at Point Lookout, Maryland, and was mustered out in September of 1864 at the expiration of his term.\n\nMajor Price was also wounded in the left thigh during the battle, but would not be long out of action. Later in the year he would be hospitalized for malaria.\n\nFor several days after the Battle of Green Plains the 97th seemed broken and desolate. Price wrote in his history, \"At roll call the sad answers 'dead', 'wounded', or 'prisoner' told of the absence of many men who would never again respond to the call.\" Every night two or three more bodies would be brought in under darkness, the enemy not allowing the men to bury their dead under a flag of truce. The 97th Regiment had suffered 184 casualties in the Battle of Green Plains: 44 men were killed outright, eight officers and 120 men were wounded; and 12 were taken prisoner.\n\nGeneral Butler now had his 10th Army Corps trapped at Bermuda Hundred, on the peninsula of land between the James and Appomatox rivers. At the neck of the peninsula General Beauregard had his forces strung so well he decided he could contain Butler with just a part of his army, sending some of his troops up to Richmond to support General Lee. When Grant finally figured out what had happened to Butler he said, \"Butler's army is as much out of the strategic picture now as if it were in a strongly corked bottle.\"\n\nThe generals of the Army of the Potomac, however, assisted Butler's Army of the James out of Bermuda Hundred. On May 27 the 97th Regiment was ordered by Grant to move by transport to Cold Harbor, Virginia, to join with the Army of the Potomac in the action there. The 97th was in the front line from May 27 to June 2.\n\nCorporal James J. Dewees, of Paoli, was wounded there on June 6.\n\nAlso with the Army of the Potomac at Cold Harbor was the 71st Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers. A surgeon of this regiment was 25-year old Dr. John Aiken, son of Thomas Aiken, farmer and weaver in the Valley near Howellville and later of Reeseville. The 71st was part of General Winfield Scott Hancock's 2nd Army Corps. (Hancock was from Norristown, and was one of the most able of Grant's generals.) The men of the 71st were veteran soldiers of the Gettysburg campaign of July 1863.\n\nDr. John Aiken had enlisted in the 71st as Assistant Surgeon in August of 1862. He had been promoted to Surgeon in April of 1863.\n\nIn May and June of 1864 the unit was sent into some of the most fierce fighting the war would know, in a direct frontal attack on Lee's forces; hand-to-hand fighting in the Wilderness, where the wounded were trapped in the fire and smoke of the Wilderness; at Spotsylvania, and then Cold Harbor.\n\nPage 149\n\nAt Cold Harbor the Union troops marched through swamp water and mud, men falling with each step from the guns of the Rebel sharpshooters. The battle went on in the blazing heat. The wounded lay on the field in the hot sun for three days before Grant and Lee could agree on terms for them to be brought from the battlefield. When terms for a cease-fire finally were worked out, the wounded were more dead than alive. (Grant abandoned this kind of direct frontal attack after Cold Harbor; it was just not successful. In 1864 the armies did not withdraw when forced back; they counter-attacked. The cost of this kind of warfare was a staggering 60,000 Union casualties in the spring of 1864! Grant would later himself say that Cold Harbor had been a major mistake.)\n\nTwo of the largest army hospitals were set up in June, one at Spotsylvania Court House in May and the other at Cold Harbor. The hospital at Cold Harbor served seventeen regiments. Here the army surgeons labored to help the wounded of both armies.\n\nThe Chaplain at the hospital at Cold Harbor was Alexander Morrison Stewart, who would later be the pastor of the Trinity Presbyterian Church from 1866 to 1868. The Reverend Stewart had been an army chaplain since the first month of the war, serving first with the Pennsylvania 13th Regiment and then with the Pennsylvania 102nd Regiment. He wrote a book about his war experiences -- not a history of battles but more about what war does to men. The book, Camp, March, and Battlefield, was published in Philadelphia in 1865.\n\nWhile no newcomer to battlefield experiences, after the Battle of Cold Harbor on June 6, 1864 he wrote of a new kind of despair: \"Were passing events merely written of, there would be a repetition of a long, sickening, almost endless detail of bloodshed; of killing, of ghastly mutilation on the human body, from the crown of the head to the sole of the feet -- not a single part of it that has not been seen torn, lacerated and broken in every possible manner. Even a sickly public curiosity may at length have become sated, sickness, clogged with these bloody details. Our duties are daily and nightly business with the dead, the dying and the tortures. And still the struggle is waged, with, if possible, increased eagerness and fury. No appearance of termination. Each party apparently as ready for the conflict as when it began in the Wilderness a month ago.\"\n\nNewspapers in Northern cities were now writing that the war would soon be over, the South would be starved into surrendering. But Stewart wrote from Cold Harbor that this was not true. The Confederates, he explained, were not a people who could be starved into submission. He was shocked by the small bits of cold pork and corn meal he found on the bodies of the Rebel dead and dying as he went to their aid. Would the Union soldiers have a will to fight in such circumstances? Stewart saw that only a decisive defeat in battle could finish the war.\n\nPage 150\n\nFrom Cold Harbor the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James both moved toward Petersburg and Richmond. Not until April 2, 1865 would Richmond fall, but Lee was from now on in a defensive position. His army would only dwindle and the Union troops would be reinforced.\n\nWhile some units of the Union Army were disbanded in the summer of 1864 when their three year enlistments expired, the 97th Regiment had enough replacements to keep the regiment in action. Until later in the year, when it went back to guarding the coast in North Carolina, the 97th Regimenmt fought in the battles to force the Confederates from their secured positions at Petersburg and Richmond. Major battles in which the 97th was engaged included Cemetery Hill on June 3; Petersburg Heights on June 15; the mine explosion on July 30; Wier Bottom Church on August 25; at Charles City Road on October 7; and at Darby Tavern Road on October 27.\n\nTredyffrin and Easttown men of the 97th Regiment continued tc be among the casualties in these battles. Private James Manamee of Reeseville was wounded at Cemetery Hill near Petersburg Mine on June 3, and again, with the loss of an arm, in the trenches near Petersburg on July 18. Captain Samuel Black of Spread Eaqle was captured at Strawberry Plains. Lieutenant Levi L. March, Paoli, was mortally wounded in action at the Petersburg Mine with the loss of an arm and leg; he died August 14, 1864. Corporal Henry H. Stitler, Tredyffrin Township, was wounded by a shell in the trenches near Petersburg on August 29. Private Joseph Y. Morton was killed in action at Wier Bottom Church.\n\nIn fact, of the twenty-four men from Tredyffrin and Easttown who served in Company C and Company K of the 97th Regiment, only seven would not be war casualties: Lieutenant Harry Kauffman, Easttown; Private Oliver Channel, Easttown; Corporal William E. Davis, Spread Eagle; Corporal George S. Harrison, Spread Eagle; Private Theodore Beerbrawer, Chester Valley; Musician Casper C. Fahnstock, Paoli; and Musician John H. Kauffman, Paoli. (Both companies were mustered out on August 25, 1865.)\n\nWhile Lee was weakening in Virginia, the tragic losses of the North did not seem to be justified in the slow progress Grant's armies were making in Virginia. Lincoln's re-election that fall did not seem possible with the growing lists of casualties. But the progress made in the south did help to assure that election.\n\nBy summer, General William T. Sherman had driven General Joseph E. Johnston and the Confederates from the Tennessee border down to the edge of Atlanta. On September 2 Atlanta would fall to Federal troops.\n\nSergeant Harry Burns and his friends in the 7th Cavalry had been almost daily engaged in battle throughout the spring and summer. In April they rode with General Philip Sheridan toward Atlanta. Engagements came one after the other, often swift, hand-to-hand sabre battles. In June they were at Big Shanty, M'Afee Cross Roads, and Kenesaw Mountain, and later in the month they raided Covington and destroyed the railroad.\n\nPage 151\n\nOn August 1 they entered the trenches in front of Atlanta; on August 17 they moved with Kilpatrick on his raids; on August 19 there were skirmishes at Fairburn and Jonesboro, and on August 20 at Lovejoy Station. On October 12 they fought in the Battle of Rome, and two weeks later the Battle of Leeds Crossing closed the campaign.\n\nSuch a toll had been taken in the campaign -- a toll of men, horses, and equipment -- that the 7th Cavalry had to return to camp to be refitted for battle; the unit was no longer fit for the field. The men were sent to Louisville, Kentucky, and then on to Gravelly Springs, Alabama, to bere-equipped for duty in the spring.\n\nHarry Burns almost made it to the end of the 1864 campaign, but just a few days before the end he was struck with a musket ball in the leg at the battle of Galeville, Alabama on October 21. As was his custom, Sergeant Burns carried the flag into the battle. His friends knew that he had been hit when he pulled up and rode out.\n\nHe was in a hospital at Rome, Alabama for ten days, and then moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where his left leg was amputated six inches below the knee. His last letter home was from Chattanooga. He said he was \"getting along fine but it was a pretty tough row to hoe\". He died in the hospital at Chattanooga on November 19, 1864.\n\nCaptain C. L. Green, the commander of Company H, wrote to Harry Burns' brother Peter of Harry Burns' qualities as a gentleman and a soldier. Of the day Burns was wounded, Green said, \"No man fought braver than he did on that day.\"\n\nIn Bates' history of the Pennsylvania regiments it is recorded that Isaac \"Chalky\" Singles also died in the hospital at Chattanooga on November 19, 1864 from wounds received in battle.\n\nThe other men of the 7th Cavalry served until the end of the Rebellion. Wesley Linsley and Joseph Kugler were taken prisoner on October 1, 1864 and held until April 2, 1865. Jonathan Lewis, Ethelbert Lobb, Joe Home, and John Linsley were not war casualties, and were mustered out with their company on August 23, 1865.\n\nAs noted earlier, some of the units of the Union Army were disbanded in the summer of 1864 when their enlistments expired because their ranks became so depleted.\n\nPreston Lobb, son of William Lobb, a partner in the Fritz and Lobb Lumber and Coal Company in Reeseville, came home in the summer of 1864. He was one of five men in Battery F of the United States Artillery who was not a war casualty; the unit had numbered 295 men.\n\nThe 71st Regiment was mustered out in July 1864, its three years of volunteer service coming to an end then. Twenty-two hundred men had stood in its ranks; only 153 were left to muster out.\n\nPage 152\n\nSurgeon John Aiken of the 71st did not return home, however. Instead, he continued to operate in the field. His death in 1866 was reported in the Village Record on April 24: \"Dr. John Aiken died at his home in the Chester Valley from a disease contracted in the Army in August of 1864. \"A memorial from \"An Early Friend\" appeared in the same issue: \"With impaired health he remained forgetful of self, doing what he could for his fellow soldiers until the end of the war. Thus has the light of another young and promising life gone out, another of those sacrifices made which add to the lustre of the crimson bars of our banner.\"\n\nThese have not been the stories of great and powerful leaders; these were the sacrifices of ordinary men -- a few professionals, mostly farmers -who did the job at hand as best it could be done.\n\nIsaiah Price, in his history of one regiment, left words that give purpose for remembering the sacrifices of the years of the Rebellion.\n\n\"Not for the purposes,\" he wrote, \"of fostering in the minds of the youth of our country an undue love for glory in military achievements is this history written. But rather lest --while enjoying the blessings of peace secured unto them through those services and sacrifices of those times when others dedicated their lives to preserving the integrity and life of the nation in its hours of peril -- future generations may be left unreminded of the nature of those services, of what were the sacrifices and costs of our country's liberty, permanence and peace, demanding of them a jealous and perpetual guardianship.\"\n\nTop\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nWar Records of Soldiers from Tredyffrin and Easttown in Some Units of the Pennsylvania Volunteer Army\n\n97th Regiment\n\nCompany C : Paoli Guards\n\nLieutenant Henry Kauffman Jr., 23, farmer, Easttown, mustered out September 25, 1864 at expiration of term\n\nSergeant Joseph Acker, 26, farmer, Tredyffrin, killed at Foster's Place, Bermuda Hundred, Va., May 18, 1864\n\nSergeant Isaac Cleaver, 19, farmer, Radnor [later of Reeseville], wounded at Green Plains, Bermuda Hundred, Va. with ball in foot, discharged at U.S. Hospital, Point Lookout, Maryland; mustered out September 25, 1864 at expiration of term\n\nCorporal M.
