        "text": "Just as we were going into battle, General Wadsworth -that gray-haired old veteran whom the soldiers all loved- rode up. He held a revolver in one hand and with the other he caught the edge of the colors and ‘Follow Me, Boys!’ Head replied, ‘General, I’ll follow you anywhere!’ We charged among a lot of short pines when, looking back, we found that our line had been broken and that we were occupying an advanced position. We could see the rebels some distance in front of us, and for a moment we were undecided what to do. It was here that Frank Head received his fatal wound. We helped him along for a while and then he begged us to leave him. ‘Never mind me, boys, save the colors!’ We made him as comfortable as possible and pressed forward. He died soon after, but his body was recovered and his name perpetuated in Frank Head Post #16 of the G.A.R. in Brooklyn.\n\nHEAD, HENRY THOMAS (1837-1870). Major, 84th New York (14th Brooklyn) Infantry. After enlisting as a sergeant major at Brooklyn on April 13, 1861, he mustered into the 14th Brooklyn on May 23. He served valiantly at the Battle of First Bull Run, Virginia (his younger brother, Frank Head (see), also fought there with the 14th and was killed in that battle), and was promoted to first lieutenant and adjutant on August 3, 1861, and later to major on May 12, 1863, serving in that capacity at the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. As per an article in Military Images Magazine (2022), he suffered a slight head wound from a spent musket ball at Gettysburg. On June 6, 1864, he mustered out at New York City. His regiment elected him unanimously to the rank of lieutenant colonel when there was a vacancy in August 1869. During his military service, he contracted consumption that ultimately caused his death in March 1870. His last residence was at 127 Portland Avenue in Brooklyn. He was survived by his wife, Pamilla, whom he had married in 1868, and a son, Henry.\n\nMembers of the 14th assembled in uniform at the City Armory and took part in his funeral. According to a newspaper article about his funeral, Head was eulogized for his meritorious service to his country, his honorable military service, and the great respect he had earned from friends and comrades. The 14th, under the command of Colonel William DeBevoise (see), escorted the body to Green-Wood, accompanied by solemn music. Head was buried with full military honors. His casket, carried by a caisson, was draped with an American flag. Head’s horse from the Civil War, led by a groom, followed the caisson. Many ordinary citizens followed the procession. Section 107, lot 10179.\n\nHEALEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON (1846-1881). Private, 20th New York Cavalry, Company L. A native of Lackland, New York, Healey enlisted as a private at Norwich, New York, on September 1, 1864, and mustered into the 20th New York Cavalry on that date.

A farmer, he was 5′ 5″ tall with hazel eyes, dark hair and a florid complexion. He mustered out with his company on June 3, 1865, at Washington, D.C. In civilian life, he later worked as a gas fitter and as a clerk. Although he applied for an invalid pension, application 631,950, it was never certified. His last residence was 31 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn. After his death attributed to old age in 1911, his children inherited $15,000 in real estate and $2,500 in personal property. Section 143, lot 26346, grave 2.\n\nHELMSMULLER, FRIEDRICH (or FREIDERICH) (1820-1865). Private, 22nd Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company H. Originally from Germany, Helmsmuller was a musician of renown whose arrangement of Trab, Trab Galop was performed by the Germania Society in 1859. As per a news story in the Newport Mercury [Newport, Rhode Island] on July 13, 1861, he was a fixture in that community during the high season. The article reports that most of the members of his band were off to war while he was performing at the Ocean House Hotel. The article goes on to say that “Mr. H.” would have liked to have led the band for the 5th New York, Duryea’s Zouaves, but that was not possible; instead, he was leading a talented corps from the 7th New York.\n\nThe History of the Twenty-second Regiment of the National Guard, Part 4, indicates that the 22nd Regiment hired Helmsmuller as its band leader in September 1861. Monies were raised for the forty-four piece band by proceeds from concerts and donations by officers and companies. In addition, each company had two enlisted men who were drummers; these men were paid for their services when they paraded. Helmsmuller composed Parade March of the 22nd Regiment-Union Greys which became celebrated, although critics said was modeled after an Austrian march. In addition, he composed President Lincoln’s Grand March (1862), Drums & Trumpets (1862), Fort Federal Hill Quickstep (1862) and other rousing compositions. The band was present at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, and was taken on the Pennsylvania campaign where its music was featured at dress parades at Camp Cox. Helmsmuller’s soldier record shows that he enlisted on May 28, 1862, at New York City, as a private. On that date, he mustered into the 22nd National Guard from which he mustered out three months later at New York City on September 5. On January 22, 1863, Helmsmuller’s Band from the 22nd Regiment performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. After his death, nearly 100 musicians, in civilian attire, followed his hearse, playing a dirge. His last residence was 393 Broome Street in Brooklyn where he died from consumption. Harvey Dodworth (see) later took over the 22nd’s Band. Section 113, lot 17109.\n\nHEMMA, CHARLES EDWIN (1838-1914). Private, 71st Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company C. Hemma’s name appears as a student at the New York City Free Academy 1851-1853. Called to active duty during the Civil War for 30 days, he mustered into the 71st National Guard and served from June 17-July 22, 1863. According to the census of 1880, he was living in Queens, New York, and was employed as a bookkeeper. An article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on February 23, 1902, reports that Hemma was part of a committee of veterans who presented a silver loving cup to Colonel Henry P. Martin (see) of the 71st Regiment as a tribute to him after the 71st Armory was destroyed by fire and all of that regiment’s Civil War records were lost. In 1907, he applied for an invalid pension, application 1,361,144, but there is no evidence that it was certified. As per his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a member of Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R. and the 71st Veterans’ Association. Members of his G.A. R. Post were invited to attend his funeral in uniform or in civilian attire with badge. He last lived at 30 East 5th Street in Brooklyn but died in Greenwich, Connecticut. Section 45, lot 5271.\n\nHEMMA, THOMAS JEFFERSON (1839-1904). Private, 83rd New York Infantry, Company E; Veteran Reserve Corps, 2nd Battalion, Company 132. Hemma, who was born in New York and employed as a retail dealer at 30 West Broadway in Manhattan, first served with the 12th Regiment when it was activated for three months in 1861. Although not on his soldier record, he gave a report about the 12th Regiment’s trip on the transport ship, the Baltic, which was published in the New York Herald in 1861. Hemma was identified as one of the “returned invalids.” When he returned home to New York City from Annapolis, Maryland, he had narrowly escaped death from sunstroke. Hemma recalled the journey, focusing on the lack of comforts on the ship.\n\n…We had regaled with no more luxurious refreshments than hard sea biscuit, which were liberally supplied, but which were a hard exchange for the numerous comforts of New York. This was to be rather an unlooked for-and early beginning of the hardships of warfare. Our men were mostly stowed away in the steerage, closely huddled together. Others quartered themselves on the hurricane deck, and wrapped in their warm military blankets, endeavored, as best they could, into the sweets of slumber. The men in the steerage whiled away the time in the merriest manner. I was among this jolly crowd, and my efforts to sleep, as a natural consequence, were fruitless….\n\nHemma remembered the drill in the intense heat the next morning:\n\nThe sun was intensely hot, and the men complained bitterly of the long drill. The officers were nevertheless very considerate, and requested any of the men who felt themselves too weak to continue, to leave the ranks and rest for a while in the shade. None of the men showed a desire to avail themselves of the kind offer, but Capt. Boyle, my commander, noticed that I was not well, and told me to leave if I did not feel strong. I replied that I could go through with it, but the drill had scarcely recommenced when I was struck senseless, and when I next awoke I found myself stretched on a bed in the ladies’ drawing room, which had been set apart for an hospital….\n\nAlthough Hemma was among four members of the 12th who returned to New York, it was conjectured that the Baltic was headed for Annapolis and that the transport ship would ply the waters between the two cities.\n\nHe re-enlisted at New York City as a private on October 1, 1861, and mustered into Company E of the 83rd New York the next day. He wrote the following letter to the editor that was published in The New York Times on February 15, 1862, from the U.S. Hospital at Frederick, Maryland.\n\nTo the Editor of the New-York Times:\n\nSIR: Will you allow me through the columns of your valuable journal to acknowledge the receipt of two cases containing about 1,000 books for the use of the soldiers at this hospital. These books were presented by the members and friends of the 43rd St. Methodist Episcopal Church, through the Pastor, Rev. HENRY J. FOX.\n\nHe saw action at the following battles: Cedar Mountain, Virginia; Second Bull Run, Virginia; Antietam, Maryland; Fredericksburg, Virginia; Chancellorsville, Virginia; and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was at Gettysburg where Hemma was wounded in both legs. He was transferred into the Veteran Reserve Corps on January 24, 1864, a unit composed of men who were partially disabled but judged meritorious and fit for light duty. Hemma was in the Second Battalion of the Veteran Corps, men who suffered more serious injuries including loss of limbs or other grave wounds and were assigned as cooks, nurses, or guards in public buildings. A carte-de-visite, or calling card, of Hemma, which was offered for sale on-line and is pictured below, shows him in the light blue coat and trousers of the Veteran Corps. It is possible that his hand is on the table for balance, perhaps because of his injuries.\n\nHemma had a variety of jobs after the War including sash maker (maker of window sashes and paneled doors) in 1869; clerk, according to the New York City Directory of 1877, and embalmer as per the New York City Directory of 1889. According to the census of 1900, he was an undertaker. The Veterans Schedule of 1890 confirms his military service, listing his service in the 9th Regiment which was reorganized into the 83rd. He successfully applied for an invalid pension in 1892, certificate 683,864. An article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on May 31, 1896, was headlined, How Grant Was Buried. As per that article, Hemma, the assistant embalmer present at Mount McGregor, was given a photograph of President Grant taken on the veranda a few days before Grant’s death in 1885. Hemma accompanied the President’s body from the Mount McGregor house to Albany and then to New York City, a journey in which thousands paid last respects. The funeral costs, borne by the government, at $14,163.73, were the most expensive to that date. The article also states that Hemma had many Civil War relics, the most prized being a small Plaster of Paris mold for the gold plate which was put on Grant’s casket. Hemma also saved pieces of crepe, fringe and rosette, a scrap of purple velvet used to line the casket and a piece of the flag that was draped on the casket at City Hall. Among his Civil War memorabilia were a soldier’s watch ornament made from walnut that was carved and decorated, a silver watch made in London, a piece of skull from South Mountain, and spurs from Winchester and South Mountain. He also attested that he met Barbara Frietchie, through her niece, and owned a flag that had once been on her grave. At the time of his death caused by heart disease, he resided at 30 East 5th Street in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. His widow, Mary Hemma, applied for and received a pension in 1904, certificate 577,256. Section 86, lot 31217, grave 144.\n\nHEMMINGWAY (or HEMINGWAY), CHARLES B. (1840-1916). Sergeant, 6th New York Cavalry, Company A. A Brooklyn native, the 1860 census lists him as a stonecutter. After enlisting as a private at Brooklyn on August 20, 1862, Hemmingway mustered into the 6th New York Cavalry that same day. As per his muster roll, he was 5′ 8″ tall with blue eyes, brown hair and a dark complexion. His muster roll also notes that he was an orderly for General Henry W. Slocum (see) as of April 29, 1863, and was promoted to corporal on June 8, 1863. A per a descendant, he fought at Gettysburgh, where he was bayoneted in one leg; he killed the rebel soldier with his sword. He was wounded at Todd’s Tavern, Virginia, on May 7, 1864, and was listed as absent on the muster roll until October 1864. Hemmingway was promoted to sergeant on January 1, 1865, and mustered out on June 5, 1865, at Cloud’s Mills, Virginia.\n\nThe 1870 census indicates that he was living in Brooklyn with his wife and children and was still working as a stonecutter. In 1879, his application for an invalid pension was approved, certificate 174,646. At the time of the 1880 census, Hemmingway lived at 203 22nd Street in Brooklyn with his wife and children and worked as a marble-cutter. The 1900 census reports that he had been married for 34 years, lived at 630 20th Street in Brooklyn and worked as a stonecutter. By 1910, the census notes that he had moved to 112 East 3rd Street in Brooklyn, lived with his wife and other family members. He last lived at 128 East 3rd Street in Brooklyn. His death was attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage. Mary Hemmingway applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1916, certificate 808,360. Section 104, lot 7386.\n\nHEMPHILL, HENRY (1844-1897).

Hemstreet, who was born in Oneida County, New York, was a stenographer and lawyer with the Illinois Central Railroad Company in 1861. At the start of the Civil War, he left his civilian position on April 19, 1861, and accepted an appointment as aide-de-camp to General R. K. Swift who occupied and fortified Cairo, Illinois. Hemstreet was a drill officer at Camp Douglas through the winter of 1861-1862. On February 1, 1862, he enlisted as a private and mustered into Company I of the 57th Illinois. He participated in actions at Fort Donelson and Shiloh, Tennessee. Upon his promotion to first lieutenant on April 2, 1862, at Pittsburgh Landing, he was commissioned into Company G of the 18th Missouri. He was promoted to captain on September 17, 1863, effective upon his transfer to Company K, served on the staff of General Joseph Mower as judge advocate and provost marshal and also served as one of General William T. Sherman’s provost marshals on his famous March to the Sea. On March 13, 1865, he was promoted by brevet to major and to lieutenant colonel. He mustered out of service on July 18, 1865.\n\nFor 34 years, Hemstreet was the official stenographer for the Brooklyn Court, traveled in Europe and spoke extensively. In 1875, he wrote, The Economical European Tourist-A Journalist Three Months Abroad for $430, a guide that included tips for hotels, travel, sight-seeing with costs and comparisons between America and Europe. In 1881, he successfully applied for a pension, certificate 695,130. In 1892, Hemstreet addressed the reunion of the survivors of the Army of the Tennessee, saluting the officers present at the gathering, who were at the crossing of the Salkehatchie, South Carolina, at Rivers Bridge 27 years prior. He concluded his speech by asking for a committee to erect a suitable monument for General Joseph Mower whose death in 1870 was hastened by exposure at Salkehatchie. Hemstreet was called upon to give a lecture on Sherman’s March to public school children at All Souls’ Church in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, after his commanding officer, General Henry W. Slocum (see) died unexpectedly in 1894.\n\nInterested in transportation, he devised a patent for a rail car-fender that included a lever that prevented the fender from striking the rail or the ground. According to an article on August 10, 2012, in The New York Times, Hemstreet was a history buff who paid a contractor $5 in 1888 to pry a mantel off the wall of the house where Edgar Allan Poe lived on West 84th Street and that was featured in his famous poem, The Raven. Recognizing the significance of the mantel twenty years later, Hemstreet offered to give the piece to an institution that valued its history and would preserve it. He responded to the offer from Columbia University’s President Nicholas Murray Butler who vowed that “It will be appropriately placed and sedulously cared for. A proper inscription would be placed over or near the mantel showing what it is and giving the name of the donor. It would undoubtedly be an object of great interest to thousands of persons, not only students but others as well.” As of May 2012, the mantel is now on view in Butler Hall’s Rare Book Collection after more than a century in a less public location. He last lived at 1332 Bergen Street in Brooklyn. Hemstreet died of phthisis. Section 185, lot 33397, grave 1.\n\nHEMSWORTH, DENTON E. (1840-1881).

He was promoted to corporal on August 31, 1864, to sergeant on April 1, 1865, and mustered out on June 3, 1865, at Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nIn civilian life, he was a prominent jeweler who was the senior partner at Henderson & Winter at 51 Maiden Lane in Manhattan, an enterprise he established in 1873. In addition to designing jewelry, Henderson invented several articles that were used in the jewelry trade. His artistic talent ran in his family; his father was a sculptor to Queen Victoria, and his brother, Joseph Henderson, was a noted marine artist in Scotland. He applied for and was granted an invalid pension in 1898, certificate 969,745. As per his obituaries in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and the Brooklyn Standard Union, which confirm his Civil War service, he was a member of the Royal Arcanum, a fraternal organization; members of the Royal Arcanum were invited to attend his funeral.

Brigadier general and United States Senator from Missouri. Born in Danville, Virginia, he moved with his parents to Missouri in 1832. Orphaned at about age ten, his parents left him a small amount of money earmarked for his education. He first taught school, then became a lawyer and was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives from 1848-1850 and 1856-1858. As per his obituary, he introduced laws that regulated railroads and banking. A state’s rights Democrat who opposed the secession of Missouri, Henderson was one of the most influential forces in keeping that state in the Union. At the outset of the Civil War, he raised a brigade of the Missouri State Militia and was appointed brigadier general commanding federal forces in northeast Missouri. He saw no action, however, because he was appointed to the United States Senate on January 7, 1862, to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of Trusten Polk, and was elected to a full term the next year. He was responsible for most of the financial legislation during the War and helped draft the terms for the purchase of Alaska. In 1864, convinced that the Thirteenth Amendment outlawing slavery could only pass if introduced by a border-state senator, he introduced it even though he believed that this would end his political career. The Thirteenth Amendment was signed by President Lincoln on February 1, 1865, but Lincoln was assassinated before it was ratified by the State of Georgia on December 6, 1865.\n\nAt one time, a story circulated that Henderson met President Lincoln on the day the President was assassinated and secured a pardon for George S. E. Vaughn, a Missouri resident who was sentenced to death for spying; however, in 2011, David Blanchette, a spokesperson for the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, noted that there is no record of that pardon, rumored to be Lincoln’s last official act. During President Andrew Johnson’s impeachment trial, Henderson and six other Republicans voted for Johnson’s acquittal. During his tenure in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense and a member of the Committee on Indian Affairs. He was not a candidate for re-election to the Senate in 1868 and left that legislative body on March 4, 1869. His prediction that his political career would end was right; he ran for governor in 1872 and for senator the next year, and was defeated in both elections. In 1875, he was appointed Special United States Attorney to prosecute a whiskey ring in St. Louis, was president of the Republican National Convention in 1884, and was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution from 1892-1911. From 1891 until his death from septicemia (blood poisoning) he lived in Washington, D.C., where he did writing. His wife, Mary Newton Foote, was from New York City. He is buried in the Foote tomb.

At least five hours in each day must be given to their instruction. This I wish to be almost entirely practiced with small articles held in the hand, and the signals to be made with the greatest rapidity. Practice most thoroughly all officers in repeating signals; that is, there being three officers, the first makes a message which is repeated signal by signal as fast as made by the second, and is read by the third officer, who is not to see the signals made by the first. It is to be answered in like manner.\n\nTwenty-four officers and forty-eight men reported to him for training, one of whom wrote, “…We remained at Darnestown [Maryland] a short time engaged in acquiring a knowledge of our new duties, memorizing the signal code and practicing with ‘wands,’ as certain pine sticks were designated…” Hepburn was promoted to captain on June 30, 1862.

The Veterans Census of 1890 confirms his military service in the Civil War. In 1891, his application for an invalid pension was approved under certificate 349,984. He last lived at 46 Prospect Avenue in Brooklyn. “Phthisis pulmonalis asthenia” is listed as the cause of his death. Martha Hewett, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1891, certificate 349,984. Section 203, lot 26093.\n\nHEWINS, MILTON K. (1836-1880). Private, 71st Regiment, New York State Militia, Company C. A Brooklynite by birth, Hewins enlisted there as a private in 1861, mustered into Company C of the 71st Regiment, and mustered out at the expiration of his three month enlistment. He last lived with his brother-in-law at 216 West 123rd Street in Manhattan. Hewins died from consumption (tuberculosis). Section 73, lot 5041.\n\nHEWITT, ABRAM STEVENS (1822-1903). Civic leader, iron manufacturer, and mayor of New York City. Born on a farm near Haverstraw, New York, he was raised in New York City. He graduated first in the class of 1842 at Columbia College, then taught mathematics there. In 1844, he visited Europe with classmate Edward Cooper, whose partner he was to become, and whose sister he would marry. He studied law and was admitted to the bar. However, poor eyesight cut short his legal career, and he joined Edward Cooper in the iron business. That business prospered, and the firm of Cooper and Hewitt became one of the largest iron manufacturers in the world. In 1862 he went to England to learn the process of producing gun barrel iron, which he then used to produce material for the Union during the Civil War. He also introduced open hearth steel manufacture to this country. Hewitt was known for his enlightened relationship with his workers; during depressions he continued to operate his works at capacity, refusing to engage in the common practice of laying workers off. He headed Cooper Union. He was elected to Congress in 1874 and served there until 1879, then again 1881-1886.\n\nIn 1886, Hewitt was elected mayor of New York City, defeating radical tax reformer Henry George and future President Theodore Roosevelt by emphasizing the common interests shared by workers and employers and campaigning against Karl Marx’s theories. He was mayor from 1887 until 1888. His most lasting contribution to New York was his rapid transit plan, which joined public financing with private ownership and management. He also served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1876, was a leader of the Committee of Seventy which brought down the Tweed Ring, gave the oration at the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, was president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, was a member of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, and was a trustee of Columbia University. However, according to David McCullough in The Great Bridge, “Few politicians of the day enjoyed a more impeccable reputation, a reputation that was undeserved according to private notes kept by the Chief Engineer, Washington Roebling.” Section 97, lot 3932.\n\nHEWLETT, ALGERNON C. (1829-1905). Private, 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company A. Hewlett, a native of New York City, enlisted as a private in 1861 and served with the 7th Regiment when it was activated for 30 days that year. In 1863, when the 7th was part of the New York State National Guard, Hewlett returned to the 7th and served for 30 days. The 1868 New York City Directory indicates that he was in the mirror business; the 1870 New York City Directory notes that he was in the frame business and the 1872 New York City Directory lists him in the glass business. The 1880 census identifies Hewlett as a picture frame manufacturer. He was a member of the Alexander Hamilton Post #182 of the G.A.R.; as per his obituary in the New York Herald, members of the post were invited to attend his funeral. His last address was 10 East 127th Street in Manhattan. Section 173, lot 19426, grave 12.\n\nHEYBOURN (or HEYBOURNE, HAYBOURN), JOHN (1822-1896).

The 12th participated in Virginia at the Battles of Arlington Heights, Martinsburg and Bunker Hill. He was captured at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, on September 15, 1862, part of the largest surrender of troops during the Civil War, by Confederate forces under the command of Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson. Heybourn was soon released and mustered out at New York City on October 8, 1862. The 1870 and 1880 censuses identify him as a shoe machinist; an article about his daughter’s wedding in 1882 notes that he was a prominent manufacturer in the shoe business in New York City. Heybourn became a member of the G.A.R. on May 25, 1888. In 1891, he applied for and received an invalid pension, certificate 728,227. He last lived in Mount Vernon, New York. His death was attributed to Bright’s disease. His wife applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 431,516. Section 16, lot 6285.\n\nHEYZER, CHARLES H. (1841-1904). Private, 22nd Regiment, New York State National Guard, Company G. He served for three months in 1863. Further details of his service are unknown. His last residence was at 407 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. His death was caused by apoplexy. Section 2, lot 5499, grave 817.\n\nHIBBEN, HENRY BASCOM (1826-1890). Chaplain, 11th Indiana Infantry; United States Navy. Born In Uniontown, Pennsylvania, he was a student at Jefferson College (now Lafayette College) when he decided to change his career path from lawyer to preacher. He transferred to Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky, from which he graduated in 1848. His descendant, George Hibben, who wrote about his family’s genealogy in A Social History of the Pioneer Hibben Family 1730 to the Early 1900s, noted that he became a teacher at a female seminary in Indiana in about 1850, then took on a professorship in ancient languages and English literature at what is now DePauw University, subsequently moving to Indiana State University at Bloomington.\n\nA resident of Bloomington when the Civil War broke out, Hibben was commissioned into the 11th Indiana Infantry’s Field and Staff as a chaplain on August 31, 1861. In George Hibben’s article, Minister, Educator, and Historian in the Indiana Historical Society’s publication Connections–The Hoosier Genealogist (Spring/Summer 2008), Bascom Hibben’s letter to his sister dated August 31, 1861, described leaving his family, “I have accepted an appt. as Chaplain to Col. Wallace’s 11th Zouave Regiment and will start for Washington City to join McClellan’s army on next Wednesday or Thursday. Harriet will remain at Bloomington-I will write you as soon as we get to our place of destination. I have no ink and have to write this with pencil-Good bye my dear Sister-Pray for me and mine-” He was present at the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee, the siege of Corinth, Mississippi, and the Red River expedition. After the engagement at Fort Donelson, Colonel George F. McGinnis commended Hibben for “his valuable assistance to the surgeon Thompson which was cheerfully rendered until all of our wounded were cared for and made as comfortable as the circumstances would admit….” Hibben wrote letters to the Indianapolis Herald describing the battles in descriptive language. Hibben’s descendant included these lines of poetry from his battle report of Forts Henry and Donelson:\n\n“For the night clouds had lower’d,\n\nAnd the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky,\n\nAnd thousands had sunk to the ground overpowered,\n\nThe weary to sleep, and the wounded to die.”\n\nHibben was present at the Battle of Shiloh, April 6-7, 1862. Years later, he wrote to Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard and questioned General Lew Wallace’s strategy at the outbreak of that battle. General Wallace, at the order of General Rawlins of Ulysses S. Grant’s staff, returned to Crump’s Landing for fear that the troops would come upon the enemy’s rear and might have been surrounded and captured. The Indianapolis Journal published Beauregard’s letter to Hibben dated May 18, 1881:\n\nYour favor of the 13th inst. has been received, etc. General Lew Wallace’s appearance on our left and rear at Shiloh, after we had got near the river, would have compelled me to retire from the field, for we had then no reserves in a proper condition to meet successfully a flank attack by some 8,000 to 10,000 fresh troops. The fear of such a movement on his part was one of the principal reasons which cause me to issue the order shortly before sundown for the reformation of the different commands in rear of the advanced position we were then occupying, so as to be ready to attack or be attacked early the next morning.\n\nHibben, in hindsight, told the newspaper that he thought it never entered the minds of any of the Union generals to attack the enemy in the rear. Further, Hibben went on to question whether General Buell was responsible for preventing the annihilation of Union troops when he came to Grant’s aid in the counteroffensive on the second day of the battle. Hibben said:\n\nI would not detract anything from the laurels of Gen. Buell, much less would I try to disparage his competency and courage, but I have to say, finally, that the wonder to us was not that Gen. Buell took an active, honorable part in the second day’s fight at Shiloh, but rather that we had to fight the first day’s battle without his presence or aid.\n\nAfter resigning his commission on May 12, 1864, he subsequently joined the United States Navy Yard as a chaplain on July 2, 1864. He served as a chaplain, with the rank of lieutenant commander, in numerous Navy hospitals, and, among other posts was an instructor at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, the school-ship on board the USS Constitution, and was subsequently at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. From there, he continued his service aboard the USRS Vermont and the USRS Colorado. While on the Vermont on February 1, 1873, he developed pleurisy while preaching on an open deck in a cold wind and was admitted to the ship’s hospital and discharged on March 4 to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He attained the rank of commander on January 1, 1874, and captain on January 1, 1882. Hibben spent four years at the naval asylum at Philadelphia from 1880-1884 before returning to the Vermont and the Colorado. Assigned to the Washington Navy Yard during the last three years of his life, he wrote a comprehensive history of that facility that was ultimately forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy and printed. Hibben said of his history:\n\nFirst. It has been prepared entirely from the official manuscripts, books and documents of the Navy department, and is therefore reliable history.\n\nSecond. It contains interesting historical matter connected with the War of 1812, and also with our late civil war, never before published, as well as important corrections of verdicts pronounced by standard histories, on a partial knowledge of the facts in the case, condemning a former Secretary of the Navy and Captain Tingey, a distinguished naval officer.\n\nI have endeavored to avoid dry detail so far as possible, and I believe the history will prove to be of general interest as well as a useful addition to our naval literature….\n\nHis papers, which are archived at DePauw University in Indiana, include his recollections of the Navy during the Civil War. Hibben recalled:\n\n…A great and prosperous nation’s proudest inheritance is the record of the glorious and patriotic deeds of her sons. The nation may indeed die; but the noble, patriotic action of her sons will live on….But all history teaches, that if we let this spirit of true patriotic appreciation and acknowledgment of patriotic deeds die out, or be crushed out, of the hearts of the people, the nation, however rich and powerful, will degenerate and perish….God of our fathers, give to us all-East, West, North, South-the spirit of true, lofty and unfading patriotism, and then may we fearlessly and confidently hope that the eagle upon our banner, that has hitherto guided us to victory against foreign and domestic foes, shall never behold one dark spot in the starry firma"
