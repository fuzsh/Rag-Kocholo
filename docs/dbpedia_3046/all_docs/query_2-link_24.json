        "text": "Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt leads his 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, better known as the \"Rough Riders\" up Kettle Hill earning himself both a place in the White House and the Medal of Honor.\n\nHeritage Series\n\n1898Santiago, Cuba - American forces attack first up Kettle Hill and then across a saddle to outflank San Juan Hill. Among the units making this attack was the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, (better known as the \"Rough Riders\") two squadrons of which were drawn from the Arizona and New Mexico volunteer militia units. It was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, himself a former New York Guardsman. Near the Rough Riders attacking straight up San Juan Hill was the 71st New York Volunteer Infantry. With this victory the Spanish fleet was compelled to sail from Santiago Harbor or face bombardment by the American Army now overlooking the city. When it did sail it was quickly destroyed by the American Navy waiting outside the harbor. As a result of these assaults two men important in Guard history received the Medal of Honor. They were: Captain (later General) Albert Mills, a Regular officer, who became the third Chief of the Division of Militia Affairs (now National Guard Bureau) in 1912; and Colonel Roosevelt who as President oversaw the enactment of the 1903 Militia (Dick) Act. Besides being the only president to receive the Medal of Honor, Roosevelt, who's Medal of Honor was not approved and awarded until 2000, is also one of only three to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize..\n\nUniforms of the Virginia Provincial Regiment from 1754-1762. At the time of the action at Big Meadows, the men were still dressed in all red just like British Regulars. In fact, when General Edward Braddock came from Britain in 1755 to command a combined British Regular and colonial force he insisted that the Virginia Regiment adopt non-red coats to minimize possible confusion over which troops were regulars. This may in part have contributed to the adoption of blue uniforms by the American Army during the Revolution.\n\nCourtesy of the Company of Military Collectors and Historians.\n\n1754Great Meadows, Pennsylvania - Lieutenant Colonel George Washington is compelled to surrender \"Fort Necessity\" to a French task force from Fort Duquesne (present day Pittsburgh). Washington had been dispatched by Virginia's governor with a mixed force of soldiers of the Virginia Provincial Regiment and Virginia militiamen to remove the French from Duquesne which was located in an area claimed by colonial government. When his advanced was blocked by the French Washington had his troops build a quickly constructed log fort in hopes of holding the French at bay. However, he was soon surrounded and forced to surrender. The French commander granted him the \"honors of war\" by allowing him to march out with colors flying, retaining one piece of artillery and with his men under arms. This rebuff of the claim by Virginia, and by extension Britain, to this area led directly to the outbreak of war between France and Britain in 1756. Known in Europe as the Seven Year's War in American it's more popularly called the \"French and Indian War.\" The men serving in the Virginia Provincial Regiment were full-time paid soldiers, mostly enlisted from the county militias. They were paid and equipped by the colony and used to garrison small outposts and patrol its western frontier. It was one of the first \"professional\" military organizations in British North America.\n\nNurses of New Jersey's 150th Aeromedical Flight help transfer patients from a U.S. Navy medical evacuation aircraft to a U.S. Air Force plane for the journey home from Hawaii.National Guard Education Foundation\n\n1966Honolulu, Hawaii - Female nurses of the 150th Aeromedical Flight, New Jersey Air National Guard, receive men injured or ill from their duty in Vietnam to treat them on their return flights to stateside hospitals for convalesce. Nurses from several Air Guard units volunteered to staff these missions in a temporary duty status, usually lasting about a month for each individual. They were not allowed to enter the combat zone of Vietnam so they would link up with evacuation flights in Japan or Hawaii (staffed by Regular Air Force or Navy nurses) and rendered medical support in bringing the men back to the states, thus ‘freeing up' the Regular nurses to return to the theater. At this point in the war no Guard units, Air or Army had yet been mobilized but the Air Guard in particular was voluntarily playing an increasing role in supporting the war effort. Besides these nurse evacuation flights other Air Guard units, mostly those equipped with long-range C-97 or C-121 transport aircraft, were flying large amounts of cargo into Vietnam. As with the Air Guard women, these men were all volunteers and could not stay in Vietnam. They landed, off-loaded their cargo and took off again (hopefully before anybody got hurt), flying back to the Philippines to rest before returning home. In January 1968 and again in May 1968 a total of thirteen Air Guard units were mobilized to support the war in Vietnam and the potential of renewed conflict in Korea. Among these units was a small number of women in Air Guard tactical dispensaries or hospitals. While four of the Air Guard fighter squadrons served in Vietnam and two more were based in Korea, as far as can be documented none of their supporting units deployed with any mobilized female nurses.\n\n1959Grand Junction, CO -The Air National Guard’s only official precision flying team known as the Minute Men, flew their last performance. Starting with the Lockheed F-80C's Shooting Stars in 1953, the team performed to crowds estimated to have totaled 3 million people in 47 states and five foreign countries. The team consisted of pilots and ground crewmen assigned to the 120th Fighter Squadron, Colorado Air Guard.\n\nOriginally, the Minute Men was started by pilots of the 120th Fighter Squadron flying for local air shows in Denver. When officials at the National Guard Bureau learned of the unit and saw its precision flying (much like that of the Air Force's Thunderbirds and the Navy's Blue Angels) they endorsed it as a public relations activity, funneling money and equipment to the unit. It traveled across the nation putting on shows and sparking interest in the Air National Guard.\n\nIn 1958 the team received F-86F Sabre, which allowed them to perform such intricate maneuvers as the \"corkscrew roll\". The team flew hundreds of shows with only one mishap. On 8 June 1958, while performing a \"bomb burst\" maneuver at Dayton, Ohio, Captain John Ferrier's plane developed an aileron problem. Rather than ejecting to save himself, he rode the plane into a small unoccupied area in the middle of a residential neighborhood. While he was killed no one on the ground was injured. He was awarded a posthumous Distinguished Flying Cross. The high point for the team came in 1959 when it visited five Central American countries as ‘good will ambassadors' performing shows for huge crowds.\n\nWhen the 120th was mobilized in 1968 and deployed to Vietnam, many of its pilots were former members of the Minute Men and proved their skill was just as keen in dropping bombs as it was in performing intricate aerial tricks.\n\nThe variety of aircraft, all privately owned, that comprised the 1st Aero Squadron, New York National Guard, on the day it was mobilized for the Mexican border crisis can be seen in this wide-angled view.National Guard Education Foundation\n\n1916Mineola, New York - Captain Raynal Bolling commanded the 1st Aero Squadron, New York National Guard, when it was mobilized during the Mexican Border Crisis. Using a variety of privately owned aircraft the 1st was the first flying unit organized in the Guard. Though the unit was not deployed to the border before being released from active duty in November 1916, a large number of its members, including Bolling, joined the Signal Corps Reserve (then controlling all Army aviation) prior to the U.S. entry into World War I. During the war Bolling, now a colonel, was a leading planner of American air strategy. For instance, he determined and got approved the use of British DeHaviland's for observation and daylight bombing missions and British Bristol's and French Spads as America's lead fighters. While riding in a staff car near the front at Amiens, France on March 26, 1918, he was surprised by advancing German troops. Bolling and his driver, coming under enemy fire, jumped into a ditch, where Bolling returned fire with his pistol (the only weapon either man had). He killed a German officer and almost immediately was killed himself by another officer. His had to be one of the few pistol fights to have occurred in World War I! Bolling was posthumously awarded the French Legion of Honor and the American Distinguished Service Medal for his bold leadership and far-reaching vision of the role air power would come to play on the battlefield.\n\nSergeant William Carney hold the remnant of the national flag he saved at Battery Wagner. Note too he is holding a cane, needed after he was twice shot in the legs during the attack. Though recommended for the Medal of Honor right after the attack and apparently approved during the war, Carney did not actually receive his Medal until 1903. This image was published in the late 19th century, the location of the original photograph it was made from is unknown.Army Heritage and Education Center\n\n1863\"Battery Wagner\" near Charleston Harbor, SC -The 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, along with several other regiments, fall short in their heroic assault to capture this garrison from Confederate forces. This unit was raised as part of the Massachusetts Militia in 1863. The 54th was one of the first all-black units organized for federal duty since the 1st Rhode Island Regiment during the American Revolution, albeit with white officers,.\n\nParts of the story were highlighted by the movie \"Glory\" (1989) but some elements were changed or left out. For instance, when the unit was organized, almost all of its men were 'free born' blacks as opposed to former slaves. The regimental sergeant major, played as a fictitious character by actor Morgan Freeman, was actually the eldest son of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Two of Douglass' sons also served in the regiment.\n\nSergeant William Carney of Company B was the first African-American to earn the Medal of Honor in battle. He picked up the National flag after the color bearer was killed. He carried it to the top of the parapet, where it was used to inspire the Soldiers despite three crippling wounds. Due to high losses, the regiment was forced to retreat. Carney was one of 18 African-American Medal of Honor recipients during the Civil War. Today the 54th Massachusetts has been reconstituted under the force structure as a ceremonial unit.\n\n(Left) First Lieutenant Francis Greenlief, in France, 1944 National Guard Education Foundation (Right) Captain Thomas Howie circa 1943 (photo taken in England prior to promotion in spring 1944). National Guard Bureau Historical Collection\n\n1944St. Lo, Normandy, France - Two Guard divisions, the 29th (DC, MD, VA) and the 35th (KS, MO, NE) both claim credit for the final capture of this vital crossroads city from the Nazis. According to the D-Day plan, St. Lo was supposed to be secured ten days after D-Day. But due to stubborn German resistance using each Norman hedgerow as a defensive fighting position, it took 42 days to take the city. During the 35th Division's approach, Nebraska Guardsman First Lieutenant Francis Greenlief, of Company L, 134th Infantry (NE), was awarded the Silver Star for capturing an enemy machine gun nest single-handedly. In 1971 Major General Greenlief was appointed by President Richard Nixon as the Chief, National Guard Bureau. Another Guard soldier was to gain fame on the approach to St. Lo, but in a different way. Virginian Major Thomas Howie, the popular commander of the 2nd Battalion, 116th Infantry (VA), told his officers in a meeting on the edge of the city \"I'll see you in St. Lo!\" and then was killed by a mortar fragment. When the division commander heard the story he instructed that Howie's body be transported with the lead elements when they moved into the city. His body was placed on a stretcher and draped with an American flag and placed on the ruins of the Ste. Croix Church in the center of the city. A passing New York Times reporter heard the story and wrote a moving tribute entitled \"The Major of St. Lo\" but could not identify Howie by name due to security. The story was picked up by newspapers across the nation and the \"Major\" came to represent all the men killed in the Normandy campaign to liberate France. To honor these men today, Nebraska has the \"Major General Francis Greenlief Training Site\" in Hastings and the \"Major Thomas Howie Memorial Armory\" is in his hometown of Staunton, VA.\n\nAirmen from the 185th Tactical Fighter Group (TFG), Iowa Air National Guard, tend to a victim of the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City, Ia., on July 19, 1989. The Iowa National Guard provided resources to fight fires and tend to injured passengers immediately after the crash, and neighboring state National Guards from Nebraska, Minnesota and South Dakota also provided other resources to aid rescue efforts and to aid the efforts of the tragedy’s first responders. The Sioux City crash is noteworthy among National Guard domestic contingencies for the overwhelming response provided and the high level of cooperation provided at the time of the catastrophe. Photograph by TSgt Pat Kenaley, Iowa Air National Guard\n\n1989Saturday, 19 July marks the 25th anniversary of United Airlines Flight 232 back in 1989. This was the DC-10 jetliner that crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, after a midair explosion caused an engine to fail along with the total loss hydraulic pressure that would allow the craft to maneuver. The video of the event was a big news story after it happened, and the event even inspired a Charlton Heston TV movie - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104020/\n\nWith the help of a training pilot on board as a passenger, the chief pilot attempted an accelerated landing that ultimately failed because of the speed with which it approached the abandoned runway; after the right tail hit the runway, the plane flipped and a large explosion occurred. Of the 296 persons aboard, there were 112 deaths. A huge tragedy to be sure, but it was action of the pilots overhead and the Iowa Air National Guard at the Sioux Gateway Airport, along with other civilian responders, who played a huge role in prevented dozens of other deaths; in all, 184 survived the fiery impact.\n\nThe National Guard had a large presence that day, and the photograph of Lt. Col. Dennis Nielsen, IA ANG, in the Sioux City newspaper became an iconic image of the incident. It is also an important aviation history milestone because of the two pilots collaborating in their fortuitous yet desperate meeting that undoubtedly saved those scores of lives through their decisive actions.\n\nSpecialist Fourth Class Edward Russo was a member of the 107th Signal Company while serving in Vietnam. He is standing in front of the mobile telephone exchange operated by the unit when the Headquarters of the 199th Infantry Brigade moved locations.Courtesy Mr. Edward Russo.\n\n1969Long Binh, Vietnam - Members of Rhode Island's 107th Signal Company continue to perform 'routine' but necessary upgrades on equipment to assure a smooth flow of communications in support of Headquarters, II Field Force. The unit, in country since October 1968, actually had elements serving in three different locations in Vietnam. The main body was stationed at Long Binh while a platoon was based at Can Tho, 80 miles southwest of Saigon to support the IV Corps (Mekong Delta) area and a second platoon was situated at Tay Ninh (50 miles northwest of Saigon) to support the 199th Infantry Brigade. Among their tasks was the maintenance of teletype relays between different headquarters in country and the operation of a 200-line dial central office on wheels to provide commercial-quality phone service. This latter equipment allowed the unit to deploy with a mobile force and within an hour have its common links up on line. While the unit had no men killed in action, Sergeant Ernest Perry of Warwick, RI, died of a swimming accident. The 107th returned home in October 1969 and was reorganized in the Rhode Island Guard. However, it was disbanded in the 1990s and its lineage is now lost. It is the only National Guard unit (Army or Air) carrying Vietnam campaign credit not still in the force today.\n\nGeneral Walter Hanna (back to camera) explains purpose and duties of this mission to his men assembled in Phenix City. These Guardsmen would be the only law enforcement agency in the area until outside officials can be brought in to ‘clean up' the town.National Guard Education Foundation\n\n1954Phenix City, Alabama - Governor Gordon Persons declares martial law in Russell County after a key witness in an upcoming grand jury inquiry is murdered to prevent his testimony about local corruption and vote fraud. About 150 Alabama Guardsmen, under command of the Major General Walter Hanna, commander of the 31st Infantry Division, started moving into the city and surrounding areas to 'clean up' what had been referred to as the \"most wicked city in the United States.\" Phenix City had been known for years as a den of gambling, bootleg liquor and prostitutes all aided by corrupt cops and others in leadership positions. Located just across the state line from Fort Benning, GA, the city thrived on the 'soldier trade'. After several failed attempts to clean up the situation, the killing was the last straw. Hanna and his men replaced the sheriff and deputies, while all the local judges were replaced by ones sent by the governor from outside areas. All the gambling equipment (slot machines, roulette tables, etc.) was destroyed, the girls run out of the county and the corrupt officials jailed, fined or otherwise prevented from acting. The mission ended in January 1955, nearly six months after it started. A determined general backed by at least 300 Guardsmen on duty at some point, finally succeeded in cleaning up the 'wicked city' once and for all.\n\nDuring the one year of training all Guard units were called up for, most took part in at least one major, multi-divisional exercise such as these members of the 102nd Cavalry from New Jersey dashing into position during the First Army Maneuvers in North and South Carolina in the autumn of 1941. While German troops at the same time were advancing through Russia in motorized columns much of the American army was still tied to the horse. However, by war's end in 1945, the U.S. Army would be the most mechanized force in the world.National Archives and Records Administration\n\n1940Nationwide - Almost as soon as France was forced to surrender to Nazi Germany on June 22, 1940, some planners in the Army began drawing up an outline of mobilizing the entire 242,400 men of the National Guard in case America got pulled into the war. As the first air battles between the Britain's Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe started in what soon became known as the \"Battle of Britain\" these plans were presented to President Franklin Roosevelt and Congressional leaders along with a plan to begin the first peacetime conscription (better known as the \"draft\") to put America on a war footing. Within the month the call for a limited, one year mobilization of the Guard was approved. The first of 18 increments (spaced out so as to not overwhelm the Army's logistical and camp facilities) would enter active duty on September 16, 1940; the last group on March 5, 1941. The recommendation on conscription took longer but it was finally enacted in September 1940 and the first men 'drafted' entered active duty in early 1941. Many of these new conscripts were assigned to fill out Guard units, linking up men who would make lifelong friendships forged in battle in operational theaters around the world.\n\nThe 193rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron was first equipped with EC-121 \"Super Constellations\" two of which they took to Thailand for this mission. In the mid-1970s they were issued modified and enhanced EC-130 \"Hercules\" which they still use today.Heritage Series\n\n1970Korat Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand - Volunteers of Pennsylvania's 193rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Group settle into their quarters having just arrived to begin their secret mission of propaganda broadcasts over enemy held territory. The 193rd was a fairly new organization, having been reorganized from Pennsylvania's 168th Air Transport Group in 1967. During the 1965 operation of the U.S. military in quelling the unrest in the Dominican Republic, the Defense Department decided it need some way to communicate by AM radio with the populace our intentions and instructions to help reduce needless deaths. With the Vietnam War costing billions of dollars already, the Air Force said it could not organize such a specialized unit on a full-time basis. Major General Winston Wilson, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, offered to have an Air Guard unit reorganized to perform this mission. As the 168th was reorganized into the 193rd its mission was redefined more to broadcast the American position on events to enemy soldiers than to communicate with local civilians. Soon after the U.S. incursion into Cambodia from Vietnam in May 1970, it was decided to deploy the 193rd to Thailand to fly over Cambodia broadcasting to Communists forces attempting to overthrow the pro-American government. By 1970 it was apparent that the U.S was withdrawing its forces from Vietnam. The last thing the Pentagon wanted was newspaper stories about a Guard unit again being mobilized for duty in Southeast Asia. The last of the Guardsmen mobilized in 1968 had only been released from active duty in November 1969. And with memories of the Guard's involvement in the Kent State shootings that had just occurred in May 1970, the public's impression of the Guard was not favorable. So it was decided to deploy the unit staffed entirely with volunteers on 'short tours' of 60-90 days before they returned home, replaced by new volunteers for another 60-90 days. According to Technical Sergeant James Bankes, who was in the first group to go, this rotation schedule applied to all, pilots as well as ground support personnel. With little notice by the press the unit took only two of their specially-modified EC-121 Super Constellation aircraft. Each day one plane would fly, usually for about 7 hours, while the other was serviced and prepared for the next day's mission. Bankes said that the planes broadcast AM radio programs in a foreign language prepared by somebody who delivered them to the unit each morning in time for that day's flight. The crew had no idea what they said. One pilot joked it was probably \"Shoot down the first three-tailed aircraft you see!\" After 144 days of continuous missions (without missing one day due to malfunction or weather) the unit and its planes returned home with no fanfare. The 193rd suffered no losses. This first test for the unit proved successful and it has been among the first unit deployed in every military action undertaken by the U.S. since Vietnam. In fact, the 193rd (now redesignated as Special Operations Wing) is the only such unit in the entire Air Force and was flying over Afghanistan broadcasting on the first day of the air war against the Taliban in 2001 and over Iraq in the opening hours of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003."
