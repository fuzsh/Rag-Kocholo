        "text": "Folks, I know you’ve been waiting for this, as have we. Like most things with Slaughter Pen Farm, good things come to those who wait! After many long years, on Friday, July 26, the house was demolished!\n\nDemolition at Slaughter Pen Farm Battlefield, Fredericksburg, Va. (Melissa A. Winn)\n\nRemoval of the house is the final phase of a complex restoration process that has cleared numerous non-historic structures from the landscape over the past decade and a half. Its removal clears the way for a new interpretive plaza and restoration of the landscape to its 1862 appearance. We couldn’t be more excited about this, and we thank YOU for your hard work, patience and generous giving that has made this moment possible.\n\nThe acquisition of the Slaughter Pen Farm on the Fredericksburg battlefield in 2006 was a landmark purchase for the American Battlefield Trust. Not only was the $12 million purchase price the highest, by far, in Trust history, but the acquisition was the most complex we had ever attempted. With governmental support (in large part by the Commonwealth of Virginia), donations from Trust members and friends, and in partnership with Central Virginia Battlefields Trust, Slaughter Pen Farm was saved in perpetuity. It took nearly 16 years to pay off. We celebrated that day in May 2022, and we celebrate today the removal of the last modern structure impeding the landscape’s wartime interpretation.\n\nThe 208 acres that have been saved here are among the most historic on the Fredericksburg battlefield, what Fredericksburg Campaign expert Frank O’Reilly calls “the very heart and soul” of the field, “the point where the battle was won and lost.”\n\n‘The True Battle for Fredericksburg’\n\nAs Union troops assaulted Marye’s Heights on December 13, 1862, about five miles to the north on that bloody day, thousands of blue-clad soldiers crossed the flat, open plain of the farm, advancing under fire toward Confederate lines along Prospect Hill bordering the farm on the southwest.\n\nThis lesser-known assault was actually the main objective of the Union battle strategy – the “true battle for Fredericksburg,” as O’Reilly puts it. Before the fighting ended, 9,000 Union and Confederate soldiers had fallen. Survivors called the battlefield “the Slaughter Pen.”\n\nFive soldiers were later bestowed the Medal of Honor for their actions on this field on that bloody day: George Maynard of the 13th Massachusetts, Charles Collis of the 114th Pennsylvania, Philip Petty of the 136th Pennsylvania and Martin Schubert and Joseph Keene of the 26th New York Infantry.\n\nSince taking ownership of the property in 2006, the Trust has focused on restoring the land to its wartime appearance. We’ve gradually removed several derelict farm outbuildings and, in 2009, installed an almost two-mile educational walking trail — popular with locals, students of history and military units participating in staff rides.\n\nThe removal of this last modern structure from the field clears the way for a planned interpretive plaza that will share with future generations the stories of these hallowed grounds. There is no substitute for the power of place, and we are grateful to declare victory on preserving and restoring this one with your unwavering support. Thank you!\n\n‘Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan\n\nPresident\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nWe’ve been offered a “too-good-to-pass-up” deal to save precious battlefield land. We need to seize it while we can!\n\nLet me explain. Today, we have the opportunity to save 132 acres on three battlefields that were the scenes of three of the biggest charges of the Civil War. The total cost to purchase and preserve these lands? $1.67 million.\n\nHere's what's at stake...\n\n35 Acres at Chaffin's Farm, New Market Heights\n\nThe Union victory at the Battle of Chaffin’s Farm played a role in Lincoln’s reelection in 1864. Learn more »\n\nNine Acres at Petersburg (The Breakthrough)\n\nThe Breakthrough may have been the most consequential attack of the Civil War, leading directly to the fall of Richmond. Learn more »\n\n88 Acres at Fort Blakeley\n\nThe Battle for Fort Blakeley was the last combined-force battle of the Civil War, leading to the fall of the fourth-largest city in the Southern Confederacy. Learn more »\n\nMAKE A GIFT TO PROTECT THESE BATTLEFIELDS\n\nWe need your help to raise $149,875 to save all 132 hallowed acres.\n\nThanks to grants and partners and a gift from one generous landowner, every dollar we raise will be multiplied by 11! Think of it this way... your gift of $50 would be worth $550, and your gift of $100 would be worth an incredible $1,100.\n\nToday, we must also consider the consequences of inaction.\n\nOver the last 160 years, literally thousands of battlefield acres have been lost, developed, and destroyed. Today, homes and warehouses sit on places where soldiers fought and died, highways pierce fields and forests where history was made, and pressures continue to mount to bulldoze and build on the battlefield acres we have left.\n\nThankfully, in recent years, a new kind of hero has emerged. You are a preservation hero. And I am deeply grateful for your commitment to history preservation.\n\n'Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan\n\nPresident\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nP.S. One day soon, I hope to write to you to share that these lands have been protected in perpetuity. But today, we are running out of time. I need your help raising the last $149,875 we need to preserve 132 battlefield acres, and I’m offering you the opportunity to have your support multiplied 11 times over. Please do what you can to help today.\n\nWe have a new opportunity to buy five tracts for a total of a whopping 278 acres of battlefield land in three states. These crucial tracts include the site of one of the largest battles ever fought on North Carolina soil.\n\nThanks to matched funds from generous partners, we have raised over $2,900,000 to preserve this crucial land. Now, we are calling on our reinforcements to raise the last $62,500 to secure these properties.\n\nToday, you can also partner with us to support this critical preservation effort. Your donation will directly contribute to saving five historical battlefield sites.\n\nPlus, all donations made to this effort will be matched $50 to $1. Your generous gift will provide timely reinforcements we need, and go 50 times as far to save the following battlefield tracts:\n\n71 Acres at Bentonville, North Carolina\n\nWe have the opportunity to help our partners preserve forever two tracts at Bentonville totaling 71 acres and helping us better tell the story of a concluding chapter of the war.\n\n56 Acres at Goldsborough Bridge, North Carolina\n\nThe sale of this 56-acre tract of land is currently being advertised as ''perfect for light industrial'' and ''zoned for trucks''. If we don't act now, this sacred ground could be lost forever.\n\n150 Acres at Shepherdstown, West Virginia\n\nWe must fight to preserve this 150-acre tract of historical land that is threatened by residential development.\n\n1 Acre at Shy's Hill in Nashville, Tennessee\n\nShy's Hill represents some of the last movements in the Battle of Nashville in December 1864, when Federal troops finally broke the Confederate line on the left flank, and effectively ended the war in Tennessee.\n\nIf we don't act fast, we might lose this land to the construction of a million-dollar McMansion!\n\nLearn about all of the rich history of these 278 threatened acres.\n\nWe need you!\n\nTime is of the essence, and we need your support to save these five battlefields. Please donate today and help us safeguard these crucial pieces of our nation's history. Remember, every dollar you donate will be matched $50 to $1, amplifying the value of your support.\n\nBattlefield by battlefield, acre by acre, we are putting the puzzle pieces together so that the full story of our history can be understood forever.\n\n'Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan, President\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nP.S. With our partners and YOU by our side, we are a force to be reckoned with. Give today and have your gift matched $50-to-$1.\n\nTwice-Hallowed Ground:\n\nA piece of land that is associated with two separate historical events or conflicts of great importance, like this tract at Fredericksburg.\n\nI'm sure you're aware that the battle to preserve hallowed land is getting increasingly more competitive and expensive. This is certainly the case for the 7.5 acres we are now currently fighting to preserve at Fredericksburg.\n\nTwo significant Civil War battles took place on this sacred land – one a devastating loss for the Union and the second a great victory!\n\nThe First Battle\n\nIn December of 1862, was one of the largest and deadliest battles of the Civil War. It featured the first opposed river crossing in American military history, as well as some of the deadliest urban combat of the Civil War.\n\nIt was also a decisive Confederate victory, that served as a catalyst for a Federal command change within Lincoln’s principal army, while setting the stage for the spring 1863 campaign in northern Virginia.\n\nThe Second Battle\n\nIn April of 1863, Union General Joseph Hooker split his army into three pieces, leaving one in the vicinity of Fredericksburg to hold the Confederates in place, while his other wings cut into the rear of the Confederates.\n\nUndaunted, Robert E. Lee, too, split his forces to meet these threats, leaving some 56 cannon and 11,000 soldiers at Fredericksburg to hold the Federals in place, while Lee and Stonewall Jackson led the remainder of the army west to thwart Hooker. On May 3, 1863, Union forces overwhelmed Lee's rear guard at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nOur Battle Today\n\nThe tract is entirely inside the authorized boundary of the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. Yet it is now unprotected and features several modern structures.\n\nThe current zoning for this property allows for development into 34 residential townhouse lots, and developers have been chewing at the bit to acquire it.\n\nWe were able to negotiate a sale with the landowner, but it won't come cheap. It's going to cost us $1.525 million over three years. And the first $500,000 is due soon!\n\nJoin us today in this special effort to preserve twice-hallowed ground. Let's save history together!\n\n'Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan, President\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nGettysburg Battlefield: General Pickett’s Buffet\n\nThe former site of General Pickett’s Buffet is a little more than a half-acre that overlooks the field of Pickett’s Charge, across which, on July 3, 1863, some 12,000 Confederate soldiers advanced, without cover, toward Cemetery Ridge. During World War I, the area that became as restaurant parking was the headquarters of Camp Colt, where American troops trained under a young Dwight David Eisenhower in the emerging art of tank warfare before deploying to Europe; the future president so loved the battlefield and town that he later made Gettysburg his home. The same site eventually became a prisoner of war camp for captured German soldiers during World War II.\n\nWith the help of the Gettysburg Foundation, the American Battlefield Protection Program and our generous members and donors, the Trust has completed its purchase of the site. The Trust acquired the land when the restaurant changed hands and moved to a new location south of town. Tour groups now enjoy lunch in the spacious new Barn Restaurant.\n\nGettysburg Battlefield: Military Museum\n\nOn the slopes of East Cemetery Hill, abutting the Baltimore Pike and sitting just below the crest of the Union artillery position on Stevens Knoll, what is now known as the “Battlefield Military Museum” tract figured prominently in the Battle of Gettysburg. The eminence above it to the east, called McKnight’s Hill, or Stevens Knoll, was among the first tracts preserved at Gettysburg, less than one year after the battle. During the battle, James and Margaret Ann McKnight owned this land, which includes a historic house still extant on the property and a stone wall behind which soldiers fought, bled and died. Tens of thousands of Union troops marched right in front of, and some paused on, passed over, fought on and were buried on McKnight’s property on the first and second days of battle.\n\nWith the help of many partners, including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the American Battlefield Protection Program, and the HTR Foundation, the Trust has successfully purchased and saved this tract forever. Per the terms of our acquisition, restoration will occur in phases, some of which may not begin for several years.\n\nChickasaw Bayou Battlefield, Miss.\n\nThe acquisition of more than a dozen tracts in Mississippi has helped the Trust save a little more than 25 acres at Chickasaw Bayou as we work toward securing a critical mass of the battlefield for interpretive purposes. The Battle of Chickasaw Bayou was the first major engagement of the Vicksburg Campaign. Union forces initiated the Vicksburg Campaign in December 1862 with a two-pronged approach to capture the city via Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Chickasaw Bayou expedition and Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant’s approach to Vicksburg via the Mississippi Central Railroad. Sherman failed to defeat Confederate forces at Chickasaw Bayou, which contributed to Grant’s inability to capture the city of Vicksburg by a direct approach as initially planned.\n\nPreservation of these tracts was assisted by the American Battlefield Protection Program and the Mississippi Historic Site Preservation Grants program.\n\nChickamauga Battlefield, Ga.\n\nAfter being forced out of Chattanooga by Union Gen. William Rosecrans, Confederate General Braxton Bragg was determined to retake the city. On September 17, 1863, Bragg headed north, intending to meet and beat the XXI Army Corps. The following day, Bragg’s cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry armed with Spencer repeating rifles and the Battle of Chickamauga was underway. Fighting began in earnest on the morning of the 19th and Bragg's men hammered but did not break the Union line. The next day, Bragg continued his assault on the Union line on the left, and in late morning, Rosecrans was informed that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore up the supposed gap, Rosecrans created another one, and Confederate Gen. James Longstreet's men promptly exploited it, driving one-third of the Union army, including Rosecrans himself, from the field. Although George H. Thomas took over command and began consolidating forces, the Rebels launched determined assaults and held until after dark. Thomas led his men from the field leaving it to the Confederates.\n\nWith the help of the Georgia Battlefields Association and the American Battlefield Protection Program, these 4 acres, part of the ground of the Confederate seizure of Reed’s Bridge where the Battle of Chickamauga began, have been saved forever by the American Battlefield Trust.\n\nCELEBRATE OUR VICTORIES!\n\nTogether, we have saved more than 58,000 acres of battlefield land in 25 states, including historic properties at Antietam, Chancellorsville, Chattanooga, Gettysburg, Princeton, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Wilson’s Creek, the Wilderness and more.\n\nSee All Recent Victories\n\nOur work has led to remarkable success stories in the preservation of battlefields. Among these stories is the inspiring transformation of Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Franklin Battlefield, once consecrated with the blood of Union and Confederate soldiers, was at risk of being lost to commercial development.\n\nOver the past two decades, we have worked tirelessly with local preservation groups to reclaim the Franklin battlefield and preserve this hallowed ground. Today, we stand on the brink of success.\n\nThere is, however, a crucial missing piece in the heart of the battlefield: a 0.60-acre tract of land with a contemporary warehouse.\n\nThis tract at Franklin Battlefield is the final obstacle preventing visitors from experiencing the full magnitude of the Confederates' charge against the Union earthworks.\n\nBy securing this land, we can ensure that future generations truly understand the significance of the events that unfolded in ''Bloody Franklin'' on that fateful day.\n\nThe cost of acquiring this small but vital property is an astonishing $5 million. Thanks to the collective efforts of local preservation organizations, Franklin's Charge, the Battle of Franklin Trust, and anticipated support from local and state government and the American Battlefield Protection Program, we are within reach of our goal.\n\nToday, we are reaching out to you for support to raise the final $100,000.\n\nPlease make a donation and contribute to securing this critical tract of battlefield land in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nAs a token of our gratitude, if you can contribute $64 or more, you will receive an exclusive Preservation Edition of Let Us Die Like Men: The Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.\n\nThank you for considering this opportunity to make a lasting impact. Together, we can ensure that this precious piece of history is preserved for generations to come.\n\n'Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan, President\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nP.S. Give today and have your gift matched $50-to-$1. You'll help nearly complete the once-lost Battlefield at Franklin and preserve this land forever.\n\nIt’s no secret that land on and near where the 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville raged in Virginia is often threatened by new developments, which is why I’m especially pleased today to tell you we’ve had a big win in the area. As a result of your help, we can now declare victory on nearly 44 acres of land at the Flank Attack of the Battle of Chancellorsville , including land associated with original Chancellor plantation and Dowdall’s Tavern.\n\nWhen we began the fight to preserve these threatened acres, Historian Bob Krick said, “The survival, undeveloped, of a tract this large in this crucial location is nothing short of miraculous. Saving it will be a spectacular preservation coup.” Well, folks, we like to perform miracles. And, with your help, we have. Thank you!\n\nLandmarks of Battle\n\nThe first tract is 42 acres in the heart of the Chancellorsville Battlefield. At the time of the war, the property was part of Wilderness Baptist Church pastor Reverend Melzi A. Chancellor’s plantation. The parcel we’ve saved likely includes the former site of Chancellor’s residence, known as Dowdall’s Tavern. During the 1863 clash, Dowdall’s Tavern was a prominent landmark and was used as headquarters by Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, commander of the Union XI Corps. Union regiments and batteries under the command of Col. Adolphus Buschbeck were positioned in entrenchments on the southern edge of the property, facing south. When Lt. Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson launched his massive flank attack from the west on May 2, the XI Corps was not in position to confront the Confederate assault and its forces were rapidly rolled up and forced into full retreat down the Plank Road to the Chancellorsville intersection three miles east. A granite monument commemorating the 154th New York Infantry Regiment , which was one of the units driven from the property by Jackson’s attack, stands here.\n\nThe Union retreat also crossed over the nearly two additional acres of now preserved land located just east of the historic Dowdall’s Tavern property and farm. The land here, which was heavily wooded at the time of the battle, was behind the Confederate lines and these acres we have now saved likely served as a staging area for renewed Confederate attacks throughout May 3.\n\nVIDEO: Watch an overview of what happened at Dowdall’s Tavern and why it matters.\n\nIn the wake of the XI Corps’ rout, Dowdall’s Tavern became a field hospital for wounded Union soldiers, who were by that time prisoners behind Confederate lines. Surgeon George Suckley, medical director of the XI Corps, remained at Dowdall’s Tavern and oversaw the care of an estimated 1,100 Union wounded.\n\nUSCT History\n\nA year after Chancellorsville, On May 7, 1864, Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero and his men of the United States Colored Troops (USCT), many of them formerly enslaved men themselves, camped on the tract following the Battle of the Wilderness. Ferrero temporarily established his headquarters at Dowdall’s Tavern. Elements of the division remained on and around the land for over a week. Some of these very regiments participated in the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg.\n\nPreserving these acres is a special victory as they help us tell a fuller story of the Civil War in Virginia. We can’t thank you enough for helping us do so!\n\n‘Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan\n\nPresident\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nP.S. We’re not done fighting to preserve Chancellorsville. New threats, including a proposed gas station near the ruins of the iconic Chancellor House, are looming. Find out how you can help us preserve the heart of the Chancellorsville Battlefield.\n\nToday, we have the chance to preserve precious hallowed ground at three battlefields — Spotsylvania Court House in Virginia, and Corinth and Champion Hill, both in Mississippi.\n\nBattlefield land at these historic places is seldom available, and if we don’t save these acres now, we may never get the chance again. While the cost of preserving battlefield land is not cheap, not saving our history is simply a price we cannot afford.\n\nThe battles at Spotsylvania Court House, Corinth, and Champion Hill carried an especially heavy cost. Combined, they resulted in approximately 45,000 casualties — a tremendous number of lives, limbs, and livelihoods lost.\n\nWhen the Spotsylvania Court House property came on the market, there were seven bidders on the first day, including the Trust. Fortunately, by the end of that day, the Trust was able to secure a contract on the land.\n\nYes, things can move that quickly.\n\nIt’s been that way for a while now and it keeps getting more challenging. The pressure from developers to pay over market price so they can build new houses, data centers, warehouses, and solar farms is intense.\n\nBut we do have something they don’t have — we have fiercely loyal history lovers like you, Paul, who care about the future of our country and want to protect and preserve our past.\n\nPlease make a donation today to help honor the heroes of this hallowed ground in Virginia and Misssissippi.\n\nMany Americans paid the ultimate price fighting on these battlefields, and we owe it to all future generations to preserve their memory and our history.\n\nAs a special gift and a token of my gratitude, if you make a gift of $60 or more today, you will receive a copy of the Trust’s newest book, The Cost of War: A Visual Summary of Civil War Devastation. This is a newly published work exclusively available to American Battlefield Trust members. You won’t want to miss out on this limited-time offer!\n\n'Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan, President\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nNOTE: See Community News post about lawsuit filed to stop this action.\n\nFrom National Parks Traveler\n\nApparently not even Ken Burns could prevent a massive, energy-thirsty data center from being built across from Manassas National Battlefield Park in Virginia.\n\nBurns, who along with Dayton Duncan in 2009 celebrated the National Park System with their documentary, The National Parks: America's Best Idea, in January 2022 had reached out to the chair of the Prince William County supervisors urging them to oppose allowing the PW Digital Gateway from being built on 2,000 acres next to the battlefield, which was the setting for the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) on July 21, 1861, and the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas) over nearly the same ground during August 28-30, 1862.\n\n\"As a student and chronicler of American history for more than 40 years, I can attest to how fragile our precious heritage is and how susceptible it can be to the ravages of 'progress,'\" Burns said in that letter. \"I learned while making my documentary series The Civil War in the late 1980s—and again when I made my 2009 series on the history of the national parks—how crucial the preservation of our historic landscapes is, and I fear the devastating impact the development of up to 2,133 acres of data centers will have on this hallowed ground.\"\n\nNevertheless, the county supervisors voted on Wednesday to rezone 2,100 acres for the digital complex, which the National Parks Conservation Association compared to \"the size of several Pentagons.\"\n\nThe proposal had prompted Preservation Virgina back in 2022 to list Manassas National Battlefield Park on its \"Most Endangered Historic Places\" list.\n\n\"Locating data centers within technology corridors and away from culturally sensitive areas would convey how local governments value and support the preservation of their irreplaceable historic resources,\" the organization said in its 2022 list of endangered sites.\n\nIn reviewing the proposal in 2022, Justin Patton, the Prince William County archaeologist, wrote that the project would \"have a high potential to adversely affect cultural resources in the following forms: indirect effects such as Audio, and Visual; and direct effects in the destruction of the resource. Transportation improvements necessary to implement land use and zoning changes, will likely have an indirect and direct effects on our history as well.\"\n\n\"This vote is a tremendous failure on the part of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors – one that will have lasting consequences for generations of Virginians,\" said Kyle Hart, NPCA's Mid-Atlantic program manager. \"Giving developers the OK to build massive data centers in the shadow of Manassas National Battlefield Park is an insult to the thousands of lives lost here in two of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil War. It’s a disservice to the hundreds of thousands of people who come from all over the world to visit the battlefield every year, searching for solace and meaning on these hallowed grounds.\n\n“This decision should be a wake-up call for national park advocates and conservationists across the Commonwealth of Virginia,\" added Hart. \"Our leaders failed us here in Prince William, but it doesn’t have to be that way. With common sense reforms and regulations in place, data centers can be appropriately sited and built with far less risk to our priceless history or our climate. That did not happen today.\"\n\nThis year has seen us in many proverbial \"engagements\", comprising a very active campaign over the last few months. Our army of preservationists has marched hard and fought well: Third Winchester, Cedar Creek, and now Fisher's Hill. The key to victory is continued momentum. That is why we press onward, adding more saved acreage every step of the way. We must not let up, not now when further victories are so close at hand!\n\nIn 1864, the fate of the Shenandoah Valley hung in the balance at the Battle of Fisher's Hill. General Ramseur's force of North Carolinians had anchored themselves in trenches on the left of the Confederate line in anticipation of General Crook's Army of West Virginia. From the banks of Tumbling Run to the crest of the high ground known today as Ramseur's Hill was the Funkhouser farm and homestead, the latter of which was likely used as a Union field hospital after the battle. Today, these 146 acres hang in the balance in the face of advancing development. The loss of this hallowed ground would be a detriment to the preservation of a greater Fisher's Hill Battlefield Park.\n\nThat is why I need you in the fight to save this core section of battlefield. Knowing that swift action was needed, we entered a contract and made a down payment of $100,000 to the property owners. This was a major first step towards victory, but that brought further costs we now need to satisfy. From loan interest, legal fees and surveys, appraisals, and more, the total cost of securing this property necessitates raising $308,000. I am asking you to make a gift today as we raise the $100,000 to meet the cost of the down payment. Doing so will help us secure another $1.5 million in state and federal funds that can be directed towards this project!\n\nMaking a gift today yields swifter and more decisive results as we fight to preserve Ramseur's Hill and add it to the acreage saved at Fisher's Hill Battlefield. Victory will equate to cascading progress on multiple fronts. The interest on this project is $10,000 a month alone - the sooner that is neutralized, the sooner we can turn our guns to other projects elsewhere in the Valley. That is why we must act now and finish this fight. There are other battlefields that need our attention, but today our sights are set here.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DONATE\n\nForward to Victory,\n\nFranklin Van Valkenburg, Development Officer\n\nA generous donor has stepped up to match dollar-for-dollar every Giving Tuesday gift we receive, up to $50,000.

Thank you for your support.\n\n‘Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan, President\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nP.S. You don’t have to wait until November 28 to make your contribution\n\nFROM THE AMERICAN BATTLEFIELD TRUST\n\nSometimes big things come in small packages! In August 2021, I asked for your help saving a little more than 400 acres across four sacred battlefields of the Western Theater. The smallest parcel of ground included just six-tenths of an acre in Corinth, Miss. — a small plot of land that played a big role in the Battle of Corinth. Located literally across the street from the Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center, it was our hope to purchase the land, steward it and transfer it to the National Park Service for incorporation into the Corinth Battlefield Unit of Shiloh National Military Park. I’m excited to tell you that with your help, we’ve done just that!\n\nCulminating Action\n\nThe 0.56-acre tract, now part of the National Park Service site, saw significant action on the second day of the Battle of Corinth. In the pre-dawn hours of October 4, 1862, Union skirmishers from the 63rd Ohio took a position that crossed the property and remained there until Confederate forces advanced later in the morning. The left flank of two Confederate brigades made multiple charges against the Union line across the land, with both sustaining heavy casualties in the culminating action of the battle.\n\nSaving this small parcel of land “is critical to telling the story of one of the more crucial but often overlooked battles in the Western Theater,” says Dan Davis, the Trust’s Senior Education Manager.\n\nPiecing History Together\n\nThe Trust is also working with the National Park Service to transfer about 29 additional acres of land to be incorporated into the Corinth Battlefield Unit of Shiloh National Military Park, land that includes intermittent remnants of the once extensive seven-mile line of earthworks built by Confederate forces in 1862 to defend the strategic transportation hub at Corinth, Miss. That land also later compromised part of the Corinth Contraband Camp, which housed thousands of former slaves and operated under the authority of the Union Army from November 1862 – December 1863.\n\nFolks, these parcels of land may be small, but the history they hold that we can share with future generations forever is huge. We can’t thank you enough for helping us do so!\n\n‘Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan\n\nPresident\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nAt the Trust, we’ve spent the last few months working to secure highly-threatened tracts of land and funding for one of our most critical Western Theater campaigns in Tennessee at the Battle of Shiloh and the Battle of Stones River.\n\nThis is one of the best chances we will ever have to hold the developers at bay and secure two decisive preservation victories!\n\nLast year, Tennessee had its largest population growth in 15 years, placing a major strain on Western Theater battlefields, including the two I’m sharing more about today.\n\nFor example, in Murfreesboro, where the Battle of Stones River took place, there are new housing tracts and shopping centers sprouting up everywhere in one of the fastest growing areas in the country.\n\nSeeing hallowed ground lost to development rends our hearts.\n\nWithout question, the land at Stones River will be lost to commercial or high-density apartments if it is not preserved. And the acreage at Shiloh is attractive for development, too!\n\nWhen you give bulldozers to developers, it seems like nothing is sacred.\n\nThe lands where men fought, bled, and died, and the places where America’s history was shaped and defined, are deeply sacred to me, and I know they’re sacred to you, Paul.\n\nBesides, history teaches that the opening days of a battle don’t always determine the victor. That’s true of Shiloh, and it’s true of Stones River as well.\n\nThe two large parcels of land we are working to acquire and preserve right now both played crucial roles in those early hours and days when no one knew what the outcome of the battles, and the Civil War itself, would be!\n\nWe must act now.\n\nWith more than $8 million in anticipated government grants and pledged gifts, we have $421,000 to raise to see this land preserved forever. This means your gift to save this at-risk land in Tennessee will be multiplied by a factor of 20!\n\nHelp preserve 184 acres of hallowed ground at two of the bloodiest battles of the entire Civil War by making donation today.\n\n‘Til the battle is won,\n\nDavid N. Duncan\n\nPresident\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nI’m always eager to share victories with you for battlefield land that we’ve saved forever, but today I’m excited to share some different successes with you, restoration victories, including in Gettysburg, at Lookout Mountain, Tenn., and Eutaw Springs, S.C.\n\nOur mission is to “Preserve. Educate. Inspire.” So, it’s not enough to just save battlefield land, we want to use it to teach and inspire future generations. To do that, we sometimes have to restore the landscape. We can’t just acquire lands that have been compromised and corrupted by decades of neglect and development and leave them as they are. We have to restore hallowed ground. Folks, I’m here to say, “Thank you!” Because together, with the help of our members, donors and partner organizations we have done that at these locations.\n\nHole in One\n\nEntering Gettysburg National Military Park from the east, visitors have for years driven past glimpses of the abandoned and overgrown Mulligan McDuffers Adventure Golf & Ice Cream Parlor. With the help of our members and donors, this autumn we began removing the adventure park structures, hauling away old concrete and grading the land to lay down soil and grass seed at the site of an important position on the Union right flank during the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nTwo artillery pieces of the 1st New York Light Artillery Battery M, commanded by Lt. Charles E. Winegar were positioned on the edge of the property, split between here and Power’s Hill, directly across Baltimore Pike. On the afternoon of July 2, 1863, 14 cannons were placed on Power’s Hill. In conjunction with 10 more nearby artillery pieces to the north along Baltimore Pike, the two cannons on this land were positioned to cover the Union right—specifically the low ground to the south of Culp’s Hill known as Spangler’s Spring and Spangler’s Meadow. Collectively, the Union cannons in the area unleashed such a destructive fire during the seven-hour battle near Culp’s Hill on July 3rd that Confederate Gen. George Steuart called his position near Spangler’s Spring “artillery hell.”\n\nWhen the restoration work is completed here, visitors to the battlefield can once again envision cannons and caissons located on the ground and Lt. Winegar commanding “Fire!” rather than “Fore!” For that, we are grateful to you!\n\nOn Lookout Mountain\n\nFor decades, a former 1940s travel motel blemished approximately an acre of land next to the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park, hallowed ground that played an important role in the Battle of Lookout Mountain. In June 2023, with the unwavering support of our members and donors, the Trust was able to demolish the motel and lay down sod to restore the field.\n\nOverlooking the Tennessee River, Lookout Mountain boasted a seemingly strong position for Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg and his Army of Tennessee as they kept the Union Army pinned at Chattanooga. On November 24, 1863, after the successful Union capture of Orchard Knob the day prior, Gen. Joseph Hooker ordered his three divisions to attack the Confederate left at Lookout Mountain.\n\nThe Wauhatchie Pike, the main road over the mountain during the time of the battle, runs by and through this field, the route of Confederate retreat. Some Union soldiers also crossed over the tract as they began their ascension of the mountain, helping lead to Union success at Missionary Ridge the following day on November 25.\n\nThe preservation — and now restoration — of this tract will ensure it continues to tell the story of the Battle of Lookout Mountain for generations to come.\n\nEutaw Springs\n\nUpon a roughly four-acre tract of land saved by the American Battlefield Trust — in collaboration with our partner on The Liberty Trail, the South Carolina Battleground Preservation Trust (SCBPT) — stands a spectacular, centuries-old oak tree, a witness to the Battle of Eutaw Springs on September 8, 1781, the last major engagement of the Revolutionary War in the Carolinas.\n\nWhile fighting initially erupted a little over three miles west of the site, the morning of September 8 — when General Nathanael Greene’s column surprised a British patrol and foraging party — significant maneuvers and combat unfurled upon this land later in the day. All the while, the young oak tree stood as witness to a well-fought battle, after which the Continental Congress recognized Greene’s exceptional service with one of only seven gold medals given during the war.\n\nThe now-imposing tree then saw the nation and its people transform, including its surroundings which until this summer included modern features like a house, car port and chain link fence. Thanks to the generous help of our members, donors and partners its surrounding landscape has been restored to a grassy field reminiscent of September 1781.\n\nIt’s not enough to buy the land and declare “Victory! ... Battlefield saved!” Sometimes, that’s only half the battle. This work isn’t glamorous. It’s roll-up-your-sleeves hard work and it takes time and resources. But it’s absolutely necessary to create authentic battlefield experiences.\n\nThank you for the generous support that has helped us do the dirty work and restore this hallowed ground, and with it, share the stories of the history that happened here.\n\nDavid N. Duncan, President\n\nAmerican Battlefield Trust\n\nFriends,\n\nOctober 19th marks the 159th anniversary of the Battle of Cedar Creek and we're within reach of preserving the heart of the historic Hite Farm – 74 acres of core battlefield – the exact point where the center of Kershaw’s Confederate infantry division came screaming out of the early morning darkness and crashed into the Union defenses. This property was unobtainable 10 years ago, but thanks to the generosity of the Brill family (who agreed to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars of the property’s value), grant funding from the Commonwealth of Virginia and the help of many of you – of the total purchase price of $1.4 million, only $152,000 remains to be raised! When we raise these funds, the property will be forever protected, and we will be able to immediately open it to the public. These 74 acres connect two previously preserved tracts, and once preserved, will link all the properties on this end of the battlefield into one visitor experience with a connecting trail that will provide access.\n\nThe natural beauty of this site alone would make it worthy of protection, but it’s the significance of the property as it relates to the battle that makes this tract so critical to preserve. This is the place where one of the greatest surprise attacks in military history was made. It is the location of the center of Kershaw’s attacking lines. It was here that the men of Barksdale’s old Mississippi Brigade surged up the slopes above the creek and over the Federal works. The brigade had been commanded by General Humphries (pronounced in Mississippi without the H) until about six weeks before the Battle of Cedar Creek when Humphries was severely wounded at the Battle of Berryville. On the morning of October 19th, 1864, the brigade marched through the Town of Strasburg in absolute silence. They forded the creek sometime after 4 a.m. and as quietly as possible got into position at the base of the slope. Just before 5 a.m., and before first light, the order to advance was given. These soldiers were hundreds of miles from home and before them in the pre-dawn darkness waited victory or death.\n\nAs they reached the Federal trenches, they let out the rebel yell – breaking the stillness of the morning and opening the battle that was to be the last best hope for the Confederates in the Valley. The Federal defenders were caught completely unaware. Those who manned the trenches feebly attempted to respond; many were roused from their slumber to scenes of pure terror as their comrades came running for their lives through the camps, followed closely by the Confederate attackers.\n\nI’m sure that you can picture it. It’s the scene that most of us think of when we hear the words, Cedar Creek. The battle will rage on for another twelve hours or more, but it is this first attack that has defined the battle in most of our minds. That stirring, terrible, desperate, heroic, and electrifying scene was played out on this 74-acre tract. That first attack surged across many other parcels of ground as well, but the place where the center of Kershaw’s Division, the division first to attack, hit the unsuspecting Union boys from Ohio is here, on the parcel of ground that you and I have the opportunity to save.\n\nWe are almost there. Just like those Mississippi men in October of ’64, we have come so far and now it’s time to make the final attack. Victory is within our grasp and if we come together now and give it everything we’ve got, this ground can be forever protected. We need to raise the final $152,000. Please join this fight to save 74 acres at Cedar Creek. Whether you give a lot or a little, please do all that you can to make the fight successful.\n\nI really can’t even begin to express how grateful I am for all that you do to save our battlefields and I know that because of you, these 74 acres at Cedar Creek are on the cusp of being saved forever.\n\nSee you at the Front,\n\nKeven Walker, Chief Executive Officer\n\nDonate to Save 74 Acres at Cedar Creek"
