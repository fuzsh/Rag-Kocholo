        "text": "Returning to civilian life, Calhoun’s career was quite extensive. He worked as a railway survey artist, photographer, writer and special artist for Harper’s Weekly and the Philadelphia Press. A member of the Union Pacific survey party led by General Wright and Dr. William Bell through Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado in the 1860s, he befriended Kit Carson and other famous scouts and pioneers, and was known for his descriptive and entertaining accounts of skirmishes with Indians. In 1867, an illustration of a battle and a view of Fort Wallace in the Kansas territory were published by Harper’s from his sketches. He is listed as a journalist in the Brooklyn Directories for 1880-1882 and 1890-1892.\n\nIn addition to his other accomplishments, Major Calhoun collaborated on a play, The Color Guard, which contained the popular songs, “Marching Through Georgia,” and “Tramp, Tramp, Tramp.” He wrote a number of books including Kohala of Hawaii: A Story of the Sandwich Islands Revolution.

An article published March 13, 1888, in The New York Times notes that he was the conductor of a train that was struck by another train while standing at the station at Dobbs Ferry, New York, during a blinding snowstorm the previous evening, causing a number of injuries to passengers.\n\nThe New York City Directories for 1894-1895, 1895-1896 and 1897-1899 list Calkins as a collector. His military service in the Civil War was confirmed by the Veterans Schedule of 1890. The censuses from 1900, 1910, and 1920 indicate that he earned a living as a bill collector for the gas company. He was a member of the Freemasons. The Roll of Registered Voters in New York City for 1924 lists Calkins as living in Queens. His last address was 101-57 123rd Street in Richmond Hill, Queens.

This regiment was first known as “Scott’s 900 Volunteer Cavalry.” His company first served in Washington, D.C., then did picket duty in the area of the Potomac River before being assigned to the Army of the Gulf. Promotions to corporal on July 24, 1862, sergeant on November 11, 1862, first sergeant on February 8, 1863, and first lieutenant on January 7, 1865, marked milestones in Calvert’s military service.

Grant Post #327 and a post commander, he was said to be “one of the most active and ardent supporters of all measures pertaining to the advancement of the G.A.R.” He also played an active role in securing the erection of an equestrian statue of General Grant on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn. His last residence was 169 McDonough Street in Brooklyn where he died from heart disease at age 94. Section 171, lot 12958.\n\nCAMBRELENG (or CAMBRELLING, CAMBRELING), CHURCHILL J. (1836-1894).

K. Warren and Fitz John Porter (see) recommended him for promotion. He was elected major in the 10th Senatorial District Regiment but prolonged sickness resulted in his resignation. He resigned on July 23, 1862, due to ill health caused by exposure during the Peninsula Campaign. Cambreleng was brevetted to major for his service in the War.\n\nHe is listed as an agent in the Brooklyn Directories for 1885-1885 and 1885-1886.

(1833-1878). Chaplain, Confederate States of America. Cameron was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and lived in Elkton, Maryland. An Episcopal chaplain for the Confederacy, he wrote two patriotic songs, God Save the Southern Land and Close Up the Ranks. First serving as chaplain for the 1st Maryland, he enlisted on July 4, 1861, and his appointment was accepted two days later. A request was made on November 5, 1862, by Colonel W. B. Tabb to appoint Cameron to the 59th Virginia Volunteers. Tabb wrote, “…From authority which I regard with the highest confidence, I am fully assured of his capacity and zeal for usefulness. He already holds the appointment as chaplain in the C.S. Provisional Army. Your favorable endorsement of this paper will ensure his assignment to your Brigade.” In 1863, he went to London, England, ostensibly to arrange for the publication of prayer books, but in fact was engaging in activities on behalf of the Confederacy.\n\nThe Lee Family Digital Archive includes this letter from Cameron to General Robert E. Lee, dated February 13, 1864:\n\nGeneral\n\nI have the honor to offer for your acceptance, a sword especially designed by a son of Maryland, for your use in the camp and field, bearing your name on the one side of the blade and on the reverse the motto, “Aide toi et Dieu t’aideras” (Help yourself and God will help you). It is not offered in the vain assurance of individual appreciation of your eminent deserts, but as an earnest of the devoted attachment which is entertained for you, General by every true patriot of that renewed and gallant, though now down-trodden State.\n\nTo you as the great defender of a sacred and glorious cause, wise in council & humane in the hour of victory, trusting rather in the Providence of God than in the might of man & right, belongs the sword, with the sacred cross emblazoned on the hilt, as once the emblem of our hope and promise of assured success. This sword I have the honor to ask you to accept, with the accompanying note from the donor, as the representative commander of as brave an army as ever marched to battle, and of “sun burned veterans” whose names are honored as confederate soldiers, throughout Europe and the civilized world and who have proved themselves heroes in deeds of unsurpassed endurance and daring.\n\nIt may be a source of gratification in your life of hardship and high responsibility to know that fervent prayers follow your steps and that whilst your contemporaries glory in your achievements, faithful history must record your fame, in pages of living truth.\n\nI shall at once hasten to offer this gift personally, or if you see proper to appoint a time and place, await your orders, remaining Sir\n\nMost respectfully\n\nYour Obt [obedient] Servant\n\nS.F. Cameron\n\nIn 1864, the renowned Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan requested that Cameron be appointed to his cavalry brigade. On September 6, 1864, he delivered the eulogy for General Morgan who was killed while trying to escape from a Union raid near Greeneville, Tennessee. Cameron was also associated with the aftermath of the raid on St. Albans, Vermont, on October 19, 1864. The raid was meant to obtain money for the Confederacy and cause confusion on the Northern border. Three banks were robbed of more than $200,000, horses were stolen, one citizen was killed and two were wounded; efforts to burn the town were unsuccessful. The Confederate raiders escaped to Canada, were pursued by Vermonters, and eventually some were captured and arrested by Canadians. Canada, a British colony at the time, refused to extradite the raiders, and eventually released them, straining relations between the United States and Great Britain. According to the papers of Jefferson Davis, Cameron met with Davis on February 2, 1865, and then was dispatched as a Confederate messenger to take documents to Canada to aid in the raiders’ defense. While on this mission for Davis, Cameron dressed as a priest when he crossed the Potomac and was accompanied by two women spies who dressed as nuns. The threesome were fired upon but escaped and completed their assignment.\n\nCameron also was called to testify at the trial of John H. Surratt, who was accused of conspiring with John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Surratt, who had met with Booth, testified that he was in Elmira, New York, on a spying mission for General Robert E. Lee on the day of the assassination, and did not know of the plot. Surratt later fled to Canada, then to Egypt where he was arrested in 1867 and brought to Washington, D.C., for a civilian trial which ultimately ended in a hung jury. Records of that trial indicate that Cameron, one of 170 witnesses, applied for and received a pardon for his role in the War. The pardon was granted on July 4, 1867, by President Andrew Johnson. He died from tuberculosis at New York City Hospital. Originally interred in Section 77, lot 8319, Cameron’s remains later were removed to their current location.

As per his biography in John W. Black’s Carte de Visite collection at the Massachusetts Historical Society, Cammeyer was a comic opera singer known as Neil Gray in New York City minstrel shows before he volunteered for service in the Civil War. (Minstrel shows, which were popular from the mid-19th century well into the 20th century, had white performers depicting “blackness” by wearing exaggerated costumes and blackface make-up, supposedly for comedic effect, but relying on racist derision and stereotyping at its core.) His soldier record notes that he enlisted as a private at Fort Schuyler, New York, on June 28, 1861, and mustered into Company H of the 71st Pennsylvania, also known as the 1st California Regiment. The aforementioned biographical sketch reports that he was a private in a California [a town in Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh] regiment and was captured in battle with other Pennsylvanians and imprisoned in Richmond, Virginia. Apparently, the California Brigade lost heavily at the Battle of Ball’s Bluff and the four commands of Colonel Edward D. Baker, who died in that battle, were designated as the 69th, 71st, 72nd, and 106th Regiments and known familiarly as the Philadelphia Brigade. Cammeyer was released after several months and mustered out with his regiment in May 1862.\n\nCammeyer then worked as a singer at Barnum’s Museum and as an actor on Broadway performing alongside Edwin Booth, the brother of President Abraham Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth, Charlotte Cushman and other stars.

His muster roll notes that he was a plumber who was 5′ 6″ tall with blue eyes and auburn hair. As per Battle of Second Manassas (another name for Second Bull Run) by Brian C. Pohanka, “Recruit James Cathie stood his ground alongside Irish-born veteran James Patterson (see) in the ranks of Company G. Grimly reloading amid the slaughter, Cathie turned to Patterson and said, “Look out for Siss__.” A fatal bullet cut him down before he could finish….” On August 30, 1862, at that battle, the 5th New York lost 123 men in five minutes, the greatest loss of life in any single infantry regiment during the Civil War.\n\nNews of Cathie’s death did not reach his family immediately.

It is unclear where James Cathie is buried or if his body was ever recovered; his parents are buried in Section 24, lot 6781.\n\nCATLIN, ARNOLD WILLIS (1842-1931). Assistant surgeon, Union Army. An article in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1879 notes that Catlin was a member of Psi Upsilon Fraternity while in college, class of 1862; his name was identified as a Brooklyn member in that fraternity’s catalogue.

This regiment and the Sixty-sixth Regiment received orders to march on the enemy, who were at that time drawn up in a deep ditch at the foot of the hill on which we were, and from whence they were pouring a galling fire into our ranks. Animated by the presence of both their brigade and division commanders, the regiment moved forward with a determined enthusiasm I have never seen excelled. In a few minutes we had cleared the ditch of every living enemy; and were driving them in great disorder through the cornfield beyond…Remaining a short time in line at the farther end of this corn-field, I received orders to move the regiment to the support of a battery on our left and rear. I filed round the foot of the hill under a terrible fire of grape and canister, which fortunately caused us comparatively slight loss, being aimed too high…”\n\nSeverely wounded at Fredericksburg, Virginia, under Burnside, he was leading his command in protecting the pontoon bridge on the Rappahannock.
