        "text": "Yuri Gagarin's single orbit of the globe in April 1961 had proved that man could survive beyond Earth's atmosphere, and had soon been followed by two suborbital flights by the Americans Alan Shephard and Virgil Grissom. The next goal of the Soviet space programme was to see what the effects of a longer journey were on humans, and on August 6 1961 Titov was launched aboard Vostok (East) II.\n\nAt six weeks shy of his 26th birthday, Titov was (and remains) the youngest person to venture into space. In order for his craft to land on Soviet soil, it had to orbit the Earth either three or 17.5 times, and the latter course was chosen.\n\nThe voyage lasted 25 hrs 18 mins, and during it Titov also became the first man to sleep in space. He had some trouble getting to sleep, because when he lay down his arms floated up in the air, a problem he solved by strapping them under his safety belt. He then overslept by half an hour.\n\nWhile in space, Titov (unlike Gagarin) twice switched to manual control of his capsule, and carried out other tasks, including filming the Earth and eating lunch. This consisted of soup, liver food paste and blackcurrant juice. He spilled a few drops of this, and they hung in the air until he scooped them up with the lid of the tube.\n\nFrom a height of 159 miles, Titov had a splendid view of the planet. Africa seemed to him to resemble a yellow leopard, with green spots of jungle. On his sixth orbit he was overcome by excitement, and his call sign became a cry of exultation. \"I am Eagle! I am Eagle!\", he told mission control. A little later he began to feel dizzy and unwell; prolonged weightlessness meant that he had become the first man to get space sickness.\n\nGherman Stepanovich Titov was born on September 11 1935 in Verkhneye Zhilino, in the Altai region of Siberia. His great-grandfather had moved there, attracted by the promise of free farmland, and both of Titov's grandfathers helped to build the first peasants' commune in Altai, Maiskoe Utro ('May Morning').\n\nGherman was named after a character in Pushkin admired by his father, the schoolmaster in the village of Polkonikovo where Titov grew up. From an early age he showed that he possessed both tenacity and courage. Once he saved five other children by finding the way home in a sudden blizzard, and at the end of the war almost froze to death by the roadside after refusing to abandon a heavy sack of flour which was needed by his starving family.\n\nHe went to Nalobikhino secondary school and, having been inspired by a visit from an uncle who was a pilot, entered the 9th Military Air School at Kustanai, Kazakhstan in 1953. Titov's year were the first cadets at the school, and their first lesson was how to build schoolrooms for themselves.\n\nDespite almost being expelled for not taking the psychological tests seriously, after many rigours (including spending two weeks in a soundproof chamber), by 1960 he had emerged as one of six candidates for the first manned flight. He accompanied Gagarin, who was chosen to make the historic journey, to the launch site as the stand-by cosmonaut.\n\nAfter returning safely to Earth from his own voyage, Titov went to the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy, from which he graduated in 1968.\n\nFor much of the late 1960s, he was the cosmonaut best known to the West, as the Soviet Union restricted access to Gagarin. Titov visited America in 1962, where he met John Glenn. He also collaborated on a biography by Martin Caidin, I am Eagle (1962).\n\nBy 1967, he had qualified as a test pilot at the Chkalov school and began work on the Spiral spaceplane project, but Gagarin's death in an air crash the next year led to Titov being refused permission to fly. Frustrated by this, he opted for a career at the Soviet Ministry of Defence.\n\nHe became deputy director of the command and control centre of the Office for Space Facilities, where he was involved in the Salyut 3 mission in 1974, and later oversaw the construction of launch vehicles. In 1988, he welcomed Western reporters for the first time to Russia's equivalent of Cape Canaveral, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.\n\nFor many years he was on the board of the Soviet journal Aviatsiya i Kosmonavtika (Aviation and Spaceflight) and wrote a number of books, including Seventeen Cosmic Dawns (1963). He was also on the organising committee of the Moscow Olympics in 1980.\n\nTitov was twice awarded the Order of Lenin and was a Hero of the Soviet Union. Away from space, he enjoyed hunting, fishing and the theatre. He had learned to ski at three and as a young man skated and cycled.\n\nHe was found dead in a sauna in his Moscow flat, having been poisoned by carbon monoxide gas."
