        "text": "On August 6, 1961 at 08 hours 59 minutes 57 seconds Moscow Time (MT), launch vehicle Vostok launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome inserted into near-earth orbit space vehicle Vostok-2 operated by Cosmonaut-2 German Stepanovich Titov.\n\nThe Vostok-2 space vehicle was different in some respects from the Vostok-1 flown by the pioneer cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. Following the results of the first manned space vehicle flight analysis, the specialists from OKB-1 had modified the space vehicle which made it possible to extend space flight up to one week. Also radio communication system was modernized, TV system was changed. High-frequency system 'Signal' was added to the telemetry systems, which served to take bearings of the space vehicle and duplicate medial parameters transmission.\n\nThe main objective of the launch was to perform a 24-hour manned space flight.\n\nGerman Titov was the first to operate the space vehicle manually (in the1st and 7th orbits), to perform its attitude control and stabilization; he took meals, slept, took pictures of the Earth and space from the space vehicle board; took exercises; performed space filming; monitored operation of the space vehicle onboard systems.\n\nOn August 7, 1961 at 10 hours 18 minutes (MT) cosmonaut German Titov returned safely to Earth in the vicinity of settlement Krasny Kut, Saratov Region.\n\nDaily flight preformed by German Titov allowed to come to the following conclusion: the space technology built in our country enabled human beings to live and work under near-earth orbit conditions.\n\nFlight plan for cosmonaut German Titov published\n\nIn May 1961, a group of five cosmonauts began to prepare for a flight on the Vostok 2 spacecraft: V.F. Bykovsky, G.G. Nelyubov, A.G. Nikolaev, P.R. Popovich and G.S. Titov. By July 20, they completely mastered the theoretical section of the training program, underwent special types of tests and training, as well as an in-depth clinical and physiological examination at the aviation hospital (TsNIAH).\n\nBased on this, on July 21, 1961, the head of the Cosmonaut Training Center E.A. Karpov drew up a report in which he recommended to appoint cosmonauts for the second space flight in the following order: G.S. Titov, A.G. Nikolaev and V.F. Bykovsky. As a result, the State Commission appointed G.S. Titov (call sign \"Eagle\"), and the backup, A.G. Nikolaev.\n\nOn Aug. 6, 1961, at 9 a.m. Moscow time, the Vostok 2 spacecraft launched into orbit. At the very first orbit, Gherman Titov tested the ship's manual orientation mode. Flying over different continents, he transmitted greetings to the peoples and countries of these regions of the Earth by radio. With the help of a professional film camera \"Konvas\" G.S. Titov completed a 10-minute survey of the Earth through the ship's porthole.\n\nThe Ð ÐÐÐÐ¢Ð contains a set of archival documents related to this historical event, including âFlight mission of Comrade G.S. Titov, comrade Nikolaev A.G. for the flight on the Vostok-3A spacecraft No. 4.1961. RGANTD. F.1. Op. 3-6. D 2. L. 110-116."
