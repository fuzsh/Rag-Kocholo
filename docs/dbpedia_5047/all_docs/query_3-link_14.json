Just more than a week later, on September 20, Gherman Titov, the second man in space, a Hero of the Soviet Union, a member of the State Duma, and a reserve colonel general, passed away. However, the memory of the cosmonaut and his heroic mission has been eternalized not only in Russia but everywhere around the world.\n\nNine other countries presented their awards to Gherman Titov, including such titles as the Hero of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hero of Socialist Labor of the People’s Republic of Bulgaria, Hero of the Mongolian People’s Republic, and the Order of Karl Marx — the most important order in the German Democratic Republic.\n\nGherman Titov’s name has been given to an island on the shores of Vietnam that was presented to the second cosmonaut personally by Ho Chi Minh, an asteroid, a crater on the Moon, and a seamount in the Pacific Ocean. In September 2007, a commemorative plaque was mounted on the building of the Russian Space Force Headquarters. The Main Test and Space Systems Control Center in Krasnoznamensk has been named after Gherman Titov. On October 4, 2012, the Air Force Day, a monument to the second human to orbit the Earth was unveiled there.\n\nThe memory of Gherman Titov is cherished particularly reverently in Altai Krai. The cosmonaut’s name has been given to one of the streets of the regional capital, where the hero’s bust has been erected in one of the squares. In the year of Titov’s 75th anniversary, the Altai Krai administration and the Russian Railways company introduced a new suburban train named “Vostok” after the series of spacecraft that took Soviet cosmonauts to space. The same year, the Altai Optical Laser Center and the Barnaul airport were named after Gherman Titov.\n\nIn the hero’s native Polkovnikovo village, there is the State Memorial Museum of Gherman Stepanovich Titov. It houses such exhibitions as “Altai and Outer Space” and “From the Spring Well to the Stars”. The first one celebrates the history of cosmonautics while the second one is dedicated to Gherman’s childhood and school years, his parents, and his sister.\n\nIn September 2018, Lastochkino Gnezdo (The Swallow’s Nest), a house where the future cosmonaut spent his youth, was also opened for visitors.\n\n#4\n\nMinistry of Culture of the Russian Federation\n\nread morehide"
