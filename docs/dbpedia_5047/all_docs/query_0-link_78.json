        "text": "Many Vietnamese people have their lives and careers attached to the Soviet Union. \"Heartfelt and righteous\" Russians helped them when they came to Russia to study and work. With the Russians, sincere Vietnamese people have become friends.\n\nIn the memories of many generations of Vietnamese people, the former Soviet Union and today's Russia occupy important positions. The Soviet Union helped Vietnam train nearly 40 officials and experts in many specialties. The relationship between Vietnam and the Soviet Union is special not only in material and spiritual aspects but also in deep emotions.\n\nTEACHERS IN THE SOVIET CLASSROOM\n\nWithout the help of countries including the Soviet Union, there would be no class of military pilots returning to serve the country during the war years. Hero of the armed forces, Lieutenant General Pham Tuan is one of the \"class\" of pilots whose career is closely linked to Russia and the Russian people.\n\nLieutenant General Pham Tuan assessed: \"With the former Soviet Union and with Russia today, we have always determined that this is a friend and a very important strategic cooperation.\n\nOur Party, State and people have highly appreciated Russia's role in the victory of the Vietnamese revolution as well as in the later work of building and defending the Fatherland.\n\nAs for me, Russia is a pride, a good and special feeling, because most of what I have and do is related to Russia.\n\nSince becoming a fighter pilot, shooting down a B-52 plane and becoming a space pilot, there have always been Russians accompanying me on such a long journey.\"\n\nLieutenant General Pham Tuan. Photo: Pham Hai\n\nHero Pham Tuan first set foot in the country of Bach Duong in 1965 when he was only 18 years old. Around the end of October 10, an intermodal train carrying Pham Tuan and many young Vietnamese people went to the Soviet Union to study air force engineering (aircraft mechanics).\n\nAfter a long journey, the young man was very impressed with the autumn landscape of Russia's majestic maples, oaks, and birches covered in yellow.\n\n“Russian teachers teach very enthusiastically. The teachers come from many backgrounds, some are children of martyrs so they understand war very well,\" Mr. Pham Tuan said about the Russians he was close to when he started learning the Russian language.\n\nTo him, they are truly warm-hearted, benevolent, naive, enthusiastic, open, and sociable people... It was only the first time we met but we felt close and intimate like family. Everyone loves the Vietnamese students like they are their close, blood relatives.\n\n“At that time, when talking about Vietnam, we were talking about war, so our Soviet friends all thought about how to help the Vietnamese people who came here have enough capacity, enough qualifications, and enough bravery to return home to fight and protect the country. defend the Fatherland,\" the Lieutenant General recounted.\n\nThere is one thing that he remembers now. Just a few weeks after studying, the Russian teacher asked Pham Tuan his birthday. Because of lack of vocabulary, he said it was January 1. I thought that was the end of it. Unexpectedly, exactly 1/1 teacher came to class with a birthday card, standing in front of the class to congratulate student Pham Tuan.\n\nThe whole class was stunned because that day was not his birthday. He didn't know how to explain it, he just explained to his friends that he wasn't fluent in Russian so he had to say that.\n\nIn April 4, Pham Tuan graduated and returned home. The day of parting was so memorable. The car picking up the group stopped right in front of the restaurant, and the kitchen ladies rushed out to see them off, with tears in their eyes. Some people are proud that the generation of trained Vietnamese pilots is qualified to return home and contribute to the fight.\n\nThere was an old woman who hugged her brothers and confided: Vietnamese pilots are still too young, \"coming back to fight is very dangerous, just stay here to become stronger.\"\n\nTeacher Doxuchep, the Platoon Commander who flew with Pham Tuan, also came to see him off. He hugged the nervous young man Pham Tuan and reminded him: \"When taking off to fight, you have to turn 360 degrees, Tuan - it's a pilot's survival\" (meaning to look around).\n\nPilot Pham Tuan (right) and astronaut Gorbatko received the decision to be the official flight pair.\n\nTwo pilots practice at the space center.\n\nLieutenant General Pham Tuan said that he later met that teacher many times. One time, when he returned for training at the Academy, the teacher took Pham Tuan to meet friends everywhere. Everywhere he went, he introduced: \"That's my student.\"\n\nWhenever he went on business trips to Russia, if possible, Lieutenant General Pham Tuan always came to his home in Krasnodar to visit him. One time before he left Krasnodar, that teacher came to the hotel with a jar of homemade mushrooms and a package of Russian sausages and asked Pham Tuan to bring them home as gifts for his family.\n\nDuring 10 years (1961-1972), the Soviet Union trained over 1.000 technical and professional staff for Vietnam, of which 447 were trained pilots, and 220 graduated as combat pilots.\n\nMost of the pilots sent had just completed 7th-8th grade, a few had completed 10th grade. Except for determination, other factors were not as good as the countries that also sent students to the Soviet Union. But with enthusiasm and special affection for Vietnam, Soviet teachers dedicatedly taught, trained, and helped young Vietnamese people gradually master the sky.\n\n“FRIENDS” MAKE HISTORY\n\n2025 will mark the 45th anniversary of the space flight of pilot Pham Tuan and Soviet cosmonaut Viktor Vassilyevich Gorbatko (July 23, 7).\n\nLieutenant General Pham Tuan remembered Gherman Titov as the second cosmonaut of the Soviet Union. Gherman Titov was also Chairman of the Soviet-Vietnamese Friendship Association for many years, making many contributions to the friendship between the two peoples. Mr. Pham Tuan said that it was Mr. Titov who proposed letting Vietnamese people fly into space.\n\n“Uncle Ho really appreciates space pilots. He met Titov many times. Mr. Titov also went to Vietnam many times and was personally led by Uncle Ho to visit Ha Long Bay. Later, a small island in the middle of the bay was named Ti top (named after space pilot Titov)\", Hero Pham Tuan said.\n\nAstronaut Gorbatko and pilot Pham Tuan when they returned to Earth after their flight into space. Photo: TTXVN\n\nWith his teammate flying into space, Lieutenant General Pham Tuan confided that in the past he still kept in regular contact and almost every year invited Mr. Gorbatko and his wife to Vietnam to rest and travel. \"From Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Da Nang, Ninh Thuan, Da Lat, Phu Quoc, Vung Tau... every summer when Gorbatko comes here, I take him to visit famous places in Vietnam,\" the Lieutenant General said.\n\nIn February 2, although his health declined, because of his love for the country and people of Vietnam, Viktor Gorbatko still went to Vietnam to attend the inauguration of a bust statue of him in Phan Rang city, Ninh Thuan. That was also the last time he visited Vietnam. Three months later, cosmonaut Gorbatko died at the age of 2017.\n\nWith Russian President Putin, Lieutenant General Pham Tuan told about the first time he met him in person. It was Mr. Putin's first visit to Vietnam as President of Russia. From February 28 to March 2, 2, Russian President Putin paid an official friendly visit to Vietnam, at the invitation of President Tran Duc Luong. In the delegation at that time there was also Mr. Viktor Gorbatko.\n\nThe schedule includes a meeting with Vietnamese people who studied in Russia at the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Cultural Palace. The hall was packed with people at that time. The number of Vietnamese who had studied in Russia was very large and returned home to live in many provinces and cities.\n\nPresident Putin waves as he attends a meeting of Vietnamese people who studied in Russia in 2001. Kremlin.ru\n\nBefore entering the hall, in a room there was a table with a set of books about Vietnam-Russia relations for President Putin to sign.\n\n“The president is very young, he sat at the table signing books, Gorbatko and I stood right behind. The President then shook my hand and congratulated me. At that time there were so many people, even now I feel sorry because I don't know who captured that moment,\" Lieutenant General Pham Tuan recalled.\n\nImpressed by the first meeting, Mr. Pham Tuan said that Russian President Putin is very straightforward and comfortable when interacting with former international students. The feelings of those attending that meeting were not the feelings between a leader of a great power and the people of a country, but the feelings of close brotherhood.\n\nThe traditional friendship and cooperation relationship between Vietnam and Russia is an invaluable asset and a solid foundation for the comprehensive strategic partnership between Vietnam and Russia in the current period. Lieutenant General Pham Tuan said that the relationship between the two countries is still on the path of development, inheriting achievements from history.\n\nHe was also pleased to see that people-to-people exchanges between the two countries continue to grow, with Vietnam-Russia friendship associations being established in many localities with a large number of members.\n\nThe article references the book Flying into space: The story of a three-time heroic space pilot - Lieutenant General Pham Tuan by author Nguyen Cong Huy\n\nSource: https://vietnamnet.vn/trung-tuong-pham-tuan-voi-ky-niem-ve-tong-thong-putin-va-nhung-nguoi-ban-nga-2292262.html"
