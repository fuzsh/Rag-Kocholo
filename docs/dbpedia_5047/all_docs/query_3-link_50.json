        "text": "Valery Bykovsky (born August 2, 1934, Pavlovsky Posad, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died March 27, 2019) was a Soviet cosmonaut who orbited Earth 81 times in the spacecraft Vostok 5, from June 14 to 19, 1963.\n\nBykovsky started flying lessons at the age of 16, joined the army in 1952, and in 1959 became a jet fighter pilot. In 1960 he began his training as a cosmonaut at the Zhukovsky Military Engineering Academy.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Astronauts and Cosmonauts\n\nOn June 16, 1963, after Bykovsky had been in orbit two days, the Soviet Union launched Vostok 6, carrying Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to travel in space. The two ships held parallel orbits, at one point approaching to within 5 km (3 miles) of one another, but did not rendezvous. They returned to Earth three hours apart. Bykovsky had spent nearly five days in orbit, which is the record for the longest solo spaceflight.\n\nBykovsky was made a member of the Communist Party on June 18, while still in orbit, and after his return he received his country’s highest honour, Hero of the Soviet Union. He was one of the few men to receive the Soviet Union’s highest combat award during peacetime, the Order of the Red Star, presumably for air-combat action in a border incident."
