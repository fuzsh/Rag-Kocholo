        "text": "Paper given at the 2015 \"After-Image: Life-Writing and Celebrity\" conference at TORCH, Oxford University. This paper examines how the American media reinterpreted the flights of three prominent early 1960s cosmonauts: Yuri Gagarin, Gherman Titov and Valentina Tereshkova. As confident, charismatic symbols of modernity, Soviet spacefarers attracted huge crowds and media attention, the American media was faced with a dilemma: how to satisfy public curiosity without inadvertently endorsing Soviet ideology? I explore the strategy that followed in which Soviet cosmonauts were depicted as glamorous \"Russian\" as opposed to \"Soviet\" celebrities, and the cracks that emerged in attempts to make cosmonauts conform to this idealised image.\n\nThe cold war took the world by strides after Second World War and continued till early 1990's until the disintegration of the USSR, More than a war, it was an ideological conflict. It was a conflict between what was a better way to run the world-Capitalism or Communism. Cold war refers to a situation where the countries are not actually at war with each other but still tensions prevail between them. It was a decade's long struggle for global domination and impacted each and every aspect of the world from politics to society and from economy to the science. The cold war resulted in the space war between the two power blocs in order to prove their supremacy before the world. During the cold war years a number of missions were undertaken both by the USA and USSR to prove their supremacy. Moreover at the same time so as to prevent the indiscriminate misuse of the space a number of treaties and conventions also came into the picture. This paper focuses on what cold war was and how it resulted in the space war. Along with this various space missions and treaty conventions have also been dealt it detail."
