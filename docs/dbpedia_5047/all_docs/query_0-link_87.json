        "text": "The year 2021 seemed to popularize the interest in space travel. Many tests were flown to space as well as celebrities getting their astronaut wings. It appears anyone can fly to space as long as they have the cash to do so. William Shatner has recently returned from space and others with tickets to fly are: Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, James Cameron and Michael Strahan.\n\nBurial in space is getting attention. There are now ashes released on the moon and Clyde Tombaugh, astronomer who discovered Pluto has a portion of his ashes that visited the planet and continues onward to be the first to reach interstellar space.\n\nThis has revived an interest in collecting astronaut autographs. Of course, many new to the field want to start with the firsts. The first to fly and enter space (12 April 1961) was Russian Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (1934-1968). Gagarin was banned from further space flights for fear of Russia losing the Hero of the Soviet Union. For February we examined our inventory and list some signed Gagarin autographs. If you study the Gagarin autographs posted on this site, you should easily pick out the many forgeries being offered elsewhere, complete with useless C.O.A.'s\n\n16 Astronaut Signatures BORMAN, Frank, BORMAN, Frank, CERNAN, Gene, CONRAD, Charles, Â DUKE, Charlie, EVANS, Ron, GLENN, John, GLENN, John, MATTINGLY, Ken, Â McDIVITT, James A., SCHMITT, Harrison, Â SCOTT, Dave, SLAYTON, Deke, STAFFORD, Tom, STAFFORD, Tom, SWIGERT, Jack\n\nA fabulous collection of 16 astronaut signatures.
