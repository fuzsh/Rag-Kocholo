        "text": "He needs little introduction. Albert Einstein’s face graced this US stamp on 14 March 1966 as part of the Prominent Americans series. Einstein went into print alongside Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower and Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to gain a medical degree from a US medical school. Einstein’s stamp was worth 8 cents – trumping Lincoln’s, which cost only 4.\n\nAt 9.47 am on 20 February 1962, John Glenn lifted off from Cape Canaveral. At 3.30 pm, a few minutes after his successful splashdown, this envelope and stamp were franked at the Cape in celebration. Glenn, whose signature is scribbled across the envelope, had become the first American to orbit the Earth, following in the rarefied footsteps of the Soviets Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov.\n\nIf you squint you can just make out the location of the frank: “ON THE MOON”.\n\nThe stamp pictures astronauts David Scott and James Irwin exploring the moon in a lunar rover in 1971. Later, the wonder of this other-worldly scene was tarnished for some when Scott and Irwin, with their Apollo 15 crewmate Al Worden, were criticised for making a deal to profit from postage stamp covers, a scandal Worden addressed in his book Falling to Earth.\n\nAmelia Earhart took off to fly across the Atlantic on 20 May 1932 carrying 50 stamped envelopes. They were franked in Newfoundland, Canada, where she began her journey, and again in Londonderry after she landed in Ireland, the first female pilot to fly solo across the ocean.\n\nWhen Earhart went missing over the Pacific Ocean in 1937, in an attempt to fly round the world, she was carrying around 5000 similar envelopes to be franked across the globe.\n\nThis Monaco stamp isn’t the only one to celebrate the hovering spectacle of the helicopters of Igor Sikorsky – the US also produced a stamp with the face of the engineer.\n\nSikorsky is still inspiring innovation in helicopter design. In July, Canada’s AeroVelo team finally won the AHS Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition, 33 years after it was set.\n\nThis scorched card was found in the wreckage of the Hindenburg. When the enormous airship caught fire on 6 May 1937, more than 17,000 pieces of post were on board. This letter survived and eventually reached its recipient, John Schoonbrod in New York, enclosed in protective paper and with an official seal."
