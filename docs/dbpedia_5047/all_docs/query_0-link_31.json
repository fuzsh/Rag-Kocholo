        "text": "Power, propulsion, and environmental control\n\nThe power-supply subsystem provides the electricity for other subsystems. In satellites that will be in orbit for extended periods, the power often is generated by solar cells, which convert energy from the Sun into electricity (see photoelectric device). They are lightweight, reasonably inexpensive, reliable, and long-lived—all essential requirements for a spacecraft power subsystem. Batteries—recharged by the solar cells—may provide power when the solar cells are in the dark.\n\nThermoelectric power supplies, employing radioisotopes as heat sources, have been used in some satellites. They are long-lived but expensive. Fuel cells, in which oxygen and hydrogen are combined to yield electricity, water, and heat, are used in United States manned spacecraft.\n\nThe onboard propulsion subsystem is variously employed to change the orbit of a satellite or the trajectory of a probe, to “keep station” with other objects, to remove a spacecraft from orbit, or to brake a probe for landing. It consists of one or more liquid- or solid-propellant rockets.\n\nThe environmental-control subsystem protects spacecraft components and astronauts. The crew of a manned spacecraft must have oxygen to breathe, plus food, water, and some means of disposing of human waste. Cabin temperature and pressure must be kept within certain limits, and some shielding from radiation must be provided. The less complex subsystem of an unmanned spacecraft is usually designed to control temperature and radiation, to which some electronic components are as sensitive as are humans. Temperature control may be achieved by reflective or absorptive external coatings or by such means as electric heaters.\n\nStresses and hazards of space flight\n\nThe people who travel into space successfully cross the functional borders because they are protected by the environmental-control subsystems of their spacecraft and space suits. They must, however, also overcome other stresses and hazards.\n\nThe first stress of spaceflight is acceleration, produced as the launch vehicle leaves the pad and rapidly builds up velocity. Within a few minutes after liftoff, for instance, the apparent weight of the astronauts of the U.S. Apollo missions increased from its usual value at Earth’s surface (1g) to seven or eight times that value (7 or 8g). Acceleration affects voluntary muscular activity, blood circulation, and visual acuity. Critical controls are therefore placed within easy reach of astronauts’ couches. These are so placed that the astronauts lie on their backs, facing in the direction of flight. In this “eyeballs in” position, the heart can supply the brain with blood at accelerations of up to 10g, preventing dimming or loss of consciousness.\n\nThe same supine position is adopted during reentry, when high deceleration (negative acceleration) is experienced. Lighting of twice the normal intensity is provided during high acceleration to counteract dimming of vision.\n\nVibration and noise—primarily produced by rocket engines, propellant sloshing, engine movements, wind gusts, and air turbulence as the spacecraft passes transonic speed—can cause nausea, choking sensations, difficulty in breathing and seeing, headaches, and deafness. Although these stresses largely cease after the powered stage of flight, spacecraft and space suits are designed to attenuate noise and cushion vibration.\n\nTemperature is also important. Humans can operate efficiently within only a narrow range of temperatures—about 50° to 80° F (10° to 27° C). Around 70° F (20° C) is ideal. Spacecraft must protect the astronauts and instruments from the extreme cold of space as well as the extreme heat generated upon reentry into the atmosphere. Temperature control is maintained both by powered heating-and-cooling systems and by such passive means as exterior coatings. Many spacecraft use ablative heat shields, which dissipate heat by charring and melting. They are not reusable, however, so they were not used on the space shuttles. Refractory coatings, which can withstand extreme temperatures directly without sustaining damage and which do not transmit heat to the craft’s interior, have been used in the shuttles and some other spacecraft.\n\nRadiation poses one of the greatest hazards to human beings in space. Exposure to high levels of radiation, including solar radiation, cosmic rays, X-rays, gamma rays, and many other types, can harm living cells. Excessive exposure may cause potentially fatal tumors and other serious health problems. Earth’s magnetic field shields human beings from much harmful radiation. Nearly all manned space missions have taken place in near-Earth orbit, in which the spacecraft were still protected by Earth’s magnetic field. The only exception has been the Apollo missions to the Moon, which were all of less than two weeks’ duration. The Apollo flights also were carefully timed to avoid exposure to anticipated high levels of solar radiation. The spacecraft designs currently in use do not afford enough protection against radiation for humans to travel safely on long interplanetary missions. Spacecraft and space suits do screen out some forms of harmful electromagnetic radiation, such as nearly all the ultraviolet light, to which the eye is especially sensitive but to which the iris does not respond. (See also radiation; radioactivity.)\n\nThe possibility of sudden decompression, exposing the occupants of a spacecraft to the effects of extremely low pressures, is a further hazard. Small leaks may be detected by sensors and, in some instances, repaired if necessary. Should repair be impossible, astronauts may have time to put on space suits. Sudden decompression—which could be caused, for example, by collision with a meteoroid—is probably not survivable by the occupants of present-day spacecraft. Fortunately, the chances that a spacecraft will strike an object large enough to cause explosive decompression are very small.\n\nThe effects of weightlessness, or the absence of virtually all sensation of acceleration, have not been fully evaluated. It is known, however, that weightlessness produces changes in human physiology. All space fliers have lost weight during their flights. Most space travelers regain the weight they lost within a day or two of their return to Earth.\n\nDisorientation, greatly feared before the first manned space flights, occurred only once during the first eight years of manned flight. Soviet cosmonaut Gherman Titov, the second person to orbit Earth, became severely disoriented and mildly nauseated. Some later space fliers—particularly those who had little previous training or experience—had the sensation of being suspended upside down.\n\nThe loss of bone mass has proved a more widespread problem. During weightlessness, astronauts lose bone density at an accelerated rate, and it is difficult for them to regain the lost mass after returning from space. On long missions, the bones may become porous and brittle, as in a person with osteoporosis. Astronauts also lose mass in the calf and thigh muscles that on Earth are used to counter the effects of gravity. In addition, blood that normally pools in the legs and feet shifts to the upper regions of a person’s body in the virtual absence of gravity. As a result, the face becomes puffy and the person experiences headaches and sinus congestion. As the body attempts to compensate, the total blood production decreases. For a few days after returning to Earth, many astronauts experience orthostatic hypotension, or low blood pressure when standing or sitting. This condition may cause light-headedness, dizziness, or fainting.\n\nThe limitations that weightlessness places upon physical activity are counteracted by various devices, including special handholds and footholds. Without such aids, a person attempting to turn a nut with a wrench would merely turn himself or herself, as he or she could offer no resistance to the force applied to the wrench. Compressed-gas jets have helped space travelers to maneuver outside their craft.\n\nThe unaccustomed environment of space may also produce psychological stresses. These are more difficult to define and evaluate—and probably more difficult to overcome—than are the physical stresses. Isolation could be an important psychological stress, but little is as yet known about the effects of long-term social, cultural, and perceptual isolation.\n\nIn the spaceflights conducted to date, isolation has produced no incapacitating mental stress—possibly because astronauts have been very busy and because they also have been in almost constant radio contact with Earth. Possible effects of isolation, however, include states of anxiety, indifference, exhilaration, and euphoria. Such reactions could be disastrous.\n\nSoviet manned spaceflights\n\nThe single-Earth-orbit flight of the Soviet Union’s Yury Gagarin aboard the Vostok 1 spacecraft, on April 12, 1961, is regarded as the first true spaceflight. Five more flights of Vostok spacecraft followed. The last four were conducted in pairs. The first woman to fly in space, Cosmonaut Valentina V. Tereshkova, piloted Vostok 6.\n\nTwo flights of multiperson spacecraft—modified Vostoks dubbed Voskhod 1 and 2—were made in 1964 and 1965. Voskhod 1 carried three men. Voskhod 2 carried two, one of whom—Cosmonaut Aleksey A. Leonov—became the first person to walk in space.\n\nThe more sophisticated Soyuz spacecraft was introduced in 1967. It was capable of docking. The flight of Soyuz 1 ended in tragedy when the craft’s parachute lines tangled after reentry and the capsule plummeted to Earth, killing the sole occupant, Cosmonaut Vladimir M. Komarov—the first person killed in spaceflight.\n\nThe soundness of the Soyuz spacecraft was proved in October 1968 when the manned Soyuz 3 completed two rendezvous maneuvers with the unmanned Soyuz 2. Rendezvous, docking, and crew exchange were accomplished on Soyuz 4 and 5 in January 1969. In October 1969 Soyuz 6, 7, and 8 were launched; the mission was the largest group flight ever. In June 1970 Soyuz 9 set an endurance record of nearly 18 days.\n\nIn early 1971 the Soviets launched the world’s first space station, Salyut 1. In June 1971 the Soyuz 11 crew boarded the station and stayed aboard for almost 24 days. The three men died during reentry, however; a leaky valve let the cabin air escape and asphyxiated the crew. As a result of the tragedy, Soyuz missions were suspended until 1973.\n\nIn 1973 a Salyut 2 space station was launched but went unmanned; the Salyut 3 station in 1974 had two human crews. Further Soyuz missions continued and included dockings with additional Salyuts.\n\nSalyuts 6 and 7 followed the same basic design as the earlier Salyuts but had improved systems and layouts. Salyut 6, launched in September 1977, was visited by 11 crews. With it the Soviets set and broke several endurance records. In addition, two upgraded Soyuz spacecraft were introduced—the unmanned Progress supply craft and the advanced two-person Soyuz T series. Salyut 7 was launched in April 1982. The crew of the Soyuz T-10 boarded the station and set a 237-day endurance record that ended in October 1984. They also went outside the spacecraft several times, in what is known as extravehicular activity (EVA), to improve and repair the station. One of the Salyut 7 guest crews included the second woman in space, Svetlana Y. Savitskaya, who became the first woman to walk in space.\n\nThe operations of Salyut 7 were largely ended in 1985. Soviet space activities focused on the new Mir space station, launched in February 1986 and equipped with a six-port docking section. The Mir was boarded in 1986, for 123 days, by the Soyuz T-15 crew, and was visited by an unmanned model of the new Soyuz TM spacecraft.\n\nIn February 1987 the Soyuz TM-2 crew boarded Mir for a new record duration in space. Although Cosmonaut Aleksandr Laveikin became ill and was replaced by Cosmonaut Aleksandr P. Aleksandrov, mission commander Yury V. Romanenko remained aboard the station for a record-breaking 326 days, returning to Earth in December 1987. Another record was set in 1994–95, when Cosmonaut Valery Polyakov spent 438 days aboard the station.\n\nIn 1997 the space station experienced a series of near-catastrophes, including a fire within the space station’s main module, a breakdown of the onboard oxygen-filtering system, and a collision with the Progress supply craft. The cargo ship tore a hole in one of the modules of the Mir station and damaged a solar panel. The damage to the spacecraft was extensive, forcing the crew to forgo a series of scheduled scientific experiments in an effort to preserve energy aboard the aging station, which had been designed to last only five years.\n\nThe events of 1997 created further uncomplimentary press for the beleaguered Russian space program. During the early years of spaceflight and the heyday of the Soviet Union, it was hailed as the most advanced space program in the world, but it fell on hard times after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Mir station, given its high-profile standing for more than a decade of service, seemed to many observers a symbol of the collapse of the Soviet space program. Finally, in late 1999, Mir was abandoned because of both a lack of funds to keep it operational and ongoing safety concerns. Its orbit deteriorated and it fell to Earth in March 2001.\n\nProject Apollo—to the Moon\n\nMercury and Gemini were a prelude to Project Apollo, the goal of which was manned exploration of the Moon. Development of the three-person, three-module Apollo spacecraft and its massive Saturn V launch vehicle began in the early 1960s.\n\nThe first manned test of the Apollo spacecraft was scheduled for 1967, but in January 1967, during a practice countdown, Grissom, White, and Roger B. Chaffee were killed when a flash fire swept the command module in which they sat. The first manned Apollo spacecraft—Apollo 7—was launched on October 11, 1968. Schirra, Donn F. Eisele, and Walter Cunningham were in Earth orbit for 11 days.\n\nIn Apollo 8, launched on December 21, 1968, Borman, Lovell, and William Anders became the first people to orbit the Moon, completing 10 lunar orbits. Apollo 11, launched on July 16, 1969, carried the first humans to land on the Moon. Command pilot Neil A. Armstrong and lunar module pilot Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., landed in the Mare Tranquillitatis on July 20 at 3:17 pm CDT. At 9:56 pm Armstrong stepped out of the lunar-landing vehicle Eagle and onto the Moon, uttering the now-famous words, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” He was followed by Aldrin. Michael Collins remained in the Moon-orbiting command module.\n\nApollo 12 launched on November 14, 1969, with a crew of Charles Conrad, Jr., Alan L. Bean, and Richard F. Gordon, Jr. Conrad and Bean made the second successful lunar landing on November 19. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970, but an explosion in an oxygen tank severely disabled the craft as it approached the Moon. Astronauts Lovell, Fred Haise, Jr., and John L. Swigert, Jr., moved to the lunar module during their return to Earth. Shepard and Edgar D. Mitchell made the third manned lunar landing on February 5, 1971, with Stuart A. Roosa orbiting in the Apollo 14 command module.\n\nThe fourth lunar landing was made on July 30, 1971, by the astronauts of Apollo 15. Using an electrically powered Lunar Roving Vehicle, the astronauts collected some 170 pounds (77 kilograms) of rocks and soil. The next landing took place on April 20, 1972, when crew members of Apollo 16 touched down in the rugged Descartes Highlands. They collected the first samples of lunar mountain soil and rocks.\n\nApollo 17, the last of the Apollo series, was launched on Deccember 7, 1972. Two astronauts spent four days on the surface of the Moon and set up experiments to study the Moon’s environment and interior.\n\nSkylab, a 100-ton space laboratory, was launched into Earth orbit on May 14, 1973. The first crew—Conrad, Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz, in a modified Apollo—docked with Skylab 2 on May 25. Their experiments included studies of the Sun, Earth resources, and the human body’s reaction to an extended stay in space. Their space endurance record of 28 days was topped by the Skylab 3 crew, whose mission lasted 59 days, and by the Skylab 4 mission, which lasted 84 days.\n\nSpace shuttle program\n\nDuring the 1970s the United States developed the space shuttle, the first reusable manned space vehicle. It combined three systems: a winged orbiter carrying crew and payload; an external tank with propellant for the three main rocket engines; and twin solid rocket boosters to lift the craft above the thickest part of the atmosphere. About two minutes after liftoff, the boosters detached and parachuted back to Earth, usually into the ocean, for recycling. By the time the orbiter reached about 99 percent of its orbital velocity, the propellants in the external tank had been used up, and the tank was jettisoned. Unlike the other two major shuttle components, the external tank was not reused; it disintegrated upon reentering the atmosphere. The orbiter made an unpowered descent at the end of the mission, gliding to a landing on a runway.\n\nThe program was formally called the Space Transportation System (STS). The fleet began with a total of four space shuttles; they were named for famous oceangoing ships: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. The Columbia flew four orbital test flights during the period from April 1981 to July 1982. The first flight (STS 1) was flown by astronauts John W. Young and Robert Crippen. The next three flights carried payloads to demonstrate the shuttle’s utility as a carrier. Beginning with the STS 5 in 1982, the shuttle carried operational payloads.\n\nThe shuttle Challenger made its first flight in April 1983. On its next ascent, in June, the crew included the first U.S. woman in space, Sally K. Ride. Columbia went up again in November carrying Spacelab 1, a highly complex laboratory module. In February 1984 astronauts Bruce McCandless II and Robert L. Stewart used gas-jet propulsion backpacks called manned maneuvering units (MMUs) to move and work in space and return to the shuttle Challenger while free of any lifeline to the spacecraft.\n\nOn January 28, 1986, after 24 successful launches, the shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff. Its seven crew members were killed, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, the winner of a nationwide teacher-in-space contest. The shuttle program was suspended until the exact cause of the explosion could be found. The United States returned to space in 1988 with the launching of the space shuttle Discovery in September. The mission reflected hundreds of design changes. In 1991 the United States replaced the shuttle Challenger with the new Endeavour.\n\nThe 113th space shuttle mission ended in tragedy. On February 1, 2003, while returning from a 16-day scientific mission, Columbia broke apart about 40 miles (60 kilometers) above north-central Texas. Its crew of seven, including Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli astronaut to travel in space, died in the accident. It was the 28th mission for Columbia, which had been the oldest shuttle in the fleet.\n\nThe U.S. space shuttle program ended in 2011, some 30 years after the initial shuttle launch. The final space shuttle mission, the 135th, launched on July 8, 2011. Atlantis made the final flight.\n\nSome major manned space flights\n\nThe Soviet Union had launched a space shuttle, Buran (Blizzard), on an unmanned mission in November 1988. It completed two orbits of Earth. Buran was remarkably similar to the United States shuttle except for the design of the launch vehicle."
