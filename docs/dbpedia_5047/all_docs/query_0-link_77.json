        "text": "Really enjoyed the play. The sound production was particularly good.\n\nBtw, a few ex-messageboarders are wondering (in another place) what the incidental music is, running at several places throughout the piece, but a good sample passage can be found starting at 15:50 in.\n\nRuss\n\n2.

The programme files hadn't been filed as yet and people were on leave when I made the initial enquiry so it wasn't as straightforward to get the music details as I had thought. Eleri, who worked on the play has very kindly sent me details of the music used in the show:\n\nFur Alina - Rabinovitch (Album ‘Avante Garde Music from the Ex-Soviet Union’)\n\nVladimir’s Blues - Max Richter (Album ‘Blue Notebooks’) - used at beginning of play\n\nInfra 1 - Max Richter (Album ‘Infra’)\n\nJourney 2 - Max Richter (Album ‘Infra’)\n\nJourney 3 - Max Richter (Album ‘Infra’)\n\nAn Ending (Ascent) - Brian Eno & Daniel Lanois (Album ‘Apollo Landscapes and Atmospheres’) - used at end."
