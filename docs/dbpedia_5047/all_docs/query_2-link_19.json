        "text": "German Titov was the second man to orbit the Earth. Fifty years ago on August 5, 1961, the youngest pilot and cosmonaut-trainee climbed on board the Vostok 2 spacecraft and spent 25.6 hours in space. Curator Cathy Lewis will talk about reveling the true Titov from under the veil of one of the most contested periods of the Cold War.\n\nThe Ask An Expert lecture series at the National Mall building is presented every Wednesday at noon. A Museum staff member talks to the public about the history, collection, or personalities related to a specific artifact or exhibition in the Museum."
