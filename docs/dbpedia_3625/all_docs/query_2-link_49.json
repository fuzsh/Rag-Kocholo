        "text": "Yet the new concept was not accepted as a whole. On the eve of the trial, the English and French texts of Article 6 c were harmonized with the Russian text, substituting a comma for the possibly mistaken semicolon between the phrases “during the war” and “or persecutions.” The comma tied the two parts of the law together so that a crime against humanity only occurred legally if it was committed “in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,” that is, in connection with aggressive war or conventional war crimes. This phrasing became known as the “war nexus.” It meant that pre-war Nazi actions against German civilians were not crimes against humanity by the language of the London Charter unless prosecutors could tie such acts to the primary crime investigated by the tribunal, Germany’s preparations for war.\n\nThe small adjustment in punctuation limited the reach of the new concept for those remaining uncomfortable with the primacy of international law over individual state sovereignty. It might have eased the minds of the Soviets, who had persecuted whole populations within the Soviet Union on political and ethnic grounds; the British and the French, who had committed violent acts within their empires (the French at Sétif in Algeria on V-E Day itself); and even the United States for its own racial discriminatory policies. As Jackson himself said, “we have some regrettable circumstances in our own country in which minorities are unfairly treated.” Historians argue today that the required war nexus existed in the case of Nazi Germany. Its pre-war persecution of political opponents and Jews was aimed at preventing a stab-in-the-back during wartime, which the Nazis believed responsible for Germany’s defeat in 1918. But this was not fully understood at Nuremberg.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal’s judgment in October 1946 ruled that pre-war Nazi actions against German Jews, German political opponents, and others, “revolting and horrible as many of these crimes were,” were not crimes against humanity as defined in the Charter and were thus not criminal in the eyes of the court. On the other hand, the tribunal ruled that the Germans had committed numerous crimes against humanity during the war. German war crimes against civilians being so extensive, ranging from the mass deportation of resistors to slave labor in concentration camps to mass starvation on the Eastern front to mass shooting in the USSR to mass gassing in Poland, the judgment did not parse between war crimes and crimes against humanity. It mixed them in a joint category, noting that “from the beginning of the war in 1939, War Crimes were committed on a vast scale, which were also Crimes against Humanity….”\n\nIt was up to subsequent tribunals to sharpen the concept of crimes against humanity. In December 1945, the four occupation powers in Germany issued Control Council Law No. 10. The law governed the judicial punishment of lower-level Nazi perpetrators. Crimes against humanity were included in the charter, but redefined. They defined additional specific crimes such as torture and rape. Crimes against humanity also stood on their own, separated from crimes against peace, as the war nexus was absent from the text. Article II c of Control Council Law No. 10 thus defined crimes against humanity as follows:\n\nAtrocities and offenses, including but not limited to murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, rape, or other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds whether or not in violation of the domestic laws of the country where perpetrated.\n\nAmerican Military Tribunals held 12 “subsequent” trials in Nuremberg between 1946 and 1949. Most of these American tribunals focused on a distinct professional segment of German society to demonstrate how that segment had diverged from western liberal traditions. The cases included a “Medical Case” against German physicians; a “Justice Case” against German jurists including judges and prosecutors; a “High Command Case” against senior German military officers; a “Ministries Case” against senior government officials; three separate cases against leading industrialists, and so on.\n\nMost of the 183 defendants in the subsequent Nuremberg trials were indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and many were convicted of both. Taken together, the tribunals managed to come to some consensus on what exact factors defined crimes against humanity. For instance, the law’s reference to civilian populations meant for the tribunals that crimes against humanity were not isolated incidents, but mass crimes, systematic in nature, committed as a measure of state. They were also committed not in occupied territory such as Poland or the Soviet Union, where even particularly severe mass crimes against civilians were still governed by the Hague Conventions as war crimes, but in friendly unoccupied regions such as Hungary, a German ally during the war. Thus Edmund Veesenmayer, the Reich plenipotentiary in Hungary in 1944, was found distinctly guilty of crimes against humanity for facilitating the deportation of Hungary’s Jews to Auschwitz.\n\nThe tribunals were split on the more daring aspects of the crimes against humanity statute. The judges were not innovative juridical scholars. They came from state courts in the United States rather than US federal courts, none had international law experience, and most were conservative concerning the ability of international statutes to trump national sovereignty. Thus, in considering pre-war Nazi crimes against humanity, most of the tribunals assumed the validity of the war nexus from the London Charter, even though Control Council Law No. 10 had deliberately omitted it, and even though US officials had proposed an amendment defining crimes against humanity as having taken place from the moment the Nazis assumed power in January 1933. The tribunal trying senior members of the Friedrich Flick coal and steel concern argued that the omission of the war nexus in Control Council Law No. 10 was surely accidental, and that consequently the tribunal had no jurisdiction over pre-war German actions. The tribunal trying Oswald Pohl and members of the SS Economic Administrative Main Office argued that domestic German laws, even those imposed by Nazi terror, were the business of the German people, not the tribunal itself.\n\nConsequently, the tribunals were also cautious with regard to Nazi crimes against German nationals. The Nuremberg Medical Case focused primarily on wartime medical experiments on foreign nationals in concentration camps. The tribunal touched on mass killings of the disabled under Nazi Germany’s euthanasia program mass killings of the disabled under Nazi Germany’s euthanasia program, as lead defendant Karl Brandt had headed the program, but it excluded euthanasia killings of German nationals as criminal. Rather its judgment pointed out that “almost at the outset of the program non-German nationals were selected for euthanasia.” The same tribunal tried members of the Race and Settlement Main Office and concluded that in the case of Richard Hildebrand, the Higher SS and Police Leader in Danzig-West Prussia, that “euthanasia, when carried out under state legislation against citizens of the state only, does not constitute a crime against humanity.”\n\nThe American tribunal for the “Justice Case” was more audacious, perhaps as it was forced to grapple with the validity of German law itself. Though the defendants were not tried for their pre-war activities, they were tried for wartime transgressions against “any civilian population,” including German Jews. The court also noted that many of the defendants’ transgressions–ranging from approving seizure of Jewish property to selective prosecution of Jews to the denial of civil status to Jews in German courts, to the punishment of sexual crimes having to do with racial mixing–were based on laws that appeared between 1933 and 1939 which the tribunal deemed arbitrary.\n\nThe tribunal thus had no patience with the defense arguments that German law legitimized the defendants’ actions, or that crimes against humanity was a law unjustly applied after the fact–ex post facto. “The Nuremberg Tribunals,” read the judgment, “are not enforcing German law…. On the contrary, the jurisdiction of this tribunal rests on international authority.” The defendants were proven to be willing political advocates of extra-Nazi programs. They acted based on ideology rather than law, confident that they would never be held to account.\n\nAmerican jurists in occupied Germany developed international law with the concept of crimes against humanity, then grappled with its meaning, refining it within an emerging post-war world. It was up to the international community to develop the concept further.\n\nIn December 1946, the UN General Assembly affirmed the legal principles of the London Charter and stated its intention to incorporate them into an international criminal code. The Cold War slowed this process due to differences over how certain crimes, from aggressive war to crimes against humanity itself, were to be defined. In 1996, owing to the end of the Cold War and the mass killings of civilians in Yugoslavia and Rwanda civil conflicts, the UN revisited the Nuremberg principles when creating ad hoc tribunals to adjudicate mass killings in those countries and in developing the 1998 Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court, which re-defines crimes against humanity.\n\nThe Rome Statute, adhered to by 123 countries, expands the list of individual crimes against humanity to include a variety of sexual crimes as well as “Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.” Critical too, however, is this. As contemporary mass atrocities have occurred within states rather than between them, the nexus connecting crimes against humanity to international war has been removed once and for all. In theory and practice, state officials are responsible to the international community for the treatment of their own citizens.\n\nMeet the Author\n\nNorman JW Goda is the Norman and Irma Braman Professor of Holocaust Studies at the University of Florida.
