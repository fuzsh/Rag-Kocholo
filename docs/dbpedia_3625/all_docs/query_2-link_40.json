        "text": "In 2018, Turkey instituted a presidential system of government that makes the president the chief national authority and grants the office sweeping executive powers. The president is directly elected for up to two five-year terms but is eligible to run for a third term in the event of early elections. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan served as prime minister from 2003 to 2014, and as president since then. Because Erdoğan’s first term ended early due to the 2017 referendum, he is eligible to run for a third term in 2023, which, if secured, would last until 2028.\n\nTurkey’s 2018 general elections were held under a state of emergency that had been in place since a 2016 coup attempt. Erdoğan, who leads the AKP, won the presidential race with 52.6 percent of the vote in the first round. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) criticized the election, reporting that electoral regulators often deferred to the ruling AKP, that state-run media favored the AKP in its coverage, and that Erdoğan repeatedly accused legitimate political opponents of supporting terrorism during the campaign.\n\nThe unicameral Grand National Assembly has 600 seats. Lawmakers are elected to five-year terms by proportional representation. Parties need at least 7 percent of the national vote to join the parliament as of 2022.\n\nIn the 2018 elections, the AKP joined the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) to form the People’s Alliance, which won 53 percent of the vote, amounting to 344 seats. The opposition Nation’s Alliance, led by the CHP and including the İyi Party (IP) and two smaller parties, won 34 percent of the vote and took 189 seats. The pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP) won 11 percent of the vote, gaining 67 seats.\n\nThe OSCE described the 2018 elections as marred by the AKP’s misuse of state resources to gain an electoral advantage and noted that the opposition claimed that last-minute changes to electoral laws and failure to follow standard procedures for the selection of polling locations benefitted the ruling party. Reports of irregularities such as proxy voting were prevalent in the southeast, the HDP’s stronghold.\n\nThe judges of the Supreme Electoral Council (YSK), who oversee all voting procedures, are appointed by AKP-dominated judicial bodies and often defer to the AKP in their decisions.\n\nA new electoral law passed in March 2022 lowered the parliamentary entry threshold from 10 percent to 7 percent and changed the way parliamentary seats are distributed among party alliances. Opposition parties criticized the threshold changes as an attempt by the AKP to scuttle a broad opposition alliance, saying the lower threshold was designed to encourage smaller parties to break from a unified opposition bloc. The new law modified procedures for the selection of judges who oversee elections and control vote-counting process. Previously, the top-ranking judge in a district would select the judges responsible for any challenges to the vote count; the new law prescribes that those judges be selected in a draw, making it more likely that AKP-aligned judges appointed in recent years would oversee the processes. The law also exempted the president from rules that ban ministers from using state resources for their campaigns.\n\nTurkey maintains a multiparty system, with five major parties in the parliament. Parties are required to organize chapters and hold congresses in at least half of Turkey’s provinces no later than six months before an election in order to participate.\n\nOpposition leaders face politically motivated prosecutions and other harassment that affects their parties’ ability to function. Members of the HDP have faced regular such prosecutions since 2015, after a peace process with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) collapsed and the government accused the pro-Kurdish HDP of serving as a proxy for the PKK. (The PKK is now designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, as well as by the United States and European Union [EU]). The HDP’s offices are regularly raided by police and attacked by far-right mobs.\n\nOther opposition leaders also face politically motivated prosecutions and violent attacks. In December 2022, the mayor of Istanbul—Ekrem İmamoğlu of the CHP, widely considered a potential challenger to Erdoğan—was convicted of insulting state institutions and barred from politics, in a case widely considered to be politically motivated. Members of İmamoğlu’s staff remain under investigation over alleged links to the PKK and other groups designated as terrorist organizations. In May 2022, an appeals court upheld the prison sentence of the CHP’s Istanbul chair, Canan Kaftancioğlu, who was convicted in 2019 of insulting the president. Kaftancioğlu, who assisted with İmamoğlu’s 2019 mayoral campaign, was also banned from running for office. Former HDP cochair Selahattin Demirtaş remains in prison, after being detained in 2016 for “terrorist propaganda.” In 2020, the ECHR had ruled that his detention was politically motivated and ordered his release.\n\nMetin Gürcan, a founding member of the opposition Democracy and Progress Party (DEVA) and a political commentator, was jailed in November 2021 on espionage charges in connection with his research. He later said the research in question involved reports he had been preparing for diplomatic missions of Italy and Spain, and that the information within was compiled from open sources. He was released in May 2022 but rearrested two days later after his release was challenged in court; he faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.\n\nPolitical rights are experienced unevenly. Critics charge that the AKP favors Sunni Muslims, pointing to an overhaul of the education system that favored Islamic education in secular schools and promoted the rise of religious schools in the 2010s. The AKP also expanded the Directorate of Religious Affairs, using this institution as a channel for political patronage. Among other functions, the party uses the directorate to deliver government-friendly sermons in mosques in Turkey, as well as in countries where the Turkish diaspora is present.\n\nWhile members of Turkey’s non-Sunni Alevi community and non-Muslim citizens hold seats in the parliament, the government’s crackdown on opposition parties where they are concentrated has seriously harmed their political rights and electoral opportunities. While the Kurds, Turkey’s largest ethnic minority, are represented in politics, pro-Kurdish parties face regular harassment by the government via hate speech, politically motivated prosecutions, and disinformation in progovernment media.\n\nWomen and LGBT+ individuals remain underrepresented in politics and in leadership positions in government. Women occupy 104 parliamentary seats, or 17 percent of the assembly. A handful of LGBT+ candidates have run for office, but LGBT+ people remain politically marginalized, in part because the government uses public morality laws to restrict advocacy for LGBT+ rights.\n\nWhile some refugees in Turkey, including nearly 4 million Syrians, have gained citizenship in recent years, there is no clear path for gaining citizenship status. Anti-immigrant sentiment among the public is high, and politicians who are openly discriminatory toward refugees have entered the political scene.\n\nMost Turkish media networks are owned by businesses that depend on public tenders or have close ties to President Erdoğan. Mainstream media reflect government positions and often carry identical headlines. Although independent outlets exist, they face tremendous political pressure and are routinely targeted for prosecution. Media outlets are often censored, fined, or shut down, and journalists are detained regularly. Business elites with close ties to Erdoğan have been accused of bribing journalists and orchestrating negative press against the opposition.\n\nThe most prominent journalist arrested in 2022 was Sedef Kabaş, who was detained in January for criticizing President Erdoğan on live television and was sentenced in March to two years and four months in prison. Journalists were detained at various protests throughout the year. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Turkey was the world’s fourth-largest jailer of journalists in 2022, with 40 journalists in prison at the year’s end; the group noted that Turkish authorities had arrested 25 Kurdish journalists in the second half of 2022, all of whom were jailed and charged with terrorism over alleged links to the PKK. Reporters have faced physical attacks, notably those who cover politics, corruption, or crime.\n\nThe members of Turkey’s state broadcast regulator, the High Council for Broadcasting (RTÜK), are appointed by the AKP-controlled parliament. The RTÜK continued to fine independent networks that critiqued the government in 2022, issuing 54 against five television networks all of which are independent or opposition-aligned. Since 2019, RTÜK has required international online video producers to obtain licenses in order to operate in Turkey. In February 2022, RTÜK warned Euronews, Voice of America, and Deutsche Welle that they were in violation of the rule, and blocked access to the latter two in June after they refused to comply.\n\nAuthorities also continue to block and censor content on Turkish media. After a deadly bomb attack in Istanbul in November 2022, RTÜK issued a media ban on the topic that lasted 10 hours. In October, the AKP-led majority approved a law that introduced a prison sentence of up to three years for individuals deemed to promote false information on social media. Press freedom advocates and the opposition heavily criticized the law’s vague language and warned that it could be used as a tool to further silence independent journalists. In December, a court ordered the first arrest under the law, placing a Kurdish journalist in pretrial detention for publishing a post on Twitter about the alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl by police officers and soldiers. The journalist was released after his lawyer filed an objection, though the case remained pending at year’s end.\n\nSince 2020, the government has forced major social media companies, including Facebook and YouTube, to maintain offices in the country and comply with government demands to take down content. Companies that refused to comply have received hefty fines and advertising bans.\n\nAuthorities routinely ban gatherings organized by government critics, while progovernment rallies are allowed and enjoy police protection. Police frequently use force to break up peaceful protests. In 2022, security forces used tear gas, pepper spray, and other violent tactics to disperse demonstrators at May Day protests, Istanbul and Ankara LGBT+ pride parades, Women’s Day celebrations, marches against gender-based violence (GBV), protests against price hikes and soaring inflation, and other major gatherings. Police arrested dozens of protesters at the Ankara pride parade, and more than 200 people at the Istanbul pride parade.\n\nThe police routinely break up the weekly vigils and commemorations organized by the Saturday Mothers, a group that protests forced disappearances associated with a 1980 coup d’état, and arrest members of the group, most of whom are elderly women. In June 2022, the police took 16 human rights defenders at the group’s 900th vigil into custody. A trial against 46 demonstrators who attended the 700th Saturday Mothers vigil in 2018 is ongoing.\n\nAuthorities cracked down on music festivals, a staple of cultural life for Turkish youth, in 2022. Governors and mayors in multiple provinces canceled or banned at least 12 music festivals and concerts between May and August, using various pretexts including environmental concerns. Festival organizers argued that they had all the necessary permits and saw no grounds for the cancelations.\n\nThe government frequently targets independent civil society groups. Since 2016, it has shut down more than 1,500 foundations and associations. Leaders of remaining NGOs face harassment, arrests, and prosecutions. A 2020 law subjects NGOs to yearly audits and gives the Interior Ministry the power to appoint trustees to the boards of NGOs facing criminal investigation. In 2021, the government froze the assets of 770 NGOs on the spurious grounds of terrorism financing.\n\nTurkey’s politicized judiciary has convicted several prominent human rights activists, including the former head of Amnesty International Turkey, on bogus terrorism charges in an apparent effort to intimidate civil society actors and stifle human rights advocacy. In March 2022, police raided the homes of and detained 24 women’s rights defenders in the Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir. Of them, 11 were arrested on terrorism charges two days later, and the entire episode prompted condemnation from Turkish human rights groups.\n\nIn April, an Istanbul court convicted prominent philanthropist Osman Kavala and seven other celebrated civil society leaders of conspiring to overthrow the government. Kavala was sentenced to life in prison, while the other defendants received 18-year sentences. The events drew sharp criticism from international and domestic rights groups, and the ECHR in July ruled that Turkey had violated its previous, 2019 ruling calling for Kavala’s release.\n\nAlso in April, a court upheld a prison sentence for human rights lawyer and co-chair of the Human Rights Association (İHD), Eren Keskin, who since 2016 has faced multiple charges relating to terrorism membership and insulting the government. The İHD’s other co-chair, Öztürk Türkdoğan, was acquitted that month of the same charge, but still faces two additional criminal proceedings.\n\nJudicial independence has been severely compromised, as thousands of judges and prosecutors have been replaced with government loyalists since 2016. Under the presidential system that took effect in 2018, members of Turkey’s Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSK), which oversees judicial appointments and disciplinary measures, are appointed by the parliament and the president rather than by members of the judiciary. As a result, prosecutors and judges often toe the government line. Judges who rule against the government’s wishes have been removed and replaced, while those who convict Erdoğan’s critics have been promoted.\n\nPolitically motivated prosecutions target politicians, journalists, academics, and students. In May 2022, the Court of Cassation upheld three sentences against the CHP’s Istanbul chair, Canan Kaftancioğlu, for “insulting a public official,” “insulting the president,” and “degrading the state.” The Constitutional Court has shown some independence since 2019 but is not free from political influence and often delivers rulings in line with AKP interests.\n\nSevere violations of due process in the judicial system persist. Defendants are often held in lengthy pretrial detention that can last up to seven years. Prosecutors often wait months before unveiling charges and produce lengthy accounts that often lack evidence. In many cases, lawyers defending people accused of terrorism face arrest themselves. Lower courts often defy rulings by higher courts that they are legally bound to implement.\n\nThe case against Turkish philanthropist Osman Kavala has been riddled with due process violations. Accused of attempting to overthrow the government in 2017, Kavala was held in pretrial detention for more than a year before he saw his indictment. He has endured two trials since 2019, wherein judges who ordered his release were replaced between hearings without explanation, alongside other procedural anomalies. After he was exonerated in 2020, Kavala was immediately rearrested under different charges. In April 2022, judges in the second trial sentenced him to life in prison. The ECHR in July published a ruling that Turkey had violated its previous, 2019 ruling calling for Kavala’s release.\n\nAlthough Turkey’s laws guarantee equal treatment of all citizens, religious, ethnic, and sexual and gender minorities suffer varying degrees of discrimination. Alevis and non-Muslims face systemic discrimination in schools and the public sector. The government’s war with the PKK is used to justify discriminatory measures against Kurdish citizens, including the prohibition of Kurdish festivals. Kurdish schools and cultural organizations, many of which had opened while peace talks were taking place, have been investigated or shut down since 2015.\n\nAlthough women make up a growing part of the workforce, gender inequality is a pressing issue. While same-sex relations are not legally prohibited, LGBT+ people face widespread discrimination, police harassment, and violence. Laws do not protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and LGBT+ people are banned from serving in the military. Top state officials frequently engage in homophobic hate speech; President Erdoğan in 2020 defended Turkey’s head of religious affairs after he linked homosexuality to disease and societal decay. The government continues to censor LGBT+ content in the media, including on Netflix.\n\nTurkey hosts more than 4 million refugees and migrants, most of them from Syria, according to the government. Refugees have no clear path to citizenship and their movement is restricted to their provinces of registration, outside of which they not allowed to live or work. Most refugee children lack access to education, and most adults lack employment permits. Popular resentment against refugees and discriminatory rhetoric against refugees among politicians has been increasing, and in 2022 and many refugee homes and businesses faced violent mob attacks. Amid this political atmosphere, residency permits for refugees and migrants have become increasingly difficult to obtain and to renew. Reports also point to a growing number of deportations. Nearly 60,000 Syrian refugees relocated from Turkey to Turkish-controlled zones in Syria in 2022. While the Turkish government calls these returns “voluntary,” international NGOs have disputed the nature of the relocations, calling them forced deportations. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), Turkish authorities arbitrarily arrested and deported hundreds of male Syrian refugees in 2022."
