        "text": "Turkey maintains a multiparty system. Parties are required to organize chapters and hold congresses in at least half of Turkey’s provinces no later than six months before an election in order to participate.\n\nOpposition leaders face politically motivated prosecutions, violent attacks, and other harassment that affects their parties’ ability to function. Throughout the 2023 election period, opposition leaders from the CHP and IP faced assassination threats while their offices, buses, and campaign rallies suffered violent attacks. The parties complained that state security forces, including the police, failed to provide them with adequate protection.\n\nOpposition party leaders also battled judicial decisions aimed at undermining their political activity. The CHP’s most popular leader, Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, was convicted of insulting state institutions in December 2022, six months ahead of the election. This verdict effectively prevented the CHP from naming İmamoğlu its presidential candidate. In May 2022, another court upheld the prison sentence of the CHP’s Istanbul chair Canan Kaftancioğlu, who was convicted in 2019 for insulting the president.\n\nTurkey’s opposition parties also face threats of closure. For years, prosecutors have launched criminal investigations into members of the pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) for having alleged links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey as well as the United States and European Union (EU), and put several HDP leaders—including its former cochair Selahattin Demirtas—in prison. In 2021, Turkey’s Constitutional Court took up a case to ban the HDP altogether, which remained underway in 2023. The potential ban significantly impaired the HDP’s ability to campaign and enter elections, forcing the party to regroup under the YSP in order to compete in the May 2023 elections.\n\nMost Turkish media networks are owned by businesses that depend on public tenders or have close ties to President Erdoğan. Mainstream media reflect government positions and often carry identical headlines. Although independent outlets exist, they face tremendous political pressure and are routinely targeted for prosecution. Media outlets are often censored, fined, or shut down, and journalists are detained regularly. Business elites with close ties to Erdoğan have been accused of bribing journalists and orchestrating negative press against the opposition. Reporters have also faced physical attacks, notably those who cover politics, corruption, or crime.\n\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Turkey was the world’s fourth most prolific jailer of journalists in 2022, with 40 journalists in prison. Turkish authorities detained and arrested scores of journalists in 2023. At least four journalists were detained or faced criminal charges in February due to their critical coverage of the government’s earthquake rescue efforts. Authorities detained Kurdish journalists in late April over alleged links to the PKK, and the CPJ describing the detentions as an effort to silence dissent ahead of elections. Journalists were also detained at various protests throughout the year.\n\nJournalists who critically reported on individuals close to Erdoğan were targeted by authorities or saw access to their work restricted in 2023. In June, a Turkish court blocked access to 93 online news articles that were based on a Reuters story on the alleged role of Erdoğan’s son in an international bribery scheme. That same month, another court gave prison sentences to two journalists who reported on bribery allegations against Erdoğan’s former lawyer. Investigative reporter Baris Pehlivan, who wrote a book about former interior minister Soylu’s alleged relationship with organized crime in 2020, has been jailed five times since the book’s publication, most recently in August 2023.\n\nThe members of Turkey’s state broadcast regulator, the High Council for Broadcasting (RTÜK), are appointed by the AKP-controlled parliament. The RTÜK continued to fine independent networks that critiqued the government in 2023, issuing 76 fines to 10 television networks, a majority of which are independent or opposition-aligned. Notably, the RTÜK fined three opposition-aligned television channels in March for covering earthquake rescue efforts or opposition criticisms of the government’s disaster response. In June, just two days after the presidential election runoff, the RTÜK launched investigations into the same three channels as well as three others for “insulting the public” through their election coverage. Since 2019, the RTÜK has required international online video producers to obtain licenses in order to operate in Turkey, and in 2022 it blocked access to Voice of America and Deutsche Welle for refusing to comply with the regulation.\n\nAuthorities block and censor content on Turkish social media. A law approved in 2022 introduced a prison sentence of up to three years for individuals deemed to promote false information on social media. Press freedom advocates and the opposition heavily criticized the law’s vague language and warned that it could be used as a tool to further silence independent journalists. In February 2023, a court sentenced Kurdish journalist Sinan Aygül to 10 months in prison for publishing a post on X about the alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl by police officers and soldiers. In July, journalist Fırat Can Arslan was arrested for posts he made on social media, and four other journalists were arrested for sharing his posts.\n\nSince 2020, the government has forced major social media companies, including Facebook and YouTube, to maintain offices in the country and comply with government demands to take down content. Companies that refused to comply have received hefty fines and advertising bans. Ahead of the 2023 elections, Turkish courts ordered X to take down dozens of accounts and hundreds of posts by those accounts. Although X said that it filed objections to those requests, the company banned access to four accounts and 409 posts after Turkish authorities threatened to throttle access to X during the elections.\n\nTurkey’s pro-opposition media also suffer from indirect censorship efforts like cyberattacks. On election day in May, three popular pro-opposition outlets in Turkey were targeted by cyberattacks that made their websites inaccessible to the public.\n\nWhile citizens continue to voice their opinions openly in private, many exercise caution about what they say publicly. Ordinary people have faced criminal prosecution for incitement or insulting the president, as have public figures.\n\nThe government heavily monitors and censors the Turkish internet, contributing to self-censorship. The vaguely written disinformation law that took effect in October 2022 significantly expanded the scope of activities on social media deemed criminal and introduced a three-year maximum prison sentence.\n\nIn February 2023, authorities used this disinformation law to detain 78 people for their social media posts about the earthquake, accusing them of creating “fear and panic” among the public with their “provocative” posts criticizing the government’s disaster response. Authorities noted that they had identified 613 social media users who made provocative posts and launched legal proceedings against 293 of them. The government also restricted access to X and other social platforms for eight hours following the earthquake, which significantly compromised citizens’ aid and recovery efforts. The Turkish government has pursued similar restrictions during other moments of national significance, including by pressuring Turkey’s internet service providers to restrict access to Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, X, and some Telegram servers in the aftermath of a deadly bomb attack in Istanbul in 2022.\n\nThe Turkish government’s efforts to target individuals for their social media posts extends to foreign citizens and even foreign officials. In August 2023, Turkish authorities detained a German lawmaker for several hours over social media posts she made in 2019, which a Turkish prosecutor characterized as spreading terrorism propaganda.\n\nAuthorities routinely ban gatherings organized by government critics, while progovernment rallies are allowed and enjoy police protection. Police frequently use force to break up peaceful protests. In recent years, security forces have used tear gas, pepper spray, and other violent tactics to disperse demonstrators at May Day protests; Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir LGBT+ pride parades; Women’s Day celebrations; marches against gender-based violence; protests against price hikes and soaring inflation; and other major gatherings. In June 2023, police arrested at least 93 people at the Istanbul pride parade, which activists held despite an official government ban. In Izmir, police banned a pride picnic organized by students at Ege University and violently intervened when students attempted to protest in front of the Izmir Bar Association, spraying tear gas indiscriminately. In Ankara, police detained students who were planning to hold pride demonstrations on campus at the Middle East Technical University (ODTU).\n\nParticipating in pride parades or LGBT+ events is particularly dangerous for people in Turkey who are not citizens. Five foreigners, including an Iranian refugee, were detained at the Istanbul pride parade in June 2023 and faced deportation. If deported, the Iranian refugee would potentially face a death sentence in Iran.\n\nThe police routinely break up the weekly vigils and commemorations organized by the Saturday Mothers and arrest its members. The group protests forced disappearances associated with a 1980 coup d’état, and most of its members are elderly women. In February 2023, the Constitutional Court ruled that a district governor’s decision to ban the 700th Saturday Mothers vigil in Istanbul in 2018 violated the activists’ constitutional right to protest. Despite this ruling, police detained 50 people during the group’s weekly vigil in July.\n\nSince 2022, authorities have cracked down on art and music festivals, a staple of cultural life for Turkish youth. The trend appeared to continue into 2023, with music festivals being canceled, including because of arbitrary bans on alcohol and camping. In October, Turkey’s most prestigious film festival was also canceled following government efforts to censor a political documentary."
