They said that Russia’s military escalation in Ukraine will lead to more suffering worldwide and must be reversed and that with each passing day, UN teams on the ground were facing “new dimensions to the emergency.”\n\nOn 30 October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed deep concern at Russia’s decision to suspend its involvement in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal set up to reintroduce vital food and fertilizer exports from Ukraine to the rest of the world.\n\nOn 14 November, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that calls for Russia to pay war reparations to Ukraine, as ambassadors met to resume their emergency special session devoted to the conflict.

This community has been heavily affected by months of hostilities and the 4,500 people who remain there depend on humanitarian aid to meet their most needs. The UN said that it aims to increase the number of inter-agency convoys providing aid to parts of Ukraine “close to the frontlines”, in support of work being carried out by local organisations and volunteers. Also, the first UN aid convoy reached the vicinity of the battered eastern Ukrainian city of Soledar.\n\nOn 2 February, two UN aid convoys have reached communities with acute needs near the contact line in Ukraine’s war-shattered east, a five-lorry inter agency convoy reached the town of Hulyaipole in the Zaporizhia region.\n\nOn 6 February, Martin Griffiths, the Emergency Relief Coordinator warned the Security Council that efforts must improve to reach nearly 18 million in need in war-torn Ukraine, since Russia’s full-scale invasion last year. Nearly 40 per cent of Ukraine’s population needs assistance, against a backdrop of more than 7,000 civilian deaths and widespread devastation.\n\nOn 15 February, almost a year since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UN appealed for $5.6 billion to help millions of people affected inside the war-torn country and beyond.\n\nUN humanitarians have reached nearly two million Ukrainians whose lives have been impacted by Russia’s ongoing invasion with multi-purpose cash assistance in just the first three months of 2023.\n\nOn 15 May, UN Humanitarian Affairs chief, Martin Griffiths, briefed the Security Council and called for aid workers to be allowed full access, in line with international law.

The United Nations needs safe and unhindered access to all areas affected by the Russian military offensive. There is an urgent need to establish a safe passage for life-saving medical supplies and health personnel.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has strongly condemned acts of violence against health centres, which are violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

The Committee reported that people with disabilities trapped in the Russian control zones in Ukraine are reportedly being used as “human shields” by the Russian Federation armed forces.\n\nA new UN report developed by gender agency UN Women and the Secretary-General’s Global Crisis Response Group, describes how the war has widened gender gaps in hunger, education and poverty, and has also increased gender-based violence.\n\nOn 23 September, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine told the Human Rights Council that based on the evidence gathered by the Commission, it had concluded that war crimes have been committed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine. There are reasonable grounds to believe “an array” of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law have been committed.\n\nOn 18 October, the Independent Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, presented its first detailed written report to the UN General Assembly.

This is the fastest forced population movement since the Second World War.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, every second that passes, a Ukrainian child becomes a refugee.\n\nIt is important that solidarity with the victims of this war be extended without any discrimination. All people, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or culture, must enjoy the same treatment and protection.\n\nAs of 8 March, UN agencies were present in each of the country’s 24 oblasts and had provided life-saving humanitarian assistance to 2.1 million people in Ukraine.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) plans to reach 4.8 million conflict-affected people through cash transfers and in-kind food distributions.\n\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that Ukraine could “freefall into poverty“.\n\nAccording to a recent IOM survey, around 28 per cent of the estimated 6.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine fled from the Kharkiv Region.\n\nOn 23 September UN refugee agency, UNHCR, published a new survey “Lives on Hold: Intentions and Perspectives of Refugees from Ukraine.” It is based on 4,800 responses from people who have fled the brutal war in their homeland and are now living in countries in Europe and beyond.

Ms. Brown expressed her sympathy to the families of “over 1,500 children killed and injured in Ukraine” since Russia’s full-scale invasion began 15 months ago. She added that the UN continued to follow closely reports of Ukrainian children being forcibly sent to Russia\n\nAs of January 2024, an estimated 6.3 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine, with 94% of them hosted in European countries—representing 5.9 million refugees. Within Ukraine, displacement trends are complex. An estimated 3.7 million people are internally displaced, and 4.6 million people returned to their area of habitual residence following a period of displacement due to the war.\n\n<< Back to Top >>\n\nNuclear facilities & Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\nNuclear power plants should never be targeted by military operations. Military operations around nuclear sites and other critical civilian infrastructure are unacceptable, highly irresponsible and contrary to international humanitarian law.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is closely monitoring the situation.\n\n“Military operations around nuclear sites and other critical civilian infrastructure are not only unacceptable but also highly irresponsible,” Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN’s chief of political affairs, told the fifteen-member Council.\n\nThe IAEA’s presence at the Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine would allow the organization to carry out important technical activities in nuclear safety, security and safeguards and at the same time provide a stabilizing influence, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the UN Security Council on 11 August.\n\nOn 6 September 2022, in his briefing to the Security Council, UN Secretary-General António Guterres underlined the need to de-escalate the situation around the embattled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine.\n\nOn 9 September, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned that shelling in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar is putting the embattled Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) at risk.\n\n12 September: IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi reiterated his call for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine.

The IAEA is closely monitoring for any potential impact on nuclear safety and security (6 May).\n\nOn 12 May, IAEA DG Rafael Grossi said Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant has enough essential staff for its current reduced level of operations, but the continued lack of maintenance personnel on-site could negatively impact nuclear safety and security.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continues to warn of the potential nuclear threat in the Ukraine conflict amid rising tensions surrounding the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). (19 May)\n\nIAEA Experts need access to a location near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant to clarify the reason for a significant discrepancy between different measurements of the height of the reservoir that is supplying water to cool the facility’s six reactors and spent fuel storage, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi (11 June).\n\nTargeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and threats of use of nuclear weapons, severely undermines trust “within and in our institution”, the President of the UN General Assembly said on 18 July.\n\n<< Back to Top >>\n\nFood security\n\nAccording to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the war in Ukraine is jeopardizing global grain supplies and food security.\n\nFAO has warned that disruptions to production, supply and delivery chains for grains and oilseeds, and restrictions on Exports from Russia, will have a significant impact on food security. An additional 8 to 13 million people could suffer from undernutrition worldwide if food exports from Ukraine and Russia were permanently prevented by the war.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General has warned of a “hurricane of famine” and a “collapse of the global food system”.\n\nMore than three months into the war in Ukraine, the Secretary-General has warned that the war in Ukraine threatens to unleash an unprecedented wave of hunger and destitution, leaving social and economic chaos in its wake. People around the world are facing a cost-of-living crisis not seen in more than a generation.\n\nOn 13 July, Secretary-General António Guterres said that a “critical step forward” had been taken to allow the “safe and secure export” of millions of tonnes of grain via the Black Sea. The UN chief described progress between Russia and Ukraine on allowing the resumption of grain exports during UN-brokered talks in Türkiye, as a “ray of hope to ease human suffering and alleviate hunger around the world.”\n\nThe first vessel transporting Ukrainian wheat grain to support humanitarian operations run by the World Food Programme (WFP) has left the port of Yuzhny, also known as Pivdennyi, the UN agency reported on 16 August.\n\nOn 27 August, more than one million tonnes of grain and food items exported under Black Sea deal.\n\nAs of 14 September, 2.7 million tons of grain and other foodstuffs have been shipped from Ukraine’s ports under the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\n\nOn 2 November, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed Russia’s decision to end suspension from Ukraine grain deal.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has conducted a nation-wide rural household survey in Ukraine, targeting 5,230 rural households across the country. The analysis is part of a series of complementary assessments that aim at providing a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the war on Ukraine’s agriculture sector and identifying possible programming and policy responses.\n\nOne year since Russia invaded Ukraine, UN food security experts are more concerned than ever about the global cost of living crisis that the war has fuelled.\n\n11 May: the UN-brokered Black Sea Initiative, aimed at ensuring the flow of grain, foodstuffs and fertilizer amid global shortages exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, has now allowed the safe export of more than 30 million tonnes, since it first began in July last year.\n\n17 July: The UN Secretary-General expressed his deep regrets about the decision by the Russian Federation to terminate the implementation of the Black Sea Initiative – including the withdrawal of Russian security guarantees for navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.\n\nRussia’s bombardment of Ukrainian ports along the Black Sea could have far-reaching impacts on global food security, UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo said on Friday 21 July in a briefing to the Security Council.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nHow to Donate\n\nUNRIC Info Point & Library Backgrounder on Ukraine\n\nUkraine In Focus page (links to agency sites)\n\nBlack Sea Grain Initiative Joint Coordination Centre\n\nMore data on vessel movements and inspections can be found here.\n\nDonate to the United Nations or its agencies that are dedicated to respond to humanitarian needs in Ukraine\n\nMore information on the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.\n\nUN: Global Crisis Response Group\n\nOCHA: Ukraine Humanitarian Situation Report\n\nRelief Web: Sit Reps\n\nUNHCR Help Portal: https://help.unhcr.org/\n\nNew inclusive website provides Ukrainians with critical information on surviving the war [EN/UK]\n\nEU and UNDP support launch of psychological assistance hotline for Ukrainians affected by war\n\nIOM Hotlines (ГАРЯЧІ ЛІНІЇ МОМ) for Persons Affected by the War in Ukraine: https://www.iom.int/iom-hotlines-garyachi-linii-mom-persons-affected-war-ukraine\n\nContact for IOM Offices in various countries: https://www.iom.int/where-we-work\n\nUNESCO:\n\nGlobal Response Page: In the Face of War, a Year of Action in Ukraine\n\nDamages and Victims | Damaged cultural sites in Ukraine verified by UNESCO\n\nA.
