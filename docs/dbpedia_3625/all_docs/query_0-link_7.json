In judging of our first annual repoit, we desire our readers to understand that it was made up without legislative authority to enforce answers to circulars asking information, and without any appropriation to pay deputies for canvassing the counties. We had, like the Israelites of old, to make brick without straw. You, therefore, ought not to expect our statistics to be entirely from original sources. Like the busy bee, we have collected from every wayside flower ; from books, reports, our own observations and voluntary contributions from others. How far our labors have been a suc¬ cess, each reader must judge for himself. We regret, that in this State, our county, city, ward and township officers have not been required to make annual reports to some central office ; hence, far the greater portion of the taxes collected from the people never appear in any State report. In Ohio, local taxation is reported to the State Auditor, and appears in his annual report. Why should not the tax-pay¬ ers of Pennsylvania be informed annually of the amount of her local as well as State taxation ? To vary the recurrence of tabular statements, we have prepared a num¬ ber of brief sketches of affairs that we supposed would interest some of our readers. The materials from which these have been drawn are not accessi¬ ble to the mass of our citizens. We have, in like manner, endeavored to give from the best sources at our command, the aggregate wealth of the State and the approximate amount of local taxation for all purposes. We are sorry that these are not official returns. If our information is approximately correct, then at least six-sevenths of all taxes assessed are for local, and not over one-sev¬ enth for State purposes. XIV INTRODUCTION. The Labor Department is, in this State, the first effort, in an official form, to investigate the relations that exist between capital and labor. This Bureau undoubtedly owes its existence mainly to the efforts of those who thoroughly sympathised with what is popularly known as the Labor Re¬ form Movement. No report would be complete that should seek to avoid the discussion of these vexed questions. The materials for this part of my work are almost entirely original, and have been collected, arranged and discussed under my direction, by John Tomlinson, Esq., one of my depu¬ ties. Many of the readers will cavil at some of his criticisms, but upon the whole his conclusions are in accordance with the profoundest philoso¬ phy of this age, and have my own hearty approbation. I believe the future of this great Commonwealth is chiefly dependent upon the education, skill and intelligence of her laboring classes. To de¬ velop these in their highest degree we must recognize the paramount rights of the laboring masses. Capital and its accumulation are to be protected, but not at the expense of the higher rights of the individual citizen. To collect and present data upon which to adjust the delicate relations exist¬ ing between the capitalist and his workmen, we recognize as the chief func¬ tion of this Bureau. We have, during the past year, on several occasions interfered, never to excite, but always to allay the collisions that have here¬ tofore seemed inevitable ; and we believe that our interference, in this re¬ spect alone, has been worth to the State ten times all the Bureau has cost.

The foreign dependencies of all the European States, included in the last statement, exceed the ruling power in territory, except Spain and Sweden; but Great Britain, Turkey and Holland, are the only European States whose dependencies have a greater population than themselves.

The annexed official tables show the movements of population in New York and Pennsylvania for eighty years. During the first forty years New York was constantly gaining in the race, but during the last forty years our State has, at each decennial census, been closing up the gap. The same rate of progress will, at the closing of the present century, leave them side by side. But the elements of increase are decidedly in favor of Pennsylvania. Her great gain is in her mining and manufacturing dis¬ tricts. New York has no elements to compete with these. Pennsylvania must, each decennial census, gain upon the ratio of the last, ten years, and the close of the nineteenth century will show her not only the Keystone of the Federal arch, but also the Empire State of the Union.

I DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRY. 7 BEARINGS OF INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENTS. In the two following tables six of the States, of each class, have been selected to show the bearings of industrial employments. The first table shows the existence of diversified industries ; and the second, where about three-fifths of all industries are engaged in agriculture. As a political economist, I believe that diversified industries, such as prevail in Penn¬ sylvania, are much to be preferred to the engrossment of three-fifths in any one occupation. Not only in the nation should the producers and the con¬ sumers both be found, but as far as possible in each State — aye, in each neighborhood should the farmer’s barn, and the mechanic’s workshop stand side by side. The true remedy for the agricultural States of the west, now agitated by a demand for cheap transportation of their heavy products to the east, would be the erection of mills to card and weave their cotton, their wools, their flax and hemp, and of manufacturing establishments to make their own domestic and agricultural implements. If one-third of the present agricultural laborers in these States would become mechanics, miners, Ac., and thus consumers of their former products, the other two-thirds would find no trouble in sending their diminished surplus to the east at reasonable rates, and would retain at home the money now sent abroad to purchase manufactured articles for their own consumption. In my judgment, this would be the sensible mode of terminating a thou¬ sand vexed questions that now agitate many sections of our common country. Pennsylvania is peculiarly fortunate in having her busy population en¬ gaged in a thousand industrial employments, to interchange with each other. Her central position, and industrial pre-eminence, makes her truly the Keystone of all other industrial interests on this continent. The second and third columns of these tables show the professional or brain power, and trade and transportation, or commercial regulators, may safely be trusted to adjust themselves, if the general government can only properly adjust and harmonize the equilibrium between the agricultural and mining and manufacturing occupations of our common country : 8 POPULATION AND ITS RATIO OF INCREASE.

The annexed tables give the official progress of population in one-third the most densely populated counties of the State up to 1810; also the probable population at the average ratio of increase up to 1900. These, of course a's to the future., are only approximate ; some of them may foil below theaVeTsge ratio,' others will undoubtedly exceed it. The most striking fact shown by these tables, 'is the rapid increase of population in the great mihjsrg. centres' p 'as, for example, in Venango. Schuylkill, Luzerne, Mercer and Allegheny.,' The next to these are the great manufacturing centres, as Philadelphia, Allegheny, Dauphin, Ac. Although Pennsylvania has twelve or fifteen of the finest agricultural counties in the Union, none of them have kept pace in population with her mining and manufacturing districts. Taking Pennsylvania all in all with her diversified industries — her mines, her manufactures, her agriculture and her commerec, her growth as shown in the past, her pre-eminence in the future — the citizen must be hard to please who is not satisfied witli her position in the Union.

Bureau of Statistics, f Harrisburg , August 23, 1873. > Joun C. Brown, LL. D., F. It. G. S ., F. L. S.,&c ., Berwick on the Tiveed. Dear Sir : — Governor Hartranft, of our State, has referred to xnj’ De¬ partment your letter asking for information as to the effect the destruction of our native forests has had upon the climate, health, &c., of our State. You say that you are to prepare a report on the forest economy of Eu¬ rope for the government of the Cape of Good Hope. I am glad to find in some parts of the world a disposition to check the wonton destruction of our native forests, wrhich, I am sorry to sa}r, has prevailed to some extent in this country, and I have no doubt elsewhere. I regret to say our State has never had any official survey of her native foi’ests, such as you inquire for. One of the earliest of American botanists, Barton, was a Pennsylvanian, whose work, published in Philadelphia in 1803, may give you some light on this subject. So, too, may Gray’s Bota¬ ny of the Northern States, published in New York in 1857. The only offi¬ cial survey ever made of our State, was of its Geology by Prof. Rogers. This work, in two volumes, was published in Europe, and is almost as well known there as here. It is undoubtedly the ablest contribution made to geology by an American. I have neither the scientific ability or the leisure to answer so broad an inquiry as your letter proposes. To do that intelligently would require a volume. But as Gov. Hartranft has referred your letter to me, I shall send you a few thoughts suggested by it. It is not strange that an educated Englishman should turn here to make inquiries in regard to our native forests. The very name of our State being derived from “ Penn’s Woods.” This name was given to this province one hundred and ninety-two years since, by your King Charles, the Second, against the consent of William Penn, the younger, who proposed to call it New Wales. But the King, with vastly better taste, insisted that it should be named Pennsylvania, a name of which we have become very proud. DESTRUCTION OF OUR NATIVE FORESTS, SO The twenty-eight millions of acres included in that patent, was th'en aptly described by the name of Penn’s Woods; and something over one-third of that territory may still retain most of its native forests. But the other two-thirds have been sub-divided into farms and lots, the happy homes of nearly four millions of intelligent and patriotic men, women and children. Perhaps one-fourth of these latter are timber lands, reserved for the use of the adjacent farms. If on yoUr visit to this country you should include Pennsylvania in your tour, the Governor will be happy to proffer you the courtesies due to art eminent traveler, and I shall aid you by every means in my power. I am sorry to say that, in the change from primeval nature to the present state of cultivation, our forests have suffered much more largely than yoil or I would sanction. But the hardy pioneer axeman who opened up oUr State had not learned to look upon trees from their picturesque aspect. We may indeed regret their want of taste, but it is no doubt better for the in* terests of civilization that they, not we, were the actors on the Scene. Their want of taste Was atoned for by Untold Virtues. First. _ I believe that the effect of the clearing out of our forests has been favorable to the health of the State. The melted snows and rains accumu* lated on the surface under the dense foliage of our native forests in some Sections, generated a miasmi that brought fever and agile. The effects of opening Up the surface to the direct rays of the sun, accompanied by thor¬ ough drainage, have changed all this, and now fever and ague are almost Unknown in the State. Other diseases incident to pioneer life have also become extinct. Second, — The destruction of our native forests has undoubtedly injuri¬ ously affected our rivers and water courses. Formerly, the mass of veg¬ etable matter on the surface and the derise foliage tended to retain the rains and melted snows ; and hence our streams were kept in a much more uniform stage than now. At present, our rains rush rapidly into the runs, creeks and rivers and we have high floods and long intervening periods of low water. We have scarcely flow as many good weeks of Water as we once had months. Our floods are higher, ohr seasons of drouth longer. This, however, we presume is incident to all countries and not peculiar to our State, Th ird . _ Timber has now become so valuable, that our citizens are more careful of it. In the early settlements there was little demand for timber cut from the forests. The hardy pioneers of civilization were mainly anx¬ ious to clear up the forest, to plant crops to sustain their families. Hence, the choicest of timber,- that would now be a fortune to the owner, was looked Upon as an obstacle in his way, and burned up without hesitation. Conse¬ quently former generations squandered what would have been a fortune to DESTRUCTION OF OUR NATIVE FORESTS. 31 the present. Pine, the staple of the great lumber interest of the State, will, within twenty-five years be exhausted, and hemlock, poplar and ash will have to be substituted in its stead. Fourth. — We have had no systematic effort, on a large scale, to re-pro*’ ctuce timber. Ill the vicinity of dwellings, large quantities of trees have been planted, but this is only a drop in the bucket. There has been some care taken in the vicinity of iron works to re-produce a rapid growth of young timber. Formerly charcoal produced from timber was the fuel used in the manufacture of iron. Timber lands in the vicinity of iron furnaces, were chopped over once In about twenty-five years ; but for lumbering pur¬ poses this process would require a faith in the future that Americans have not yet learned to exercise. At least two hundred years would be required to re-produce trees valuable to the lumberman. Fifth. — In speaking of one-third of our State as being little changed from the days of William Penn, you must not understand me as asserting that we still retain the one-third of the valuable timber of former days. Large portions of this reserve is mountainous lands, whose timber is of secondary value. These remarks may serve to give you a faint idea. Penn’s Woods of two hundred years since, have become the home of nearly four millions of civilized and intelligent freemen. If the Value of the forests have beeii largely diminished, the productiveness of the soil has been increased ten thousand fold. Accept my kind wishes for your success ill all efforts to preserve our na¬ tive forests from useless devastation. With great respect, I remain your obedient servant. THOS. J.
