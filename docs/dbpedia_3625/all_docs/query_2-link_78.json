        "text": "SAR’s Academic Freedom Monitoring Project (the “Monitoring Project”) identifies key types of attacks on higher education communities in order to raise awareness of the problem, reduce the sense of isolation of survivors of attacks, promote accountability, and help mitigate, deter, or otherwise prevent future incidents.\n\nThis year’s report assesses data collected from September 2021 to August 2022 and includes 391 attacks arising from 318 incidents in 65 countries and territories. Given the limited resources available, the scope, variety, and complexity of attacks occurring, and a common fear among survivors to report attacks, it should be noted that these figures represent only a fraction of the total number of attacks we believe occur annually. A comprehensive accounting is not yet possible. Rather, this report analyzes reported incidents for recurring themes, regional trends, and common factors that warrant deeper attention from stakeholders, especially states, intergovernmental organizations, higher education leaders, the media, and civil society.\n\nFor the purpose of this report, “attacks” on higher education include threats or deliberate use of violent or coercive force against higher education institutions and their members, including leadership, administrators, academic and other staff, and students. They include intentional acts resulting in wrongful death, physical harm, loss of liberty, limitations on academic travel, or loss of professional or academic standing, or resulting in the destruction, damage, closure, or seizure of higher education institutions, facilities, or equipment. This definition also includes deliberate acts of coercion, intimidation, or threats of harm that undermine institutional autonomy, academic freedom, and educational functions, but it does not generally include other infringements of these values and functions which lack these violent, coercive, or restrictive dimensions.\n\nWhatever the types of incidents and wherever they occur, they share common negative outcomes: they undermine the security of higher education institutions and personnel, including those directly targeted and those intimidated or silenced by attacks on others. They impose restrictions on access to higher education by targeted and vulnerable individuals and groups. They undermine research, teaching, and public discourse, eroding not only academic quality, but social, political, economic, and cultural development. And insofar as higher education contributes to pedagogy, materials, and teacher-training, attacks on higher education can undermine education at all levels. They contribute to “brain drain,” the flight of scholars and students, as well as to “brain drag,” the “lost personal, professional, and creative productivity that would have been, but for the rational fear of retaliation,”[1] undermining national investments in education and exacerbating inequities within the local and global knowledge economies. They disrupt increasingly important flows of higher education staff, students, and research between countries, depriving everyone of the fullest benefits of cross-border intellectual exchange and research.\n\nThe Monitoring Project organizes documented attacks into six categories: (i) killings, violence, and disappearances; (ii) wrongful imprisonment; (iii) wrongful prosecution; (iv) loss of position and expulsion from study; (v) improper travel restrictions; and (vi) other severe or systemic issues. This chapter provides an overview of the typology of attacks, using Monitoring Project data from the above-mentioned reporting period, to highlight relevant issues of concern, including attacks on student expression that figure into many of the incidents SAR reports. This overview is followed by a review of concerning developments and trends around the world.\n\nKillings, Violence, and Disappearances\n\nViolent attacks on scholars, students, staff, and their institutions are one of the most serious threats to the higher education sector. Campus-wide attacks, targeted killings, lethal force against student protesters, and threats of violence result in loss of lives and injuries to many, compromise the safety of entire campuses, and incite fear in faculty, students, administrators, and society at large. This, in turn, can restrict access to higher education, threaten the functioning of the higher education space, and chill academic freedom. Since the Monitoring Project’s inception in 2011, SAR has registered 831 violent attacks (roughly one third of total attacks documented), including 181 (nearly half of this report’s total attacks), that occurred during this reporting period.\n\nIndividuals and groups carry out attacks on higher education communities with the intention of killing or injuring multiple faculty, students, and staff. Perpetrators may intentionally target specific institutions or individuals or attack indiscriminately. They may target institutions as proxies for state authority or as a symbol of a modern, education-based society. Or they may be opportunistic acts aimed at taking advantage of university and college campuses and facilities as places where groups of people gather according to predictable schedules, especially when inadequate steps are taken to provide for the security of campuses, classrooms, transports, and dormitories.\n\nIn Cameroon, unidentified individuals detonated a homemade bomb on the campus of the University of Buea, injuring 11 students.[2] The incident occurred against the backdrop of violent conflict between anglophone separatists and the government in the western part of the country. The bomb was reportedly thrown onto the roof of a lecture hall, where it exploded.\n\nIn Nigeria, suspected members of the terrorist group Boko Haram attacked the Tukur Yusufu Buratai Institute for War and Peace at the Nigerian Army University, killing at least two employees and burning cars and offices on the campus.[3] According to Sahara Reporters, the assailants arrived on gun trucks and fired rocket propelled grenades at security personnel stationed near the entrance.[4]\n\nIn Pakistan, three Chinese teachers and their Pakistani driver were killed by a suicide bombing at the entrance to the University of Karachi’s Confucius Institute.[5] Those killed in the attack included the Confucius Institute’s founder, Huang Guiping, and his fellow teachers, Ding Mupeng and Chen Sai. A fourth teacher, Wang Yuqing, was injured in the attack. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. Sources identified the assailant as Shaari Baloch, who detonated her explosive vest outside the university entrance, just as a van carrying the teachers arrived. BLA commented that it targeted the Institute as a “symbol of Chinese economic, cultural and political expansionism.”[6]\n\nTargeted killings include those aiming to silence particular individuals because of the content of their research, teaching, writing, or public expression, or simply for their identity as scholars or students.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the Dean of the Sharia Law Faculty at Ghazni University, Sayed Asif Mubtahij Hashemi, was found dead after being abducted by armed assailants several months earlier.[7] Hashemi’s colleagues told one news outlet that he was abducted at gunpoint while teaching at an orphanage and taken to an unknown location by individuals who appeared to be affiliated with the Taliban. The professors asserted that the abductors had previously shown up at Hashemi’s house in Taliban uniforms and Hashemi’s family additionally reported that Taliban authorities had summoned him to a specific area through repeated phone calls ahead of his abduction. Another Afghan lawyer stated that it is possible Hashemi was killed for his liberal ideas and anti-extremist interpretations of religious texts. Taliban officials denied involvement in his abduction.\n\nIn Nigeria, a group of students at Shehu Shagari College Of Education Sokoto (SSCOE) killed classmate Deborah Samuel (also known as Deborah Yakubu), a Christain student, after classmates accused her of blasphemy.[8] Her accusers alleged that Samuel made a comment in a WhatsApp group that they perceived as insulting the Prophet Muhammed. According to police, a group of students took Samuel from a campus security outpost where she was hiding, beat her with clubs and stones, and then set her body on fire. Police reportedly used tear gas and fired shots in the air in an apparent attempt to disperse her attackers, who threw rocks and sticks in response.\n\nScholars, students, and their institutions also face threats of violence designed to punish, block, or otherwise alter their research, teaching, studies, or public expression.\n\nIn Colombia, a professor in the law and political sciences faculty of the University of Antioquia reportedly received anonymous messages threatening to torture and kill her, apparently in response to the professor’s academic activity.[9] The university issued a statement, denouncing the threats as harmful to academic freedom and to the university’s mission. Sources kept the professor’s identity confidential, apparently to protect her.\n\nIn India, students in the right-wing group Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and others at the University of Lucknow surrounded Ravi Kant Chandan, a Dalit professor of Hindi, and harassed and threatened him over accusations that he disrespected Hindu deities in comments he made during an online event.[10] Kant, who told Hindustan Times that he believed the students wanted to kill him, was forced to seek shelter for hours in an administrator’s office.[11] Roughly one week after the incident, Kant was physically attacked, and a student filed a criminal complaint against him with local authorities, resulting in a criminal investigation.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, a professor of human rights law at Queens University Belfast, Colin Harvey, has been subjected to violent threats as part of a years’ long smear campaign for his academic work regarding the status of Northern Ireland.[12] Harvey, who previously served as commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, has reportedly been targeted by politicians, journalists, and others on social media. He has also been subjected to threats of violence and false allegations that he is affiliated with paramilitary groups and associated with nazism. In March 2022, UN human rights experts publicly raised concerns that the campaign placed him at risk of physical harm.[13]\n\nThe use of violent and especially lethal force, particularly the use of live ammunition, by state and private security forces against student protesters is also of particular concern to higher education communities.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, a police officer killed a University of Mbandaka student and a fellow officer during a police response to a student protest over an increase in registration fees.[14] After a dispute broke out between students and police, an officer chased the victim who was running away from the scene. The officer fired his weapon, striking the student and a fellow officer. The same officer who fired his weapon then reportedly rushed to the aforementioned student and shot her in the chest, killing her. The second officer was also killed as a result of the initial gunfire.\n\nIn Lesotho, police killed one student and injured several others when they opened fire during their response to a protest over the reduction of student grants at the National University of Lesotho.[15] Some sources described the protest as disruptive, but no specific acts of student violence were reported. Students claimed that the police fired their weapons without warning.\n\nIn Nigeria, police opened fire at a crowd of Abia State Polytechnic (ASP) students protesting in response to news that a police officer allegedly raped a fellow student.[16] A large group of students—apparently hundreds, according to available reports, photos, and videos—peacefully protested on a busy road near campus, bringing traffic to a halt. Students chanted and held placards. Police near ASP’s entrance reportedly fired several shots towards protesters, who sources described as being nonviolent. There were no reported injuries.\n\nWhile state and private university security forces have a responsibility to ensure security and safety, they must also exercise restraint and respond to student expression and protest activities in an appropriate and proportional manner, emphasizing de-escalation, and consistent with recognized international human rights standards. Security forces should not use weapons when responding to nonviolent student expression. Lethal force against nonviolent student expression is never justified.\n\nSAR condemns targeted, violent attacks on higher education communities, threats of violence, and the use of lethal force against student protesters. SAR calls on state authorities to investigate these incidents, to make every effort to hold perpetrators accountable, and to ensure the security of all members of the community. State authorities must publicize investigations and accountability measures, so as to inform constituents, positively influence state and non-state actors, and make these measures effective. SAR also calls on higher education institutions and civil society to press state authorities for greater protection and accountability, and to contribute to efforts to understand and reinforce principles of autonomy and academic freedom.\n\nWrongful Imprisonment and Prosecution\n\nScholars and students bring attention to a variety of important issues and may question dominant discourse and figures of authority through their academic work, inquiry, expression, and associations. In an effort to maintain power and control, state authorities often attempt to silence them with a range of coercive legal measures, including criminal investigations, arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment. Since the Monitoring Project’s inception, SAR has documented 786 incidents involving wrongful imprisonment or prosecution, 83 of which occurred during this reporting period.\n\nImprisonments and prosecutions of scholars and students are wrongful when intended to punish, deter, or impede nonviolent academic activity or the exercise of other protected rights, including freedoms of expression, association, or assembly. Such prosecutions are typically brought under laws aimed at restricting critical inquiry and expression. These include opaque and overbroad laws on blasphemy, lèse-majesté, civil and criminal defamation, sedition, espionage, national security, and terrorism that make illegal the mere expression of opinions or ideas on certain topics, without any link to violent or otherwise criminal acts or intentions whatsoever.[17] Such laws raise concern for entire higher education communities in that they sanction and impose artificial boundaries on research, teaching, publications, and discussion, undermining quality, creativity, and innovation that can benefit society at large. Scholars also face legal actions brought under other laws of general application, including, for example, those proscribing financial impropriety, corruption, or immorality. Wrongful prosecutions under these laws damage the reputation of the targeted individuals and isolate them from their institutions, colleagues, and other sources of professional and personal support.\n\nIn many cases, legal proceedings and prosecutions of scholars and students involve forced confessions, fabricated evidence, arbitrary charges, and lengthy prison sentences or harsh penalties. Trials may be repeatedly delayed or held in secret or closed-door proceedings, denying access to media and family. Such actions raise serious due process concerns. Detained or imprisoned scholars and students may also be held in overcrowded cells or solitary confinement, denied access to appropriate medical care, family, or legal counsel, and subjected to lengthy interrogations, abuse, and torture.\n\nLecturers, researchers, and other academic personnel, as well as students, are routinely investigated, prosecuted, imprisoned, and subjected to other legal actions for a wide range of academic conduct as well as their public views, peaceful protest activity, associations, and ideas. Public criticism of governments or political leaders, and other forms of dissent—whether in academic or other contexts—are frequently the apparent basis for such actions by the state. The examples below from this reporting period demonstrate the diversity of alleged bases for coercive legal actions and the range of actions taken to silence and punish scholars and students.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Taliban forces arrested Kabul University lecturer and political commentator Faizullah Jalal at his home and took him to an unknown location, apparently for his public criticism of the Taliban government.[18] According to TOLO News, a “security source” stated that Jalal had been arrested for “making allegations against some government departments” and was being subjected to interrogations by the intelligence department.[19] On January 9, Al Jazeera reported that government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had posted tweets about the arrest stating that Jalal had made comments on social media in an attempt to “instigate people against the system” and that he had been arrested to ensure “others don’t make similar senseless comments in the name of being a professor or scholar that harm the dignity of the people.”[20] Mujahid reportedly shared inflammatory tweets from an account under the professor’s name that Jalal and his family said was fake. On January 11, Jalal’s family announced on social media that he had been released from detention.\n\nIn Egypt, a court ordered the detention of Ayman Mansour Nada, a renowned journalism professor and head of the Radio and Television Department at Cairo University, for his public criticism of some of Egypt’s media personalities and officials, the country’s general media landscape, and the Cairo University administration.[21] Nada was held for nearly two months before being released on November 17, 2021. In March 2022, a court issued Nada a one-year suspended prison sentence and a fine of 20,000 Egyptian pounds (roughly $1,020 USD) for “publicly and maliciously publishing false news about Egyptian media that would disturb public peace and harm the public interest.”[22]\n\nIn Ethiopia, state authorities arrested Addis Ababa University law professor Assefa Fiseha amidt a state of emergency enacted in connection with armed conflict between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and government troops.[23] An internationally known expert on federalism and constitutional law, Feseha is one of 1,000 people, predominantly ethnic Tigrayans, who were arrested since the government enacted a state of emergency in early November.[24]\n\nIn Indonesia, on December 1, 2021—a day recognized by Papuan separatists as Papua’s independence day—Indonesian police arrested and detained a group of eight peaceful student protesters who raised the Morning Star flag, which is banned in Indonesia, above a stadium in Jayapura and called for a referendum on Papuan independence.[25] The students were charged with treason, which can carry a sentence of up to life imprisonment.\n\nIn Kuwait, national security agents interrogated and made a referral for a criminal investigation against Safaa Zaman, a professor for the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering at Kuwait University and the president of the Kuwait Association for Information Security, about an interview she gave in her field of study.[26] Days before the interrogation, Al-Shahed TV published an interview of Zaman, during which she spoke about the risks of hacking and threats of data security posed by the existence of electronic servers associated with Egypt’s Civil Service Commission. (Egypt is a strong international ally of Kuwait.) The Gulf Centre for Human Rights noted that Zaman’s remarks were “within her field of speciali[z]ation” and made “using evidence-based information.”[27] Zaman was later charged with “broadcasting false news that undermines the prestige of the state,” “causing panic in society,” and “exposing the country to the risk of severing its relationship with a friendly country.” According to Civicus, a court of first instance acquitted Zaman on March 29, 2022.[28]\n\nIn Mexico, the attorney general’s office (FGR) requested arrest warrants for 31 scientists, academics, and researchers—all former members of an independent scientific advisory board called the Scientific and Technological Consultative Forum (“Foro Consultivo”)—on charges of money laundering, organized crime, and embezzlement.[29] Specifically, the FGR accused the academics of spending millions in public funds awarded to them by the National Council for Science and Technology (Conacyt), in violation of a law passed in 2019 that prohibits members of an advisory board from receiving money from a government science fund. The FGR reportedly sought to jail the academics at Altiplano prison, a maximum-security facility historically used to intern high-level criminals. The academics disputed the charges, asserting that the funds were awarded and spent by the advisory board well before the 2019 law was passed, and that their use had been approved. A judge declined the FGR’s multiple requests for arrest warrants and found the case inadmissible. The FGR’s attempt to jail and prosecute the 31 former Foro Consultivo members outraged the local and international scientific communities, raising concerns that the FGR’s action was actually an attempt to intimidate and silence critics of Conacyt’s director, María Elena Álvarez-Buylla, including the accused academics. Conacyt filed a complaint that prompted the FGR’s investigation around the same time that Álvarez-Buylla appointed Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero to a high-level membership in Mexico’s National System of Researchers. That decision was considered highly controversial, as Gertz had been repeatedly denied the appointment in connection with plagiarism allegations.\n\nIn Myanmar, soldiers arrested Daw Hnin Nandar Aung, a faculty member of Technological University, Dawei, who allegedly participated in a civil disobedience movement protesting a military coup that began in February 2021.[30] The university’s student union reported that soldiers arrested her at her home, around 10:00 PM. As of this report, there is no public information regarding her current status, including whether she remains in the military’s custody.\n\nIn South Korea, police raided the home of researcher Dae-il Jeong, who studies the North Korean Juche ideology at the Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU).[31] The police conducted a search and seizure of property at Jeong’s residence on charges that he was violating South Korea’s National Security Act (NSA), which prohibits individuals from possessing documents associated with anti-state groups. The police searched and confiscated Jeong’s cellphone, computers, research materials, and a copy of With the Century, a memoir written by former North Korean President Kim Il-sung that is considered controversial in South Korea. Months earlier, police raided the offices of one publishing house that printed the memoir, claiming that they had violated the NSA. The police warrant reportedly noted allegations that Jeong was in communication with that same publishing house regarding the production of the memoir. KINU denounced the search as a violation of academic freedom.\n\nThe incidents described above provide a disturbing accounting of the range of punitive legal actions that scholars and students often suffer in connection with their research, publications, expressive activity, and associations. Such actions can leave them with physical and emotional scars and, in some cases, destroy careers. Beyond the immediate harm to those individual scholars and students, wrongful imprisonments and prosecutions send a message to higher education communities and society at large that expressing ideas or raising questions can result in grave consequences. As a result, society risks losing the benefits of a diverse community of scholars and students, free to carry out their work or share their thoughts, without fear of punishment by state authorities.\n\nSAR urges state authorities around the world to release scholars and students imprisoned for their academic work or the nonviolent exercise of other protected human rights. With particular concern over the heightened risk COVID-19 continues to present to incarcerated populations, SAR calls on state authorities to immediately release wrongfully imprisoned scholars and students, especially those who have health conditions that elevate their level of risk or who are being held in unsanitary or crowded conditions. Pending this, states must uphold their obligations under domestic and international law, including those related to due process and the humane treatment of prisoners. SAR further urges state authorities to drop prosecutions against scholars in connection with nonviolent academic or expressive activity, to review laws that have been used wrongfully to prosecute scholars and students, and to amend or repeal them as necessary, to ensure that scholars can think, question, and share ideas without fear of retribution.\n\nLoss of Position\n\nHigher education and state authorities punish, deter, and restrict the exercise of academic freedom and other protected rights of scholars and students through employment or administrative actions. These include the loss of position by dismissal, suspension, demotion, and denial of promotions or other benefits to scholars, and permanent or temporary expulsion of students from courses of study, programs, and facilities. Reports of credible threats by relevant authorities to take such actions are also considered. Since the Monitoring Project’s inception, SAR has reported 257 incidents involving permanent or temporary loss of position or threats of the same.\n\nDisciplinary actions may be openly acknowledged as punishing or attempting to block academic speech or conduct, including statements made in the classroom or on campus, writings (including newspaper columns, letters, blogs, and social media), research, participation in professional or student associations, union activity, or criticism of higher education or state leadership or policy. State or university officials may also attribute the action to regular administrative or employment decisions having nothing to do with academic content or conduct, such as budget cuts or lack of demand, or allegations of poor performance, violation of policy, violation of terms of employment or admission, fraud or other dishonest or inappropriate behavior; they may also provide no explanation.[32] It is important to note the role of government and political figures in such incidents, where these external actors publicly and privately exert pressure on higher education administrations to secure the removal of particular scholars or students from the campus community. In some cases, state and military leaders have also pushed for mass dismissals and suspensions of students and scholars for their peaceful dissent. The below examples illustrate a range of employment and administrative actions taken against lecturers, researchers, and other academic personnel during this reporting period.\n\nIn Belarus, Belarusian State University (BSU) declined to renew the contract of Aliaksandr Danilevich, an associate professor of international relations, apparently for signing a public appeal against Russia’s war in Ukraine.[33] BSU administrators had earlier reprimanded Danilevich for signing the appeal, informing him that faculty are not permitted to engage in so-called political agitation, but Danilevich refused to remove his signature. Danilevich had taught at BSU for 20 years.\n\nIn China, Shanghai Aurora College fired Song Gengyi, a journalism lecturer, after giving a lecture in which she questioned the accuracy of the official death toll relating to the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, in which the imperial Japanese Army committed a series of grave atrocities during the second Sino-Japanese War.[34] During the lecture, Song reportedly argued that the Chinese government’s official estimate of 300,000 deaths lacked statistical support and that estimates ranged from “500,000 to 300,000 to 30,000 to 3,000.”[35] A student reportedly recorded the lecture and posted it online, shortly after which the university terminated Song for “making the wrong remarks, causing a serious teaching incident, and resulting in severely bad social impact.”[36]\n\nIn India, Sharda University suspended Waqas Farooq Kuttay, an assistant professor, for a question he included on a political science exam for undergraduate students. Kuttay reportedly asked: “Do you find any similarities between Fascism/Nazism and Hindu right wing (Hindutva)? Elaborate with arguments.”[37] A photo of the exam question was posted to Twitter and went viral. Some students reportedly complained about the question to the university. In announcing the suspension, the university stated, “The university regrets that such an incident has taken place that may have the potential for fomenting social discord.”[38]\n\nIn Poland, President Andrzej Duda refused to approve the promotion of Michał Bilewicz, a genocide researcher and the head of the Center for Research on Prejudice at University of Warsaw, to a full professorship, apparently due to the nature of his research.[39] Bilewicz, currently an associate professor, has written extensively on anti-Semitism and the Polish people’s role in the Holocaust, and its aftermath—topics considered sensitive by the country’s ruling right-wing government. For more than three years, Duda had refused to sign off on Bilewicz’s committee-approved appointment, with a number of observers arguing that his refusal to do so is driven by the fact that Bilewicz’s research findings conflict with Duda’s party’s nationalist views. They point out that Bilewicz’s appointment is one of two in Poland that Duda has refused to sign off on; the other is the appointment of Walter Żelazny, an outspoken opposition sociologist and activist. Duda has claimed that he refused to sign off on Bilewicz’s appointment because too many of the reviewers were from Bilewicz’s university.\n\nIn Sudan, the military-led government dismissed all university boards and replaced 30 public university presidents and 8 vice presidents who had been appointed by the prior civilian-led government.[40] Waleed Ali Ahmed, a council member of the Sudanese Professionals Association, stated that the officials were “removed and replaced by others who are loyal to the Islamic movement.”[41] Higher education organizations across Sudan condemned the move as a silencing tactic and called it “illegal.” Senior-level officials in the Ministry of Higher Education and General Education were also reportedly dismissed.[42]\n\nIn Turkey, the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) ordered the dismissal of three deans from Boğaziçi University, apparently for their participation in protests against the university’s rector, Mehmet Naci İnci.[43] Özlem Berk Albachten, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Metin Ercan, the Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, and Yasemin Bayyurt, the Dean of the Faculty of Education, had been active participants in protests against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s appointment of İnci’s predecessor and Erdoğan political ally, Melih Bulu, as rector of the university in January 2021. The protests continued after Bulu’s dismissal and replacement with İnci in August 2021, despite overwhelming faculty disapproval of the latter. Since January 2021, protesting students and faculty have faced arrests, detentions, prosecutions, suspensions, dismissals, and violent force by Turkish police. İnci stated on his Twitter that YÖK had ordered the three scholars to be removed from their deanships due to investigations into alleged, unspecified disciplinary offenses. Academics at Boğaziçi University criticized the dismissals as arbitrary and damaging to the university and emphasized that the deans had been elected to their posts by a faculty majority.\n\nIn the United States, the Soka University of America launched an investigation against Aneil Rallin, a celebrated professor of rhetoric and composition, in response to alleged student complaints about their (Rallin uses they/them pronouns) course titled, “Writing the Body.”[44] In their complaints, students stated that they felt “violated” and “triggered” and that the content included required readings that were “disturbing,” “gratuitously violent,” and “vaguely pedophilic.”[45] The interim dean of faculty describing these allegations stated that Rallin was accused of violating four policies in the faculty handbook, including violations that could serve as grounds for dismissal. Rallin has denied the allegations and stated that they took all necessary measures to make students feel comfortable, including providing trigger warnings, offering alternate reading material, and assuring students that they did not have to engage with certain works or share their own work if they were not comfortable doing so. One student expressed surprise over the complaints, noting that Rallin went out of their way to help make all students comfortable and that “Writing the Body” was “probably one of the most popular courses.”[46] Only two faculty members showed up to serve on a faculty adjudication committee that was ordered, with the dean serving as a third member, prompting serious due process concerns.\n\nStudents also face similar reprisals for expressive activity. Retaliations of this type can have lasting negative impacts on the students they affect: even if they are permitted to enroll elsewhere, other institutions may be hesitant to accept them, fearing government reprisals if they do so, and as a result, the students’ future prospects are reduced.\n\nIn China, Ludong University expelled Sun Jian, a master’s student in Chinese history, for protesting the university’s COVID-19 policies and campus lockdown.[47] Prior to his expulsion, Sun had been criticizing the university’s pandemic response for months, including publishing an open letter to his WeChat account. According to University World News, on March 27, 2022, Sun held signs on campus reading “Unblock Ludong” and “Resolutely oppose high nucleic acid testing for all staff” for approximately 20 minutes.[48] Sun told Radio Free Asia that he was approached several times and followed during that period, before eventually being tackled and escorted into an administrative building on campus by a teacher and two security guards.[49] Following his brief detainment, he posted videos of himself holding the signs on social media, which purportedly caused the security bureau to issue him a warning. However, the bureau claimed that Sun allegedly continued to “incite[] students to boycott” the university’s COVID-19 prevention measures on WeChat and other platforms following the warning. Then, on March 31, the university issued an expulsion notice to Sun, claiming that he had seriously violated national laws and public order and granting him 10 days to file a written appeal to the university.\n\nIn Russia, the Ministry of Internal Affairs reportedly ordered St. Petersburg State University (SPbGU) to expel 13 students who participated in anti-war protests following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[50] SPbGu’s vice-rector Alexander Babich noted on the university’s website that if the state notified the university about a student found guilty of violating the law, including that which criminalizes mass demonstrations without state-issued permits, the student would be punished up to, and including, expulsion.[51]\n\nIn Ukraine, Bila Tserkva National Agrarian University expelled a fourth-year student, identified as Elvira, in the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, for a social media post that apparently suggested that she did not support either side in the fighting that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.[52] In a statement, the university said it had called an urgent meeting of senior administrators, during which they ordered the student’s immediate expulsion.[53] The university also noted that it had contacted state law enforcement.\n\nExpulsions, dismissals, suspensions, and other forms of professional retaliation or silencing can have a corrosive effect on institutional autonomy, academic freedom, and free expression generally. They can encourage self-censorship and even contribute to brain drain, as scholars and students seek fairer and more transparent environments in which to conduct their research, teaching, and studying. They can also leave individuals isolated and vulnerable to more extreme forms of attack, including arrest, prosecution, and violence. Early attention to dismissals and expulsions may then help to forestall these attacks. Finally, to the extent that these forms of attacks are intended to silence critics and, in the case of students, eliminate their potential for effective criticism and dissent in the future, these forms of attacks threaten the foundations of democratic society and warrant a robust response.\n\nTo safeguard academic freedom and institutional autonomy and to maintain the highest standards of quality education, SAR calls on higher education leaders and state authorities to refrain from taking or compelling disciplinary actions intended to punish or restrict the exercise of academic freedom and other protected rights. SAR further calls on higher education leaders and administrators to ensure faculty and students due process in all disciplinary proceedings.\n\nTravel Restrictions\n\nFreedom of movement is fundamental to quality higher education, advancing the exchange of new ideas and bolstering international academic collaborations to address the world’s problems. However, the international and intrastate mobility of both students and scholars is routinely threatened by state actors seeking to limit the flow of knowledge. Governments deny scholars and students entry at their national borders, deport members of the academic community, and enact policies that seek to or unintentionally limit or frustrate academic travel, including for fieldwork, conferences, study abroad, and to take up employment offers. Since the Monitoring Project’s inception, SAR has reported 92 incidents involving travel restrictions that have directly impacted thousands of scholars and students.\n\nTo be clear, states have the right to control entry into their territories; however, they must do so consistent with their obligations under domestic and international law. Restrictions on travel intended to limit particular academic content or conduct, or that of particular scholars or students, may violate academic freedom, freedom of expression, and other internationally recognized freedoms. Indeed, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) speaks directly to this issue, providing that the right to freedom of expression “shall include [the] freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers…” (emphasis added).\n\nThus, while states may restrict travel to protect national security and public health, and to support other legitimate state interests, policy-level decisions intended to restrict or frustrate access to higher education, or that have a disproportionate impact on higher education, may violate state obligations to protect the right to education and freedom of expression. Likewise, policies or restrictions aimed at retaliating against or preventing academic inquiry or expression may violate academic freedom.\n\nGiven a sustained reduction in scholars’ and students’ international academic travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SAR reported relatively few particularized incidents involving travel restrictions over the past year.\n\nIn Iran, for example, state authorities barred sociology professor and former political prisoner Saeed Madani from leaving the country to begin a one-year research post at Yale University, in the United States.[54] Madani’s research focuses on poverty, drug addiction, sex work, and child abuse, among other topics considered controversial in Iran. According to a letter that Madani later sent to Iran’s Minister of Justice in response to the travel ban, he was interrogated by intelligence officials two days prior to his scheduled flight out of Iran, but was informed that he could travel. However, on December 7, the day of his flight, authorities stopped Madani at his gate in the airport and prevented him from boarding. He was then taken to the police station where he was interrogated by officers from various security agencies about his views and activities. The officers ultimately informed Madani that he was banned from traveling and confiscated his passport. Six months later, in May 2022, Iranian state media reported that Madani had been arrested on security charges for alleged “suspicious foreign links.”[55]\n\nIn India, on March 24, 2022, authorities denied entry to and deported Filippo Osella, a renowned anthropology and South Asian studies professor from the University of Sussex, in the United Kingdom, who was traveling to attend an academic conference.[56] After his plane landed in Thiruvananthapuram, Osella was escorted to an immigration desk, where officials photographed and fingerprinted him before informing him that there was a government order to deport him back to the UK. The officials would not provide further information on the reason for his deportation and would not allow him to contact friends or colleagues within India who could vouch for his reputation or seek answers from the Indian government. When he asked to retrieve some medication from his luggage, the officials threatened to restrain Osella if he did not stop talking. Osella has speculated that he was denied entry and deported due to his previous travel to Pakistan, which he has visited twice and was questioned about by immigration officials during this deportation process, as well as during other visits to India.[57]\n\nTargeted travel restrictions highlighted in past editions of Free to Think have included China’s government barring human rights lawyer Lu Siwei from leaving the country and traveling to the US to undertake an academic fellowship, on national security grounds;[58] Egyptian authorities barring Walid Salem, an Egyptian PhD candidate at the University of Washington, from traveling to the US to resume his studies;[59] Russian officials denying entry to French sociologist Carine Clément, who was to participate in a conference on protest movements;[60] and Zambia’s government detaining and deporting Patrick Lumumba, a Kenyan law professor, who was invited to deliver a lecture on Chinese-African relations, a potentially sensitive topic given the government’s apparent reliance on Chinese loans.[61] These earlier incidents serve as a reminder of the types of travel restrictions scholars and students may see more frequently once global academic travel more fully resumes.\n\nGovernments also use broad policies and practices that restrict the movement of scholars and students thereby limiting academic activity and the cross-border exchange of ideas for entire communities.\n\nIn Algeria, the Ministry of Higher Education ordered a ban on Algerian scholars attending academic conferences in Morocco.[62] The decision apparently stemmed from the publication of allegedly “anti-Algerian articles” in a Moroccan legal and judicial studies journal called Al-Bahit as well as tense relations between the Moroccan and Algerian governments. The Ministry also reportedly barred Algerian scholars from publishing research in Moroccan journals.\n\nIn India, regulatory authorities announced that any degrees from Pakistani higher education institutions will no longer be recognized in India, a move that would deter most Indian students from pursuing education there.[63] According to a joint notice issued by the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education, “[a]ny Indian national or [Indian] overseas citizen who intends to take admission in any degree college or educational institution of Pakistan shall not be eligible for seeking employment or higher studies in India.”[64] The notice further stated that “all concerned are advised not to travel to Pakistan for pursuing higher education.” The policy change was reportedly connected to tensions between India and Pakistan over Jammu and Kashmir. In response to the announcement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office issued a statement that “Pakistan reserves the right to take appropriate measures in response to this openly discriminatory and inexplicable action by India.”[65]\n\nIn the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), the government of Israel continues to impose on scholars and students an array of policies that restrict their movement. These include long-standing restrictions, such as checkpoints and travel permits imposed on all Palestinians, as well as targeted pressures that impact the global academic community. For example, in February 2022, Israeli authorities announced a government directive that restricts international scholar and student travel to and work in the West Bank.[66] The “Procedure for Entry and Residence of Foreigners in Judea and Samaria Area,” inter alia, gives a unit within the Israeli Ministry of Defense discretion over international scholar and student residency applications, limits the duration of their residency in the West Bank and places burdensome requirements on applicants and future permit holders, including requirements to leave the West Bank for 9 months after their first 27 months and possible financial guarantees of up to 70,000 NIS (roughly $20,000 USD). The original directive sought to limit the number of foreign faculty and students permitted to study and research long-term at West bank higher education institutions to 100 and 150 annually, respectively; however, this was later struck from an updated directive published in September, following significant local and international outcry, including from the Israeli human rights organization HaMoked, the Middle East Studies Association’s Committee on Academic Freedom, SAR, and others.[67] For Palestinian scholars and students in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, checkpoints, roadblocks, the separation wall, and the opaque and lengthy processing of travel permits continue to restrict their travel within the OPT, into Israel, and abroad, constricting their ability to study, teach, research, and exchange ideas with colleagues within and outside the OPT. Israel’s border restrictions also impede the importation of equipment, books, and school materials that quality higher education requires.[68] Travel restrictions limiting the flow of scholars, students, and academic materials in and out of the OPT constrict the meaningful exercise of the right to education and academic freedom. Moreover, such broad barriers to movement threaten the long-term development of quality higher education in the OPT and, by consequence, Palestinians’ scientific, social, and economic progress.\n\nIn Turkey, many higher education personnel and civil servants remain unable to travel internationally after the government canceled their passports for expressive activity and alleged affiliations with groups disfavored by the government.[69] In July 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared a state of emergency following a violent coup attempt. Under the state of emergency, the government issued a series of decrees that, among other things, sanctioned more than 125,000 civil servants, including academics and other university personnel, accused of having affiliations with Fethullah Gülen, a Muslim cleric who the Turkish government claims coordinated the coup attempt. Among the dismissed were 406 signatories to the Academics for Peace petition, which condemned the Turkish government’s anti-terrorism policies in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of the country and urged state authorities to resume peace negotiations. Faculty and other university personnel named in the decrees were dismissed from their positions, barred from future civil service posts, and put under an international travel ban; spouses of those individuals were also subject to a travel ban. By July 8, 2018, more than 7,500 university personnel had been sanctioned by the emergency decrees. Being named in the decrees has effectively amounted to blacklisting within much of Turkish society.[70] Unable to obtain academic employment (or any state employment) in Turkey or seek overseas academic work, scholars and others targeted by the decrees have described being subjected to a “civil death.” In October 2019, a law was passed that would ostensibly allow dismissed scholars (and other civil servants) to apply for new passports, but scholars have described a burdensome and exceedingly narrow pathway for successfully regaining travel privileges.[71]\n\nHealthy societies require the free movement of scholars, students, and their ideas. Restrictions on academic travel—whether they involve interstate or intrastate travel, denial of exit or entry, or policies that limit the movement of entire classes of higher education personnel—repress and often penalize the international exchange of ideas that is a hallmark of modern academia. SAR calls upon state and international authorities to adopt and respect policies that fully protect the right to academic travel, including the “freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers.”[72] State authorities should not deny scholars and students entry or exit visas, cancel their passports, force their return to their home countries, or otherwise attempt to impede or interfere with academic expression or conduct.\n\nOther\n\nThe enumerated types of attacks discussed above capture the most severe incidents (killings, violence, disappearances; prosecution and imprisonment) and those which, despite the difficulty in documenting them, likely impact large numbers of scholars and students (loss of position/expulsion; travel restrictions). The “other” type captures incidents that do not fall squarely within these but may nevertheless significantly impair higher education functions, academic freedom, and the rights of entire higher education communities. Forms of “other” attacks typically include military raids on and occupations of higher education facilities; damage to or destruction of higher education facilities, often during armed conflict; legislative and administrative actions that erode institutional autonomy; systematic or repeated harassment intended to intimidate and undermine the academic freedom of scholars, students, and other personnel but lacking the overt element of violence or coercion present in the enumerated type discussed earlier; and efforts to restrict or otherwise impede higher education events. Since the Monitoring Project’s inception, SAR has reported 320 “other” incidents, including 67 during this reporting period.\n\nMilitary, paramilitary, or organized criminal groups targeting, occupying, or using higher education facilities during or outside of conflict can disrupt or completely impede education in the short term. This includes the use of weapons in armed conflict to damage or destroy higher education infrastructure as well as the use of higher education facilities as barracks, weapons caches, firing ranges, and interrogation and detention centers.\n\nIn Ethiopia, for example, militants with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) took over and occupied the campus of Wollo University in November 2021, during a period of intense armed conflict with Ethiopian government forces.[73] TPLF forces took over the campus when fighting reached the town of Dessie, located in Ethiopia’s Amhara region. During their occupation, TPLF forces reportedly looted the campus, taking computers, medical equipment, and other items. Images of the university show windows smashed and doors blown out, empty classrooms strewn with trash and debris, and caved-in roofs. Fighting by TPLF forces and government drone strikes targeting the former caused significant damage to university infrastructure. The university’s Vice President Amare Mitiku told reporters that the damage inflicted and looting that occurred amounted to approximately 10 billion Ethiopian birr (equivalent to around $200 million USD).\n\nIn Myanmar, the military continued to occupy higher education facilities since a coup in February 2021.[74] The military raided campuses shortly after the coup, in an apparent effort to remove and deter students and faculty who protested the military and to seize the campuses for strategic purposes. Data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Database Project (ACLED), an NGO based in the United States, showed incidents of military forces stationed on campuses engaging in combat with resistance forces, raising concerns over the safety of civilians, including students and personnel, damage to higher education facilities, and serious disruption to academic activity.[75]\n\nAmidst Russia’s war in Ukraine, Russian forces have launched attacks, including airstrikes and shellings, targeting higher education facilities. Among the institutions that have sustained damage from such attacks are V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University,[76] Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology,[77] Chernihiv Polytechnic National University,[78] Sukhomlynskyi Mykolaiv National University,[79] Admiral Makarov National University of Shipbuilding,[80] O.M. Beketov Kharkiv National University of Urban Economy,[81] and Petro Mohyla Black Sea National University.[82] In Kharkiv alone, military officials reported at least seven higher education institutions suffered damage during the month of March.[83] While civilian casualties were not reported in most of the incidents captured by SAR’s Monitoriing Project, the attacks resulted in substantial damage to campus infrastructure. The Kyiv School of Economics has calculated that Ukrainian higher education institutions suffered roughly $2.648 billion USD in damage since the start of the war.[84]\n\nIn Yemen, Houthi forces stormed the Faculties of Arts and Education of Dhamar University (DU) (also romanized as “Thamar University”) and allegedly assaulted university staff in an effort to seize control of the campus.[85] A Houthi-appointed official in the Dhamar governorate had reportedly ordered Houthi forces to take control of the two faculties’ buildings on grounds that they belonged to the [de-facto] government, not the university. When DU staff attempted to stop the Houthi forces from entering the campus, Houthi forces reportedly assaulted them and detained two university security personnel.\n\nOther incidents include attempts by state and non-state armed groups to silence dissent by simply entering or maintaining a presence on campuses. Such acts undermine the autonomy of the university, academic freedom, and an institution’s ability to function.\n\nIn Ecuador, officers with the National Police repeatedly entered university facilities without authorization, apparently to quell student protests that began in mid-June 2022. On June 21, for example, police entered the Catholic Pontifical University of Ecuador to disperse peaceful student protesters.[86] The police were apparently evicted from the campus, but began launching teargas from the outside. Similar unauthorized encroachments on university spaces were reported at the University of Cuenca[87] and the National Polytechnic School.[88] University officials denounced these encroachments publicly and moved the national Ombudsman’s Office to adopt a resolution that bars national police and armed forces from entering university campuses or firing weapons into them and establishes “peace borders” outside university campuses, to prevent confrontations between state authorities and protesters.[89]\n\nIn the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israeli soldiers carried out an early morning raid on the Birzeit University campus, assaulting guards, damaging university property, confiscating students’ belongings, and sparking violent clashes.[90] According to the university, roughly 100 Israeli soldiers broke through the campus’s main gate around 4:00 AM. Once inside, the soldiers beat and detained several campus guards, removed the Palestinian flag from the center of campus, and conducted raids on three faculties: Science, Graduate Studies, and Pharmacy, Nursing and Health Professions. The raid on these and other campus buildings lasted around two hours, during which some of the contents inside were damaged. Witnesses told Anadolu Agency that the soldiers also “confiscated banners and personal belongings of student [blocs] before leaving campus premises.” The raid preceded a ceremony planned for that day by the Islamic student bloc to mark the founding of Hamas, though the Jerusalem Post later reported that it was unclear whether the soldiers’ actions were connected to the ceremony.[91] Following the raid, clashes reportedly broke out between Israeli soldiers and civilians, including students. Israeli forces fired bullets and tear gas canisters to disperse the civilians.\n\nIn Venezuela, the Bolivarian National Police entered the campus of Central University of Venezuela (UCV) in an apparent effort to disrupt a nonviolent protest.[92] UCV employees had gathered on campus and began marching to protest in connection with an ongoing labor dispute. Shortly thereafter, a group of police arrived on motorcycles. A number of protesters reportedly confronted the police, stating that their presence on campus was a violation of university autonomy and of Venezuelan law. According to available reporting, the confrontations were all nonviolent.\n\nUniversity closures may also constitute attacks when states or higher education leaders forcibly or arbitrarily shut down individual institutions or entire higher education systems to punish, deter, or impede academic speech, content, or conduct, or otherwise to sanction members of the higher education community for their exercise of protected rights. Closures are often linked to student protests or strikes over higher education policies or reforms, or to general public protests or unrest. They are often justified on grounds of protecting individuals and property from harm. Such justifications should be examined for pretext where the real reason for the closure may be to silence dissent, avoid embarrassment of university or state leaders, and exclude or eliminate student leaders. The latter is particularly true when closures are accompanied by dismissals, expulsions, arrests, or prosecutions of scholars and students. But even in circumstances where they are a response to legitimate security concerns and not aimed at restricting expression, closures are an extreme measure which may protect lives and property but fail to protect higher education as an open, functioning space for research, teaching, and learning.\n\nIn Morocco, for example, Ibn Tofaïl University closed its campus and suspended classes for three days, in order to prevent a three-day series of events responding to the “normalizing” of diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel.[93] The events—organized by the the National Student Union of Morocco and students affiliated with the Islamist movement Al Adl Wal Ihsane (“Justice and Charity” or “AWI”)—were to include seminars, an arts festival, and a football tournament. In announcing their decision to close the campus, the university stated that the forum “has a national dimension and is organized in partnership with a non-student body that has nothing to do with the university,” ostensibly referring to AWI.[94] The university also cited the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns arising from “tensions that this meeting could leave within the university.”\n\nThrough the use of legislative and administrative powers, governments have attempted to shut down, exile, seize control of, and undermine the autonomy of higher education institutions.\n\nIn Nicaragua, the National Assembly, allied with President Daniel Ortega, voted to cancel the operating licenses of six private universities.[95] The government accused the universities—along with a number of non-higher education associations whose operating licenses were also canceled —of violating financial disclosure requirements. University officials and others allege that these actions stemmed from protests against the Ortega government in 2018, during which state authorities violently suppressed demonstrators—many of whom were university students—ending in the deaths of more than 350 Nicaraguans. Four of the private universities were merged to form a new state university, while the other two were renamed.[96] These new universities would be overseen by the National Council of Universities and would offer admission to students whose universities were closed down.\n\nIn Ukraine, Russian occupying forces took over the campuses of several Ukrainian higher education institutions, renamed those institutions, and appointed new leadership. On May 27, 2022, for example, it was reported that Russian occupying forces invaded and seized control of Dmytro Motornyi Tavria State Agrotechnological University and Bohdan Khmelnytsky Melitopol State Pedagogical University, and announced that the two universities would be merged into a new “Melitopol State University.”[97] The Russian-installed governor of Zaporizhzhia, where the universities are located, said that the new university would adapt to the system used by the Russian Federation.[98] SAR reported similar developments at Kherson State University,[99] Kherson National Technical University[100] and Kherson State Agrarian and Economic University.[101]\n\nOther attacks may include efforts to cancel or impede participation in lectures, seminars, conferences, or other events hosted by members of the higher education community. These attacks restrict or deter scholarly discussion and the exchange of ideas and information.\n\nIn China, state authorities sought to prevent at least five scholars from attending and participating virtually in the Association for Asian Studies’ (AAS) 2022 Annual Conference.[102] The international conference ran on an in-person/virtual hybrid format from March 24-27, 2022, in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the United States. Several individuals with direct knowledge of the incident informed the US-based National Public Radio that Chinese security and education authorities “directly intervened” in the scholars’ scheduled participation, “citing education regulations published during a global coronavirus pandemic which require all Chinese scholars to receive university permission to attend any international event in-person or online.”[103] In one instance, Chinese police reportedly interrogated one of the scholars for hours at their home after they presented their research paper to an online panel earlier in the week. NPR reported that it “did not touch on subjects which Chinese authorities normally consider sensitive.”[104]\n\nIn India, Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) administration ordered the cancellation of a webinar on Kashmir organized by the university’s Centre for Women’s Studies (CWS), apparently based on political considerations.[105] The webinar, “Gender resistance and fresh challenges in post-2019 Kashmir,” was to feature well-known anthropologist and activist Ather Zia and would draw from and build on Zia’s book, Resisting Disappearance: Military occupation and women’s activism in Kashmir, to assess resistance and dissent in Kashmir in the wake of India’s 2019 repeal of Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 of the Indian constitution. JNU Vice-Chancellor published a statement calling the topic of the webinar “a highly objectionable and provocative subject, which questions the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country” and stated that upon learning of the webinar, the administration “immediately instructed the faculty members organizing the event to cancel it.”[106] Kumar also relayed that the faculty members in charge of the event had not sought the university’s permission to hold it and that the matter was now under investigation.\n\nIn Thailand, Chiang Mai University faculty and administrators prohibited students from exhibiting their theses in the University Art Centre on the grounds that some pieces dealt with social and political themes.[107] The university’s Media Arts and Design Department required that fourth year students publicly exhibit their final theses; however, after determining that some of the work involved political or social themes, the university administration refused to permit the students to use the University Art Centre for that purpose, effectively denying them the ability to meet a program requirement. The students were later granted a temporary injunction by the Chiang Mai Administrative Court, requiring the university to allow them to exhibit their work.\n\nThese “other” attacks are diverse in form and impact, but share with the five types described earlier an intent to punish or control expression and inquiry within the academic community. They have the potential to severely undermine the rights of individual scholars and students and, when targeting entire institutions, they can impede core higher education functions and erode the autonomy universities and colleges need to operate without the undue influence of political actors.\n\nStates, higher education leaders, and civil society should take steps to understand and prevent the range of attacks described here, including by publicly reporting and condemning such attacks and by promoting the importance of academic freedom and institutional autonomy.\n\nStudent Expression\n\nStudent expression and violent responses to the same are featured in many of the incidents reported by SAR’s Monitoring Project, warranting discussion here.\n\nIndividual and organized student expression is an integral part of the higher education process and an important contributor to public discourse generally. Incidents involving student expression are connected to a variety of issues, including the rising cost of tuition, education policy, police brutality, sexual assault, and government reforms. Students bring attention to these issues through marches, sit-ins, petitions, vigils, and other forms of on- and off-campus expression.\n\nTheir right to do so is protected under international human rights standards relating to academic freedom, freedom of expression, freedoms of assembly and association, and the right to education. Despite these protections, state and institutional actors frequently restrict and retaliate against student expression through the use of violent force, detentions, and coercive legal and disciplinary actions. Beyond violating internationally recognized human rights and endangering members of the campus community, attacks on student expression chill the learning environment and limit the free inquiry and expression required for open, democratically legitimate societies.\n\nDuring this reporting period, SAR reported more than 130 student expression–related incidents that directly impacted many hundreds of students and other victims. The vast majority of these attacks involve the use of violence, arrests, prosecutions, suspensions, and expulsions targeting students. For example, in Guinea, police fired tear gas and arrested students, including the head of a student association from the Gamal Abdel Nasser University of Conakry during a peaceful protest demanding improved conditions, including student transportation services.[108] In Indonesia, the administration of the State Islamic Institute Ambon took disciplinary and legal actions against a student news publication, known as Lintas, and its student staff members in response to the publication of a special edition regarding sexual harassment allegations on campus.[109] In Sudan, shortly after the start of a military coup, soldiers raided a dormitory at the University of Khartoum, where they used force against students in an apparent effort to deter anti-coup protest activities.[110] One student reported that the soldiers confiscated students’ mobile phones, used whips against them, and ordered them to leave the dormitory; another student reported that soldiers shaved his head. In Caracas, Venezuela, a group of individuals posing as students, who were in fact party members loyal to the regime of Nicolás Maduro, physically attacked a group of students holding an anti-government protest on the steps of Venezuela Central University.[111] In Yemen, Houthi forces, called on by the Sana’a University administration (under Houthi command) to quell an on-campus student demonstration, beat student protesters and arrested an unspecified number of them.[112] Medical students had gathered inside a building on campus to demand the postponement of final exams. Video posted to Twitter shows Houthi forces pushing students to move down a hallway, and students can be heard yelling and crying. Students reported that they were threatened with weapons and that a number of them were arrested.\n\nA minority of incidents involve some students—often subsets of a broader group—engaging in physical violence directed at fellow students, higher education personnel, or campus facilities. In Bangladesh, for example, alleged members of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the country’s ruling party, attacked female students holding a protest on the Sylhet Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) campus.[113] The protesters were demanding the removal of a residence hall provost for allegedly being dismissive of their concerns over the behavior of the hall’s security guards. Several students were reportedly injured in the attack on the protest. In South Africa, students reportedly set fire to a building and damaged a library at Durban University of Technology (DUT) during a protest over financial aid allowances and residence hall conditions.[114] DUT closed its Steve Biko, M.L. Sultan, and Ritson campuses and asked students to vacate as a result.\n\nRegardless of the type of perpetrator, the frequency and severity of incidents involving student expression underscore the importance and vulnerability of student expression around the world. (Indeed, student expression incidents constitute roughly 41% of the incidents SAR reported this year, although this may reflect in part greater visibility and reporting on attacks on students relative to other attacks.) Understanding student expression—its forms, presence around the globe, and significance to education and society—and working to protect it is essential to ensuring quality higher education that provides the maximum societal benefit.\n\nSAR condemns violent and coercive attacks against students, from whatever source. SAR urges governments and higher education leaders to ensure that security officials, both state and private, exercise restraint and respond to student expression and protest activities in an appropriate and proportional manner, focused on de-escalation and consistent with recognized international human rights standards. States should not use weapons when responding to nonviolent student expression.[115] If force is necessary, as a last resort to maintain safety, it must be proportionate and limited, so as to reduce unnecessary risk of harm to protesting students and others. State authorities must further ensure appropriate protections for nonviolent student expression—especially when on a campus or in an academic setting. SAR calls on state authorities to immediately release students in custody and drop any charges that stem from their peaceful academic or expressive activity. SAR urges higher education leaders to refrain from taking disciplinary actions against students in retaliation for or to restrict nonviolent student expression, inquiry, assembly, or association.\n\nSAR also calls on students engaged in expressive activity, on or off campus, to do so consistent with higher education values and human rights principles. This includes abstaining from using physical violence to advance the objectives of student expression. Members of higher education communities and civil society should commit to respecting the campus space, both physical and virtual, as a safe, free space, where ideas can be expressed and debated without fear of physical harm or undue restriction.\n\n[1] Robert Quinn, “Academic Self-Censorship Is a ‘Brain Drag’ on Arab Universities and Societies,” Al-Fanar Media, April 18, 2021, www.al-fanarmedia.org/2021/04/academic-self-censorship-is-a-brain-drag-on-arab-universities-and-societies/.\n\n[2] SAR AFMP, November 10, 2021, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2021-11-10-university-of-buea/.\n\n[3] SAR AFMP, January 10, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-01-10-nigerian-army-university-biu/.\n\n[4] “Boko Haram Attacks Tukur Buratai War Institute In Borno, Kills Two Workers, Burns Vehicles,” Sahara Reporters, January 12, 2022, saharareporters.com/2022/01/12/boko-haram-attacks-tukur-buratai-war-institute-borno-kills-two-workers-burns-vehicles/.\n\n[5] SAR AFMP, April 26, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-04-26-university-of-karachi/.\n\n[6] Sophia Saifi, Saleem Mehsud, and Azaz Syed, “Female suicide bomber behind Karachi attack that killed 3 Chinese citizens: police,” CNN, April 27, 2022, www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/asia/pakistan-karachi-blast-chinese-nationals-killed-intl-hnk/index.html.\n\n[7] SAR AFMP, November 12, 2021, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2021-11-12-ghazni-university/.\n\n[8] SAR AFMP, May 12, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-05-12-shehu-shagari-college-of-education-sokoto/.\n\n[9] SAR AFMP, June 6, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-06-06-university-of-antioquia/.\n\n[10] SAR AFMP, May 10, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-05-10-lucknow-university/.\n\n[11] “Dalit professor alleges attack by student on Lucknow University campus,” Hindustan Times, May 18, 2022, https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dalit-professor-alleges-attack-by-student-on-lucknow-university-campus-101652897154086.html.\n\n[12] SAR AFMP, March 24, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-03-24-queens-university-belfast/.\n\n[13] United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, “Attacks against human rights advocate threaten academic freedom in Northern Ireland – UN experts,” March 24, 2022, www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/attacks-against-human-rights-advocate-threaten-academic-freedom-northern.\n\n[14] SAR AFMP, April 12, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-04-12-university-of-mbandaka/.\n\n[15] SAR AFMP, June 16, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2022-06-16-national-university-of-lesotho/.\n\n[16] SAR AFMP, September 23, 2021, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2021-09-23-abia-state-polytechnic/.\n\n[17] Even if they were narrowly drafted, limited in use, and conscientiously applied through fair and transparent legal proceedings fully compliant with recognized human rights standards, such laws would still impose a significant chill on academic freedom, freedom of expression, and other rights.

It is unclear how many dismissed academics have successfully appealed and are eligible for new passports. Scholars may be acquitted of one charge (e.g., membership with a Gülen–affiliated organization) only to be charged with another (e.g., membership in a terrorist organization), thus making them ineligible for a new passport. Those eligible may also face a lengthy, opaque process applying to Turkey’s Passport Commission, which may base their decision on the advice of prosecutors, police, and the university from which they were dismissed.\n\n[72] See Article 19 in “International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,” December 19, 1966, www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx.\n\n[73] SAR AFMP, November 1, 2022, www.scholarsatrisk.org/report/2021-11-01-wollo-university/.\n\n[74] See reports of military forces occupying higher education facilities: Khin Yi Yi Zaw, “Three resistance fighters killed as serious battles rage in Kalay, Sagaing Region,” Myanmar Now, August 7, 2022, myanmar-now.org/en/news/three-resistance-fighters-killed-as-serious-battles-rage-in-kalay-sagaing-region; “The Impacts of Attacks on Education and Military Use in Myanmar,” Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, September 9, 2022, protectingeducation.org/wp-content/uploads/ImpactofAttacksMyanmar2022.pdf.\n\n[75] Readers can access the data on ACLED’s website, here: acleddata.com/data-export-tool/.

They violate the rights of those targeted and they have the potential to limit academic freedom and the right to education for large numbers of scholars and students at higher education institutions worldwide. Countries and territories suffering from heightened attacks and pressures warrant the attention of the international community.\n\nIn this edition of Free to Think, SAR reported 391 attacks on higher education communities in 65 countries and territories around the world, from September 2021 to August 2022. In this section, SAR examines diverse, country-level developments and trends from this reporting period. These include patterns of attacks found in SAR’s Monitoring Project data, such as arrests and disciplinary actions targeting scholars or repeated violations of students’ right to peacefully assemble and express themselves. They also include particular events, novel pressures, or under-discussed phenomena reported by the media and other groups that threaten academic freedom and related values for entire higher education communities, such as restrictive legislative and administrative actions, threats to university governance, or pervasive sexual harassment on campus. This year’s Monitoring Project data[1] show attacks in societies generally considered to be open and with functioning democracies, like South Korea and the United Kingdom, as well as in closed societies with more authoritative governments, like Belarus and Thailand. Countries and territories not highlighted in Free to Think 2022 are not necessarily free of attacks on higher education communities or restraints on academic freedom. Given resource constraints and challenges in gathering and verifying information, this report features only a representative sample of the global state of attacks on higher education.\n\nReaders interested in learning more about attacks on higher education and academic freedom conditions around the world are encouraged to review national-level incident data on SAR’s website[2] and country-level expert assessments in the Academic Freedom Index,[3] a tool co-developed by the Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi), the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), the V-Dem Institute, and SAR.[4] SAR invites readers to contribute information on attacks on higher education communities wherever and whenever they occur.[5] By building a more comprehensive dataset, SAR can more effectively expose this global phenomenon and work with governments, higher education communities, and civil society to protect higher education from attack and to promote academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and related higher education values.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nIn Afghanistan, the higher education community has suffered devastating attacks and setbacks following the Taliban’s takeover of the country in August 2021, from targeted actions against scholars and students to policies and practices seeking to conform the higher education sector to its vision and priorities.\n\nThese include targeted actions against scholars in connection with their expressive activity, views, and identity. Sayed Asif Mubtahij Hashemi, the Dean of Faculty of Sharia Law at Ghazni University was found dead roughly three months after he was abducted by armed assailants believed to be affiliated with the Taliban.[6] One lawyer believed that Hashemi could have been targeted for his liberal ideas and anti-extremist interpretations of religious texts. In two separate incidents, the Taliban detained two scholars critical of their rule, Faizullah Jalal and Sayed Baqir Mohsini.[7] At Alberoni University, a professor fearing violent attacks resigned from his position of 14 years after he was accused of blasphemy in connection with comments he allegedly made on WhatsApp; the same scholar was reportedly critical of Taliban policies.[8] Taliban authorities ordered the dismissal of 50 professors and 8 administrative and financial staff at Balkh University, apparently due to their ethnic identities—53 of them were non-Pashtun—and allegedly planned to replace them with clerics and members of the Taliban.[9]\n\nIn addition to targeting and punishing individual members of the higher education community, the Taliban have constricted female scholars’ and students’ academic freedom and right to education. One of the earliest policies was a requirement that higher education institutions enforce gender segregated classes.[10] At Kabul University and Kabul Polytechnic University, the Taliban ordered the administrations to schedule “shifts” in university access, such that female students would be barred entry on days that male students are in attendance and vice-versa.[11] Female professors are further barred from teaching male students and attending meetings with male counterparts.[12] In April 2022, the Taliban instructed universities to further enforce gender segregation at scientific conferences and programs.[13] Taliban forces have also reportedly refused female student entry to campus, including for wearing colorful hijabs.[14] Taliban authorities reportedly interrogated and detained women who protested an event they were invited to attend at Bamyan University.[15] The event was allegedly supposed to focus on reopening educational opportunities for women and girls; attendees instead found the event space decorated with pro-Taliban banners and an agenda focused on unfreezing Afghan assets.\n\nIn addition to restricting the rights of women currently enrolled in or working at higher education institutions, the Taliban have enacted policies that threaten to eliminate university education for future generations of female students. This includes the Taliban’s continued denial of secondary school education for girls after more than one year in power and despite proclamations that they would ensure them access to schooling.[16] Without high school graduation certificates, women are effectively barred from pursuing higher education.[17] Furthermore, in March 2022, the Taliban instructed airlines to prevent women from flying without a male chaperone, a decision that could make it nearly impossible for women to access higher education or academic opportunities abroad.[18]\n\nThe Taliban has also taken steps to reinforce religious education at universities.
