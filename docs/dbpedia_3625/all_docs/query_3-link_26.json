        "text": "December 21, 2004 Ankara Pleased With Outcome of EU Summit, Date for Accession Talks Washington, D.C. - Characterizing the EU summit’s decision to begin accession talks with Turkey in October 2005 as placing the “reconciliation of civilizations between Christianity and Islam” on a “concrete base,” Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara did not receive 100 percent of the terms it had requested from the EU for the start of the talks, but he described the outcome of the summit as “a success.” He vowed to press forward with reforms as Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey had “entered a period of permanent stability” following the decision. The issue of Ankara’s refusal to recognize EU member Cyprus, a stumbling block that nearly derailed negotiations at the December 16-17 summit in Brussels over the terms for offering a date for talks, was resolved when Turkey agreed to sign a protocol extending its customs union agreement with the EU to all 10 new member countries, including Cyprus, before the October 3 launching of the talks. While the EU would view such a move as the de facto recognition of Cyprus, Erdogan stated that the extension of the agreement to include Nicosia would be a “technical procedure” and would be “in no way a recognition” of Cyprus. Gul asserted that it would be “out of the question” for Turkey to sign any bilateral protocol with the “Greek Cypriot administration.” Turkey has repeatedly stated that it would only grant recognition to a new political entity that might result from a comprehensive settlement for the reunification of Cyprus. Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos said the outcome of the summit satisfied the demands of the Cyprus government “to a great extent” and “achieved what was feasible under the circumstances” with regard to the recognition issue. He described the decision concerning the customs union agreement as a “significant first step forward,” noting that it “brings about normalization, at least in the stages that it covers,” with respect to matters such as the free movement of persons and goods. Papadopoulos made clear that, if Turkey reneged on its commitment to sign the protocol by October 3, the Cyprus government “has the right to not agree to the initiation of accession talks” for Turkey at that time. With differences between Turkey and Greece concerning the Aegean Sea in mind, the presidency conclusions issued at the summit also “welcomed the improvement in Turkey’s relations with its neighbours and its readiness to continue to work with the concerned Member States towards resolution of outstanding border disputes,” while also welcoming “the exploratory contacts to this end.” In addition, the text said “unresolved disputes having repercussions on the accession process should if necessary be brought to the International Court of Justice for settlement.” Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis maintained that Greece had achieved all of its objectives at the summit, noting that the clear European framework of rules governing Turkey’s actions would lead to “further normalization of Greek-Turkish relations.” In response to the concern of certain EU countries that Turkish workers could flood the labor markets of member nations or that Turkey’s large agricultural sector could burden the bloc’s finances, the presidency conclusions stated that “long transition periods, derogations, specific arrangements, or permanent safeguard clauses . . . which are permanently available as a basis for safeguard measures, may be considered.” The conclusions said that “transitional arrangements or safeguards should be reviewed regarding their impact on competition or the functioning of the internal market.” Although the conclusions retained the stipulation that membership talks would be “an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand,” a phrase opposed by the Turkish government, Ankara was pleased that “accession” was designated as “the shared objective of the negotiations.” In addition, the conclusions stated that, if Ankara “is not in a position to assume in full all the obligations of membership, it must be ensured that [Turkey] is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible bond.” The conclusions also noted that, in the event of “a serious and persistent breach in . . . the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law” in Turkey, the Commission would “on its own initiative or on the request of one-third of the Member States, recommend the suspension of negotiations and propose the conditions for eventual resumption.” The text said the European Commission would continue to closely monitor and report on Turkey’s progress toward the irreversibility of the political reform process and the full implementation of reforms, particularly those regarding fundamental freedoms and full respect of human rights, including a “zero-tolerance policy relating to torture and ill-treatment.” U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, welcoming the EU’s decision on Turkey’s accession talks, said the move reflected “Turkey’s impressive reform accomplishments” and was “a great success for both Turkey and the EU.” Washington is “confident that the accession process and Turkey’s eventual membership in the European Union will bring great benefits to Turkey and the EU,” he stated. Powell added that “a Turkey that is firmly anchored in Europe and sharing European values will be a positive force for prosperity and democracy” and will be “good for Turkey, for the broader European region, and for the United States.” Both France and Austria said they would hold referenda on Turkey’s accession following the conclusion of membership talks, which are expected to last at least 10 years. With opinion polls in Austria indicating that only 28 percent of Austrians favor Turkey’s entry, the EU nation currently most opposed to its membership, Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel said he would push for an EU-wide referendum. December 17, 2004 EU Offers Negotiation Date to Turkey, with Cyprus Recognition Issue Presenting Greatest Hurdle Washington, D.C. - At their December 16-17 summit in Brussels, European Union leaders agreed to begin accession talks with Turkey on October 3, 2005, but Ankara’s approval of the terms of the EU's offer was stalled by differences over the issue of Turkey'’s recognition of Cyprus. EU and Turkish officials worked together to re-write the Cyprus portion of the bloc's proposal in order to reach a compromise on a timetable for this recognition. The EU had wanted Turkey to initial an agreement at the summit that would extend its existing customs union with the EU to include the 10 new member states that joined the bloc in May, including Cyprus. EU officials said the agreement could then be signed before accession talks begin, a move that would amount to de facto acknowledgement of the country. Turkey rejected this proposal, saying that recognition of Cyprus, either directly or indirectly, was \"out of the question.\" It has said, in the past, that it will only recognize the political entity that emerges from a Cyprus settlement under the auspices of the United Nations. Turkey offered a statement of intent that it will sign an accord acknowledging Cyprus before the accession talks begin. The EU also urged Turkey to continue its reforms, stipulating tough monitoring and inspections to ensure that Ankara carries out its promises on free speech, an end to torture, and other human rights reform. The membership talks will be \"open-ended,\" meaning that they will not automatically lead to membership, although that will be the goal. If the talks fail to result in full membership, the EU will ensure that Turkey \"is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible bond.\" Negotiations may be stopped if Turkey backslides on completing the reforms required for membership. December 10, 2004 Countdown to Summit Decision on Accession Talks Washington, D.C. - As the debate continued over suggestions primarily by European conservatives that Turkey be offered a partnership with Brussels that would fall short of full EU membership, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted on three conditions for the expected decision at the December 16-17 EU summit that membership talks begin: the EU had to offer Turkey full membership, a clear starting date for the negotiations, and no further criteria to be fulfilled. \"Turkey has met all political conditions\" for starting talks, Erdogan said. In a joint statement, Turkey's political and military leaders said, \"It is the just expectation of the Turkish nation that the EU member countries decide to open negotiations in 2005 without delay or [new] conditions, with the aim of Turkey's membership in the Union.\" The statement added, \"It is a requirement under the EU's obligations toward Turkey that the EU clearly preserves our membership perspective . . . without creating any doubts.\" European Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn stated that, if the EU decides to begin accession talks with Turkey, \"the clear aim is membership if the conditions for it are met,\" adding that \"there is no Plan B.\" He noted that the EU had officially considered Turkey to be part of Europe since 1963, when it concluded its association agreement with Ankara, and Turkey had been a candidate for membership since 1999, giving the bloc little choice but to honor its commitment to move the country toward accession. \"We have the responsibility to accept the country as a member if it fulfills the criteria,\" Rehn said. European Parliament President Josep Borrell Fontelles, during a visit to Turkey, which included meetings with non-governmental organizations, representatives of non-Muslim religious groups, and local officials and civic bodies in the primarily Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, stated that Ankara should be aware that \"public opinion in Europe is currently against Turkey's becoming an EU member immediately.\" He said he believed European countries would \"make a better decision after they learn more\" about the country through the long pre-accession process, noting that he believed entry talks should begin during the first half of 2005. The EU, he said, will strengthen Turkey's political and economic ties, which will, in turn, strengthen democratic values and human rights. \"A stable and prosperous Turkey is necessary for stability and peace in the Middle East,\" he asserted. A second draft of the presidency conclusions prepared by the EU's Dutch presidency for the summit, according to leaks to the press, states that the screening process comparing Turkish laws to those of the EU will begin in April 2005, with accession negotiations beginning in October. The draft also reportedly suggests that EU member states can hold referenda on whether to accept Turkey into the bloc. In addition, in an apparent reference to the disputes in the Aegean between Ankara and Athens, the document states that the bilateral problems Turkey has with neighboring countries should be resolved through the International Court of Justice in The Hague if the problems have an effect on the country's accession course. It also removes the stipulation that a minimum vote of one-third of the member states would be required to endorse a suspension of the talks if Turkey backtracked on its reform process, while mentioning that the European Commission will report regularly on Turkey's progress toward a zero-tolerance policy concerning the torture and ill treatment of detainees. Two weeks before the summit, the Turkish parliament approved the criminal procedure bill, which the European Commission, in its October 6 report on Ankara's progress toward meeting EU criteria, had said must be passed prior to the summit. The new law, to go into effect on April 1, 2005, includes provisions that establish a judicial police to handle the interrogation of suspects, grant suspects the right to have a lawyer present during an interrogation, place limits on the period suspects can be detained, and deal with police searches and the tapping of telephones. Angela Merkel, the head of Germany's conservative opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), intensified her public opposition to Turkey's candidacy for EU membership by asserting that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was not being honest about the risks for the EU posed by Turkish membership and accusing him of \"self-deception\" in his support for Ankara's entry. She maintained that the key issue was whether Turkey could be integrated into the EU, noting that attempts to build a multi-cultural society in Germany that integrated the Turks already living in the country had failed. \"The EU with Turkey will be a new EU,\" she said, adding that \"the degree of European integration achieved over 50 years must not be thrown away.\" Turkey's geopolitical importance, she said, is not a reason for it to be admitted to the EU. Merkel and Edmund Stoiber, the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), wrote to Schroeder urging him to block the start of EU entry talks with Turkey and begin supporting a privileged partnership between the EU and Ankara instead of full membership. They asserted that Turkey's accession would \"overstretch\" the EU. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende sent a letter to Merkel expressing his objection to her campaign for a privileged partnership. He ruled out the likelihood of offering such a partnership at the summit since it would constitute a \"change of game rules in an ongoing game.\" In recent months, the CDU's overwhelming lead in polls over Schroeder's Social Democrats has diminished from 50 percent in March to 38 percent, with Schroeder's party reaching 32 percent, up from a low of 23 percent during the summer. At the CDU's annual congress on December 7, the party's leaders raised the possibility that, if the party wins the parliamentary elections in 2006, a CDU-led government could stall Turkey's membership talks by delaying the endorsement of individual chapters Turkey must conclude, corresponding to the 31 policy areas into which EU law is divided, on its way to membership. French President Jacques Chirac has signaled that he may insist that the possibility of a status for Turkey other than full membership be included in the presidency conclusions in case talks fail, a proposal backed by Austria and Denmark, but he has said that he does not want the expression \"privileged partnership\" to be present in the conclusions. Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini said Turkey will be sacrificed to Islamic fundamentalism if it is not brought into the European Union, noting that the EU should consider what it will cost the bloc if Turkey does not become a member, \"instead of raising concern over what Turkey's membership could lead to.\" Prime Minister Erdogan pledged that his government would remove any remaining obstacles to religious freedom in Turkey as he inaugurated a complex called the Garden of Religions, which includes a mosque, a church partitioned into Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox sections, and a synagogue, in the Mediterranean resort of Belek, near Antalya. It will mainly serve foreigners vacationing in the region. The inauguration was made possible after Turkey, in preparation for EU membership, changed laws that restricted the opening of places of worship other than mosques. Dutch Minister for European Affairs Atzo Nicolai, who attended the ceremony, urged Turkey to decrease \"state intervention in worship.\" Turkey is currently engaged in a dispute over the status of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Istanbul-based spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians. Turkey has long refused to accept any international role for the patriarch and argues that he is only the spiritual leader of Istanbul's dwindling Orthodox community. December 10, 2004 Raging Debate Over Cyprus Recognition Washington, D.C. - In a letter to the Dutch EU presidency, the Turkish government stipulated that it would extend recognition to the political entity that is established through a settlement to the Cyprus problem, and not to the current Republic of Cyprus, stressing Ankara's commitment to finding a \"mutually acceptable settlement.\" The Turkish Cypriot prime minister, Mehmet Ali Talat, echoing Ankara's view, said it was out of the question for the Turkish government to recognize anything but a Turkish Cypriot-Greek Cypriot partnership government that would be established as a result of settlement negotiations. \"Ankara will recognize only the ‘new Cyprus' and nothing else,\" Talat stated, adding that there was no single government in Cyprus that currently represented the entire territory and its two peoples. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in an interview, talked about the possibility that Turkey would suspend the EU membership process if Brussels insisted upon introducing new conditions such as the recognition of the \"Greek Cypriot government\" as the government of all of Cyprus. Both Erdogan and Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said the demand that Turkey recognize Cyprus was \"unjust\" in view of the Turkish Cypriot endorsement of the Annan plan in the April referendum and its rejection by the Greek Cypriots. \"We believe that the question of Cyprus will find a solution in the U.N.,\" Erdogan said, adding that \"only the U.N. can ask us to recognize Cyprus, and this has nothing to do with the European Union.\" Stating that Turkey believed that the EU had \"made a mistake\" in admitting Cyprus, Erdogan said Ankara did not want to discuss the recognition issue before or during the summit, asserting that it would be addressed after the summit. Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende of the Netherlands, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, urged Turkey to make a move toward recognizing Cyprus before the summit. He stated during a visit to Nicosia that the Ankara agreement, which, in 1995, established the Turkey-EU customs union, \"is possibly the cornerstone to finding solutions\" to the issue of the recognition of all EU member states by Turkey. He said \"the element of the Ankara agreement could really help\" in the direction of solving the Cyprus problem, which \"is not part of the Copenhagen criteria [for EU membership] but we all want to take steps which could lead to starting to improve the situation.\" Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos said the reference in the presidency conclusions to Turkey's expected extension of the Ankara agreement to cover all new member states did not sufficiently address the recognition issue. He asserted that the conclusions should contain a specific reference to normalizing relations between Ankara and Nicosia. The Cyprus government is attempting to convince the EU that recognition of all new member states is a precondition for starting Turkey's accession talks required by the acquis communautaire, the body of EU laws. European Parliament President Josep Borrell Fontelles, during a visit to Ankara, appealed to Turkey to recognize Cyprus. \"In order to negotiate and hold talks with somebody, one has to recognize that person . . . and, therefore, negotiating with the EU implies negotiating with Cyprus and recognizing Cyprus,\" Fontelles said. He added that this recognition is not something \"that should be done before these negotiations are opened, but this is implied.\" Also on a visit to Ankara, Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht stated that the recognition of Cyprus was not a precondition for opening talks with Turkey, but it was evident that the problem had to be solved. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said he hoped that it would not be necessary for Turkey's recognition of Cyprus to become one of the main issues at the summit. Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said, \"Turkey's failure to recognize the Republic of Cyprus and the presence of Turkish occupation troops in its northern sector are a paradox that is incompatible with the philosophy and the institutional and political reality that are entailed in how the European family functions.\" December 10, 2004 Putin's Visit Envisions Strategic Cooperation in Security, Energy, Trade Sectors Washington, D.C. - During a landmark visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Turkey, the first ever by a leader of Russia, Ankara and Moscow pledged to expand bilateral cooperation in the counter-terrorism, defense, and trade and economic sectors, while also considering the construction of a new pipeline that would enhance Turkey's role as a link between Russian oil and gas resources and Western markets. The visit by Putin, accompanied by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, and Industry and Energy Minister Victor Khristenko, reflects a transformation in relations between the two countries, which have competed for influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia for centuries, but have dramatically strengthened economic ties since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Putin said he would like \"to especially underscore that the two countries' approaches on the struggle against terrorism are identical,\" while they also have similar views on the Caucasus, Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Middle East peace process. He stated that he would like to thank Turkish officials \"for the moral and political support they have extended to Russia's struggle against terrorism.\" Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer told Putin that Turkey was determined to cooperate with Russia in the fight against terror. The two leaders signed a declaration committing their countries to joint efforts against terrorism through bilateral \"consultation and cooperation mechanisms.\" The Russian leader expressed satisfaction with the position on Chechnya taken by Turkey, which recently passed a law that effectively bans private charities from sending funds to Chechnya. The week before Putin arrived in Turkey, Turkish authorities arrested nine suspected Chechen militants and three pro-Chechen Turks that police said had links to al Qaeda. Ivanov called on Ankara to take further steps to capture suspected Chechen militants that may be in Turkey and hand them over to Moscow if apprehended. Russia has, in the past, accused Ankara of tolerating the activities of Chechen rebels on its territory and failing to prevent Turkish citizens from joining their ranks. Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul told Ivanov that Turkey would like Moscow to declare the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) a terrorist organization. Ivanov stated that the issue was under consideration by Russia. Turkey has long maintained that PKK militants receive safe haven in Russia. Gonul also discussed questions concerning maintaining stability in Georgia with Ivanov. Putin told Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Moscow was interested in defense and energy privatization tenders in Turkey, particularly a stalled tender for the privatization of the state-owned oil refinery, Tupras. Russia is also focusing on tenders for the modernization of the Turkish military, with Putin lobbying Ankara to buy attack helicopters from a joint venture between the Russian Kamov Company and Israeli Aircraft Industries. Bilateral trade rose by 60 percent to $4.6 billion during the first half of 2004, compared to the same period in 2003, a figure that might exceed $10 billion for all of 2004 and could reach $25 billion in a few years. Turkey has a deficit in its trade with Russia resulting primarily from the purchase of Russian natural gas through the Blue Stream pipeline, which runs under the Black Sea. Fifteen years ago, bilateral trade was only $200 million. Turkey attracts more than a million Russian tourists each year, and Russia is Turkey's largest trading partner after Germany. Putin stated that Turkey could be a transit country for Russian energy resources to other markets. While Turkey now imports 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia annually, Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, is seeking to expand its distribution network to transport gas from the Blue Stream pipeline to areas of Turkey outside Istanbul and Ankara, and eventually on to Israel. In addition, Russia is researching Turkey's potential for underground gas storage. Turkish Energy Minister Hilmi Guler said Turkey would increase the amount of gas it purchases from Russia, while Khristenko expressed Russia's desire to help Ankara build a nuclear energy plant. At a time when the U.S.-backed Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, running from the capital of Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, is nearing completion, Turkish and Russian officials discussed the potential for an alternative pipeline for the transport of Russian oil to Western markets that would bypass the congested Turkish straits. Having not yet agreed on a route for such a pipeline, they said talks on the matter would continue. Guler said Turkey preferred a route from the Black Sea city of Samsun to Ceyhan. Russia would like a pipeline to run from the Black Sea through Thrace in northwestern Turkey to the Aegean Sea. During Putin's visit, in addition to the agreement on counter-terrorism, Turkey and Russia concluded several agreements establishing cooperation in finance, energy, and defense, which included provisions for preventing incidents at sea between the two countries' navies and for a commitment to the safety of navigation in the Turkish straits, a major outlet for Russian oil. Turkish officials said they were disposed toward supporting Russia's bid to obtain observer status in the 57-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). December 3, 2004 Final Stretch to Decision on EU Accession Talks Washington, D.C. - Several weeks before the December 16-17 EU summit in Brussels, where it is widely believed that Turkey will be given the green light to begin accession talks by October 2005, the European debate on Turkey's candidacy centered on whether Ankara should be granted full membership or an alternative partnership with the bloc, the call for Turkey to recognize Cyprus, and the human rights and political reforms that remain to be legislated and implemented in the country. A first draft of the presidency conclusions of the summit, prepared by the Dutch presidency and leaked to the press, says there is no guarantee that the open-ended process of the negotiations will eventually lead to membership, while Turkey's entry, if it is granted, cannot take place until 2015 at the earliest, since no financial provisions for a Turkish accession can be made before the budget cycle starting in 2014. The document also states that restrictions might be applied to the free movement of the Turkish labor force within the EU. In an apparent reference to Turkey's talks with Greece to resolve longstanding Aegean disputes, the document states that the EU welcomes Turkey's commitment to good relations with neighboring countries and its readiness to continue to work with member states for a solution to \"pending border differences.\" There is considerable public opposition to Turkey's EU membership in France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands, countries with sizable Muslim immigrant populations and right-wing parties that are eager to exploit immigration issues in upcoming electoral campaigns. While Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul reiterated the government's firm position that it would agree to \"no alternative\" to full membership in the EU, advocates for a \"privileged partnership\" between Ankara and the bloc continued to step forward. Former French president Valery Giscard D'Estaing, the chief architect of the EU's constitution, publicly announced his support for a privileged partnership. D'Estaing asserted that Turkey's accession to the EU would require the drafting of another constitution to replace the one awaiting ratification, which \"was not conceived to welcome in a national power the size of Turkey\" and would need to be amended to include limits on the influence of new member countries with large populations. He noted that Turkey's population was expected to reach 89 million by 2024, which would represent 15 percent of the EU's population and would give it 96 deputies out of 750 in the European Parliament and a dominant voice in the Council of Ministers. Despite French President Jacques Chirac's support for Turkey's full membership, French Economy and Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who was elected on November 28 to the chairmanship of Chirac's governing Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), continued to express his opposition to Turkey's membership and his support for a privileged partnership. Sarkozy is expected to run as a presidential candidate against Chirac in 2007. Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel said that, if EU leaders set a date for Turkey's accession talks at the summit, the presidency conclusions must state that these talks could lead to a status for Turkey that falls short of full EU membership. Schuessel said, \"We want to have control over our labor market. This alone means that we will need a different concept that the full membership we know today.\" A September poll indicated that 76 percent of Austrians were against membership talks for Turkey. Germany's conservative opposition, the Christian Democratic Union, favored in recent opinion polls though parliamentary elections are not anticipated until 2006, continues to push for a privileged partnership rather than full accession, while Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder supports full membership. A reference to a privileged partnership for Turkey was reportedly voted out of the draft of the presidency conclusions. In addition, the document does not include a start date for accession talks. Following Gul's November 24 meeting in The Hague with the new European Commissioner for Enlargement, Olli Rehn, and the foreign ministers of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which will assume the EU presidency in January, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot dismissed the idea that the EU develop an alternative to full membership for Ankara. He also said accession talks were unlikely to begin before the second half of 2005, during Britain's presidency, since a screening of Turkish laws was expected to take place during the first half of the year to check their compatibility with EU legislation. Bot stated that there was still no consensus among EU countries on whether Turkey has fulfilled the membership criteria for accession and recommended that Ankara accelerate reforms in the weeks leading up to the summit. He said the EU wanted Turkey to obtain parliamentary approval for laws on criminal procedures and the judicial police before the summit, legislation that the European Commission's October 6 report had said was still pending. Bot noted that the situation concerning the rights of non-Muslim minorities in Turkey continued to be \"a serious source of concern\" and that four key laws, including one enacting a new penal code, had been adopted by parliament but had not yet gone into effect. In addition, Bot said the EU hoped the issue of recognizing Cyprus would be settled before accession talks begin. In Italy, a strong supporter of Turkey's entry into the EU, the parliament held a debate on December 3 concerning its membership. In addition, one of the parties in the governing coalition, the Northern Union Party, said it would organize a protest rally against Turkey's accession two days after the EU summit concludes that would emphasize the \"Christian roots of Europe.\" Turkey is continuing its contacts with European officials to promote the setting of a date at the summit for talks. The first two days of December included a trip by Gul to Slovenia to meet with Foreign Minister Ivo Vajgl, and meetings in Ankara between Gul and European Parliament President Josep Borrell Fontelles and Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht. December 3, 2004 Cyprus Recognition Looms as Stumbling Block with EU Washington, D.C. - According to media reports, a first draft of the presidency conclusions of the December EU summit indicates that the bloc will not directly call on Ankara to recognize Cyprus. Instead, it will prod Turkey to proceed with its stated decision to extend its customs union agreement with the EU to all member states, including Cyprus, which would constitute de facto recognition of the Cyprus government as being sovereign over the entire island. No deadline is set for this recognition. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he found it \"hard to understand and hard to explain\" why the EU was pressuring Turkey concerning this issue, stating that both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots had promoted the reunification of Cyprus by supporting the Annan plan, while the Greek Cypriots had rejected the plan. \"We have done our best in order to find a solution on the island,\" Erdogan said, adding that it was now the Greek Cypriots' turn \"to take a step.\" Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, stating that Turkey is \"not the reason for the problem that the European Union is now facing\" with regard to the recognition issue, said Turkey would consider demands to recognize Cyprus after accession talks begin. The recognition of Cyprus by Turkey could result in a political backlash against the Erdogan government since many Turks consider the matter to be a national issue. This recognition would necessitate ending Turkey's 21-year policy of being the sole country to recognize the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos said his government was not against the start of Ankara's accession talks, but Turkey \"must comply with all its obligations toward the Union as well as Cyprus.\" Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Giorgios Koumoutsakos, stating that Athens still backed Turkey's entry into the EU, said Greece expects the EU to \"take decisions safeguarding a process of normalization of Turkey's relations with all 25 EU member states,\" noting that \"the major matter of Turkey's recognizing the Republic of Cyprus\" cannot be disregarded. Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Evripides Stylianides asserted that recognition of Cyprus by Turkey was \"an obvious legal and political requirement\" for starting accession talks. December 3, 2004 Turkish Sentiment Against U.S.-Led Offensive in Fallujah Grows Washington, D.C. - As Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul stated that the \"excessive use of force in Iraq\" was of concern to Turkey in response to the U.S.-led military offensive against insurgents in Fallujah, the chairman of the Turkish parliament's Human Rights Investigation Commission characterized the U.S. operation as \"genocide\" and the speaker of parliament said the offensive had violated the rules of international law. The chairman of the parliament's Commission, Mehmet Elkatmis, who is a prominent member of the ruling Justice and Development Party, asserted that \"the occupation has turned into barbarism\" and \"has entirely imperialist aims.\" He stated that \"such a genocide was never seen in the time of the pharaohs nor of [Adolf] Hitler nor of [Benito] Mussolini.\" Speaker Bulent Arinc said that \"ending these attacks, which involve violence against civilians in defiance of all human rights conventions, would be a big contribution to world peace.\" In addition, Turkey's Religious Affairs Directorate, attached to the prime minister's office, described the war in Iraq in a public statement as an \"unstoppable humanitarian tragedy,\" adding that it had \"turned into savageness.\" A statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Ankara said that the claim that the U.S. was committing genocide in Iraq was \"baseless, inflammatory, and offensive.\" A diplomat at the embassy also said, \"Such unfounded, inaccurate, exaggerated claims are not good for relations, especially at a time of strain when Turkish public opinion is so critical of what the United States is trying to do in Iraq.\" On November 30, officials from Turkey, the U.S., and Iraq met in Ankara to discuss security measures for Turkish truck drivers working in Iraq, who have been increasingly targeted in armed attacks. The death toll among these drivers has risen to at least 68, and 16 additional Turkish nationals are missing in Iraq. November 24, 2004 Escalating Concern over Safety of Turkish Workers in Iraq Washington, D.C. - With some 60 Turkish workers having been killed in Iraq, at least 10 of them in November alone, the Turkish Foreign Ministry expressed concern over what it described as a worsening security situation in the country and urged Turkish citizens not to travel there. Noting that ongoing clashes in Iraq have recently escalated, posing a threat to both Iraqi citizens and foreigners, the ministry's advisory said that, if Turks had to travel to the neighboring country, they should abide by security measures in place. The ministry released a similar warning in October. The ministry stated that the number of Turks killed in attacks, particularly against truck drivers transporting goods from Turkey to Iraq, was on the rise, despite attempts by the Iraqi interim government, local Iraqi authorities, the coalition forces in Iraq, and the U.S. and British governments and their representatives in Ankara and Baghdad to curtail them. It said even convoys with escorts were being attacked and that members of the Iraqi interim government and their families were being targeted by the attackers. On November 7, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan telephoned President Bush to express Turkey's worries over the situation. According to a report by the Anatolia News Agency, Erdogan, the same week, also conveyed Turkey's concern over the killings of Turkish truck drivers during a phone conversation with Vice President Richard Cheney, in which the prime minister also stated Turkey's unease over the U.S. military offensive on Fallujah, particularly its potential for causing civilian casualties. Turkey has established a coordination center near the Iraqi border to provide information for Turks working in Iraq concerning the safety level of various routes, along with suggestions to drivers to prevent ambushes along roadsides. Some Turkish companies have chartered planes to transport their workers to Iraq in order to avoid the dangers posed to buses on the roads. At a November 22-23 international conference on Iraq in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, which was attended by Turkey and all of Iraq's other neighbors, the question of border security emerged as a major issue. Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq's foreign minister, stated that Baghdad would ask Turkey and Iran to reinforce security along their common borders with Iraq in order to prevent foreign militants from entering the country. Syria has already agreed to take measures in this regard. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey welcomed Zebari's proposal. Gul reiterated Turkey's concern over Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants based in northern Iraq, as well as the intentions of Kurdish groups in the area, which Ankara fears could move the north in the direction of independence. He called on the United States to conduct an operation to rid the area of the PKK, stating, \"How much longer can [the U.S.] postpone the operation? They have lost the [support of the] Turkish people already.\" In a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on the sidelines of the conference, Gul conveyed Turkey's expectation that Washington take steps against the PKK in Iraq, emphasizing that their presence was a serious problem for Turkey. As apparent follow-up to an August accord signed by Erdogan and Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, in which Tehran agreed to outlaw the PKK, Iranian security forces began apprehending PKK militants operating within Iran in early November. The Iranian government disclosed that at least one security officer had been wounded in clashes between the security forces and the PKK near the Iranian-Turkish border. November 19, 2004 Ankara Continues European Tour as Countdown to EU Summit Begins Washington, D.C. - One month before the European Union is to make a decision at its mid-December summit on whether to grant Turkey a date for accession talks, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, which will hold the rotating EU presidency the first half of 2005, said his country wanted negotiations with Ankara to take place by the middle of the year. \"I exclude the concept of a privileged partnership [for Turkey]. That is not an option,\" Juncker said. \"That is the status quo, slightly improved. If partnership means just political [relations] and not in the institutions, that would be a lack of respect for Turkey,\" he noted. Juncker said that, during the 10 to 13 years of negotiations, prejudices against Turkey would be eliminated in Europe, adding that \"our final target is Turkey's full membership.\" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Luxembourg as part of his tour through European capitals to garner support for Turkey's bid to move forward with accession talks, appealed to the EU to treat Turkey \"just as the other candidate countries are treated\" and not give it \"special treatment.\" He said that, if the EU is to become a global force, it should promote compromise among civilizations, which could be facilitated with the accession of Turkey. Erdogan added that he hoped Turkey's situation would be evaluated without the matter being made \"a tool for internal politics.\" French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier said the French government expected accession negotiations with Turkey to begin at the end of 2005 or in early 2006 in order to give several countries, including France, time to hold referenda on the EU Constitution. In addition, Barnier said that \"a preparatory period will be needed\" before the opening of talks with Turkey, giving no further details. In the Czech Republic, whose parliament has voted to support the start of Turkey's talks at the EU summit, 3,400 people signed a petition against Turkey's membership in the bloc. David Gresak, the head of the citizens' committee that organized the signature drive, said, \"We want the Czech government to vote against the start of admission talks with Turkey at the EU summit,\" adding that the petition had been submitted to the government. He asserted that Turkey did not meet EU standards in many areas, such as human rights and the country's economic situation. When asked at a press conference in Luxembourg if Turkey would recognize the Republic of Cyprus before the summit, Erdogan said, \"At this moment, it is not a subject before the December 17 [summit] decision\" on whether to grant Ankara a date for accession talks. After he attends an international conference on Iraq in Egypt on November 22-23, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is scheduled to meet with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Foreign Minister Ben Bot of the Netherlands, which currently holds the EU presidency. November 12, 2004 European Leaders Weigh In on EU Bid as December Summit Approaches Washington, D.C. - Although the Dutch government, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, endorsed the opening of Turkey's accession talks with the bloc, it called on the EU to clearly state the consequences of Turkish non-adherence to its reform path in preparation for membership. Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot and European Affairs Minister Atzo Nicolai, in a letter to parliament, said, \"The government is, in principle, of the opinion that, in line with the recommendation of the Commission, the European Council can take a positive decision [to start talks with Turkey].\" The leaders of several large parties in the Dutch parliament that have expressed doubts over Turkey's entry into the EU also demanded a clearer statement of the government's policy on Ankara's accession. Maxime Verhagen, the parliamentary leader of Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende's Christian Democrats, said the EU should not promise a date to Turkey for starting accession talks since such a step would \"diminish the pressure\" on Ankara to continue its reform process. Verhagen emphasized that his party also wanted the Turkish parliament to adopt six additional human rights laws, including one concerning freedom of association, and said Ankara needed to put an adequate mechanism in position to stamp out torture. There are 350,000 Turks in the Netherlands, and the Dutch are becoming increasingly opposed to immigration. In addition, as the largest net contributor to EU finances, the Dutch government fears that the bloc's costs will rise significantly if Turkey joins. The president of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell Fontelles, reaffirmed the intention of the Parliament to hold a vote, probably on December 2, regarding Turkey's bid to become an EU member. Stating that it was appropriate for the EU's only directly elected body to express its opinion on Turkey's membership, he said he would travel to Ankara the day after the vote to deliver the result to the Turkish government. The Parliament's decision on the matter is not legally required and will not be binding. French President Jacques Chirac, while reiterating that he fully supported opening accession talks with Turkey, said \"one can't underestimate the possibility that, in a few years' time, we come to realize that . . . the road that Turkey has to travel doesn't permit it to adopt all the values of Europe.\" Chirac added, \"In that case, what has to be found is a means to create a sufficiently strong link so that there is no separation between Europe and Turkey, without there being integration.\" France's conservative Union for French Democracy (UDF) has insisted, through a letter to the French parliament's speaker, that parliament hold a second special session to debate Turkey's bid to join the European Union. In addition, the UDF has called on the legislative body to vote on a proposal offering Ankara a \"privileged partnership\" with the EU instead of full membership, despite a previous decision by the parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission rejecting the UDF's call for such a partnership. The UDF is a junior partner in the coalition behind French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, but it is not part of the cabinet. The French parliament held a special session in October to debate Turkey's membership, but the parliamentarians held no vote. In Germany, the leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Union, Angela Merkel, who advocates a privileged partnership for Turkey, reiterated that the country should not be admitted into the EU because its entry could overburden the current members and the differences between Turkey and the EU were too great for full membership. \"Ten to 15 years is not long enough to overcome numerous differences,\" Merkel stated. Claudia Roth, the chairperson of the German Green Party, which supports Turkey's EU membership, stated that Ankara's \"recognition of the Kurdish identity is a key on the path leading to European Union membership.\" A privileged partnership, she stated, would mean \"an open refusal\" to Turkey and would be \"worse than protecting the status quo.\" In addition, she asserted, \"Those who do not want Turkey's entry into the EU should know that the EU process is indispensable for Turkey's democratization.\" Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos said his government would work toward the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus before the December 17 EU summit \"as fervently as we can.\" He said he believed the withdrawal of the troops was \"Turkey's obligation toward the EU and Cyprus,\" adding that it was one of the issues Cyprus \"must evaluate, with due seriousness, when the time comes for us to make a decision\" at the summit on granting Turkey a date for accession talks. According to an opinion poll, 52 percent of Greek Cypriots want Cyprus to vote against the start of talks. Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou met with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in Brussels to explain the Cyprus government's positions on the necessity for Turkey to recognize the Republic of Cyprus, to sign its customs union with Cyprus, to open Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot ships and aircraft, to lift its vetoes on Cyprus's participation in various international organizations, and to remove all obstacles concerning the participation of Cyprus in the EU's Common Foreign and Defense Policy. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, on November 9, told Turkey's parliament that \"Turkey has no obligation to recognize\" Cyprus. The Czech Republic said it would support the start of Turkey's EU accession talks, noting that the talks would constitute an \"open process\" and not \"a promise of any timetable when the negotiations should be completed.\" In addition, the Czech government said, \"the result [of the negotiations] is not guaranteed.\" The Turkish parliament has passed a law that removes legal snags hampering the work of non-Muslim religious foundations, establishes a judicial police, and amends criminal procedures. The European Commission, in its October 6 report on Turkey's readiness for opening accession talks, demanded that the Turkish parliament pass the legislation before the summit. November 5, 2004 Ankara Continues Efforts to Gain Date for EU Accession Talks Washington, D.C. - Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in Ankara with Claudia Roth, the co-chairperson of the German Green Party, which supports Turkey's EU bid. Roth headed a delegation of the German Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that came to Turkey to discuss the human rights situation in the country with government officials and human rights organizations. Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul met in Lisbon with President Jorge Sampaio, Prime Minister Santana Lopes, Parliament Speaker Mota Amaral, and his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio Monterio, to gain their support for accession talks. In November and December, Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc will meet with delegations from the Belgian, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish parliaments, as well as one headed by European Parliament President Josep Borrell Fontelles. A group of Turkish parliamentarians, consisting of members of the EU Harmonization Commission, will travel to Finland, France, Portugal, and Spain, while also hosting representatives of their sister commissions in the Irish and German parliaments. Members of the Turkish parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission will meet with officials in Italy and Belgium, and will host their Estonian counterparts in Ankara. Erdogan, along with the leaders of EU candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania, went to Rome the last week of October to sign the new European Constitution. “The fact that our country is present alongside EU countries and candidates at this historic stage is of utmost importance because it shows Turkey is an inalienable part of Europe's future,” Erdogan said. The Turkish daily Milliyet noted that it was the first time Turkey had signed an EU document that referred to the Republic of Cyprus. Reflecting the implementation of one of Turkey's key reforms in preparation for EU membership, Turkey's top security body, the National Security Council, held its first meeting on October 27 under a civilian secretary general. The former Turkish ambassador to Greece, Yigit Alpogan, assumed the position, having been appointed in August to replace a senior military officer. In a move designed to curb the military's influence on the country's politics, the Council, which brings together civilian and military leaders, has been transformed from a committee that set many of the country's policies on leading issues to an advisory body. During its meeting, the Council called on the EU to handle Turkey's accession process in the same manner as it handled other candidate countries. Sharp divisions within the government-sponsored, 78-member Human Rights Advisory Board, an agency attached to Erdogan's office, became public during a press conference when a member of the board tore up a speech held by Ibrahim Kaboglu, the head of the board, as Kaboglu began presenting a report authored by the organization. The report criticized what it said was a lack of rights and freedoms in Turkey, and noted widespread opposition in the country to advancing cultural freedoms for ethnic Kurds and non-Muslim communities. It also said the declaration in the constitution that Turkish is the official language of Turkey was “impossible to understand,” given the country's international treaty commitments to minority rights. In addition, it said torture continued in the security services and the courts protected the accused rather than the victims of crime. The report maintained that Turkey's understanding of minority rights has fallen behind international norms, and it proposed far-reaching amendments to the constitution and the passage of related laws in addition to the reforms Ankara has already implemented. Turkey has not yet approved a Council of Europe Framework Convention on Protection of National Minorities. It adheres to the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which grants minority status only to non-Muslim communities in Turkey. In response to the EU's call for more cultural rights for Turkey's Kurdish community, Deputy Chief of the General Staff Gen. Ilker Basbug stated that Turkey's “unitary structure” was not open to debate. Turkey's leading human rights organization, the Human Rights Association (IHD), and representatives of the country's pro-Turkish Democratic People's Party (DEHAP) told a session of a European Parliament human rights sub-committee that systematic torture persisted in Turkey, despite the fact that the European Commission, in its October 6 report on Ankara's progress toward EU membership requirements, stated that it did not. IHD Chairman Husnu Ondul said the conclusion arrived at by his organization and DEHAP was based on the criteria put forward in the United Nations Convention Against Torture. November 5, 2004 European Hesitance Toward Ankara's EU Accession Continues Washington, D.C. - Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced proposals in certain European countries to hold referenda on Turkey's accession to the European Union as unprecedented in the bloc's history and characterized the proposals as \"clear discrimination.\" The leader of the France Democracy Union (UDF), Francois Bayrou, a leading opponent of Turkish membership, said his party was pushing to initiate a second parliamentary debate on Ankara's entry, follow-up to a debate on the issue by parliamentarians in early October. The UDF, like the Christian Democratic Union in Germany, advocates a \"privileged partnership\" between Ankara and the EU rather than full membership for Turkey. Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl, a Christian Democrat, asserted that Turkey should be brought as close as possible to the European Union but should not be given full membership. France's Armenian community said it would appeal to France's highest administrative tribunal, the Council of State, to request that French President Jacques Chirac oppose the start of EU accession talks with Turkey unless Ankara acknowledges that a genocide occurred in 1915-1917, when 1.5 million Armenians died during World War II. The French parliament passed legislation in 2001 stating that the deaths of the Armenians should be characterized as a genocide. Two far-right political parties in Germany, the National Democratic Party (NPD) and the German People's Union (DVU), have launched a signature campaign against Turkey's EU membership. Udo Voigt, the chairman of the NPD, known for its anti-minority views, stated that the party rejected a multi-cultural society. The DVU, led by Gerhard Frey, is seen as an anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant party. Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos, referring to recent activity in the Aegean by Turkish fighter jets and vessels that Athens has said constitutes a series of violations of Greek airspace and territorial waters, said, \"I believe that Turkey's orientation toward the EU is genuine, but various nationalist actions that are irreconcilable with European values continue to occur.\" Greece is a supporter of Turkey's EU membership bid. Former European Commission president and influential French socialist Jacques Delors asserted that a decision by the EU to deny Turkey the start of membership talks would \"mean the repudiation, the rejection, of another culture and would be a sin against freedom and good sense.\" November 5, 2004 Attacks Continue on Turkish Civilians in Iraq Washington, D.C. - In the latest in a string of attacks on Turkish drivers and workers in Iraq, insurgents killed the driver of a Turkish truck in the northern city of Mosul and set the truck on fire. Turks working in Iraq have increasingly become the targets of insurgents in the country, with several being killed in armed attacks and some being beheaded after being taken hostage. A number of Turkish companies have stopped operating in the country to save the lives of their kidnapped employees. At least seven Turks have been among some 32 foreign civilians killed in Iraq. Many others have been attacked or kidnapped along the highway from Turkey into the country. More than 150 foreigners have been kidnapped. Syria has lifted restrictions on Turkish shipments to Iraq via a railway linking the three neighboring countries. Ankara views the railway from Turkey to Iraq through Syria as a safe route for transporting goods to Iraq. October 29, 2004 Germany, France Reiterate Support for Turkey's EU Accession Washington, D.C. - German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac, during an October 26 meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Berlin, reaffirmed their backing for Turkey's EU membership, though Chirac said he would adhere to his plan to initiate a referendum in France to approve Ankara's entry. Schroeder said that he and Chirac \"are both of the opinion that, on December 17 [at the EU summit],\" a decision \"should give Turkey the opportunity to negotiate with the European Commission with the explicit aim of Turkey joining the European Union and with no other aim.\" Chirac, noting that negotiations with Turkey could last 15 years, if EU leaders grant Turkey a date for talks at the summit, said the French people \"would have the last word\" on Turkey's membership when the negotiations have neared their completion. \"My wish,\" he stated, \"is that Turkey join as soon as conditions allow.\" Chirac noted that the membership of Turkey \"would be in the interest of Turkey and in the interest of the stability and democracy of the world and our region.\" In response to the endorsement of Turkey's accession by the two leaders, Wolfgang Schauble, a prominent German conservative lawmaker, said, \"A full membership for Turkey will dramatically worsen or, basically, destroy a real political union developed by a collective political will.\" Michael Glos from Germany's Christian Social Union party said, \"It apparently does not matter to [Schroeder and Chirac] that in France and Germany clear majorities have spoken out against the entry\" of Turkey into the bloc. During his visit to Berlin, Erdogan attended the signing of an agreement for the $2.8 billion purchase of 36 planes from Airbus for Turkey's national carrier, Turkish Airlines. The airline said it would also be buying 15 Boeing aircraft for $982 million. Czech Foreign Minister Cyril Svoboda, during an October 26 meeting in Prague with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, stated that the Czech Republic supported the start of Turkey's accession negotiations, noting that it was \"clear that this process has no guaranteed outcome, just as it did not have in our case.\" Gul also met with French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier in Paris on the sidelines of an October 25 meeting of foreign ministers of Mediterranean countries. Gul has sent letters to European Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen and Ben Bot, the foreign minister of the Netherlands, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, requesting clarification of certain proposals in the October 6 European Commission report on Turkey's progress toward completing requirements for accession talks, including the suggestion that these talks be an \"open-ended\" process whose \"outcome cannot be guaranteed.\" In addition, Gul requested that the Commission explain the explicit conditions under which the EU would suspend negotiations with Ankara. The Turkish foreign minister met with Bot in The Hague as part of his tour of European capitals to gain support for Turkey's EU membership bid. Austrian President Heinz Fischer stated that negotiations with Turkey should start, \"but under the condition that a date for its possible full-fledged membership in the bloc be clearly indicated.\" Greek Defense Minister Spilios Spiliotopoulos, referring to a series of actions by Turkish warplanes and vessels that Athens said constituted violations of Greek airspace and territorial waters, stated that Turkey's \"attitude, in an environment of cooperation and the promotion of very good relations, is not a step in the right direction and is also unacceptable in view of the efforts being made for Turkish membership in the European Union.\" Acting Greek government spokesman Evangelos Antonaros said Greece still backed Turkey's bid for EU membership, adding that he could \"see no change in this reality.\" The Turkish government said that, prior to December 17, it would \"urgently\" push several more reforms through parliament, which had been mentioned in the October 6 European Commission report as legislation that still needed to be passed. These reforms consist of removing legal obstacles that hinder the functioning of associations and non-Muslim religious foundations, establishing a judicial police, and amending criminal procedures and rules related to the execution of punishments. October 22, 2004 Ankara on Campaign in Europe for Accession Talks Date Washington, D.C. - As part of Turkey's Europe-wide campaign to urge EU leaders to grant a date at their December summit for unconditional accession talks with Ankara, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul held talks on October 18 in Berlin with his German counterpart, Joschka Fischer, who said Germany would do \"everything in its power\" at the summit to persuade other EU leaders to vote in favor of a date for Turkey's negotiations. Referring to Turkey's potential EU membership, Fischer said, \"To modernize an Islamic country based on the shared values of Europe would be almost a D-Day for Europe in the war against terror.\" It would be \"the greatest positive challenge for these totalitarian and terrorist ideas,\" he stated. Fischer noted that, before the September 11 attacks, he had been skeptical about the EU having borders with Syria, Iraq, and Iran, \"but [the EU's] security will be defined for at least five decades in this region.\" In a meeting with Angela Merkel, the leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which leads in public opinion polls, Gul failed to change her view that a \"privileged partnership\" with the EU for Turkey instead of full membership in the bloc should be pursued. Gul said he opposed this option, maintaining that Turkey already has such a partnership through its customs union with the EU, established in 1995. \"What other privileges one can think of, I don't know,\" he stated. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Santana Lopes, in talks in Lisbon, said they would both vote at the summit for a date for Turkey's talks. An opinion poll released in Germany on October 17 indicated that 45 percent of Germans backed eventual EU entry for Turkey, while 48 percent were opposed. On October 26, the same day he is scheduled to meet with Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac in Berlin, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit France to address the French public on state television concerning the steps Turkey has taken to prepare for EU membership. An opinion poll released on October 10 indicated that 75 percent of the French people would vote against Turkey's accession in a referendum. Erdogan met with the secretary general of the Organization for Cooperation and Development (OECD), Donald Johnston, in Paris on October 21, the day the OECD released a 180-page survey on Turkey's economy that praised the country's economic performance over the last three years and noted that it now had one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD. The survey's recommendations included calling on the Turkish government to improve public services and spending controls, boost privatization, and revamp the tax system to rein in the country's massive black market, which currently accounts for more than half of all jobs in Turkey. Johnston stated that Turkey's economic performance \"can only be described as stunning in terms of the turnaround from 2001 to the present,\" adding that \"it is in the interests of Turkey and the European Union that Turkey should become a member of the EU.\" October 22, 2004 Debate on Turkey's EU Accession Expands Across Europe Washington, D.C. - A debate is underway in Italy over the desirability of holding a referendum on Turkey's bid to join the European Union. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has asserted that he would like to see the EU start accession talks with Ankara in 2005. Justice Minister Roberto Castelli, a member of Italy's Northern League, one of the four parties of the right-wing coalition government, has spoken out in favor of a referendum on Turkey's entry. Determining whether or not Turkey should join the EU, he stated, \"cannot depend solely on a decision by the [Italian] government\" and should be decided by the Italian people. The other parties of the coalition have said that bringing predominantly Muslim Turkey into the EU would be the best defense against Islamic extremism. Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Adolfo Urso said a referendum would be \"useless and harmful.\" In Austria, a country where public opinion against Turkey's accession is high, a far-right coalition partner recently threatened to leave the coalition if the country votes \"yes\" at the December summit to entry talks for Ankara. European Parliament President Josep Borrell said he favored an EU-wide referendum on Turkey's entry into the bloc, asserting that he was skeptical about proposals to hold separate national referenda on the matter. Borrell said the Parliament would have its own debate on Turkey's accession on December 2. The Greens Group of the European Parliament, staunch supporters of Turkey's entry into the EU, held its general assembly meeting in Istanbul, voicing strong criticism of stated plans by countries, such as France, to hold national referenda on whether Ankara should join the bloc. The president of the Greens Group, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, said the Greens had arrived in Turkey as \"critical friends,\" so that issues in the country that remained to be resolved, such as the situation regarding the ethnic Kurds and other minorities, or women's rights, could be \"openly discussed among friends.\" He said, \"We must have uncomfortable discussions on, for example, Cyprus and the role of the army\" in Turkey. Joschka Fischer, a Green Party member, took part in the meeting. European Union High Commissioner for Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana said Turkey's entry into the EU was needed for Europe's security, noting that the country had a \"geographically strategic position in a world shaken by crises in the Middle East and the threat of global terrorism.\" Assessing Turkey's commitment to full press freedom, Reporters Without Borders stated that, although legislative reforms undertaken by the Turkish government in preparation for EU membership have been \"positive\" for journalists, \"Turkey still does not fulfill all the necessary conditions for real press freedom\" and \"it is still very difficult for the most critical journalists to function.\" The Turkish courts, it stated, \"continue to impose prison sentences and exorbitant fines that push journalists to censor themselves extensively on the most sensitive subjects such as the army and the Kurdish question.\" Television and radio stations are still subject to \"brazen censorship\" by the High Council for Broadcasting (RTUK), the organization said. The country's new penal code, it asserted, stipulated that \"insult\" is punishable by three months to three years in prison, with the sentence increasing if the crime is committed by means of the press. The improvements in press freedom, it stated, included the elimination of the closure of news organizations or bans on the printing and distribution of reports when the government deemed certain reporting to be a violation of the penal code. The Conference of European Churches, which represents Protestant, Anglican, and Orthodox churches across Europe, issued a statement concerning Ankara's EU membership bid that said European churches had \"deep concern about the situation of Christian minorities\" in predominantly Muslim Turkey. Although Turkey's secular laws guarantee religious freedom, non-Muslim communities lack legal status and the training of their clergy in the country is banned. In addition, these communities operate under restrictions on property ownership and on receiving help from foreign churches. Hans Joachim Meyer, the head of the Central Committee of German Catholics, said, \"It is a scandal that the situation of the Christian minority in Turkey plays no role for the supporters or the opponents of the country's membership in the EU.\" U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's special representative on human rights defenders, Hina Jilani, stated that security forces in Turkey are still resisting full implementation of democratic reforms and continue to treat human rights campaigners with suspicion. Although Jilani also praised Ankara's democratization efforts as \"genuine steps toward change\" at the end of a ten-day investigation into the working conditions of Turkish rights activists, she said torture persisted in the country despite serious efforts by the government to stamp out the practice. In addition, she called for easing restrictions on the peaceful assembly of civic groups. A leading human rights group in Turkey, the Human Rights Association (IHD), stated that a sharp rise in human rights abuses occurred in the country's southeast in September, with more than one-third of detainees complaining they had been tortured by police. October 22, 2004 U.S. Proposes Sidewinder Missile Sale to Turkey Washington, D.C. - The Bush administration has proposed that it sell 225 AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles to Turkey in conjunction with a planned modernization of the country’s fleet of F-16 fighter aircraft. Acquisition of the missiles by Turkey would boost Ankara’s ability to contribute to NATO operations and the war on terror, while furthering the interoperability of Turkey’s weapons systems with those of U.S. forces, according to the administration. A mandatory notice to the U.S. Congress released by the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the $96 million sale would not affect “the basic regional military balance or U.S. efforts to encourage a negotiated settlement on the divided island of Cyprus.” The primary contractor for the heat-seeking, short-range, air-to-air missiles would be Raytheon Systems Corporation of Tucson, Arizona. October 15, 2004 Ankara Seeks Changes in European Commission Report on Turkey Washington, D.C. - The Turkish government, assessing the October 6 European Commission report recommending the start of Turkey's EU accession talks, cited references in the report to possible restrictions on the free movement of Turkish labor throughout the EU and the \"open-ended\" nature of the entry negotiations \"whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand\" as elements that, in Ankara's view, contravene the principle of \"fair treatment of all candidate countries\" and \"suggest a kind of discrimination.\" Turkish government spokesman Cemil Cicek said Turkey would seek clarification from the European Commission concerning these references and would ask that the wording of the report, with regard to these points, be changed prior to December 17, when EU leaders will decide at their summit whether to grant Ankara a date for negotiations on the basis of the report. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey hoped that EU member nations would reach a decision on Turkey's accession talks \"with no conditions attached\" and would \"allow no discrimination\" regarding the outcome of the negotiating process. Erdogan said Turkey would insist on receiving the same treatment from the EU during this process that the 10 nations that joined the bloc in May received. In Germany, Angela Merkel, the leader of the conservative main opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), abandoned plans for a signature drive in favor of a \"privileged partnership\" between Turkey and the EU, rather than full EU membership for Ankara, because she feared the move might be \"misinterpreted.\" The idea of holding a signature drive was originally proposed by a member of the ultra-conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) and was backed by its leader, Edmund Stoiber. Several conservatives stated that the collection of signatures would have been interpreted as hostility toward the 2.5 million Turks living in Germany and could have hurt the CDU at the ballot box. According to opinion polls, the CDU is well placed to win the next parliamentary elections in 2006. The president of Germany's Turkish community, Hakki Keskin, had warned that such a signature drive \"would be taken as a declaration of war against Turkey and Turks living in Germany.\" German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who supports Turkey's entry into the EU, had sharply criticized Merkel's call for the gathering of signatures. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a member of the Green Party, the junior partner of Schroeder's Social Democrats in the ruling coalition, had said that such a move would damage relations with Turkey and offend \"a very important partner,\" though it would not have led to a referendum under German law. Claudia Roth, a Green Party parliamentarian, stated that she favored a referendum on Turkey's accession and that her party would submit a draft bill to the German parliament calling for the referendum. Schroeder stated that Turkey's membership in the European Union would be \"more of a security gain than a risk for the EU\" and would \"create a link between European enlightenment and non-fundamentalist Islam.\" German President Horst Koehler defended the concept of open-ended accession talks between the European Union and Turkey, asserting that the EU should \"make sure that what has been achieved will not be put in danger by steps to be taken in the future.\" French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin asked that the French parliament's agenda be amended to allow a debate on Turkey's EU bid on October 14, which was not followed by a vote on the issue. During the debate, Raffarin stated that \"neither Europe nor Turkey\" is currently \"ready for Turkey joining\" the bloc. Raffarin favors a referendum in France on the accession of Turkey, when it is ready for membership in more than a decade, as does French President Jacques Chirac, who supports Ankara's eventual entry into the bloc. Chirac stated that, \"at any moment, France can withdraw, or use its veto . . . and at that moment negotiation [with Turkey] stops.\" An opinion poll released on October 10 in France indicated that 75 percent of the French people would vote against Turkey's accession in a referendum. France fears that a start date for accession talks during the first half of 2005 could adversely influence the result of a planned referendum on the EU's first constitution and is reportedly pushing for a date during the second half of the year. Erdogan and Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul have launched a tour of European capitals to push for the granting of a date for accession talks early in 2005 at the December EU summit. Erdogan will hold talks in Berlin on October 26 with Schroeder and Chirac. Gul will meet with Fischer in Berlin on October 18-19 and will hold talks with his French counterpart Michel Barnier on the sidelines of a gathering of representatives of Mediterranean countries in Paris on October 24-25. Gul will also talk to leaders in the Czech Republic on October 26 and those in Slovakia and Portugal in November. He has already met with his British and Swedish counterparts in Ankara. On October 11, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer signed into law the country's new penal code, widely seen as the last legislative reform required to align Turkey's laws with EU norms. Most of the changes in the code will go into effect in one year, and some will take effect in two years. In a separate development, a Turkish court sentenced Young Party leader Cem Uzan to eight months in prison for calling Erdogan \"treacherous\" and \"godless\" at a rally in Bursa. October 15, 2004 Germany May Lift Its Suspension of Arms Sales to Turkey Washington, D.C. - The European Commission's October 6 report citing improvements in Turkey's human rights record and recommending that it be given a date to open EU accession talks is expected to open the way for Germany to resume arms sales to Ankara, according to German Defense Minister Peter Struck. \"I do think that the fact the EU is now heading toward membership talks [with Turkey] will and should lead to a change in opinion among those who have up to now opposed the sale of Leopard II [main battle] tanks to Turkey,\" Struck stated. The German government was prepared to sell 1,000 surplus Leopard II tanks to Turkey in 1999, but Germany's Green Party, the junior partner of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats in the ruling coalition, opposed the $8.6 billion sale, citing Ankara's human rights record and treatment of minorities, such as the ethnic Kurds. One of the joint presidents of the Green Party, Reinhard Buetikofer, suggested that the party would now drop its opposition to the sale. In 1999, \"there was a civil war [and] at that time you had to be concerned that these weapons would be used in that civil war,\" Buetikofer stated, referring to the conflict between separatists of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and Turkish government forces. The conflict largely subsided during the second half of 1999, after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was apprehended and sentenced to death for treason, a sentence that was commuted to life imprisonment in 2002, when Turkey abolished the death penalty. Germany's arms export laws prevent sales to countries in which the weapons might be used for internal repression or the abuse of human rights. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, a member of the Green Party, stated that the government would decide on the basis of \"changed realities\" whether to consider selling Leopard II tanks to Turkey. A Defense Ministry spokesman said no formal request for the tanks had been submitted by Turkey, which is now reportedly interested in acquiring 250 main battle tanks. The spokesman said Struck would visit Turkey in November to discuss the country's military needs with Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul. The Leopard II, manufactured by the Munich-based firm Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, was designed for combat in central Europe's open and flat regions, and it no longer suits the German military's new concept of being able to respond quickly to situations outside of the traditional NATO boundaries. October 15, 2004 Germany Extradites Turkish Militant to Istanbul Washington, D.C. - German police have extradited Metin Kaplan, an Islamic militant charged with masterminding a failed 1998 plot to fly an explosives-laden airplane into the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish state, in Ankara during a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the republic. Turkish authorities said the attack was prevented when police arrested 23 suspected members of Kaplan's group, the Caliphate State, the day before the ceremony. Kaplan, a long-time resident of Cologne, was returned to Turkey on October 12 shortly after his arrest by German authorities and a German court's approval of his deportation. The court ruled that he was seen as an \"identity figure for Islamic extremism\" and could no longer be allowed to reside in Germany. Kaplan's group, which is banned in Germany, calls for the overthrow of Turkey's secular government in order to replace it with an Islamic state. Kaplan served a four-year prison sentence in Germany for inciting his followers to murder a rival Islamic leader in Berlin in 1997 and had been free since May 2003. He evaded arrest earlier this year when an extradition warrant was issued for him. Prior to Ankara's abolition of the death penalty in June 2002, Germany had refused to extradite Kaplan to Turkey, stating also that his followers had been subjected to torture by Turkish authorities. Turkey, which has introduced measures to prevent torture, assured the German government that Kaplan would not be ill treated and would get a fair trial. October 8, 2004 European Commission Recommends Opening Accession Talks Washington, D.C. - The European Commission, in its October 6 report, recommended that the European Union open accession talks with Turkey, since Ankara had fulfilled the required political criteria. The decision on whether talks will begin will be made by EU leaders at their December summit in Brussels. The Commission noted that its recommendation, which did not include a suggested start date for the negotiations, was contingent on Turkey's implementation of the new penal code, the law on associations, and legislation concerning intermediate courts of appeal, as well as adoption of the code on criminal procedure, legislation establishing the judicial police, and the law on execution of punishments and measures. The criteria that had been met, according to the Commission, included substantial legislative and institutional convergence toward European standards, particularly after the 2002 parliamentary elections; the adaption of civil-military relations to European norms, with the government increasingly asserting its control over the military; the strengthening of the independence and efficiency of the judiciary, while implementing important changes such as the abolition of State Security Courts; the launching of public administration reform; recognition of the primacy of international and European law with regard to human rights; and the alignment of laws with international conventions and rulings, resulting in decisions such as the abolition of the death penalty. In addition, the Commission stated, the scope of fundamental freedoms enjoyed by Turkish citizens, such as freedom of expression and assembly, had been substantially extended. Civil society had grown stronger; cultural rights for ethnic Kurds had begun to be recognized; the state of emergency had been lifted throughout the country; the process of normalization had begun in the southeast; and Turkish foreign policy was contributing positively to regional stability. The report said Turkey \"has and continues actively to support efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem,\" noting that Ankara had agreed to the solution to the problem put forward in the Annan reunification plan. It said relations with Greece had \"developed positively,\" through the signing of bilateral agreements and the adoption of confidence-building measures, while a process of exploratory talks between Turkey and Greece had continued. The report also noted that Turkey remained on the black list of the secretariat of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State controls, as Cypriot vessels or vessels that have docked in Cyprus remain unable to enter Turkish ports. Presenting the report to the European Parliament, European Commission President Romano Prodi said the Commission's green light for Turkey's negotiations was \"a qualified yes,\" accompanied by a large number of recommendations for follow up and monitoring during the talks. He stated that \"the outcome [of the talks] is not a foregone conclusion.\" Prodi asserted that the EU had to ensure that developments concerning Turkey's rapid progress in the direction of democratic values and standards \"really are irreversible and that they will be pursued to completion.\" He added, \"We must tell our Turkish partners . . . that any breakdown in this process towards democracy, human rights, fundamental rights, and the rule of law . . . will automatically bring negotiations to a halt.\" In the report, the Commission stated that it would recommend \"the suspension of negotiations in the case of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which the Union is founded,\" to be decided through a qualified majority of the European Council. Prodi noted that a number of factors such as Turkey's size, geographical position, traditions as a regional power, population and demographic growth, infrastructure, and large rural and farming population \"call for profound reflection and clear precautions in conducting accession negotiations, so as to prevent Turkey's integration from weakening the structure we have been building for over 50 years.\" However, he said, \"we cannot imagine a future for Europe in which Turkey is not firmly anchored,\" noting that \"we must consider the opportunities that Turkey's integration will bring us in terms of growth and prosperity.\" The EU, he said, \"has nothing to fear from Turkey's accession.\" Citing areas where further efforts are required by Turkey, the Commission noted that the implementation of reforms remained uneven; the armed forces continued to exercise influence through a series of informal mechanisms; corruption remained a serious problem in almost all areas of the economy and public affairs, despite the adoption of a number of anti-corruption measures; numerous cases of ill-treatment, including torture, continued to occur, despite an official zero tolerance policy toward such actions; and journalists and other citizens expressing non-violent opinions continued to be prosecuted, while the new penal code provided \"only limited progress as regards freedom of expression.\" In addition, the Commission said, there were reports of the continued use of disproportionate force against demonstrators; non-Muslim religious communities continued to experience difficulties connected with legal personality, property rights, the training of clergy, schools, and internal management; discrimination and violence against women remained a major problem; child labor was still an issue of serious concern, with trade union rights falling short of International Labor Organization (ILO) standards; considerable restrictions remained in the area of broadcasting and education in minority languages; and no integrated strategy to reduce regional disparities and address the economic, social, and cultural needs of the population of the southeast had been adopted. Concerning the economic sector, the Commission said Turkey had made considerable progress toward achieving a functioning market economy, while economic stability and predictability had been substantially improved since the 2001 economic crisis. High inflation had come down to historic lows, political interference in economic matters had been reduced, and the institutional and regulatory framework had been brought closer to international standards. Noting that preparations for Turkey's accession would \"last well into the next decade,\" the Commission identified a number of issues to consider when accession talks proceed. The combined impact of the country's population, size, geographical location, and economic, security, and military potential \"give Turkey the capacity to contribute to regional and international stability,\" leading to improving bilateral relations with its neighbors, the Commission said. In addition, Turkey would be an important \"model\" of a country with a majority Muslim population adhering to the principles of liberty, democracy, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. The economic impact of Turkey's accession on the EU \"would be positive but relatively small,\" due to the modest size of the Turkish economy and the degree of economic integration existing before accession, the Commission stated. Although the integration of Turkey into the EU's internal market would be beneficial, the accession of the country, as a lower middle-income nation, would increase regional economic disparities and \"would represent a major challenge for cohesion policy,\" it said. The migration of additional Turks to other EU countries \"could make a contribution to offsetting the aging of EU societies,\" it said, adding that long transition periods and a permanent safeguard clause could be considered to avoid serious disturbances on the EU labor market. Turkey would need considerable time to make a number of its agricultural sectors more competitive in order to avoid substantial income losses for Turkish farmers. Turkey's accession would help to secure better energy supply routes for the EU, while the management of the EU's long new external borders would constitute an important policy challenge and require significant investment, the Commission noted. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara hoped to start negotiations during the first half of 2005. Erdogan referred to the Commission's report as \"positive,\" stating that the Turkey did not want \"different treatment\" and would continue to work on its reforms in order to meet EU requirements, particularly concerning the implementation of new legislation. Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said the Commission's recommendation to begin talks was \"a historic step for both the EU and Turkey.\" Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said Greece, one of the staunchest advocates of EU accession for Turkey, believed \"that a European Turkey is not only in the interests of the Turkish people, but will also contribute to the stability, security, and prosperity of our region as well as to progress in Greek-Turkish relations and the effort to find a fair, viable, and practicable solution in Cyprus.\" \"Among the issues on which there needs to be quicker and more productive progress are matters of particular concern to Greece,\" Roussopoulos said, an apparent veiled reference to the Cyprus problem and Greek-Turkish disputes in the Aegean Sea. Cyprus government spokesman Kypros Chrysostomides stated that the recommendations in the Commission's report \"contain a good base on which to build.\" He added, \"There is now a framework and a procedure in which our side can act so as to make use of the possibilities toward realizing our targets on the Cyprus issue.\" With respect to the vote of EU leaders in December on whether a date will be set for Turkey's accession talks, Chrysostomides said, \"We do not wish to exercise the right to veto, [and] we do not wish to hamper the start of accession talks with Turkey, but basic concerns should be taken into consideration.\" Read Commission report. October 8, 2004 Cyprus Included in Turkey-EU Customs Union, No Recognition Washington, D.C. - Turkey, on October 2, announced that it had decided to include Cyprus, along with the nine other European Union members that joined the bloc on May 1, in its customs union agreement with the EU, but it said the decision \"does not imply in any way the recognition of the Greek Cypriot administration by Turkey.\" Turkey, which entered a customs union with the EU in 1995, has no diplomatic ties with Cyprus. Ankara's statement said that \"the Greek Cypriot administration is equally obliged, according to its Treaty of Accession with the EU to provide customs union treatment to goods coming from Turkey.\" The European Commission \"has given written confirmation that the Greek Cypriot administration is accepting the free circulation under the customs union of goods from Turkey\" as of May 1, 2004, it added. The Turkish government also stated that Turkey remained \"committed to its special relationship with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and its obligations emanating from this special relationship,\" noting that the EU had yet to fulfill its commitments concerning an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. The secretary general of the Cyprus Foreign Ministry, Sotos Zaheos, stated that, although he believed Turkey \"would not be given an open check\" for EU membership unless it recognized Cyprus, he said the lack of recognition would not mean that the Cyprus government would veto the start of Turkey's accession talks at the December EU summit. The Turkish Cypriot prime minister, Mehmet Ali Talat, said the inclusion of Cyprus in Turkey's customs union agreement with the EU would \"have serious effects on the Turkish Cypriot people because the Cyprus dispute remains unresolved.\" In addition, he said, if Turkey recognized the Republic of Cyprus before the Cyprus problem was resolved, \"this would cause chaos for the Turkish Cypriots.\" Talat noted that the European Council needed to enact the measures proposed by the European Commission, which included $321 million in economic aid to the Turkish Cypriots and provisions for allowing direct trade between the EU and northern Cyprus. He also said certain measures would be taken to protect entrepreneurs in northern Cyprus, adding that the Turkish Cypriots have already begun holding talks with officials in Turkey and Brussels concerning the matter. On October 1, Turkey cancelled a conference providing a second dialogue between EU countries and the Muslim nations of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), scheduled for October 4-5 in Istanbul. The cancellation occurred after the current Dutch presidency of the EU said it would not attend the meeting because of Ankara's insistence that the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus should be represented, as an observer at the forum, as the \"Turkish Cypriot State.\" The Dutch presidency had called on other EU members not to attend the meeting as well. Turkish Cypriots were represented at the first EU-OIC conference in 2002 as the \"Turkish Muslim Community of Cyprus.\" Turkey maintained that the term \"Turkish Cypriot State\" should be used at the October conference, since it was the designation for northern Cyprus decided upon by the OIC at its annual meeting in June 2004. On October 4, Peter Scheider, the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, announced that two Turkish Cypriot representatives would be permitted, for the first time, to participate in all of the assembly's sessions, including those of the General Assembly and the commissions, both of which they would be allowed to address. Scheider said the decision did not indicate recognition of the Turkish Cypriot administration, and the two Turkish Cypriots had not been granted voting rights. Cyprus Foreign Minister George Iacovou said the two would be appointed by the Turkish Cypriot political parties and would be on the list of representatives of the Cyprus House of Representatives. Previously, the Turkish Cypriot representatives were only allowed to attend commission meetings where Cyprus was discussed and could only watch the General Assembly sessions from the audience gallery. In addition, they had to be included in the Greek Cypriot delegation. October 1, 2004 Passage of New Penal Code Welcomed by European Commission Washington, D.C. - After the European Commission made it clear that the passage of Turkey's new penal code would be a condition for opening accession talks with the EU, the Turkish parliament debated and passed the remaining articles of the code during an emergency session on September 26, just 10 days before the Commission was to issue its recommendation on Ankara's readiness for talks to the EU Council of Ministers. The proposal to include a ban on adultery in the code was dropped by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), following sharp criticism of the provision by EU officials and a warning that its inclusion could have a negative effect on the Commission's recommendation. In its October 6 report, the Commission, which had characterized the penal code as the \"centerpiece\" of reforms Ankara must legislate in order to meet EU requirements, is now widely expected to recommend to EU leaders that they decide at their December summit to set a date for Turkey's accession talks. The new penal code is viewed as a major contribution to Turkey's human rights record, although critics said it failed to totally ban virginity tests, preserved an article that could be used to reduce the sentences of those who carry out honor killings, and punished consensual sex between minors. The code will go into effect on April 1, 2005. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the government would continue to work on remaining deficiencies regarding required reforms, which concerned primarily the implementation of those that had already been passed. The debate within Europe on Turkey's accession prospects has intensified. French President Jacques Chirac backed earlier calls for a referendum in France on whether Turkey should enter the European Union by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Foreign Minister Michel Barnier, and Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, widely viewed as a challenger to Chirac in the 2007 presidential elections. Chirac made it clear that it would be unlikely for such a referendum to take place until more than a decade has passed, the time period estimated for Turkey to implement the changes required for EU membership. He said he had asked the government to look at ways to amend the French constitution so that the accession of all new EU members would be submitted to a vote in France, rather than be decided by parliament. Chirac, who supports Turkey's entry into the bloc, said, \"We share an interest in having Turkey with us. It creates the perspective of democracy and peace taking root on the entire European continent.\" His conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) opposes Turkey's entry. Josselin de Rohan, the leader of the UMP in the Senate, said there was \"a very broad agreement in the UMP\" on the idea of holding a referendum on Turkey's accession. Sarkozy said he advocated an alternative status for Turkey within the EU instead of full membership. He said his reservations over Turkey's accession stemmed from the fact that the size of its population was as large as that of the 10 new EU members that joined the bloc in May and not from the fact that it was a predominantly Muslim nation. Turkey has 70 million inhabitants now and will have 100 million by 2050, he stated. An opinion poll released on September 28 indicated that 56 percent of the French people would oppose Turkey's entry into the EU if a referendum were held now. Sarkozy's view echoed the opinion of Angela Merkel, the leader of Germany's center-right opposition Christian Democratic Union, who wrote to other center-right leaders in the EU calling on them to block Turkey's full membership in the bloc and offer, instead, a \"privileged partnership.\" She criticized German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who supports Turkey's EU membership, for what she said was his failure to adequately inform the German people about the consequences of its potential entry into the bloc. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said it was clear, following the September 11 terrorist attacks, \"how much a European Turkey is important for our security.\" A poll carried out on September 28 and 29 showed that 55 percent of Germans were in f"
