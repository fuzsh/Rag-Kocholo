Climate change, in combination with other factors, is driving disaster risk in multiple and complex ways. This includes its effects as a \"risk multiplier\" through increasing the frequency, intensity and predictability of weather-related hazards, such as floods following heavy rainfall, agricultural drought, extreme tropical storms and heat waves; through impacts on gradual environmental processes including sea level rise, desertification and salinization; and on a wide range of ecosystem services on which people depend for survival, including food, water, and productive and habitable land; and, in some situations, by exacerbating social tensions and existing conflict.

It includes acts that inflict physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other deprivations of liberty. These acts can occur in public or in private.’\n\nUNHCR’s GBV Policy further outlines that ‘GBV is based on patriarchal power relations and gender discrimination. The term ‘Gender-Based Violence’ ‘is most commonly used to underscore how systemic inequality between males and females, which exists in every society in the world, acts as a unifying and foundational characteristic of most forms of violence perpetrated against women and girls.’ GBV also describes ‘the violence perpetrated against women, girls, men and boys with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities as well as non-binary individuals because it is driven by a desire to punish those seen as defying gender norms.’\n\nUNHCR has historically used the term sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), often used interchangeably with gender-based violence, but with the issuance of the 2020 Policy, it consciously decided to use the term gender-based violence (GBV).\n\nReference: IASC GBV Guidelines for Integrating GBV Interventions in Humanitarian Action, 2015, Part 1\n\nSee UNHCR Policy on the Prevention of, Risk Mitigation and Response to GBV.\n\nSee also: sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).\n\ngender-mainstreaming\n\nA comprehensive strategy that aims to achieve greater gender equality by integrating a gender perspective into existing programme areas and policies.
