The General Quotations are incorporated in this number for the first time since the closing of the stock exchanges in July last. THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. numerous speeches and addresses which the the In President has recently been delivering, he has been making some frank admissions. These furnish a valuable insight into the character and calibre of the man and also afford illuminating evidence as to the impulses that govern him in dealing with grave public questions and in carrying out the policies of his Administration. In speaking on Wednesday before the convention of the United States Chamber of Commerce, he said in a guileless sort of way that he \"agreed with a colleague of his in the Cabinet the other day that they had never attended in their lives before a school to compare with what they were now attending for the purpose of gaining a liberal education.\" That has been the trouble with Mr. Wilson's entire Administration thus far. He and his colleagues in the Cabinet (and these Cabinet ministers are all the same type of men as the President himself) have acted with insufficient knowledge in an amateurish, bungling, blundering fashion, and yet have had the utmost confidence in their ability to solve problems some of which have been taxing the wit and ingenuity of man since the dawn of civilization. It is literally true that Mr. Wilson and his immediate advisers have during the last two years been attending \"a school\"—the school of experience—and have been \"gaining a liberal education,\" but, unfortunately, at the expense of their suffering fellowcitizens, the entire community. Our industries have been doctored and doctored with patent medicines well-nigh unto death. Yet the President and his Cabinet associates look on and have the utmost faith that their treatment in the end will prove successful. If the patient shall finally succumb they will not be prepared to admit that their quack remedies were at fault, but at least they will know that it was possible for him to die—a fact never contemplated by them as among the possibilities. They will have gained knowledge and experience, but after the fashion of t he youthful medical practitioner, whose experimentations lead the unfortunates who are the subject of them to the grave, leaving the practitioner that much the wiser but the victims beyond the hope of resurrection. In his speech before the United States Chamber of Commerce the President indulged quite freely in anecdote to illustrate his remarks. Here is an instance of the kind: \"I remember once a good many years ago, I was attending one of the local chambers of commerce of the United States at a time when everybody was complaining that Congress was interfering with business. If you have heard that complaint recently and supposed that it was original with the men who made it, you have not lived as long as I have. It has been going on ever since I can remember. And the complaint came most vigorously, of course,from men who were interested in large corporate developments. It will be observed that the President makes a point of the fact that business complained of interference from legislation away back and he asserts that the loudest complaints came \"from men who flroL. 100. were interested in large corporate developments.\" It is undoubtedly true that business has had to defend itself from adverse legislation for many a year and that corporations have been the particular object of assault. But that does not make such legislation any the less indefensible or any the less harmful and does not absolve those threatened by it from making vigorous efforts to protect themselves and from seeking to ward off the danger. In the State legislatures corporations have been obliged for thirty or forty years to fight hostile legislation. Out of the fear thus engendered grafting politicians have reaped rich harvests at times. So systematic were the efforts to bleed corporations that it grew to be a quite familiar practice to purchase sexemption with large campaign contributions, frequently to both the leading political parties. But all this can hardly be urged as justifying pernicious schemes of legislation or of rendering earnest, sincere protests against the same occasion for criticism or condemnation. The President went on to tell what reply he made to the complaints of legislative interference with business, as follows: I took the liberty to say to that body of men. whom I did not know that I took it for granted that there were a great many lawyers among them and that it was likely that the more prominent of those lawyers were intimate advisers of the corporations of that region, and I said that I had met a great many lawyers from whom the complaint had coma most vigorously not only that there was too much legislation with regard to corporations, but that it was ignorant legislation. I said: \"Now, the responsibility is with you. If the legislation is mistaken, you are on the inside and know where the mistakes are being made. You know not only the innocent and right things that your corporations are doing, but you know the other things, too. Knowing how they are done, you can be expert advisers as to how the wrong things can be prevented. If, therefore, this thing is handled ignorantly there is nobody to blame but yourselves. If we on the outside cannot understand the thing and cannot get advice from the inside, then we will have to do it with the flat hand and not with the touch of skill and discrimination.\" Is not that true? Men on the inside of business know how business is conducted, and they cannot complain if men on the outside make mistakes about business if they do not come from the inside and give the kind of advice which is necessary. The trouble in the past—for I think the thing is changing very rapidly—has generally been that they came with all their bristles out. They came on the defensive. They came to see, not what they could accomplish, but what they could prevent. They did not come to guide, but they came to block, and that is of no use whatever to the general body politic. In the foregoing we see illustrated some of the tactics with which the country has become familiar during the last two years. It will be noticed that the President's first step was to question the motives of those opposing legislative interference with business. Were those protesting engaged in wrongful acts and were they seeking power to perpetuate such acts, or were they engaged in rightful and proper acts in the pursuit of which they were duly entitled to protection? Did they not have eminent legal advisers and were not these advisers concerned chiefly to protect and perpetuate wrong-doing? At any rate, these legal minds knew the difference between right and wrong and were in position to guide the legislator. If they failed to do this and suffered as a consequence, they could blame no one but themselves.

No. falls 9.3% under 1914 and 10.2% below the January high record of 1913. As regards the individual cities, it is to be stated that by far the greater number exhibit losses, with the percentages quite large at many important Southern points and at such centres of speculative activity as Boston, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. But there are gains of noteworthy proportions at a number of far Western cities, particularly at Kansas City, Minneapolis, Duluth, Fargo, Pueblo, Aberdeen and Fremont. In fact the \"Other Western\" group of cities as a whole make a very satisfactory showing, benefiting from the large wheat crop and the increasing prices received therefor. It cannot be said that the re-opening of the New York Stock Exchange has resulted in any large volume of transactions, although for limited periods there has been some display of activity. On the contrary, with foreign orders a negligible quantity and hesitancy the predominant feature of the home trading, dealings in January were of greatly diminished volume. The transactions, in fact, reached only 5,076,210 shares, against 10,088,895 shares in 1913, were but about one-fifth the total of the month in 1910 and less than one-seventh of the 1906 record. Bonds, likewise, were dealt in much less freely, a par value of 57 million dollars comparing with 893/i millions last year. Boston's transactions reached only 486,320 shares and $752,500, against 639,426 shares and $1,590,100; and at Philadelphia the contrast was even less favorable-127,305 shares comparing with 471,456 shares. Restricted trade and inactivity in other directions continue to be reflected in the Canadian ClearingHouse returns. Almost every city of the 22 from which we have comparative figures records a more or less noticeable decline from 1914, with the losses conspicuously heavy in the Western Provinces. The total for all the cities for the month this year reaches $573,381,482, or 19.5% less than in 1914 and 28.8% Bank clearings for the opening month of the year smaller than for 1913. 1915, as presented on the first page of this issue, The statement of failures for the month of January while indicating somewhat greater activity in the commercial and industrial affairs of the country 1915 depicts clearly the stress under which the busithan in December of 1914, continue to furnish evi- ness concerns of the country labored in the opening dence of marked restraint in mercantile activity. month of the new year..

While, on the one hand, the President keeps asserting that there is no depression, on the other hand he insists that whatever depression there may be is simply psychological, the result of a state of mind. On this theory it would only be necessary to imagine that there was no war in Europe and the war would not exist. During the last fifteen months the President and all the members of his Cabinet have been assuring us that the country was on the eve of a new era as a result of the legislative policies of his Administration, and yet things have been going from bad to worse. At first it was a new tariff that was to work wonders. Then it was the enactment of the new Banking Law that was to start mills and furnaces with new energy through the release of credit and credit facilities from the clutches of the \"money power.\" Then Congress was kept continuously in session during the summer in order to insure \"freedom\" of trade and commerce by the enactment of the Trade Commission and the Omnibus Anti-Trust bills. Now the Shipping Bill is the one thing needed to fill the nation's cup of happiness to overflowing. Yet the traffic and revenues of the railroads are, as we see, shriveling up in alarming fashion, showing that even unprecedentedly high grain prices, an unparalleled demand for our foodstuffs and merchandise exports of unexampled dimensions do not suffice to insure prosperity in transportation and manufacturing where fundamentals are wrong. Mr. Wilson can think of no better explanation than to ascribe it all to a state of mind. Ex-President Taft comes nearer to hitting the nail on the head when he says, as he did in a speech the present week, that \"excessive hostility to capital has depressed our business, and the wage earners are the chief sufferers from the depression.\" FEB. 6 1915.] THE CHRONICLE the liabilities standing at $49,640,575 and $39,374,347 and $22,972,969, respectively.

In the manufacturing group one failure of unusual size, referred to above, served to unduly swell the total indebtedness in that division. Altogether, 551 insolvencies, for $27,041,279, were reported,these comparing with 407, for $16,780,939, in 1914. But with the Rumely failure out there remains only about 11 million dollars, or some 5Y 1 millions less than a year ago, indicating that here, too, the general run of debts was small. Among brokers, agents, &c., a considerable growth in the number who fell by the wayside is to be noted of January, but the liabilities at $2,371,400 are nearly 43/i millions less than in 1914,which is explained by the fact that there was a series of failures for large amounts in the month last year-6 for $5,739,545. Failures returns for the Dominion of Canada for January make somewhat similar comparison with last year, both as regards number and amount of indebtedness, as shown in the United States, as in each case increase is indicated. Specifically, 374 insolvencies for $3,523,710 in the month this year contrast with 226 and $2,029,680 in 1914. Trading debts of $2,280,102 compare with $1,013,196 a year ago; manufacturing liabilities total $1,106,205, against $989,684, and the failed indebtedness of brokers, agents, &c., aggregate $137,403, against $26,800 in 1914. The British Parliament re-assembled on Tuesday after a recess of the House of Commons since Nov. 27 and of the House of Lords since Jan. 6. There was none of the usual ceremony, members immediately taking up the various matters, chiefly financial, which have arisen as a result of the war and to which the business of the session will be confined. Some 200 of the 600 members of the Lower House are now at the front. Replying to a question put by a Labor member as to whether the Government was considering fixing food prices, Premier Asquith declared that \"all these matters are being carefully reviewed.\" The committee now having the matter in hand, the Premier continued, was receiving full information from the various departments of the Government, but he could not say when the inquiry would be concluded. The Government, however, was fully alive to the urgency of the matter. On Wednesday Mr. Asquith presented a resolution in the House of Commons asking the House to devote the present session entirely to Government measures. \"There is no precedent for this resolution,\" said the Premier, \"but all our energies as a nation are concentrated on the war, and every interest must be subordinated to this overmastering purpose. Accordingly, the Government purposes to take away the opportunity for private members to introduce bills, and will confine its legislative proposals to measures for the prosecution of the war.\" Bonar Law, leader of the Opposition, agreed to the resolution, saying that the Opposition intended to treat the present session of the House as a war session, as had been done in Canada and France. 427 The second war session of the Canadian Parliament was opened on Thursday by the Duke of Connaught, Governor-General of Canada, with the accustomed brilliancy which usually attends the ceremony but with unusual precautions to protect the Duke from hostile aliens. The State ball and drawing-room reception had been canceled. In his speech from the Throne the Governor-General explained the steps that had been taken to aid the mother country by sending an expeditionary force of more than 30,000 men. He declared that the \"earnest and resolute spirit of patriotism which animates the whole Dominion has evoked a magnificent response to the call for service beyond the seas. Large additional forces have been organized and further contingents are ready to be dispatched as soon as the necessary arrangements:for relieving them and completing their training can be consummated.\" The event that has attracted greatest attention in connection with the European war situation this week has been the formal announcement by the German Admiralty declaring the waters around Great Britain and Ireland, including the whole English Channel, a war zone from and after Feb. 18 1915. The announcement states that every enemy merchantship found in this war zone will be destroyed even if it is impossible to avert the dangers which threaten the crew and passengers. It is declared also that neutral ships in the war zone are in danger, as, \"in consequence of the misuse of neutral flags ordered by the British Government on Jan. 21, and in view of the hazards of naval warfare, it cannot always be avoided that attacks meant for enemy ships endanger neutral ships. Shipping northward around the Shetland Islands in the Eastern Basin of the North Sea and in a strip of about 30 nautical miles in breadth along the Dutch coast is endangered in the same way.\" The statement as to the misuse of neutral flags refers to what purports to be a secret order that has recently been published in Germany and alleged to have been issued by the British Admiralty to British ships instructing them to make use of neutral flags. The announcement of the war zone by the German Admiralty appears to be the German answer to the decision of the British Admiralty to seize all food ships destined for Germany, owing to the official German action commandeering all foodstuffs. A dispatch from Copenhagen quotes Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Imperial Chancellor of Germany, as declaring that \"England treats the United States as a beseiged fortress. Winston Churchill,\" the Chancellor continued, \"wants to starve a people numbering 70,000,000 in barbarian fashion. Against this effort Germany will use every opportunity to take revenge. With regard to the complaint that we are injuring neutral interests, neutral powers have not protested against England's action, and they must take the consequences. We certainly are not going to die of famine.\" A second warning to neutral shipping was issued by the German Admiralty yesterday. It advised vessels approaching Continental ports to take the track north of Scotland into the North Sea to avoid being sunk by mistake by German submarines off the northern and western coasts of France. It is difficult to reconcile this advice with the original declaration, which specifically declared the northern channel dangerous. 428 THE CHRONICLE It is considered in some circles that the new German move may force a change in tie British policy as to the transfer of belligerent merchantships to the American flag. It might be found advantageous to the British Government to permit the transfer of German ships to American register in order that as then neutral vessels they may be utilized for carrying supplies to England. Military operations on the Continent are showing increased activity. The effort of the German Field Marshal von Hindenburg to stop the advance of the Russians in East Prussia and in the Carpathians Mountains by compelling them to re-enforce their centre west of Warsaw has culminated in one of the most desperate conflicts of the war and one which is still in progress. Regiment after regiment, strongly supported by artillery,has beenflung againstthe Russian lines by the Germans. Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy losses on their opponents and each reports progress. The plan of the Russians at the moment appears to be to hold their positions already acquired and inflict as heavy losses on their enemies as possible. Meanwhile the Germans have sent strong re inforcements to check the advance of the Russians, who are reported to have reached a position south of the main range of the Carpathians and are thus overlooking the plains of Hungary. The Russian Emperor left for the front on Thursday. The German Kaiser is expected to return to the front after his visit to Wilhelmshaven, where he has been inspecting the fleet and bestowing iron crosses on the crew of the submarine U-21, which sank three British merchant steamers recently. In the western field of operations trench fighting continues with alternating successes. British ships are again reported to be bombarding the German positions on the Belgian coast, while the airmen of the Allies are dropping bombs on the German trenches. The Turks have this week made a definite attack on the Suez Canal, and have, it is stated, been driven off with heavy losses. The surrender of Lieut.-Col. Kemp and other South African rebels who have been receiving arms from the Germans, with whom they have recently quarreled, is expected to bring to an end the South African rebellion and enable Gen. Louis Botha to pursue his original design of invading German territory in Africa. [VOL. loo. Lieut.-Cols. Verduge and Orendain had joined the Villa forces. Villa gave as his reason for assuming the office of Provisional President that his forces had been separated from the Convention Government headed by Roque-Gonzales Garza. He telegraphed from Aguas Calientes to a press association in this country as follows: \"On account of communications having been cut off between the Convention Government and the division under my command, and as public service cannot be interrupted on the extensive zone which I control, I have found myself compelled to assume the political authority, creating three political administrative departments: the foreign affairs and justice department, in charge of Attorney M. Diaz Lombardo; State and communications, Gen. Luis de la Garza Cardenas; treasury and industry, Attorney Francisco Escudero.\" It is reported that Provisional President Garza has been slain. This report has not been confirmed. Another report was that Villa himself had been assassinated, but this obviously was untrue. An installment of £33,000,000 was paid by the London market on the British war loan this week.

The British Treasury has decided to set aside another £1,000,000 gold (making £23,500,000) toward the special gold reserve against the £36,000,000 emergency currency notes outstanding, representing 65% gold, plus the bankers' security behind the That money conditions are, on the notes. surface at least, permitting 'normal transactions is indicated by an order restricting the legal tender powers which, since August 7, British postal orders have enjoyed.

Treasury bills increased 494,000 marks, discounts showed an expansion of 63,854,000 marks and loans of 1,582,000 marks. There was an increase of 174,900,000 marks in note circulation and a decrease of 171,976,000 marks in deposits. The Bank's gold item now stands (once again at a new high level) at 2,163,753,000 marks, against 1,266,178,000 marks in 1914 and only 882,686,000 marks in 1913. The note circulation aggregates 4,664,588,000 marks, against 2,052,780,000 marks one year ago and 1,961,900,000 marks in 1913. The local money market still fails to show a reactionary tendency from the steady downward trend that has been so noticeable during the last few weeks. While quotations have not been formally changed, lenders are less independent in their selection of collateral. Six months' funds have loaned with some freedom at 332% this week on collateral, consisting of all industrial securities, while regular mixed collateral of the same maturity has been accepted on 33'i% transactions. A situation appears to have been reached, particularly in call money, where the banks and trust companies are maintaining rates at recent figures,and are not inclined to cut them for the purpose of influencing business. Especially is this the case in the matter of call loans. Applicationsfor new capital are becoming more general,and with the extremely easy situation that now exists this form of specific demand for funds may be expected to continue. Encouragement to apply for funds is contained in the success that greeted the offering last Monday of $49,000,000 Pennsylvania RR. 432% bonds through the company's bankers, Messrs. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. The allotments which were made on Wednesday showed that subscribers received only about 18% of their full applications, suggesting,in round numbers,afive-fold subscription. The Erie RR. on Thursday received the permission of the up-State Public Service Commission to pay 6% instead of 4% on old mortgages, and has placed $13,000,000 of the new bonds to retire short-term obligations. A syndicate composed of New York bankers acting with the Mercantile Trust & Deposit Co. of Baltimore, has been awarded the $8,500,000 Baltimore 4% semi-annual city bonds which were [VOL. 100. offered for public sale on Thursday. The bid price Of the syndicate was 97.827. The Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. has purchased about $1,000,000 5% City of Ottawa one-year notes. Kissel, Kinnicutt & Co. have purchased $5,475,000 Province of Manitoba five-year 5% gold debentures. Other Canadian notes are known to be in process of negotiation. Hence it is evident that financing new capital issues is likely to enter with increasing activity into local money market considerations in the immediate future. The supply of funds, however, seems sufficient• to take care of all offerings for some time without appreciably affecting interest rates. Last Saturday's statement of the New York Clearing House showed a further increase of $1,237,140 in the surplus of the banks and trust companies above reserve requirements, bringing the total of such surplus up to the impressive sum of $144,259,930. The aggregate reserve, in fact, increased $5,555,000, but the requirements were $4,317,860 larger, owing to increased deposits, net demand deposits having expanded $24,493,000 and net time deposits $1,451,000. There was an increase of $21,011,000 in loans, while circulation decreased $1,103,000. Reserves in \"own vaults\" increased $9,936,000, to $370,562,000, which includes $293,144,000 in specie. Reserve in Federal Reserve banks decreased $4,753,000, to $108,286,000, while reserves in other depositaries increased $372,000, to $32,075,000. We give the statement in complete form on a subsequent page. Referring to money rates in detail, deniand funds have been quoted within a range of 1%@23.%, while the renewal rate has again remained pegged at 2% throughout the entire week. On Monday 1%©2% was the range for Stock Exchange loans, on Tuesday 1%@2%, on Wednesday 2@23.(%, on Thursday 1%@2% and on Friday 1%@23/2%.Time money closed at 23'@29170for sixty days(unchanged for the week); 2%@3% for ninety days (also unchanged), 3% for four months (unchanged), and 3Y,1% for five and six months (unchanged).

For sterling exchange the market has developed considerable irregularity. The general trend has been toward a lower level by very moderate steps, which has suggested the absence of demand for remittances from various sources and especially the absence of a demand for bills against foreign sales of American securities. At the close, however, the German declaration of a war zone around the British Isles caused a moderate advance on the theory of a possible restriction of exports,and consequently in the supply of bills. Advices cabled from London suggest large sales of rubber to this country as responsible for some part of the strength that was shown in sterling exchange last week. Some selling against the establishment of credits here by the British Government has been a feature. Meanwhile, export trade continues to show a large excess over importations and is undoubtedly piling up a considerable volume of exchange each week that eventually must be liquidated. Cotton bills have been offered with increased freedom during the week. The Continental exchanges have shown very moderate movements dining the week.
