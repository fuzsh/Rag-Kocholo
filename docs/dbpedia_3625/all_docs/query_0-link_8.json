The 140 soldiers were tough and determined men from Sacramento, California, the advance guard of the Column from California, men destined to carve their names into the long and bloody history of the territory. They were, one soldier wrote, “made of stern stuff . . . men mured to mountain life . . . pioneers and miners; men self reliant and enduring; men equal to any emergency.”1 Despite having marched more than 900 sun-baked and fatiguing miles, all the way from the Pacific Coast, they were spoiling for a fight. “My men are the finest material I have ever seen, and anxious to strike a blow for the cause, ” the head of the California Column, Gen. James Henry Carleton, told the commander of the Union forces in New Mexico, Gen. Edward Richard Sprigg Canby.2 Reaching the Rio Grande on that sun-splashed afternoon in July, the men watered their thirsty and jaded horses in the flooded waters, rested for a few minutes, and began making camp for the evening. They also unfurled and raised a banner of thirty-four stars “amid the loud and continued cheers of the assembled command.” The momentous occasion was, Lt. Col. Edward E. Eyre of the First California Cavalry wrote, “the first time the Stars and Stripes floated on the Rio Grande below Fort Craig since the occupation of the country by the Confederate troops.” The day being “the anniversary of our National Independence,” Eyre continued, did “not • 1 •\n\n2 •\n\nintroduction\n\ndampen the ardor of the command.”³ The next day, the Californians moved downriver to occupy Fort Thorn, where they again raised their red, white, and blue flag. Two thousand miles to the east in Washington, D.C., the mood was somber and gloomy that summer of 1862. The badly bloodied and battered Union Army of the Potomac, the largest army ever assembled in the Western Hemisphere, had retreated from their defenses in front of Richmond, Virginia, to take refuge at Harrison’s Landing on the James River before retreating to Washington. Across the Blue Ridge Mountains to the west, Confederate cavalry was on the offensive, preparing to raid deep into Kentucky. On the Mississippi River, the seemingly impenetrable Rebel bastion of Vicksburg stood proud and defiant. Far to the west, in distant New Mexico Territory, however, the mood was different. What remained of the once proud Confederate Army of New Mexico was disorganized, defeated, hungry, and in retreat. But such had not been the case one year earlier. The Civil War came to New Mexico Territory and the vast expanses of the desert Southwest in the summer of 1861 with the occupation of the Mesilla Valley by the Indian-hating, fire-eating Southern zealot Lt. Col. John Robert Baylor and his Second Texas Mounted Rifles, many of them but mere boys in their teens. Following Texas’s secession in February 1861, Baylor occupied the chain of military posts that stretched 666 miles along the Lower Military Road from San Antonio to Franklin (El Paso). A man of considerable vigor and daring, Baylor had moved north up the Rio Grande from Fort Bliss and with barely 300 men occupied Mesilla.⁴ With a population of 2,240, Mesilla was the largest community between San Antonio and San Diego and a prize for the Texans. Greeted by exuberant Secessionists, he established his headquarters in the town, set out to win the Hispanic population to his cause, proclaimed a Confederate Territory of Arizona, and egotistically announced himself military governor. No sooner had the Confederates occupied Mesilla than the commander of nearby Fort Fillmore, the inept and aging Maj. Issac Lynde, moved to drive the Rebels out. On July 25, 1861, after leaving one company of his Seventh Infantry and the regimental band at the post, Lynde crossed the river with six companies of 380 men. When Colonel Baylor refused an “unconditional and immediate surrender” and replied that he would “fight first, and surrender afterwards,” Lynde advanced on the town. When he unleashed his artillery and sent his infantry on a halfhearted attack through a cornfield, they were fired on by the concealed Rebels and repulsed with ten casualties. With a final\n\nintroduction\n\n• 3\n\nartillery salvo and darkness approaching, the badly led Federals retreated back to Fort Fillmore. When Lynde heard rumors that the Confederates were bringing artillery forward, he ordered the post evacuated. Although he had no knowledge of the rocky road that led east through the barren Organ Mountains, Lynde was determined to reach the safety of Fort Stanton, 140 miles to the northeast. In the early morning darkness of July 27, 1861, Lynde set out with his Seventh Infantry and Mounted Rifles, hoping to reach the water at San Agustín Springs by evening, some twenty miles from the Rio Grande, just east of the 5,719-foot San Agustín Pass at the northern end of the picturesque Organ Mountains. Just after daylight, Baylor spotted a cloud of dust on the Fort Stanton Road, raised his telescope to see the Union column in full retreat, and galloped off in pursuit. By the time the Confederates caught up with the rear guard of the retreating Federals, the men of the Seventh Infantry had begun to falter as they approached the steep ascent to San Agustín Pass. Many of the men had made the mistake of filling their canteens with whiskey and were badly dehydrated. All along the road, the Confederates found abandoned supplies and equipment and “fainting, famished soldiers, who threw down their arms . . . and begged for water.” After riding through what is today Baylor Canyon, south of the main pass, Baylor reached the springs, where twenty-four sleeping Federals were quickly captured. Gaining the summit of the pass, the main Rebel column captured the Federal baggage train and artillery. Despite vehement and angry protests from many of his officers, Lynde agreed to surrender his 492-man force of eight companies of infantry and three companies of Mounted Rifles to 190 Confederates.5 In the weeks and months that followed, the disgraceful and highly publicized capitulation, one of the war’s early Confederate victories, reverberated from the Mesilla Valley all the way to Washington and back again.6 In the Union ranks in New Mexico and throughout the North, Lynde was vilified and proclaimed a traitor.7 Not long after the surrender at San Agustín Springs, news arrived at Mesilla that Forts Buchanan and Breckenridge in what is today the state of Arizona had been abandoned by the Federals and that two companies of dragoons and two companies of infantry were on their way to the Rio Grande. Receiving word of Lynde’s humiliating surrender, the Federals burned most of their supplies and spiked their cannon near Cooke’s Springs, west of Mesilla, and slipped through the mountains and across the desert to the safety of the Union bastion of Fort Craig.8\n\n4 •\n\nintroduction\n\nMatters were equally desperate for the Federals at Fort Stanton. When the Confederates occupied the Mesilla Valley, the post commander, Maj. Benjamin S. Roberts, worked to strengthen the fort’s defenses, but knew the post’s location made it impossible to defend against artillery. When a number of officers resigned and rode off to join the Confederates, Roberts asked his men to swear allegiance to the Union and reported a “universal cheerfulness and contentment.”9 Despite a “few Secessionists and bad men” who were living in the nearby village of La Placita (Lincoln) on the Rio Bonito below the fort, Roberts was determined to defend Fort Stanton, and scouts were kept out on the Pecos River and the road that led through the desert to Mesilla. At the same time, Roberts “destroyed several whiskey establishments” near the post.10 But on August 1, 1861, a fatigued corporal in the Mounted Rifles who had escaped the surrender at San Agustín Springs galloped into the post with the shocking news of Lynde’s surrender. Roberts, certain that Fort Stanton would be attacked, gave orders for his two companies of infantry and two companies of Mounted Rifles to march for Albuquerque. All public stores that could not be carried away were destroyed, and the post set on fire. A battery of artillery, spiked and dismounted, was also abandoned.11 No sooner were the Federals out of sight than a heavy rainstorm smothered the fire, and citizens from La Placita scurried to salvage what they could from the stores and equipment. Only days after the Federal evacuation, Capt. James Walker of Baylor’s Second Texas Mounted Rifles rode into Fort Stanton and secured the supplies that had not been burned or carried off. Leaving Lt. John R. Pulliam in command, Captain Walker rode back to the Rio Grande. During the brief Confederate occupation of the area, the Confederates were said to have plundered homes at La Placita and committed a number of outrages and rapes.12 On August 29, when three young Confederates were killed by Mescaleros in the Gallinas Mountains, what remained of the Texans on the Rio Bonito retreated to the Rio Grande, and Fort Stanton lay abandoned.13 As Baylor and his Second Texas headed west in the early summer of 1861, a Louisiana-born, forty-five-year-old major in the United States Army by the name of Henry Hopkins Sibley resigned his commission and made his way to Richmond. In the Confederate capital, Sibley persuaded President Jefferson Davis, long a proponent of Manifest Destiny, of a grandiose and far-reaching scheme to seize New Mexico, Colorado, and the valuable ports and gold fields of California.14 “On to San Francisco!” would be the battle cry. With a brigadier general’s commission in his pocket, Sibley rushed to\n\nintroduction\n\n• 5\n\nSan Antonio, where he organized three regiments, the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Texas Mounted Volunteers, mostly Texas farmboys, into the Sibley Brigade. Moving west through the parched deserts and twisting canyons of the Trans-Pecos to Fort Bliss, Sibley pushed north up the Rio Grande into the Mesilla Valley, where he incorporated Baylor’s Second Texas into his Army of New Mexico.15 From Mesilla, Sibley sent Capt. Sherod Hunter and a company of “Arizona Rangers” west to Tucson to open communications with Sonora, Mexico, and to scout along the Gila River to the west to detect any movement of Union forces from Fort Yuma. With an army of 2,590 men, fifteen pieces of artillery, and an extensive supply train, Sibley cautiously moved north out of the Mesilla Valley in the frigid late winter of 1862. To meet the Confederate advance, Colonel Canby concentrated 3,800 men, the largest army the territory had ever seen, in and around Fort Craig. The Union army consisted of 1,200 Regulars and 2,600 hastily organized New Mexico and Colorado Volunteers, along with several companies of poorly equipped New Mexico Militia. Finding Fort Craig too strong to be taken by assault, Sibley moved his army to the east bank of the river in hopes of bypassing the Union bastion. Along the east bank of the Rio Grande, on February 21, 1862, five miles upriver from Fort Craig, Canby moved to stop the Confederate advance. The turning point in the bloody Battle of Valverde came late in the afternoon when the shotgun- and Bowie knife–wielding Texans launched a furious charge against a battery of artillery in the Union center commanded by a gallant and unwavering North Carolinian, Capt. Alexander McRae. Although McRae’s battery poured a devastating “fire of round shot, grape, and shell” into the charging Texans, the Rebels fell on the Union battery with a hand-to-hand savagery rarely seen in the annals of American military history.16 Although Canby tried to rally his troops to regain the Federal guns, the Rebel Texans won the day. The captured guns, dubbed the “Valverde Battery,” would remain the pride of the Sibley Brigade for the remainder of the war. In the Battle of Valverde, the largest Civil War battle in the Southwest, Union casualties numbered 100 killed and 160 wounded; 72 Texans lay dead, and 157 wounded.17 Still reluctant to assault Fort Craig, Sibley moved his army up the Rio Grande, seizing Socorro, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and although slowed by snowstorms, sickness, and lack of supplies, he advanced on Fort Union, the Federal supply depot for the Southwest and the key to Raton Pass and the Colorado placer mines. On March 12, at the southern end of the towering and snow-crowned Sangre de Cristo Mountains, at a point\n\n6 •\n\nintroduction\n\nwhere the Santa Fe Trail wound through the rugged confines of Apache Canyon, the advance guard of the Rebel army, 400 men under Maj. Charles L. Pyron, ran head on into 420 men of the First Colorado Volunteers led by Maj. John M. Chivington, hardy men from the gold-mining camps around Denver.18 Although the “Pikes Peakers,” as the Texans called them, repulsed the Confederates, the Rebels under Col. William Read “Dirty Shirt” Scurry regrouped and advanced through the piñon and pine hillsides of Glorieta Pass. Just east of the wooded pass, on March 28, 1862, near an adobe way station on the Santa Fe Trail called Pigeon’s Ranch, not far from the crumbling ancient ruins of Pecos Pueblo, the Texans ran into Col. John Potts Slough and 850 Colorado miners. Although the Texans again won the field, a daring flanking movement by Major Chivington managed to destroy the entire Confederate supply train at Johnson’s Ranch in Apache Canyon in the Confederate rear. With the billowing smoke from the depths of the canyon and the angry cries of brave men fighting and dying went any dream of conquering New Mexico and the Far West. With his supply lines blocked, Sibley and his army of 1,800 hungry, demoralized, and homesick men gave up Santa Fe and began evacuating the territory. After skirmishes at Albuquerque and Peralta, the increasingly desperate Rebels abandoned the river for a little-known route by way of the Magdalena and San Mateo mountains. For six weary days, the hungry Texans, dragging their captured “Valverde Battery” with them, stumbled south through barren wastes to reach the Rio Grande below Fort Craig and eventually the safety of the Mesilla Valley. After leaving Col. William Steele’s Seventh Texas behind at Mesilla, Sibley’s defeated army hastened east, back to where they had come from, in the hot summer of 1862. Short of supplies and with a sizeable army approaching from California, Steele, too, soon headed east.19 Sibley’s New Mexico campaign was a disaster unparalleled in the history of the Southwest. As many as 500 Texans in homespun and butternut lay dead from battle and disease. Just as many Confederates were prisoners of war. In all, one-third of the once proud Army of New Mexico had been lost, and the hopes for a Confederate empire in the Southwest vanished in the clear desert air. Too much had been expected of so few. The Californians who came to the Rio Grande to drive Sibley’s Confederates from New Mexico that summer of 1862 were the vanguard of some 1,400 men who would eventually occupy the territory and far west Texas. They were part of the 2,350-man Column from California, fifteen infantry companies, five companies of cavalry, and an artillery battery.\n\nintroduction\n\n• 7\n\nNew Mexico Territory during the Confederate Invasion, 1861–1862.\n\nThrough scorching 120-degree heat and the worst drought in thirty years, the men established depots and supply lines that stretched hundreds of miles across the Colorado Desert and east along the Gila Trail from Fort Yuma to the Pima Villages, Tucson, and the heart of Apachería. They crossed the Sonoran Desert, or what was called the “Great Desert” at the\n\n8 •\n\nintroduction\n\ntime, one of the most inhospitable places in North America, and they were determined to etch their name in Civil War history. The commander of the Column from California, cold-eyed Gen. James Henry Carleton, was a ruthless, hardheaded, twenty-three-year veteran of the First United States Dragoons.20 Like most Americans at the time, he saw Hispanics and Native Americans as depraved and ignorant and as an impediment to the advance of civilization and the American empire. He would try to exterminate many of the latter by using the former to assist him. From Fort Yuma and Tucson on his way to New Mexico, Carleton tried repeatedly to communicate with General Canby by way of the Gila and Salt rivers, saying he was on his way with a battery of artillery and fifteen companies of infantry and five companies of cavalry. He had established martial law in the soon-to-be created Territory of Arizona and was under orders “to recapture all the works in New Mexico which had been surrendered to rebels.” Due to floodwaters, however, the courier had turned back, and Carleton had been forced to hire several Mexican expressmen to carry the message across Sonora and Chihuahua to El Paso del Norte and then up the Rio Grande.21 The Mexicans, too, ran into uncounted dangers and were forced to turn back. Desperate to communicate with Canby, Carleton next sent three men directly east along the overland trail, but two of the men were killed by Indians at Apache Pass. After “a miraculous escape and a perilous ride” of 160 miles, a third man, John W. Jones, arrived on the Rio Grande at Picacho, above Mesilla, only to collapse from exhaustion in a “half-delirious” state; he was captured, and his dispatches seized.22 Only two days after arriving on the Rio Grande, Lieutenant Colonel Eyre received an express from Chivington, now a colonel in command of the Southern Military District at Fort Craig, directing him to arrange an exchange of prisoners with Colonel Steele. Chivington and Carleton were hoping that Capt. William McCleave and nine of his men who had been taken by Capt. Sherod Hunter’s Confederates near the Pima Villages in March 1862 could be exchanged for two Texan lieutenants held at Fort Craig. As Eyre prepared to send an express to Mesilla under a white flag, a party of men came riding upriver led by Captain McCleave. Colonel Steele had released McCleave and his men in exchange for Capt. James W. Gardner, who had been badly wounded at Valverde and taken captive while in the hospital at Socorro. The only problem was that Gardner had died a week earlier at Fort Craig. In response, Eyre sent Capt. Emil Fritz to Mesilla hoping to obtain the release of John Jones, the fearless expressman\n\nintroduction\n\n• 9\n\nand scout, along with an outspoken Mesilla Unionist, John Lemon, who had been mistreated and almost hanged by the Rebels. Within days, Fritz returned, saying he had arranged to have two Rebel lieutenants exchanged for McCleave.23 On July 8, the Californians were joined by Capt. George Washington Howland and 100 men of the Third United States Cavalry from Fort Craig. Eyre then pushed downriver to the San Diego Crossing, where he began ferrying his men to the east bank of the river in a small boat the Confederates had failed to destroy and on a small raft constructed by the Californians and floated downriver from Fort Thorn. No sooner was Eyre across the river than he received orders telling him not to do so until Colonel Chivington could join him from Fort Craig with 700 infantry, 200 cavalry, and a battery of artillery.24 Surmising that Chivington wanted the glory of raising the Stars and Stripes over Mesilla, Eyre continued downriver anyway.25 Finding no forage at Doña Ana, he pressed on to Las Cruces, where he expected to find the rear guard of the Texans. Disillusioned and plagued by desertions, the Confederates, he learned, were already at Franklin.26 Eyre was sure he could capture the increasingly desperate and destitute Texans, but any attempt to do so would be a blatant violation of orders he had already disregarded.27 On August 7, 1862, as Eyre’s small army settled into camp in the Mesilla Valley, Carleton and two companies of cavalry arrived on the Rio Grande. Departing Tucson only days apart, other units of the California Column quickly followed. Carleton was proud and excited. California “has reason to be proud of the sons she has sent across the continent to assist in the great struggle in which our country is now engaged,” he wrote.28 On the way east, the forty-eight-year-old Carleton had already encountered problems that would come to consume him and his command. Two miles east of a craggy Apache Pass, at the south end of the Dos Cabezas Mountains, Carleton had come across the remains of nine miners killed and tortured by the Apaches.29 When fighting later erupted with the Chiricahuas, he was forced to establish a post at Apache Pass called Fort Bowie. While on the march, Carleton also learned that the entire population of the small mining settlement of Pinos Altos, men, women, and children, were in a “destitute and starving condition.” In response, he sent Capt. Edmond D. Shirland and a small detachment of men with five beeves, 600 pounds of pemmican, 3,000 pounds of flour, and 1,500 pounds of sugar to the “starving people.”30 Shirland arrived at the mines on August 7 to find\n\n10 •\n\nintroduction\n\nthe population “extremely poor and destitute,” and “living on purslane and roots, and several . . . insane from hunger.”31 Crossing the flooded Rio Grande at the San Diego Crossing, Carleton reached Las Cruces on August 10 to find Eyre anxiously awaiting his arrival. Proclaiming an end to the “era of anarchy and misrule,” Carleton announced martial law and began confiscating the property of Confederate sympathizers. All communities were to establish sanitary regulations, clean the streets, and establish marketplaces. Carleton said he had spent five years in the territory, and he promised to respect the “character and wants of the people.”32 Like Eyre, Carleton was disappointed that the Federals had not been able to capture the rear guard of the Rebel army. Burning wagons and destroying what remained of their ammunition, the defeated and demoralized Confederates had fled downriver into Texas. Before leaving the Mesilla Valley, however, Colonel Steele had given orders to seize all the animals and fodder in the valley. At bayonet point, the local population had been forced to accept worthless Confederate script. Near Mesilla, Steele sent Capt. William Clever to seize horses and mules, as well as “all the beef cattle and work oxen” and “to take from the Mexicans any rifle, musket, or other guns suitable for military purposes.”33 The situation was so bad at Mesilla that the Rebels had gone into the fields “to take the Mexicans’ work oxen and mules in order to get transportation for Texas,” a Union soldier recorded. The remnants of the Rebel army “have robbed the country of everything in it,” he continued.34 Although Colonel Steele had made peace with the Spanish-speaking population of the valley, many in that population now saw their livelihoods endangered and their families threatened, so they began to resist violently, attacking the Texans in a bloody battle near Mesilla on July 2 in which the Rebels lost seven men, including Captain Clever. As many as forty of the Hispanos were said to have died in the vicious fighting, much of it hand to hand.35 At the same time, the increasingly desperate Confederates were also raiding the small villages below El Paso, “robbing and plundering everything they could get their hands on,” a Union soldier noted.36 When a detail of fifteen Confederates went to the adobe village of Socorro, fifty angry villagers attacked them, killed one of their men, and took several others prisoner. On the morning of June 15, to teach the Hispanos a lesson and obtain the release of the prisoners, Capt. William L. Kirksey took Company E of the Seventh Texas, along with two six-pounder cannon from Maj. Trevanion T. Teel’s artillery battery, and proceeded to Socorro. A vicious fight erupted\n\nintroduction\n\n• 11\n\nwith 250 villagers in which several citizens were killed. Homes in the community were badly damaged by artillery fire, as was the village church, Nuestra Señora de la Concepción.37 Although the Texan prisoners were rescued, the villagers killed several Rebel stragglers. As the beleaguered and defeated men in gray, many of them hungry, demoralized, and fatigued, struck east through the arid expanses and cactusstudded canyons of the Trans-Pecos for San Antonio, Carleton arrived at Mesilla to find the entire valley flooded. The rampaging Rio Grande had “broken across the country,” he wrote, and left Mesilla on an island in the midst of a vast lake.38 Not long after arriving at Mesilla, he set out for Franklin with three companies of cavalry, still disappointed that the Rebels had not stood and fought. At Franklin, all that remained of the Confederate army were twenty-five sick and disabled men in a makeshift hospital.39 After raising the Stars and Stripes over Fort Bliss, Carleton headed downriver, hoping to restore “the confidence of the people.” The “abhorrence they expressed for the Confederate troops and of the rebellion,” he concluded, was evidence of their loyalty to the United States.40 Carleton somehow confused the Hispanos’ disdain of the Rebels with patriotism toward the United States. Nevertheless, events were accelerating fast. On August 22, Capt. John C. Cremony’s company of the Second California Cavalry hoisted the flag over Fort Quitman while Captain Shirland and his company set out for Fort Davis, some 140 miles to the east.41 Leaving the Rio Grande on the afternoon of August 23, Shirland rode through a forest of ocotillos and the rocky confines of Quitman Canyon to find Eagle Springs filled with rubbish and rotting sheep carcasses, a parting gift from the Mescalero Apaches to the retreating Texans and a warning to the men from California. Here, on the northern flank of the picturesque Eagle Mountains, more Confederate equipment was found destroyed. Continuing east the next day, Shirland found Van Horn Wells filled with more carrion. After cleaning the springs, he could not find enough water to sustain his company, so he took twenty men and continued southeast along the San Antonio–El Paso Road, the bulk of his company returning to Eagle Springs to wait for him eight days before returning to the river. Escaping the scorching daytime heat, the men rode through the night to Dead Man’s Hole on the southwestern flank of the Davis Mountains, where Shirland found enough water for his men and horses. After a few hours’ rest, he continued on to Barrel Springs. The next afternoon, he sent two men forward with a Mexican guide to “find out the condition of affairs at Fort Davis.”42\n\n12 •\n\nintroduction\n\nWhen the fort was reported abandoned, Shirland rode into the post on August 29. After symbolically raising the Stars and Stripes over the commanding officers’ quarters, he hurriedly made a survey of the buildings at the post, even the small wooden outhouses. Some of the structures had been burned, and others were missing doors and windows thanks to Edward Hall, a ruffian from Presidio del Norte, and other scavengers. In the office of the Overland Mail Company, the badly decomposed remains of a man, apparently killed by Indians, were found lying on the floor with several bullet and arrow wounds.43 Shirland ordered that the ghastly remains of the man be removed and buried. Only one day after arriving at Fort Davis, Captain Shirland returned west only to encounter a large and hostile party of Mescaleros blocking the road. In a desperate “running fight” over several miles, four of the Indians were killed, and two of Shirland’s troopers were wounded, one man seriously. By September 2, Shirland’s fatigued horsemen were back on the Rio Grande.44 Carleton was proud of Shirland and his men, who had hoisted the colors “240 miles into the State of Texas” and “whipped the Indians” at the same time.45 With news that the California Column had arrived in far west Texas, Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, who was preparing to occupy the lower Rio Grande valley with 7,000 bluecoats, wrote Carleton, proposing that the two forces link up to seal the entire 804-mile Texas-Mexico border. By so doing, they could cut the flow of cotton into Mexico and strangle Texas economically. Perhaps the two armies could even meet in San Antonio. The presence of Union forces in Texas, President Abraham Lincoln thought, would provide a haven for beleaguered and brutalized Union refugees who were fleeing the state in ever-increasing numbers. Most were crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico, but a few were heading west into the vast expanses of the Trans-Pecos. A Federal force on the Rio Grande could also wave the Stars and Stripes at the French Imperialistas and perhaps intimidate them into leaving Mexico. Communications for the two Union armies proved difficult. No sooner had the ambitious Banks and his army in blue waded ashore on Brazos Island in November 1863 than he dispatched a courier with a message for Carleton. The horseman, however, was overtaken and attacked forty-five miles north of Eagle Pass near San Felipe Springs, where he was badly wounded by four Mexicans hired by the “Christ killing Jew[ish] cotton speculators,” a Union guerrilla asserted.46 A second letter did get through\n\nintroduction\n\n• 13\n\nby way of Monterrey, Parras, and Chihuahua, and in early December 1863 was finally carried north across the desert to Franklin and then Mesilla.47 With the encouragement of Myndert M. Kimmey, the American vice consul at Monterrey, Carleton thought seriously of sending a small force to destroy the cotton being crossed at Eagle Pass. Here, he thought, 250 desperate Texas Unionists who had congregated in Monterrey could join him. Commanding from Hart’s Mill at Franklin, Col. Joseph Rodman West promised to enlist the men and pay the usual bounty, but they would need to travel by way of Chihuahua and cross the border at El Paso del Norte.48 On December 27, 1862, a Texas-German Unionist named Fritz Tegener arrived at Mesilla, saying he had escaped an attack on seventy Texas Unionists on August 10, 1862, on the West Fork of the Nueces River, in which nineteen men had been killed and nine executed. Tegener said there were large numbers of Unionists in the Texas Hill Country who were “cruelly oppressed and who would cooperate with any U.S. troops sent to their rescue.”49 By April 1864, Chief of Staff Henry W. Halleck realized the Union army would not be able to advance far into the vast Trans-Pecos. He urged Carleton, nevertheless, to launch a “demonstration . . . on the upper Rio Grande which would at least embarrass the rebels in that quarter.”50 Carleton knew that to push any sizeable force across the vast expanses of the Trans-Pecos would be a logistical nightmare similar to what he had experienced in crossing the Sonoran Desert from California. By this time, Carleton had come to fear a sizeable Confederate advance from Texas, and he was in more of a defensive mode anyway. Problems with the Navajos and Apaches, who were fighting to maintain control of their lands and their way of life, were also consuming more and more of his time and troop commitments. A small reconnaissance of General Banks’s army did advance upriver from Brownsville in March 1864, only to be turned back in a spirited defense by a small band of Confederates at Laredo. Union authorities managed to stir up considerable excitement in the area around Eagle Pass, but any full-scale invasion of the interior of Texas never materialized from either Carleton or Banks.51 Carleton was at Franklin on the morning of September 2 when he received an urgent express from Santa Fe ordering him to turn over command of the District of Arizona to Colonel West and to proceed to Santa Fe to assume command of the Department of New Mexico.52 Before leaving Franklin, he made arrangements to have the Confederate sick and wounded paroled and sent east toward San Antonio. Escorted by Lt. Nathaniel J.\n\n14 •\n\nintroduction\n\nPishon, the Rebels were given forty days’ rations, medicines, and wagons for those who could not walk.53 Leaving Franklin one day later, Carleton stopped at Las Cruces to transfer command of the District of Arizona to Colonel West before continuing north. Carleton was crossing the dreaded Jornada del Muerto with a small escort on September 8 when he met ninety-three ragged Confederate convalescents headed south, men left behind in New Mexico who had been paroled and were bound for San Antonio. “Keep them moving. Have no delays at Fillmore. . . . Do not let them delay at all at Franklin,” Carleton told West. The Texans should not “know the full extent of our force now en route from California.”54 At Fort Craig on September 9, he paused briefly to inspect the post and the garrison before continuing north to Santa Fe.55 After Carleton arrived in the capital on September 16, the always judicious General Canby transferred command to the brash old frontier dragoon and departed for Washington. Only two days later, Carleton issued orders naming the men who would help him command the military in the territory. Many were individuals he had known and trusted in the “Old Army,” and others were men from California who had proved themselves on the long and arduous trek from California. Appointed as acting inspector general was Maj. Henry Davies Wallen of the Seventh United States Infantry, an attentive, articulate, and portly West Point graduate who was commanding Fort Union at the time.56 Born in Savannah, Georgia, on April 19, 1819, Wallen was appointed to West Point from Florida and graduated thirty-fourth in the class of 1840 that included William Tecumseh Sherman, George Henry Thomas, Richard Stoddert Ewell, and William Steele. Breveted a second lieutenant in the Third Infantry, he transferred to the Fourth Infantry, served in Florida, and was wounded in the opening battle of the Mexican War at Palo Alto. Wallen had been with Gen. Zachary Taylor in northeastern Mexico, was promoted to regimental quartermaster, and then to adjutant in February 1849. Advanced to captain in 1850, he was sent to the Northwest, was in the Yakima Expedition of 1855, and took part in a large expedition that laid out a 630-mile wagon trail from Fort Dalles, Oregon Territory, to the Valley of Great Salt Lake in 1859.57 One of several Southerners in the territory remaining loyal to the Union, Wallen transferred to the Seventh Infantry in November 1861 and was promoted to major. Wallen had left many “kindren and friends to remain true to my flag.”58 Another loyal Southerner, Capt. Andrew Wallace Evans of the Sixth\n\nintroduction\n\n• 15\n\nHenry Davies Wallen, ca. 1870. Courtesy National Archives.\n\n16 •\n\nintroduction\n\nAndrew Wallace Evans in 1873. Courtesy National Archives.\n\nintroduction\n\n• 17\n\nUnited States Cavalry was named acting assistant inspector general and commissary of musters. After attending Harvard College briefly, Evans was appointed to West Point from Maryland, where he graduated twenty-sixth in the class of 1852 and was breveted a second lieutenant in the Seventh Infantry. He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1855 and first lieutenant the following year. Made a captain in the Third Cavalry in May 1861, Evans transferred to the Sixth Cavalry three months later.59 At the time of the Confederate invasion of New Mexico, he was commanding the Western District of New Mexico from Cubero, an isolated rock-and-adobe village fifty-two miles west of Albuquerque at the base of the 11,301-foot summit of Mt. Taylor. At the Battle of Valverde, a bloody confrontation in February 1862 that Alexander Evans, the captain’s brother and a former Whig congressman from Maryland, called “a sharp piece of work,” Captain Evans served ably and honorably on Canby’s staff.60 Carleton badly needed capable officers, and both Wallen and Evans were deemed worthy. Although able, both men were serving in New Mexico reluctantly. Largely through the inf luences of his more famous brother, Evans had repeatedly asked to join the Army of the Potomac. Long after the Confederate reversal at the Battle of Glorieta, the governor of Maryland, Augustus Williamson Bradford, asked that Evans be ordered east to command the First Maryland Volunteer Cavalry with “as little delay as possible.” The general in chief at the time, Henry Wager Halleck, flatly refused, writing that under no circumstances could Evans “be withdrawn from New Mexico.”61 For Wallen, the war began on November 25, 1861, when he arrived in Washington, D.C., from Fort Cascades, Washington Territory, only to learn that a large part of his Seventh United States Infantry had been taken prisoner at San Agustín Pass, in far-off New Mexico Territory. Like Evans, he wanted to fight in the East, where he knew the war would be decided and where he thought his children could take pride in his “faithful adherence to the government in this time of trouble.” He went to see President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, and army commander Gen. Winfield Scott. Months later he wrote Gen. George McClellan, saying that he wanted to be made a brigadier general of volunteers, that his heart was with “the cause of my country; and I desire, in this her hour of trial, not only to express my loyalty in words, but to prove it by taking any command you may do me the honor to confer upon me.”62 If he could not fight in the East, he would go anywhere, even to Kentucky or Missouri.\n\n18 •\n\nintroduction\n\nOn January 8, 1862, Wallen was ordered to New Mexico, and he immediately asked to be relieved of the orders, but was told that he must go to New Mexico and that it was vitally important that he take charge of funds to pay the army in the territory. Arriving at St. Louis with orders to escort a large payroll to Santa Fe, he telegraphed General Thomas, still pleading to join the Union army in Missouri, at the time commanded by General Halleck. In response, General Thomas told him to go to New Mexico. Arriving at Fort Riley and finding the Santa Fe Trail “occupied by guerillas,” Wallen telegraphed Secretary of War Stanton, asking for a change of orders. Stanton flatly refused, telling him he must proceed to Santa Fe and report to General Canby.63 Wallen next tried to persuade Gen. John C. Fremont, who was commanding the Mountain Department at Wheeling, Virginia, to request his services. Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas refused the request, however, and when Wallen finally arrived in New Mexico in June 1862, Canby placed him in command of Fort Union.64 In the months that followed their appointments, Wallen and Evans spent a considerable amount of time dealing with the aftermath of the Confederate invasion. No sooner had they assumed their new duties than they were selected to serve on a highly charged court of inquiry that investigated the conduct of Capt. Richard S. C. Lord at the Battle of Valverde. A veteran of the First United States Cavalry, the Ohio-born Lord requested the investigation after reports by Maj. James Lowry Donaldson and Lt. Charles Meinhold appeared in the Santa Fe Weekly Gazette saying he had “fled ingloriously from the battlefield.” 65 In the heat of battle, Lord allegedly refused orders from Donaldson to advance with his company to the defense of Capt. Alexander McRae’s artillery battery. Later at Los Lunas in March 1862, it was also asserted that Lord had proposed surrendering his small force. Evidence in the case had been heard at Peralta in May 1862, but the court had dissolved because of the “absence of important witnesses.”66 The new court assembled at Santa Fe on October 3, with Wallen as president and Evans as judge advocate. Doctors Elisha Ingram Baily, medical director of the department, and James M. McNulty, surgeon in the First California Infantry, also served on the court. After waiting several days for Captain Lord to arrive, the court finally began deliberations in Santa Fe on the morning of October 7. With Capt. Henry Raymond Selden of the Fifth Infantry acting as Lord’s counsel, defense witnesses included lieutenants Charles Meinhold, William T. Pennock, and Reuben F. Bernard; First Sergeant John Walker of Lord’s Company D of the First Cavalry; and, of\n\nintroduction\n\n• 19\n\ncourse, Lord himself. Although Major Donaldson stated in a sworn affidavit that he had repeatedly ordered Lord to advance to McRae’s defense, he was not sure, in the confusion of battle, if he had given the order personally. Moreover, Donaldson said, he had intended neither to imply that Lord was a coward nor to question Lord’s courage or his dedication to the Union. After four days of grueling testimony, the court concluded that what had been said in the Santa Fe Weekly Gazette was largely false. Lord had not fled from the field and had made every effort to recapture the Federal guns. Besides, Donaldson was not in uniform at Valverde, and the soldiers in Lord’s command were therefore not “bound to recognize his orders.” Furthermore, Donaldson had not given orders in person, and his account of Lord’s actions was incorrect. At Los Lunas, Lord was without guides and had no provisions, his horses were jaded, and he was between “two superior forces of the enemy.” Considering the “true light” of the situation, the court exonerated him and recommended “no further action should be taken in the case.” Still embittered, Lord rode east, where he distinguished himself at Gettysburg and Petersburg.67 Wallen also served as president and Evans as judge advocate in a twelveman military commission that tried José María Rivas as a Confederate spy. A citizen of Chihuahua and a musician by profession, Rivas had crossed the Rio Grande to provide forage for the Rebels at Fort Davis, Van Horn Wells, and Eagle Springs. He later drifted west and then north into the Mesilla Valley to carry dispatches to Pinos Altos and scout for Capt. Bethel Coopwood at Cañada Alamosa. Nine days before the Battle of Valverde, Rivas had been captured near Bosque Bonito, below Fort Craig, by Capt. James “Paddy” Graydon’s company of the New Mexico Volunteers, imprisoned at Fort Craig, and taken to Santa Fe in chains. Unable to defend himself and with Captain Graydon providing incriminating evidence that he had acted as a spy for both Baylor and Sibley, Rivas was found guilty, and the commission sentenced him to “be shot to death by a detachment of New Mexican Volunteers.”68 Although General Canby approved the findings, he suspended the sentence and sent Rivas to Fort Union. Three months later President Lincoln concluded Rivas had been convicted largely on hearsay. Although he had been captured within Union lines, he never admitted to being a “spy” and probably had not understood the “technical meaning of the term.” As far as Lincoln was concerned, Rivas was a Rebel scout and a prisoner of war not subject to execution. Other soldiers were not as fortunate as Rivas. A general court-martial\n\n20 •\n\nintroduction\n\nat Fort Garland in May 1863 found Pvt. Humberto Carbajal of the First New Mexico Infantry guilty of murder and ordered him executed. Carbajal was accused of shooting Pvt. Francisco Lujan in the back of his head while the latter slept in the company quarters at the post. Testimony indicated that Carbajal had been drunk and had cursed Lujan the night before the shooting. Carbajal, saying he was tempted by the devil, offered to serve five additional years in the army and give all his pay to the widow of the deceased. Unmoved, the court sentenced him “to be hung by the neck until . . . dead, dead, dead.” With both Col. John M. Chivington, commanding the District of Colorado, and Gen. John McAllister Schofield, administering the Department of Missouri, approving the sentence, Carbajal was hanged at Denver City on November 27, 1863.69 Other soldiers in the Department of New Mexico were executed, including Joseph Coffield, a private in the First New Mexico Cavalry who was found guilty of murder and shot by firing squad in December 1863, and Juan Madrid, a private in the First New Mexico Cavalry, who was found guilty of murder in September 1865 and hanged the following year.70 After being appointed inspector general, Wallen served on a board of officers with orders to select a new military post in the Navajo country to be named in honor of the departed General Canby.71 Wallen also spent endless hours planning for a second Confederate invasion. Although the approach of the California Column hastened the departure of the Rebel army from the Mesilla Valley, Carleton concluded that a second Confederate invasion was inevitable. Rumors crept down the Santa Fe Trail from Fort Leavenworth that a Rebel force was preparing to move north out of Texas, seize Fort Larned and Fort Lyon, and cut New Mexico’s vital link to Missouri. If fact, a “considerable force” of Rebels was within days of the Arkansas River.72 At Grey’s Ranch on the Rio Las Animas in southwestern Colorado, it was said that 100 men of “known secession proclivities” were preparing to join the Confederate army.73 As early as September 1862, Rafael Luna, Indian agent from Los Lunas, had met a party of friendly Comanches between the Arkansas and Cimarron rivers who said that a force of Texans was camped on the Llano Estacado about 350 miles east of the Pecos River. When asked how many Texans the Comanches had seen, the Indians responded, “mucho.”74 In response, Acting Governor William Frederick Milton Arny emphatically told Secretary of State William H. Seward that a large number of Confederates was preparing to invade the territory to use New Mexico as a springboard to Colorado\n\nintroduction\n\n• 21\n\nand Utah to “establish a number of slave states.”75 In May 1863, Comanches under Chief Re-sheh-keepah appeared at Anton Chico and Chaperito, on the western fringes of the Llano Estacado, to report a large party of Confederates with many tents and five pieces of artillery north of the overland mail route, between the Pecos and Canadian rivers, “marching to New Mexico.” The Comanches said they had taken a “great many horses from the Texans.”76 Should the Confederates indeed continue west, the Indians promised to send an express into Camp Easton, a recently established Federal outpost on the Canadian River southwest of Fort Union.77 Many in the army did not believe the Comanches, thinking they were concocting stories of invading Texans to ingratiate themselves with the Federals in hopes of receiving rations. Carleton and Wallen were not so sure. Well into 1863, Carleton remained convinced that a Confederate advance was certain, and he worked hard to obtain any information that would give him advance warning. He also asked Wallen to study the various routes the Rebels might use in invading the territory. Wallen was initially reluctant to undertake such an inquiry because he had “been but a short time in the country.”78 Nevertheless, he gathered every map he could find at department headquarters and studied the geography of West Texas and New Mexico. Any movement would probably come by way of the San Antonio–El Paso Road, he concluded, as had been the case in 1861–62. Moreover, if Col. John Robert Baylor was to lead the invasion, as it was widely speculated, Wallen was certain the invasion would come by way of Franklin because Baylor knew “the country well” and “was liked while there.” Besides, the road from San Antonio to Franklin could be “traveled at all seasons of the year.”79 At the same time, Wallen did not rule out a Rebel advance up the Pecos River or across the vast expanses of the Llano Estacado by way of the Canadian River. Any invasion by way of the Canadian was certain to strike for the Pecos River at Anton Chico before moving against Fort Union, he concluded. This route was impractical in winter due to the lack of fuel, however. The Texans might well use the route taken by the ill-fated 1842 Santa Fe Expedition and turn west along the Butterfield Stage route to Franklin. Wallen also thought there was a remote possibility the Rebels might advance on New Mexico by way of Chihuahua, although such an expedition was certain to raise the ire of the Mexicans and make a “great stir.” If the Mexicans denied use of their territory, the audacious Confederates, he speculated, might well try to “force [their] way through the country.”80\n\n22 •\n\nintroduction\n\nMany of the people in the Mesilla Valley and in the small villages below El Paso were “much alarmed” with rumors of the approach of the Confederates. At Franklin, Lt. Col. William McMullen was sure the Rebels would move by way of the Pecos before striking against Fort Stanton and then across San Agustín Pass into the Mesilla Valley, where the Texans would be cheered by what remained of the Secessionists. In the process, the Confederates could “cut off” McMullen at Franklin.81 Colonel West felt that the Confederates would probably place “a small force . . . on the Rio Grande” below Mesilla, where they could obtain supplies from Chihuahua and “induce me to stay and watch them while the main body moved up the Pecos.”82 So that Carleton would have at least thirty days’ warning and a rough idea of the size of the invading force, Wallen recommended stationing small parties of “well mounted and rationed . . . mountain men” on the Llano Estacado, at a point where the 35th Parallel crossed the Red River and at points east of the Pecos River on both overland trails. If the Confederates invaded by way of the Pecos, forces from Forts Marcy, Garland, Stanton, Wingate, Sumner and from the posts at Los Pinos and Albuquerque could be concentrated to defend Fort Union. These forces could easily hold out until reinforcements from Colorado and posts in the southern part of the territory could arrive.83 If the invasion came by way of Franklin, troops from the District of Arizona could be concentrated at Fort Craig or give battle on a plateau overlooking the river near Doña Ana. Wallen also stood by as Carleton worked to patch up a jurisdictional quarrel with the governor of Colorado that had erupted in the closing months of Canby’s administration. Gov. John Evans had complained that recruiters were enlisting men for the New Mexico Volunteers in the southern part of Colorado Territory, despite Canby having issued a desist order. Although Capt. Charles Deus complied with the order, Maj. Adolph H. Mayer continued to enlist men in the San Luis Valley.84 Carleton was hoping he could count on men from Colorado to assist in defending New Mexico, as had been the case in 1862, and he did not want to alienate Evans. He was greatly relieved when Evans assured him he could count on the Colorado Volunteers.85 Carleton also asked General Schofield at St. Louis for help if necessary. In turn, Schofield told Colonel Chivington and his Colorado Volunteers to be prepared to move south at a moment’s notice.86 In preparing for a second invasion, Carleton ordered Colonel West to compile a census of every “able bodied man” on the Rio Grande from\n\nintroduction\n\n• 23\n\nDoña Ana to San Elizario. The names of 1,253 Hispanos would eventually be collected. Of them, Colonel West was certain he could rely on 500 men to take the field. Well aware of the violent uprising of the locals against the Texans, the most “expedient way of employing” the Hispanos, he concluded, was to “turn them loose with privilege to pillage from the enemy and keep whatever they took in the way of animals and arms.”87 Certain the local population would “rally to repel the invader,” West asked for 500 rifles and 50,000 rounds of ammunition from the Fort Union depot.88 Considerable commotion was created in early December 1862 when West issued orders to confiscate grain from the Hispanic population in the Mesilla Valley and the valley below Franklin. Anyone found with more than two months’ subsistence would be considered an enemy of the United States and “treated accordingly.”89 When Hispanos by the hundreds fled into Mexico, taking animals and foodstuffs with them, West issued farreaching orders that any tillable land left fallow would to be turned over to others for cultivation, thus coercing the farmers to return. Such intimidation did cause a few Hispanos to return, yet hundreds remained south of the border until the conclusion of the war.90 Visiting Mesilla, Franklin, and San Elizario in early January 1863, Carleton hoped to calm fears among the local population. In the process, he became convinced that a Confederate invasion was unlikely, so he sent home the few Colorado troops in the territory. Yet Carleton was sure the Rebels would eventually move to secure the Mesilla Valley before pushing into Arizona and southern California, where Southern sentiments were known to be strong.91 By early February 1863, Wallen had joined a board of officers at Mesilla “to select a site for a defensive work . . . capable of holding one thousand men with three months supplies . . . somewhere . . . between Hart’s Mill in Texas and Doña Ana in New Mexico.”92 Other members of the board included West, who had recently been promoted to brigadier general, and First Lt. Allen L. Anderson, engineering officer for the department. The board first rode along the west bank of the Rio Grande near Mesilla and then along the east bank between Las Cruces and Doña Ana. With a small escort, Wallen next explored the west bank of the river between Hart’s Mill and Mesilla, while West and Anderson examined the area between Mesilla and Picacho. West also combed the sandy west bank of the river from Picacho to a point one mile above Doña Ana. Wallen and Anderson then rode along the east bank from Hart’s Mill to Las Cruces and then from\n\n24 •\n\nintroduction\n\nDoña Ana to Robledo. In the entire Mesilla Valley, the board could find no suitable location for an earthworks similar to that at Fort Union. All they could find was a site on the west bank of the river, about 2,000 yards southwest of Mesilla, where a redoubt for 500 men could be built.93 While Wallen was in the Mesilla Valley, General West dispatched Bradford Daily, a well-known El Paso frontiersman, and Washington L. Parvin, a former army captain, along with a small escort, on a secret mission to Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos River to watch for any approach of the enemy. At the crossing, Daily found the two-week-old tracks of about fifty “whites” and the ruts of a wagon leading in the direction of Fort Stockton. After going into camp a mile below the crossing, Daily watched as a party of twenty-five men approached the river, discovered his trail, and began trailing him. Retreating to the Rio Grande, Daily had no doubt the men were a scouting party of Texans likely led by his friend and drinking partner from before the war, the legendary frontiersman-turned-Confederate scout and spy Henry Skillman.94 At Mesilla district headquarters, it was concluded that the men were the advance of a much larger Confederate force. Consequently, West sent “a trusty Mexican” to Presidio del Norte to determine what supplies the Texans were receiving from Chihuahua. Besides keeping a small force at Fort Quitman, Capt. Nathaniel J. Pishon was sent with a company of the First California Cavalry and another of the First California Infantry, along with twenty Hispanos from San Elizario led by Gregorio Garcia. After establishing a depot east of the Hueco Tanks, they were to watch for any Confederate advance and proceed to the Guadalupe Mountains to teach the Mescalero Apaches “a lesson that will be long remembered.95 At the same time, Carleton sent orders from Santa Fe for West to destroy anything that might be of value to the invaders on the Rio Grande below Franklin as well as in the Mesilla Valley before falling back on Fort Craig. “Hover by night around his camps . . . set fire to the grass and all kinds of fodder which his animals might otherwise get . . . shoot down his men by night and then before day scatter in all directions,” Carleton told West. “Baylor and his people will have reason to remember the handful of Californians he may find below the Jornada.”96 If Capt. Edward B. Willis was forced to evacuate Hart’s Mill, West told him to destroy any building that could be of any use to the Rebels at San Elizario, Isleta, Socorro, Concordia Ranch, and Fort Bliss. Captain Willis was even to remove the buhrstones and running gear from Hart’s Mill and destroy any means by which the Confederates could make flour. Nothing was to be left that could\n\nintroduction\n\n• 25\n\nbe used by the enemy.97 Disregarding the needs of local Hispanics, Carleton ordered that even the grain was to be removed. In contrast to Carleton, West wanted to defend the Mesilla Valley vigorously. To abandon the area, he argued, would give the “Confederacy communication with the Pacific.” Moreover, the Federals’ conceding of the Mesilla Valley would only embolden the Rebels and prepare them to move against Fort Craig. With 2,000 men and a battery of artillery, he was sure he could defeat a force twice his size. “It is in no spirit of bravado that I offer to stake my life upon the result,” he told Carleton.98 General West ordered Col. Kit Carson at Fort Stanton to kill or capture the Confederates whom Brad Daily had seen at Horsehead Crossing. Should any sizeable force of Texans be detected, Carson was to send expresses to Santa Fe, Mesilla, and Fort Union. By the time Carson received West’s directive, he had already sent Capt. Francisco Abreu, with part of his New Mexico Volunteers, down the Pecos as far as Delaware Creek.99 In the months to come, other scouts from Fort Stanton pushed as far downriver as Horsehead Crossing. From Fort Stanton, Carson reported that Cadetta, a leading Mescalero chief, had asked that his warriors be allowed to “steal what they can in the way of stock from the Texans.” Considering the rules of war and acting on the recommendations of Capt. James Graydon, Carson was convinced the Mescaleros could be “valuable auxiliaries[,] . . . cripple the enemy,” and put “them on foot.”100 Carson suspended all repairs to Fort Stanton until he could learn “something definite in regard to the threatened invasion.”101 Yet for months in early 1863 no sign of the Texans could be found on the Pecos. Nevertheless still expecting a Rebel advance up the river and wanting ample warning, Carleton established a Fort Stanton–Santa Fe weekly express. Well into 1863, frenzied rumors persisted of Confederates advancing on New Mexico. When unverified information reached Franklin that 1,000 Confederates were already at Horsehead Crossing, Maj. William McMullen reported a near panic at Isleta, Socorro, and San Elizario, from which a large part of the population began moving their families and property across the river to Mexico.102 People at Franklin were also fearful of an attack from sixty noisy Confederate sympathizers who had gathered across the river at El Paso del Norte. Much of what the Federals were hearing emanated from a single individual, the crafty and daring Henry Skillman. Scouting for the Confederates into the Trans-Pecos, Skillman was acting not only as a spy, but as a courier\n\n26 •\n\nintroduction\n\nfor the Confederate refugees in El Paso. As early as November 1862, he was seen in El Paso and a few days later was reported to be below San Elizario with as many as forty men and then at Presidio del Norte.103 To prevent Skillman, a “noted desperado,” from using Mexican soil to communicate with Confederate sympathizers in El Paso and to deter him from spying on Union forces, General West sent Maj. David Fergusson to Ciudad Chihuahua to confer with Gov. Luis Terrazas. Fergusson was in particular to “obtain intelligence of military movements of Texans towards New Mexico and Arizona.”104 Moreover, West asserted, El Paso had become “the rendezvous of a gang of outlaws claiming to be of the party now in rebellion against our government.” According to West, Skillman had “sent secret agents within our lines to watch the movement of our troops and has communicated through Mexican territory, the intelligence so obtained to the enemy.” West was also concerned that the French Imperialistas and the Texas Rebels would form a union on the border and impede Union progress.105 Leaving Mesilla on January 5, 1863, Fergusson paused at El Paso to obtain letters of introduction from David R. Diffenderfer, the American consul, and to inquire into the “status and political sentiments of Ameri­ cans residing in Chihuahua.” After twelve dusty days on the road, he arrived in Chihuahua to find a “neat, clean city of about 13,000 inhabitants.” While waiting to see Governor Terrazas, he met with a handful of loyal Americans. The most important of these was Reuben W. Creel, a Kentucky-born Chihuahua trader who had lived in the city for sixteen years. Fergusson found Creel “a sound, enthusiastic, loyal citizen, unwavering in his devotion to the Union.” German-born merchants Charles Moys and Henry Muller also professed their loyalty to the Union, but such individuals were few.106 Fergusson was so impressed with Creel that he appointed him confidential agent to the U.S. military in New Mexico. Although the Kentuckian had been unfortunate in business and had a large family to support, his services, Creel insisted, would be gratis. Creel immediately addressed letters to the American consuls in Monterrey and Matamoros asking for information on the movement of Confederate forces in Texas. Large numbers of Unionists and army deserters from Texas were said to be arriving daily in both cities.107 In conversation with individuals from Presidio del Norte, Fergusson ascertained that there was no Confederate force of any size west of the Pecos River. Santiago Ramírez, a resident of Presidio del Norte, offered to provide information on the movements of any Confederate force in the\n\nintroduction\n\n• 27\n\narea and even to guide Union forces should they move into the Trans-Pecos. Baylor was said to be in San Antonio with 6,000 men, but orders to invade New Mexico had been countermanded, and he had been sent to defend the Texas coast instead. While in Chihuahua, Fergusson also learned that small groups of Southern sympathizers from southern California were passing through the city on their way to Texas. In fact, the notorious Dan Showalter had ridden through Chihuahua only months earlier. While Fergusson was in Chihuahua, a Texas deserter named James Hoffman arrived from Eagle Pass with valuable information about the Confederate garrisons in the interior of the state, as well as about those on the Texas frontier and along the Rio Grande. Hoffman was carrying an express from San Antonio to the border at Fort Duncan when he fled into Mexico. In Chihuahua, Fergusson also met a Texas slave who had escaped from his master, Dr. Charles Ganahl, the post surgeon at Fort Brown. Desertions in the Confederate army in the lower Rio Grande valley were pandemic, the “negro” said, and there was considerable fear of a Federal invasion. It was agreed that both Hoffman and the “contraband” should accompany the Union major back to Mesilla.108 Fergusson also took stock of supplies that might be available in Chihuahua and Durango should the Federals be given permission to move against Texas from the Pacific Coast through Mexico. But neither state had the resources to sustain such a movement, he reluctantly concluded. After four days in Chihuahua, Fergusson was able to see Governor Terrazas. A seasoned diplomat, the governor already knew from authorities at El Paso and Presidio del Norte that Confederates were using Mexican soil to spy on Union forces in West Texas and New Mexico, and he had given orders to prevent any future violation of Mexican sovereignty. Terrazas even provided Fergusson with copies of orders he had sent to prefects on the border. The prefects had allowed the “American Esquilman” to use Mexican soil because they thought he and his men were “common sojourners” who “were going to California” and who needed arms “solely for self protection against Indians,” Terrazas said.109 The governor promised, Fergusson wrote, to do everything in his power to prevent “passage thru Chihuahua [of] any armed organization having hostile designs against our government.” Terrazas said he looked upon the “cause of the Union as the cause of human progress,” and he was interested in preserving the “friendly relations existing between the two nations.” Moreover, Union forces were more than welcome to purchase supplies in Chihuahua. At the same time,\n\n28 •\n\nintroduction\n\nthe governor expressed interest in suppressing a “gang of Mexican and American desperadoes” led by Edward Hall that was operating out of Fort Leaton on the Texas bank of the Rio Grande near Presidio del Norte and had looted Fort Davis after the Confederate evacuation. Pleased with his visit, Fergusson paused in Ciudad Chihuahua for several days to await the latest news from Texas, finally departing on February 2 and returning north by way of Guadalupe and San Elizario. Ten days after leaving Chihuahua, he was back at Mesilla.110 Despite continued reports of Rebels in the Trans-Pecos, a patrol out of Franklin in May 1863 rode as far east as Fort Stockton, but found no evidence of any Confederates and saw that the San Antonio–El Paso Road was “overgrown with weeds.” At long last, Union authorities were beginning to conclude that Skillman was little more than “a crafty disseminator of reports to perplex us.”111 Yet well into 1864 Union authorities remained concerned the Texans would invade the territory. Conversely, the Confederates were expecting Carleton to strike east across the Trans-Pecos. In San Antonio, plans were under way to resist any such advance at Dead Man’s Pass, just east of the Devil’s River.112 Besides a possible Confederate invasion, a major problem in New Mexico was the army’s inability to pay the Volunteers regularly. Months after the Confederate evacuation, the Volunteers and the New Mexico Militia had not been paid or given a clothing allowance. From Los Pinos in late August 1862, Colonel Carson complained bitterly that although the Regulars had received their pay, many of his men had “not received one single cent,” yet many had “families whom they have to support.” There “[is] much dissatisfaction which may result in injury to the service,” the colonel warned.113 From Lemitar in March 1863, seventy-four men who had served in Graydon’s Spies and Guides appealed to General Carleton for their pay. The money was badly needed, the men wrote, for the “most urgent wants of our families.”114 Another serious problem was a lack of competent physicians. From the time of the Confederate invasion, the army employed itinerant frontier doctors, but the medical director of the department, Dr. Elisha I. Baily, complained that it was “impossible to obtain competent contract physicians to perform the medical duties.”115 The entire army in the territory was “badly off for the want of medical officers,” and the soldiers were not getting the medical attention they deserved, Baily continued. “Those employed are not fit to have charge of sick and wounded, and it is only from the utmost\n\nintroduction\n\n• 29\n\nnecessity that they are employed.”116 The few capable physicians in the territory had left, and the situation, in Baily’s eyes, was critical. “Should the territory be again invaded and the troops take the field, serious consequences would happen to the wounded,” he warned.117 Yet another problem at the isolated military posts in New Mexico, one that both Wallen and Evans had been acutely aware of since they first arrived on the frontier, was the chronic drunkenness of many of the officers and enlisted men. The consumption of intoxicants had always been an issue in the military, but nowhere was alcohol consumed more readily than at isolated frontier outposts. In New Mexico, temperance influences were weak or nonexistent, and it was common for soldiers to supplement their rations with spirits purchased from the post sutler or whiskey peddler. Officers and enlisted men consumed whiskey to cope with the hostile environment and to relieve the sense of isolation and loneliness. For officers on the frontier, drinking whiskey was an expected part of all social intercourse and refusing a drink was a personal insult.118 At several posts, Wallen found officers so addicted to alcohol they were dysfunctional. An officer at Albuquerque was not only addicted to alcohol, but spent all his time at gambling and in the dance halls. One officer at Fort Craig was so drunk he could not drill his men. While Wallen was on inspection of Fort Wingate on July 11, 1863, a Capt. Eben Everett turned up so drunk that Wallen had him arrested. The inspector agreed not to pursue court-martial charges and recommended clemency when Everett pledged “that for one year from this date I will not drink one single drop of any intoxicating liquid, in any manner or shape whatever.” Carleton agreed to accept Wallen’s recommendations, but nevertheless warned, “The service must not be embarrassed by drunken officers.”119 Drunkenness at military posts in the territory became such a problem that the territorial legislature passed a law making it illegal to sell or give spirituous liquors to noncommissioned officers or soldiers. The situation appeared to be particularly bad in the District of Fort Craig. General Carleton specifically told Wallen that when inspecting Fort Craig, he should make every effort to halt the sale of all intoxicating liquors, including beer, at the sutler’s store and several establishments near the post. Carleton promised to “summarily deal” with any violators. Wallen, however, told the commanding officer at Fort Craig, Col. Edwin Rigg, that he had no objections if the alcohol restrictions imposed by Carleton were removed for officers.120\n\n30 •\n\nintroduction\n\nBefore Wallen’s inspection, in November 1862, Capt. Samuel Archer of the Fifth United States Infantry at Fort Craig complained that “liquor sellers” were “gradually establishing themselves within convenient distances of this post for the traf[f]ic of their article.” According to Archer, soldiers were obtaining liquor at either Stapleton’s Ranch, seven miles upriver, or at the village of Paraje de Fray Cristobal, six miles downriver. Learning that a former employee of the quartermaster department, John Doyle, was “engaged in the business” at Stapleton’s Ranch, Archer sent a cavalry force to destroy the liquor. When an army employee was shot in a drunken dispute at Paraje, Archer had much of the whiskey in the community seized.121 So serious was the problem at Paraje that a provost guard had to be stationed in the community. Passes were required for any visit to the small village. Approaching Paraje for an inspection in April 1863, Lt. A. I. Russell, provost marshal at Fort Craig, found a private passed out, “laying [sic] across the road drunk.” Revived, the drunken soldier said he had started out from the small community that morning, but because of the wind he had become disoriented “two or three times, and after walking all the morning,” he had arrived at “where he had started.” Being very tired and sick, he “laid down and went to sleep.”122 Inspecting Paraje, Lieutenant Russell “found whiskey in several Mexican houses.” At the residence of Martin Rogers, the lieutenant found a barrel of alcohol “imbedded in the ground.” This was the “favorite mode of hiding whiskey,” Russell concluded. In another house under a bed, he discovered a plank in the dirt floor under which the “faucet of a barrel peep[ed] out and the barrel [was] barely discernable.” Yet at another house where alcohol was known to be dispensed, he found no inebriants, but recovered several army pistols, evidently exchanged for alcohol. A minimusket, navy revolver, and a cavalry carbine were found in other houses. In fact, army weapons were seized from citizens in the community, including the alcalde (mayor).123 Russell was sure a thorough search of Paraje would turn up even more government property. Many of the Americans in Paraje, Russell concluded, were not only selling whiskey, but “had no legitimate business aside from gambling.” After arresting three American gamblers, one of whom referred to Col. Edwin Rigg as “a d—— old tyrant,” along with several “Mexican vagrants” who had no visible means of support, Russell returned to Fort Craig, certain that “everything is quiet in the town.” Because a “bout with the Texans” was expected, Russell was sure that the gamblers, whiskey peddlers, and\n\nintroduction\n\n• 31\n\nvagrants could better help the government by working on the defenses at Fort Craig even if they had to be fed. But the citizens of Paraje, feeling they were being harassed, sent a petition to Carleton complaining of Rigg’s heavy-handedness. But Rigg paid them little heed and said they were “much like the Dutchman’s wife, ‘a hell of a set.’”124 Chronic inebriation was also a problem at Fort Union, where Loma Parda on the Mora River, six miles over the hill to the south, lured many a wayward soldier. Here a dance hall, bar, and several small rock buildings constructed of sandstone composed a small village where soldiers went to gamble, dance, drink “Loma Lightning,” and carouse. Prostitution was common, and several bordellos thrived. Men not reporting for duty at the fort were often found here in an alcohol-induced stupor. Many were sentenced to three months of hard labor, and a four-foot chain, at the end of which was a twelve-pound iron ball, was attached to their right ankles. As was the case at Paraje, officers worked constantly to keep the soldiers away from Loma Parda, but with little success.125 The many charges of “drunkenness on duty” resulted in countless courts-martial, which consumed much time and effort for those adjudicating the cases.126 Alcohol undoubtedly helped to cause a nasty incident at Fort Marcy in August 1862, when charges were preferred against Capt. Rafael Chacón for striking a drunken private of the Tenth Infantry.127 Many of the saloons in Santa Fe doubled not only as houses of prostitution, but as gambling dens. So acute was the problem in the capital that the provost marshal, Joseph Cummings, issued orders in August 1863 declaring the well-known Santa Fe Exchange a “notorious gambling establishment” and ordered it closed. “Any money exposed on a gambling table in that establishment will be liable to seizure by the Provost Marshal or his assistants,” Cummings proclaimed.128 Another persistent problem in the territory was the deep-rooted and biting racism of many army officers and the Anglo-American economic elite toward the Hispanics. Tensions between the Nuevo Mexicanos and the Anglo-Americans in towns such as Santa Fe, Taos, Albuquerque, Socorro, and Mesilla often bubbled to the surface in riots and violence. The racism fostered mistrust that was acerbated by many officers and regular army men’s inability to speak Spanish and by the Hispanics’ knowing little English. When Carleton first arrived in the territory in December 1853, he wrote that he found little more than “dirty little villages” and “indolence, squalid poverty, filth, and utter ignorance of everything beyond\n\n32 •\n\nintroduction\n\ntheir corn fields and acequias” as well as a “universal proclivity for rags, dirt and filthiness in all things. Sheer laziness and listlessness mark their every movement.”129 Although Carleton moderated his views over time, by 1862 he still saw the Hispanos as largely debased. Another dragoon in the territory, James A. Bennett, saw the citizens of Las Vegas as “dirty and filthy . . . men, women, children of all ages, sizes, and color; all ragged, squalid, poverty-stricken, undressed or half-dressed, bare-booted, and bare-headed.” To Bennett, the people of Taos were “indolent, dirty, [and] immoral.” In Santa Fe, he saw only “ragged men, women, and children, all asking in the most pitiful tones for alms.” Most of the men in the capital were “too lazy to work.”130 Although many of the Hispanos in the New Mexico Volunteers fought bravely at Valverde and continued to serve honorably in the army, they were largely discredited for their efforts and were seen as a scapegoat for the Union defeat. When the Volunteers were reorganized following the Confederate invasion, several competent Nuevo Mexicanos were pushed aside, Canby and Carleton preferring men from the “states” who had been in the antebellum army. Typical of the ethnocentrism in the Department of New Mexico was the situation at Fort Garland, where Capt. Ethan W. Eaton commanded a company of New Mexico Volunteers. Although Eaton thought the Hispanos “behind us in civilization” and “an inferior race,” he complained of the “distrust towards my company on account of their being Mexicans.” Such feelings, he wrote, were “entirely unjust.” His men had not been paid, and they had consistently been given the worst duty and sent to the most isolated military posts, such as Cubero and Fort Garland. “I believe,” he continued, “they are as true to the government as any soldiers in the territory.” Moreover, “the policy generally used towards the Mexican people by Americans [was] wrong and not for the best interest of the county.” The Americans did “nothing but keep them back . . . continually st[i]rring up a feeling of jealousy & animosity between the two people.” Eaton wanted his men “treated properly.” They have “feelings as well as ourselves,” he concluded.131 Major Wallen also became involved in a feud with Padre Damaso Taladrin, chaplain of the First New Mexico Cavalry. Taladrin had accompanied Bishop Jean Baptiste Lamy from Rome to New Mexico in 1854, and the two had become close friends.132 At the beginning of the war, Taladrin was recommended as chaplain of the First New Mexico Cavalry by Lamy, Ceran de St. Vrain, and Carson, and he was appointed by Governor Henry\n\nintroduction\n\n• 33\n\nConnelly in August 1861.133 Carson was favorably inclined toward the Spanish-born Taladrin, saying he was certain to “exert a great influence for the good discipline and instruction of the regiment.”134 Taladrin served honorably at Valverde, and in late 1862 he was sent to Fort Stanton at the beginning of the Mescalero Campaign. A month later the priest wrote gleefully that Colonel Carson had expelled all the prostitutes from the post. However, Lt. Lawrence G. Murphy, whom Taladrin argued was morally corrupt, had presided over a civil ceremony in which Charles Jackson (a quartermaster at the post) was wed to Lucia Padilla (one of the rameras, or prostitutes), whom the priest argued was already married to José Castillo of Valencia County. When Taladrin strongly objected to the marriage, Murphy angrily asserted that he had the authority to perform the ceremony, regardless of what Taladrin thought.135 Other problems for the padre developed when Maj. Joseph Smith, commanding at Fort Stanton, filed charges in May 1863, alleging that Taladrin was not only drinking with the men, but playing monte with them.136 Accusations continued unabated until Bishop Lamy interceded, and the priest pledged to “modify” his behavior. Later in Santa Fe, however, Wallen sought out the priest and asked him to sign a “formal pledge” not to “drink any spirituous liquors or play at cards.” Thinking the matter had been settled, Taladrin was offended and “greatly surprised,” and he flatly refused to sign any such pledge. Admitting he was known to “indulge” in a game of monte, the defiant padre challenged anyone to prove he had ever been “under the influence of liquor.” Professing patriotism, he said he was serving as chaplain only to help the “brave and patriotic defenders of the Union” and the “sacred cause of the Union and the liberty of man oppressed by selfish Sectionists [sic].” Should the territory be invaded again, as was expected, he was ready to “physically and morally assist in the triumph of that idea, which is the emblem of liberty and union, because it [was] the triumph of the right of man over despotism, of civilization over barbarism.”137 But he would not sign any temperance pledge. The historical record does not indicate that Wallen and Carleton pursued the matter, and the confrontation appears to have faded into memory. As acting assistant inspector general, Evans devoted considerable time and effort to investigating the labor and expenses incurred in organizing the New Mexico Militia.138 He was hoping for “the complete military history of every officer and man during his entire term of service.”139 He asked\n\n34 •\n\nintroduction\n\nthat every record in the adjutant general’s office in Santa Fe and district headquarters at Fort Union, Fort Craig, and Albuquerque be searched for every “scrap of paper.” But there were few records, and no one seemed to know how many men had served in the militia, for how long, or whether the men had served honorably, deserted, or died. Canby, Evans learned, had asked for about 200 men in the fall of 1861, but the exact number of men in the initial call for recruits was never ascertained. Governor Connelly had then called for 1,200 men, but Evans could not even determine if the men had been in the cavalry or infantry units. Only one complete record of a field officer, that of Gen. Diego Archuleta, could be found. Using militia laws dating from July 1851 and traditions stretching back into the Mexican era, C. P. Clever, adjutant general for the territory, told Evans that the call for militia had “met with every kind of obstacle, such as the interference of evil disposed persons inciting the citizens to resistance.” It became “absolutely necessary to draft and collect by force the men, together, in small numbers from the respective counties in which they had been ordered to be raised, through the assistance and aid of the civil authorities,” Clever asserted. The militia had been kept in “quarters from the time of their first rendezvousing, until they were mustered into the service.”140 In Bernalillo County, Gen. Francisco Perea, who had lost all of his records during the Confederate invasion, reported that he had used the “same system under which they [soldiers] were raised during the administration of the Mexican Government, that is to say they were raised by force and through the alcaldes and constables.”141 General Archuleta said he had supervised the recruitment of two companies of men in Rio Arriba County and two companies in Taos, as well as one company each in Mora and San Miguel.142 Maj. Gen. José Pablo Gallegos was asked to raise 350 men in the counties of Rio Arriba and Mora. Gallegos said he had personally toured the counties for twenty days to consult with the county captains, to recruit, and to “force” men into service.143 Evans would also devote considerable effort in examining the records of the Volunteers in an attempt to determine which companies had been mustered in and mustered out, that all papers were in proper order, how much pay was due the men, and if they were indebted to the government.144 Evans also reviewed the numerous court-martial records that accumulated at department headquarters, finding serious problems in two instances, one in which the witnesses had never been sworn and the other in which a private had been found guilty although he had not been on duty at the time of his alleged drunkenness.145\n\nintroduction\n\n• 35\n\nIn late 1862 and early 1863, both Wallen and Evans traveled many a dusty mile in southern Colorado, western Texas, and New Mexico inspecting the various posts that dotted the vast landscape. Although some inspectors general in the Union army at the time were barely competent, Carleton was fortunate to have two men who were diligent and dedicated. Wallen and Evans started out, however, with only the vaguest idea of what to do and only a theoretical notion of the duties of an inspector general. In Washington, with the coming of war, the Office of Inspector General virtually ceased to exist, and all that remained to guide the newly appointed inspectors was a set of general regulations issued in 1855 and reissued, essentially unchanged, in 1857.146 The two men were to provide a head count of men present, absent on leave or detached duty, in the guardhouse, or under arrest. At the various posts, the discipline and instruction of the command was to be noted, as was the condition of the arms and equipment. In the case of the Fort Union depot, the inspectors would even provide a detailed inventory. The condition of all buildings was to be noted, as were the medical services available. Both the officers’ abilities or inabilities and the amount of funds for subsistence and quartermaster operations were to be included in the reports. Horses and mules were to be inspected, and any found unfit or neglected were to be so noted. Sutlers had been given a list of items that were to be available for men in the volunteer service, and Wallen and Evans were to indicate if these articles were available at the various posts. The illegal sale of any intoxicants was also to be reported.147 Although Carleton could be uncompromising and fierce in his dealings with fellow officers, he was pleased with the work of both Wallen and Evans. On March 1, 1863, for example, while forwarding several inspection reports to Washington, Carleton went out of his way to praise Wallen. His “patriotism is unsullied,” the general wrote. “He has no thought as a soldier except for the Union. He has made no complaints, but goes on and does his whole duty manfully and without a murmur.”148 While forwarding Wallen’s inspection of Fort Craig, Carleton told Gen. Lorenzo Thomas that Wallen did “his duty in a . . . thorough and satisfactory manner,” that there was “no more ardent patriot than Major Wallen . . . one who has been under the flag and faithful to it for a lifetime.”149 All of Wallen and Evans’s inspection reports were sent to Capt. Benjamin C. Cutler, assistant adjutant general, at department headquarters in Santa Fe. Once the reports arrived in Santa Fe and were reviewed,\n\n36 •\n\nintroduction\n\nWallen and Evans Inspections, 1862–1863.\n\nGeneral Carleton forwarded them to the adjutant general in Washington, D.C.150 These invaluable reports survive in the National Archives and are reprinted here for the first time. They provide a rare and historically significant glimpse into a neglected army in a violent land far from the nation’s capital in one of the most pivotal eras in the nation’s young history.\n\n••• Part I\n\nMaj. Henry Davies Wallen’s Inspection of the Department of New Mexico, 1862–1863\n\n•••\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter one\n\nFort Garland, Colorado •••\n\nEighty-five miles north of Taos and twenty miles east of the Rio Grande, at the base of 14,345-foot Blanca Peak in the towering Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Fort Massachusetts was established by men of the First United States Dragoons in June 1852. The first military post in Colorado, it guarded the small settlements on the Culebra River to the south, the Conejos Valley to the west, and the western approaches to La Veta Pass to the northeast. At an elevation of almost 8,000 feet, the San Luis Valley endured short summers and intensely cold winters, and the post was one of the least desirable in the entire Southwest.1 For defensive purposes, the post was too close to the mountains and in a swampy, unhealthy area. For these reasons, it was relocated in June 1858 to a site near the Trinchera River, six miles to the south, and renamed for Col. John Garland of the Eighth Infantry, commander of the Department of New Mexico at the time. The new post was built of adobe around a parade ground on land that was part of the Sangre de Cristo Grant and leased by the government. Although the post was transferred from the Department of New Mexico to the Department of Kansas in September 1862, General Carleton sent Major Wallen north to inspect it. Leaving Santa Fe with a small escort and several days’ rations, Wallen headed north up the Rio Grande and then over the rough, twisting mountainous road to Taos, where he continued north along the Rio Grande into the broad and largely barren San Luis Valley. At Fort • 39 •\n\n40 •\n\nchapter one\n\nGarland, Wallen found two companies of the First New Mexico Volunteers and a company of the Second Colorado Volunteers. Here on the eastern fringes of the valley, Wallen reported the soldiers comfortably clad and adequately provided for, but cleanliness at the post was lacking. The post was still not defensible, and the soldiers were poor marksmen. Five months after Wallen left Fort Garland, the New Mexico Volunteers at the post were ordered south and replaced by a company of the First Colorado Cavalry.2 With the removal of the Tabegauche and White River Utes to the Unitah Reservation in Utah in 1881, the number of troops at Fort Garland was reduced, and the post was abandoned in 1883.\n\n••••••••••• Head Quarters, Santa Fe, N.M.\n\nOctober 30th 1862 Captain: I have the honor to make the following report of my inspection of the garrison at Fort Garland agreeably with written instructions and Special Order[s] No. 180 from Head Quarters, Department of New Mexico.3 Fort Garland is a little east of north from Santa Fe and distant one hundred and sixty nine miles. The post is commanded by Major A[dolph] H. Mayer, 1st Regt., N. M. Vols. and garrisoned by Captain [Ethan W.] Eaton’s Company, 1st N. M. Vols., three officers and ninety two enlisted men, Captain [Charles] Deus’ Company, 1st N. M. Vols., three officers and forty nine enlisted men and Captain [Joseph C. W.] Hall’s Company, 2nd Colorado Vols., three officers and fifty eight enlisted men.4 Total, ten officers and one hundred and ninety nine men. Major [Edward Wanshear] Wynkoop with a battalion of the 1st Colorado Volunteers, Companies H and K, were temporarily at the post in route for Denver City.5 At 10 o’clock on the morning of the 19th the command was paraded, reviewed, and carefully inspected. I found their arms in good serviceable order and their accouterments, with few exceptions, in the same condition. Where deficiencies existed I caused requisitions to be made and forwarded to the General Commanding for approval. Captain Eaton’s Company is composed almost entirely of New Mexicans—presents quite a military appearance, is neatly and comfortably clad in uniforms and I am favorably impressed with its discipline.6 I had the company drilled by the Captain in the company and skirmish drills,\n\nFort Garland, Colorado\n\n• 41\n\nfound it tolerably proficient in the forms but very deficient in the latter. At the target practice, I found the company sadly deficient. Thirteen shots were placed in the largest at one hundred yards, none at two hundred and only one at three hundred yards. The want of skill is attributable in a measure to there being no books on target practice at the post and the lack of ammunition. There being no blank cartridges on hand, I had no opportunity of testing the company at the different firings. The fund account of this company up to the date amounts to $398.24 accounts rendered our balance on hand. The proper clothing book for the company has just been received and the accounts are being transcribed from the old book where the clothing issued seems all to have been charged. This is the first payment the company has received and the first time the men’s clothing accounts have been settled. I can discover no inaccuracies in the settlement of their accounts. The returns of ordnance and of clothing and camp and garrison equipage have been rendered up to the end of September, present year. 2nd Lieut. Nicolas Hodt of this company was absent on detached service at Santa Fe with public horses.7 The recruits recently enlisted by Captain Deus constituting a part of Company M, 1st N. M. Vols., are a large fine looking body of men and have advanced to the company drill. Arms are about to be issued to them and in a short time this company will compare favorably with any in the regiment. I respectfully recommend that Captain Deus be permitted to return to the mountains to continue recruiting until his company is filled to the maximum. There is no fund or books in this company as the recruits have just arrived at the post. I have directed the captain to make his requisitions for the necessary books and to commence accumulating a company fund. These men are newly and comfortably clad, appear happy and contented, and seem to be well cared for by their officers—1st Lieut. [Benjamin] Stevens of this company has never joined it since his appointment.8 Company H, 2nd Colorado Volunteers, was temporarily under the command of 2d Lieut. James Parsons.9 Captain Hall being on the recruiting service at Central City, C. T., & the 1st Lieut., G[uy] C. Manville, on detached service at Santa Fe with public horses.10 This company is comfortably clad in uniforms and are [sic] active and healthy in appearance. It was drilled by Lieut. Parson at company and skirmish drills, but was very deficient in both. At target practice sixteen shots were put in the target (regulations size 21 inches) at one hundred yards but only two on increasing the distance to three hundred. I was unable to test\n\n42 •\n\nchapter one\n\nthe company in the different firings for the want of blank cartridges. This company is deficient an order book and the books are not brought up to date, the company fund accounts have been rendered to date and the balance on hand up to August 31st is $20. Amount accumulated since, $30. All instructions have been given in regard to the company books, fund account, etc., etc. The principal cause for the want of proficiency of drill & target practice is the lack of blanks, the infrequency of drills, and the utter want of knowledge on all these subjects by the commander of the post volunteers. Officers will not as a general rule take an interest in the military instruction and discipline of their companies if the commander is indifferent or possesses no tactical knowledge. A letter of instruction to the commander of Fort Garland is appended to this report which I hope will meet with the approval of the Commanding General. The records of the Commanding Officer’s office, with the exception of the guard reports, are correctly kept by the Post Adjutant, 1st Lieut. John Lewis, an old soldier who has served several enlistments in the 5th Infantry.11 This officer superintends the company drills and exercises the command at the drill of the battalion. The commanding officer, Major Mayer, having been but a few months in service, has not yet acquired a knowledge of the drills. I have directed the major to apply himself closely to the tactics and to get Lieut. Lewis to explain all the different parts and to go to the drill ground and see how the different movements are executed, and to commence himself with the battalion as soon as possible. I saw nothing objectionable in the habits of any of the officers. They all appeared sober but wanting in energy & industry. The battalion under Major Wynkoop, 1st Colorado Volunteers, was in fair marching order, but as they were about to leave the department, I did not deem it necessary to give them more than a casual inspection. Like the balance of the regiment, these companies are indifferent to the personal appearance of the soldiers, the laxity of discipline arises from the familiarity existing between the officers and enlisted men. In this regiment there never can be a change for the better so long as there is this utter absence of all respect from the men to their officers and from the little proficiency the officers have made in acquiring a knowledge of their duties. The quarters at the post are substantially built of adobes, with good roofs, doors, window sash and blinds and according to the diagram on the following pages.\n\nFort Garland, Colorado\n\nFort Garland.

The Commanding Officers’ quarters are to the right of the center as you face the parade and all the rooms of the officers quarters are of the regulation size. The men’s quarters are on the east and west sides of the parade, are sufficiently capacious for two full companies, but badly arranged by being cut up into five small rooms, the fifth being used as an orderly & company store room. These rooms all have dirt floors and are badly ventilated. I have requested the Commanding Officer to make slight alterations in the quarters (not involving expense) to have the walls repaired, cleansed & whitened and to have the necessary bunks, benches & tables made to accommodate the companies & make them comfortable. The company mess rooms are badly arranged at present, but on the departure of the Colorado companies, the permanent garrison will be amply accommodated. The guard house is sufficiently commodious for the post but requires some little repair, all of which have been suggested. There are but few prisoners in confinement a"
