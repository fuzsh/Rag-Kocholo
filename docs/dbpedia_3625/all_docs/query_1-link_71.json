        "text": "KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on July 8 said he has brought home from Turkey five commanders taken prisoner by Russia during the brutal struggle in the city of Mariupol early in the war that culminated with a long, bloody holdout at the Azovstal steel plant.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe Kremlin angrily responded to Zelenskiy’s action, saying they were not informed of the commanders’ release and claiming the move violated an agreement with Ankara that they were to remain in Turkey until the end of the war.\n\nIn September 2022, Ukraine announced the release of 215 of its soldiers in exchange for dozens of Russian prisoners and a pro-Moscow politician.\n\nAs part of the deal and in cooperation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Ukrainian president said the five commanders would remain in Turkey \"in total security and in comfortable conditions\" until the end of the war.\n\nUpon his return to Kyiv with the men, Zelenskiy did not immediately explain why they were allowed to leave Turkey at this time.\n\n“We are returning home from Turkiye and bringing our heroes home,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.\n\n“Ukrainian soldiers Denys Prokopenko, Svyatoslav Palamar, Serhiy Volynsky, Oleh Khomenko, Denys Shleha. They will finally be with their relatives. Glory to Ukraine!”\n\nMariupol city and its Azovstal steel plant were the scene of a long siege that ended in May 2022 and left Mariupol in ruins before 2,500 Ukrainian defenders finally surrendered.\n\nFollowing Zelenskiy's announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying the return of the commanders was \"nothing more than a direct violation of the terms of the existing agreements\" by the Ukrainian and Turkish governments.\n\nPeskov said under the terms of the prisoner swap, the commanders were to remain in Turkey until the end of the conflict. He added that Moscow had not been told of their release.\n\nTurkish leaders did not immediately comment.\n\nSeparately, in his final hours in Turkey, Zelenskiy met with the Istanbul-based spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians and discussed the implementation of Ukraine’s formula for peace and the return of children deported by Russia, Ukraine’s presidential office said.\n\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has openly criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Following the invasion, Bartholomew said Russia's Orthodox Church shared responsibility with the Kremlin for the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n\"The Ecumenical Patriarchate, as the Mother Church of all Orthodox in Ukraine, is always on their side,\" Bartholomew told Zelenskiy.\n\n\"I want to wish that all captives and all children who are now far from their homes return,\" he added.\n\nOn July 7, Zelenskiy met with Erdogan, who told him that Ukraine deserved to join NATO but also urged it to enter peace talks with Moscow.\n\n\"There is no doubt that Ukraine deserves membership of NATO,\" Erdogan told a joint news conference in Istanbul. But he added that \"both sides should go back to peace talks.\"\n\nHe also said Russian President Vladimir Putin next month will pay his first visit to Turkey since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine 500 days ago. He will discuss prisoner swaps with the Russian ruler, he said.\n\nIran on August 13 rejected Western calls to renounce its threat to retaliate against Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nHaniyeh was killed along with his personal bodyguard in Tehran on July 31 as he visited the Iranian capital for the swearing-in of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIsrael hasn't confirmed or denied carrying out the attack.\n\nIran, Hamas's main backer, blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement that \"such a request lacks political logic, flies in the face of the principles and rules of international law, and constitutes public and practical support\" for Israel.\n\nHis statement came after the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy called on Iran on August 12 to \"stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also held phone calls with Pezeshkian the same day.\n\nStarmer asked Pezeshkian to refrain from attacking Israel and said that war was not in anyone's interest, his office said. Starmer told Pezeshkian he was deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East and called on all parties to de-escalate to avoid further regional confrontation.\n\n\"There was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration,\" Starmer was quoted as saying, adding that he had underlined his commitment to an immediate cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the call with Starmer, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that war anywhere in the world was in no one's interest but that states had the right to \"punitive responses against an aggressor.\"\n\nScholz also called on Pezeshkian to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East. \"The spiral of violence in the Middle East must now be broken,\" Scholz told Pezeshkian, according to a German government statement.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agreed with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could \"attack Israel as early as this week.\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation.\n\nWestern diplomats have scrambled to avert a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions were already high due to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and dpa\n\nNearly the entire civilian population of the Krasnoyaruzh district of Russia's Belgorod region has been evacuated, the region's governor said, as Ukrainian forces continued to make headway in the neighboring Kursk region while Kyiv said its aim wasn't to acquire territory in Russia.\n\n\"More than 11,000 people have left,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram early on August 13. \"At present, about 1,000 people are in temporary housing.\"\n\nThe district's prewar population was about 14,000 people.\n\nThe governor announced the evacuation of the district on August 12 and closed off access to the area. The district head, Andrei Miskov, said the 500 people remaining in the area were mostly officials, emergency workers, and key specialists.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe Krasnoyaruzh district borders Ukraine to the west and the Kursk region's embattled Belov district to north.\n\nUkrainian forces posted a video on August 12 that has been geolocated to the center of the Kursk region town of Sudzha. The exact date of the video is unclear, but Ukrainian soldiers can be heard saying that they had not yet encountered any Russian forces.\n\nRussian military vloggers have reported that Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the border with a prewar population of more than 5,000 people, was under Ukrainian control.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said that 12 Ukrainian drones had been \"destroyed\" overnight over the Kursk region and one each over the Belgorod and Voronezh regions.\n\nAcross the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, the Russian military carried out overnight strikes that damaged civilian energy infrastructure and several private cars, the region's military administration reported.\n\nOne civilian was reportedly wounded.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff announced restrictions on the movement of civilians in the Sumy region within 20 kilometers of the border with Russia, citing the \"increasing intensity of hostilities.\"\n\nIn a statement on August 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow had used the border region to launch some 2,100 attacks on Ukraine's Sumy region since July 1.\n\nUkrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region on August 6 and have occupied about 1,000 square kilometers and numerous population centers.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy said on August 13 that \"Ukraine is not interested in taking over the territory of the Kursk region.\"\n\n\"These Ukrainian actions are absolutely legitimate,\" he added.\n\nActing Kursk region Governor Aleksei Smirnov reported to President Vladimir Putin on August 12 that 28 settlements were \"under enemy control.\"\n\n\"The depth of the penetration into the territory of the Kursk region is 12 kilometers, the width of the front is 40 kilometers,\" he said.\n\nRepeating a Russian government talking point and without providing evidence, Russian Major General Apty Alaudinov, who is commander of the Akhmat special forces unit, said on Russian state TV that \"the headquarters of the NATO bloc certainly took part in the development of the operation.\"\n\nIt is not possible to verify battlefield claims, although some reports have suggested deeper incursions by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agrees with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could “attack Israel as early as this week” and it urged Tehran to “stand down” with regard its ongoing threats.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation and said Washington takes seriously reports that Iran could soon attack Israel in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIran blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\n“We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks, which is why, again, we have increased our force posture capabilities in the region even in just the last few days,” Kirby said.\n\n“We've got significant force capabilities in the region. We've changed some of that posture in just the last few days. The president is confident that we have the capability available to us to help defend Israel,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Pentagon has bolstered its forces in the Middle East amid the mounting tensions as Washington reiterated its support for long-standing ally Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement later with Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the White House said: “We expressed our support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n“We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place,” the statement added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian in separate phone calls to avoid escalation of military tensions in the region, their offices said. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.\n\nFollowing the call with Scholz, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that, \"while Iran welcomes the expansion of interactions with all countries and stresses the need for resolving problems through negotiations, it will not give in to pressure, sanctions, bullying, and aggression.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he added, \"it considers it a right to respond to aggressors based on international rules.\"\n\nThe Western allies' joint statement also said they “expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\"\n\nIt said the group endorsed the joint call by Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Amir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar “to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.”\n\n“All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition, unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed,” it said.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas extremists surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nThe Taliban has created \"the world's most serious women's rights crisis\" since returning to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says.\n\nUnder the Taliban rule, Afghanistan has become the only country where girls are banned from going to school beyond the sixth grade, HRW said in a press release on August 11.\n\nThe Taliban has also \"undermined women's right to freedom of movement, banned them from many forms of employment, dismantled protections for women and girls experiencing gender-based violence, created barriers to them accessing health care, and barred them from playing sports, and even visiting parks.\"\n\nThe pressures on Afghan women come as their country is also experiencing a major humanitarian crisis, with aid severely underfunded and thousands of Afghan refugees forced back into Afghanistan from Pakistan.\n\nWomen and girls are among the most seriously affected by this humanitarian crisis, HRW said.\n\nThe situation has been described by the United Nations special rapporteur on Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, as \"an institutionalized system of discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity, and exclusion of women and girls,\" HRW said.\n\n\"Under the Taliban's abusive rule, Afghan women and girls are living their worst nightmares,\" HRW's Fereshta Abbasi said.\n\nAbbasi urged all governments to \"support efforts to hold the Taliban leadership and all those responsible for serious crimes in Afghanistan to account.\"\n\nAbbasi said countries engaging with the Taliban-led government in Kabul should consistently remind it that its \"abuses against women and girls and all Afghans violate Afghanistan's obligations under international law.\"\n\nMore than half of Afghanistan's population -- 23 million people -- face food insecurity, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nRestrictions that the Taliban authorities have imposed on women and girls have impeded access to health care, jeopardizing their right to health, HRW noted.\n\nThe Taliban's bans on girls' education inevitably leads to future shortages of female health workers, HRW said.\n\nThe rights group called on donor countries to find ways to mitigate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan without reinforcing the Taliban's repressive policies against women and girls."
