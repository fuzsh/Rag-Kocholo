Popularly known as Pillayarpatti Temple, Arulmigu Karpaga Vinayagar temple is one of the oldest cave temples in Tamil Nadu, India. The presiding deity, Desi Vinayaka Pillaiyar or Karpaka Vinayakar, is a 6 foot tall bas-relief carved out of an excavated cave. Lord Ganesh is seen with two arms and a trunk curled towards his right side (Valampuri Vinayagar).\n\nKarpaka Vinayagar Temple Pillayarpatti Tamilnadu | Hindu Devotional Blog\n\nThe Rock Fort Temple, or Ucchi Pillayar Koil, is a combination of two famous 7th century Hindu temples, one dedicated to Lord Ganesh and the other dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located on top, and carved into, a huge rock in Trichy.\n\nTrichy?s famous \"Rock Fort\" Temple ? Tamil Nadu, India | Living in the Embrace of Arunachala\n\n[video=youtube;d_aXfsYFYb0]http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=d_aXfsYFYb0[/video]\n\nGanesha emerged as a distinct deity in the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta Period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. He was formally included among the five primary deities of Smartism (a Hindu denomination) in the 9th century. A sect of devotees called the Ganapatya arose, who identified Ganesha as the supreme deity. The principal scriptures dedicated to Ganesha are the Ganesha Purana, theMudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa.\n\nStories about Ganesha often occur in the Puranic corpus. Brown notes while the Puranas \"defy precise chronological ordering\", the more detailed narratives of Ganesha's life are in the late texts, c. 600–1300. Yuvraj Krishan says that the Puranic myths about the birth of Ganesha and how he acquired an elephant's head are in the later Puranas, which were composed from c. 600 onwards. He elaborates on the matter to say that references to Ganesha in the earlier Puranas, such as the Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas, are later interpolations made during the 7th to 10th centuries.\n\nIn his survey of Ganesha's rise to prominence in Sanskrit literature, Ludo Rocher notes that:\n\nAbove all, one cannot help being struck by the fact that the numerous stories surrounding Gaṇeśa concentrate on an unexpectedly limited number of incidents. These incidents are mainly three: his birth and parenthood, his elephant head, and his single tusk. Other incidents are touched on in the texts, but to a far lesser extent.\n\nGanesha's rise to prominence was codified in the 9th century, when he was formally included as one of the five primary deities of Smartism. The 9th century philosopher Śaṅkarācārya popularized the \"worship of the five forms\" (pañcāyatana pūjā) system among orthodox Brahmins of the Smarta tradition. This worship practice invokes the five deities Ganesha, Vishnu, Shiva, Devī, and Sūrya. Śaṅkarācārya instituted the tradition primarily to unite the principal deities of these five major sects on an equal status. This formalized the role of Ganesha as a complementary deity.\n\n.........\n\nAccording to Ellawala, the elephant-headed Ganesha as lord of the Ganas was known to the people of Sri Lanka in the early pre-Christian era.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh\n\nlol, you are casting me in the same mold as yours -- however, let me remind you, am not a brahman believer in imaginative tales of puranas, itihasas and such like.\n\nOf course you are a fanciful story teller.

Have a good time. lol\n\nOf course you are a fanciful story teller. My post nails your lie. The post is silly and the silly smiliey makes it sillier.\n\nNarayan, I don't understand the point of such vitriol. It appears your objection is to the statement, \"Incidentally, the story of Ganesha's birth from dirt off Parvati's skin is also found in Aitareya Brahmana (the only 'vedic' text recounting the story). \" Your response is that there is another vedic reference to vinayaka, \"including the usual set of adjectives like eadanta, vakra tunda, lambodhara etc. supposedly predate all the fanciful theories of dirt or turmeric. \"\n\nIs this is the basis on which you say Palindrome lies, her ideas are fanciful, she uses silly looking smilies, she makes up chandamama stories?\n\nIf you look at what she said in the first place it appears what you are saying does not contradict her at all. She says the \"dirt\" story is found only in Aitrayea Brahmana, and you are saying artharva-sheershopanishat has hymns praising Vinayaka but does not refer to \"dirt\" story. So, unless I am completely mistaken, if so let me know, you are not contradicting her at all, yet you have jumped off the handle calling her unnecessarily nasty names.\n\nWhat is the matter with you guys? Do you have to be so downright obnoxious if you don't agree with something? Stop with this nonsense. Have your say, but enough with this detestable calumny....\n\nOf course you are a fanciful story teller. My post nails your lie. The post is silly and the silly smiliey makes it sillier.\n\nYou have severe comprehension problems, dont you? You tom-tommed the various puranas and buddhist literature.

What else to expect from your likes? Btw its not just me smiling or grinning.\n\nAll these accusations, insults, wild vitriolic probably indicate you have no idea about the atharva shiras upanishad. Also proves you have no access to the details of atharva shiras concept / imagery / mantra tradition / conceptualization of brahman and vinayaka as brihaspati, and so on. Let me tell you jstor may help but you do not like western scholars so well, leave it aside.\n\nBut then you accuse and claim that i am contradicting you. Anyways, since you need to prove (1) the atharva shirashopanishad is 'vedic' and predates all other narratives of ganesha's origin, (2) that atharva is just like the trayee-vedic and hence 'vedic' tradition according to you -- why not you present your evidence?? maybe going to a ganapatya priest near your home may help, i suspect the average priest may know much better than you do.\n\nAfter you present your evidence, let the readership decide what are chandamama stories.....as for dates of puranas, starting from early puranas, look up my old posts, or read some books (all pretty well documented by various historians including indians like kane -- but all that may unfortunately make the indignant religious uncomfortable)...in any case, making yourself silly does not help in any manner...\n\nகால பைரவன்;206051 said:\n\nAccording to Kshatriya kula veera vanniyars, they are the first to bring Ganapathy to Tamil Nadu after they helped Pallavas defeat Chalukyas. According to them, there was no Ganapathy worship in TN before the defeat of Chalukya king Pulikesi in Baadhaami and it is those veera vanniyars who brought Ganapthy from baadhaami to TN and named it Vaathaapi Ganapathy. Is this true account? Was there no Ganapthy worship in TN before 6th or 7th century?\n\nI wud not want to go into claims made by present day communities (or on their self-entitlements). A similar claim is made by some vellalar families i know of -- they claim they are ganapatyas and that the god belongs to them. Have also heard of nagarathars making the same claim. So well...\n\nAnyways, coming to the origin of present-day Ganesha, it appears the story of fixing elephant head predates the reign of hala (according to the book shankara and shanmata of the edition mentioned in my previous post in this thread). Hala was a Satavahana king who ruled between 19 to 24 AD in a region of present day Andhra. Incidentally his wife was from Ceylon..\n\nWe have so many times heard the mantra gananaAm tva ganapatim havamahe....\n\nAppears there are various versions of this deity. However, there is very little research if they all refer to the same person or to different characters.\n\nWhile the word ganapati occurs in rigveda, the meaning is literal as the \"head of ganas\" (gana supposedly means wise people). Apparently the word referred to the head of angirasas. According to Y Krishan, the word refers to brahmanaspati not to the classical ganesha.\n\nVarious puranas give various accounts of ganesha's origin. The story of elephant head and from dirt off shakti's skin is not there in the veda samhitas afaik (at least from what have read so far...only the maitrayani samhita of yajur explicitly uses the word \"hastimukhaya vidmahe...\" to indicate an elephant head - it is the fourth of 11 gayatris and am yet to know when it was written). We had earlier discussed keith's dating of krishna yajur but not sure that helps...\n\nAnyways, since the elephant head story is puranic and since the indo-aryan bhils worship the ganesha form minus the elephant head; the elephant head version is supposed to have an indian geographical origin. Various samhitas of the yajur, as such, were composed in various geographical origins with the maitreyani samhita having an origin to the south of kurukshetra. So the origin is pretty native.\n\nYou may like the book \"Ganesa: unravelling an enigma\" by Y Krishan. Remember we had discussed Y Krishan's paper on buddhism? Back then i downloaded all papers by Yuvraj Krishan that i could find on jstor. There was one interesting paper called \"is ganesa a vedic god?\".\n\nIn that paper, Y Krishan presents a lot of evidence from various scriptures. He tries to make a distinction between various deities but seems lost after the initial explanations. The author fails to present sufficient clarity between the puranic version and the other versions, though he does make a distinction between the classical ganesha and all other ganapatis (the term ganapati being literal and used merely as a title for various deities such as indra. Also, the term ganesha is literal, meaning god of the ganas. Both the words in the vedic corpus, it seems, do not refer to the elephant-head deity).\n\nY Krishan concludes in that paper saying the set of 11 ganesha gayatris (including the \"hastimukhaya vidmahe...\" mantra) is a later-day interpolation into the yajur. He ends the paper saying Ganesha (the elephant-head god) is a non-vedic deity. The book \"ganesha: unravelling an enigma\" has a lot of info. Apparently, Ganesha of the form we know was a yaksha deity....\n\nSo far appears to me, the elephant head god was the version of certain folks who eventually got absorbed into the yajur vedic fold (if they did not get absorbed into the fold, how cud they make an interpolation?). In the atharva shirsa Ganapati is a tantric deity visualized as brihaspati. Need to find proof if the atharva deity is the same as the yajur one. If you have clues or know of any paper on this, please let me know. Have not checked but according to this the atharva text seems to be a recent one - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapati_Atharvashirsa\n\nDear Palindrome,\n\nI have noted that some members feel you write Chandamama material.\n\nI would like members to know that never underestimate Chandamama material.\n\nDuring my MBBS surgery exam finals I was the only Candidate for the day who knew what NYLON stands for when I was asked during Viva Voce what is the meaning of NYLON suture material.\n\nI answered NYLON stands for New York(NY) and London(Lon) where it was invented at the same time...hence the name NYLON.\n\nThe examiner was very happy with my answer and he said \"you are the only Candidate who knew this answer..from which Surgical book did you get this info from?\"\n\nI answered \"I read it in Chandamama Sir\"\n\nThe examiner started laughing!\n\nSo far Zebra is the only person to comment it is Chandamama material. Let him think, who cares. I know there is a better readership out there interested in stuff that nara sir, sangom sir and myself write.\n\nUnfortunately i came across the wiki article on ganapati atharvashirsha late yesterday evening (did not know wiki had an artice on it) or wud have posted it for zebra much earlier itself. Perhaps then we cud have spared ourselves from the snowballing effect.\n\nAll my childhood when mom made ganesha out of turmeric paste, she wud emphasize on the antiseptic properties of turmeric and correlate the story to cleansing effect and dirt off parvati's skin. I believed her completely until a few years back when i started understanding what religion is about. Never expected traditional ladies like rajiram did not know the story...never expected this level of protestations from different posters either. Anyways..."
