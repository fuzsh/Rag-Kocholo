        "text": "Citation preview\n\n(Temple Worship) Aalayam or Kovil is the place where God is graciously present. In the word Aalayam, “Aa” stands for Atma (soul) and 1ayam” stands for the place of linkage. In the word `Kovil', “Ko”denotes God and “il” denotes Residence. Thus the place where the soul attains the lotus feet of the Lord is the temple. In the word Aalayam, “Aa”also refers to thc fctter Aanava and “layam” stands for subsicling. Hence, it can be understood that “Aalayam” is the place where the Aanavamalam subsides. Love and knowledge are essential aspects of life. Life is incomplete wi thout these characteristics that originate from within God. The Rajagopuram, the entrance of the temple, is found at great heights and is known as the “Thulalingam”. It acts as zt reminder of God to the people at distant places, and sins of the ulnﬂu tradition:\n\npeople worshipping this would diminish. The Siva Ganas (Siva forces) surround us the moment we enter through the gopuram, and hence we have to follow certain “Niyamas` (rules and regulations) while worshipping in a temple. Lord Siva can grow angry very quickly as well be pleased easily. Hence we should not involve ourselves in any prohibited activities, but Worship with purity in body and mind. As per the Agarnas, the Dvajalingam / Kodimaram (flag pole) is the second amongst the Panchalingams. The Balipeedam and Nandhi are sanctifíed next to it. Balipeedam is the place where pooj as are done for the Parivara Devas (retinue of the Supreme God). We should not prostrate at any other places except before the Kodimaram. Here we prostrate to sacrifice our fetters and then meditate on the Lord. Men perform the “Ashtanga Namaskaram°, whereas women perform the “Panchanga Nam askaram°. People going to the temple for Worship should take a coconut, fruits, betel leavcs and areca nuts. The act of breaking a coconut into two halves in the Sannidhi symbolizes the action of getting rid of Maya. and being cnlightened by the Supreme. The fruits denote our prayers, while the betcl leaves denotc the grace of Goddess Lakshrni. When we touch the Aarathi with both our hands and then place them on our eyes, we think of God. receive His darshan, attain the feeling of having worshipped him, and thus become\n\ndevoted towards him. 2 Nlmlu rranmons Aalaya Vazhipadu Questions and Answers * Whether the Almighty can be worshipped only by going to the temple? The milk in the cow is present throughout its body, but only the udder provides the milk. The water is available beneath the ground, but to receive it we have to dig Wells. The heat of the Sun will not burn a cloth unless the rays are passed through a prism.~Why? This is because the prism converges the rays to a focal point. Hence, worshipping at other places is like a dhoti placed in sunlight, whereas temple Worship is like a dhoti placed in sunlight under a prismc Like-wise, the Saints such as Nalvar, Alwar, Arunagirinaathar, Srimath Pamban Swamigal and other Vedic scholars attract the grace of God through Mantras and Yantras. Therefore worshipping in temples will burn our sins, and thus prevent rebirths. Hence, going to the temple is mandatory not only for the ordinary men, but also for saints too. * How to enter the temple? Aalayam is the place whcre the soul attains the lotus feet of the Lord. Besides, “Aa” denotes the Aanavamalam and “layam” refers to subsiding. Hence, Aalayam is the place where the Aanavamalam subsides. There are certain regulations for worshipping in a temple. It insists on purity of the mind and the body. Cleanliness of the body is attaincd through water, whilc purity of the mind is attained through rightcous conduct.'The Manam (mind), Vaakku (speech) and Kayam (body) have to be Nlnﬂtl Tridlllﬁns\n\n4 pure while going to the temple. Hence, worshipping at the temple without cleanliness and righteousness is like consuming medicine without observing diet restrictions. We have to either chant “Siva Siva' or recite the Thevarams and Thiruvasakams to attain purity of the mind. While going to the temple and returning, we should meditate on the Lord and should not utter any unwanted words. * Why there is an Adhikara Nandhi in the temple? Though we wish to open a jewel box, it cannot be opened without the key. Like-wise, when worship the Adhikara Nandhi, as he going to the temple, it is necessary to\n\nis the key to Lord siva. The Adhikafa Nandhi is the first Guru of our Hindu religion. The word Nandhi means ^happiness”, and it is a symbol of Dharma (righteousness). * What is the Philosophy of the Kodimaram (Flag pole) situated near the Nandhi? The Kodimaram is just like the spinal cord. There are 31 segments in our spinal cord, like-wise there are 31 scgments in a kodimaram. The priest hoists the white cloth on the kodimarani with the rope cntwined with dharpai, and while doing this he recitcs the ,tl Vedhic rnantras. The kodimaram is a symbol of Lord Siva, the rope is His grace, the cloth is our soul, and the dharpai denotes our fetters (Aanava, Kanma and Maya). Hence, hoisting the cloth and dharpai on the kodimaram symbolises the upliftment of our soul. * Explain the significance of the Balipeedam? The Balipeedam is also known as Badralingam. Next to this lies the mount of the main deity of the temple (ie. Nandhi in Siva temples). The mount represents the soul. The fetters found in the soul recedes behind the balipeedam. Hence, we have to sacrifice our Aanava, Kanma and Maya at the balipeedam, and then Worship the deities. * How to worship near the Kodimaram? The women worship by performing the “Panchanga N amaskaram” , and the men worship by performing the “Ashtanga Namaskaram'. We have to face either east or north while prostrating. lf the Sanctum Sanctorum is faeing north or west, we prostrate on the left sideof the kodimaram, and if it is facing south or east we prostrate on the right side. We can prostrate 3, 5, 7, 9, or l2 times except during the time of Abishekams and N aivedhyams (offering food). We should not prostrate once or twice. * Give details of the Namaskarams? The Ashtanga Namaskaram is the Way of prostration in which theforehead, ears (2), chest, hands (2) and legs (2) touch the floor. Nlnuu Yraumans\n\nThe Panchanga Namaskaram is the way of prostration in which the forehead, hands (2) and knees (2) touch the floor.\n\nSashtanga Namaskaram means prostrating with the whole body touching the ﬂoor. * ln temples why is primary importance given to Ganapathy Worship? Omkaram is the source of everything. The world originates from and ends in Omkaram. Ganapathy is the form of Omkaram.Hence, it is customary to Worship the Pranavakara Gan ap athy first, when you enter the temple. * What is the philosophy behind offering the coconut? The offering of coconut is to get rid of the three Malas (fetters). The husk of the coconut symbolizes Maya, the fibre we peel refers to Kanma, and the shell denotes Aanava. The white kernel inside reveals the divinity. Thus the philosophy of offering coconut is to get rid of the three Malas and attain Mukthi (Liberation). * Why we have to sing the Pancha Puranam? There are ll mantras in Saivism namely; Easanam, Thatpuradam, Agoram, Vamadevam, Szithyajotham, lrudhyam, Sirasu, Sikai, Kavasam, Nettiram and Astiram. Nambiandar Nambi compiled ll Thirumurais for those 11 mantras. A century after he passed away. Saint Sekhizhar composed the Periya Purunam (Si va Mantra and Punchatchara Muntra), which later bec time the 12\"' Thirumurai. 6 rnuau musicians As we cannot recite everything at once, our ancestors compiled the Paneha Puranam. The Pancha Puranam consists of Thevaram, Thiruvasakam, Thiruvisaippa, Thirupallandu and Periya Puranam. Reciting the Pancha Puranam is equivalent to reciting all the twelve Thirumurais. * What are the benefits of worshipping the Navagrahas? The benefits of worshipping the Navagrahas (9 planets) are as follows: Sun - Health,knowledge, strengtheningof soul Moon _- Fame, willpower Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus Saturn Raghu Kethu Wealth, improves blood circulation, victory Education, knowledge Respect, Wealth\n\nBeauty, joy, eloquence Happiness, aetiveness Free from the fear of enemies, success Wisdom, blessed with children, paves Way to liberation * What is the purpose of celebrating festivals? The five functions of the Lord, ie. Creation, Protection, Destruction, Conceulment, amd Conferment of grace, are all impliecl through festivals. There are several vahanas (animall bird/tree mounts) for the gods. During Temple festivals, the Utsava Vigrahas (deities) are carried on their mounts in a procession by the devotees. The God matures the Anna during these processions. Hlnuu Yradltlons\n\nExplain the philosophy of Mount Karpaga Virutcham? The Lord is graciously present beneath the Mount Karpaga Virutcham (Tree). Like the root is the base of the tree, Lord Parameswara is the base of Creation. The branches and leaves of the tree signify innumerous living creatures. The seeds of the fruit denote the presence of the Lord in our souls_ * Explain the philosophy of Mount Boodha? Boodha Vahanam is the symbol of “Viruthi Krema Sankara Kolarn°(destruction form). It reveals that the Almighty controls the body made up of Panchabooclhas (earth, water, fire, space, air). * What is revealed by Mount Kailasa? Lord Siva is graciously present at Mount Kailasa, which reveals to us that he is beyond Manam, Vaakku and Kayam. Once when Ravana, a symbol of Aanav am, tried to lift this mountain, Lord Siva pressed it gently With his feet. Ravzma got caught beneath the mountain. Then he sang the Samagana, which pleased Lord Siva, and thus Ravana received a sword and a boon, This shows the graeefulness of God. It also emphasizes the fact that however crucl a person may be, on realization of his offences, the Almighty will forgive him and bless him, * Explain the philosophy of Mount Rishaba? During the Pralaya, the world was destroyed. The Dharma Devatha wanting to be immortal took the form of the Rishaba/ Nandhi (Bull). The Nandhi is the mount ofLord Si va and Parvathí. A symbol of strength, the four legs of the Nandhi represent 8 iunuu rraumøm\n\nSathyam, Dharmam, Shanthi and Premam. The N andhi is white in colour symbolising purity. Like-wise, if the soul is purified, the Almighty will shower His grace upon us. › * What is revealed through Mount Naga? The Naga (Cobra) conceals poison, gem and its hood, and exposes them whenever necessary, thus symbolising the function of Concealment. * What is the purpose of the Chariot festival? The Chariot festival indicates the destruction of Thiripuram, which implies getting rid of the three Malas. * Explain the philosophy of the Floating festival? The Lord saving the people from rebirths is denoted through the Floating festival. * Why only men opt for the life of Sanyasam lrenunciationl? ' Sanyasam is giving up everything and moving towards the Almighty. When men renounce everything and move towards God, they become sanyasis. As women worship their husbands as God, they already practice a life of renunciation, and therefore, they do not need sanyasam. * Explain the significance of Vibhuthi (Sacred ashl? How is it worn? As the cow dung purifies din, the sacred ash purifies the impurities in our body. The sacred ash also reveals to us that everybody will be in the fonn of ashes one day. ulnau-rr=u|:|=m mm _ M-\n\nThe sacred ash is worn on 16 places by those who took Dheekshai These are on the head, forehead, neck, chest, back, forearms (2) elbows (2) wrists (2), ribs (2), navel and knees (2). lt can also be Wom on 12 places excluding the forearms and wrists. * Why we wear the Uruthiratcham (Rudraksha beadsl? There is a myth that the tears of Lord Siva turned into the Uruthiratcham. It is said that one who wears the Uruthiratcham will not suffer from any miseiies. Also, recovery is faster when a small quantity of Uruthiratcham is taken along with medicine. * Why we wear Chanthanam and Kumkum? The Chanthanam reduces the body heat and refreshes us. Many nerves Converge inbetween the eyebrows, and hence to avoid the generation of heat we wear Kumkum. It also symbolizes the third eye of Lord Siva.\n\n* Why Vaishnavas wear Naamam? Gopi Chanthanam (a type of sand) is used for ^Naamam`. Wearing the Naamam implies that ultimately all things tum into sand. Besides, Vaishnavites wear this as a syrnbol of Lord Vishnu`s feet, to indieate that the human bcings have no other destination other than the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu. 10 umau nauitmns The Fanaous Saivite Temples in Sri Lanka Thiruketheeswaram (Mannar) Thirukctheeswaram temple in Mannar district is a very ancient temple. The origin of the temple is beyond the scope of History and Archaeology. However, Epics and Puranas show some light into the period. In one of the Yugas, three pieces of Merumalai were thrown into the Southern Sea, one of which became Thiruketheeswaram. Mahaduvatta, the eldest son of Viswakarma, created a city here called Mahaduvattapuram, which later became known as Maathottam. At the centre of this town he huilt a Si va temple. Saint Thirunavukarasar uttered the name of this holy place as “Thiruketheeswaram'. The songs of Thirugnanasambandar and Sundara Mooithy Nayanar sanctified this temple. Hence this sacred place is in itselfa holy place. Thirukoneswan-am ( Trincomaleel Thirukoneswaram is situated on a hill in the Northern seashore of Sri Lanka. This hill is otherwise known as Swamimalai. Dakshina Kailayam, Thirikoodam, Thenkaila Kaikesi are other names of this temple. The presiding deity at this temple is Koneswarar, and His consort is Maadhumai. The Punniya Theertham (temple tank) is known as Paavanaasam. The St_hala Virutcha (temple tree) is known as Kall Aal. The annual nlmu rraalmns 11\n\nfestival of the temple commences with hoisting of the flag on Full moon day associated with the star Uthiram, and ends with Theertham on Thiruthiyai Thithi associated with the starBharani. The songs of Thirugnanasambandar have sanctified the Thirukoneswaram Temple. Muneeswaram ( C hilla w) Silabam Muneeswaram is one amongst the Saivite temples\n\nin Sri Lanka. The presiding deity is Munnainaadhar, and His eonso1tisVadivaambikai. The punniya theertham is Mayavanaaru. This holy place is referred to as “Alageswaraml in the “Sanakumara Samhitha` of Sri Sivapuraanam. This is also one amongst the 64 Sridevipeedas. Dakshina Kailasa Mahatmiyam relates this place to Ramayana and Mahabharatha. When Rama came to Sri Lanka and destroyed Ravana, he was possessed by the Brahmahathi Dhosha (an evil influence). While returning to Ayodhya in a Vimana, and when passing this place, he was relieved from the Brahmahathi Dhosha. Hence, he got down and took a sacred bath in the temple tank. and then worshipped Munnainadhar and Vadivaamblkai. Nakuleswaram (K eerimalaí) In ancient times this holy place was known as Thiruthambaleswaram, but after Saint Nakula was blessed, it became known as Nakuleswaram. This Keerimalai Siva temple is situated on the banks of Sahara, the sacred river at the North 1 2 nlnuu Traﬂlclnns of Yazhpaanam (J af f na). Moorthy, Punniya Theertham and Thalam sanctify this temple. At this place diseases are cured, wishes are fulfilled and we attain a peace of mind. The punniya thecrtham is known as Gangasamudra Sangamam or Kandaki Theertham. It is stated that Musukunda Chakravarthy, Sri Rama, and Arjuna have all taken sacred baths in this Theertham and worshipped Goddess Nakulambikai and Lord Nakuleswara to fulfill their wishes. Maadhakal Mayilvakana Pulavar in his book “Yazhpana Vaibhavamalai” stated that: “Once in Kriddha Yuga, Parameswara and Parvathi were graciously present at this hill. During this time, Lord Parameswara made the “Kandaki Theertham` for Goddess Parvathi to take a sacred bath. Later, the celesti al beings bathed there and became sacred. Hence this place is known as Punniyapuram. Once when both Musukunda Chakravarth y and Saint Nakula bathed in the Kandaki Theertham and worshipped Lord Siva, the mongoose face of Saint Nakula transformed back to his original face. From then onwards this place was called Nakulamalai. The Lord here is Naguleswaran and His consort is Nakulambikai. From this story, it is undeistood that the Keerimalai Siva temple is very ancient and sacred because the Theertham was brought to Earth by Lord Siva during the first Yuga.” However, the Vakulagm Puranam states a modified version. Here it says that a hunter, whom due to the curse of Rishi Sudhama, acquired the face of a mongoose. He took a sacred bath in this\n\nTheertham and got rid of the curse. The hunter is none other than Saint Nakula and since then this place is known as Nakulapurarn. mnuu vrauieiøns 13\n\n-_-_... \\zun:~'n1:t'::;='f=„.=.\",: ›.'::=Tå \\\\\\t\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\t'tt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\tttlt'tttttttl 2 Z \\\\\\\\` 2 3% ;É › 2. ,_ ..\\l\\HL1-”:É~ ` 52 fi Pi „, ållmlålttl tutttlt è '2 nmuu vnnøtttmu |q|„p„ ta,-||m,„, Thiruketheeswaram /.-w fm an 2 Thaanthonri Eeswarar - Kokkaticholai lßatticaloal A Saint from lndia. on u pilgrimttge to Kutltirgainatn, sat under a Kokatti tree und reached Sumadhi.

The Thiruvampavai festival is celebrated for nine days. The tenth day is Thiruvadhirai. Thiruvadhirai This is also a significant day for Lord Siva. This auspieious Viradham is observed in Marghazhi on the star Thirvadhirai, and Lord Siva is known as Adhiraiyan. People observe fasting and go to the temple for Arudhara darshan on this day. This festival is famous in\n\nChidambaram, Tamil Nadu (India). Vaikunda Ekadhasi Vaikunda Ekadhasi falls on the eleventh day after New moon day in the month of Margazhi. This is significant to Lord Vishnu. Devotees observe fast and worship Vishnu throughout the ni ght. In Vishnu temples, the main entrance gate is opened on this day, and aspirants enter the temple. This symbolizes the entrance into Vaikuntha (Heaven). mun\" maan: 43\n\nSukkiravara Viratham This is observed on Fridays throughout the Year. Though the prcsiding deity is Lord Muruga, Sakthi and Ganapathy are also worshipped. Prathosa Viradham This Viradharn is observed on Thirayothasi Thithi, the thirteenth day of both the waxing moon and waning moon, seeking Siva”s grace. The Puranas narrate the following story of a Siva's miracle: “During the Kunno Avatar, both the Devas and Asuras used the mountain Meru as a maththu, and the snake Vasuki as a rope, to chum the Thiruparkadal (milky ocean). Their intention was to drink the Amirtham (nectar) produced and become immortal. While churning, the Vasuki spurted poison into the sea. Seeing this, the Devas and Asuras seeked Lord Siva at Mount Kailas and surrendered to Him. Hence, in order to save them, Lord Siva consumed the poison and told them to continue chuming the rnilky ocean. On the dawn of Thuvadhasi day (twelfth day), Amittham appeared, and all rejoiced. The following day, Thirayodhasi day (thirteenth day), they went to Lord Siva and asked for forgi veness. Lord Siva pardoned them with His grace. In the evening, Lord Siva danced in between the homs of the ldabam (Nandhi). The Devas were fonunate to get a glimpse of this, and hence Were blessed. The Puranas state that the time of this dance perfonnance was during the Prathosa kalam (between 4.30pm and 6 pm). ` Special pooj as are conducted during this ti mc in Siva temples. Lamps with ghee are lit before the Nandhi and Lord Siva. Red rice, and a garl and made from amgampul are offered to the Nandhi. 44 mmm 1r=ui:|øm After the pooj as, the idol of Lord Siva is carried around the inner premises of the temple three times in a procession led by the Musicians. In the first round the Nadhaswaram is played, in the second round the Vedha Parayanam is recited, and in the third round the\n\nPannim Thirumurais are recited. There is a special routine by which Lord Siva should be worshipped during the Prathosa kalarn (ie. without crossing the Komuhai). It is customary to Worship Him in this way at the Siva temple. Food is consumed only in the evening after the pooja. Those who worship Lord Siva on this day are excused for not worshipping him on other days.
