        "text": "This section contains selected songs from Twelve Thirumurais. Each link has one song as it is reproduced from the thirumurai followed by Meaning in English and and additional notes section again in English. These are part of the ThirumuRai Series posted in some of the Hinduism mailing lists.\n\nPlease note that providing meaning and elaboration texts to thirumuRais has been discouraged in the tradition because they are not like just any other texts, but have been given to us staying intune with the Grace of God. The meaning needs to be felt and depending upon the state one is in these holy texts would give appropriate meaning. In fact the same person would feel the same song to indicate different substances at different points of time. The idea of thirumuRai series is not to provide any exhaustive meaning given the truth of the statements above. It is only something to start with or to be used as a reference to get some idea. May God forgive the errors.\n\nForeword\n\nYear 2001 Archive\n\nYear 2002 Archive\n\nYear 2003 Archive\n\nYear 2004 Archive\n\nYear 2005 Archive\n\nYear 2006 Archive\n\nYear 2007 Archive\n\n2006\n\nthirunAvukkarasar mentioning sambandhar 909\n\nSeries No.\n\nTitle\n\nSong\n\nFirst thirumuRai (sambandhar) - January\n\n681 enadhurai thanadhuraiyAga manamulAm aDiyavarkku 682 Our Folks vambAr kunRam 683 The Thief n^Ir paran^tha n^imir 684 Rig kuRaL n^Ila mA miDaRRu 685 You reside in places of contrast too! pADaka mellaDip 686 Steals minds of all who approach puNNiyar bUthiyar 687 Want to be misled by novices? vEr van^thuRa 688 He tricked me and got in!! mUvA vaNNar muLai 689 One Who is in union, toegether and distinct IRAy muthalonRAy iru 690 How does Lord shiva do creation, sustenance and reduction? buvam vaLi 691 vEdhAraNayam cilaithanai n^aDuviDai 692 In the heads of sincere devotees karavinRi n^an 693 We see His Foot offering flowers poDiyuDai mArbinar 694 Our Crown; Our Lord thiN^gaL ucci 695 The five do not let me focus thAyum n^IyE 696 Remove hurdles, oh Lord! n^innaDiyE vazipaDuvAn 697 They are as good as dead pUththErn^dhu 698 Want to be an ascetic? oDuN^kum piNi 699 Tell me His Name ciRaiyArum maDakkiLiyE 700 Burnt three and Blessed three pUvAr malarkoNDu 701 Worshipping only Lord shiva maicceRi kuvaLai 702 thiruvezukURRirukkai - Effect of reading all padhikams OruruvAyinai\n\nSecond thirumuRai (sambandhar) - February\n\n703 What is the easiest way to get liberation? vIDum nyAnamum 704 Munificent who always gives boons irakkam onRumilAn 705 Free from misery! viNNAnE viNnavar 706 To lead a happy married life ayilArum ambadhanAR 707 One with Blemishless Fame olin^Ir caDaiyil 708 To get rid of karma kallAl n^izal 709 thirunaLLARu EDu mali 710 My Sweet Lord empirAn enakku 711 Is heaven the ultimate spot? maN^kul thOy\n\nThird thirumuRai (sambandhar) - March\n\n712 Bless to shrink our karma ADinAy n^aRu 713 If this is Your grace, so be it! n^anavinum kanavinum 714 I am a sinner.
