The Tirumurai is a 12-volume compendium of Tamil hymns from the 6th-11th centuries praising Shiva. It was compiled by Nambi Andar Nambi in the 12th century and includes works by various poets like Appar, Sambandar, Sundarar, and Manickavasagar. Additional texts were added to the compilation over time based on the importance of the works and their popularity among Saiva scholars. The Tirumurai, along with other religious texts, forms the philosophical basis of the Saiva Siddhanta tradition in Tamil Nadu.",
