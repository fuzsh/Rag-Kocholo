Varunan was given the task of creating those flowers in the temple moat. Indran ran short of a flower during pooja one day. He inquired with Varunan who was very confident that he had created 108 flowers. When this continued for a few days, Indran himself decided to keep a watch on the flowers. Ultimately, he noticed one of the flowers moving out of the water into the garba graham (sanctum sanctorum) through the drain onto the top of the Shivalingam. On closer scrutiny, he saw that it was a Golden crab that had brought the flower from the waters. As he was about to hit the crab, it made a hole right on top of the Shivalingam and disappeared into it. Since then He came to be known as Karkadeswarar (Karkata means Crab).\n\nIt is believed that this Crab was a Yaksha who taunted Sage Dhurvasa. He mimicked the walk of the Sage like the crawl of a crab and made fun of him. The Sage who was well known for his short temper, cursed the Yaksha to turn into a crab. Quickly realising his folly, the Yaksha apologised to the Sage and sought a remedy. The Sage advised him to worship Lord Shiva at this temple for absolution of his sin.\n\nShiva, in the guise of an elder, is said to have rid of painful affliction of a devout King; The Lord also said to have directed the King to a spot where the current lingam was found and then disappeared.

There are only paddy fields as far as you can see.\n\nThere are two shrines for Ambal here, Arumarundu Nayaki and Apoorva Nayaki. The idol of Arumarundu Nayaki was once stolen and a replacement idol was installed but within a day of installing the new idol, the stolen idol was recovered. Hence the original idol then came to be known as Apoorva Nayaki.\n\nChandra in this place is in yoga posture and this is a Chandra dosha nivarana sthalam.\n\nThe Shivalingam has the mark of a cut on its face.\n\nTimings:9 AM to 1 PM and 4 PM to & 7 PM.

Sri Kanchi\n\nAfter adorning the Kanchi peetam for nearly 5 decades, Sri Bodendral achieved Jeevan Mukthi on the banks of River Cauvery in 1692 on a Purattasi month full moon day. Treating himself as consort to Lord Rama, he achieved Jeevan Mukthi by burying himself in ground, just like Sita Devi had done. For a while, this place was lost and forgotten and more than 100 years later, in 1803, Sri Marudhanallur Sadguru Swamigal discovered this place after hearing Rama namam emanating from water here. When the Swamigal discovered this place, he also found Nama Kaumudi that Sri Bodendral had carried with him all along. Also, Marudhanallur Swamigal had his Shishya, King Sarabhoji divert the river. Even now, there are reports of devotees hearing Rama namam in Sri Bodendral’s Adhishtanam in Govindapuram.\n\nAs an interesting aside, the Adhishtanam of Sri Atma Bodendral, the predessor and guru of Sri Bodendral was also unknown till it was dramatically discovered by Sri Kanchi Paramacharyal in 1927. Paramacharyal speculated that Sri Bodendral started wearing Vaishnava symbol of Urdhva Pundiram instead of the traditional Saivite symbol of Vibhooti.\n\nAmong the miracles attributed to Sri Bodendral, he made a dumb boy chant Bhagavan Namam and he cured a Brahma Rakshas by chanting Rama Namam.\n\nAnnadhanam on Srardha days:\n\nSri Kanchi Periyaval had a great connection to this place and established the procedure of Annadhanam during the Srartha days of the pithrus which has become highly popular now. By paying staring from 2000/= people can arrange for lifetime annadhanam during the Srardha thithis of loved ones.

Over a period of time, the Brahmin became black and huge ugly figure due to sins he accumulated. To get back to normal form he started penancing in the middle of fire for 12 years. Shiva was pleased with his worship and granted boon but he started troubling everyone again. Indra was afraid of the Brahmin and he worshiped the Lord here. Shiva sent Agoramurthy to punish the brahmin and to take him into custody. Since he was a true devotee, Shiva excused him for his sin and made incharge for the nandavanam.\n\nTemple:\n\nThe linga is a Swayambu and is said to be formed of a sort of white clay material.

Salt or any food item containing salt is not allowed in the temple beyond Garuda’s Sannidhi. It is a sin to carry salt inside the temple. Hence the Lord is also called as ‘Lavana Varjita Venkatesa’ i.e., Venkatesa who avoids salt.\n\nLegend:\n\nOnce Sage Markandeya prayed for children and Goddess Bhumi Devi was reborn as his daughter near a Tulsi plant. Later, Lord Uppiliyappan came in disguise as an old man and sought marriage to Sage Markandeya. Rishi also accepted, but he was worried that his daughter is too young and does not know about household things and does not know even to put salt in food. Lord accepted that whatever she cooks he would eat showing mercy towards the Rishi Markandeya. Marriage was held in pomp and Glory. To this day, the prasadam offered will be of without salt in order to approve the Lord’s words.\n\nHe is also called an elder brother of Lord Venkateshwara of Tirumala Hills.\n\nThe Lord is praised by the Nayanmars as Oppila Appan (means not comparable with anybody).\n\nTemple:\n\nThere is no separate shrine for Bhoomidevi here and She is sitting with folded hands by the side of the Lord in the main sanctum sanctorum. The Lord is always with His consort and the utsava deity oppiliappan is never taken out of the temple without His consort, Bhoomidevi, during the festivals (because She is too young?).\n\nThe temple has a holy tank inside the temple premises.\n\nThe area for pradakshinam has many beautiful paintings of Dasavatar.\n\nLinks: Location Photos Website\n\nAyyavadi Maha Prathyankara temple\n\nLocation: 1 km south of Uppiliappan temple\n\nLegend:\n\nThis village was once called as Aivar Padi. According to legends, the 5 Pandavas visited this place, kept their weapons under a tree, worshipped Sri Maha Prathyangira Devi and went around in the forests. As the five Pandavas worshipped here, it is beleived that the place was called as Aivar (means 5 in tamil) Padi which later changed as Ayyavadi.\n\nLord Narasimha became very ferocious after killing the demon king Hiranyakasipu. Lord Shiva took the Sarabeswarar form to cool down the ferocity of Lord Narasimha. The Sarabeswara form has lion’s face with eagle’s wings. Shakthi accompanied Lord Shiva in the form of Sri Maha Prathyangira Devi seated on one of the wings.\n\nIn Ramayana, Indrajit, son of Ravana performed a Yaga called “Nigumbalai Yagam”, worshipping Sri Maha Prathyangira Devi at this place. Had he completed the Yaga successfully, he would have got the powers to kill Rama but it was spoiled by Lakshmana and Anjaneya before the completion.\n\nSri Maha Prathyangira Devi is an important Goddess in Shakthi worship. Prathyankira and her moola manthram was discovered by 2 rishis in ancient times – they were Angiras and Prathyankiras, in whose honour the Goddess assumed the name of Prathyankira. She is also known as Aparajitha.\n\nTemple:\n\nHere the Devi is seated on the chariot with 4 lions, 8 arms with weapons possessing Lion’s face.\n\nSri Maha Prathyangira Devi’s worship will take away all evil forces and unsolvable problems from one’s life.

Thirunaaraiyur is one of the 275 Shaivaite Thevara Paadal petra sthalam near Kattumannarkoil / Chidambaram, the name coming from the legend connected to the Naarai (நாரை) bird, whereas Thirunaraiyur, also called as Nachiyar koil, is one of the 108 Vaishnavaite Divya Desams, near Kumbakonam very popular for its Kal Garudan. To add confusion, Thirunaaraiyur is connected with Nambiandar Nambi, the saivaite saint who compiled the Thevara hymns, whereas in Thirunaraiyur (Nachiyar koil), the Perumal Himself is called as Nambi.\n\n1) DD014 – Nachiar koil Srinivasa Perumal (Kal Garudan) Temple – Divya Desam\n\nLocation: 10 kms from kumbakonam.\n\nMain deity: Thiru nariyur nambi, Srinivasa Perumal in standing posture with Consort Vanjulavalli Thayar in bride posture.\n\nTheertham: Mani mutha theertham\n\nSignificances:\n\nOne of the 108 Divya desams\n\nThis is the birth place of Nachiyar (Sri Devi)\n\nOne of the few Divya Desams where Goddess has prominence over the Lord. The others are Srivilliputhur (birth place of Sri Andal), Woraiyur and Thiruvellarai. While Srivilliputhur is called Naachiyaar Thiru Maaligai, Thiru Naraiyur is called Naachiyar Koil. There is no separate Sannidhi for Goddess and She is always seen together with the Lord. On all occasions, the first rights are reserved for the Nachiyar. Even the food is first served to the Nachiyar and only then to the Naraiyur Nambi. We can see the Lord slightly by the side and the Goddess is the one who has the prominent position inside the sanctum. Even from the entrance of the temple, one gets a glimpse of Vanjulavalli Nachiyar.\n\nRishi Medhaavi wanted Goddess to be born as his daughter and undertook penance on the banks of the Manimutha river. Pleased with his penance, Goddess was born under the Vanjula tree and the Rishi brought her up as Vanjula Valli. Both Lord and Nachiyar got married here and they are seen here in a beautiful wedding posture, a unique feature at this Divya Desam.\n\nThiru Naraiyur Nambi is the only Divya Desam Lord to have offered the Pancha Samaskaram initiation to anyone. As a mark of initiating the Pancha Samaskaaram on the ThiruMangai Mannan, Lord Srinivasa is seen leaning forward slightly, quite a unique sight at this temple.\n\nThiru Naraiyur Lord is praised as Nambi. Lords of only a few Divya Desams have been praised as Nambi. The most prominent among them is Thiru Kurungkudi. An Achaarya is referred to as Nambi and since Thiru Naraiyur Lord initiated the Pancha Samaskaram to ThiruMangai Mannan, he became the Achaarya of Thiru Mangai Azhvaar.\n\nRecognising this special initiation of Pancha Samaskaaram, ThiruMangai Azhvaar praised the Lord with over 100 Paasurams, the highest for any temple. The only other Lord that ThiruMangai Azhvaar has praised with 100 Paasurams is Thiru Kannapuram Sowri Rajan Perumal, where the Lord explained the Thiru Mandhiram to Thirumangai Azhvaar.\n\nAn old Brahmin wanted to see all the Divya Desams. However, he could not visit because of his old age. The old Brahmin prayed before ThiruNaraiyur Nambi, who is said to have given the idols of all the 108 Divya Desam Lords to the Brahmin. This is the only Divya Desam where the idols of all the 108 Divya Desams can be seen in one place.\n\nKal Garuda (Stone Garuda):\n\nGaruda, the vehicle of the lord, is of special significance at this temple. The story goes that a sculptor who was creating an image of Garuda suddenly found the idol flying after he had made its wings. Shocked at this sudden action, the sculptor threw a stone at Garuda and struck him on the nose. Garuda came falling down and decided to settle here at this place and bless the devotees. A huge and well built Lord Garuda is seen just next to Lord Srinivasa’s Sannidhi.\n\nDuring street procession (Margazhi and Panguni), an unbelievable event takes place at the Nachiyar Koil. While only 4 people carry Lord Garuda out of his Sannidhi, as the Lord goes out of each layer and prakaram, he is said to increase in weight, that 8 people, 16 and then 32 people are required to carry Lord Garuda out of the temple. Finally, when the Lord is taken outside the temple, Garuda increases in weight so much that 64 people are required to carry the Lord. On his way back, it is said that Garuda mount decreases in weight and finally when he is back in the Sannidhi, only 4 people are required to carry him.\n\nOn Thursdays the Lord gives Dharsan with his family (seated) on the stone Garuda.\n\nKal Garuda is said to answer the prayers of devotees immediately and remove all Doshams. Childless couples, unmarried women, people with Naaga Dosham etc will also be relieved if they pray to the Kal Garuda at Thiru Naraiyur temple.\n\nTemple:\n\nBuilt by the Chola King Ko Chengan, the temple has 16 Gopurams including the 5 tiered Raja Gopuram. Ko Chengan had already built 70 Saivite Temples and this one, the 71st, was his first Vaishnavite temple. Hence, this temple has a lot of resemblances to Saivite temples, in its form and structure. The temple has been built in such a way that one can see the sanctum even from outside the temple premises. With several layers, each comprising of several steps, leading to the sannidhi, the sanctum looks like being atop a hill, on first looks from the temple entrance. Ko Chengan built many temples in this style called ‘Mada koil’ where elephants can not enter (has a legend connection with Thiruvanaikkaval at Trichy).\n\nThis is the only Divya Desam where Lord is seen with a conch and charka in front of his face.\n\nAnother unique feature at this Divya Desam is that the Vimaanam above the Sanctum Sanctum is like a tower.\n\nThis is the only Divya Desam where one finds a 10 feet Brahmma in a standing posture within the sanctum. In other Divya Desams one finds the image of Brahmma on the wall.\n\nNachiyar Koil is the beginning of the Krishnaaranya Kshetram. This continues at Thiru Cherai, Thiru Kannamangai and finally ends at Thiru Kannangudi, near Nagapattinam.\n\nTemple timing: 6:30 am – 12.30 pm and 4:30 pm – 8:30 pm\n\nLinks: Location Photos Weblink\n\n2) SCN065 – Siddheswaram Shiva Temple\n\nLocation: 9 kms from kumbakonam\n\nMain deity: Siddhanathar-Swayambu lingam.

The temple is considered as holy as Rameswaram and many devotees who are unable to visit Rameswaram make their offerings to the Lord here.\n\nLord Saneeswaran, called Mangala Saneeswaran here, is present with his two wives Mandhadevi and Jyeshtadevi (also known as Neeladevi) and two sons, Maandhi and Kuligan. This is the only place where Saneeswaran is present with his whole family. Though a sub-shrine, Saturn’s abode here has separate Dhwajasthambam, Balipeetam and the crow mount in front of it and this temple is more popular as a Saneeswarar temple.\n\nLegend:\n\nLord Rama and Anjaneya, during their return from Lanka to Ayodhya worshipped Shiva here.\n\nWhen King Dasaratha ruled the entire world, Saturn was to pass through Rohini star after staying in Krithigai, on one occasion. Sage Vasishta and others told Dasaratha that if Saturn did so it would spell doom for the world. There would be famine everywhere for 12 years and animals and human beings would be put to much hardship. He requested Dasaratha to prevent it. Dasaratha immediately got into his fast-moving chariot, carrying all Divine weapons and reached the star, Rohini. He saw Saturn moving in his golden chariot towards Rohini and sent the Divine weapons including the “Samhara Asthram” towards him. Saturn, laughing at the king’s futile attempts, told him that He could destroy anybody by His mere look. The powers that Dasaratha had got through severe penance, austerity and Divine grace prevented Saturn from eliminating him. Dasaratha requested Saturn not to pass through Rohini and thus spare the world from experiencing famine for 12 years. Saturn was immensely pleased with the king’s concern for the welfare of his subjects and granted the two requests. He also told him that if he visited Thirunaraiyur and bathed in the tank there he would appear before him. Dasaratha did accordingly and Saturn appeared before him.\n\nTemple:\n\nMedha Dakshinamoorthy is is one of enchanting beauty. There are shrines for Vinayaka, Subramania with His consorts, Valli and Devasena, Gajalakshmi, Hanumantha Lingam, Annamalaiyar, Brahma, Durgadevi and Chadikeswarar.

This minister was a great worshipper of Saranatha Perumal of Thirucherai and wanted to erect a temple for Him too. So he ordered his men to unload one stone from each cart which passed Thirucherai.
