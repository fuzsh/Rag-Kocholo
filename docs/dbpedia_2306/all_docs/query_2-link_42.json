The invocatory verse of Acharya Madhva's Brahma Sutra Bhashya and Anubhashya invokes Lord Narayana. It summarizes that Narayana is full of auspicious qualities, devoid of all defects, the ultimate object of knowledge to be attained, and the author's guru. Rayaru's commentary explains that the four qualities refer to the four chapters of the Brahma Sutra and establish Narayana as the subject matter. The verse establishes the foundation for interpreting the sutras according to Dvaita philosophy and revealing the true meaning intended by Vedavyasa.",
