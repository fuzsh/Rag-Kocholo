        "text": "In this article an attempt has been made to analyse the temple styles of the district of Purulia. More or less all the surviving temples are documented and classified according to their distinct styles. It is seen that stone and brick temples are standing side by side within a complex. It is also noted that deul is built with brick and on the other hand chala is built by stones. Temples, are decorated in a simple way with terracotta plaques for brick temples and block of carving stones for the stone temples. Beside these temples a good number of iconographical figurines are also found in the temple premises and sometimes in the sanctum of the temple. A light is also thrown on the continuation of the building of temples since 9-10th century up to 18- 19th century.\n\nThe Gupta Age (400 CE-600 CE) witnessed new experimentations in the construction of structural temples by means of dressed stones in dry stone masonry, i.e., without the use of mortar. In this technique, blocks of stone were joined together by tenon-and-groove method, i.e., the tenon of one block of stone is inserted in hole created in the other. Some of the famous Gupta structural temples in stone are Temple number 17 (Buddhist) at Sanchi (Pl. 24, Fig. 24), the Kankali Devi at Tigawa (Fig. 25), the temples of Vishnu and Varaha at Eran (Figs. 26 & 27) and the Parvati temple at Nachna-Kuthara (Pl. 26, Fig 28), all in Madhya Pradesh. The Dasavatara temple at Deogarh in Distt. Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh (Pl. 27, Fig. 29) , the Siva temple at Bhumara in Madhya Pradesh (Pl. 28, Fig. 30) and the brick temples at Bhitargaon (Pl. 29, Fig. 31) and Bhitari (U.P.) and the Vishnu Temple at Sirpur in Chhatisgarh (Pl. 30, Fig. 32) are some of the evolved Gupta temples. The basic plan of the structural temple, which became the standard for the temples in India for all time to come also emerged during this period. As a result, a simple square cella with flat roof fronted by a low-pillared porch or mandapa (for example, Sanchi Temple 17), represented the beginning of new structural temple architecture in India. This two-unit plan, it may be noted, was the product of the two basic needs of the devotee, the bhakta of all India-born religions-the cella exclusively for the deity, and a porch for the devotees. Further, and this is equally important, both the units-the former called 'garbha-griha' and the latter 'mandapa' have necessarily to be located in one and same axis since the devotee should have the darsana or visibility of his god standing right in his front. The sanctum had no ventilation other than a door in the front wall. Later, a covered pradakshinapatha was added to the garbha-griha for the devotees to go round it. As time passed, the sikhara was raised over the roof. It was a great innovation that added imposing verticality to the otherwise modest house-like structure. Many decorative motifs like goblins, couples, flying angels, door-keepers, nymphs (apsaras), etc., appeared on the walls, pillars, door-jambs, lintels and ceiling of the sikhara as well as the mandapa. In other words, attention was now also paid to the embellishment of the structure to create the right type of ambience, religious and spiritual, for the devotees. It also helped in the growth of the number of the devotees visiting the temples. The needs also became important for the architects. They therefore, decided to add a vestibule or antarala between the garbha-griha and the mandapa. Later, this mandapa became quite large to accommodate more people. It was then called mahamandapa. But to enter it directly from the outside was not considered right thing to do. So first added a small mandapa and called it ardha-mandapa. Later, a small\n\nThe decline of the Gupta Age by the end of the 6 th century witnessed the birth of a paramount power in north India under the Vardhanas of Thaneswar. Harshavardhana, the prominent ruler of this dynasty, however, for most part of his life ruled from Kannauj. Soon after them, i.e., by the second half of the 7 th century, smaller kingdoms emerged in north, central and northwestern India. These royal houses played a very important role in the further development of Nagara style of temple architecture which was introduced by the Guptas in the 5 th-6 th centuries. The major dynasties that flourished at different periods of time between 7 th and 11 th centuries, and which gave immense patronage to temple building activities, were the Gurjara-Pratiharas (8 th-11 th century), the Kalachuris (8 th-13 th century), the Paramaras (9 th-14 th century), the Solankis (10-13 th century) and the Chandellas (10 th-13 th century). They, individually and collectively, contributed greatly to the growth of the Nagara architectural tradition but with regional variations. The early Pratihara temples at Gwalior, Gyaraspur and Baroli in Madhya Pradesh show various stages of the development of central Indian temple architecture. For example, the Teli-ka-Mandir (c. 9 th century) dedicated to Sakti cult at Gwalior, is the oldest Pratihara temple in this region (Pl. 31). It has a rectangular mula-prasada (mula means 'root', 'original', etc., the main shrine where deity is consecrated) with the oblong sikhara or spire. It is also significant to note that here the Dravida style of sikhara penetrated somewhat strangely in this heartland of India at this early stages. The topmost part of the sikhara has the barrel-vaulted or wagon-top roof called sala sikhara-the reminiscent of the Dravidian order. The stepped-pyramidal roof, also called as 'Phamsana roof', built above the porch, is also peculiar to this early temple in this region. The sides of the temple wall have three projections with intermediate recessions. Rudimentary form of 'Latina' sikharas (sikharas resembling 'sugar loaf' mass), kudu window arches and lotus medallions decorate the exterior. From this simple style of architecture developed Latina mula-prasadas with pradakshina-pathas, balconies with chajjas or overhanging eaves, mandapas or halls with open vedika (railing) for free transmission of air and light. The Phamsana, or gable roofs, were adorned with purna-kalasa or padma-kumbha capitals or finials fixed along the long axis of the gable roof. The later Pratiharas further developed the mula-prasada and its superstructure. The basic elements of the north Indian temples are found in these temples (Figs. 33, 34, 35a, 35b & 36). This development can be seen in the temples of Baroli and Gyaraspur in Madhya"
