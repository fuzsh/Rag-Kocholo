        "text": "1.1.3. The Greatness of Ascetics\n\n21. The greatness of those who, while abiding in the rule of conduct peculiar to their state, have abandoned all desire.\n\n22 To describe the measure of the greatness of those who have forsaken the two-fold desires, is like counting the dead.\n\n23. The greatness of those who have renounced the world shines on this earth.\n\n24. He who guides his five senses by the hook of wisdom will be a seed in the world of heaven.\n\n25. Those who have destroyed their bad habits in this material earth, are capable of meeting the great Lord Indra, the god of heavens.\n\n26. The great will do those things which are difficult to be done; but the mean cannot do them.\n\n27. The world is within the knowledge of him who knows the properties of taste, sight, touch, hearing and smell.\n\n28. The hidden words of the men whose words are full of effect, will exhibit their greatness to the world.\n\n29. The anger of those who have ascended the mountain of goodness, though it continues but for a moment, it cannot be resisted.\n\n30. The virtuous are truly called Brahmins; because in their conduct towards all creatures they are clothed in kindness.\n\n1.1.4. Assertion of the Strength of Virtue\n\n31. Virtue will confer heaven and wealth; what greater source of happiness can man possess?\n\n32. There can be no greater source of evil than the forgetfulness of it.\n\n33. As much as possible, in every way, incessantly practise virtue.\n\n34. Let him who does virtuous deeds be of spotless mind; to that extent is virtue; all else is vain show.\n\n35. In order to develop a better conduct, free from these bad habits like lust, desire, anger and greediness.\n\n36. Don’t postpone your work for tomorrow, do it right now!\n\n37. The fruit of virtue need not be described in books; it may be inferred from seeing the bearer of a palanquin and the rider therein.\n\n38. If one allows no day to pass without some good being done, his conduct will be a stone to block up the passage to other births.\n\n39. Only that pleasure which flows from domestic virtue is pleasure; all else is not pleasure, and it is without praise.\n\n40. ‘Virtue’ sums the things that should be done;\n\n1.2 Domestic Virtue\n\n1.2.1. Domestic Life\n\n41. The men of household virtue will be called a (true) householder, who travels in a good path.\n\n42. The man for household virtue will be said to flourish in domestic virtue who aids the forsaken, the poor, and the dead.\n\n43. The chief (duty of the householder) is to preserve the five-fold rule (of conduct) towards the manes, the Gods, his guests, his relations and himself.\n\n44. When a person shares his food with others would never fail in his life.\n\n45. If the married life contains true love and affection, then those couple could see the heaven in the earth itself.\n\n46. What will he who lives virtuously in the domestic state gain by going into the other, (ascetic) state?\n\n47. Among all those who labour (for future happiness) he is greatest who lives well in the household state.\n\n48. The householder who, not swerving from virtue, helps the ascetic in his way endures more than those who endure penance.\n\n49. Domestic life, if blameless found, due praise may claim. The marriage state is truly called virtue. The other state is also good, if others do not reproach it.\n\n50. Who shares domestic life, by household virtues graced, Shall, mid the Gods, in heaven who dwell, be placed.\n\n1.2.2 The Goodness of the Help to Domestic Life"
