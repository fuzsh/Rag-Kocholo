        "text": "Visited on: November 1, 2015\n\nLocation\n\nKarur is very well connected by road from other major cities. Karur has a Railway station on Trichy - Erode route. Around 80 kms from Trichy and 65 kms from Erode. Nearest airport is at Trichy.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nMoolavar\n\nSri Kalyana Pasupatheeswarar /\n\nSri Ahnilaiyappar /Sri Pasupathy Nathar\n\nAmbal\n\n1. Sri Soundyarya Nayaki (Vadivudaiyal)\n\n2. Sri Alangara Nayaki\n\nTheertham (Holy water)\n\nBrahma Theertham, Thadaagai Theertham, Ambiravathi-Amaravathi River\n\nSthala Vriksham (Sacred Tree)\n\nVanji\n\nPathigam (Hymn) rendered by\n\nSaint Thirugnanasambanthar\n\nThis is one of the 276 Devara Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalams and 7th Sthalam in Kongu Nadu.\n\nThe temple is very big - its main Tower (Rajagopuram) is 120 feet high with 7-tiers and two corridors. This temple is facing the East.\n\nThe Moolavar Lingam in the temple is a Swayambumurthi (self-manifested).\n\nThis temple is renowned for its three splendours - Moorthy (The Presiding Deity), Sthalam (Place of divinity) and Theertham (The Holy Water).\n\nLord Brahma is believed to be the first ever devotee to worship Lord Shiva in this temple.\n\nIt is also believed that the divine bovine–goddess Kamadenu has worshipped Lord Shiva here. Its hoof mark is visible on the Lingam. The name Ahnilaiyappar is derived from “Ah” meaning cow (Kamadenu) and “nilai” meaning place.\n\nThis is the birth place of Eripatha Nayanar, one of the 63 Nayanmars.\n\nKing Pugazh Cholan, who later became a Nayanar (one of the 63 Nayanmars) also belongs to this place.\n\nKarur has the reputation of being the birthplace of Karuvurar Siddhar, (also called Karuvur Devar), one of the 18 famous Siddhars of South India. Karuvurar Siddhar has praised the Lord in his hymns “Thiruvisaippa”, which forms a part of the 9th Thirumurai. This Siddhar’s life forms an important part of this temple’s legacy. The story goes that some Brahmins complained against Karuvurar Siddhar to the king that the Siddhar was following the Vama Margam - offering wine and meat to the Lord. Upon enquiry it was revealed that this complaint was baseless and the king punished the complainants. However, unable to bear the continual harassment, he ran towards the shrine, embraced and became unified with the Lord Ahnilaiyappar. Because of his embracement, the Lingam is found in a slanting position. Inside the temple, there is a Jeeva Samathi of Karuvurar Siddhar.\n\nVisited on: 2nd November, 2015\n\nLocation\n\nBhavani is 16 kms away from Erode and about 55 kms away from Selam. The nearest Railway station for Bhavani is Erode. It is on the main Chennai-Trichi-Coimbatore bypass route.

So the Lord Shiva here is called as Sri Sangameswarar (Sangamam meaning confluene).\n\nThe temple is situated at the foothill of Padma Giri and is surrounded by four hills - Naga Giri, Veda Giri, Mangala Giri and Sanga Giri.\n\nThe temple has a beautiful five-tiered main tower (Rajagopuram) with two corridors.\n\nHistory of the Temple\n\nBhavani Sangameshwarar temple is an ancient one, having been built by the first Pallava King, Mahendra Verman. The bird’s eye view of this temple shows it as an island surrounded by the two rivers.\n\nIt is also said that a British dignitary by the name of William Garo donated a swing / cradle (Oonjal) made of ivory after he miraculously escaped from the collapse of his Rest house in the year 1802. He felt that he was saved by the Goddess herself and became an ardent devotee after this incident. His signature can be seen on the frame of the cradle.\n\nVisited on: November 1, 2015\n\nLocation\n\nAbout 22 kms from Karur. Route: Karur- Aravakkurichi- Venjamangudalur. Town Bus route: Karur to Atrumedu. Nearest railway station is at Karur.

Hence, this place gets the name Koodalur (confluence).\n\nA hunter king by the name of Venjaman, who ruled this place is said to have worshipped Lord Shiva here. Hence this place is also called Venjamaakoodal.\n\nThe temple was washed away by severe floods in the river Kudakanaru. It was rebuilt in the year 1982. However, this temple is still 10-12 feet below the road level, which shows the possible impact of the damages done during the flood.\n\nVisited on: November 1, 2015\n\nLocation\n\n40 kms from Erode and 25 kms from Karur. Kodumudi has a railway station on Trichy to Erode route.

There are three adjacent temples inside the same premises for Lords Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma.\n\nAll the three towers are east facing.\n\nThe temple has epigraphs from the time period of King Sundarapandiyan Kesari’s rule.\n\nLegend\n\nAccording to the legend there was a competition between Adiseshan (the serpent on whom Sri Mahavishnu rests) and Vayu (Lord of the Winds) to determine who is stronger. Lord Indiran prescribed certain rules to conduct the competition. They put Mount Meru at the centre and it was held tightly by Adiseshan, Vayu blew the wind with all his might to push Adiseshan. In the ensuing struggle, Meru’s peak (Magudam) split into 5 pieces and fell in five different places.\n\nIt is believed that the pieces came down as 5 different gem stones – Red Corel at Thiruvannamalai, Ruby (Manickam) at Rathinagiri (Thiruvatpokki), Emerald (Maragatham) at Engoimalai, Sapphire (Neelam) at Pothigaimalai and Diamond at Kodumudi. As per legend the Diamond that feel at Kodumudi became the Swayambulingam (self-manifested lingam) and the rest of the stones became hills. Since the origin of the lingam is from the Meru, the lord is called Magudeswarar.\n\nIt is also believed that Sage Agasthiyar installed and worshiped the idol of Lord Shiva and his finger prints can be seen on the deity.\n\nIt is also believed that Kodumudi is the place where Lord Shiva performed a dance for Sage Bharadwajar.\n\nIt is also said that both these sages were blessed with Lord Shiva’s wedding darshan here."
