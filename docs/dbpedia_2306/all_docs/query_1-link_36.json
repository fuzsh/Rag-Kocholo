The Annamalai University extended its invitation to the All- India Oriental Conference to hold its XV1I1 Session at Annamalai- nagar, when Dr. C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer was Vice-Chancellor of the University. The invitation was accepted and thereafter arrangements for the Conference were taken o’n hand. A Reception Committee with Shri T. M. Narayanaswami Pillai, Vice-Chancellor, as Chairman was constituted. The Committee of Local Secretaries included Prof. R. Ramanujachari, Prof. L. P. KR. Ramanathan Chettiar, Dr. C. S. Venkateswaran and Dr. A. Chidambaranathan Chettiar. Prof. R. Ramanujachari was appointed Convener of the Committee of Secretaries. Several meetings of the Committee of Local Secretaries were held to discuss arrangements regarding — (1) the raising and collection of Funds; (2) the enlisting of new life-members and ordinary mem- bers ; (3) the boarding and lodging of members; (4) the holding of exhibitions; (5) entertainments and excursions; (6) Reception and transport; (7) decorations; and (8) Volunteers, as well as other matters for successfully con- ducting the Conference. Invitations to participate in the proceedings of the Conference were sent to individuals and institutions as well as State Govern- ments. All the members who attended the last few sessions were also contacted. All the Universities in India, and also the Univer- sities of Rangoon, Ceylon and Malaya were requested to send dele- gates. One of the novel features of the XVIII Session seems to be the invitation to all the foreign embassies and legations in India to depute representatives to participate in the Conference. The Local Secretaries record with deep satisfaction the ready response from the scholars in the field of Oriental Studies; and are glad to note that the record member of members has been enlisted for thr 11 Session. Three bulletins containing information about the XVIII Session, for the use of previous and prospective .members were issued (Appendix 1). For the benefit of* members who were ex- pected from all over India, a table of Railway Timings to Chidam- baram from Madras and Trichy and also important trains arriving and leaving Madras for Bangalore, Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi, was prepared and copies sent along with the bulletins. • A programme of variety entertainment was also arranged for all the three* days of the session. The main items c/f the programme included — (a) music by Prof. M. M. Dandapani Desikar and party; (b) concert pageant by Artistes of the Saraswathi Gana Nilayam (Madras) and others, guided by Prof. P. Sam- murthy; and (c) dance recital by Kumaris Vanamala and Malathi. On the eve of the session the Committee of Local Secretaries issued for the use and guidance of the members, a guide to Chidam- baram and other University environs, summaries of papers to be read at the Conference, a detailed programme and also badges for members. These were distributed free to all members on their arrival. Arrangements to cater to the tastes of all members were made, in the matter of food. North Indian and South Indian dishes were provided throughout. Separate accommodation for ladies and for families were also arranged. Sectional Secretaries were appointed to help the Presidents of the various sections in the conduct of the Conference (Appendix II). The Triehinopoly Station of the All-India Radio was kind enough to broadcast Radio Reports of the Session, on 26th and 27th December, 1955. The delegates were taken on excursion tours to Pondicherry and the Neyveli Lignite Project. A volunteer Corps including staff and student members was enlisted, to look after reception, accom- modation, boarding, etc., and it is very gratifying to note that they won the praise of all the delegates, for their enthusiastic service. The Committee is immensely grateful to the Government of India and the Government of Madras for their kind donations of Rs. 1,000 each towards the expenses of the Conference. The Local Secretaries are very grateful to Dr. Rajah Sir Muthiah Chettiar, Pro-Chancellor for the great personal interest he took in the successful conduct of the Session and for his valuable suggestions in planning every aspect of the arrangements of the Conference. To Sri T. M. Narayanaswamy Pillai, Vice-Chancellor, the Local Secretaries express their sincere thanks for his constant iii guidance and direction. The tremendous success of the Annamalai- nagar Session of the Conference is due entirely to the guidance and encouragement receive^ from the Pro-Chancellor and the Vice- Chancellor. The members of the staff who served on the various sub-com- mittees and the student volunteers were of great help and to them the thanks of thejcommittee of Local Secretaries is due. The Local Secretaries thank the Registrar of the University and his staff and other officers of the University for their willing and valuable help at all stages of the Conference. The Secretaries also express their thanks to Sri D. I. Jesudoss and Janab Gulam Rasool, lecturers, and Sri R. Lakshmikantan and Sri T. J. Isaac, Research Scholars for their help in going through the proofs. R. RAMANUJACIIARIAR, Convener. APPENDIX I. ALL-INDIA ORIENTAL CONFERENCE. (Registered under Act XXI of 1860).

NARAYANA- SWAMY PtLLAI, M.A., B.L., M.L.c., VICE-CHANCELLOR, ANNA M ALAI UNIVERSITY AND CHAIRMAN OF THE RECEPTION COMMITTEE. Mr. President, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of^ this University and the Reception Committee, it is my proud privilege to welcome you all to this Conference and to this city of hallowed and hoary antiquity. It was Dr. Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar, my illustrious predecessor, who invited the Con- ference to this place. It is a matter of great regret to all of us that he could not participate in this Conference. If he had been here he would have shed a lustre on this Conference all his own; but his presence at Banaras today is imperative and it looks as though we have to enact Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. Though we do not have the benelit of his inspiring guidance we have his bless- ings and good wishes. On behalf of this University and on behalf of all assembled here, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you, Sir, the President- elect of this Conference. You have conferred on us a signal honour by agreeing to preside over this Conference. You are a world- renowned teacher, philosopher, statesman and ambassador; verily you are the “liathna of Bharat,” radiating the light of knowledge and wisdom wherever you go. We are proud that only a few days ago you were invested with the insignia of the ‘‘Order of Pour Le Merit” of Germany — a rare and signal honour bestowed on great thinkers like Voltarie, Darwin and Carlyle who have changed the thinking of the world. 1 am an humble student who studied at your feet in the Intermediate class and I am sure there must be many here like me. To all those who have had the privilege of having been your students, your presence here is a source of unutterable pleasure and pride. • To you, delegates, scholars and savants hailing from all parts of this great country, I have great pleasure in offering a cordial wel- come; and to those delegates from foreign countries, whose love of oriental languages has brought them here, I am particularly grateful and offer a special welcome. All the people of this great land of ours acknowledge with grateful thanks the good and valuable work that has been done during the last thirty years and more by Oriental Scholars in India and abroad, in bringing to light the hidden trea- sures of our languages, literatures and histories; and it is their fervent hope that in free and independent India there will be still greater scope for the continuance and progress of this great work in future. I cannot think of any other kind of service which is calculated to instil i*n the minds of the youth of our country greater love and devotion to the motherland ; and such a high-souled endea- vour is a necessary corrective in these days of materialistic and utilitarian approach to the pursuit of knowledge. Here let us pay our homage to the memory of the great scholar and savant, the late 2 Dr. It. Bhandarkar, a scholar of unsurpassed eminence, who repre- sented a synthesis of the old orthodox rpethod of ensuring solidity of study with the modern scientific and critical ■ approach. His pioneering efforts h"
