        "text": "In Sri Premeshvarar Temple we sing a collection of sacred songs in Tamil at the end of the daily evening puja in front of Swamiji’s samadhi lingam. Collectively we call them, ‘Pancha Puranam’. The Pancha Puranam refers to the five sacred books called, Tevaram, Tiruvasagam, Tiruvisaippa, Tiruppallandu and Periyapuranam. In each of these books are hundreds of sacred songs that were composed by Tamil saints. We sing just one or two songs from each collection.\n\n1. Tevaram by Saint Tirugnana Sambandar\n\nPidiyaḍan Uruvumai Koḷamigu Kariyatu\n\nVaḍikodu Tanataḍi Vaḷipadum Avariḍar\n\nKaḍi Gaṇapati Vara Aruḷinan Migukoḍai\n\nVaḍivinar Payilvali Valamurai Iraiyē (x2)\n\nThe Divine Mother Uma,\n\nAssuming the form of a female elephant,\n\nAnd Lord Shiva, Lord of Valivalam,\n\nWhere live many good and charity-minded people,\n\nTaking the form of a male elephant,\n\nGraciously blessed the devotees and begat Ganapati,\n\nHe who removes the obstacles\n\nOf all those who worship the Holy Feet of Lord Shiva!\n\n2. Tevaram by Saint Appar\n\nSotrunai Vēdiyan Sōti Vānavan\n\nPotrunai Tiruntadi Porunda Kaitola (x2)\n\nKatrunai Pūtiyōr Kadalinut Pāychinum (x2)\n\nNatrunai Yāvadu Namah Shivaya-vē (x2)\n\nYou are the master of the Vedas, in the form of light.\n\nI salute your golden feet!\n\nEven if they should tie my feet to a granite stone and throw me into the sea,\n\nYour sacred mantra, Namah Shivaya, would save me from drowning!\n\n3. Tiruvasagam by Saint Manikavasagar\n\nPūsuvadum Vennīru Pūn Paduvum Pongaravan\n\nPēsuvadum Thiruvāyāl Marai Pōlum Kānaidī\n\nPūsuvadum Pēsuvadum Pūn Paduvum Kondennai\n\nĪsan Avan Evuyirkum Iyal Bānān Sālailō\n\nBehold! He besmears himself with white ash\n\nAnd adorns himself with an angry serpent;\n\nWith his sacred lips the Vedas he speaks.\n\nThese – what he smears, what he wears, what he speaks –\n\nAre the means by which he, as my Lord, reigns over me;\n\nAnd he is the essence of all that has life. Hail!\n\nLISTEN TO THE PANCHA PURANAM\n\nhttp://sripremananda.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/PANCHA-PURANAM.mp3\n\n4. Thiruvisaipa by Saint Thirumaligai Devar\n\nOllivallar Villakē Ollapilā Onrē\n\nUnarvu Sūl Kadandadōr Unarvē\n\nTellivallar Pallangkin Tiral Mani Kundrē\n\nSittatul Tittikum Tēnē\n\nAllivallar Ullathu Ānanda Kanniyē\n\nAmpallam Ādarang Kāga\n\nVellivallar Dēyva Kūthu Gandāyē\n\nThondanēn Villambumā Villambē\n\nOh, Shiva, you are the light that radiates throughout the worlds.\n\nSeeing this vast, illimitable light, my senses leave me and I enter into bliss.\n\nYour form is like a brilliant white shining mountain!\n\nContemplating on your form is like tasting the sweetest honey.\n\nSeeing your cosmic dance, my heart, withered by maya, bursts into bloom.\n\nOh Shiva! How can I tell the world of your great glory?\n\n5. Thirupallaandu by Saint Saindanar\n\nPālukku Pālagan Vēndi Alutida\n\nPāt Kadal Īnda Pirān\n\nMālukku Chakkaram Andru Arul Saidavan\n\nManniye Thilai Tanul\n\nĀlikkum Andanar Vālgindra Thilai\n\nChitram Palamē Idam Āga\n\nPālithu Nattam Payilla Vallānukkē\n\nPallāndu Kūrudumē\n\nOh Lord! When the infant, Sambandar, cried out with hunger\n\nYou brought him an ocean of milk.\n\nDrinking from this milk of wisdom, he became Jnanasambandar.\n\nOh Shiva! You who gave the chakra (disk) to Lord Vishnu\n\nThat he might destroy adharma (wickedness).\n\nSo many saints and sages praise and sing of your glory!\n\nOh Lord of the cosmic dance!\n\n6. Periya Puranam by Saint Sekilar\n\nUllagellām Unarndu Ōdat Karīyavan\n\nNilavulā -viya Nīrmalī Vēniyen\n\nAllagil Sōdiyen Ambala Tāduvān\n\nMalar Silam Badi Vālti Vanangkuvām\n\nOh Lord! You who are unfathomable and inexpressible;\n\nYou, the carrier of the crescent moon and the waters of the Ganga.\n\nYou are beauty itself, a brilliant effulgent light.\n\nOh Shiva! I prostrate at your flower-like, ankletted feet;\n\nYou, Oh Lord, the performer of the cosmic dance.\n\n7. Composed by Saint Arunagirinathar\n\nBhaktiyāl Yānunai Palagālum Patriyē Māthiru Pugal Pādi (x2)\n\nMuthanā Mārennai Peru Vālvil\n\nMuthiyē Sērvatat Karul Vāyē\n\nUthama Thānasat Guna Nēyā\n\nOpillā Māmani Girivāsā\n\nVitakā Gnānasat Dini Pādā (2x)\n\nVetri Vēl Āyuda Perumālē (2x)\n\nCountless days have I spent singing your praises with devotion!\n\nBless me and give me the wisdom that leads to liberation,\n\nThat I might see the priceless gem that is Lord Muruga,\n\nHe who lives on the mountain and leads us on the path of jnanam\n\nWho holds the victorious spear,\n\nThe weapon with which he conquered the asuras;\n\nHe who is called Vetri Vel, the victorious Lord.\n\n8. Composed by Sri Premananda Ashram\n\nGuruvē Pōtri Thiruvē Pōtri Kuraigal Tīrkum Talaivā Pōtri (2x)\n\nMaraigal Pōtrum Mādhava Pōtri (2x)\n\nMalaradi Pōtri Thiruvē Pōtri\n\nGuruvē Pōtri Thiruvē Pōtri Kuraigal Tīrkum Talaivā Pōtri\n\nI praise you oh Guru, I praise you oh God, I praise you, who solves all my problems.\n\nI praise you oh Madhava (Swamiji) who is praised by the vedas.\n\nI praise your lotus feet, I praise you oh God,\n\nI praise you oh Guru, I praise you oh God, I praise you, who solves all my problems.\n\n9. Composed by Kachiappa\n\nVān Mugil Valādu Paiga Man Valam Surakka Mannan\n\nKōnmurai Arasu Saiga Kurai Vilā Tuyirgal Vālga\n\nNān Marai Arangal Ōnga Natravam Vēlvi Malga\n\nMēnmai Kol Saiva Nīti Vilangkuga Ullagam Ellām\n\nMay the clouds shower their beneficial rains without fail,\n\nBringing fertility to the whole earth.\n\nMay the king rule justly, and may all beings live contentedly, without any problems.\n\nMay the dharma of the four Vedas flourish,\n\nMay the yajnas performed with true penance thrive in number,\n\nLet Sanatana Dharma shine its light all over the world.\n\nHara Hara Nama Pārvati Patayē\n\n(Chorus:) Hara Hara Mahādēvā!\n\nTennādudaiya Sivanē Pōtri\n\n(Chorus:) Ennātavarkum Iraivā Pōtri!\n\nSivamē Sūlga\n\n(Chorus:) Ellorum Vālga!\n\n(Chorus:) Tiruchitrambalam"
