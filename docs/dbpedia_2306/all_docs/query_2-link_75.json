Padal Petra Sthalangal\n\nThere are 278 Padal Petra Sthalams (Sung by Great Saivaite Saints (Appar, Sundarar, Gna Sambhandar & Manickavachakar) . Thevaram literally means “garland of divine songs” and refers to the collection of verses sung praising Shiva, the primary god of the Shaivite sect of Hindu religion, by three Tamil poets known as Saiva Kuruvars – Thirugnana Sambanthar, Tirunavukkarasar (aka Appar) and Sundaramoorthy Nayanar (aka Sundarar). The three are considered the primary three among the sixty three Nayanmars of the Saivite sect of Hinduism. The 278 temples that are mentioned in Thevaram are referred as Paadal Petra Thalam, meaning the temples that were sung in the verses.\n\n3.1 Bhavani Sangameshwarar Temple\n\nKNT003-Bhavani Sangameshwarar Temple, CMPM+25F, Bhavani, Tamil Nadu 638301 PPS TPS – Sangameshwarar Temple is located at Bhavani, Tamil Nadu at a distance of 15 kms from Erode and 64 kms from Salem is a Thevara Padal Petra Sthalam – Padigams Sung by Great Saivaite Saint Gna Sambhandar. Saint Arunagirinathar in his Thirupugazh praised lord Murugan of this temple.\n\nMoolavar Sri Sangamuganatheswarar/ Sri Sangameswarar; Lord Shiva in this temple is a Swayambumurthi (self-manifested) Ambal : Sri Vedhanayaki / Sri Sangameswari; Theertham (Holy water) Cauvery, Bhawani, Surya, Deva and Gayatri Theertham; Sthala Vriksham (Sacred Tree) Ilanthai (Jujuba Tree) Pathigam (Hymn) rendered by Saint Thirugnanasambanthar. The temple has a beautiful five-tiered main tower (Rajagopuram) with two corridors.\n\nThe town, the Goddess of this temple and the nearby river all have the same name – Bhavani. The temple was built at the confluence of rivers Cauvery, Bhavani and ‘Amutha Nathi’, an invisible underground water source. So the Lord Shiva here is called as Sri Sangameswarar (Sangamam meaning confluene). The temple is situated at the foothill of Padma Giri and is surrounded by four hills – Naga Giri, Veda Giri, Mangala Giri and Sanga Giri.\n\nThe temple is an ancient one, having been built by the first Pallava King, Mahendra Verman.All the three Tamil Kings- Chera, Chozha and Pandya- had done developmental work here. Mysore Kings are also major contributors.\n\nBhavani is a famous Sthalam for performing rituals to satiate one’s ancestors. Here Parikarams are also conducted for all dhoshams, including Nagadhosham. It is believed that those who take a dip at the confluence spot of rivers Cauvery and Bhavani during the Solar and Lunar Eclipse can attain moksham (salvation). It is also believed that worshiping the Amirtha Lingam in this temple can grant the boon of childbirth to couples.\n\nThe shrine of Shri Subramanya is situated in between the shrine of His parents. There is also a shrine containing Sahasralingeswarar – one lingam containing 1008 smaller lingams and worshipping this Lord, removes the ill effects of Rahu-ketu.\n\nThe Dakshinamurthy shrine is also unique- the Kallala tree behind the Lord is so short it looks more like a Tuft on the head of the Murthy Another unique feature is the presence of the 63 Nayanmars in bronze, Shri Kripananda Variar’s image is now installed as the 64th Nayanmar Another distinct feature of this temple is the three headed, three armed and three legged Jurahareswarar in a separate shrine. Praying to him relieves the patients from their diseases.\n\nIn addition to being a Shiva sthalam, this temple is well known for its Vishnu shrines within the same complex. On the western side, are the shrines of Adikesava Perumal and Soundaravalli Thayar. The Perumal Murthy is made up of Salagramas. The Lord stands with Sridevi and Bhudevi in the main shrine. In between the shrines of Swamy and Thayar, is the sannadhi of Shir Yoga Narasimhar.\n\nAs per legend, Kuberan, the lord of wealth was visiting various Shiva temples , he was astonished to see that a deer, a tiger, a cow, an elephant, a snake and a rat were drinking water without any sign of enmity.Kuberan heard a divine voice from the sky saying that he would find a Shivalingam beneath the Ilandhai tree. Kuberan worshiped the Lord and was blessed with a darshan. The tree is still there and bears a lot of fruits.\n\nAs per another legend , Sage Vishwamithrar is said to have installed another lingam on the banks of the river and worshipped it by chanting the Gayathri Mantram. Hence this lingam is called “Gayathri Lingam”\n\nAs per history, a British dignitary by the name of William Garo donated a swing / cradle (Oonjal) made of ivory after he miraculously escaped from the collapse of his Rest house in the year 1802. He felt that he was saved by the Goddess herself and became an ardent devotee after this incident. His signature can be seen on the frame of the cradle.\n\nTemple Timings are :5:30 AM to 1 PM and from 4 PM to 9: PM.; Contact Tele: (04256) – 230192\n\n3.2 Kodumudi Magudeswarar and Veeranarayana Perumal Temple\n\nKNT006 – அருள்மிகு திருபுர சுந்தரி சமேத மகுடேஸ்வரர் திருக்கோயில், 3VGQ+FJ3, Kodumudi, Tamil Nadu 638151 KNT006 – Kodumudi Temple, (Magudeswarar and Veeranarayana Perumal) is located at Kodumudi, Tamil Nadu, 90 kms from Salem and 40 kms from Namakal on the banks of the river Kaveri is a Thevara Padal Petra Sthalam – Padigams by Saints Thirugnanasambanthar, Thirunavukarasar (Appar) & Sundarar. This is a famous Sthalam for performing rituals to satiate one’s ancestors & also a Parikara Sthalam for Naga Dhosham.It is also the birthplace of the famous singer Smt K B Sundarambal where K stands for Kodumudi.\n\nMoolavar: Sri Magudeswarar / Pandi Kodumudinathar, Malai kozhundheeswarar, Magudalingar or Kodumudeeswarar.; Ambal: Sri Vadivudainayaki/ Sri Panmozhiyalammai; Shri Soundaraambigai , Tripurasundari/Madurabhashini ; Theertham Kaveri, Bharathwaja Theertham, Brahma Threertham and Deva Theertham. Sthala Vriksham : Vanni Tree . The Lord who is a Swayambumurthy was worshipped by Agasthya and his finger prints are seen on the Lingam.\n\nThere are three adjacent temples inside the same premises for Lords Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Hence it is also called Mummorthi temple All the three towers are east facing. The temple has epigraphs from the time period of King Sundarapandiyan Kesari’s rule.\n\nThough there are several Ganesas in this temple, the most important one is called Kaveri Kanda Ganesan ( One who has seen Cauveri ). Performing abhishekam to the Vinayakar with number of pots equivalent to one’s age, is considered very important in this temple. Another special Vinayaka in this temple is called Vyakrapada Vinayaka as He is having the feet of a tiger and this Murthy appears in one of the pillars! This kind of Murthy is not seen in any other temple.\n\nThe pose of Shiva Natarajar ( Kunjithapada Natarajar ) is unique in this temple- unlike other temples, both His legs are on the Peetam! As per one of the legends, Sage Bharadwaja performed penance here and pleased with his prayers the Lord appeared in the dancing posture with a grand orchestra! Hence this place is also called Bharadwaja Kshetram and there is a theertham in his name.\n\nIn the Veeranarayana Perumal shrine, the Lord is in the reclining posture ( Anantha Sayanam ) with Adiseshan offering protective hood over Him. It is a large shrine with Sridevi, Bhudevi, Brahma, Garudan, Naradar, Vasudevar, Sudarsana Chakra, Anjaneyar and Vibhishana. The Utsavs Murthi is in front of the reclining Lord. The prakaram outside the shrine contains the idols of the Azhwars, Udayavar and Paramapathanathar. There are outdoor shrines for Thirumangai Nachiyar, Anjaneya and Saneeswarar. In the Mandapam, some of the Ramayana scenes like Vishwamitra yagna, Thadagai Vadham, removal of Ahalya Shapam and Pattabhishekam are depicted.\n\nBrahma is without his consort Saraswathi in the shrine here. There is a belief that He is residing here alone as he is performing penance under the Vanni Tree ( Shami tree in Hindi ). He is having only three faces ( representing Icha, Kriya and Gnana Shakthis ) and the Vanni is considered as the fourth face of Brahma.\n\nThis vanni tree is considered ageless and is very holy. While one side of the tree is with thorns, the other side is without them. This is explained as one part Brahma and other Saraswathi. This tree does not flower or offer any fruits and only the leaves are used for all purposes. These leaves even if immersed for years in water, do not get spoiled. Devotees from this area who go for Pazhani Kavadi Yatra, put some leaves in their pot carrying the Cauvery water to Pazhani. Going around this Vanni tree for kaal, arai and muzhu mandalams ( 12, 24 and 48 days respectively ) or the age of the person or 108 times, is considered very auspicious. Special prayers and abhishekam are performed to this Brahma on Mondays. Those who are having ill effects of Shani or those born in Avittam star ( Sravishta ), get lot of benefits by praying to this Brahma.\n\nPandya Kings had excellent connections with this place and hence the place is also called Paandikodumudi. Malayadwaja Pandian prayed here to remove the problem in his son’s defective thumb. The Lord solved the problem and the Pandya Kind did lot of construction work here. The latter day additions with lot of lion sculptures, indicate the Pallava contribution\n\nThe familiar legend of the contest between Vayu and Adisesha is repeated here also. It is believed that five of the gems on the head of Adisesha fell on five different places- red stone in Tiruvannamalai, Emerald in Thirueengoimalai near Kulithalai, Blue stone in Kuttralam, Manikkam in Vatpoki ( Sivayamalai ) and the diamond in Kodumudi. Agasthyar is believed to have prayed here on his way to Pothigai Hills. Here Cauvery river takes a 90dgree turn from South to East and this turn is attributed to Sage Aasthyar whereas some other legends attribute this is to Veeranarayana Perumal who prevented the Cauvery from flooding the town by turning its direction. Apart from Cauvery which is one of the Theerthams, there are several other theerthams within the temple like Bharadwaja, Brahma and Deva Theerthams.\n\n3.3 Arthanareeswarar Temple, Tiruchengode\n\nKNT004 Padal Petra Sthalam – 9VFX+26V, Arthanareeswarar Temple,\n\nArthanareeswarar Hill Temple Road, Tiruchengode, Tamil Nadu 637211 PPS, TPS . Arthanareeswarar Temple located at Tiruchengode, Tamil Nadu , 25 kms from Erode and 50 kms from Salem is a Thevara Padal Petra Sthalam – Padigams by Saint Thirugnanasambanthar. Arunagirinathar has sung Thiruppugazh songs in praise of Lord Murugan of this temple.The temple is also the subject of a popular composition by Muttuswami Dīkshitar, Arthanāreeshwaram, set in the ragam Kumudakriya. In the ancient work Silapathikaram the place is mentioned by the name ‘Neduvelkundru’. The temple is more than 1000 years old.\n\nThis temple is located at the top of a hill, at a height of about 1900 feet and there are about 1200 steps to reach the top. You can either choose to climb the stairs or take the motorable road. Vehicles are going right up to the entrance of the temple.The hill is mainly composed of sand stone and is reddish (senniram) in colour. This is why the place is called Sencode. Another reason for the name Sencode could be that the hill is a straight formation (Senguthana malai). Other names of this hill are Nagagiri (nagam meaning snake and giri meaning malai) and Vayumalai (wind).\n\nMoolavar: Sri Arthanareeswarar / Sri Mathoru Pagar; Ambal: Sri Bagam Priyal; Theertham: Devatheertham; Sthala Vriksham:Iluppai Tree; Lord is Swayambhumurthy (self-manifested) constituted of Nava Bashanam.. The moolavar sannathi is facing the west. Lord Mahavishnu and Adiseshan are believed to have worshiped Lord here. There is no separate Ambal Sannadhi as the Moolavar is of Arthanareeswarar.\n\nThe hill itself is considered as the Lingam. In front of this hill, on the west side is the statue of a large Nandhi – seven feet in length and four feet in height.The idol of the main deity is six feet in height with the right half depicted as male and the left half as female. The male portion of the idol has jadamudi (knot of hair), thandam (baton), Silambu (anklet) and Rudraksham mala whereas the female portion has a Kazhal at the leg and Thali around the neck. Due to the androgynous nature of the idol, the deity is known as Arthanareeswarar.\n\nThe lord is also known as Madhorubagan and Ammayappan. It is claimed that this rare posture of the Lord as prime deity can only be found in this temple in the whole of Asia.This temple also has an emerald lingam “Maragatha Lingam” and a small statue of Birunki Maharishi in front of the Moolavar. Ambal worshiped this Maragatha Lingam.\n\nAs per legend, Adisheshan and Vayu fought among themselves frequently to test their superiority. During one such struggle, against Vayu’s severe wind, Adhiseshan failed to hold on to the Mount Meru. Three portions of Meru Malai came down to earth with Adisheshan’s blood strain. One such piece is this hill. Since it was believed to be red in colour due to Adisheshan’s blood strain, it is also called as sencode.\n\nAs per another legend, whenever Sage Birunki used to visit Kailash, he would take the form of a small insect and perform his worship by flying around Lord Shiva only. He would ignore the Ambal even though they were both sitting together. Angered by this, Ambal cursed Sage Birunki. Lord Siva intervened and pacified Ambal by explaining to her that Ambal is inseparable from Shiva. This legend is believed to be another reason behind this unique union of Swamy and Ambal as it represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe.\n\nAs per another legend when Saint Thirugnanasambanthar visited this place he found that the people were adversely affected by “vishakaichal“ (Viral Fever) due to “vishakkatru” (hazardous pollutants in the air). He sang the “Thiruneelakanda Pathigam” to relieve the people from their suffering.\n\nOther Deities in the temple are Senkottu Velavar shrine, Mahavishnu, with his consorts Sreedevi and Poodevi, have a separate shrine here. Mahavishnu is worshiped here as Adikesava Perumal\n\n3.4 Kalyana Pasupatheswarar Temple, Karur\n\nKNT007 – Karur Aanilayappar Shiva Temple, X36H+7F2, Madavilagam, Karur, Tamil Nadu 639001 PPS, TPS Arulmigu Kalyana Pasupatheswarar Temple, located at Karur, Tamil Nadu at a distance of 85 kms from Salem and 34 kms from Namakkal is a Padal Petra Sthalam (Sung by Gnana Sambhandar) Saint Arunagirinathar has sung Tiruppugazh songs. in praise of Lord Murugan of this temple.\n\nKaruvurar Siddhar, of Karur, one of the 18 famous Siddhars of South India, has praised the Lord in his hymns “Thiruvisaippa”, which forms a part of the 9th Thirumurai. Out of jealousy, some Brahmins complained against Karuvurar Siddhar to the king that the Siddhar was following the Vama Margam – offering wine and meat to the Lord. Upon enquiry it was found this complaint was baseless and the king punished the complainants. However, unable to bear the continual harassment, he ran towards the shrine, embraced and became unified with the Lord Ahnilaiyappar. Because of his embracement, the Lingam is found in a slanting position. Inside the temple, there is a Jeeva Samathi of Karuvurar Siddhar.\n\nMoolavar: Sri Kalyana Pasupatheeswarar / Sri Ahnilaiyappar /Sri Pasupathy Nathar; Ambal: 1. Sri Soundyarya Nayaki (Vadivudaiyal) 2. Sri Alangara Nayaki; Theertham: Brahma Theertham, Thadaagai Theertham, Ambiravathi-Amaravathi River; Sthala Vriksham: Vanji. The temple is very big – its Rajagopuram 7-tiers facing East. The Moolavar Lingam is a Swayambumurthi (self-manifested).\n\nAs per legend, Lord Brahmma became proud of his position as Creator of the world. To teach him a lesson, Lord Shiva made divine cow Kamadenu come to Earth through Narada to perform penance on Him in this place, a forest of Vanji trees then. As per instructions, Kamadenu was pouring its milk on Lord in the anthill. Lord told Kamadenu that He would be worshipped as Pasupathi Nathar as the cow (Kamadenu) worshipped Him and that Kamadenu would do the creation work. Kamadenu began the job that wiped of the pride of Brahmma. Merciful Lord returned the creation job to Brahmma then and took Kamadenu with Him.\n\nAs per another legend, Emperor Musukunda, belonging to the Skanda Mahapurana period, undertook renovation of this temple. As per another legend, Eripatha Nayanar, a staunch worshipper of Lord Pasupatheesvarar, would always carry a weapon – an axe, to protect Shiva devotees. Once the king’s elephant wrenched the basket of flowers from Sivakami Andar, – a Shiva devotee and destroyed them .Sivakami Andar started crying ; Eripatha Nayanar happened to pass that way and became furious that an elephant had caused an aged Shiva devotee such distress. He hurled his powerful axe and killed it. He also killed the Mahouts since the Mohouts failed to control the elephant.\n\nOn hearing the news King Pugazh Cholan (staunch Shiva devotee) reached the spot .He requested Eripathar to kill him with his own sword as he took moral responsibility. . Moved by the King’s devotion to the Lord and fearing that he might have caused distress to the King – another Shiva devotee, Eripathar wanted to punish himself and he began to cut his own throat. Alarmed, the king grabbed the sword and stopped him. At this point ,Lord restored the elephant and Mahout back to life and intimated thatHe wanted the world to know the greatness of Eripathar\n\nAs per another legend, Vadivudaiyal who was born in a place called Appipalayam (near Karur), was devoted to Lord Pasupatheeswarar and wanted to marry him. She worshiped the Lord faithfully and her parents could not dissuade her from what they felt was a foolish dream. However,she merged with Lord and re-christened as Soundarya Nayaki.

Detilas of 18 Vaipu Sthalangal situated within a radius of 80 Kms around Salem are given here.\n\n4.1 Karapuranathar Temple, Uthamasolapuram, Salem\n\nKarapuranathar Temple,NH 47, Uthamasolapuram, Salem, Tamil Nadu 636010 VPS அருள்மிகு கரபுரநாதர் கோயில், Karapuranathar Temple is located in Uthamasolapuram, Salem, Tamil Nadu at a distance of 14 kms from Salem.

The temple is also a marriage parihar sthalam. It is more than 1000 years old. It is one of the five Shiva temples are situated on the banks of the Manimutharu where Bheema worshipped.\n\nAs per the legend Khara odumand Dushana, the brothers of Ravana performed penance here to get a vision of Lord Shiva. After many years when the lord did not appear, the brothers decided there was no point in living further and decided to burn themselves to death. As they lit the fire and were about to jump into it, Lord Shiva appeared before them. Kara worshipped him with joy and built a temple around the Swayambu moorthy and the place came to be known as Karapuram and the lord Karapuranathar.\n\nAs per another legend, a little boy called Gunaseelan once wanted to worship the Lord but the Lingam was too tall for him. After several attempts to garland the Lord, the boy was disheartened and started to weep loudly. Just at that moment a miracle happened! The Lord lowered his head to one side to allow the little boy to garland him. The boy was overjoyed and completed his worship with satisfaction. Even today, the Lord is found with his head tilted to one side and hence is also called “Mudisaithanathar”.\n\nVel paari, one of the “Seven greatest bestowers” of the last Sangam Era had two daughters Angavai and Sangavai. The Chera, Chola and Pandya kings in their desire to expand their territory, lay siege on the territories of King Paari. After a long drawn war, Paari was killed treacherously. His death left the two girls orphaned and Poet Kabilar, a bosom friend of the King took them under his care. He approached several Velir kings to accept the girls as brides for their sons, but they refused, fearing the wrath of the Moovendar (Chera, Chola & Pandya). Kabilar handed over the girls to a brahmin in Thirukoilur and fasted to death. The place where he fasted to death is called Kabilar Kundru and can be seen till date in Thirukoilur. The brahmin thought the only person who could solve this problem and get the girls married was Poet Avvaiyaar and brought the girls to her.\n\nAvvaiyaar approached Deiveegan and Yenadhi Kannan, the sons of Malayaman Thirumudi Kaari to marry Angavai and Sangavai. The young princes agreed to marry the girls provided the Moovendhars did not have an objection. Avvaiyaar came to Karapuram and worshipped Lord Ganesha and asked him to assist in convincing the Moovendhar. Lord Ganesha who is found in the name of “Vinai Theertha Vinayagar ” in this temple wrote the marriage invitation on a palm leaf and invited the kings. The Moovendhars promised to provide consent if Avvaiyaar was able to make fresh leaves sprout from a dried palm tree at the temple. Avvaiyaar sang hyms in praise of Lord Karapuranathar and with his grace, the tree bore not just new leaves but also fruits.\n\nThe Moovendars happily consented to the wedding and Kanjamalai Karadi Siddhar who worshipped Karapuranathar in the form of a bear was the witness to this agreement. The Jeeva Samadhi of Karadi Siddhar is found in this temple. Boys and Girls seeking good marriage alliance come to this temple with three garlands – One for Lord Karapuranathar, One for Goddess Perianayagi and the third for Avvaiyaar, preferably on the date their birth star occurs during the month. After performing archana to the God and Goddess, the garland that adorned the Lord in case of a girl and the Goddess in case of a boy is given to them. They wear the garland and go around the temple carrying coconut, flowers and a garland for Avvaiyaar. They garland Avvaiyaar,break the coconut and make sincere prayers for an early marriage. Soon the alliance is fixed, and they come back to offer new saree and the first invitation to Avvaiyaar.\n\nSeveral marriages thus fixed also take place in this temple. Many love marriages happen here, as this is the temple where Angavai and Sangavai had overcome several obstacles to find a good groom. The temple actually has a notice board which gives the list of documents that are required to register a marriage\n\nThe statues of all the 3 Tamil kings – Chera, Chola and Pandyan are placed at the entrance of the temple.There is also a staue of the great Tamil poet Avvaiyar.

A single Prakaram houses all the shrines and the sanctum sanctorum. The Prakaram is beautifully paved and cleanly maintained. The temple has been renovated in recent times.

He spent his meagre income on oil and wicks.\n\nLord Shiva decided to test his devotion. One day his grass was not sold and he did not have enough money to buy oil and wick to light the lamps. He used his locks of hair as wick in the lamp and lighted it. Extremely pleased with the supreme devotion of Kanampullar, Shiva gave darshan to him and he became one with God.

Please See my blog Kshetradanam – Map of Vaipu Sthalangal for more information.\n\nThe people of this region worked as middle men or agents in the ancient era. Mugavar is the term in Tamizh for agents. So the place came to be known as Mugavanur which derived later on as Moganur. Another reason is that Lord Shiva wanted to see the reincarnation of Lord Vishnu as a woman i.e. Mohini, here in this location. So Mohanur.\n\nOnce all the heavenly devas went in search of Lord Shiva accompanied by Ganga. But he was alone there. So they started their search for Ganga and went to Lord Muruga. He too started to search her. Searching her, they reached Madurai where Madurai Meenakshi directed them towards north near Cauvery. Lord Muruga came to Cauvery, yet didn’t find her. So He went on a severe meditation on her. Ambal appeared in front of him. She was so over-whelmed by his motherly love and hugged him. Since the mother-son love between them was found here, the place was called Maganur. Magan means son in Tamil. Maganur later derived as Mohanur\n\nMoolavar : Lord Achaladeepeshwarar, Kumareeswarar; Urchavar : Chandrasekara, Somskanda; Ambal: Madhukaraveni.Sthala Vriksham : Vilvam; Theertham : Cauvery.

One Kumarayee, a staunch Lord Shivadevotee was selling curd for her livelihood. After sales, she used to offer the remaining curd to LordShiva as nivedhana and consumed it then. She became pregnant and delivered a handsome malechild. People in the village suspected her chastity and spoke ill of her. Kumarayee simply told them Lord Shiva knew her purity. While bathing in Cauvery, she merged in theriver. Mother Ambica came from the river and granted darshan to all and made it known to all that she was the curd seller woman. The shrine for Ambica was built then. As Ambica lived here as Kumarayee, she also bears that name and so Lord Shiva came to be called as Kumareeswarar\n\nA major feature of the temple – is very much within the Achaladeepeshwarar’s sanctum sanctorum. There is oxygen in here, there is air, but there is no wind. So, the diya or the lamp lighted in here does not flutter or move at all! Its perfectly still – so the name Ashala Deepeswarar.\n\nA special prayer here in this temple, is Mouna Viratham. That is essentially a silence prayer. To stay in this temple for a few days and be silent throughout and offering that silence itself to the Lord is considered a very special prayer. This offering is especially for child bearing issues. This offering is further extended by cooking along with the maintenance of the silence and performing Annadanam (food offering to general public).\n\nThe other deities in the temple are : Chandran, Sooriyan, Dakshinamurthy, Kannimoola Ganapathy, Raghu (with his wife), Kedhu, Kaala Bhairavar, Chandikesar, Navagraha, Ayyanar, Sarabeshwarar, and 63 Saivaite Saints.
