A large stone Sthupam (Lamp Pillar) is present in front of the temple, as in most of the Kongu Nadu Shiva temples.\n\nHistory of the Temple\n\nThis is an ancient temple and believed to have been built in the 9th Century CE.\n\nThe temple is now maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and is declared as a National Heritage Monument.\n\nLegend\n\nThe temple has an interesting legend. Proud of his prowess gained through rigorous penance, demon king Soorapadman tortured the Celestial Gods (Devars) and imprisoned them. Fearing for their lives, the disturbed Devars approached Lord Shiva to seek his help. Lord Shiva sent Lord Murugan with a large number of soldiers headed by lieutenant, Veerabhahu to destroy Soorapadman and his associates. After a fierce battle, Lord Murugan destroyed the demon and relieved the Devars.\n\nIt is believed that Lord Murugan got Brahamahathi Dosham due to the killing of the demon king Soorapadman and others in the battle. This battle was referred to as “Surasamharam”.\n\nTo seek respite from this dosham, Lord Murugan installed a lingam at this place and worshipped it. Since this lingam was installed by Lord Murugan, it was given the name “Thirumuruganathaswamy”.\n\nIt is believed that while coming to worship Lord Shiva, Lord Murugan left his divine spear (Vel) and his mount peacock outside the temple. Because of this, Lord Murugan’s idol inside the shrine does not have the Vel and the peacock with him.\n\nIt is believed that the Brahmmahati (the sin accrued by the killing of a Brahmin) that left Murugan is now in form of a square stone under a neem tree near the temple.\n\nVisited on: November 1, 2015\n\nLocation\n\nKarur is very well connected by road from other major cities. Karur has a Railway station on Trichy - Erode route. Around 80 kms from Trichy and 65 kms from Erode.

This temple is facing the East.\n\nThe Moolavar Lingam in the temple is a Swayambumurthi (self-manifested).\n\nThis temple is renowned for its three splendours - Moorthy (The Presiding Deity), Sthalam (Place of divinity) and Theertham (The Holy Water).\n\nLord Brahma is believed to be the first ever devotee to worship Lord Shiva in this temple.\n\nIt is also believed that the divine bovine–goddess Kamadenu has worshipped Lord Shiva here. Its hoof mark is visible on the Lingam. The name Ahnilaiyappar is derived from “Ah” meaning cow (Kamadenu) and “nilai” meaning place.\n\nThis is the birth place of Eripatha Nayanar, one of the 63 Nayanmars.\n\nKing Pugazh Cholan, who later became a Nayanar (one of the 63 Nayanmars) also belongs to this place.\n\nKarur has the reputation of being the birthplace of Karuvurar Siddhar, (also called Karuvur Devar), one of the 18 famous Siddhars of South India. Karuvurar Siddhar has praised the Lord in his hymns “Thiruvisaippa”, which forms a part of the 9th Thirumurai. This Siddhar’s life forms an important part of this temple’s legacy. The story goes that some Brahmins complained against Karuvurar Siddhar to the king that the Siddhar was following the Vama Margam - offering wine and meat to the Lord. Upon enquiry it was revealed that this complaint was baseless and the king punished the complainants. However, unable to bear the continual harassment, he ran towards the shrine, embraced and became unified with the Lord Ahnilaiyappar. Because of his embracement, the Lingam is found in a slanting position. Inside the temple, there is a Jeeva Samathi of Karuvurar Siddhar.\n\nVisited on: 2nd November, 2015\n\nLocation\n\nBhavani is 16 kms away from Erode and about 55 kms away from Selam.

Hence, this place gets the name Koodalur (confluence).\n\nA hunter king by the name of Venjaman, who ruled this place is said to have worshipped Lord Shiva here. Hence this place is also called Venjamaakoodal.\n\nThe temple was washed away by severe floods in the river Kudakanaru. It was rebuilt in the year 1982. However, this temple is still 10-12 feet below the road level, which shows the possible impact of the damages done during the flood.\n\nVisited on: November 1, 2015\n\nLocation\n\n40 kms from Erode and 25 kms from Karur.

There are three adjacent temples inside the same premises for Lords Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma.\n\nAll the three towers are east facing.\n\nThe temple has epigraphs from the time period of King Sundarapandiyan Kesari’s rule.\n\nLegend\n\nAccording to the legend there was a competition between Adiseshan (the serpent on whom Sri Mahavishnu rests) and Vayu (Lord of the Winds) to determine who is stronger. Lord Indiran prescribed certain rules to conduct the competition. They put Mount Meru at the centre and it was held tightly by Adiseshan, Vayu blew the wind with all his might to push Adiseshan. In the ensuing struggle, Meru’s peak (Magudam) split into 5 pieces and fell in five different places.\n\nIt is believed that the pieces came down as 5 different gem stones – Red Corel at Thiruvannamalai, Ruby (Manickam) at Rathinagiri (Thiruvatpokki), Emerald (Maragatham) at Engoimalai, Sapphire (Neelam) at Pothigaimalai and Diamond at Kodumudi. As per legend the Diamond that feel at Kodumudi became the Swayambulingam (self-manifested lingam) and the rest of the stones became hills. Since the origin of the lingam is from the Meru, the lord is called Magudeswarar.\n\nIt is also believed that Sage Agasthiyar installed and worshiped the idol of Lord Shiva and his finger prints can be seen on the deity.\n\nIt is also believed that Kodumudi is the place where Lord Shiva performed a dance for Sage Bharadwajar.\n\nIt is also said that both these sages were blessed with Lord Shiva’s wedding darshan here.\n\nVisited on: Janauary 12, 2016\n\nLocation\n\nThiruchengode is 20 kms from Erode and 35 kms from Namakkal.\n\nNearest airports are at Coimbatore and Trichy both are at a distance of about 130 kms.

You can either choose to climb the stairs or take the motorable road. Vehicles are going right up to the entrance of the temple.\n\nThe moolavar sannathi is facing the west.\n\nLord Mahavishnu and Adiseshan are believed to have worshiped this Moolavar.\n\nHistory of the Temple\n\nThis is an ancient temple and according to the inscriptions on the walls it must have been built about 2000 years ago.\n\nThe hill, that this temple is on top of, is mainly composed of sand stone and is reddish (senniram) in colour. This is why the place is called Sencode. Another reason for the name Sencode could be that the hill is a straight formation (Senguthana malai). Other names of this hill are Nagagiri (nagam meaning snake and giri meaning malai) and Vayumalai (wind).\n\nLegend\n\nAs per mythology, Adisheshan (the serpent on whom Sri Mahavishnu rests) and Vayu (lord of the winds) fought among themselves frequently to test their superiority. During one such struggle, against Vayu’s severe wind, Adhiseshan failed to hold on to the Mount Meru. Three portions of Meru Malai came down to earth with Adisheshan’s blood strain. One such piece is this hill. Since it was believed to be red in colour due to Adisheshan’s blood strain, it is also called as sencode.\n\nAn interesting fact is that this hill itself is considered as the Lingam. In front of this hill, on the west side is the statue of a large Nandhi – seven feet in length and four feet in height.\n\nThe distinctive feature of this temple is that the idol of the main deity is six feet in height with the right half depicted as male and the left half as female. The male portion of the idol has jadamudi (knot of hair), thandam (baton), Silambu (anklet) and Rudraksham mala whereas the female portion has a Kazhal at the leg and Thali around the neck. Due to the androgynous nature of the idol, the deity is known as Arthanareeswarar.\n\nVisited on: November 2, 2015\n\nLocation\n\nAbout 40 kms from Coimbatore and 10 kms from Tiruppur. Nearest airport is at Coimbatore. Nearest Railway station is at Tiruppur.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nMoolavar\n\nSri Avinasi Appar / Sri Perungkediliyappar\n\nAmbal\n\nSri Karunambikai / Sri Perungkarunai Nayaki\n\nTheertham\n\nKasi Kinaru (well), Naga Kanni Theertham, Iravata Theertham, Kashi Gangai Theertham in the form of a well\n\nSthala Vriksham (Sacred Tree)\n\nPathiri Tree\n\nPathigam (Hymn) rendered by\n\nSaint Sundararamurthy Nayanar (Sundarar)\n\nThis is one of the 276 Devara Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalams and 1st Shiva Sthalam in Kongu Nadu.\n\nThe Moolavar is Swayambumurthy (self-manifested).\n\nVinasam in Sanskrit and Tamil means perishable. Avinashi means imperishable (eternal).\n\nThe colloquial name of this temple is Karunaiyaathaal Temple.\n\nAvinashi is referred to as Dakshin Kashi (South Varanasi).\n\nThe historical name of the place is Tirupukkoliyur. Thiru meaning grace of God and Pukkoliyur meaning a place of refuge. It is said that once Devas took shelter in this temple in fear of Asuras.\n\nThe main tower (Rajagopuram) is 7-tiered and is more than 100 feet in height.\n\nThe temple is a protected monument under the Archaeological survey of India.\n\nHistory of the Temple\n\nThe temple belongs to 10th century CE. The present structure of the temple was originally built by the Kings of Chola, Hoysala and the Mysore dynasties. The main tower was first built during the period of King Sundarapandian and later reconstructed by the King of Mysore.\n\nLegend\n\nThe Lord Avinashilingeswarar enshrined in this temple is believed to be an offshoot of the one in Kashi (Varanarasi). For this reason, Avinashi is also known as Dakshin Kashi.\n\nAs per the Tamil saying “Kasiyil Vasi Avinashi”, it is believed that devotees looking to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva in Kasi-Varanasi, can do so by worshipping Lord Avinashilingeswarar in Avinashi.\n\nThe Theertham (holy water) in the “Kashi Kinaru” and the idols of Lord Avinashilingeswarar and Lord Bhairavar are said to have been brought from Kashi. Bathing in the Kashi well in this temple on new moon day (Amavasya) is considered to be auspicious.\n\nIt is said that the temple has a close relationship with the Mysore Royal family. In the early days, it was customary for the king-designate to go to Kashi, bring a Lingam from there and perform poojas in this temple before assuming power and stately responsibilities.\n\nThe legend is that Goddess Karunambikai did her penance and worshipped the lingam under the Pathiri Tree here. The Pathiri tree of this temple would blossom only during the Brahmmotsavam festival and not during other days of the year. According to this temple Sthala Puranam, this shows the devotion of the tree to Lord Shiva.\n\nAccording to scriptures, it is said Sage Vasishta worshipped in this temple to seek respite from the adverse effects of Sani Bhagwan (Planet Saturn). It is believed that he installed an idol of Sani Bhagwan in this temple. This idol is now worshiped as Anugraha Murthy.\n\nThe lord of this temple is also known as Brahmapureeswarar because it is believed that Lord Brahma worshipped here to seek atonement for his sin.\n\nLord Ram, Iravath (Lord Indran’s white elephant), Thadagai and Naga Kannigai are also believed to have worshipped Lord Shiva here."
