Thiruvasagam (Tamil: திருவாசகம், romanized:tiruvācakam, lit.'sacred sayings') is a volume of Tamil hymns composed by the ninth century Shaivite bhakti poet Manikkavasagar. It contains 51 compositions and constitutes the eighth volume of the Tirumurai, the sacred anthology of the Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta.

Legend has it that Manikkavasakar was appointed as minister by king Arimarttanar and sent to purchase 10,000 horses from horse traders[1] but spent the money building a temple in Tirupperunturai.
