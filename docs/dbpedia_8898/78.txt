Professional musician and performer, I am best known for my voice and versatility. This is seen in the multiple bands I have pioneered from the past to the present. Plan of man, formed in 1998 was the first to receive regional attention with our alternative rock sounds, melodic vocals and passionate lyrics. I helped form the Villebillies in 2001 and landed a major record deal with Universal Motown in 2006. As of October 2013 we have been signed again to Sony Music. The Villebillies are a rap/rock/country hybrid who created a cross genre sound that landed us on tours, gained radio play and nationwide attention. I currently have multiple other projects including a space age hip-hop group called Bass Drum Aliens and a newly formed rock and blues outfit known as Iron Bells, started from my solo music. The groups are part of a new label Island Earth Music which I co-founded with another member of the Villebillies. I have written songs for Warner Bros and Universal Motown as well as had songs placed in movies and tv. I am an experienced performer and lyricist, also hands on with the business.
