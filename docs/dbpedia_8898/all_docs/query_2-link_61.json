The ‘Villebillys strive to keep the sounds of the cowboy dance halls and small town dive bars of yesteryear alive and well. The duo focuses their energy on songs to which you can dance, whether they are buckle polishers, two steppers, or barnburners. We aim to deliver these sounds in a fun, laid back, and vibrant atmosphere suitable for all ages. Whatever your live entertainment needs, contact us and we’ll be happy to bring the honky-tonk to you."
