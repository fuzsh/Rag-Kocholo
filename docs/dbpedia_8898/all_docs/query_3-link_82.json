        "text": "We sat down with Sam Endicott, singer, guitarist & songwriter for the New York dance rockers, The Bravery.\n\nBS: How did you guys get into playing the disco punk, dance rock sort of thing? Did you play other genres before you found your niche?\n\nSE: John [Conway] and I moved to New York City back in 2003. We had both been in college upstate. All this electroclash scene was going on in the Lower East side back then like the DFA artists. We don’t play electroclash or anything, but we really liked what was going on. We decided to take what we were hearing there and blend it with more organic garage rock which is what we were more accustomed to playing in those days.\n\nBS: Do you feel your music is a product of that scene then to some extent?\n\nSE: I wouldn’t consider it a product of that scene so much because we weren’t necessarily adopting what was happening there. We get bored really quickly, and are always trying to do something new, so took what was happening there, twisted it around and ran with it.\n\nBS: So then who were your influences?\n\nSE: I grew up listening mostly to punk. Fugazi is my favorite band. Also, I listened to Rancid, Op. Iv., The Queers, a lot of really good punk like that in those days.\n\nBS: So after you moved to New York & started playing, how long until you got into the studio?\n\nSE: Not long at all really. We’d come up with several of our songs pretty early on and had really only been playing a few months before we got into the studio. We had already put together a lot of our album by the time our record deal came along.\n\nBS: So did they just come along and add production value?\n\nSE: Not really even.\n\nBS: Did you ever anticipate the success of that first album…hearing yourselves on television and in commercials?\n\nSE: It all happened really quickly.\n\nBS: What inspired the change over with the second album…going more organic? Do you think the success of the first album influenced the new direction in any way?\n\nSE: Not really. I don’t think we were really too influenced by the fame and television too much. Like I said, we just get bored really quickly, so when it came to writing the songs for the next album, it was mostly all written on an acoustic guitar. But we weren’t really sure what we wanted to do…whether we wanted to keep playing some of electro that we’d been playing, or whether we wanted to change entirely. I think our second album came out as a mix of both of those sounds.\n\nBS: You recently released The Sun and the Moon (Complete). Did you know from the beginning that you wanted to remix and re-release the album?\n\nSE: We did, but we got a lot of flack from the label about it. They weren’t really interested in the concept of splitting the album into a distinct Sun and Moon. Instead, for the 2007 release we focused entirely on The Sun which was more garage rock. Once we put that out though, and while we were out touring, we ended up doing The Moon on our own. Once we had it where we wanted it, we took it to the record label and when they heard it, they loved it. That is how The Sun and The Moon (Complete) came out.\n\nBS: You were talking earlier about how you essentially had your first album ready to go when the record label came along. I also have heard you were one of the first bands to really utilize MySpace. How do you feel these new avenues of distribution and promotion have played out in the music industry, and what have you done to utilize them?\n\nSE: The music industry has just changed so much. It used to be all radio and MTV. The radio isn’t as important as it used to be, and MTV hardly even plays music videos anymore. Now it’s like we have a “new radio” because it’s everywhere…online, on TV shows, in commercials. It’s not like it used to be, because the industry is embracing new music now. They want to find something new that nobody has heard before…not the “canned music” you used to hear in commercials. That really helps out.\n\nBS: With the internet, and all these new avenues for music, there’s such a saturation in the market anymore. When I was a kid, it felt like there were only about 100 bands. Now it’s impossible to keep up with. What do you do to distinguish yourself over all of the other bands out there these days?\n\nSE: Honestly, I think the cream rises to the top. It’s probably easiest for me to compare it to playing shows in New York. The New York scene is hard. There are great shows playing everywhere all of the time. People want to know why they should come to your show over any other show that night.\n\nNow that we’ve had some success, we’re trying to stick to some of the old music formulas, like putting an album out every two years.\n\nBS: You guys spend a lot of time on the road. With as hard as it is for musicians anymore, do you feel that touring is more important than ever?\n\nSE: I think that it is. We’ve been doing a series of tours for a while now. This one is 4 days on, 1 day off for about a month. Bands are really having to scramble to make money. Nobody is selling albums anymore. Live shows are something that the Internet cannot replace. You see more and more companies trying to record shows and performances, but that will never replace seeing a band live. You don’t get the full experience, the energy. I think it’s important to keep touring. Then, if the fan likes the way you perform the songs live, maybe they’ll buy the album too. Also, it gives you the chance to play with a lot of great bands.\n\nBS: You mentioned putting an album out every two years. What are your thoughts about waiting longer to release an album to ensure that it is as good as it can be. With the saturation in the market, consumers like us are starting to demand perfection on every track or they’ll just move on to the next band\n\nSE: I think it’s important to stay fresh in the fans mind because if you wait too long, there’s a chance they might just forget about you. I think the way the music industry is going that singles and EPs are going to be the way to go. You think about it, that’s the way music started out. You look at the Beatles, they put out like 11 albums in 7 years. I don’t know whether that’s a good thing or not, but I think we’re going to see a lot more singles and EPs because you can focus on a fewer songs and get a better quality to them, but stay in the public eye.\n\nBS: Coming to Derby this Year?\n\nSE: The Kentucky Derby? I’ve never been and always wanted to go. I hope to soon."
