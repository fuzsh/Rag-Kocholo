        "text": "Louisville has blossomed as a booming center for independent art, music and business.\n\nA Louisville locale that highlights this scene is Bardstown Road, an area located in the heart of the Highlands. Bardstown Road is known for its cultural diversity and local trade. The majority of the businesses along Bardstown Road, such as coffee shops, clothing stores and art galleries, are locally owned and operated businesses. Though it is only about one mile (1.6 km) long, this strip of Bardstown Road constitutes much of the city's culture and diverse lifestyle. Just a few blocks down the road is ear X-tacy, a local record store that has been a fixture in the Louisville music scene for many years.\n\nIn downtown Louisville, 21c Museum Hotel, a hotel that showcases contemporary art installations and exhibitions throughout its public spaces, and features a red penguin on its roof, is, according to The New York Times, \"an innovative concept with strong execution and prompt and enthusiastic service.\"\n\nLouisville is home to a thriving indie music scene with bands such as the widely known Love Jones, Flaw, Slint, My Morning Jacket, VHS or Beta and The Villebillies. It is also home to the post-grunge band Days of the New. This scene reaches a crescendo every July during the Forecastle Festival, a three-day music, art, and environmental activism festival taking place at the Belvedere."
