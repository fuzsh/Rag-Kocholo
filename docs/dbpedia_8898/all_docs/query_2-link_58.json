        "text": "Hailing from Louisville, Kentucky, the Villebillies are the latest in a now rich lineage of credible artists from the south. A mighty crew numbering nine in all, they stand as a testament to the binding cohesiveness of great music. Ignoring genre boundaries the Villebillies cross-pollinate country and pop, hip hop and southern whiskey rock, and what's more they're clearly having a ball doing it - as their live shows have proved attracting a diverse yet dedicated fan base.\n\nThe Villebillies are a 21st century kind of phenomenon, infusing traditional instruments and backwater blues with a fresh and contemporary musical vision. That collective vision comes from an unorthodox culmination of two bands, the original line-up of the Villebillies, and local rock band Plan of Man, who both formed over a period of time through a variety of associations, and an assembly of old childhood friends and acquaintances. They now stand together as an unbreakable posse with a desire to write songs that reflect where they come from and where they're going in life. And that they do with aplomb, writing about experiences we can all relate to: life, death, love, hate, partying one night and being broke and hung over the next day. They're irreverent, funny and capable of relating your experiences to you with a deft touch that few can lay claim to.\n\nVer mais"
