        "text": "The Villebillies have been around for 15 years, have had two major label deals, and are releasing their sixth album this week, called \"Holy Water.\" It may also be their best, which is not how these things usually work. The decline is supposed to set in by now.\n\nBut Dustin \"Tuck\" Tucker, Demi Demaree and Derek \"Child\" Monyhan have always resisted doing things the normal way. Their music, for example, remains a singular blend of hip-hop, rock, country, blues, soul and bluegrass. That's a lot of genres to throw against the wall, but they've made it work remarkably well.\n\nWith \"Holy Water,\" the release of which is being celebrated Friday night at Headliners Music Hall, the group decided to dial it back a bit and focus on a unified feel that incorporates its wealth of influences. Tucker calls it growing up.\n\n\"I've been telling people it's a grown-up version of the Villebillies, like we actually thought about this album rather than recording all of these different songs just because we could,\" he said. \"It came down to the final phase of cutting songs when it all really started to make sense. It was like, wow, we actually put a real album together instead of an album that's literally all over the place.\"\n\nâ–º YOU MAY LIKE: How musicians fight the rising tide of hate\n\nThat doesn't mean that \"Holy Water\" is without surprises. There are plenty of inspired moments, such as when \"Church Berries,\" already stacked with sonic references to classic rock and video games, suddenly breaks into a saxophone solo that has nothing to do with the rest of the song. But it somehow fits perfectly, which is the Villebillies' genius.\n\nTaking some fresh chances was actually born out of the band's latest major label deal ending. They had a development deal with Sony Entertainment, which released 2013's excellent \"Love is Kind of Crazy\" single, but Sony kept pushing for more songs that sounded the same. The Villebillies have nothing against major-label hits but weren't comfortable trying to fit into a box, and when Sony didn't renew its options there was no bad blood.\n\n\"I sent them a few songs and they weren't feeling the direction we wanted to go,\" Tucker said. \"We weren't seeing eye to eye. I'm thankful for it, but we grew past that situation, as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nFor Friday's show, the Villebillies have again assembled an insanely diverse crew of opening acts with Discount Guns, Whiskey Bent Valley Boys and Bob Anonymous. They'll also have a couple of special guests including Sonny Fishback, a Louisville-based soul singer throughout the 1960s and '70s who delivers a passionate vocal on \"You Got Me,\" another of the album's left turns.\n\n\"Child wrote that, and we all tried to sing it but it didn't sound right,\" Tucker said. \"Sonny is, I don't know, like a serious OG. He's just the coolest dude in the room and he came through and killed it.\"\n\nReporter Jeffrey Lee Puckett can be reached at (502) 582-4160 and jpuckett@courier-journal.com.\n\nVillebillies, Discount Guns, Whiskey Bent Valley Boys, Bob Anonymous\n\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Friday, Oct. 14\n\nWHERE: Headliners Music Hall, 1386 Lexington Road"
