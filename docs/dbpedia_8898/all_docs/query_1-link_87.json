        "text": "I used to be a radio DJ back in the ’80s and ’90s, focusing mostly on punk and comedy. In a way, I guess my whole life continues to focus on punk and comedy…\n\nOne of my favorite Louisville singers, Joan Shelley, just made the LA Times’ Best Albums of 2015 list.\n\nAnd Houndmouth just made David “World Cafe” Dye’s Top Ten Albums of 2015.\n\nHere are some local bands that I like, organized vaguely by genre:\n\nPUNK\n\nDebauchees, girl punk band with a nerdy bent\n\nAdventure, punk-pop with a twist of wry\n\nJulie of the Wolves, hard energetic girl punk\n\nRitchie White Orchestra, serious rockers telling stories\n\nRevenge of Ricky Williams, fast and fun, featuring Punk Rock Pam\n\nThe Workers, angry for a cause\n\nSonic Epitaph, goth-punk instrumental\n\nFOLK\n\nJoan Shelley, as mentioned in the LA Times\n\nMaiden Radio, a trio of lovely voices\n\nBonnie Prince Billy, lilting folk-punk\n\nKri & Hettie, fun and inspirational\n\nFreakwater, harmonic edgy alt-country\n\nBrigid Kaelin, upbeat accordion-playing Scot\n\nNick Peay, narrative lyrical crusader\n\nODD\n\nHowell Dawdy, fearless wit and avant garde\n\nLeopard Percussionists, rocking the elementral schools with xylophones and drums\n\nSOUL\n\nTeneia Sanders, heartache that make you smile\n\nCheyenne Marie Mize, hip-hop folky funk\n\nJoan Osborne, multi-talented experimental woman\n\nALT POP\n\nJim James, best known for fronting My Morning Jacket, but I prefer his solo stuff\n\nYou’re My Density, indie garage band funk\n\nHoundmouth, light-pop rising star\n\nWax Fang, effervescent prog rock\n\nStonewheel, acoustic pop reminiscent of R.E.M.\n\nDave Moisan, community-minded and energetic\n\nQuiet Hollers, post-hardcore garage band\n\nMatt Duncan, disco throwback\n\nKing Kong, conceptual humorous rock\n\nJAZZ\n\nSmall Time Napoleon, evolving blend of jazz and folk\n\nLucky Pineapple, eclectic mix ranging from jazz to punk\n\nROCK\n\nBroken Spurs, country rock party sound\n\nVillebillies, infectious hip-hop rock\n\nDeloreans, once described by my friend as a cross between Bowie and Iggy\n\nHere are some likely radio stations where you might hear some of these groups:\n\nWFPK, the NPR king of indie radio\n\nWNAS, broadcast from a high school for 75 years\n\nARTxFM, online station with a radio frequency forthcoming\n\nCrescent Hill Radio, all local all the time\n\nVille TV, online TV that also covers the local music scene\n\nThe blog Backseat Sandbar keeps an extensive list of local talent, venues, shops, etc.\n\nRead the blog series Dave Mattingly: The Musical\n\nMany organizations have get-togethers in December.

Wizard World is a national organization that hosts comic book conventions in various cities around the country.\n\nI like going to these, to meet the authors and artists, to shop at the various vendors who carry all sorts of memorabilia and oddities. There were toys, sculptures, knick knacks, gadgets, games, and more — over a hundred vendors.\n\nBut one of the biggest attractions for me is the costumes. I saw Mr. Freeze and Scarecrow, Batman and Catwoman, the Joker and Harley Quinn, Static Shock, Red X, Batman Beyond, Beast Boy, Deathstroke, Supergirl, Thor, Kingpin, Dr. Octopus, the Mad Hatter, Beetlejuice, a Discworld wizard, Vashta Nerada, Medusa and Jeepers Creepers, a Guy Fawkes Teletubby (that I can’t unsee), and many more.\n\nI wore two of my own costumes there — Mini-Me, and Cyborg Pirate Ninja Jesus.\n\nHere’s some coverage from a local TV station and newspaper.\n\nThere are similar conventions in Louisville, each with a different focus and run by a different group:\n\nConGlomeration is a nonprofit fan-run science fiction convention, and my personal favorite; crowds are small and friendly\n\nDerby City Comic Con is fairly new and rapidly growing, with plenty of local creators\n\nWonderFest is a special effects and model-building convention, and attracts a lot of Hollywood pros\n\nFandomFest has grown rapidly into a 30,000-ish fan convention, with a focus on celebrities\n\nLouisville Anime Weekend collects cartoon creators and fans\n\nImaginarium is a creative writing convention with top-notch programming\n\nFright Night is focused on horror films\n\nBesides enjoying the usual festivities of being among my own kind, I also held the church service on Sunday morning.\n\nMy sermon this time was based on Ghostbusters, in honor of my friend Ryan Kemp who passed away recently. The scripture I used was Luke 16:19-31, with references to Psalms 146:4, Ecclesiastes 9:5-6, Isaiah 8:19, Leviticus 19:31, Revelation 12:9, James 4:7, 1 John 4:1, Romans 8:38, Matthew 27:52, 1 Thessalonians 4:16, and Acts 24:15. The gist was that we don’t need to be afraid of no ghosts, because greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world.\n\nAs usual, I game a shout-out to various geeky ministries.\n\nHalloween is this weekend! My favorite holiday. I love the creativity and artistry that goes into costume design. I find that the costume-wearing community (often known as cosplayers, for costume play) are a friendly and enthusiastic bunch.\n\nIn the past, I’ve made a variety of my own costumes — Cap’n Crunch, Cyborg Pirate Ninja Jesus, Mini-Me, and others.\n\nSome people consider it odd that as born-again Christian like me is into Halloween and similar events. But I don’t see it as a problem at all — costumes are sometimes a part of my ministry. Science ficiton, games, costumes, technology, cartoons, and other “geeky” activities are celebrated by thousands of enthusiasts in cities all over the world. Wearing a costume sometimes opens metaphorical doors for me that would sometimes be hard to get into. It allows me to have conversations that may be hard to arrange otherwise.\n\nHere are some of the Christian geeky groups that I’m involved in:\n\nChristian Gamers Guild, focused on tabletop games such as board games, card games, and roleplaying games\n\nGame Church, focused on electronic games\n\nFans for Christ, encompassing all of fandom, from costumes to comics to games to anime (now defunct)\n\nGrave Robbers, focusing on Christian goths and punks\n\nCrossCon, focusing on information security professionals, aka “hackers”\n\nCostumers for Christ, because dressing up is fun\n\nAnd some great people / groups / media that I keep up with:\n\nGeek Preacher, a Methodist Minister from Tennessee, and all-around nerd\n\nMJ Young, gamer, author, and chaplain\n\nSteve Racer, actor, author, and cosplayer\n\nHackers for Charity, security experts who support and train Uganda street kids\n\nGeekdom House, Kyle Rudge’s outreach from his church to the geeks\n\nThe Dice Steeple podcast about board games and card games\n\nSaving the Game, a podcast about roleplaying\n\nGame Store Prophets and InnRoads Ministries, a podcast about Jesus and gaming\n\nChrist and Pop Culture, examining overlaps and conflicts\n\nStrangers and Aliens, a podcast reminding us of our true home\n\nGeek Orthodox podcast\n\nHacking Christianity, extracting truth nuggets from the Word\n\nGeeks Under Grace, uniting in differences\n\nIn a week, I’ll be preaching at Wizard World’s Louisville Comic Con. This is my first time preaching at this particular event (only in its second year here, although Wizard World has been running events in other cities for a long time).\n\nThis sermon will be Ghostbusters-themed, as a tribute to my friend Ryan Kemp.\n\nHere are some fun costumes I’ve come across over the years:\n\nMy friend Marshall Ryan Kemp (usually known simply as “Kemp”) died last week.\n\nHe was hit by a pickup truck while he was driving to the children’s hospital to entertain the kids by dressing up in his Ghostbusters costume.\n\nVolunteering his time to cheer up sick children was not at all uncommon for Kemp. He certainly devoted more time to cheering up sick children than I did. He died doing what he loved — bring smiles to others. (Actually, it was while he was driving to the hospital to do so, but you know what I’m saying.)\n\nIt made me wonder — any of us could go at any time, but what will what I’m doing at the time say about who I am? Like most people, the biggest chunk of my time is spent working or sleeping, or eating or doing chores and such, but when I’m not doing those, where does my time go? If someone were to spin a giant wheel-of-fortune to pick an activity during that time, would it land on something that I’d want to be known for?\n\nKemp’s time went into what he loved and what he believed in. Can I say the same? Or has my life become too routine?\n\nIf you knew Kemp, share your memories on the Remembering Kemp facebook group, or by using the #ForKemp hashtag on Twitter.\n\nAt the funeral, his Ghostbusters friends all came. They drove the Ecto-Mobile, and I took this picture that turned out to be unintentionally awesome. The sunlight gave the Ecto-Mobile a “spirit aura” and a sunbeam reflecting from the siren projected a “sunshine smile” on the ground. I think that Kemp would have approved.\n\nTwo of the improv comedy troupes that Kemp was involved in are performing some KempProv tributes this Saturday at The Bard’s Town.\n\nHere’s a song parody that I wrote in Kemp’s honor:\n\nIf there’s someone sad / In your neighborhood / Who you gonna call / KempProvster!\n\nIf you’re feeling bad / And you need some good / Who you gonna call / KempProvster!\n\nIf gloomy thoughts / Run around your head / Who can you call / KempProvster!\n\nIf your heart’s in knots / When you go to bed / Who you gonna call / KempProvster!\n\nIf you’re all alone / Pick up the phone / And call / KempProvster!\n\nIf your funny bone / Hasn’t fully grown / You better call / KempProvster!"
