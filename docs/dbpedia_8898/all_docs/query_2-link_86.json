        "text": "Over the holiday weekend we finally made the trip to Rocky Mountain National Park. Our good friend Amy was visiting for the weekend, thus giving us a great excuse to finally make the drive up. We started on our way around 8:30 and were at the park’s west entrance around 11. We made a quick stop at the Kawuneeche visitors center for some information and then continued on our way toward a trailhead that would take us to Adam’s Falls.\n\nBefore we could even make it to our trail, we stumbled upon a couple of Moose who were grazing right off the side of the road. This was the first time I have ever seen Moose, and it was on the top of my list of things to find for the day. I was astonished that my first goal was met so quickly and easily. Throughout the rest of the day, we only managed to see a glimpse of another Moose after that. So I guess we were a little lucky to find these two.\n\nThe hike to Adam’s Falls was a fairly simple one, measuring .3 mile each way. The only difficult part about it was the constant changing altitude, but we survived it with no problems. These waterfalls were wonderful and all of the varying colors of leaves provided the perfect backdrop. I took lots of pictures of this area, but it was very hard to capture the multiple stages of the falls and the twists and turns that lie between them as the crystal clear water winds through the rocks.\n\nAnother highlight of the trip, at least for me, was the drive on Trail Ridge Road, which is the highest paved continuous highway in the United States. This road is closed for the winter and even still has high snowpacked banks along the sides of the road that had to be cutout. I wanted to wait for this road to open before going to Rocky Mountain National Park, as it is the only way to get from one side of the park to the other. Originally I planned to spend as much time on the east side of the park as we did on the west, but by the time we got there we were hungry and ready to head back.\n\nBefore leaving the park, we did get some of our closest moments with multiple groups of Elk. At times, we were probably within twenty yards of them. The largest groups we saw were near the Sheep Lakes, where I was actually hoping to see some Big Horns, but no luck this time. However, the Elk were a pleasant surprise, as I don’t think I had seem them this close before. Plus with the backdrop of the trees and mountains I was able to get some good pictures of them.\n\nThere are many more pictures of us, the animals, and the landscape in this photo gallery.\n\nIn case you missed it the other day, my pictures from our extended weekend are up on the site. The only events I have pictures from are our afternoon at Red Rocks and the New Belgium Brewery tour. I forgot the memory card for the camera a couple of times and the internal camera memory quickly fills up. Luckily, everyone else took lots of pictures. Phil has posted his pictures on his site. Be sure to check those out!\n\nSpeaking of the New Belgium Brewery tour, I would highly recommend this tour if you are ever in Fort Collins. Or even if you are in Denver, it is worth the approximately hour drive north. They do not take reservations so I would encourage showing up early to get your name on the list. If you have to wait long, head down to old downtown Fort Collins. There are numerous brewpubs in the area. Our choice was CooperSmith’s, which had great bear and great food. After finally going on the tour, we got to choose four beers each to sample. After tasting all of our choices, Abbey and 1554 were on the top of everyone’s lists.\n\nLast night we dropped off Kim’s old company car and picked up the new one! The car that she was driving around (Mercury Sable) was nearing the end of it’s life, and instead of fixing it up they just decided to get her a new one. Obviously there were no complaints from us. They gave her the choice of a Chevrolet Equinox or some style of Buick. Obviously with the weather and mountains in Denver, the choice was easy. We went with the Equinox, which is an all wheel drive crossover SUV.\n\nThe color we picked is called Granite Gray Metallic and was the darkest shade of gray available to us. The highlights so far are the all wheel drive (although we haven’t had to use it yet), the spacious interior, and an auxiliary input jack on the stereo, which makes it very easy to hook up our Sirius receiver or an mp3 player. It drives really smoothly and has quite a bit of power. There is even a towing package on it, so now we just need some snowmobiles or a small speed boat. All of the pictures I took shortly after picking up the car can be found in the photo gallery.\n\nI promised a review of The Killers concert at Red Rocks last week, but that is going to be pretty hard for me to do. The reason? The show was canceled after only two songs! The announcement at the show was that the lead singer, Brandon Flowers, had a vocal injury. But later it was reported in the news that he was recovering from bronchitis and tried to do the show anyway. A couple of other shows have been canceled over the past few days as well, but there is a show in Vancouver tonight that appears to be going on as scheduled.\n\nPrior to The Killers “performance” the band Hot Hot Heat performed, along with another opening band, so it wasn’t a complete waste of time. Our friends Phil, Doni, Chris, and Kelly made the trip with us while taking a nice vacation from Kansas City. We had a jammed packed weekend with all of them in town, and for a full recap of the events check out Phil’s blog. I could write my own recap, but I think we would have a lot of repeat content and his is probably more entertaining anyway."
