The Villebillies have toured extensively across the U.S. as a headlining act and as an opener for many notable acts.\n\nBiography\n\nHistory\n\nThe band was formed in early 2001 through a collaboration between Demi Demaree, lead singer of the Louisville rock band Plan Of Man, and the hip hop production team of Dustin Tucker and William Young. The first demo recordings featured instrumental contributions from Demaree's Plan Of Man bandmates, Adam Goff, Ron Ping, Justin Reid, and Tim Bernauer.\n\nBy the time of their first live performance on February 16th 2002 the lineup had grown to include vocalists Derek Monyhan, Dyllan O'Daniel, and David Mouser.\n\nThe Villebillies performed as a five man vocal act until late 2004 when the group officially merged with Demaree's other band, Plan Of Man. The group began showcasing for major labels and in August 2005 Universal Motown Records signed the ten man band.\n\nThe band hired producer Toby Wright to record their debut album. Disagreements between the band and producer caused delays and late in the process the band hired Bob Ezrin to produce the final track on the album.\n\nThe Villebillies major label debut was released on September 26th 2006. The band toured in support of the record, headlining large clubs through the south and Midwest and opening for a variety of major acts ranging from hip hop stars like Nelly to country music icons like Hank Williams Jr.\n\nIn January 2007 after several months of on and off touring David Mouser decided to leave the group. His departure was sudden and unexpected but the band quickly recovered, performing shows with the remaining vocalists filling in on Mouser's parts.\n\nIn May they headed out on their first nationwide tour in support of Scratch N Sniff Radio [http://kerosenemedia.com/?p=25 Scratch 'N Sniff tour press release at kerosenemedia.com] , a nationally syndicated radio program based in San Diego, California. The bill included four other acts, (həd) p.e., Authority Zero, Mower, and Danny Diablo, all affiliated with the indie label Suburban Noize. The tour visited over thirty cities across the U.S. and received heavy radio promotion.\n\nAt the end of the Scratch N Sniff tour the band experienced a series of setbacks that started with the record labels decision not to renew their contract and the subsequent departure of the band's management. The situation was further complicated when Dyllan O'Daniel and William Young left the group to pursue other interests.\n\nAs rumors of a breakup began to circulate, the band responded by booking shows, posting a new song “Stranger” to the internet, and announcing their intention to release a new album sometime in 2008.\n\nThe band looked to put a positive spin on their situation. In a December 2007 interview vocalist Derek “Child” Monyhan stated \"We're better than ever now, because we're smaller, tighter and smarter.\". In the same article vocalist Demi Demaree hinted that the band was taking a more “rocked out” approach. [http://www.velocityweekly.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071205/VELOCITY02/712050853/-1/VELOCITY06 December 2007 band interview from Velocity Weekly] A second new single “One Shot” was released to the internet in February 2008 as an example of the bands new direction. Seven months later the band released their second album, \"From the Belly of the Beast\".\n\nMusical style\n\nThe Villebillies music is characterized by a mix of traditional live instruments and hip hop style beats and samples with layered rap verses and melodic hooks sung in a more rock and roll style. Though classified as rap rock, the music features elements of folk, country, blues, jazz, and classical styles.\n\nThe main instrumental lineup consists of drums, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass guitar, and an instant replay machine. Additional instruments that have been featured in Villebillies music include keyboard, banjo, harmonica, brass horn sections, and classical string sections.\n\nThe name\n\nThe word \"Villebillies\" \" [Vill-bill-eez] \" came from a lyric written by vocalist Derek \"Child\" Monyhan shortly after joining the group. It is a combination of the words Louisville, the band's hometown and largest urban center in Kentucky, and Hillbilly in reference to Kentucky's rural mountain culture. The name references the cross genre nature of the band's music. [http://www.musiqtone.com/interviews/major/villebilllies_032607.php Interview, explains origin and meaning of the band's name]\n\nLocal impact\n\nThe Villebillies are celebrated as one of Louisville, Kentucky's premier live acts. The band influenced a wave of experimental rap based musicians that has come to dominate Louisville's indie music scene. The Villebillies have received and been nominated for several Leo Readers Choice Awards in various categories as \"Best Hip Hop Artist/Band\" and \"Best Local Rock Band\". The group has also received local radio play on both rock and hip hop stations.\n\nThe Villebillies have been involved in various local charitable organizations and events such as Kentucky Harvest as well as hosting many benefit concerts for individuals in need.\n\nNational impact\n\nThe Villebillies found more success in the national scene as a live act than a recording artist. Store sales of their debut album have been low by major label standards and the band has been given very little mainstream radio play outside of their hometown. However, the nationally syndicated Scratch N Sniff Radio has been a strong outlet for the band and CD sales at live concerts have steadily increased from show to show.\n\nVillebillies songs have been used as background music for television programs such as MTV's Next, and ESPN's broadcast of a UofL football game in 2006.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nCompilations\n\ningles\n\n*Burnin Down The House - Album: Villebillies\n\n*Whiskey - Album: Villebillies\n\n*I 65 - Album: Nappy Roots Music Presents - The Kentucky Kolonels Volume one\n\n*Ol' Faithful - Album: Villebillies\n\n*Rolling Stone - Album: Villebillies\n\n*Greatest Moment - Album: Villebillies\n\n*Stranger - Album: From the Belly of the Beast \"to be released September 2008\"\n\n*One Shot - Album: From the Belly of the Beast \"to be released September 2008\"\n\nCollaborations\n\n*My Kentucky Home (song) [http://www.umrg.com/artist.aspx?aid=548 Universal Motown - KD artist page features \"My Kentucky Home\" single]\n\n**Artist: KD\n\n**Featuring: Demi Demaree and Derek \"Child\" Monyhan\n\n**Album: Homegrown\n\n**Record label: Universal Motown / Bluegrass Entertainment\n\n*Brother Louie (song) [http://www.kaffeinebuzz.com/musicreviews-codered-allaboard.php Review of Code Red \"All Aboard\" mentions Demi Demaree collaboration]\n\n**Artist: Code Red\n\n**Featuring: Demi Demaree\n\n**Album: All Aboard\n\n**Record label: Label X / Toucan Cove\n\nVideography\n\nRolling Stone music video\n\n*Released: 2007\n\n*Directed by: The Villebillies\n\nAwards / Nominations\n\n*2007 LEO Readers Choice Award [http://leoweekly.com/?q=node/5500 2007 Leo Readers Choice Awards results]\n\n**Winner - Best Hip Hop Artist/Band\n\n*2006 LEO Readers Choice Award [http://leoweekly.com/?q=node/3082 2006 Leo Readers Choice Awards results]\n\n**Winner - Best Original Band\n\n**Nominated - Best Hip Hop Artist/Band\n\n**Nominated - Best Local Rock Band\n\n*2005 LEO Readers Choice Award [http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Date=20051109&Category=LEO05&ArtNo=51108053&SectionCat=LEO&Template=printart 2005 Leo Readers Choice Awards results]\n\n**Winner - Best Hip Hop Artist/Band\n\n**Nominated - Best New Local Band\n\n**Nominated - Best Original Band\n\n**Nominated - Best Country Western Band\n\n**Nominated - Best Local Web Site\n\n=\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links"
