        "text": "Tantric, one of my all time favorite bands have just announced they are releasing their 5th studio album titled “37 Channels” as they sign with Pavement Entertainment. This album will definitely have you exploring their diverse range of music that satisfies all your needs. You may wonder about the title but as frontman Hugo Ferreira explains, “What goes on in my brain constantly; 37 things or channels if you will, all at once vying for my attention”. Well Hugo they may all be vying for your attention but what you do with those 37 channels is pure magic!\n\nIn addition to the many featured guests such as Shooter Jennings and members of Hinder, 3 Doors Down, Saving Abel and Uncle Kracker there is as special guest vocalist on “My Turn” that you would not believe or at least I can’t! Well it is none other than the hot Leif Garrett who spent years on my wall of my room during my teen years! As Hugo is quoted on Leif’s website: “It’s an absolute honor to have such a iconic artist such as Leif Garrett on my record. I know that his voice is cooler now than ever in my opinion. Not much more to say. I’m just honored to have him on it. Rad as shit”\n\nI had a chance to listen to the first single, “Mosquita” and it is INCREDIBLE and just KICKS ASS in every way! The single features Shooter Jennings and David “2B” Mouser (KNOXX, The Villebillies) on guest vocals. The track also features guitarists Kenny Olson (Kid Rock) and Kevin McCreery (Uncle Kracker), drummer Greg Upchurch (Puddle of Mudd, 3 Doors Down) and renowned pedal steel guitarist Gary Morse. Now that is an all star turn out for their first single. The single is currently available NOW for download on Itunes here. Just Imagine what the whole album is going to have! 37 Channels is set to release on September 17th. Instead of trying to remember when, just pre-order the album along with a shirt at http://pavemententertainment.bigcartel.com/product/tantric-37-channels-bundle-pre-order.\n\nUPDATE: We recently had a chance to interview Hugo Ferreiara and usually I transcribe our interviews, but I wanted to include the full audio for you. Hugo truly bares his soul with this new album and you can truly feel the sincerity and excitement as he talks about it and how this album is filled with so much blood, sweat and tears. I am very excited about this album. Make sure to get your pre-order in and head over to their social media sites and stay up to date so you won’t miss a thing!\n\nInterview:\n\n~ Enjoy, Marisol\n\nInformation & Links:\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/Tantric\n\nYoutube: www.youtube.com/tantricband\n\nPavement Music: www.pavementmusic.com/\n\nPre-Order album: http://pavemententertainment.bigcartel.com/product/tantric-37-channels-bundle-pre-order\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript."
