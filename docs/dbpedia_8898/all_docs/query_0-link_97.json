        "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) – The long time music store, ear X-tacy, has been a popular part of the Highlands for the past 26 years. It was just last summer, it moved to a smaller location in the Douglas Loop, but now that it's closed that worries one regular who has some music inside.\n\n\"It's like a cornerstone of Louisville music,\" said Sam Boyd, a local musician. He says he has felt at home at ear X-tacy for years and living in Louisville he knew that's where he needed to be.\n\n\"Tantric, Villebillies, Nappy Roots, My Morning Jacket, they all started out with ear X-tacy,\" said Boyd.\n\nLast year one Boyd's close friends, Josh McKenzie, a singer songwriter, passed away. To help keep his voice alive Boyd would sell his cd's at ear X-tacy, collecting a portion of the profit to give to his family. Since the store closed so suddenly, Boyd is not sure what that means.\n\n\"I've emailed them with no reply,\" said Boyd. \"You call and there is no voicemail it just rings and you don't know if you are going to get your money or your product back and I'm sure I'm not the only one that has cd's there.\"\n\nJohn Timmons, ear X-tacy's president, put out a statement on Monday that said the store is definitely closed for good. He thanked the people of Louisville for years of good music. While Boyd says it's a store that will truly be missed, he just wants his friend's albums back.\n\n\"Josh's music has touched so many people,\" said Boyd. \"I don't want his album to go in some warehouse with the rest of their stock. I would rather give it away to people than to just let it disappear with all the product.\"\n\nBoyd says Monday night he received an email from the event coordinator at ear X-tacy, Jaxon Swain. In the email it stated that he will keep them posted on how the situation unfolds and he said he hopes to know more this week.\n\nCopyright 2011 WAVE News. All rights reserved."
