        "text": "The Tunesmiths are a local band who try to keep things as transparent as possible - I mean their band practices are open to the public on a weekly basis out at The Tim Faulkner Gallery. They also have collaborated and always supported fellow local musicians, something we find very admirable. They’ll be at Headliners this Saturday with Elephant Room and Vice Tricks in support of The Villebillies Home Coming.\n\nWe chatted with the band about some of the finer things, including what Thanksgiving delicacy each one most relates to. Oh yeah, and also their new album, their fav local bands and what 2016 has in store.\n\nLive Music Lou: The Villebillies show has a lot of buzz because, it is, well, The Villebillies. How did you guys get on the bill? What do you plan on bringing/adding to the evening?\n\nBryce Gill of The Tunesmiths: Verity from Vice Tricks recommended us for the show. We've been friends with some of The Villebillies for quite some time, so they said yes! We're bringing our Full Time Hustle Band and some very special guest performers.\n\nLML: You've got a new EP out. What is novel about this release? What is quintessential The Tunesmiths?\n\nBG: We started off as a soul band, then shifted to a harder \"garage rock & soul\" sound around 2010 with the replacement of our lead guitarist. 138 shows and 4 albums later we're a more straightforward rock n' roll band, leaving behind many of the blues influences that you can already hear around the local music scene. Our newest release Full Time Hustle showcases our new, bigger sound and represents our strict work ethic to reach that goal; It's both our mantra and our message to all musicians. It's been our mission to be the tightest and most impactful band in Louisville, all while advocating active, sincere support for all musicians, artists, venues and music organizations. That is the quintessential Tunesmiths, and FTH is a direct reflection of our efforts.\n\n(BUY IT HERE)\n\nLML: We know you have big time connections throughout the city’s music scene and have collaborated with all kinds of folks. What Louisville bands are you into right now? And who would you like to work with (for the first time, or again!)?\n\nBG: We try to keep up with all the active bands around town. Right now the whole band is really into Nellie Pearl and 1200. We collaborate with them frequently and you'll see some (if not all) of The Tunesmiths every show of theirs. They both have such an incredible drive to create and perform.\n\nNellie Pearl's upcoming record Lonesome No More (out Feb 2016) is one of the best albums we've ever heard. Their progression as a band is one of the most exciting things to witness as a fan. If you asked us who would be the group to blow up and become worldwide famous, it'd be Nellie Pearl. Their style of music is beautiful, inventive and goes over well in any audience.\n\n1200 will someday have a banner and a statue in this town. No one works as hard as them. No one breaks down as many demographic walls through music. No one puts more effort into performances and collaborations. Hip Hop is alive and well in Louisville and 1200 is at the spearhead of the movement. Most importantly, their genre-spanning music gives a positive message promoting education, non-violence and more cross-cultural solutions.\n\nSome other favorites are The Hot Wires, The Bad Reeds, El Roostars, King Sonic, Small Time Napoleon, Hey Hey Honey, Monolith, Cheyenne Mize, Blind Tigers and Tsunami Samurai.\n\nLML: 2015 is coming to an end...the year has flown by. What is in store for the band in 2016?\n\nBG: We'll continue to host our weekly \"Wednesday Night It's On\" open rehearsals at Tim Faulkner Gallery. That's been going on for 3 years now. Other than that we're going to release a series of singles, collaborating with some of our favorite musicians and studios.\n\nSide note: It does look like they’re closing 2015 with some great shows lined up!\n\nLML: Just for fun…with Thanksgiving right around the corner, describe each band member in terms of which dish they most relate to.\n\nBG: Callis is bacon. Our bodies are 78% water. His remaining 22% is bacon.\n\nDaniel is turkey. He's the center of attention and he likes naps.\n\nJason is hot cheetos. We've never seen him eat anything else.\n\nBryce is a vegetarian....we don't really know what that is yet. Do they celebrate Thanksgiving?\n\nIt’s gonna be an exciting night for The Villebillies and we’re pretty confident that The Tunesmiths will get things going from the start.\n\nNeed a preview of the stuff they’ll be bringing to Headliner’s Saturday? Check out this video of their recent WFPK Live Lunch set. It’s rad."
