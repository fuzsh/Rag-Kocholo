        "text": "(Chorus) If the whiskey don′t kill me, I don't know what will you can catch me in the city, catch me in the hills catch me rolling down the river, smokin′ on a swisher picture perfect as the winner and gone off the liquor.\n\n(Child) Early in the morning when the sun is in the east I awaken shakin', lokin for a drink, impatient cant wait to stay bent, alcohol veins means equal stasis lay waste to a shot and chase it, mmm tasty, make haste get crazy vacate pain no strike will phase me, hey ladies, woops oopsy daisy buzzin' like a bumble, start some trouble, trippin on a beer and stumble oh dear who put that there, no fear man I′m not scared low gear, step it up a notch, vodka, bourbon, gin and scotch. Liquor store, reserve spot. Pull right up in the parking lot. If its dark or not, I′m a get it started. Drink like a madman not half-hearted.\n\n(Tuck) Dirty, dirty that's whats up, villebillie boys and we give no f&@#$ boy we keep it crunk, off the wall, half us smell like alcohol all I really wanna do is get my buzz, losing my self up in the suds I don′t even know who you though we was keep the good brew and keep the good bud\n\n(Demi) Rollin Rollin Down that river of bourbon nursin barely hurtin Just fell down in my big black boots and im swerving tied up in the curtains, laid out, must have flew the coop woke up no loot, no three piece suit no smoke no juice no hundred proof ain't a nan nada dude that couldn′t recoop\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(2-B) Is it of drastic need I speak classically or with a bounce and a glide while I'm ridin the beat or with some heat like this you just can′t impeach when the villebillie vibes stuck head to feet Oh, I think you should let yourself go fo sho and buy another drink n boogie on down some more, with all the thongs on the floor, one of em down to roll another drink and a glance and she's down to go Uh oh here we go again blowin it up and gettin dirty as a mud puddle off in the cut if your feelin this beat then get your hands up, if your a&# is a freak then why is your pants up\n\n(Dylan) How the hell'd you get that bottle, they dont sell that no mo I must be an alcoholic, hey that′s part of my show the rest I just can′t call it, get off me dog I'm walking at least I think I am, it could be all them xanies talking hey where′s them chickens squawkin', did ya′ll find my pimp hat I gotta bottle of that rossi a limp and a cane to go with that. In fact they love me they can't, get enough of me they chant it′s ville the billies taken over this land\n\n(Chorus)\n\nWriter(s): The Villebillies, W. Young<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
