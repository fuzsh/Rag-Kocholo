        "text": "Heard this song driving to Cincinnati on Monday and I don't know who it is, can't find it on google. It's a rap song, but it's actually pretty cool. It talks about living in the country, they keep referring to \"my old kentucky home\", and the catchy chorus keeps referring to something like \"I got my shotgun, fishing pole, and liquor\". Anybody heard of this? I can only assume that it was Nappy Roots but I can't find it anywhere. I figured somebody on this board would be into it due to the chorus.\n\nCool, thanks man, exactly what I'm looking for. Found it on bluegrasssent.com via the villebillies.com site:\n\nThe song, \"My Kentucky Home\" by KD, features Demi of the Villebillies, Scales of Nappy Roots, and Goodfella is on \"Home Grown\", KD's newest CD. Find it at www.bluegrassent.com.\n\nThe VilleBillies are pretty cool too, you can listen to their songs by going to their website."
