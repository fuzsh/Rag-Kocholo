        "text": "VilleBillies\n\nAppetite for Dysfunction\n\nIsland Earth Music\n\nProduced by: VilleBillies\n\nIf there ever were a need to record an album that glorifies the art of southern-urban-suburban living in good ole’ Louisville, Kentucky coupled with mass consumption of various chemical substances, then this would be that album.\n\nOn their 3rd album (the first being Universal Motown Records), the VilleBillies continue perfecting their original sound of recording boozy, beat-laden, twangy, honest hip-hop music straight from their heart and minds. And they definitely didn’t forget to work on elevating their other nostalgic trait: Louisville-celebrity-living-ness. Or something to that effect.\n\nAppetite for Dysfunction’s first single and track No. 4 “Talk to Me,” a dark, yet catchy tune was released on Youtube in November 2010. Yep, 2010.\n\nOther killer tracks is the twangy-wangy guitar rock n’ roll jam “Pure to the Grain,” and the smooth beats and groove laid on “Rear View.” There’s also the eerie piano & guitar playing on “Pride Aside,” which is candidly humble lyrically speaking. The harmonica and banjo makes its first appearance on “O’Death,” a song that has a backwoods, porch-stomping, celtic feel to it. “Just Yesterday” is something that resembles a ballad, something that hasn’t been a VB regularity, but you’d never know it after listening to it.\n\nClosing out in style, they end with a Weird Al-like parody of “Talk To Me,” dubbed “Tuck to Me” where the lyrics are virtually dumb, sometimes redundant and non-fitting to the rhythm. The VilleBillies. Essentially fucking around while still recording their album and making fun of their own antics. Imagine that. Surprising, I know.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. Midnight\n\n2. Pure to the Grain\n\n3. Worth the Fight\n\n4. Talk to Me\n\n5. Rear View\n\n6. Rocket Queen\n\n7. Alive\n\n8. Side Show\n\n9. Pride Aside\n\n10. The Biz\n\n11. Same Ol’ People\n\n12. O’Death\n\n13. So Goes the Scarecrow\n\n14. Movin On\n\n15. Just Yesterday\n\n16. Tuck to Me\n\n** This review will also soon be published on LouisvilleKY.com"
