        "text": "Want to know who is coming up in the next few weeks? Did you miss an episode? Have no fear! Take a look at our Live Lunch archives and upcoming schedule.\n\nWFPK's Live Lunch is sponsored this week by the University of Louisville, where the campus is open to the community to experience concerts, plays, art exhibits, lectures, tours, family events and more. Information about public events is available at events.louisville.edu.\n\nJoining us for Live Lunch this week at the UofL's Red Barn is the Louisville rap/rock/hip-hop group Villebillies. The group began in the early 2000's when a crew of loosely related musicians and MC’s began to collaborate, and named themselves the Villebillies, an ironic nod to their hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. By playing shows and handing out demos, the Villebillies quickly became a local sensation. The Villebillies signature sound features a well choreographed vocal style with hard hitting rap verses, infectious hooks and soulful harmonies. Marked with beats drawn from a distinctive blend of urban and roots music, each of the three front men (Demi Demaree, Dustin “Tuck” Tucker and Derek “Child” Monyhan) bring their own technique and personality to every track. Never confined to one genre or topic, each song reflects a different experience within the greater context of the Villebillies’ story. Their long awaited new album\"Holy Water\" will be available on Oct.14th as well!\n\nMore information: Official Site | Twitter | Facebook| Instagram\n\nAbout Live Lunch\n\nWFPK hosts Live Lunch every Friday at noon.
