        "text": "Music will be in the air above the Village Green again most Sunday evenings this summer.\n\nAfter a year off because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and public-health efforts to slow its spread, the city’s Music on the Green series returns starting June 6. Kyle Eldridge and his rockabilly, old-school country sound will take over the northwest quadrant of the Green.\n\nLongtime Worthington resident Rob Mottice is back to organize the concert series, scheduling acts and handling logistics weekly.\n\n“The Concert Series has undergone some fundamental changes in recent years and attendance had been way up prior to COVID, 600-1000 per week,” he said.\n\n“We’re hoping to get it back up as safety allows.”\n\nMottice has made it a goal to bring variety and high quality to the offerings, presenting a broad spectrum of live music to the community.\n\n“It had gotten to be a bit stagnant, stale,” he said. “Now it’s become a destination gig for musicians,” with groups reaching out to him for a chance to perform.\n\nOne highlight of this year’s schedule, which is starting a few weeks later than usual, is the Bobby Floyd Trio, featuring the Grammy-nominated jazz pianist, on Aug. 8.\n\n“I’m trying to put us at a higher level, raise the bar,” said Mottice.\n\nPart of that experience is creating an expectation that the audience, while respectful of performers and fellow concertgoers, can have a good time. That might mean some dancing, some picnics, some quiet conversations among friends.\n\nIt’s all about enjoying live music in a family-friendly setting, this year with the caveat that people will self-regulate when it comes to safe practices regarding COVID-19.\n\nMasks and proper social distancing will be important, and to help with the latter Mottice is investigating options for wireless speakers in different areas of the Village Green to allow for people to spread out farther while still enjoying the music.\n\nThe public certainly has responded well to the evolution of the series. Earlier this year, the city of Worthington conducted a March Madness bracket-style competition among its many Parks & Recreation programs and the Concert Series was voted champion, beating out the Olentangy Parkland Bike Trail.\n\nLongtime fans of the series will notice that a few of the larger, traditional ensembles won’t be participating this summer, including the ever-popular Ohio State University alumni band.\n\nMany larger groups have not been able to rehearse during the pandemic and are on hiatus from performing.\n\nThe remainder of the schedule is as follows, with all concerts running 7-8:30 p.m. Sunday evenings:\n\nJune 13 – Ladies of Longford, Irish, back by popular demand;\n\nJune 20 – Hadden Sayers Band, world-class blues;\n\nJune 27 – Hot Tonic, calypso/jazz;\n\nJuly 4 – No concert, Happy Independence Day;\n\nJuly 11 – Worthington Civic Band;\n\nJuly 18 – Donna Mogavero Band, singer-songwriter;\n\nJuly 25 – Yachtopia, Yacht Rock Revue;\n\nAug. 1 – The Deeptones, funk-soul dance with a smoking horn section;\n\nAug. 8 – Bobby Floyd Trio, jazz from the Grammy-nominated piano player; and"
