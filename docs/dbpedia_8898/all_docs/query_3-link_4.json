        "text": "After the Villebillies lost their major-label contract with Universal Motown Records in 2008, the band did what it always does: It went to work.\n\nLong one of Louisville's most consistently creative hip-hop bands, the Villebillies dug in and continued to produce music and videos. Dustin \"Tuck\" Tucker kept in touch with the people who had signed the band to Universal, most of whom had moved over to Sony Music Entertainment, feeding them songs and videos.\n\nIn the music business, that normally gets you a polite reply — at best. This time, it earned the band a deal with Sony.\n\nOn Monday, the Villebillies and Sony Music Entertainment finalized a five-album deal, and Sony will immediately release the band's latest song, \"Spooky,\" as a single. In addition, Island Earth Music — a record label owned by Tucker, Villebillie Demi Demaree, producer BJ Young and videographer Shaun Wilson — has been given a production deal and an additional five-album option dedicated to Earth Island Music artists.\n\n\"I can't even believe it,\" Tucker said. \"We're like a cat. We've got nine lives.\"\n\nIt was a slow-motion whirlwind courtship.\n\nTucker said that he would only occasionally send tracks to Sony, just keeping the band's name out there, and would often not get a response for weeks. Sometimes he went a couple of years without talking to anyone there. But on Sept. 30 he sent them \"Spooky,\" which is based on a sample of Dusty Springfield's 1970 single of the same name.\n\nThirty minutes later, he had a response. Tucker promised to send them Wilson's video for the song a few days later, on Oct. 3. An hour after he sent the video, Sony called with a Villebillies offer. An hour after that, it added the Island Earth production deal.\n\n\"That's a damn good day,\" Tucker said, laughing.\n\nAfter its two years with Universal Motown ended in 2008, Tucker said that the band focused on building its local audience and expanding Island Earth Music, which has a roster of the Villebillies, Elephant Room, Josh Wood, Bass Drum Aliens and Iron Bells.\n\n\"Honestly, I had accepted the fact that the Villebillies were going to be local,\" said Tucker, a founding member, \"and just when I started doing it for fun, it happened to us again.\"\n\nThe Villebillies will start working on a new album for release next year, and continue to develop Island Earth's other artists. \"They still can't grasp it,\" Tucker said of the label's younger artists. \"This is the opportunity they've worked for, and now they have to put up or shut up.\"\n\nThe Villebillies know a little about that. \"We have been though everything,\" Tucker said. \"Whatever they can throw at us, we've been through it.\"\n\nJeffrey Lee Puckett can be reached at (502) 582-4160, jpuckett@courier-journal.com and on Twitter, @JLeePuckett."
