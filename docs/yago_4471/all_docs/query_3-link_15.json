        "text": "After being engaged once before, Princess Margaret eventually found love again in 1958. Princess Margaret's husband was Antony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer, and most importantly, a commoner. Their marriage was historic for many reasons, although their 18-year marriage was littered with infidelity. From their secret engagement to their eventual deaths, here is everything you need to know about Princess Margaret and husband Antony Armstrong-Jones's relationship.\n\nPrincess Margaret wed photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1960.\n\nThe couple welcomed two children together: Viscount David Linley and Lady Sarah.\n\nBoth the princess and Antony participated in extramarital affairs throughout their marriage, leading to their eventual divorce in 1978.\n\nWhile Antony remarried (and then divorced), the couple remained close until Princess Margaret's passing in 2002.\n\n1957: Photographing the Queen\n\nAntony Armstrong-Jones was first introduced to the Royal Family when he was commissioned to take portraits of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and their children at Buckingham Palace. The following year, the photographer first met Princess Margaret at a dinner party thrown by the princess's lady-in-waiting, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish.\n\n1958: A Secret Romance\n\nHowever, their romance wouldn't officially ignite until later in 1958, when Antony was hired to photograph Princess Margaret. \"I enjoyed his company very much, but I didn’t take a lot of notice of him because I thought he was queer,\" the young royal later admitted to biographer Christopher Warwick. Their courtship was kept under wraps, however, and the princess would secretly visit him at his studio. \"Yes, he would join her at parties, but no one could pinpoint which man she was interested in,\" said author Anne de Courcy. The press focused more on the ones who were seen to be eligible. They didn't think of Tony who was often in the background.\"\n\nBut their relationship wasn't the only thing Antony tried to keep secret. Reports say the photographer was unfaithful during their courtship, specifically with Jacqueline Chan and model Gina Ward.\n\nOctober 1959: Late-Night Proposal\n\nWhile the couple wouldn't announce their engagement until months later, Antony reportedly proposed to the princess the same day she learned that her former fiancé, Captain Peter Townsend, was getting remarried. The royal eventually told parliament member Jonathan Aitken, \"I received a letter from Peter in the morning and that evening I decided to marry Tony. I didn't really want to marry at all. Why did I? Because he asked me! Really, though, he was such a nice person in those days. In a way he introduced me to a new world.\"\n\nFebruary 27, 1960: A Royal Engagement\n\nPrincess Margaret and Antony's engagement wasn't made public until February 27, 1960. Designed by her future husband, Princess Margaret's flower-shaped engagement ring featured a ruby surrounded by diamonds.\n\nMay 6, 1960: A Historic Royal Wedding\n\nTheir May 6, 1960 wedding was historic in more ways than one.

Held at Westminister Abbey, Princess Margaret's brother-in-law, Prince Philip, escorted her down the aisle as her father, King George VI had passed away eight years prior. Following the wedding, Antony was given the titled Earl of Snowdon and Princess Margaret became the Countess of Snowdon.\n\nMay 28, 1960: One of Many Affairs\n\nWhile the newlyweds were honeymooning, the Earl fathered a secret daughter, Polly Fry. His relation to the child wasn't revealed until 2008, however, when a DNA test confirmed his paternity following years of rumors.\n\nNovember 3, 1961: Viscount David Linley Is Born\n\nIn 1961 the married couple welcomed their first child together, a son named Viscount David Linley, 2nd Earl of Snowdon.\n\nMay 1, 1964: Lady Sarah Is Born\n\nIn 1964, Princess Margaret and husband Antony welcomed their second child, a daughter named Lady Sarah Frances Elizabeth Armstrong-Jones (now Chatto).\n\n1966: More Affairs\n\nJust like the beginning of their relationship, their marriage wasn't without infidelity. While Antony was the first to be unfaithful (his work as a photographer brought him on long trips abroad), Princess Margaret had affairs of her own. Her first extramarital relationship occurred in 1966 with Antony Barton—a wine producer and Lady Sarah's godfather—while her husband was away in India. She also mingled with Robin Douglas-Home and others that were never confirmed.\n\nSeptember 1973: A New Relationship\n\nIn 1973, Princess Margaret embarked on her most significant affair. The princess began a relationship with gardener Roddy Llewellyn—17 years her younger—after meeting at a house party. The relationship would go on to last eight years.\n\nMarch 19, 1976: The Couple Separates\n\nWhile the princess was in a relationship with Llewellyn, she announced her separation from Antony on March 19, 1976. Buckingham Palace said at the time, \"HRH The Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and the Earl of Snowdon have mutually agreed to live apart. The Princess will carry out her public duties and functions unaccompanied by Lord Snowdon. There are no plans for divorce proceedings.\"\n\n1978: Officially Divorced\n\nIn 1978, Princess Margaret and Antony's divorce was finalized.\n\nDecember 15, 1978: A New Marriage for Snowdon\n\nNot long after the divorce, Antony married film production assistant Lucy Lindsay-Hogg. The couple would eventually give birth to a daughter in 1979. However, Antony and Lindsay-Hogg divorced in 2000 after it was revealed that the Earl fathered another child out of wedlock in 1998.\n\nOctober 8, 1993: Reuniting for Their Son\n\nPrincess Margaret and Antony attended their son Viscount Linley's wedding to Serena Stanhope on October 8, 1993. Even after the divorce, the couple remained close.\n\nJuly 14, 1994: Another Wedding Reunion\n\nThe exes reunited yet again for their daughter Lady Sarah's wedding to Daniel Chatto. The royal wedding was held on July 14, 1994, in London.\n\nFebruary 9, 2002: Princess Margaret Passes Away\n\nPrincess Margaret passed away peacefully on February 9, 2002.\n\nJanuary 13, 2017: Antony Passes Away\n\nBuckingham Palace confirmed that Princess Margaret's ex-husband Antony passed away on January 13, 2017, at the age of 86."
