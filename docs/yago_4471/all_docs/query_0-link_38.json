        "text": "Glittering with diamonds and steeped in a century of royal history, there is so much to love about the Khedive of Egypt Tiara. It is now a prized possession of the defunct Greek royal family, who remain in mourning following the death of the former King Constantine II, but its story starts more than a century ago, in a country hundreds of miles away.\n\nRead More\n\nRevealed: the intriguing family ties between the late King Constantine II of Greece and Europe’s monarchies\n\nThe last King of Greece had family ties to Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Norway and Britain\n\nThe diadem – high set and featuring laurel spirals, each supporting a floating gem encircled by a matching diamond garland formation – was commissioned from Cartier by Abbas II, the last Khedive (an Ottoman viceroy) of Egypt, at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIt was a gift; an acknowledgement of a love affair that was sparked in Cairo, under his supervision. The two lovers at the centre of the romance were Princess Margaret of Connaught – the elder daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, third son of Queen Victoria, and his wife Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia – and Prince Gustaf Adolf, grandson of the Swedish King Oscar II and the future King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden.\n\nAn eligible match by any measure, Princess Margaret set off from home in 1905 as part of a royal tour, ostensibly appraising the marriage potential of a number of European princes. However, it was not until the tour party had travelled across Europe and arrived in Egypt that she finally met her perfect match: Prince Gustaf Adolf.\n\nRead More\n\nRevealed: the two subtle ways Queen Anne-Marie of Greece referenced her wedding day at husband Constantine II’s funeral\n\nThe grieving queen paid tribute to the 1964 ceremony\n\nIt was love at first sight. The couple were engaged within weeks of their January meeting and married at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in June. Upon returning to her husband’s home in Sweden, Margaret took an active role in the community and learned to speak the language. The couple welcomed five children: Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, who predeceased his father; Sigvard Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg; Ingrid, the future Queen of Denmark; Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland; and Carl Johan Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg.\n\nThe couple, who became Crown Prince and Princess on the coronation of King Gustaf V in 1907, are described as having a happy marriage; a match based on love. However the happy union was brought to an abrupt end in 1920, when Margaret died from sepsis, aged just 38.\n\nRead More\n\nSale of Princess Margaret’s wedding tiara reportedly left Lord Snowdon heartbroken\n\nLord Snowdon, who died in 2017, was reportedly ‘crushed’ by his children’s decision to auction 800 items their late mother owned\n\nPrince Gustaf Adolf went on to marry Lady Louise Mountbatten, the maternal aunt of the Duke of Edinburgh, but the Khedive of Egypt Tiara was kept within Margaret’s family, being passed down to her only daughter, Princess Ingrid, who went on to marry Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark (later King Frederick IX). Frederick and Ingrid welcomed three daughters, all of whom honoured the romantic tradition by wearing the diadem on their wedding days, including Margrethe, the current Queen of Denmark.\n\nHowever, it was Ingrid’s youngest daughter, Anne-Marie, who inherited the tiara. She became the last Queen of Greece upon her marriage to the late King Constantine II, who died last month, although the monarchy was later abolished. When their eldest daughter, Alexia, wed in 1999, she once again selected the Khedive of Egypt Tiara; bringing it into the spotlight once more."
