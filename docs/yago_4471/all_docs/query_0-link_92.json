Now see if you can figure where the defense went wrong .\n\nWest opened the queen of clubs. East played the seven and South ducked. He didn't fear that a second club would be ruffed; he had no play at all for the 13 tricks and wanted to establish a squeeze or pseudopressure in case squeeze hearts didn't break. Now came the defensive blunder. West continued by leading the jack of clubs .\n\nThere was no reason not to lead the eight spot or to shift diamond or a trump, but to a West just wasn't thinking ahead. So he led the jack of clubs. South won, drew trumps with two leads, cashed dummy's of diamonds, came to his ace with a third trump, ruffhand ed his jack of diamonds, led dummy's last last trump, trump over- to took, cashed his discard dummy's last club and East had discarded the noted with delight that 10 of clubs on the next to last trump the king on the last one to and establish South's nine spot as winner.
