Photo Source: Pinterest/Fiona Maddow.\n\nShortly after her older sister Princess Marie-Astrid had announced her engagement to an Austrian archduke, Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg got engaged to Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein, third son of Prince Franz Josef II and Princess Gina. The engagement was announced by the cabinet office of the Principality on 8th December 1981.\n\nPrincess Margaretha and Prince Nikolaus had basically known each other for most of their lives as their parents had been friends for many years and the Grand Ducal Family had regularly spent their skiing holidays in the alpine principality, though it took them a hunt and the wedding festivities of then Hereditary Grand Duke Henri to get well acquainted and fall in love."
