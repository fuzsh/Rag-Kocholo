        "text": "What if fairy tales are rooted in truth? Often, when something is so far-fetched or unbelievably perfect, we accuse it of being a fairy tale. So why not? When I began historical research for my time travel retelling of Snow White, I stumbled across a startling tidbit of information—the Grimm Brothers might not have made up the story of Snow White. Here is some of the surprising research I gathered before writing my novel (sources are included).\n\nSnow White\n\nMargaretha von Waldeck was a German countess born in 1533. Local records state that she was an exceptional beauty. (1.) She was named after her mother, Margareta, who died when she was only four years old. (2.) Her father, Philip IV remarried Katherina von Hatzfeld. Apparently, their new mother was not very fond of Philip's children and sent many of them off to live with relatives. When Margaretha was 16, she went to live with her uncle Johann Cirksena in Brussels at the Valkenburg Castle. (3.) As she was presented in court, she caught the eye of three high standing nobles, including Prince Philip II of Spain who fell hopelessly in love with her. The King of Spain did NOT approve of the match, as he expected his son to marry for the gain of the kingdom. An alleged assassin was hired, and Margaretha slowly fell into a serious illness at the age of 21. Many of her friends commented that they believed Margaretha had been poisoned by degrees. Her last will and testament was written in a shaky hand, convincing historians that her death was indeed from unnatural causes.\n\nDwarves\n\nFunctioning copper mines scattered the area surrounding Margaretha's home, most of which were operated with child labor and owned by Margaretha's brother. Work conditions were horrible, and the hard labor often stunted the growth of the children so they never grew to full height, dwarfing them. (5.) It is supposed that the mine gasses also grayed their hair prematurely. The workers lived in small cottages that often housed up to thirty occupants at a time.\n\nThe Magic Mirror\n\nIn a neighboring kingdom of Lohr, was another princess, Maria Sophia Margaretha Catherina von Erthal. There is often some debate between the castles of Lohr and Waldeck about who was the true inspiration for the Snow White tale. I think it is likely the Grimm brothers drew from multiple fantastical stories from the area to compile into their fairy tale. After Maria's mother died and her father remarried, a large looking glass was given to her step-mother as a gift. The mirror still stands in the Lohr Schloss where tourists are told of the connection to the Snow White fairy tale. (6.) The high-quality glassworks of the area were known to be so clear that they \"only spoke the truth\" and contained little aphorisms in the upper left corner meant to inspire self-love.\n\nPoisoned Apples\n\nThere are records of a man in the village of Wildungen who became fed up with local thieves and began handing out poisoned apples to the children he suspected were stealing from him. (7.) The man was later arrested and his crime became well known in the area.\n\nThese were just some of the real-life historical elements that I found while researching for my novel, Shattered Snow. The main thing that inspired me was how the Grimm brothers weren't satisfied with Margaretha's sad tale, and immortalized her happily ever after with a new ending. It inspired me to write an alternative history of my own.\n\nShattered Snow is a time-travel retelling of Snow White, based on the real-life history of Margaretha von Waldeck.\n\n\"Charming, addictive, and sets the bar for all fairytale retellings.\" -Readers' Favorite Five Star Read\n\n\"A beautiful reimagining filled with engaging new characters and fresh new ideas. Literary escapism achieved!\" -Brian Crosby, Creative Director of Marvel Themed Entertainment.\n\nA magic mirror could change her destiny.\n\nMargaretha von Waldeck is a young German countess who desires nothing more than to honor her father and live up to her step-mother's expectations. But, when she discovers a mysterious mirror in the woods that transforms her world into shadows and ice, her future shatters.\n\nKeltson Grammar is a time traveling vigilante who doesn’t mind breaking a few international laws. Hiding behind mirrors, he rescues unfortunate souls in the past and leads them to happier endings. When he sends his newest assistant to save a young countess from being poisoned, a single misstep sets a huntsman on his trail.\n\nIf Keltson is discovered, Margaretha's story will be reset to its original dismal fate, and Keltson’s future will end permanently behind bars.\n\n★2019 Swoony Award Winner: Best Fairytale Retelling Romance★2019 Whitney Award Finalist: YA Speculative Fiction★Deep Magic Ezine highlighted novel, Fall 2019\n\nSources:\n\n1.
