        "text": "Princess Margaretha didn’t wear a tiara, she wore a traditional Swedish nuptial crown called a brudkrona from Gärdslösa Church where she was married. I’m not Swedish so this is just want I’ve gleaned from the internet but apparently the church or parish owns the crown and it is lent to all of the brides that get married in that church. There are nuptial crown traditions in other countries and cultures but I really like the Swedish one because they are owned by the church and can be used by any bride as opposed to the ones that are owned by royal and noble families. It just seems very Swedish to me. This is Princess Margaretha wearing the crown from Gärdslösa Church.\n\nAnd here are a few others\n\nTäby Church in Uppland\n\nBoxholm in Östergötland\n\nSaint Olaf’s Chapel in Närke\n\nMalmbäck Church in Jönköping\n\nBacken Church in Västerbotten\n\nRättvik Church in Dalarna"
