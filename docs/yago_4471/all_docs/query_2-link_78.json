        "text": "By:Charles Switzer\n\nJan. 24 2024, Published 7:36 p.m. ET\n\nKing Frederik X of Denmark and his wife, Queen Mary, acceded to their positions on January 14, when Queen Margrethe II abdicated, but his alleged affair with Genoveva Casanova is making headlines again.\n\n\"I love marriage, my wife, our children, and the whole happy base that arises for the people who manage to stay together and persevere,\" His Majesty claims in the new book he co-authored with Jens Andersen titled The King's Word.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe tome has already become a bestseller in Denmark, and in addition to candid details about his marriage to the former Mary Donaldson of Sydney, Australia, the book also explores his often fraught relationship with his father, the late Prince Henrik, who died in 2018.\n\n\"As previously mentioned, my father was very patriarchal, and he tried to pass that pattern on to his two sons,\" the King wrote. \"Here, however, I have learned a lot from having a wife who, from time to time, reminds me that of course I am not always right, and that my words are not automatically believed, just because I am the man of the house.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIn November 2023 when the scandal broke, Queen Margrethe II's press office released a short and simple statement to the publication B.T. in Denmark, which reads, \"[Danish royals] do not comment on rumors or insinuations.\"\n\nNeither the then-heir to the Danish throne nor his wife commented on the allegations leveled against them and the claim that he stepped out of the royal marriage.\n\n\"I categorically deny the statements that suggest a romantic relationship between Prince Frederick and me,\" Casanova shared on her Instagram when denying she had an affair with the future king. \"Any statement of this type not only completely lacks the truth but also misrepresents the facts in a malicious manner,\" she continued. \"This is already in the hands of my lawyers, who will take care of the pertinent steps to protect my right to honor, truth, and privacy.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe crown prince and crown princess married in a lavish wedding in 2004 after a four-year romance. The future king of the Scandinavian nation first met Mary, an Australian advertising executive, during the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Their desire to wed received the blessing of Denmark's monarch and Frederik's mother, Queen Margrethe II, in 2003.\n\nThe pair went on to have four children together, Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nThe bombshell news originally surfaced amid the state visit of Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to Denmark that same month, with a Spanish gossip magazine, Hola, publishing the report of Frederik's alleged romance with Casanova.\n\nDespite the swirling rumors, the soon-to-be King and Queen of Denmark did not let any possible frustrations show as they were photographed with the Spanish monarch and his consort. They also maintained a loving and supportive bond in front of cameras during their Christmas travel arrangements.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nGBN reported on excerpts from The King's Word."
