She is born 1957 in Luxembourg (as the twin sister of Prince Jean) and married Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein (born 1947) in March 1982. Her husband is the brother of Hans Adam II of Liechtenstein. Princess Margaretha's sister Princess Marie-Astrid married Carl-Christian from Austria and her (Marie-Astrid's) children are Archdukes and Archduchess of Austria.\n\nPrincess Margaretha's children have the title of Liechtenstein\n\nI have found two links for you that should interest you:\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/henrivanoene/genliechtenstein.htm\n\nhttp://www.btinternet.com/~allan_raymond/Liechtenstein_Royal_Family.htm\n\nHere are the wedding photos of March 1982: Aren't they gorgeous?\n\nAttachments\n\nwedding1982 1.jpg\n\nwedding 1982 2.jpg\n\nwedding 1982 3.jpg\n\nwedding 1982 4.jpg\n\nwedding 1982 5.jpg\n\nwedding 1982 6.jpg\n\nLast edited: Nov 23, 2005\n\nMarengo\n\nAdministrator\n\nJoined\n\nAug 13, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n27,637\n\nCity\n\nSão Paulo\n\nCountry\n\nBrazil\n\nAfter the death of her first child Margaretha grew very close to her aunt Queen Fabiola, who supported her a lot. Does the family still live in Brussels? Nicolaus is still Liechtensteins ambassador to the EU?\n\nNice pictures btw! Margaretha is wearing her mothers wedding tiara during her own wedding. I believe it was a gift from the belgian Congo to their Princess Josephine-Charlotte.\n\nLast edited: Jul 12, 2012\n\nMarengo\n\nAdministrator\n\nJoined\n\nAug 13, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n27,637\n\nCity\n\nSão Paulo\n\nCountry\n\nBrazil\n\nthanks Drimal ^__^ i didn't know Austria was still a monarchy...are any of the above Royals the next heir to the throne\n\nAustria isn t a monarchy anymore (since 1918) but that does not mean that her imperial family has died out, on the contrary, it blossomed! In my eyes it is the 'best' royal family of europe, with decent, hard working, discrete etc. members & I think that the Austrians werent to clever to kick emperor Karl out of the country (or empress Zita for that matter, she was just wonderfull).\n\nsuturegeisha\n\nCourtier\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 16, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n788\n\nCity\n\nFort Mill\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nMarengo said:\n\nNo, I am sorry.

Astrid is a Skandinavian name meaning the rider of God\n\nPrince Josef-Emanuel (born 20th May 1993) also has a difficult name. Josef is Hebrew and means God gives propagation. Emanuel is also Hebrew and means God with us.\n\nLast edited: Nov 23, 2005\n\ndrimal\n\nNobility\n\nJoined\n\nMay 7, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n460\n\nCity\n\nBelvaux\n\nCountry\n\nLuxembourg\n\nPart II The 1994 photos!\n\nAll this photos were shot on a photo series of 2.July 1994.\n\n1.
