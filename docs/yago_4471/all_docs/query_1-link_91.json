        "text": "Yes, Kate Middleton, England’s soon-to-be princess, has yet to visit the colonial shores of Manhattan for trousseau shopping. But no worries: another princess arrived in Manhattan this week.\n\nMarianne Bernadotte, the 86-year-old widow of Prince Sigvard Bernadotte of Sweden, stayed at the Mandarin Oriental with her well-packed 200-year-old royal family jewels to host an event for the Museum of Art and Design, where she is a member of the museum’s global leadership council. She is a young-looking 86, her skin nearly devoid of wrinkles, her hair colored a honey blond and her voice almost girlish.\n\nAs she held court from an office at the Mandarin Oriental before Monday night’s event, she shared what pleasures Manhattan can bring to a princess. She first arrived here with her husband in 1964 when he worked on design for the World’s Fair. Back then, they lived at the St. Regis for two months. She has returned many times for charitable events. She chatted eagerly about her memories. And while her publicist encouraged a reporter to call her princess, she stressed it was not necessary to use such titles.\n\n“I never call myself princess,” she said. “But the people who know the circumstances call me that.”\n\nThe circumstances: Ms. Bernadotte was an actress working at the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm when she met the prince, who had been in a battle with his family over his title because he previously married two commoners. His consolation was to be given the title of Count Bernadotte of Wisborg. In 1961, he married her — then Marianne Lindberg, also a commoner — and she became his countess.\n\nHe asked her to give up her acting career “because I would like to have dinner with you.” She obliged by studying art history at the University of Stockholm and, like most people who take jobs that carry responsibilities before titles, settled into her still royal role of fund-raising.\n\nHer charitable work and royal relations led her to cross paths over the years with Diana, Princess of Wales. Their husbands were distant relatives, and Prince Bernadotte was a great-grandson of Queen Victoria. They once stayed at the Carlyle at the same time while visiting New York; crowds gathered outside to see Diana, who was, the princess recalled, “a person that everyone liked immediately.”\n\nShe does not expect to be invited to Kate Middleton’s wedding to Prince William next spring and does not recall ever meeting Diana’s sons.\n\nThat leads inevitably to the delicate question of royals marrying commoners like Ms. Middleton. Her grandniece the Crown Princess Victoria married a commoner in June. She described it as a grand wedding that produced memorable blisters on her feet from walking in high heels. But she praises any royals trying to find true love. She understands how hard it was for her husband. Her own wedding was a modest affair that took place on a summer day.\n\n“The most important thing was that we were married for 40 years.”\n\nHer plans for this week’s short visit included having breakfast with a lady in waiting to the former Empress Farah Pahlavi of Iran and tea with her relative Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia while he showed her his latest jewelry designs.\n\nShe said, “It’s a nice life I’ve had.”"
