The oldest child of Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, and Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, she was born a Princess of Sweden and Norway (just Sweden after 1905) and became the elder sister of Queen Astrid of Belgium, Crown Princess Martha of Norway (all three being the inspiration for the popular Swedish ‘Princess’ cake), and Prince Carl Bernadotte. In 1919, she married a cousin, Prince Axel of Denmark, with people remarking that ‘the couple were so much in love that they could not be left alone in a furnished room.’ They had two sons and resided on the Bernstorffshøj estate in Gentofte. After the tragic early deaths of her sister, Princess Margaretha became a great support for her Belgian and Norwegian nieces and nephews, which include King Baudouin and King Albert II of Belgium, Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte of Luxembourg, and King Harald V of Norway, who knew her as ‘Tante Ta’. She represented the Danish Royal Family at a plethora of events, including the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and from the 1960s, often going back to Sweden, as members of the Swedish Royal Family dwindled, and she became one of the few female attendees at the annual Nobel Prize Ceremonies. Princess Margaretha passed away in Denmark in 1977.\n\nFloral Tiara | Turquoise Star Tiara | Boucheron Pearl Circle Tiara | Khedive of Egypt Tiara | Pearl Poiré Tiara | Diamond Floral Brooch\n\nFloral Tiara\n\nTurquoise Star Tiara\n\nBoucheron Pearl Circle Tiara\n\nKhedive of Egypt Tiara\n\nPearl Poiré Tiara\n\nDiamond Floral Brooch\n\nShare this:"
