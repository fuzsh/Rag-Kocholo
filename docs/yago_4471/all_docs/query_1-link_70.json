        "text": "Update, 6/30/23: Princess Madeleine and her family have delayed their move until 2024. \"It is simply that the time for the family with all that a move entails, it has been a little too short,\" Margareta Thorgen, Director of the Swedish Royal Family’s Information and Press Department, told Expressen. Below, see the original story.\n\nSweden's Princess Madeleine is returning home. Along with her husband, Christopher O'Neill, and their three children, Princess Leonore, Prince Nicolas, and Princess Adrienne, the family will move to Stockholm from their current home in Florida. She was one of many royals living in America, including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Japan's former princess Mako.\n\n\"Princess Madeleine and Mr Christopher O'Neill have decided that their family shall relocate to Sweden indefinitely,\" the Swedish Royal Court said in a statement Tuesday. \"Princess Leonore and Prince Nicolas will begin elementary school in Stockholm in the autumn. Princess Adrienne will start preschool.\"\n\nPrincess Madeleine, Princess Adrienne, Princess Leonore, Prince Nicolas, and Christopher O’Neill in 2021.\n\nThe court added, \"the family will take up permanent residence in an apartment at the Royal Stables in Stockholm.\"\n\nThe Royal Stables are located in central Stockholm, and will be a definite shift from the private life the family has enjoyed for much of the past decade. In 2015, she and O'Neill moved to London, and in 2018, they relocated to Florida. Though they have lived abroad, they remained active members of the royal family, and often traveled back to Sweden for formal events.\n\nPrincess Madeleine, far left, with the other members of the Swedish royal family for Princess Victoria’s 45th birthday celebrations.\n\nPrincess Madeleine, the youngest daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, is currently eighth in line to the Swedish throne. In 2019, her children, along with her brother Prince Carl Philip's children, were stripped of their official HRH (His or Her Royal Highness) titles, but they retained their \"Prince and Princess\" titles."
