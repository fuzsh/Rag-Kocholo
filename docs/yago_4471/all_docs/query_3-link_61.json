        "text": "She wore the intricate Habsburg Fringe tiara, the diadem of the Royal Family of Liechtenstein, which was perfectly complimented by her delicately embroidered elbow-length veil. The bride was flanked by five adorable flower girls with botanical crowns and green sashes around their middles. The groom was handsome in a camel coloured waistcoat, a vision of happiness beside his radiant bride.\n\nThis weekend’s religious ceremony followed an intimate civil ceremony that took place in June at the Villa della Tenuta di Fassia, Italy. This time, it was a tour de force of European Royalty and high-society names, with Beatrice Borromeo and Pierre Casiraghi in attendance, as well as Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg alongside her husband, Grand Duke Henri, Princess Christian of Hanover (Alessanda de Osma), Princess Mafalda of Savoy as well as German industrialist Rolf Sachs with his handsome son, Frederik.\n\nBeatrice Borromeo oozes Grace Kelly-esque glamour in head-to-toe Dior at Monaco's National Day\n\nRead More\n\nThe couple left the church in a horse-drawn carriage before a crowd of ecstatic guests as well as delighted well-wishers who had come to witness the regal scene. By virtue of marriage, Maria Anuciata is member of not one, but two, royal families as the granddaughter of the late Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg and Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium on her mother’s side.\n\nAs is the way for any serious European wedding, the day event was followed by a glittering evening reception; this time held at the magnificent Liechtenstein Garden Palace – known as the Gartenpalais – which was built by a royal Liechtenstein ancestor in the 1500s. For it, Princess Maria Anunciata let her hair down and wore the Luxembourg Vine Leaves tiara which is reportedly on loan from her maternal uncle, Grand Duke Henri. She chose to wear a floor length white gown embroidered with jewels.\n\nRead More\n\nAs she is named a Dior Haute Couture ambassador, Tatler revisits the ever-elegant style of Alessandra de Osma, the stunning wife of Prince Christian of Hanover\n\nThe beautiful Alessandra de Osma married into the ever-chic Hanoverian royal family when she wed childhood sweetheart Prince Christian of Hanover\n\nAll the guests upped the glamour for the elegantly-lit evening do, with Beatrice Borromeo wowing in a stunning backless floor length Dior gown in deep red. Mother of the bride, Princess Margaretha of Liechtenstein, did much the same in twinkly blue alongside her brother, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg. The photographs are glamour incarnate – and Hereditary Princess Cleopatra shared a next-day photograph of a famous Viennese culinary speciality, a sacher torte, which must have been given out to guests as a present following the celebrations.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMaria Anuciata and Emanuele Musini, who is in his 40s, have been together for several years and Musini is a co-founder and chairman at Pillo Health, a home health start-up, located in Boston, USA.
