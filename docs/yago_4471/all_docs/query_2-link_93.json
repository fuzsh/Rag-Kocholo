        "text": "As we approach Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark’s 54th birthday at the end of May, we take a look back at the life he’s led with his long-time wife, Crown Princess Mary, who turned 50 on February 5.\n\nNext in line to the Danish throne, Frederik met his bride at the most unlikely of places – a pub. According to People, the duo met at the Slip Inn, a bar and restaurant in Sydney. This was the start of an unconventional love story between a prince and an advertising executive from Hobart, Tasmania.\n\nHere’s what we know about their royal romance.\n\nAn unlikely meet-cute\n\nIt was the summer of 2000 and Crown Prince Frederik flew to Sydney, Australia, for the Summer Olympics. There, he was accompanied by his brother Prince Joachim, his cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark and Princess Märtha Louise of Norway. After the opening ceremony ended on September 16, the small party of royals headed to a bar at the Slip Inn where they met with Nikolaos’ cousin, King Felipe of Spain – still a prince at the time – and his own small party that included a 28-year-old Mary Donaldson.\n\nThe Australian native and the Danish prince clicked at initial conversation, which led to Donaldson giving Prince Frederik her contact number. He called the next day. “The first time we met, we shook hands,” she said, according to People. “I didn’t know he was the prince of Denmark.”\n\nA long-distance love\n\nWith the prince having to return to Denmark, the couple kept in touch through phone calls, letters and email. After months of correspondence, Donaldson visited Denmark in December 2001. The following month, Prince Frederik went public with their relationship and, later that same year, Donaldson moved to Denmark. When she arrived in Denmark, she was employed as a project consultant for Microsoft Business Solutions.\n\nIn April 2003, they received the ultimate blessing when Queen Margrethe, Prince Frederik’s mother, publicly acknowledged their relationship. Things progressed quickly afterward, with their engagement announced six months later. Donaldson said “yes” after the prince proposed in Rome with an emerald-cut diamond ring, the centre stone flanked by two emerald-cut rubies resembling the Danish flag.\n\nA royal wedding\n\nTo become a Danish royal, Donaldson had learned the language, given up her Australian citizenship and converted to the Lutheran faith. Their wedding transpired at the Copenhagen Cathedral on May 14, 2004. The bride arrived in an ivory gown by Danish designer Uffe Frank, and while it was largely unembellished, it came with a 5.8-metre (19-foot) train and a lace veil once worn by Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden. Meanwhile, the groom wore his military uniform to the ceremony.\n\nThe guest list included several European royals who were met at the doors of the cathedral by adoring fans waving both Denmark’s and Australia’s flags. After the “I dos”, the newlyweds rode to their reception at Christian VII’s Palace on Amalienborg Palace Square via a horse-drawn carriage.\n\n“The joy and the strength you give me is like the sun in the daytime which, with its radiance, melts all doubts and darkness on earth,” the prince said during his reception speech. “And like the moon at night, you shine with a watchful and delicate beam of gentleness.”\n\nMarried life\n\nSince their wedding, the royal couple have celebrated a number of milestones: their honeymoon in Africa, the undertaking of royal duties, and raising their own royal family together. They have four children: Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nThe couple currently live at Frederik VIII’s Palace and will celebrate their 18th anniversary this coming May.\n\nWant more stories like this?
