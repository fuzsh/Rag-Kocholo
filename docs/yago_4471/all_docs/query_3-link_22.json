        "text": "Princess Margaret plays a prominent role in the Netflix hit series The Crown—one that has introduced a whole new generation of fans to the tales of Queen Elizabeth's vivacious younger sister. While the show has delved into the Princess's romantic life, and her complicated relationship with her husband, Antony Armstrong-Jones, the 1st Earl of Snowdon, less had been made of her role as a mother.\n\nAside from a short scene at the end of season two, where she shares the news of her pregnancy with her sister, the Queen, and a glimpse of a family portrait in which Margaret holds her newborn daughter, Lady Sarah Chatto, while her son, David Armstrong-Jones sits on the floor, we haven't seen much of Margaret's two children in the Netflix series. Here's a look at who they are in real life.\n\nDavid Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon\n\nMargaret's first child and only son arrived on November 3, 1961. When he was born, his title was styled as Viscount Linley, and he was fifth in line to the throne, though now he occupies the 24th spot in the order of succession. When his father passed away in January of 2017, David became the 2nd Earl of Snowdon.\n\nPrincess Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon with their newborn son in 1961.\n\nPrincess Margaret's children clearly inherited their father's artistic tendencies. Known professionally as , the Queen's nephew is a well-respected furniture craftsman whose high-profile clients include Elton John and Valentino.\n\nLord Snowden, Viscount Linley, and Princess Margaret holding Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones in 1964.\n\nJust don't call him a \"designer.\" “I’m a maker, not a designer,” he told Vanity Fair in early 2017. He also serves as an honorary chairman of Christie's auction house.\n\n“I inherited my love of design from my father, the Earl of Snowdon, who was always fascinated by pushing the boundaries of an object–working out how to make it touch the ground in two places rather than three,” he told the Telegraph. “I was pretty bad at making things as a child but he was an excellent teacher.”\n\nDavid Armstrong Jones on his wedding day to Serena Stanhope in 1993.\n\nDavid married Serena Armstrong-Jones in 1993, but the couple announced that they were divorcing in 2020 after 26 years of marriage. They have two children together, Lady Margarita Armstrong-Jones and Charles Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley.\n\nMost recently, David walked behind Queen Elizabeth's coffin as the procession made its way from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall. He was also seen at her state funeral, and then on various occasions with the royal family, including on Christmas day 2023.\n\nLady Sarah Chatto\n\nPrincess Margaret's youngest child and only daughter, Lady Sarah Chatto was born on May 1, 1964. While at one point she was seventh in line to the throne, she is currently 27th. She and her brother grew up in Kensington Palace, and like David, Lady Sarah inherited her artistic instincts from her father. She is a well-established painter and currently serves as the vice-president of the Royal Ballet.\n\nSarah and her brother in July 1969.\n\nSarah and her husband Daniel Chatto have been married since 1994. They have two children together, Samuel and Arthur.\n\nOn her wedding day in 1994.\n\nWhile she keeps keeps a relatively low profile for a royal, Sarah was thought to be a favorite confidant of the Queen's, who regularly appears at family events, including weddings.\n\nSarah Chatto (far right) sitting next to the Sussexes at the Platinum Jubilee Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s.\n\nLady Sarah was at Buckingham Palace to receive the Queen's coffin, a private moment which was not shared with the public, and she attended the state funeral of the late monarch.\n\nLady Sarah Chatto attends The ’Together At Christmas’ Carol Service at Westminster Abbey."
