        "text": "King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark were in high spirits as they joined other members of the royal family to mark Princess Benedikte's 80th birthday this week.\n\nThe couple have been facing months of wild rumours and speculation about their marriage after the King was photographed on a night out in Madrid with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova at the end of last year. At the time, he faced allegations that the two were having an affair, which the palace strongly denied. Yet media reports continued to question whether all was well for the royals. Mary appeared in public a number of times on her own, while the couple appeared tense in photographs of a ski trip to Verbier.\n\nNow, it seems, King Frederik and Queen Mary are firmly putting the rumours behind them. The pair were beaming with joy as they joined other members of the royal family for an official portrait to mark Queen Margarethe's sisters milestone birthday. Positioned in the centre of the image, King Frederik and Queen Mary were relaxed as they smiled at the camera, surrounded by their fellow royals.\n\nIn the coming weeks, King Frederik and Queen Mary will also travel for their first state visit following their accession to the throne in January. The King and Queen will visit Sweden, where they will be welcomed by King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. According to official communications from the palace, the purpose of the visit is to ‘further strengthen and develop relations and cooperation in areas such as foreign, security and defence policy, and innovation and research.’\n\nRead More\n\nWho is Princess Benedikte of Denmark? The ultra-glamorous aunt of King Frederik X who loves a cool beer before bed, is a terrible cook, and has been described as ‘the most royal of all’\n\nPrincess Benedikte of Denmark, the younger sister of Queen Margrethe II, celebrated her 80th birthday this week\n\nIt will likely provide an opportunity for the couple to put on a united front, and dispel any speculation about the state of their marriage.\n\nKing Frederik met the then Mary Donaldson at a pub in Sydney during the 2000 Olympic Games. Mary was a city-based advertising executive and Frederik was the future King of Denmark, there to support the Danish sailing team. Sparks flew and after exchanging numbers – Frederik was reportedly saved in Mary’s phone as ‘Fred’ – a long-distance relationship began. In 2003 Frederik proposed with an emerald-cut diamond in a design that reportedly mirrored the Danish flag.\n\nMillions watched the couple get married in 2004 when Mary – now fluent in Danish – flit down the aisle in a classic ivory concoction by Danish designer Uffe Frank and a veil first worn by Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden, and then by her daughter Queen Ingrid of Denmark. Queen Mary was the first and only person not born into the family to wear the historic veil.\n\nTwo decades later their ascension to the throne captivated all the more attention. Audiences worldwide, from Copenhagen to Australia via Scotland, were on the edge of their seats during the ceremony. Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff cited Mary’s ‘demonstrated humility, grace and kindness’ as her superpowers. ‘I look forward to watching the next generation, and Tasmania’s own-born Queen, lead Denmark’s future.’"
