        "text": "The forbidden romance between Princess Margaret (August 1930–February 2002) and Captain Peter Wooldridge Townsend (November 1914–June 1995) was revisited in its final chapters throughout the fifth season of The Crown—though the pair's love story in real life was sadly more doomed.\n\nIn 1947, Margaret—the daughter of King George VI and the Queen Mother, and younger sister to Queen Elizabeth II—first met and fell in love with Townsend, a Royal Air Force pilot and soon-to-be divorcé 15 years her senior who served as an equerry for the king. Their resulting romance came at a time when marrying a divorcé was not only frowned upon, but also forbidden by the Church of England. And since Margaret was not yet 25 years old, she required marriage approval from her sister, the queen, who ultimately refused to give it on account of the captain's marital history.\n\nStill, Margaret's love for a time transcended royal agendas, and she continued her romance with Townsend for several more years.\n\nAhead, see the historical overview of Margaret and Townsend's tempestuous love story, from its sweet beginnings to its heartbreaking end.\n\n1947: They meet.\n\nA married Townsend meets then-teenager Margaret for the first time while accompanying the royal family on a three-month tour to South Africa. His duty was to protect the princess throughout the trip, so the two spent a lot of time together.\n\nIn later years, Margaret reportedly tells a confidante, \"We rode together every morning in that wonderful country, in marvelous weather. That's when I really fell in love with him.\"\n\nTownsend also accompanies Margaret on a trip to Belfast in October, and he requests to have his room at Hillsborough Castle moved next to hers.\n\nNovember 1952: Townsend divorces his wife.\n\nFollowing 11 years of marriage and two young boys, Townsend officially divorces his wife, Rosemary Pratt, Marchioness Camden, in order to commit to Margaret.\n\nApril 1953: Townsend proposes to Margaret.\n\nTownsend asks Margaret for her hand in marriage, but they are unable to wed due to the 1772 Royal Marriages Act, which required that Parliament approve the marriage if the woman was under the age of 25. Margaret does not receive approval from the queen.\n\nThe two still remain engaged, however, and continue their relationship in private.\n\nJune 2, 1953: Rumors of their affair emerge at the queen's coronation.\n\nDespite dating in secret for several years, rumors of their romance first circulate from their attendance at the queen's coronation, following the death of King George the previous year. As depicted in The Crown's first season, onlookers observe subtle suggestive exchanges between the two during the occasion—and per one reporter, Margaret is seen fixing up Townsend's shirt, spurring tabloid headlines speculating on the affair.\n\nAugust 21, 1955: Margaret turns 25.\n\nMargaret reaches the pivotal age of 25, making her eligible to freely choose whether—and now, whom—to marry.\n\nDue to amendments made preemptively by the queen and Parliament in the Royal Marriages Act in light of Margaret and Townsend's potential marriage, Margaret would now be exempt from the Church of England's rules prohibiting a marriage with a divorcé insofar as she is removed from the line of succession, in which she stood third behind nephew Prince Charles and niece Princess Anne.\n\n\"Exclusion from the Succession would not entail any other change in Princess Margaret's position as a member of the Royal Family,\" per Prime Minister Anthony Eden.\n\nDespite these newfound freedoms, Margaret remains apart from Townsend for two years while he's stationed abroad in Brussels to serve as an air attaché. She tells Eden in a letter that she would need to meet him face-to-face again in order to arrive at her final decision.\n\n\"It is only by seeing him in this way that I feel I can properly decide whether I can marry him or not,\" she writes.\n\nOctober 31, 1955: Margaret announces the end of her engagement with Townsend.\n\nThe princess ultimately decides to end her relationship with Townsend to maintain her place in the royal line of succession.\n\nIn an official statement released on BBC Radio, she announces, \"I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But, mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.\"\n\nTwenty-three years later, in 1978, Townsend releases his autobiography, Time and Chance, in which he expresses his ultimate peace with Margaret's decision.\n\n\"She could have married me only if she had been prepared to give up everything—her position, her prestige, her privy purse,\" he writes. \"I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.\"\n\n1959–60: They both marry other people.\n\nTownsend marries Marie-Luce Jamagne in 1959. And one year later, on May 6, Margaret marries photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, who later becomes the Earl of Snowdon. Margaret and Jones eventually divorce in 1978 due to their extramarital affairs, but maintain a friendship up until the end of Margaret's life in February 2002."
