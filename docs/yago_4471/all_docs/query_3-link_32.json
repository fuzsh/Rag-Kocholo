        "text": "Princess Maria Anunciata of Liechtenstein is celebrating her birthday this week and while it's unknown what exactly her plans are to mark the occasion, it's likely she will be celebrating with her husband, Ralph Worthington.\n\nThe second daughter of Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg and Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein, Princess Marie Astrid of Liechtenstein married her long-term in a glamorous wedding at the late-Gothic Orbetello Cathedral in Capalbio, Tuscany.\n\nPrincess Marie Astrid, 34, was every inch the head-turning bride in a white embroidered gown and the decorative 19th-century Kinsky Honeysuckle tiara, formed of glittering honeysuckle motifs in diamonds, silver and gold. Her husband, Worthington, 36, an American known as ‘Rafe’, was a handsome vision in pinstripe trousers and a green satin tie.\n\nOf course, an assembly of high-profile guests were in attendance, including Princess Alessandra and Prince Christian of Hanover, Ekaterina, Princess of Hanover and Princess Mafalda of Hesse. Maria Astrid’s sister, Princess Maria Anunciata of Liechtenstein, also looked stunning in a long peach dress with a clutch to match.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMarie Astrid’s wedding train was something to behold, thick, weighty and intricately embroidered – it took four of her well-dressed guests to artfully manoeuvre the piece into the church. The flower girls and page boys were adorable with lime coloured ribbons around their middles and flower crowns atop their heads. Princess Alsessandra of Hanover, ever elegant, clearly got the memo, with a lime green ribbon to accessorise her floral cocktail dress.\n\nThe weather was without fault – the bridal party basked in the late summer Italian sunshine. The pastor wore a golden robe that sparkled as it caught the light. The church aisle was laden with greenery and the apse of the cathedral adorned with expansive biblical frescoes.\n\nRead More\n\nAs she is named a Dior Haute Couture ambassador, Tatler revisits the ever-elegant style of Alessandra de Osma, the stunning wife of Prince Christian of Hanover\n\nThe beautiful Alessandra de Osma married into the ever-chic Hanoverian royal family when she wed childhood sweetheart Prince Christian of Hanover\n\nRalph Worthington is the son of Ralph Worthington IV, and his great-grandfather, William Morrissey (the father of his mother, Lucinda Earle Morrisey), founded Metropolitan Oil. Princess Marie Astrid is the second daughter of Princess Margaretha and Prince Nikolaus, and the older sister of Prince Josef Emanuel."
