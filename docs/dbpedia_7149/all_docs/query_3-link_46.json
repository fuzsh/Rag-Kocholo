        "text": "As the Principal of Delhi International School, I believe that inclusive education is not just a concept but a fundamental principle that shapes our approach to learning and growth. Inclusive education is about creating a nurturing and supportive environment where every student, regardless of their background, abilities, or challenges, feels valued, respected, and empowered. At Delhi International School, we strive to foster a culture of inclusivity that celebrates diversity and promotes equity. We recognize that each student is unique and brings a wealth of experiences, perspectives, and talents to our school community. Therefore, we embrace inclusive practices that ensure every learner has equal opportunities to succeed and thrive.Inclusive education goes beyond physical accessibility; it encompasses curriculum adaptations, differentiated instruction, and personalized support to meet the diverse needs of all students. It involves creating inclusive classrooms where every voice is heard, every contribution is valued, and every achievement is celebrated.We believe that inclusive education not only benefits students with disabilities or special needs but also enriches the learning experience for all students. It promotes empathy, understanding, and acceptance, preparing our students to navigate a diverse and inclusive society with compassion and respect. As we continue on our journey of inclusive education at Delhi International School, we are committed to creating an inclusive ethos that promotes learning, fosters growth, and empowers every student to reach their full potential. https://lnkd.in/gQ6uJtpU Warm regards, Shruti Sharma Delhi International School Sector-23\n\nOLD TIMES EDUCATION SYSTEM THROUGH GURUKULS: 1.Historical and Cultural Context Gurukuls: These were ancient Indian centers of learning, usually run by a guru (teacher) in a traditional, often residential setting. They were part of the Vedic education system, which focused on imparting knowledge about scriptures, philosophy, and moral values, and were typically located in secluded areas. 2. Educational Approach Gurukuls : Education in gurukuls was personalized and experiential. The focus was on holistic development, including physical, mental, and spiritual growth. The teacher-student relationship was highly individualized, and learning was often integrated with daily life and practical skills. 3.Curriculum and Subjects Gurukuls : The curriculum was centered around ancient texts, philosophy, ethics, and traditional arts. The study of scriptures, such as the Vedas and Upanishads, was central. Education was more about imparting wisdom and moral values. 4. Teaching Methods Gurukuls : Teaching was often done through oral transmission and direct interaction. Learning was experiential, with a focus on dialogue, meditation, and practical application. There was less emphasis on written exams and more on continuous assessment through interaction and demonstration. 5. Infrastructure and Environment Gurukuls : These were usually simple, self-sustaining setups, often in natural surroundings. The environment was designed to be conducive to contemplation and learning, with facilities for living and studying. 6.Teacher-Student Relationship Gurukuls : The relationship between the guru and the students was deeply personal and mentor-like. The guru was not just a teacher but also a guide and a spiritual leader.\n\nIn the education space, \"Critical Thinking\" is a buzzword. Every program offered by an education company claims to improve it. Yet, it's one of the least understood skills. So, what exactly is critical thinking? Let's first find out what it is not. - Is asking questions like \"Why is the sky blue\" critical thinking?â€“ Curiosity, but not critical thinking. - Is designing an innovative chair critical thinking? â€“ Creative, but not critical thinking. - Is solving a sudoku puzzle critical thinking? â€“ Requires logic, but isn't the same as critical thinking. The term 'critical' comes from the Greek word \"kritikos,\" meaning \"able to judge\" or \"able to discern.\" For example, when you ask why the sky is blue, you might get the answer that it's due to the scattering of sunlight. But Critical thinking begins only when you ask follow-up questions like, Why only blue light? Why does the sky scatter light, but not other objects? How does scattering work? Critical thinking is about asking these questions to seek clarity and judge the validity of explanations. Mastering this skill means you can master any subject by asking the right questions, seeking explanations, and continuing until you reach full understanding. We're happy to announce our first-ever program dedicated solely to teaching critical thinking. In collaboration with top schools like GEAR Innovative Int. school, SVIS Dwarka, Fravashi International School Nashik, Children Academy Group Mumbai, KLE group and more with leaders like Sarvesh Srinivasan, Mrs Manju Surendran, Rohan Bhat, Sheela Mallya, Nita Arora. At Open Door we aim to create a generation of thinkers who can question, evaluate, and understand the world deeply.\n\nToday I'm reflecting on my journey so far and feeling grateful for all the diverse experiences and interactions that life has given me. It feels like a full circle moment to now be the mentor that I once reached out to for guidance and opportunities. Through this journey, I've learned some valuable lessons that I'd like to share. ðŸ“°Firstly ,A Degree( any higher education degrees) are just a platform to network ,upskill and crossskill ourselves to equip us to continue in our individual Journey. It can also be used by some ,as a Source of Credibility to work in that particular field. I learned this the hard way .It has always been embedded in our minds by our society and the Indian Education system( in my case) to limit our aspirations or goals to getting a Master's degree or a PhD just for the norm. I often see many students in interviews or in their Resumes putting out a line which says \"Aspiring to do a Master's in ....\".Well Good for you ,if this aspiration is part of greater goal .A Goal or a purpose that keeps you going for a lifetime ,that gives you the satisfaction and helps you remain a productive asset to the society. The first thing I make sure to tell all those who reach out for mentorship is to conduct a self reflection and then develop a goal analysis as to where there are now ,where they want to be and what they really want to do .Gaining work experience before going ahead with higher education always helps to bring in clarity. ðŸ“° Secondly , the greatest learning happens through the process of unlearning. It's important to have an open mind to new ideas and insights while also having a background understanding. Learning from colleagues, professors, juniors, students, field staff, books, videos, or even a random stranger you meet on the train can lead to valuable insights and growth. ðŸ“° Thirdly, it's okay to not know everything. This is something I've come to appreciate about our Hopkins classrooms. There have been multiple instances where somebody raises a question and the professor of the class might not be familiar with that area . Instead of being egoistic and ðŸ¤« shushing the student (like most in schools and Colleges of India do) they refer the student to their colleagues who have expertise in that field or to resources that would help them . It's through these moments that we learn the importance of collaboration and seeking knowledge from others. ðŸ“° Finally,You will always be a Student of life /learning. No matter how many degrees or laurels or publications you have .There is always more to learn and unlearn so let the hunger for knowledge never reach satiety in our lives. I'm also grateful for the valuable experiences , mentors that have supported me along the way, including my father Biju Mathew who has always had my back despite the circumstances . I hope and pray that my journey and lessons can inspire and guide others as they navigate their own paths. #publichealth #academia #mentors\n\nOur Indian Education System Needs a CHANGE!!!!! I am deeply passionate about education and its outcome. I've been reflecting on our current Indian Education system which moulds children's aesthetic values. I have been working with kids for the past 10 years and I would strongly say there should be a change in the overall curriculum. 1. Language skills - Be it Tamil, English, Hindi, or any language to consider, are the children trained up with proper speaking, writing, or reading skills? Might be the creme' of students can do, but what about the major unseen category of students? I take international classes and Indian classes, I can see a massive difference between the way children carry forward something that is new to them and which is unknown. Fundamentals of any language are taught strongly there(foreign) which makes them explore and be creative. But in India, children are made to learn question answers which is of no use the very next year. The focus is only on mark generation, not on the growth of knowledge. I am worried about seeing students like this, and I see it daily. Educators / Teachers - Teachers should be given professional training on how to make children more effective in terms of exploration and creativity. The one termed as a backbencher could have a very different perspective on a subject than that of a first-rank holder. Appreciate his point of view. Every child starts to answer and there comes Active Learning. Socializing - Socializing with strangers and teamwork in public should be given marks in the internals, where children ought to learn Interpersonal communication skills, Rapport building, and Leadership development. If you think whatever I said above resonates with you, picture your thoughts below in the comment section. I invite schools and Educators to discuss more upon this topic of bringing in holistic development in children. I am open to speaking with anyone to bring in the change in this society of Education... #holisticdevelopment #educators #trainers #indianeducationsystem\n\n\"Is full-time IIT JEE/NEET preparation the best choice for our child?\" This question often plagues parents, bombarded by coaching institutes' relentless canvassing from as early as 8th standard. There are three questions to be answered before taking a decision on this! 1. Is your child naturally inclined towards analytical subjects, with at least some degree of introversion? Pushing a child who doesn't have a strong affinity for technical subjects can lead to undue pressure and stress. Assessing the child's natural aptitude will help here. 2. Are you willing to sacrifice your child's holistic development for the pursuit of top medical schools or IITs? Remember, adolescence is a critical period for social, emotional, and cognitive development. Full-time focus on academics may hinder their growth in other areas. 3. Is full-time coaching truly necessary for success in IIT or NEET exams? Consider balanced approaches that allow your child to maintain a normal school life while supplementing with online/offline coaching. As a career counselor, I felt compelled to put this post, as news from Kota, IITs and recently that of the young McKinsey consultant are really troubling. In my view, stripping students of a balanced life since their school days, leave them with no cope up mechanism to balance pressure / stress when they become professionals. I wished to contribute an additional perspective to the insights already presented by Dheeraj Singh, Mridumesh Kumar Rai, Shatakshi Sharma and Jaya Babu(PHRi,DDI,PoSH,MHFA). among others. I also want to take a moment to appreciate the work Amit Singh is doing among students through Lisners. Let's ensure our children have the tools and support they need to thrive, both academically and personally.
