        "text": "While hosting the G20 Presidency for the first time, India championed a climate change-focused agenda, marked by getting the group of countries to agree to tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030. India reiterated these commitments at COP28 in Dubai, where it also agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.\n\nYet, as it strives to meet its developmental goals by powering economic growth, emissions are rising. Although India was the fastest-growing G20 economy, clocking a 6.7% growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions also grew at a rapid pace of 7% to reach 2.8 gigatonnes (Gt).\n\nElectricity generation remains the country’s largest emitter by far, contributing to nearly half of India’s annual CO2 emissions, with 1.18Gt in 2023.\n\nTransitioning to clean sources of generation can help meet both India’s developmental and climate goals. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 60% of India’s electricity emissions increase in 2023 was because of cyclical weather-related events such as harsh summers and weak monsoons. This year, too, a harsh summer is likely to push India’s peak power demand to a record high of 260 gigawatts (GW). But a harsh summer means more sunny days and an opportunity for increased use of solar power.\n\nUtilising more solar power and, more broadly, clean electricity requires efforts both at the central and state levels. India’s federal structure puts electricity under the jurisdiction of both the centre and states, which have considerable authority over energy production, distribution and regulation. As a result, states’ involvement is essential for achieving the electricity transition.\n\nTo be sure, the central government has taken key policy decisions that can accelerate the electricity transition. Investments in key transmission projects to evacuate renewable energy, new regulations that aim to improve clean energy integration in the electricity grid, and reforms in the electricity markets aim to support India’s ambitious non-fossil fuel-based capacity addition targets as part of its National Determined Contributions to increase the share of non-fossil fuel-based electricity sources to half of the total installed capacity by 2030. Concurrently, the central government has implemented several energy efficiency initiatives aimed at various sectors, including appliances, buildings\n\nand industries.\n\nThe progress of states in the electricity transition is far more uneven. Some states have developed progressive steps, such as boosting decentralised renewable energy deployment, promoting solar pumps for agricultural needs, and enhancing storage solutions to ensure more renewable energy in their electricity systems.\n\nHaryana, for instance, plans to skyrocket its solar energy capacity by 22 times, installing 6,000 megawatts (MW) by 2030. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh are the only ones with notified green hydrogen policies. Gujarat was set to unveil its green hydrogen policy last year, but it is still in the draft stages. Additionally, the Karnataka Energy Department has launched the state’s ambitious plan to transition millions of irrigation pumps to solar energy to save substantial amounts of money spent as a subsidy every year.\n\nBut, as this year’s SET report finds, several other states, such as Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, need to do much more.\n\nGauging India’s progress towards electricity transition requires constant monitoring of several parameters at state level. A purely national overview can often overshadow subtle intricacies at state level that may stymie the country’s electricity transition.\n\nIEEFA and Ember launched the SET report last year to track states’ progress towards electricity transition, and help identify areas that need remedy. This year’s report builds on the previous edition with more states and even more refined dimensions and parameters to map state-level electricity transition nuances. The objective of the SET report remains unchanged, which is to provide the progress and performance of Indian states on various aspects of the clean electricity transition to help policymakers make more informed decisions.\n\nKarnataka stands out as the top performer in this dimension due to its strong performance across various parameters, particularly faring well in the State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI). Despite a lower share of renewable energy consumption compared with hydro-dominant states such as Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka’s share of renewable energy consumption in the total electricity consumption within the state accounted for approximately 37%. Consequently, the state also has a relatively low power sector emission intensity. Moreover, Karnataka has also added significant renewable energy capacity, emerging as the fifth-largest contributor from 2020 to February 2024, representing about 7% (~3.4GW) of the total renewable energy capacity addition (excluding large hydro) by 21 states.\n\nKerala stands out for its high renewable energy consumption share (29%), the fourth highest among states in this dimension, despite its relatively lower renewable energy potential. Additionally, Kerala has the third-highest score in SEEI, which may also partially explain the second-lowest power sector emission intensity in the country, indicating its efficient utilisation of electricity in various sectors.\n\nHimachal Pradesh stands out for its strong performance in this dimension due to its historically heavy reliance on hydroelectric power, which sets it apart from other states. This enables it to consume a significant amount of renewable energy, particularly from hydro sources (almost 70% of the total power purchase). Similarly, Uttarakhand also performed well because of its focus on hydroelectric power (~47% of the total power purchase). This may be partly due to their geographical location, but it has helped these states perform well in terms of a lower emissions intensity.\n\nHaryana’s renewable energy installation is high compared with its potential, which has significantly contributed to its performance in this dimension. Most of these installations have occurred in recent years, with approximately 1.1GW added from 2019 to February 2024. Moreover, it holds the fifth-highest rank in the SEEI.\n\nPunjab has performed well in this dimension due to its strong performance in specific parameters. It has excelled in utilising its renewable energy potential. Additionally, almost a quarter of Punjab’s consumption is from renewable energy, ranking seventh-highest in the country in renewable energy consumption. Moreover, the state performs relatively well in energy efficiency (seventh-highest in the states considered here) and investments in renewable energy.\n\nDespite contributing almost a quarter of India’s total renewable energy capacity addition since 2020, Gujarat’s share of renewable energy consumption within the state is relatively lower than the top-performing states (it still consumes ~17% from renewable energy). One reason for this is the low Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) target set by the Gujarat State Electricity Commission, which was 17%, a target Gujarat achieved. This target was lower than the recommended RPO target of approximately 25% for FY2022-23 set by the MoP. Additionally, the SEEI performance is modest compared with top-performing states. However, Gujarat still performs well overall in this dimension due to its renewable energy capacity addition (~12GW since 2019), significant investment in renewable energy infrastructure and expenditure within the state.\n\nAndhra Pradesh has contributed a substantial portion to India’s renewable energy capacity, and was one of the top performers in SEEI, resulting in its strong showing in this dimension.\n\nRajasthan consumes a significant portion of its total electricity from renewable energy sources, approximately 28%, making it one of the top performers in this assessment. Additionally, between 2019 to February 2024, Rajasthan added approximately 16GW of renewable energy capacity, accounting for about 31% of the total installed capacity of renewable energy by the 21 states (excluding large hydro) during this period, making it the highest contributor amongst the considered states. Despite these achievements, Rajasthan’s performance was mid-table in the decarbonisation dimension. A relatively higher power sector emissions intensity and lower SEEI score affected its overall performance.\n\nSimilar to Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu exhibits a significant contribution to renewable energy generation within the state, accounting for 9% of the total capacity addition by the 21 states over the past four years. However, unlike Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu has one of the lowest shares of renewable energy consumption in the country. Despite this, it boasts one of the lowest power sector emission intensities. Nonetheless, Tamil Nadu faces challenges in other parameters, which results in its dimension-level performance being slower than Rajasthan.\n\nSimilarly, Telangana and Maharashtra, despite having added a significant percentage of the country’s renewable energy capacity in recent years, are not among the top-performing states due to their relatively lower share in renewable energy consumption (a parameter of significant weightage in this dimension). Eastern states such as Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar are in the early stages of their decarbonisation journeys, resulting in their low scores in this dimension. While the share of renewable consumption is lower in these states, it is gradually increasing. For instance, despite its low score in this dimension, more than 16% of Jharkhand’s total electricity consumption is from renewable energy sources. However, the limited resource potential for solar and wind has constrained the capacity addition within these states. Despite this, some of these states are expected to perform well in the near future, with Odisha, for instance, attracting significant investments in renewable energy, green hydrogen and solar cell manufacturing in recent times.\n\nThis year, the dimension incorporates changes to ensure a more comprehensive assessment of state efforts. One significant alteration is the consideration of the share of total consumption of renewable energy, regardless of the source state. This adjustment aims to capture states’ endeavours in purchasing renewable energy, even if they lack abundant solar and wind resources. Consequently, the parameter of the renewable energy mix in the power supply is now based on consumption, reflecting the share of total consumption generated from renewable sources.\n\nAdditionally, to account for states’ progress in adding renewable energy capacity, we evaluate their advancements between 2019 and February 2024. Moreover, this year the dimension includes the public expenditure on renewable energy by state governments, providing insight into states’ efforts towards decarbonisation. These new parameters, along with existing metrics such as the utilisation of renewable energy potential, power sector emission density and the SEEI, constitute a more robust assessment of states’ progress towards decarbonising the power sector.\n\nDespite these changes, Karnataka maintains its position as the top performer in this dimension, showcasing consistent leadership in decarbonisation efforts. The relatively lower performance of states such as Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal remains unchanged in comparison with the previous assessment.\n\nHowever, Rajasthan’s performance has declined significantly, primarily due to a substantial reduction in its score in the new SEEI, down 46.5 points, primarily attributed to the lack of reported data. Similarly, Tamil Nadu has experienced a significant decline in performance, largely due to changes in our assessment methodologies that now include state-level renewable energy consumption. Despite its notable capacity additions, only 16% of Tamil Nadu’s total consumption is from renewable energy sources, one of the lowest percentages in the country, excluding eastern states.\n\nConversely, Chhattisgarh’s performance has improved notably. This improvement is largely because of the addition of the parameter on state expenditure in renewable energy and an improvement in the SEEI. The inclusion of these factors has lifted Chhattisgarh’s overall score, reflecting its increased efforts and effectiveness in decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nStates such as Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana and Telangana performed well across all the parameters. Conversely, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh scored low on most parameters.\n\nDelhi stands out as the top performer across five out of six parameters, particularly faring well in the uptake of distributed solar energy. Rooftop and off-grid solar contributes to 71% of its total renewable installed capacity, the highest of all states as of 29 February 2024. The state aims to generate 4,500MW or about a quarter of its total power supply through solar energy by 2027. Despite high solar penetration, the state had only met 12% of the MNRE’s renewable energy target by February 2024. Delhi’s DISCOMs have improved their performance, according to the Power Finance Corporation’s (PFC) ranking for FY2023. Moreover, Delhi had the highest short-term market participation in FY2023, with 34% of its total power purchase and captive generation volume traded in the short-term electricity market and 2% (~276 million units (MUs)) in the Green Day Ahead Market (GDAM). In addition, the state ensures a reliable electricity supply, facing only a shortage of 2MUs to meet the power requirement in FY2023.\n\nGujarat, too, shines in this dimension, boasting the highest DISCOM rating by the PFC. The state ensured reliable electricity supply, with just a 0.03% (40MUs) power shortage in FY2023. Gujarat has also built about 30% more (~5081MW) renewable capacity as of February 2024 over the MNRE suggested state target for December 2022. With only 15% of its renewable energy capacity allocated to distributed solar, Gujarat holds substantial potential for expansion in this sector. Moreover, utilising just 12% of its renewable energy potential, there is ample room for further growth. Leveraging the short-term electricity market for increased participation in GDAM beyond its current 1.8% can enhance accessibility. The state government recently signed an MoU with PFC to bolster the infrastructure of key power utilities in Gujarat.\n\nHaryana and Telangana were the other frontrunners. Haryana has the highest solar penetration after Delhi, approximately 64% as of February 2024. The state now aims to increase its solar energy capacity 22 times by installing 6,000MW by 2030. Telangana achieved the highest compliance rate of 258% for MNRE’s state-level renewable energy targets. Moreover, it effectively addresses power shortages, boasting the lowest shortfall of only 1MU in power requirement for FY2023. Recently, the state has also proposed the implementation of open access for power consumers, signalling a significant shift in the energy landscape.\n\nLower DISCOM ratings led to a mid-table scoring for Karnataka and Rajasthan despite achieving high scores in Dimension 1. Karnataka scores well in MNRE’s state-level renewable energy target achieved, experiences fewer power shortages, and maintains lower electricity intensity. However, its overall performance is affected as Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM), a prominent DISCOM in Karnataka responsible for nearly 47% of total power purchases, received the second lowest rating by the PFC of all DISCOMs in the state. Furthermore, the state has only about 7% (~1,592MW) of its renewable energy installed capacity as distributed solar energy.\n\nOn the other hand, Rajasthan’s performance in short-term market participation remains limited, with only 14% (~104,830MUs) of its total power purchase and captive generation traded in the short-term electricity market in FY2023. Of this, a mere 0.4% (~59MUs) is traded in the GDAM. The state also faces significant power shortages, amounting to approximately 1.6% (1,611MUs) in FY2023. Additionally, Rajasthan exhibits a lower uptake of distributed solar energy, with about 6.4% compared with the total installed renewable energy capacity as of February 2024.\n\nSimilarly, Maharashtra, despite performing well in Dimension 1, scores low in Dimension 2 due to its subpar performance in DISCOM performance, short-term market participation and uptake of distributed solar energy. Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), one of Maharashtra’s major DISCOMs responsible for approximately 90% of total power purchased by DISCOMs in the state, scored low in the PFC rating, thus lowering the state’s overall score. In terms of short-term market participation, 13% (~165,190MUs) of the total power purchase and captive generation is being traded in the short-term electricity market, with only about 4% (~735MUs) of it traded in GDAM. Additionally, the state has only about 12% (~2,033MW) of its renewable energy installed capacity in the distributed solar energy category.\n\nJharkhand scores were low across all the parameters. With the lowest DISCOM performance rating by PFC, the state has only achieved 7% (~142MW) of its MNRE renewable energy target of 2,005MW, indicating the potential for expansion. Additionally, it faces the lowest adequacy of power supply, experiencing a shortage of 863MUs against a requirement of 12,183MUs in FY2023, resulting in a 7% deficit.\n\nSurprisingly, Tamil Nadu’s overall score was only better than that of one state. This was primarily due to the bad performance of its DISCOMs and lower than expected distributed solar uptake (2%). The state should focus on strengthening the penetration of rooftop solar and solar pumps along with utility-scale projects. The state DISCOM registered a loss of Rs91.92 billion (US$1.1 billion) for FY2023, Rs600 million (US$7.2 million) more than the previous year, despite a tariff hike. The state’s short-term market participation stands at 11% (~112,817MUs) of total power purchase and captive generation. There is an opportunity to increase participation further, particularly in the GDAM, where only 0.7% (~87MU) of the traded volume lies.\n\nDimension 2 has undergone revisions to provide a more holistic view of states’ readiness for the electricity transition. One notable change involves merging Dimension 2 (Performance of Power System) and Dimension 3 (Readiness of the Power Ecosystem) from the SET 2023 report. This modification aims to strengthen the interlinkages between a strong distribution and transition infrastructure, and the efficient use of each electron.\n\nConsequently, we widened the parameter assessing the states’ green market participation to capture their participation in short-term electricity markets, facilitating efficient power sharing and system flexibility. Another addition was to capture the penetration of distributed solar energy. This reflects states’ efforts towards diversifying the energy mix and ensuring energy access across diverse regions. We also removed parameters such as feeder segregation and smart metering due to the lack of data available.\n\nAs a result of the changes, the performance of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, which topped Dimension 2 and Dimension 3 last year, suffered a setback in 2024. On the other hand, Delhi, Haryana and Telangana outperformed from last year in strengthening their readiness.\n\nLast year, Karnataka’s strong performance was due to its high electricity generation volumes, robust green market participation and successful attainment of renewable energy targets, highlighting its proactive approach to electricity transition. However, this year the relatively lower DISCOM performance, short-term market participation and the removal of parameters, such as feeder segregation and smart metering, affected its overall performance in the dimension.\n\nDelhi’s performance improved this year due to its better DISCOM rating, short-term market participation and the uptake of decentralised solar energy.\n\nGujarat continued to be a strong performer this year, too, despite the changes in the parameters. Conversely, states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were low performers across both years, with lower readiness levels in terms of short-term market participation, meeting renewable energy targets and DISCOM rating.\n\nOdisha emerges as the top-performing state with the lowest incremental green tariff rate of Rs0.25/kWh (US$0.003/kWh) compared with other states. With a robust state-specific renewable energy policy and green open access rules in place, the state has strengthened its policy ecosystem. Furthermore, Odisha demonstrates significant progress in the EV sector, fostering an enabling environment for development through the right policy signals, including fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, subsidies for charging infrastructure, investments in manufacturing and skills development, and innovative EV tariff and battery-swapping policies. Additionally, Odisha has successfully implemented eight out of 14 codes/regulations set by state regulators to strengthen the operation of its distribution system as per the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) white paper 2023. Even though Odisha does not have any installed pumped hydro storage or battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity, the state has invited tenders for 500MW of energy storage capacity with five hours of peak support for a period of five years.\n\nKarnataka excels not only in Dimension 1 but also in Dimension 3, with a competitive incremental green tariff rate of Rs0.5/kWh (US0.6¢/kWh), existing renewable energy policy applicable until 2027 and adoption of green open access rules. In the EV sector, the state leads with a high number of EV public charging stations, with one station per 62 EV’s as of January 2024. The state surpassed Delhi and Maharashtra with 5,059 public EV charging stations. Karnataka has also implemented various codes/regulations emphasising its commitment to regulatory excellence in the distribution system.\n\nMaharashtra, Gujarat and Uttarakhand were other frontrunners with functional state renewable energy policies and successfully adopted Green Open Access Rules (GOAR). Maharashtra boasts an incremental green tariff rate of Rs0.66/kWh (US¢0.8/kWh) and Uttarakhand has a rate of Rs0.26/kWh (US¢0.3/kWh), the second-lowest after Odisha. However, Gujarat’s green tariff rate is the highest of the states at Rs1.5/kWh (US¢1.8/kWh) and thus holds great potential to perform better in this area. In terms of storage capacity, Maharashtra and Gujarat have pumped hydro storage capacities of 400MW and 1,440MW, respectively. Gujarat also has 6MW of BESS storage. Although there are a number of other storage tenders (round-the-clock, BESS and grid-scale storage), most have not yet been commissioned.\n\nRajasthan and Punjab were mid-table in this dimension. Rajasthan’s lack of green tariff and limited focus on scaling storage options affected its score. On the other hand, Punjab’s absence of a renewable energy policy and target led to low scores.\n\nWithout these market enablers, the widespread adoption of renewable-based electricity faces challenges, slowing down the transition towards sustainable energy sources.\n\nBihar, Kerala, Assam, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh need to intensify their efforts to promote renewable energy uptake as they scored low across the parameters. The absence of a EV ecosystem and non-adoption of GOARs and an EV ecosystem affected the scoring of Himachal Pradesh. On the other hand, the absence of a green tariff and the non-implementation of GOARs affected the score of Delhi, Assam and Bihar, limiting opportunities for renewable energy procurement. Moreover, Kerala and Bihar’s lack of renewable energy policy exacerbates these challenges, hindering efforts to encourage renewable energy adoption. However, the Kerala state government recently constituted a panel to draft its comprehensive energy policy.\n\nOn the other hand, despite Delhi’s exemplary EV ecosystem, its overall performance in this dimension is affected by other factors such as the absence of green tariffs and green open access rules. It needs to address these policy gaps and enhance their renewable energy frameworks to facilitate a smoother transition towards sustainable energy sources and achieve their renewable energy goals.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of a defined renewable energy policy target further complicates Bihar’s journey towards renewable energy adoption. The state’s renewable energy sector remains underdeveloped due to inadequate policy support and infrastructure. Bihar’s renewable energy target and policy framework have not been updated since 2017. Despite setting a target of 3433MW of power from renewable sources, Bihar had only achieved 420MW by February 2024."
