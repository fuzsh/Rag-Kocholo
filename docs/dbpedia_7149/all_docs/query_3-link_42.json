        "text": "Background story\n\nBorn and brought up in Pithoragarh, a beautiful valley amongst snow-covered mountains in Uttarakhand. I have adored nature since childhood, and my love for nature is still immense. For as long as I can remember, I have been curious about technology, which has always amazed me. My mind always wondered how this could be done with just one click. Following my interests and passion for information technology, I landed upon pursuing B.Tech in Computer Engineering from the G.B.Pant University of Agri. & Tech, Uttarakhand, and graduated in 2013.\n\nCareer Journey\n\nHere’s my journey in the corporate world, short and crisp:\n\nJuly 2013 — November 2013: Utilizing the free time and exploring something new, I started working as a Teaching Assistant in a nearby engineering college. I was working on programming projects with the final and pre-final year students.\n\nDecember 2013: My journey started as a Software Engineer Trainee with TCS, where I worked on the core banking solutions application for US-based Retail banks.\n\nOctober 2015 — March 2019: Worked with travel giant Sabre for their Hospitality Solutions SAAS-based Central Reservation Systems, where I worked on the product development for the rate and room backend systems.\n\nMarch 2019 — August 2021: Worked for their Inbound team, meant for procuring items for Myntra from vendors worldwide through generating POS. It was my entry into the e-commerce industry and was a great learning exposure that helped me learn the insights of scalability and performance impact with a small change.\n\nYour roles and responsibilities at Lenskart?\n\nI am honored to be a member of Lenskart’s two tech teams. It gives me the confidence to take advantage of as many opportunities as possible. Lenskart has changed my life and the way I interact with others. It has given me self-assurance!\n\nCurrently, I am working in the POS team, as well as the Platform team.\n\nI lead the finance module of the Lenskart Point of Sale (POS) team, and we are responsible for developing Orders, Payments, Margins, and commission features for a vast number of stores around the world. Working as a developer is my other responsibility on the platform team. Working on redesigning and redeveloping current system difficulties is also part of my responsibilities. We’re currently working to resolve existing concerns related to performance and scalability. This contributes to the system’s long-term stability and reliability.\n\nFavorite thing at Lenskart?\n\nFlexibility: The ample opportunities and the flexibility to learn and develop in your chosen field. You can bring your problem to the entire team, and everyone will work together to find a solution.\n\nOmnichannel Expansion: Lenskart’s omnichannel platform presents daily new challenges and learning opportunities. We must always build solutions that take into account the bifurcation of a Lenskart store business and ensure that the most optimal solutions are found. As a result, learning and exposure are at their peak!\n\nOne piece of advice for the aspiring minds, who are new to the corporate world?\n\nLearning Innovative things: Always focus on learning high-quality talents, such as those that are creative and original and will set you apart from others. Rather than doing monotonous work for greater pay and workplace advantages, learn talents that thrill you and make you hungry.\n\nBe a Master of one: It’s fine to be multi-talented on occasion, but try to focus on one learning at a time. One learning at a time will assist you in reaching new heights and becoming a master in your field.\n\nYour ‘TYPICAL’ day at Lenskart?\n\nMy day begins at 10 a.m. with daily scrum meetings with the team, handling the updates. We also discuss obstacles and production difficulties during the discussions. In this new work-from-home manner, I attempt to schedule the first half of my day for any meetings and the second half for work only. This aids in the organization, prioritization, and timely delivery of my work.\n\nSomething about the work culture of your teams?\n\nPOS Team: Despite being a small team of seven people, the quality of the problems we work on and their impact on POS orders (which account for roughly 80% of all orders) gives us a sense of responsibility for the decisions we make.\n\nPlatform team: We now have four individuals on the Platform team who are working on revamping some of the existing features and services for scalability and performance difficulties.\n\nBoth teams are fantastic in terms of the amount of effort and time we put in to get those positive results. Every day, everyone works with a vision or an objective. As a result, it’s a pleasure to collaborate with such amazing colleagues.\n\nWhy should the young minds join the tech talent pool at Lenskart?\n\nAmple opportunities to learn: Being remarkable is what we do! Lenskart is filled with a boatload of opportunities for young minds to come to join our talent pool. Here in Lenskart, we follow a strong work and team collaboration culture.\n\nQuality work with competitive benefits: We work according to deadlines, but more importantly, we work to achieve the necessary result. As a result, delivering high-quality work is our top focus.\n\nKind of challenges faced?\n\nFollowing the dual-mode (own and franchise stores) where one answer may differ from the other, we must always consider the solutions while building this bifurcation path.\n\nWhile working on re-engineering projects, the Platform team must ensure that the impact on other services is minimized through numerous integration and load testing rounds before coming live.\n\nHow does technology help enhance the POS process?\n\nLenskart is expanding globally, and the POS team is striving to ensure that our systems can scale & handle the increased volume of orders we’re now processing. We’re making progress thanks to technology, and this number is expected to rise much higher.\n\nHow has Lenskart helped you grow as a person?\n\nWith Lenskart, I’ve begun a new career path of leading a team and taking ownership, where you must ensure that you move with your team in highs and lows, ensuring that every step is in sync with the team. It gives you the ability to handle pressure, as you must sometimes make difficult decisions while delivering impactful results. As a result, it has helped me bring miracles to my professional life."
