        "text": "Constitution of India and Indian Polity\n\nThe Constitution\n\nIn a democracy, the people have the power to make decisions and govern themselves.\n\nA constitution is a set of rules and principles that a country follows. It is like a living thing that can change and grow over time.\n\nThe constitution of a country reflects the values and beliefs of the people who created it.\n\nThe constitution is based on the social, political, and economic beliefs of the people, as well as their hopes and dreams for the future.\n\nConstitutional law is the study of the basic laws of a country, as set out in the constitution.\n\nThe constitution is not just a set of laws, but it is also the framework for how laws are made.\n\nDrafting the Constitution\n\nThe idea of a constituent assembly was linked to the growth of the national movement in India.\n\nThe assembly created different committees to work on different parts of the constitution.\n\nThe Making of the Indian Constitution\n\nThe Constituent Assembly, formed in 1946, was responsible for creating the Indian Constitution.\n\nDr. B. R. Ambedkar, the Law Minister at the time, led a Drafting Committee to write the Constitution.\n\nOn November 26, 1949, the Constituent Assembly approved, signed, and adopted the Constitution of India.\n\nOn January 26, 1950, the Constitution went into effect, making India a republic.\n\nStructure of the Indian Constitution\n\nThe Indian Constitution is a unique and comprehensive document that doesn’t fit into any specific model.\n\nIt consists of:\n\nA Preamble\n\n22 Parts, containing over 395 Articles\n\n12 Schedules\n\nAn Appendix\n\nThe original Constitution had 22 parts, 395 articles, and 8 schedules. Over the past 60 years, various amendments have been made, resulting in the current structure.\n\nThe Constitution of India\n\nThe Constitution of India has been amended 98 times since it was first adopted in 1950.\n\nThe number of schedules has increased from 8 to 12, and the number of articles has increased from 395 to more than 448.\n\nThe Constitution is a mix of rigid and flexible features, and it has both federal and unitary, presidential and parliamentary elements.\n\nThe Preamble\n\nThe Preamble of the Constitution sets out the basic values and principles on which the Constitution is based.\n\nThe 42nd Amendment (1976) added the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ to the Preamble, which now reads as follows:\n\n“We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens:\n\nJustice, social, economic and political;\n\nLiberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\n\nEquality of status and of opportunity and to promote among them all;\n\nFraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.”\n\nThe Preamble to the Indian Constitution\n\nThe Preamble to the Indian Constitution is a brief introduction that sets out the guiding principles and objectives of the Constitution. It was adopted on November 26, 1949, by the Constituent Assembly of India.\n\nKey Points:\n\nThe Preamble is an important part of the Constitution, but it is not essential.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India has ruled that the Preamble is subject to the amending power of Parliament, but the basic structure of the Constitution found in the Preamble cannot be destroyed.\n\nThe Preamble serves three main purposes:\n\nIt indicates the source of the Constitution’s authority, which is the people of India.\n\nIt states the objectives of the Constitution, which include securing justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for all citizens.\n\nIt sets out the fundamental principles of the Constitution, such as democracy, socialism, and secularism.\n\nSignificance of the Preamble:\n\nThe Preamble has been used by the Supreme Court of India to interpret the Constitution and to decide cases. It has also been used to justify the enactment of certain laws and policies.\n\nThe Preamble is a powerful statement of the values and aspirations of the Indian people. It is a reminder of the sacrifices that were made to achieve independence and of the commitment to building a just and equitable society.\n\nThe Preamble of the Constitution\n\nThe Preamble is the introduction to the Constitution of India. It explains where the Constitution gets its authority, what it aims to achieve, and when it was adopted.\n\nThe Preamble is important because it helps us understand the goals and values of the Constitution. It can also be used to interpret the Constitution when the language is unclear.\n\nInterpretation of the Preamble\n\nThe Preamble can be used to determine the scope of fundamental rights and directive principles of state policy.\n\nIt can also be used to interpret constitutional provisions that declare India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic.\n\nImportant Constitutional Doctrines\n\nDoctrine of Double Jeopardy\n\nA person cannot be prosecuted and punished for the same crime more than once.\n\nDoctrine of Eclipse\n\nThe state cannot make laws that conflict with the Constitution.\n\nThe Basic Features of the Constitution\n\nThe Constitution of India has certain basic features that cannot be changed. These features are essential to the functioning of the country as a democratic republic.\n\nThe Supreme Court has identified the following as basic features of the Constitution:\n\nIndia as a sovereign democratic republic\n\nEquality of status and opportunity\n\nSecularism and the freedom of conscience\n\nRule of law\n\nAmending power of the parliament\n\nJudicial review\n\nBalance between the fundamental rights and the directive principles\n\nThese features cannot be changed by any law that contravenes any of the fundamental rights (Article 13(2)). The Supreme Court of India has stated that all laws, including those listed in Schedule 9 of the Constitution, can be reviewed by the courts if they go against the basic structure of the Constitution.\n\nDoctrine of Bias\n\nA person should not be the judge in their own case.\n\nJustice should not only be done but should also appear to be done to maintain the legitimacy of the judicial system.\n\nDoctrine of Harmonious Interpretation\n\nIf two parts of the Constitution seem to contradict each other, the meaning that allows both parts to work together smoothly should be chosen.\n\nDoctrine of Liberal Interpretation\n\nThe Constitution should be interpreted broadly.\n\nThis has led to creative legal thinking in India.\n\nDoctrine of Progressive Interpretation\n\nThe Constitution should be interpreted in a way that considers how society and the law are constantly changing.\n\nDoctrine of Ministerial Responsibility\n\nMinisters are responsible for the actions of their departments and can be held accountable by Parliament.\n\nResponsibility:\n\nMinisters are accountable to the people through their elected representatives in Parliament for every action taken by the government.\n\nThis is a crucial aspect of the parliamentary system.\n\nDoctrine of Pith and Substance:\n\nIf a law made by Parliament (under Articles 249 and 250) conflicts with a state law, the law made by Parliament will prevail, and the state law will be invalid to the extent of the conflict.\n\nDoctrine of Pleasure:\n\nGovernment employees, including those in defense and civil services, can be dismissed from their jobs without any explanation.\n\nHowever, certain high-ranking officials, such as Supreme Court and High Court judges, the Chief Election Commissioner, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and members of Public Service Commissions, have special constitutional protections that prevent them from being removed from office except in specific ways.\n\nDoctrine of Prospective Overruling\n\nA court’s interpretation of the constitution or a law cannot be used to say that past actions were illegal.\n\nDoctrine of Repugnancy\n\nIf there is a conflict between a federal law and a state law, the court will decide which law applies based on the subject matter of the law.\n\nDoctrine of Severability\n\nIf part of a law is found to be unconstitutional, the rest of the law can still be valid if it can stand on its own without the unconstitutional part.\n\nDoctrine of Territorial Nexus\n\nA state law cannot be applied to people or things outside of the state unless there is a strong connection between the state and the subject matter of the law.\n\nThis doctrine is often used in cases involving sales. The Constitution of India is a complex document that outlines the structure and powers of the Indian government. It is divided into several parts and articles, each of which covers a different topic.\n\nPart I/Articles 1-4 deals with the territory of India, including the admission, establishment, or formation of new states.\n\nPart II/Articles 5-11 covers citizenship issues.\n\nPart III/Articles 12-35 outlines the fundamental rights of Indian citizens.\n\nPart IV/Articles 36-51 sets out the directive principles of state policy, which are guidelines for the government to follow in order to promote the welfare of the people.\n\nPart IV-A/Article 51 A lists the duties of a citizen of India.\n\nPart V/Articles 52-151 deals with the government at the union level, including the executive, legislature, and judiciary.\n\nPart VI/Articles 152-237 covers the government at the state level, including the executive, legislature, and judiciary.\n\nPart VII/Article 238 was repealed by the 7th Amendment in 1956.\n\nPart VIII/Articles 239-241 deals with the administration of union territories, which are areas that are not part of any state.\n\nPart IX/Articles 242-243 O covers the Panchayats, which are local self-government institutions in rural areas.\n\nPart IX-A/Articles 243P-243 ZG deals with the municipalities, which are local self-government institutions in urban areas.\n\nPart X/Articles 244-244 A covers scheduled and tribal areas, which are areas that are inhabited by indigenous peoples.\n\nPart XI/Articles 245-263 outlines the relations between the union and states.\n\nPart XII/Articles 264-300 A deals with finance, property, contracts, and suits.\n\nPart XIII/Articles 301-307 covers trade, commerce, and transport.\n\nPart XIV/Articles 308-323 (Services under the union and states)\n\nThis part deals with the services of the government, including the civil services, the armed forces, and the police.\n\nPart XIV-A/Articles 323A-323B (Deals with administrative tribunals)\n\nThis part deals with the establishment and functioning of administrative tribunals, which are special courts that handle disputes between citizens and the government.\n\nPart XV/Articles 324-329A (Election and election commission)\n\nThis part deals with the conduct of elections and the establishment of the Election Commission, which is responsible for overseeing elections.\n\nPart XVI/Articles 330-342 (Special provision to certain classes SCs/STs, OBCs and Anglo Indians)\n\nThis part deals with the special provisions that are made for certain classes of citizens, such as Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and Anglo Indians.\n\nPart XVII/Articles 343-351 (Official languages)\n\nThis part deals with the official languages of India, which are Hindi and English.\n\nPart XVIII/Articles 352-360 (Emergency provisions)\n\nThis part deals with the emergency provisions that can be invoked by the President of India in times of war, external aggression, or internal disturbance.\n\nPart XIX/Articles 361-367 (Miscellaneous provisions)\n\nThis part deals with various miscellaneous provisions, such as the citizenship of India, the protection of the environment, and the right to property.\n\nPart XX/Article 368 (Amendment of constitution)\n\nThis part deals with the procedure for amending the constitution.\n\nPart XXI/Articles 369-392 (Temporary, transitional and special provisions)\n\nThis part deals with the temporary, transitional, and special provisions that were made when the constitution was first adopted.\n\nPart XXII/Articles 393-395 (Short title, commencement and repeal of the constitution)\n\nThis part deals with the short title, commencement, and repeal of the constitution.\n\nSCHEDULES\n\nSchedules are lists of items that are included in the constitution.

It includes several important provisions that aim to ensure the well-being and rights of all citizens. Here are some key points:\n\nAdequate Livelihood: The government should provide enough opportunities for people to earn a living.\n\nWealth Distribution: Wealth should be shared fairly among all citizens.\n\nChild and Youth Protection: Children and young people should be protected and supported.\n\nEqual Pay: Men and women should receive equal pay for the same work.\n\nFree Education: Children up to the age of 14 should receive free and mandatory education.\n\nCow Slaughter Prevention: Cow slaughter is prohibited.\n\nRights to Work and Education: Citizens have the right to work, education, and public assistance during unemployment, old age, sickness, or disability.\n\nLiquor Prohibition: The production, sale, and consumption of alcohol are prohibited.\n\nVillage Panchayats: Local village councils should be established to promote self-governance.\n\nHistorical Preservation: Historical and national monuments should be protected.\n\nJudicial Independence: The judiciary should be separate from the executive branch to ensure a fair and consistent legal system.\n\nInternational Cooperation: India should work with other countries to promote peace and security worldwide.\n\nLegal Aid: The government should provide free legal assistance to disadvantaged individuals.\n\nEnvironmental Protection: The state should protect the natural environment, forests, and wildlife.\n\nDifference Between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles\n\nFundamental rights are essential rights guaranteed by the constitution that cannot be violated by the government. Directive principles, on the other hand, are guidelines for the government to work towards achieving social and economic goals.\n\nDirective Principles vs. Fundamental Rights\n\nDirective principles are guidelines for the government to follow when making policies and laws. They are not legally enforceable, meaning that citizens cannot take the government to court if they feel that a directive principle has been violated.\n\nOn the other hand, fundamental rights are legally enforceable rights that citizens have. If a citizen feels that their fundamental rights have been violated, they can take the government to court.\n\n42nd Amendment Bill, 1976\n\nThe 42nd Amendment Bill, 1976 made some changes to the Indian Constitution, including giving directive principles precedence over fundamental rights. This means that if there is a conflict between a directive principle and a fundamental right, the directive principle will prevail.\n\nThe 42nd Amendment Bill also added two more directive principles:\n\nFree legal aid from the state to weaker sections of society\n\nThe state to protect the natural environment, forests, and wildlife\n\nDuties of a Citizen of India\n\nThe 42nd Amendment Bill, 1976 also added 10 fundamental duties for citizens of India.

This process is called impeachment.\n\nVice President\n\nThe vice president is chosen by a group of people called the electoral college. This group includes members of both houses of Parliament.\n\nUnlike the president’s election, state legislatures are not involved in choosing the vice president.\n\nThe vice president serves for five years and can be re-elected right away.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe vice president is the official leader of the Rajya Sabha, one of the two houses of Parliament.\n\nIf the president dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the vice president takes over as president.\n\nThe vice president also acts as president when the president is sick, away, or unable to do their job for any other reason.\n\nPrime Minister\n\nThe prime minister is the leader of the Indian government.\n\nThe prime minister is the leader of the political party that has the most seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.\n\nThe president appoints the prime minister.\n\nThe prime minister serves for five years and can stay in office as long as the president agrees and until a new Lok Sabha is formed.\n\nIf the government loses a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha (but not in the Rajya Sabha), the prime minister must resign. The government, led by the Prime Minister, must step down.\n\nRajya Sabha\n\nThe Rajya Sabha is the upper house of the Indian Parliament.\n\nIt has 250 members, of which 238 are elected by the state and union territory legislatures, and 12 are nominated by the president.\n\nThe vice president of India is the ex officio chairman of the Rajya Sabha, and the deputy chairman is elected from among the members.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha is a permanent body, and one-third of its members retire every two years.\n\nMembers of the Rajya Sabha serve six-year terms.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha shares the power to amend the constitution with the Lok Sabha.\n\nIt can also originate any bill (except a money bill) and refer the charge of impeachment against the president.\n\nThe elected members of the Rajya Sabha take part in the election of the president and the vice president.\n\nLok Sabha\n\nThe Lok Sabha is the lower house of the Indian Parliament.\n\nIt is also known as the House of the People.\n\nThe Lok Sabha has 545 members, of which 543 are elected from single-member constituencies, and two are nominated by the president.\n\nThe Lok Sabha is elected for a five-year term.\n\nThe Lok Sabha has the power to pass laws, approve the budget, and impeach the president.\n\nThe prime minister of India is the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha.\n\nComposition of the Lok Sabha:\n\nMembers are elected directly by the people from different regions (states and union territories) in India.\n\nTwo members are nominated by the President to represent the Anglo-Indian community. This is done to ensure that this community has a voice in the Lok Sabha, even if they do not have enough votes to win an election.\n\nStrength of the Lok Sabha:\n\nThe Lok Sabha has a total of 552 members.\n\n530 members represent states, and 20 members represent union territories.\n\nUp to two additional members can be nominated by the President to represent the Anglo-Indian community. However, this is only done if the President believes that this community is not adequately represented in the Lok Sabha.\n\nSize of the Council of Ministers:\n\nThe Council of Ministers is limited to 15% of the total number of members in the Lok Sabha.\n\nThis limit was set by amending Articles 75 and 164 of the Indian Constitution.\n\nSessions of Parliament:\n\nThe Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha meet for sessions throughout the year.\n\nThere are usually three sessions each year:\n\nBudget session (February to May)\n\nMonsoon session (July to September)\n\nWinter session (November to December)\n\nThe President summons both houses of Parliament for each session.\n\nThere must not be a gap of more than 6 months between two sessions of Parliament. The Parliament’s sessions are divided into four parts, with a 3-4 week break in between each part. This means that there are four sessions in a year.\n\nThe schedule of sessions may change during an election year or in other special situations.\n\nOrdinary Bills: All bills except money bills are introduced in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. After a debate, a bill is passed by a majority vote and sent to the other house.\n\nIf the other house suggests changes to the bill, it is sent back to the house where it started for reconsideration. The bill is considered passed by both houses if the original house accepts the changes made by the other house.\n\nThe bill is then sent to the President for his approval. If the President approves the bill, it becomes a law. If the President does not approve the bill, it is rejected.\n\nIf the President neither approves nor rejects the bill, he can send it back to Parliament for reconsideration. If both houses pass the bill again after reconsideration, it becomes a law.\n\nMoney Bills:\n\nMoney bills can only start in the Lok Sabha, and the president must recommend them.\n\nAfter the Lok Sabha passes a money bill, it goes to the Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha has 14 days to make recommendations. If they don’t do it within 14 days, the bill is considered passed by both houses.\n\nIf the Rajya Sabha sends back the bill with recommendations, the Lok Sabha can choose to accept or reject them.\n\nEven if the Lok Sabha rejects the Rajya Sabha’s recommendations, the bill is still considered passed.\n\nJoint Sitting of Parliament:\n\nThe president can order a joint session of both houses of Parliament to consider a particular bill in three situations:\n\nA bill is passed by one house but rejected by the other.\n\nThe amendments made by one house are not acceptable to the house where the bill started.\n\nA bill has been pending (not passed) in a house for more than 6 months from the date it was received.\n\nCaretaker Government\n\nThe constitution does not mention anything about a caretaker government.\n\nThis term is used to describe a group of ministers who have resigned because they lost the trust of the Lok Sabha or for some other reason. However, the president asks them to continue until a new government is formed.\n\nIf a state government cannot function according to the constitution, the president can impose president’s rule.\n\nAnti-defection Law\n\nThe anti-defection law was added to the constitution to stop politicians from switching parties. However, it ended up making it easier for large groups of politicians to switch parties.\n\nThe commission suggested that all politicians who switch parties should resign and run for re-election.\n\nThey should not be allowed to hold any public office or other paid political position unless they win re-election.\n\nVotes cast for politicians who switch parties should not be counted.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nThe Constitution of India balances the ideas of parliamentary sovereignty and judicial supremacy.\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in India.\n\nComposition: The Supreme Court has 1 Chief Justice and 33 other judges.\n\nThe President appoints the Chief Justice, and the President appoints the other judges after consulting with the Chief Justice.\n\nLocation: The Supreme Court usually meets in New Delhi.\n\nBut it can meet anywhere in India. The Chief Justice of India decides this in consultation with the President.\n\nQualifications: To be a Supreme Court judge, you must have been a High Court judge for 5 years, a famous lawyer, or a practicing lawyer in a High Court for 10 years.\n\nFunctions:\n\nIt settles disputes between the central government and state governments.\n\nIt hears appeals from High Courts.\n\nIt protects fundamental rights.\n\nIt interprets the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in India and has the power to interpret the constitution.\n\nIt hears appeals from the High Courts in certain civil and criminal cases.\n\nThe President of India can ask the Supreme Court for its opinion on any important question of law or fact.\n\nThe Supreme Court can issue orders or instructions to enforce any of the fundamental rights mentioned in the constitution.\n\nTenure of Supreme Court Judges\n\nJudges of the Supreme Court can serve until they are 65 years old.\n\nAfter retiring, a Supreme Court judge cannot practice law or work for any authority in India.\n\nState Executive\n\nThe executive branch of the state government consists of:\n\nThe Governor\n\nThe Chief Minister\n\nThe Council of Ministers\n\nGovernor\n\nThe Governor is the official head of the state and is appointed by the President of India for a five-year term.\n\nThe Governor’s powers include:\n\nExecutive powers\n\nLegislative powers\n\nFinancial powers\n\nJudicial powers\n\nDiscretionary powers\n\nPresident vs. Governor\n\nThe President of India is the head of state, while the Governor is the head of the state government.\n\nThe President appoints the Governor, and the Governor serves at the President’s pleasure.\n\nThe President has more power than the Governor. The governor of a state cannot choose the judges for the State High Courts, but the president can (after talking to the governor and the chief justice of India).\n\nAlso, the governor doesn’t have any special powers during emergencies, but the president does.\n\nState Council of Ministers\n\nChief Minister\n\nThe leader of the party that has the most seats in the state assembly is asked by the governor to become the chief minister.\n\nSomeone who isn’t already a member of the state legislature can still be chosen as the chief minister, but they have to get elected within 6 months of being appointed.\n\nThe chief minister suggests who should be ministers and what their responsibilities should be to the governor, who then officially makes them ministers.\n\nTerm: 5 years\n\nCouncil of Ministers\n\nMaking the Council of Ministers: According to the constitution, every state must have a group of ministers to help the governor make decisions (except for a few special cases). - After the governor appoints a chief minister according to the constitution, the chief minister makes a list of his ministers, which the governor usually approves.\n\nThis creates the state’s ministry, and a formal council of ministers is formed.\n\nThe council of ministers is closely connected to the state legislature and acts as its executive arm.\n\nAccording to the constitution, all ministers must be members of either house of the state legislature.\n\nBefore a minister starts working, the governor gives them oaths of office and secrecy following the procedures outlined in the third schedule.\n\nThe state legislature decides the salaries and allowances of ministers.\n\nThe council of ministers is collectively responsible to the state’s legislative assembly.\n\nMinister’s Tenure:\n\nA minister must be a member of the state legislature.\n\nIf a minister is not a member of the legislature for six consecutive months, they will lose their position as a minister.\n\nState Legislature:\n\nThe state legislature is made up of the governor and one or two houses.\n\nIf a state has only one house, it’s called the legislative assembly.\n\nIf a state has two houses, the second one is called the legislative council.\n\nStates with one house are called unicameral, while states with two houses are called bicameral.\n\nBicameral States:\n\nCurrently, only five states in India have a bicameral legislature: Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAll other states have only one house.\n\nLegislative Council (Vidhan Parishad):\n\nAlso known as the Upper House.\n\nThe total number of members in the legislative council cannot be more than one-third of the number of members in the legislative assembly.\n\nThe strength of the council varies depending on the population of the state.\n\nMembers serve for six years, with one-third of the members retiring every two years.\n\nOne-third of the members are elected by local bodies, one-third by the legislative assembly, one-twelfth by university graduates with at least three years of standing, a similar proportion by teachers, and one-sixth are nominated by the governor.\n\nLegislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha)\n\nAlso known as the Lower House.\n\nThe strength of the assembly can be between 60 and 525 members, except for Sikkim, which has only 32 members.\n\nMembers serve for five years.\n\nMembers are directly elected from territorial constituencies within the state.\n\nThe council of ministers is responsible to the assembly.\n\nThe chief minister is the leader of the house.\n\nState Judiciary\n\nHigh Court\n\nEach state has a High Court, which is the highest court in the state. The highest court in a state is called the High Court. Sometimes, two or more states may share a common High Court. For instance, Punjab, Haryana, and the union territory of Chandigarh have a common High Court. Currently, there are 21 High Courts in India.\n\nThe state judiciary is made up of a chief justice and other judges appointed by the president of India. The number of judges in each High Court varies. For example, the Allahabad High Court has 37 judges, while the Jammu and Kashmir High Court has only 5.\n\nHigh Court judges serve until they reach the age of 62. Their term can be shortened if they resign or are removed by the president through a process called impeachment in the parliament. A judge may also leave office if they are appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court or transferred to another High Court.\n\nThe president can only remove a High Court judge if the parliament passes a resolution by a two-third majority.\n\nRestriction on Legal Practice:\n\nIf a person has been a judge in a High Court, they cannot practice law in that same court. However, they can practice law in the Supreme Court or in a different High Court where they did not serve as a judge.\n\nHigh Court’s Power of Superintendence:\n\nEach High Court has the authority to oversee and supervise all the courts within its jurisdiction.\n\nJudicial Functions:\n\nA High Court can hear appeals and review decisions made by lower courts in cases related to revenue and its collection, as well as cases involving the enforcement of fundamental rights.\n\nThe decisions made by a High Court are considered important and are referred to in future cases.\n\nAdministrative Functions:\n\nA High Court can make rules and regulations to manage the practices and procedures of the courts within its jurisdiction.\n\nIt can also specify how records and accounts should be kept in these courts. The High Court oversees the operations of all lower courts and establishes rules and procedures for conducting business.\n\nIt has the authority to examine the records of lower courts.\n\nHowever, it has no authority over any court or tribunal established under military law.\n\nAppointment of Judges\n\nThe president appoints all High Court judges, including the chief justice.\n\nThe chief justice of India and the governor of the relevant state are consulted before appointing the chief justice.\n\nThe chief justice of the relevant High Court is also consulted before appointing a judge, in addition to the chief justice of India and the governor of the relevant state.\n\nHowever, the president ultimately makes all judicial appointments.\n\nOn October 6, 1993, the Supreme Court’s constitution bench ruled that the chief justice’s opinion (of the relevant High Court and the Supreme Court) would take precedence in both the appointment\n\nQualifications for High Court Judges:\n\nTo become a judge in the High Court, a person must:\n\nBe a citizen of India.\n\nHave been a lawyer for at least 10 years in a High Court or two High Courts in a row.\n\nHave held a judicial position in India for at least 10 years.\n\nBalwant Rai Mehta Committee:\n\nAfter India gained independence, the government started a “Community Development Programme” in 1952. But it didn’t work because people didn’t feel connected to it. They saw it as something the government forced on them.\n\nA team led by Balwantrai Mehta looked into why the program failed. They decided that each village needed an organization to choose the real people who needed help and carry out different government programs and plans. This organization would speak for the people and make sure their needs were met. Balwantrai Mehta wanted to create a system of local self-government in India. He believed that this would help villages develop and ensure that villagers had a say in how their communities were run.\n\nThe concept of local self-government was a good idea because it allowed for more decentralized democracy. This meant that decisions were made at the local level, rather than by the central government.\n\nRajasthan was the first state in India to adopt a three-levelled structure of panchayati raj. This meant that there were village-level, intermediate-level, and district-level panchayats.\n\nIn 1977, the Ashok Mehta Committee was set up to review how panchayats were working. The committee found that panchayats were important for democracy and should be given more power.\n\nThe panchayats that were formed after 1977 are called second-generation panchayats. In West Bengal, panchayats became more effective after the state accepted the suggestions made in the Ashok Mehta Committee report.\n\nIn the 1990s, it was realized that panchayats needed constitutional power in order to be truly effective. This led to the passing of the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Indian Constitution, which gave panchayats more power and autonomy.\n\nPanchayati Raj: A Simplified Explanation\n\nPanchayati Raj is a system of local self-government in India. It allows people in rural areas to make decisions and take action on issues that affect their lives.\n\nThe Panchayati Raj Act was passed in 1992 and became effective in 1993. It gives panchayats (village councils) the power to make decisions about things like education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nPanchayats are elected by the people who live in the village. They are responsible for making sure that the needs of the village are met.\n\nPanchayats work closely with the state government. The state government provides funding and support to panchayats, and it also oversees their activities.\n\nZonal Councils\n\nZonal councils are groups of states that work together to address common issues. There are five zonal councils in India:\n\nNorthern Zonal Council\n\nCentral Zonal Council\n\nEastern Zonal Council\n\nWestern Zonal Council\n\nSouthern Zonal Council\n\nZonal councils meet regularly to discuss issues such as economic development, infrastructure, and security. They also make recommendations to the central government on these issues.\n\nZones of India:\n\nNorthern Zone: This zone includes the states of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and the National Capital Region of Delhi.\n\nEastern Zone: This zone includes the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Orissa, Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Meghalaya.\n\nCentral Zone: This zone includes the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh.\n\nWestern Zone: This zone includes the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Goa.\n\nSouthern Zone: This zone includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala.\n\nFunctions of Zonal Councils:\n\nZonal councils are like discussion groups where member states can talk about things that are important to them all.\n\nThey give advice to member states on topics like social planning, transportation between states, economic planning, border disputes, and issues related to minorities.\n\nAttorney General of India:\n\nThe attorney general is the top lawyer for the government. They give the government legal advice.\n\nThe President of India can appoint a qualified Supreme Court judge as the Attorney General of India.\n\nThe Attorney General has the right to speak first in all courts in India.\n\nThe Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the President. However, since the Attorney General is appointed on the advice of the government, it is customary for the Attorney General to resign when the government changes.\n\nPolitical Process in India\n\nIndia is a democratic country with a parliamentary system of government.\n\nElections are held regularly to choose the members of the government, the two houses of Parliament, the state and union territory legislative assemblies, and the President and Vice President.\n\nThe decline of the Congress (I) party since the late 1980s has ended the dominance of a single party in Indian politics.\n\nIndia’s Political System\n\nBefore, India had a dominant single-party system, where the Congress party was very powerful.\n\nWithin the Congress party, there were often conflicts and disagreements, which were more important than conflicts between the Congress and other parties.\n\nThe Congress party decided what was important in politics, and other parties reacted to their decisions.\n\nBy 1989, India had a new political system where the Congress party was just one of many major parties.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the Congress party often responded to what other parties did instead of making their own decisions.\n\nGeneral Elections in India\n\nEvery 5 years, India holds one of the biggest and most complicated elections in the world.\n\nIn the 1990s, over 521 million voters went to nearly 6,00,000 polling stations to choose from almost 8950 candidates from about 162 different parties.\n\nThese elections show a lot about India and its people.\n\nPolitical Parties in India\n\nCandidates come from different backgrounds, such as former kings and queens, famous movie stars, religious leaders, war heroes, and more and more farmers.\n\nCampaigns use different ways to communicate, from modern video vans with two-way screens to the traditional way of spreading news by word of mouth.\n\nElections have also become more violent.\n\nIn 1991, about 350 people were killed in violence related to elections. This includes former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, 4 other candidates for Parliament, and 21 candidates running for state legislative assembly elections.\n\nChanges in India’s Party System\n\nIndia’s political party system is going through a big change.\n\nThe 1989 general elections ended the time when the Congress party was the most powerful.\n\nEven though the Congress (I) party won power again in 1991, it was no longer the most important party in the system.\n\nInstead, it was just one way to get a majority in politics, and it was becoming less popular. - The Congress (I) party was having trouble keeping its coalition of upper-caste elites, Muslims, scheduled castes, and scheduled tribes together.\n\nThe BJP was trying to form a new majority by appealing to Hindu nationalism.\n\nThe Janata Dal and the BSP were trying to form a new majority by appealing to the increasingly assertive backward classes, Dalits, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and religious minorities.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Arvind Kejriwal, was formed in 2013. In its first attempt at the Delhi Assembly polls in 2013, it became the second-largest party in the state and formed the government with the support of the Congress party.\n\nIndian Elections/Political System\n\nThe word “candidate” comes from the Latin word “candidatus,” which means “one clad in white.” Most candidates still wear white today.\n\nThe words “ballot” and “bullet” both come from words that mean “balls.”\n\nThe Greeks used to drop a white ball into a box to vote for someone. - The term ‘blackballed’ comes from this too.\n\nElectronic voting machines were first used in Kerala. They were designed by Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. and Bharat Electronics Ltd.\n\nAn electronic voting machine can support up to 64 candidates.\n\nIf there are more than 64 candidates, manual ballots are used.\n\nIn 1996, there were 1033 candidates running for a single seat in the Modaurichi assembly constituency in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe ballot paper was so long that it was made into a booklet!\n\nIn 1988, the Congress party did not win even a single seat in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nMayawati’s BSP and George W. Bush’s Republican Party both have the same electoral symbol - the elephant.\n\nThe lowest voter turnout in a polling station was three.\n\nThis happened in Bomdila district in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nIn the 1950s, elections were conducted using different ballot boxes for each candidate instead of voting on a ballot paper.\n\nDifferent coloured boxes represented different candidates.\n\nInteresting Facts about Indian Elections\n\nChhindwara in Madhya Pradesh is the only constituency in the Hindi-speaking region that has always elected a Congress candidate in general elections.\n\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee is the only politician to have won from six different constituencies: Balrampur, Gwalior, New Delhi, Vidisha, Gandhinagar, and Lucknow.\n\nHe is also the only parliamentarian to be elected from four different states: Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Delhi.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won Lok Sabha seats for the first time in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal in 1998.\n\nRajnandagaon in Madhya Pradesh has a unique feature: a father, mother, and son have represented this constituency at different times.\n\nThe highest voter turnout in any general election was 62.2% in 1957, while the lowest was in 1967 when only 33% of citizens cast their votes. India has a vast population that speaks over 1600 languages, making it difficult to choose a single national language.\n\nThe constitution decided that Hindi in Devanagari script would be the official language of the union. However, English was allowed to be used for all official purposes for 15 years from the start of the constitution.\n\nThis meant that Hindi and English were both official languages of the union until 1965. After that, the use of English for any purpose depended on what the parliament decided.\n\nThe parliament made a law called the Official Languages Act in 1963 to decide how Hindi and English would be used.\n\nThis law says that both Hindi and English must be used for certain things, like resolutions, orders, rules, notifications, press releases, reports, licenses, permits, contracts, and agreements.\n\nLanguage Policy in India\n\nEach state in India can choose its official language(s).\n\nThe president appoints special officers to protect the rights of linguistic minorities.\n\nThe Supreme Court and High Court use English as their official language.\n\nHow the Constitution Can Be Changed\n\nThere are three ways to change the constitution, depending on how important the change is.\n\nSome changes can be made with a simple majority vote in Parliament.\n\nMore important changes require a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Parliament.\n\nThe most important changes also require the approval of at least half of the state legislatures.\n\nChanges that affect the federal structure of the constitution can only be made with the approval of the states.\n\nOnly the central government can propose changes to the constitution. The constitution can be changed, but not in the following areas:\n\nFundamental rights\n\nTerritorial changes\n\nTransitional provisions\n\nDemocratic reforms\n\nThe democratic reforms include:"
