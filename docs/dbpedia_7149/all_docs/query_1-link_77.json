        "text": "New Delhi: In a landmark decision, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat has announced to free 51 temples and shrines including Badrinath, Kedarnath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri from government control.\n\nThe newly appointed CM has overturned the decision taken by his predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat.\n\n\"There will be a review on the decision of formation of Char Dham Devasthanam Board. State government's management over 51 prominent temples to be removed,\" he said.\n\nAround 51 shrines were under the direct control of the state government\n\nThe decision comes after major temples protested against the state takeover and registered their protest with the CM.\n\nAround 51 shrines were under the direct control of the state government after Governor Baby Rani Maurya gave her assent to the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Bill which was passed during the winter session of the Assembly.\n\nJustifying the passage of the new act, Trivendra Singh Rawat had said the new act will help in the professional management of the shrines.\n\nPriests and monks from the Himalayan state were furious with the BJP government for passing the law saying they have been managing the affairs of these temples for generations which were set up by their ancestors.\n\nPriest of the Gangotri shrine Rajnikant Semwal had even met Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).\n\n'This is called responsive government in a democracy'\n\nLater, the VHP had said that once the donation drive for the Ram Mandir is over they will hold meetings with the temple priests and form a strategy to counter the government.\n\nVHP's national joint secretary Surendra Jain had even alleged that donations received by the temple could be misused.\n\nBJP leader Subramanian Swamy lauded the state government's decision saying, \"So before I could argue the SLP I had filed on the Uttarakhand temple take-over issue the Government has withdrawn the Act and freed 51 temples. This is called responsive government in a democracy.\"\n\nThe BJP in its Tamil Nadu Election manifesto has promised to free temples from government control.\n\nWelcoming the announcement, VHP Central Secretary General Milind Parande said it is not the function of any government to control temples or interfere in the day-to-day affairs of its wealth or management."
