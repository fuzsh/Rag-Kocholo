        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAjay Tamta, newly elected from Uttarakhand's Lok Sabha constituency, expressed gratitude for being inducted into PM Modi's ministerial team, highlighting his past political journey and victories.\n\nNewly elected member from Uttarakhand's Lok Sabha constituency Ajay Tamta on Sunday said that he feels \"fortunate\" to be inducted into the new ministerial team of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTamta who attended a high tea hosted at the 7 Lok Kalyan Marg residence of the Prime Minister earlier today told ANI, \"I feel fortunate to get the opportunity to work with the Prime Minister. For this, I thank BJP, all the voters of my constituency and the Prime Minister...Whatever work I get, I will contribute to taking that work forward with all my strength...\"\n\nWhen asked if he had any specific demands for a ministry, Tamta responded, \"Earlier also, I have got the opportunity to work for different ministries. Even before 2019, I got the opportunity to work with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\"\n\nIn response to opposition claims of a \"bad NDA government,\" Tamta stated, \"I don't find it necessary to respond to the opposition. Our party, our allies, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are all committed to our work.\"\n\nIn the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Tamta won from the Almora reserved parliamentary seat against Congress party's Pradeep Tamta with a margin of 234,097 votes.\n\nStarting his political journey at the young age of 23, Tamta has contested nine elections and secured victory in six, solidifying his position in politics.\n\nHis political career began in 1996 when he was elected as a district panchayat member and subsequently became the district panchayat vice-president in the same year.\n\nIn 2002, Tamta ran as an independent candidate for the Someshwar seat in the Assembly elections but did not win. However, in 2007, he contested again on a BJP ticket and successfully entered the Dehradun Assembly.\n\nIn 2009, he made his first attempt at the Lok Sabha elections but narrowly missed victory. He achieved his first legislative success in 2012, winning the Assembly seat from Someshwar. Recognizing his potential, the party nominated him for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where he won. He repeated his success in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with a record margin.\n\nTamta has served as a member of the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly, from 2007 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2014. He has also served as a Minister in the Government of Uttarakhand, as the Cabinet Minister during 2008 - 2009 and as Minister of State during 2007-2008.\n\nHe served as the Union Minister of State for Textiles in the first Modi government.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nThree reasons why Tata Motors has taken a contrarian view on hybrids\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
