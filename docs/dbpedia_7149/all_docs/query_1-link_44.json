After losing to Pradeep Tamta in 2009, Ajay Tamta defeated him in the next three general elections, in 2014, 2019 and 2024.\n\nAjay Tamta has also been an MLA from the Someshwar seat of Almora district twice - in 2007 and 2012. He was also the horticulture minister in the Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri government in 2007.\n\nHe entered politics at the age of 23, and remained active at the Panchayat level for many years.\n\nHis image has been that of a simple, clean and controversy-free politician. Apart from friendly behaviour with workers at the organisational level, he has maintained his popular image among the public."
