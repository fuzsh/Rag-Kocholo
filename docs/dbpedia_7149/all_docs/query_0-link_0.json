The Indian National Congress Chief Minister Harish Rawat replaced Vijay Bahuguna as the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand on 2014. After a political crisis in 2016, the President's rule was imposed ending his tenure as the Chief Minister when 9 rebel Congress MLAs withdrew their support to the Harish Rawat government. On 13 July 2016, Uttarakhand High Court lifted the President's rule and reinstated the Harish Rawat government. Next day the Supreme Court of India stayed the High Court's order and the President's rule was imposed again that lasted till May. In May, Harish Rawat government was once again reinstalled and the rebel MLAs were suspended by the Speaker on the grounds of defection.\n\nElectionwise composition of Assembly\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Elections in Uttarakhand\n\nUttarakhand Legislative Assembly year-wise election results Party Year 2022\n\nElections 2017\n\nElections 2012\n\nElections 2007\n\nElections 2002\n\nElections Bahujan Samaj Party 02 – 03 08 07 Bharatiya Janata Party 47 57 31 35 19 Indian National Congress 19 11 32 21 36 Nationalist Congress Party – – – – 01 Uttarakhand Kranti Dal[A] – – 01 03 04 Independent 02 02 03 03 03 Total Seats 70 70 70 70 70\n\nList of Assemblies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is the list of all the Uttarakhand Legislative Assemblies[2]\n\nAssembly Election Year Speaker Chief Minister Party Opposition Leader Party Interim Assembly N/A Prakash Pant Nityanand Swami\n\n(2000–01) Bharatiya\n\nJanata\n\nParty Vacant N/A Bhagat Singh Koshyari\n\n(2001–02) 1st Assembly 2002 Yashpal Arya Narayan Datt Tiwari Indian\n\nNational\n\nCongress Bhagat Singh Koshyari\n\n(2002–03) Bharatiya\n\nJanata\n\nParty Matbar Singh Kandari\n\n(2003–07) 2nd Assembly 2007 Harbans Kapoor Bhuwan Chandra Khanduri\n\n(2007–09) Bharatiya\n\nJanata\n\nParty Harak Singh Rawat Indian\n\nNational\n\nCongress Ramesh Pokhriyal\n\n(2009–11) Bhuwan Chandra Khanduri\n\n(2011–12) 3rd Assembly 2012 Govind Singh Kunjwal Vijay Bahuguna\n\n(2012–14) Indian\n\nNational\n\nCongress Ajay Bhatt Bharatiya\n\nJanata\n\nParty Harish Rawat\n\n(2014–17) 4th Assembly 2017 Premchand Aggarwal Trivendra Singh Rawat\n\n(2017–21) Bharatiya\n\nJanata\n\nParty Indira Hridayesh\n\n(2017–21) Indian\n\nNational\n\nCongress Tirath Singh Rawat\n\n(2021) Pushkar Singh Dhami Pritam Singh\n\n(2021–22) 5th Assembly 2022 Ritu Khanduri Bhushan Yashpal Arya\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nA In the 2012 Assembly election, Uttarakhand Kranti Dal contested as \"Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (P)\" led by then party president Trivendra Singh Panwar.
