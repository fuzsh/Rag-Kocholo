        "text": "Promoting Literacy in Cox’s Bazar (UNICEF and World Food Program)\n\nProject Dates: January 2018 – 2020\n\nUNICEF is funding a project in Bangladesh, where Room to Read will work with the Rohingya refugee community in Cox’s Bazar. This project will focus on assessing the literacy levels of children attending learning centers and design an intervention that includes the development of supplementary materials and story books as well as classroom-based assessment. The World Food Program is funding our literacy interventions in the host community outside of the refugee camp.\n\nImproving literacy skills and fostering a habit of reading for the nation’s children\n\nProject Dates: 2015-2018\n\nIn 2015, we began a three-year partnership with Grenada’s Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development and Grenada Schools Inc., a local nonprofit, to improve early grade literacy. The goal of the project was to design a wide-reaching, cost-effective and sustainable program that builds foundational literacy skills and a habit of reading among primary school students. The project impacted all 57 of Grenada's government primary schools by improving the country's Grade 1 literacy curriculum. In addition, we conducted library training for schools and our local partner. We also built the capacity of local authors and illustrators to create quality low-cost children’s titles in- country and published 13 original children’s titles. Through this partnership, we impacted an estimated 11,000 students and thousands more will benefit in the future as new generations of students enter the school system.\n\nScaling Up Early Reading Interventions (SERI) (USAID)\n\nProject Dates: 2015-2019\n\nThe Scaling Up Early Learning Intervention Project (SERI) is a five-year USAID-funded project that focuses on literacy in government primary schools. This project has two components – the establishment of “model” schools whereby Room to Read implements our reading instruction program, and “partnership” schools to which Room to Read provides technical assistance to the state and local governments to implement the literacy program. The states of Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand are implementing both “model” schools and “partnership” schools through this project. More than 136,000 children in 1,360 schools are benefiting from this project.\n\nEarly Grade Literacy in Madhya Pradesh (UNICEF)\n\nProject Dates: August 2018 – July 2021\n\nRoom to Read is implementing our Early Grade Literacy Program in Madhya Pradesh within 10 demonstration schools and providing technical assistance for 512 primary schools. This will reach approximately 25,600 children and train over 1,024 teachers through 34 master trainers.\n\nGirls’ Education in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan (IKEA)\n\nProject Dates: July 2018 – March 2021\n\nRoom to Read is conducting a Girls’ Education Program demonstration and scaling project in the states of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. The aim of the project is to reach 68,700 girls in the target states through both direct implementation and technical assistance.\n\nPromote Early grade literacy in Chhattisgarh (UNICEF)\n\nProject Dates: November 2018 – December 2019\n\nRoom to Read is expanding our Early Grade Literacy Program in Chhattisgarh to build off previous scaling activities within the state.\n\nScaling school libraries and local book publishing (IKEA Foundation)\n\nProject Dates: 2014-May 2019\n\nRoom to Read’s second custom project in Indonesia is focused on training local organizations on local book publishing and school libraries. This project, supported by the IKEA Foundation, scales the program initiated during a two-year project supported by individuals and local foundations convened by Credit Suisse. Working in the three regions of Indonesia (East Java, Bali and East Nusa Tenggara) Room to Read is training three local NGOs to establish, monitor, and sustain school libraries. These partners are establishing 145 libraries through this project that will benefit more than 30,000 children. Local book publishing is also a focus of the project. We are training five publishing and NGO partners on the book development process. Through this project, 60 new early grade storybooks in Bahasa Indonesia are being published and at least 420,000 copies distributed.\n\nDigital Library: More Reading, More Learning (Google.org)\n\nProject Dates: 2017-2020\n\nRoom to Read’s three-year project, supported by Google.org, aims to support a culture of reading in Indonesia by creating a digital platform that combines literacy professional development videos and children’s stories. The goal of the project entitled Digital Library: More Reading, More Learning is to build a platform that will provide access to high-quality digital storybooks, videos to guide teachers in conducting effective reading activities with children, and support for local writers and illustrators to develop more culturally relevant and age-appropriate children’s books. Through the platform, by July 2020, the project aims to reach at least 2,100 teachers, 500 writers and illustrators, and over 200,000 students across a minimum of 15 districts of Indonesia.\n\nDeveloping and distributing storybooks in Arabic\n\nProject Date: 2017\n\nRoom to Read’s custom project in Jordan worked with three local publishing partners and over 40 authors and illustrators in Jordan to develop 20 titles in Arabic and distribute 600,000 copies to neediest communities and schools serving refugee and Jordanian children. Room to Read worked closely with the Jordanian publishers Dar Al Yasmine, Jabal Amman and Majdalawi Masterpieces to increase their capacity to publish high quality children’s books. The publishers participated in and facilitated portions of the Room to Read’s workshops for authors and illustrators in Amman over the course of 2017. They worked closely with Room to Read during the book editing process, building their skills and understanding of best practices in book design. Books were distributed widely throughout the country. Every public primary school in Jordan received four copies of title. Books were also distributed to refugee camps, orphanages, municipality libraries and NGOs working in remote and underserved communities throughout the country. The project was generously supported by Dubai Cares as part of the UAE’s Reading Nation Campaign.\n\nReading Materials (BEQUAL)\n\nProject Dates: April 2018 – June 2019\n\nRtR LA is supporting the development of national pre-service and in-service teacher training materials for Grade 1 and 2 literacy instruction as part of the BEQUAL project in Laos. As a result, RtR’s training methods and best practices will be implemented nation-wide with the roll out of a revised national reading curriculum.\n\nImprove early grade literacy among non-Lao speaking students (USAID and Save the Children)\n\nProject Dates: August 2018 – May 2023\n\nWe are improving early grade reading skills for preschool, grade one and grade two children with a focus on non-Lao speaking students. This project is being implement in two southern provinces and will reach 65,313 children.\n\nLiteracy initiative supports children in crisis in Lebanon\n\nProject Launch: 2022\n\nMillions of children in Lebanon have been out of school, and many of those children are refugees. To strengthen children’s literacy skills and reading habits in Lebanon and support the transition of out-of-school children into the formal school system, Room to Read launched a two-year project that includes partnering with Lebanese publishers to print and distribute 60 original Arabic storybooks to roughly 1,800 non-formal education centers across Lebanon.\n\nThe initiative also entails establishing 50 children’s libraries in non-formal education centers, benefiting approximately 50,000 children and supporting early-grade literacy development in coordination with local efforts.\n\nStrengthening the indigenous language storybook industry - Reach for Reading (World Bank)\n\nProject dates: August 2017 – August 2019\n\nThis two-year project is in partnership with USAID and the Global Book Alliance, and it is Room to Read’s first project funded by the World Bank. The project will facilitate a public-private partnership to develop national quality guidelines and create and distribute storybooks in support of the existing government Read to Lead campaign (2015-2019). As part of this broader initiative in fostering systemic change, ~20-25 early grade storybook titles (Print and Digital Versions) will be developed in 5 languages: isiZulu, Tshivenda, Siswati, Xitsonga, Sepedi.\n\nImproving reading for children in Rwanda (USAID and Chemonics)\n\nProject Dates: 2016-2021\n\nRoom to Read is developing early-grade reading materials in Kinyarwanda, building the capacity of Rwandan book publishers to develop these materials, and building the capacity of Rwandan teachers to use these materials in classrooms as part of this five-year national Rwandan early-grade reading project called Soma Umenye (“Read and Know”) funded by USAID. Room to Read also plays a leading role in designing and implementing research to demonstrate results and identify best practices.\n\nHelping to Close the Children's Book Gap in Uganda\n\nIn 2020, our literacy team set out to identify gaps in the Ugandan book supply chain and strategize ways to close those gaps. We then partnered with the Reading Association of Uganda early in 2021 and together, we distributed 35,000 Room to Read storybooks, translated into Luganda, to primary schools across the country.\n\nWhile the initial distribution of translated titles marked an important first step in closing gaps in available and accessible children’s books in Uganda, we know that young learners need stories developed in their own countries and in their local languages — stories that reflect their own cultures, histories and lived experiences — to develop a true lifelong love and habit of reading. To that end, Room to Read is currently collaborating with Ugandan authors, illustrators, book creators and publishers to develop our first ever collection of original storybooks in the country."
