        "text": "Reproduced from the ‘News Watch’ of National Geography\n\nFebruary 28, 2012: Everest guide Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and extreme kayaker Sano Babu Sunuwar were named the People’s Choice Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their climb to Everest’s summit, record-setting paragliding descent and long-distance kayak from Nepal to the Bay of Bengal in India, the National Geographic Society said today.\n\nThe two Nepali adventurers were selected from a group of 12 individuals whose extraordinary achievements in exploration, conservation and adventure sports distinguished them in the past year, National Geographic said in a news statement. The final selection was done through the online voting on the National Geographic Adventure website.\n\nOn May 21, 2011, Babu (pilot) and Lakpa (passenger) launched a tandem paraglider from the summit of Mount Everest. They were only the third group to do so. For the men, this was the highlight of the entire expedition—a dream comes true to fly above the Khumbu Glacier.

Along the way, Babu, 28, and Lakpa, 39, faced obstacles ranging from extreme temperatures and oxygen deprivation at the summit to massive whirlpools on the Kosi River’s class V rapids to being held up at knifepoint in India.\n\n“We weren’t after a record, we just wanted to do all these things, climbing, paragliding, kayaking, in one continuous trip,” said Lakpa. When asked about his favorite part of the trip, Babu said, “Taking off from the highest point in the world.”\n\n“We believe that Lakpa and Babu exemplify the spirit of the award in their commitment to adventure in the truest sense of the word,” said Mary Anne Potts, editor of National Geographic Adventure. “Our fans — more than 72,000 across the adventure community — voted overwhelmingly for these two incredible athletes, and we’re thrilled to call them the People’s Choice Adventurers of the Year.”\n\nThe feats of each of this year’s nominees embody pioneering innovation — from reinventing distance hiking and circumnavigating frigid Ellesmere Island to skiing the Andes on human power and launching a backyard micro adventure movement. The other nominees were:\n\nJennifer Pharr Davis — American hiker\n\nAlastair Humphreys — British adventurer\n\nGerlinde Kaltenbrunner — Austrian mountaineer\n\nDanny MacAskill — Scottish cyclist\n\nCarissa Moore — American surfer\n\nTravis Rice — American snowboarder\n\nCory Richards — American mountaineer-photographer\n\nJon Turk and Erik Boomer — American kayakers\n\nNick Waggoner — American skier-filmmaker\n\nNational Geographic has named Adventurers of the Year for the past seven years. In 2011-2012, National Geographic Adventure partnered with Glenfiddich Single Malt to present the award. “We are delighted to partner with National Geographic on this exciting program,” said Lindsay Prociw, senior brand manager for Glenfiddich, the Society’s news release. “Both Glenfiddich and National Geographic are pioneers within their industries, and, as we gear up to celebrate our respective 125th anniversaries, we are honored to be able to celebrate and reward those who are keeping the spirit of a pioneer alive. We salute Lakpa and Babu on this award as well as on their pioneering achievement, and are proud to be honoring them for it.”\n\nhttp://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/02/28/everest-paragliding-and-kayaking-pair-named-national-geographic-adventurers-of-the-year/?source=newsmain_aoty"
