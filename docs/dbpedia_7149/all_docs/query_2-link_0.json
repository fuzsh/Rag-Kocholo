Members are elected/nominated in the legislature and are delegated duties to perform various functions.\n\nThe terms, ‘Unicameral’ and ‘Bicameral’ have often confused IAS Exam aspirants hence, this article will help candidates understand the basic differences between these two.\n\nDifference between Unicameral and Bicameral Legislature PDF:- Download PDF Here\n\nThe article will aid candidates’ preparation for UPSC Prelims and Mains GS-II Polity section as it talks about the basic terms used in Political Science subjects often.\n\nImprove your chances of cracking the IAS Exam by attempting the CSAT Mock Tests now!!\n\nCandidates can check the following links to strengthen their UPSC preparation:\n\nLearn from IAS Toppers\n\nGS 1 Structure Strategy and Syllabus\n\nGS 2 Structure Strategy and Syllabus\n\nGS 3 Structure Strategy and Syllabus\n\nGS 4 Structure Strategy and Syllabus\n\nTopic-wise GS 1 Questions for UPSC Mains\n\nTopic-wise GS 2 Questions for UPSC Mains\n\nTopic-wise GS 3 Questions for UPSC Mains\n\nPolity Questions for UPSC Mains\n\nGovernance Questions for UPSC Mains\n\nStay updated with Current Affairs\n\nDownload UPSC Notes PDF (Free)\n\nDownload NCERT Notes PDF (Free)\n\nWhat is Unicameral Legislature?\n\nIt is a form of legislature where only one house (one central unit) exists to make and implement laws for the state/country. To understand it clearly, let’s categorize it into two parts:\n\nUnicameral National Legislature\n\nIn the case of Unicameral Union Parliament, the first example can be given of the country China where the National People’s Congress is the national legislature and is the highest organ of the nation. There is no other organ in China which administers laws for the country. A few other examples of the nations that have Unicameral National Legislatures are:\n\nIran\n\nNorway\n\nSweden\n\nHungary\n\nUnicameral State Legislature\n\nIn the case of the unicameral state legislature, Indian states are best examples to understand. Aspirants might know that in India, a few states’ parliaments are unicameral in nature i.e. they have only one house to make a law. In states, these are called as ‘legislative assemblies.’\n\nOut of 28 Indian States, there are 24 states which have a unicameral structure. The list of these states are given below:\n\nArunachal Pradesh\n\nAssam\n\nChhattisgarh\n\nDelhi\n\nGoa\n\nGujarat\n\nHaryana\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nJharkhand\n\nKerala\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nManipur\n\nMeghalaya\n\nMizoram\n\nNagaland\n\nOdisha\n\nPuducherry\n\nPunjab\n\nRajasthan\n\nSikkim\n\nTamil Nadu\n\nTripura\n\nUttarakhand\n\nWest Bengal\n\nCandidates can check out the following relevant links to prepare for the upcoming UPSC Civil Services exam comprehensively –\n\nParliament and State Legislature [UPSC Polity Notes] State Legislature – Powers & Functions Difference between Legislative Assembly Difference between State and Union Territory Ordinance Meaning, Power of President & Governor Office Of Profit Lapsing of bills – Rule of Lapse in Parliament Chief Minister & Council of Ministers Functions of Parliament in India Separation of Powers Difference between Legislative and Executive in India Union Executive & State Executive How a Bill is Passed in Indian Parliament Parliamentary Committees Rajya Sabha – Members, Chairman, Elections\n\nWhat is Bicameral Legislature?\n\nIt is a legislative body with two houses. India is one such example where there are two houses both at union and also at 6 of its 28 states. In a bicameral legislature, the function to administer and implement the laws are shared between the two houses.\n\nAt the central level, the Indian Parliament has two houses:\n\nLok Sabha (Lower House)\n\nRajya Sabha (Upper House)\n\nTo know the difference between Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, check the linked article.\n\nAt the state level, six of the 28 state legislatures have two houses:\n\nLegislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha)\n\nLegislative Council (Vidhan Parishad)\n\nThe names of the six states having bicameral legislature are:\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nBihar\n\nKarnataka\n\nMaharashtra\n\nTelangana\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nBasic Differences between Unicameral and Bicameral\n\nThe differences that aspirants should know between the two for UPSC 2022 are given in the table below:\n\nDifference between Unicameral and Bicameral Difference Unicameral Bicameral Number of House One Two Sharing of Power Concentrated in one house Shared between two houses System of Government Unitary Federal Decision-Making Flexible and efficient as bills are introduced and passed in only a single house Time-Consuming as both the houses have to pass the bill hence, their approval is a tedious task\n\n(To know more on how a bill is passed in Indian Parliament, check the linked article)\n\nDeadlock Rare to None Common as the two houses can disagree on a bill hence, a deadlock appears which is sorted with the help of joint sitting Members Elected/Nominated Elected/Nominated\n\nAspirants should understand that unicameralism is mostly followed in countries or states having smaller sizes against bicameralism which appears in larger countries and states.\n\nDifference between Unicameral and Bicameral Legislature PDF:- Download PDF Here\n\nCandidates can find out what are the topics in the UPSC Exams by visiting the UPSC Syllabus page.
