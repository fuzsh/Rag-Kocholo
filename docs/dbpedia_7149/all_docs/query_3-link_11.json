The team included NCCD's Chief Operating Officer Sh.Asheesh Fotedar with Sh.PRITAM SARKAR and Sh.Rahul Garjola. We were there to witness the impressive 10 MT solar cold rooms installed by GiZ and Inficold at the Centre of Excellence. Accompanying us were experts in the field, Mr.Nitin Goel from Inficold and Mr.Sashi Kumar from Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH whose insights and expertise significantly enriched our visit. These innovative solar cold rooms represent a significant step forward in sustainable cold chain solutions. After our tour, we engaged in fruitful discussions with the personnel working in the horticulture division about the further development and broader application of such technology. The potential for these solar cold rooms to revolutionize the cold chain industry, especially in the horticulture sector, is immense. We are excited about the future possibilities and collaborations that will emerge from this visit. A big thank you to everyone involved in making this visit a success! #NCCD #ColdChain #Sustainability #Horticulture #SolarColdRooms #Innovation #Collaboration #Inficold #GiZ #FutureOfColdChain\n\nBureau of Indian Standards and CII-IQ welcomes you join for the upcoming ‚ÄúInternational Standards Summit‚Äù where we discuss about standards ‚Äì Ensuring Excellence, Adaptation and Transformation to achieve SDG for Energy Sector on 4 and 5 July 2024 at Taj Yeshwantpur Register Now: https://lnkd.in/g28JFppe or send your nominations to mamta.rai@cii.in"
