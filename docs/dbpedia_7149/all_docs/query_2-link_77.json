Which one of the following suggested that the Governor should be an eminent person from outside the State and should be a detached figure without intense political links or should not have taken part in politics in the recent past?\n\n(a) First Administrative Reforms Commission (1966)\n\n(b) Rajamannar Committee (1969)\n\n(c) Sarkaria Commission (1983)\n\n(d) National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2000)\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now"
