Mr Bagauli, who also served as Secretary to the Chief Minister, was directed to step down from his role as Home Secretary along with counterparts from five other states.\n\nDilip Jawalkar, currently serving as Secretary of Finance, has been selected to assume the responsibilities of Home Secretary in Uttarakhand. The Election Commission’s directive on Monday mandated the removal of home secretaries who held concurrent positions in their respective chief minister’s offices, aiming to prevent potential conflicts of interest during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections."
