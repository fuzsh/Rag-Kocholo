        "text": "The State Legislature stands as a cornerstone of India’s federal structure, embodying the democratic ethos and principles of governance within each state. Aspiring civil servants preparing for the UPSC examination delve into the intricate workings of the State Legislature through meticulously curated NCERT notes. These notes serve as indispensable guides, offering a comprehensive understanding of the constitutional framework, legislative procedures, and the pivotal role played by the State Legislature in shaping policies and laws at the state level. With a focus on Indian Polity, these UPSC NCERT notes unravel the nuances of state governance, empowering aspirants with the knowledge necessary to navigate the complexities of public administration and contribute meaningfully to the nation’s development.\n\nThe Constitution grants states the flexibility to establish either a unicameral or bicameral legislature, outlined in Articles 168 to 212 in Part V of the Constitution, which addresses the organization, composition, duration, officers, procedures, privileges, powers, and more of the State Legislature.\n\nAs per Article 168 of the Indian Constitution, each state is mandated to have a legislature, consisting of the Governor and either one or two Houses of the Legislature.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nOrganization and Composition of State Legislature\n\nArticle 168 of the Constitution stipulates the establishment of a legislature for each state.\n\nStates with a unicameral system have only the Vidhan Sabha, while those with a bicameral system have both the Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad.\n\nSix states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, feature a Legislative Council.\n\nThe Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council was dismantled in 2019 following the enactment of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, which transformed the state into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.\n\nState Legislature\n\nGovernor Legislative Council Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Parishad) (Vidhan Sabha)\n\nLegislative Council\n\nThe role of the Legislative Council in a state mirrors that of the Rajya Sabha at the Union level.\n\nThis similarity extends to matters such as privileges and immunities of legislatures, member disqualification, the relationship between the two Houses, legislative procedures, the origination of Money Bills, and more.\n\nComposition of the Council\n\nThe Legislative Council’s maximum strength is set at one-third of the total assembly strength, with a minimum of 40 members. Members are elected using the system of proportional representation through the Single Transferable Vote, as outlined in Clause (3) of Article 171.\n\nAccording to Article 171(3):\n\nOne-third of the members are elected by electorates comprising members of municipalities, district boards, and other specified local authorities.\n\nOne-twelfth are elected by electorates consisting of residents who have been graduates for at least three years or possess qualifications equivalent to a graduate.\n\nAnother one-twelfth are elected by electorates comprising individuals engaged in teaching for at least three years in educational institutions of a standard not lower than that of a secondary school\n\nThe remaining one-sixth are nominated by the Governor and should have special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement, and social service.\n\nLegislative Assembly\n\nThe Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) serves as the Lower House of the State Legislature, analogous to the Lok Sabha at the national level.\n\nIt represents the will of the state’s people, with members directly elected by the public.\n\nComposition of the Assembly\n\nArticle 170(1) stipulates that each state’s Legislative Assembly shall consist of not more than 500 and not less than 60 members, chosen through direct election from territorial constituencies in the state.\n\nExceptions include Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Goa, where the minimum is fixed at 30, Mizoram at 40, and Nagaland at 46.\n\nQualifications for the Houses\n\nAccording to Article 173, an individual is eligible to be chosen to fill a seat in the Legislature of a state if they are a citizen of India and meet the age requirement of not less than 25 years for the Legislative Assembly and not less than 30 years for the Legislative Council.\n\nPossesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament\n\nLegislative Assemblies and Legislative Councils in States/UTs\n\nDisqualifications of the Houses:\n\nUnder the Constitution, a person shall be disqualified for being chosen as and for being a member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State if:\n\nHe holds any office of profit under the Union or State Government (except that of a minister or any other office exempted by State Legislature).\n\nHe is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a court.\n\nHe is an undischarged insolvent.\n\nHe is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign state or is under any acknowledgment of allegiance to a foreign state.\n\nHe is so disqualified under any law made by Parliament.\n\nAccording to Article 191(2), a person shall be disqualified for being a member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State if he is disqualified under the Anti-Defection Law of the Tenth Schedule.\n\nDuration of State Legislature:\n\nDuration of Assembly:\n\nLegislative Assembly of every state, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer.\n\nIf a proclamation of emergency is in operation, the term of the assembly can be extended by Parliament by law for a period not exceeding one year at a time and not extending in any case beyond a period of six months after the proclamation has ceased to operate.\n\nDuration of Council:\n\nLike the Rajya Sabha, the Legislative Council is a continuing chamber, i.e., it is a permanent body and is not subject to dissolution.\n\nHowever, one-third of its members retire on the expiration of every second year, continuing as members for six years.\n\nVacant seats are filled up by fresh elections and nominations every third year, with retiring members being eligible for the next term.\n\nOath, Affirmation, and Salaries:\n\nEvery member of either House of the State Legislature, before taking their seat, has to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation before the Governor.\n\nOath of a State Legislature Member:\n\nIn the oath, a member of the State Legislature solemnly affirms:\n\nTo bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India.\n\nTo uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India.\n\nTo faithfully discharge the duty of their office.\n\nWithout taking this oath, a member cannot vote, participate in the proceedings, or be eligible for the privileges and immunities of the State Legislature.\n\nSalaries and Allowances:\n\nThe salaries and allowances of State Legislature members are determined by the State Legislature.\n\nVacation of Assembly Seat (Under Article 190):\n\nNo Double Membership:\n\nA person cannot be a member of both Houses of the Legislature of a State.

After reconsideration, the President is not obligated to assent.\n\nState Funds:\n\nConsolidated Fund of the State (Article 266(1)): All government revenues and recovered loan amounts are deposited in the Consolidated Fund.\n\nState Finances:\n\nAfter State Legislature approval, government expenses are covered by this fund.\n\nState Public Account:\n\nAs per Article 266(2), other public funds received by or on behalf of the State Government are deposited in the state’s public accounts.\n\nState Contingency Fund:\n\nUnder Article 267, a fund for contingency expenditure is established.

Comprising the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council (where applicable), it ensures representation of the people in decision-making processes. The State Legislature also holds the state government accountable through debates, discussions, and questioning, thereby contributing to the democratic governance of the state.\n\nQ2: What is the composition of the State Legislature according to the Indian Constitution?\n\nA2: The State Legislature consists of two houses – the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly is the lower house and is directly elected by the people through general elections. The Legislative Council, on the other hand, is the upper house and is not present in all states. Members of the Legislative Council are elected by various constituencies, including graduates, teachers, and local authority members. The composition may vary from state to state.\n\nQ3: How does the State Legislature exercise its legislative powers?\n\nA3: The State Legislature, like the Parliament at the national level, exercises its legislative powers through a process of bill introduction, debate, and voting. Members of the State Legislature propose bills, which can be of various types, such as money bills, ordinary bills, and constitutional amendment bills. These bills go through readings, committee scrutiny, and discussions before being voted upon. If a bill is approved by a majority, it is sent to the Governor for assent, after which it becomes law. The State Legislature also has the power to amend the state constitution, subject to the overall framework of the Indian Constitution.\n\nIn case you still have your doubts, contact us on 9811333901.\n\nFor UPSC Prelims Resources, Click here\n\nFor Daily Updates and Study Material:\n\nJoin our Telegram Channel – Edukemy for IAS\n\n1.
