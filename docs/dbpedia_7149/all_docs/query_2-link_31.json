        "text": "üèõÔ∏è What is Bicameral Legislature? - A bicameral legislature is a legislative system consisting of two separate assemblies, chambers, or houses. For example, the Indian Parliament consists of two houses: Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. - The State Legislative Council (MLCs), also known as Vidhan Parishad, serves as the upper house in Indian states with a bicameral state legislature, while the lower house is the State Legislative Assembly (MLAs). - Out of the 36 states and UTs in India, 25 have a unicameral legislature, 6 have a bicameral legislature, and the remaining 5 are UTs without a legislature. - The 6 states with a legislative council are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. However, no UT has a legislative council. üìú Qualifications & Tenure of Members Members of a State Legislative Council (MLCs) must be: - Citizens of India. - At least 30 years old. - Mentally sound and not insolvent. - Enrolled voters of the respective state. - MLCs cannot simultaneously hold positions as Members of Parliament and Members of the State Legislative Assembly. - MLCs serve a tenure of 6 years and are not subject to dissolution. Every 2 years, 1/3 of the members retire, following a pattern similar to the Rajya Sabha. Composition - The size of the State Legislative Council cannot exceed 1/3rd of the membership of the State Legislative Assembly, but it cannot have fewer than 40 members. - MLCs elect the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the State Legislative Council. üó≥Ô∏è Selection of MLCs 1. 1/3rd are elected by members of local bodies, including municipalities, Gram panchayats, Panchayat samitis, and district councils. 2. 1/3rd are elected by members of the State Legislative Assembly from individuals who are not members of the Assembly. 3. 1/6th are nominated by the Governor from persons with knowledge or practical experience in fields such as literature, science, arts, cooperative movement, and social services. 4. 1/12th are elected by persons who are graduates with at least three years' standing and reside in the respective state. 5. 1/12th are elected by teachers who have spent a minimum of three years teaching in educational institutions within the state, including secondary schools, colleges, and universities. üèõÔ∏è Creation & Abolition of State Legislative Councils - According to Article 169 of the Indian Constitution, the Parliament of India can create or abolish a State Legislative Council if the state's legislature passes a resolution with a special majority.
