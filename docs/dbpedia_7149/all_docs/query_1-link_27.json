        "text": "Senior BJP leader and Lok Sabha MP from Pauri, Tirath Singh Rawat, on Wednesday evening took oath as the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand. Governor Baby Rani Maurya administered him the oath of office and secrecy at the Raj Bhawan in Dehradun. Rawat comes from a staunch Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) background. Despite playing an important role in the Sangh and the BJP's organisational structure for a long time, he is a leader who believes in keeping a low profile, staying away from the limelight. He served as a full-time RSS worker for a period of five years. He was the first Education Minister of Uttarakhand after the state assumed its new, separate entity.\n\nRawat, 56, has done post-graduation in Sociology from Birla College, Srinagar, Garhwal in Uttarakhand and also holds a PG diploma in the field of journalism. His wife is a college lecturer by profession.\n\nRawat was born on April 9, 1964 in Seeron village of Pauri Garhwal. He joined the Sangh's student organisation, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) during his student days. From 1983 to 1988, he took up the responsibility of being a full-time RSS worker.\n\nHe then entered mainstream politics with the BJP. In 1997, when Uttarakhand was a part of undivided Uttar Pradesh, he was elected a Member of Legislative Council. After the formation of Uttarakhand as a separate state, he became the first Education Minister of the hill state in 2000 under the BJP dispensation. Rawat became the BJP's Uttarakhand state General Secretary in 2007. He also served as the Chairman of the Uttarakhand Natural Disaster Management Advisory Committee. In 2012, he became an MLA from Chaubattakhal Assembly constituency in Uttarakhand. At the same time, the BJP's national leadership made him the state president of the Uttarakhand BJP in 2013 due to his expertise in building the organisation. The saffron party had fielded him from the Garhwal constituency during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and he won the election by a margin of more than 2.85 lakh votes.\n\nThe BJP's decision to change its Chief Minister in Uttarakhand comes just a year before the hilly state goes to polls.\n\nUttarakhand government formation Highlights\n\nPM Modi congratulates Tirath Singh Rawat\n\nPrime Minister Narnedra Modi on Wednesday congratulated Tirath Singh Rawat on being sworn in as the new Chief Minister of Uttrakhand.\n\nTirath Singh Rawat takes oath as CM\n\nBJP leader Tirath Singh Rawat sworn in as new chief minister of Uttarakhand.\n\nTirath Singh Rawat thanks BJP leadership\n\nTirath Rawat thanked the party for giving him an opportunity to serve the state. \"I had never thought that I would get such an opportunity.

Currently, Tirath is a Lok Sabha member from Pauri parliamentary seat.\n\nWho is Tirath Singh Rawat?\n\nTirath Singh Rawat served as the chief of Uttarakhand BJP from February 2013 to December 2015.
