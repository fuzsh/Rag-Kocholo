        "text": "Synopsis\n\nState government of Uttarakhand showering MLAs with amenities from public funds to stop them raise voice against party,says opposition BJP leader.\n\nDEHRADUN: BJP leader Ajay Bhatt has alleged that the Uttarakhand government is using public funds to \"facilitate\" their MLAs with MP-level amenities to not let them raise voice against the party's non-working attitude.\n\nBhatt, leader of opposition in the state assembly said that Congress party has facilitated their MLA Shailarani Rawat, of Kedarnath constituency, with MP level amenities as she had recently made a remark against her own party accepting that Congress has done no welfare work, and that she'll resign if it continues.\n\n\"Shailarani Rawat's remarks have proved our allegations correct. Even after more than a year, skeletons are being found in the Kedarnath area and the government has done no rehabilitation work here,\" Bhatt said.\n\nThe Congress rather than taking up welfare works in the area has awarded Rawat with MP level facilities to suppress her revolt, he added.\n\n\"Government is busy in the damage control of their party MLAs. State government is draining the public funds to facilitate their MLAs with the MP level amenities,\" he said.\n\nIn his statement, Bhatt also raised the issue that the state government has waived off 4.5 lakh rupees which was due to be paid by the party's state president Kishore Upadhyay.\n\nHe said that the party is wasting public money to win over their favourite candidates.\n\n\"Waiving off such an amount due on the party's state president is not fair when on the other hand the disaster hit lodge owners are still living under heavy debt,\" Bhatt said.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nHNIs invested in Piramal PMS.
