        "text": "Hint:The state in which a unicameral legislature is separated from Sri Lanka by a maritime boundary called Palk Strait. It is a state where the Sangam Age flourished, and the Eastern Ghats bounds it over the coastal boundary.\n\nComplete answer:\n\n-The two terms, Unicameral and Bicameral are identified with the state assemblies of the world. The council is a significant organ of the public authority which is capable to regulate the laws in the nation. Individuals are chosen/named in the lawmaking body and are assigned obligations to perform different capacities.\n\n-Unicameral legislature: - It is a type of assembly where just one house (one focal unit) exists to make and execute laws for the state/nation.\n\n-On account of the unicameral state governing body, Indian states are the best guides to comprehend. In India, a couple of states' parliaments are unicameral in nature for example they have just one house to make a law. In states, these are called Legislative Assemblies.\n\n-Unicameralism is the act of having just a single authoritative or parliamentary chamber. It is a mix of two Latin words i.e., “uni” means one and “camera” means chamber. A state lawmaking body that has one house, known as Vidhan Sabha or Legislative Council, is a unicameral council. The Sarkaria Commission was set up to audit the overall influence among states and the association. The union government can break up a state government for the President's standard if vital.\n\n-Out of 29 Indian States, there are 25 states which follow unicameral structure. These states are: -\n\nArunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal.\n\n-Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh follow the bicameral legislature.\n\nHence the correct answer is option D.\n\nNote:- Article 169(1) of the Constitution permits Parliament to either make or abrogate a Council in a state if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a goal with that impact.\n\n-The resolution must be a share of the absolute participation of the Assembly and by a majority share of at the very least 66% of the individuals from the Assembly present and casting a ballot."
