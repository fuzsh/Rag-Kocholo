Pritam Singh from Indian National Congress (INC) was the runner up with 30.57% of the total votes (2,62,171 votes). There was a margin of 2,93,949 votes between the two candidates.\n\n\"Under the leadership of PM Modi, the government brought several schemes for the welfare of poor, farmers, youth...NDA alliance is getting the majority and we are forming the government...In Uttarakhand, BJP is winning all five Lok Sabha seats....\" says Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami.\n\nAs per the latest voting trends, BJP is leading in all the 5 Lok Sabha seats of Uttarakhand.\n\nBJP candidate Trivendra Singh Rawat is leading in the Haridwar Lok Sabha seat by 1,00,748 votes, as per the latest data from the Election Commission of India.\n\nOn the other hand, Trivendra Singh Rawat's top contender and former CM Harish Rawat's son Virendra Rawat (INC) is lagging behind him in terms of votes.\n\nTrivendra Singh Rawat of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Virendra Rawat of Indian National Congress (INC), Jamil Ahmad of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are among the key candidates contesting from Haridwar in the Lok Sabha election 2024.\n\n“It’s God’s grace and the public’s faith in Modi ji.

Pradeep Tamta of Indian National Congress (INC) had secured second position with 2,09,836 votes (31.67% of total votes). The margin of votes between the two candidates was 2,20,619.\n\n\"The candidates of NDA are leading with very little margin...The public has voted for change...For the first time, PM Modi trailed in two rounds of counting...I hope that the INDIA alliance will get the majority,\" said Harish Rawat, former Uttarakhand CM and Congress leader.Harish Rawat's son Virendra Rawat is contesting against Trivendra Singh Rawat of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Haridwar Lok Sabha seat in Uttarakhand.\n\n\"Just now I have come to know that the initial trends of vote counting, whether from Dehradun or Haridwar, will come from areas where Congress has been in a weak position for a very long time, so seeing those trends, our worker friends will not make any decision. Don't draw conclusions,\" tweeted Harish Rawat, former CM of Uttarakhand.\"After the sixth and seventh round of counting, we will brainstorm and what conclusion to draw! The conclusion is of struggle, we will win and the struggle of the workers will be victorious. Best wishes to all of you,\" he added.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party candidate and former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Trivendra Singh Rawat exuded confidence and said that the BJP is winning the elections with a humungous share of votes on 5 out of 5 seats in the state and Prime Minister Modi is poised to form government in the centre for a third consecutive term.Expressing his confidence, Trivendra Singh Rawat said, \"With a better margin of votes, Bharatiya Janata Party is 100 per cent winning the elections on 5 out of 5 seats of Uttarakhand.He said, \"For the third consecutive PM Modi will be forming a government at the centre by quoting 'Tisri Baar Fir Modi Sarkar'.\n\nUttarakhand saw an overall voter turnout of 55.9% among its 5 Lok Sabha constituencies in Phase 1 polling that took place on April 19. With a turnout of 59.7%, Haridwar witnessed a relatively higher level of voter engagement compared to the state average of 55.9%. This indicates significant interest and involvement of the electorate in the political process, possibly influenced by the high-profile contest between former Chief Ministers Trivendra Rawat and Harish Rawat.The voter turnout in Garhwal stood at 49.9%, slightly below the state average.\n\nAlmora recorded the lowest voter turnout among Uttarakhand's constituencies, with 45.4%. Nainital-Udhamsingh Nagar boasted the highest voter turnout among all five constituencies, with an impressive 59.9%. Tehri Garhwal recorded a voter turnout of 51.7%, indicating a moderate level of engagement among the electorate in this constituency.\n\nThe day before the mega counting of votes for the Lok Sabha elections on June 4, Dehradun SSP Ajay Singh said that security arrangements have been made as per the standards of ECI and paramilitary forces will also be deployed during counting.\"Security arrangements have been made as per the standards of ECI, during this time paramilitary forces will also be deployed,\" SSP Singh told ANI.He said that entry of any other person within a radius of 100 meters will be prohibited, only counting officers and polling agents will be allowed to go there.The SSP said that no person will enter without a pass, everyone has been briefed in this regard and three-tier security arrangements have been made at the counting place.\n\nFrom linking its promise of bringing a Uniform Civil Code to the idea of \"gender equality\" to promising to empower women's self-help groups (SHGs) with the skills and tools required in key service sectors to increase their income, the BJP manifesto placed women's empowerment as a key plank of its political and development agenda. The manifesto said \"there cannot be gender equality till such time that Bharat adopts a UCC, which protects the rights of all women\". It goes on to reiterate its stand on UCC, \"drawing upon the best traditions and harmonising them with modern times\". Earlier this year, Uttarakhand became the first state to have a UCC.\n\nDehradun District Magistrate and District Election Officer Sonika on Monday inspected Maharana Pratap Sports College and reviewed the counting preparations. During the inspection, she also gave necessary instructions to the concerned officials.The District Election Officer inspected the counting centres set up assembly-wise in the shooting hall and multipurpose hall and checked the arrangements.She instructed the concerned officials to ensure that the secrecy of counting is maintained in the counting hall and the officers should follow the guidelines of the Election Commission of India strictly.The District Magistrate while addressing the media, said that proper preparations for counting have been completed.\n\nAs voting for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections concluded on Saturday, exit polls have predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will maintain its lead in Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, while also putting up a strong performance in Jammu.Axis My India has predicted 6-9 seats for the BJP-led NDA and 2-4 seats for the INDIA bloc in Haryana. BJP is predicted to get 48 per cent votes, while the INDIA bloc's vote share is expected to be at 44 per cent.Times Now ETG has predicted 7 seats for the BJP-led NDA and three seats for the INDIA bloc.According to 'Today's Chanakya' exit poll by News 24, NDA is expected to win six seats, and Congress is expected to win four seats.\n\nWith hours left before the counting of votes for the Lok Sabha elections in the world's largest democracy, security has been heightened at multiple locations across the country with police and paramilitary forces conducting intensive patrolling.Visuals from the national capital showed that the North-East Delhi District Police along with paramilitary forces were patrolling and checking vehicles in Nand Nagri, Seelampur, Dayalpur, Sonia Vihar and Bhajanpura areas of Delhi.Patrolling is also on at the Connaught Place and Barakhamba areas of Delhi. Security has been heightened at counting centres in Delhi's Khelgaon, Siri Institutional Area and other places as well.Around 70 companies of the security forces have been deployed at all seven counting centres across the national capital as part of the elaborate security arrangements made by the Delhi Police for the vote-counting day.\n\nAs Uttarakhand prepares for counting of votes on Tuesday, all attention is riveted on whether the BJP sweeps all the five Lok Sabha seats in the state for a record third straight term or its citadel is dented by its principal rival Congress which had drawn a blank in both 2014 and 2019 general elections. Polling to the five Lok Sabha seats of Uttarakhand was held in the first phase on April 19.It will be interesting to see what the results have in store for the two new candidates fielded by the BJP this time -- former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat in place of sitting MP and another former CM Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank in Haridwar and the party's national media in-charge Anil Baluni in place of former CM Tirath Singh Rawat in Pauri Garhwal.Both Haridwar and Pauri Garhwal are high profile seats won in the past by both the BJP and Congress stalwarts."
