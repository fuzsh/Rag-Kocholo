        "text": "Losing an election is no big deal, especially for veterans. It’s part of the game. They win, they lose, and they move on. Victories and defeats notwithstanding, their clout in the corridors of power remains. Generally.\n\nIn Uttarakhand, Harish Rawat is one such politician—a veteran of several defeats and some victories.\n\nIn a political career spanning over four decades, he has contested nine Lok Sabha elections and won four of them. At the state level, he entered the electoral fray on four occasions but won just once, that too in a by-election when the Congress was comfortably in power.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite this not-so-glittering electoral performance, Harish Rawat remains a towering politician in Uttarakhand. He is one who not only has pan-Uttarakhand popularity, but also the one who is notable at the national level.\n\nALSO READ | Top BJP leaders meet at PM Modi's residence to discuss govt formation in 4 states\n\nIt isn’t thus surprising that when pollsters surveyed Uttarakhand in their exit polls during assembly election, Harish Rawat was among the frontrunners in people’s preference for the next chief minister.\n\nIn 2017, when his government was facing severe anti-incumbency, the CSDS-Lokniti’s post-poll survey showed 35 per cent respondents preferring him as the next chief minister. BJP’s BC Khanduri was a distant second with 17 per cent votes in the survey.\n\nSo, why is it that despite all this, there is no end to Harish Rawat’s political debacle? Despite being one of the most popular political faces in Uttarakhand—as surveys have repeatedly shown—why is he losing elections after elections?\n\nBefore trying to understand this, let’s briefly revisit his political journey. The answer lies therein.\n\nSNAPSHOT OF A BUMPY RIDE\n\nHarish Rawat hails from Mohnari village in Almora district. It falls under the Ranikhet assembly constituency and the Almora parliamentary seat.\n\nALSO READ | Uttarakhand new CM likely to be announced after March 19\n\nHe started his political career in 1980, contesting from Almora in undivided Uttar Pradesh. He was elected to the seventh Lok Sabha. He retained this seat in 1984, and again in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, 1996, 1998 and 1999 Harish Rawat contested from the same seat on his home-turf but was defeated by BJP’s Jeewan Sharma (1991) and Bachi Singh Rawat (1996, 1998 and 1999). Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000.\n\nDespite four back-to-back defeats, the Congress gave him a Rajya Sabha seat in 2002. He was a Rajya Sabha MP till 2008.\n\nIn the 2009 Lok Sabha election, he left Almora, which became a reserved seat following delimitation. He contested from Haridwar. He won the election securing 42 per cent votes. Harish Rawat subsequently became a minister in the Manmohan Singh government.\n\nIn 2014, months before the Lok Sabha election, the Congress named him Uttarakhand’s chief minister. He replaced Vijay Bahuguna whose government was facing severe criticism for its mishandling of the 2013 Kedarnath disaster.\n\nSince Harish Rawat was an MP, he had to contest an assembly by-election. His long-time aide, Harish Dhami, vacated the Dharchula seat for Harish Rawat.\n\nThis was the first time that Harish Rawat contested an assembly election (albeit a by-election). He won it handsomely with a vote share of nearly 73 per cent.\n\nThree years later, Uttarakhand went to the polls. By now, the Harish Rawat government was facing severe anti-incumbency while the BJP was emboldened by the ‘Modi wave’ that had swept much of North India. Uttarakhand was among a handful of states where Congress was still in power.\n\nTo ensure victory at any cost, Harish Rawat contested from two seats—Haridwar Rural and Kichha. And, lost them both.\n\nIn Haridwar Rural, a seat that he had been trying to nurture since his 2009 victory, he secured just 33 per cent votes against BJP’s Swami Yatindranand Giri (46 per cent).\n\nHe was again in the electoral fray during the 2019 Lok Sabha election. But this time, he left Haridwar and chose a new seat—Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar. And, lost badly.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCut to the 2022 Uttarakhand Assembly election. Harish Rawat wanted to contest from Ramnagar.\n\nInitially, the Congress did name him as its Ramnagar candidate but swiftly moved him to Lalkuwa following strong protest from within primarily from Ranjeet Rawat, a former Harish Rawat aide but now a strong rival, who too was eyeing the same seat.\n\nALSO READ | After poll debacle, Sonia Gandhi shows door to Sidhu, 4 other state Congress chiefs\n\nWhen results were declared on March 10, Harish Rawat lost election on the Lalkuwa seat to BJP’s Mohan Singh Bisht by a margin of 17,527 votes.\n\nSO, THE MESSAGE\n\nOne aspect that comes out prominently from this bumpy political journey is that unlike most political heavyweights, Harish Rawat, despite all his clout and political capital, has failed to identify and develop a stronghold for himself in Uttarakhand.\n\nIn the past several elections, he has been hopping from one seat to another without building ground support in any.\n\nIn 1980, he started with Almora and was elected thrice to the Lok Sabha from the seat before losing the next four elections. He then switched his base to Haridwar in 2009. But, after becoming chief minister, he went to Dharchula, which lies on the other extreme end of the state, to contest assembly by-election.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThree years later, he did return to Haridwar but with one leg stuck in Kichha. The result was he lost both seats Haridwar more miserably than Kichha.\n\nNot learning from the past, he chose a new seat for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. And, lost again.\n\nThe same mistake was repeated in 2022 when he contested from Lalkuwa without having developed any ground support there.\n\nThis cogently explains a former chief minister, a veteran leader and a considerably popular face losing an assembly seat by over 17,500 votes in an election that was fought in the backdrop of the ruling party changing its chief minister twice within four months after sensing massive anti-incumbency.\n\nAfter about 42 years in active politics, Harish Rawat today is a leader who despite being popular and a frontrunner for the CM post, hardly has any recognisable home-turf—a seat or a region where he can say he is confident of a comfortable victory.\n\nTo convert popularity into an electoral victory, a politician must nurture a region as his stronghold.\n\nIn its absence, the outcome is similar to that hypothetical example of a party securing over 10 per cent votes in an election but not winning a single seat. Harish Rawat too enjoys good popularity ratings across the state, but when it comes to winning a seat, he has repeatedly failed to consolidate his supporters.\n\nadvertisement\n\nContrast him with other prominent state leaders, both in the Congress and the BJP. The successful ones have been those who have been loyal to their constituencies and have nurtured them as strongholds for years.\n\nBe it late Indira Hridayesh, Pritam Singh, Satpal Maharaj, Rekha Arya, Govind Kunjwal, Yashpal Arya, or Bansidhar Bhagat, they have mostly stuck to their seats or regions and generally refrained from hoping around in the state.\n\nFor Harish Rawat, a failure to do this has meant that while he may be able to help others win their seats because of his popularity, he is losing his own seat election after election.\n\nWill he learn from history? Perhaps it’s too late now."
