        "text": "Indian Constitution describes the Federal Government with certain powers and distribution of powers to the provincial government and the concurrent powers for both in Union, State and Concurrent List. India’s Federal Government has more powers compared to the Provincial Government because India is considered a Union of States and the States have not been given more provincial autonomy as it could lead to secession of territory, armed conflict and Pursuance of undemocratic activities by Separatists and secessionists. The Federal Government in India has shown many times acts of Political Interference in the administrative, legislative, social, economic decisions which are fundamentally opposed to the principles of federalism, sovereign equality and constitutional morality because provincial governments expect less political interference into the democratic institutions and public interests decisions initiated by the provincial government. The Administrative and Political Acts of the Federal Government has Constitutional implications on the political equality and administrative freedom of the provincial government as it doesn’t fit in the doctrine of reasonability and violates the basic structure of the constitution which is the most integral part of the constitution. Indian Federalism has been a complex structure of government administrative through new political ideas as the evolution of political democracy believes in political equality among all political entities and federalism shouldn’t be a authoritarian clampdown on democratic political leadership and principles of basic structure of the constitution should be abided by every federal government to ensure good centre state relations and deterioration of democratic relationship between federal government and provincial government is political error which is irrevocable.\n\nThis book explores the historical commitment to the idea of constitutionalism and how the framers understood India’s constitutional project. It begins with an overview of the concept of ‘constitutional morality’ as it relates to the Indian Constitution, along with the cosmopolitan character of Indian constitutionalism. It then considers some of the tensions that have characterised constitutional law in India, with particular emphasis on some of the sources of these tensions, for instance the debate between centralisation and decentralisation. It also discusses the major axes around which the normative and institutional imagination of the Indian Constitution is articulated and concludes by analysing the character of constitutional development in India and paying attention to the forces that have shaped its evolution.\n\nTraditional separation of powers theory does not apply neatly to India. The Indian Constitution mandates independent commissions that exert additional checks and balances on the political system; it permits the President to issue ordinances that function like legislation; and it has been interpreted to require judges to have the final word on higher judicial appointments. This Article, a contribution to the JICL Special Issue on \"Separation of Powers: Comparative Perspectives\", focuses on a creeping and more nebulous challenge to separation of powers: the higher judiciary's expanding writ jurisdiction in fundamental rights cases. Specifically, it examines the evolution of public interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court and High Courts over the past two decades, where judges act in both quasi-executive and quasi-legislative roles. Drawing on theories of constitutional dialogue, the Article proposes how the Indian higher judiciary might retrench in its PIL jurisdiction by directing public attention to the most egregious executive failures and leaving the law-making to Parliament."
