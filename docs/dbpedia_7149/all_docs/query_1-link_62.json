        "text": "The Uniform Civil Code Uttarakhand 2024 Bill, introduced by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami-led state government, passed in the House. After passing the UCC Bill in the Assembly, Uttarakhand has become the first state in the country to implement the Uniform Civil Code.\n\nPushkar Singh Dhami-led Uttarakhand govt can look to smooth passage of bill with 47 seats in the assembly, however the Congress-led Oppn has stated that the without proper review, the UCC Bill would become 'one-sided' law without consultations with different religious communities.\n\nGround reports from Uttarakhand suggest that there is no visible protests or public reactions, even from the Muslim community in the state. Meanwhile, it is almost certain that the UCC Bill could be passed today as the Pushkar Singh Dhami govt enjoys a majority in the state assembly.\n\n'It is a pity that Ambedkar's vision of uniform law for the citizens of India was ignored for so long after Independence as the ruling party played the politics of appeasement: Pushkar Singh Dhami during UCC Bill debate in the Uttarakhand assembly.\n\nThe UCC bill is the contribution of 'Devbhoomi' [Uttarakhand] to the huge developments in the country under PM Modi â€” from women's reservation bill to Ram Mandir. We are like the squirrel who helped build Ram Setu from India to Lanka: Pushkar Singh Dhami\n\nPushkar Singh Dhami mentions his mother's positive reaction to UCC Bill, saying she said he was 'doing great work'. Dhami stresses that the UCC Act will ultimately empower the nation's women and bring relief to \"mothers, daughters, sisters\" of the country.\n\nUttarakhand's Leader of Opposition and Congress MLA Yashpal Arya says: \"Instead of presenting the draft, the Bill was directly presented. Discussions began within 2 hours. But we participated in the discussion on both days. Our MLAs gave suggestions and also raised some objections. Government was asked to rectify the loopholes. The only way to amend these loopholes was to send this to the Select Committee and after examining the draft, it be brought back to the House, discussions be held again and then it be given the form of a Bill...\"\n\n'If the bill for the Uniform Civil Code is so good, then why does the centre not bring it? If the states are allowed to bring such bills, then it will have harmful consequences. The CM seemed to be in a hurry for political or other reasons': Former CM Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat\n\nRajasthan Minister Jhabar Singh Kharra says, \"The party has only one belief that there should be one law in the country... After the Lok Sabha elections, this law may come in Rajasthan too\"\n\nRajasthan's Leader of Opposition and Congress MLA Tika Ram Jully says, \"It has been BJP's policy to bring such agenda before the people at the time of elections to lead them astray. The Bill in Uttarakhand is being opposed in several places there itself. Law should be framed based on what people want, based on how it would benefit them. They are framing this law in haste.\" Rajasthan may be the next state to attempt passing the UCC Bill.\n\n'From Devbhoomi, this law will go across the country. Discussions for this law have started in other states too. Rajasthan and other states have taken a step towards this direction': Uttarakhand CM"
