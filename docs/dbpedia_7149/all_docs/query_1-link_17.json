Uttarakhand Global Investors Summit-2023 is being organized by the state as a link to achieve this goal.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the investor-centric policies of the State, investment in infrastructure, availability of skilled manpower and good governance have laid the foundation for a healthy investment climate in the State.

If 80 percent of the land is purchased by the entrepreneur for setting up industry in the private sector and there is an obstacle in purchasing the remaining land, then the said land will be acquired and made available by the state government.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the resolution of the problems has been started from September, 2021 only through continuous dialogue with the entrepreneurs, stakeholders and concerned departments of the state. More than 90 percent of the problems raised by the entrepreneurs in various meetings have been resolved.
