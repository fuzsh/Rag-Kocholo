        "text": "A bicameral legislature is always anathema to an elected autocrat. The 47-year-old Andhra Pradesh chief minister and Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress (YSRC) president, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, is no exception. In this, he is following in the footsteps of the arch rival Telugu Desam Party (TDP) founder N.T. Rama Rao (NTR), who abolished the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council (APLC).\n\nThe eloquent NTR described the APLC as an un-productive expense to the exchequer-an un-elected, un-representative body used to distribute political favours to out-of-work politicians, causing delays in passing purposeful legislation. That was in 1985, just months after the Congress (I) suffered a suffered a major defeat in the assembly elections. The irony is that more than two decades later, it was Jagan Reddy's father, Congress chief minister Dr. Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy, who revived the APLC in April 2007.\n\nadvertisement\n\nJagan Mohan Reddy, like NTR, is a man in a hurry, a change maker who wants to make a lasting impact on Telugu society. He declared, while electioneering last year, that his ultimate desire was to ensure that a smiling photograph of himself adorned every home in the state-that 'Jagananna', as he is endearingly called, be eternally remembered as a benefactor of the people. However, at the same time, the YSRC chief is certainly an autocrat, brooking no opposition (let alone criticism). This is largely why he skipped much of the winter session of the legislative assembly in December, despite the fact that the ruling YSRC enjoys a commanding majority in that house, occupying 151 of the 175 seats in the state legislative assembly.\n\nIn contrast, the YSRC has a woeful minority in the APLC, with just nine of the 58 seats in that house. Moreover, the opposition TDP, with 28 members and the possible support of others, could effectively stall (albeit temporarily) any legislation. That includes Reddy's ambitious plan for 'decentralised and inclusive development', which involves shifting the seat of administration from greenfield capital Amaravati to the port city of Visakhapatnam, moving the state High Court to Kurnool (once the Andhra capital), and constituting regional development boards to promote his concept of balanced growth of all regions of the state as well as promoting the state as an investment destination.\n\nMORE FROM INSIGHT | Why Chhatrapati Shivaji remains Maharashtra's tallest icon\n\n\"His (Reddy's) perception of reality is distinct,\" says political commentator C. Narasimha Rao. \"He believes that only his thoughts [matter], that the reality others perceive is [merely their] opinion. He does not tolerate anyone questioning him and considers all those who criticise him as enemies. This is why he wants to dissolve the legislative council and is also not comfortable with the opposition in the legislative assembly. He strongly believes that all the state's people are his supporters and that he alone addresses their needs.\"\n\nEight months into his term as chief minister, Reddy has initiated a slew of welfare measures to enhance the pro-poor image of his government. He is relying on the 'saturation strategy' pioneered by his father Rajashekara Reddy to ensure that the disadvantaged are covered by several government schemes simultaneously. This is unmindful of the fact that he is administering a cash-strapped state. In this stupendous effort, he perceives any political opposition as a stumbling block to his vision of progress, and the legislative council as a hurdle. And politically speaking, a unicameral legislature does make things easier for a ruling party.\n\n\"The dissolution of the [APLC] will take time. The state may consider doing it on grounds of expenditure,\" suggests political analyst Professor Ravi Komarraju. \"The structure of the Council is flawed, as it is modelled on an old system, giving representation to groups like graduates, school teachers and the like. Instead, it can be restructured to include professional groups including doctors, lawyers, academia, farmers and even trade unions,\" he says, pointing out that it would be advantageous if a restructured Council were retained and the support of these professional groups were to be garnered by any political party.\n\nMORE FROM INSIGHT | Will Modi remain the Shah of Indian politics in 2020?\n\nThe legislative council, or the upper house in a bicameral legislature, is established as defined in Article 169 of the Constitution of India. The power to create or abolish such a body in any state rests with Parliament, on the basis of an appropriate resolution being adopted by a two-thirds majority in the respective state legislative assembly. This is a piece of legislative business that Reddy can achieve with extraordinary ease, given the YSRC's brute majority in the assembly. Several chief ministers have taken this route to decimate the opposition when they perceived rival political parties and their leaders as irritants in their scheme of things.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn Telangana, the other Telugu state created by the division of the former Andhra Pradesh, chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) toyed with the idea of scrapping the legislative council during his first term-2014 to 2019-but finally settled for winning over select politicians to allow his Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) to gain a majority at the expense of the Congress. The poaching of opposition members is pass√© for political parties, which have adopted ingenious ways to circumvent anti-defection laws. However, Reddy is against this and asserts that those who want to join the YSRC from other parties must quit their elected posts.\n\nMORE FROM INSIGHT | Deepening crisis in Akali Dal turns heat on Badals\n\nIn contrast to Reddy's possible plan to do away with the APLC, attempts have been made in other states to establish legislative councils, as ruling political parties often have more politicians looking for work than the available seats in the state legislative assemblies. However, there is a limit-under Article 171 of the Constitution, a state legislative council can at most have one third the total number of seats in the legislative assembly. Currently, including Andhra Pradesh, there are only six states that have bicameral legislatures, the others being Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. Yet others are looking to establish new legislative councils-proposals to do so in Rajasthan and Assam are pending in Parliament.\n\nadvertisement\n\nGiven his image of a political pragmatist, Reddy may, during the time-consuming abolition process, still pitch for a restructuring of the Council instead."
