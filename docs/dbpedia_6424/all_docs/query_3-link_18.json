Cli-Fi, short for climate-fiction, is a sub-genre of science fiction which has emerged in literature but could equally apply to a number of disaster flicks released in the last decade, Emmerich’s being one of them.\n\nIn tutorials you might like to consider some of the following questions: How does ‘Hollywood ecology’ (Cubitt 2005: 125), evident in films like The Day After Tomorrow, assist in shaping our imagining of a future dominated by climate change? What kinds of stylistic and narrative conventions does Emmerich employ in this film and are they effective? What other examples of cli-fi can you think of and how do they compare to The Day After Tomorrow? Do you think DAT is an example of social problem-filmmaking or rather, a politically motivated distortion of complex scientific and political questions? Is it wrong to derive pleasure from apocalyptic catastrophe?\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nRodge Glass, (2013) “Global Warning: the rise of Cli-Fi” in The Guardian, May 31st, 2013. http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/31/global-warning-rise-cli-fi\n\nKakoudaki, Despina (2011) \"Representing Politics in Disaster Films\", International Journal of Media and Cultural Politics, Volume 7 Number 3, pp. 349-356.\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nFeil, Ken (2005) ‘Conclusion’, Dying for a Laugh: Disaster Movies & the Camp Imagination, p. 146-158.\n\nBranston, Gill.

Bahman Ghobadi’s Turtles Can Fly was the first film to come out of Iraq after the American invasion. Like many Iranian films that use non-professional child actors, this film focuses on a community of Kurdish refugee children eking out a living collecting and selling abandoned land mines. They exist in a precarious space near the Turkey-Iran border. Like his earlier film, Time for Drunken Horses, the director, Iranian Kurd Bahman Ghobadi, populates Turtles with “dislocated and isolated characters whose position and physical location is contingent upon larger, unseen political forces — it is the cinema of a stateless nation [Kurdistan]” (Hamid 2005; 42).\n\nHow does a western viewer engage with a film like Turtles Can Fly? Is it possible to compare this film to DAT, or are they completely different beasts? What are their similarities? What are the transnational aspects of Turtles? Ezra and Rowden argue that, ‘Those films most likely to circulate transnationally are those that are more ‘Western friendly’, adopting familiar genres, narratives of themes in their hybrid productions’ … They function as what Jigme Desai calls, ‘tasty, easily swallowed, apolitical global cultural morsels’ (Desai 45, 90) – in other words, cinematic McNuggets’ (Ezra & Rowden p. 6). Is Turtles can Fly just a McNugget?\n\nScreenings: Turtles Can Fly (Bahman Ghobadi, 2004)\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nHamid, R.

Iranian cinema is one example of a national cinema that’s often defined in opposition to Hollywood, but it’s also classified as ‘third cinema’. This week we put Iranian cinema in context but look closely at the role of women filmmakers and the representation of gender. Our main screening is the (French-funded) animation film, Persepolis (2007), based on the highly successful autobiographical graphic novel of the same name by Marjane Satrapi. Persepolis (written/directed by Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud) won the Jury Prize at Cannes and depicts a young girl growing up in a highly volatile period of Iranian history in the 1970s and 80s and her subsequent exile to France.\n\nHow might animation acknowledge the impossibility of representation of violent events in history? How does Persepolis challenge the stereotypes and assumptions of Iran that we are often subjected to in the news, or even in recent films such as Argo (Ben Affleck, 2012)? What kind of stylistic choices do the directors/writers/ animators make in the depiction of religious extremists and other characters in the film? What factors have given rise to the increasing presence of women (both on and off-screen) in post-revolutionary Iranian cinema? Comment on the aesthetics and significance of veiling/unveiling in Iranian cinema?\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nNacify, H.

Turtles Can Fly, Ten, The Day I Became a Woman and The Day After Tomorrow). Our screening this week, Lilya 4-Ever, is about a Russian teenager abandoned by her mother and left to her own devices in decaying, post-Soviet Russia. Lilya’s only friend is an angelic little boy called Volodya. In addition to the representation of childhood/children, we also turn our attention to the trafficking of women.\n\nWhile not overtly didactic, Lilya 4-Ever was taken up by the Swedish government to educate its own population (and internationally) on the horrors of trafficking women from Eastern Europe and Russia. The director, Lukas Moodysen says that: “I wanted my film to be a train running over the audience” (Noh 2004: p. 20). Do you think he’s been effective in this and what kinds of stylistic and narrative conventions does he use to do this? How does the portrayal of children (and childhood) compare to others you’ve seen in the course so far? If you've seen the English-language French action film Taken (Pierre Morel, 2008), how does Lilya compare? What is the 'Swedish Solution' and do you think this should be advocated for in Australia?\n\nScreening: Lilya 4-Ever (Lukas Moodysen, 2003)\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nWilson, E.

Blackfish is the story of a SeaWorld orca named Tillikum, who, traumatised by decades in captivity, has taken multiple human lives. Director of The Whale, Michael Parfit, argues that the connection between these films is “a widespread recognition that humans and animals are not so far apart, both in geographical fact as we encroach farther and farther into their domains, and in our fundamental biology and emotional lives… Both science and these creative efforts show that we can no longer treat animals as second class citizens” (Campbell).\n\nIn one of your articles for this week from National Geographic, scientist Lori Marino argues that animals should be legally recognised as persons. What evidence does she give for this and do you agree with her? What kinds of narrative and stylistic devices do films like Blackfish and The Cove use to win over the viewer & are they effective or are they exploitative (of the viewer)? What is the ‘Blackfish effect’ and would a doco like Blackfish stop you attending SeaWorld? More than just animal porn, why are TV-scientist collaborations like Crittercam important, according to Donna Haraway in your final reading for this week? What similarities and differences does this film have with other documentaries on animal exploitation that you've seen?\n\nScreening: Blackfish (Gabriela Copperthwaite 2014) with excerpts from The Cove (Louie Psihoyos, 2009) and The Whale (Suzanne Chrisholm & Michael Parfit, 2011)\n\nRequired:\n\nMorrell, V. (2014) “Lori Marino: Leader of a revolution in how we perceive animals” in National Geographic, May 2014, http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/innovators/2014/05/140528-lori-marino-dolphins-animals-personhood-blackfish-taiji-science-world/?utm_source=NatGeocom&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=inside_20140619&utm_campaign=Content\n\nCampbell, C.

You may have seen her latest film, The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2012), that had a season at Dendy. In this lecture (and tutes) we look at two of her earlier films, Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding which present two sides of India that are in stark opposition. Salaam Bombay! depicts a brief moment in the life a little boy, ‘Chaipau’ who lives on the streets and in the brothels of Bombay. In contrast Monsoon Wedding takes place in New Delhi when a group of middle class NRIs (non-resident Indians) from a large Punjabi family return for a wedding. MW became one of the highest grossing foreign films in the US and won the Golden Lion at Venice but lost the Oscar nomination to Lagaan (Desai 2004, 213).\n\nTo what extent do you think Nair’s cinematic representation of Indian subalterns in Salaam Bombay! is ‘touristic’ and ‘voyeuristic’ (Naficy 2001, p. 69)? In comparison to Salaam Bombay, how are societal divisions (class, gender, generational) manifested in Monsoon Wedding? What role does colour, lighting and sound play in representing these divisions? What does Hamid Naficy mean by the term ‘accented cinema’? Do you agree with Patricia Uberoi’s claim that this film was successful because it did not display the vulgarity associated with commercial Bollywood made for working class Indians (Desai 2004; p. 218)\n\nScreening: Monsoon Wedding (Mira Nair, 2002) with excerpts from Salaam Bombay (Mira Nair, 1988), Mississippi Masala (Mira Nair, 1992) and The Reluctant Fundamentalist (Mira Nair 2012)\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nNaficy, H.

The central premise of this week’s screening, Lagaan (‘tax’ in Hindi), set at the end of the 19th century, concerns a cricket game of epic proportions between some Indian villagers and British colonials.\n\nAccording to Grant Farred, how does this film articulate a ‘double temporality’? And what role does the feringhee (the white woman) play in this film? Using Lagaan and your readings to guide you, what are some of the stylistic preoccupations of Bollywood cinema? Could Bollywood cinema be described as a ‘national cinema’? Is the spectator-subject differently positioned in popular Hindi cinema in comparison to much filmmaking from ‘the west’? If so, how? To what extent do you think its possible for viewers in Sydney to appreciate Bollywood films? Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire (Danny Boyle, 2008) and if so, how does Lagaan compare?\n\nScreening: Lagaan (Ashutosh Gowarika, 2001)\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nFarred, G.

The late Roger Ebert, renown movie critic, cited it as one of America's greatest movies (Mock 2014). This week begins our exploration of ‘Auteurs & Non-conformists’ and we look at the work of one of the US’s most prolific and controversial directors, Spike Lee. Lee’s films are often viewed as controversial not only in their representation of ethnicity, but also in the way that gender and ethnicity intersect. In fact the studio, Universal Pictures, that produced one of his more recent films, Inside Man (2006), played down the fact that Lee directed it given his reputation for being divisive. Do the Right Thing is no exception. It's an ensemble film depicting the rising racial tensions in a Brooklyn neighbourhood over the course of one day in the middle of a heatwave. On it's release the film was criticised for it's potential to incite race riots.\n\nWhy do Lee’s films provoke such controversy and do they still strike a chord in contemporary American race politics or are they no longer relevant? What role does music play in his films? Do the Right Thing connects environmental issues with race and politics in a particularly prescient way. Do you agree with Mock's argument in this regard? And given that Lee is now part of the filmmaking establishment, should he be using kickstarter to raise funds for his filmmaking enterprises?\n\nScreening: Do the Right Thing (Spike Lee, 1989), with excerpts from his She’s Gotta Have it (1986) and Jungle Fever (1991).\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nDenzin, N.

We explore the work of German-Turkish auteur, Fatih Akin. His landmark film Head On starts in Hamburg and ends in Istanbul. With the Turkish diaspora in Germany numbering over 3 million, a growing body of films are being made about Turkish experiences of living in German cities. Their impact have driven some critics to claim: “that the new German film is Turkish and that ‘Turkish’ cultural production has the potential of salvaging ‘German’ culture” (Fachinger 2007, p. 243).\n\nOur screening for this week, Head-On, won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and the European film of the year in 2004. It has elements of melodrama and kara sevda (or deadly passion) glimpsed in many Turkish films and it also exudes a raw kinetic energy. The story centres on two second-generation Turks living in Hamburg, Cahit and Sibel, and their marriage of convenience. How is their experience of ‘exile’ or ‘diaspora’ in a ‘foreign’ country contrasted to the characters we saw earlier in Turtles Can Fly and Lilya-4-Ever? What might a European cinema that includes Turkish productions look like? What role does music play in this film?\n\nScreening: Head-On (Fatih Akin, 2004) with excerpts from Im July (Fatih Akin, 2001), Edge of Heaven (Fatih Akin, 2007), Kebab Connection (Anno Saul, 2004)\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nBerghahn, D.

The director, David Simon, who worked as a journalist before producing TV, doesn’t believe in pandering to audience expectation. “F&^%ck the average audience”, he once said in an interview.\n\nSharma argues that The Wire is different to other recent TV series which have received cult following (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under) because of ‘the intellectual demands of the series, especially its sociologically driven analysis of contemporary urban society. In this respect, the show has been of interest not just to television studies scholars, but to academics from very diverse fields of study.’ How is The Wire ‘more real than reality’ and ‘an open textual machine’? What is the film’s explicit political agenda? How is race an absent presence in the film? And how does this film compare to Lee's Do the Right Thing?\n\nRequired Reading:\n\nAsh Sharma, 2011. “Editorial: ‘All the pieces matter’ – introductory notes on The Wire” in “The Wire Files” issue of Dark Matter: In the ruins of Imperial Culture, http://www.darkmatter101.org/site/category/journal/issues/4-the-wire/\n\nOliver Burkeman, 2009, “Arrogant?

NITV emerged out of twenty years of a successful, but highly dispersed, grass-roots media system with regional control. In addition to looking at a number of short clips, our main screening this week will be the top grossing Australian film of 2012, The Sapphires, which took $14.5 million at the box office. Based on a stage play of the same name, the film received a 10-minute standing ovation at Cannes.\n\nIn tutes and lectures, we will look at questions such as, how can Indigenous media play a greater role in the Australian public sphere? Can locally controlled media offer national narratives? Where does industry development begin and end? Do you think portraying indigenous characters on screen is still ‘box office poison’, as Fred Schepisi once claimed after he released his landmark film, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978). We’ll also examine some of the issues that Therese Davis raises in her short paper on the way in which students regard indigenous films. And why is having four Aboriginal women on the big screen political, as Tony Briggs, the co-writer and associate producer of The Sapphires, claims?\n\nScreening: The Sapphires (Wayne Blair, 2011) with excerpts from First Australians (Rachel Perkins, SBS TV, 2008), Redfern Now (ABC TV 2012), Mabo (Rachel Perkins, 2008), Radiance (Rachel Perkins, 1998) and Green Bush (Warwick Thornton, 2005)\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nDavis, T., 2010, “Beyond good/should/bad: teaching Australian Indigenous film and television”, Continuum: Journal of Media and Cultural Studies [P], vol 24, issue 5, October 2010, Routledge, United Kingdom, pp. 799-804.\n\nCapp, R. 2012. “Seriously Funny: History and Humour in The Sapphires and other Indigenous comedies”, In Senses of Cinema, Issue 63, July 2012, http://sensesofcinema.com/2012/63/seriously-funny-history-and-humour-in-the-sapphires-and-other-indigenous-comedies/\n\nRennie, E. and Featherstone, D. 2008, “The potential diversity of things we call TV': Indigenous community television, self-determination and NITV”.

And couldn't find it anywhere\", (Easy Rider PR material).\n\nEasy Rider has been described variously as, \"lyrical and brilliant, the reflection of its generation ... like a Bob Dylan song on celluloid\" (Washington Post), and by Rex Reed as, \"taking off where Kerouac and Lawrence Lipton and all the Holy Barbarians left off ... like a nature study filmed on an opium trip\". Our film this week examines New Hollywood’s tradition of the road and we look at Dennis Hopper’s classic counter-culture film, Easy Rider.\n\nMany of the films we’ve looked at in MAS304 so far are road movies of sorts (Ten, Day After Tomorrow, Head On, Lilya-4-Ever, The Sapphires). How does this film compare to them, or others you've seen in the course? From what context (social, historical, political) did Easy Rider emerge? Does the film still have resonances for your generation or are the issues that the film deals with now no longer relevant? What do you think made New Hollywood's directors non-conformists? What is meant by the quote at the top of this section? What elements of the 'road movie' genre does Easy Rider contain? And for those of you that are taking MAS302, what might be a feminist critiique of Easy Rider?\n\nScreening: Easy Rider (Dennis Hopper, 1969)\n\nRequired Readings:\n\nBarbara Klinger, “Landscaping the Nation: The Road to Dystopia in Easy Rider,” in Steven Cohan and Ina Rae Hark, ed., The Road Movie Book (London: Routledge, 1997): 179-203\n\nRecommended Readings:\n\nDennis Hopper, “Midsection ‘68/’88,” Film Comment 24, 4 (1988): 31.\n\nL.
