        "text": "Accompanied by heavy metal music, a boyish, bashed-up girl is running along the side of a motorway. She is out of breath and desperate. But why? And who? And where? Seagulls circle above, past the industrial stacks, as she reaches a pedestrian overpass.\n\nAfter this prologue, the story retreats three months to \"somewhere in what was once the Soviet Union\". It's Estonia, where 16-year-old Lilya lives with her mum and her mum's boyfriend, a beefy fellow who communicates in grunts. Pretty and spirited, Lilya lives in a depressing neighbourhood, where rows of flats are soul-destroying in their uniformity. (Even though, ironically, this geometrical bleakness presents great opportunities for cinematographer Ulf Brantas.) Still, Lilya doesn't mind. She has a spring in her step: her family is moving to America, which arouses envy in her peers.\n\nOne tragic conversation later, however, and Lilya is unpacking and moving into an even crumbier flat, where she barely has money for food. Worse, she barely has money for cigarettes. Wall Street cigarettes, no less, taunting her with notions of emigration. Meanwhile, the men who buy and trade women for sex are looking for a way to connive themselves into the plot.\n\nSwedish writer-director Lukas Moodysson has a habit of winning Guldbaggen, or Swedish Oscars, and he took home best direction and best screenplay for this effort. He has been compared to Ingmar Bergman, but Moodysson says the Cure and Morrissey had more of an influence. Certainly music plays an important part in all his films, from Fucking Amal (also known as Show Me Love) to Together. Here that's evident from the thrash onslaught of the opening scene, a musical choice to complement the scene's gritty, hand-held visuals.\n\nAs Lilya, Oksana Akinshina is stunning and vulnerable, a girl at the crossroads of innocence and corruption. At 16, she's beginning to get a sense of the paradox of beauty: that it simultaneously makes her powerful and powerless. Intriguingly, Akinshina had to communicate with Moodysson via an interpreter, given the Leningrad-born actress didn't speak English or Swedish. She has since gone on to star in the Russian fantasy hit Wolfhound."
