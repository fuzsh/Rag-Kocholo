        "text": "European cinema presents the issue of prostitution as closely linked to capitalist modes of exploitation by corporations, in general, and men, in particular. This exploitation is generally connected to violence against both women and the working classes. In the 1970s, prostitution was seen through the lens of second-wave feminism as “inherently violent and abusive” (Kempadoo 2005: xi) but there has been a more recent move to define prostitution as a “legitimate form of work” acknowledging the complex processes whereby poor women become involved in a “search for social and economic security in the new world order” (Kempadoo 2005: xii). Several recent European films, including Ulrich Seidl’s Import/Export (2007) and Lukas Moodysson’s Lilya 4-ever (2002) present sex work as a way of crossing borders in search of a better life in the new Europe. While represented as horrific and degrading in these films, sex work in European cinema is often a metaphor for the more general conditions of work, echoing Karl Marx’s dictum that, “Prostitution is only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the laborer” (1844: 42). Earlier films such as Nights of Cabiria (Le notti di Cabiria, 1957) by Federico Fellini, and Jean Luc-Godard’s Vivre sa vie (1962) and Two or Three Things I Know About Her (2 ou 3 choses que je sais d’elle, 1967) depict women working as prostitutes to be diligent, honest and, particularly in the case of Cabiria, as innocent."
