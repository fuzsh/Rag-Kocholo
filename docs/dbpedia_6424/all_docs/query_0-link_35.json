        "text": "Do not be late for “Lilya 4-Ever,” or you will miss the most extraordinary noise. It is the first noise that we hear, and certainly the loudest, as the soundtrack reverberates to the churn of a heavy-metal band. Not just any old heavy metal but German heavy metal—a group called Rammstein, whose lead singer hurls the words “Mein Herz brennt” (“My heart burns”) as if they were thunderbolts. If the god Wotan got caught in an overhead power cable, this is what he would sound like. The bizarre thing is that, when the same track plays again, at the movie’s end, we are no longer deafened by it but stirred. No offense to Guns N’ Roses, Metallica, or the fragrant Megadeth, but I have never associated their work with such floodings of emotion.\n\nThe writer and director is Lukas Moodysson, the young Swede who has been praised by Ingmar Bergman, no less, and whose previous feature, “Together,” was the best film released here in 2001. It was a comedy, set in the nineteen-seventies, although the jokes were plucked from painful ground. Now, in his latest project, the laughter has withered away. Instead, we get the tale of Lilya (Oksana Akinshina), who is sixteen. Bereft of father and siblings, she lives with her mother in an unnamed backwater of the former Soviet Union. (These portions of the film were shot near Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.) Lilya is cute, cocky, rude to schoolteachers and cashiers, and unexpectedly devout, kneeling before her favorite picture of an angel and child. From the start, you can sense, on the fringes of her upbeat demeanor, and in the nervous flicker of her eyes, the fear that not all will be well. And so it proves. She and her mother are meant to be emigrating to the United States, but, one night at dinner, her mother mentions casually that she will be going over first, alone, and that Lilya will be left to her own devices. There is an aunt to help out, but the aunt is a raddled witch in a baseball cap; there is a vague plan for Lilya to join her mother, but you know it will never happen. The future is corroded, inch by inch.\n\n“Lilya 4-Ever” is a film packed with malevolent people, mostly men, ruthless engineers of human souls and merchants in human flesh. I nevertheless persist in thinking that the true villain of the piece is Lilya’s mother. Other folk have chosen, cynically, to do wrong; but she has a duty to love, and she brushes it off like dust. That is why, after fifteen minutes of this movie, you are already in agony. As the mother’s car waits outside, Lilya sits upstairs in their apartment and sulks. Then, at the last moment, she leaps up, runs downstairs, and chases the car, crying for her mother—even this travesty of a mother—and ending up, sluggish with slow motion, in a puddle of rutted mud. The fact that she is wearing a flowered nightgown somehow makes the image worse. As with “Together,” Moodysson has pulled off a staggering dramatic coup, and again we are forced to ask: How does he do it? A quarter of an hour ago, we had never encountered this girl, and, if we had been told her story, we would have filed it away as another dismal statistic. Yet here we are, sitting in the dark and worrying, to a quite insane degree, about Lilya’s fate, and begging that it will not brim with harm.\n\nThis is an uncommon experience. Cast your mind back over the movies of the past year and try to name the last occasion on which you honestly cared, one way or another, what happened to the figures onscreen. Such empathy is hardly the sole purpose of filmgoing, but it clearly fuels the ardent, unpious Moodysson as he tracks the destiny of Lilya. We see her accompanying her friend Natasha (Elina Benenson) on a trip to a night club, and reacting with revulsion as Natasha (who, like Lilya, is still at school) turns a brief trick for cash. Next thing we know, Lilya is doing the same, and the saddest sight in the picture is the sly smile that creases her face—a smug teen-age triumph, faintly haloed in guilt—as she marches around the supermarket with her ill-earned cash.\n\nBeing Lilya, she does a good thing with bad money. She buys a basketball for Volodya (Artiom Bogucharski), a Dickensian scrap of a boy who starts as a pain in the neck and grows into Lilya’s only friend in the world. (The errant Natasha has long since dropped from view.) Volodya is thrown out of his home; he sleeps curled up in stairwells, like a dog, or next to Lilya in her stained apartment. Together, they visit the windy shell of an old Soviet submarine base nearby; Moodysson doesn’t press the point, but, if you want to see how the larger current of history sweeps past the unregarded citizens who were supposed to be its beneficiaries, look at this pair of kids, sniffing glue in a concrete room, glancing at a red mural of Lenin, and leafing through damp sheaves of Party proclamations. Workers of the world, forget it.\n\nNot that the dispensation of recent times has dealt kindly with Lilya or Volodya. At the most, it has sweetened the candy of their daydreams. You feel weirdly crushed as the boy bounces his ball and murmurs of Michael Jordan, or as the girl announces that she shares a birthday with Britney Spears. For a while, it seems that Lilya, in tune with those romantic fancies, has found her man—a polite, well-dressed fellow named Andrei (Pavel Ponomaryov), who offers her a ride one chilly night and doesn’t even try to sleep with her. (“So you think I’m ugly?” she protests, a line that shows how fast she has slid toward perdition.) He takes her to a funfair, and then to McDonald’s, and he talks about an even more succulent Eden—a job, a salary, a place to live—that awaits them in the West. Lilya’s excitement is tremulous and genuine, and we should be pleased for her; but all we want to do is stand up and shout, “Don’t do it. Stay with Volodya. Don’t go.”\n\nBut she does go, and what she discovers there, in a rain-gray suburb in Sweden, is incomparably worse than all that she left behind. I will not drag you through the murk; suffice to say that, the second time I saw “Lilya 4-Ever,” it was with an invited audience from unicef and Amnesty International. I know why they were there, and the social problem with which the movie deals is a dire and contagious one that Moodysson himself is keen, and right, to publicize. On the other hand, it would be counterproductive to tag this film as the spearhead of a campaign. Nothing turns a movie audience off more speedily than the suspicion that it is buying tickets for a lecture. You should pay to see “Lilya 4-Ever” not because it will introduce you to the crime of human trafficking in the rubble of the Soviet empire but because, at its simplest and most scalding, it is an essay on love.\n\nThat may sound perverse, given the vacuum of affection into which Lilya is plunged. But Moodysson is not in the business of squalor, still less of melodrama; rather, he carefully leads us through the process by which love is drained from the world. That is why Andrei’s approaches are designed to make a mockery of ordinary flirtation, and why the final outrage that is visited upon Lilya should be such an appalling cartoon of parenthood. A neat, wealthy Swede takes her into his spacious house, sits her down and tells her to do her homework, as if she were his own daughter, and then violates that parody of trust. From here, the movie crashes breathlessly to its close.\n\nSo why sit through it? Because we love Lilya, even if nobody else, apart from Volodya, gives a damn. She is far from a saint; but, from the moment when she buys potato chips, fruit juice, and cigarettes, only to hand back the juice because she can’t afford it, we feel the urge—pointless but overwhelming—to be at her side. “All her shame had obviously touched her only mechanically; no trace of real corruption had yet crept into her heart; he could see that; it was her real self that stood before him . . .” That is Sonya, the prostitute in “Crime and Punishment,” and Lukas Moodysson, like Dostoevsky before him, and like Robert Bresson in his great film “Mouchette,” finds a core of goodness in one young woman that embarrasses and damns the predatory spirits who hover around and peck at her. I want to see “Lilya 4-Ever” one more time, but I’m not sure that I can take it. Mein Herz brennt. ♦"
