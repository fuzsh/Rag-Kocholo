        "text": "I CAME TO THIS best-selling novel quite late in the day as it’s been available as an English translation for 2 years. It’s deservedly won several awards, but I first knew about it after recently watching a brief clip of Sofi Oksanen from the 2010 Louisiana Literature Festival in Denmark. She had some interesting things to say, had published a book (‘Purge’) which appeared to have crossed the crime/literary fiction divide, and looked eccentric – so my interest was tweaked. Incidentally, the Louisiana Literature Festival is one of the very few book festivals I’d like to go to because it is small and is attended by a wide range of authors from around the world. For example, this August sees the following writers making an appearance: Patti Smith (yes, that Patti Smith), Indian writer Kiran Desai, the Swede Linn Ullmann, Germany’s Judith Schalansky, Britain’s Alan Hollinghurst, Canadian Anne Carson, the Pulitzer-winning US author Jeffrey Eugenides, and Finn-Swede Cia Rinne. I’m really hoping to go next year.\n\nOksanen’s novel spans roughly 60 years and opens in 1992 after Estonia has regained its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Aliide Truu, an elderly widow, lives on the outskirts of an Estonian forest. She is regularly tormented by young stone-throwers who revile her past-sympathies with the communists. The constant tap-tap-tap of the stones on her windows act as a constant reminder of a history she desperately tries to repress. However, the buried past resurfaces when Aliide takes in Zara, a bloodied and dishevelled girl from Vladivostok who turns up in her front yard. Zara is on the run from sadistic Russian Mafia pimps after being forced into the depressing life of a sex worker. (If you have seen the Lukas Moodysson’s 2002 film ‘Lilya 4 Ever’ you will have a good idea of the sheer awfulness of Zara’s fate.)\n\nWe eventually learn that Zara is the granddaughter Aliide’s sister, Ingel, who was exiled to Siberia during Stalin’s purge in the mid-1940s. It’s in 1944 that Aliide’s story really begins because this is when the German ‘liberators’ fell to the Red Army and the Russians subsequently re-occupied Estonia. Ingel is married to Hans Pekk who is sought by the Russian secret service for being a collaborator with the Germans during their 1941-44 occupation. Desperate to save Hans, Aliide and her sister hide him in the hidden attic of their house when they learn the Russians are rounding up ‘bandits’. The sisters are subsequently interrogated several times by the communist militia but refuse to tell the authorities where Hans is. At their final interrogation both sisters endure a brutal gang rape in the basement of the town hall. The ordeal crushes Aliide who seeks to repress and hide the ‘shame’ of it by marrying a communist and supporting the regime. In the process she secretly participates in the forced exile of her sister to Siberia.\n\nFifty years on, Aliide’s past bubbles steadily up to the surface when Zara shows her an old, crumpled photograph of her beloved grandmother standing beside Aliide. And so begins the ‘eternal recurrence’ (as Nietzsche calls it) – or the constantly repetitious cycle of history: in 1944 Aliide helped save her brother-in-law Hans from the Russians by hiding him in a secret attic; and in 1992 she attempts to hide Zara from the Russian Mafia in the same attic room.\n\nDespite its convoluted plot, ‘Purge’ is a very readable novel. I think the translation, attacked in some circles, is superb. The following passage reveals how poetic and evocative Oksanen’s writing is. In it Zara is recalling her grandmother talking about life in Estonia:\n\n“Her mother didn’t like it that Grandmother gave [Zara] candy for no reason – or so she thought – but she didn’t bother to intervene beyond a disapproving sniff. Zara could keep the delicious words, the sweet tongue, and those rare stories that Grandmother told about a cafe somewhere there, a cafe where they served rhubarb crumble with thick whipped cream, a cafe whose chocolate cream puffs would melt in your mouth and whose garden smelled of jasmine, and the rustle of German newspapers – but not just German; Estonian and Russian ones, too – and tie pins and cuff links, and women in fine hats, you could even see dandies in dark suits and tennis shoes, with clouds of magnesium blowing out of a house where they had just taken a photograph. The promenade along the shore at the Sunday concert. A sip of seltzer in the park. The Koluvere princess who haunted the streets at night. The rasberry jam on french bread in the warmth of the stove on a winter night, with cold milk to drink! And red currant nectar!” (pp.50-51)\n\nSeveral themes run through the novel: violence against women; Aliide’s house as representative of Estonia; the remaking of history.\n\nViolence against women\n\nReading the ‘Soviet Woman’ magazine in the 1950s, Aliide comes to the following passage:\n\n“It is only in the Soviet Union and in people’s democracies that a woman works as a comrade, side by side with the men, in all fields, in agriculture and transportation as well as in teaching and the cultural professions, and takes an active part in political life and in running society.” (p.253)\n\nYet with Aliide’s brutal rape in a Town Hall basement at the hands of the Soviets, this claim rings completely hollow. Such misogyny is of course not limited to totalitarian states. As Aliide’s notes, the same oppression occurs in the independent Estonia of the 1990s; an Estonia which is moving along the road to democracy: “Even if the loudspeakers on the tower at Pika Hermanni were playing independence songs every day, there would always be chrome-tanned boots, some new boots would arrive, the same or different, but a boot on your neck nevertheless.” (p.325)\n\nThis observation is reinforced by the fate of Zara. Lured to Berlin by the promises of money she can use to fund her studies to be a doctor, she is instead brutally shunted into the life of a sex worker. The following passage is just one example of her life at the hands of sadistic, women-hating males:\n\n“The boss put on the [porn] video and told her to do what was on the screen.\n\n‘I suppose you know you’re a slut?’\n\n‘I know.’\n\n‘Say it.’\n\n‘I’m a slut and I’ll never change. I’ve always been a slut and I always will be.’\n\n‘And where is this slut’s home?’\n\n‘Vladivostok.’\n\n‘What?’\n\n‘Vladivostok.’\n\n‘You said it wrong. This is your home. Here with your master and your master’s cock. A slut has no other home, and she never will.'” (p.278)\n\nA tough passage for any empathetic reader to take in. And one which probably raised the ire of those few reviewers who thought writing like this was ‘too much’. Get over it, for goodness sake! This type of violence towards sex workers (in particular) and women (in general) occurs day-in and day-out – and the sooner we accept it the sooner we can attempt to put an end to it. Pretending it isn’t happening is akin to behaving like Aliide with her repression of painful memories. Instead we need to try and purge such behaviour and memories.\n\nAliide eventually recognises the similarities of her life with that of Zara’s. In particular, the appalling sexual abuse she suffered and its impact on her life. After seeing pornographic images of Zara (images she was forced to pose for), Aliide compares her fate with the younger woman’s:\n\n“And you would never know, when you passed people on the street, if they had seen those pictures. They would look at you, and you would never know if you’d been recognised. They would be laughing among themselves and looking in your direction, and you wouldn’t know if they were talking about you.” (p.336)\n\nAliide’s house as representative of Estonia\n\nI recall reading EM Forster’s ‘Howards End’ and the house which is at the centre of the novel (the house has the same name as the novel’s title) being representative of modern day England. The elderly Ruth Wilcox, a representative of England’s ruling classes, is dying and her country home is under threat. Industrialised England, with its new money and suburbanisation of the countryside, increasingly encroaches upon the leafy surroundings of Howards End. England is shifting from the rural to the (sub)urban.\n\nSimilarly, the Estonian family home at the center of Oksanen’s novel is representative of Estonia and its history. Up to the mid-1940s the country house is occupied by Ingel, Hans, their daughter, as well as Aliide and her parents. They are sympathetic to the German occupiers – which is evidenced by their inviting German soldiers over for a meal. But after the Red Army defeat the Germans, both Ingel and her daughter are thrown out of the house and deported to Siberia. Aliide, newly indoctrinated as a communist, becomes the new owner. Hans is forced into hiding – first in the forests surrounding the house, and later in an attic room within it. By hiding in a secret attic, Hans is a constant reminder to Aliide that the house is not a communist one – it is Estonian. In a sense, Hans becomes Aliide’s repressed consciousness that the ‘true’ owners of the house are non-communist Estonian. Towards the novel’s end, Aliide makes plans for Ingel’s return to her rightful home. This is in 1992 once Estonia is again an independent state.\n\nThe owners of the house therefore reflect the constant shifts in the wider political environment. The personal versus the political runs throughout the novel. The final chapters of the novel, for example, consist of top secret government documents drawn up by the Russian secret service in 1940s and 50s. They are concerned with the investigations into the disappearance of Hans. One document from 1946 simply mentions that Ingel and Aliide have been ‘brought in for questioning’. The violent rapes that occurred in an attempt to get Aliide or Ingel to reveal where Hans was hiding are, of course, not mentioned. This dispassionate and dry political document diverges completely from the women’s personal histories which make up the content of the novel.\n\nRemaking of history\n\nAfter Ingel is deported to Siberia and Aliide takes over the running of the family home, she seeks to wipe Ingel from her life. All photographs of her are removed and in a brilliant passage of writing Ingel’s wedding blanket is undone stitch-by-stitch by Aliide:\n\n“She found Ingel’s wedding blanket in a drawer. It had a church, and a house as plump as a mushroom, and a husband and wife stitched into the red background. Aliide tore off the six-pointed stars with a pair of scissors, tore the rickrack from around the edge of that map of happiness with her fingers, and the man and wife disappeared from the picture, just like that, the cow just shreds of yarn, the cross on the church nothing but fluff!” (pp.197-98)\n\nThis reminded me of the infamous removal of Trotsky from a photograph of him standing beside Lenin. In the original photograph Trotsky can be clearly seen on the podium, but after he fell out of favour with the authorities (and was later murdered by Stalin’s secret police), pfft!, out goes Trotsky from the photograph. By unstitching Ingel and her husband from their wedding blanket, Aliide behaves exactly like those communist authorities who expunged Trotsky from their history.\n\nPhotographs as a reminder of a history we’d rather forget is a theme which crops up time and again in ‘Purge’. For example, the old photograph which Zara shows the elderly Aliide and which depicts her standing beside Ingel when they were young girls is later burned by Aliide.\n\nIn summary, Oksanen’s novel is a terrific, thought-provoking read. I’ll eagerly await her other novels being translated into English. Or maybe I should learn Finnish?"
