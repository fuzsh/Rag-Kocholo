        "text": "The thesis studies the European anti-trafficking framework, comprehending relevant EU and Council of Europe instruments, and the narrative of trafficking that it creates. The aim of the thesis is to identify the assumptions and the imagery of trafficking upon which the framework is formed as well as the exclusions and blind spots that these assumptions create. The thesis analyses the legal framework by adopting a critical feminist methodology. It studies assumptions concerning gender and migration in the trafficking narrative by first focusing on a linkage between trafficking and prostitution policies, then on a linkage between trafficking and migration and finally on connections between trafficking and other forms of gender-based violence. Assumptions of what trafficking is are produced through linkages, and sometimes lacks of linkages, between these frameworks. The thesis argues that trafficking is assumed to involve organized criminal groups trafficking migrant women to the sex i...\n\nThis essay addresses the link between sex trafficking and European citizesnhip by examining several anti-trafficking campaigns launched in post-socialist Europe. In illustrating which techniques are used in the production of images, it points to the highly symbolic and stereotypical constructions of femininity (victims) and masculinity (criminals) of eastern European nationals. A close analysis of female bodies dispayed in the campaigns indicates that the use of victimizing images goes hand in hand with the erotization of women's bodies. Wounded and dead women's bodies are read as attempts to stabilize the current political and social transformations in Europe by capturing women within the highly immobile boundaries of the sign 'Woman'. The essay suggests that the representation of violence is thus violent itself since it confirms the stereotypes about eastern European women, equates the feminine with the passive object, severs the body from its materiality and from the historical context in which trafficking occurs, and finally confines women within the highly disabling symbolic register of 'Woman' as to maintain an imaginary social order in Europe.\n\nThe traumas of the twentieth century affected the development of trauma narrative in literature and cinema. A great amount of trauma theory in different disciplines developed largely from the Holocaust literature as well as from gender-based violence. The criticism of many examples in the contemporary trauma theory has been that it is applicable only to Western countries, not taking into account the difficult transitions between the non-Western and Western world. The countries that had gone through a brutal occupation of the Soviet Union, also experienced the trauma of transformation as whole societies into post-Soviet nations right next to the developed Nordic/Western states. This article will examine representations of trauma in Sofi Oksanen’s fictional narrative Purge (Puhdistus, 2008) and Lukas Moodysson’s cinematic narrative Lilya 4-Ever (Lilja 4-ever, Sweden/Denmark, 2002) and offer an analysis of the trauma of transitions in the borderland between post-Soviet and Nordic countries. Both Oksanen and Moodysson, as observers from the Nordic countries (Finland and Sweden respectively) have chosen to depict the post-Soviet trauma through a female body who is trapped in forced prostitution in Western Europe or Scandinavia and her emotions and reactions to her trauma. This article will argue that both authors contribute to the post-Cold War discourse that discusses the cultural borders between “East” and “West”, presenting a trauma of globalisation, drawing attention to the unspoken subjects, but also contributing to the existing views of post-Soviet spaces as ruined and traumatising.\n\nTaking the victim–criminal binary as its starting point, this chapter critically assesses current representations and understandings of ‘trafficking’ as a matter of organised crime and of the women involved as coerced and deceived victims. Accordingly, my interpretative approach does not focus on violence against women, a privileged topic among many feminist scholars and activists. Rather, by placing ‘trafficking’ in the context of European integration, I propose to shift the terms of analysis from violence and organised crime to those of migration and labour\n\nThis thesis elaborates on the socio-economic roots of trafficking in women, and it also argues that governments should develop a victim-centred approach and not view trafficking simply as a “law and order problem.” Trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation has reached unprecedented levels in the recent decades due to the economic consequences of globalization and the structural adjustments that countries of Eastern Europe and ex-USSR have undergone. In search for better economical conditions, women from these countries migrate to Western Europe with the hope of finding a better life; however, many find themselves trapped in the sex industry. The current profit of the sex industry from Eastern to Western Europe is estimated to be billions of dollars. Recognizing the scale of the trafficking phenomenon, the international community has taken steps in order to fight it. In the majority of cases, trafficking has been viewed as a “law and order” problem without paying too much attention to the rights of victims. The European Union lately has adopted a directive which aims to offer assistance to trafficking victims and protect them from further victimization by judicial authorities in cases when victims reside illegally in a member state. This thesis, in addition, emphasizes the need for member-states to issue residence permits to victims without limiting it to their cooperation with judicial authorities."
