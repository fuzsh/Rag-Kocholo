        "text": "The very streets of Dallas light up with a somber blue, a hue that's become the rallying cry against the night's darkest secret ‚Äì human trafficking. It was a privilege to have Bianca Davis, CEO of New Friends, New Life, join us to unravel this crisis that casts shadows over our city. With January marking National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, our conversation wove through the brutal realities of the trade, the importance of vigilance, and the powerful legislative milestones that propel our fight forward. Faced with the chilling statistic of four hundred trafficked teen girls a night in Dallas alone, the magnitude of this issue is staggering. We dug into the subtle yet coercive tactics that traffickers use to ensnare victims, often exploiting the most vulnerable among us. Awareness is our strongest weapon, and this dialogue serves as an urgent call to action for all. It's not just about recognizing the signs; it's about understanding the hidden languages of control and manipulation that traffickers speak. And it's not only about the victims but also the demand that fuels this black-market industry. Engaging men in the conversation around sex trafficking, through innovative programs like the manKINDness Project, is pivotal in dismantling the societal constructs that allow such exploitation to thrive. In crafting a future free from these chains, we highlighted the vital partnerships between support networks like Genesis and New Friends New Life. Their collaborative efforts not only rescue survivors but also equip them with the tools to rebuild and thrive. Our episode is a clarion call ‚Äì a plea for engagement and education in the digital age where predators lurk behind screens, targeting our youth. Together, we can turn awareness into action and transform the narrative of human trafficking.\n\nIf you know me, you know that raising awareness and educating others about Human Trafficking is a cause close to my heart. Today, on World Day Against Human Trafficking, I want to share some critical information about this pervasive issue: Common Types of Human Trafficking: - Forced Labor: Individuals are compelled to work against their will, often under threats or as a form of indentured servitude. - Sex Trafficking: Victims are coerced into performing sexual acts. - Child Soldiers: Children are exploited as combatants in conflicts. Key Statistics: - 49.6 million people are currently trapped in modern slavery worldwide, including 12 million children. (ILO, UN) - 54% of these victims are women and girls, with the remaining 46% being men and boys. (ILO) - In the U.S., sex trafficking is the most prevalent form of trafficking. (Polaris) - Child sex trafficking has been reported in all 50 states. (NCMEC) - Human trafficking generates a staggering $150 billion annually. (UNICEF) - It is the second most profitable illegal industry in the U.S. (UNICEF) Let‚Äôs use this day to amplify our efforts in combating human trafficking and supporting its victims. Your awareness and action can make a significant difference. #humantrafficking #HT101 #HTAwareness To learn more.. take a listen: https://lnkd.in/gtVEVEHN\n\nToday I received a telephone call from a producer who is looking for someone to discuss human trafficking on their national television show. They asked if they could ask me a few questions about what we do at the Human Trafficking Training Center and about human trafficking. I provided him with an overview about what we do and why it is important, some statistics from our trainings and a few points to show that we are losing the battle on trafficking in America. He immediately went into the topics he would like discussed on the show. I explained to him that these topics will do nothing to stop trafficking in America. He just continued speaking and so I again said, ‚ÄúSir I want to make sure we understand one another, all the things you are speaking about will do nothing to stop trafficking in America, perhaps we should tell them the truth‚Äù. He then stopped and said, ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù. I explained to him in detail, why the things he wanted to discuss are not practical and he then responded by pushing back against me and saying that he thought that maybe I was not a good fit for his show. I said first I never said I would do your show and second you called me, so if you are not going to give the public the true and accurate picture of trafficking in America you are right, I am not a good fit. He then stated thanks for your time and hung up. This is the fourth or fifth time this has happened to me concerning television and major media. Clearly, they have an agenda and clearly, they want to push something to America that is not true or accurate about trafficking. And lastly, they clearly do not have victims, children, or Americas best interests at heart. #humantrafficking #police #policetraining #training #lawenforcement"
