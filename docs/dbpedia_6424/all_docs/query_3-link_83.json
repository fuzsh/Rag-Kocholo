        "text": "Tomás, Júlia (2014). “Trafficking in human beings and media discourses”, 1st Global Conference on Sexuality, Oppression and Human Rights, 30-31 July 2014. Oxford: Mansfield College. Draft paper: http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/critical-issues/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Tomássexpaper.pdf. Regarding sexual exploitation, the problem clearly resides in the fact that fighting sex trafficking is often conflated with fighting prostitution. In many countries the boundary between both activities is unclear. As a consequence, many sex workers – and especially immigrant prostitutes – face violent law enforcement operations, raids and arrests. Currently mass media not only fails to help detecting victims but also contribute to the marginalisation of sex workers. Due to the growing visibility of human trafficking in the media, it is important to critically analyse the current discourses on the issue and to highlight certain social representations and stereotypes.\n\nThe paper focuses on the problem of human trafficking highlighted in media. The conceptual analysis of this situation shows the existence of an iconic structure of the cobweb-like shape. This image can be used as the basis of iconic framing technique in the warning and prevention programs aimed at combatting human trafficking, with the target audience embracing the vulnerable social groups. Understanding how this social agenda is “refracted” through the cobweb picture in media texts allows to develop specific techniques of raising public awareness through iconic framing. In particular, the interest lies in correlation of iconic representations and respective verbal elements that reinforce visual effects such as “to be caught in a cobweb of human trafficking”. Based on the approach described herein, a “toolkit” of verbal means activating the cobweb image has been analysed and recommended as an applicable technique for social awareness campaigns against human trafficking\n\nThe collection introduction defines human trafficking and proceeds to offer an in-depth literature review that assesses the significance of attention to the collection topic, suggests new directions for research, and provides a synopsis and integrative analysis of the collective contributions of manuscripts within the collection. It starts by detailing the story of human trafficking (the types, causes, and frames of trafficking), then discusses the effects of misrepresentation on the directly affected (draws on victim hierarchy, criminalisation and secondary victimisation), and then deals with the socio-political causes and effects of misrepresentation (gender and wealth inequality, global and local politics, and secondary exploitation). It ends by providing a rationale as to the nature of the case studies the book and its contributors consider.\n\nThe paper draws its argument from the rationality of criminal activities. The media and its massive consumption is a causative of the good and the bad therefore it has a stake in being both a vehicle that facilitates human trafficking and may also create the demand for the trafficking. Creating sexual desires, as a method for payment without the recognition of who is paying and the mass consumption of cellular phone usage."
