Jonathan Demme's suspenseful story about a young female FBI agent trying to catch a serial killer remains a chilling look at pure evil.

Anthony Hopkins gives a remarkable Academy Award-winning performance as best actor and this movie will keep you guessing what will happen next until the credits roll.\n\n#28.

A cast including Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pierce, and James Cromwell will make the best out of any story, but this script gives them plenty to work with throughout the film. All four play those hard-boiled cops people love to see gripe about the racket, but they thrive while solving crimes and uncovering corruption. They do both amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.\n\n#23. No Country for Old Men (2007)\n\n- Directors: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen\n\n- Stacker score: 90\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Runtime: 122 minutes\n\nEthan and Joel Coen are back on this list for yet another spectacular crime drama.

On the Waterfront (1954)\n\n- Director: Elia Kazan\n\n- Stacker score: 90\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Runtime: 108 minutes\n\nMarlon Brando gives his quintessential performance as a washed-up boxer mixed up with the mob. The story revolves around characters playing deaf-and-dumb to all the mob's crimes when the police start poking around. The irony of it is that director Elia Kazan famously named names during the famous House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings that blacklisted several of Hollywood's most talented and ruined their careers in the early 1950s. The allegory of the film is impossible to ignore while watching, but it does not get in the way of this great crime melodrama.\n\n#21.

His character Luke is one of the coolest in cinema history and becomes a symbol of hope in this prison camp controlled by power-hungry guards. The movie also features great performances from Harry Dean Stanton and Dennis Hopper.\n\n#19.

The Irishman (2019)\n\n- Director: Martin Scorsese\n\n- Stacker score: 90\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.9\n\n- Runtime: 209 minutes\n\nMartin Scorsese's latest film is an epic in every sense of the word. He brought together several stars that are staples in this genre, including Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, and Robert De Niro. Scorsese tells what he thinks happened to politician Jimmy Hoffa when he went missing in 1975. It's a tale of growing old and coming to terms with what you did to survive, all with the comedy, violence, and ruthlessness that Scorsese does so well.\n\n#17.

This is because of terrific performances from Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, and more. Christopher Nolan knows how to make a simple comic book story into a bleak look at human life all while delivering exciting action sequences. This sequel to \"Batman Begins\" is often more talked about than the first movie, but best experienced after the first movie.\n\n#16. A Brighter Summer Day (1991)\n\n- Director: Edward Yang\n\n- Stacker score: 91\n\n- Metascore: 90\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Runtime: 237 minutes\n\nThe 1960s rise of Western culture in Taiwan means the traditional Taiwanese culture and way of life is in danger in this emotional drama. Civil unrest and violence affects young lovers as they navigate romance for the first time, making for a tragic end. It's crime cinema at its finest: beautiful and detrimental all at the same time.\n\n#15.

It's an underseen classic crime drama made for those who love film noir.\n\n#11. Goodfellas (1990)\n\n- Director: Martin Scorsese\n\n- Stacker score: 92\n\n- Metascore: 90\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.7\n\n- Runtime: 146 minutes\n\nIt's time to admit that Martin Scorsese basically owns this genre, which includes this gangster drama starring Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci. The trio navigate the mobster families of New York, but some never quite make it into the inner circle of \"made\" men that run the game. With a killer soundtrack and atmospheric scenes in the heart of New York, Scorsese depicts the world he knows best.\n\n#10. Taxi Driver (1976)\n\n- Director: Martin Scorsese\n\n- Stacker score: 92\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.3\n\n- Runtime: 114 minutes\n\nRobert De Niro stars as a radicalized Vietnam veteran Travis trying to survive in crime-ridden New York City during the 1970s. He befriends a young sex worker played by a very young Jodie Foster and falls in love with Betsy played by Cybill Shepard, who works for a politician Travis plans on assassinating. Scorsese's look at this outcast character is one of the best examinations of a bad guy doing bad things.\n\n#9. Double Indemnity (1944)\n\n- Director: Billy Wilder\n\n- Stacker score: 93\n\n- Metascore: 95\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.3\n\n- Runtime: 107 minutes\n\nThis quintessential film noir lives up to its reputation as an American classic. Billy Wilder directs this story about an insurance salesman who gets seduced by a woman set on killing her husband. There's double-crossing like no other film noir out there, making an exciting and surprising drama you won't be able to predict.\n\n#8. Rififi (1955)\n\n- Director: Jules Dassin\n\n- Stacker score: 93\n\n- Metascore: 97\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.2\n\n- Runtime: 118 minutes\n\nHollywood blacklisted director Jules Dassin, but that didn't stop him from making this dynamic crime thriller in France. A group of criminals band together to rob a high end jewelry store, but this is not your typical heist movie. With very little dialogue and extended heist scenes, the silence rings louder than any bombastic crime drama in comparison.\n\n#7.

In West Virginia, he targets a family he knows has money hidden, but doesn't know where. Only the son of the family knows where, and he will do everything he can to keep his dad's money safe.\n\nYou may also like: Iconic quotes from '70s movies\n\n#5. The Godfather: Part II (1974)\n\n- Director: Francis Ford Coppola\n\n- Stacker score: 94\n\n- Metascore: 90\n\n- IMDb user rating: 9\n\n- Runtime: 202 minutes\n\nThe aftermath of Francis Ford Coppola's first film, \"The Godfather,\" gives this sequel a great foundation for an enticing story. In what many consider to be the best sequel of all time, Michael, played by Al Pacino, struggles to reconcile with the power he now has as Vito, played by Robert De Niro, struggles to survive. Coppola's impeccable follow-up to an incredible original is a must-see for any fans of the crime genre.\n\n#4.

A woman is sexually assaulted and her husband dies shortly after, but each story in court implicates a different person. The virality of truth is explored in this enticing drama unlike usual samurai films.\n\n#3. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\n- Director: Quentin Tarantino\n\n- Stacker score: 95\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.9\n\n- Runtime: 154 minutes\n\nTarantino tells the story of two hit men—a prize-fighting boxer and a heroin addict—but in a narrative that's completely out of order. This tactic adds to the artistic touch Tarantino has for every scene. The dialogue is smart and the violence shocking. It'll be hard to watch any movie that doesn't challenge the way stories are told after seeing this.\n\n#2. 12 Angry Men (1957)\n\n- Director: Sidney Lumet\n\n- Stacker score: 96\n\n- Metascore: 96\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.9\n\n- Runtime: 96 minutes\n\nA young 18-year-old is on trial for murder and 12 men are in charge of deciding whether he lives a free man or dies on death row. One juror holds out on voting, keeping all the men in one room until they can vote unanimously. If you think men arguing in a single room will be boring, this movie is anything but that.\n\n#1. The Godfather (1972)\n\n- Director: Francis Ford Coppola\n\n- Stacker score: 100\n\n- Metascore: 100\n\n- IMDb user rating: 9.2\n\n- Runtime: 175 minutes\n\nIn Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, the Italian mafia Corleone family is shaken when warfare breaks out among the five mafia families in the story.
