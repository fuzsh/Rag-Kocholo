'Lilya 4-Ever,' critically acclaimed feature-length film about trafficking to be screened in East Village

New York â€” Lilya 4-Ever, a critically acclaimed feature-length film by award-winning Swedish Director Lukas Moodysson, will be the focus of a special screening at 7pm on Tuesday June 14th at the Ukrainian CYM building, 136 Second Street (btw ST. Marks and 9th Street) on the 2nd Floor.

Through a heart-wrenching vignette of post-Soviet realism, the film, which received the award for Best Swedish Film in 2002, reveals the aching portrait of an Eastern European 16-year old, who through a series of events including abandonment, lack of employment opportunities and the lure of a dream to overcome her economic circumstances, finds herself sold into sexual slavery in Sweden. This phenomenon reverberates throughout Ukraine, one of the largest source countries of trafficking victims

While exact numbers are difficult to pinpoint, roughly 75% of the apprehended cases of trafficking victims in the New York area in the past year have been from Eastern Europe - about 50% comprise young women and children from Ukraine. Criminal organizations prey on women, offering what seem like legitimate jobs abroad, then confiscating passports and brutally coercing them into working in the sex industry."

Although Ukraine was one of the first countries in Europe to formally criminalize human trafficking by adopting Article 149 in its new Criminal Code to make human trafficking an indictable criminal offence, more can be done in destination cities such as New York to raise the awareness of trafficking scope and impact among policy-makers and the public-at-large. Sponsors for the event include Amnesty International Firefly Project, CAT-USA and Isadora Productions For further information email Isadora Productions at info@isadoraproductions.org
