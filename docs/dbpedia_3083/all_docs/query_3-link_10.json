        "text": "In Arthur’s instance, we see how a strong role model, his mother, helps lead Arthur through some enormously difficult challenges and ultimately to success-achieving his high school diploma and having opportunity to attend college. In 1995 Arthur finished his senior year of basketball at Arkansas State University. Arthur was one of the team leaders and recognized as one of the best players in his conference.\n\nArthur received his degree in Radio & Television from Arkansas State University. Today, Arthur is 44 years old and is the President/Founder of his Arthur Agee Jr Role Model Foundation. He also teaches the Hoop Dreams life skills education curriculum that was built around the film.\n\nArthur is filled with intelligence, humor, and a sense of wit. Most important, Arthur knows the value of role models and how it helped him achieve his dreams, not only on the court, but more important, in life. Arthur has realized another dream; he has started a sportswear clothing line named after the movie Hoop Dreams. The message Arthur brings in his sportswear line is “IF YOU CONTROL YOUR DESTINY YOU CAN LIVE YOUR HOOP DREAMS.”\n\nThe pop-culture phenomenon Hoop Dreams was one of the most revered films of the 1990’s. The documentary follows the lives of two talented teenage basketball players, Arthur Agee and William Gates, who aspired to leave behind their deprived Chicago neighborhoods and pursue their passion to make it to the NBA. Their complicated family and professional lives, however, moved them towards unexpected outcomes, devoid of NBA stardom. In this presentation, Arthur Agee brings the audience into the intimate world of Hoop Dreams, and using his own experiences, helps paint a vivid picture of the Chicago ghetto and the socio-economic variables that challenged his family and community. Agee demonstrates to audiences what it takes to face adversity and helps define true resilience.\n\n\"Arthur Agee is a role model for us all.\"\n\n- President Clinton\n\n\"A film like “Hoop Dreams” is what movies are for…We learn, for example, of how their (Arthur’s) extended families pull together to help give kids a chance. How if one family member is going through a period of trouble, others seem to rise to periods of strength. It (“Hoop Dreams”) is one of the great movie-going experiences of my lifetime.\"\n\n- Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times\n\n\"Arthur knew he had to get out Chicago to escape gangs and drug dealers…Arthur is preparing for life after basketball. He conducts a pair of two-honor sports and news shows each week on the campus (Arkansas State) radio station… He is majoring in radio-television and is learning about marketing and public relations. He can’t wait to return to Marshall (Arthur’s high school) and say to his old coach:” Look at me now. You thought I was going to be a nobody.”\n\n- Chicago Sun-Times\n\n\"Closing night, New York International Film Festival, after showing of “Hoop Dreams”: We didn’t announce that the families (Arthur’s family) were going to be there. At the end of the film, very dramatically, a spotlight shone on the box. The families stood up-and the place erupted into this standing ovation that went on. One of the people associated with the festival for 25 years, said she’d never seen an ovation like that for any film at the end of a festival.\"\n\n- Chicago Tribune"
