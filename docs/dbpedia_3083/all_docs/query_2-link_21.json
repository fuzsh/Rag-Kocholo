        "text": "Amazingly well put! Other than the particulars to fill out the edges of each \"case\", I think you have hit the nail on the head, Rick.\n\nI think what is so difficult for us \"betrayed spouses\" to get is that the \"reasons\" our unfaithful spouses give for choosing that other person are really sometimes just their excuses, and justifications, in the form of criticisms of their spouse that they had to capitalize on in order to justify this act to themselves; while the \"real\" reasons are oftentimes a LOT more along the lines of what you have stated here.\n\nAnyway, hurting people, I pray you don't beat yourselves up by believing the \"lies\" involved in adultery. Those lies are lies that your spouse has told himself/herself in order to justify adultery. If you are married, then adultery is sin, pure and simple. Don't blame yourself. Help your spouse blame himself for his/her choices. Go way into being angry about it, and venting your feelings -- and get it out of your system, before you EVER even agree to discuss any kind of \"mutual blame\" for the breakdown of the marriage. You want to see that person take responsibility and work hard to win YOU back, and see them repent toward God. Wait for that. If they don't know Him, they need to, and if you both don't -- read the gospels in the KJV, and see for yourself what adultery is.\n\nAnyone with a conscience, HAS to have had come up with \"something\" to use as an excuse. They peddle the lie to themselves, first; to their affair partner next; and finally to you -- when it comes out. Sometimes they peddle it to friends and colleagues and family members as well, but it is always \"peddling\", and it is always a \"lie\". The real reason they did this was because they wanted to. They were drawn aside by their own lust (even of their own mind, having little to do with sex appeal of affair partner etc.), and enticed, and sinned. You did not MAKE them do anything! Any honest person on the adulterous/adulteress side of this will admit they have come up with a justification, that involves blame, or excuses, and has nothing to do with the responsibility of this act being someone else's.\n\nI have the unique perspective of having been on both sides of this, more than once. I know that if \"I\" had been allowed to vent and process the first time this happened to me as a \"victim\", I would not have later been able to come up with \"he did it to me\" as an excuse for my own affairs. If I had had my spouse (at the time) vent and process with me (after I did commit adultery), I would have dealt with \"all of it\", and it would have changed my thinking in my next relationship.\n\nI believe I would have seen my own emotional affairs sneaking up on me, and prevented them -- seen them for what they were (sin) and been truly sorry to my spouse; and I might have actually seen the danger coming with my second spouse, before he cheated.\n\nLive and learn! It's best to learn from someone else's mistakes if you can, before you have to learn the hard way.\n\nYes, I am a flawed person, and I did contribute to the breakdown of my marriages, through lack of communication --- but not because I did (or didn't do) x, y, and z --- excuses used by my mate(s) to commit adultery. The flaws of the injured spouse should NEVER be addressed anywhere close to the time of disclosure of an adulterous affair though.\n\nThis is a mistake I made over the past year and a half after the disclosure of my husband's adultery. My husband is still involved in his second emotional affair (long-term fantasy) and has left me, believing his problem is that I am flawed, and refusing to examine himself.\n\nI have truly learned the hard way! And now, thanks to information, such as this article, I can begin the arduous task of healing alone, and planning not to make any of these mistakes again. I am really thankful for this article, Rick. Bless you for being on target with it! And bless those of you who are going through this. Try hard to be straight with one another. It IS sin, and it does bring forth death. Don't try to sidestep the issue and miss real repentance, healing, and reconciliation. You need to get clear of the real flaws inside the perpetrator (first that they can and will make excuses, and second that they probably don't communicate their own emotions very well, and third that they may have past baggage that has not yet, but needs to be dealt with so they can really relate to another person lovingly).\n\nDavid Clarke in his book: What to do when your spouse says, \"I Don't Love You, Anymore.\" says that you need to get out of the shock & denial -- and bring on the buried anger as quickly as possible. This would have been good for me to hear up front.\n\nI stayed in shock and denial a LONG time in my second marriage after \"discovering\" my \"loving\" husband's long term entangled (sexual & emotional) affair (lasting 5 years total).\n\nIf I had been truly angry, perhaps he wouldn't have been able to \"hide\" his second (becoming long term) \"emotional\" affair, from me for six whole months after initial revelation, or to take six months to completely tell me about the first affair. Anger has a purpose, and it shouldn't just be a day or two or on occasion that you let it out. You need to let it out until it is gone! Don't hide your feelings and chase your adulterous spouse, like I did. Learn from my mistake. Oh sure, he knew I was mad, and in pain, but he also thought I was a nice door mat -- to take his affair with such \"grace\". He decided he still needed the one he \"hid\" from me. These really ARE \"his\" problems, they are sins, and they affect me. Adultery is Never \"fair\"; it is \"cheating\"... Let the anger that this causes out. There is a good chance your adultery spouse will be shocked at your righteous indignation. There is a 100% chance they need to know it exists. If you don't get good and angry, and get it out of your system, there is a chance you will not be able to fully forgive when the time comes! Don't lie to yourself or your mate and forgive early. Be real. God does understand.\n\nHear this article, and don't blame yourself or your marriage for \"making\" your spouse cheat on you. Realize they have real issues communicating, and with morality. Address this by communicating your anger (so they know it exists) and asking hard-hitting questions. Get a good counselor early on, one that doesn't have you \"just hug\" and make up, or be a better wife/husband.\n\nGet a counselor that sees this as a sin problem and doesn't let up on the cheater until they break.\n\n\"I\" would have appreciated it, as a cheater. It would have given me a chance to \"clean my own clock\" with God and get straightened out in my conscience and thinking (to really decide what I wanted to do, not just pretend everything was OK, and pretend I loved my spouse) and have prevented subsequent \"sins\" of adultery on my part.\n\nAnd yes, emotional affairs are adultery, too. I've had both, and my current spouse has had both. I recall thinking, \"If only this had 'only' been 'emotional' and not sexual, then maybe I could get over it easier.\" They really lie to themselves (and everyone else) if it is \"only emotional\", and it is actually harder for them to see it as \"sin\". It is. Remember what Jesus said. If your spouse is \"in love\" with someone else, I guarantee the lip-service they give you about loving you -- is just that, \"lip service\". Don't believe the lies, and get and stay angry -- until you see real changes! It's never too late to \"feel\" your feelings. Forgive, but not until it is \"real\". Give your unforgiveness to God, and tell Him what you are doing. I guarantee, if you are being encouraged to look at your \"fault\" in your spouse's adultery, you are setting yourself up for a prolonged amount of pain. Clean the temple of your marriage!\n\nGod bless you with healed marriage, or the dignity to walk away \"well\"!\n\nWhen I found out my H of 26y had an affair with a girl the same age as our son, very overweight and not attractive in the slightest, I couldn't understand how he could throw away his entire life for her. He knew her for 2 weeks when he left me and moved in with her. He told her he loved her after 3 days! This girl was 29. He was 50. Thank God he came home after 3 weeks (no STD's or pregnancies).\n\nAfter finally getting all the details, I know why he had an affair with her:\n\n1. She knew he was married but pretended to believe his lies about being separated. She knew exactly what to say.\n\n2. She was playing the victim and my husband played the hero. She boosted his ego.\n\n3. She wanted to be the girlfriend of a popular biker. She had a goal.\n\n4. He told her no one could know about her, and she was fine with that. She had no respect for herself.\n\n5. She had no kids or responsibilities so she could drink and party every night. She was nothing but fun.\n\n6. She offered to let him move into her home. She handed him the \"solution\" to his bad marriage.\n\nMy husband was going through a mid-life crisis after his parents passed and he lost his job. He did something that he would have never done in a million years because he was both sick and naive. This person was a friend of our daughter and knew he was married. When she caught his attention and saw that he was eating it up, she knew this guy would fall for her helpless victim act and she could steal him from me. And, she was right...it worked. But they both couldn't keep their lies going for long because he realized he was being played and came home.\n\nI've finally been able to open my husband's eyes to the reality of the entire affair. He now sees what everyone else sees in her and is so embarrassed. He can't believe he thought he loved her and feels so stupid (it was limerence and that was real...but never love). He now sees how she manipulated him to get what she wanted (Stache's Girlfriend) and how he fell for it. He believed he was the one in control the whole time and looking back, he sees that she used her \"victim act\" to get him to do anything she wanted. He feels so foolish (kind of how they made me feel...sorry, not sorry).\n\nSo, my husband and I are finally at a good place after 2 years since D-day and 4 years since his affair. He finally decided to try the \"You have to hurt her to help her heal\" conversation that needs to happen before we could ever get past this. He told me everything I wanted to know, even though the truth hurt. Now, there is nothing to hide and we have the most honest and productive conversations that I've been waiting for for years.\n\nGood luck all and God Bless"
