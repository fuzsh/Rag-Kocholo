        "text": "NOW PLAYING\n\nThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert *** (Palo Alto Square) In this original, entertaining telling of the show-must-go-on legend, there is energy, chutzpah and charm to spare. Felicia, Mitzi and Bernadette--two transvestites and one transsexual--have a cabaret act that consists of lip-syncing to tapes while strutting about in Carmen Miranda-goes-disco costumes. The three set out from Sydney, Australia for a gig in Alice Springs. Drinking, bitching, sewing costumes and rehearsing, they wind their way through Australia's vast outback. This may sound like a drag to you, but you don't know Felicia, Mitzi and Bernadette (Guy Pearce, Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp, respectively). Supremely self-aware, devoted to style and performance, and as acid-tongued as Margo Channing, they are a very funny and very appealing trio--an act you shouldn't miss. Rated R. 1 hour, 47 min. --L.S.\n\nThe Browning Version *** (Guild) A stately portrait of a man and a place, this film is set in Dorset at a \"public\" boys' school from which a longtime classics professor is retiring. Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney) is a stern taskmaster whom his students have dubbed \"The Hitler of the Fifth Form.\" But what the boys don't see, and what Finney reveals with great skill, is that the man's stoicism comes at a great inner cost. Though he's full of intellectual passion, he has alienated his young wife (Greta Scacchi), an exposed nerve of a woman who is revelling in an affair with a visiting American teacher (Matthew Modine). This portrait, adapted from the Terence Rattigan play, is intelligent and tasteful, but does somewhat just hang there. The pace, covering two days of the professor's long goodbye, is ceremonial; the story is all situation, little drama. Except for a breathtaking pyrotechnical moment and some slo-mo cricket, director Mike Figgis plays it close to the vest. Rated R. 1 hour, 45 minutes. --M.V.\n\nClear and Present Danger **** (Century 16, UA 6) Intelligent plotting, swift bursts of action and an appealing performance by Harrison Ford make this the summer's most satisfying action entertainment. Ford plays Jack Ryan, a CIA bureaucrat who unexpectedly becomes the agency's acting director, as the president of the United States initiates a politically motivated covert operation against a Colombian drug lord. A danger to the president's men, who fear he many reveal their misdeeds, and an enemy to the Colombian drug lords, who make him a scapegoat as they double-cross each other, Ryan finds himself the pawn in a series of overlapping chess games. To their credit, director Phillip Noyce (\"Patriot Games\") and his cadre of screenwriters avoid the pretense of caring about the evils of drugs and politics. Instead, they keep the film firmly focused on the chess games, and they also keep it moving. Rated R. 2 hours, 16 min. --L.S.\n\nEat Drink Man Woman ** 1/2 (Aquarius) This film from Ang Lee does for Chinese food what \"Babette's Feast,\" \"Tampopo\" and \"Like Water For Chocolate\" did for French, Japanese and Mexican cuisine. Lee (\"The Wedding Banquet\") is making his mark probing the chasms between Chinese children and parents, men and women, and past and present. This time, he adds misconceptions about the elderly to the mix. Set in Taipei, the story follows the lives and meals of a widower and his three daughters. Taiwan has changed, children have changed, even Chinese cooking has changed. As a result, the widower has lost his sense of taste, and seems to be on the verge of losing his taste for life as well. Unlike the food, the movie's central drama takes a while to heat up, but offers lovely rewards at the end. Not rated. 2 hours, 3 min. --D.S.\n\nEd Wood ** 1/2 (Century 16, UA 6) This film follows eccentric 1950s filmmaker Edward D. Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp) and his merry band of misfits as they slap together some of the worst movie stories of all time: the transvestite saga \"Glen or Glenda?\" and the delightfully bad \"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\" Depp plays Wood to perfection, with a speech cadence right out of a bad movie and an oily smile that suggests sleaziness and sincerity at the same time. Martin Landau, as the washed-up Bela Lugosi, makes the picture come alive; unfortunately, the last half falters without him. Here, as in most of his films, director Tim Burton's purpose is to prove that misfits and oddballs are sensitive, worthwhile human beings. In this sense, he succeeds mightily. Rated R. 2 hours, 5 min. --N.M.\n\nHoop Dreams *** 1/2 (Century 16) It's almost cruel the way \"Hoop Dreams\" keeps you on the edge of your seat, entirely caught up in the successes and failures of two young inner-city Chicago boys who are recruited to play basketball at a suburban prep school. The documentary follows William Gates and Arthur Agee for almost five years as they struggle with adolescence, family crises and economic pressures--all the while jumping through various hoops in order to get basketball scholarships to college. \"Hoop Dreams\" carries with it all the elements of a good fictional sports movie: plenty of nail-biting buzzer shots, plenty of triumph over adversity. But being a true story, the wins at the buzzer don't solve all the boys' problems, and the triumphs they experience are tempered by reality. Rated PG-13. Two hours, 51 minutes. --N.M.\n\nJason's Lyric ** (UA 6) Doug McHenry attempts to fuse a dreamy poetic feeling with the violence of the urban gang landscape. The result is an ambitious, yet awkward mess. The story concerns two brothers who are haunted by the specter of their alcoholic father (Forest Whitaker), who was killed by one of the sons. Years later, the \"good\" son Jason works a steady job and takes care of his mother and his \"bad\" brother, Josh, who is in and out of jail. Into this mix comes the lovely Lyric (Jada Pinkett), the sister of a neighborhood gangster, who falls in love with Jason, subsequently threatening the brothers' relationship. With elements of the Cain and Abel conflict, \"Oedipus Rex\" and \"Romeo and Juliet,\" this film becomes too convoluted for its own good. Rated R. 1 hour, 59 min. --N.M.\n\nLove Affair *** (Century 16, Century 12) Warren Beatty, along with wife Annette Bening and director Glenn Gordon Caron, brings the third iteration of the romantic and tragic \"Love Affair\" to life. \"Love Affair\" was originally made in 1939, then bronzed as a classic in 1957 with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in \"An Affair to Remember.\" Two strangers meet on a trip and, although betrothed to others, fall fatefully in love. They promise to meet in three month's time, but an accident keeps them apart. With gloriously filmed settings in New York and Tahiti and a streamlined dialogue, \"Love Affair\" is a delight for those who know the story and those who don't. Beatty, as screenwriter, producer and star, spared no expense. His performance does, however, lack some of the energy emitted by Bening and some members of the superb supporting cast, including Garry Shandling, Chloe Webb, Pierce Brosnan and Kate Capshaw. Katharine Hepburn makes her first screen appearance since 1981. Rated PG-13. 1 hour, 45 minutes. --S.I.\n\nOnly You *** (Century 16, Century 12) Director Norman Jewison revisits the same territory of the heart that he mapped out in \"Moonstruck,\" and the results are just as delightful. This time, Cinderella is a schoolteacher, appropriately named Faith (Marisa Tomei), who is convinced that destiny will deliver Prince Charming and the love of a lifetime to her. After all, both a Ouja board and an old gypsy fortune-teller gave her the same name when she was a child: Damon Bradley. Fourteen years later, the friend of her boring fiance calls to say he'll miss their wedding because of a business trip to Italy. He identifies himself by the magic name and before you can say \"Roman Holiday,\" Faith is running to catch his flight. Shoes suitable for a prince to pick up (or Robert Downey Jr.), droll humor supplied by a sister-in-law sidekick (Bonnie Hunt) and surprising twists and turns along the road to romance make for escapist fun. Rated PG. 1 hour, 48 min. --S.T.\n\nPulp Fiction ** (Century 16, Century 12) This eagerly awaited second feature by Quentin Tarantino is stylish and nihilistic, rife with lowlifes and misfits. The movie tells three intersecting tales: the nervous lovebirds (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) knocking off a greasy spoon; the bumbling hit men (Samuel Jackson and John Travolta) analyzing the downside of hitting on the boss' wife; and the palooka (Bruce Willis) on the run after not taking a dive. They're all compulsive, with both their guns and their mouths, and what sprays from the latter is a mix of pop culture, profanity and lurid threats. This fictional world, though rendered imaginatively, can't sustain the movie. Tarantino keeps repeating his effects. Time and time again, characters are taunted at gunpoint. Time and again, grisly melodrama is played against mundane chitchat. Time and again, the plot shifts consciously. Rated R. 2 hours, 34 minutes. --M.V.\n\nQuiz Show ** 1/2 (Century 16, Century 12) A decade before TV news brought the Vietnam War into our homes and ended what has been described as our collective national innocence, a much-publicized TV quiz show scandal left America with a taste of the seductive power of this new medium of entertainment. Academy Award-winning director Robert Redford's \"Quiz Show\" is more a metaphor for America's lost innocence than it is a compelling story. Redford wields the camera with his usual grace and spares nothing on the period detail. But his telling of this inherently undramatic scandal doesn't get us close enough to the characters to really explore the moral dilemmas. Ralph Fiennes is acceptable, but not stellar, in the thin role of Charles Van Doren, the Ivy League golden boy who is seduced by the deceptive tactics of the \"Twenty One\" producers. Rob Morrow (\"Northern Exposure\") overplays his role as a virtuous Congressional investigator. John Turturro, however, is brilliant as the comically pathetic shlemiel who tips off Congress to the dirty dealings at NBC. Rated PG-13. 2 hours, 10 min. --M.H.\n\nThe River Wild **1/2 (Century 16, Century 12) While enjoying a white-water rafting trip on a river where she once worked as a guide, Gail (Meryl Streep) and her family are taken prisoners--first psychologically, then physically--by Kevin Bacon and his henchman (John C. Reilly). For a film like this to work, the story needs a few good twists. But twists are in short supply here. As in his most effective thriller, \"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle,\" director Curtis Hanson provides some good, creepy moments in the process of slowly revealing to Streep and her family that the somewhat appealing stranger in their midst is, in fact, a psychopath. Bacon is effectively creepy and Streep is convincingly strong, but their solid performances are no substitute for what \"The River Wild\" sorely lacks: a grain of real suspense. Rated PG-13. 1 hour, 48 min. --L.S.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption * 1/2 (Century 16, Century 12) A young banker (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to life in prison for a double murder he did not commit. While incarcerated in a prison where sadism and sodomy are the order of the day, the banker 1) uncovers a witness who can probably prove his innocence, and 2) gets his hands on proof that the prison warden is corrupt. So does the bright young banker contact his lawyer? Not a chance. That would ruin this film's completely implausible plot. While affecting the veneer of realism in order to impress upon us the horrors of prison life, \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" based on a Stephen King novella, continually abandons plausibility. Lest we miss the message, Morgan Freeman is on hand to play the wise old convict with a heart of gold and to continuously spout homilies such as, \"There are some birds that can't be caged. Their feathers are just too bright.\" Rated R. 2 hours, 25 min. --L.S."
