        "text": "Retired acting legend Daniel Day-Lewis has been pictured in public for the first time in years.\n\nThe reclusive three-time Oscar winner, who made his last movie in 2017, attempted to go incognito as he ran errands in New York City on Thursday, covering up in dark sunglasses and a black baseball cap.\n\nBut the 66-year-old star’s identity was given away by the fact that he was using a flip phone — a device that he went viral for using back in 2018.\n\nDay-Lewis was also spotted signing his name as he picked up his package during his day out in the Big Apple.\n\nThe “Gangs of New York” star is famous for his quirky fashion sense, and he didn’t disappoint during Thursday’s outing.\n\nIn addition to the baseball cap, Day-Lewis defied his years by rocking a black-and-blue sweatsuit.\n\nThe British-born actor, who shaved his head in 2017, now sports silver shoulder-length locks, which he let flow freely.\n\nOn Friday, the star was spotted for the second time in as many days, donning the same cap and glasses as he walked hand-in-hand with longtime wife, Rebecca Miller, 60.\n\nThe “My Left Foot” star splits his time between New York City and Annamoe, Ireland, with Miller, to whom he has been married since 1996. The couple share sons, Ronan, 24, and Cashel, 21.\n\nRonan recently graduated from Yale, while Cashel currently attends Oberlin College in Ohio.\n\nDay-Lewis is also father to son, Gabriel, 28, from a previous relationship with French star Isabelle Adjani.\n\nGabriel has followed in his father’s footsteps and is now pursuing an acting career.\n\nMeanwhile, Day-Lewis famously retired from the biz back in June 2017 after a glittering career that spanned more than three decades.\n\nThe star shocked Tinseltown with the announcement, made when he was just 60 years old.\n\n“Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor,” a statement from his reps read at the time. “He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years. This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject.”\n\nHe later admitted he wasn’t sure why he was retiring from acting, stating in November 2017: “I haven’t figured it out. But it’s settled on me, and it’s just there.”\n\n“I did want to draw a line. I didn’t want to get sucked back into another project,” he shared. “All my life, I’ve mouthed off about how I should stop acting, and I don’t know why it was different this time, but the impulse to quit took root in me, and that became a compulsion. It was something I had to do.”\n\nSince that time, the star has shunned the spotlight, having only been pictured in public a handful of times.\n\nThe Post has reached out to Day-Lewis’ agent for information on the star’s current pursuits.\n\nDay-Lewis is the only Hollywood star in history to have won to have won three Best Actor Oscars.\n\nHe nabbed his first Academy Award back in 1989 for his role in “My Left Foot,” before snagging a second statuette for his role in 2007’s “There Will Be Blood.” He went on to win the coveted statuette again five years later for his role in “Lincoln.”\n\nDay-Lewis was last seen on-screen in Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2017 flick “Phantom Thread.”"
