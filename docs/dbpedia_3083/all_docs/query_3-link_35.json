        "text": "ON THE WEST SIDE OF CHICAGO QUITE A number of years ago, there was a boy who loved basketball, who, even to this day, can feel the snowflakes falling on his face on a winter's evening as he shot alone on a schoolyard hoop, under yellow street lamps, in his gloves and coat.\n\nHe loved the feel of the ball, the sense of its going through the netless hoop, and dreamed as he retrieved the wet ball in a snowbank that one day he might drive through whole teams and flip a pass behind his back to a cutting teammate -- in the fashion of Bob Cousy of the Celtics, whom he had seen on television -- or just pull up and drain a jumper from 20 feet out. Swish! Yeah!\n\nAnd while the boy never became a pro -- though he did play high school and college basketball -- the wonder of his innocence is still fresh in his adult mind. Still fresh, too, was the emergence of the disagreeable, but unmistakable, reality of his limitations in that field.\n\nI was reminded of those times when I saw the gritty, powerful new documentary \"Hoop Dreams,\" which closes the New York Film Festival tonight and opens in theaters on Friday. For nearly five years the makers of \"Hoop Dreams\" followed two talented black teen-agers who sought to rise in the basketball world, who sought to climb out of their bleak neighborhood, who dreamed great dreams. They, too, grew up on the West Side of Chicago, within a few miles of each other.\n\nTheir lives and neighborhood were, in many ways, starkly different from mine, since the area had changed dramatically. I was never held up at gunpoint, as was one of the boys in the film, though dark streets always contained their dangers. Drug dealers were unknown to us then and certainly they were not the people of stature in \"Hoop Dreams\" who buy one teen-ager the $70 sneakers he covets so he can keep up with the Joneses or, more exactly, the Thomases -- that is, Isiah Thomas, who also grew up in Chicago, along the Congress Expressway, and rose to stardom as a Detroit Piston.\n\nAnd most of our families then, white or black, were not splintered and without fathers at home, as they are today, as are the families of the two young men in the documentary, William Gates and Arthur Agee. The dreams for many of us seemed within reach, even if only in our minds. As the boys in my Bryant Elementary School graduating class of 1953 wrote when asked about their futures for the school newspaper, they were hoping to be engineers, businessmen, airplane pilots, and, yes, ballplayers.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
