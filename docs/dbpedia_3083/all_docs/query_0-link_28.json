        "text": "Ever since part-time boxer Elmo Lincoln became the screen's first\n\nTarzan, in 1918, the movies have been linked with sports,\n\nreaching the heights of Olympia and the depths of Space Jam. But\n\nwhich are the best? Our process was democratic and unscientific.\n\nWe solicited nominations from our staff, then lateraled them back\n\nand forth in meetings, in e-mails and around the Goobers\n\ndispenser until reaching consensus--which, naturally, provoked\n\nmore debate. Before you scold us for excluding your favorite,\n\nconsider this: There's no accounting for taste. One man's Rudy is\n\nanother's...Rudy.\n\n1\n\nBull Durham\n\nKEVIN COSTNER, SUSAN SARANDON (1988)\n\nThe Baseball Hall of Fame might not want Tim Robbins and Sarandon\n\n(or their liberal politics) on display at Cooperstown, but as\n\nwild-armed pitcher Nuke LaLoosh and a philosophizing Baseball\n\nAnnie named Annie, they are assured of celluloid immortality.\n\nSome of the best-remembered scenes (particularly the\n\ncandlesticks-make-a-nice-gift mound conference) strain credulity,\n\nbut writer-director (and former minor leaguer) Ron Shelton has\n\nsuperb storytelling chops. Best of all, Costner, as crafty\n\ncatcher Crash Davis, is a team player, having not yet maxed out\n\non the self-importance scale.\n\n2\n\nRocky\n\nSYLVESTER STALLONE, CARL WEATHERS (1976)\n\nIn America's bicentennial year Rocky Balboa became the first of\n\nthe post-Vietnam War heroes, a frenzied expression of\n\nold-fashioned individualism. A slow-on-the-uptake palooka who\n\ngets a chance to survive a fight with the heavyweight champ\n\n(Apollo Creed, played with panache by Weathers), Balboa has a\n\nPhiladelphia story with heart and purity and just enough cruelty\n\nfor resonance. Stallone informed his loser with a colossal\n\ngoofiness that was impossible not to watch. He was so\n\nconvincingly sincere that audiences actually jumped up and\n\nscreamed for him to win.\n\n3\n\nRaging Bull\n\nROBERT DE NIRO, CATHY MORIARTY (1980)\n\nA fight film like no other, it charges at you headfirst, the way\n\nits savage protagonist did in the ring. Adapted from Jake La\n\nMotta's candid confessions and filmed in garish black-and-white,\n\nRaging Bull is a sort of anti-Rocky. Director Martin Scorsese\n\npresents La Motta's bouts as masterly edited one-act miniatures\n\nand goes toe-to-toe with fight-film cliches: He neither\n\nromanticizes La Motta nor \"explains\" the anger that drives the\n\nchamp inside and outside the ring. De Niro's unsparing portrait\n\nof this opaque, repellent villain is poignant in its\n\nprecision--even his silences are smoldering.\n\n4\n\nHoop Dreams\n\nDOCUMENTARY (1994)\n\nIt's almost three hours long but director Steve James's saga of\n\nChicago basketball stars William Gates and Arthur Agee is worth\n\nevery minute. An air of dread hangs over this cautionary tale, as\n\nits protagonists confront the inevitable disappointments of hoops\n\nafter high school.\n\n5\n\nSlap Shot\n\nPAUL NEWMAN, MICHAEL ONTKEAN (1977)\n\nNewman's hockey coach, Reggie Dunlop, revives a deadbeat minor\n\nleague team by recruiting the hard-checking, high-sticking Hanson\n\nbrothers. Eyes obscured by taped-up glasses, fists swathed in\n\ntinfoil, these geeky goons revel in dirty play. So does the\n\naudience.\n\n6\n\nHoosiers\n\nGENE HACKMAN, DENNIS HOPPER (1986)\n\nJack Nicholson was first choice to play coach Norman Dale, but he\n\ndeclined. Just as well: It's hard to imagine anyone other than\n\nHackman goading his eight-man Hickory High team. So what if\n\nIndiana hoops history was slightly rewritten for this uplifting\n\nupset?\n\n7\n\nOlympia\n\nDOCUMENTARY (1936)\n\nIntended as Nazi propaganda, Leni Riefenstahl's film is also a\n\nlyrical account of the Berlin Olympics. Critic Pauline Kael\n\ncalled it an elegy on youth, \"dedicated to the highest ideals of\n\nsportsmanship--these young men who were so soon to kill each\n\nother.\"\n\n8\n\nBreaking Away\n\nDENNIS CHRISTOPHER, PAUL DOOLEY (1979)\n\nThis boy-meets-bike classic kickstands the test of time. Dooley\n\nis hilarious as a refundphobic used-car salesman, but this is\n\nabove all a career movie for Christopher, who croons arias and\n\npedals to an exciting finish against snooty college boys in the\n\nLittle 500.\n\n9\n\nChariots of Fire\n\nBEN CROSS, IAN CHARLESON (1981)\n\nIt's amazing that a movie about Caucasian sprinters, some of whom\n\nlook slow even for the 1924 Olympics, won the Academy Award for\n\nbest picture in the go-go '80s. But there's so much heart at the\n\nfinish line that we accept the lack of soul on the blocks.\n\n10\n\nWhen We Were Kings\n\nDOCUMENTARY (1996)\n\nThis long-delayed account of the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle\n\nbetween Muhammad Ali and George Foreman is nearly as enthralling\n\nas the bout. The footage is a heartbreaking record of Ali as a\n\ncultural force. Norman Mailer and George Plimpton provide sharp\n\ncommentary.\n\n11\n\nBang the Drum Slowly\n\nMICHAEL MORIARTY, ROBERT DE NIRO (1973)\n\nNobody looks much like a ballplayer, least of all pitcher\n\nMoriarty and doomed, tobacco-chewing catcher De Niro. But Drum\n\nmovingly hugs the foul line between myth and reality. And there's\n\nnot a dry eye in the stadium as De Niro stumbles around under\n\nthat final pop foul.\n\n12\n\nDogtown and Z-Boys\n\nDOCUMENTARY (2002)\n\nA hard-core look at how surfing values and style morphed into\n\nextreme skateboarding for a ragtag gang of Southern California\n\nbeach kids, this movie is also a wonderful evocation of time (the\n\n'70s) and place (Dogtown, a shoddy area of Santa Monica). Groove\n\non the old school rock.\n\n13\n\nA League of Their Own\n\nTOM HANKS, GEENA DAVIS (1992)\n\nThere may be no crying in baseball--but the game once had\n\nfemales, as recounted in this lightly fictionalized and\n\nspiritedly feminist account of the World War II-era women's pro\n\nleague. Hanks as a fall-down-drunk skipper and Davis as a\n\nloose-limbed catcher provide the pathos.\n\n14\n\nThe Freshman\n\nHAROLD LLOYD, JOBYNA RALSTON (1925)\n\nThe most plundered sports film ever made, this sidesplitting\n\nsilent stars Lloyd as a callow youth who becomes the\n\nlaughingstock of his college. He tries out for the football team,\n\nfails and serves as water boy until the final crazed seconds of\n\nthe Big Game.\n\n15\n\nThe Endless Summer\n\nDOCUMENTARY (1966)\n\nWriter-director-narrator Bruce Brown followed surfers Mike Hynson\n\nand Robert August around the world in search of the perfect wave.\n\nThe story line is small, but sweet. In this classic you can see\n\nthe DNA of every surf movie that came after.\n\n16\n\nNorth Dallas Forty\n\nNICK NOLTE, MAC DAVIS (1979)\n\nWith somewhat less splash NDF demystifies the Dallas Cowboys the\n\nway Ball Four did the New York Yankees. The action is vivid and\n\nviolent, the dialogue remains fresh, and pot-smoking,\n\npill-popping, glue-fingered wide receiver Nolte is an All-Pro\n\nantihero.\n\n17\n\nBrian's Song\n\nJAMES CAAN, BILLY DEE WILLIAMS (1971)\n\nA grown-men-do-cry classic. Caan and Williams are a dream\n\nbackfield as Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers, of course, but the TV\n\nmovie gets two extra points for casting Jack Warden (as crusty\n\nGeorge Halas) and Shelley Fabares (as Piccolo's plucky wife,\n\nJoy).\n\n18\n\nCaddyshack\n\nRODNEY DANGERFIELD, BILL MURRAY (1980)\n\nAs long as men gather to drink beer and break wind, director\n\nHarold Ramis's masterwork will be deconstructed frame by frame,\n\nincluding the memorable bit in which Murray provides his own\n\nplay-by-play as he uses a hoe to make a shot out of a flower bed.\n\n19\n\nDownhill Racer\n\nROBERT REDFORD, GENE HACKMAN (1969)\n\nThe then cutting-edge, skier's-eye camera work gave a visual rush\n\nto this tale of a U.S. Olympic ski coach (Hackman) who tries to\n\ntame a talented but wayward medal hopeful (Redford). What ever\n\nhappened to Redford's dynamic love interest, Camilla Sparv?\n\n20\n\nRequiem for a Heavyweight\n\nANTHONY QUINN, JACKIE GLEASON (1962)\n\nThis melancholy mood piece features Quinn as a tender, mumbling\n\ngiant who plods down lonely streets as if the ground were\n\ntapioca. Highlights include Mickey Rooney's wary, sympathetic\n\ncutman and the shadowy, darkly glamorous cinematography.\n\n21\n\nPumping Iron\n\nDOCUMENTARY (1977)\n\nAdulatory, voyeuristic and engaging, this irony-pumped work\n\ndissects the grotesque subculture of men's bodybuilding. The film\n\nfocuses on Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose main rival, Lou Ferrigno,\n\nis incredibly bulky but not yet Incredibly Hulky.\n\n22\n\nThe Set-Up\n\nROBERT RYAN, GEORGE TOBIAS (1949)\n\nIn the most brutal indictment of boxing ever filmed, Ryan is\n\nunforgettable as the shabby, shambling tomato can who still\n\nbelieves he can be a contender. Based on a prose poem and shot in\n\nreal time, it still packs the power of a Joe Louis uppercut.\n\n23\n\nThe Hustler\n\nPAUL NEWMAN, JACKIE GLEASON (1961)\n\nThis Hemingwayesque tale of circling pool sharks is crammed with\n\natmosphere and incisive acting. As the disenchanted drifter who\n\ntests what's inside himself, Newman is upstaged by George C.\n\nScott as the wicked manager who rejects him as a born loser.\n\n24\n\nSearching for Bobby Fischer\n\nMAX POMERANC, BEN KINGSLEY (1993)\n\nA budding grandmaster learns that the force is with him in a\n\nchessboard version of Star Wars. Battling for his mind and game\n\nare a street hustler (Laurence Fishburne) preaching tactics and\n\nattitude, and a somber scholar (Kingsley) demanding discipline.\n\n25\n\nHorse Feathers\n\nTHE MARX BROTHERS (1932)\n\nThis college-football caper has Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Zeppo,\n\npasswords, stolen playbooks and madcap dialogue that generations\n\nhave heard once and recalled forever: \"Baravelli, you've got the\n\nbrain of a four-year-old boy, and I bet he was glad to get rid of\n\nit.\"\n\n26\n\nThe Bad News Bears\n\nWALTER MATTHAU, TATUM O'NEAL (1976)\n\nBibulous manager Matthau bitches, precocious O'Neal pitches, and\n\na hilariously foulmouthed gang of Little Leaguers scores big\n\nlaughs. Having seen the two sequels and the formula copied by the\n\nMighty Ducks movies, dare we label Bears seminal?\n\n27\n\nNational Velvet\n\nELIZABETH TAYLOR, MICKEY ROONEY (1944)\n\nThis lively and immensely likable film involves an English\n\nbutcher's daughter (rapturously played by 12-year-old Taylor) who\n\npractically wills her sorrel gelding to win the Grand National.\n\nThe climactic race was filmed on a Pasadena golf course.\n\n28\n\nEight Men Out\n\nJOHN CUSACK, DAVID STRATHAIRN (1988)\n\nAuteur John Sayles tackles the 1919 Black Sox scandal, telling\n\nthe complex story completely. He gets brilliant, understated\n\nperformances out of Strathairn (as game-fixing pitcher Eddie\n\nCicotte) and Cusack (as apparently innocent third baseman Buck\n\nWeaver).\n\n29\n\nRollerball\n\nJAMES CAAN, JOHN HOUSEMAN (1975)\n\nIn 2018 a corporate world-state channels the bloodlust of society\n\nthrough a sport that weds hockey, football and Roller Derby.\n\nRuling execs try to off the champ (Caan) by making the game a\n\nfight to the death. A defiant Caan keeps the allegory from\n\nseeming too high-handed.\n\n30\n\nThe Rookie\n\nDENNIS QUAID, RACHEL GRIFFITHS (2002)\n\nAn earnest quaid has the right stuff in this true story about Jim\n\nMorris, a failed minor league pitcher turned high school\n\nteacher-coach who gets another shot at the Show. Quaid's mound\n\nscenes pop the glove, and Griffiths supplies a mood changeup as\n\nhis encouraging wife.\n\n31\n\nBaseball--A Film by Ken Burns\n\nDOCUMENTARY (1994)\n\nVividly employing his patented and burnished technique (archival\n\nfilm, still photos and talking heads), Burns furnishes, in 18 1/2\n\nenthralling hours, an unparalleled history of our national\n\npastime. Baseball's MVP? The ageless, twinkling former Negro\n\nleaguer Buck O'Neil.\n\n32\n\nVision Quest\n\nMATTHEW MODINE, LINDA FIORENTINO (1985)\n\nWe can believe that A high school wrestler, even one as lanky as\n\nModine, could cut enough weight to take on a foe two classes\n\nlower. But having an older woman who looks like Fiorentino move\n\nin with you because her car broke down? Well, movies are all\n\nabout dreams coming true.\n\n33\n\nFat City\n\nSTACY KEACH, JEFF BRIDGES (1972)\n\nGritty doesn't begin TO describe this absorbing but overlooked\n\ntale, directed by John Huston, of two boxers, one (Bridges) on\n\nthe way up, the other (Keach) on the way down. Look for Cheers's\n\nbeloved Coach, Nicholas Colasanto, as trainer Ruben. He's gritty\n\ntoo.\n\n34\n\nEverybody's All-American\n\nDENNIS QUAID, JESSICA LANGE (1988)\n\nQuaid and Lange display great legs as a Big Couple on Campus in\n\nthe evocative cinematic version of Frank Deford's novel about a\n\nSouthern gridiron hero. John Goodman, as Quaid's boisterous\n\nbuddy, and Carl Lumbly, as foil Narvel Blue, add heft and heart.\n\n35\n\nMillion Dollar Legs\n\nW.C. FIELDS, JACK OAKIE (1932)\n\nThis screwiest of screwball comedies has Fields as president of\n\nKlopstokia, where every woman is named Angela, every man is named\n\nGeorge and every citizen is an Olympic-caliber athlete. They all\n\ncome to Los Angeles for the '32 Games. Mayhem ensues.\n\n36\n\nJerry Maguire\n\nTOM CRUISE, CUBA GOODING JR. (1996)\n\nIn making the emotional leap from stonyhearted to softhearted, a\n\nsensitive Cruise almost gives sports agents a good name. Renee\n\nZellweger, as his love interest, is winning, and Gooding's \"Show\n\nme the money\" rap never stops being funny.\n\n37\n\nThe Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick\n\nARTHUR BRAUSS, ERIKA PLUHAR (1971)\n\nA German goalkeeper, sent to the bench after surrendering a goal,\n\nwanders through Vienna and commits a random murder. Directed by\n\nWim Wenders, this stark, beautiful, morally ambivalent film uses\n\nsoccer as a metaphor for existential dread.\n\n38\n\nField of Dreams\n\nKEVIN COSTNER, JAMES EARL JONES (1989)\n\nCornball, yes, but also a cornfield classic that touches the\n\nbases of nostalgia, baseball history and the bond between fathers\n\nand sons. Costner excels as ball field builder Ray Kinsella. And\n\nBurt Lancaster is unforgettable as old-timer Moonlight Graham.\n\n39\n\nThe Harder They Fall\n\nHUMPHREY BOGART, ROD STEIGER (1956)\n\nIn his final film Bogart plays a down-and-out sports columnist\n\nwho teams with a sleazy boxing promoter (Steiger) to\n\nhype--through a series of fixed fights--a clumsy giant with a\n\nglass jaw. The verbal sparring between heavyweights Bogart and\n\nSteiger goes 12 riveting rounds.\n\n40\n\nThe Longest Yard\n\nBURT REYNOLDS, EDDIE ALBERT (1974)\n\nReynolds is a forceful presence playing a convict and\n\nex-quarterback now calling signals for his prison squad. Former\n\nGreen Bay Packer Ray Nitschke is among Reynolds's formidable\n\nfoes, as is Albert, the sinister warden. (Is there ever any other\n\nkind in the movies?)\n\n41\n\nRemember the Titans\n\nDENZEL WASHINGTON, WILL PATTON (2000)\n\nNo cliche is overlooked in this fact-based Disney movie detailing\n\nthe integration of a Virginia high school and its football team\n\nin 1971. But Washington (as the black coach put in charge) and\n\nPatton (as the white coach who has to swallow his pride) are\n\nterrific.\n\n42\n\nThe Pride of the Yankees\n\nGARY COOPER, TERESA WRIGHT (1942)\n\nCooper achieves a quiet nobility and grace in this sentimental\n\nbiography of Lou Gehrig. To mimic the lefthanded Iron Horse,\n\nCooper--a righthander--wore a uniform with the number reversed\n\nand ran to third base instead of first. When processed, the film\n\nwas flipped.\n\n43\n\nFists of Fury\n\nBRUCE LEE, MARIA YI (1971)\n\nTypecast on American TV, San Francisco-born Lee returned to Hong\n\nKong, where he had been a child star. The best of the \"chop\n\nsockies,\" in which the small, corkscrewy martial arts master\n\ntakes on all comers, Fists sparked a worldwide craze for kung fu\n\nflicks.\n\n44\n\nThe Deadliest Season\n\nMICHAEL MORIARTY, KEVIN CONWAY (1977)\n\nThis made-for-TV hockey movie details the fate of a defenseman\n\n(Moriarty) who becomes goonish in an attempt to extend his\n\ncareer. He kills a foe on the ice and is tried for manslaughter,\n\nturning Season into a gripping courtroom drama. Conway is\n\ncompelling as the defense lawyer.\n\n45\n\nGrand Prix\n\nJAMES GARNER, EVA MARIE SAINT (1966)\n\nThis pioneering Formula One movie uses split screens and\n\n70-millimeter cameras strapped to vehicles (which were jacked up\n\non the other side for balance) to convey the sensations of a\n\nrace. The driven characters take a backseat to the high-octane\n\ncrashes.\n\n46\n\nAny Given Sunday\n\nAL PACINO, CAMERON DIAZ (1999)\n\nDirector Oliver Stone created the first football film for the\n\nmusic-video age, a movie full of quick, jarring cuts and\n\nslam-bang action. Pacino is credibly harried as a dictatorial pro\n\ncoach clashing with his controlling owner (Diaz) and his\n\nrebellious young quarterback (Jamie Foxx).\n\n47\n\nIt Happens Every Spring\n\nRAY MILLAND, JEAN PETERS (1949)\n\nA lighthearted romp about a chemistry professor (Milland) who\n\naccidentally invents a compound that repels wood. To test it from\n\nthe mound, he tries out for the big leagues, makes a team and\n\nproves unhittable. This gem anticipates steroids and corked bats.\n\n48\n\nThe Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings\n\nBILLY DEE WILLIAMS, RICHARD PRYOR (1976)\n\nIt's 1939, eight years before Jackie Robinson will cross major\n\nleague baseball's color line, and a rowdy African-American team\n\nis barnstorming the country. The script is sneakily subversive:\n\nFor a black man to succeed in a white world, he must clown and\n\ncakewalk.\n\n49\n\nPhar Lap\n\nTOM BURLINSON, RON LIEBMAN (1983)\n\nThis beautifully filmed Australian period piece is a loving\n\nbiography of the thoroughbred that captivated the land Down Under\n\nin the 1920s and '30s. The movie touchingly depicts the\n\nrelationship between Phar Lap and the groom (Burlinson) who cares\n\nfor him.\n\n50\n\nBest in Show\n\nCHRISTOPHER GUEST, EUGENE LEVY (2000)\n\nGuest's wildly hilarious \"mockumentary\" revolves around show dog\n\nowners--a fly-fisherman and his mopey bloodhound; neurotic\n\nyuppies with their depressed weimaraner. Fred Willard steals the\n\nfinal dog show as a Joe Garagiola-like commentator.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: PHOTO ILLUSTRATIONS BY RICHIE FAHEY/PHOTOFEST (15)\n\nTWENTY-SEVEN COLOR PHOTOS: PHOTOFEST\n\nTWENTY-THREE B/W PHOTOS: PHOTOFEST\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PARAMOUNT (NAKED GUN)\n\nB/W PHOTO: NATIONAL BASEBALL LIBRARY (BASEBALL--A FILM BY KEN BURNS)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: GRAY CITY/AUTOREN, OSTERREICHISCHEN (GOALIE'S ANXIETY)\n\nPOWER LINES\n\n\"Be the ball, Danny.\"--Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), Caddyshack\n\n(1980)....\n\n\"I believe that God made me for a purpose, but he also made me\n\nfast.

Hence John\n\nTravolta's futile attempts, in a series of scenes, to make the\n\nRydell High basketball, wrestling, baseball and track teams (he\n\ntrips over a hurdle), all to win the heart of Olivia Newton-John.\n\nThe Super Bowl scene in Black Sunday (1977)\n\nBefore he gave us Hannibal Lecter, Thomas Harris wrote a novel\n\nabout a disgruntled Vietnam vet, played on screen by Bruce Dern,\n\nwho plans to blow up a blimp filled with steel darts at the Super\n\nBowl. The suspenseful climax included footage filmed at Super\n\nBowl X in Miami.\n\nThe Giants game in When Harry Met Sally (1989)\n\nBilly Crystal shows just how programmed to cheer we can become by\n\nmindlessly taking part in a wave at a football game as he\n\nrecounts to Bruno Kirby the dissolution of his marriage.\n\nThe basketball dream scene in Fletch (1985)\n\nChevy Chase imagines himself as a Lakers star--receiving a pass\n\nfrom Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and scoring on a reverse layup--all to\n\nthe play-by-play of Chick Hearn. (\"Fletch: He truly defines grace\n\nunder pressure.\")\n\nThe golf scene in Swingers (1996)\n\nIn one of the best male-bonding scenes in a movie full of them,\n\nJon Favreau and Ron Livingston commiserate about Favreau's love\n\nlife and Livingston's stalled acting career while counting up\n\nstrokes at a par-3 hole (Favreau takes an eight...or a nine). A\n\nclose second from the same film: Vince Vaughn makes the Wayne\n\nGretzky figure's head bleed on a video game, sparking a wrestling\n\nmatch with Patrick Van Horn.\n\nThe tennis match in Strangers on a Train (1951)\n\nThis thriller about a tennis player (Farley Granger) lured into a\n\nmurderous scheme by the deranged Robert Walker features one of\n\ndirector Alfred Hitchcock's eeriest scenes: As Granger sits\n\ncourtside watching a practice match, every head in the crowd\n\nswivels to follow the action--except Walker's, which stays\n\nfocused on Granger.\n\nThe surfing scene in Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nConsidering the milieu--beach combat in Vietnam--Robert Duvall's\n\nLieutenant Colonel Kilgore is arguably the most dedicated\n\nsportsman ever to grace the silver screen. Charlie might not\n\nsurf, but Kilgore's men do, enemy fire be damned. (\"If I say it's\n\nsafe to surf this beach, Captain, it's safe to surf this beach.\")\n\nThe Baltimore Colts quiz in Diner (1982)\n\nHow important are sports to guys? Ask the never-seen Elyse, whose\n\nfiance, Eddie (Steve Guttenberg), won't marry her unless she\n\npasses a quiz on his favorite football team. Elyse fails--but the\n\nnuptials are on when Eddie allows that she probably would have\n\ncorrectly answered the \"Alan Ameche question,\" had not pal\n\nShrevie (Daniel Stern) blurted out the answer first.\n\nRON SHELTON'S ALL-STARS\n\nThe creator of Bull Durham and many other sports movies is\n\nbullish on these actors as athletes\n\n\"Almost every actor thinks he's an athlete,\" says Ron Shelton,\n\n\"and almost none of them are.\" Shelton should know, being a\n\ncreative force (director or writer or sometimes both) on such\n\nfilms as Bull Durham, Tin Cup, White Men Can't Jump, Blue Chips,\n\nCobb, Play It to the Bone, The Best of Times and The Great White\n\nHype. When an actor comes to his office to audition for a sports\n\nmovie, Shelton, who played second base for five years in the\n\nBaltimore Orioles' organization, immediately tosses him the\n\nbaseball that always sits on his desk. \"You see right away how he\n\nhandles it, catches it, how he feels with it,\" says Shelton, \"and\n\nusually you're disappointed.\" Here are the actors who, in\n\nShelton's opinion, have the physical ability to consistently and\n\nconvincingly combine athletic and artistic prowess.\n\n1 Kevin Costner (Bull Durham [below], Tin Cup, For Love of the\n\nGame, American Flyers): \"It's remarkable how good Kevin is.\n\nSmooth and fluid, utterly believable in whatever he does.\"\n\n2 Kurt Russell (The Best of Times): \"He was a minor league\n\nballplayer, and it shows. He could pull off any athletic role.\"\n\n3 Robert Redford (Downhill Racer, The Natural): \"Obviously, he's\n\ngetting older, but he was a high school ballplayer, and he's\n\nlooked good in the athletic parts he's had.\"\n\n4 Wesley Snipes (White Men Can't Jump, Major League, Undisputed)\n\nand Woody Harrelson (White Men Can't Jump, Wildcats): \"Wes isn't\n\nmuch of a basketball player, but he's great at everything you\n\ncan't teach--jumping, running, quickness. Woody is basically a\n\nslow white guy, but he really knows how to play.\"\n\n5 Nick Nolte (North Dallas Forty): \"He played high school football,\n\nand that showed in North Dallas. He really captured the feel of\n\nthat kind of player.\"\n\nSWEAT FLOPS: THE 10 WORST\n\nYou know how some movies are so bad they're good? These just\n\nstink\n\n1 Space Jam (1996) Lazy and spiritless, this cynical\n\nmerchandising exercise strips Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck of their\n\nanarchic energy and peddles Michael Jordan (right) for\n\ncanonization.\n\n2 The Other Side of the Mountain (1975) Insufferably fulsome,\n\ntrue-life tale of Olympic skiing hopeful Jill Kinmont, who is\n\nparalyzed by a fall and tortured by Olivia Newton-John's cloying\n\ntitle song.\n\n3 Rocky IV (1985) In a performance unmarred by subtlety of any\n\nkind Sylvester Stallone's aggressive bodybuilder is so\n\nself-inflated he could be a float in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day\n\nparade.\n\n4 The Program (1993) Long bomb of a film about a college football\n\nteam in which a moronic quarterback lies faceup on a highway like\n\na human speed bump. Moronic moviegoers aped him.\n\n5 Days of Thunder (1990) NASCAR blockbuster that's all Formula One\n\ncliche. Deafening soundtrack obscures lack of plot, suspense or\n\nchemistry between hotshot Tom Cruise and brain surgeon (Nicole\n\nKidman), who massages his ego.\n\n6 The Replacements (2000) Antiunion greed-and-gridiron screed\n\nabout mewling NFL players and their sad-sack fill-ins that's\n\nabout as watchable as replacement-player football.\n\n7 Players (1979) Pulpy, soapy, helplessly camp romance between\n\nWimbledon finalist Dean Paul Martin and rich bitch Ali MacGraw,\n\nwho expresses emotion by contorting her nostrils.\n\n8 Caddyshack II (1988) Even fans of the original's dumb\n\nmonkey-house humor will find this punishingly unfunny. The\n\nembarrassing Dan Aykroyd signals to the audience that he's\n\nsmarter than the movie. But he's in it; he's not.\n\n9 The Kid from Left Field (1979) The set-up to the one-joke plot:\n\nrosin-bag-sized Gary Coleman manages the San Diego Padres. We're\n\nstill waiting for the punch line."
