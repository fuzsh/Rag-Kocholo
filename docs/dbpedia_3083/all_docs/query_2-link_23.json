        "text": "Buster is seen through a camera’s viewfinder in the gymnasium while holding a banana like a microphone. Behind him, Brain practices with a basketball.\n\nBuster: Buster Baxter here, reporting for Lakewood Elementary Sports News. In ten days, Alan \"Brain\" Powers is going to face Mighty Mountain's Sam \"Slam Dunk\" Scarborough in the Elwood City baskets for charity competition. Francine, what do you think of his chances?\n\nFrancine: A banana? That's the best you could do for a microphone?\n\nBuster: Hey, times are tough. Plus, this is a hundred percent compostable. So, is Brain going to win?\n\nThe camera focuses on Brain.\n\nFrancine: Slam Dunk definitely has a height advantage, but Brain's a real competitor. Not only does he have terrific aim, but he's cool under pressure. This player just never buckles, even if everything depended on this one shot, the very fate of the world, life as we know it...\n\nBrain: Do you mind?\n\nBrain makes a shot. Buster is now eating the banana.\n\nFrancine: See. What did I tell you? What happened to your microphone?\n\nBuster: Erm, technical difficulties. That's a wrap.\n\nArthur, who has been filming, puts down the camera.\n\nArthur: Hey, Brain, want to come to the Sugar Bowl with us?\n\nBrain: No, thanks. Our library could really use that money. I better practice some more.\n\nArthur and Buster leave, while Brain continues practicing. Buster throws the banana peel at the trashcan, but it falls on the basketball court.\n\nBrain: Okay. This shot is for a brand new computer in the reading room.\n\nHe steps backward.\n\nArthur and Buster walk down a school corridor outside the gym.\n\nArthur: With Brain shooting baskets for us, we're almost guaranteed to win.\n\nBuster: Yep. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nA thump is heard from the gym.\n\nBrain: Ow!\n\nArthur: I think we're about to find out.\n\nThey run back to the gym.\n\nTitle Card: Slot Machine: Brain[]\n\nThe outside of the hospital is shown. Brain lies on an examination table while his mom stands beside him. The doctor shows an X-Ray of Brain’s foot.\n\nDr. Hirsch: Well, the good news is nothing's broken. The bad news is that one leg has a sprained ankle.\n\nBrain: If it's a grade one lateral ligamentis injury, I could be back on my feet in a few days.\n\nDr. Hirsch: I'm sorry, Alan, but it's a grade two sprain, and you have a torn knee ligament in your other leg. You're going to need an air cast for your ankle, a knee immobilizer, and some physical therapy. But, for the next week, you do get this nifty set of wheels.\n\nA nurse brings in a wheelchair.\n\nBrain: (sighs)\n\n***\n\nIn the hospital’s physical therapy room, Coach Raggett massages Brain’s foot while Buster watches.\n\nBuster: I'm really, really sorry. I thought for sure the peel went in the can.\n\nBrain: It's okay, Buster. I know it was an accident. I'm just upset that I won't be able to play in the basketball fundraiser.\n\nA girl in another wheelchair looks interested.\n\nBuster: Yeah, we don't stand a chance against Mighty Mountain now.\n\nBrain: What are they raising money for?\n\nBuster: Save the Elwood City squirrels. Oh, what a waste. Well, see you later, Brain. He leaves. On his way out he sees a squirrel outside the window. Argh! Sorry!\n\nThe girl in the wheelchair rolls up to Brain.\n\nLydia Fox: So, you play basketball?\n\nBrain: Huh? Yeah. I was actually supposed to be in a competition, but that's not going to happen.\n\nHe pats his wheelchair.\n\nLydia: Why, ‘cause you're not on two legs? Tell that to my basketball team.\n\nBrain: You're on a basketball team?\n\nLydia takes out a basketball and spins it on her finger.\n\nLydia: Yup, the Wheel Warriors. The best wheelchair basketball team in Elwood City. We're 11 and 0 this season. Want to shoot some hoops with me?\n\nShe passes to Brain who misses the catch.\n\nBrain: Maybe some other time.\n\nLydia: Sure.\n\nShe rolls away. Brain tries to move, but bumps into a rack with dumbbells. One of them falls down.\n\nBrain: Oops.\n\nHe rolls backwards and bumps into Coach Raggett, who is now helping a boy from the Elwood City All-Stars.\n\nCoach Raggett: Ow!\n\nBrain: Sorry.\n\nLydia: (giggles)\n\nShe comes back to Brain.\n\nBrain: I'm still getting used to this thing.\n\nLydia: I'll draw you a schematic. She sketches on a notepad. It's two rotational points on a single axis, so you have to push one wheel forward while pushing the other back, and then you can turn.\n\nBrain: Your understanding of physics is impressive.\n\nLydia: I was born without the use of my legs, not my brain.\n\nShe rolls off, he follows.\n\nBrain: Um, actually, I'd love to hoot some shoops. I mean...\n\nLydia: (giggles) I know what you mean. I'm Lydia.\n\nThey shake hands.\n\nBrain: Alan, but my friends call me Brain.\n\nLydia: Okay, Brain. Join me tomorrow for a friendly game of horse.\n\n***\n\nThe next day, Lydia and Brain meet on the basketball court behind Lakewood Elementary.\n\nLydia: Every time you miss a shot, you get a letter. First player to spell \"horse\" loses.\n\nShe passes to Brain, who dribbles while Lydia draws on her notepad.\n\nBrain: I should warn you, I'm pretty good.\n\nLydia: Great! Maybe I'll be able to learn some pointers. Brain misses. H.\n\nBrain: My arms must be a little tired.\n\nLydia scores. Brain misses again.\n\nLydia: O. Lydia picks up the rebound and scores with a hook shot. Brain misses. R. Would you like to play using the full Latin name for horse, Equus ferus caballus? It would give you more chances.\n\nShe scores again.\n\nBrain: I don't get it. That's the worst I've ever thrown!\n\nLydia: Don't worry about it. You're just not used to shooting from this different height and angle, and not being able to use your whole body.\n\nBrain: Something tells me that we'd be here for hours before you ever got an H.\n\nLydia: Hey, this basketball competition you were supposed to be in, was it a game?\n\nBrain: No, just free throws. The winner of the tournament gets a big donation to the charity of their choice.\n\nLydia: So, you can still be in it.\n\nBrain: But you saw the way I was shooting. I'm awful now!\n\nLydia: I wouldn't say awful. Inept, maybe. Possibly clumsy, uncoordinated, graceless...\n\nBrain: All right already!\n\nLydia: But you do have a secret weapon.\n\nBrain: I do?\n\nLydia: Yep, a great tutor. Here. I call it Lydia's Basket Case.\n\nShe hands him a page from her notepad with a drawing of Brain throwing a ball.\n\nBrain: My head is not that big.\n\nLydia: We start tomorrow after school, and bring your A game.\n\n***\n\nBrain and Lydia meet on the court the next morning. Brain misses.\n\nBrain: Hrrr!\n\nLydia: Increase your release height. Remember, you're two feet lower than you normally are. Again!\n\n***\n\nBrain lifts a dumbbell in the hospital.\n\nLydia: 18, 19... More arm strength means more baskets. Come on, Brain! Think of the library! Do it for Virgil! Do it for Proust! That's it!\n\n***\n\nThey are on the court again. Brain misses.\n\nLydia: Better on the velocity, but aim lower. One hundred and sixty-eight centimeters is your sweet spot. Again!\n\nLydia writes a mathematical formula on Brain’s cast.\n\nLydia: See, the ball's velocity when it leaves your hands is the result of...\n\nBrain: Three different velocity vector components! It all makes perfect sense now.\n\nLydia: You sure you don't want me to write this on a piece of paper?\n\nBrain: No. This way I won't lose it. Just don't press so hard next time. It tickles!\n\nLydia: In that case...\n\nShe doodles on his cast.\n\nBrain: (laughs) Stop!\n\nLydia: Quit squirming! You're ruining the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n***\n\nBrain shoots and misses.\n\nBrain: Argh! What's wrong with me?\n\nLydia: Nothing. That was really good. Your speed and angle were perfect. You just missed, that's all. Now...\n\nBrain: I know. Again.\n\nLydia: Actually, I was going to ask if you want to get something to eat. I'm starving!\n\nBrain: I know the perfect place.\n\n***\n\nBrain and Lydia roll down the street towards the ice-cream shop.\n\nBrain: All our ice-cream is made from milk from a local dairy farm, and we handpick a lot of the ingred... Huh? They come to a fairly high curb. I never noticed that before. That's a pretty big drop.\n\nLydia: Oh, yeah. The corner of Elm and Maple? It's pretty infamous with me and my team-mates.\n\nBrain: Excuse me, could you... Two men walk by and ignore them. Hey, we could use a... What's with these people? Can't they see we need help?\n\nLydia: I know, but they might be busy. Anyway, you've got to know who and how to ask. Nearby, a kindly looking lady is selecting flowers from a flower shop. She doesn't look like she's in a rush. Excuse me, ma'am. Would you mind helping my friend and me down the curb? I'll show you exactly what to do.\n\nLady: Certainly, dear.\n\nThe lady helps Lydia and Brain across the street.\n\nLydia: Thanks a lot.\n\nBrain: Thank you, ma'am.\n\n***\n\nBrain and Lydia reach the ice-cream shop.\n\nBrain: Here it is. My mom's ice-cream shop. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.\n\nLydia tries to go through the door, but it is too narrow.\n\nLydia: Uh-oh. The doorway's too narrow for me. Well, it looks terrific.\n\n***\n\nFrancine walks into the Sugar Bowl. Brain and Lydia are sitting inside.\n\nBrain: I'm really sorry about that. I never knew our shop wasn't wheelchair accessible.\n\nLydia: Lots of places aren't.\n\nFrancine: Brain, I've been looking all over for... Hey, you're Lydia. I saw you play with the Wheel Warriors. You were amazing.\n\nLydia: Thanks. I'd give you an autograph, but my hands are ketchupy.\n\nFrancine: Listen, if you're not feeling up to the competition, I can take over. I mean, I know I'm not as good at shooting as you, but...\n\nLydia: Don't worry about a thing. He's going to cream Mighty Mountain. I'm his coach.\n\nFrancine: Oh, great! Well, see you tomorrow.\n\nShe leaves.\n\nBrain: Tomorrow?? I forgot that it's tomorrow. I haven't looked at my calendar in days. All I've been doing is playing basketball.\n\nLydia: And that's all you should have been doing. Here. Trash can. She throws her crumpled napkin into the can. Three points. Brain throws his napkin and hits the can as well. See? Much you have learned, oh big-headed one.\n\n***\n\nThat night, Brain sleeps in his bed. In his dream he is in the gymnasium. He throws the ball much too short.\n\nAudience: (boos, hisses)\n\nBrain: What?!\n\nA giant player takes the ball and throws hoop after hoop.\n\nAudience: (cheer)\n\nThe referee whistles and brings the player a cart full of money. The player jumps up and down making the ground shake.\n\nPlayer: The squirrels will be so happy.\n\nArthur and Buster stand on the street opposite the library.\n\nArthur: Oh, if only Brain had been able to raise that money.\n\nBuster: Yeah, the reading room's computer became so outdated, they just had to tear the whole library down.\n\nThey put on earmuffs. A wrecking ball starts demolishing the library.\n\nThe dream ends.\n\nBrain: Huh?!\n\n***\n\nArthur films Buster, who is reporting in the gymnasium. This time, he has an ice-cream cone as a microphone.\n\nBuster: It's neck and neck. Brain and Slam Dunk both have twenty-two baskets.\n\nLakewood Students: Yeah!\n\nBuster: Wait! Make that twenty-three for Brain. Francine, comments?\n\nFrancine: I think your microphone is melting.\n\nBuster licks it.\n\nBrain throws the ball and misses. A buzzer sounds and Brain joins Lydia on the sideline as Sam, a normal-sized Mighty Mountain player, walks onto the court.\n\nLydia: You're doing great. Just stay focused and keep your rhythm up.\n\nSam scores several times. When the buzzer sounds again, the score is 23 to 27.\n\nBrain: Oh, no! We're still four points behind.\n\nSam hands Brain the ball.\n\nSam: Beat that! Ha!\n\nBrain: I have to make five baskets in one minute! I can't do it.\n\nLydia: But I can.\n\nShe takes Brain’s library button and the ball.\n\nShe throws several hoops while the Lakewood students watch. The final score is 28 to 27.\n\nLakewood Students: (cheer) They crowd around Lydia. Lydia! Lydia! Lydia!\n\n***\n\nA few days later, Mrs. Powers holds the door of the ice-cream shop open for Lydia to roll out. Brain waits outside with crutches.\n\nLydia: I like the new door. Plenty of room now.\n\nBrain: Well, it was the least we could do for the girl who won all that money for our library.\n\nThey walk down the street.\n\nLydia: What are you talking about? It was all you. I just helped at the end. Anyway, basketball actually isn't my strong suit. It's chess.\n\nBrain: No way!\n\nLydia: Seriously. I'm nationally ranked. Want to play?\n\nBrain: Well, okay, but I should want you, I'm very good."
