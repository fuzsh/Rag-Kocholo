        "text": "Since Janis Joplin died, in the fall of 1970, her younger siblings, Laura and Michael Joplin, have jointly watched over her estate. “I was twenty-one when she died, and Michael was four years younger than that,” Laura said recently. “We didn’t know anything about the music business.” Their responsibilities include looking over royalty statements (Joplin is big in Argentina and Brazil) and condoning such projects as “A Night with Janis Joplin,” a bio-concert that has just opened on Broadway, starring Mary Bridget Davies, who sings the bejesus out of “Cry Baby” and “Piece of My Heart” and has the unkempt hair to match.\n\nOne night before a preview, the Joplins crammed into a dressing room at the Lyceum, as cast members sang scales in the hallway. Michael Joplin, who wore socks embroidered with musical staffs, is a glassblower living in Tucson. Laura Joplin, who wore gold hoop earrings and gold bracelets, is a former education consultant and organizes TEDx talks in her town of Chico, California. Both are in their sixties, with excellent recall of their years in Port Arthur, Texas.\n\n“Janis was a painter, and I was always in awe of how well she was doing it,” Michael said. When he was around ten, “she gave me some key sentences that made me able to see 3-D to 2-D. What she said was, ‘Well, just look at it flat.’ I understood immediately what she meant.” He clapped his hands together and made a thwap sound.\n\n“She read me bedtime stories, took me around the neighborhood as a toddler,” Laura said. “But the things I remember the most are when she was at home the year before she joined Big Brother. She was going to college, and we shared a VW Bug together. We shared clothes, because we were the same size. And we got into putting our hair up together and wearing jewelry. It was just fun. Intimate, in a girly way.”\n\nLike most younger siblings, the Joplins lived vicariously through their big sister. “She would send underground papers from San Francisco, and I was eating it up,” Michael recalled. “I can’t remember what magazine it was, but I took it to school. I think it’s that Family Dog photo with all the bands, and there are all these weird people with long hair.”\n\n“We went out there as a family in ’67 to visit,” Laura said. “Our parents wanted to see how she was.”\n\nMichael laughed. “We took our parents to the Summer of Love!”\n\n“I had just graduated from high school, and I had never been anywhere, other than maybe Houston once or twice,” Laura said. “We were so provincial that I was blown away by having breakfast—a sweet roll and a cup of tea—at Woolworth’s lunch counter.”\n\n“I just remember driving with the parents through the Haight-Ashbury area looking at hippies,” Michael said. “And then Janis pointing out places—‘Well, I had an apartment there. That’s where we play’—that kind of stuff.”\n\n“She was talking about getting me enrolled in a local California university,” Laura said. “And the parents were, like, ‘Nope, nope, nope!’ ”\n\nIn San Francisco, they saw Janis play the Avalon Ballroom. “That was one of the high points of my life as a fourteen-year-old punk,” Michael said. “I got to run the light show! Chet Helms had been her original manager, an old friend from Texas. Moby Grape was on the bill that night, and they asked Moby Grape if they could sit out a set so that Big Brother could go on, because Janis’s parents were here.” They saw her in concert one other time, in Houston. “My mom tried to buy tickets to the show,” Michael continued. “And Janis goes, ‘I can get you in!’ ”\n\nThe last time they saw Janis was in 1970, when she returned to Port Arthur for her ten-year high-school reunion. “They had no experience of rock and roll,” Laura said of her sister’s classmates. “They were still living at home and trying to be insurance agents and stuff like that. She was travelling around the world. She wanted them to say, ‘My God, Janis, you’re the most incredible thing!’ ” Janis attended with boas in her hair, Laura in tow. “The award they gave her was a tire, for having come the longest distance,” Laura went on. “It was one of those things where you don’t necessarily get your fantasy, but maybe you get what you need.” (That night, Janis took Laura to meet Jerry Lee Lewis backstage at his show, and he told Laura, “You wouldn’t be bad looking if you weren’t trying to look like your sister.” Janis slugged him.)\n\nThe Joplins have been hands-off with “A Night with Janis Joplin,” but they provided the director with biographical tidbits, including that the family grew up listening to show tunes. “We had them on all the time—‘Threepenny Opera,’ you know, ‘Mack the Knife,’ ” Michael said. “So it’s fabulous that we’re on Broadway. Our mother would just be bursting at the seams.”\n\nPhotograph by Joan Marcus."
