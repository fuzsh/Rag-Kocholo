        "text": "William Gates\n\n\"The film was a blessing because it opened doors for me and Arthur that may have been closed.\"\n\n--William Gates\n\nThough Gates admitted with a grin that he hasn't played ball in five months, he revived his dreams of NBA glory in 2000.\n\nWorking alongside Michael Jordan, Gates shed 60 pounds, worked out five hours a day and \"got the bug back.\" Invited to attend both the Washington Wizards and Chicago Bulls training camps. He did well, but then a string of injuries sidelined him. If you remember from the film, it was repeated injuries to his knee which seemed to begin his disillusionment with professional basketball, in general.Gates simply shrugged, saying, \"Lord, I understand.\"\n\n\"The question in my mind was, 'Would I have been good enough to play in the NBA?' and God gave me that answer. Yeah, I'm good enough.\"\n\nHis curiosity satiated, Gates focused on his other life passion - God.\n\nReturning to his roots in Chicago's Cabrini Green public housing development, Gates now serves as a minister with the Living Faith Community Center.\n\nGiven his well-publicized prowess on the court, Gates said basketball serves as a convenient tool in his preaching.\n\n\"I can tell the guys, '10 a.m. Saturday, we're playing ball,' and 75 of them will turn out. It gives me an opportunity for some outreach ministry.\"\n\nNearly 10 years ago, Gates married his high school girlfriend, who is also in the film. The couple lives in Chicago with their three children. A fourth child is expected soon.\n\nAgee now lives in Los Angeles, where he continues to play basketball, Gates said.\n\n--------------\n\nArthur Agee\n\nAfter high school, Arthur attended junior college in Missouri before moving on to Division 1 Arkansas State University, where he furthered his skills starring as the team's starting point guard. While his collegiate eligibility has been completed, Arthur remains diligent in school working towards his communications degree.\n\nArthur's dream became a reality with his selection as the #1 overall draft pick in the USBL. The USBL served as a positive stepping stone for Arthur, allowing him to garner the needed playing time to further increase his marketability as a professional. From there, Arthur was signed by the International Basketball Association's Winnipeg Cyclones, whose general manager is a former head scout for the NBA's New Jersey Nets. Arthur realizes that the experience and exposure of playing in the IBA will allow him to become a legitimate NBA prospect in the near future.\n\nWhile basketball remains at the top of his list, Arthur understands that sports is only a temporary arena for his future. After completing his professional athletic career, Arthur hopes to utilize his communications degree and experience in order to continue his involvement in Broadcast Journalism. Arthur realizes that he did not attain his success solely because of his athletic ability. Rather, it was a combination of his will to rise above his troubled background and a willingness to create a positive image for others. Arthur has become a well rounded role model both on and off the court.\n\nFurthering this belief, Arthur has co-founded the Arthur Agee Role Model Foundation based in Chicago. The Foundation will allow Arthur to share his successes with others, creating an organization which helps the youth of today. Arthur serves as the lead role model for the program, providing inner-city youth with someone to emulate. Arthur Agee truly personifies the ideal that regardless of background, dreams do come true.\n\nHe was also in SlamBall (2002) - Rumble Handler(Season 2)\n\nNT, \"WHAT THE HELL YOU KNOW ABOUT HOOP DREAMS!\", but anyway, I'm glad you saw it. That movie featured one of the best high school basketball conferences in the country, the Red West on the WESTSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE!!!!!!!. Quinton Richardson, Randy Brown, Mark Aguire, Eddie Johnson, Ken Norman just to name a few came from that division. We kinda claim Michael Finley and Corey Maggette on the westside because they are from neighboring suburbs Maywood and Bellwood. They got marks out there that can hoop as well. Antwoine Walker, Juwan Howard, and Tim Hardaway are southsiders. The area is a straight hot bed of unfortunately too much unrealized basketball potential, sadly to say. You got to have heart when you come to the court. I can say this because this was the part of the westside I was born and raised. Just a week ago, this girl from the suburbs thought it was funny that in the winter time after it snowed that we swept the snow off of the court and ran a whole court for a few hours. It was like you weren't a man if you could play. Yo azz betta been good at something else or you damn near wasn't sh@t.\n\nAgee was off of Jackson between Pulaski and Independence. Gates lived in row houses by Cabrini Green. Everytime I watch the movie I see a different aspect that reminds me that some people just don't realized how good they have because everybody ain't able. I mean it took Gates 1.5 to 2 hours one commute to school everyday. No school bus, just public transportation. Straight be out the house by 6 a.m. rain, sleet , or snow. Below zero weather darker than an MF outside just to go to high school. Mind you, he's not the only one. If had attended Lane Tech. I would have to done the same thing.\n\nBut the sadest story was when in the November of '84 Ben Wilson was killed right before the season started. He was the number one high school player in the nation at the time (Nick Anderson was on his team. He said he wore the #25 in the memory of him). Being a 6'7-6'9 point guard was not that common back then. Straight shakin' fools. His team just one state last season. He was shot by two guys believed to be G.D. I went to school with a southsiders (WY) and the following day people were straight up bawling in the hall ways, the lunchroom, it just touched so many people. He knew so many people, he was that well known. I still remember the story in the paper where it said that he was so tall that his legs hung off of the hospital bed. He was buried in his high school basketball uniform. To top it off, a girl basketball player had transferred to my high school from Simeon (his H.S.). She took a dance class and toward the end of the year she performed a routine in class to \"Missing You\" by Diana Ross. They said during the routine she started crying. By the time she finished, the whole room was sobbing. They even did a Reebok comercial on him in '98 or '99. I still get misty eyed thinking about that.\n\nGood luck to both men in their future endeavors.\n\nIf there are muliple error in this post, please forgive me, its an emotional subject. Hoop Dreams literally was \"MY HOOD\" Homan and Lexington. Sears Lot baby."
