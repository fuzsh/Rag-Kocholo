        "text": "The name didn’t jump out at me right away on Houston Baptist’s basketball roster. The face did. Unmistakably, I’d seen it before — in “Hoop Dreams,” an acclaimed documentary released in 1994 that chronicled the journeys of two Chicago high school basketball stars, William Gates and Arthur Agee.\n\nHouston Baptist guard Will Gates Jr. is the spitting image of his father.\n\nWill Gates Jr. — along with his brother, Jalon, and the rest of the Houston Baptist basketball team — plays against Michigan State at 6 p.m. Monday at Breslin Center.\n\nMORE: Michigan State vs. Houston Baptist tipoff - Analysis, prediction\n\nWill Gates Jr., like his dad, grew up in Chicago and played for a while for legendary coach Gene Pingatore at St. Joseph’s in the near-west suburbs. William Gates Sr., nearly 30 years ago, was seen as the second coming of Detroit Pistons’ great Isiah Thomas, who’d started at St. Joseph’s a decade earlier.\n\nWilliam Sr.’s hoop dreams were derailed by a knee injury in high school — this was before doctors could properly fix a knee. He played college basketball at Marquette but was never again the superstar he was as a sophomore in high school.\n\nMORE:\n\nCouch: Against Oakland, Michigan State shows traits of a champion – and of something less\n\nMichigan State's Tom Izzo visits former star Keith Appling in jail\n\nWill Gates Jr., who finished his high school career in San Antonio, Texas, and began his college career at Furman in South Carolina, is a fifth-year senior at Houston Baptist, averaging 9.0 points per game. Jalen, a sophomore, averages 10.2.\n\nTheir basketball journeys are less high-profile than their father’s, though his legacy in Chicago, in part because of “Hoop Dreams,” has been a lot to live up to — especially for Will Jr., who came along first and has the same name and, of course, that recognizable face.\n\nHere’s my conversation with Will Gates Jr. ahead of Monday's game against MSU:\n\nCouch: How often do you get asked about the \"Hoop Dreams\" connection and your father?\n\nWill Gates Jr.: Quite a bit, depending on who knows about the movie. I think last year (my first year playing the entire season at Houston Baptist) quite a few people wanted to talk about it and discuss it. Over the span of my life, of course, I’ve gotten it a lot, especially when I was living in Chicago.\n\nQ: How many times have you seen the film?\n\nA: I can’t even count.\n\nQ: I came to love the film, but when I saw it when I was 14, I remember thinking it was really long. What were your first impressions?\n\nA: Interestingly enough, my dad didn’t even let me watch the entire movie until maybe about eighth grade. I’d end up watching the first part of the movie from (his) freshman year to sophomore year and then he would just cut it off. So I didn’t know how long it was until eighth grade. Even when I saw it in eighth grade, I thought, this is a pretty long movie, but the story progressed pretty naturally so I thought it was pretty good.\n\nQ: Why did he cut it off? What did he not want you to see?\n\nA: He didn’t want me to see him go through the injuries. He didn’t want me to be sad about it or think it was going to happen to me. He wanted me to see him before any of his injuries were going down, just seeing how hard he was playing, his confidence that he was spewing out there when he was on the court. My dad was one of the top players in the country when he was a sophomore in high school. I think he just wanted me to see that and envision in my mind that that’s what I could do, as well.\n\nQ: What was it like going to St. Joseph’s after your dad?\n\nA: Pretty much all my life I knew I was going there for high school. Because I had been at their basketball camp since third grade. I had already known all the coaches. I’ve known coach Ping(atore) practically since I was born. So when I went there, it wasn’t a surprise or anything weird. It was more like a dream come true for me because that’s just where my eyes had been set on to go my entire life.\n\nQ: How has your hoops journey been different than your dad’s?\n\nA: I think it was a little bit tougher because obviously of who he was and me playing high school basketball in Chicago where everybody pretty much knows who my dad is or was. I had a lot of pressure to live up to that sometimes wasn’t even put on me from other people. It was me putting it on myself, because I felt I had to basically repeat everything that he did to be successful.\n\nThen we moved to San Antonio, Texas, and pretty much nobody knew anything about it. Only a select few people knew about the movie. So I was able to build my own reputation as a basketball player. I think that helped me calm down from the expectations and things I had put on myself.\n\nQ: Is that why you left St. Joe’s, before you went to San Antonio, to be your own person?\n\nA: I think that was possibly a part of it at the time because I didn’t feel like I was living up to everything he had done there. I wasn’t very happy at the time. My first day at St. Joe’s, I came in there and there was a kid who looked at me, didn’t even really know me, and he’s like, ‘You’re not going to be as good as your dad.’ I had to deal with things like that. In retrospect, me going there wasn’t the best idea, knowing my dad’s history there. But like I said, when I was a kid, that’s the only place I wanted to go.\n\nQ: When you play at a place like Michigan State, and I know you guys at Houston Baptist play a lot of these types of games, what does success look like? What’s the realistic hope when you walk in a locker room before a game?\n\nA: Always, it’s for our guys to go out there and compete. No matter what level you are, you’re a basketball player at the end of the day, so you should want to go out there and compete to the best of your ability. We just want to get better as a team. Maybe we’ll run our stuff better than we usually do. We’ll cut harder, we’ll get down, we’ll play defense the way we’re supposed to play. We know we may have some disadvantages, maybe height or maybe athleticism or things like that. But overall it’s just coming out competing and playing hard.\n\nContact Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.
