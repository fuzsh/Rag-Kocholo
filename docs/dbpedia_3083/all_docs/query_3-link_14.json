        "text": "Seven years ago, SC Featured introduced viewers to Arthur, a resilient dog whose extraordinary journey unfolded during an adventure race in Ecuador.\n\nNow, this unforgettable story is set to grace the big screen in Lionsgate’s upcoming film “Arthur the King,” starring Mark Wahlberg, in theaters today.\n\nArthur’s journey from a 2017 SC Featured bearing his name to a major motion picture from Lionsgate speaks volumes about the impact of the SC Featured brand, an Emmy-winning storytelling series with a longstanding tradition of Sunday features within ESPN’s distinguished news and information program, SportsCenter. It uncovers the extraordinary in the every day, showcasing the strength of the human (and canine) spirit in adversity.\n\nJose Morales, Vice President of Production, emphasized SC Featured’s commitment to authentic storytelling, “Arthur’s move to the big screen reflects the storytelling strength of SC Featured, highlighting our dedication and success with sharing powerful narratives across sports.”\n\nIn a promo on SportsCenter from Lionsgate for “Arthur the King,” which was shown last weekend following the airing of the SC Featured, Wahlberg credited the feature as one of the sources of inspiration for the film.\n\nArthur’s story resonated deeply, emphasizing the unbreakable bond between humans and animals and the incredible feats possible through determination and companionship.\n\n“The bond between dogs and humans is a truly wonderful thing,” said Scott Van Pelt, host of SportsCenter with Scott Van Pelt, and narrator of the SC Featured piece on Arthur. “I know all about it. The story of how Arthur found his family is incredible. Any dog lover will be spellbound.”\n\nESPN SC Featured continues its tradition of sharing compelling stories in the world of sports and beyond. The upcoming slate of features includes:\n\nMarch 17, “HANDLE HARD BETTER”: How Duke women’s basketball Head Coach Kara Lawson’s “HANDLE HARD BETTER” message has helped a slew of coaches and teachers inspire their teams and classrooms.\n\nMarch 24, “CAITLIN CLARK”: Dreams, goals, and an unrelenting competitive fire have all shaped the player and the person that University of Iowa basketball star Clark has become. SC Featured looks back at her West Des Moines roots and the path that led her to the all-time scoring record.\n\nMarch 31, “ME’ARAH O’NEAL”: She is the youngest child in a famous family of athletes and reality stars, headed by her father, NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal. Now, as a high school senior and coveted women’s basketball recruit, it is Me’Arah’s moment to emerge from her father’s shadow and make a name for herself."
