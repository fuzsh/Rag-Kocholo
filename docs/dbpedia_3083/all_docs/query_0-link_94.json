        "text": "Even the most prolific scorers need an assist now and then.\n\nArthur Dukes, a 22-year-old sophomore at LaGuardia Community College in Queens, is dominating Division III junior college men’s basketball with a league-leading 30.8 points per game.\n\nBut just a few months ago, the Harlem native was homeless, unsure of where he’d sleep at night.\n\n“I was lost,” he told The Post.\n\nHis landlord in the Bronx abruptly raised his rent in early October, nearly doubling the cost of his single-room with a shared-bathroom from $430 to $700. He had just 10 days to pay up or get out.\n\nShort on funds, the student-athlete, who worked at Target Herald Square in the offseason, had no choice but to pack his bags and leave.\n\nHe spent nearly a week at seedy hotels on 96th Street, but his savings soon dried up, leaving him to sleep on the street.\n\nHe spent his days doing school work on his phone along 72nd Street, unsure of where to find his next hot meal or warm bed.\n\n“I didn’t have much … It was a situation like, ‘Where am I going next? … How am I going to be able to handle this?'” said Dukes. “This was about a week and half before our season started. So, now I’m scrambling trying to find out my next move and I didn’t want to ask for help.”\n\nBut, ultimately, he had no choice. The desperate student-athlete opened up to his coach, 45-year-old Jarrett Lockhart.\n\n“I was like, ‘Coach, my living situation is not good right now,'” Dukes said. “And he picked up the phone right away and made a call.”\n\nLockhart connected Dukes with Rhonda Mouton, director of LaGuardia CARES, a public- and privately-funded program that provides resources to students grappling with education obstacles such as living expenses, food, health care, housing and childcare.\n\n“It’s one of those things where a kid can be embarrassed, but I’m glad we have that relationship that he was able to open up to me. I made that call right on the spot,” said Lockhart,\n\nMouton hooked him up with a temporary living situation in Brooklyn through LaGuardia CARES’ partnership with AirBnB, and in December, helped set in motion his current, more permanent residence –an apartment on 219th Street and White Plains Road in the Bronx.\n\nDespite his housing insecurity, the 5-foot-9 point guard went on to have a banner season. On Dec. 9 and Jan. 4, he ferociously filled the bucket, scoring 50 points in games against both Kingsborough Community College and Passaic County Community College. He also poured in 46 points on Tuesday versus Suffolk County Community College, including 17 of 18 free throws.\n\n“Along with being physically strong, he’s so mentally strong to get through this,” said Lockhart.\n\nDukes’ wasn’t always such a standout player.\n\nFor his freshman year in 2021-2022, he played on the team at Monroe Community College but saw little playing time. He averaged just one point per game and eventually redshirted the season.\n\nHe then took a year off to work — and work on his game. A longtime basketball mentor in Harlem connected him with Lockhart, who saw something in Dukes and got to work.\n\n“I didn’t know he was going to score 30 points a game, but I knew he was going to be good because he’s mature, he’s quick and has all the intangibles,” said Lockhart, who eventually recruited him to LaGuardia. “He’s a phenomenal young man.”\n\nDukes has also been surprised by his success, and now, with Lockhart’s encouragement, has his sights set on transferring to a Division I or II school next year.\n\n“I was coming into the season with faith and some enthusiasm, but I did not know I would be in this place. It’s been a road and I haven’t had time to digest it,” he said. “It’s like I’m in my own movie.”"
