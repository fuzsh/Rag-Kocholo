        "text": "During the coronavirus shutdown, each day we will bring you a recommendation from The Post’s Peter Botte for a sports movie, TV show or book that perhaps was before your time or somehow slipped between the cracks of your viewing/reading history.\n\nHoop Dreams (1994)\n\nRated: PG-13\n\nStreaming: Amazon Prime\n\nLong before ESPN’s 30-for-30 series and Netflix increased the prominence of in-depth sports documentaries, a thought-provoking 3-hour film that initially was intended to be a 30-minute PBS short introduced us to and exposed the world of high school and college recruitment in our inner cities.\n\nThe story followed two African-American teenagers in Chicago, William Gates and Arthur Agee, from the time they were 14 years old, beginning with their recruitment to play basketball at an affluent suburban Illinois private school, St. Joseph’s, which boasted Isiah Thomas as a famous alumnus.\n\nDirector Steve James shot over 250 hours of footage over the next five years, including multiple travails for both families, through the players’ freshman year of college, where the NBA dreams for both stalled.\n\nGates suffered multiple serious knee injuries before attending and playing at Marquette, while Agee was forced to leave St. Joseph’s due to financial problems and began at a community college in Missouri before attending Arkansas State.\n\nThe critically acclaimed documentary won multiple awards (including the Grand Jury prize at Sundance Film Festival), but it controversially was omitted from the 1994 Oscar nominations.\n\nRenowned film critic Roger Ebert later called it the best film of the 1990s, and both players eventually received about $200,000 apiece in royalties.\n\nAgee started a “Hoop Dreams” clothing line and has worked as a motivational speaker through the Arthur Agee Jr. Foundation. He was arrested for aggravated assault of a woman in 2017, but those charges later were dropped.\n\nGates later became a pastor and relocated to Texas; two of his sons, Will Jr. (Furman, Houston Baptist) and Jalon (Houston Baptist) have played college basketball.\n\nQuote of Note: “When somebody says, ‘When you get to the NBA, don’t forget about me,’ I should’ve said to them, “If I don’t make it, don’t you forget about me.” — William Gates."
