        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Already suffering from roundball withdrawals now that the conference finals between the Celtics and the Heat and the Spurs and the Thunder are finally over?\n\nHere are some gym-dandy basketball movies to keep you going until the NBA Finals tip off Tuesday night.\n\n\"Blue Chips\" (1994). Nick Nolte channels his inner Bobby Knight as a short-fused college coach who is tempted to bend the rules after a season on the brink puts him on the hot seat. With Shaquille O'Neal, Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway and Marques Johnson.\n\n\"Coach Carter\" (2005). Samuel L. Jackson commands respect as a no-nonsense high school coach who values character and grades over talent and winning.\n\n\"He Got Game\" (1998). Denzel Washington stars as a convict who hopes to get his sentence reduced by persuading his superstar son (played by NBA great Ray Allen) to sign with a certain college. Knicks superfan Spike Lee directs.\n\n\"Hoop Dreams\" (1994). Oscar-nominated documentary follows teenage hoops stars William Gates and Arthur Agee, who see basketball as their escape from the harsh realities of life in the Chicago projects.\n\n\"Hoosiers\" (1986). In one of the greatest sports dramas ever, Gene Hackman plays an outcast coach who gets his shot at redemption and leads a bunch of hicks from the sticks to the Indiana high school championship.\n\n\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975). OK, so it's not really a basketball movie. But in a pickup game, even Shaq would have trouble stopping Will Sampson's Chief in the low post.\n\n\"Semi-Pro\" (2008). We admit it. We'll watch Will Ferrell in just about anything. Including this.\n\n\"White Men Can't Jump\" (1992). Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson play an unlikely pair of street hustlers who team up to work the asphalt courts of LA.\n\nSo, what are your favorite basketball movies?"
