        "text": "CHICAGO -- On a chilly morning, two old friends are supposed to meet for a game of basketball.\n\nThe shy, steadier of the pair arrives early; and the other, a fun-loving extrovert, almost two hours late.\n\nThe tardy one, Arthur Agee, strolls into his buddy's office with a playful smile, talking of car trouble.\n\nWilliam Gates immediately forgives him.\n\nFor more than a decade, they have been bound by unexpected fame: The two Chicago high-school basketball players were featured in Hoop Dreams, a 1994 documentary.\n\nTheir contrasting fates, as of their mid-30s, might surprise the many people who saw the movie.\n\nThe reserved Gates, a married father of four, has become an authoritative force who leads a church in the Cabrini area.\n\nAgee, a spirited charmer, doesn't have a regular job but is launching a line of \"Hoop Dreams\" apparel. He has five children by five women.\n\n\"You ain't even Mr. Gates; now it's Pastor Gates,\" Agee said as the two men embraced.\n\nMuch has changed since filmmakers began chronicling their lives in 1987, when the 14-year-olds saw the NBA as their way out of poverty.\n\nEnduring close to three-hour commutes, the boys enrolled at St. Joseph High School in suburban Westchester, Ill., as freshmen.\n\nThe private Roman Catholic school had famously launched the career of Isiah Thomas, whom both had long idolized.\n\nGates, a more promising player than Agee, injured his right knee during his junior year. A year earlier, his girlfriend, Catherine Mines, had given birth to a baby girl, Alicia. Gates still accepted a scholarship from Marquette University in Milwaukee, but the injury dogged him.\n\nAgee left St. Joseph at the beginning of his sophomore year when his parents couldn't meet their share of his tuition. Devastated, he transferred to Marshall High School in Chicago. His team made it to the state finals his senior year.\n\nAfter graduating from Marshall, Agee enrolled in Mineral Area Junior College in Flat River, Mo., and later transferred to Arkansas State University. He didn't graduate from college, but he played semiprofessional basketball.\n\nIn 1996, he was offered a spot on the Continental Basketball Association's Connecticut Pride but passed it up because it conflicted with a part in a cable film by Steve James, director of Hoop Dreams. Agee also had an uncredited spot in Spike Lee's 1998 film He Got Game.\n\nThe teenagers knew each other casually before Hoop Dreams was made, but they grew extremely close during the five years of filming.\n\nThey predict that their connection will last all their lives. Agee was one of the first people Gates called when his brother Curtis was murdered in 2001; Agee called Gates immediately after his father, \"Bo\" Agee, a Chicago minister, was slain.\n\n\"At the end of the day, he's my guy,\" Gates said. \"And I know he feels the same way.\"\n\nAgee credits Gates for being honest with him, even when it's about something he doesn't want to hear.\n\nAgee lives in Bartlett, a northwestern suburb of Chicago, with his girlfriend, Jennifer Genovesi, and their 8-month-old son, Devin. His four other children, Anthony, 16; Ashley, 16; Deja, 12; and Aiysha, 2; each live with their respective mothers. Agee said he pays more than $900 a month in child support and is often broke.\n\nThings were looking more promising after Hoop Dreams made its debut.\n\nBecause of the film, Agee was able to move his family out of their Section 8 building into a bungalow.\n\nBoth men said they earned roughly $150,000 from the film.\n\nBut neither grew rich.\n\nAgee gave up on basketball in 1997.\n\nIn recent years, he has focused on his Arthur Agee Jr. Role Model Foundation, a nonprofit that works with underprivileged kids.\n\nHe also starred in a documentary called Hoop Realities. The film looks at Agee's attempts to launch the clothing line, follows a recent senior guard from Marshall and examines the difficulties of reaching the NBA.\n\nMeanwhile, no Hoop Dreams sequel is in the works, said Peter Gilbert, a producer of the original film.\n\nBut, he added, \"Never say never.\""
