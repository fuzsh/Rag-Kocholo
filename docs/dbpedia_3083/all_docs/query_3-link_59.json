        "text": "Hoop Dreams is a movie that every kid from Chicago should see before a certain age. Hell, anyone who has an inkling of basketball in them should watch Hoop Dreams before adolescence. The story of Arthur Agee and William Gates, two kids from Chicago's rough south and west sides won the 1994 Sundance Award for 'Best Documentary' and went on to inspire generations of kids and communities in its wake. Since then Agee has played semi-pro at a variety of locations, hit the Slamball court and today finds himself helping the community again through his Arthur Agee Foundation who's mission statement says it is \"to keep kids dreaming, but at the same, improve their chances and options where they can start dreaming of a life outside of basketball and sports\". Leaders is always down for the cause and this Saturday will have Agee in-store with t-shirts in celebration of the 20-year anniversary of the film. Earlier this week we donated some clothes to the kids at one of his basketball camps. Check out the photos below and stop in this Saturday to meet a true Chicago icon."
