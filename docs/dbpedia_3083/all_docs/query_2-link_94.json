        "text": "Team needs for each high-major team in the country and everything else you need to know about the looming transfer portal window.\n\nThe college basketball transfer portal is open. There were 1,834 transfers in the 2023 cycle, per Verbal Commits. What does the 2024 transfer portal cycle have in store?\n\nBuckle up.\n\nMonday kicks off a 45-day window for players to enter the transfer portal.\n\nThis will be the last cycle impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. That one extra year of eligibility for any player who was on a college roster during the 2020-21 campaign changed the complexion of the sport.\n\nIt opened the door for Dalton Knecht to play at Tennessee this season and cement himself as one of the best players in the country. It allowed Tristen Newton to stay at UConn for an extra year, and the do-everything point guard is now the favorite to take home Big East Player of the Year.\n\nIt also muddied the picture for prep recruiting with the fifth-year veterans sopping up plenty of those all-too-precious roster spots. The freshmen who do get inked haven't been playing much. UConn's Stephon Castle is the lone freshman in the Big East averaging double figures.\n\n“Can you sign four or five freshmen nowadays in the Big 12? If they don’t play, it’s so easy to transfer,” Porter Moser told 247Sports. “That’s a hard dynamic.”\n\nFor yet another season, getting old through the portal will be paramount.\n\nWhat about two-time transfers? A federal judge ruled in mid-December that all two-time transfers can compete immediately for the rest of the season. That's is the standard yet again for the upcoming cycle. It's a free for all.\n\nRoster-building gameplans never end and the portal won’t wait even if your season stretches deep into March.\n\nLast season, UConn’s staffers had to conduct Zoom calls with potential transfers just days before competing for the National Championship. UNC opted out of the NIT to focus on roster-building for 2023-24. It's a required balancing act.\n\nOf course, the coaching carousel will have its fingerprints all over the portal, too. DePaul already axed Tony Stubblefield and hired Chris Holtmann, but several other high-major gigs have opened. A change in leadership always leads to an outpouring of transfers, and a few coaches on the hot seat have talent-laden rosters some are just waiting for a chance to poach. Now is not the time nor place to speculate about which players could enter the portal, but the moving and shaking behind the scenes has already started to vibrate. Team needs will be top of mind when exit meetings are conducted, starting sometime in the next four weeks.\n\nWhat will each high-major team be looking for in the portal? What are the obvious needs? Let’s dive in:\n\nEditor's note: Each high-major conference features who will be in the league in 2024-25...\n\nBUTLER\n\nPriority:Roster Retention | Nine of the 10 guys that Butler has leaned on for minutes amidst its resurgent season can return next season. If Butler can keep this band together, it won't enter the portal season needing to make major waves.\n\nDon’t overlook: Even ifJahmyl Telfort,Posh Alexander orD.J. Davis choose to leave that extra year of eligibility on the table, Butler’s pitch in the transfer portal is way better now than it was a year ago. Regardless of how the rest of the season plays out, there’s a proof of concept here for this group under head coach Thad Matta.\n\nCREIGHTON\n\nPriority:Game-changing wing | It’s safe to assume that Creighton’s Big Three ofTrey Alexander,Ryan Kalkbrenner andBaylor Scheierman will all be gone next year. That’s scary, but it’s also an opportunity for Creighton to flex its muscles (again) in the portal.Fredrick King can step into Kalkbrenner’s role, and four-star freshmanJackson McAndrew is a sniper who should take some of Scheierman’s responsibilities. The portal should be the best bet to find Creighton’s Alexander replacement. Creighton has gotten a dude in each of the past two seasons. It needs another one in the 2024 cycle.\n\nDon’t overlook: Getting a second season out of Scheierman has been clutch. Can Creighton get a second season out ofSteven Ashworth? He has a big decision on the docket.\n\nUCONN\n\nPriority: Veteran Shooter | UConn could easily lose all five starters to graduation or the NBA Draft, but UConn has dipped into the portal in back-to-back cycles for game-changing guards (Tristen Newton in 2022, Cam Spencer in 2023). A veteran shot-maker would be vital to mentor UConn's talented stable of rising guards.\n\nDon’t overlook: The stay-or-go 2024 NBA Draft decision from Alex Karaban will be incredibly important to UConn's roster-construction gameplan. That could stretch for a minute, too.\n\nDEPAUL\n\nPriority: Point Guard | It's been a few years since DePaul had a real asset at point guard. Can it find one in the 2024 cycle?\n\nDon’t overlook: DePaul will have to do more with less in the transfer portal. The scouting will be vital to uncover a gem.\n\nGEORGETOWN\n\nPriority:Veteran Guard | Georgetown can get bothJayden Epps andRowan Brumbaugh back for another year, butJay Heath is out of eligibility, and the Hoyas could desperately use an adult in the room who can make winning plays on both ends of the floor.\n\nDon’t overlook: Adding a forward who can shoot it will be important, butDrew Fielder andSupreme Cook are a nice frontcourt duet forEd Cooley to build around in 2024-25.\n\nMARQUETTE\n\nPriority: Big man | Oso Ighodaro is on track to be a first-round pick. Marquette doesn't need to splurge for a star center, but a serviceable defender who can team up with sweet-shooting forward Ben Gold would be ideal.\n\nDon’t overlook: All eyes will be on the stay-or-go decisions from Kam Jones andTyler Kolek, but Marquette didn't have anyone transfer out of the program last year. Will that happen again?\n\nPROVIDENCE\n\nPriority:TheJosh Oduro replacement | You can't survive in the Big East without a do-it-all big man. Oduro has turned into that for Providence this year, andKim English needs to find another one in the '24 cycle.\n\nDon’t overlook: Providence is already losing Oduro andTicket Gaines.Devin Carter andBryce Hopkins leaving is also on the table. There could be other exits as well. English could be looking at needing to add up to five transfers.\n\nSETON HALL\n\nPriority: Backcourt firepower | Guard play is everything for Shaheen Holloway, and Seton Hall could have to replace its best two. Al-Amir Dawes will be out of eligibility, and Kadary Richmond could parlay a breakout season into testing a weak NBA draft.\n\nDon’t overlook: Seton Hall would be an even bigger player in the guard market if Dylan Addae-Wusu and Dre Davis choose not to use their free COVID year.\n\nST. JOHN'S\n\nPriority:Guards |Nahiem Alleyne,Jordan Dingle andDaniss Jenkins are all gone, so St. John's coachRick Pitino will be big-game hunting for guards, yet again.\n\nDon’t overlook: Both freshmen (Simeon Wilcher andBrady Dunlap) look like keepers. Can St. John's keep 'em in the fold?\n\nVILLANOVA\n\nPriority:Talented Wings | Hakim Hart andTyler Burton were two big gets for Villanova in the '23 cycle. It has to restock its wings in a hurry with Hart, Burton andJustin Moore exiting.\n\nDon’t overlook: Getting a fifth season out ofEric Dixon would be enormous.\n\nXAVIER\n\nPriority: Frontcourt depth | Xavier's injury-ravaged frontcourt is well-documented. Sean Miller's history with bigs is tremendous, and some veteran difference-makers could waltz into enormous roles as soon as next season.\n\nDon’t overlook: Portal success | Miller has a pipeline with C-USA transfers. Souley Boum was awesome last season. Quincy Olivari has been a smash this season, and Dayvion McKnight is as solid as ever. That might resonate.\n\nARIZONA\n\nPriority:Forward |Keshad Johnson is the only rotation player out of eligibility after the season, and incoming top-20 freshman forwardCarter Bryant seems earmarked for at least some of Johnson's minutes Even ifOumar Ballo departs, Arizona has current freshmanMotiejus Krivas ready to step into a massive role. Arizona could certainly use a third veteran forward with some lineup versatility, and that might not break the bank.\n\nDon’t overlook: Stay-or-go, NBA Draft decisions fromCaleb Love andPelle Larsson will have their fingerprints all over whetherTommy Lloyd is looking for another elite guard or wing in the portal.\n\nARIZONA STATE\n\nPriority:The glass |Bobby Hurley has to find a way to buff up one of the worst-rebounding teams on both ends of the floor before it gets sent to the Big 12 gauntlet.\n\nDon’t overlook: Can Arizona State keep its backcourt ofAdam Miller,Jamiya Neal andFrankie Collins together for another year?\n\nBAYLOR\n\nPriority: Winning veterans | Baylor already has to replace its starting point guard (RayJ Dennis), but its starting center (Yves Missi) and starting wing (Ja'Kobe Walter) are on the fast track to being first-round picks, too. Jalen Bridges has been in college for five years (including a redshirt year at West Virginia), so is it time to test his NBA luck after he's shot the cover off the rock this year? Baylor could be looking at a lot of change. The talent influx is certainly coming. Five-star wing VJ Edgecombe headlines Baylor's fifth-ranked recruiting class, but landing some winning veterans at multiple positions will be vital for Scott Drew and Co.\n\nDon’t overlook: Baylor might not need a starting big man (Josh Ojianwuna could be ready for that spot), but it certainly needs another rotation piece for its frontcourt. It's not the No. 1 priority, but Baylor can't whiff on adding ready-to-play frontcourt depth.\n\nBYU\n\nPriority: Downhill guard | Can BYU find a guard who can be a bit different than the rest? Spencer Johnson is out of eligibility, so BYU could have an opening to add another piece to its backcourt. BYU has plenty of shooting. Could it land someone who can get downhill and put real pressure on the defense?\n\nDon’t overlook: Retention will be huge for Mark Pope and his staff. There is a chance that BYU could get 11 of its 12 guys on the roster back for next season. Continuity is everything these days and BYU could have it next year in spades.\n\nCINCINNATI\n\nPriority:3-and-D guard |John Newman III is the head of the snake of Cincinnati's defense and when healthy,CJ Fredrick can make some shots. The Bearcats could lose both of those seniors. CanWes Miller find one piece in the portal that can shoot like Fredrick and guard like Newman?\n\nDon’t overlook: Miller has built up some real depth in the frontcourt. Cincinnati could getViktor Lakhin,Jamille Reynolds andAziz Bandaogo all back.\n\nCOLORADO\n\nPriority:Firepower | Colorado could lose its best three players ahead of the move to the Big 12. IfTad Boyle has to replace all three ofCody Williams,KJ Simpson andTristan da Silva, he might need to go big in the portal. That's a ton of opportunity and shots to sell.\n\nDon’t overlook: If Colorado can getEddie Lampkin andJ'Vonne Hadley back for another year, that'd ease the timeline on Colorado's young, rising bigs.\n\nHOUSTON\n\nPriority: Point guard? | Jamal Shead has another year of eligibility if he wants, and he's played at an All-America-type level this season. If Shead decides to test his luck at the next level, Houston's transfer portal game plan will get interesting in a jiffy. Fellow seniors like J'Wan Roberts, Damian Dunn and LJ Cryer will all have intriguing stay-or-go decisions to make as well.\n\nDon’t overlook: Houston can get everyone back (it won't).\n\nIOWA STATE\n\nPriority:Instant impact big men | Iowa State will need to revamp its frontcourt with ready-made, rotation players.Robert Jones,Tre King andHason Ward are all out of time.\n\nDon’t overlook: Iowa State's backcourt is in a nice spot withKeshon Gilbert,Curtis Jones,Tamin Lipsey,Demarion Watson andJackson Paveletzke all having at least another year of eligibility, but can Iowa State get them all back?\n\nKANSAS\n\nPriority:Game-changing, two-way wing | Kansas needs itsKevin McCullar replacement. We'll see if it needs to replaceJohnny Furphy, too. But a big, physical wing who can defend and wants to elevate his NBA stock is hands-down the No. 1 need for KU in the portal.\n\nDon’toverlook: Kansas could getDajuan Harris,KJ Adams Jr. andHunter Dickinson all back next year. That would be incredible in Lawrence.\n\nKANSAS STATE\n\nPriority:Wing, and ... | Kansas State will need a game-changing wing ifArthur Kaluma bounces. It could use another veteran guard withQues Glover andTylor Perry exiting. A big-time big man wouldn't hurt, either.Jerome Tang may need to swing big at multiple spots.\n\nDon’t overlook: Incoming freshmanDavid Castillo and soon-to-be-sophomoreDai Dai Ames should be able to hold down the fort together in Kansas State's point guard room onceTylor Perry departs. Castillo and Ames have a shot to be real fun together.\n\nOKLAHOMA STATE\n\nPriority:More backcourt juice | Jarius Hicklen andJohn-Michael Wright will graduate, and Oklahoma State has numerous other backcourt pieces that have interesting decisions on the docket. But guard play is everything in the Big 12, and Oklahoma State needs more difference-makers.\n\nDon’t overlook:Mike Boynton opted to go young with a five-man 2023 recruiting class. Can it also get old?\n\nTCU\n\nPriority:Backcourt, backcourt, backcourt |Jameer Nelson Jr.,Avery Anderson III,Trey Tennyson andChuck O'Bannon are all gone. That's four of TCU's five rotation guards. Add a sixth if you includeEmanuel Miller who doesn't necessarily have a position. That's a lot of experience, pop and scoring walking out the door. TCU will need to reload that backcourt with high-ceiling transfers to hold serve in the new-look Big 12.\n\nDon’t overlook: TCU might not have to worry about getting into a dogfight with anyone over a portal big man ifErnest Udeh Jr.,Essam Mostafa andJaKobe Coles all run it back.\n\nTEXAS TECH\n\nPriority:Size | Warren Washington is definitely gone.Devan Cambridge is out of eligibility unless he's able to get a medical waiver to return after a devastating season-ending ACL injury. If Texas Tech has to replace both of those guys,Grant McCasland will be scouring the portal for a traditional shot-blocking center and another big, strong, powerful forward who can do anything and everything.\n\nDon’t overlook: Texas Tech doesn't have any commits in the Class of 2024. Certainly feels like a big portal class is on the way, and McCasland should have plenty of ammunition after Texas Tech's resurgent season.\n\nUCF\n\nPriority: Brawn | UCF is losing a lot of the length, power and physicality that has anchored its feisty defense. UCF will be in the market for a lot, but physicality is a must.\n\nDon’t overlook: UCF will be in the market for a whole lot more ifJohnny Dawkins is let go, but that's still up in the air. How UCF plays down the stretch will have its impact on the coaching carousel, the portal and everything in between.\n\nUTAH\n\nPriority:Branden Carlsonreplacement | Utah has a stable of rock-solid guards who can all return, but it needs more star power in its frontcourt once Carlson – an All-Pac-12 stud – departs. Craig Smith is a good coach with lots of tape to show talented forwards about what it could look like in Utah.\n\nDon’t overlook:Cole Bajema is also out of eligibility, so Utah is losing a lot of floor-spacing and shooting. Shotmakers feel like a must for anyone Utah targets in the portal.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA\n\nPriority: Frontcourt | Yes, West Virginia will have a new coach, but whoever it is will be targeting the frontcourt in a major way.Jesse Edwards,Quinn Slazinski andAkok Akok are all out of eligibility.\n\nDon’t overlook: Will a new coach look at anyone on West Virginia's current roster and go, 'That's a winning player, I need you to stay?' Or the Mountaineers be forced to go the build-a-whole-team method in the portal for a second straight offseason?\n\nBOSTON COLLEGE\n\nPriority: Game-changing big man | Quinten Post is out of eligibility. Can Earl Grant use Post's fabulous season (and BC career) to make waves in the portal?\n\nDon’t overlook: Boston College could get eight of nine rotations players back, so there's a supporting cast in place. But it needs more firepower at the top of the scouting report next to Jaeden Zackery and Claudell Harris Jr.\n\nCAL\n\nPriority:Backcourt | Fardaws Aimaq,Jalen Cone,Keonte Kennedy andJaylon Tyson will all likely be gone. They’ve been four of Cal’s best players. Mark Madsen will have to revamp the roster in a hurry again.\n\nDon’t overlook:Tyson’s emergence into a potential first-round pick should certainly help Madsen’s sell in a significant way.\n\nCLEMSON\n\nPriority:Veteran lead guards | Clemson is losing bothJoe Girard andChase Hunter. Star forward PJ Hall is also likely gone, but Clemson has some nice internal options in that frontcourt to build around long-term. None bigger thanIan Schieffelin.\n\nDon’t overlook: How Clemson plays in the next month will have a big impact on the portal. IfBrad Brownell can get to the Big Dance and keep the job, Clemson's roster should stay mostly intact. If not, well, you already know...\n\nDUKE\n\nPriority:Dynamic lead guard | Stay-or-go decisions from guardsTyrese Proctor,Jeremy Roach,Caleb Foster andJared McCain will have a huge say on what Duke needs in the portal. If three of the four depart, Duke will need a go-to guard.\n\nDon’t overlook: TheCooper Flagg effect. There might be a long list of transfers who want to play with a generational prospect like Flagg. What type of guard can slide alongside Flagg and complement him the best way?\n\nFLORIDA STATE\n\nPriority:Shooting, shooting and more shooting | Florida State is a poor shooting unit already, and its best sniper (Darin Green) is out of eligibility.\n\nDon’t overlook: Can FSU getJamir Watkins back for another season? The toolsy 6-foot-7, VCU transfer has quietly put himself in position to make some money. Does he need another year of seasoning or does he test his luck in a down 2024 NBA Draft?\n\nGEORGIA TECH\n\nPriority: Roster retention | Who Damon Stoudamire keeps will be more important than who he can land in the portal, but Georgia Tech should be in the market for more wing shooters since Kyle Sturdivant is out of eligibility and Miles Kelly could depart.\n\nDon’t overlook: Georgia Tech could certainly use a little more beef in its frontcourt. Georgia Tech has no one over 230 pounds in its rotation.\n\nLOUISVILLE\n\nPriority: Experience | The game plan of loading up on veteran transfers has helped a once-dead program like Cal generate real momentum this year. South Carolina did something similar this season. Louisville would be wise to follow that gameplan.\n\nDon’t overlook: Does Louisville prioritize a coach who can jumpstart a rebuild with some of his talent following him? Rick Pitino got stud point guard Daniss Jenkins to follow him from Iona to St. John's, Danny Sprinkle got Great Osobor to follow him from Montana State to Utah State, etc.\n\nMIAMI\n\nPriority:Size | It just has to be a priority to buff up one of the ACC's worst defenses.\n\nDon’t overlook:Everything is on the table for Miami this offseason.Nijel Pack signed a public two-year, $800,000 deal with LifeWallet when he transferred to Miami from Kansas State. Does he want a third year?Matt Cleveland,Norchad Omier,Wooga Poplar andKyshawn George couldall go pro or come back. Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle. The stay-or-go decisions are massive needle-movers for who Miami can go get in the portal. The exit meetings will be enormous.\n\nNOTRE DAME\n\nPriority:Wings | Notre Dame has two freshmen coming in who will help (Sir Mohammed andCole Certa) in that department, butMicah Shrewsberry could use anotherSeth Lundy-type to round out this roster and kickstart the rebuild in South Bend.\n\nDon’t overlook: Notre Dame can keep a bunch of this young core together next year.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nPriority: Veteran shooter and potentially an impact big man | Cormac Ryan is for sure gone andRJ Davis could opt to chase his professional dreams, so UNC will likely need to hit the portal for an experienced guard who can shoot the cover off it and add age to a young backcourt. UNC's backcourt picture could featureSeth Trimble,Elliot Cadeau,Drake Powell andIan Jackson who all have various forms of shooting questions/concerns. If Davis does return for a fifth season, the conversation changes.\n\nDon’t overlook:Armando Bacot is gone, but UNC will have to seriously consider the consequences of its actions if it chases a big-name frontcourt transfer. It was worth it for Kansas to secure Hunter Dickinson, even if it meant losing Ernest Udeh Jr. and Zuby Ejiofor. Will there be a big enough fish that's worth UNC losing someone like Jalen Washington?\n\nNC STATE\n\nPriority: Low-post presence | N.C. State needs a dynamic big man to replaceDJ Burns.Ben Middlebrooks andMohamed Diarra are solid depth weapons, but that shouldn’t stopKevin Keatts and Co. from chasing some big frontcourt dawgs in the portal. The sell is awesome.\n\nDon’t overlook: AssumingKevin Keatts can keep this group together, the Wolfpack might not need to hit the portal that hard for a guard. Another year of Michael O’Connell,Kam Woods, Dennis Parker III,Trey Parker andPaul McNeil provide various options, andJayden Taylor would be a massive candidate for the second-year transfer eruption.\n\nPITTSBURGH\n\nPriority: Buckets | Blake Hinson is gone and Bub Carrington could vault to the NBA, so Pitt will have oodles of available shots to sell potential transfers. Lead guards, big wings? Come one, come all.\n\nDon’t overlook: Pitt’s frontcourt next year could be nasty. The combination ofPapa Kante, Federiko Federiko,Jorge DiazGraham andGuillermo DiazGraham could be a phenomenal quartet... if Pitt can keep them all.\n\nSMU\n\nPriority:Rebounding | Samuell Williamson is out of eligibility, and SMU will need to buff up the interior to stay alive in the ACC. Expect SMU to be in the mix for another portal frontcourt piece.\n\nDon’t overlook:Chuck Harris,Keon Ambrose-Hylton andTyreek Smith all have decisions to make about using their free COVID year. That could change the complexion of SMU’s gameplan in the portal.\n\nSTANFORD\n\nPriority: Veterans. | Rotation pieces likeSpencer Jones,Michael Jones andJared Bynum are all out of eligibility, so this roster is going to have some real churn already. Plus, stay-or-go decisions fromMaxime Raynaud,Kanaan Carlyle andAndrej Stojakovic will be enormous. But the elephant in the room remains...\n\nDon’t overlook: The hot seat talk forJerod Haase isn’t going away and it’s deserved. This roster has no business hovering around .500.\n\nSYRACUSE\n\nPriority: Lead guard |Judah Mintz is likely jetting off to the NBA. Can Syracuse make waves in the portal for a guard who wants a chance to earn a Mintz-like role?JJ Starling should command a higher usage rate, but Syracuse needs another game-changer for this backcourt.\n\nDon’t overlook: Stud freshman forwardDonnie Freeman should help solve some of Syracuse’s frontcourt questions, but head coach Adrian “Red” Autry should certainly sniff around the big-man market.\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nPriority: Frontcourt | Jacob Groves andJordan Minor are out of eligibility, andRyan Dunn is a legit contender to be a first-round pick. Virginia should getBlake Buchanan back for his sophomore season, but UVA will need more frontcourt portal reinforcements.\n\nDon’t overlook: Will the burstyElijah Gertrude earn the trust of the staff to step into a big chunk ofReece Beekman's minutes, next season? Or will UVa chase another guard to join Gertrude,Isaac McKneely,Dante Harris andAndrew Rohde?\n\nVIRGINIA TECH\n\nPriority:Lead guard | Playing alongsideSean Pedulla should be very attractive for some of the top transfer guards in the country.\n\nDon’t overlook: Virginia Tech certainly needs a few more versatile frontcourt defenders withMekhi Long andRobbie Beran running out of eligibility, but freshmanRyan Jones could help solve some of those issues right away.\n\nWAKE FOREST\n\nPriority: Retention | Wake Forest has talent up and down this roster, and everyone can come back next year. Will that happen? Of course not. Attrition is always expected in this era of college hoops. But ifCam Hildreth,Hunter Sallis,Andrew Carr,Parker Friedrichsen,Efton Reid andBoopie Miller all come back, then business will be booming forSteve Forbes.\n\nDon’t overlook: Don't be surprised if Sallis goes through the NBA Draft process and helps himself aplenty.\n\nALABAMA\n\nPriority: Lead guard | Nate Oats hasn't had any issues selling his vision to stud guards in the portal, and he'll need another veteran guard to replace Aaron Estrada. He might need a second if Mark Sears dips.\n\nDon’t overlook: Will Grant Nelson go pro? If he stays, does that lead to attrition from some of Alabama's young forwards who are itching for some playing time?\n\nARKANSAS\n\nPriority: Point guard |Eric Musselman desperately needs a point guard he can trust. Maybe that'sLayden Blocker. Maybe that's someone in the portal. Arkansas has looked rudderless on the floor, and a stabilizing lead guard feels crucial.\n\nDon’t overlook: This frontcourt will look so different next year.Makhi Mitchell, Jalen Graham,Jeremiah Davenport,Chandler Lawson andTrevon Brazile could all be gone. What does Arkansas prioritize? Swinging big for one stud and a lot of role players? Will the mass-volume approach work?\n\nAUBURN\n\nPriority: Frontcourt help | Jaylin Williams will be out of eligibility, and Johni Broome has certainly done everything he can to improve his stock for NBA decision-makers. Auburn could have to replace both of its frontcourt studs. Dylan Cardwell and Chaney Johnson are internal options to earn more playing time, but that shouldn't stop Auburn from chasing another game-changing big man.\n\nDon’t overlook: Auburn, quietly, could get its whole backcourt back. Another year of KD Johnson, Denver Jones, Tre Donaldson and Aden Holloway might be a bit of a stretch, but it's not fully unrealistic, either.\n\nFLORIDA\n\nPriority:Point guard | Zyon Pullin has been fabulous, but he's out of time after the season ends.Walter Clayton Jr. might have played himself into the NBA Draft conversation, so he's another candidate to bounce. Florida will be on the lookout for a portal guard, yet again.\n\nDon’t overlook:Tyrese Samuel will be a big loss, but Florida is sneakily prepared to fill that void. KeepingAlex Condon,Micah Handlogten andThomas Haugh together would be an enormous win.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nPriority:Veteran lead guard | Noah Thomasson has been rock-solid for the Dawgs this year, but he'll be off to greener pastures after the season, so Georgia will need someone to at least push and/or spell young talented guards likeSilas Demary Jr. andBlue Cain (assuming both return).\n\nDon’t overlook: One more frontcourt piece would be excellent, but it could be tough for Georgia to gain a bunch of traction with a big man who wants a guaranteed starting spot if bothJalen DeLoach and five-starAsa Newell are in the mix.\n\nKENTUCKY\n\nPriority:ATre Mitchell replacement | A veteran forward who can be an offensive hub and make shots would be a lifesaver for a new brand of Kentucky basketball.John Calipari doesn't have that piece in his second-ranked 2024 recruiting class, but he can find one in the portal.\n\nDon’t overlook: The roster churn with Kentucky never ends. Seven or eight rotation players could be out the door with five more freshmen coming right in.\n\nLSU\n\nPriority:Big wing defender | LSU will lose its best wing defender (Jordan Wright), and that backcourt can get small in a hurry if two ofCarlos Stewart,Mike Williams III orJalen Cook are on the floor together. Adding a big wing who can sit down and guard will be vital.\n\nDon’t overlook:Will Baker andHunter Dean are gone, but LSU might not have to hit the market hard for another frontcourt piece. It opens the door forDerek Fountain,Daimion Collins andJalen Reed to sop up the lion's share of those frontcourt minutes, and that might not be a bad thing for LSU.\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE\n\nPriority: Frontcourt, frontcourt, frontcourt | Mississippi State might need multiple transfers to fill in for Tolu Smith, DJ Jeffries and Jimmy Bell Jr.\n\nDon’t overlook: You can always count on Chris Jans to do work at the junior college ranks.\n\nMISSOURI\n\nPriority:Dynamic point guard| Missouri's dazzling recruiting class could use a veteran point guard to run the show. There are a ton of available minutes withNick Honor andSean East exhausting their eligibility.\n\nDon’t overlook: Can Missouri getTamar Bates for a second year? And if so, just how good could he be in 2024-25?\n\nOKLAHOMA\n\nPriority:Wings | Le'Tre Darthard andRivaldo Soares are two rotation wings thatPorter Moser will already have to replace. We'll see if there are any others. The SEC has athletes galore, and OU might need to lean on the portal to find another one (or two) unlessKaden Cooper returns and is ready to make a big jump.\n\nDon’t overlook: Oklahoma could get all five starters back which could make the sell in the portal a bit more interesting.\n\nOLE MISS\n\nPriority:Two-way wing | Allen Flanigan has been a lifesaver for Ole Miss this year, andChris Beard could have bothMatt Murrell andBrandon Murray back next season. But Ole Miss should still hit the market for another wing. You can't ever have enough of 'em in this league.\n\nDon’t overlook: GettingMoussa Cisse back for another season would be paramount for the physical development of talented, four-star freshmanJohn Bol.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA\n\nPriority:Point guard |Ta'Lon Cooper has been a breath of fresh air for South Carolina's backcourt, butLamont Paris will need to parlay Cooper's strong season into another transfer lead guard.\n\nDon’t overlook: Can the Gamecocks keep the NBA away from freshmanCollin Murray-Boyles? He could be a flat-out star in Year 2.\n\nTENNESSEE\n\nPriority:Wings |Josiah Jordan-James,Santiago Vescovi andDalton Knecht will all be out the door. Tennessee has some internal options who will be ballers (Cameron Carr,remember the name), but the Vols should hit the portal hard again.\n\nDon’t overlook: Knecht's absurd season should give Tennessee all the ammunition it needs in the transfer portal to go big game hunting. Tennessee has answered any question some might have about how it would utilize an offense-first baller.\n\nTEXAS\n\nPriority:Shooters|Dylan Disu,Max Abmas, Ith Horton andBrock Cunningham have all shot it well from downtown this season. All are fifth-year seniors. Texas needs multiple snipers for multiple positions to round out this rotation becauseTyrese Hunter andChendall Weaver are two guards who could return and both have inconsistent shooting strokes.\n\nDon’t overlook: How high is Texas' retention rate? It's already losing four fifth-year seniors and sophomore wing Dillon Mitchell could be off to the NBA. That's five departures. How many more could depart?Rodney Terry could be looking at needing at least three transfers and maybe more.\n\nTEXAS A&M\n\nPriority:Game-changing lead guards | Texas A&M will certainly loseTyrese \"Boots\" Radford, andWade Taylor IV could also chase his NBA dreams. Texas A&M will need a jolt of playmaking and scoring from the portal.\n\nDon’t overlook: IfAndersson Garcia andHenry Coleman III both use their fifth year of eligibility, andSolomon Washington runs it back,Buzz Williams shouldn't have to mess around with much frontcourt help in the portal.\n\nVANDERBILT\n\nPriority:Backcourt | Vanderbilt certainly will need to add a few veteran guards to replaceEzra Manjon and Evan Taylor.\n\nDon’t overlook:Jason Rivera-Torres might be a real dude sooner rather than later. Keeping him at Vanderbilt better be a real priority for whoever is at the helm.\n\nILLINOIS\n\nPriority: Creators who can shoot | If Illinois envisions a 2024-25 rotation featuringTy Rodgers,Amani Hansberry and incoming freshman big manMorez Johnson, head coach Brad Underwood will need a whole lot of shooting from the other five rotation players to make it all work.Luke Goode is a sniper, but shooting will be vital for Illinois' portal adds to complement Rodgers, Hansberry and Johnson.\n\nDon’t overlook: Underwood has flexed in the portal before, but this is another cycle with multiple difference-makers needed. Marcus Domask,Justin Harmon,Quincy Guerrier,Terrence Shannon Jr. andColeman Hawkins are all likely out the door. There could be attrition at other spots as well. Illinois could enter portal season needing to go big game hunting for a lead guard, a two-way wing and another frontcourt piece.\n\nINDIANA\n\nPriority:Game-changing lead guard | Indiana desperately needs to flex its muscles for a big-time point guard who can elevate everyone else on the roster. The presence ofTrey Galloway orGabe Cupps shouldn't scare any would-be transfer from coming in and running the show.\n\nDon’t overlook:Kel'el Ware,Mackenzie Mgbako andMalik Reneau all have intriguing stay-or-go decisions to make. Ware's decision feels self-explanatory, but can IU get the other two back under the premise that things will be different?\n\nIOWA\n\nPriority:Find theBen Krikke replacement | Maybe this is internal with a guy likeLadji Dembele stepping into a role. Maybe it's external where Iowa dips into the portal for another skilled forward to slide next toOwen Freeman and dominate.\n\nDon’t overlook:Tony Perkins has another year of eligibility if he wants it. The senior guard played at an All-Big Ten level this season. If he returns for Year 5, Iowa's game plan in the portal looks way different.\n\nMARYLAND\n\nPriority:Shooters | A healthyChance Stephens and a second year out ofJamie Kaiser should help solve Maryland’s shooting woes, but it’s not enough. A point guard who can shoot and a wing who can shoot feel like must-haves for Kevin Willard’s club.\n\nDon’t overlook: This season hasn't gone according to plan, butJahmir Young's two awesome seasons should resonate in the portal. Maryland has an opening in its backcourt that's ready to be filled. It should get its pick of a talent-laden litter.\n\nMICHIGAN\n\nPriority:Frontcourt | Tray Jackson andOlivier Nkamhoua are gone, and more frontcourt exits wouldn't be much of a surprise. Michigan should be in the market for multiple forwards.\n\nDon’t overlook: Massive roster turnover is always expected after any down year, andJuwan Howard's exit, Michigan's roster will look vastly different next season.\n\nMICHIGAN STATE\n\nPriority:Extreme Makeover Frontcourt Edition | Michigan State will need aMalik Hall replacement. That's hands-down the biggest priority, but getting more production from the 5-spot will be vital, too. Tough conversations seem on the way.\n\nDon’t overlook:Tyson Walker will move on and don’t be surprised ifAJ Hoggard chases greener pastures too, but MSU’s pretty well-positioned to fill those gaps. IfJaden Akins returns,Jeremy Fears Jr. gets healthy after a horrific shooting incident and freshmenKur Teng andJase Richardson are ready to go from the jump, Michigan State's guard play will be more than serviceable.\n\nMINNESOTA\n\nPriority:Frontcourt depth | Every rotation piece can return except for high-energy, backup big manParker Fox. Retention will be paramount for Ben Johnson's group to continue to elevate, but the frontcourt could turn into a big need ifDawson Garcia opts to chase his professional dreams.\n\nDon’t overlook: Minnesota has had three different point guards in Johnson's first three seasons.Elijah Hawkins can change that if he runs it back.\n\nNEBRASKA\n\nPriority:The right role players |Keisei Tominaga’s Nebraska tenure will be over (sad), andJosiah Allick is also out of eligibility, butRienk Mast,Juwan Gary,Brice Williams,Jamarques Lawrence,Eli Rice andCJ Wilcher form a strong nucleus.Fred Hoiberg doesn’t need superstars. A skilled forward who can help protect the basket and stretch the floor would be helpful. Another big-bodied guard certainly wouldn’t hurt to buff up the rotation. Nebraska is positioned to take some real swings for difference-makers, but it has a lot of pieces already in place.\n\nDon’t overlook: That second-year jump for transfers has been a huge story. Williams and Mast are super impactful right now. Could they be special next year? Keeping them from poachers is paramount.\n\nNORTHWESTERN\n\nPriority:Point guard | Northwestern needs to find its point guard of the future to step intoBoo Buie's large shoes.Ty Berry,Matt Nicholson andBrooks Barnhizer are three roster lynchpins that should improve Northwestern's sell for potential transfer point guards.\n\nDon’t overlook: Head coachChris Collins has had a nice little hit rate with transfers.Chase Audige was great last season, andRyan Langborg has been a plug-and-play starter. Finding a point guard is paramount, but this group could use another shooter to fill Langborg’s role.\n\nOHIO STATE\n\nPriority: Two-way dudes | Ohio State has to get more impactful, two-way rotation players. There were far too many players in Ohio State's rotation who struggle on one end of the floor or the other.\n\nDon’t overlook:Pop Isaacschose to stay at Texas Tech amid a coaching change, and it's worked wonders for both sides. WouldBruce Thornton orRoddy Gayle do the same?\n\nOREGON\n\nPriority:Guards | Jermaine Couisnard's departure would open the door for some shots, usage and minutes to be had. Internal options likeKeeshawn Barthelemy orBrennan Rigsby could earn that big role, but it shouldn't stop Oregon from making some big swings in the portal.\n\nDon’t overlook: Can Oregon somehow get a second season out of bothKwame Evans Jr. andJackson Shelstad? The opportunity would be there in spades...\n\nPENN STATE\n\nPriority:Two-way guys | Penn State doesn’t have nearly enough guys who are assets on both ends of the floor. Penn State should have room for multiple portal adds, andMike Rhoades needs some real hits.\n\nDon’t overlook: DoesAce Baldwin see himself playing five years of college basketball? He showed incredible loyalty toMike Rhoades when he followed him from VCU to Penn State. Will he stick around for one more year?\n\nPURDUE\n\nPriority:Roster retention | Keeping the core group of players will be more important than anyone Purdue could get out of the portal.Lance Jones is out after this year, and this might be the best time forZach Edey to test his NBA luck, but a core ofBraden Smith,Fletcher Loyer,Trey Kaufman-Renn,Caleb Furst,Myles Colvin,Mason Gillis andCam Heide is good enough to win ballgames.\n\nDon’t overlook: Current freshmanMyles Colvin and 2024 signeeKanon Catchingswere enormous recruiting wins for Purdue. They are expected to be the key for the Boilers to reach their ceiling, but ifMatt Painter targets another combo guard/wing in the portal, that might give us a hint that Colvin and Catchings aren't quite as ready for a huge role as some might have thought.\n\nRUTGERS\n\nPriority: Space issues? | Five-star freshmenAce Bailey andDylan Harper are on the way, headlining a historic Rutgers recruiting class, but changes are coming. Let’s do some quick deduction. Five incoming freshmen and three super seniors are out of eligibility. That means at least two more players on the roster now are gone next year. Is one of themCliff Omoruyi? Will Rutgers have any room left for a transfer?\n\nDon’t overlook:Ron Harper Jr.'s talented little brother is the headliner, but the quartet ofDylan Harper,Jamichael Davis, Jeremiah Williams andDerek Simpson could be tantalizing.\n\nUCLA\n\nPriority: Shooting |Will McClendon has been the lone bright spot for a UCLA team that struggles to throw the ball in an ocean far too often. But UCLA's roster-construction gameplan for 2024-25 could be shaped by how the final weeks of the regular season progress. If it looks raggedy again, major changes seem likely. If UCLA continues to make real progress, running it back with this group and adding a veteran transfer or two to the frontcourt would make some sense.Adem Bona will likely go pro andKenny Nwuba is out of eligibility, but everyone else could return to Westwood.\n\nDon’t overlook: Stay-or-go decisions for the international freshmen.Aday Mara,Berke Buyuktuncel,Jan Vide andIlane Fibleuil have had rocky starts to their respective UCLA careers, to say the least. We've seen multiple international freshmen depart after short stints in the States in the last two cycles. Will UCLA's youngsters stay?\n\nUSC\n\nPriority:Veteran guards. USC will already have to replaceBoogie Ellis andIsaiah Collier, butKobe Johnson andBronny James could also exit as well. USC has some talented freshmen guards on the way, but the opportunity for a big-time transfer guard (or two) might be too good to pass up.\n\nDon’t overlook: IsAndy Enfield for sure back? He's built four straight NCAA Tournament rosters, so moving on after one down year would feel a bit cruel, but USC has been an abject disaster at times this season.\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nPriority: Big wings | This was already an all-in roster. Fifth-year seniorsKeion Brooks,Sahvir Wheeler,Paul Mulcahy,Moses Wood andAnthony Holland will be out of eligibility. BothFranck Kepnang andBraxton Meah will have decisions to make about using a potential COVID year. This roster was already planning to look wildly different in 2024-25.\n\nDon’t overlook: Mike Hopkins is out which has thrown the rest of this roster into a tizzy ahead of the Big Ten move.\n\nWISCONSIN\n\nPriority: Retention | Greg Gard can be picky in the portal.Tyler Wahl is out of eligibility, but Wisconsin could getAJ Storr,Steven Crowl,John Blackwell,Chucky Hepburn,Max Klesmit,Connor Essegian,Nolan Winter andCarter Gilmore all back. Wisconsin could just elevate Winter into Wahl’s spot in the lineup or shift to a four-guard lineup to clear space for Essegian or Blackwell to earn a starting gig.\n\nDon’t overlook: With the right stay-or-go decisions, Wisconsin could enter 2024-25 as the Big Ten favorite, but some attrition is normal and wouldn't be shocking.\n\nOREGON STATE\n\nPriority: Skill and creativity | Wayne Tinkle's status is the elephant in the room. Oregon State has been a bit better, but can Tinkle avoid the chopping block? If so, can he add more skill and creativity to this roster.\n\nDon’t overlook: Oregon State was unable to make any waves in the portal last year. Will that be the status quo?\n\nWASHINGTON STATE\n\nPriority: Isaac Jones replacement | Kyle Smith continues to unearth gems out of the portal. Idaho transfer Isaac Jones was his latest. But replacing him will be easier said than done.\n\nDon’t overlook: Smith continues to get the raw end of the deal in multiple stay-or-go decisions. Can he avoid that in 2024?\n\nGONZAGA\n\nPriority: Backcourt depth | Gonzaga can't trot into next year without fortifying its backcourt depth in a real way. But it could be hard to gain traction with transfer guards if Ryan Nembhard, Nolan Hickman and Steele Venters all run it back.\n\nDon’t overlook: Anton Watson is a massive loss, but Ben Gregg, Graham Ike and Braden Huff is a frontcourt that certainly works.\n\nMEMPHIS\n\nPriority: Frontcourt makeover | Malcolm Dandridge, Jordan Brown and Nae'Qwan Tomlin are out of eligibility, so Penny Hardaway should have plenty of opportunity and history to sell transfer big men.\n\nDon’t overlook: The loss of Jahvon Quinerly will loom so large. A veteran point guard might be just as vital as rebuilding the frontcourt from scratch.\n\nNEW MEXICO\n\nPriority: Rotation guard | New Mexico should be in good shape if Jamal Mashburn Jr., Donovan Dent and Tru Washington return, but a fourth guard would be ideal since Jaelen House and Jemarl Baker are out of eligibility.\n\nDon’t overlook: Can New Mexico get JT Toppin back for another season? That'd be massive.\n\nSAN DIEGO STATE\n\nPriority: Frontcourt | San Diego State doesn't have another Jaedon LeDee walking through that door right away, but his All-American season should open eyes in the portal.\n\nDon’t overlook: Reese Dixon-Waters is another high-major transfer who has shined for San Diego State. Brian Dutcher is really good at this portal thing.\n\nCOLORADO STATE\n\nPriority: Isaiah Stevens 2.0? | This is a veteran-laden roster, so a lot of change is in store already. Can Colorado State be a landing spot for a talented point guard who wants to follow the Stevens model?\n\nDon’t overlook: Will Niko Medved finally take the jump? The noise is ramping up...\n\nDAYTON\n\nPriority: Impact big man | DaRon Holmes II should get an opportunity to cash an NBA paycheck next season after his massive year. Can Dayton parlay his success into making a big splash in the portal?\n\nDon’t overlook: Dayton has so many key role players who can return with shooting up and down the roster. It's tailor-made for a dude to come in and thrive."
