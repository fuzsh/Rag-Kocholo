        "text": "AT a high point in his young career, Arthur Agee, a 14-year-old basketball player at St. Joseph High School in Chicago, stands on the court with his idol, Isiah Thomas. The N.B.A. star is visiting his old school, and as Arthur goes one-on-one with his hero, the boy flashes a smile as big and joyous as any you've ever seen.\n\nFour years later, Arthur's classmate William Gates, who also dreams obsessively about playing in the National Basketball Association, has progressed to the Nike All-America basketball camp, where college coaches look over high school players. Spike Lee visits and tells the students a cold-blooded truth: they are being used and the one way to protect themselves is to know it. \"The only reason you are here is because you can make their schools win and they can make a lot of money,\" Mr. Lee says of the coaches. \"This whole thing is about money.\" It is the kind of valuable advice boys like Arthur and William, from poor black neighborhoods, hear all too rarely.\n\n\"Hoop Dreams\" is a brilliantly revealing documentary that follows Arthur and William through high school to their first year of college. Along the way it raises many potent questions, none more difficult than this: How can you encourage the kinds of dreams that transform Arthur's face while keeping harsh reality in sight?\n\nThe film makers, Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert, spent four and a half years with the boys and their families, acquiring 250 hours of film. Their fascinating, suspenseful film turns the endless revision of the American dream into high drama. The story begins when Arthur and William are actively recruited by St. Joseph, a mainly white, Roman Catholic school with a major basketball program. Just as the boys' paths seem settled -- William is heading for a dazzling college career and pro prospects, while Arthur is spiraling downward -- they face abrupt changes. \"Hoop Dreams\" is the profound social tale of these two emblematic boys, who are sucked into a system ready to toss them aside, disillusioned and uneducated, the minute they stumble on the basketball court.\n\n\"Hoop Dreams\" will close the New York Film Festival on Sunday night at 8, the first documentary ever to do so. (It will open in New York next Friday and around the country on Oct. 21.) It is a daring choice for the prestigious closing-night slot because the movie, though finely made, is not about bravura film making. Instead, \"Hoop Dreams\" affirms the role of film as a medium for exploring social issues. And like any important documentary, this one raises crucial questions beyond what is on screen. How does the camera change the subjects' behavior? How well can the film makers, who are white, see beyond the stereotypes of poor black kids and their broken families?\n\nThough it tries, \"Hoop Dreams\" doesn't find the complex people behind the stereotypes often enough; as viewers, we remain sympathetic voyeurs rather than intimates. The film's great achievement is to reveal the relentless way in which coaches and recruiters refuse to see Arthur and William as anything other than social cliches.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
