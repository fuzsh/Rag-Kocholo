This is not TV. Do not devalue the expertise and vision of great filmmakers. The #auteurs matter more than they ever did.” A Shift in the Narrative: Newman believes, \"I think we're in the midst of a big cultural change. Look at the 1960s with Westerns or Bible movies. They got swept away.\" I yearn for the day when superhero movies and other CGI-heavy amusement park films are replaced. I hope that studios won’t resort to another poor choice, like toy or game movies, but instead prioritize original stories imbued with genuine meaning and emotional depth. The success of “Oppenheimer” serves as a potent reminder of the captivating power of such #films. Oppenheimer’s Triumph: A hearty congratulations to the team behind “Oppenheimer,” which has become a box-office sensation, grossing $957 million worldwide. It bagged seven awards in total and became the highest-grossing film to win Best Picture in over two decades, exemplifying the power of original filmmaking. Bravo to Cord Jefferson! His Oscar win for the satirical film \"American Fiction\" is a well-deserved recognition. This film, especially relevant for the literary world, uses humor to explore representation in publishing. ‘American Fiction’ instigates a dialogue about the prevailing trends in the literary industry. The film satirically highlights how the focus has shifted from the quality of the narrative to the identity of the author. It underscores the growing emphasis on representation, often overshadowing the intrinsic value of the work itself. This trend raises questions about the future of literature and storytelling, and whether an author’s identity has become a determining factor in the success of a book. Lastly, I had the pleasure of watching #Dune 2 in #IMAX, and it was nothing short of breathtaking! If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend you do. #FilmIndustry #Auteurs #OriginalStorytelling\n\nLove this clip. The story dictates everything, and staying true to that, true to the emotion beneath it, is what it’s all about. And Lynch truly is the master of that. He talks about this concept in many of his interviews. That his films aren’t about capturing a reality. They are about capturing an emotional truth. That’s what drives him, from writing to shooting. Even in terms of how he directs his actors. Who cares if it goes off script. As long as the truth of the emotion is there, it’s right. As simple as this seems, and as much as it seems like it should be common sense, it seems like this is lacking in most movies these days. At least the big budget movies. It’s more about capturing attention. So what ever it takes to give people a theme park ride rather than give them an emotional experience, a catharsis. But this is why I love Lynch so much. A lot to learn from him and to be inspired by.

We may think we are alone, though we are not. When we grow up and go into the real world, we are full of dreams. We are excited about what the future may hold. But soon we also run into the anxiety of whether we can make it. The unfamiliar places and people can hit us like a cold wall. We suddenly find ourselves too small, out of place, not smart enough, not cool enough, not ______ you can fill in the blanks. We try hard to ‘fit’ in, or worse, start unconsciously despising ourselves, our roots. Sometimes the anxiety and fear of rejection makes us run away even before we enter the room and say ‘hello’. The rooster that accompanies the girl becomes a poignant metaphor, akin to a cherished companion. In the grand theater of life, our loved ones often witness our struggles to make a mark, silently standing by. Sometimes, they stand as the sole witnesses to our battles, unwittingly becoming casualties of our emotional turmoil—be it a mother, a partner, or a loyal friend. Fortunately, the narrative takes a positive turn as the girl embraces herself, her origins, and strides confidently into the world, her 'loyal buddy' cradled in her arms. I wonder what the film maker tries to convey in the part when the girl goes back to her childhood home – finding solace in the familiar embrace of her surroundings and her mother, she soon grapples with the feeling of outgrowing her past. She finds herself too big to fit into the same pool, too big for the park bench, too big in front of her mother, too big to fit under the ceiling. Like a puzzle piece no longer fitting its place, she realizes she has evolved beyond the confines of her childhood abode. This symbolism echoes the universal theme of attempting to revisit our past or 'home,' only to recognize that while occasional visits are comforting, we cannot settle here. Like the fledglings in the nest, when it is time to fly, they have to leave the nest. It is painful, but necessary part of life. Your childhood home always welcomes you, but you must move on. Love the closing scene where the protagonist steps out with her mother’s shawl proudly wrapped around her shoulder, head held high and feet confident that the way forward will open up new beginnings, and new friends at every turn. #mindfulness #wellbeing #leadership #socialtransformation #mentalhealthmatters"
