        "text": "PARIS -- A couple of exciting matchups are on tap on the pitch and on the hardwood, as the knockout stages in basketball and soccer continue at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWatch the Olympics on FuboTV (7-day free trial) and Peacock\n\nWOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL QUARTERFINALS\n\nWhere: South Paris Arena (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nChina vs. Turkiye (3 a.m., Peacock)\n\nFollowing a disappointing quarterfinal exit in Tokyo three years ago, China has been very impressive thus far in Paris, winning all three of its matches, winning Pool A. They look to advance to the semifinals for the first time since they won gold in 2016. This is just the third Olympic Turkiye has qualified for. They went 2-1 during the group stage, finishing second in Pool C.\n\nBrazil vs. Dominican Republic (7 a.m., Peacock)\n\nThe reigning silver medalists are destined to make it back to the gold medal match. Brazil has been dominant, winning all three of its matches in straight sets. They have made it to the semifinals in seven of the previous eight Olympics. The Dominican Republic snuck into the quarterfinals thanks to a win over the Netherlands, giving them a 1-2 record and a third-place finish in Pool C.\n\nUnited States vs. Poland (11 a.m., NBC, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nThe United States certainly has not been world-beaters, but they have been good enough to move onto to the quarters to continue to defend their gold medal. They went 2-1 in pool play, only losing to China. Poland also comes into the knockout stage with just one loss, that coming at the hands of Brazil, finishing second in Pool B.\n\nItaly vs. Serbia (3 p.m., Peacock)\n\nThe Italians are seemingly on a path to face to Brazil in the gold medal match. The European nation dropped just one set on their way to winning Pool C with a 3-0 record. However, despite advancing to the quarterfinals for the fifth time in the last six tournaments, Italy has never made it to the semis. Serbia has made it to the final four in the last two tournaments, but is going to have its work cut out for them on Tuesday after going 1-2, finishing third in Pool A.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nWhere: Stade de France (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nSESSION #10 (4 a.m., USA Network)\n\nMen: Javelin Throw (Qualification, 4:20 a.m.), 110m Hurdles (Repechages, 4:50 a.m.), 400m Hurdles (Repechages, 6 a.m.), 200m (Repechages, 6:38 a.m.)\n\nWomen: 1500m (Round 1, 4:05 a.m.), Long Jump (Qualification, 5:15 a.m.), 400m (Repechages, 5:28 a.m.)\n\nSESSION #11 (1:35 p.m., NBC)\n\nMen: 400m (Semifinals, 1:35 p.m.), Long Jump (Final, 2:15 p.m.), 1500m (Final, 2:50 p.m.)\n\nWomen: Hammer Throw (Final, 1:57 p.m.), 400m Hurdles (Semifinals, 2:07 p.m.), 3000m Steeplechase (Final, 3:14 p.m.), 200m (Final, 3:40 p.m.)\n\nThere are a couple of Americans who are expected to challenge for the gold in the 200-meter sprint. Gabby Thomas has the fastest time so far this year (21.78), as she looks to improve on her bronze medal performance in Tokyo from three years ago. McKenzie Long has won a pair of NCAA national championships in her career, and has looked good in her first round of domestic races this year.\n\nWith reigning gold medalist Elaine Thompson-Herah not competing this year, defending world champion Shericka Jackson is hoping to hold the Jamaican flag proud. Her times might be off from what she was running in 2023, but she is still a favorite heading into the event.\n\nFull track & field schedule here\n\nMEN’S BASKETBALL QUARTERFINALS\n\nGermany vs. Greece\n\nTime: 5 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nChannel: E! Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nAn intriguing matchup featuring one of the best players in the game, and a very fundamentally sound squad.\n\nLed by Giannis Antetokounmpo, Greece was able to recover from early losses to Canada and Spain, and sneak into third in Group A with a win over Australia in their opening round finale. It marks the first time since 2008 that the Greeks have made it to the quarterfinals, though they have never made it to the semis.\n\nGermany has also not made it to the final four, but this year’s team is destined to change that. The Germans have a lot of momentum heading into the knockout stage after winning Group B.\n\nSerbia vs. Australia\n\nTime: 8:30 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nChannel: USA Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nIn just their second Olympic appearance (as an independent nation), Serbia is trying to prove they belong with the best. Led by NBA MVP Nikola Jokic, the Serbians only faltered against the U.S. in the opening round, finishing second in Group C with a 2-1 record. Serbia made it all the way to the gold medal game in 2016.\n\nAustralia was one of three teams in Group A to end up going 1-2. Their lone win came against Spain and they ended up with a negative point differential, the only second-place team to have that distinction. The Aussies are trying to make it to the semifinals for the second straight tournament.\n\nFrance vs. Canada\n\nTime: 12 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nStream: Peacock\n\nThis is by far the best Canadian basketball team ever sent to the Olympics. Led by Shai Gilegous-Alexander and RJ Barrett, along with a solid core featuring Jamal Murray, Canada not only qualified for the tournament for the first time in 24 years, but they are back in the quarterfinals after going perfect in the opening round, winning Group A. They are trying to make it to the semifinals for the first time in 40 years.\n\nNot if the reigning silver medalists have anything to say about it. The host nation only lost to Germany in the first round, finishing second in Group B. With a healthy mix of NBA talent and a good supporting cast, don’t count this French team out from making it to the final four.\n\nBrazil vs. United States\n\nTime: 3:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Bercy Arena (Paris, France)\n\nChannel: USA Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nThe United States is once again looking like a juggernaut. Not only did they go 3-0 to win Group C, but they also scored the most points (317) and posted the best point differential (+64) of any team in the group stage. Led by guys like LeBron James and Kevin Durant, it is going to be tough for anyone to stop them.\n\nBrazil might just be counting their blessings on even making it to the knockout stage. After missing out on the Tokyo Games, the South American nation snuck into third in Group B with a 1-2 record, giving them a spotin the quarterfinals for the first time since London 2012.\n\nFull basketball schedule here\n\nWOMEN’S WATER POLO QUARTERFINALS\n\nWhere: Aquatics Centre (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nCanada vs. Spain (8 a.m., Peacock)\n\nIn just their fourth Olympics, Canada is back in the quarterfinals once again. They snuck into the quarterfinals thanks to a win over China in the group stage, finishing fourth in Group A with a 1-3 record. The Canadians have never advanced to the semifinals. The same certainly cannot be said for Spain, as they took home silver in two of the previous three Olympics. This year’s team went a perfect 4-0 to win Group B, including picking up a win over the United States.\n\nNetherlands vs. Italy (9:35 a.m., Peacock)\n\nAn intriguing matchup in the second quarterfinal. The Dutch, who gold all the way back in 2008, had only qualified once before this year. However, they looked good in the opening round, going 3-1, finishing second in Group A. The Italians didn’t even qualify for the Tokyo Games after taking home silver in 2016. Yet, they snuck into third in Group B with a 1-3 record.\n\nAustralia vs. Greece (1 p.m., Peacock)\n\nThis is one of Australia’s best teams in a long time in the Olympics. They waltzed through the group stage, winning Group B with a perfect 4-0 record. They are looking to try and move on to the semifinals for the first time in 12 years. This is the first time Greece has qualified for the Games since 2008, and though they only finished with a 1-2 record, it was enough for a fourth-place finish in Group B.\n\nHungary vs. United States (2:35 p.m., Peacock)\n\nThe Americans’ quest to become the first team to win four straight gold medals at the Olympics, male or female, has not come without challenges. They were brought down to earth after a frustrating loss to Spain in the opening round, finishing second in Group B with a 3-1 record. While Hungary has just one medal in women’s water polo, they have been consistent in making deep runs, advancing to the semifinals in each of the last four tournaments. This year, they went 2-2, good for third in Group A.\n\nBEACH VOLLEYBALL QUARTERFINALS\n\nWhere: Eiffel Tower Stadium (Paris, France)\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nMEN’S\n\nNils Ehlers/Clemens Wickler (GER) vs. Stefan Boermans/Yorick de Groot (NED) (11 a.m., Peacock)\n\nSince Julius Brink and Jonas Reckermann won gold in 2012, no German duo has even made it to the semifinals in beach volleyball. Ehlers and Wickler are looking to change that. de Groot and Boermans finished 3-0 to win Pool F and are trying to become the first Dutch team to make it to the final four since 2016.\n\nEvandro Goncalves Oliveira Jr./Arthur Diego Mariano Lanci (BRA) vs. David Ahman/Jonatan Hellvig (SWE) (12 p.m., Peacock)\n\nBrazil is always a force in beach volleyball, and Oliveira and Lanci are trying to become the first team from the country to play in the semifinals. Ahman and Hellvig entered the tournament as one of the favorites, but two losses in pool play led to a third-place finish in Pool A.\n\nWOMEN’S\n\nMariafe Artacho del Solar/Taliqua Clancy (AUS) vs. Zoe Verge-Depre/Esmee Boebner (SUI) (3 p.m., Peacock)\n\nde Solar and Clancy are looking to improve on their silver medal finish three years ago. They had one minor slip-up in the opening round, finishing second in Pool B, but have played well for the most part.\n\nSara Hughes/Kelly Cheng (USA) vs. Tanja Hueberli/Nina Brunner (SUI) (4 p.m., NBC, FuboTV, Peacock)\n\nHughes and Cheng are looking to become the first American duo to advance to the semifinals for the first time in eight years. This team won Pool C, and has not dropped a set so far. Verge-Depre and Boebner also won their pool, finishing first in Pool D after going 3-0.\n\nFull beach volleyball schedule here\n\nSKATEBOARDING\n\nWomen’s Park Final\n\nTime: 11:30 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: La Concorde (Paris, France)\n\nChannel: E! Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nThe door for the gold medal is open in women’s park, with many young guns vying for the podium.\n\nTokyo 2020 silver medalist Kokona Hiraki caught everyone by surprise as a 12-year-old, and now with a little more maturity, has her sights set on taking home gold. However, Great Britain’s Sky Brown, despite suffering an MCL tear in April, has her sights set on the gold in Paris.\n\nAnother competitor to watch out for is Australia’s Arisa Trew, who won both of the Olympic qualifiers and the X Games event in June.\n\nWOMEN’S SOCCER SEMIFINALS\n\nUnited States vs. Germany\n\nTime: 12 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Lyon Stadium (Lyon, France)\n\nChannel: USA Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nThe United States are playing like they have something to prove, though they almost let it get to them. After one of the most dominating performances in Olympic football, the Americans found themselves in a knock-down, drag-it-out contest with Japan in the quarterfinals. Thankfully, a Trinity Rodman strike in extra time secured a 1-0 win, and another semifinal berth for the Americans.\n\nGermany also needed extra time to get to the final four. After going scoreless through 120 minutes against Canada last Saturday, they relied on the heroics of goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger to make two saves in penalties, scoring the clinching goal herself to send the Germans to the semifinals for the first time since they won gold in 2016.\n\nBrazil vs. Spain\n\nTime: 3 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Marseille Stadium (Marseille, France)\n\nChannel: E! Network\n\nStream: FuboTV (Free Trial), Peacock, Sling, DirecTV Stream\n\nSpain’s first Olympic appearance almost came to a screeching halt. The reigning FIFA World Cup champions found themselves trailing Colombia late in regulation in the quarterfinals. That was, until Irene Paredes scored in stoppage time to send the match into extra time. Spain ended up scoring on all four attempts in penalties to pick up the win.\n\nBrazil certainly was not a favorite heading into their quarterfinal match, as they had been rather underwhelming in the group stage. Yet, in a rather controversial match against host nation France in the quarterfinals, Portilhop Gabi’s 82nd-minute goal proved to be the difference in a 1-0 win, sending the team to the semifinals for the first time in two tournaments.\n\nFull soccer schedule here\n\nFULL SCHEDULES"
